Let Us 
965 I came to otre Dame convinced in conser­
vatism and fervently supporting U.S. actions in Vietnam. At that 
time I felt we were stopping Communism and promoting the free­
dom and self-determination of a small nation. I believed we were 
unleashing our power, at last pursuing a policy which would bring 
us victory. 
Better than two years have passed. As I read stories of the latest 
Viet Cong offensive intermingled with the same absurd Administra­
tion predictions of triumph I cannot help but reflect on the inac­
curacy of the position to which I once adhered. Like every other 
American who wholeheartedly supported the war, I allowed my­
selfto be deceived, deceived as to U.S. objectives and deceived as to ' 
the effectiveness of the application of U.S. power. 
A simple observation of any newspaper today shows the quan­
dry of the United States. We are, first of all, overcommitted. As 
Russia moves into the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Alliance dis­
integrates, the United States pours its forces into a small country 
in Southeast Asia. At the same time, it applies those forces in such 
a manner as to scatter them and allow a small and relatively back­
ward nation to inflict devastating defeats upon us and maintajn 
control of large areas of South Vietnam. Thus America finds her­
self hamstrung internationally and desperately spread out and un­
able to concentrate in the region she -has sent her forces. Thus 
strategically the war has had a devastating effect. 
Overcommitment is not simply a matter of deployment. It is a matter of emphasis. As our cities explode we spend two billion dollars a year on a poverty program, two billion which is cut back and nearly strangled. Meanwhile, we spend a ballooning $29 billion on a limited war 8,000 miles from our own shores. With the money we spend on Vietnam, it costs an average of $250,000 to kill every Viet Cong soldier. At the same time, the Neighborhood Study 
Help Program in South Bend cannot even get a yearly grant of $80,000 renewed. The war has damaged our priorities. There is one more question, a moral one. We are waging a war of attrition in Vietnam. The Administration admits this. Yet, the 
enemy continues to pour in men and materials. Our strategy has 
failed, yet one thing is clear from viewing the ruins of Saigon and 
Hue after the latest battles. We are wearing down the people of 
Vietnam. There are already il million and a half refugees in Viet­
nam, more than 1U% of the people we are supposed to be saving. We bomb cities with napalm. Perhaps the Administration's intentions are best revealed in the comment of a U.S. officer looking over a rui.ned Delta village: "We had to destroy this village in order to save it." 
I look over all of the things I have cited, plus the plummeting prestige of my country, and feel that I was in error. My feelings are stren_gthened as the Fulbright hearings reveal what really went on in the Gulf of Tonkin, as I read of the increasing militancy of the Administration and determination to escalate, even to me pmnt of tactical nuclear weapons, when escalation has failed. The Viet­nam War is hurting this nation and wounding its spirit. 
What should be done? What can we do? These are most com­plex questions. I do not pretend to have answers to them. I be­lieve there are no simple solutions. I can only urge those who still feel we are on the right path to look around and see where we have been led. For one who has gone along with what we have been do­ing it is a most sobering observation.

EDITOR -IN -CHIEF PATRICK COLLINS FOUNDED NOVEMBER 3, 1968 NOTRE DAME, INDIANA 
Parietals 
University rule number nine is very explicit: "students may have women guests in student rooms only on occasions announced by the Dean of Stu­dents." Now we all know that on certain weekends in the fall, permission is announced, and if it weren't -no matter-women would be guests in the rooms de..spite the rule. In past years, rule number nine has been no deterent to many pre-Lenten revellers as well. Rectors openly permitted women guests in the dorms at Mardi Gras, or at least quietly turned their backs. 
This year the Dean of Students generously al­lowed women guests in the rooms at hours even la­ter than during football season. As far as we can tell, Notre Dame was left unshaken. Few even both­ered to look at the bulletin board as they hurried upstairs with their home town honeys. It was a plea­sant weekend if you had a girl, but hardly a differ­ent situation than any other weekend. 
Actually women are guests in most halls now whenever students want them in. We all know this. So does the administration. They tacitly acknow­iedge these parietal hours by their non-enforcement of rule number nine. But sometimes, just to show us what good guys they are, they officially recog­nize de facto parietal hours, like during this past weekend. This raises the question of why not on other special occasions as well, like Groundhog Day or Good Friday (sub Immaculate Conception if necessary) or Everyday. The administration's 
arguments against parietal hours have always rested on flimsy grounds, and every occasion of permitted parietal hours undermines "them still further. 
The administration shouted never on cars and apartments several years ago. Now it shouts never to parietal hours. But at the same time it is gingerly testing campus sentiment. An administration trial balloon on weekend hours enforced by hall boards was rejected as inadequate by the Hall President's 
Council last fall. Now we have another try this week­end. Never is being replaced by maybe. The Admin­istration is trying to find some way out of the cor­ner into which it has backed. The permission was a small concession to reality. Many more are needed. 
Gardner 
On Wednesday night the Senior Class will present its Patriot of the Year Award to John Gardner, who finished second in the balloting to one of our 
University President's favorite authors, George Kennan. While it is unfortunate that Mr. Kennan could not accept, former Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Gardner is an excellent and 
worthy substitute. 
John Gardner is· a man well respected by his peers as one of the finest cabinet members ever to serve under a President. It is no secret that Mr. Gardner refuses to stay within a administration that continues to carry .on a ridiculous stalemated war to the neglect of the rising crisis in our cities. 
.-Men of 'SUCh political capability and courage are too rare upon the American scene. As a ded­icated and honest American, he deserves fully the 
praise we shall accord him on Wednesday night. 
JAY SCHWARTZ 

We Got No Trouble 
Right here in River City sang the man of 
seventy-six trombones and right here it is. Yes sir 
plebians, puritans, pilgrims, progressives right here 
it is -a veritable journalistic tour de force on the 
newstands. 

The latest contribution to the editorial hodge­
podge is an almost nonsensical tabloid with the 
rather cute name of "The River City Review." 
Since South Bend is located on one of the south 
bends of the St. Joseph River and since everyone 
remembers Robert Preston, that bourgeois im­perialist, who conned the poor peasants of their money for non-existant music and since. this area is the province (and the exclusive province) of provincialism, therefore the name of this publica­tion is "The River City Review." Q.E.D. 
Well anyway the revolutionary gazette which 
is "A bi-monthly gas bomb against the status quo, 
a litany to the liberation of our people" is sup­
posedly here to stay and step right up because for 
the mere sum of twenty-five dollars, yes sir, twen· ty-five dollars you, yes you, may have a copy on ·your doorstep (if you have a doorstep) tor eight and one-third years right up until the Eve of the Revolution which shall arrive on July 1, 1976. As you might have noticed this projection is con­venient since this is also a capitalist holiday being 
the end of the fiscal year. 

It <besn't really matter which way you read 
this under-water bikini of a newspaper because it 
isn't the kind of publication that matters anyway. 
On the fourth and last page of this erudite grab 
bag we find the liberated woman. A relevant pic­
ture tells the entire truth of "a woman who is 
grooving, liberation stvle -with Che, and The 
Pill." Unfortunately beauty is in the eye of the 
beholder and sometimes only skin deep. Miss 
Dawson continues in her article to show that wo­
men liberation is a movement much akin to Black 
Power. "In both instances, the ultimate goal is 
not to become a woman, or to becorre black, but 
to become a full human being." Evidently written 
in the fmest tradition of black humor, dear Denise 
is not only charming but her sharply analytical 
mind and pen have caught the qualitative differ­ence between being a woman and being human. Q.ED. 
On page 3 the reader encounters a well-written article on grades and education by errant mystic, Ken Lux. Mr. Lux's prose stands by itself but his logic falls on its face. Lamenting the carrot and stick character of the present grading system, Lux calls for internal rather than external motivation. Yet what he advocates (good student gets to have a friendly pat and more busy work, work, work) sounds like a new name for the same old donkey and incentive routine. Unfortunately Lux violates good taste (mine if not anyone else's) when he fmishes his article with a typical, devil-may-care obscenity. 
The front page piece tells the reader that the peace movement has taken a new turn due to the recent Dow demonstration. The movement "finds itself the representative of the majority rather than a tiny unrepresentative group trying to pro­voke thought." Incredible bourgeois that I am ­and all the time I thought the idea was to con­vince rationilly and to take political action po­litically. Yes sir, revolution in a sandbox. It's just amazing what General Giap's writings can do for a gang of guys. 
Finally the reader catches a glimpse ot the truth in the never ending editorial. "Presently, the educational system in this nation is desigr.ed and used as a filling station for the military­industrial complex." Beware students who want to work after graduation or you who want to be psychologist, urban planners, teachers, writers, movie magnates, doctors etc. because you are going to be members of you know what. 
The River City Review cons its name from the "Music Man." There are other songs in that musical like "You Gatta Know The Territory" or "Gary, Indiana". Perhaps the revolutionary gasette should realize that they just don't know the territory or they should move to the 
steel city. The River City Review claims to be a molotov gas bomb. Actually it's a firecracker and a dud at best. 

To the editors: I hope you will publish this letter in the interest of the dissemination of correct infor­mation. The story you pub­lished on the Committee on Academic Progress and the Col­legiate Scholars (February 28th) contains several errors. The fol­lowing paragraphs are intended to correct some of those errors. The Steering Committee of the Committee on Academic Progress selects Collegiate Scho­lars from among those who have applied by April 25th. Applicants are expected to have excellent academic records: 
hence  special  notification  of  
the  Collegiate  Scholar  oppor­ 
tunity  is  sent  in early  March  

to juniors who either study 
under the C.A.P. or have, at 
the time, Dean's List standing. 
Applicants are judged on the basis of their record, a written proposal describing the program they wish to pursue as a Col­legiate Scholar, and an inter­view. Applicants do not con­tinually submit proposals until one is found acceptable. 
Finally there is no fixed number of Collegiate Scholars. The number depends entirely on the number of students who are, in the judgement of the Steering Committee, able to 
'benefit f-rom this arrangement,

Chairman, C.A.P. 
Editor: 

In recent issues you have gi­ven considerable coverage to the exclusion policies of the NYAC. In reading these articles, 1 am struck by the bourgeois and ri­diculous nature of such protests. To consider this "a real issue of flagrant social injustice" reveals a vapid ignorance of contempo­rary social problems. 
The effort to narrow this pro­test to the NYAC is first un fair. The club has no monopoly on the "one rather strange idio­syncracy." Most gentlemen's clubs or country clubs have fol­lowed exclusion policies for years. That is in the very nature of the idea of a club. In most instances, their policies have worked against Negroes, Jews, Italians, and to a lesser degree, most Roman Catholics. 
The fact that the NYAC is a so-called "Catholic" Club does not somehow make its exclusive policies a!) the more heinous. Would not exclusion policies based on race, religion, or creed be just as reprehensible at an "Episcopalian" or"Jewish" club? 
The present furor over this NYAC policy concerns me be­cause it reveals the frustration of its advocates. They appear to be concerned over the gleam in their neighbor's eye while venting the gleam in their own eye in this verbal self-righteous­ness. In their frustration, they have vented their tears over sp­linters in the social eye. The issue today is not club member­ships which are at best a middle class concern. Rather they seem to be ignoring exclusion policies in education and employment. These are the real issues of social injustice. 
It will be many generations before Negroes are members of NYAC in any appreciable degree if these real problems are not solved. We must eliminate the barriers to basic opportunity be­fore we do battle with the paper dragons at the NYAC. I for one would much rather see the Notre Dame alumni declare themselves in favor of equal employment and let the NYAC, or for that matter, any exclusive club pur­sue its petty policies. 
I do not mean to imply that their exclusion policies are jus­tifiable. However, should the NYAC disband its objections to people on the basis of race, color, or creed; I certainly hope they will continue to exclude Stokeley Carmichael, Jimmy Hof­fa, and a few other undesirables from membership. After taking ·a second glance at Mr. Con­don's likeness next to his col­umn, this might also include him. 
Sincerely, Joseph Blake

"I wanted to work for a small company. It may sound crazy, but that's why I went with IBM!' 
"When I was in school, I dreaded the thought 
of working for some huge company where I'd 
be just another number," says IBM's Jim Hamil­
ton. (Jim, who has a B.S. in. Electrical Engineering, 
is a Systems Engineering Manager in Marketing.) 
"At the same time, I knew there were definite ad­vantages in working for a large firm. So as I inter\'icwed each company, I checked into the degree of indi\'iduality I could expect there...... 
"One of the main reasons I picked IBM was their decentral­ization. They've got over 300 locations throughout the country. Which to me means a big company with a small-company atmosphere. , 
IBM's small team concept 
"Actually, there's plenty of decentralization e\'en within each 
location. For instance, in science and engineering, they use a 
small team concept. It means, no matter how large the project, 
you work individually or as part of a small team-about four 
or five people. 
"In marketing, I was pretty much my own boss even before I became a manager. As a systems engineer, it's up tu you to find the solution to a customer's problem, and then see it's carried out in the optimum way. You work with the customer every step of the w,ay."

Godoy Blames 
Impatience For 

DominicanWoes 

Former Dominican Republic 
President Garcia Godoy blamed 
his people's belief "that they 
would advance overnight," as one 
reason for the revolts in his coun­
try. President Godoy spoke here 
Saturday as part of the Midwest­
ern Conference on Foreign Af­
fairs. 

"Free elections were held in 
1962," said Godoy, "But the men 
who overthrew the government ' 
established by the elections were 
intent that there would never a­
gain be free elections in the Do­
minican Republic. At that point 
things were very tense. Any little 
flame could have started a very 
big fire." 

He said that the situation of 
the country was viewed by the 
way in which the people them­
selves were living; but that 80 
percent of the people were not 
living the same way. Godoy said 
that Americans should not judge 
the people of the Republic until  
they have travelled there and 
seen how all of the people live. 
Godoy said that traces of 

unrest could be found as early as 
1962, and that the Americans 
there felt the situation had chan­
ged radically by 1965. On April 
28, 1965 when the Marines land­
ed in Santo Domingo the entire 
city was divided in revolt. But 
interventions by Cyrus Vance and 
McGeorge Bundy failed to relieve 
the situation. 

Godoy said the common com­
plaint from the peoples was their 
frustration at not being able to 
participate in the governmental 
system. He said the political solu­
tion was the only possible one. 
Godoy said there are political 
situations in several countries 
in Latin America which cannot 
be solved by military revolts. Godoy said he was convinced that the military would not like the 

free elections so, he said, he made sure that the opponents in the military were removed from co­
mmand.

Find out how you can benefit 
Sanders' sales jumped last year from 66 to over 139 million dollars. The growth came from within, from sales of new systems, programs, and equipment we designed and developed. 
Behind this success story are 150 interdisciplinary teams, working on electronic, space, oceanographic, and basic research problems. You never stop learning, at work with men from other fields, at in-plant seminars and courses, at nearby universities. No technological obsolescence.

Mter graduation, what? Will you begin your career as an engineer or scientist or return to school for an advanced degree? 


YoucandobothatNOL 

If you are an engineer in the top third of your class or a scientist in the top quarter of your class, NOL offers you the opportunity to begin your career in one of the world's great laboratories and, at the same time, go ahead with your plans for graduate study. 
From the very beginning, new staff members have an oppor­tunity to contribute directly to significant projects ... to be pa..rt of an organization where groups are small and emphasis is on the individual. 
NOL offers you a graduate study program that is one of the largest and most productive programs in the country. Each year members of our professional staff receive M.S.'s or Ph.D.'s through this program. NOl has a significant ad­vantage in its proximity to the U_niversity of Maryland. Many NOl staff members hold permanent part-time positions on the Maryland faculty, and graduate level courses are taught at NOl every semester. Maryland also offers many courses on its own campus-only minutes away-at times which are convenient to and keyed to the special requirements of NOL  
sile systems, instrumentation for weapons evaluation and aeroballistics research, and performance of new concept feasibility experiments. 
Chemical Engineers and Chemists-for research and devel­opment pertaining to high-energy propellants and explo­sives; high polymers; molecular and crystal structures; electrochemistry; high-temperature, high-pressure chemical equilibrium studies; and the thermodynamics of high· energy reactions. 
Engineering Physicists and Physicists-theoretical and ex· perimental research in a wide range of areas including signal processing, infrared radiation, acoustics, magnetic and semi-conductive materials, and detonation physics; plus weapon systems development and studies. 
.. 

NOL is a laboratory in the true meaning of the word, and one of the largest and best-equipped laboratories in the world. It is the nation's leading R&D establishment for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), the Navy's principal high speed aeroballistics activity, and a leader in the develop­ment of new air and surface weapons. The spectrum of 
research at NOL ranges from nuclear effects to acoustics to explosives and materials. At NOL, weapons development is carried through from inception to design to prototype test and development. Since 1950, NOL has completed 209 new weapons and devices such as SUBROC, nuclear deptt. bombs, mines, projectile fuzes, underwater detection sys· terns, and components and design data for POLARIS, TARTAR, TALOS, TERRIER, ATLAS and TITAN missiles. A civilian staff of over 3,000 people includes more than 1,000 professional engineers and scientists-experts with na­tional and international reputations. Extensive and unique facilities embrace wind tunnels operating to Mach 17, hypervelocity baltistic ranges, the world's most exceptional hydroballistic facility, shock tunnels, 300g centrifuge ... multi-million-dollar experimental facilities. 
Here is your opportunity. Each year, NOL interviews out­standing engineering and science graduating students. Selects the handful that seems to be really creative. Takes tbem to its beautiful 875-acre "campus" (the front yard is a golf course) in the rolling hills of Maryland near the Nation's Capital. Puts them through an optional one-year professional development course with rotational assign­ments to various areas within the laboratory to prepare them for permanent assignments.
