Author, politician Phillips speaks 

Vol. V, No. 47 Serving the Notre Dame and Sa{nJ Mary's College Communi~)' Friday, November 13, 1970 
By Pat Gooley 
Kevin Phillips, a syndicated 
columnist and author of The 
Emerging Repuglican Majority, 
spoke to a large audience on 
1970 campaign strategies. Many 
points of view were represented, 
as could be judged from 
audience response to his various 
comments. 
Phillips explained the thesis of his book, the Emerging Republican Majority, explaining that he studied past voting patterns in the hope of prtodicting future trends . His analysis shows 32 to 36 years of power with minor variations since 1828. According to this analysis, the 1968 election 
_s!!ould mark the start of a period of Republican dominance for much of the rest of the century. 
He noted that two ma~or factors affecting t.l1ese trends are major popuiation shifts and economic upheavals that pitted the South and West and what he called "the Spiro Agnew North" against the Northeastern "Establishment." 
In his analysis of this year' s election, Phillips saw an over-all Democratic advantage, but deemed it fairly unimportant. "The Democrats' only claim to performance was the 
gubernatorial races" His analysis of trends within the past two 
decades  indicated  that  such  
advantage  does  not  seem  to be  
very significant.  

Phillips also analyzed some of the things that were wrong with Republican strategy this year, citing a poor knowledge of the constituency they have to work with as a major fault. 
"They (the administration) 
think the world eats at Howard 
Johnson's," he said. 
Phillips also criticized campaign advertising. He said that the "ambiguous image• that was successful for Nixon in 1968 "bit the dust with great 

dexterity" this year. He also 
criticized certain of the 
comments and actions of the 
Vice-President, but added, 
"Radical liberal worked in New 
York (Phillips' home state)where 
there are a lot of radical liberals. 
But in North p_akota, a radical

liberal is someone who wants higher wheat prices; they forgot about that." 
He also mentioned what he called "anti-advertising" showing the foibles of candidates as proving their rapport with the average citizen and those of one's oppoent as being bad. He cited the cases of Florida, where one candidate walked over I000 miles, and the New York Senatorial race, where "Ottinger -U.S. Plywood -had some of 
, the veneer stripped away." Looking to the 1972 election, Phillips commented on Maine's Senator Muskie, the man largely considered as the probable Democratic challenger. Phillips had little faith in front-runners two years before the actual election. He used the example of George Romney, saying that one analyst had called Romney's brainwash, "Not ~ wash, just a

big success 
Terming the Sophomore Parents' Weekend a "big suc­cess", Gary Caruso, executive coordinator of the sophomore class said yesterday that "Fr. Hesburgh's speech to the parents Saturday night in Stepan Center really made the weekend." Abo,tt 1600 parents and friends attendi!d the sophomore affair which included seats to the Pitts­burgh game, a catered dinner, an~ the Sergio Mendez concert. 
Caruso explained that the idea 
of a weekend for the sophomore 
parents was originally that of Fr. 
Charles McCarragher. The soph­
omore officers began working in 
May, distributing letters and 
postcards publicizing the event 
throughout the month of June. 
"Personally I spent about I000 hours working on the weekend right up to the final days," said Caruso. "I'd just like to reiterate what Fr. Hesburgh told the parents and say that I hope it sets a precedent."

GM settlement likely 
DETROIT (UPI) The-.united Auto Workers' General Motors Council recommended yesterday the 375,000 union members on strike for 59 days accept the tentative national contract with GM although UAW President Leonard Woodcock said he was not satisfied with the accord. 
The council's decision came on a show of hands vote and about four fifths of the 350 council mem hers were in favor of recommending acceptance. 
Workers traditionally fallow the council's recommendation. 
It they ratify the pact-which GM calls inflationary and which is expected to cost the company well over $2 billion in wages alone over three years-some pro­duction lines at the world's largest manufacturing organiza­tion probably will start rolling again by Dec. l. 
"1 want to tell you I am not satisfied with this package" Woodcock told the 350 GM council members and several hundred other union members when he began a five hour clause by clause explanation of the tentative agreement in a hall at Detroit's Riverfront Veterans Memorial Building. 
"But there comes a point of time in the battle when the gains to be made have to be weighed agai~!-~e hardships being in­llicted on the troops on the line'· said Woodcock. 

But about I00 dissident mem­hers of the United National Causus-a small U A W splinter group-urged rejection of the ten­tative pact by picketing the building. Unable to get into the crowded hall they kept up their heckling as Woodcock began his presentation. 
The tentative agreement was reached after a 25 hour bargain­ing session Wednesday· 
A UAW spokesman said ratifi­cation voting was expected to be by Sunday and probably would continue for four of five davs. 
He said umon negonators probably would present the pact to Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. Without waiting for the results of the voting. The com­panies not struck by the union traditionally have accepted vir­tually the identical agreement as the strike target. 
The agreement covers only UAW members in the United States. Both sides still are nego­tiating a contract foe the 23,000 U A W members in Canada. 
Uqder the agreement UAW members who now get an ave­rage $4.02 per hour would get raises of 51 cents per hour in the first year and 14 cents per hour -in the second and third years. 1n aurlition GM agreed to lif~ the

Heller emphasized the "tender and pure lyricism" of Brecht, and the fact that he could keep this virtue in the "most political times." Heller read several of Brecht's poems, twice in German so as to show their true lyricism.

What's so ~~ecial about Beechwood Ageing? 
We must be bragging too much about Beechwood Ageing. Because we're starting to get some flak about it. Like, "Beechwood, Beechwood ... big deal." And "If Beechwood Ageing is so hot, 
let Budweiser ferment a second time. (Most brewers quit after one fermen­tation. We don't.) These beechwood strips offer extra surface area for tiny yeast particles 
to cling to, helping clarify 
why don't you tell every­body what it is?" So we will. First, it isn't big wooden casks that we age Budweiser m. But it is a layer of thin wood strips from the beech tree (what else?) laid down in a dense lattice on the bottom of our glass-lined and stainless steel lagering tanks. This is where we the beer. And since these strips are ~lso porous, they help absorb beer's natural "edge," giving Budweiser its finished taste. Or in other words, "a taste, a smooth­ness and a drinkability you will find in no other beer at any price." Ah yes, drinkability. That's what's so special about Beechwood Ageing. But you know that.

A new cabinet post was cre'at­ed, the Special Projects Director, who will work on projects desig­nated by Krashna. Tim Connor, formerly Research and Develop­ment Director, has been designa­ted to fill the post. 
Bob Ohlemiller will assume duties as the Research and Devdopment Director. He was formerly an assistant in that offic,e. 
One other change was an­nounced. Paul Dziedzic has been named as an assistant Public Relations officer. Krashna said, "He came to us and said he wan ted to help on press releases. I felt Don Mooney needed some help, since it is such a large department.''

An evaluation of the Student Government was prepared by the Cabinet and presented to Krashna. He said, "The big thing they said was that we haven't been into the halls as much as we should. We do plan to do it, 
although it is hard with all the other meetings we have." 
In other developments, the Student Government is planning to sponsor two "big events" next semester according to Krashna. 
There will be a General Assembly of Students the early part of second semester, "hope­fully in the first or second month." Bob Meyers will run the Assembly, although the SBP will chair it. "In it, the students can offer proposals to a commit­tee, which they will then devel­op. It will be as informal as possible, but with the necessary 
Each hall will partici­pate, "Krashna stated. A two day Police Conference will be started, bringing local and state police to campus, ·along with the NO security force. One of the main reasons the conference is being sponsor­ed is the incident in Alumni Hall last year, in which some of the local police were called on cam­pus. Krashna feels that because of this, "we need some understanding between the stu­dents and poiice." The conference will be stru­ctured along the lines of a work­shop. with students getting a chance to meet police officers and officials. K rashna said, "Students look down on police, and police look down on stu­dents. We feel that some of these oponions whould be confront­ed." Krashna also plans to invite Fr. Hesburgh to participate, in his capacity as Civil Rights Commissioner.

Student cooperation great; local kids to attend game 
On Saturday almost 700 South Bend area children will see their first college football game when Notre Dame takes on Georgia Tech. This project, or­ganized by chairmen Eric Andrus, Jack Candon, and Diane 


Eric Andros Shahade, was finalized last night when the chairmen met with the monitors who will watch the children during the day. The childn:n will all meet at their schools and then be driven by Notre Dame students to Ste­pan Center where they will meet with their monitors. The driving is being done by 53 cars and a bus donated by the rowing club. The children will then be taken on a 2 hour tour of campus. About 12:30 they will all be brought to the Stadium. Each monitor has at the most two children. Most of the moni­tors are tutors and they will be with the kids that they teach. The kids will have the tickets donated by the Notre Dame students body. They are placed as close as possible to the moni­tors, but a minimal amount of moviH-g around will have to be done. Andrus asked that "the stu­dent body be patient and cooperative at the game if they are asked to move a few seats so that the children can sit with their monitors." The monitors will remain in their assigned seats and the children will move up with them. Andrus emphasized his plea for cooperation and pa­tience because he admitted "this is essential for this project to work.'' After the game, the children and the monitors will return to Stepan Center. They will then be driven home.

Deal for the Students 
The Senate, as it painfully agonizes over the budget, needs a most immediate reminder 
of where its priorities are, and where they should be. They are with the halls. Sixty-three 
percent of the students asserted that last March, and the assertion remains undiminished. 
In the deliberations so far, the Senate has granted three organizations more money that 
they requested. In one case -the Hall President's Council-the increase was justified by the 
money-back-to-the-hall provisions defended by Mr. Winnings and others. It was also 
justified by the enormous plurality for Mr. Krashna, campaigning precisely on that 
platform. It is the will of the students. 
Less justified are the increases in the Afro-American and Mexican-American budgets. 
The rationales offered justify the allocation to the Afro-American society above and 
beyond their budget request are patently irrational. Senators are elected to consider the 
validity of submitted budgets from all organizations, not to "make a committment," as 
Mr. Winnings vaguely theorized, or to "solve a real problem in the world, "as Mr. Ryan 
muttered. The student Senate of the University of Notre Dame has not the capacity to 
help solve the world's real problems. It has barely the capacity to help solve the student's 
problems. If the senate is to make any committment, it mus be to the students who 
elected them -a committment to judge every budget rationally, fairly, and objectively. 
Neither a budget one hundred and fifty dollars over the budget request, as the senate 
passed, or one five hundred dollars over the budget request, as Mr. Krashna insisted upon, 
qualifies as either rational, fair, or objective. 
Equally poor was the Senate's allocation of fifteen hundred dollars to the 
Mexican-American Society. Mr. Conroy asserted that the society had submitted a "really 
good program"' and in the same breath that they had "totally underestimated their 
costs." At the risk of sounding obvious, we suggest that organizations incapable of doing 
minimal work such as estimating their costs and developing their budgets would be hardly 
able to "run really good programs." 
If either organization truly desired the further budgeting the Senate gave to each of 
them, that desire would have appeared in print. The two organization's abscences spoke 
eloquently for them. 

Student Government is, at the moment, twenty four thousand dollars in debt to the 
University. The debt could undercut at any monient Student Government's dealings with 
the University. This year's Senate has three options open to it. The first is to continue 
practices of making dramatic gestures to the detriment of the student body. The second is 
to overspend the budget and perpetuate the debt. The third is to assume a bold new 
priority, as the Student Body asserted that priority last March. 
We advise them to adopt the last choice.

With the annual budget fiasco almost at an end it has become painfuly obvious that the Krashna administration has chosen to igneore its main campaign promise. 
During last year's SBP race the victorious candidates promised a greatly increased emphasis on hall life. This has not been done. Instead we have witnessed the same old attitudes on the part of the so-called student leaders who sit in LaFortune. The government is still highly centralized and the union has gone its merry way absorbing more and more activities and organizations. 
There is great potential in the halls. While no hall or halls could have concerts and the like there are many fine activities they could do which serve to bring people closer together. President Krashna claimed that his administration would direct attention to the halls, yet he made no protest when the Senate tossed thP. HPC a fiscal bone in the form of $3000. 
It seems student government has failed to realize that the huge majority who voted for Krashna indicated their desire to see a viable hall oriented policy. · 
Even if the new constitution is eventually implemented it will probably be far too late to do any good. The HPC will be stuck with a budget drawn up by a lame-duck legislature and a compliant student government. 
The present administration obviously has no desire to decentralize its powers, activities or money. The Senate, while probably not very happy with the budget is unable to act, as it has been for the past three years. The only body which can act is the Hall President's Council. 
Opponents of the new constitution have cited a reluctance on the part of the HPC to assume the Senate's duties, as proof that the Senate should be retained. The HPC itself has lent credence to these claims by vacillating in their attitudes towards the constitution. In fact a good number have flatly declared their unwillingness to assuem anY responsibilities. 
The HPC, with firm decisive action can dispel these doubts. They must petition the Senate to raise the activity fee back to $16 with all monies realized to be given back to the halls. A committee composed of Hall Presidents and Senators could then decide who to give the money to. 
Until and unless the HPC decides to act, student government, student union and the Senate will continue to follow the same old course of virtually ignoring the halls and allowing influence and power to gather in a centralized administration. 
. None of these bodies are going to change voluntarily, because no matter how many campaign promises are made each year there are many people who have been solidly entrenched and have no intention of sacrificing any fo their petty influence in 
a move to decentralize the government. Their main inclination

Tuesday Night: Earth Light Theatre 
Professor Carl Estllbrook teaches in the history depart­ment at Notre Dame. He attend­ed Harvard University, where he received his doctorate. 
Historians are by nature men of conservative. temperament. Since Thucydides, they've known that there is nothing really new under the sun but only rearrangements of earlier patte~ns. So they don't hesitate to deal with problems from a timeless perspective .or to ab­stract concept such as "force" and "revolution" and treat them like Platonic ideas. They are, 
in effect, Gnostics: there is a "secret knowledge" of human reality to which history is the key. Now, as you might imagine, it has become unfashionable to hold such things too openly: your garden-variety historian deals with the minutiae in flux over the unchanging human reality." (Some historians will of course go so far as to deny the existence of that "unchanging human reality" while continuing to work on the minutiae; but this is only the parallel Agnosticism generated by every Gnosticism.) In short, historians are conservative because they know they've seen it all before. For this reason it is particularly disturbing for some­one like me who is enmeshed in the historical toils to read Sidney Lens' The Military­Industrial Complex. For what Lens has done in this simple and straightforward book is to show that something truly new has

Nearly I ,000 people were baptized Sunday night at Cahn Auditorium, and the medium was neither fire nor water. It was Earthlight. 
Earthlight is a year-old Los Angeles based theater troupe, and the only theater group signed to perform at last summer's Woodstock festival. 
That was impressive enough, but their Sunday trip, the kick-off to Symposium's week-long "Projections '70's" program, should, if there were any booking agents in the audience, make them a much desired cast on college campuses.

Lens argues that 

The military-industrial complex is not a fateful accident but an outgrowth of a new postwar concept of national purpose --global expansion. The continental expansion of the nineteenth century and the limited imperialism of the first part ofthis century has widened, as a result of the unparalleled victory in World War II, to global dimensions -demanding for the first time in American history a large military establish­ment in peacetime. 
The domestic backlash of this policy has been to weld together those elitist elements at home 
Their modest publicity sheet, 
distributed at the door, says Earthlight 
"makes use of various theatrical 
techniques." 

A better analysis would be to say the 
best parts of Second City, The 
Committee, Hair, and Living Theater are 
emodied in this young, fluid, and 
really-together company. 

The applause was slow in coming at first. Several skits or "pieces" went by uninterrupted by any audience reaction. But the crowd was just getting the feel of the group. 
Tqward tile end, skits occasionally were interrupted by applause, and frequent whistling, stomping and cheering heralded the final point of a skit. 
Some of the skits were prophetic, some 
profound, and some just fun. Two skits, 
back to back, told, in I 0 minutes, the · entire history of aggresive capitalism.

It would be sacrilege to call one scene where two members of the cast appear naked an example of "tasteful nudity." There's no way to change the minds of those in the audience who see public display of the human body as obscene. The wordless society of how various segments of society, fully clothed and obscene in their own right, impose themselves on two people in love, and making love, was one of the most poignant of the evening. 
Editor: I wish to congratulate The Observer for 
. Mr. Lenehan's coverage of tlte Sergio Mendez concert. This review was a typical manifestation of the lack of taste and cultural knowledge which has so far proven to be an unfortunate character­istic of your newspaper. True to its image as a provincial little midwestern college, The Observer has once again proven its cultural contribution to the community to be not even neutral, but negative. 
Many of us have wondered why The Observer failed to cover some other musical ·and cultural shows of inter­national interest, especially that which took place on Columbus Day, sponsored by the Pan American Club and the Latin American Circle. Now I'm quite sure that your oversight is appreciated in view of the fact that your concert reporter can­
not tell Lc.tin rhythm from the noise made by the garbage trucks on campus-despite his self-appointed exper­tise in the fields of Brazilian opinion and Latin Sexuality. 
Last year The Observer proved its acrobatic ability by dodging the issue when asked to account for the lack of coverage of the Indian Association's program for the Ghandi Centennial, and 
ism abroad and radical class divisions ~t home have grown into an almost unassailable monstrosity. And so the ~ecent impassioned attempts by the few American radicals and left-liberals fundamentally to re­order the society's priorities seem terribly pathetic --like attacking a flight of armed heli­copters with a can of Flit: esthetically· pleasing, perhaps, but not terribly effective.

the China Night festivities. Excuses for this ranged from being uninformed to complaints of being understaffed, with no one to write your articles ... while I wrote and personally submitted one of the previews myself. 
There happen to be somewhere in the ballpark of around three hundred foreign students on this campus, and another thousand or so who have travelled to other countries, all of whom would appreciate your refraining from insulting our intelligence with the assumption that the only cultural experience attainable here is dropping acid ... and maybe coming up with another "once I read some­where". In view of such inadequacy and lack of preparation, maybe you are in your right to fill in columns with abor­tion ads and continue to undermine your pret-,nse of representative journalism at Notre Dame. But rather than pretending to fill the cultural gap with such blatant manifestations of ignorance, why don't you exercise your editorial ability by dispatching Mr. Lenehan to an assignment on his own taste and cultural level, such as decorating bathroom stalls? 
Sincerely, 
Fred Voglewede society, and therefore a necessary alteration of the institutions which embody the present ideas. Many of us who look forward to that sort of revolution see it as a resurrection

Observer Cartoons 
Dear Editor: 

Something has been bothering me about the Observer since I saw my-first issue this year, and that is the cartoons printed on your editorial page. I do not know who is your resident artist, but on the whole, I find the cartoons a poor excuse for the role they are supposed to play in expressing editorial opinion. They are generally vague, irrele­vant, inconclusive, and for the most part, rather stupid. They seem to try to convey some measure of humor, but even in this, they are usually unsuccess­ful. 
To my mind, the purpose of an editorial cartoon is to point out discrepancies in the "sys­tem" by ridiculing the discre­pancy through a caricature or some other form of drawn satire. They are meant to be relevant to presszng issues that have hope of being-remedied, possibly through the efforts of the car­toon itself. The cartoons I have seen in the Observer have dealt with issues that either have no relevance to contemporary living at Notre Dame, or issues that have no possible hope of reme­dy. 
As I said, I have been noting this fallacy of the Observers since the beginning of school this year, but the cartoon in last Wednesday's issues prompted me to finally write this letter. This was the first time I had seen evidence of a real caricaturist working for the Observer. The cartoon, one of Student Body President Krashna walking away from the Senate meeting singing "Boots," was in itself rather idiotic, but the artwork was out­standing for the Observer. Why 
can't this fine artwork be put to good use? 
The editorial cartoon of a newspaper is supposed to be equivalent to any other editorial published (more so, for more people are willing to take the 2-3 seconds needed to read the cartoon than the ten necessary to read an editorial). If the Observer continues to print the type of cartoon it does now I strongly suggest that this feature be moved to the Features Page, for it surely does not belong with the editorials. 
Thank you,

To Chris Wolfe 
Dear Editor: 

In typically simplistic manner, Chris Wolfe has once more un­dertaken to solve a problem and thereby miss the whole point ­this time, abortion. Obviously, abortion is not the panacea to the ills of the world. But, what any serious person must come to grips with is: "how does this fit into the overall scheme of the ultimate solution to these prob­lems"? We must take each aspect of the total picture, examine it, judge it -not only in itself, but in its relation to the overall picture. We must decide if the new problems arising from the solution are worse than those 
which the solution tries to solve. 

If we were to reject something 
because it does not cure the 

world's ills, we would no longer 
have, among other ditties to 
which Mr. Wolfe is attached, the 

U.S.A. nor Mother Church. But some good did spring from it, I now better understand why people like Ti Grace Atkinson are the way they are.

Perhaps in his next column, Chris might propose that we use the many people who die daily from going to quacks for abor­tion, or who die from malnutri­tion or other "natural" causes that we use them to solve th~ problems of overpopulation, un­wanted pregnancies, food short­age, etc. 
Or better yet, perhaps he may decide to attempt to come to grips with an issue, rather than set up dummy issues with which anyone can deal. Answers of the kind Chris has are a dime a dozen. What the world needs is some intelligent, thoughtful at­tempts to solve its problems. 
Walter G. Secada Jane Fonda Editor: l wish to publicly congratu­late Jim Metzker on his presenta­tion of another fascinating speaker. Miss Jane Fonda provi­ded a balance to the other ex­treme viewpoints that have been presented on campus during this semester. The taJk itself should have been recorded for the sake of posterity. Though its subject matter differed,it was certainly comparable to Pericles' Funeral Oration. Its power was overwhel­ming, its naked force magnifi­cent. 
In closing, I can only hope that the university recognize Miss Fonda's brilliance and con­tributions to society, and con­sider granting her an Honorary degree in Economics and Politi­cJl Science.

It has been said that the fu­ture of our country is in the hands of the young. You are part of this generation and if you are a sample of the politi­cian of the future, I prefer to remain in the present. You have demonstrated the lack of reason and understanding that now plague this country. 
I hope and pray that the statement that you represent the views of the student body is incorrect. For if it is not then the N.D. community is in for a neriod of degression. Because it has elected "leaders" who will perpetuate the oppression and lack of understan'ding that has too long been evident in this society. 
If the "Student government". can't do the black students of 
N.D. any service then I propose that they return the S.G. fee that was imposed upon the Black students: so that it can be given to an organization that will benefit us and not hinder us.

Abortions 
Editor: 

Although I would not usually assist in prolonging such a sordid controversy as that concerning abortion which is currently so much a feature of your pages, my disgust at the hypocrisy and shallowness of the apolo­gists--both student and non-stu­dent-for liberal abortion laws will not allow me to remain silent. Indeed, one recent speak­er (at least according to The Observer report of the matter) actually had the gall to mask his contemptible advocacy of such laws under the guise of balancing the right to be born against the right to be born into a "wel­coming" and materially securL' family! As an individual born out of wedlock and raised under what, to say the least, were not the most happy of circum­stances, I still thank God that neither that speaker nor our supposedly "concerned" stu­dents were in a position to de­cide whether or not I would have the right to be born. likewise am thankful that at the time of my conception there was a Catholic clergy with firm prin­ciples on the matter of abortion and sufficient backbone to resist such a practice, even it if meant stepping on the toes of a bunch 
of moral degenerates. Perhaps,however, 11 enough individuals are made aware of the glaring hypocrisy of those who one mo­ment condemn the recruitment of personnel for DOW and the next moment condone or even invite the destruction of helpless human beings whose main mis­fortune is that they are not viable outside the womb, some good may yet come of this disgusting spectacle to which the "Notre Dame-St. Mary's Com­munity" is presently being treated. "Thankfully Alive" 
The Stripper 
Editor: 

Across both campuses in Notre Dame, Indiana the cry of "Who was that unmasked man?" rings out after this year's home football games. We feel that the Observer has been derelict in its duties of reporting the news. In the beginning of the year the Observer printed an article in which the question of the stripper's replacement was put forth. When a man, the "Naked Kahuna," fulfilled the mandate of the people nothing was said. This dedicated performer does not desire money or material acclaim, but only wants the recognition an accomplished quick change artist deserves. Thus we demand that the Observer fulfill its obligations and give this performer the recognition he deserves. We also ask the fans to direct their attention to section 30 row 54 on Saturday at the end of the third quarter and give this red­blooded American a round of applause to show your approval and give him the strength to continue his act during the wintry month of November.

probably pass it by next semester. Giuffrida feels that solid proposals must be .made to replace the present nine general suggestions. 
The university does plan to build new parking lots as it constructs new buildings and enlarges its faculty and student body. All those interviewed were unanimous, however, in wanting to preserve the beauty of the campus. Future parking lots will be kept as much as possible to the periphery to keep cars off the campus and to preserve the grass and trees. (All the trees were left around the stadium when that area was paved.) 
The long range part of the Caruso plan calls for underground garages built into future buildings. It's advocates urge fore sight in the future expansion of the university,. They claim that these lots would not be eyesore, would require no maintenance and little security, hut would provide large revenue. A lot that would hoi d 140 cars would cost $()30,000 (compared to $35,000 for a similar surface lot) or $2,250,000 for 500 cars. 
Fr. Wilson stated that the university is having enough trouble finding money for the buildings themselves, without the added expenditures of underground lots. He said, "the proposal dosen't have too much meaning to the present administration." He also pointed out that the sandy soil around South Bend would make such a structure impractical and expensive. 
Fr. Riehle suggested that an outside entrepreneur might be induced to build and operate a parking garage on campus, but that he would have to get back his initial investment within ten to twenty years, so that the rates would be higher even than the $50 registration fee proposed in the Caruso Plan. 
It is too far into the winter for any new lots to be constructed this year, and Fr. Riehle and Fr. Wilson both pointed out the expenses 

Speakers Bureau instituted to tell l.igh schoolers about SMC 

The Student Dev~lopment Commission of the Student Ser­vices Organization at SMC has instituted a speaker's bureau. Janet Endress, Student Develop­ment Commissioner, is organi­zing this activity, with the assis­tance of Kelly Hamilton. 
The bureau is directed both toward helping keep the calibre of St. Mary's students high, and toward giving the girls a chance to talk about their experiences at SMC. Under the program, girls will go to high schools in their area during their vacations and talk to the students or the gui­dance departments about St. Mary's. Their purpose is not to act as professional recruiters, but to give prospective students a chance to hear first-hand about SMC. 
Sing-up sheets were placed in the SMC cafeteria this Thursday and Friday. The idea right now is just to get the names of girls who might be interested in the project. There will be a short meeting of those interested next

The consideration of co-education between Notre Dame and St. Mary's was highlighted yesterday by a discussion in the LeMans Lounge between Dr. Rosemary Park, a consultant hired by Notre Dame and St. Mary's and a dozen interested students. 
The main area of concern was the question: "If Notre Dame goes coed, what would happen to St. Mary's?" 
First they discussed the status quo: St. Mary's as a Catholic woman's college and its advantages, a good Jaculty, small classes, and a personality reflecting the women that it educates. 
"It is a great compliment with such small classes to have everyong clamoring to get into 
the school. Do we really want to 
give this up?" she asked. 

After they discussed the status quo, there was a discussion of former coeducation plans which, according to one participant, date back to I 5 years ago. Statements centered on the Barat Plan, proposed two years ago, which would move Barat College of the Sacred Heart from Lake Forest, Jllinois to the University of l''"tre Dame. The 
majority of students, felt,· however, that "the plan would pit one school against another aNd create a tense atmosphere reduced to cmpetition." 
Finally they previewed and commented on proposed coeducation plans. 
Within St. Mary's and Notre Dame communitv. the most

NOTRE DAME BOOKSTORE 
feasible plan, according to the participants of the discussion, 
would incorporate St. Mary's into the Notre IVDame community. The present liberal arts co!legees of both schools could be divided into colleges of different orientations. One college would concentrate on graduate school preparation. The other college would stress a well-rounded liberal arts education. Many of the students present felt that this would be a definite advantage especially in the fields of psychology and sociology. In these fields, graduate school applicants must h a v e c e r t a i n p r ere q u isi t es em ph as i zing Iabo rat o ry experiments. But the proposal would also satisfy those students who would be more interested in the humanistic approach. 
Since Dr. Parks has researched several coeducation mergers, the students asked her for some of the solutions of other schools to the coeducation problem She cited the Barnard College ­Columbia -system in New York City. The Barnard Coli cge president serves as a dean in Columbia University and conversely the Columbia president serves on the Barnard Board of Trustees. In addition to the executive sharing, the Bar­nard/Columbia system also in­volves cross-hiring and cross­registration between the two schools. Many of the students at the LeMans discussion felt, how­ever, that the Notre Dame ­SMC coexchangc plan was Jess complicated. 
Whatever plan is adopted hy the Boards of Trustees, most of the girls agreed that the social abnormalcy in which "the ideal (7-I ratio) is not so ideal any more" and the question of academic transfer of credit be­t ween the two schools must re­main high on the priorities of the new St. Mary's Notre Dame 

Nixon chats with dignitaries in Paris 
PARIS (UPI)--President Nixon paid his own final homage and that of the United States to the me.mory of Charles De Gaulle Thursday at a solemn requiem mass in Notre Dame Cathedral. 
Then he conferred for 41 min­utes with French President Georges Pompidou and later had an II minute chat with Soviet President Nikolai V. Podgorny at an Elysee Palace reception for the more than I00 foreign statesman here for De Gaulle's funeral. 
White House Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler described Nixon's talk with Podgorny as "pleasantries." Ziegler said there was nothing in the way of a U.S. Soviet summit conference in their chat which took place shortly before Nixon kft Paris to return to Washington. 
Ziegler said that after passing 
through the receiving line at a 
reception for visiting statesmen 
Nixon and Podgorny recognized 
each other. He said they '\.:dged 
towards each other" and shook 
hands. 

Nixon asked Podgorny where 
he came from and the Soviet 
chief of state said he was from 
the Ukraine. 

Podgorny according to Ziegler 
said the only cities he had visited 
in the United States were New 
York and Washington. Nixon 
replied by recalling his own visit 
to Moscow and said it was not 
typical of the Soviet Union any 
more than New York or Wash­
ington are of the United States. 
r .. : rhey l:d'~ed in this veiil Ziegler said Indian Prime Minis­ter Indira Gandhi joined them with the laughing comment "Can a smaller country get in on the conversation before the l wo big countries have made all the decisions?" 
Both Nixon and Podgorny replied in the same light vein Ziegler said. 
Earlier Nixon visited the Ely­see Palace for what the White House described as a "courtesy call" on French President Georges Pompidou. Ziegler said they exchanged reminiscences a bout De Gaulle and also touched briefly on East West relations. Asked whether this in­cluded Vietnam Ziegler declined to be more specific. 
Nixon's last engagement be­fore taking off for Washington was the Elysee Palace reception given by Pompidou for all the visiting statesmen. 
White House officials said he talked briefly with British Prime Minister Edward Heath, Prince Charles and former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and Harold Mac Millan and former Israeli Premier David Ben Gurion in addition to Podgorny and Mrs. Gandhi. 
Coeducation team confers with NO, SMC students 
.(Continued fr(Jm Page 1) 

Concerning problems the 
team has encountered no single 
one dominates the scene. Dr. 
Mayhew said, "The problem and 
the solutions arc precisely the 
same --human beings. 

One major area of debate at St. Mary's has been the separate "identity" of that institution. Dr. Parks said of this, "It's one of the values you have in this whole situation. You are dealing with institutions that have been in operation for a long time and have acquired a very definite personality. One may say that this amount of human effort ·may not be passed over lightly. This is something one pays attention to, but how much attention is a matter of what one 
thinks the future demands." 

On the subject of a new 
SMC president, Dr. Parks said 
that the currcn t vacancy is an 
advantage for the school. She 
said that once the "path" that is 
to be tahn has been described a 
new president can be chosen to 
meet the criteria necessary to 
the pursuit of that path. This ·s

Dr. Mayhew said, "I think it's 
still too early to say." 
The two investigators said

Dr. Parks, who spent the dav 

at St. Mays's, said sh "picked the

a cad em 1 e s, w h 1ch were condemned in the Congress as anti-democratic when they were founded: the critics were right, and we should admit it; (3) abolition of the uniformed mili­tary, with the retention at most 
of civilian self-defense forces (see the Second Amendment to the Constitution); or, at least, as a step in this direction (4) the reduction of. the glamor and concomitant influence of the military (e.g., the JCS) and the introduction of full civil rights into the military (contrary to the present situation!); and (5) the nationalization of all "defense contractors" until disarmament is complete: as J.K. Galbraith has pointed out, the major Pentagon contractors are "private" industries only in the sense that the profits stay in the hands of a few rather than contributing to the common weal. (Profits on the Minuteman, for example, were about 43% (p.8). Have you invested your money at that rate recently?) 
But of course all this is fantasizing. We know it's not going to happen. The American Revolution is not going to be completed. On the contrary, the lights are going out all over. In a way, that's what The Military­Industrial Complex seems to be 
.!_elling ~s, despite Len~~-own hope that the colossal failure ­by whatever standard -of America's Indochinese adventure has legitimized criticism of the MIC (p. 1; p. 139; and passim). In fact, the surprising thing about American politics today is not that a few call for actions "outside the system" -actions of resistance -but that so many, especially among the so-called "alienated" young, display such a touching faith in the ability of the American political system to turn the MIC around. But what happens when their "Princeton Plans" for two weeks of political activity before the fall elections and their campaigns for a "New Congress" fail in the face of the overwhelming resistence to fundamental change that Lens describes? This is not a deni­gration of these campaigns, which I support, but perhaps for reasons different from those of their initiators; they are at best a first small step towards the 
building of the massive 
consciousness necessary to make fundamental changes in this country. 
But suppose we can contemplate this in all our historical objectivity as we read Lens' book, sit back, and marvel at how much stronger the child­ren of darkness seem to be than the children of light in this generation Amd every now and then it's difficult to suppress a grudging and timorous admiration for those who "rage, rage again~t the dying of the light."
