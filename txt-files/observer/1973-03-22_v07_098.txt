HICCOUP 
by Jim Lindsay Staff Reporter 

Advance selection of major courses, improved departmental counseling, and fewer checkmark courses will hopefully ease the frustrations of preregistering for the Fall 1973 semester, according to Mike Geisinger, committee chairman of H­Man's Investigation Concerning Cruel or llnusual Preregistration <HICCOUPl. 
As plans for advance registration now stand. the usual class-priority procedures will remain in effect, with seniors-to-be registering Thursday, April 26, juniors April 27, and sophomores April 30 through !\lay 3. However. during the three day period prior to the start of preregistration, students will be permitted to secure positions in courses within their own majors. 
Aecording to Geisinger, individual department heads will determine which

Sanctions proposed 
by Michael Baum Staff Reporter 

The Graduate Student Union Committee on Sanctions has sent a proposed listing of violations and attendant sanctions applying to advanced students to the Advanced Student Affairs Com­mittee for consideration. 
The sanctions, developed and rewritten over a period of several weeks,_ repre_sent an _attempt to merge University regulatiOns with the WIShes of the GSU. Like the current the ASAC proposed judicial hearing system, the suggested regulations and sanctions grew out of the so-called Lewis Hall incident of December. 
Actions considered to justify expulsion trom the University under the proposed strictures are: theft, arson, assault, battery, rape, burglary, vandalism, and "pushing" hard drugs. The GSU Com_mitte~'s proposed sanctions differ fro_m Umvers1ty regulations as published by the Office of Advanced Studies in that marijuana or hashish and thier use, possession or sale are not considered a~ serious an offense as hard drugs and carry a maximum sanc­tion of a warning or suspension for "subsequent repeated offenses". 
suspension grounds 
The recommended sanctions also stipulate that felony convictions by the State, "resulting from activities outside the University community" can only be considered grounds for suspension or ex­pulsion if the University can demonstrate that the felony constitutes a "direct and imminent threat to the property or physical safety of the University community". 
The proposal also offers sanctions in the event of violation of the University regulations on the use of alcohol, although. as committee member Paul Bolduc observed, "If there is a graduate student in the University under 21, it isn't by much." 
The greatest problem in formulating the list of sanctions arose from a previous committee report, dated <February 16, listing grounds for graduate student expulsion from the University. 
Offering as proposed sanctions a warning, 
suspension, or expulsion from a residence hall for 
first offenses, and suspension or expulsion fm 
repeated offenses, the committee report listed As 
grounds for action, "a finding that the student 't.S a 
danger to the University's intellectual and-or moral 
standards". This, Bolduc said, "was the part that 
most people balked at on the grounds that it was a 
blank check." 

loosely woorded 
Bolduc said that it was felt that the phrase was too loosely worded to protect a student from arbitrary prosecution by the University. 
The current proposal features a substantial reworking of this clause. Actions carrying the 

studies advance 

maximum sanction of expulsion from on-campus housing include: "violations of the code of behavior for hall residency as determined by each resident hall (andl infringement upon or vilation of resident hall community based norms and values." 
The later clause transfers the norm of behavior from University standards to residence hall stan­dards. Accompanying notes add that the "codes of behavior and community based norms" should reflect "commonly accepted standards of Christian ethics", and go on to say, "Those activities_and sanctions noted under this paragraph rest entirely upon the establishment and operation of a vialbe hall judicial structure for the promugation of rules and regulations and thier enforcement." 
The fourth and final clause of the recom­mendations reads: 
"The objectionable actions and applicable sanc­tions set forth herein presuppose the existence of an acceptable graduate school (University) ad­judicatory procedure t5 insure due process and equal protection." 
points emphasized 
These last two paragraphs, Bolduc said, contain 
the points the committee most wants emphasized. 
"We wrote up the sanctions, but we are counting 
on two things," Bolduc said, "one, that a decent 
adjudicatory system is set up and followed. If the 
judicial system is a farce, then the sanctions and 
regulations are useless. Two, the dormitories 
should set up their own rules." 
Bolduc said that graduate student dormitories at the moment have no judicial systems, hall presidents, or councils, consequently, they have no fixed codes of behavior outside of the University regulations. Bolduc noted that he had sent letters out In the rectors of the graduate dorms 10ver the break inquiring as to what judicial systems currently existed or were being proposed, but had received no replies. 
tenant relationship 
"In loco parentis, while still a hot issue for -the 
undergraduates, should be cold, dead for graduate 
students." Bolduc argued, "The dorms have got to 
start taking care of themselves." He added that the 
graduate dorms should exist more in a tenant 
llandlordl relationship with the University then 
undergraduate dorms are allowed to. 
The adjudicatory system refered to is, of course, 
currently being discussed between the ASAC and 
the University administration. 
GSU President Barry Wessels noted that mem­
bers of the committee are willing to go to the in­
dividual graduate halls to 'discuss the report, the 
setting up of hall judicial boards, and to hear 
comments. Present members of the committee, 
which changed slightly between the first and second 
drafts. are Ann Bates, Art Eaves, Patrick Gibbs, 
Bill Lavage, Tom Moorehead, and Paul Bolduc.

There was an overflow crowd at 
last night's session, and many 
st udenls were forced to sit in the

of budding mechanics. "I was told 
there would be only be 50 or 60 
people" apologized Johnson. 
The first order of business last night was a movie: "A Car Is Born." winner of the National Industrial Film Award in 1972. The film described the production of a l'ar. step-by-step, from theactual digging of raw mineral ore to the finished product: a 1972 l'ord. 
.Johnson also talked about car warranties and then gave a detailed description of the various l'Omponents in the front end of an avt>rage car. He explained the­rune! ions of 1ie-rod ends, shock absorbers and ball joints, and how theycan go wrong. 
The second class will be next Wt>dnesday at 6:30 p.m. in the same room. Mr. Johnson will probably pick up where he left off last night on carburation, and hopefully will have more handouts to go around. 
Notre Dame students are reminded that. while no credit is given for these mini-courses, they have no attendance requirements.

On March 4th I talked to one of 1he members of the Notre Dame hockey team. They had just beaten Minnesota-Duluth and earned the second spot in the WCHA. This guy was overjoyed that lhey would get to play all the playoff games at home in the ACC. Thai meant home ice advantage. 11 meant an overwhelming ad­\'antage over the enemy. Llnfor­IUnately. he soon learned that the IACC does not always hold home ice advantage for the Fighting Irish. 
In the first round of the playfoffs North Dakota was disposed of by a Iota! goals tally of 13-3. The crowd turnout was very poor, but North I lakota was no match for Coach Smith and his team. That first 

Thursday, March 22, 1973 
round victory gave Wisconsin the right to play us in the final round. The Fighting Irish were again going to clash with the Big Red. 
Enthusiasm for the weekend games was unbelievably low among the students. Very few of the people I talked to had plans of staying. After all, how could anyone expect them to stay a couple of extra days when their semester break was starting. I guess my priorities must be mixed up. but I wouldn't have missed I hose games for anything. Guys said lo me. "Yell "XIra loud because I won't be there." Do you know how hard it is to pick up the slack for about a thousand people? 
The record shows that Notre DamP was beaten by Wisconsin in thai series. What the record should show is that the Notre Dame hockey team was beaten by Wisconsin with the aid of the Notre Daml' student body. On that disappointing weekend the hockey learn could easily have considered the student body its biggest enemy. 
The game was indeed played in the ACC here at Notre Dame, but horne ice advantage was not ours. 
I feel very sorry for the guys on the learn. They worked hard all vear and deserved a shot at the National Championship. For most of the guys. however, there is no other chance. John Noble, Paul 
Hegan . Chris Cathcart, Bill {;recn. and Mark Steinborn will never have another chance at that NCAA Iit!e. A disappointment such as occurred on March lOth must leave a bitter taste in one's mouth. Some members of the student body were at those games and shared in the disappointment and the bitterness too. I feel that the NCAA title belongs to this year's team: however, they must wail until :1ext year to prove that fact. I hope that the team has not lost all faith in the students because some of us appreciate their efforts and will always be behind them. 
The hockey team has almost a vear to think about the mistakes ihey made this season. We, the students, also have that same year lo think about how we let them down and decide what we can do about it in the future.

Editor: 
Notre Dame should initiate a policy this year, whereby the graduating senior with the lowest grade point average would receive one dollar at the minimum from each member of his (her) graduating class. This could develop into a worthwhile 1radii ion. especially for the recipient of the proceeds. 
First. it would serve as a fine expression of gratitude to the student who did more overall, than any other. to lower the curve. It would be a particularly appropriate action from those who shared his <her) classes. 
It is highly probable that the individual who could merit such an award refused to allow himself <herself) to be sucked into that rat race for grades which, most admit, does not necessarily relate directly to intellectual achievement. If not, he <she) would still make an ideal representative for those who could claim this distinction. The money could possibly serve as a token gesture of admiration for such hrroic conviction. 
II would surely offer the dude < dudee l some consola lion for the lack of aptitude, which most likely Pxists. or doesn't exist, whichever the case. 
Finally, maintaining the lowest average and still remaining in school. is by no means a simple task. Such a person deserves 
recognil ion  for  this  ac­ 
complishment.  
This policy  is  in effect at the  

Naval Academy, and from what I understand it works very well. At Notre Dame, however, there would be as much as twice the money involved. 
Believe me, I am not advocating the above because of greed. I simply need the money. So how's 'bout somebody gettin' on the stick?

Ph.ilosophy of Lafortune renovation plans 
by Ted Guth Staff Reporter 
Aftl'r months of working on the idPas. the Lal<'ortune Renovation ('ommittee recently published a summary of the philosophy and plans for the renovation. 
"W(' wrote it out to show the background of the issue. not only to give to tlw Board of Trustees when Wl' ask for money, but also to give ourselves direction, and provide sonwt hing for the students to J'(')ate to." committee chairman Kl'll Knevel commented. 
Knl'vPI also stressed the need for studPnt participation on the proposal. inviting any student with Hll'as or comments to come to the lknovation Committee's office on till' sl'C<md floor of LaFortune. 

Thl' committee's report em­phasizes the need for a student cl'ntl'l' as a focal place for university life. and charges that 
I.a Fortune presently does not meet this twed. 
The report recommended that tlw present center be renovated, ratlwr than a new center built. Such a renovation would be dwaper and quicker, and Lal'ortune's central location and 

long  tradition  provide  it  with  
1rl'ml'ndous  potential  for  
dPvelopment.  

FivP guidelines were proposed for t lw renovalion of the center. First. the committee stated that

Yesterday's nuns led a cloistered 
life. When they ventured out, it 
was two-by-two. Their roles were 
traditional and within church in­
stitutions. 
Things have changed. The world. 
The Church. The roles women 
play. 
Yet for one order, these changes are hardly apparent. Ever since the Dominican Sisters of the Sick Poor were founded in 1876, they have been engaged in pastoral ministry. They have always been flexible, Always self-motivated. Always had freedom. Why? By the very nature of their work. 
TheDominican Sisters oftheSick. Poor give free nursing care to the needy in their own homes. They travel alone by bus or bysubway. Or by car. Or on foot. And their day doesn't end at five o'clock. 
Each case presents a different problem; whether it is bringing physical or spiritual comfort. keeping a family together, coun­seling or bridging the gap be­tween social agencies, we bring the love and devotion of Christ. We are in direct contact with the people we care for. 
You see, we don't have to be lib­
erated. We are.

Computerized exam schedule 
by Terry Keeney Staff Reporter 

The Office of Registrar has computerized the final exam schedule for the first time. The .new schedule, released the week before Spring Break, will be adopted this semester to insure a conflict-free schedule for studeflts. 
tinder the old system pxaminations were scheduled according to class days and times, with the exception of departmental txams. This system permitted student conflicts between departmental and class exams. 
Mark Carmichael, Assistant Hegistrar. explained that the computer would eliminate such conflicts. 
"The computer takes everyone's dass cards and determines what kind of a linep-up there will be without student conflicts," he said. 
Because the system is new, Carmichale. observed there are still problems to be worked out, and students may be required to make certain adjustments. Because the computer determines dates and times of final exams on a random basis, it is likely that more Pxams will be given on the last day of finals than under the present system. Previously the Registrar had scheduled few exams for the last day of finals . 

The computer could conceivably schedule a student for three or four exams in a single day. Carmichael emphasized that in such cases adjustments could be made for the individual student. In addition, exams will be scheduled on the Saturday of finals week. 
Although the new scheduling 
procedure would eliminate student 
conflicts, teachers could possibly 
be assigned to more than one class 
at a time. 
Rick Sullivan, University 
Hegistrar, views the new exam 
procedure as a "test-run" for next 
fall semester when the final exam 
period will be shortened from the 
current six days to five. 
"We are preparing ourselves for 
the abbreviated exam schedule 
next fall. With the Provost urging 
the faculty to give more finals and 
the exam week being shortened, the computer alvne can guarantee a conflict-free system," Sullivan remarked. 
Sullivan pointed out that the new computerized procedure may not be used every semester. He doubted that computerized scheduling would be necessary during the spring semester because scheduling is more flexible in the spring. Sullivan anticipated that the new exam schedule would prove useful for future fall semesters. 
Although the old system is more economical. Sullivan stressed that e fonflict-free system as was the 
Although the old system is more economical. Sullivan stressed that a conflict-free system was the "lulimate schedule". 
Thus far both Sullivan and Carmichael have expressed their pleasure with the operation of the new exam schedule. According to Carmichael, because of the computerized schedulin, "it is very possible to go down to a five-day exam period next year with no difficulty." 
Norling speaks in Carroll tonight 
Dr. Bernard Norling, Assistant C'hariman of the History Depart­ment. University of Notre Dame, will speak on "The Place of the Nineteenth Century in Modern History" at 8:00 p.m., tonight in Carroll Hall. SMC. 
"What I propose to do," explains Norling, "is consider whether the Nneteenth Century, an unusually peaceful and 'progressive' age, was a harbingedr of the future or merely an exceptionally happy interlude in the general course of Western history." 
According to Norling, the world 
slipped back into more familiar 
patterns. such as absolutism in 
governmoot, following the end of 
the Nineteenth Century. 
"However-Norling states,' 
"the rise ot ''l<Kious forms of 
totalitarianism anti1W.Jch else that 
has developed in the Twentieth 
Century raises the Cfllestion of 
whether the Nineteenth Century 
might have been itself a rare 
'Golden Age' destined to be as 
unlike succeeding centuries as it 
was unlike its predecessors." 
Dr. Norlin holds both an M.A. 

and a Ph.D. in History from the the Thomas Madden Award for University of Notre Dame. He has Best Teacher of Freshmen at published two books, Towards a Notre Dame, and has been a Better Understanding of History member of the American and Timeless Problems in History, Historical Association, Catholic plus several articles and reviews. Historical Association, and Mid­Dr. Norling was the recipient of W<'St Council on British Studie~. 
Science Foundation grants 
The Natior.ai Science Foun­dation <NSFl has announced an award of $331,500 to the University of Notre Dame to support students ~: udying for doctoral degrees iR 
~ciC'nce.  mathematics  all'd  
engineering  during  the 19~-74  
academic year.  

This grant represents the final group of NSF graduate traineeships. whi<;Kwere dropped in President Nixon's proposed budget. 
This represents .. the continuing downward trend of dwindling public support for higher <'ducation. based on the misper­ception that we are producing too many doctoral students in all disciplines. This may be true of some disciplines but to generalize beyond these few is to jeopardize the future of the nation." said Dr. Hobert Gordon, vice-president for <dvanced studies. 
Nationally, the final grant will provide $4.8 million to support 911 doctoral level students at 172 in­stitutions in all the states and the Pistrict of Columbia. The awards provide stipends of $2,250 for students during the 1973-74 academic year. 
Notre Dame's award will go 
towards continuing support for 13 
current graduate students. The 
grant does not provide for any new 
traineeships.

Item: Fourteen men were named to the All Tournament team and half of them were from un­beaten Tulsa--the Irish lost eight games but still placed five all­stars... 
Item: Only 19 players went on the trip, eight of them pitchers--by the closing day, leading hitter Dick Nussbaum, catcher Bob Roemer, and cleanup man Ed Lange were all watching from the sidelines while coach Kline was forced to the bullpen for substitutes ... 
Obviously the Irish were dealt very few aces, yet they managed to stay close in eight of the ten con­tests. Says Captain Roemer, "We were playing in a rough league and injuries killed us. We've got two weeks before our home opener with Hillsdale <April 3rd doubleheader) , and that's plenty of time for everyone to be ready.'' 
"We got a lot of experience in Tulsa, and it brought our team together," the Dolton, Ill. senior adds. "We made the NCAAs in '70 after we were 1-11, and we'll come back and do it this year."

Invitational Tournament. 
DeCicco honored 
less than four innings. Roemer led 
the onslaught with the first home 
run of his varsity career, a three­
run shot to right that sent Cheney 
to the showers. 
Lange powered a line drive 

homer to dead center and knocked 
in three runs, Mark Schmitz had a 
pair of RBI singles, Ken Schuster 
doubled home two runs, and 
Pete Schmidt and Tom Hansen 
each collected three hits to pace 
ND on offense. 
Senior Mike Riddelll limited the 

Titans to just five hits in a dazzling 
performance. The Highland, Ca. 
ace struck out five and issued only 
two walks. 
Tulsa 7, ND 1 
Denny StanfQrd 's three-run 

homer turned a close ball game 
into a Hurricane win. Forget that 
round tripper, and Rick Eich 
would have been in a 1-1 sixth 
inning duel with TU star Tom 
Widmar. 
An error and back-to-back 

singles by .Nussbaum .and Hansen 
got the only Irish score off Wid­
mar. who won his 13th straight 
over two seasons. 
Tulsa 16, ND 4 

It was one of those days when Kline's Korps would have been perfect for an Alka-Seltzer ad. The Hurricane could do no wrong, chipping pop fly hits between Irish defenders and turning harmless grounders into unearned runs. In fact, frosh hurler Mitch Stoltz went four and one third innings, allowed 11 TU scores, yet left the game with a 0.00 ERA! 
Nussbaum's single, an error, and Lange's sacrifice fly got a run in the first, then the Irish added three more in the fourth via an RBI safety by Nussbaum and Hansen's two-run triple. 
Oral Roberts 7, ND 6 

Two errors and four RBis by Titan shortstop Tommy Thompson gave ORU a 7-0 edge after an in­ning and a half, but Notre Dame bounced back with five second session runs on assorted hits by Lange, Roemer, Bob Stratta, and Howard Wood. 
The Irish cut the deficit to one on Pete Schmidt's sixth inning single, but couldn't notch that lucky seventh score, stranding men at third three times in the last five frames. 
Tulsa 8, ND 6 

Richard Rogers' two-run homer coupled with Irish errors for a 4-0 Hurricane lead after three. Again Notre Dame rallied, though, as Roemer and Jim Smith delivered run-scoring singles in the fourth. 
Back-to-back triples by Schmitz and Roemer chased starter Jerry Simmons in the fifth, and soph Tom Miller followed with an infield hit that put ND ahead, 6-4. Yet, Tulsa wouldn't crack as All­American Jerry Tabb doubled home one run and outfielder Mark Reinke tripled for two more an inning later. 
ND 2, New Mexico State 0 
Mitch Stoltz fired a four-hit 

whitewash in his first starting 
performance while receiving 
errorless defense. The freshman 
fanned seven and allowed only one 
Aggie base runner as far as third 
base in seven innings. 
Converted basketballer Hansen 

got the big hit. Smith's single and 
a hit batsman put two runners on in 
the third. Howard Wood moved 
them up on a bunt, and the "T­
Hird" followed with a line shot 
safety to right that won it. 
Tulsa 4, ND 0 

Hurricane righty Mardie Cornejo bested Riddell in a Friday afternoon pitcher's duel. Cornejo held the Irish to just two hits, consecutive singles by Riddell and Smith in the sixth, and whiffed five for his first victory. 
Arkansas 6. ND 5 

Greg Snowden's fourth hit of the game, an eighth inning, two-out double, ended an extra session battle between southpaws Eich and Larry Paulsen; but the play that saved the Razorbacks came an inning earlier. 
The Irish led, 5-4, with two out and runners at second and third. Jim Smith ripped a Paulsen of­fering that had RBI written all over it, but shortstop Bruce Mitchell leaped high to rob Smith and kill the rally. Let that ball go through, and Arkansas would have needed three do-or-die ·runs to tie it, instead of the one they got. 
Notre Dame had leads of 1-o, 3-2, and 5-4. but the Hogs hung tough and tied it everytime. Eich doubled home the first run in the second, singles by Schuster, Miller. and Schmidt got two more in the fifth and Wood delivered a bases-loaded safety good for two sixth frame scores. 
New Mexico State 4, ND I 

Errors again foiled the Irish, with junior Kevin Fanning wat­ching a pair of miscues turn into State's winning runs. Fanning whiffed seven and scattered six hits. but Aggie ace Dan Hardin did better. letting just one ND runner get to third, while striking out eight. 
Tulsa 14, ND 1 

Rick Ritschel four-hit Kline's Korps as the Hurricane finished with a clean sweep of the Irish. Mark Schmitz' sacrifice fly nicked Hitshel for his first earned run in twelve innings. 
Consolation came with the an­nouncement of the all-tournament team. Riddell, Roemer, and third baseman Hansen led the balloting at their positions, and Nussbaum and Lange were named to the squad as utility men.

The Notre Dame sailing team journeyed to New York last weekend to sail in the Admiral Moore Intersectional Regatta at New York Maritime. Facing some stiff competition from the East Coast, Notre Dame came on strong against the 12 school fleet which included tflree schools ranked in national coHegiate sailing's top 10. 
The regatta got off to a slow start Saturday morning because of fog and inc.reasing wind. Will J>oneland skippered for Notre I>ame in the A division, with Rob Gaw crewing for him. The first race was a gear-buster, and S('Veral boats experienced break­downs or ~psized into the frigid water of lthe East River, at the mouth oi:'~e Long Island Sound.

Notre Dame Fencing Coach 
Michael DeCicco has been selected 
for induction to the Helms Hall of 
I<'allie for his outstanding con­
tributions to his sport. 
"q'his comes as a pleasant 
surprise," DeCicco admits. "It's 
an honor I've always dreamed 
about but thought I'd have to be at 
I he end of my career to receive." 
DeCicco will serve as manager for the United States represen­tative to the World Universtity Games in Moscow this summer as he did in 1970.
