INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER SERVING NOTRE DAME AND SAINT MARY'S 
Forum: New clhild care facility ne~eded 
By TRACY CRINION 
News Writer 
A new child care facility is needed at Notre Dame to meet the demands of students, fac­ulty and staff, said graduate student Reynold Nesiba at a fo­rum last night. 
Although many use the Uni­versity-supported Early Child­hood Development Center (ECDC) located at Saint Mary's College, space is limited and expensive. 
Groups like the subcommittee on child care at Notre Dame and quality of life committee are addressing the need for an additional day care facility on Notre Dame campus, according to Sister Kathleen Cannon, chair of the subcommittee. 
Nesiba said that another day care option on campus is nec­essary because it is "good Catholic social policy to support families." Cannon said that it is in the University's Catholic heritage to build family strength. 
Construction of a new center at Notre Dame would cost $1.5 million, much of which would come from fundraisers. 
Cannon said the provost rec­ognizes the need for quality day care, but a new center depends on liability, quality employees and clients able to pay the cost of care. 
The price of day care at the present ECDC is approximately $75 per week per child, but the committee is discussing a "sliding fee" program that would determine tuition based on family income. 
The University offers a 35 percent "scholarship" for graduate students of Notre Dame whose children are en­rolled at the center. While there is scholarship money available for the staff of Saint Mary's children at the Center, there are insufficient funds to offer a tuition reduction to the staff of Notre Dame. 
As a result of cost and lack of space, graduate students and staff in need of day care must seek it in the South Bend com­munity. 
One graduate student family found an idnal mother's helper by adverti~:ing in the South Bend Tribune. South Bend's reputation in child care is full of tragedy due to careless acci­

and the fact armour is anagmg ltor definitely no longer in fashion, has all but disappeared. What woman has not dreamt o being the Disney princess swept off her feet into the arms of her chain-mailed man? What man does not yearn to test his masculinity by just once trying on a suit of armour? Alas, despite our wildest dreams, suit armour is out of mass production and one cannot park a horse in D-2 without a permit. The still-evolving place of women in our society is obviously freeing, and changing, them. Although blame cannot be placed on a particular sex for failed marriages, since women have restarted the engines of upward mobility, their independence, the notion of "family" has changed in life, reflected in TV, from June and Ward Cleaver to Murphy Brown. As a result of this, and other culturally ingrained notions, it can be expected that more and more people will forego formal marriage for common-law marriage. With over fifty percent of marriages failing, serial monogamy will some day be the norm. There are still some, the "old fashioned," that hope for something different. Dan Quayle may 'ust be an amiable incompetent, but his Murphy Brown comment was just his affirmation o what he knows as "traditional," and no offense to single mothers was intended. We benefit by the extinction of the chivalrous creature in that we are free of "responsibility" or "accountability" to the opposite gender. It is acceptable for women to ask men on dates; men are not "socially obliged" to pay for said dates; and women are freed of the oppression o having to go where she is taken. Men neither need not open doors for women, a task they can obviously complete themselves, nor are women required to play the role o sweet and docile. And, thank God, men do not have to do that "lay the jacket over the puddle" routine. How should men treat women in the this age of resurgent feminism? Should a women feel patronized if a man opens a door for her? Is he being nice or saying ''I'm a man and I think, although I'm not sure, it's my duty as a man to open this door for you?" Should a women go out of her way to open a door for herself, to say "I don't need a masculine figure to open this door?" Opening a door shouldn't be so confusing, but this is the grey area men are facing today; however, women have to do the great career/friends//family balancing act, which can be far from easy. Woe betide the one who speaks of chivalry in the face of the era of political correctness. Sad too, is the person who drops the ball while 'uggling. Although chivalry is dead, let us hope we can weather the storm of confusion that is sex relations in this decade without losing our sanity.

WORLD Yugoslavia agrees to pull some troops 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -Serbia-domi­nated Yugoslavia agreed Wednesday to pull its army from a strategic peninsula in Croatia by Oct. 20 and said it would enter talks on recognizing Croatia, a former Yugoslav republic. Britain's Lord Owen said the agreement reached in Geneva between presidents Dobrica Cosic of Yugoslavia and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia represented a significant step along the hard road to peace. Diplomats trying to end ethnic fighting in former Yugoslav republics said earlier that relief flights to Sarajevo, the besieged capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, could resume by the weekend. Serb gunners ringing Sarajevo held back artillery barrages early Wednesday in one of the quietest nights of the 6-month-old siege. 
NATIONAL Distiller responsible for girl's death

"I think the message will be to put warning labels on their product so people will know that alcohol is lethal and to educate and advertise about their product, that it is lethal," Joyce Brune said after the verdict Tuesday. Brune's daughter, 18-year-old Marie Brinkmeyer, was found dead in her Texas A&I University dormitory room in 1983. According to testimony, she drank one shot after another of Pepe Lopez tequila at a party the night before.

Girl seeks divorce from parents 
DETROIT-A juvenile judge today granted a man temporary custody of his 13-year-old niece while the girl seeks a legal separation from her mother and stepfather, who is awaiting trial on charges that he sexually abused her. Inspired by a recent Florida case in which a 12­year-old boy won a court battle to legally separate from his parents, the girl hopes a "divorce" from her mother will open the way for her uncle and aunt to adopt her. Juvenile Judge James Lacey today granted the couple custody pending the outcome of criminal sexual conduct charges against the stepfather, who is due to go on trial Nov. 19. Lacey also is considering a petition filed by the state Department of Social Services to make the girl a temporary ward of the court. 
Employee of bookstore files charges

Nicole Stuller, 17, said she considered the magazine offensive and the fact that a superior told her to read it amounted to harassment. The written complaint, which she filed with her superior, comes a month after Navy personnel were required to attend seminars at the academy and elsewhere to rid the Navy of attitudes that led to the Tailhook scandal in which women were forced through a gantlet of drunken aviators at a convention. "It wasn't a touchy thing. It wasn't a verbal thing. But through the eight hours of sexual harassment class, I learned that it is sexual harassment," Stuller said.

Minority engineering sets up new mentoring program 
By BEVIN KOVALIK News Writer 
The Minority Engineering Program has implemented a mentoring program which will match minority engineering students with a faculty member who will guide each student in his or her field of interest, ac­cording to Joy Vann, program director. 
Engineering has not been a field in which many minority students participate, on any college campus, Vann said. "The mentoring program will be set up to help minority stu­dents take advantage and to maximize the opportunities al­ready available to them.» 
"The purpose of the program is to increase the retention of minority students and their overall experience in the engi­neering program, and to en­courage minority students to take a look at graduate schools,"she said. 
Vann added that the program will also aid minority students in getting their degree in either engineering, architecture, or geological science. 
The faculty mentors will also help students feel like more of a part of the college and help them to understand the stan­dards which they need to meet, she said. 
The Minority Engineering Program will have an initial 
meeting today at 4 p.m. in room 118 DeBartolo to introduce the participants to the purpose of the mentoring program and the semester agenda, according to Vann. 
Speaking at the meeting will be Sheila Scott, promoting pro­gram consultant from Eastern Michigan University, who will give a presentation to the mentors and student proteges on an effective and beneficial mentoring relationship Vann said. 
"Presently we have thirty­three minority participants who will each be linked with faculty members in their respective fields, "she said. Two profes­sionals from the community who work for Bendix Automo­tive will also participate as mentors, she added. 
Upperclassmen are looking forward to the program be­cause they will be working with professors they know, Vann said, but the freshman have been a bit hesitant because the program is something new. 
A similar campus-wide mi­nority program was attempted two years ago but proved un­successful not because of a lack of participation, but because the program was not followed up by the Minority Student Affairs Office, according to Vann.

SMC hosts annual c~reer fair t<;>day 
By KIM ST. CLAIR 
News Writer 

Saint Mary's College is hosting their annual career fair today, Showcase of Careers 92', in Le Mans Hall lobby from 3 to 5p.m. 
The Showcase offers stu­dents a chance to discover full­time, part-time and summer jobs, internships, and volunteer opportunities from 65 or­ganizations in corporate, gov­ernment, education, non-profit, volunteer, and graduate school settings. 
A few organizations that will be present are: Leo Burnett Advertising, the FBI, Eastman Kodak, AT&T, and Northwest­ern University's Medill School of Journalism. 
Jeff Roberts, coordinator of Placement Services at Saint Mary's, views the career fair as the first major opportunity for students to use the skills that the Counseling and Career De­velopment Center has taught them. 
The center provides educa­tional programs, research centers, and support for stu­dents searching for jobs. 
"We specialize in teaching people how to place themselves and use our influence to give them opportunities to use these skills," said Roberts. 
Roberts also encourages students to form their own networks by participating in programs like the Senior Dad's Career Networking Forum. 
"Our students are very well prepared to conduct job searches,» said Roberts. 
Bill Cash, director of Institu­tional Research at Saint Mary's, said 78 percent to 83 percent of graduates are employed within a year of graduation, while 16 percent to 20 percent attend graduate school. Of those em­ployed, 92 percent to 96 per­cent are employed by Decem­ber, according to a survey con­ducted of 1988-1991 graduates 9-12 months after graduation. 
The Showcase of Careers 92' is sponsored by Student Gov­ernment Association; Senior, Junior and Sophomore Class Councils; and the Counseling and Career Development Cen­ter. Everyone is invited to par­ticipate, and resumes will be accepted. 
Robles: Minority children disadvantaged 
By MARA DIVIS News Writer 
Minority children have a large disadvantage today because they face racism targeted to­ward them at an early age said South Bend bilingual teacher Maritza Robles, in a lecture at Saint Mary's yesterday. 
"When I feel sad, I feel like driving to the airport and going home," said Robles, Community School Corporation bilingual education director. "Children here don't have that chance." 

Robles, a Puerto Rico native, said that she first came to the United States to do graduate work at Notre Dame. She said she had to adjust to being an Hispanic in America instead of a Puerto Rican. 
"In Puerto Rico, I'm Puerto Rican. Hispanic was a term given to us by the 1980 census." 
She said that "Hispanic" has come to mean someone who traces ancestry to Central or South America, and that now she is proud to say she shares ancestry with Mexicans and South Americans. 
However, she said that racism and prejudice is strongest on the level of children. Robles, who has adopted five Hispanic children, said that her children face prejudice daily at school. 
She related a story about how a teacher recently made a racist comment to one of her children. 
"When I adopted five kids, I never thought that the school was going to give me the hard­est time. Every day, I have to be prepared to help them keep their self-esteem intact." 
She said that this prejudice extends into her adult life. She said that there is prejudice against her both as an Hispanic and as a woman. 
"My co-workers don't see me as aspiring to be superinten­dent," she said. "We (as His­panic women) grew up to be submissive, thinking the man would take care of us. If I had stayed in Puerto Rico, I would

Human error causes nuclear plant shutdown 

Thursday, October 1 , 1992 


TOKYO (AP) -A mistaken flip of a switch by a nuclear power plant worker caused a reactor's cooling pumps to fail, a government official said Wednesday, but an emergency system took over and prevented a nuclear meltdown. 
The automatic activation of the emergency cooling system prevented radiation from being released by the plant in Fukushima prefecture, 70 miles northeast of Tokyo. 
Local officials sharply criti­cized the Tokyo Electric Power Co., the plant's owner, for not notifying residents for hours about the emergency shutdown of the 18-year-old reactor. 
"The case is very serious be­cause it triggered (the emer­gency core cooling system)," said Jinzaburo Takagi, a physi­cist who heads the Citizens' Nuclear Information Center, an anti-nuclear group. 
It was the first shutdown using the emergency system since Japan's worst nuclear accident, at Mihama in western Japan in February 1991, when a small amount of radioactivity was released into the atmosphere. 
Tuesday's accident, at the number 2 reactor of Fukushima Nuclear Plant No. 1, involved a 784-megawatt lightwater reactor, the most widely used reactor design in the world. It uses ordinary water for cooling and to moderate the flow of neutrons that split the atoms that produce nuclear reactions. 
The emergency system that went into effect at the plant is the last reliable defense against a core meltdown. The system pours cooling water onto a re­actor's nuclear fuel rods to pre­vent them from reaching dan­gerously high temperatures. 
A meltdown could occur if a reactor's rods heat to the point where their uranium fuel starts to melt and collects in a puddle on the reactor floor. A partial meltdown occurred during the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island in Middletown, Pa., on March 28, 1979, the worst commercial accident in U.S. history. 
The world's worst nuclear accident occurred on April 26, 1986, at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Soviet Ukraine. It in­volved an explosion at a graphite-block moderated reac­tor. 
Tuesday's accident was caused when a plant operator mistakenly flipped a switch. 
Clarification 

In a story in yesterday's edition, The Observer incor­rectly reported the amount of the possible fines that The Commons owner Pasquale Anastasio faces. Anastasio faces maximum fines of $500 for each minor cited in Friday's S.U.D.S. raid. The Observer regrets the error.

"Clinton's huge defense cuts would put into question our ability to fight another Desert Storm," Campbell said. 
Pattison agreed that a huge military force is no longer needed with the threat of the Soviet Union and communism gone, but stressed the need to maintain a strong military and continue to develop defense technologies in case emergen­cies arise. 

"We don't need as large a military as before," he said, 
"but there are still places like Bosnia and Somalia where a strong military force may be needed." 
"Defense cuts should be based on what is needed," O'Brien said. "Hopefully we will have smart people making smart decisions and not blindly making cuts."

Beauchamp praises University for commitment to c:ommunity service 
By PAUL PEARSON Associate News Editor 
Notre Dame would not be where it is today without its in­volvement with local commu­nity service projects, Executive Vice President Father E. William Beauchamp said Wednesday.During a President's Luncheon for local business leaders, Beauchamp praised the University's "ongoing commitment to serve the community and prepare our students to wholeheartedly and enthusiastically do so in the decades ahead." 
Beauchamp called Notre Dame's partnership with the local community "something that is integral to this Univer­sity" and something which can be traced back throughout Notre Dame's 150-year history. 
As one example of this part­nership, Beauchamp cited South Bend's Center for the

Beauchamp also mentioned the Center for Social Concerns (CSC) and its programs such as Urban Plunge, Best Buddies and the Neighborhood Study Help Program. Programs such as

Student Government committee to present education report to Board of Trustees 
By EMILY HAGE News Writer 

The Student Government Standing Committee for Un­dergraduate Education will present their report, "Upholding the Mission: Teaching and Research at a National Catholic University," to the Board of Trustees today. 
The aim of this report is to address students' concern for the quality of undergraduate education and to review the faculty, administration, and Student Government to find ways to improve them. The re­port follows last February's re­port, "Back to Basics," 
Robert Bleil, director of the speakers bureau of the commit­tee, said that the committee is optimistic. "We've become much more pointed in our reso­lutions," said Bleil, "I believe that the ideas that we've pre­sented in the report are work­able ideas." 
The committee's report says that Notre Dame is a Catholic institution for undergraduate education first: "Undergraduate excellence must be protected and graduate studies and re­search must be promoted, but neither at the cost of the other." 
The report says that to achieve its goals, the under­graduate program needs enough regular faculty to teach, especially University require­ments.

amining student, faculty, and University reports, the commit­tee found: 
"the 
need for structured teaching incentives, 

the 
need for the improve­ment of academic life both in and out of the classroom, and 

the 
need for a serious exam­ination of the undergraduate academic program." 


The report says that under­graduates are also responsible for the quality of their educa­tion at Notre Dame. They should take advantage of fac­ulty members' office hours, ad­visors, and the Hall Fellows Program. 
The report also says that the University, also, should en­courage such programs as the Hall Fellows Program. 
The committee made several recommendations: 
A 
"Center for Excellence in Teaching should be established at Notre Dame" where faculty members and graduate stu­dents could learn to improve their teaching skills. It would have a full-time director who holds a Ph.D. and has class­room teaching experience. 

A 
university-wide program for aiding graduate students with teaching methods should be established for short term needs. 

Departments 
should en­courage teaching and mentor relationships with undergradu­ates by using a Teaching Port­folio; "dedicating at least one meeting per year to teaching or holding departmental teaching 


workshops; emphasizing the importance of teaching at all stages of hiring and the tenure process; and improving un­dergraduate advising in the department." 
University, 
colleges, and/or departments should establish endowed chairs and awards based on the quality of teach­ing. 

The 
University should sup­port lecture/discussion series involving faculty of all depart­ments within the different col­leges. 

"The 
administration and Faculty Senate should voice of­ficial supports for the Hall Fel­lows and set out a series of con­crete goals and aspirations by which the residence halls may measure their success." 

The 
University should en­courage College Fellow Pro­gram in each college. "The University should not resort to the use of gates." The commit­tee defines gates as institutional barriers that limit the number of students allowed in each discipline of the University. Today, departments have no sure means of knowing how many students they will be teaching. They suggest a voucher system, in which de­partments "would be given a voucher for every student who enrolls as a major, thereby re­warding them for a number of students rather than meeting the departments by gates." 

The 
University should find short term solutions to lessen the strain of not employing enough faculty and try to hire more faculty.

Family leave veto sustained 

WASHINGTON (AP) -The House on Wednesday easily sustained President Bush's veto of a bill requiring many businesses to give their workers time off in family emergencies. Democrats pledged to redouble efforts to make "family leave" a major issue in the campaign for the White House. 
The vote on the politically charged bill was 258-169, well short of the two-thirds majority needed to override Bush. It was the 33rd consecutive time Bush has made his veto stick. 
The vote came as lawmakers rushed to wrap up their busi­ness for the year and return home to tend to their own polit­ical concerns. From legislation fixing education policy to a bill providing Israeli loan guaran­tees to a measure to move a federal air and space museum annex to Denver -nothing was too large or too small to attract the attention of lawmakers. 
In defeat on the family-leave bill, supporters said the veto would reverberate in next month's presidential election. Democrat Bill Clinton supports the measure; Bush has pro­moted "family values" as a campaign theme. 

"This issue frames this cam­paign," said Rep. Patricia Schroeder. "Yes, it really is about who is for families." 
Despite the partisan split, 42 Democrats deserted their party and voted to sustain Bush's veto. Thirty-eight Republicans voted to override the president. 
The measure was strongly opposed by lobbyists for small business. Opponents pointed to Bush's eleventh-hour alterna­tive, $500 million in tax credits for businesses that grant the unpaid leave to workers. 
"There's a better, more ef­fective way," said House Minor­ity Leader Bob Michel (R-Ill). 
The action is the second time Bush has vetoed a family leave bill and made it stick. Although he voiced support for the con­cept during his 1988 election campaign, Bush vetoed a simi­lar measure in 1990. 
The action followed an emo­tional debate in which support­ers of the bill both condemned Bush's veto as uncaring and vowed that if Clinton is elected, a tougher family leave law will be enacted next year. 
Despite the rhetoric, Bush's 
veto was sustained with room to spare. To reach the two-thirds majority needed to override, supporters would have needed to switch the votes of 27 opponents. 
The vote was on only one of several contentious issues de­cided in the press toward ad­journment. Lobbyists on a va­riety of issues filled the legisla­tive corridors, and in a typical scene, white-haired women opposing a Democratic-spon­sored education bill mingled with feminist leaders seeking votes for the family leave overide. 
The House voted overwhelm­ingly as expected to override another Bush veto of a bill that would slap conditions on re­newal next year of China's trade status with the United States. Most-favored nation status, enjoyed by China and most other U.S. trading part­ners, imparts the lowest avail­able tariffs on a country's ex­ports to America. 
The vote was 345-74, well over the two-thirds needed. Bush vetoed a similar measure previously, and attempts to override fell short in the Senate.

Hillary Clinton news coverage fans tensions 
ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) ­News coverage of Hillary Clin­ton during the presidential campaign has fanned tensions between "homemakers" and "working mothers," according to a study released Wednesday by the Freedom Forum. 
Coverage of the wife of Democratic nominee Bill Clin­ton, including reports on her political activism, was cited in a study that said "simplistic" news coverage increases dis­cord among groups in society. 
"The media appears to be­lieve, rightly or wrongly, that good news doesn't sell," said the study, conducted for Women, Men and Media, a group largely funded by the Freedom Forum. 
"Hence, its overemphasis on conflict and simplistic, stark drama -the infamous we vs. they syndrome, the 'black and white' aspects, the horse race." 
"Hillary Clinton has been the subject of a substantial amount of media ink," the report said. "Most of this has fanned the tensions between 'homemakers' and 'working mothers' -'the mommy 
wars.~ 
"There is no question that the backlash against the em­powerment of women is being exacerbated by the 1992 elec­tion campaign, in both political commercials and media cover­age," said author and lecturer Betty Friedan, co-chair of Women, Men and Media. 
The Freedom Forum de­scribes itself as an international organization dedicated to free press, free speech and free spirit. Women, Men and Media describes itself as a national research and 


Hillary Clinton 
outreach project headquartered at New York University's Department of Journalism. 
Women, Men and Media commissioned M. Junior Bridge, president of Unabridged Communications, to conduct the study. It said the opinions expressed are hers and not necessarily those of the Freedom Forum or Women, Men and Media. 
The study examined news coverage in Newsweek, Time, 
U.S. News & World Report, Chicago Tribune, Houston Chronicle, Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, USA To­day and The Washington Post. 
It said there were almost twice as many articles on Mrs. Clinton as on all of the major female candidates combined during the study period. 
Altogether, it said there were about three times as many ar­ticles on the wives of the presi­dential and vice presidential candidates as on the women who are running for office. 
"How many articles does the media run on male spouses of candidates?" the study asked. 
TV morning show campaign Politics with corn flakes in 1992 
NEW YORK (AP) -Live from New York, it's the 1992 presi­dential campaign, brought to you by Harry, Joan and Katie. 
This was American politics during one extraordinary half­hour Wednesday: President Bush, Bill Clinton and Ross Perot appearing in simultane­ous interviews on the three network television morning shows. 
Not everyone likes it, but this is the new political soapbox. 
The morning shows, along with other non-traditional polit­ical forums such as "Larry King Live" and Rush Limbaugh's radio call-in show, have been the settings for some of the most important moments of the 1992 campaign. 
At no time has that been truer than this week, when Bush is appearing three days on ABC's "Good Morning America" and Clinton is matching him with three taped appearances on NBC's "Today." 
In addition, Clinton is hitting "Good Morning America" and "CBS This Morning" and Perot is appearing on "CBS This Morning," "Today" and "Larry King Live." 
And late Wednesday, CNN announced that Bush would appear in a special Sunday edi­tion of King's show to be taped at the White House. 
So, flipping from station to station at about 7:40 a.m. Wednesday, there was Joan Lunden interviewing Bush on "Good Morning America," Katie Couric in a taped interview with Clinton on "Today" and Harry Smith with Perot on CBS. 
Some critics complain that the candidates are shunning experienced political journalists in favor of generalists who juggle politics with many other, lighter topics. 
There also has been a report -denied by his campaign ­that Bush has a list of least fa­vored broadcast journalists he avoids. 
In a speech to broadcast ex­ecutives in San Antonio last week, Leslie Stahl, a corre­spondent for CBS' "60 Min­utes," said she was told Bush had blacklisted Dan Rather of CBS, Peter Jennings and George Will of ABC and Tim Russert and Bryant Gumble of NBC. 
Stahl said Tuesday that had she heard about the list from Don Hewitt, the executive pro­ducer of "60 Minutes." Hewitt confirmed that he had told her, but wouldn't divulge his own source. 
But whether or not there is such a list may be moot. It is clear that Bush in particular, and all the candidates to some extent, have been carefully se­lecting where, and by whom, they will be interviewed. 
Jack Reilly, executive pro­ducer of "Good Morning Amer­ica," said it took about a dozen telephone discussions with Bush campaign officials over several months before the president would agree to ap­pear on the show. The "Today" show has tried in vain for about a year to get Bush to appear, according to its executive producer, Jeff Zucker. 
None of this has necessarily meant that voters are seeing less of the candidates. What is new is where they are turning up, and the people by whom they are being interviewed. 
"I think there's been a real revolution in the way television covers politics this year," said Zucker. 
For example, there has been the "Larry King" syndrome: Candidates appearing on shows in which they were questioned by members of the public, ei­ther by telephone or in a studio audience. 
"This preoccupation with non­traditional media just shows the candidates will do anything to avoid being beaten up by Sam Donaldson," said Robert Lichter, co-director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington. 
The upside is that viewers see more of the candidates than they might otherwise. And members of the public ask more issue-oriented questions than political reporters, who can be more interested in the mechanics of politics. 
The downside is that viewers are denied the expertise of re­porters who have covered poli­tics and government for many years. Also, the call-in show format in particular discour­ages follow-up questions that are often necessary to pin down candidates on difficult issues. 
That didn't apply Wednesday morning, when none of the programs used the call-in for­mat. But they certainly pro­vided a friendlier, less con­frontational environment for candidates than they might have found on evening news shows or news conferences. 
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in political communication, refers to the morning shows as "soft news," as opposed to the "hard news" evening news broadcasts. 
Bush proposals get tough on 'deadbeat dads· 
FOND DU LAC, Wis. (AP) ­Reaching out to women voters, President Bush on Wednesday proposed measures to get tough on "deadbeat dads" who fail to pay child support. 
In a new proposal just 34 days before the election, Bush called for penalties ranging from revoking driver's licenses to putting parents in prison in some cases for being delinquent in their child support. "Each year, $5 billion in court-ordered child support -$5 billion ­fails to reach families and kids who desperately need it," Bush said. 
The president, trailing in the polls, also taunted Democrat Bill Clinton for not accepting his challenge for four debates. 
"He waffles. I can't find him. He's lost. He's missing in action. He refuses on this issue to take a position one way or the other, just like on all these other issues," said Bush, who for weeks took political heat for refusing to consent to debates proposed by a bipartisan commission. Clinton's position is that Bush should show up for the two debates still scheduled by the commission. 
Campaigning in Wisconsin and New Jersey, Bush tried to close the ''gender gap" in which women are far more hesitant than men to support the president. 
In Newark, the president also renewed his attack on Clinton as an advocate of higher taxes and bigger government. Brushing aside Clinton's criticism of his record, Bush said the election isn't about the past "but what we're going to do in the future and our hopes for the future." 

"We have to change the American system of child sup­port, and the statistics there are not pretty," the president said. He said that in 1989, fathers were absent from 10 million families, and only a little more than half of absent parents have been ordered to pay child support. 
"And those required to pay, only half do on time and in full. And only one in five absent parents pay for children's health care." 
Bush said his plan would re­quire all states to recognize and enforce other states' child sup­port orders. 
And, he said, "We will require organizations who receive support from the Legal Services Corp. to devote 10 percent of their federal funds to helping mothers who need legal help track down a deadbeat dad. 
"And we will say to deadbeat parents who owe and haven't paid, then you're going to pay a price. You'll get no passport, no professional licenses, no hous­ing or student loans or any other help from the federal government until you do right by your children."

INSIDE BUSINESS 
The future ctf Business 
Last week, I sat next to the newsstand in LaFortune Student Center and looked at which section people turned to first when they picked up a newspaper. Not surprisingly, most people read the front page or the sports section first. Not one person that I saw even turned to the business page. 
It is unfortunate that most Americans don't realize how important business is, whether it be the president's fiscal policy or the status of the local steel mill. When the presidential candidates emphasize investment or discuss the North American Free Trade Agreement, sadly enough only a small minority of the population understands the issues at hand. 
Business is the heartbeat of every society's in­frastructure. In terms of supporting our personal interests, local business is just as important as national economics and finance. This is why it is crucial to put more emphasis on campw; busi­ness issues and events. 
That is why The Observer is implementing changes to the business page to allow it to reach its potential by appealing to the readers' inter­ests. 
As of next week the business page will be running on Tuesdays and Fridays. Fridays we will run a guest column by students studying business or professors in the business school, or editorials on economic issues by interested students or organizations like The Heritage Foundation, The Brookings Institute or Indiana Policy Review. 
Each day, we will run business news briefs from prior days and a report on the most active trading and volume leaders among the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stoek Ex­change. We also plan to track Dow Jones over each week. 
The Observer plans to increase its coverage of campus business news, also. With so many cam­pus business clubs and societies, it would be a great benefit to our readers to inform them cam­pus news. 
All these ideas are the result of input from The Observer staff and others in the surrounding community. If you have any suggestions on how we could further improve the business page do not hesitate to call or write us.

Ford Motor Co. to reduce CFC's 
DEARBORN, Mich. -Ford Motor Co. plans to cut 90 percent -or 7 million pounds -· of the chloroflurocarbons (CFCs) it uses in its worldwide manufacturing processes by the end of 1992, the automaker announced Tuesday. Ford also an­nounced Tuesday that it will re-engineer its car and truck air conditioning systems to operate on a CFC-free refrigerant so that all new 1994 models will have CFC-free air conditioning systems. The company's new Mark VIII, scheduled to debut in December, will use a CFC-free airconditioning system. Ford's worldwide CFC phase out program brought praise from the Environmental Protection Agency, which awarded Ford its 1992 Stratospheric Ozone Protection Award on Tues­day. 
Sale of houses jumps in August 
WASHINGTON-Housing sales jumped 10.4 percent in August, to a seasonally adjusted an­nual rate of 1.24 million, the first increase in three months. But analysts said new construction would level off and cited a 1.6 percent decline in applications for building permits. The lowe1· rates also failed to boost sales of previously owned homes in August. They fell 3.2 percent, to a sea­sonally adjusted annual rate of 3.34 milli(]n, the fourth drop in five months, according to the Na­tional Association of Realtors. The Realtors at­tributed the decline to "consumer uneas:lness" over the persistent economic sluggish­ness.Regionally, sales plunged 19.5 percent in the West, to a 140,000 seasonally adjusted annual rate.

Representatives of the Baxter company and Ernst &Young firm came together to discuss the differences between working in the private sector versus the public sector. 
"This was a great, rare opportunity for students to compare and question a combined public and corporate panel explaining these firms' operations and future goals," said Dave Beliveau, president of Notre Dame Accounting Association. 
"Keep your eyes open and think of where you want to be," stated Cindy Shafer, manager of corporate consolidation at Baxter. 
Shafer was employed with PriceWaterhouse for six years before switching to Baxter. According to her, entering into the auditing field seemed to be the right start after college. Viewing different settings gave her the clues she needed to tell which "which I could fit into and which to avoid". 
According to Shafer, changing to Baxter was the right decision because of the company's diverse subsidiaries and variety in job possibilities. 
"I wanted first-hand exposure of Baxter so I chose going into corporate auditing," said Shafer. 
Having many job choices at Baxter is not surprising, according to Debbie Basak, financial associate in corporate auditing for Baxter. 
Baxter is the largest health care product and services company in the 
world.  As  a  $  9  billion  dollar  
company,  $7  billion  is  grossed  
domestically.  

Students beginning at Baxter usually enter into FDP (financial development program), according to Basak. During the first two years a rotation system is set up so that

David Beliveau 
people can get exposure to different jobs. 
For instance, corporate functions one can step into include cost accounting and financial reporting, said Basak. Corporate reporting allowed her to understand Baxter stock and Wall Street business. 
Entry-level possibilities include corporate consulting and corporate tax, but one does not have to be in the United States to build up experience. 
"An international rotation exists where you could go to Mexico, Canada, Spain or England to name a few," said Basak. 
Being in corporate auditing has allowed Basak to travel in­ternationally to countries such as Italy and view divisions of Baxter. 
"We are always dying for people to go overseas," said Doug Ingram, part of a tax and financial services group at Ernst & Young. But according to Ingram, at Baxter employees need a couple of years experience before going out internationally. 
After two years in the program, entry-level people can interview for any desired job opening. 
"I really enjoyed that it continually moves and changes...but it was all nitty gritty auditing in the begin-
LANSING, Mich. (AP) -Workers at a General Motors plant in Lansing were back on the job today, a day after voting to settle a four-day walkout. 
GM spokeswoman Linda Cook said all of the plant's first-shift employees had reported for work and "we are building cars right now." Cook said there were no reported worker protests, and GM also expected other shift workers to report for regular duty today. 
United Auto Workers Local 602 voted 60 percent to 40 percent Tuesday night to return to the line today, ending the second walkout this month against the No. 1 automaker. 
But under the agreement, UAW members at the plant will vote Dec. 1 on a key issue in the dispute ­whether to take breaks all at once, as GM proposes. 
"We don't consider that GM's going to win on this," said Jim Sickles, a UAW International representative. Sickles said 2,383 workers voted. 
The agreement allows some 7,200 workers to return to their jobs. That includes about 4,200 striking workers and 3,000 others at an affected Lansing chassis plant that completes assembly of the popular Pontiac GrandAm. 
GM's desire to have all workers take breaks at once sparked the Lansing dispute. The breaks would have let GM eliminate the jobs of 300 to 350 workers who relieved front-line operators during their rotating breaks. 
But GM said through a spokeswoman that regardless of how the workers ultimately decide to take their breaks, about 550 plant jobs will still be lost. 
GM plans to cut production at the plant due to lower car sales, and when it does jobs will be cut, said the spokeswoman, Linda Cook. 
Members of Local 602 also had 
complained that some health, safety 
and work standards at the plant 
violated their agreement. 
Workers walked off the job Friday at the Lansing plant, which makes the outer body of the Grand Am, GM's second best-selling car, and two other models. 
The auto giant, paralyzed by an earlier strike against its Lordstown, Ohio plant, remains dogged by labor troubles in Indiana. Another potentially disruptive strike is brewing at a factory in Anderson, Ind. 
A strike there could cripple GM production systemwide because the plant supplies more than 95 percent of all exterior lighting, except for headlamps, to GM car and truck assembly plants in North America. 
UAW Local 663 earlier this month asked the union for a required letter informing the company a strike could occur in five days. No letter had been issued as of Tuesday, said Karl Mantyla, a UAW spokesman in Detroit. 
ning," said Wayne Ebersberger, accounting manager at Ernst & Young. 
As a 1976 Notre Dame graduate, Ebersberger said he did not know much coming out but he learned quickly. Ernst & Young also have different levels that new employees can test. 
As for earning a masters degree, Ebersberger points out that employees do not necessarily need one. There is no glass ceiling and the most important thing an employee can do is devote one's best talents to going as far as one can, according to Ebersberger. 
"Some of my friends started simultaneously on their masters and their job but I don't believe that is the way to go," said Doug Ingram. Employees should get a couple of years under their belt before apply­ing for a specific masters program. Knowing what field one wants to specialize in is important, according to Ingram. 
A May 1991 Notre Dame graduate, Ingram said that there are many different levels employees can choose from. Those include insurance, manufacturing, consumer, personal financial planning and health care divisions. 
In the end, students have to go with their own feelings on which sector they would want to begin working. "1 am a recruiter but I am not going to sway you one way. It is your decision," said Tom McCabe, a 1987 Notre Dame graduate working for Baxter. 
The forum which was held in the Hayes-Healy auditorium was sponsored by the Notre Dame Accounting Association and Beta Alpha Psi, the accounting society.

Pro-lifers' actions rather mild 
The uncivil behavior of some pro-lifers during Gov. Clinton's Notre Dame speech has aroused justified disapproval if the alleged behavior occurred. 
Nevertheless, those who be­lieve a little intemperate heck­ling impeaches the pro-life po­sition might want to reconsider lest the same standard force them to reject other, more po­litically correct views. 
For the NO pro-lifers' ex­cesses were negligible com­pared to the war on free speech successfully waged on other campuses in the name of a va­riety of left-wing causes. Con­sider these examples: 
 Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Jeane Kirk­patrick, when invited to the University of California at Berkeley to deliver their pres­tigious Jefferson Lectures, was virtually prevented from doing so. 
Demonstrators in death masks heckled and screamed at her throughout her remarks, rendering most of her comments unintelligible. 
A similar fate awaited her both at the University of Min­nesota when the Hubert Humphrey Institute brought her to campus as a guest lecturer, and then again at the University of Washington. 
Moreover, organized left-wing lobbying on many campuses has repeatedly resulted in the revocation of Kirkpatrick's invitation to spea~. 
 At Northwestern University in 1985, Nicaraguan Contra

leader Adolfo Calero was scheduled to deliver a public lecture. 
A large group of protestors, led by an English professor, prevented the audience from hearing Calero's remarks. 
The professor mounted the stage and announced, "We are not going to let him speak... he should feel lucky to get out of here alive." 
When a student protestor threw fake blood at Calero, se­curity personnel escorted him from the building. 
 More recently, university administrators have been ex­ercising a prior restraint on po­litically incorrect speakers, e.g., the University of Illinois and Edwin Meese. 
A conservative student there, Celeste Ann Lawson, arranged for Meese to address the cam­pus. 
Subsequently, however, campus radicals manifested their furious disapproval, upon which the administration in­formed Lawson that Meese constituted an "attractive nui­sance." 
She and her fellow conservative students, as spon­sors of this "nuisance," were advised they must raise sub­stantial funds for additional se­curity before the former United States Attorney General would be allowed on campus. 
In the face of Lawson's calls to the governor and other state officials, the university adminis­tration backed down. 
Nevertheless, that the Uni­versity of Illinois and other uni­versity administrations (at Hamilton College and George­town) have rewarded leftist threats of violence with official attempts to prohibit conserva­tive speakers on campus-in the name of security-should appall civil libertarians of every politi­cal stripe. 
 Finally, supporters of the choice to kill the unborn have demonstrated far worse behav­ior than anything imputed to NO pro-lifers. 
For instance, last spring prominent pro-life activist Joe Scheidler was to speak at Indi­ana University. But when he began his remarks, shrieking and chanting students threw objects at him, such as spit­balls; at least one charged the podium. 
Only minutes into his re­marks, nervous university administrators had security remove Scheidler from what had become an angry, frenzied mob. 
The overwhelming evidence, then, is that when it comes to assaults on free speech, pro-lif­ers (and others holding politi­cally incorrect views) are venial sinners, and more often sinned against than sinning.

Meadow, Chapter One. 
Maybe it was the illogical illumination of rhetorical lightning or the deafening crash of political thunder that awoke young Meadow, disturbing the dreamy, bud­dhahood silence of the cool, but stormy and restless Election Year night. 
Of course, Meadow would've never taken the rap for his own awakening nightmares ... at least, not in the last decade of the 20th century, when people had to look no farther than 'Vtother Nature or Father Time to blame their troubles upon. 
People could lay guilt out on anybody or anything, from the limousine liberals to the Cadillac conservatives, the ice­t's or guns or roses, Republicans, Democrats, or maybe even Libertarians (whoever the hell they were). environmentalists or Realtors, and more than likely, parents. 
Why, even Meadow was surely at fault for something or the other, could be that his long locks of unkept hair and greasy flannel shirts had decayed the traditional family values of a nation, inciited riots in the low rent districts of Los Angeles, or blocked the path to the Great American Dream. 
Who would've known? Surely not Meadow, who only wanted to step outside his mind, walk around a nearby lake, and brave the acidic rains of the Election Year night, trying to forget the national mess while getting onward with pleasant dreams of, perhaps, some electoral college, far, far, away. 
The problem for Meadow, poor politically defeated Meadow, was that he really couldn't waJk away from things, no matter how hard he tried, especially not in the last decade of the 20th century. 
"It's like the White House has become s orne sorta weird discount liquor store, pandering to wrinkled ol' winos who beg through missing teeth for just one more gulp of cheap promises and false hopes," Meadow thought aloud as he turned the corner along the lake's tree-lined path. 
"Believe it or not, the place is doing pretty good business too, 'cuz they've been the only suppliers around for the past 12 years. People have just become too damn afraid to go across the street and try out the new guys in town." 
"Granted, they could easily be a coupla travelling salesmen, quacks, ex-flower children in two-piece suits who are just passing through after they dodged thfl draft and tried to inhale, although they didn't 
It's A Dogma Eat Dogma World

have the heart and lungs to hold it in, and maybe they still don't today." 
"Their catch, however, is that they're selling to the youth generation something they wanna call 'change,' sounds nice, but sounds familiar, echoes the cranked up silence I've heard for years, days, and nights, nights spent walking this lake with ..." 
"Fantasia, the beauty of youth and the spirit of innocence whom I clung so tightly to my side while declaring to her certain undefinable love things." 
"I remember the one night I bravely looked into her sad eyes and summoned the courage to tell her, 'I'm pregnant, you know,' but all she could do was laugh at my joke, rub her belly, and reply, 'Well, I'll help pay for the abortion."' 
"It angered me back then, and it still makes me wanna spit today. Yet, the only thing I said to her was, 'I don't think Rodney King is an urban prophet. I think Pat Buchannan is a walking and (regretfully) talking polyester right-wing beast. I don't like it when the press calls someone a 'tax and spend liberal,' and I certainly don't enjoy visits to the dentist, 'cuz it's annoying to have someone prying into the private parts of my mouth while telling me that Lou should have gone for the win."' 

"That stuff ticks me off, but it's nothing compared to the humiliation a woman must go through when giving up the gift of life at some dime a dozen clinic, walking past obnoxious human chains of protest that call her a 'baby murderer' when she really is just a lost child of God confused in the frenzied chaos of the last decade of the 20th century." 
"I believe in the only choice being life, but I'll be damned if I'd know what to do if I had to choose, 'cuz the first and only thing I'd think of would be, 'Dear Lord, help me see the 
light.... "Oh well, Fantasia is gone now. She ran away with the travelling salesmen and left me here, 18 years old, and about to vote for the first time in my life. It'd be alright too, if I could listen to these crazy, madcat 
political platforms being offered, but I can't. I'm a citizen, I have the right to not 
listen. I have the right to watch some completely goofy cam­paign add and yell, "What?" 
"It's hard to sit here and try, really try to absorb stuff about change here, and things should remain the same here, and we've all gotta group together and do something to compete with them guys over there. It's fourth down and ten in America, and I really just wanna punt." 
Then, without any particular reason in mind (as if there needed to be one) Meadow kicked his left foot into the air and broke into a slow jog. One foot swiftly followed the other, and then the steps became faster. Suddenly, Meadow had broken into a full trot, and then a gallup, and then into a regular hell-raising, full-speed sprint. 
He jumped over a fence, and into the yard of a nearby seminary running wildly up the hill and through a dark woods that opened into a luscious, green field. His heart pumped, his legs ached, and his mouth was as dry as a five day old martini made from bathtub gin. 
Meadow was shaken, not stirred, and running running until all he felt was the wind rushing through his veins, the rains stinging his chest, and the earth tearing apart beneath his feet, while the stormy skies above displayed an awesome firmament that screamed out, "Turn 'round, son, we's all gotta carry the weight of the world." 
Meadow stopped dead in his tracks, for it was the loudest, most melodious thing he'd ever heard. The message had a good beat, something he could dance to (if need be), and it revealed to him the foundations of a true democracy: you can't run away from things, especially not in the last decade of the 20th century; you gotta dodge the rhetorical lightning, 'cuz the political thunder usually is sure to follow; and in the entire vast expanse of the universe, there could not be a better feeling than running bare foot through wet grass in the middle of a stormy Election Year night.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Leprosy sufferE~r asks for help 
Dear Editor: 
I am Paula C. Lidora, one of the unfortunate beings afflicted with leprosy and outcast in this far away isolated leper island. 
We are people created to suf­fer the curse of destiny because this disease eats up our flesh little by little, mercilessly de­forming every part of our body until we find ourselves bedrid­den, totally invalid, just await­ing our death. 
It is indeed sad and miserable to have this futile life, not even having the chance to see our children grow, truly sad that because of this disease, I am too bedridden and handicappedto earn a living to support and take care of five young children as my husband died long ago due to this dreadful malady. 
I cry and my heart aches whenever these children ask me for their food and dire needs, yet I have nothing to 
spare even for my most needed medicines. 
Seeing your address in an old paper, my last humble thought inspired me to write you with my sincere faith and hope that you are kind and compassionate to share with us a little space in your paper, and through you, be our way to reach the generous hearts of your people so that we can knock at the door of their mer­ciful heart~: for some help in our deplorable sad life as we con­tinue to wallow in the abject poverty and sufferings. 
The recent disaster and mis­fortunes made more miserable and unbearable our predica­ment here, making life a horri­ble nightmare. In this regard, we plead for your mercy for some help you can share with us, some of your excess food, old clothes, and some financial aid to help for our dire need and most needed medicines. 
We would gratefully accept any gifts of love you can share with us to help lighten our sad poverty-stricken life and ease our sufferings. 
You and your kindness is our only remaining hope, and we pray and confide in your Chris­tian love and mercy that you will not deny us your helping hands and a share in your abundant blessings. 
With our prayers to the Lord that He touches your hearts to reopen to us in mercy and compassion, we shall be deeply grateful to hear from you soon. 
May our Lord's blessings be showered a hundredfold to you and your family circle.

'Bad rap' from alurnni not justified 
Dear Editor: 
As a proud undergraduate of at Notre Dame I am sick and tired of the 'bad rap' the student body is receiving. 
In two Viewpoint letters (The Observer, Sept. 23) alumni have taken it upon themselves to bash the ND student body. 
In response to Costello, class of 1992 (F--Michigan)--lighten up a little bit. No one I know takes any T-shirt they wear se­riously. My roommate wore one such T-shirt (which he changed to "the shirt" before entering the stadium) in the midst of four friends of mine from the University of Michigan. 
Regardless of this "offensive" act, at the end of their stay they expressed their shock at how unbelievably well they had been treated by all the domers they met at ND tailgaters earlier that day. It appears that our student body is not "ignorant of common decency." 
Furthermore, Monhan, class of 1986), were you at the game? In the student section? I imagine not. Were you there you would have heard a jubilant outburst when the players decided to salute the student section, as is Notre Dame tradition. I, being in the very midst of 9,000 student students, heard not one boo. 
Maybe you and your fellow alumni should get off your high horse and realize that even though you have graduated, the Notre Dame community re­mains the spirited, proud and Christian place it was when you left.

Comments on Clinton's visit were inaccurate 
Dear Editor: 
I write in response to Bill Keen's letter to the editor (The Observer, Sept. 28) regarding the visit of Presidential nominee Bill Clinton. Keen, the president of the University Right-to-Life Organization, made some very unfair and inaccurate statements about Clinton's visit. 
First, Keen spoke of an inci­dent in which a Clinton aid de­manded that he put away the Blessed Image of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Having the privi­lege of sitting two rows directly in front of Keen at Clinton's speech, I observed that he was only told to stop protesting after he had yelled several times, interrupting Clinton's speech, as well as shaken a rubber chicken in some obscure refer­ence to Clinton's draft record and thrown out postcards with graphic pictures of aborted fe­tuses. 
Also, by standing during the presentation, he rudely im­peded the view of those behind him that had waited in a line for possibly several hours to see Clinton talk. 
Keen wrote in his letter that "Bill Clinton cares nothing for today's mothers and their un­born children." I believe this statement to be blatantly inac­curate ... if this was true, why does Clinton support the Family Leave bill which allows women maternity leave from their jobs without penalty? 
Abortion is perhaps the most sensitive and difficult issue of our times. 
But we should not forget that it was not so long ago that George Bush was a pro-choice supporter. 
I believe that abortion will never be· decided until Amer­ica's ideas about condom distri­bution in schools and sex edu­cation are consistent. Conser­vatives have fought against mandatory sex education for years, but I believe this educa­tion is the only way to fight the spread of STD's and more im­portantly stop the number of unwanted pregnancies in the United States. 
There is no doubt in my mind that abortion is wrong, but outlawing abortion tomorrow is unfortunately not going to stop women from having abortions. We must educate people on sex and sex-related issues and, once society is aware of prevention methods, abortion will be stopped on lits own-the time will come for abortion to be outlawed. 
I am one of the many students on the campus that are both pro-life and pro-Clinton. The time has come where the country cannot stand another four years of Republican regime-economic collapse is far too close. All we can do is pray for a day when education becomes accessible to all so the crime of abortion ends.

Shopping showdown 
'Shop 'Til You Drop, will feature two Notre Dame students 
By MELISSA COMER 
Accent Writer 
The football field is not the only place where some of America's greatest college rivalries are meeting this week. Tomorrow evening the Catholics will take on the Convicts in an entirely different game. 
Lifetime Television's game show "Shop 'Til You Drop," hosted by Pat Finn, is featuring "College Shopper's Bowl Week" all this week. Pitting traditional rivals such as Ohio State and University of Michigan and Harvard and University of Pennsylvania, the game show brings oldtime competition to a new field. 
The game show, scheduled to air tomorrow evening, features a rivalry which is close to the hearts of many Notre Dame fans. Notre Dame students Tom Lear, class of '92, and Jeannie Shin, a junior who is currently studying in London, meet the University of Miami's team to compete for prizes ranging from toasters to a trip to Paris. 
Challenged to "Shop 'Til You Drop," the contestants must employ consumer knowledge and an ability to do charadelike stunts. 
Last year, Lifetime Television came to South Bend to recruit students for the show. According to Tom Lear, an advertisement in The Observer offering a free trip to Hollywood brought one of the largest turnouts from any school to try out for the show. Lear and Shin were one of twenty five couples who auditioned for a spot on the program. 
When asked about his particular interest in trying out, Lear, nicknamed "TV Tom,"responded, ''I've always wanted to be on a game show. I figured why not try it?" 


At the auditions held in the Gipper Lounge of the local Holiday Inn, the students took a quiz testing their consumer knowledge. Given only the product name, auditioners were asked to determine what the product actually was. 
Next, the students were asked to perform a few stunts similar to those that they would have to do on the show. It seems their sheer enthusiasm won it for them. Lear explains, "Jeannie had to spell a word letter by letter using her body. She misspelled it to begin with. I think that's why we got on the show. 
Volunteer lair projects service alter college 
By JENNIFER GUERIN 
Assistant Accent Editor 
Notre Dame is one of few schools in the country to have a center dedicated specifically to aiding students who choose to integrate volunteer work into their lives. Approximately eight years ago, the Center began to extend their support to graduat­ing seniors in the form of a post-graduate volunteer fair. The effort has met with phe­nomenal success. 
Since its inception, the fair has become a magnet for 
recruiters  in  volunteer  
programs  throughout  the  
country.  

According to Mary Ann Roe­mer, director of senior pro­grams at the C.S.C., approxi­mately 150 to 200 seniors from Notre Dame decide to pursue volunteer work after graduation each year. 
"I have a feeling even more people do service work on their own," said Roemer. For those choosing to make use of con­tacts through the University, however, the Center can open hundreds of channels for na­tional and international service opportunities. 

Roemer, who organizes the post-graduate fair each fall and the volunteer send-off each May, believes that many stu­dents at the University tend to­ward service work after college because they have been ex­posed to it by their families, high schools, and clubs at Notre Dame. 
She considers the post­graduate fair a stepping stone for implementing service work into long-term plans: "It's a great way to begin to really integrate service into your life," she affirmed. 
College students throughout the country have continuously found something attractive in the prospect of service work, but recruiters consider Notre Dame a unique and unusual place to attract volunteers, Roemer concluded. 
"The primary purpose of the Center [for Social Concerns] is to help people integrate justice and faith in their lives," she said. Consequently, Notre Dame students often have experience in service projects from their undergraduate involvement with the Center. Recruiters, in turn, have found that students from the University have been very committed to their endeavors. 
All students, regardless of year and experience, are en­couraged to explore the possi­bilities at tonight's volunteer fair. "I really want them to feel welcome," said Roemer of the student body. 
Over 400 people have at­tended the fair annually, using the personal contact with re­cruiters to find out more spe­cific information about interest­ing programs. 
Domestic service programs at the post-graduate fair tradi­tionally last for one year, while programs outside the United States-which usually involve substantial language and cul­tural adjustments-often span over a period of 18 months or more. 
According to Roemer, the most popular programs consis­tently have been those oriented towards teaching. Students who feel attracted to these pro­grams but have not majored in education in their undergrad­uate years should not feel dis­couraged. 
"A few programs are really competitive," said Roemer, but most of the teaching programs 
Once chosen to appear on the show, Lear and Shin were flown to Hollywood for the taping in April. According to Lear, "They treated us like royalty. Anything we wanted, all we had to do was ask. If we weren't smiling, they asked us why we weren't. They needed us smiling for the camera." 
For the first part of the show, Shin shot balls into a bucket using Lear as a "backboard." With each ball worth $5, the two were challenged to match the price of a product with the number of balls in the bucket. 
That done, Lear and Shin were given twelve pictures of different characters and were asked to identify the characters as either real or fictional. Required to get nine of the twelve right, Lear claims,"There were some on there that we had never heard of before. We barely made it." 
Their consumer and general knowledge was tested further in a quiz round where they were asked entertainment and consumer product trivia questions. 
Beating the Miami team by one question, Lear and Shin headed onto the "Shopper's Challenge." The entire studio acted as a "mall" with eight different stores, each specializing in different products from electronics to sporting goods. 
Given six boxes, Lear and Shin opened each to discover the gift inside it. Based on their judgement of the value of a particular gift, they then had to "keep or exchange the six gifts with gifts in the eight stores so that the retail value was $1000 or more," explained Lear. 
Now, for those of you who will not be able to watch the show and are dying to know the outcome, Lear and Shin reached the $1000 goal by the fourth box and won the grand prize trip for two for a week in Paris. 
According to Lear, "We had won more money on the show than anyone else." Winning prizes such as luggage, artwork, a fishing rod, an espresso maker, a boom box, a weekend for two in Chicago, a week in Paris and more, the two reached a total of over $9000 in prizes. 
To see the Catholics once again victorious over the Convicts, tune in to Lifetime this Friday, October 2 at 5:30 p.m. 

do not require certification prior to application: the will and commitment of volunteers is often the crucial factor in re­cruiters' decision to accept post-grads. 
Holy Cross Associates, spon­sored by the Holy Cross priests of Notre Dame, draws the ma­jority of its volunteers from Notre Dame and other Holy Cross-affiliated universities in the country. 
The HCA programs consist of one-year positions at a variety of service-related organizations in cities across the United States. Volunteers for these programs live in a community and regard their year of service as a faith-strengthening expe­rience. 
Mary Sue Twohy, a volunteer for the Red Cloud Volunteer Program on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, worked as a coach and teacher for high school students. 
In a recent article, Towhy ad­vised college seniors. "As you prepare your post-graduate plan, in the midst of a recession that is not hiring many people, consider the volunteer experi­ence. I have found it an adven­ture challenging me to grow, to look at life from a different per­spective and to open my heart in ways unimaginable. 
The fair will take place tonight from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. in the large classroom at the Center for Social Concerns.

CAMPUS MINiffiRY... 
Staff members of campus ministry have been discussing ways in which we might be of assistance and service to gay and lesbian members of the Notre Dame community. All of us who have been part of these conversations agree that there is a significant pastoral need which continues to exist on our campus. I believe there are three dimensions to our concern. 
First, it is important for us to express clearly the teaching of the Catholic Church in this area of sexual ethics. Secondly, we know harassment of gay and lesbian people has to be denounced as behavior which is inappropriate and contrary to the teaching of Christ. And finally, we want to find ways we can extend an open and sensitive welcome to gay and lesbian students. 
It is important for us to develop a pastoral policy that is compatible with the teaching of the Catholic Church. The position of the Church is straightforward. All men and women are called to live chaste lives, whether we are heterosexual or homosexual, and celibacy is required of all who are not married. By the way we live out our commitments, we can help one another if our lives are strong and consistent statements of what we believe. 
Most people commit themselves to marriage and family life. A growing number of Christians live their lives as single people. Still others commit themselves to service of God's people through a life of permanent and consecrated celibacy in the priesthood and religious life. 
For all of us, regardless of our state of life, genital activity can take place only in the context of marriage, under circumstances which respect the rights and responsibilities of both partners whose love for each other is open to the possibility of creating new life. 
Each of us is a unique, extraordinary and distinctive individual, called to life by a loving God, heirs of the reign proclaimed by Jesus Christ, and brothers and sisters on a common journey back to the God who created us in love. In the words of Paul, we are in Christ, neither slave nor free, neither gentile nor Jew, but one in the love of Christ. 
There are a lot of reasons why people engage in harassment, but it is usually directed at someone who is different from us. From a faith perspective, harassment of gays and lesbians, or anyone else, whether intentional or thoughtless, whether through cruel jokes or in idle conversation, is simply unacceptable. Negative judgments we pass on others are almost always the result of inexcusable ignorance or inadmissible intolerance. The pain we cause is obviously harmful to the other person, whether that is our intention or not. Overcoming this prejudice is not an easy step to take, but it is an essential one if we are to call ourselves Christian. 
Finally, a word to the gay and lesbian members of our campus community, and to those who are uncertain about their sexual orientation. Campus ministry wants to be a place where you can find assistance and

Maddux gets 20tl'1l victory 
CHICAGO (AP) -Greg Mad­dux no longer has to wonder what it would feel like to be a 20-game winner. 
Maddux, who had come close twice before, finally did it Wednesday by scattering seven hits to lead the Chicago Cubs to a 6-0 victory over the Pitts­burgh Pirates. 
"That question was getting old, and now I don't have to think about it anymore," Mad­dux said. "It was a good day. We needed the win badly. Wilkie (Rick Wilkins) called a good game. The defense was super and we scored some runs. Now, all I'm going to do is go out and celebrate." 
Maddux turned down a $27.5 million, five-year offer from the Cubs at the All-Star break and is eligible for free agency fol­lowing the season. 
"I haven't made up my mind on free agency," he said. ''I'm not closing any doors by any means." 
Chicago stopped a season­worst, eight-game losing streak and also ended a six-game winning streak by the Pirates, who clinched their third straight NL East title on Sunday. 
Maddux (20-11) pitched his fourth shutout and ninth com­plete game, joining Atlanta's Tom Glavine as the only 20­game winners in the NL. Mad­dux, who struck out nine and walked two, became a 20-game winner for the first time. He won 19 games in 1989 and 18 in 1988. 
Ryne Sandberg had four sin­gles and scored three runs for the Cubs. Handy Tomlin (14-9) gave up five runs and seven hits in five-plus innings. 
"Nobody wants to go out and get beat," Pirates manager Jim Leyland said, "but you have to admire the way he did it. That was vintage Maddux. He was fantastic. He makes the plays he has to make." 
Mark Grace's RBI single put the Cubs ahead in the first, and Chicago cb ased Tomlin with four runs in the sixth. Grace doubled in a run, Luis Salazar hit a two-run triple and Rick Wilkins singled in a run off Bob Walk. 
Andre Dawson's RBI ground­out increased the lead to six runs in the seventh. 
Pittsburgh loaded the bases in the third, but Maddux retired Mike La Valliere on a flyout to end the inning. Maddux struck out Jay Bell .md Andy Van Slyke with two outs in the fifth, and struck out Bell with runners on second and third in the seventh. 
Van Slyke bad two hits, raising his total to 197 and his batting average to .~127 in the four-way race for the NL title. The Pirates are off Thursday. 

The Observer 
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) Bart Conley was too good to keep on Purdue's bench. 
"When the season began, I figured since I only weighed about 210 they'd probably be redshirting me," said the 6­foot-4 freshman linebacker from Cincinnati. 
Not a chance. 
His performance in preseason drills was impressive, and last week he made his first colle­giate start against Notre Dame. 
"Bart Conley is going to be a good one. He looks like one of the freshmen who can even­tually turn our program around," said coach Jim Col­letto. 
Conley, whose father, John, played on Purdue's 1967 Rose Bowl team, showed why he should become a fixture in the Boilermakers' lineup for the rest of his career. He led the team with 16 tackles, including nine solos and two for losses. 
The performance was espe­cially impressive for a freshman making his first start because it came at Notre Dame Stadium against one of the nation's top teams, Colletto said. 

NBC, which telecast the game, selected Conley as the Purdue player of the game. 
"He's going to get a lot bigger. He's just got a great tem­perament for playing. He's kind of a wise-guy type of guy; that's what you like in a linebacker," Colletto said. "He's a smart guy. He does a good job at school. He hustles, he plays reckless. He's the kind of guy that we like to have." 
Conley, who found it a little unsettling to make his first start at Notre Dame, said his ability to get to the ball is his main asset. 
"That was unreal. I can't re­ally explain the feeling I had there. Having grown up in Cincinnati, I know all about the Irish program," he said. "I was nervous but once the game began, that was all behind me." 
Like his teammates, Conley has felt peaks and valleys as Purdue opened with a 41-14

upset of then-nationally ranked California before being upset 33-29 by Toledo of the Mid­American Conference and then being overpowered by Notre Dame 48-0. 
"This program is definitely on the upswing," said Conley, who hopes to help the Boilermakers post their first winning season since 1984 this year. "The sea­son is starting over again with the Big Ten season. We've got to open with a victory and go from there. We all feel we can be a part of restoring success in football here." 
It wasn't hard to persuade Conley to join the Boilermakers, he said. 
"Since my father played here on the Rose Bowl team, I've kind of been a Purdue fan my whole life. There weren't even any other schools I seriously considered," Conley said. "My dad's been an active fan. He doesn't miss a game. Before I came here, he'd watch games on television and he'd often bring me to the games.... It's always been my dream to come to Purdue. I got the opportunity to come here and now my dream is to help it become a winner again." 
He has no regrets about not being redshirted. 
"I definitely wanted to play this year," he said. "A lot of people told me that since I was so skinny this year that I'd be better off if I was redshirted and had a chance to grow."

Lankford leads Cards sweep 
ST. LOUIS (AP) -Ray Lank­ford singled in the winning run with one out in the 11th innings as St. Louis beat Montreal 3-2 to complete a three-game sweep. 
It was the second straight ex­tra-inning game for the Cardi­nals and their 26th of the sea­son, one short of the league record shared by the 1943 Boston Braves and the 196 7 Los Angeles Dodgers. 
Stan Royer led off the 11th with a single off Jeff Fassero (8­
7) and pinch-runner Bernard Gilkey advanced on a sacrifice. Ozzie Smith was intentionally walked before Lankford's hit scored Gilkey without a play. 
Bryn Smith (4-2) worked two scoreless innings for the victory. 
Astros 5, Padres 4 
HOUSTON -Eric Anthony hit a pair of two-run homers as Houston beat San Diego in its final at-bat for the second consecutive game. 
Anthony, who leads the Astros with 19 homers, cut San Diego's lead to 4-2 with a homer in the fourth and added the game­winner in the eighth. 
The Astros have a five-game winning streak.

Cowboys form plan of attack 

Walker gives the Eagles a consistent running game. Yet, Randall Cunningham is still the focal point. In fact, Herschel helps their offensive line because the defense can't tee off on Randall expecting him to throw." 
Johnson, naturally, wouldn't disclose the Cowboys defensive scheme but it will be an intri­cate one because the team has had two weeks to figure out a defensive chess game to stop Cunningham. 
"His scrambling can really get to a defense," Johnson said. "You have him stopped then he gets away." 
Asked if he would try the "spy" route Johnson said "we've got to keep changing our defense up. We can't use any one thing and be totally ef­fective against a great player like Cunningham. We'll try a bunch of different looks to keep him off balance." 
Cunningham has completed 1,394 yards worth of passes for 11 touchdowns against the Cowboys. 
The Dallas players are wor­ried about Cunningham's im­provisations. 
"He can mess up a lot of really good game plans and preparations," said defensive back Issiac Holt. "I've seen him do it to us. " 
"He's the quickest thing I've ever seen," said Dallas defen­sive tackle Russell Maryland. "He's like tackling quicksilver." 
Johnson also said it was an unhappy day for him when Walker went to Philadelphia as a free agent. 
"I was not a happy coach when he signed with the Ea­gles," Johnson said. "I had hoped he would go to the AFC. He helps their football team. Philadelphia was already a top

Tepper has waited far too long 
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) -Illi­nois coach Lou Tepper has been looking forward to coaching a big conference game since 1978. He gets his chance Saturday when the Illini open the Big Ten season at Min­nesota. 
"When I was at Virginia Tech (1978-83) we longed to have a conference where every game was important," Tepper said at his Tuesday media lunch. 
'That's the way everybody feels about it. Minnesota's at 0­3, but they can finish 8-3 and go to the Rose Bowl just like ev­erybody else. It's a new start." 
Illinois finished 2-1 in the non­conference schedule, beating Northern Illinois and Missouri and stumbling through a 31-13 loss at Houston on Sept. 19. 
Tepper said the two weeks ofT since then will allow a young defense to continue to learn and the offense to rest a few banged-up players. 
"I've always appreciated the time off before Big Ten play," Tepper said. "This open week is a good demarcation between

where we've been and where we're going." So far, the Illinois defense is ahead of expectations. 
Led by sophomore linebacker Dana Howard and freshman end Simeon Rice, Illinois is third in the conference in total defense, allowing 317.7 yards per game. Illinois is allowing a league-low 14 first downs per game. 
Howard, suspended from the Houston game for his presence at a campus fight, will return to action against Minnesota. 
Rice, a 6-foot-5, 225-pound pass rush specialist, has four sacks and five tackles for loss, tying him for second in the Big Ten in both categories. 
He and his teammates will do their best Saturday to contain Minnesota quarterback Mar­que! Fleetwood, who leads the nation in total offense with 
349.0 yards per game. 
"This is the most complete quarterback we have faced so far,'' Tepper said. "His legs can win a game, his arm can win a game. He's truly a remarkable

Pangborn canw together for a 
player." 

The Illinois offense and quar­terback Jason Verduzco, who has been playing with a sore shoulder, are out to regain con­sistency after a subpar showing against Houston. Verduzco is the fourth-rated passer in the Big Ten. 
The Illini have hurt them­selves with penalties. On their 20 offensive drives without a penalty they have scored seven touchdowns and two field goals. In their 17 drives with a penalty or turnover they have just two touchdowns. 
"The pieces are there for us to be a good offense," Tepper said. "We need our receivers to be more productive. I guess that's where we are right now." 
Tight end Ken Dilger, pro­jected as a starter in non-con­ference play, was scheduled to return from a knee injury this week. But he injured his other knee Saturday, had surgery on Monday and is expected to miss four more weeks.

Friendly rivalry of 
Holtz and Walsh 
makes game special 
Forget Saturday's contest between Stanford and Notre Dame on the field. Focus your attention to the battle shaping up on the sidelines between two of football's premier coaches. 
The Cardinal's Bill Walsh and Lou Holtz of the Fighting Irish will meet for the first time ever as adversaries on opposing sidelines. 
Holtz reputation as a coaching wizard is well-documented in this area, but the stories of Walsh's ingenious coaching may be foreign to some. 
His three Super Bowls and seven National Football Conference playoff appearances as head coach the San Francisco Forty-Niners says enough, but Walsh had a greater impact on the league then his own success. 
Along with his assistants, Walsh revolutionized offensive football in the NFL. shifting the trend from dominating ground attacks to controlled short passing schemes. 
Walsh is also regarded as a master at eva! uating talent. His ability to find marquee players such as Joe Montana and Tim McKyer in the later rounds of the draft were instrumental in building San Francisco into the team of the eighties. 
At their weekly press conference, Holtz and Walsh spoke of each other with the utmost respect. 
"Our players are going to have to play hard, because if this game is won on the sidelines, it's not going to be on our sidelines," Holtz said. 
"He's a great gameday coach. He always makes the right decisions and utilizes the clock," commented the Stanford coach. 
Neither coach should get the opportunity to build on their immense reputations Saturday. Notre Dame is more experienced and more talented. But, as we all know too well., that doesn't assure a victory {see Michigan game). If the Cardinal is able to hang with the Irish, hold on to you Richter scales. The brain waves will shake the stadium. 
The biggest chess match ever held at Notre Dame will boast the biggest of prises. Bowl invitations, and possible national championships linger in the balance. But, the biggest reward of all is for the victor of the coaching battle. 
The win will reap benefits in the form of recruits, rewards, and most significantly, respect. Secretly the two coaches must acknowledge this game as an opportunity to boost their images and solidify their reputations. 
Saturday marks the first time in both men's careers that they enter a game knowing they could coach the finest game of their lives and still be out­coached. 
The game will put immense strain on both field generals. Walsh will pace the sidelines an increased rate, and Holtz will go to his knees more often to pick the blades of grass which seem to settle his nervousness. 
The game itself is important, but it is Holtz vs. Walsh which makes the game a rivalry.

BY HEATHER WILEY Sports Writer 
Breen-Phillips' and Walsh's interhall football teams renewed their rivalry on Sunday, with BP managing a close win over Walsh 12­0 with two big plays, one in their second drive of the game, and the second coming late in the last half. 
"BP had a really good defense and they just sort of shut down our offense completely. It was a close game," said Walsh captain Laura LaVigne. Walsh's defense was tough as well, allowing BP little yardage with the exception of the two scoring drives. 
The next set of interhall football games will be played on Sunday, October 4. Walsh will play Pangborn at 7 p.m. BP's game will be at 9 
p.m. against Lyons. 
Siegfried 19, PE 13 
The Siegfried Slammers, under leadership from quarterback Marcie McNiel, squeezed by the PE Pyros in overtime last Sunday. 
The game was tied with a minute left in the game with the Slammers having possession of the ball when PE defensive end Alison Martin inter­cepted an errant pass, giving PE an eleventh-hour chance to win. But the Pyros, could not convert, and in the overtime period the Slammers scored a touchdown and then secured the win with an interception. 
Siegfried's next match will be Sunday against Farley at 8 p.m., and PE will face Knott at 4. 
Off-Campus12, Howard 0 
Off-Campus shut out Howard Hall last Sunday with two touchdown passes in the second half. Howard's defense played strong, as the teams remained scoreless at the half. 
But in addition to big runs turned in by Agnes Taylor and the defensive efforts of Kerry Norton, quarterback Marianne Haggerty managed to connect twice with wide receiver Theresa Forst to down Howard. 
"It felt really strange to play against Howard, because four of us are from Howard. We were playing against our own dorm, but it was a good game even though it felt weird," said Forst, "They're a good team." 
Howard has a bye this Sunday, and Off-Campus will be facing Badin at 5 p.m. 
PW 6, Farley 0 
Two strong defenses dominated this low-scoring game between the Weasels and Farley's Finest. On the last play of the second half, Junior Bridget Graham scored the only touchdown of the game on a pass from the Weasel's junior quarterback Bethany Riddle. 
Farley's offense kept the ball moving throughout the game, but due to strong defensive play from Kathleen Glines, Megan Butler, Kiev Vu, and Kristen Herring, PW's defense stopped the Finest's efforts on two key fourth down plays to hold Farley scoreless. 
Farley's offensive line showed great improvement and defensive players Linda Keefe and Gretchen Ganc both had strong games with Ganc pulling in an interception. 
Pasquerilla West will play Lewis at 6 p.m. next Sunday, and Farley's next game will be against Siegfried at 8 p.m.

Special to The Observer 
Notre Dame's top two runners at this weekend's National Catholic Invitational, sophomore Sarah Riley and junior Mike McWilliams, were named MCC Players­of-the-Week in women's and men's cross country. 
Riley edged Loyola junior Julie Keller, the defending MCC champion. and lrd the Irish to the team title. Riley completed the five-kilometer course in 17:56.9, less than two seconds ahead of runnerup Keller. After the two leaders, the next five runners were from Notre Dame as the Irish tallied 19 points to finish ahead of runnerup St. Thomas, who had 99. 
Riley played a pivitol role on the team as a freshman a year ago, but has blossomed this season after a rigorous summer of training. Riley also led the Irish harriers in their first dual meet of the year against Georgetown. Along with last year's top runner, Eva Flood, and Stefanic Jensen, Becky Alfieri and Emily Husted, Riley leads the Irish's impressive sophomore class. 
All-America McWilliams also led the sixth-ranked Irish men's team to the National Catholics title. McWilliams fin­ished the five-mile course on the Burke Memorial Golf Course in 25:02.5, less than a second ahead of teammate Nate Ruder. 
The Irish captured the top four spots in the race and added a ninth-place finish for 19 points, far ahead of the 61-point effort by runnerup Marquette. 
McWilliams is one of the nation's best collegiate cross-country runners, as he is a two-time All-American and was just the eighth American finisher at last year's NCAA meet in Tuscon, Arizona. He has led the Irish in both meets this season and figures to pace the squad all year long as the Irish try to erase last year's disappointing NCAA snub and regain the form that led them to a third­place finish in the NCAA's two years ago. 
McWilliams and senior All-American John Coyle comprise the core of this year's team.

In their first regatta of the .season, both the 
.men and women's.varsity crew teams placed at the Head of the Ohio in Pittsburgh last weekend. 
The women's lightweight four placed second behind Miami of Ohio, in an impressive show of hard work and determination. But even that might not have been enough if it hadn't been for coxswain Trkia Starr. 
"We probably would not have medaled without the help of her intensity," said stroke Tricia Cody."She kept us going." 
Meanwhile, with more than forty crews competing { including M.l.T;. Brown and several Canadian crews), the women's lightweight eight rowed their way into second place behind Ohio State. 
"I was more than happy with our performances this weekend," said women's varsity coach Maureen Kibelstis. "I think this is a clear indication of what we can achieve this season." 
Both the men's lightweight four and eight teams' placings last weekend were needed starts to a tough season. 
The mens' lightweight eight ranked third behind Brock University and Cornell University. 
"We're pleased. This gives us the confidence to face tho many challenges that lie ahead,~ said men's varsity coach Bill Webb. 
The men's lightweight four also gave Webb cause to be pleased. Although Cornell University placed first, the Irish were able to place third. 
"The Ohio served as a litmus test for the team," said Reeder, president of the Notre Dame rowing club. "The Head of Charles is a mile longer, and the competition is going to be tougher than the Head of Ohio's -which means more intense practices."
