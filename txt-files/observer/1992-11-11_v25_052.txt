Bush's new budget sees no changes 
WASHINGTON (AP) -In a departure from recent outgoing presidents, President Bush will submit a bare-bones federal budget in January that will seek no new tax or spending changes, administration and congressional officials said Tuesday. 
Instead, the unusually brief document will summarize what fiscal policy has looked like during the Bush administration and simply project what the 1994 budget would look like without any of the changes President-elect Clinton is cer­tain to make. Fiscal 1994 be­gins next Oct. 1. 
"There's just no reason to make a political statement," said a White House Office of Management and Budget aide who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We've basically decided to put the numbers to­gether and tee the ball up for Clinton." 
Despite that disclaimer, the document may be more politi­cal than described. 
By laying out his final mea­surement of how the economy is performing and how it is af­fecting federal tax collections and spending, Bush will be establishing a benchmark to which Clinton's later spending

Bosnia's warring factions sign unconditional cease-fire agreement 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herze­govina (AP) -Bosnia's warring factions signed an uncon­ditional cease-fire covering the entire republic Tuesday, but it was uncertain whether all had the will or means to end months of bloodletting. 
Also Tuesday, the Red Cross evacuated about a third of the estimated 6,000 people -Mus­lims, Croats and Serbs -who have been trying to abandon Sarajevo. The agreement on a Bosnian cease-fire, which was to go into effect at midnight Wednesday, was reached during negotiations among military commanders who have been meeting for two weeks at the Sarajevo airport on a plan to demilitarize the capital. 
Several long-term trends ar­gue for an end to the fighting in Bosnia. These include the ap­proach of winter, increasing economic problems and diplo­belled after Muslims and Croats matic isolation in Serbia, and voted for independence on Feb. the military losses and lack of 29.

Thatcher may have promoted arms sales to Iraq within weeks of invasion of Kuwait 
LONDON (AP) -The gov­ernment on Tuesday an­nounced an inquiry into charges that Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet secretly promoted arms sales to Iraq until within weeks of Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. 
The furor erupted after three executives of Iraqi-owned Ma­trix Churchill Corp. were ac­quitted Monday of selling arms­making machine tools to Iraq between 1988 and 1990, in vio­lation of an arms embargo. 
Prosecutors dropped the charges after former Trade Minister Alan Clark acknowl­edged that the government had encouraged the exports. A Bri­tish secret service agent testi­fied that Matrix Churchill's former managing director, Paul Henderson, had been a spy for MI6, the external intelligence agency. 
The opposition has charged that Thatcher knew of the arms sales and that the government was prepared to let Henderson and two other businessmen go to jail to cover up intelligence activities. 
In a statement after the trial, Henderson's lawyer said Hen­derson had been told by Clark in 1988 that British and U.S. policy were coordinated, and that Henderson had no doubt the information he provided was shared with the CIA and available to the White House. 
Testimony at the trial also indicated the United States would have known about the sales. 
U.S. Congressional critics have charged that the Bush administration was aware Iraq was getting Western help in rearming after the Iran-Iraq war but did nothing to stop it. 

"There have been some ex­traordinary stories about this matter," Prime Minister .John Major told the House of Com­mons on Tuesday. "I agree they must be clarified beyond any measure of doubt." 
The sales, worth more than $37 million, took place when Thatcher was prime minister. Major, then a Cabinet minister, succeeded her in November 1990, shortly before the Gulf War allies launched air strikes to drive Iraq from Kuwait. 
The Matrix Churchill debacle comes less than a week after Major's government nearly col­lapsed in a parliamentary battle over a European treaty, and adds to the misery of a gov­ernment already in deep trou­ble over the economy. 
"Thus a government widely seen as incompetent now stands accused of corruption,"

INSIDE COLUMN 
There is pain on both ends of hateful 'views' 
Lately my phone has been ringing. Unfortu­nately it has not been the long awaited knight in shinning armor. Instead, my frequent phone caller is a close-minded, unlov­ing racist claiming me to be a "token black" for the university (in harsher -------­words, unfit for publication}. 
Then of course there's this neo-nazi man who blames the Jewish-Americans for the problems in our nation. Okay, whatever. 
It's incredible that such people still exists; sur­prising no, but incredible yes. Almost to the point of being intriguing. Where do these people come from? What has been their life experience? Where ever or what ever it was, I'm sorry for them. 
It's disheartening to hear of another person hurting so much inside, that they must resort to placing the pain on some else. Someone different from them. Not better nor worse; simply different. 
It's hard being a minority, being it Mrican­American, Hispanic-American, Jewish­American, female, disabled, or homosexual. The varieties of minorities in this country are nearly infinite. And each one has been subjected to cruel, unjust treatment. 
The saddest part? That it's not over, that in all reality; it will never be over. It may not be as blatant, but it's always as painful. 
Painful to know that no matter what scores one receives or grades one acquires, if a mi­nority, that person will still be seen a just that, a minority; 
Painful to know that no matter what position one earns or successful heights one reaches, if a minority, that person will still be seen a just that, a minority. 
Because somewhere along the way, more than once, that minority will sense resistance to them simply because of their physical traits. 
Should The Observer have printed that filth­ridden article last Thursday? That shouldn't be the issue. What people should be outraged about is the man's ideas. Believe it or not, there are students right here at Notre Dame who do not believe racism exists. It does people, it does. 
What good would have been done if Viewpoint had trashed the letter? The racist ideas, once again, would have been swept under the rug for no one to see. That's not the way, if any, to rid the unfounded prejudices that remain in our world. 
It can't be denied. Racism still exists. It may not be as public as it was "back in the day, n but it sure hasn't gone away. The evidence is in Rodney King and his jurors; the evidence is in the recent guest columnist; the evidence is on television, in the stores, and in our schools. The evidence is everywhere. 
So for my faceless caller, and the faceless columnist, and for all those out there who carry prejudices against others, may you realize that we are all beautiful creations of God. As God's creatures, we are taught to love and be loved. We are taught to follow Jesus in his divinity. 
And essentially we are all tokens; precious to­kens of God.

HPC to circulate petitions in dorms Clark: Liberalism cou 
By BEVIN KOVALIK News Writer 
Molly O'Neill, student body vice president, asked the Hall Presidents' Council (HPC) last night to circulate petitions throughout the dorms to make The Observer fee of $6 per semester an optional expense for students. 
The reason for the petition was to determine who is un­happy with the printing of L. Clifford Cheney's guest column in The Observer on Nov. 5, ac­cording to O'Neill. 
"I don't think that this fee should be mandatory because students should have a choice as to whether or not they want to receive The Observer, just as they can freely decide to pay for The New York Times," she said. 
"If they don't agree with the journalism being practiced," O'Neill added, "then students shouldn't have to pay for something that is inappropri­ate." 
The Observer fee is currently assessed through the Office of Student Accounts. 
"Should this go into effect, The Observer will have to fig­ure out other ways to fund the paper and to monitor distribu­tion," O'Neill said. 
"I agree 100 percent with what Molly said because this incident was not freedom of speech and it offended a lot of people," added Marianne Ravry, HPC co-chair. 
Gretchen Ganc, president of Farley Hall, said that O'Neill should not interfere with free­dom of speech by proposing an optional fee for The Observer because "whether or not a per­son chooses to read the articles in the paper is his or her own choice." 
"This is Molly's option and if she wishes to condone it, I sup­port her," said Jason Coyle, HPC co-chair. If students pay for the paper, they are owners of the paper, he said. Similarly, if someone owns stock in a company, that person would always have the option to sell it off if unhappy with it, he added. 
In other business:

money before this club came into existence. 
"I have been funding the club myself," he said. Jason Coyle, HPC co-chair, said that the budget committee would vote and make a decision. 
The AIDS awareness club is a service group that fund-raises for AIDS research and area hospices, Pepper said. "Also with the necessary funds we can establish an office so stu­dents can have somewhere to go directly for questions," he said. 
 Keenan Review producer Sam Pennington asked HPC to donate $3,000 to the Keenan Review, so organizers can make it a quality program this year and not have to cut back on souvenirs and publicity, he said. The operating budget this year for the Keenan review is $12,000, according to Penning­ton. 
HPC has funded the Keenan Review in the past and has $15,000 set aside for special activities involving three or more dorms, according to Coyle. He said the budget committee would consider the funding. 
endanger American family 
By CORA SANDBERG News Writer 
The philosophy of liberalism endangers the American family, Ann Clark said last night in a panel discussion at Saint Mary's focusing on contemporary issues of the American family. 
Clark, chair of the philosophy department, spoke on "Family: Placebo for Panic?" and dis­cussed the meaning of "the traditional family" that was the object of much debate in the presidential election. The "traditional" family of the 1950s was the result of indus­trialization, the Great Depres­sion, and WWII, said Clark. 
It is ironic that the political push for "family values" disre­gards the evolution of the family form, she continued. 
The philosophy of liberalism centers around the notion of self-contained characteristics, which endangers the family, said Clark. In her view, char­acteristics are not self-con­tained but are dependant on in­teraction with others. For ex­ample, "You make your gender as you live it, where you are," she said. 
She said that this contradic­tion of liberaliam is evident in "the difference between what liberalism promises and what it delivers." 
Mary Caputi's, assistant pro­fessor of political science, also spoke on "The Problem of Gender Archetypes" and fo­cused on the psychological theories concerning gender dif­ferences. 
The metaphor proposed by psycho-analysts such as Freud relates masculine characteris­tics with the mind, laws and regulation and relates feminine characteristics with irrationality and unconscious desires, she said. 
One post-modern critics as­sociate the male with serious­ness, while the female is asso­ciated with laughter, said Ca­puti. The panel discussion, "Feminism and the Family: Current Debates," was part of the week long event "Mary Wollstonecraft's 'A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,' A Cel­ebration at 200 Years." The student panel "A Revolution in Manners" will be held tonight at 7 p.m. in the Stapelton Lounge. 

Columbus faced 'collision of cultures' 
quire in human past we always face a dilemma," he said. So­ciety mistakenly applies its 20th century ideals and morals to individuals of the past, without understanding their point of view. 
"Legends that stubbornly cling like barnacles on the side of a boat," said O'Connell, like Queen Isabella selling her jew­els to finance the expedition, are partly responsible for these misconceptions. 
Columbus died with his own misconception that his greatest discovery was a failure, he concluded. 
O'Connell's lecture concluded the celebration of the SOOth anniversary of Columbus' landing in the New World. 
Reduce Reuse Recycle 


By KIM ST. CLAIR News Writer 
The problems between the Spaniards and the Native Americans that arose during Columbus' discovery of the New World resulted from a "collision of cultures," said Fr. Marvin O'Connell in a lecture at Saint Mary's Tuesday. 
There are many misconcep­tions about Columbus, Spain and the Catholic Church in the 17th century, said O'Connell, professor of history at Notre Dame, in his lecture, "Columbus, Catholicism, and a New World." 
For example, although Columbus' treatment of the Native Americans has come into question recently, many Spaniards actually supported the rights of the Native Americans, he said. 
History never repeats itself, said O'Connell. "When we in-

EC commissioner reinstated 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) ­Ray MacSharry, who resigned a week ago as the European Community's farm commis­sioner, was reinstated Tuesday to continue critical trade talks with the United States. 
MacSharry had given up his duties abruptly, complaining privately of interference from the community's chief execu­tive, Jacques Delors. 
Delors, whose native France has been most intransigent in the talks, was accused of ma­neuvering behind the scenes to try to prevent additional con­cessions to the United States. He denied blocking a deal, and over the weekend blamed Washington for the failed ne­gotiations. 
Washington, demanding deeper cuts in the subsidies the trading bloc pays to its 9 million farmers, threatened last week to impose stiff tariffs on French

OMB officials are "hoping to box Clinton in so he can't play games," said one lobbyist who has talked with budget office officials and who spoke only on condition of anonymity. 
The OMB official said Bush's final budget will probably be about 200 pages long, as op­posed to the 2 1/2-inch-thick document that is normally submitted. It will likely be re­leased in early January. 
It will show that with no ad­ditional changes, spending will remain under the caps required

In an article in yesterday's edition, The Observer mis­spelled the name of Professor Moira Fergusen from the University of Nebraska. The article also incorrectly paraphrased Fergusen. It should have read, "Woll­stonecraft illuminated the project of self determina­tion ... " The Observer regrets the errors.

The United States claims the supports cost U.S. producers $1 billion a year in lost sales. 
MacSharry met with Delors and other senior EC officials late Tuesday to thrash out the community's position in the trade dispute, and apparently agreed to resume his negotiat­ing duties. 
Britain, which currently holds the EC presidency, welcomed MacSharry's reinstatement, and trade secretary Michael Heseltine said "we want the talks to start and to be a success." 
On Monday, EC foreign min­isters urged the resumption of negotiations with the United States quickly to avert an all­out trade war.

"The space station is too costly and unreasonable at this time," he said. "Clinton is for the station, and I may have to battle against him over it." 
Roemer also plans to work on a crime bill to allocate more money for community police ef­forts in his district as well as work with the local mayors to discuss ideas to better the

It urged the community to hold firm against Washington and draw up a list of retaliatory sanctions in case of a trade war. 
The farm negotiations are considered vital to save a world trade pact among the 108 na­tions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT. 
The fight over oil seed sup­ports and a broader disagree­ment over EC farm subsidies in general have blocked agree­ment in the 6-year-old Uruguay Round negotiations, sponsored by GATT and aimed at over­hauling the world trading sys­tem.

Roemer added that timing is everything for Clinton, saying, "What Clinton needs to do to get things going once he's in office is to sit down with Congress in November and De­cember and outline his plans and goals." 
The country needs also needs to realize that it take time to put programs into effect. "The American people can't allow their expectations to be too high," he said. 
When Presidents Reagan, Carter, and Ford left office, they all submitted lengthy, full­blown budgets that included fa­vorite proposals to make changes in tax and spending policies.

French Ministers to be tried in AIDS-tainted blood case 
PARIS (AP) -Parliament began moving Tuesday to bring three former Cabinet ministers to trial in France's AIDS-tainted blood scandal, apparently re­sponding to a demand from President Francois Mitterrand. 
French citizens have been outraged by trials that showed the state-run National Center for Blood Transfusions know­ingly distributed blood tainted with the AIDS virus to about 1,200 hemophiliacs. Nearly all became HIV positive. About 300 have died. 
Prosecutors said the motive was to avoid the cost of import­ing clean supplies or buying expensive U.S. technology to decontaminate blood. 
Four lower-ranking officials including Michel Garretta, former director of the state-run National Center for Blood Transfusions, have been con­victed in the case. 
Mitterrand said in a televised interview Monday that the High Court of Justice should be con­voked to hear the case against three of his ministers who were in office in 1985. 
The court, an ad hoc group composed of members of par­liament, is the only body that can try Cabinet officials for negligence of duty. It has never been convoked in the constitu­tion's 34-year history. 
Socialist and opposition deputies agreed Tuesday that the lower house's 12 members of the court should be chosen Nov. 18. They will join 12 members from the conserva­tive-led Senate to comprise the full panel. 
The three accused ministers are former Premier Laurent Fabius, a Mitterrand protege who now leads the Socialist Party; former Social Affairs Minister Georgina Dufoix and former Health Minister Ed­mond Herve. 
The National Assembly, dom­inated by Socialists, had previ­ously refused to convene the court.

Bush fires official who searched files 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Seeking to end a simmering political embarrassment, President Bush on Tuesday dismissed the State Department official who initiated a pre-election search for passport records of Gov. Bill Clinton and Ross Perot. 
Bush telephoned Acting Sec­retary of State Lawrence Ea­gleburger and accepted Eagle­burger's recommendation that Assistant Secretary of State Elizabeth Tamposi be relieved of her duties, department spokesman Richard Boucher said. 
Other officials said Bush's call was prompted by a story in Tuesday's editions of the Wash­ington Post alleging that, after searching files for information on Clinton, department officials looked for material on Perot as well. 
Eagleburger ordered an in­vestigation Oct. 19 after press reports of the search of Clin­ton's files. It was later disclosed a search of the files of Clinton's mother also had been ordered. 
Suspicions about the de­partment's motives were heightened because the Bush campaign escalated efforts to discredit Clinton by citing his draft history and his role as an anti-war activist in Britain. 
Perot's press secretary Sharon Holman had no comment, but the Post quoted Perot as denouncing the search as "a gross abuse of federal power." 
"Somebody ought to hold them accountable for it," Perot told the Post. 
In Little Rock, Ark., Clinton spokesman George Stephanopoulos said, "Clearly this is a matter of serious con­cern.... There was a lot of abuse of power during this election." 
"This is a good step," Stephanopoulos said of Tam­posi's dismissal, but he added, "We need a full report." 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said Eagleburger assured him Tuesday that the State Department inspector general was investigating both the Clinton and Perot file searches and promised that the full report would be sent to the committee in a few days. 
According to a National Archives memo, the search of Perot's records was carried out by Richard McClevey.

Negotiators say attacks disrupt peace 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Israeli and Arab negotiators warned Tuesday that rocket and ar­tillery duels along the Israel­Lebanon border were disrupt­ing their peace talks. 
The Bush administration urged all sides to hold their fire so as not to endanger the ne­gotiations, and blamed Iran for supporting the Hezbollah guerrillas firing at Israel from Lebanon. 
"Those parties which are committed to the process ... should make every effort to re­sist the negative influence ex­erted by those opposed to peace, including the Hezbollah and its main sponsor, Iran," said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. 
Boucher did not single out any other party for criticism. Israel did. 
"We know that Syria has in­fluence in Lebanon, and, among other things, on Hezbollah, and the manner in which it wields this influence is monitored very closely by us," said chief Israeli negotiator Itamar Rabinovich. 
Both Rabinovich and his Syr­ian opposite, Muwaffiq al-Allaf, promised that the violence wouldn't deter them from their search for peace. But al-Ailaf noted that there was "a general negative impact" of the reports from the region which couldn't be ignored. 
And he justified the Hezbollah attacks, describing them as legitimate resistance to Israel's occupation of southern Le­banon. "As long as occupation is existing there, it constitutes an aggression against the Le­banese people," he said. 
Israel maintains troops and an allied Lebanese militia in a narrow zone in south Lebanon. 

Korean MIA's may be in alive in Russia 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The top Republican on the Senate Committee on POW-MIA Affairs said Tuesday that Americans missing in action from the Ko­rean War could still be alive in­side Russia, and he accused Russia of stonewalling U.S. ef­forts to find out just what hap­pened to them.

Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., also said the U.S. government "has covered up what it knew (about Korean War POWs) through a pattern of denial, misleading statements and, in some cases, lies." 
His comments came at the committee's first hearing held specifically on U.S. servicemen missing or held prisoner from the Korean War. The committee is scheduled to go out of ex­istence at the end of December. 
Smith released what he said was the most comprehensive compilation of U.S. government policy and intelligence infor­mation that has been known about the fate of men missing from the Korean War and what the government did to fmd out about them. 
"It is a document that shows in explicit detail that the gov­ernment of North Korea did not return a large number of American servicemen at the end of the war and that some of the men left behind were sent to Communist China and to the Soviet Union," he said.

NY judge arrested 
NEW YORK (AP)-Judge Sol Wachtler stepped down Tues­day as New York state's top jurist, agreeing to house arrest and monitoring by an electronic bracelet three days after being accused of threatening an ex­lover. 
Wachtler, 62, who before his downfall was mentioned as a possible gubernatorial candi­date or U.S. Supreme Court justice, was solemn and humble as he agreed to a no-bail ar­rangement that includes a promise to stay away from the woman and her daughter. 
He showed emotion -his eyes welling -only when fed­eral Magistrate Judge Sharon Grubin complimented "the wisdom you have shown on this bench." 
His attorney later announced Wachtler's resignation, while insisting that the charges "bear no relation to his role in the court."

FBI agents arrested Wachtler on Saturday on a Long Island freeway, and he had been under a suicide watch at a hospital. But a psychiatrist told the court that Wachtler was not likely to harm himself or others, or to flee. 
When the magistrate ques­tioned whether there was a need for an electronic bracelet, 
U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff said it was necessary to ensure "adequate protection for vic­tims who have received rather strong threats." 
"At this point, our motto is, 'Better safe than sorry,"' he said. 
"The notion of his being a danger to another human being is simply non-existent," replied Wachtler's attorney, Charles Stillman.

Smoke, acid rain 'eating away' at Mexico City 
MEXICO CITY (AP) -Voracious smog is eating 16th-century buildings and other treasures of the Spanish heritage in this former city of the Aztecs. 
From the soot-stained National Cathedral to the dirty pillar of the Angel of Independence, no monument has escaped the gritty assault in what is considered the world's most polluted metropolis. 
Experts say auto, factory and other emissions in the city of 16 million people will do more damage to historical landmarks in this decade alone than was done in the previous four centuries. 
"Smoke, acid rain, car exhaust, wind-borne dust and fecal matter -they've all combined to make a potent concoction, and it's literally eating away at our national monuments," said Ricardo Contreras, a preservationist. 
"It's much worse here than in Athens," where the Parthenon and other ancient structures face similar problems, he said. 
Contreras spent a smoggy day atop the marble dome of the classical-style Palace of Fine Arts, cleaning 'tear stains' from the mournful faces of statues of the Muses. 
"The faces are streaked with dirt and soot," said Contreras, who stood on a wooden scaffold above the roaring traffic, scrubbing at the grime. "Just as soon as we clean them, they become filthy again. 
"Fifteen years ago, it was lot easier keeping this building clean. Factory smoke, car exhaust, even ozone contamination is on the rise, and it's having a noticeable effect." 
Jorge Hernandez, the city historian, said sadly: "Our statues are becoming mutants. They're changing. There's one statue in front of the Hotel de Cortes, and that poor guy doesn't even have arms because of the smog." 
Mexico City recorded some of its worst pollution last winter, when the volcano-ringed valley trapped ozone and carbon dioxide at nearly four times accepted U.S. levels. Skyscrapers were barely visible blocks away, factories closed and cars were ordered off the streets. 
Window washers enjoyed a boom cleaning glass­sheathed skyscrapers, but the smog was a deadly chemical bath for older structures built of stone. 
"Many colonial buildings dating to the 16th century are seeing heavy damage," Contreras said. 
Downtown Mexico City has dozens of Spanish colonial buildings whose red volcanic stone, tezontle, has beeome grimy. 
Some of the worst damage shows on the cornices of the old stone Post Office and the imposing Franz Mayer Museum, and on dozens of pitted and pocked statues. 
Corrosion is particularly advanced at the Metropolitan Cathedral on the capital's vast central square. The twin towers and golden cupola are coated with soot, their deterioration aided by pigeon droppings that release sulfuric acid with the rains. 
"Look at the four apostles," said Jesus Ortiz Salomon, a cathedral guide, pointing to the white marble statues on the facade. "They have to keep cleaning them because of the damage from the smog and the pigeons." 
Fernando Pineda Gomez, director of cathedral restoration, said the vibration from traffic around the square has opened cracks in the cathedral's stonework that are made worse by auto exhaust. 
"Contaminants in the air have coated the entire building in a thick crust, and now whole chunks of stone weakened by this soot are peeling off and falling," he said. "It's really an all-out attack. 
"The cathedral is more than 400 years old and has survived every tribulation imaginable: ., invasions, storms, earthquakes, floods, even fire. Yet smog is one of the greatest threats facing our 
cathedral today." 
Pineda said the limestone used in building the cathedral and mearby structures centuries ago is particularly vulnerable. Workers have replaced some roofing stones and taken down statues, including a life-size bishop whose face had been eaten away. 
"We can't do much more than that," he said. 
The historian, Hernandez, noted that "this cathedral was built long before the American forefathers even arrived on the Mayflower," and said ofthe statues: 
"When they lose their faces, we lose part of our history, our national memory. Future generations won't even know who our heroes were.'' 

Only leap of 
.

consciousness can save us 
By STEPHEN ZAVESTOSKI 
Environment Editor 
Over-population, polluted water, polluted air, the greenhouse effect, global warming, desertification, rain forest destruction, world hunger, diminishing natural resources, social crises, endangered species-the list goes on. 
What do all of these have in common? They are part of the present global environmental crisis. I could cite studies, read lists and rationally argue that this crisis truly does exist. But for many today, admittance of the problem has already taken place, which presents us with the next step-solving the crisis. 
If our actions are a process of our attitudes, and our attitudes are a consequence of our knowledge, and our knowledge is a result of the way we think, then ultimately changing the way we act will require changing the way we think. 
But governmental legislation reacts to our actions, it does not anticipate them. Which means changing the way we think in order to change the way we act will take a "leap of consciousness," as environmental activist Jeremy Rifkin refers to it. 
Our leap will have to carry us from the unsustainable Industrial Age to a more friendly, sustainable and life-reaffirming Age of Ecology. 
This leap cannot take place, according to Rifkin, until we are ready to do battle with the worldview that gave rise to the crises we face. In other words, we must realize our concepts of science, progress, economics and knowledge are insufficient to sustain life on this earth at an equitable level for all 5 billion of us. 
-Science is not in and of itself bad, but we must refocus our science on reestablishing the community, on using our science to ground ourselves and reattach ourselves to the earth. 
-Progress does not have to be measured materially, we can progress by enhancing the well-being of the community and protecting the environment. 
-Economics must move away from its principles of production/consumption to softer regenerative values and life-sustaining principles. 
-Knowledge today is based on the technical, rational, logical, calculable and mechanical. We must rely more on relevatory knowledge by opening up instead of closing ourselves off. 
Affecting these changes can be accomplished making a self-aware choice to reparticipate in the body of life-the self and the environment. 
As Rifkin says, "we can maintain the T and bring it together in a new relationship with the 'other.'" 
Only, we will not know when this change has taken place. According to Rifkin, "a worldview is a worldview when you don't know it's a world view." 
Rather than simply being an issue, the environment will have to become a way of life. We may never be able to return the earth to its natural state, but we can at least improve our relationship with it and with each other.

PARIS (AP) -Despite a colli­sion with an armed escort ship, a Greenpeace boat stuck close today to a freighter taking highly toxic plutonium to Japan. 
Japan is shipping 1.7 tons of plutonium home to fire up a new generation of nuclear fast­breeder reactors. Greenpeace opposes the shipment and is tracking the freighter Akatsuki Maru along its secret route. 
Greenpeace says the pluto­nium poses huge dangers ranging from a spill to an attack by terrorists seeking nuclear bomb-making material.

"The Shikishima suffered damage on the rails of its landing platform and other ar­eas," the statement read. It said there were no injuries and that damage to the Japanese ship would not hinder its ability to defend the plutonium freighter. 
It said the Shikishima had protested the Solo's action by radio, and warned the Green­peace ship to keep safe dis­tance. 
A speck of plutonium inhaled can kill a human. It is also the key ingredient in nuclear weapons. Though France insists the shipment is not weapons quality, Greenpeace says it could be used to make 120 crude bombs. 
The Akatsuki Maru left the French port of Cherbourg late Saturday after a day of clashes between security forces and environmentalists. Its voyage home is expected to take two months. 
Greenpeace said the freighter and the Shikishima were sailing southwest in the Atlantic and could reach Portugal's Azores Islands by Wednesday. Japan has not disclosed the route, for security reasons. 
Greenpeace says that, con­sidering the dangers of the cargo, it will not interfere with the Akatsuki Maru's progress. But it plans to track the ship and warn nations when it nears their waters.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
'Take back the Night' march is scheduled 

Newspapers must make distinctions 
Dear Editor: 
On the evening of November 15, organizations from both Saint Mary's and Notre Dame are sponsoring the "Take Back the Night" March, a march to symbolically reclaim the night from sexual assault and violent attacks. 
In our campus communities, how many of us have not heard someone say to us never walk alone at night? How many of us as freshmen were not told, dur­ing the first few days of coming here, about Rape Road? Unfor­tunately, not many of us could answer these questions, "Not me." 
By these words, I am not en­couraging anyone to do those things that we have been told not to do. Sadly, it is not safe to disregard these words of ad­vice. Thankfully, programs such as the Escort Service and Safewalk have been put into effect so that we are not put in the dilemma of feeling that we cannot go out at 10:00 or 11:00 at night when something has to be done. 
However, I am saying this: if we are ever going to make the night and the streets safe for our younger sisters and broth­ers, for our future children, for the person who just wanted to look at the moon and stars ­we must stand together and retrieve the power that has been taken from us. Then, we will be able to transform our world from a prison to a home. 
We invite you, the students, faculty, and staff, to join us in a show of solidarity for safe Michiana streets. The event begins at 7 p.m. in the LeMans Hall Courtyard of Saint Mary's, and marchers will travel along the main avenue connecting the campuses, to the Grotto at Notre Dame, where there will be a short meditation. The March concludes at the Woman at the Well at Notre Dame. 
The "Take Back the Night" March is sponsored by the Saint Mary's Center for Women's Alliance, Women's Alliance, the Saint Mary's -Notre Dame Campus Alliance for Rape Elimination, Notre Dame Feminist Forum, and Notre Dame Safewalk. 
For more information, call 219/284-4779 or 219/284-5469.

Dear Editor: 
As a Jewish prospective grad­uate student I applied to Notre Dame anticipating a mutually supportive inter-faith experi­ence. While expecting a certain lack of familiarity with Jewish history, culture and beliefs, the absolute lack of awareness and sensitivity demonstrated by the printing of the "Jewish Slave Law" article (The Observer, Nov. 5) came as a shock. 
Having worked closely with the Catholic community over the years on peace and justice issues, I know the ignorance 
~nd hate manifest_ in that artic~e IS not representative of Catholic 
how and if Jewish issues are addressed in the Catholic edu­cational system when university journalists are blind to what such an article represents. 
Certainly it can often be diffi­cult to differentiate between censorship and professional discretion. It is the public duty of all newspapers, however, to distinguish between blatant lies and hate literature on the one hand, and factually correct ar­ticles of varying perspectives on the other. It seems that the current incident is providing this lesson. 
It is reassuring to read letters from students and faculty who deplore the content of the aforementioned article. The process of reconciliation would be furthered still by an apology from The Observer.

Be careful when calling for censorship 

Dear Editor: 

In the Nov. 5, 1992 edition you published a letter from L. Clifford Cheney concerning "Jewish Slave Law". The next day you had to explain why you would publish such an atrocious pack of lies and twisted view of history. 
I won't bother spending much time mentioning the lack of sanity and excess of paranoia Mr. Cheney harbors, my con­cerns are with the Observer. 
I agree with the Viewpoint Editor's point that ALL views must be printed if we are to really have a free society, even those of stark raving lunatics such as Mr. Cheney. 
What bothers me is the label "Guest Columnist." That implies that his views were sought out, or desired by the Editorial Staff. I do not believe such views are in any way in agreement with those of the Editorial Staff. I believe a mistake was made by putting his views in a Guest Columnist category instead of the "letters to the Editor" section where they really belong. 
If I were the Viewpoint Editor, I would also have followed his letter with a disclaimer stating that the views of those writing in do not necessarily represent those of the Observer. 
Those who feel the letter should never have been printed need to be careful about calling for such censorship. For as foul as such views may be, if we give up the right to express even these disgusting opinions, we are opening ourselves up to the same kind of oppression that Mr. Cheney would like to see.

Smokers relegated to POW status in 'Stalag 12' 
At halftime during the termi­nal appearance of the '92 ND football team, I invite all so­cially-concerned scholars to visit gate 12 (i.e. Stalag 12). There they will find an encaged group of fans who actually smile at fellow POWs (Prisoners of Wimps). 
Real folk are they -engaged in salubrious, amicable chats with otherwise strangers -tak­ing the progress of that day's match with philosophical as opposed to fanatical interest. 
The diverse exchanges are witty, charitable and of Aris­totelian as opposed to Platonic flavor. A disputation on, say, "Virgil and His Indebtedness to the Politically Correct Catholic Intellectoids" is, on occasion, interspersed with a hushed plea '-ah, hast thou a match?" 
Yes, Stalag 12 of the du Lac POW cage consists of sinners 
i.e. smokers. Whilst Biblical ex­egists have yet to find this "sin" even mentioned in early Gene­sis nor in later Old Testament texts e.g. remarks in re: Sodom and Gomorrah, our new-age enthusiasts have discovered in their PC hearts an eighth Deadly Sin -smoking. 
This "sin" is now proscribed even in the open, wind swept arena of our Jock-Eden, the ND Stadium. 

Professor James J. Carberry 
du Lac's Pariah-in-Residence 
What next we may well ask? Shall we ban our cheerleaders comely displays as probably cause of puerile, prurient thoughts? Or an occasional bit of Billingsgate aimed at officials (and the enemy) when our warriors are judged guilty of a rule infraction? Indeed the pos­sibilities of further fascist lib­
eral concerns regarding evi­dence of Original Sin are now legion. 
"What to do?" asked Lenin. Listen to your hearts. visit Sta­lag 12 at half-time. Give these poor mis-guided souls, impris­oned therein, solace, comfort and Campus Ministry book­matches emblazoned with "Go and smoke no more". then re­turn to your seats, unlighted ci­garette or cigar in mouth as a smokeless prayer on behalf of the poor smoking souls in Sta­lag 12.

answered: "Mother Theresa. The President. My grandmother. Bruce Jenner." 
Eeah year, I prepared to write down "Eric Estrada" -I would then hear my fourth grade teacher ask, "Please explain to the class why you choose a character from 'C.H.I.P.S.', and not a martyr of the 16th century, as your hero." 
"It was those sunglasses, and his leather gloves," I answered defiantly, "I want to be Ponch!" With my peers' laughter echoing in my ears, I was shocked back to reality and wrote down "Ghandi" like any well-balanced child. 
No more. I throw off the yoke of oppression and speak the truth to the mumbling Charlie Brown teachers of the world. Here are the answers I burned to write. 
THE TOP 10 HEROES OF MY YOUTH: 
l.HAN SOLO: I'm referring to the pre-carbon freezing years when this Correllian was still a feared scoundrel. You know you're cool when your co-pilot is Chewbacca (a wookie who ripped off the arms of people who beat him at bolo-chess), and your space ship, the Millenium Falcon, could do the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs. 
2. 
BILLY BATSON: He had it all-with one mighty word ("SHAZAM!") he turned into Captain Marvel, drove around in a wicked RV, and his girlfriend was Isis. 

3. 
LINUS: A humble, blanket wielding defender of the mind: he knew the real meaning of Christmas, told everyone about the first Thanksgiving, and gave due homage to The Great Pumpkin. Chris Norborg (of Chisel) said it best: "An unassuming character, yet such a sublime and profound thinker, completely devoid of preten­sion-he was kind, yet strong, a theologian, an athlete even-a true Rennaisance Man." 

4. 
WEIRD HAROLD: The rebel of the "Fat Albert" gang who made a bold fashion statement with his pulled down wool hat with the cut out eye holes. 

5. 
JANA: Of the Wonder 1\vins, Jana was far superior to Zan. When they touched rings and said "Wonder Twins power activate!" Jana could become any member of the animal kingdom (even a dinosaur), while Zan turned into-a bucket of water? 

6. 
BO AND LUKE: The brothers Duke of Hazard County were "just good ol' boys, never meanin' no harm." The General Lee was the baddest thing on four wheels, Daisy could have creamed Laura Ingles in a bar room brawl, and no one could drive a tow truck like Crazy Cooter. "Someday the mountains might get 'em, but the Law never will." Yeehah indeed. 

7. 
WILDBOY: Of Kroft Super Show's "Bigfoot and Wildboy" fame. He fought crime in the Pacific Northwest and his best pal was a Sasquatch. And dig those wooly boots and the buckskin vest. 

8. 
SCOOTER: How cool would it be to stick your head in the Muppet Show's guest star dressing room and say "Mr. John Denver? 15



-seconds to curtain Mr. Denver."? Plus he got all the backstage dirt on the Kermit/Ms. Piggy/Gonzo love triangle. 
9. 
THUNDARR THE BARBARIAN: Of the ScifJ/Fantasy/post apocalyptic Saturday morning cartoons, his was my favorite. Sure, his sunsword was a light saber wannabe, and Ukla the Mok (his sidekick) was a poor man's Chewbacca, but he could kick the butt of anyone on Laff 0' Lympics (even the Really Rottens}.

bile some students are running around 
aimlessly trying to 
decide on a career, one group of students has already made up their minds. 
SERV, Students Encouraging Religious Vocations, provides a permanent supportive community of like-minded peers, according to founder Herbert Juliano. 
"We are an organization which encourages, supports, and promotes vocations to religious life," said Juliano. "SERV gives values to religious and priestly vocations, while also affirming lay vocations." 
SERV sponsors a weekly Mass for Vocations and a weekly Rosary for Vocations. Prayer for Vocation cards are distributed throughout the campus year round. Throughout the academic year SERV sponsors the programs Vocation Vigil, Operation Andrew, and Way of the Cross. 
"Recognizing that every voca­tion is a gift from God which must be implored by prayer, SERV invites all students to take part in the Vocation Vigil by praying one hour a month for vocations," said Juliano. 
Operation Andrew is a min­istry whose goal is to bring people to know and serve Jesus Christ by bringing a brother or sister into the fold of those who answer God's call, according to Juliano. 
The program derives its name from the gospel in which Andrew "first findeth his own brother, Simon...and brought him to Jesus.. ." (John 1:41-42}. "It's the same concept," Juliano said. "When we see a person seeking a vocation or even remotely interested in a career within the church, we reach out to them and give them the extra support they may need."

gram implemented this year. On the first Friday of each month, SERV members walk the "Way of the Cross" with special prayers for vocations. The prayer service takes place outdoors along the shore of St. Joseph Lake. 
Other programs include an annual special mass for vocations in conjunction with the World Day of Prayer for Vocations and an annual Pathways retreat to "discern direction." 
The four main goals SERV keeps in mind throughout the year, said Juliano, are: 
to make its members more aware of their personal Christian vocation in their daily life, through prayer and action;to pray for 
' ... few consider about religious vocations; not because they don't want to do it, but because they have not been exposed to it yet.'

numerous and holy vocations to the Church and that those who have accepted God's call may persevere; 
to 
offer part of the joys and sufferings of their daily life for vocations; 

to 
proclaim the importance of heeding Jesus' command to pray for vocations, according to their possibilities. 


Juliano founded the organiza­tion in the 1990-91 school year. Then, his only concern was having a successful group on campus; he had no idea how much positive response SERV would receive from outside sources. 
"We have received many let­ters from other colleges and uni­versities, high schools, parishes, and dioceses," said Juliano. ''I'm amazed at the response, but it gives me hope. This is a wonderful organization that gives a great amount of support to students." 
Juliano said that he strongly supports SERV at the high school level. 
"The high school years are the most formative for most students," he said. "They [students] arrive at college with an idea of what they plan to do in life, but few consider about religious vocations; not because they don't want to do it, but because they haven't been exposed to it yet." 
The most significant develop­ment came when Serra Interna­tional, an organization which has been promoting vocations to the priesthood since 1935, discussed the possibility of becoming the international sponsor of "Serra SERV Clubs" on college and high school campuses, said Juliano. 
"I believe Serra was most im­pressed with the fact that SERV is not an ideological organization. We take no political or religious stands. SERV exists for the sole purpose of promoting vocations," he explained. 
SERV currently has 46 mem­bers, 10 of which are female. The organization is open to Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students who know they want a vocation in the church, who are considering the possibility of serving in the church, or who simply want to pray for those striving for a vocation in the church. 
"Our hope is that we can pro­vide an environment, programs, and experiences in which students can explore the many different ways they respond to God's invitation and freely discern the path they need to take in following the Lord," said Ju­liano. "We hope this process will assist Notre Dame and other students in discovering their gifts and discerning God's call in their lives," he added.

Accent Writer 
F ootball isn't Not.e Dame's only 
contribution to television. 

"Today's Life Choices" is a show which 
brings the Notre Dame spirit of 
education to cable and PBS stations 
throughout the country. 
Produced by Golden Dome 
Productions for the University of Notre 
Dame, "Today's Life Choices" tackles a 
wide variety of contemporary social 
issues and tries to offer varying perspec­
tives from nationally and internationally 
renowned experts. 
A wide range of topics are ad­
dressed from world political issues such 
as the environment, to national social 
issues such as socialized medicine, to 
personal moral issues such as doctor-as­
sisted suicide. 
The show was originally developed 
in 1989 for the Vision Interfaith Satellite 
Network. VISN is a cable television 
network that offers high quality religious 
programming as an alternative to the 
"televangelist" shows. VISN combines 
the efforts of mainstream Protestant, 
Catholic, and Jewish groups and reaches 
some eight million households across the 
country. 
"Today's Life Choices" is also 
carried nationwide by more than 50 PBS 
stations. 
The format of the show features 
interviews presenting different 
perspectives of a certain issue, with an unseen narrator tying the information together. Interviews focus on people who are involved with the topic. 
And although the show is produced by a Catholic university, it is not a vehicle for Catholic religious doctrines. Its goals are of an objective journalistic nature. 
"This is not a show about religion. We're trying to foster a more educational atmosphere. But when moral and ethical questions do arise in a certain issue, we don't back down from them. Most other issue-oriented shows feel that values complicate matters so they're not present in the overall analy­sis," said Gary Sieber, the show's writer and Notre Dame adjunct assistant professor of Communications and Theatre. 
The show's willingness to account for morality and ethics is what makes it unique from other shows that deal with similar issues, according to Sieber. 
"A lady once did an interview with us concerning physician-assisted suicide. She had also done an interview earlier with '20/20,' and she said they made her feel uncomfortable when talking about the religious aspects of the issue, but we were very willing to consider these aspects, in addition to all other arguments," Sieber said. 
Programming for the show is decided by a committee of eight faculty members headed by Father Richard Warner, director of Notre Dame Campus Ministry. The committee meets twice a year to talk about what is happening in the world, and what issues concern their viewers. 
"Today's Life Choices" is very much in tune with topics addressed by other shows, such as "60 Minutes" and "20/20,"and often it finds itself competing with other highly-esteemed news organizations for stories. 
"We have a very limited staff compared to a network news show, so we have to be more resourceful in getting our information, but we have the dedication to do it. During the Earth Summit in Rio this year, a lot of people were trying to talk with Senator Al Gore, but he would only give four interviews, and one of those was with us," said Executive Producer Michael Doyle. 
Part of the high quality of "Today's Life Choices" comes from getting the best sources on the given topics. ln addition to Gore, the show has also featured interviews with characters as renowned and diverse as Arthur Schlesinger, Daniel Ellsberg, Gary Hart, and Martin Sheen. Sieber attributes the access to these guests to the integrity and resources of Notre Dame. 
, "Often, a lot of the experts hesitate to talk to the networks and the media because they aren't sure if those groups are trustworthy, but Notre Dame's repu­tation gives them a sense of security and they are usually willing to talk with us," Sieber said. 
The ultimate goal of "Today's Life Choices" is to challenge the viewer's previous assumptions about an issue, and foster further discussion. 
"Mter we've finished production of a show, we like to invite some of the Notre Dame professors over to watch it together. Mter seeing the show, we ask them what they think, and the response is usually agreement or disagreement with what one of guests on the show said. Then, the professors get into a big discussion and it looks like the show is still going on right there in the room. That's when we know that we were successful," Doyle said. 
"Today's Life Choices" has earned attention from viewers and television stations. It has won the "Gabriel Award," the New York Film Festival Award, and a Silver Medal from the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education. 
The producers aim to keep the show in the same basic format with the same emphasis on top quality journalism. Doyle and Sieber would like to see the show expand to a larger audience. 
The show is aired on WNIT (Channel 34) at 8:00 p.m. on Saturdays and repeated at 11:30 a.m. on Sundays and on VISION Interfaith Satellite Network (Cable Channel 31) at 7:00p.m. on Saturdays. Reruns are aired on WNDU (Channel 16) at 7:30 a.m. on Sundays. 
"My dream would be for 'Today's Life Choices' to be the 'Nova' of contemporary social issue shows. When you're talking about television shows dealing with science, everyone thinks of 'Nova,' and I would like to see our show gain that same reputation," Sieber said.

The fans remained standing for the length of the concert, even during the songs from the band's upcoming album, with which few concert-goers seemed to be familiar. A relatively slow beginning, marked by a strong base beat that reverberated through the blood and bones of the crowd, paved the way for lead vocalist Chris Barron's introduction of "Jimmy Olsen's Blues," the first recognizable hit ofT their debut album, Pocketful of Kryptonite. 
Few people seemed distressed by the fact that Barron's distinctive voice was abominably muffled by Stepan's less-than­ideal acoustics. Bassist Mark White and guitarist Eric Shenkman had no problems conquering the sound impediments, however, as each performed phenomenal solos during the course of the show. 
"They're just a lot of fun," said Chris Weirup, a junior from Alumni Hall and avid fan of the Spin Doctors. Weirup saw the band earlier perform in the year, but insisted, "every show is different-it's always fresh." 
Sparked by the ousting of one rowdy student, Barron urged the crowd to act responsbily to avoid physical injuries. Using the opportunity to present a call for cooperation and non­violence, he announced, "It's not the 80s, it's not the 60s, it's the 90s, man.... It's not me time anymore, it's us time." 
Instead of trying to conquer the dismal seating arrange­ments, many fans folded up their chairs and created pockets of open space more condusive to the energetic dancing encouraged by the upbeat music of the Spin Doctors. Stepan Center was packed with groups who decided that dancing, not seeing the musicians, was the most important part of the con­cert. 
In a smart strategical move, the band saved "Two Princes" until after intermission, thus preserving fair-weather fans for an extra half hour and earning the Greenpeace stand in the rear of the arena additional customers and publicity. 
After "Two Princes," the crowd was substantially reduced, but this fact didn't seem to bother either the remaining fans or the band, who remained to play a gruelling second half, including "Little Miss Can't Be Wrong" and a soulful rendition of "How Can You Want Him (When You Know 
...
You Could Have Me?)" that far surpassed the album cut. A crowd-pleasing encore extended the show more than fifteen minutes.

Riddick Bowe is the challenger that Holyfield needs 
LAS VEGAS (AP) -Riddick Bowe is big, strong and un­beaten -just the kind of oppo­nent Evander Holyfield wants. 
You could say Bowe is the kind of opponent the undefeated, undisputed heavyweight champion needs. 
Holyfield has been criticized for fighting two 40-year-old­plus opponents in George Foreman and Larry Holmes and not being able to knock them out. Detractors also jumped on the champion after his narrow escape against Bert Cooper in which he was knocked down in the third round before getting up to stop the unheralded challenger in the seventh round. 
"It's a little different mentally this time," Holyfield said Tues­day before the final pre-fight news conference at The Mirage. "Here's a guy who gives me credibility. 

The 25-year-old Bowe has a 31-0 record, with 27 knockouts. 
"It's a better match than Larry Holmes or George Foreman. I didn't get any credit for beating them. They didn't really fight to win. Riddick Bowe wants to win, not just go the distance. It's a make-or-break fight for him." 
The betting line was pick 'em for the fight Saturday night at the Thomas and Mack Center. 
"When people say, 'You're fighting a tough fight,' it feels good,'' Holyfield said.''I'm in a plus situation. When my oppo­nents don't get credibility, it takes away from my work. You bust your behind to become the best-conditioned athlete. You beat Larry Holmes and people say, 'Cakewalk, man.'" 
When the 30-year-old Holyfeld won the title on Oct. 25, 1990 with a one-punch, third-round knockout of James "Buster" Douglas, the conqueror of Mike Tyson, the story was Douglas' obvious lack of physical condi­tion and apparent lack of effort. 
"The reason Holyfield don't get no respect is because he's a cruiserweight," Bowe said. 
Another knock against Holy­field, who once held the 190­pound cruiserweight title, is that he is a manufactured heavyweight. 
The 6-foot-2 1/2 Holyfield, who fights at about 210 pounds, lifts weights as part of his fight prepartion. He said, however, that for this fight he has cut back on his weight program. 
At a meeting to establish fight­ing protocol Monday, Rock Newman, Bowe's manager, talked to Mark Rattner, chief inspector of the Nevada State Athletic Commission, about more comprehensive pre-fight testing. 
Newman said he did not men­tion steroids in what he called a private conversation. Rattner, however, did mention steroids when he mentioned Newman's suggestion to others at the meeting. 
It caused a bit of a stir. 
"I don't care if he takes 
steroids the rest of his life," said the 6-5 Bowe, who expects to weigh about 230 pounds. "If he is taking them, it's not going to help him." 
While Bowe has youth and size on his side, Holyfield (28-0 with 22 knockouts) is much more battle-tested. 
"I realize he hasn't been tested mentally for what is about to come," Holyfield said. "When I look at him, I look at a guy who doesn't really know all about it yet. Every fight has to give you that, but Bowe hasn't proved that yet. 
"I realize the person who can beat me is one with a lot of courage and a lot tenacity." 
Holyfield's tenacity has never been questioned.

Eckersley caps career-year withAL Cy Young award 
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) ­Dennis Eckersley, who had a career-high 51 saves for the Oakland Athletics this season, on Tuesday became the first re­liever since Detroit's Willie Hernandez to win the American League Cy Young award. 
He received 19 of 28 first­place votes from a panel con­sisting of two writers in each of the 14 league cities. With three seconds and three thirds, Eck­ersley totaled 107 points under the 5-3-1 system. 
"This is a once-in-a lifetime opportunity. I feel very lucky," Eckersley said during a satellite news conference from his home in Boston. 
Jack McDowell of the Chicago White Sox was a distant second with two firsts and 51 points, followed by Roger Clemens of Boston with four firsts and 48 points. Mike Mussina of Balti­more was fourth with two firsts and 26 points, followed by Jack Morris of Toronto with one first and 10 points, Kevin Brown of Texas with nine points and Charles Nagy of Cleveland with one point. 
This year, Eckersley converted all but three save opportunities as the Athletics won their fourth AL West title in five years. 
"I had a good year," Eckersley said. "It was my year. Look, I made some mistakes and I still saved ballgames. I saved 51 ballgames. You can't take that away. It's not easy to do." 
Eckersley's amazing year may be remembered more for the shocking way it ended. 
In Game 4 of the AL playoffs with Toronto, Eckersley came on in the eighth with a 6-2 lead. Toronto scored twice before Roberto Alomar hit an Eckers­ley pitch for a two-run homer that sent the game ipjo extra innings. The 7-6 wingave the Blue Jays a 3-1 lead on the way to winning the playoffs and the World Series. 
Eckersley still winces when talking about Alomar's homer. 
"People rely on you to close it out and when you don't it's devastating -and we all what that is-the Toronto game," he said. 
"But you have to go through the pain to go on. I shed some tears and now I'm looking ahead. I just want to work hard and come back next year and prove that I'm worthy of all this." 
Eckersley was traded to the Xs in 1987, and pitching coach Dave Duncan decided he should go to the bullpen, where he saved 16 games with a 3.03 ERA. Earlier that year, Eckers­ley had joined Alcholics Anonymous to battle his drink­ing problem. 
In 1988, he finished second in the Cy Young voting to Min­nesota's Frank Viola after notching 45 saves in 54 oppor­tunities. Again, his brilliant season was overshadowed by one of the most famous blown saves in history. 
In Game 1 of the World Series, Eckersley retired the first two batters in the bottom of the ninth. After walking Mike Davis, he surrendered a towering home run to Kirk Gibson that lifted the Dodgers to a 5-4 win. The Xs went on to lose in five games. 



AP File Photo Oakland A's relief pitcher Dennis Eckersley became the first reliever in eight years to win the American League Cy Young Award. 
The following year, he missed SPORTS BRIEFS 
40 games with a shoulder in­jury but still finished with 33 saves as the Athletics won the World Series. Eckersley regis­tered a 0.61 ERA in 1990, the lowest in major league history for any pitcher with more than 25 innings of work. 
The next year, he became the first reliever ever to post three 40-save seasons. 
"This job is not easy," said Eckersley, who compared his role to that of a field goal kicker coming in to try to make a field goal with the game on the line ..

The next week the Nittany Lions fell behind an emotionally charged Boston College team 35-7. But Penn State made a comeback, closing the Eagle lead to three before losing, 35-32. 
After defeating West Virginia, the Nittany Lions faced Brigham Young, which was fresh off of a humiliating loss at Notre Dame. While the Cougars bounced back well, Penn State was unable to continue its return to early-season form, dropping the contest 30-17. 
But the Nittany Lions have been busy preparing for their meeting with Notre Dame. 
"Penn State had an open date this week. I know we will see the same football team that Mi­ami saw," said Holtz. 
Despite tough losses the last two years at the jaws of the Nittany Lions, Holtz is not interested in revenge this season.

In the last two weeks, Notre Dame has demolished Brigham Young and Boston College, both of which beat the Lions.

Sweet 16 turns sour for NO rugby against Wisconsin 
B RIAN AKEY 
Y Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame rugby team, coming off two solid qualifying round performances, faltered Saturday in the opening round of the Midwest division's bracket of the national Sweet 16. 
The Irish dropped the opening match of the tournament to Wisconsin 30-12, before regrouping to beat Cincinnati 24-10. 
The Badgers-Irish matchup in the opening round, many felt, was the real championship match of the tournament. 
"The matchups were ran­dom," said club president Mark Babka. "And after seeing all the teams play, I can honestly say that I felt we and Wisconsin were the two best teams. Had the tournament been seeded, we would have played them in the second game and been competing for the champi­onship." 
In the match with the Bad­gers, however, the Irish were still shooting for a spot in the 
finals. After trailing 5-0 early, the Irish came back and led 7-5 before Wisconsin eventually 
pulled awav. Although the team lost, there were examples of positive play by individuals. 
Most impressive, Babka felt, was the performance by Mark Naman, a sophomore who took 
over for starter Eric Marsh at prop after Marsh suffered an injury. 
"I had never played organized rugby before this year," Naman said. "But I just tried to use the skills the upperclassman taught me. I went in at the half when we were losing, but I thought we still had a chance to come back, so I just tried to play as solid as I could." 
In the consolation champi­onship, the Irish dumped Cincinnati to finish the tourna­ment in third place, a bitter­sweet win, according to Babka. 
"It was good to finish our fall season with a win, yet at the same time, we were a little dis­appointed in how we placed-we wanted to improve on last year's third place finish." 

a lot of teams being bowl teams with six wins." 
He said that NCAA decisions to limit scholarships to 85 players after three more seasons will spread talent further and cause more parity. 
"Kids will compete each Sat­urday. Maybe you won't have big mismatches," he said. 
Penn State leads its series with Notre Dame, 8-7-1, after winning the last two games. It is one of only six schools to lead its series against the Irish. Two of the schools no longer play Division I-A football.

Injury ends career of one of NFL's finest players 
The NFL lost one of its true champions Saturday when New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor went down with a season-ending injury. What was supposed to be his fi­nal season was cut short by a ruptured Achilles tendon against Green Bay. 
Football fans may only have memories of the man whose presence was so greatly felt on the football field that the mention of his his initials brought fear to NFL quarterbacks. 
It wasn't the most fitting way for a player of LT's stature to end his career. As in most cases, the end of a remarkable career is not marked by a stirring final day in the sun, but by a sudden goodbye which leaves fans gasping for a more fitting ending. 
A small consolation comes from the play that ended LT's playing days. Packer quarterback Brett Favre attempted a pass through the fierce pass rush applied by Taylor, only to have it batted down by number 56. 
LT suggested that his injury may force him to play another year, andGiants coach Ray Handley even urged LT to return upon hearing that his achilles tear would force him to miss the rest of the season. "I hope a player of his caliber wouldn't want to go out on a golf cart." 
Playing another season will make little difference in his legacy. 
From his first play to his last, Taylor had an effect on football which will never be forgotten. No offense could execute against the Giants without finding some way to contain LT. Throughout the eighties, general managers went on a search for athletic offensive lineman who could contain the most feared pass rusher in the game. Draft picks were spent on athletic young linebackers who would become "the next LT" 
LT wasn't the most loved athlete in the NFL. A storied problem with drug use earned him league suspensions, and his arrogance didn't bode well with league officials trying to clean up the image of the game. 
Yet nothing done off the field could overshadow LT's accomplishments in his twelve seasons with the Giants. He was named an all-pro ten times and was the NFL player of the year in 1986. 
In the Sports Illustrated Classic issue released two weeks ago, SI named the a best player at each position in NFL history. Taylor was the only player from the last ten years to make the list. 
Sharing the prestigious honor with LT were football greats Dick Butkus and Jim Brown. These players stick out in my mind, as they were the athletes which my father described to me when I was a child. He would tell of their legend, deleting the negatives of their character which stood only as a footnote to their remarkable feats. 
Someday I will tell my children about Lawrence Taylor, Joe Montana and the other great players of today. And when I speak of their greatness, I will also leave out the flaws in their character, as we often do with people we admire.

Kurowski out with stress fracture 
Public will get a glimpse of the '92-'93 Irish tonight 
By MIKE SCRUDATO 
Sports Editor 

Notre Dame men's basketball coach John MacLeod found out he has another hole to fill yesterday, as he was informed that freshman guard Keith Kurowski would be out at least six weeks with a stress fracture in his left foot. 
X-rays on the foot were negative, but a bone scan detected the injury. A CAT­scan will be performed today to determine the severity of the fracture. 
"He (Kurowski) could miss anywhere from six weeks to the entire season," head basketball trainer Skip Meyer commented. 
"We are going to need some people to step up," MacLeod said of the situation. 
Two people he singled out were sophomores Malik Russell and Jason Williams. 
The injury, along with Nathion Gilmore's decision to leave the team, leaves the Irish with only ten scholarship players for tonight's charity intra-squad scrimmage. 
The event begins at 6:30 p.m. with a 90-minute practice, which will be followed by five seven-minute games. The teams will be rotated for each game. 
Both the practice and scrimmages are open to the public and admission is two dollars. 
The open session will provide students with a chance to see the new-look Irish team which features four new starters. 
"We're not as solid defensively as we need to be, and the communication is not there," MacLeod commented. "But, it takes time. We're a young team with a lot of new players." 
MacLeod has been pleased with the progress some individuals have made since last season.

Holtz won't count out Nittany Lions 
By ROLANDO DE AGUIAR 
Associate Sports Editor 

While defending himself against charges of running up the score against Boston College, Irish football coach Lou Holtz also emphasized the strengths of Joe Paterno's Nittany Lions during his weekly press conference Tuesday. 
Holtz labeled as "ludicrous" commentary which criticized his play choice during the second half of the Boston College game. 
''I've been in coaching a long time, and I've never run the score up on anybody," said Holtz. "But by the same token, we were going to win the football game. 
"Whatever we did the first half, I thought they were capable of as well. We were playing the number five offensive team in the country." 
This week, the Irish play Penn State, which ranks fifth in the country in scoring. The Nittany Lions won their first five games, but have since dropped three of four, including losses to Boston College and Brigham Young, whom Notre Dame

becoming more sure of himself," he said. "(Joe and Jon Ross) have both improved. They are bigger and stronger, and we are going to need that from them." 
However, his players are not the only people who have impressed the second­year coach. The strong student ticket sales have not gone unnoticed. 
"It's terrific," MacLeod said of the students' enthusiasm. "It is the kind of student support we need. It's great to know the students will be jammed in here (the Joyce ACC). It will give us a major plus." 
McDuffie: It's going to be a rough week 
STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -The pressure is off Penn State to win another football game, and that could be part of the problem for a slump that has seen the Nittany Lions drop from the Top 10 to 6-3. 
The university in May committed Joe Paterno's Lions to the Blockbuster Bowl: All the team had to do was go out and win six games. After nine games, that's all they've won. 
The bowl bid is locked up. They can't go to a bigger bowl. There's no longer a carrot at the end of a stick. 
"I think if we had that, it would help us get motivated," flanker O.J. McDuffie said Tuesday. 
Penn State, then 5-0 and ranked seventh, took Miami to the wire, losing 17-14. It didn't regroup in time for Boston College and lost. The Lions clinched the Blockbuster bid against West Virginia, but lost big to Brigham Young. 
This week, the Lions play at Notre Dame and are a decided underdog. Pitt visits Nov. 21. 
"The way it looks, it's going to be a rough week," McDuffie said. 
Paterno was brutal in describing the Lions' chances. He said the team has little chance of stopping Irish quarterback Rick Mirer or running backs Jerome Bettis and Reggie Brooks. 
"I haven't the slightest idea," Paterno said, grasping for lucky solutions like dropped passes, holding penalties, snow and 80 mph winds that switch direction at the end of each quarter. 
"We're not going out there with the idea of
