The parents ofan autistic child can't see to have the child sterilized without a judge's approval, the Indiana Court of Ap­peals ruled in a 2-1 decision yesterday. "This case does not involve ordinarv medical treatment or radical surgery immediately neces­sary to preserve the life ofthe child. This operation would irreversib­ly deny to a human being a fundamental right, the right to choose whether to beget a child," the court said. The ruling did not identify the child or the parents. The appeals court held that it was the parents' duty to show their child should be sterilized, rather than the child's duty to show that she shouldn't. "Certainly, a fundamental right is meaningless if the possessor carries the burden of proving the right to exercise it. Affirmative judicial authorization must be obtained for sterilization of the incompetent," the court said. The ruling came in the case of a child who was 12 when her parents decided they wanted her sterilized. A person acting on behalfofthe child filed a request for an injunction to stop the sterilization. -AP

Professor Donald Barrett dis­cussed compensation reports, suggesting three new approaches which would benefit the faculty. 
First, he discussed the need for in­vestment in faculty salaries and com­pensations. Then, Barrett stated that Notre Dame should commit itself to giving a minimum cost of living in­crease. Third, he suggested appoint· ment of an annual ad hoc faculty fringe benefit committee. 
Due to a large amount of impor­tant material. the Faculty Senate will resume discussion of these and other topic:-; such as faculty renewal and the PACE report in its January meeting.

Laxalt will assume the post of Republican National Committee Chairman in January. "I'm going to have a lot of fun with Laxalt and the Reagan deficit this year," Manatt said. 
The committee chairman charac­terized the Reagan economic plan as a "shift of resources from working people to the privileged people of America," explaining that cuts in so­cial programs have severely affected the elderly and minorities. 
"In this Christmas season Scrooge may be living in the Office of Management and Budget and the White House," he said.

the phase-out last week upon Schmitz's recommendation. 
Schmitz noted that the original purpose of an engineering science ( ES) degree was to offer a "more flexible" curriculum to engineering students who wanted a broader background in science and the humanities. Undecided students could "tailor-make a program to suit their interests." 
He conceded, however, that an Engineering Science curriculum is now "discouraged" by the depart· ment since the same diverse options are available with electives in anoth· er engineering program. 
"Its best purpose was served a decade or more ago. Then the other (engineering) programs didn't con­tain a fundamental basis (in humanities), but now they do." 
Schmitz elaborated that the ES de­gree was formerly used "to prepare students for graduate school. The other engineering programs taught students the practical aspects but not the basics." 
"Eventually, the engineering department dissolved to the point where all programs prepared stu· dents for advancements," he said. 
With only 26 degrees conferred in the past ten years and just three stu­dents currently enrolled, the Engineering Science program has "definitely suffered" from a lack of interest, said Schmitz. 
He listed several reasons for the phase-out, including the fact that "engineeringscience is not easily ac­creditable (upon graduation) be­cause ofits lack ofstructure." 
"With no goals or integration of classes ... there is the disadvantage of an engineering degree which is not accredited." 
Considering the lack of interest, Schmitz said he felt that elimination of the ES curriculum is "not a very big move," but rather, "almost ob· vious." 
"Nothing is lost to the students in the change. There is no shift of faculty or budgetary changes in· volved." 
The only change brought about by the phase-out. according to Schmitz, is that "the undecided per­son will now have to select a specitk program treshman year, although he will still have the option to change."

Fear ofMafia caused man to shoot mayor 
PLYMOLITII, Ind. ( AP) -fear that LaPorte MayOi' A.J. Rumely had Matla connections and might harm his family prompted Harold W. Lang to attack the mayor and his wife in their home, Lang said in a police video tape played at his murder trial yesterday. 
"I felt it was a matter of life or death -my mother's survival. my brother's survival," Lang told inves­tigators in the taped e<)nfession made two days after the Rumelys were attacked last May. "I was the only person who could protect them." 
Lang, .)0, has pleaded innocent by reason of insanity to two counts of murder and one count of burglary. The state is seeking the death pen_alty. 
Mrs. Rumely, 68, died immediate­ly after the attack early on May 31. Rumely, 71, died from complica­tions of gunshot wounds on Thanksgiving Day in a South Bend hospital.

would be dug at the base of the monument, but only moderate structural damage would result. However, hundreds of pieces of shrapnel would be thrown up to I,800 feet away and the blast would be strong enough to break windows in the White House 2,000 feet away. 
Scores of tourists managed to get out when the siege started. 
Nearby government buildings were emptied; thousands of employees were sent home. Since the White House was in shrapnel range. President Reagan was asked to ~tay on the side facing away, toward Pennsvlvania Avenue. 
"It's up to the press, it's up to the 
media," the man said. "They have 
been pretending that we are not 
threatened every day of our lives 
with annihilation. And whether by 
collusion or otherwise they refuse 
to give the real information about 
the precarious situation the world 
finds itself in." 
Dade County police otticer Tim Davis said Mayer, 66, was arrested in Dade County in October 1979 on charges of illegally distributing religious material.

"I was afraid that (Alex) Toth -or Rumely or both were into ~ome kind of drug ring. maybe had mob con· nections. I just thdn't know," Lang said in the tape. 
The prosecution maintains Lang took out his frustrations on Rumely and his wife when he lost his job at the city's sewage treatment plant. 
Lang got into a fight with Toth, hb supervisor at the plant, last April Lang maintins he suffered a back in· jury in the tight. took a few days sick leave and learned he had heen tired when he returned w work. Toth, who testitled last week, said Lang quit. Lang said Toth lied but the mayor ignored his claim. 
"I was afraid for my family," Lang said in the tape, made in the early hours ofjune 2 after several hours of questioning by two policemen, LaPorte Police Capt. Roger Farley and Sgt. Arlen Boyd of the Indiana State Police. 
"The only reason any sane person would have stonewalled or taken the attitudes he ( Rumely) had or allowed Toth to take them, was, you know, he must be connected with the Mafia or a drug ring," Lang said in a calm, even voice. "I felt we could be killed at any minute." 
The two-hour, black and white video tape culminated testimony in Marshall Superior Court yesterday by the two policemen on Lang's in­terrogation and confession. 
At the end of the video tape, Lang was asked ifhe thought he was sane.

personal reflection "one of the most concrete things that a person can do in this challenging time for the Church, and difficult time for the country." Baxter also feels that 
"conscientious objection should be brought into the forum as a moral equivalent with abortion." 
The majority of COs choose this route "not so much because they are afraid of bt'ing killed, but because they are afraid to kill," according to Baxter. This belief is accompanied by a feeling on the part of the CO that although he cannot do some­thing for the state that violates his conscience, he is looking for an al­ternative way to serve the state with­out having to fight in a war. 
According to a recent issue ofThe Christian Century, the job al­tematives for COs who win their claim "are generally social service in nature, with low pay, and far away from the community in which the COs live." 
The remoteness of the possibile military service often puts the potential CO at a disadvantage. Al­though more than forty possible COs have approached Campus Min­istry, and national trends indicate an increase in the number ofconscien­tious objectors, Baxter notes that "the question does not weight heavi-

ly on most persons' minds because there is no immediate danger of a draft." 
Campus Ministry's counseling for COs emphasizes the idea of preparedness. "There is no doubt in my mind," believes Baxter. "that many people will regret having not declared being a CO should a draft occur." 
For many Americans who morally or religiously are opposed to military service, the choice to oppose war is not an easy decision. The possibility of ostracism from society, or even conflict within one's family looms very largely in the mind of a person considering conscientious objection. Campus Ministry's service for COs attempts to help guide students who are ex­periencing the self-doubts that often accompany these conflicts.

MXpr~duction runs into Senate criticistn 

WASHINGTON (AP) The Reagan administration, stung by House rejection of production plans for the MX missile, ran into stiff criticism in the Senate yesterday on its proposal to bunch the deadly nuclear missiles together in Wyoming. 
"The public is getting the idea the whole thing is a boondoggle," Sen. Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash., one of the Pentagon's staunchest allies in Congress, told Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. 
"I don't think you realize the de­gree of trouble the MX basing mode is in now," Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., a strong supporter of military spend­ing, said as the Senate Armed Services Committee began hearings. 
Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, told Weinberger that a "political deci­sion" had apparently been made to cancel the basing plan favored by former President Carter in favor of "a basing mode that is more environ­mentally acceptable but may not be technically feasible." 
Sen. Howard Cannon, D-Nev., winding up his service in the lame­duck session following his defeat in the November election, said he strongly supported the MX but not necessarily the so-called "dense pack" plan for deployment near Warren Air Force Base, Wyo. 
Weinberger defended the 
feasibility of the plan, which is 
designed to cluster the missiles so 
closely that in the event of a Sovet 
attack the first exploding enemy 
warhead would destroy or cripple 
the rest ofthe enemy's warheads in a 
phenomenon known as "fratricide." 
He said Tuesday's 245-176 House vote to delete S988 million for the first five missiles -if sustained by the Senate -would amount to "telling the world we are disarming unilaterally." 
In a television interview, the defense secretary conceded that"... some way we have not yet been able to convey to the American people or to the Congress the really serious nature, the growing nature of the peril" from the rapid Soviet arms buildup. 
Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified 
that three of the four joint chiefs 
originally opposed the "dense pack" 
plan, but one of those said he would 
agree to it if the plan would help 
with arms control efforts. The ad­
ministration argues that a deployed 
MX missile puts the United States in 
a stronger position for arms control 
talks. 
Edward L. Rowny, special repre­
sentative for arms control negotia­
tions, said the MX was not merely a 
"bargaining chip," adding, "We need 
it for oursecurity, but once we get it, 
it does give us leverage." 
President Reagan vowed after the 
vote to "do everything I can to take 
this case to the country." 
Senate Majority Leader Howard H. 
Baker Jr., R-Tenn., said he expects 
the bill with the MX funds to be 
brought up in the Senate next week. 
"We're somewhat stronger over 
here," said Baker, an MX supporter. 
Sen. John Stennis, D-Miss.. the 
ranking Democrat on the Armed 
Services Committee, also supported 
the adminbtration, which has 
dubbed the missile -originally 
called MX for "missile experimen­
tal" -the Peacekeeper. 
"It makes no difference what you 
call it, if the Congress is not going to 
back the president in this kind offar­
reaching decision. we are in a bad 
fix,'' Stennis said. 
Sen. John Tower, R-Tex.. the com­
mittee chairman, called the House 
vote "surprising and disappointing" 
and said, "At no time in my memory 
has the Congress treated a major na­
tional security program proposed by 
'hte president in such a cavalier fas­
hion." 
Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., said in a 
television interview that the House 
vote "clearly indicates defense will 
not go unscathed this year." 

The Hou~e, meanwhile, neared a vote on the S231.6 billion military spending bill from which the MX funds were cut. The bill still con­tained about S2.4 billion in research and development funds for the missile. Rep. joseph B. Addabbo. D­N.Y.. chairman of the House Ap­propnauons subcommittee on defense, proposed to cut this to S I billion but said he was not optimis­tic. 
The new plan is the opposite of the Carter proposal: instead ofbeing moved around a wide area, the missiles would be huddled together for protection. 
White House strategists said they were working on a plan to assure victory for the MX in the Republican-controlled Senate. This would send the issue to a House­Senate conference committee. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcom­mittee on defense, has said he doubts the conferees could agree. 
White House spokesman Larry Speakes predicted the MX produc­tion funds would fare better in the

Stillonlysemi -conscious 
Heart patient taken off sedatives 
SALTLAKEClTY(AP) -Doctors 
removed artificial heart recipient 
Barney Clark from sedatives and 
nursed him slowly back to con­
sciousness yesterday, guarding 
:.gainst a recurrence of the seizures 
that put him back on the critical list. 
Clark opened his eyes early yes­
terday morning and was moving his 
arms and legs but was only semi­
conscious, said John Dwan, Univer­
sity of Utah Medical Center 
spokesman. 

"There's nothing going on now 
that would suggest he wouldn't 
make it,' said Dr. Chase Peterson, 
university vice president ti:>r health 
sciences. 

Dwan said the 61-year-old retired 
dentist, who received the world's 
first permanent mechnical heart in 
surgery that began last Wednesday 
night, was "very stable with gradual 
improvement in responsiveness." 
Committee 
approves 

taxhike 

WASHINGTON (AP) The 
Senate Finance Committee, without 
so much as a whimper of objection, 
tentatively approved yesterday a 
nickel-a-gallon increase in the 
federal gasoline tax to finance a mul­
tibillion dollar program of highway 
and mass transit improvement. 

There was little debate, no op­
position and not even a formal vote 
on the tax increase as the panel 
acted before moving to other, more 
controversial parts ofthe bill. 

The full House approved the in­
crease in the tax, currently four 
cents a gallon, 262-1-l), early rues­
day. GOP leader Howard Haker of 
Tennessee has predicted the Senate 
will follow ~uit later this week, al­
though opponents are threatening a 
tllibuster in a bid to defeat it. 

The tax would raise an estimated 
SS. '; billion a year. money that sup­
porters say would create I~o,ooo 
jobs in the construction industry at a 
time when national unemployment 
stands at a -tO-year high. 

About St.4 billion would go to 
highway and bridge work, while the 
remainder would be earmarked for 
mass transit construction. 
During the night, Clark was removed from the sedati\'es which kept him unconscious in the hours after the seizures Tuesday morning. 
Doctors expected him to regain full consciousness today or tomor­row as the sedatives leave his sys­tem, Dwan said. 
Dr. Lyle Joyce said Clark seemed to be responding to treatment to correct a chemical imbalance thought to have caused the short, but intense seizures. Dwan said doc­tors would know the treatment was working if there were no more 
seizures as Clark wakes up. 
"The neurologist says the longer we go without any seizures, the bet­ter he is," Dwan said. As a precau­tion, he added, "they're bringing him out (ofsedation) very slowly." 
He said a tape of Handel's ":\1essiah," which Clark had enjoyed prior to the seizures, was again playing in Clark's intensive-care unit room. 
His treatment included continued 
rest, the seizure-suppressing 
medication Dilantin and a stomach 
tube~fed diet of nutrients designed 
to balance lt:\'els of minerals, salts 
and sugars in Clark\ metabolic sys­
tem~ 
The nutrients have been described as resembling a thin puree. Peterson said they ha\·e the nutritional equi,·alent of whipped carrots and "old-fashioned" chicken soup. 

"\X'e now arc entering a period, and a relatin:ly long period they hope, of wait and see," Dwan said. Doctors maintain the polyurethane heart is working tine and believe it did not cause the seizures. 
Clark was near death from degenerative heart disease when he received the Jarvik-7 heart during seven hours of surgery ending last Thursday morning. The Seattle-area resident, whose plastic organ is tet­hered to a bulky drive system, is the first human to have a permanent mechanical heart.

A billion miles away 





Halley's colllet sw-ings into view-
Discover News Service 

Halley's comet swings into view . . . Early on the morning of Oct. 16, astronomers David jewitt and G. Edward Danielson ofCaltech, · using the 200-inch telescope at Palomar Observatory, recorded a faint speck of light drifting through 
the constellation Canis Minor. 

They thus became the first 
astronomers to confirm the return 
of Halley's comet, which is heading 
back toward the sun after a 6-billion­
mile odyssey through the frozen 
reaches ofthe solar system. 

The comet, which comes round 
every 76 years, is still 140 million 
miles beyond Saturn and not due to 
pass by the earth until early 1986. 

In the past t1ve years, aided by the 
calculations of Don Yeomans of Cal­
tech'sJet Propulsion Laboratory, vir­tually every large observatory in the world has spent some time scanning Canis Minor for the comet. 
But even though they knew where to look, astronomers had a hard time finding the tiny iceball ­it is still more than a billion miles away. 
Jewitt and Danielson succeeded by fitting the mighty Palomar tele­scope with a charge-coupled device -a wafer of silicon that is about 50 times as sensitive to light as photo­graphic tllm. 
The two Caltech astronomers think they first detected the comet in September, but but it passed in front of a bright star -which over­whelmed its image -before its or­bit could be confirmed. 
On Oct. 16 the comet was in a clearer part of the sky, and by making a series of six-minute ex-

(AP Pbo/o) 
posures the astronomers could ojetect its movement against the background of stars. Danielson says, "It's 50 million times fainter than can be seen by eye." 
Because the earth will be in an un­favorable viewing position in its or­bit around the sun, the comet will not be nearly as spectacular to the naked eye this time as it was during i.ts last visit, in 1910. Far better views will be provided by an armada of spacecraft scheduled to meet the comet in early 1986. 
Unmanned cometary probes are planned bv the Soviet Union and France, the European Space Agency .andJapan, and astronauts aboard the :space shuttle may watch from a dis­tance. 
Halley's comet will not be the on­ly one to be visited by spacecraft in the near future. NASA, which could not find the money to send its own Halley probe, has decided to mount a bargain-basement mission to Com­et Giacobini-Zinner. which will ap­proach the sun in 1985. 
The spacecraft chosen for the 
mission is the third International 
Sun Earth Explorer (!SEE 3), which 
has been orbiting the sun about half 
a million mile~ ahead of the earth 
since 1978 to study particles stream­
ing from the sun. 
Next year, controllers at the God­
dard Space Flight Center will swing 
!SEE 3 close to the moon, allowing 
lunar gravity to detlect the craft into 
a trajectory that will take it 4!i mil­
lion miles out to Comet Giacobini­
Zinner. 

The probe is expected to pass 
through the comet's tail on Sept. 11, 
1985, about 2,000 miles from the 
nucleus. Although ISEE 3 carries no 
cameras, its instruments should :send back data on conditions in the tail.

Possible cancer medicine 
Drug reverses sickle--cell anemia 
BOSTON (AP) -An experimen­
tal drug will reverse the major cause 
of sickle cell anemia, an important 
killer of black Americans, by turning on genes that have been dormant since birth, a study shows. 
The treatment is believed to be science's first successful attempt to control the output of specific genes in humans. One expert said it openi a promising new approach to treat­ing disease. 
"It signitkantly reduced the ten­dency of sickled cells to form." said Dr. Arthur W. Nienhuis, one of the researchers. "There was an increase in the number of normal cells." 
The drug, called 'i-azacytidine, has also been extensively tested as a possible cancer medicine, but it is not yet on the market. The resear­chers said much more study of its long-term dfects is needed beli>re it could be routinely prescribed for sickle cell anemia or other blood diseases. 
The scientists used the drug in 
adults to activate the genes that .or­
dinarily oversee the production of 
hemoglobin before birth. 

The treatment was tested by doc­tors from the National 1-leart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md., and a report on the work was published in today's New England J~>urnal of \kdicine. 
The doctors used the drug on two people with sickle cell disea~e and three with thalassemia, a blood dis­order common among .\1editer­ranean and Southeast Asian people. 
Both deadly diseases result from defects in the genes that make beta­globin, which combines with anoth­er protein to form hemoglobin, the substance that carries oxygen and makes the blood red. 
While developing in the womb, human fetuses produce a similar substance called gamma-globin which has a different set of genes. Normally, the fetal genes shut off at birth and the adult genes take over. 
Hut the adult genes fail to work in victims of the two blood diseases. Those with sickle cell produce an abnormal form of hemoglobin that makes red blood cells with a sickle shape and causes the blood oxygen level to fall. Thalassemia results when the body produces too little hemoglobin 
The treatment was described as "a major new step" by Dr. Edward ]. BenzJr. ofYale Medical School, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal. 
But he wrote that its importance "does not rest solely on the fate of this particular drug as a possible 'magic bullet' for these disorders." Instead, the work '"proves that detailed knowledge about the molecular physiology of individual genes allows the development of promising new ways to treat disease." 
Sickle cell anemia occurs almost entirely among black people. Its vic­tims in the l nited States number about 2~.000. 


Kokomo sIJ;fotorola has AMstet·eo lead 
WASHI:'-JGTO:'-J (AP) -Officials of Motorola Inc. are hailing Kokomo, Ind., oftkials of the Delco Electronics Division ti>r urging the General Motors Corp. to adopt an A,\1 stereo radio system developed by :V\otorola for its cars. 
Motorola officials have said the move could shorten their competi­tion with three other AM stereo designers who have been vying for the acceptance of broadcasters. 
Besides \\otorola, the Harris Corp., the .'vlagnavox Consumer Electronics Corp.. and Kahn Com­munications Inc. have each developed a transmi~sion system 1chat allows A\1 radio statio. broadcast in stereo, ju~t a~ F',J radio stations do. All t()Ur systems are in­compatible, however, meaning that a radio built fi>r one will not play the stereo signal ofanother

Question of responsibility never fades 
A few days ago I was skimming through the business section ofa newspaper from "the city that works." Set amidst the myriad of stock reports was the picture of an infant above which were printed the words; "We're all

created equal. After that, baby, you're on your 
own." 
The pointednes~ of the statement brought to mind various events of recent weeks. Among these was the continued press coverage of Mary Cunningham and Bill Agee, the corporate "whiz kids" who are proving that a married couple can be a highly success­ful business team. 
It is interesting to note that in a time when roles are being examined more closely than ever before. we hear a good deal of talk around campus about the Notre Dame stu­dent's "responsibility." This responsibility ap­parently entails the student's action toward improving conditions in our le!>s-than-perfect world. 
Yet, it often seems that we are too busy to take that responsible action. We are caught up in the decision-making process ofsrudent life. As the semester draws to a dose. it becomes apparent that the choices we make are, indeed, important one~. They will affect our careers and our impact on the world. 
But there is no reason to measure our 

obligation solely in terms of our future ac­tions. There are choices which we make daily that have just as important an affect on the world. 
Speaking in terms of role playing, we need to look at the positions to which we delegate human beings. In the now-disrupted realm of role assignments, there is room for con­structive action. 
It would be good to examine our current role models to determine if they help each person to develop his or her talents. After all, roles are really not benet1cial if they do not lead us to a fuller, more involved life. 
We need to examine what limits we place on our actions. It is important to notice whether we restrict ourselve~ on the basis of our preconceived ideas or if our actions are really freely chosen. 
This judgment could also extend to our out­look on other people. Do our opinions of others require their conformity to our ideals? 
Today we are offered the opportunity to eliminate so many ofthe stereotypes that have bound people for ages. Yet, these changes will require action on our part. 
I suppose it all comes back to the question of responsibility. If we are to take an productive part in the formation of the future, we must act now. 
We need to allow others the opportunity to reach the full potential of their talents. This entails a reconsideration of our role require­ments. 
It is time that we recognized the fact that people cannot reach their humanity within the existing framework of social roles. We 
Sex at Notre Dame? 
Over the past semester I have reinforced some friendships, abandoned some entirely (an unfortunate circumstance but one which had to happen), and also rr.ade some new ones. A couple of those new friends have opened my eyes to a side of Notre Dame and 



Tim Neely 

My Turn 
Saint Mary's that I hardly knew existed, be­cause it is something rarely talked about, at least in public. That is the sexual side ofNotre Dame. 
I suppose I was naive the last four years. I had thought that there was very little premari­tal sex here -so little that I knew only a small number ofstudent~ who had so indulged. 
Some ofmy new friends have convinced me that the opposite extreme also exists, that there is much more that goes on here than I had thought. Despite Dulac's admonitions against premarital ~ex, it docs happen with some tn::qucncy. 
I can recall a convnsation with a friend several m<)nths ago in which I stated my belief in the sexual situation at the two campuses. She took issue with me, stating that based upon her experiences with friends and roommates, I was o!f base; especially off campus. There i~ much casual sexual activity, she claimed. 
After some mort· unscicnti!lc study, I have tentativdy concluded that reality is some­whne between nn-original idea of vast chas­tit\· and her idea of extreme hedonism. No statisticall\ valid survey has been done at :"<otrc Dame or Saint \lary's about sexual at­titudes and behavior th;lt I know about, hut the results would probably shock some G:Jt­sider:-; who believe all the students here are good, upstanding, conservative Catholics. 
Regardless, unhealthy sexual attitudes do exist around here. My "favorite" is consider­ing nearly everything relating to the sex act as gross or deviant. There is a limit to what most people can accept in relation to sexual rela­tions, but with many of my acquaintances that limit is so low as to be ridiculous. Perhaps they are blessed with the same delusions I had about the overall sexual activity here, and that is why they consider such things as masturba­tion and french kissing as deviant. 
Another problem is that sex is not taken seriously. Some upperclassmen may recall the old WSND-AM radio call-in show Radio Free Notre Dame. Every month or so the subject was "Sex at Notre Dame." Easily the most popular show in the history of the station, it was that way for all the wrong reasons, and eventually it was forced off the air along with its hosts after one particularly foul evening. It did not discuss the subject seriously at all; in­stead, it used stereotypes, innuendo. and Anglo-Saxonbms that would have other radio stations pressing the panic button -except at WSND there was no panic button to pres~. and the callers knew that. (All call-in shows are now on seven-second tape delay). Many people found the show extremely funny. Others found it disgusting. Actually, it was ex­tremely sad. 
That show passed on three years ago. but things have not changed much. If the same were attempted today, the resulb would be identical. Perhaps the lack ofseriousness with. which sex is treated rdlects ignorance and fear. especially the latter. There really b no place to discuss sex openly in this community, especially considering the official ban against premarital sex here. Sometimes friends are not a good place to turn, citht.:r. And bccau~e of ignorance, people have entered situations which they went {)11 to regret. 
need to act openmindedly and encourage each other to work to our best abilities no matter what the t1eld. 
As intelligent, thinking individuals, we do have a responsibility to act. Perhaps the most important thing we can do is to help the human race reach a point where it will no lon­ger be hindered by role stereotypes but will recognize each person as an equal being un­hindered in the development of his or her potential. 
Don't we owe it to the babies?

abstentions, and the New York Giants were .:j.., -'5 in favor. 
Members of the Dallas Cowboys, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Lm An­geles Rams said their teams had voted overwhelmingly in favor, al­though they did not disclose the vote, and a member of the Falcons said they had approved it. It was also reported that the Buffalo Hills had approved the contract by a 2-1 mar­gin. 
The Houston Oilers also approved the contract. But the Bears and the Lions, who voted against ratification, were two of the last teams to agree to return to practice after the strike ended. 
Detroit's St<~n White," member of the NFLPA executive committee, said the Lions h<~d turned down the <~greement "by more than <1 2-1 mar­gin." 
Bear player rep Brian Baschnagel declined to disclose his ream's vote except to say it was against the con­tract. 
Accc:ptance of the contract by a majority ofthose participating in the vote would complete: the ratitlca­tion process and formally end a labor dispute that forced the tlrst in­season strike in the league's 63-year history. 
The players, whose signed ballots were vc:riticd by their player representatives, voted at their train­ing sites with the individual team results forwarded to the union's headquarters for final tabulation. 
The contract includes a S60 mil­lion one-time cash bonus to be dis­tributed among the league's I,'500 players, an increased minimum wage scale, severance pay, increased playoff, pension, insurance and per diem monies and other benefits. 
And for the tlrst time, NFL clubs guarantee to allocate specific sums toward player compensation over the life of the contract. The players also won greater access to their medical records and the right to choose their own surgeon for game­related injuries.

Irish cotne frotn behind to beat WMU, 68-62 
By MIKE RICCARDI 
&. Sports Writer 
KALAMAZOO, Mich. -When the raw talent of the Notre Dame women's basketball team didn't overwhelm Western Michigan, the Irish had to resort to fundamentals to gain a hard-fought 68-62 victory over the Broncos at Read Fieldhouse here last night. 
Sound fundamental play allowed the Irish to chip away at Western's eight-point halftime lead. Notre Dame shot 5-of-7 from the field to begin the second half by outscoring WMU I0-4 and pull to within two. Freshman forward Trena Keys, returning from an ankle sprain that put her out of action for a week, popped a baseline jumper to give 
f. the Irish their first lead with eight minutes remaining. Notre Dame couldn't shake the Broncos until the last three minutes, when the Irish relied on their mas­tery of the moM fundamental offun­damentals -the free throw -to score their last seven points, secur­ing a slim lead and clinching their first road win ofthe sea~on. 
"We showed a lot of poise, com­ing back two points at a time," said Coach Mary DiStanislao. "There were no bursts or tlurries. Our game

Notre Dame's game reached low ebb in the early going as the Irish were only able to sink one of their first 13 shots. Bronco guard Terri Walker, who finished with a game­high 25 points, took charge, scoring eight to lead Western Michigan to a 14-2 lead after five minutes. The Broncos were able to keep a 12­point lead until 2:08 was left in the half. 
"We felt kind of lost because the gym was so open," said guard Laura Dougherty of "--otre Dame's .i4.2 percent first-half shooting. "But when we got used to it, it was easy to

Closing the books onfootball 
They held the 63rd annual football banquet last night at the ACC, and the big story was that there wasn't any big story. 
Despite rumors to the contrary, it was not Gerry Faust's "Last Supper." In fact, Faust and Father Edmund 
P. Joyce looked like best buddies -they even sat next 
to each other at the head table. Well, so much for drama. What remained was your ordinary, run-of-the-mill 
banquet: speeches, awards, more speeches, more awards -you get the idea. In addition, the words "student-athlete" and "fine human being" were used and overused. 
Father Hesburgh, the star of last year's banquet with his attack on college football's criminal element, must have known something -he didn't even bother to showup. 
The toastmaster was Rocky Bleier, who captained the At 1967 Notre Dame football team and went on to stardom with the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers. 
Bleier, who is now a Pittsburgh sportscaster, is an elo­quent speaker, unlike the stereotyped jock. But he did put his foot in his mouth on one occasion. 
When inferring that Irish fans had overly high ex­pectations this season, Bleier classified them into three categories -"yesterday" people, "today" people and "tomorrow" people. 
"'Yesterday' people believe football is built on legacies," said Bleier. "And they expect the current results to mirror the past successes. 
"'Today' people seek immediate gratification. They want an instant winner, right now." 
'"Tomorrow' people, meanwhile, possess the hope that keeps us going. And they are the only ones that can someday take Notre Dame where it's supposed to be." 
After extolling the virtues oflooking ahead and being a "tomorrow" person, Bleier proceeded to look back 
 and detail the story ofGeorge Gipp. Oh well. There were awards, too: 
cornerback 
Dave Duerson was voted the team's Most Valuable Player by his fellow teammates. Duerson ranked sixth in the nation in interceptions this year with seven. 

Linebacker 
Mark Zavagnin, the Irish tackles leader with 113, was named the Outstanding Defensive Player. Zavagnin also received the John W. McMullan Award, presented annually to the Notre Dame player who best exemplifies the spirit ofthe scholar-athlete and has con­tributed his skill and ability both on the field and in the classroom. 

Guard 
Tom Thayer, who played three different positions on the offensive line this year, was tabbed as Outstanding Offensive Player. It was the second straight 


-year that a lineman was named the top offensive perfor­
mer, which may or may not say something about the Irish offense. 

Chris Needles Sports Editor  a·.~.-··~~\;/~:.  
"  

Center 
Mark Fischer, with a :~.1 GPA in accounting, was the recipient of the Scholar-Athlete Award. 

Captains 
for the 198j squad will he quarterback Blair Kiel and cornerback Stacey Toran. Both will be seniors. 


In between, there were subtle references that this year's 6-4-1 record was commendable -it was just that fans' expectations were too high. 
"We all know that football builds character in ath­letes," said joyce, "hut it's very difficult to prove that football builds character in fans." 
And, of course, you've already read Bleier's com­ments. 
All of this was met with lukewarm response by the 700 or so in attendance, who payed an incredible $18 each just for dinner. Drinks were much extra. 
Veteran banquet-goers commented that it was the smallest crowd they had seen for a NOtre Dame football banquet in years. The reasons were obvious -the economy, the weather and, yes, another disappointing season. 
So, last night there wasn't much talk about the past­just the future. "We have become a family," said Faust. "The spark we've created this year will carry over to next year. The candle will get brighter." 
For Faust's sake, I hope so. The man deserves at least 
another year or two to try to turn things around, using 
the players that he recruited personally. Once he grows 
into the job, Faust will be a successful college coach ­
when that will happen, if at all, is unknown. 
Still, the situation isn't as rosy as last night's banquet made it out to be. Sure, all 22 seniors will graduate on time. Sure, all the players are "fine student-athletes," "fine human beings" and "credits to their families and to Notre Dame." 
But to the diehard Irish football fans -the ones who hunch over their radios religiously every Saturday, the ones who spend hoards of money on season tickets and tailgaters every year, the ones who contribute all the money to this university -all that counts are the num­bers. 
And the numbers don't lie. 
In just two years, the Notre Dame football t'Cam, with a marked increase in talent, has been transformed from a 9-1 I Sugar Bowl-hound, national championship con­tender, to a .500 team. 
When this is finally changed, these banquets will finally mean something. 
powers  Kentuckv,  UCLA  and  In­ 
diana. Fairfield, which finished  11­ 
18 last season. is for real.  

"We have to watch out ti>r a letdown,"" say... Irish Coach Digger Phelps. "Fairfield's ·a much better team than two years ago (when the Stags took the Irish to the wire before losing, =;--.=;=; ). I think their win against Connecticut on the road the other night ( 98-H I on Tuesday) convinced a lot ofpeople." 
Besides the Connecticut victory, Fairfield has defeated :'lliagara ( 79­69 ), Canisius (80-6S ). and Lehigh ( 66-SH ). fairtleld'~ average victory margin has been 1-1 points. 
But despite his team's recent succes..,, fairtield's second-year coach Terry O'Conner is worried that the Irish, after a tough week, are ready to explode. 
"They (the Irish) may really want to win a game on Thursday (today)," say., O'Conner of the Irish, who arc coming off three straight to...ses. "It's obvious!~ f<ir us going to he a very difficult game -it's at South Bend. After their last three games, we're not the same caliber as Indiana, Ken­tucky and I CI.A, by any stretch. It's obviously going to he an easier game for them."
