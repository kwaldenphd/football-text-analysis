Recycling 
program aids poor 
Miraculous Metals raises funds for Catholic Worker 
By LIZ O'DONNELL 
News Writer 
In the spirit of going green, a new recycling program has been imple­mented on campus to help both the environment and the less fortunate. 
The Miraculous Metals recycling program combines environmental­ism and social justice to provide assistance to South Bend residents who reside on the streets during the frigid winter months. 
"Miraculous Metals has been doing very well so far, but we have a long way to go," said Lauren Restivo, a sophomore at Notre Dame, who is involved in the program, "Since the program is still getting off of the ground, we are still trying to get the word out about how to participate in the program and increase participa­tion." 
The program allows students at Notre Dame to raise money through the collection of aluminum cans for the Catholic Worker House, a shelter that takes in the homeless on freez­ing and sub-freezing nights during the winter. 
A portion of the proceeds will also be donated to Our Lady of the Road, which is the Catholic Worker drop-in center that takes in the homeless during the daytime. 
On campus, each dorm has a des­ignated representative who is in charge of ensuring his or her dorm's donated aluminum cans are ready for pick-up. Once a week, paid guests from the Catholic Worker House will be at Notre Dame to collect the cans.

Iraqis reflect on changes to country 
By MOLLY MADDEN 
News Writer 
Three Iraqi students talked about their experiences living in a country that has played a large role in recent American foreign policy in a presentation Friday entitled ''I'm From Iraq." 
The talk was the conclusion of Holy Cross College's "Faith and Culture Dialogues," a three-day event that aimed to present new perspectives on Iraq. 
The presentation featured Karam Salem and Omar Rasheed, students at Holy Cross, and Randa Al-Assadi, a student at Saint Mary's. During the intro­duction, the audience was told that the goal of the talk was to help Americans have a more per­sonal relationship with Iraq and view the country as more than just a political issue. 
"Iraq is an old civilization with a wonderful culture and a long history," Karam Salem said in his opening speech. 
Salem is originally from Baghdad, but relocated to Syria in 2006 because his Catholic fam­ily feared violence. In Nov. 2007, he was chosen for the Iraqi Student Project, a venture that allows displaced Iraqi students to continue their college education either in Iraq or abroad. 
"I was raised in a neighbor­hood that had Muslims and Christians," Salem said. "We lived in peace; there was no dif­ference between people and we all grew up amidst different reli­gions."

Civil War Re enachnent 
When was the last time you saw somebody wearing a hoopskirt? For that matter, when was the last time you wore a hoopskirt? 
For me, the answer to both ques­tions is late last August. 
In fact, I actually happen to own a hoopskirt, an 1800s corset, petti­coats, two hoopskirt-equipped dresses and a bonnet which I con­sider rather fetching.

Editor
don't run away in terror when­ever a bus pulls 
up. 

But I do use a bucket, washboard and clothesline to do laundry when I'm at work. I do wear a snood (ten points if you know what a "snood" is). 
I'm not the kind of re-enactor who travels around with a troop of re-enacting Union or Confederate soldiers (We all know what those girls are like). 
I work at a museum -in the schoolhouse, actually. I love it. Anyone who's ever read or watched the "Little House on the Prairie" series, "Anne of Green Gables," or "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" has had secret fantasies about the one-room schoolhouse with rows of wood-top desks, boys on one side and girls on the other. The coal­burning potbelly stove in the mid­dle filled with dry cornhusks the children bring. The old McGuffey's Reader textbooks with their ancient spelling lessons and quaint fables. The two outhouses out back, one for boys and one for girls. The slates and chalk at the narrow little desks, where the re­enacting children often crowd two to a seat -not because they need to, but because they like to sit with their friends. 
When the students are all hunched over their slates working diligently on their spelling or sums, the stove is humming, and there are no tourists snapping photos of us, I could swear it really is 1862. 
I'm not sure why I love re-enact­ing, although I certainly do. I plan to keep re-enacting my whole life. Considering I started when I was nine years old, the reasons I do it have certainly changed over time. 
I think it used to just be an excuse to play dress-up. And hon­estly, that's probably still a big part of it. It might be the peace I feel at Naper Settlement Museum, where I work. No ringing phones, no blar­ing music or TV, just quiet after­noons spent knitting, reading aloud, and giving the kids as many recesses as they want. 
But the truth is, I think the real reason I love it is because, for the four or five or six hours that I'm there, I'm living in 1862. Who has­n't wished they could time-travel? Because of my incredible job, I have the rare privilege of living in a different place and time whenev­er I want.

Apostrophes dropped from signs in English town 
LONDON -On the streets of Birmingham, the queen's English is now the queens English. 
England's second-largest city has decided to drop apostrophes from all its street signs, saying they're confusing and old-fashioned. 
But some purists are downright possessive about the punctuation mark. 
It seems that Birmingham officials have been taking a hammer to grammar for years, quietly dropping apos­trophes from street signs since the 1950s. Through the decades, residents have fre­quently launched spirited campaigns to restore the missing punctuation to signs denoting such places as "St. Pauls Square" or "Acocks Green." 
This week, the council made it official, saying it was banning the punctuation mark from signs in a bid to end the dispute once and for all. 
Sister beats up bride at wedding reception 
HEBHON, Ind. -A woman who wasn't invited to her sis­ter's wedding reception showed up anyway and attacked the bride, pulling out clumps of her hair, police said. Annmarie Bricker, 23, of Valparaiso, was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of battery. 
Jeremy Glotzbach told police he was hosting a reception for newlyweds Nicholas Landry and Lori Kappes at his home on Jan. 23 when Bricker, Kappes' sis­ter, attacked Kappes on the front porch. 
Bricker pulled out clumps of Kappes' hair, struck her head and took the bride to the ground during a struggle, according to the Porter County Sheriffs Department.

to reduce the need to carry cash or worry about cab driv­ers changing the a~cepted flat rate of two or three dollars. 
Schmidt and Weber told The Observer they are already working with the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore, and eFollet and a University liaison to negotiate some sort of low­ering of textbook prices. 
One alternative source for buying course materials and "subverting the textbook mop.opoly," Weber said, is a Web site that would list the ISBN numbers of required reading -"the most essential way of finding your book online," she said. 
This idea would require cooperation from Notre Dame professors; Schmidt said many professors have responded positively to the idea. 
Student involvement in cam­pus expansion, particularly at the currently under-construc­tion Eddy St. Commons, is another of the main Schmidt­Weber initiatives. 
"It would be a shame for a strip on Notre Dame-leased property to not have some sort of availability for students," Schmidt said. 
Weber said she hopes the two can "push the limits of student government" by get­ting the whole undergraduate population involved in a cause: The Global Water Initiative. 
"This would be a year-long initiative," she said, involving working with existing campus clubs and their fundraisers. 
"We can sit here and talk about textbook prices ... but we're the University of Notre Dame, we're obviously service­oriented. [ ... ] We're taking one specific initiative and getting the entire student body behind it." 
Laura Burdick and Derek Sanchez 
Burdick and Sanchez, cur­rent Athletic Council co-chairs, said student government has a lot of potential. They want to maximize on that potential by doing more programming activities that "really affect students." 
Burdick, a biology major from Terre Haute, Indiana, liVI;lS in Cavanaugh. Sanchez, a political science and Spanish major with a minor in Latino Studies, lived in Carroll for two years and now lives in Duncan. 
They met freshman year when they sat together at foot­ball games, and got to know each other better on Hall President's Council, when each represented his respective dorm. 
Burdick and Sanchez told The Observer they have sever­al ambitious goals. 
"We are students that want to work for the students," Burdick said. "Not necessarily for the administration, but for the students." 
Their top priority is to create a loan forgiveness program for those who pursue a career in public service. 
"We just realized that tuition is· getting out of control here, and there's not much we can do about that," Sanchez said. 
They want to help students pay for college, and promote public service, by establishing a program that forgives the loans of students who commit to a career in public service. They said they would look into the possibility of outside fund­ing for the venture. 
Burdick and Sanchez are also interested in developing the Athletic Council as a way to "liaison between coaches and the teams and the student body." They also want to expand the current "Gold Rush" program, by providing incentives for students to boost attendance at all Notre Dame sporting events. 
The candidates want to negotiate with the Notre Dame administration and the Notre Dame Security Police (NDSP) to put into place a new disci­plinary system for drinking violations, one in which a first offense would lead to educa­tional development, such as an 
T alcohol assessment, rather than harsher consequences. "On game days, rather than worry about being seen hold­ing a beer, we want NDSP to worry about people that are out of control, starting fights, getting into fights, rather than worry about someone who can't grow a beard holding a beer," Sanchez said. Burdick said she wants stu­dent government to come up with activities that can make a profit, to offset costs for stu­dents. "It's not really fair for a stu­dent to pay for the concert that's coming in the spring if they don't like the band and don't want to go," Burdick said. The Burdick-Sanchez ticket wants to st_art a "tailgate row," an area for all students where they can mingle before football games. 
They said they are ready for the time pressures that come with being the leaders of stu­dent government. 
"This whole process so far has been like a full-time job, and it's definitely doable," Burdick said. "If you have an idea and you want to get it done, you make the time to do it. So I think that we feel very strongly about what we want to get done, so we will do it." 
James McCaughan and Tom Gorski 
McCaughan and Gorski told The Observer that "the most pressing issue," for both stu­dents at Notre Dame and alumni of the University, is the police presence on and off campus. 
"If we are elected, we will do everything we can to make sure students can be comfort­able when they are in situa­tions where in the past they have been afraid of very strict and aggressive disciplinary measures," McCaughan said. 
Their top priority is to per­suade the University and NDSP to scale back how strictly rules are enforced, especially at and before football games. · 
McCaughan, a junior, and Gorski, a sophomore, are roommates in Siegfried. McCaughan is a history and economics major from Key Biscayne, Fla and Gorski is an IT Management major from Omaha, Neb. 
Both were interviewed on TV last fall about tlie police pres­ence in the tailgate area. Gorski said he was inter­viewed as someone beside him was being arrested. 
McCaughan and Gorski also want the University to disre­gard evidence obtained by ille­gal searches and seizures. They want this to extend to cases in which police "are overly aggressive in shutting down an off-campus party." 
The ticket plans to, should they win, move the student government office from the second floor of LaFortune to the first floor of the building to make it more accessible to stu­dents. 
They also want to make a Facebook wall application so students can directly voice their concerns and complaints. 
Establishing an interhall laser tag league is their No. 4 priority, followed by urging student government to official­ly support the DormBooks.com used textbook program, so stu­dents can save money. 
McCaughan said he has not been a part of student govern­ment since fifth grade, but said their ticket still has the experience necessary to lead. 
" I think we can bring in new perspectives to student gov­ernment and we can identify very easily with the student government," he said. 
Their unofficial slogan, they said, is "Men of the people, working for students." 
Luke Lennon and Charlie Harig 
The freshman duo of Luke Lennon and Charlie Harig told The Observer they would "love to be a part of the political system here." 
"We can make some changes that are important to the University ... 'maybe some changes that people don't even realize they need," Lennon, the candidate for student body president said. 
The two Zahm roommates list affirmative action for beautiful women, coating bowls in the dining halls with a lubricant to prevent sticking and a value system for North and South Dining halls because of the difference in the quality of meals. 
Their affirmative action idea "pretty much consists of checking out girls before they attend the University" and giv­ing out scholarships accord­ingly, Lennon said. 
Harig said girls can both gain scholarships after they are admitted, earning what he called "walk-on status," and lose their scholarships for var­ious violations. 
The pair said they feel no one on campus enjoys eating a salad out of four bowls stuck together, so they are proposing adding a position to dining hall staffs that entails keeping the bowls lubricated, which will create a more convenient din­ing experience and help in the cleaning process. 
The Harig-Lennon ticket is relying on word of mouth to get their campaign energized. 
"We talked to everyone who gave us signatures," Lennon said. "Just to be formal, we're going to have posters out there." 
"I feel like everyone wants to vote for us, regardless of what we put up," Harig said. 
The two didn't want to put a limit of how long they'd be in office if elected. 
"Not just three years, not until we graduate," Harig said. 
"We'd be willing to fail out of the same theology class many, many times -every semes­ter," Lennon said. 
"So for infinity," Harig said. 
The first thing on the Zahm ticket's agenda if elected: a parade.

Iraq 
continued from page 1 
Salem said his life before the war was simple and comfortable. He talked about how Americans have a misconceived notion about life in Iraq before the invasion. 
"All that you know about Iraq is from the media but the media is not always correct," Salem said. "The only problem before 2003 was that we lived as a closed country and did not know about anything outside of Iraq." 
Rasheed and Al-Assadi both agreed with Salem that life in Iraq during Saddam Hussein's rule was a time of tranquility. 
"Before the war, there was no religious conflict," Rasheed said. ''I'm a Muslim Sunni and until the war my best friend was a Christian." 
Rasheed and his family stayed in Baghdad during the invasion, but prepared to leave the city at any moment. 
"I remember those three weeks that were just full of bombing and soldiers in the streets," he said. "On April 9, 2003, we turned on the TV and did not believe the reports that American soldiers were really in Baghdad." 
After April 9, everything changed. There was no gas, no electricity, and no safety for any of the city's inhabitants Rasheed said. 
"The situation just kept getting worse each time the government changed," he said. "In 2006, the racism war began and the fear intensified. I got a fake lD that had a different religion and name because I felt threatened because of my Sunni religion."

Restivo also said that they hoped to eventually extend and invitation to all South Bend resi­dents to participate. 
"Once the program has been well-established though, we are looking to reach out to homes in South Bend and include them in the program as well," Restivo said. 
There are a variety of ways in which students can get involved, such as taking time to recycle. 
aluminum cans from the rest of their recycling. 
Also, for students who reside on-campus, there will be dorm­wide e-mails coming soon with more information about partici­pating in the program. In addi­tion, fliers will be posted on dorm recycling receptacles indi­cating those specified for alu­minum collection for the pro­gram. 
Off-campus students can become more involved with the program by contacting Mike the program will be provided with a recycling receptacle for aluminum cans. 
Restivo highlighted that the most important aspect at keep­ing the program alive will be the participation of the student body. 
"This program is a great way to be involved in helping those less fortunate than us and the environment at the same time, and it is so simple," Restivo said.

Rasheed recalls that at the end of 2006, many people left Iraq for Syria or Jordan. 
"All anyone wanted was a sense of safety," he said. 
Randa Al-Assadi, who is also· from Baghdad, remembered the horrible conditions that caused many to suffer. 
"Everything became extremely dangerous," she said. "There were killings and kidnappings and I remember everyone just hoping that in a few months everything would be OK, but that didn't happen. 
"When I remember that feeling I feel so bad, but I accept it because this is our life," she said. 
Al-Assadi said that she applied for the Iraqi Student Project because she had no other means of continuing her education. Despite her distance from her native country, Al-Assadi con­stantly thinks about her fellow Iraqis that remain there. 
''I'm always wondering about my Iraqi brothers and sisters," she said. "We're struggling from the war; the people are strug­gling." 
In spite of the conflict that is still waging in Iraq, all three stu­dents remain hopeful for the future of their country that they love so much. 
"I think my country can heal," Al-Assadi said. "The situation is unstable right now so you can't see the good, but the peace will come and everything will be good like it was before the war. We were able to live together as brothers and sisters for millions of year and we will live that way again someday."

N. Korea warns of war with S. Korea 
SEOUL, South Korea -North Korea warned Sunday that South Korea's con­frontational policies may trigger a war on the divided peninsula, a message coming two days after the communist country vowed to abandon all peace agreements with its southern neighbor. 
llelations between the two Koreas have been strained since conservative President Lee Myung-bak took office nearly a year ago in Seoul, pledging to take a harder line on the North. Tension heightened Friday when the North said it was ditching a nonaggres­sion pact and all other peace accords with South Korea. 
The tension may lead to "an unavoidable military conflict and a war," North Korea's main Hodong Sinmun newspaper said in a commentary carried Sunday by the country's official Korean Central News Agency.

m. governor delivers church message 
CHICAGO -In his first Sunday since being thrust into the chief executive's office, Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn delivered a church service message of service and humility, calling on residents to work together despite chal­lenges. 
'"We have to address each day with new eyes, no grudges,'" Quinn told the congrega­tion of thousands at Salem Baptist Church. "'We always have to learn every day."' 
Quinn did not specifically mention former Gov. Hod Blagojevich, who was booted from office Thursday and faces federal corruption charges. Blagojevich has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. 
Instead, Quinn talked vaguely of his plans for the state and mentioned some attributes he believes a governor should have.

Bill would allow DNA sample at arrest 
INDIANAPOLIS -Collecting DNA could become almost as common for police as col­lecting fingerprints under a bill making its way through the Indiana Senate. 
Senate Bill 24 would allow police to collect DNA from anyone arrested on a felony charge, rather than just those who are con­victed. 
Supporters say adding that DNA to state and federal databases could help solve crimes and potentially prevent them.

Blagojevich relies on father-and-son duo of defense attorneys to evade prison 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Now that he's been ousted from the governor's office, Rod Blagojevich is pinning his hopes of staying out of prison on a father-and-son duo of defense attorneys, one of whom grabbed the limelight at R&B superstar 
R. Kelly's sex tape trial. 
"These are two of the most flamboyant attorneys in town," DePaul University law professor Leonard Cavise says of the team of Sam Adam and his son, Samuel E. Adam. 
Cavise predicts fire­works if Blagojevich goes to trial on federal corrup­tion charges, including allegations that he tried to sell the Senate seat vacat­ed by President Barack Obama. 
Federal prosecutors are expected to obtain an indictment by April. Blagojevich was arrested by FBI agents in December and was booted from office Thursday when a state Senate impeachment trial ended with a 59-0 vote against him.

GOPleaderdoubtssfunulusbillwillpass 
Bruce Springsteen and the E 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday the mas­sive stimulus bill backed by President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats could go down to defeat if it's not stripped of unnecessary spend­ing and focused more on hous­ing issues and tax cut. 
The Senate version of the bill, which topped out at nearly $900 billion, is headed to the floor for debate. The House bill totaled about $819 billion and earned no Republican votes, even though it easily passed the Democratic-controlled House. At some point lawmakers will need to compromise on the competing versions. 
McConnell and other Republicans suggested that the bill needed an overhaul because it doesn't pump enough into the private sector through tax cuts and allows Democrats to go on a spending spree unlikely to jolt the economy. The Republican leader also complained that Democrats had not been as bipartisan in writing the bill as Obama had said he wanted. 

"I think it may be time ... for the president to kind of get a hold of these Democrats in the Senate and the House, who have rather significant majorities, and shake them a little bit and say, 'Look, let's do this the right way,"' McConnell said. "I can't believe that the president isn't embarrassed about the products that have been produced so far." 
For his part, Obama said he is confident Republicans will come around to support the final ver­sion of the legislation. He and Vice President Joe Biden will meet with congressional leaders at the White House on Monday afternoon. 
The president repeated what his top aides and officials have been telling reporters in recent days, that the final package would be close to its objectives -to save or create 3 to 4 mil­lion jobs -and Republicans would be able to back it. 
"I am confident that by the time we have the fmal package on the floor that we are going to see substantial support, and people are going to see this is a serious effort. It has no ear­marks. We are going to be trim­ming out things that are not rei-· evant to putting people back to work right now," Obama said. 
However, he declined to pre­dict how many Senate Republicans might switch par­ties. Biden, a former senior member of the Senate before his election, similarly declined to offer predictions last week in an interview despite his personal phone calls for former col­leagues. 
"Look, the important thing is getting the thing passed," Obama told NBC's Matt Lauer during a live pre-Super Bowl interview. "And I've done extraordinary outreach, I think, to Republicans because they have some good ideas and I want to make sure those ideas are incorporated." 
Obama also that his adminis­tration would announce plans to spend the second $350 billion of a bank bailout after Congress deals with the separate econom­ic recovery plan. 
Under Obama's plan, strained state budgets would receive a cash infusion, projects for roads and other infrastructure would be funded, and "green jobs" in the energy sector would be cre­ated. In its centerpiece tax cut, single workers would gain $500 and couples $1,000, even if they don't earn enough to owe feder­al income taxes. 
Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Hepublican in the Senate, said he was seeing an erosion of support for the bill and suggest­ed that lawmakers should con­sider beginning anew. 
"When I say start from scratch, what I mean is that the basic approach of this bill, we believe, is wrong," Kyl said. 
Among the major changes Kyl said would be needed to gain Republican support in the Senate was the tax rebate for individuals and couples, which he criticized as going to too many people who didn't pay the tax to start with. He also criti­cized the bill for seeking to cre­ate nearly three dozen govern­ment programs and giving states far more money than they need. 
Sen. Dick Durbin, D.-Ill., argued that $1 out of every $3 in the bill goes to tax cuts and defended it as aimed at helping working families. While he con­tended that Democrats were "very open" to Republican pro­posals, he cited only what he said were calls for more money in job-creating public works projects, typically a Democratic priority. 
Sen. Jim DeMint, H-S.C., char­acterized the proposal as "a spending plan. It's not a stimu­lus plan. It's temporary, and it's wasteful." 
Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said the bill was designed to help people who have been damaged in the economic melt­down as well as stimulate the economy. 
"I never saw a tax cut fix a bridge. I never saw a tax cut give us more public transporta­tion. The fact is, we need a mix," Frank said.

take on the Steelers' Ben Roethlisberger. 
Steelers fans were quickly sent on an emotional roller coaster when their team's first touchdown was overturned by a coach's challenge. Fans had to settle for a field goal instead, and they were not too happy. 
"I wish we started off with a bigger lead," senior Emily Toates said. "It would have made the rest of the game a little less unnerving." 
The second quarter had Pittsburgh fans jumping up and down when linebacker James Harrison intercepted a pass at the zero yard line for a 100 yard return for a touch­down with only 18 seconds left on the dock. 
Street Band performed the halftime show, but many stu­dents had to miss it to catch up on homework. 
"''m happy the Steelers are winning," senior Jeff Tisak said. "But it's sad that every­one had to grab homework at halftime." 
When the second half began, however, students put aside their books for another round of excitement. The third quarter was nothing more than a slight confidence boost for the Steelers, but during the fourth quarter students were given a nail-biting finale. 
"The Cardinals put up a good fight," Dzurik said. "But I think the Steelers deserved to win."

No answer at Davos global forum 
OAVOS. Switzerland -Mired in indecision and uncertainty, the world's foremost gather­ing of the best and brightest in government and business failed to come up with any new plan to stem, much less reverse, the global financial meltdown. 
The five-day World Economic Forum in this Swiss alpine resort wrapped up Sunday in the same atmosphere of doom and gloom that it began, with a realization that the depth of the crisis is still unknown and the solution remains elusive. 
"Everybody's lost in Davos," said Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. 
"No one seems to have a clear understand­

 ing of how big this crisis is and what we need to do to get out of it." he told AP. "My own view is that you really need to do a fundamen­tal reexamination of the whole global system to see what went wrong, and nobody here is yet ready to ask these kinds of fund.amental questions in Davos." 
Housing bust hits NC farm town 
WEST JEFFERSON. N.C. -When this Appalachian town's light-switch plant went dark. fortunes dimmed for Jeff and Amanda Ruegsegger, and hundreds of their neighbors. 
No mo~e Sunday lunches at the Mexican restaurant between morning and evening church: they now pack sandwiches. No mote saving for retirement: they tapped Jeff's 401 (k) to pay down a home-equity line of credit. The health insurance is gone, too, replaced by prayers that the Ruegsegger's and their two teenage children stay healthy. 
"There's a feeling of worthlessness," said Jeff. a former tool-and-die maker. A severance package is helping, but the lack of jobs could · force the family to move. 
In small towns like West Jefferson across the country, factories and families had thrived on the back of the housing boom. Now, employers are fighting for survival and laid-off workers are conserving cash. 


Banks sought foreign workers 
AP investigation reveals visas sought by banks increased by one-third despite layoffs 
Associated PresS 
SANTA CLARA, Calif. ­Major U.'S. banks sought government permission to bring thousands of foreign workers into the country for high-paying jobs even as the system was melting down last year and Americans were getting laid off, accord­ing to an Associated Press review of visa applications. 
The dozen banks now receiving the biggest rescue packages, totaling more than $150 billion, requested visas for more than 21.800 foreign workers over the past six years for positions that ineluded senior vice presi­dents, corporate lawyers, junior investment analysts and human resources spe­cialists. The average annual salary for those jobs was $90,721, nearly twice the median income for all American households. 
As the economic collapse worsened last year -with huge numbers of bank employees laid off-the numbers of visas sought by the dozen banks in AP's analysis increased by nearly one-third, from 3,258 in the 2007 budget year to 4,163 in fiscal 2008.

Energy security principles 
Austria and Germany hate nuclear energy. They hate it. What radiation did not reach them during the Chernobyl incident was supplemented by the radiation of bad PR that swept through eastern Western Europe. Austria's two exist­ing power plants have never been put to use due to the overwhelming sentiment against their installment into the grid in a 1978 referendum, almost a full decade before Chernobyl. The opposition is deeply rooted. 
And yet, thanks to the Russian giant natural gas supplier Gazprom, in the last few weeks nuclear power has been one of the main topics of dis­cussion in every Austrian newspaper, blog, television news, university com­mon space, coffee shop, etc. 
The aftermath of the early January scare from Gazprom's holding hostage large amounts of natural gas flow not only to the Ukraine, but also to Europe is still resonating strongly. For two weeks, 90 percent of Gazprom 's natural gas normally flowing to Austria was cut off, and many other European countries received none from the supplier. 
Such a drastic cutoff reawakened, yet again, Austrians and other Europeans.to th'tlir frailty in energy sustainability matters. The economy and lifestyles of this western, wealthy, unquestionably industrialized country with a standard of living that ranks in the top 15 in the world is completely reliant on a country with whose poli­tics it disagrees. Sound familiar? 
The cutoff, much like the high oil prices of last summer here in America, brought up again the

increasingly important topic of energy security. How can a "powerful" nation be brought to its knees by one closed pipeline'? By the rising pric8s of one single commodity'? That is not securi­ty, under any circumstances. 
But with the much-needed concept of "Energy Seeurity" comes other dan­gers. Secure, but at what price? Most Austrians hold the opposition of nudear energy as one of their corn beliefs. Removing myself momentarily from the argument for or against nuclear power, the Austrians them­selves believn that it would spell cer­tain dangers for their nation if they were to allow such plants to proceed. Their eountry holds it as derogatory to the environment, present and future, to proceed with nuelear ener­gy. 
When dons Energy Security hamper' environmental protection? Often the two are interlinked, can play off each other and promote one another simul­taneously. Henewable energy develop­ment not only helps our energy secu­rity, but also has the potential to improve air quality, provide long-term health benefits, lessen carbon dioxide emissions and minimize invasive and environmentally detrimental mining techniques. 
However, Energy Security often becomes a force that hampers envi­ronmental goals. Austrians who do not choose to build nuclear power plants have they the option. Desperate needs for Energy Security force them into comprising their values. Plans for dams and hydro-power plants are popping up a.Jlq_~ver Europr,·in places once valued for their relatively untouched ecosystems. 
We in America are all too familiar with such compromises. In the name of Energy Security, it's okay to move mountains, displace elk, irretrieyably ruin oceanic ecosystems or deplete already strained soil. Granted, the last administration often tried to switch heaven for hell in the name of securi­ty, insisting it was a good idea, but the bipartisan rush to wean off of foreign oil and gas runs the risk of depleting the lasting health of our country and people, a resource that is nonrenew­able. 
We must approach the concept of Energy Security while keeping in mind what we may be sacrificing for it. Drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf would result in a cumulative 1.6 per­cent greater domestic crude oil pro­duction by the year 2030, hardly enough to justify the permanent dam­age to the ocean ecosystem that would ensue -not to mention the billions to fund the drilling. And yet, as far as legislation suggestions go, it has been at the top of the solution list as of late. 
In a time when we are pressed for money, struggling for solutions to energy problems and slowly disengag­ing ourselves from foreign entangle­ments, it is important to remember the long-term effects of our actions. Unlik~ our politics, we cannot instan­taneously -or often, ever-reverse the damage we inflict upon the envi­ronment. Energy Security can mean a co9perative relationship between environmental and energy problems, but hastily striving towards security cuts corners that our earth can't afford not to acknowledge. Slowly shifting our dependence and supple­menting development of renewables with positive diplomatic relations is the only way to attain lasting Energy Security, whether in Austria, America or even the oil powers themselves.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

We -won't ... 
In response to Bob Kessler's Jan. 30 letter "We are...," I need to voice my discontent. While I have noticed that we are often times told that we are special and whatnot, by chanting "We are ND," I do not see how this can possibly be taken as arrogance. The Northwestern chant is arrogant, true, but through chanting who we are, who we represent, we are not in any way or form condescending those who have beaten us. I, for one, am saying who I am with pride, saying they have not beaten down the spirit that embodies the campus. 
I believe that this cheer is much better than saying words such as "Suck it, (insert lesser school's title)," yet you do not mention anything towards this. You probably say that it is in the sport of athleticism, of college events, to try to irritate the other team so as to give us the upper hand. Yet I guaran­tee that hearing a student body insulting the entire University due to a simple sporting event creates more hatred than by chanting "We are ND" at the end of a game. At the USC game, the marching band and the fans were obviously jeered at, booed and were the victims of numerous insults, chants and gestures. Yet what was more irritating was when the Trojan fans, at the end of the game, began chanting that their next opponents sucked, that they didn't stand a chance. May we remind them of the Oregon State game, thereby proving anything is possible. 
Another way to be condescending to a college happened at our very stadium by Syracuse when they won. They stood in the center of the marching band, jeering at our family as we sang our Alma Mater. To me, that is the most disgusting dis­play of arrogance in the face of an opponent. Our chant ­and there are many who agree with me -is to unite the family once we have lost. It is to remind us that there are things that will happen, and we must take them in stride. No, we cannot win everything, we are guaranteed to lose other events, but it is to remind ourselves and the opposing team that we are a family. They may have won the game, but "We are ND!"

Tomorrow's citizens will pay 
for today's spending 
Last November, voters elected Barack Obama as president, decisively repudi­ating the failed policies of the Bush administration and ushering in an era of change and reform. Or at least that's what they thought they were doing. Less Ben Linskey than a month into Obama's presidency, Guest it's becoming alarm­Columnist ingly clear that many of the most misguided policies of the Bush years are here to stay. Thousands of Americans, suffering the effects of a deepening recession, are hopeful that the new administration will adopt a new course and lead our nation out of the present economic crisis. President Obama, however, seems determined to follow in the footsteps of his predeces­sor. 
On Feb. 13 oflast year, George W. Bush signed the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, intended to ward off a looming recession; predictably, the bill accom­plished little more than tacking $152 billion onto the federal deficit. Less than a year later, faced with a worsen­ing economic outlook, President Obama has somehow convinced himself and his political allies that the most prudent course of action is to imitate the Bush administration's policies on a grossly magnified scale, this time lobbing over $800 billion at the problem. The most immediate difficulty with this "stimu­lus" plan is that it simply won't work. In the 1930s, Franklin Delano Roosevelt oversaw the creation of thousands of new agencies and government jobs, but no amount of federal prodigality could lift the United States out of the Great Depression. In a recent analysis of Depression-era economic programs posted on the Cato Institute website, Regulation magazine editor Thomas Firey concluded that "the New Deal did little as an economic stimulus." There is no reason to believe that the Obama administration's "new New Deal" will be any more effective. It is high time we recognize the sheer futility of govern­ment attempts to manipulate the econo­my. The greatest danger in this latest stimulus program, though, lies not in its ineffectiveness, but in the costs it will impose on future generations. 
The national debt presently stands at over $10.5 trillion-over $30,000 per 
U.S. citizen. The Bush and Obama stim­ulus bills, combined with the recent wave of bailouts for failing, inefficient corporations, bear a combined price tag well in excess of $1 trillion . These numbers are almost too large to fully comprehend, but the federal debt is not an abstract tally; it is a series of enor­mous financial obligations to a variety of foreign governments and private citi­zens, all of whom collect interest on their investments each year. Last year alone, the federal government paid out a whopping $412 billion to its creditors. The Congressional Budget Office recently calculated that the stimulus package heralded by the Obama admin­istration will entail an additional $347 billion in interest payments over the next decade. 

Deficit spending imposes a steadily growing burden on taxpayers. The gov­ernment can account for its debt in only two ways. It can raise taxes, preying on the productivity of U.S. citizens, or it can simply print more money, leading to the hidden, insidious phenomenon of inflation. The latter option is more prevalent, as the disastrous conse­quences of inflation are not immediate­ly apparent. (Incidentally, proponents of social justice who support government spending programs would do well to remember that the costs of inflation are distributed unevenly and often do the most harm to the poor.) Politicians seize on the opportunity to impose long-term costs in return for the illusion of short­term benefits. 
The ultimate, and most pernicious, consequences of reckless spending are seldom discussed. It is future genera­tions, not current taxpayers, who will bear the brunt of the federal debt, and politicians in Washington have no qualms about burdening U.S. citizens not yet born with trillions of dollars of obligations in return for immediate political gain. The great tragedy of the recent wave of stimulus bills and feder­al bailouts is that those who will be most affected by these policies do not even get a vote. The men and women who will inherit the national debt didn't elect George Bush, Barack Obama or 
LETIERS TO THE EDITOR 
Why is Notre Da111e involved in the ar111s trade? 

Last semester, we delivered a letter to Father John Jenkins and the representatives of the Career Center ask­ing them to clarify our University's position on what com­panies we allow on our campus to recruit our students. More than a month later, Fr. Jenkins took the step to meet with us to discuss our concerns. In his office, he listened to us and asked us fair questions. Overall, while we may not have reached the same conclusions about who should or should not be endorsed by the University, Fr. Jenkins left us with an understanding that his administration would take the issue seriously. 
At last week's Winter Career Expo, Raytheon again sought to recruit Notre Dame students. We are distressed to find that, as of yet, no action has been taken by either our University's administration or the Career Center to clarify explicitly and publicly the standards to which we hold participants in the career fairs. Despite the efforts of students in the past three consecutive years, the University has yet to publicly and decisively respond to the critique that Raytheon represents a clear and very serious disre­gard for the stated mission to our University. 
The mission statement of the University of Notre Dame specifically calls our community to develop a "disciplined sensibility to the poverty, injustice and oppression that burden the lives of so many." Such a mission hopes to make our University a place where "learning becomes service to justice." These admirable goals are put into practice in many ways. For example, more than 80 per­cent of the student body will be involved in some sort of service or community work in their time at Notre Dame. Our commitment to justice is real at Notre Dame because it is rooted in our mission. 
But when students begin to think about where they can take their interest for justice and service that they learned here at Notre Dame, they are too often presented with a contradictory picture. Organizations like Raytheon serve a narrow conviction that place national self-interest and vio­lent military power above the calling -found in our own mission statement-of "human solidarity and concern for the common good." They inherently contradict what we as a university community have placed as our true mission. 
Currently Raytheon is the world's fifth-largest weapons manufacturer. In 2008, Raytheon's value boasted to $24.7 
billion after an annual increase of almost $5 billion. As MSNBC Business wrote recently: "Like other defense com­panies, Waltham, Massachusetts-based Raytheon's profits have been boosted in recent years by record defense spending." That is, as the United States and its allies drop more bombs on places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Gaza, Raytheon's profits climb steadily. For Raytheon, the more war and insecurity the better. As profits for Raytheon soar, the people who live where Raytheon's products finally land see only death, destruction and a broken future. 
The arms trade is an undeniably profitable business for Raytheon. But in Aug. 2006, to protest Raytheon's involve­ment in providing the cluster bombs and missiles used in the campaign against the people of Lebanon, nine men from Derry, Northern Ireland occupied a Raytheon office and were detained for trespassing. On June 11, 2008 a jury released the entire group in a unanimous verdict. Eamonn McCann, one of the men detained, stated: "We believe that one day the world will look back on the arms trade as we look back today on the slave trade and won­der how it came about that such evil could abound in respectable society." 
We call on the Career Center and the University Administration to examine more closely who we allow onto our campus to recruit our students. We ask that each company and organization, regardless of their national reputation or alumni connection, be judged for their respect and adherence to our University's mission state­ment. We call on the Administration and the Career Center to make an honest, public statement and clearly define the position of our University on the presence of Raytheon at our University.

any member of the U.S. Congress. The federal government's longstanding poli­cy of burdening the unborn with debt is little more than outright theft, closer to mob rule than democracy. 
Sadly, the very nature of government and electoral politics encourages politi­cians to exploit the powerless for the sake of enriching present majorities. The good news is that there is still time for our nation to escape from the end­less spiral of spending, bailouts and debt. But to do so, Americans must reject the ineffective and immoral poli­cies offered by Democrats and Republicans in Washington. Voters com­prise the greatest -perhaps the only -check on such abuses of federal power. George W. Bush, Barack Obama and their colleagues in Congress have demonstrated that neither the left nor the right can be trusted to administer the powers of government responsibly. Future generations will hold us accountable for the policies we endorse today. It's time for Americans to reject unrestrained federal spending and acknowledge the failure of the major parties to produce responsible, moral governance.

With Oscar season right around the corner, one is reminded of all the great films that have garnered the prestigious Academy Award for Best Picture in the past. Epic works of film-making such Mark Witte as "The Lord 
of the Rings: Assistant Return of the Scene Editor King," older, classic favorites such as "The Sound of Music" or films that. in my opinion, really didn't deserve to win anything, like the abominable. box-office spectacle "Titanic." 
But Oscar season also reminds us of why we love movies, especial­ly those movies which never win awards, and really shouldn't. Yet some of those flicks are our per­sonal favorites. I can think of one that sticks out most for me. 
When I turned 14, a friend of mine gave me as a present the Coen brothers' cult hit, "The Big Lebowski." As a teenager some­what sheltered from R-rated movies by overprotective parents, the fact that I was watching some­thing prohibited had me grinning before the movie even started. And when it did, I laughed nearly the entire 117 minutes. 
Yet at the time, my being humored was at best a product of the film's unique, bawdy plot, its eccentric characters. goofy ruses and its 200-plus f-bombs (though some claim the number to be clos­er to 398). In fact, it would be four years-during my freshman com­position class -before I seriously cogitated on what made the film so entertaining. 
The film's premise starts otl' sim­ply. Jeff "The Dude" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is mistaken by a pair of thugs for the extremely wealthy and crippled philanthropist Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston). These thugs knock the Dude around before proceeding to uri­nate on his favorite rug, a rug that according to the Dude's volatile bowling buddy Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), "really tied the room together." 
The Dude then sets out to seek recompense for his damaged upholstery, getting himself stuck in a complicated web of ransom­seeking Nihilists, porn kings, play­boy wives. raging feminists and inept private detectives along the way. 
But the film is more than its far­cical, bumbling plot portends it to be. 
My freshman year composition class focused on representations of gender, class and race in media. In order to demonstrate contempo­rary critiques of the sub jed, the instructor chose to screen "The Big Lebowksi" as an example, and that's when I began to decipher what the Conn Brothers were nml­ly doing with their lilm. 
"The Big Lebowski" provides maswline (and feminine) role models that no one would willingly want to associate with. Most of these representations are done through extremes. 
The Dude's hardly potty-trained antagonists are completely bone­headed, mistaking the debt of a millionaire philanthropist's playboy wife to be associated with the unemployed, Welfare-dependent Dude. 
The Nihilists, who later pretend to kidnap the philanthropist's wife and then extract ransom from the Dude, turn out to be spineless, cowardly bullies when confronted by Walter in a showdown outside the bowling alley. 
Contrasting their representation is that of' Walter himself. a r.harar.­ter negatively ampcd and exuding in testosterone. A Vietnam veteran with an exceptionally short temper, Walter comically blunders around the Dude's situation throughout the film, constantly making matters worse for the Dude by attempting to tix them with violence and war tactics. At one point. while interro­gating a teenager who stole and crashp,d the Dude's car, WaJtp,r becomp,s fed up with the boy's refusal to answer any questions and takes a crowbar to what he believes is the boy's brand new r.ar. The car actually belongs to a neighbor, who comes out hooting and hollering and takes a baseball bat to the Dude's vehicle, bashing its windshield. 
In between these p,xtremes of cowardice and belligerence, but still in the negative realm of mas­culinity, fall the Dude and his buddy Donny's powerless repre­sentations. 
The Dude, because of his pas­sivism, laziness, alcoholism and even hazed stupidity, lacks the power to rationally communicate or combat injustice and oppres­sion. His inability to solve his own problems, depicted through his constant manipulation by and abuse from other characters, forces him to turn to Walter lor help. 

In the film's final showdown, the Nihilists set fire to the Dude's car, destroying it. The car then becomes a metaphor for the Dude's impuissance. Throughout the story it is shot, crashed, stolen, used as a urinal, crashed again, assaulted with a bat and finally burned. Like the car, the Dude has no control over the events happen­ing to or around him. 
Donny is even more powerless, despite being the best bowler of the bunch. Every time he speaks, Walter immediately contradicts him or to yells at him to "Shut up!" 
By providing extreme masculine representations associated with defeat and failure, "The Big Lebowski" encourages its viewers to eome up with their own concep­tion of \llasculinity somewhere between those extremes, and with­out the help of a traditionally rep­resented hero. 
If you look for a literal hero with­in the film, you will not lind one, I hope. Instead, the film works to promote a dill"erent type of viewr ing, a viewing where individuals create and construct their own conception of gender rather than relying on what they see to form their masculine role models. 
The film contains another char­acter extreme, the story's out-of­place narrator. Dressed in full r.ow­boy garb, what the Old West would consider the height of manliness and masculinity-in other words, a perfect extreme -the narrator first introduces the Dude by posing a question: "Sometimes there's a man. I won't say a hero, 'cause, what's a hero?" 
While the narrator may not know the answer to his question, neither may we, and that's some­thing to think and laugh about. 
For me, "The Big Lebowski" will always have a special place in my heart. Since first watching it eight years ago, I have shown it to numerous friends and family. And whether or not they've understood the film's gender critique, we've shared laughter at the Dude's expense nonetheless. 
But hey, at least the guy is housebroken.

The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, The Clash, The Ramones, Bruce Springsteen. 
Can the list go on and, more importantly, do we deserve to let it? Would adding James DuBray Nirvana to that list 
be like blaspheming Scene Writer Mary, the M.O.G.? Does anyone really love rock and roll anymore? Why would they? 
It's been said there exists a rock and roll canon. There are a select few artists who only Noel Gallagher, moron that he is, would dare to cross. Sure, they've all had their missteps. Neil Young writes a terrible album about every five years. Dylan could­n't escape the 1980s. Mick Jagger refuses to put his Megalodon away, and Springsteen has tried to make the same record about seven too many times. 
Yet, these artists have all blown the minds and broke the hearts of baby boomers. Not just the cats, too. From hedge fund managers to Neomarxists, everyone sings along to "Under My Thumb." Their kids have benefited from growing up to melodic acoustic numbers and avant-garde crashes. These story­tellers have bashed exes, while also swooning at first sights. 
Sure, tons of songs have been misinter­preted, bastardized and made cliche. "Born In The U.S.A." is played on the Fourth, while half of "Sgt. Pepper" is used in cell phone commercials. Despite these problems, traditions have grown as 25 year-olds and their mothers cry simultane­ously when "In My Life" adorns first dances. Enough evidence -a canon exists, and it means something. 
Now to the bloody point: Do the children of baby boomers have, or even deserve, a spot at the table? One thing is certain: there will never be another consensus top dog. For one, rock and roll exists on the idea of community: the feeling that there is something about both being young, and having a sense of alienation. Music pro­vides an oasis, a place to exist oul<;ide of mainstream society. 
The idea is still inside every young per­son. The fairytales drugged us (Thank you, Conor Oberst). There is no Prince Charming or glass slipper. 
Yet, this sort of introspection seems rare in today's society. In a world based so much on corporate-driven definitions of success, rock and roll probably doesn't have a place. Drugs don't open the mind;

Forget about relationships, friends, or discovering something about yourself. Put on your tie, check today's calendar on your Blackberry, and network, network, network. Today's Woodstock would be full of people exchanging Linkedln accounts. 
Let's deviate from the negativity for a second. The 1980s gave some contribu­tions to the list, although they were few and far between. Springsteen and Petty made some great albums, while Billy Joel established himself as a bigger joke than Neil Diamond. Yet, ltE.M. created some­thing that would become alt-rock-what­ever that means anymore. The '90s used a suicide and a surge of anger to produce grunge, a rock spin-off that today is even funnier than it is off-putting. Can you imagine how Cobain would feel at an Ever last show? Apologetic, I'm sure. 
Flash to today, and the 1990s seem like more of a breeding ground than anything else. Radiohead belongs in the conversa­tion for a couple reasons. One, tl1ey have followed in the tradition of the greats by never settling. When "OK Computer" was crowned king, Thorn Yorke and the boys. responded by kicking out the guitars. When politics suddenly beeame a popular song topic, Radiohead made "In Rainbows," one of their more apolitical records to date, and relea<;ed it for, well, whatever you wanted to pay. 
Just like the children of the '90s discov­ered "Exile" over a double Whiskey Coke, so will some of the children of the future find "Kid A" and "Yankee," and maybe even 'The College Dropout." Yet, they probably will come at these records much more earnestly than their parent.<; rame to their own parents' vinyl. 
Consensus may be out of the picture, but great musicians aren't. Radiohead, Wilco, Kanye West. That's what I think we've got so far. Contenders exist all over the board, including The Decemberists, My Morning Jacket, lil Wayne and The White Stripes. Yet these artists have a long, long way to go. 
Let's just hope that Jack Johnson and Coldplay eventually get the Neil Diamond treatment. That's how we'II know they "getit."

AUSTRALIAN OPEN 

Nadal beats Federer for Australian Open title 
Top-ranked player claims Men's Singles championship in five sets; Becomes first Spaniard to win title 

Associated Press 
MELBOURNE, Australia ­Rafael Nadal held off Roger Federer in another five-set Grand Slam final, keeping Pete Sampras' record of 14 major titles intact for now. 
Nadal became the first Spanish man to win the Australian Open, beating Federer 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (3). 3­6, 6-2 in a momentum­swinging, 4-hour, 22-minute final that finished just after midnight on Sunday. 
Federer, trying to equal Sampras' record, sobbed at the trophy presentation. 
"Maybe I'll try later. God, it's killing me," Federer said, crying. He returned to congratulate Nadal within minutes, saying: "You deserved it. You played a fantastic final." 
Top-ranked Nadal, who has won five of the seven Grand Slam finals they've contested, now has a major on hard courts to go with his titles on clay and grass. 
He's the only man capable of a Grand Slam this season, 40 years after Australian great Rod Laver last won all four majors in one season. 
"Roger, sorry for today. I really know how you feel right now," Nadal said. "Remember, you're a great 
CLASSIFIEDS 
champion, you're one of the best in history. You're going to improve on the 14 of Sampras." 
Nadal collected the trophy from Laver, on the court that was named in the great Australian's honor, and put his arm around Federer. 
"To receive this trophy from Rod Laver is a dream for me," he said. "Rod, thanks very much. It was an amazing two weeks for me." 
Nadal advanced to the final after holding off fellow Spanish left-bander Fernando Verdasco on Friday in 5 hours, 14 min­utes -the longest match in the tournament's history. 
Federer had a straight­sets win over Andy Roddick the previous night, but said the difference in prepara­tion had no influence on the final. 
He said the fact he'd missed the Sampras record at a tournament he's won three times didn't make the loss any worse or easier to take. 
"Honestly, no," he said. "I mean, it's more like, in the first moment you're disap­pointed, you're shocked, you're sad, you know, then all of a sudden it over­whelms you. 
"The problem is you can't 
go in the locker room and just take it easy and take a cold shower. You're stuck out there. It's the worst feel­ing.... it's rough." 
Federer, so dominant when he won three of the four majors in 2006 and 2007, has now lost finals on three different surfaces to Nadal. 
He hasn't given up hope of beating the 22-year-old Spaniard. 
"For sure," he said. "I did­n't spend 4% hours out there (not) believing it." 
Nadal has four consecutive titles on clay at Holand Garros and beat Federer on grass in a five-set epic at Wimbledon last year. 
He is 13-6 overall against Federer and ended the Swiss star's 237-week streak at No. 1 last year after claim­ing the Beijing Olympic gold medal. 
Federer, who turned around that season with a 
U.S. Open title, saved two championship points from 15-40 in the eighth game of the fifth set but sent a fore­hand long on the third match point. 
Nad~l flopped onto his back, then got up and raced to shake hands. 
The players put their arms around the other's shoulders at the net as they walked off the court. 

Although Federer actually won one more point -174­173 -his serve let him down all too frequently. He conneeted on only 51 per­cent of his first serves, and it seemed as if all of his six double-faults eame at criti­eal times. 
And as the pressure ratch­eted up in the fifth set, it was Federer who wilted, not Nadal. Federer had six win­ners and 14 unforeed errors in the set, while Nadal had just two unforced errors and dropped only three points in four service games. 
Federer was only able to convert 6 of 19 breakpoint chances. Nadal converted 7 of 16. 
Both players started tight, committing uncharacteristie errors. Knowing that weak shots would be punished, they were pushing the lim­its. 
They exchanged se rviee breaks in the first two games. Normally calm on court, Federer pumped his fist after breaking for a 4-2 lead only to double-fault when facing break point in the next game. 
Nadal got the key break with Federer serving at 5-5. The crowd was stunned when the Swiss smacked a forehand wide on an easy short ball to make it 15-40, and Nadal followed with a forehand passing shot win­ner, then held for the set. 
With Nadal seemingly get­
ting to everything and rip­ping winners, Federer was looking tentative and hesi­tating to charge the net. 
But he started putting win­ners together and cutting his mistakes in the second set. After Nadal broke for a 4-3 lead, Federer broke the Spaniard's next two service games, taking a 5-3 lead after converting his fifth break point of the game. He then held to take the set. 
Then the match intensi­fied. 
Amid a series of rallies lasting more than 20 shots, Nadal saved six break points in his last two service games in the third· set, and Federer fended off a set point while serving at 5-6. 
A lunging backhand volley winner gave Nadal a 6-3 lead in the tiebreaker, earn­ing him chants of "Rafa!" and Federer double-faulted. 
Federer saved five break points while serving at 2-2 in the fourth set, then broke Nadal in the next game for a 4-2 edge. 
He closed with a service winner to even it at two sets apiece. 
Nadal broke Federer for a 3-1 lead and the clock ticked past midnight in the next game, taking the tourna­ment into a third week. 
It was the first Australian Open men's final to go to five sets since Mats Wilander beat Pat Cash in 1988, the first at Melbourne Park.

Notre Dame to play in indoor chan1pionship 
By ALEX BARKER 
Sports Writer 
The Irish punched their ticket to the ITA National Indoor championships with a 4-1 victo­ry over No. 14 Arkansas in the finals Of the ITA qualifying tour­nament Sunday in Fayetteville, Ark. 
The No. 1-ranked doubles squad of senior Kelcy Tefft and freshman Kristy Frilling led Notre Dame off with an 8-1 blowout victory over the No. 8 doubles squad from Arkansas. Shortly after, the doubles team of freshman Shannon Matthews and junior Colleen Rielley clinched the match's doubles point with an 8-5 victory over their opponents. 
In singles play, after Notre Dame had dropped the first match to fall into a 1-1 tie, the Irish strung together three straight victories from sopho­more Kristin Rafael, junior Cosmina Ciobanu and Matthews to seal the match and advance into the round of 16. 
In Saturday's first round 
matchup, No. 17 Notre Dame 
swept No. 44 Pepperdine 5-0 to 
advance to Sunday's final. 
The Irish rolled through the doubles competiti~n taking all three matches without dropping more than three games in either match. In doubles com­petition, Tefft and Frilling were strong once again improving to 16-1 on the year with an 8-2 victory over the squad from Pepperdine. 
The singles matches offered more of the same from the Irish. Frilling got the Irish off to a good start downing her oppo­nent 6-0, 6-1 to put the Irish up 2-0. After Ciobanu claimed .another victory for the Irish, Rafael and junior Kali Krisik stepped up and notched wins to 
seal the 5-0 victory.

Irish vvin one, lose one at ITA National Invite 
By KATE GRABAREK 
Sports Wri rer 
No. 32 Notre Dame dropped its first match of two on the weekend to No. 12 Tulsa at the ITA National Indoors. 
The Irish dropped the dou­bles points with two 8-4 losses at one and three doubles. 
Tulsa's fourth-ranked doubles team of Arnau Bruges and Philip Stevens were able to take down the Irish's No. 37 ranked team of senior Brett Helgeson and sophomore Tyler Davis. 
At three doubles freshman Niall Fitzgerald and sophomore Matt Johnson fell to Alberto Sottocorno and Ashley Watling by the same score. 
"Casey Watt and Niall Fitzgerald are great shot mak­ers," Irish coach Bobby Bayliss said. "Sam Keeton has the ability to flat out rip the ball from the back court. Each has skills that rank up there with some of the better players we have had here.· The question with our guys is whether or not they can each adopt the prac­tice and daily life habits." 
At No. 2 doubles, freshman Casey Watt and sophomore Steven Havens were able to defeat Marko Ballok and Ross Cunningham in an 8-1 win. 
Fitzgerald was able to earn a win at singles over Watling by a score of 6-1, 6-4. Keeton con­tinued his unbeaten spring sea­son improving to 4-0 with a 6­2, 6-2 win over Ballok which moved the overall match score to 2-1 in Notre Dame's favor. 
The Irish could not hold on, losing at one, two and four sin­gles to lose the match 4-2. 
No. 112 sophomore Dan Stahl was not able to finish his match against No. 91 Stephens which would have finished in a third set. 
Notre Dame v. Texas Tech 
In their consolation match, the Irish were able to take down the No. 20 team in the nation, Texas Tech. 
Again at No. 3 doubles Fitzgerald and Johnson were able to come out on top in this match defeating David Gonzalez and Milos Kustudija by a score of 8-4. 
Helgeson and Davis fell again in this match losing to the No. 7 team of Raony Carvahlo and Christian Rojmar 8-5. 
Watt and Havens won at No. 2 doubles by a score of 9-7. 
"Fitzgerald is brimming with talent," Bayliss said. "The No. 5-6 spots will likely come from a nucleus of Tyler Davis, Sam Keeton, David Anderson and Niall Fitzgerald, with Matt Johnson right there with them. Davis and Keeton are lefties, Anderson is very solid." 
Keeton was able to defeat Gonzalez by a score of 7-6 (8), 7-5 in the first match finished. Keeton's record is now 5-0 on the young season. 
Havens was able to defeat Sinisa Markovic by a score of 7­6(4)7-5 
Watt was able to win at No. 4 singles over Michael Breier by a score of 2-6, 7-5, 6-~ to clinch the match for the Irish. 
Helgeson,  Stahl,  and  
Fitzgerald's  matches  went  
unfinished.  

The Irish will now host the Duke Blue Devils and Toledo on Feb. 8 at the Eck Tennis Center. Duke will begin at noon and Toledo will begin at 6.

FENCING 

Women top No. 1 Penn St. 
By MICHAEL BLASCO Sports Writer 

Notre Dame's No. 1 men's fencing team (13-0) and No. 2 women's fencing team (12-2) combined for an 11-0 record at day one of the Northwestern Duals this weekend in Evanston, Ill. Both squads posted vietories over top-ranked Penn State teams. 
The men turned in wins over Johns Hopkins (23-4), Northwestern (20-7), Cleveland State (24-3), No. 10 North Carolina (21-6), and Penn State (14-13), who cur­rently are tied with the Irish atop the USFCA poll.  
On the women's side, the team went 6-0 with wins against John's Hopkins (25-2), Penn State (19-8), No. 8 Temple (19-8), Farleigh Dickinson (24-3), Lawrence (25-2) and Wayne State (23­
4). 

The teams' early suceess has established the young Notre Dame fencers as one of the toughest squads in the country, and Irish coach Janusz Bednarski has his eyes set on his third national championship in seven years with the program. 
The highlight of the first day of competition was the men's team's 14-3 bout against rival Penn State. Holding a narrow 1:~-12 lead late in the match, Bednarski made a late substi­epeeist Ewa Nelip, foilist Hayley Reese, and sabre Eileen Hassett each went undefeated at 3-0 in the match, with Reese's second victory against the 2007 National Champion, sopho­more foilist Doris Willette.

Associated Press 
male athlete of the year, and his city before Sunday's game 

Olympic great Michael Phelps acknowledged "regrettable" behavior and "bad judgment" after a photo in a British newspa­per Sunday showed him inhaling from a marijuana pipe. 
In a statement to The Associated Press, the swimmer who won a record eight gold medals at the Beijing Games did not dispute the authenticity of the exclusive picture published Sunday by the tabloid News of the World. 
"I engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrat­ed bad judgment," Phelps said in the statement released by one of his agents. 'Tm 23 years old and despite the successes I've had in the pool, I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way, not in a man­ner people have come to expect from me. For this, I am sorry. I promise my fans and the public it will not happen again." 
News of the World said the pic­ture was taken during a November house party while Phelps was visiting the University of South Carolina. During that trip, he attended one of the school's football games and received a big ovation when he was introduced to the crowd. 
While the newspaper did not specifically allege that Phelps was smoking pot, it did say the pipe is generally used for that purpose and anonymously quoted a party­goer who said the Olympic cham­pion wa.<; "out of control from the moment he got there." 
The U.S. Olympic Committee said it was "disappointed in the behavior recently exhibited by Michael Phelps," who was select­ed the group's sportsman of the feat in Beijing -breaking Mark Spitz's 36-year-old record for most gold medals in an Olympics -was chosen as the top story of 2008. 
"Michael is a role model, and he is well aware of the responsibili­ties and accountability that come with setting a positive example for others, particularly young peo­pie," the USOC said in a state­ment. "In this instance, regret­tably, he failed to fulfill those responsibilities." 
The party occurred nearly three months after the Olympics while Phelps was taking a long break from training, and this apparently would have no impact on the eight golds he won at Beijing. He has never tested positive for banned substances and even agreed to extra testing before the games. 
Marijuana is viewed differently from performance-enhancing drugs, according to David Howman, executive director of the World Anti-Doping Agency. An athlete is subject to WADA sane­tions only for a positive test that occurs during competition peri­ods. 
"We don't have any jurisdic­tion," Howman said. "It's not banned out of competition. It's only if you test positive in compe­tition." 
Phelps returned to the pool a couple of weeks ago to begin preparations for this summer's world championships in Rome. He plans to take part in his first post-Olympics meet in early March, a Grand Prix event in Austin, Texas.

Belles drop close tnatch in final event 
By ERIC PRISTER Sports Writer 
In their second to last meet of the season, the Belles fell to the Kalamazoo Hornets 155-145 in a match decided by the last event. 
Coming into the 400-yard freestyle relay, the fmal competi­tion, the Belles trailed the Hornets by live, a deficit that could have been overcome by a victory in the 
400. Unfortunately for the Belles, they were edged in the event, and therefore dropped their third head­to-head MIAA meet this season. 
Despite the loss, the Belles had a successful meet. recording 10 sea­son-best times. 
The team started off' quickly, set­ting two of those times in the first two events of the night. Sophomore Maggie Williams and freshmen Audrey Dalrymple, Eva Cavadini and Barbara Beidler st.:'lrted off the night with a season-best time in the 400-medley relay. 
Then, in the next event, senior Melissa Gerbeth posted her sea­son-best time in the 1,000-freestyle event, which gave her first-place honors. Gerbeth was also victori­ous in the SOD-freestyle competi­tion, in which she swam 5:22.87, another season-best. 
Dalrymple led the Belles with three first-place finishes, one in the 100-breaststroke, another in the 200-breaststroke and the last in the 200-individual medley, which was also a season-best time. 
Williams was the only other Belle to achieve first-place honors with a victory in the 100-backstroke. 
Many other Belles improved on their season-best time in the meet against the Hornets, a good sign as the Belles come closer to the MIAA Championships. Cavadini improved her 400-medley time, while Beidler recorded her best race of the year in the 50-freestyle. 
Senior diver Leah Bocinsky improved her scores in both the 1­meter and 3-meter diving events. Another senior, Kate Orbon, cut two-tenths of a second off of her 100-freestyle time and sophomore Caroline Arness also topped her season-best time in the 100-butter­fly. 
The Belles will try to keep improving to make a strong show­ing to end the season, as they will take on conference opponent Olivet this weekend before competing in the MIAA Championships Feb. 18­20 at Notre Dame.

Offensively for the Irish, the biggest difference in the second half was 3-point shooting. In the first half, Notre Dame regained its old shooting form, looking nothing like the team that shot a combined 16-53 
(30.1 percent) from behind the arc against Connecticut and Marquette. The Irish attempted 22 threes, making 11 -putting them on a pace to break the school record of 19 3-pointers set earlier this season against South Dakota. 
Then Notre Dame stopped shooting from deep. 
In the second half, the Irish attempted only five 3-pointers, four of which were taken in the final 2:30 after the game was out of reach. Part of the change was due to the Panthers guard­ing more closely against the trey, but the Irish also seemed to stop playing for the three. Forward Luke Zeller, who torched Pittsburgh for six 3­pointers in the first half, played only six minutes in the second half. 
On the other end of the floor, the big difference was rebound­ing. Although Pittsburgh outre­bounded Notre Dame 25-16 in the first half, the Irish con­tained the damage, giving up only nine second-chance points. The Panthers, however, turned the second half into an offen­sive rebounding clinic, grab­bing 13 and scoring 20 second­chance points. Notre Dame had 11 second-chance points for the entire game. 
Leading the way for Pittsburgh on the glass was sophomore DeJuan Blair. The Irish had no answer for the 6­foot-7, 265-pound. Forward, who grabbed a career high 22 rebounds to go along with 23 points. 
"My team did a good job of getting me the ball," Blair said. "Twenty-two rebounds? I didn't know that. That's crazy. That's really something." 
Harangody, who guarded Blair for most of the afternoon, said that Blair is the toughest player to go against in the Big East. 
"He never stops working," llarangody said. "I love his game. Twenty-two rebounds is tough to do in one game. But their whole team played well, and it showed." 
Despite going up against another first-class big man, Harangody turned in another solid performance. lie scored 27 points to go along with 11 rebounds and four assists. 
Unlike previous games, I-Iarangody got some scoring help from his teammates early in the game. Zeller scored a career-high 18 points, all com­ing on 3-point field goals in the first half. ForwaNi Hyan Ayers rediscovered his shooting stroke, hitting two of four three-point field goals on his way to 10 points. Ft)rward Zach IIillesland also notched double ligures with 12 points.

"We're just sick of losing, and we're sick of talking about los­ing," Schrader said. "We have to go out there and let our actions show." 
Sophomore forward Becca Bruszewski finished with 15 points and seven rebounds, junior guard Ashley Barlow had a career-high eight steals and junior guard Melissa Lechlitner had seven assists and eight rebounds. 
Freshman forward Kellie Watson had 10 points and hit three 3-pointers, two within 40 seconds of one another in the final minutes, and had five rebounds. 
"[Watson] hit two daggers back to back that ended it," Bearcats coach J. Kelley Hall said. 
Schrader set her previous career high of 14 rebounds on Nov. 18, 2005, against Michigan in her first collegiate game. She said the team need­ed rebounds because it enabled the offense to operate effective­ly. 
"I think it was in everyone's mindset to rebound because when you get to rebound, you get to run," she said. "And that's our game, transition and running." 
Bearcats junior guard Kahla Roudebush finished with 13 points and had six turnovers in the game. Senior guard Angel Morgan scored 10 points and had nine rebounds. Irish coach Muffet McGraw said she liked the defensive effort, both on Roudebush and the team as a whole. 
"We held [Roudebush] to 13, she's a great player, she's one of the better players in the con­ference, so to be able to shut her down I thought was a very encouraging sign," McGraw said. "And the way they shot from the 3-point line, we had not done that in Big East play." 
The Bearcats were 4-for-17 from beyond the arc. Notre Dame led 52-33 with

the Leprechaun Legion painted their chests, "New Streak Starts Tonight." It didn't. Instead, Notre Dame is stuck in a five-game los­ing streak. 
The next night on Jan. 27 the women took the court against a mediocre Rutgers squad to ing gravity. One of them even turned a bucket of water into confetti in mid air. 
The curse was started by the Harlem Globetrotters.

own 13-game phone call this 
home streak. The last time they lost at home was exactly one year before against, who else, the Connecticut Huskies. 
Friday night, the No. 1-ranked hockey team put its own 20­game winning streak on the line against No. 7/8 Michigan. The Irish held one of the most explo­sive offenses in the country to only two goals, but the curse struck again and yet another streak went up in smoke. 
What happened? 
There were some big hits Friday, but no glass was shat­tered. The Irish backcourt need­ed a ladder to guard 7 -foot-3 Huskies center Hasheem Thabeet, but no one walked underneath it. I searched the entire campus and couldn't find any billy goats. 
After some serious detective work, I think I may have gotten to the bottom of the unlucky Irish. 
The night before the evil spir­its moved in, a small group of men was spotted inside the Joyce Center performing what could only be described as voodoo magic. These self-pro­claimed magicians blasted their eerie whistling music while defy-weekend that he 
thought would 
help. 
Jenkins got in contact with an old friend from the seminary, Father Lankester Merrin. You may remember him from his role in the 1973 horror thriller 'The Exorcism." 
Sadly, Merf·in is a busy man. He said he would only come to cast out the evil of the JACC when Mike Brey's head starts spinning in circles. Unfortunately, mock turtlenecks are extremely restricting when it comes to head spins. 
That leaves Jenkins and the athletic office with only one option, it's time to level the Joyce. 
To be honest, it's well overdue. The Purcell Pavilion construction is already getting started. The hockey rink has to be the worst facility in the country, at any level. But that's a topic for a dif­ferent day. 
Maybe this curse isn't so bad after all.

unbeaten streak. Despite the loss, Notre Dame sophomore right wing Ryan Guentzel said the big-game atmosphere got the Irish players more than ready to go. 
"It was crazy," he said. "Forty-five minutes before warm-ups the student section was absolutely packed. It got the players fired up, and it just shows how far this program has come." 
The teams traded chances in the first period, the Irish had the advantage in shots on goal, but Michigan generated more quality scoring chances. 
The Wolverines finally broke through late in the period though, when Notre Dame sen­ior center Erik Condra appeared to be tripped from behind, but no penalty was called. Michigan forwar-d David Wahlberg picked up the loose puck and fed ·it to team­mate Travis Turnbull. 

A goal immediately after an offensive zone faceoff from Wolverines forward Tim Miller 40 seconds into the second period doubled the Michigan lead to 2-0 and seemed to all but kill the once-raucous JACC crowd. 
The Irish failed to take advantage of back-to-hack Michigan penalties, and the score remained 2-0 with 10 minutes left in the second. 
Soon after, though, Guentzel pushed the puck into the Wolverines net after a pro­longed scramble in the crease, cutting the lead to 2-1 and re­energizing the Irish squad. 
"I just closed my eyes and it went in," Guentzel joked. 
After the goal, however, Michigan went into full lock­down defensively. In what could only be described as a textbook road third period, the Wolverines allowed only five Irish shots in the final stanza, none of them threatening. 
"It wasn't really a shutdown effort," Michigan coach Red 
Berenson said.

"I think he's

Despite the loss, Jackson remained confident after the game. 
"Sometimes losses are good for the soul," he said. "It's good to have a nice streak like that; it's been good for the pro­gram. But at the same time it's about us getting ready for the end of the season and games like this help us do that." 
The Irish got right back to work, starting a new streak Saturday, holding off a Michigan rally to walk out of Yost Arena with a win. 
Notre Dame got on the board first after freshman right wing Billy Maday punched a Calle Ridderwall rebound past Wolverine netminder Bryan Hogan at 8:15 of the opening frame. 
Junior right wing Ryan Thang made the lead 2-0 on a penalty shot goal at 4:03 in the second period. After being hauled down from behind by Michigan defenseman Steve Kampfer, Thang started the penalty shot moving wide to hiS backhand side, before switching to forehand and snapping a shot over Hogan's glove. The goal was Notre Dame's first on a penalty shot since Rob Globke's in 2001. 
A goal from Ridderwall at 
12:50 in the second gave the Irish a 3-0 lead going into the fmal period. 
No lead,. however, is safe at Yost Arena, and the Wolverines refused to go quiet­ly. A pair of power-play goals, the first at 4:27 from Aaron Palushaj and the second from Robbie Czarnik at 8:45, made for a tense finale in Ann Arbor. But despite being outshot 14-3 in the fmal period, Pearce and the Irish defense held strong. Notre Dame's senior goalie fin­ished with 36 saves on the night. 
Despite the rink's intimidat­ing reputation, Notre Dame has won two of its last three trips to Yost Arena, and could easily face Michigan again in the CCHA Championship in Detroit. 
The Irish return to action next weekend with a trip to No. 14 Ohio State.

Team splits weekend series with Michigan

In two close games that lived up to their billing, the Irish split their weekend series with Michigan, falling 2-1 Friday night in the Joyce Center, and winning 3-2 Saturday night in Ann Arbor. 
The split allowed the No. 1 Irish (24-4-3, 14-3-3-3 CCHA) to maintain their hold on first place in the CCHA, two points ahead of Miami (OH) with two games in hand on the RedHawks. 
Friday night, in front of a packed crowd sporting "White Out" T-shirts, the No. 7/8 Wolverines (19-9-0, 13-7-0-0 CCHA) brought an end to Notre Dame's school-record 20-game

Irish rebound against Cinci 
Schrader leads the way as ND snaps two-game losing streak 
By BILL BRINK Sports Editor 
To senior guard Lindsay Schrader, no rebound was too far away, no loose ball too much effort, and no shot too difficult. 
Schrader had 19 points and a career-high 15 rebounds dur­ing No. 17 Notre Dame's 66-50 win over Cincinnati Saturday at the Joyce Center. Notre Dame's offensive rebounding and ability to force turnovers sealed the win, which snapped its two-game losing streak.

Hope gets revenge in win over Saint Mary's 
By ALEX WEST Sports Writer 
On Jan. 3, Saint Mary's pulled oft' an upset of then-No. 1 Hope College to take control of the MIAA. Saturday afternoon, the No. 3 Flying Dutch (16-1) got redemption and got back on top of the MIAA with an 84-59 vic­tory over the Belles (11-8). 
The Flying Dutch started out the game strong and never took their foot off the gas. Just six minutes into the contest, Miranda DeKuiper hit a 3-point­er that put Hope up 11 points. The Belles were able to cut the lead back to seven with 12:44 in the first half, but Hope pulled away to a 39-25 lead at half­time. 
The Flying Dutch continued to dominate both sides of the ball in the second half. The Belles couldn't find an answer for Carrie Snikkers who scored a game-high 21 points and pulled down 10 rebounds. Jessica Centa was the leading scorer for the Belles with 12 points. Senior forward Erin Newsom added 10 points and five rebounds, both under her sea­son average. 
On the bright side for the Belles, they forced the Flying Dutch into 18 turnovers and held them under 39 percent shooting. But the Flying Dutch dominated the boards, out rebounding the Belles 57-45. 
The Belles finished their four game road trip 3-1, but fell to second place in the MIAA stand­ings with Saturday's loss. They will try to bounce back at home against Olivet on Wednesday. Tip off it set for 7:30p.m. at the Angela Athletic Facility.
