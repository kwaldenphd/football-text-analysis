Girls can cut it 
IL really shouldn't surprise me anymore, but 

things like this arc always a little unsettling. 
So, yes, I let it get to me. First as l agonized 

ovur verb conjugations and sentence structure on 
a morning French test. Then as I sat down to an

The words I had heard earlier in the day were 
hard to shake. 
The day had begun in

just prior to the start of class. 
three students and I had 
turned our attention from the 
test we'd bn taking shortly to 
more promising thoughts. 
"I ley, you work for The 

Observer, right?" a male 
classmate asked me, and I 
nodded yes. 
"What's up with the chick

he informed me and two 
/cmale sttident'i. 
I immediately looked down at my watch. at the 

moment monitoring how long until the prolcssor 
walkt'd through the door and handed out the 
exams. But now that I think about it, perhaps I 
was also checking to make sure that I indeed was 
living in the year 2000, in a time and place where 
sentiments like my classmate's didn't quite 
belong. 
Next, I gmmd out the third-floor window orthe DeBartolo Ilall classroom. There was the football stadium; I was, to my dismay, certainly at Notre Dame. I was at a university where some of the world's supposedly "best and brightest" stand in the glorious shadow of the Golden Dome, infected with the simply ignorant belief that women ­even to this day-just can't hack it. 
Then my thoughts shifted to The Observer's sports editor, Kerry Smith, a flery red-haired equal mix of talent and hard work. 
I might have told my classmated that writing and editing copy for the Paper's best-read section in addition to running a sizeable staff is no small feat. I might also have told him that you don't rise to the helm of an award-winning sports depart­ment without knowing your stuff and excelling at what you do. 
Just like Kerry and two of her departmental colleagues -associate editor Kathleen O'Brien and assistant editor Katie McVoy -do. 
It didn't occur to me, though, to clue my class­mate in on just how tireless these three are in their journalistic endeavors, as both writers and editorial leaders. I walk into the Observer office at night and they're there, even on their nights off. I leave early sometime the next morning, and they're still there, always tightening, proofing and perfecting. 
And the fact that they are women shouldn't dis­count their efforts. If anything, in the face or such oppressive and stifling opinions as my classmate's, their gender should serve as a testa­ment to their skill and determination. 
lt would be comforting to believe that such views are in the minority, and I'd hazard a guess that they arc. But I suppose what's frightening is to ponder just how big that minority is -in class­rooms and dorm rooms and in conference rooms and board rooms. 
I wish it hadn't taken the sexist attitude ofa fel­low Domer to make me conscious of that fact. Let's just hope that !"our years at Notre Dame awakens him -and me -to the progress we've made through the years and what it takes to keep "chicks" in the newsroom and anyplace else they care to be in the future.

TEXAS A&M 
Officials suspend frat for hazing 
COLLEGE STATION, Texas 
Sigma Nu fraternity is expected to file an appeal today in response to a two-year suspension due to alle­gations of hazing and alcohol abuse last year. On Sept. 22, the University Greek Judicial Board found the fra­ternity in violation of A&M student rules at 12 fraterni­ty events and ordered the A&M chapter of Sigma Nu on a two-year hiatus. Under the guidelines of the sus­pension, Sigma Nu is prohibited from using University facilities and participating in A&M activities. Courtney Reece, Sigma Nu commander and a senior geology major, said the fraternity plans to flle its appeal today. He said the fraternity plans to argue that its punish­ment was too harsh and possibly that the findings were inappropriate. "We are waiting on our appeal process," Reece said. "We feel that it was too harsh of a sentence." In addition to the sanctions against the fraternity, Kim Novak, coordinator of Student ConOict Resolution Services, said individual charges were filed against eight of the fraternity members.

In the wake of violence, mourners gathered to remember the fallen and to pray for the future. Members of the gay community, the heterosexual com­munity, the administration, service organizations and representatives from religious groups came together to hold a candle light vigil in front or Alumni Hall. The vigil was in remembrance of Daniel Overstreet, 43, a homosexual who was murdered in Hoanoke because of his sexual orientation. "We want to show that we do have a voice on campus," said vigil organizer and speaker, Reggie Elam, programming chair or the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Alliance of Virginia Tech and a sophomore art major. "We're try­ing to make people aware that this won't be tolerated." Elam said he hopes people attending the event will be able to spread the messages of tolerance and equality among the rest of the community. "If all else fails, I want this to be something people can take home with them," he said.

Freshman council elects executive posts 
By JASON McFARLEY Assistant News Editor 
In a meeting Sunday night, members of the freshman class council determined leaders for 2000-2001 board. 
Freshman representatives elected Dan Maguire, Keri Oxley, Tai Romero and Jason King tu the council's four executive posts. 
Maguire, a Tampa native, will serve as class president. He said he knew he wanted to hold the position ever since he was elected Zahm Hall's freshman representative last week. 
'Tm going lo go in with my eyes open and my ears perked," Maguire said. 
"I under­stand that plans on making this year a spirited introduction to Notre Dame for her classmates. 
"I want to make it as fun as p·ossible. I hope it will be a mad blast," said Homcro. 
Romero, of Baton Rouge, La., is a Walsh Hall section leader. 
She said she wants to keep her class informed of an involved in various opportu­nities throughout the year. 
"There is going to be a lot going on, and I hope the class will show the same excite­ment in participating in these events as it does when it first­comes in [to the University]," Romero said.

Maguire said that he'd like to use his time in office to emphasize the importance of class unity. 
"That's my biggest goal," he said of the issue. "You see too much dorm pride around Notre Dame and not enough pride in us as a collective whole." 
Badin Hall's Keri Oxley said she also has plans in mind for the freshman class. Oxley, of Freemont, Ohio, was elected class vice president on Sunday. 
"From my past experience of serving, I've learned that the top priorities in achieving success are creativity, unity and spirit. I hope to imple­ment that into the Class of 2004," Oxley said. 
Oxley also hopes to be lis­tening to the concerns of her classmates throughout the year. 
"It's important to me to take the goals of the fresh­man class and make sure that they become a reality," Oxley said.

King said he won't carry many ideas into office with him, but he intends to be active in class fundraising events. 
"I hope to pull in a lot of cash, use the money wisely and hopefully be able to put together a lot of activities," King said.

llepublicans have been quick Lo criticize the Clinton !\dministralion for inappropri­ately using the oil issue as a political ploy to bolster Gore's support before the election.

Americans who have adjusted to the inflated gas prices, there has not been an incredible amount of fear about Lim impending winter months. 
"The truth is. Americans haven't really felt the effects of this yet. We saw a little bit in the summer with higher gas prices, but very !'cw people are paying heating oil bills now," said Notre Dame Government professor. Christina Wolbrecht. "They (the Clinton Administration) are putting it on the agenda." 
Gore, who just last month was against releasing the nation's oil reserves. has lead many people to believe that making energy an issue in the election is some­what. if not very, political. 
The Clinton administration has also been criticized for indirectly 
giving support to the First Lady 
as she seeks a Senate scat in 
New York. where many people 
depend of heating oil in the win­
tor. 

··1 think there arc a lot of peo­ple who think that Bill Clinton in particular is very concerned with his wife's election and Al Gore's election because he secs them as kind of referendums on his legacy," sa.id Wolbrecht. 
Critics have argued that the oil release is a short-term solution to a larger problem in the more general market dynamics. Bush believes that it is the Clinton Administration's lack of energy policy for the last eight years that has contributed to the prob­lems the United· States is !'acing today. 
Many cxpl'fts sec the new energy issue linked to broader economic. environmental and foreign policy. 
Economically. many critics question whether dumping a larger supply of oil on the mar­ket will work to lower prices in the future. 
Prices are set on limited quan­tities of oil sold in spot markets and many view the Clinton Administration ·s decision as only a temporary solution. Some economists feel Lhat using oil reserves for price 
Gore uti­

lized a "swap" procedure in which com­panies receive reserve oil to sell at current prices on the condi­tion that the amount plus extra for the future will be returned to the reserve. The intent is to leave reserve amounts larger than before the release. 
Jennifer Warlick, an Economics professor at the University of Notre Dame points out that the release will. in fact, increase the amount of oil there­by decreasing the price. Although critics claim that this provides only a temporary solu­tion. Warlick was hesitant to believe that Gore's motivations were ultimately political. 
"We have designed our econo­my around low gas and oil prices," Warlick said. "Heating 
oil is a low elasticity of demand 
commodity. which means that as 
the price of oil rises, consumers 
can't immediately cut back on 
their consumption." Warlick 
said. 
"One, it (the high price of uil} 

is certainly not a national emer­
gency and two, it may have been 
economically wise," said Notre 
Dame Government professor, 
Dan Lindley, on the Clinton 
administralicin's moves to stabi­
lize oil prices. As or now, 
Lindley sees the decision as hav­

\Var lick remains concerned 

about the broader implications 
surrounding the oil shortage. 
Low-income families will feel the 
scarcity most. intensely and 
Warlick wonders what the 

government wili do to provide 
assistance to these families. 
"Without oil, people must allo­
cate their income and do with· 
out things which Americans con­
sider necessities," said Warlick. 
Warlick contends that the real question is whether the release of the oil is target efficient by helping Lhe people who will need assistance to pay the higher prices for heating oil during the winter. Also, Warlick suggests that the government increase subsidies to low income families for the coming winter. 
The energy issue has been set against the backdrop of the recent meeting on Wednesday of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in Venezuela. OPEC is hesitant to increase production of crude oil to lower prices in industrial nations. Last Friday, however, Saudi Arabia promised to pump more crude oil to reduce prices. 
President Clinton has suggest­ed that a possible solution would be to encourage prices that are substantially below the nearly $40 a barrel level that crude oil soared to last week, but ,...-ell above the $12 level that made gasoline so cheap two years ago.

"I think it's hard for stu­dents, let alone most Americans. to have a well­formulated opinion on the energy issue because it requires a knowledge of poli­tics, economics and history," said senior Notre Dame stu­dent Maggie Wood. 
Some Notre Dame students think that the Clinton Administration released oil reserves with the impending Presidential elections in mind. 
"Clinton's motives for doing it are political," said senior PLS and History -major. Scan Vinck. "The release is too little and too late," said Vinck who faults the Clinton administration for having an incoherent energy policy for tho last eight years.

Milosevic's opposition mobilizes 
Associated Press 

BELGRADE 
Encouraged by cheering crowds, a convoy of 60 trucks blocked a key high­way Sunday as opposition forces sought to gather support for a nationwide strike aimed at showing Presid~nt Slobodan Milosevic he must relin­quish µower. 
The trucks -taking part in u "dress rehearsal" for a series of full-scale block­ades planned for Monday -were greeted by jubilant supporters as they passed through the opposition stronghold Cacak in central Yugoslavia. Some people tossed flowers as the trucks headed to an important highway linking Belgrade with southern Yugoslavia. 
The truckers brandished banners and posters of Vojislav Kostunica, whom the opposition and Western leaders insist trounced Milosevic in Sept. 24 elec­tions, Milosevic rejects the claim and says a run-off election is needed Oct. 8. 
Workers at two major coal mines did not wait for Monday and walked off the job Saturday. However, the independent Beta news agency reported that hun­dreds of special police entered one mine -Kolubara about 25 miles south of Belgrade -and turned back local towns­people who tried to march to the site in protest. 
The move was clearly aimed at keeping the mine open; it supplies coal to one of the country's major elec­tric power stations, The state-run power company warned strikers they were endangering public health and safety, About 1,000 workers in another coal settle for a run-olT and that a diamond," Ilic told the Protic acknowledged that it mine in Kostolac joined the is now the law for everyone crowd.

Research may help cancer fertility 
Assoda1ed Press 
WASJIINGTON 

Women having cancer therapy may one day be able to avoid the ovary da.mage that often lc,wcs them unable to bear children, researchers report. 
Scientists studying chemical and radiation damage to mice cells report promising results when lhn action of' the chemical ccramidc was blocked. But they caution that considerable work is needed before the method could be used in humans. 
Blocking ceramidc preserved the fertility of eggs normally destroyed in cancer treatment, researchers report in the October isstw of the journal Nalure Medicine. 
"This holds the promise of selectively prcservin)l'. ovarian function and preventing this tragic side effoct of the treat­ment of cancer," said Dr. llichard N. Kolesnick of Memorial Sl()an-Kettcring Cancer Center in New York. 
"!or the first time we have a promising prospect for a small molecule that could be given to women and girls undergoing 
cancer treatment to protect their 
ovaries," added Jonathan Tilly of 
Massachusetts General Hospital, 
the paper's senior author. 
Tilly cautioned that tcsl-; have 
only been done in mice and that 
tests arc under way to deter­
mine the treatment's effect on 
human ovary tissue that has 
been transplanted in mice. 
"It's very dilTicult to put a time frame on," when the treatment could be available for humans, he said. "We will push ahead as quickly as we~ can." 
In an accompanying news arti­cle about the lindings, Hobert F. Casper and Andrt'a J. Juriscova of !.he Universi!.y of Toronto said the research was "an inn()vative and exciting potential new treat­ment to prevent oocyte destruc­tion after can cc r treatrn ent." Oocytc is the scientiflc term for the egg cells of mammals. 
While the paper focuses on ovary damage caused by radia­tion, Tilly said in a telephone interview that similar protection also occurred in tests involving doxorubicin, a chemotherapy drug. 
The researchers had earlier found that the death of the ovar­ian cells involved a series of chemicals, including ceramide. The conversion of a molecule in the body called sphingomyclin into ceramide by an enzyme sets off the death of several types of cells in response to chemothera­py or radiation therapy. 
So the scientists conducted tests to see if blocking the sphin­gomyelin pathway by using the compound sphingosine-1-phos­phate would protect the eggs in live animals. 
They injected S1 P into the sac surrounding one ovary in each of a group of normal mice and then exposed them to a dose of radiation that would be expected to destroy most of their eggs. 
Two weeks later the ovaries receiving Sl P appeared healthy while the unprotected ovaries showed almost complete destruction of eggs. 
"There was absolutely no damage at all that we could see." in the ovaries with S1P, Tilly said. "The ovaries looked normal ... the mice were cycling normally, they ovulated and were able to produce embryos. By all criteria they were nor­mal."

Cops kill IDan who stabbed three 
Associated Pres 
VENTURA, Calif. 

A man stabbed three staff members in a hospi­tal waiting room, then was shot and killed by police. authorities said Sunday. 
Tho victims' wounds were not life-threatening. 

The attack happened at Community Memorial Hospital late Saturday, when the man "jumped one of the staff, started hitting him. and took out a knife and started stabbing him," said police Lt. Carl Handy. 
Two staff members who tried to intervene also were stabbed. 

Officers first tried to subdue the man by firing a non-lethal beanbag round, but that failed, Handy said. 
"When he came at the officers with a knife, he was shot one time and he died about two hours later," he said. 
The motive for the attack was not known, Handy said. He said police had had previous contact with the man but he would not give details. The hospital referred questions on the wound­ed workers to Handy, who said they were "doing 
fine."

Pope canonizes first saints frolll China 
Associaced Press 

VATICAN CITY 
Pope John Paul II declared 
sainthood Sunday for 120 
Chinese and foreign missionar­
ies killed in the church's five-
century ­
and ongo­
ing 
struggle in 
Chin a. 
Stung, 
Beijing 
called the 
martyrs 
"evildoing 
sinners 
and their 

canonization "an open insult." 
Naming or the church's first Chinese saints threatened to worsen already stiff relations with China, which at home is combatting Vatican-allied Homan Catholicism and other banned spiritual movements it sees as challenges to its authority_ 
The date of the canoniza­tions was enraging to China ­falling on China's National Day celebrating 51 years of com­munist rule. So was their cho­sen subject: 87 Chinese and 33 foreigners, most killed in what China still views as the right­eous 1900 Boxer Rebellion against foreign imperialism and religions. 
John Paul, looking wan and tired on a rainy morning in St. Peter's Square, insisted "the celebration is not the time to make judgments." 
"The church only intends to recognize that those martyrs are an example of courage and coherence for all of us. and give honor to the noble 

Chinese people," the pope 
said. 
John Paul named three other 
new saints as well. all nuns: 
one-time socialite Katharine 
Drexel, who devoted her lifo 
and inheritance to founding 
schools for American Indians 
and blacks; one-time Sudanese 
slave Guiscppine 13ahkita, and 
Maria Josefa del Corazon de 
Jesus Sancho de Guerra, the 
first saint or Spain's trouble 
Basque people. 
The solid bank of' rain-slick umbrellas in the sq uaro cov­ered tens of' thousands, includ­ing ethnic Chinese from Taiwan, Ilong Kong and else­where. 
If any Catholics rrom main­
land China dared attend. they 
kept it a secret. 
China's Communist leaders ordered Catholics to renounce loyalty to the popn in the 1950s. Beligious and human rights groups regularly report arrests ol' clergy who attempt to worship outside the statc­mon itored official Catholic church. 
'Today is National Day. and more than ever Chinese Catholics should stand with the nation," Bishop Fu Tioshan, the state-appointed bishop in Beijing, told worship­pers Sunday morning at the Chinese capital's South Cathedral. 
"Choosing this date lo can­onize the so-called 'saints' is an open insult and humiliation against the Chinese Catholic adherents," Fu was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua News Agency. 
China's Foreign Ministry denounced the newly canon­ized as "evildoing sinners."

Dozens of anti-abortion pro­tcs Lc rs at an annual rally Sunday said they support the devotion -if not the alleged actions -of a Catholic priest accused of crashing into an abortion clinic here and chop­ping away at the building with an ax.

that said "Adoption: The lov­ing option" and joined a human chain of about 1,000 protesters outside a Catholic church forming the shape of a cross. 
The rally had been sched­uled long before Saturday's attack. Amid the singing, peo­ple could be heard along the chain talking about the H.ev. John Earl. who is charged with burglary and l'clony crim­inal damage to property for tbe aLtac.;k Saturday morning at the Northern Illinois Women's Center. Ile was freed

after posting $10,000 bond. 
Earl, 32, was stopped inside the building by its owner. who fired two shotgun blasts to scare him away. The clinic wasn't open and there were no injuries. 
"It's hard to support those kinds of actions when you stand for life, but we definite­ly do support him in standing up for life," Jeff O'Hara, 37, said at Sunday's rally. 
Police have not disclosed a possible motive for the attack on the clinic. It came two days after government approval of the RU-486 abortion pill and was at the office of Dr. Richard Ragsdale, who suc­cessfully challenged Illinois abortion laws in the 1980s that he claimed were so strict thev limited women's access to 
the procerlure. 
The Diocese of Rockford said the priest's activities have been restricted while it inves­tigates the allegations. A mes­sage left at the church. St. Patrick's Church in Rochelle, about 30 miles south of' Rockford, was not returned. 
At the church's evening Mass on Saturday. the Rev. Aaron Brodeski discouraged parishioners from gossiping 
among themselves  or  with  
media.  
"Father John has  a  lot of'  

young ideas and a lot or old ideas from 40 to 50 years ago," said church member Joe Ryan. "You might believe in why he did what he did, but do you want him teaching your kids to do that?" 
Gay Bruhn, president of Illinois chapter of the National Organization for Women, said Sunday that the church and anyone who supports individu­als associated with acts of vio­lence are hypocritical. 
"It's a complete denial of responsibility by those in the movement that encourage people to go out and do this stuff," Bruhn said. "We've had some victories and some loss­es, but we've never driven a car into a building. I'm appalled by the violence." 
A local restaurant owner who started a legal defense fund to assist Earl said that although he sympathizes with the priest. he wishes he would have adhered to nonviolent protest. 
"It is a war," said restaurant owner Frank Giammarese. "It is a war on our culture and our humanity."

Q.l 
s 

In the next weeks and months we shall see whether our administration sticks with the tradition of control and censor­ship, or courageously starts opening our Universily tu the free expression ofslu­dent opinion. 
Notre Dame is a

grants) without 
which our school 

would be either smaller, less prestigious 
or both. As a publicly-supported institu­
tion it should be responsible for uphol9­
ing minimal standards regarding free speech, but I won't focus on that argu­
ment. 

Rather, let us examine the role of a Catholic University. Firstly as a University, our mission is to teach critical thinking. Students must be able to open­ly discuss contrasting ideas, to discern what is true and what is not. Ideally teachers present a wide array of theories on a relative equal-footing, giving stu­dents the information and tools they need to make their own decisions. Thus academic freedom at the class-level is essential. 
The idea that it can exist without a corresponding freedom of expression in regular (outside of class) student life is ludicrous. University life cannot be divid­ed into a false opposing dichotomy of "classes" and "campus life." Studying time blends into recreational time as stu­dents discuss ideas at meals. parties, while watching TV. e-mailing friends and many other moments. 
Much university learning occurs out­side the classroom in discussions. lec­tures, the activity of student organiza­tions and other things. Does it make sense to anyone that, for instance, stu­dents could take a course in gay-lesbian­bisexual studies (assuming it were offered and several departments are courageous enough to do it), but cannot form a student group to study the same thing? Or students could study the women's movement {which was over­whelmingly pro-choice), but if they were to form a women's organization it would have to be explicitly pro-Hfo? The admin­istration's actions several years ago against the Women's Resource Center show that neutralitv on that issue, which is otherwise desirable in a setting that should be promoting critical thinking and learning, is just not acceptable at Notre Dame. 
Secondly, our University is a Catholic community. I believe that faith is stronger if tested and that Notre Dame should be preparing students for the sec­ular world not by sheltering us, but by teaching us how to determine and stand up for our own values. As a residential community, most students study, live, play, eat, worship and sleep on campus. In addition, our campus is open to the public. Thus Notre Dame is, to take a legal term, a "quasi-public" space. Due to the dominant role that the campus plays in the lives of most Notre Dame students, we ought to have freedom here. 
Of course there is some freedom on campus. Otherwise people like me would have been expelled (or would have left in disgust) years ago. However, let us look at the many often-subtle places where freedom is limited. 
Demonstrations must be registered in advance and approval can be denied. Also if only one person is leafleting it can be treated as a demonstration. Petitions must be approved by the Director of Student Activities and signatures only collected at a reserved space at a reserved time. 
Posters must be approved by Student Activities -and posting space is limited (no kiosks and very few bulletin boards in buildings like DeBartolo and LaFortune). For-profit corporations (e.g. credit card advertisements) fill bulletin boards with their wares, violating duLac, while placing progressive posters on the walls of O'Shaughnessy can lead to pun­ishment. Activist chalking is erased while corporate advertising (www.varsity­books.com) and birthday greetings are not. 
Canvassing dorms, as done for student elections, violates duLac and could lead to punishment if activists did it. Club trips require 30 days advance notice and a University chaperone. Students do not have the unhindered right to form stu­dent organizations (e.g. OUTreach ND) Perhaps the greatest danger is that a rule that is normally ignored will b11 selectively enforced against yourself or your organization. 
A critical test of our freedom is the 
impending threat to The Observer. which 
could lose its independence very soon. 
Given that in the past 15 years the 
administration has censored Scholastic, 
WSND, WVFI and The Juggler, this 
attack upon The Observer should not be 
a surprise. However, it should be chal­
lenged. 
While the administration imposes unnecessary un-Christian restrictions on free speech that threaten our ability to be a university, these rules should be resisted. We have no moral responsibility to follow unjust rules imposed by a small elite group of University ollicers. 

Hegarding The Observer, the Faculty Senate has already passed a resolution and the student governments of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's have expressed their concern. In seven days, to respond to the numerous barriers to student action mentioned previously, students will gather to launch a Coalition for Free Speech. We shall advocate for reason­able changes to current University poli­cies and give the University a chance to do the right thing. 
The resistance has started. For the past 40 years, Notre Dame students have rebelled against paternalist restrictions (from parietals to media censorship). If administrators do not like this -well, they did not have to come here and are free to leave. 
Aaron is pleased to announce that his alma mater, Goshen College, recently became the jirsl Mennonite college in North America to recognize a student gay, lesbian and bisexual group. I!is col­umn appears every other Monday. 
The views expressed in this column are those ofthe author and not necessarily those ofThe Observer.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Bishops advocate economic and social stability for all U.S. citizens 
The following is a statement by Bishop Members of Pax Christi USA made on March 23. 2000. Pax Christi ND will be hosting the Hread Not Stones campaign to rndirect military spending on Thursday, October 5th on South Quad at 4p.m. 
In his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus emphasized the parental care ol God by comparing it to tht~ care we give our own children. "Is them anyone among you. who if your child asks for bread, will give a stone?" (Mt. i:9) Jesus makes the point that. even we who are sinful, would never give our children a stone if' they asked for bread. ,\nd yet, in many ways, our . national budget priorities do exactly that. · 
In a time of unprecedented economic prosperity and budget surpluses, our political leaders cannot find the resources to provide a good education and reliable health care for tens of millions of our nation's childnm and we arc told that we cannot afford targeted tax relief for millions of strug­gling families. In our country alone, 35 million people live in poverty, and 31 million people report not having enough to eat, including 12 million children. Despite these frightening statistics and the lack of a rival super­power, the U.S. spends nearly seventeen times as much on defense as the combined total spent by the six countries most oft.en identified by the Pentagon as our potential adversaries. We seem intent on waging an arms race against ourselves -spending more than 50 percent of our federal discretionary budget on the military and tens of billions of dollars on nuclear and conventional weapon systems that have no plausible military purpose. Our government spends more in annual foreign military aid than it docs in funding sustainable development efforts for nations experiencing widespread poverty. The social needs of our nation and world are held hostage to military spending, making our world increasingly insecure. As the Vatican II document Gaudium et Spes pointed out years ago, "the arms race is an utterly treacherous trap for humanity and one that ensnares the poor to an intolerable degree." This point was made even stronger in the Vatican's 1976 United Nalions Statement on Disarmament. 
The United States has the highest rate of childhood povertv in the indus­trialized world and one of the lowest adult literacy rates. Many of our working poor are struggling in low paying jobs with no family healthcare benefits and inadequate childcare for their little ones. This is a tragic con­sequence of a nation which chooses to spend only six cents on.education and four cents on healthcare for every 50 cent'i which it spends on the military. We live in the wealthiest nation on earth and yet, it is still possi­ble for a family with a full-time worker to live in poverty, Demand at soup kitchens and food pantries is on the rise, with people being turned away at some facilities because there is not enough. Indeed, those who are poor cry out for life-sustaining bread. but we offer them the stones of war. 
~oving people toward economic and social stability is a goal that can be easily achieved if there were the public will to du so. Hut we cannot accomplish this goal and feed our insatiable appetite for more and better weapons. 
True peace and security does not lie in superior firepower but in a world where every person is enabled to develop their full human potential. The well being of our nation's people holds the key to our future peace and security. We could offer all who hunger the bread they need ifwe were willing to drop our stones. If we eliminated even one of the J.-22 tighter planes planned for production this year, we could build 31 new ele­mentary schools. If we chose to eliminate just three new attack sub­marines, we could build 90,000 affordable apartment units. The United Nations Development Program estimates that the basic health and nutri­tion needs or the world's poorest people could be met for an additional $13 billion per year, about five percent of this year's U.S. military budget. Turning away from our addiction to costly and strategically questionable conventional and nuclear weapon systems could free up tens of billions of dollars a year to meet the needs of people living in poverty. 
We view the federal budget as a moral document that must reflect our degree of compassion for those who arc poor and sulTering in our own society. We therefore call for a national Catholic campaign of prayer, study and action to end exorbitant military spending in order to provide for the needs of all our people. We call for a campaign in our parishes, schools and Catholic organizations which will takP. up thP. plea of Pope John Paul II for "a moral about-face" regarding our appetite for weapons of war. During this budget and election cycle we must marshal our resources and summon our moral courage to say "no" to a bloated mili­tary budget which robs those who are poor and vulnerable and "yes" to a budget which helps lift people out of poverty. We must say "no" to the insatiable appetite for more and better weapons which destabilize rela­tionships between nations and "yes" to the development of new diplomatic strategies which promote lasting peace. If we can do this, then we can transform the stones of war into the bread of life for those in need both at home and throughout our world.

September 29, 2000 

This past week, the Board of Governance was presented with a challenging task in responding to a controversial T-shirt pro­duced by the Junior Class Board. The Board of Governance, in an 18-3 vote (with one abstenlion), elected to revoke the distribution and sales of the junior class T-shirt. This deci­sion was made by utilizing and upholding the Saint Mary's Student Government Association constitution, as well as the mission of Saint Mary's College. 
As student body president and vice presi­dent. we arc official representatives of' our student body, and ultimately, stl:ldent repre­sentatives of this fine institution. We seek to maintain mutual respect and communication among the students, faculty and administra­tion. The welfare of the students as members of our College community is our primary aim. We, as well as the additional members of the Board of Governance, have the right and responsibility to express ourselves on all mat­ters affecting the student community we rep­resent, as noted in our SGA constitution. 
During Wednesday night's BOG meeting, we had an obligation to address the shirt's impli­cations aftBr rnceiving numerous complaints from members of our student body. Therefore, it was immediately entered into the evening's agenda. Both of us expressed our strong aversion towards the shirt's obvi­ous implications. As student body president and vice president, it is indeed our responsi­bility to voice our concerns and opinions on matters that affect the women we represent. In addition, it is our responsibility to maintain consistency inclusive with the Saint Mary's College Mission Statement when doing so. 
According to our constitution, the "Class governments are sanctioned by the board of Governance." It is the first time that this Board has had to utilize this authority. On Wednesday night. the BOG recognized its right and responsibility to "suspend, with­draw, or revoke recognition of any entity if it is determined that such action is in the best interest of Saint Mary's College," as pre­scribed by our SGA constitution. 
The decision to revoke distribution of this shirt was ultimately based upon inconsisten­cies found between the shirt's implications and our mission statement. namely, "Saint Mary's cultivates a community life which responds to the needs of women and cherish­es their talents ... the College strives to bring together women of different nations, cultures and races. It provides a residential environ­ment where women grow in their apprecia­tion of the strengths and needs of others." 
As students attending an all-women's col­lege, we should strive to foster and nourish relationships with all women. Perhaps the energies displayed and voiced in response to this T-shirt would be best directed toward building relationships, common goals and mutual respect with our fellow sisters who attend the University of Notre Dame. In doing so. we would like to be the first to offer our sincere apologies to the women of Notre Dame. 
To the women of Saint Mary's College, we encourage you to reflect on what it truly means to be a Saint Mary's woman. Today begins our second annual Saint Mary's Pride Week. It is a time to recognize that each woman on this campus has brought some­thing unique, something all their own to share with the rest of us. We have the opportunity to grow in an environment of diverse and talent­ed women and one that challenges and inspires us to grow in our knowledge. 
We arc honored to serve and represent such an incredible student body.

Viewing T-shirt with humor 
Thank you for a good laugh on a Friday afternoon! 
Or am I the only one in the new politically correct and hypersensitive ND-SMC communi­ty who lhinks the "controversy" over the Saint Mary's College junior class shirt is hilarious? This is almost as silly as the Captain Crunch protests of the mid-80's. After the previous day's article with no picture, which elicited a lot ofspeculation as to what could be so "offensive," I was delighted to see such a cute (few things are cute to me) and clever idea. 
It may surprise or even "offend" many around here to know that stereotypes are true, that is, contain an element of truth that can be quite humorous if not used in a mean spirited way, assuming one still has a sense of humor. To those offended by the shirt, please lighten up. To the junior class at SMC, you go girls! If the shirts have not been destroyed, I would love to have one as a gift for my niece, who may be a member of the class of 2006. She would enjoy the laugh. 
God bless you all and please forgive me if I have offended anyone. It seems increasingly easy to do so around here.

The year 2000 marks many milestones, not the least of which is a United States Presidential election that will impact coun­tries far beyond the U.S. geographic borders. Yet, for all the implications this election will have for people across the globe, very few 
U.S. citizens are actually involved in the elec­tion process because they feel powerless to affect the outcome. lfwe feel powerless, I ask you to consider just how desperate residents in Uganda, Haiti, East Timor, or Nepal must feel as we U.S. citizens go (or do not go!) to the ballot box. 
One could realistically argue that despite the national scope of the elections, we have, in fact, already become global citizens in many ways. Our patterns of travel, consump­VOTE. In this election year, the United States Catholic Conference of Bishops reminds us that the measure of every human institution is whether or not it enhances the life and digni­ty of the human person. The USCCB claims that Life and the Dignity of the Human Person lie at the heart of Catholic Social Teaching and that all people must be respected in soci­ety. Thus, the institution of our government must be under our faith-based lens during the election season. Which candidates will lead our governmental institutions to embrace the dignity of life in our country -from Appalachian Mountains to the Border Colonias to our inner cities? 
But civic responsibility does not end at the election booth. Your vote may be your voice, 
tion, education, but that voice is

,;,;,· U t}POPE JOHN PAUL II
describe the enor­politicians if we 
mous reach of technology and capital that have enveloped our globe, and which have evaded local or national structures meant to limit capitalism's predictable excesses. 
As a result, evidence continues to mount describing the disparity in the distribution of wealth caused by the globalization of economies. The poor are becoming poorer, while wealth is concentrated in fewer hands at higher extremes -63 millionaires are created each day, for example -in Silicon Valley alone. 
In the United States, with 5% of the world's population and 50% of the world's wealth, how are we --as Global Citizens --and more importantly, --as People of Faith --answering to the parable of the talents? Pope John Paul II reminds us in his encyclical "On Social Concern" that as people who have been given much, we have "the duty, which is urgent for everyone today, to work together for the full development of others: 'development of the whole human being and of all the people [throughout the world.]"' 
This duty involves the responsibility to 
fail to hold them accountable for their actions while in office. The Pope and the Bishops remind us that we must organize within the church and with other allies who believe in the goodness and worth of life, and ensure that our elected rep­resentatives know that it matters how they represent us after the election, as well. 
One final point: Catholic Social Tradition teaches us that we are born into solidarity with our brothers and sisters across the world because we have all been endowed with Dignity by our Creator. In the choices we make in an election, or even in the purchase of some merchandise, let us demonstrate that solidarity through underlying values that affirm and enhance the worth of workers at home and abroad. 
Globalization is here. During the frenzy of this transformation, let us not lose sight of that which binds us all together as children of God -our basic human dignity. So be a responsible global citizen, pronounce your values, and do your part to "Globalize Dignity" through an informed VOTE this election, and by faith-filled public action 
Rooted in the Gospel and Catholic social tradition, the Center for Social Concerns ofthe University ofNotre Dame creates formative educational and 

service experiences in collaboration with diverse partners, calling us to action for a more just and hun1ane world.

Rak, Welsh Family shut out Pangborn 35-0 
By MARIAH QUINN and LIA 
MILHOAN 
Spurts Wrire:u 
Welsh fiumily won the inter­hall championshps last year, and judging from tlrnir 35-0 drubbing of Pangborn Ila!! this past Thursday. they may well be setting up for a repeat. 
Welsh wasted no time, scor­ing on tlw first possession as quarterback Katie Hak threw a long pass that found Jen Grubb. who scored af'tt!r elud­ing two defenders, to put vVl'lsh up 6-0. 
"We wanted to set the tone early and take the momentum from the first snap." Whirlwind Vanessa Lichon said. 
Welsh showecl there offen­sive versatility with their next TD, as Hak combined with Alex Callan on an option play that, after a two-point conversion, brought the score to 14-0. 
Pangborn was stymied by the Welsh defense in their efforts to bring the ball up the field, repeatedly having to resort to punting. 
Hak and Grubb combined again for the third touchdown on a smooth triple reverse play that put Welsh out of the Phoxes reach. up 22-0. 
The high point of' the game for Pangborn was an intercep­tion by Katrina Paulson late in the first half, but it was to no avail as Lichon returned the favor and intercepted a Pangborn pass and returned it for a 6<)-yard touchdown. 
The Whirlwinds rounded out the scoring as Hak found Lichon for the fifth and final touchdown or the evening. 
Pangborn is looking to devel­op a solid base for next years team. "Obviously there's room for improvement on all f'acets of our game. We're focusing on fundamentals," captain Erin 

Piroutek said. 
The Whirlwinds are assured 
of a playoff spot but are not 
overconfident. 
"The thing about the playoffs is that our record means noth­ing," Bak said. "Everyone starts l'rom square one." 
Added Lichon: "We are lucky because almost our whole team has playoff experience. something very valuable as we head into our final month of the season." 
Welsh mav well round out the season ·without a single loss. and Callan attributed their success lo their mantra of "one game at a timc." 
Hak concurred adding. ''We have to play every game as l'ocused as the next. We need to correct the mistakes we have made and just keep improving." 
The defending champs can be seen on Stepan Field Thursday at 7 p.m. versus the Howard Ducks, while Pangborn will look for its first win against Lewis at 8 p.m. 
Cavanaugh 13, Howard 0 
Cavanaugh used key offen­sive plays to support an aggressive defensive effort and recorded a 13-0 win over Howard Hall on Thursday night. 
With the victory Cavanaugh improves to 3-0 on the season­while lloward drops to 2-2 overall. 
"Cavanaugh played a great game," Howard coach Brad Untiedt said. "They made a couple big plays and that was the difference in the ball­game." 
Each team made strong runs toward the end zone in the first half but fell short as the first half ended 0-0. 
But in the second half Cavanaugh got on the board with just under 9 minutes left. 
The drive began when 

Cavanaugh intercepted Jill Veselik's pass at their own 17­yard line and ran it back to the 38. 
Cavanaugh quarterback Lynn Olszowy threw to Megan Laird to give the Chaos a 6-0 lead. 
Howard made a strong march into Cavanaugh territo­ry but was unable to convert on fourth down due to strong Cavanaugh pressure. 
With under a minute remain­ing, Lynn Olszowy threw a 40­yard pass to Melissa Marcotte who ran the ball in for a touchdown. 

Cavanaugh completed a one­point conversion to give Cavanaugh a 13-0 victory. 
Although held scoreless, Howard wide receiver Elizabeth Klimek was steady all game and quarterback Jill Velesik scrambled for yards and led a steady offensive effort. 
Megan Myers and Brigette Alge both hauled in intercep­tions !'or Cavanaugh, which has had interceptions in all three games. 
Although the offense has come through with big plays, the defense remains unscored upon so f'ar this season. 
"Our offensive line played great," coach Bart Bruckert said. "We have a solid defense and we're looking forward to playing Welsh.''.

lhey'II need to get used too. 
"Everyone is going to do this," Waldrum said. "Teams are just going to be that way. We just need to have some patience." 
The relatively easy nature or both victories allowed Waldrum to rest some play­ers and get others some valu­able playing time. 
"We needed to rest some 

players," Waldrum said. 
Perhaps the only sour note in an otherwise sweet week­end for the Irish was an injury sustained by freshman sensation Amy Warner. Warner injured her knee in the first half against Seton Hall but continued playing. Waldrum held her out Sunday as a precautionary measure. The true extent or the injury will not be known until later today when Warner will be examined by specialists. Warner was mov­ing gingerly on the her heavi­ly wrapped leg after the Hutgers game, and speculat­ed that the injury might be her ACL. Losing Warner for any significant period of time would be detrimental to an offense that relies heavily on her speed. 
"We'll know more tomor­row," Waldrum said. "To me it didn't seem too serious." 
Any serious injury to Warner could be a serious blow to a team that has already demonstrated itself as a serious contender for the national title. 
Irish

score up at two goals each. 
After the quick breakout of offense, the game looked head­ed towards overtime as scoring slowed down until the 78:'.B mark, when Barton took assists from Porter and Mark Sikora and put the ball past Tait fur the ucciding point. 
With less than five minutes 
remaining, Irish l'rc.sbman 
Justin Detter had possession 
inside the Pittsburgh box 
before being pushed down by a 
Panther player. The referee, 
who had given Irish defender 
Andy Forstner a yellow card 
earl.icr in the game fur a simi­
lar play, made no call and let 
play continue. 
Despite Apple's repeated appeals towards the referee to come over to the Irish bench and discuss the play. the refer­ee appeared oblivious and let the cluck run down while trouncing Notre Dame's final opportunity tu send the game into overtime. 
Despite the problems with the officiating, Apple feels that the truly disturbing aspect of the game for the Irish was their defensive play. 
"We weren't scoring goals, so our training concentration switched towards the attack," explained Apple following the loss. "I expect those guys in the back to be mature enough to keep that discipline that we've trained for the past four weeks and remember those things that we've learned. Its like a comprehensive exam. you have to retain that infor­mation." 
Bather than continuing th,~ solid defensive play that allowed the Irish to outshout ranked Bradley and Connecticut, thn defense gave up three goals for only the sec­ond time this season. /\pple focls that Urn performance was a step away from the defensive mentality that has boon suc­cessful for the Irish this sea­son. 
"I was a little frustrated with those guys. I felt like our defense took a stnp backwards against Pittsburgh," said Apple. "We let in soft goals in my opinion. Those guys have to be better; they have to be more mature. They can't take backwards and expect us to win." 
The game was played in front or a significantly larger crowd than previous home games, partly due to a promo­tion the team put on earlier in the day for the fans. Tait and follow goalkeeper Cole Straub manned a goal in front of South Dining Ilall during the afternoon, allowing fans to take shots on the two goalies. Haffle tickets and schedules were passed out, with prizes given out during half'time. 
Also during halftime, chil­dren competed in a goal-kick­iug contest. After the chil­dren's contest, two Notre Dame students competed in the "long-kick" competition, with Keough llall sophomore Dan Beissel claiming a $25 Chili's gift certificate for his punt that sailed past the mid­field. 
"The promotion was awe­some," said Apple. "The stu­dents seemed to have a lot of fun. Our guys had a lot or fun. Knott Ilall came out in f'orcc."

Oaklar1d clinches AL

Associated Press 
OAKLAND, Calif. 

Jason  Giambi  had  three  
words  for  the  New  York  
Yankees.  
"Uring  them  on!"  he  

exclaimed in the champagne­drenched Oakland clubhouse after the Athletics clinched the AL West title and a first­round playoff series against the two-time World Series champions. 
Tim lludson earned his 20th victory. beating the Texas Hangers 3-0 Sunday in the regular-season finale. 
It was scoreless until Ramon llernandez hit an RBI double in the seventh, and Randy Velarde and Olmedo Saenz each added solo home runs in the eighth. 
The A's, who will go to the playoffs for the firf;t time since 1992. join Atlanta as the only teams with 11 division titles. 
After the game, the A's spilled onto the field in cele­bration. Matt Stairs and some of his teammates hoisted Giambi on their stoulders and paraded him before the sell­out crowd, which chanted "MVP1 MVP!" 
Giambi batted .400 in September with 13 hom1i runs and 32 BBi. The last Oakland player with that many home runs in a month was Mark McGwire in July, 1996. 
Although he ,/\las hitless Sunday, Giambi had 43 home runs and 137 HBI this season. 
"I can't even describe this," Giambi said, soaked in cham­pagne aftnr the game :ind dwarfed by a the swarm of reporters and television cam­eras around him. "There are no words t'or this. I mean, it's been incredible coming to the ballpark every day. My broth­er (Jemmy) is playing with me. It's unbelievable" 
With the victory, the 

"Everyone has had someone who had cancer, and these players put a lot of' thought into selecting who they would be playing for." Irish head coach Uave Poulin said. 
The game started off quickly as senior Chad Chipchase put the Blue squad on the board exactly two minutes into the game·with a soft· shot that barely went past Gold squad goalie Tony Zasowski. After that lhe defenses took over for both squads, and there was very little offensive action on the ice. 
With 1 :31 left in the first peri­od Matt Van Arkel put one past Zasowski. and the Blue went into intermission leading 2-0. The scrimmage featured two 22-minute periods rather than the usual three 20-minute peri­ods. 
The second period loosened things up a bit as both squads began to get more offensive action. Penalty shots played an important role in the second period scoring. 
Athletics avoided a trip to Tampa Bay for a makeup game Monday and got extra time to prepare for the play­offs. Oakland's game at 
Tampa Bay  on  Sept. 18  was  
postponed  because  of  
Hurricane Gordon.  

The Cleveland Indians beat Toronto 11-4 earlier in the day, preventing the A's from clinching a playoff spot prior to their game.

Irish make quick work of Wildcats, Boyas 
By RACHAEL PROTZMAN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame vol!Pyball team toµµcd Villanova. and CPorgetown lo mov11 to an undefnated 2-0 in Big EasL play. 
"I think it was a good start to our 
Big East season. said junior Marcie Bomhack. "-Overall 

we did a IKreher good jou this weekend but tlrnro's always room for improvement and with the Big East teams I think that we could beat them a little better." The Irish. 11-4 on the sea­son. dominated the Wildcats ( 15-5, 15-2. 15-Y) Friday in games one and two of the matd1 before al lo wing Villanova to take the lead at 6­2 in game three The Irish came back strong to earn the win. 

Notre Dame has an unde­feated record against the -Wildcats with eight previous 
wins over Villanova. The Wildcats are now at 6-10 on the 2000 season. 
Notre Dame combined for a .351 hitting percentage against the Wildcats while senior co-captain Christi 

Ginon racked up eight kills Lo lead the Irish. Junior Kristy Krcher added seven while freshman Jessica Kinder's seven kills were a career high.

"I think that Georgetown is one of the best teams in the conference, but in the Big East we know that we're the team to beat," Bomhack said. "We need to make sure that we stay the team to beat and end up undefeated in the Big East." 
The Irish defense held the Iloyas to a .071 hitting per­centage with 14 blocks. Jo Jamcyson and Malinda Goralski combined for 12 of the blocks.

Doping scandals overshadow Olympic performances 
The Olympics couldn't have ended sooner. 
Not because I think the sports are stale or because they let pro­fessionals compete now. Not even because the only coverage we could watch here was of tape­delayed events that happened sometime during exams last May. 
In fact, I really wanted to watch Marion Jones and Maurice Greene run the finals of the 100 meters. even though I knew earlier in the day that they both had already won. 
But I was ready to see these Olympics go because I couldn't take much more of the govern­ing body of the games, the International Olympic Committee (IOCJ, or the media covering the events. 
Going into Sydney, most peo­ple knew of Marion Jones's well­publicized goal of winning five gold medals in track and field, something that's never been done before. 
Shortly after she won gold number one in the 100 meters, reports surfaced that her hus­band and world champion shot putter, C.J. Hunter, had failed four tests for performance­enhancing drugs since July. 
Big news, right? 
It was, but only should have been if Hunter had even planned on competing in the Olympics. His only reason for going to Sydney, however, was to support his wife. He decided before the 

Ted Fox 
Fox Sports ... 
Almosl 

games even started not to com­pete due to a knee injury. 
And all of this, of course, assumes lhal he even did some­thing wrong. 
Just look at gymnast Andreea Raducan. She won lhe gold medal in the all-around competi­tion before the IOC discovered her great transgression -taking an over-the-counter cold med­ication from the team doctor that contained traces of a banned substance. 
She took something to treat a cold. and the IOC took her gold medal, even though they acknowledged the treatment gave her no advantage over the other gymnasts. 
JI' banned substances can be found in cold medicine, and if 
C.J. Hunter did in fact test posi­tive four times, doesn't it make you wonder if he even knew he was taking them'? 
lt's now well documented that traces of performance-enhanc­ing drugs can be found in any­thing from Raducan·s cold medi­cine to nutritional supplements that don't list all their ingredi­ents. Many expect the latter in Hunter's situation. 
Hunter himself made the point that in 10 years of throwing the shot put. his distance has increased by only six inches. That's not exactly the mark of someone reaping the benefits of a banned substance. 
He cried through his press conference, telling everyone he didn't know how he tested posi­tive but that he planned on figur­ing out how it could've hap­pened. 
According to the IOC, it doesn't matter how the drugs got there, even when the circumstances of the "doping" situation are ridicu­lous. 
I use the word "doping" because that seems to be the favorite buzzword of every writer covering the Olympics. "Doping" scandals involve peo­ple knowingly doing hard drugs, whether they be steroids or heroin. They don't involve ath­letes unknowingly depositing junk in their blood streams. 

If reporters aren't buzzing about doping, they're asking ath­letes still on the field of play whether or not they used a banned substance. 
"Congratulations on winning your gold medal" is usually an afterthought. 
The public's right to know has turned into our right to get sick. Yes, the sports world needs to be monitored to prevent abuses that not only hurt the games but, far more importantly. the ath­letes involved. Investigative reporting plays an invaluable role in this. 
But no, I didn't need to see people try to bring down Hunter's name when he wasn't even competing, just like I don't need to hear about Pete Rose betting on baseball every time he's in public. 
Since it's very possible Hunter could have tested positive for an innocent reason, why not give him a chance to prove that before hurting both him and his wife? It's not like the shot put event was being compromised by him watching. 
I also didn't need to see a 15­year-old Raducan lose her Olympic gold medal amidst a "doping" scandal just because 
-

she had a runny nose. If that's the standard, I would like to for­feit my section football team's tie last Thursday because I played after taking, yes, cold medicine my mom sent me. 
There was some consolation, at least for Hunter. His wife didn't win five golds, but Marion Jones did get three along with two bronze, becoming the first woman to ever win five medals in track and field in one Olympics. 
Still, I hope Andreea Raducan gets her medal back. I hope C.J. Hunter makes his accusers look foolish, both in fact and how they pursued the case. 
As for the IOC and those who create "doping" scandals? I hope they get their priorities straight.

The Albion College Britons 
used its home field advantage 
to ring the Belles to the tune 
of a 7-0 shutout Friday. 
"We came out flat today," 
forward Heather Muth said. 
"Albion is a strong team," 
Muth said. "They would have 
been beatable any other day." 
The Belles began the game 
defending their zone, and 
throughout the match never 
really made it to the other side 
of the field to mount an offen­
sive effort. 
A solid start helped the Brits 
to an early lead with strong 
support from their offensive 
line. Breaking out early was a 
challenge for the Belles. 
"We need to start strong," 
Bolles head coach Jason 
Milligan said. 
"[Albion] had the ball in the 
net at the beginning of the 
game." 

A solid start helped the 
Brits, while they also had an 
impressive offensive line. 
However, the fact that 
Albion is top in the MIM was 
just a contributing factor in 
the Belles loss. 
"We have injuries, everyone 
is stressed, and we are losing 
to teams we could beat," 
Belles forward Shawna 
Jiannoni said. "We are at a 
point in our season where we 
are all a little discouraged." 
There were small victories . in the game. Tia Kapphahn 
made 9 saves after starting in 
goal for the Belles and fresh­
man Laura Metzger made 11 
saves. 

"We are working on keeping the team morale up," Jiannoni said. "Once that happens and the chemistry goes up, we will click as a team, and we will win." 
The Belles used the match against the Britons to realize their weaknesses. They hope to use the knowledge gained in this game to continue to build the 2000 Belles squad into a formidable team, said coaches and players. 
"We need to work on assert­ing ourselves in the lirst half," Belles assistant coach Jared Hochstettler said. "We always seem to play better in the first half." 
The squad looks to turn the tables at home later in the season, where they will face off against Albion for a second time. 
"I am looking foreward to playing them at home," Muth said. "I think we can definitely give them a good game." 
Although they failed to gain a win, the Belles felt that the experience gained in the loss against top-ranked Albion will be helpful in the future. 
"I do not think that the score reflected how we played," Belles midfielder Lynn Taylor ... said. 
"This game showed us that we are still working on playing as a team," junior midfielder Adrian Kirby said. "But we are improving in every game." 
The Britons remain unde­feated and at the top of the MIAA standings with a 6-0 record. The Belles now have a record of 2-3-1 in the MIM. Their next game is at Hope College on Oct. 4.

With no Notre Dame football game this weekend the South Bend athletic focus switched temporarily to women's tennis as the Irish hosted the Eck Classic at the Courtney Tennis Center. 
The Notre Dame wcimcn·s tennis team played well this wr.ekend considering they were without top players Michelle Dasso and Becky Varnum and were fac­ing some or the top teams in the coun­trv.

"I had a little disappointment on Friday," Neighbours said. "But I feel good that I was able to rebound and fin­ish undefeated the rest of the weekend." 
The doubles teams, which seemed to be the weak spot last week in Baltimore, rose to the challenge and came out tough this weekend. 
The tournament was highlighted for the Irish by the play of Nina Vaughan and freshman Alicia Salas and juniors from Corona Del Mar, 
CA, had an impressive 

tournament in singles as well. She ended up placing third in Flight A singles by del'eating freshman teammate Caylan Leslie. Vaughan, a junior, is coming off a 20-win season in doubles and is looking to establish her­self as one of the lrish's top players. 
Freshman Alicia Salas, who advanced to the finals for the second time in her short career on Sunday, has played very well in her first collegiate tournaments. Salas, a four-time singles state champi­on in high school, looks to be improving each week and hopes to get her first finals victory sometime soon.

Irish pick up weekend wins over Pirates, Knights 
By KEVIN BERCHOU Sport< Wrircer 
The Notre Dame women's soccer con­tinued its strong start this weekend as it moved to 11-0-0 with conference victo­ries over the Seton I!all Pirates and the Scarlet Knights of Hutgers. 
Playing perhaps its toughest Mid­Atlantic division foe in Seton llall the Irish plundered the Pirates. out-shoot­ing them 34-2 before winning by the lopsided rnargi.n of 6-0. The Irish returned to battle Sunday. leaving the Scarlet Knights sening red with an easy 2-0 win. 


'Tm very happy with the weekend," Irish head coach Randy Waldrum said. "l thought we did a lot of things well." 
Senior All-American Anne Makirnrn scored a pretty early goal off a cross from junior Lindsey Jones before five different Irish players contributed tal­lies of their own to cap the 6-0 win. 
After waltzing through their hyped showclown with Seton Hall, things became tougher for much ballyhooed No.I-ranked Notre Dame on Sunday. Though the Scarlet Knights of Hutgcrs were not at the same talent level as Nolrc Dame, they gave I.he Irish fits by keeping to a strict defensive style that made scoring chances scarce. 
"We didn't plan on sitting back," Rutgers head coach Glenn Crooks said. "I think that's a credit to Notre Dame. They almost pushed us to play that way, but we came out to play." 
Whether or not he intended to play defensively and escape South Bend with a tie. Crooks' plan worked. Though the Irish outshot the Knights 12-0 in the game's first half, the scoreboard still read 0-0. signifying a moral victory for Rutgers. 
"We were happy at the half," said Crooks. "We could have played better but we were happy to have it 0-0 and still be in the match." 
A Knight defender inadvertently touched the ball in the goal box giving the grateful Irish a penalty kick. Anne Makinen buried the ensuing shot high into the left corner for her 60th career goal giving Notre Dame a lead they would never concede. 
"That goal killed us," Crooks said. "We reallv never recovered." Added ·waldrum: "It's tough when 
you're playing for that tic, and they get that goal. "Hutgcrs doesn't havo the ability to come out and get it back. When you pack it in and you do give one away it is psychologically demoral­izing." 
Amanda Guertin put the Knights, who were already on life support. out of their misery with a goal just seconds later. After taking a pass l'rom Vanessa Pruzinsky, Guertin sent a perfect shot across the goalmouth and into the bot­tom right hand corner. 
"She's about one of the only players out there who can make a shot like that," Waldrum said. 
After out-shooting Hutgcrs 31-0 and only scoring twice. the Irish were con­cerned about defenders packing tho box against them. but realize it's a style
