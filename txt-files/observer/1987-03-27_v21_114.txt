PTL founder may face dismissal from church 
Associated Press 
FORT MILL, S.C. -The PTL's new leaders said Thursday that Jim Bakker and his wife would stay on the payroll but must not be active in the ministry, while Bakker's church said he might face dismissal for "moral failure" in a sexual liaison seven years ago. 
"The body of Christ is too valuable to be a party to bickering and conflict,'' the Rev. Jerry Falwell said after the new PTL board held its first meeting in an attempt to restore harmony after the tumultuous disclosures of recent days. "We are determined that Satan will not have a field day." 
Falwell said the board had agreed to an independent audit of PTL's finances and also would consider taking out a $50 million loan from an unidentified source in Great Britain to consolidate its debts. 
Meanwhile, the woman with whom Bakker had the encounter told reporters she was "deeply concerned" that churchgoers everywhere should understand the current scandal "has no reflection upon the Lord.'' 
"I don't want people under the im.,., pression this goes on everywhere. ·It does not go on everywhere," Jessica Hahn said outside her West Babylon, N.Y., home. 
Earlier Thursday, a newspaper re­ported that PTL lawyers had agreed two years ago to pay Ms. Hahn and her representatives $265,000, far more than the $115,000 initially reported. 
Bakker resigned as head of the tele­vision ministry last week, saying he had been blackmailed over the liaison and that there was a "diabolical plot" to take over the 500,000-member PTL. 
Probe continues investigation of Philly 'cellar of horrors' 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA -A man accused of keeping half-naked women chained in his secret cellar of horrors for torture, rape and killing, and of stock­piling human limbs in a freezer was ordered held without bond Thursday. 
Only when a woman went to police Wednesday, saying she had escaped from the run­down row house in north Philadelphia, did police begin to suspect something foul was in the cellar of Gary Heidnik, a 43-year-old licensed practi­cal nurse. 
Heidnik was arrested after police went to the house and found three young women, naked from the waist down, chained in the basement. They also found 24 pounds of human limbs in a freezer and other body parts in the kitchen, police said. 
By day's end, police said they found the body of a wo­man in remote woods in south­ern New Jersey and arrested a second suspect, Cyril Brown, a sometime occupant of the house. Brown was charged with murdering two women. 

The survivors, ages 18 to 24, spoke of torture and rape, of a skeletal head in a cooking pot and a human rib cage in an oven, of two women who died in captivity, one electrocuted in a watery pit, one killed in a fall. 
"He handcuffed me to a pipe and said nothing would happen to me if I cooperated," said Lisa Thomas, 19, one of the women found in Heidnik' s basement. 
"'Just trust me,' he said," Ms. Thomas told the Philadel­phia Daily News from her hospital room. "Then he took the lid off a hole and two girls came out." 
One of the three women was in stable condition Thursday at Episcopal Hospital, where she was being treated for dehydration, malnutrition and sexual abuse. Ms. Thomas, who spent the night at the hospital, and another woman had been treated and released, hospital spokesman Anthony Cirillo said. 
''We do not believe there is any evidence of blackmail," the Rev. G. Raymond Carlson, general superin­tendent of the Assemblies of God, said in a statement at a news conference at church headquarters in Springfield, Mo. 
"To the contrary, the evidence seems to indicate that effort and money have been expended to cover moral failure. We are deeply sorry to have to say this. We grieve for the impact all this has had upon the entire Christian commu­nity." 
Carlson said evidence gathered by the presbyters will be sent to the North Carolina Presbytery, which has juris­diction over the South Carolina-based PTL. 
"The complete procedure must and will be followed to determine whether resignation or dismissal is in order," Carlson said. 
Bakker has offered his resignation to the Assemblies of God, his 2-million­member Pentecostal denomination, but no action has been taken. 
The new PTL board agreed at its meeting in Fort Mill, S.C., to have a 
_ committee independently audit P"J:L's finances and determine whether any criminal acts· were involv-ed.in.,the.al-~"'· leged blackmail scheme. A financial statement distributed by Falwell showed PTL assets of $172 mil­lion and total current liabilities of $42.1 million. Other long-term debt was listed at $28.2 million. The $50 million loan would con­solidate the ministry's short-term debts into a long-term obligation, he said. "In the last 12 weeks, particularly the

Ms. Thomas said she had eaten nothing but dog food, dog biscuits and water since Heidnik lured her to his house three days before Christmas with a flashy car and offers of money for clothes and res­taurants. 
She said she slept in the dirt at the bottom of the pit wearing only a shirt, but said her captor occasionally enter­tained her and the others. "He'd take us upstairs and chain us to the bannister and show us videos . . . regular movies, like 'Splash,' " Ms. Thomas said. 
Neighbors said they had complained of foul odors and heard loud music coming from Heidnik's house. Police said they had no record of the reports but were investigat­ing. 
"It smelled terrible -like someone left a big piece of steak in the fire," said Doris Zibulka, 32, his next door neighbor. "I called the police and an officer came over. The music was playing and

Judge elected as new 
Judicial Coordinator 
By ROB HENNIG 
Copy Editor 
Brendan Judge, co-chairman of the Keenan Judicial Board, was unanimously elected Judi­cial Coordinator for the next academic year. 
"Brandon has the advantage . . . that his J -board has been active in his dorm," current Judicial Coordinator Maria Cintron said. 
"He's done a lot of good work on the J-Council this year. He'll be a good leader and get the job done. 
"I think the momentum is going to make Judicial Council far better next year," Cintron added. 
Judge said he has several ideas for next year. 
"I'd like to meet each rector personally and discuss the role of the J -board in his dorm,'' Judge said. 
In addition, Judge indicated he would consider having Judi­cial Council run elections. "I wouldn't mind taking on elec­tions if the council were behind me, but that, of course, would come only after several discus­sions with the new administra­tion," Judge said.' 
Cintron, however, voiced op­position to running elections. "I don't feel J-Council should have to do it," Cintron said. 
"I don't want to see the J­Council running the election as OBUD did. I think there needs to be a Committee established in student government,'' Cintron added. 
Keenan Board Co-Chairman Kevin Gleason said supervis­ing elections would not be that much of a new burden. "It's not that big of a job," Gleason said. 
Cintron was chairwoman of the committee that supervised 
class  officer  elections  after  
Ombudsman  withdrew  from  
governing elections.  

In other business, the Council discussed the reaction of last meeting's rector presentation on the effective use of J-boards. 
"I got some really positive feedback from the rectors who did go," Cintron said.

Letters to the Editor show the humor in life 
I guess I have come to expect it. 
In my position as Viewpoint Editor, I receive many letters each week. Some are serious, some are funny; some deal with politics, some deal with campus events. And most of these letters appear everyday on the Viewpoint page. 
But, there's also a story behind some of the letters that never make it to print. These are the mysterious letters that rest in a file in the back of my desk. Surprisingly, most letters that comprise this collection are not from angry stu­dents or teachers. Most, but not all, come from outside our immediate community. 
The first letter that tops my list of favorites was submitted by an anonymous parent of a Notre Dame student. The parent was upset be­cause when she visited the campus and walked into her daughter's room, she was shocked to find her daughter's roommate in bed with her boyfriend. 
The parent felt that by boys being in girls' rooms a message was being sent to the com­munity at large; ''The message you send by demanding (boys being allowed in girls' bedrooms) is 1. you don't respect the laws of God or the Catholic Church and/or 2. you have no hormones.'' 
But this situation, which was quite upsetting to the parent, became quite funny after the sit­uation was described in print. 
On the other hand, some letters are a little more creative. For instance, I have been in contact with a person who claimed to be God and a person who claimed to know the devil. 
When reading the many letters from God, I noticed that each starts out in the same way: "My Dear Sir: As Almighty God, I greet you." 
Now, I knew that with my job, I would be in contact with some important people at the Uni­versity and around the country, but I never expected to receive letters from the Big Guy above. 
In writing me, God told me some really per­sonal details about his life here on Earth. He told me that I was not the only one who he had been in contact with. He had also written much of humanity "which consist(s) mainly of News­paper Editors and Publishers.'' 
In another letter, God explained that his "Son is now on Social Security, with a limited in­come." He stated that his Son's income con­sisted mainly of ''a small pension check of $207.43 per month, plus His Social Security benefit of $489.00 per month." 
I was surprised that God became so intimate

with His financial details. Most earthly people like to keep the salaries they make to them­selves, but God was different. He apparently had nothing to hold back. 
I really thought I was in good standing with God since none of my friends had ever received letters from Him. I felt pretty good about life. After all, it's not every day when someone gets a letter from God. 
But, soon my thoughts would change. After God's letter, I got a letter from a man who personally knew the Devil and wrote me to tell me about it. 
He said that "people would never believe me when I told them about Lucifer." The author was concerned because Lucifer told him he had a low opinion of the voters in the United States. He told me that he needed my help in spreading the word that "the U.S. voters don't have a chance to keep from going to hell." I guess you can say that I was surprised to find myself weighted with the fate of mankind on my shoulders. 
But, the devil gave me a way out. By writing this column, and alerting you to this, I think I no longer have to feel the weight of responsi­bility that the devil left me.

'Consumer approach' to sexuality erodes family life, says professor 

By CATHY STACY 
Assistant News Editor 
Artificial reproduction has introduced a "consumer ap­proach to sexuality and mar­riage" which has eroded the notion of fatherhood and as­saulted the rights of the family, said Dr. Donald DeMarco in his lecture last evening on the eth­ical issue of high tech parent­ing. 
"Parenthood becomes in­creasingly arbitrary and ceases to be an aspect of iden­tity...but one that you can pur­chase for a price," he said. Though he did not wish "to create the impression that technology is bad,'' DeMarco presented a critical evaluation of the five current forms of technological parenthood, in­cluding artificial insemination, test tube babies, embryonic transfer from one woman to an­other, extracorporeal gestation and surrogate motherhood. 
DeMarco said fatherhood be­comes tenuous and hypotheti­cal and mothers are viewed as the victims of pregnancy, citing examples of women who have used surrogate mother­hood to prevent the interuption of their careers. "(People) want a commercial selection, the joy without the responsibil­ity and the pleasure without the pain. They exclude marriage, sexual intercourse, genes, gestation and childbearing and still want to be parents." 
DeMarco also questioned the vulnerable position we place ourselves in if ''we accept un­critically what we are given from the medical world'' which hold radically different opinions among themselves. From the very first case of ar­tificial insemination in 1884, doctors have viewed the process as "ethereal" as well as "rape." 
Test tube babies represent "a form of reductionism at its very worst -reducing the entire human being (with which one creates) to the smallest parts,'' he said. The gametes become the parents rather than the mother and father who should "want to love so emphatically that they say we are husband and wife and we are the ones 

who had this child." 
DeMarco finds this threat to 

the personal reality of mother 
and father an "assault on the 
integrity of life, marriage and 
the family." In the case of sur­
rogate mothers, technology is 
also "exploitive," and the 
"real mother" is not the wo­
man who has carried the child 
for nine months, but the woman 
"who is married to a man who 
contributes $10,000 so that she 
can be known as the mother.'' 
DeMarco said this inability 

to claim authorship is consid­
ered fraud in education and 
business, and it should be con-. 
sidered even more of a fraud 
within the context of marriage 
and family. 
DeMarco also said it was 

"too bad" that most people who 
responded to a recent poll re­
garding the Baby M case 
believed that the Stearns 
should be awarded custody of 
the child because of their better 
financial position. Surrogate 
mother Mary Beth Whitehead, 
whom they originally believed 
to be the ideal candidate, 
developed a bond "incarnate 
with motherhood" that could 
not be supressed by any "tech­
nological rhetoric or brain­
washing," said DeMarco. 
As Baby M celebrates her 

first birthday today, she does 
so without a real name, identity 
or home. The court decision 
that will decide who her 
"parents" are is scheduled for 
March 30. 
"Technology can be used to make parents but not mothers and fathers," said DeMarco. Mothers and fathers are not simply qualified by biology, he said, but become persons as the result· of "great personal ef­fort.'' Technoloy has created a "clash between rational, im­patient plans and natural processes.'' 
DeMarco, who is a professor of philosophy at St. Jerome's College in Ontario, will give an­other lecture titled ''Abortion and Compassion" on March 28 at 1 p.m. in the Haggar College Center of Saint Mary's College. This lecture will be proceeded by a showing of the film ''Silent Scream." 
DeMarco's lectures are sposored by the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's Right to Life Group, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, Ius Vitea, and the Federalist SoCiety.

U.S Marine arrested as spy suspect draws additional espionage charges 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Marine Corps has brought additional charges against Sgt. Clayton Lonetree, the first of two Marine security guards ar­rested on suspicion of spying while working at the U.S. Em­bassy in Moscow, Pentagon sources said Thursday. 
The sources, who agreed to discuss the matter only if not identified, said the decision to add five additional charges to the 19 counts already pending had been prompted by the 
recent arrest of another guard, Cpl. Arnold Bracy. 
The sources declined to dis­cuss the specific allegations un­derlying the new charges. But they said the charges included another count of espionage; two counts of conspiracy to commit espionage, and two counts of "espionage-related" general misconduct charges. 
The new count of espionage brings to two the number of such charges pending against the 25-year-old Lonetree. Un­der the Uniform Code of Mili­tary Justice, a conviction on an espionage count carries a max­imum penalty of death. 
The sources said the new charges were ''directly related to the surfacing of Bracy," a 21-year-old corporal who worked with Lonetree in Mos­cow for roughly eight months in 1985 and 1986. 
According to the sources, military and State Department investigators now suspect that Bracy and Lonetree, working together, may have provided Soviet agents access to the Moscow embassy during after­work hours. It appears there were times when the two men were paired as the only guards at the embassy, one source ex­plained 
The Marine Corps said it ar­rested Bracy last week at the Marine base at Twentynine Palms, Calif., on the basis of information developed in its continuing probe of Lonetree. 
The sources said Thursday they expected Bracy to appear before a military magistrate on Friday who would decide whe­ther he should remain in cus­tody pending the start of an in­vestigation simijar to a civilian grand jury probe. 

Lonetree had already been accused of passing to the Rus­sians the names and photographs of American intel­ligence agents attached to the Moscow embassy's staff. He also had been accused of pro­viding the Soviets with descrip­tions of floor plans and office assignments for the embassies in Moscow and Vienna. 
The sources also said both Bracy and Lonetree became in­volved sexually with Soviet wo­men who were employed at the embassy, which in turn al­legedly led to their recruitment by Soviet agents.

Special Olympics volunteers to be trained for special work 
Associated Press 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. -The In­ternational Special Olympics Committee, having recruited 15,000 volunteers to staff the 1987 summer games, now faces the task of training the volun­teers to work with mentally handicapped athletes. 
Very few volunteers have worked with handicapped youths, and most ask for help in learning how, said Dr. Bonnie Raine, a director at a South Bend sheltered workshop and a Special Olympics volun­teer. 
The key simply is learning to recognize the abilities of the competitors, despite their handicaps, Raine said Friday. "That's what these games are all about. They're a showcase for individual ability," she said. 
"We're showing them what the mentally handicapped can do, not what they cannot do,"

Special Olympics is produc­ing a videotape introduction featuring television actor and writer James Troesh. The 30­year-old Troesh, of Hacienda Heights, Calif., was paralyzed from the neck down at 14 when he was shocked while installing a rooftop antenna. 
Raine recruited Troesh, a family friend, to produce the tape in an effort to close the gap between volunteers and the handicapped athletes. 
Volunteers will watch the tape before serving in the games to be held in late July on the campuses of the University of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Troesh hopes volunteers who watch the tape will recognize him from his ap­pearances in episodes of the television show "Highway to Heaven," and listen to his mes­sage.

Food aid politics discussed by panel 
By MARGARET PFEIL 
News Staff 

A panel discussion on the politics of famine assistance to Ethiopia was featured in the fourth lecture in the Spring se­ries on Ethics and Foreign Policy Thursday night at the Center for Continuing Educa­tion. 
Jason Clay, director of Re­search for Cultural Survival, charged the Ethiopian govern­ment with politicizing famine assistance given primarily from western nongovernmen­tal and private voluntary or­ganizations. 
Passively and actively, Clay said, these agencies col­laborated with the government in extending the famine to pre­viously self -sufficient areas by reinforcing the conditions that had caused the famine. 
The most significant causes of the famine were not drought or lack of food, according to Clay, rather they were govern­ment policies such as resettle­ment and villagization. He said, in 1985, at the height of the famine, Ethiopia tripled their foreign currency reserve and exported 200,000 head of livestock. 
In response, Msgr. Robert Coli, executive director of the Interfaith Higher Appeal, dis­agreed with Clay and said the causes of the famine were not simply political, but were rooted in environmental degradation, overpopulation and war. 
Fred Cuny, the chairman of Intertect, a consulting firm specializing is the manage­ment of emergency relief, sup­ported Coil's position that the famine was not solely due to political causes. 
"There is no such thing as apolitical aid,'' Cuny said to the audience of 60-70 students, fac­ulty and clergy. "We need to improve decision-making in the system." 
Clay said that the people of Ethiopia were forced to sell their grain, including surpluses, to the government and then had to buy subsistence grain from western agencies such as CARE. Western food assistance was used as bait to trap people into resettling on the promise of receiving food in areas where, in fact, there was none. 
Cuny of Intertect said that Clay's statements against resettling were not completely justified because the U.S. had proposed that as early as 1968 and had been funding that since 1976. 
Clay attributed the manipulation of the western agencies to their lack of under­standing as manifested in their

failure to insist on an indepen­dent assessment of the causes of the famine, its effect and the monitoring of food programs. 
The agencies are not equipped for research, detailed analysis and project monitor­ing because they deem these processes too lengthy, expen­sive and irrevelant, Clay said. 
Coli said Catholic Relief Ser­vices and the Church Drought Africa Agency knew the causes and anticpated the famine as early as 1982. 
The agencies could not get the public to listen and act until 1984. "We were not duped ­lives were saved and that is what counts," Coil said. 
Further, he said, every re­sponsible agency does have a well-defined program for emergencies encompassing prior assessments, technical assistance, material and finan­cial aid, distribution networks, and evaluation programs. 
While they also try to prepare to the best of their ability, it is difficult given their limited fun­ding, Coli said. "Had we access to funds spent for military pur­poses, maybe we could be more thoughtful." 
Cuny said, the aid of the west­ern agencies did not have an impact either way, having ar­rived mainly at the time that death rates began falling. 
Authorities, neighbors and acquaintances said Heidnik prowled the neighborhood for mentally impaired women, showing off fancy cars before enslaving them in his house, where a sign read: "united 
Church  of  the  Ministries  of  
God."  
Heidnik's  estranged  wife,  

Betty Heidnik, told WPVI-TV that Heidnik began the church in 1970, and that it had a con­gregation of fewer than a dozen people, some of whom were mentally retarded. 

Heidnik was ordered heJd without bail pending an April 1 hearing on a murder charge in the slaying of Debbie Johnson, 23, whose partly buried, naked body was found Wednesday in a southern New Jersey forest, authorities said. 
Heidnik also was ordered held in lieu of $1 million bail on four counts of rape and related charges including kidnapping, officials said.

Norm 'Bundle-of-the-week' Muller resigns from laundry 

By ROB HENNIG Copy Editor 
Norm Muller, known at Notre Dame for his sports predictions and bundle-of-the­week giveaways, has resigned as director of Saint Michael's laundry and dry cleaning. 
Muller said he resigned for personal reasons on March 1 or 2 and declined to elaborate. "I just had a good time and I really enjoyed you guys. It's time to move on," Muller said. 
According to Muller, he ar­rived at Notre Dame in 1975 as Commander of the U.S. Air Force ROTC detachment here. After retiring from that posi­tion, Muller started at Saint Mi­chael's as assistant director in 1978. He took over as director in 1982.

Students need support when confronted by law 

At approximately midnight on Friday, February 28, numerous

t ! marked and unmarked police cars con­ducted a raid upon my house on East Navarre Street. As a result of the op­eration against our quiet, self­contained party, one out of 100 people were cited for underage drinking and one of my housemates was incar­cerated on the charge of selling alcohol without a permit. The "criminal" was then handcuffed behind his back and first placed in a paddy wagon and then a patrol car. Four kegs and two taps were confiscated as "evidence" by the police. Numerous guests were harassed and threatened by the police, who came into our house by forcing themselves past two close friends who demanded warrants and evidence of a crime in progress, and who themselves came close to being arrested.

l guest columnI 
I . It is my contention that more crimes were perpetrated by the members of the police force than by the residen~s of my house and our guests. Although I am only a senior government major with little legal experience, I am cer­tain that the police acted improperly and perhaps even unconstitutionally. First, giving of breathalizers in a house has long been disputed by many concerned citizens and students, yet no legal resolution to the problem has been made in the state of Indiana. I have been informed by afriend, though, that a case was tried in the state of Illinois and the r~ling went against the police department. Second, the definition of "probable cause" in this case was hazy at best. No attempt was made to point out the "officers" that were in our house nor how the police deemed the party to have the probable cause of having minors there. Is the mere existence of a party becoming a de facto "probable cause" for the investigation of a "crime?" Third, my arrested housemate was neither read his rights nor permitted to place a phone call. I thought that the reading of rights was guaranteed by the "Miranda" decision of the Supreme Court. Was it an actual arrest? The "suspect" was handcuffed, brought to the police station, photographed, and held on bail. It is clear he was arrested, but why was he not afforded all of his rights? 
Fourth, the conduct of the police was somewhat less than polite. Abusive lan­guage was used throughout the raid un­til the Channel 28 news cameras were turned on. The police then started ad­dressing the guests and residents as "sir" or "m'am." When we addressed the police -using phrases such as ''with all due respect,'' -we were not paid attention to and threatened with arrest for "obstruction of justice" or being a "public nuisance." When we asked the arresting officers how much the bail was set for they replied "$50," but upon 
Doonesbury 
entering the police station two of us found that it had been changed to $100 and received the comment, "Next time bring someone who is 21," (both stu­dents were 21). 
Lastly, would any of this in in our case or that of others really stand up in a court of law? The burden of proof by law must rest with the police. Can they prove the charge of "selling" "al­cohol" without a license? If cups are sold at a party' does that constitute in­tent to sell alcohol? What if cups are sold but guests don't have to use those cups to consume the alcohol? Would that be the same thing? If one asks for money for a cup, is that the same thing as saying, "you must pay to drink al­cohol?" What if donations were asked to help defray the costs of potato chips, while the bar was technically free? There are many scenarios that can be extrapolated from this situation, even though they all rest on technicalities. Yet isn't that what a criminal case can be thrown out for -technicalities? The burden of proof must rest with the police in establishing intent with respect to the letter of the law. And what about the reading of rights and the allowance of a phone call? Doesn't the absence of such measures con­stitute grounds for the dismissal of charges? Do the police think that Notre Dame students are second-rate citizens who don't merit proper treatment un­der the law, or that we are either too stupid to realize that our rights have been violated, or too meek to expend the time and the efforf needed to pros­ecute the case? Whatever is the case, something must be done by us. 
The students of Notre Dame have been pushed around by the police long enough. They think that we have nei­ther the time nor the money to prose­cute the case and that therefore we can­not touch them. Perhaps they are right in a sense. This is, however, the reason why I am writing this letter. The Ob­server reports that it has a subscription size of over 12,000 many of which are mailed around the nation to friends and alumni of Notre Dame. It is to you who have either the time, money, or expe­rience that I make my plea. 
I call on the friends of Notre Dame, the alumni, and other interested parties to aid the Notre Dame student body. Is there someone out there -a lawyer in New York, a businessman in Chicago, or a concerned parent who still believes in the protection of our rights -who can help us? Is there a lawyer in the South Bend area who is interested in handling a controversial case and possibly gaining notoriety? Is there someone in the law school who can advise us or give us counsel? Is there someone who can show us how to raise the money and find the time to fight this in a court of law? We need your help! This is not an attempt by a student to simply, ''fight for our right to party.'' I did that three years ago on the steps of the Ad­ministration building. Beer is not the issue here -the letter of the law is. I furthermore cannot be hypocritical and condemn the police while condoning the underage use of alcohol. That choice is up to the individual. What I am con­demning is the trampling of rights. I will enter the military in two months and I have been sworn to protect the United States Constitution. If this is the same Constitution under which such ac­tivities of the local police are allowed, then it is not worth the effort. If you can help or are just angry enough to do 


P.O.BoxQ 
Church encourages acceptance of teaching 
Dear Editor: 

Steve Hipp's long and elegantly con­structed defense of Catholic fundamen­talism in his March 4 column suffers from the same peculiar flaw that all other types of fundamentalism suffer from. 
He says that "the Church has (a) divine mandate to preserve, interpret, promulgate and defend the fixed deposit of faith .... Being Catholic means ... that ... one accepts the divinely in­stituted teaching authority of the Church on depositum fidei. This is C~th­olic Faith." His argument boils down to the following: individual Catholic believers should not exercise their freedom to think in ways that disagree with what the hierarchy teaches, not just because what they end up believing is itself wrong, but more fundamentally because the very notion that there is something to decide upon is itself "ex­ternal to (and) against the teaching of the Church.'' This seems to be what some of the picketers outside of the recent abortion debate had in mind when they painted their signs to read "Abortion is not debatable." They did not care whether Burtchaell or Maguire ''won'' the debate bec~use they did not think that it should have occurred in something, please contact me and we will try to do something instead of being chickens who go meekly to the slaughter by pleading "guilty." The police of this area have printed on their cars the slogan ''To Serve and Protect." They have been doing nei­ther. Let's change that. 
Evan Farley is a senior government major. 
the first place. Merely having it was, to them, a sign of theological and eth­ical surrender. 
Here is where the fundamentalist flaw resides. The very notion of choice includes the possibility of choosing "against" as well as "for." If one could only choose "for" certain teachings of the hierarchy, for instance, then no no­tion of choice would be present. But clearly Mr. Hipp thinks that a proper exercise of Catholic Christianity in­volves choices; he must, since he spends so many pages telling us how to make them properly. That being so, the possibility of choosing "against" the hierarchy is not only present but in fact is guaranteed. Granted that the hierarchy may not wish for individual Catholics to exercise this option, but here that is at issue only peripherally. What is more important is that the very Church which Mr. Hipp claims to defend promotes a view here that is different than his. That Church, not his, calls for its members to choose whether its magisterial teachings are valid and appropriate articulations of divine truth, or not. It does not want them to choose wrongly, naturally enough, but it places the ultimate burden of respon­sibility on them when it invites them to decide to accept its teachings. For his sake as well as for its, it would be nice if Mr. Hipp chose to join this Church.

Campus bands deserve a compromised policy 
The office of Student Activities has sent out "reminders" to members of campus bands that university policy prohibits the posting of flyers or posters advertising off-campus performances. I qualify the word "reminders" be­cause this policy was never clear to the students it affects before the letters were sent, if the policy as stated even existed beforehand at all. Such adver­tising, the new Student Activities Direc­tor Joe Cassidy reminds us, is restricted to The Observer, Scholastic or WVFI. Unauthorized fliers will be ripped from bulletin boards, and violations are punishable by a $100 fine. 
Mary Jacoby 
guest column 
Bam. That was easy enough. Student Activities has dealt a major blow to campus bands trying to get themselves heard. Fliers are the most effective and cost-efficient way to advertise on a gig on campus. Tacked onto bulletin boards around campus, they let the student body know when and where a band would be playing. Most of the fliers were also quite creative and caught people's eyes better than a tiny classi­fied ad would in The Observer. Without the fliers, a lot less people will know when and where a band is playing. 
Ads in The Observer are also effec­
tive, but who has the money for ad 
inches? A small two column by three 
inch ad costs $25 per day. Most band 
members are lucky if they make half 
that much from a gig. 
Once again the Student Activities Of­fice has confronted a problem not with a solution but with a denial of students' needs. The proliferation of fliers -di­rectly due to the wonderful variety of campus bands this year -should be a concern of Student Activities. Fliers were being taped all over campus, on sidewalks and trash cans, and they were crowding out other announce­ments on bulletin boards. The Univer­sity had no control over these fliers, which were being displayed on Univer­sity property. Some sort of regulation is in order. That's regulation, not abolishment. 
I'm sure most bands would be willing to compromise and allow Student Ac­tivities to approve the fliers before they were posted. For their part, Student Ac­tivities could designate specific boards were the fliers could be tacked. This simple solution would eliminate what Student Activities may consider the un­sightly proliferation of' fliers as well as give the office veto power over offen­sive material (although the recent in­cident with Scholastic demonstrated how dangerous that power can be). Bands would be able to advertise cheaply effectively and creatively. Everyone would be happy! 

Cassidy, the student activities direc-, tor, wasn't in office the first half of this week when I called to ascertain the rationale behind the policy. The secre­tary offered a possible explanation. She said that bands playing at bars were in effect asking people under 21 to break the law by coming to see them. Also, bands advertising dates at bars were advertising private business on Univer­sity property. Without having spoken to Cassidy, I cannot say for sure whe­ther this is the real reason behind ban­ning the fliers on campus; but let's con­sider how fallacious this reasoning is anyway, because such an excuse is typical of University bureaucratic thinking. 
First of all, students under 21 cannot enter bars legally anyway, so fliers an-

P.O.BoxQ 
Exclusive celebrations deny worship to some 
Dear Editor: 
Is it right that a student at Notre Dame is denied the right of exercising his belief in practicing his faith as a Catholic by attending mass on the Sat­urday vigil at 5:15p.m. mass at Sacred Heart Church in the main body of the church because he does not donate $1,000 or more every year and he is not part of the Sorin Society, even though his family contributes $11,000 to pay for his college education? 
This is what happened to me on Sat­urday, Feb. 28, when a friend of mine, accompanied me to Sacred Heart Church for 5:15p.m. mass. I was only permitted to enter the main body of the church because my services as an acolyte were needed for the mass. But my friend was denied admission to the church to worship because his services were not needed. Instead, he had to at­tend mass at the crypt at 5:00 p.m. and then it was already 5:05p.m. 
Do we now have a closed policy on who can attend mass when the large financial supporters of Notre Dame are invited to visit the campus? Are we as­hamed to let our students intermingle and celebrate mass with these people who have donated large sums of money to the University? 
Do not get me wrong, I am very ap­preciative of these people who belong to the Sorin Society. Most of us students would not be here if they did not donate money for scholarships and other fin­ancial programs that are needed to keep this university running and com­petitive. If it was not for them, I prob­ably would not be able to attend this excellent university. 
But should we close off the entire church for them so a mass could be celebrated by Father Hesburgh and the homily given by Father Malloy? Why could they not open up the entire church? I realized, while serving mass, that all the regular seats were taken up in the front and the sides of the altar. Could they not put more seats behind the altar like they do for the major foot­ball games (i.e. the Michigan game this year?). Instead, they crammed all the regular congregation of 5: 15 p.m. mass down into the crypt. Was the University trying to hide the people that regularly attended mass at Sacred Heart? An­other option that the University had was to hold a special mass that was later in time, say about 6:30p.m. 
Overall, the mass was a very beau­tiful ceremony. Would it have been any less than a beautiful ceremony if the regular congregation and students were allowed to partake in the mass with the Sorin Society? Just because we, the students of Notre Dame, are not part of the Sorin Society, does it mean that we are not allowed to pray together with people that may be better off than we are financially and are very , generous with their donations to the University? 
Is the number of people that attended the mass from the Sorin Society the rea­son why students were excluded? Does Pope John Paul II limit the amount of people that are allowed to attend mass in St. Peter's Square when the crowds are enormous? Do societies and money separate the places and time that we are allowed to pray and worship to­gether as a community? Are we, the students and parishioners of Sacred Heart, not the Church of Sacred Heart? It is too bad that the University puts aside their students and Sacred Heart forgets their parishioners when guests visit the University. 
I hope and pray that next year, when the Sorin Society is once again invited, that the University lets the students and parishioners be able to pray and wor­ship with them.

Women in minority due to disparity in pay 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in reponse to Chris Julka's inside column of Wednesday, March 25 concerning sex discrimina­tion. Julka states, "A few thousand dol­lars may seem a lot to me now, but I am sure when I am 50 years old I will barely notice the difference and will probably just laugh at the fact that I could have taken such a frivolous worldly thing so seriously now (Ha!)." It is very likely that he will not miss the "few thousand dollars" and be in the position to laugh about the situation since he will most likely be making a "few thousand dollars more" than his sister in the same iob. Even if he and nouncing bands in bars should be dis­regarded by them. And what difference does it make whether a student under 21 sees an advertisement for a band at a bar in The Observer or posted on a bulletin board? Restricting such adver­tising to campus media exposes the an­nouncement to as many minors as fliers would. 
It seems the University can't stand to let outside businesses such as Lee's Bar and Grill, Duke's Bistro or Chips get a few extra dollars off of University students without paying for it. That's the most logical, albeit petty, reason I can find for the banning of fliers. The University wants bars to pay for adver­tising. To the University that means $25 or so an ad -a miniscule drop in the bucket for them. To the student bands whose responsibility it is to promote their performances, $25 per ad is a lot of money. 
A lot of students form bands because they're bored and it's something fun to do. But it's not worth practicing much if no one ever hears you. Could that be the way the University wants to keep it? Mary Jacoby is a senior American Studies/German major. 
his sister do not pursue similar career goals, comparing his salary with wo­men in the same field clearly reveals discriminatory pay differences. 
When comparing the salaries of workers aged 35-44 with five or more years of college, women continue to receive considerably less pay than males in the same field. For example, female lawyers make an average of $26,319 while male lawyers enjoy an average salary of $47,635; female physicians have an average salary of $41,516 and their male counterparts make an average of $71,972: and in managerial and administrative posi­tions, females have an average salary of $20,003 and males average $38,915. Average women to this day continue to earn only about 62 cents for every dollar earned by average men. If Julka would expand his knowledge of the world beyond his "backyard," I am sure he will find that women, like Hispanics, blacks, and homosexuals, are indeed minorities in this society.

being pretentious, you wanna say it's like reading a book. You can read it for the story or you can get into a little bit deeper or you can try to see how it applies to your life, BLAH BLAH BLAH. You can take it as far as you want to. In fact, you can start reading in meanings that aren't even there. You know what I mean? And so it's like, you know, if all you wanna do is put on "Keep Your Hands To Yourself," and maybe "Railroad Steel" or "Bat­tleship Chains" and just whip the record off and just go "Ok, the rest of that is uh, too heavy." You know, that's cool. That doesn't bother me, maybe someday you'll leave it on because you forgot to take it off and something will get done. You know, I mean, it's better than the Pet Shop Boys. I mean, it just is.

DB: (laughs) Umm, boy that's a rough one. As far as an opening act? 
0: Well, recording, producer, album work, performing... 
DB: Oh, I don't know. I was sitting there when I heard that the Replacements lost Bob Stinson, and I was ready to throw away the band. "PICK ME, PAUU PICK ME! I THINK YOU'RE A GENIUS." Ahem, let's see, he's just like my big hero right now. It's just like he's just got such good songs. I mean, "Little Mascara," I mean, what a rock 'n' roll song! Lyrically. Emotionally. I mean, just soni­cally, it just...it kills. Urn, me and Jason (of Jason and the Scorchers) keep talking about doing a folk duet in New York City.

And uh, Mauro (Magellan, the band's drummer) is like death In 414 time, any beat you want. I mean It's just like he knocks the s---out of me. Everybody's really emotionally committed to the moment. Oooh, that's a quote. I could smell that one as it was coming out, you know what I mean? Anyway, when the band's doin' right, obviously you can't do right all the time, but when the band is doin' right, which is a pretty good amount of the time, it's like everybody's there, everybody's not playing the same chords and doing the (makes robot sounds) you know playing the same way, everybody's just trying to make it as immediate as possible.

DB: More touring. More touring. More touring. Endless, endless touring. 
0: No studio In sight? 
DB: That'd be next year. (Laughs) January of next year is the pencilled date. I want to get all the mileage out of this record that we can. A Iotta bands put out some really great songs on their first record, it doesn't click immedi­ately, they have to go back into the studio and cut a second record or a third record and finally that material starts get­ting pushed and it's like some of their best songs on the first two records are lost. It's like, no way, baby. I don't want it to be like "We got our one hit off this one, let's go." No sirree, I want 'em to put a little push on "Myth of Love" to see what happens here. 
0: Well, I wish you luck. 1 think you'll make it. 
DB: Well, we have kind of made it, you know, as far as selling "A Bunch 0' Records," but as far as like making something that's gonna last, that's just much more Impor­tant. Time will tell. I'm hoping to be put In that kind of cate­gory, but you know that's pretty pretentious to vote your­self in. 
0: What's the line between pretentiousness and ambition? 
DB: Well, I don't know. It's like the Emperor's New Clothes. You know, it's "Aren't I just looking marvelous?" It's one of those things that you can't tell until the time comes around, how many people does this really emotionally affect? Does it stand up? Is it more popular 20 years from now than it was when it came out? Say like the Velvet Underground. Here's a band that as years go by they 
just keep getting more popular. What can you say? Even bands like even as weird as like The Doors had that huge resur­gence at the end of the 70s. Music that lasts. It is more important than selling "A Lot 0' Records." Although that's nice. But it is not personally impor­tant. I'm not gonna be able to remember how many records we sold when I'm 60. I'll be saying "God, that's embarrass­ing" or "God I'm glad I did that." Boom. 


The Observer/Jennifer O'Donald 
Steve Daner, Martin Shubert, Nick Rossi, and Mike Knotts display their 'dirty and base' humor In the Cavanaugh Hall production of 'A Gap In Generations.' 
'A Gap in Generations' 
Cavanaugh puts on a 'dirty' play 
DOUG ANDERSON features writer 
C
avanaugh Hall's production "A Gap in Generations" is currently playing at Washington Hall. Last night's performance played to about 70 people--an audience which was akin to a junior varsity football game, with only friends and relatives in attendance. The show, which benefits the Andy Sowder Memorial Scholarship Fund, continues through Saturday, with performances at 7:30 nightly. 
The play is an adaption of the 16th century Commedia del'arte style. Featured is a group of travelling players which moves into a town and transforms itself into a number of characters who act out a story. They call themselves the Affamati Company and tell the story of two families: the House of Di Besignosi and the House of Di Scaterelli. Both families feature aging fathers who wish they were young, bumbling servants, and eligible, marriage-aged children. 
The families attempt to ar­range a tie between Lelia Di Besignosl (played by Scott Wel­lman) and Isabella Di Scaterelli (Karen Green). The plot focuses on complications caused by a variety of factors. Some of these derive from the women's attempts to trap their respec­tive men (and fortunes) and the men's desire for sex. Adding to these complications is the pres­ence of two women of "ques­tionable" character, who aim to separate the men from their fortunes in return for satisfying certain desires. 
Overall, however, the play leaves a little to be desired. There are some funny scenes and some good performances, but the gaps in between are a bit ·long, and as a result the play seems to drag on. An in­teresting aspect of the play is the combination of traditional themes with modern references thrown in. As Isabella's mentor (Shannon McAuliffe) tries to set up Isabella with her suitor, she 
reads to her student from "The 
Chemistry of Love", by Emil T. 
Hofman. Another plus the play 
provides is the energy that the 
cast exhibits. They offer a 
refreshingly unstuffy style of 
acting. 
One aspect of the play which should delight any audience member is the fact that the actors and actresses are actu­ally having fun onstage. After seeing plays where the actors are distant and removed, the viewer finds that the attitude of the actors in this show helps to deliver a less than admirable script. 
Two standout performances are delivered by Nick Rossi and Shannon McAuliffe. Both per­
form dual roles as members of 
the Houses of Di Besignosi and 
Di Scaterelli, respectively, and 
as the maestro of the Affamati 
Company and his wife. Both 
actor and actress provide en­joyable performances, and they 
manage the character changes 
impressively. 
"A Gap in Generations" offers many good aspects, but the two-hour performance is long, considering the material. The actors try to keep the flow, but the play should be shorter. If you have time before you go out, stop by and see either tonight's or Saturday's perfor­mance and remember to donate to the Sowder Fund as you leave.

avanaugh Hall will present! "A Gap In Generations" itonight and Saturday at 7:30 
p.m. in Washington Hall. The!play, directed and produced by I Kevin Fitzpatrick, centers \ around a group of travelling l players and their performance!in the square at Bologna.

I 
i Fitzpatrick describes the !humor in the show as "veryIphysical, the forerunner of j slap-stick" and compares "A Gap In Generations" to modern I 
situation comedies."The key to I the show is simplicity," Fitzpatrick adds. The produc­
tion mimics the Commedia dell'arte style.

I "Commedia dell'arte produc­
tions were originally done in the streets, for the common people. That's why so much of the humor is base or dirty. It's 
1 written for a simple audience in a way that transcends time and space," Fitzpatrick explained. 
I "Our production of "A Gap In 
!Generations" is set in a 1987 university community, although the text remains Intact, as if we 
were performing in sixteenth-. century Italy." 
This is the fifth year of the Cavanaugh productions to benefit the Andy Sowder Schol­arship Fund. Sowder was Cavanaugh Hail President in 1979. He attended the annual ski trip that year and was brought back early because of an illness. What was thought to be a severe case of the flu turned out to be spinal menin­ginitis. Soon after, he died, unable to live without the aid of a life support system. Cavanaugh Hall rector, Father Matthew M. Miceli, wrote in a letter to the men of Cavanaugh, "I can honestly say that Andy Sowder was one of the finest hall presidents we have ever had. He was a self· less type of guy who gave a lot more to his fellow students 
than he received." In 1979, Cavanaugh Hall Council in­itiated the Andy Sowder Schol­arship Fund. Cavanaugh has raised over $12,000 for the scholarship fund that would benefit a Notre Dame student living in Cavanaugh Hall. Dona­tions to the Andy Sowder fund will be acepted at the door before each production.

JoanKroc sells Padres 
Associated Press 

SAN DIEGO -San Diego Padres owner Joan Kroc has agreed to sell the team to Seattle owner George Argyros, · who put the Mariners on the market Thursday as a step toward winning approval of the Padres transaction. 
Argyros said his purchase of the Padres would satisfy his desire to stay in baseball, while allowing him to keep a closer eye on his real estate interests in Southern California and spend more time with his fam­ily in Newport Beach. 

Word that Argyros was buying the team rekindled speculation that the Padres would renew efforts to sign free agent outfielder Tim Raines, but Argyros downplayed the suggestion.

Aggressive net play, Lohrer's return key weekend women's tennis action 
By SHEILA HOROX Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's tennis team plays on its home courts for the first time this spring as it hosts Indiana State tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. and Mic­higan at 11:00 a.m. Sunday. 
Head Coach Michele Gelfman is looking for the Irish to play a more aggressive style of tennis, though she notes that does not entail trying to out-gun their opponents. 
"We need to play an intelli­gent rather than power game," said Gelfman. "We need to use

a variety of shots, be a little more. patient and play percentage tennis." 
The Irish have not faced In­diana State under Gelfman's tutelage, and last year's 5-4 loss to Michigan was decided on a third-set tiebreaker. 
One thing that should help the Irish is the return of freshman Alice Lohrer, who missed several matches due to illness. Junior co-captain Michelle Dasso will especially be glad to see Lohrer back in the lineup, since the two comprise the number-one doubles team. 
''Alice and I play very well together, especially at the Min­



nesota Doubles Invitational 
eariler this year," said Dasso. 
"The play of our doubles team 
will be really important, so 
we've got to concentrate on 
what we've been working on." 
Dasso recognizes too that 
since moving from the number­
three spot last year to the top 
spot, she has had to incorporate 
a more aggresive style in 
singles action. 

"I've had to be more aggres­
sive because when you play 
number-one singles, you've got 
to come to the net,'' said Dasso. 
According to Assistant Coach Steve Simone, the team has -concentrated on the transition from the baseline. 
"Our players are learning that the ability to attack the net creates opportunities to win more points. We want to win points aggressively, rather than waiting for the other teams to lose those points, " said Simone. 
The difficulty, however, rests on the ability of a youthful squad to maintain consistancy with this new aggressive style. 
Notre Dame will play this weekend's matches at the Courtney Tennis courts behind the ACC. In the event of rain the matches will be played at the South Bend Racquet Club.

13-8 men's tennis team faces Purdue, Ind. St. 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
While rain showers late Wed­nesday morning kept the Notre Dame men's tennis team off the courts, forcing the Irish to postpone their match with Illinois-Chicago until Thursday, April 16, the team will see action this weekend against Indiana . State and Purdue. 
The Irish are coming off a successful spring break swing through California where they posted a 6-1 record. That per­formance lifted Notre Dame 
over  the  .500  mark  for  the  
season, with  a  13-8  overall  
mark.  

The Irish will put this record to the test Saturday at 1 p.m. CST at Indiana State, and then again at Purdue on Sunday at 9 a.m. CST. Notre Dame is a combined 38-9 against these two opponents, in-state rivals who the Irish first played back in the 1930's. 
Last season Notre Dame defeated Indiana State, 7-2, but 
dropped its match with Purdue 
by the same margin. Fallon ex­
pects to see another competi­
tive Boilermaker team Sun­
day. 

"Purdue has been tough for 
us the last few seasons,'' said 
Fallon. "And they have the 
same team back that defeated 
us last year.'' 
Purdue finished fourth in the 1986 Big Ten Championships, their best showing in 30 years. Boilermaker head coach Ed Dickson hopes to improve that performance this year with a squad of six solid returning let­termen. 
Fallon and the Irish look to counter this experience with momentum from their impres­sive showing over break. 
"We had a very good trip to California," Fallon said, "win­ning 6 of 7 matches and the only defeat was very close (a 5-4 loss to the University of California at Riverside). I hope we can maintain the peak that we are now playing at against Indiana State and Purdue.''

Radio stations direct raps at NCAA rules 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Some local radio stations are having fun playing songs that poke fun at the NCAA's rule barring men­tion of players' names in any public contest apart from news or sports. 
Among the latest is a ditty being played on WZPL-FM called the "NCAA Rap," writ­ten and recorded by the sta­tion's morning traffic reporter, Steve Stiles. 
It spoofs the NCAA rule by rapping the names of the bas­ketball players of the Univer­sity of Nevada-Las Vegas, the opponent of Indiana University Saturday at the Final Four in New Orleans. 
The lyrics are: 
Here's a little song for theN­C-double-A, 'Cause they're trying to tell us what we can and can't say Put a player in a song and then they can't play. What is this, Russia or the U-S of A? 
So here's the starting lineup of U-N-L-V 
We're gonna sing it to you now and then we'll just see. 
Gary. Graham's a good player, but his name's in this song 
Freddie Bank's, a hot guard, but, oops, not for long Gerald Padclio has a strange last name, Now he's in this song and can't play in the game. Finally, then, Armon Gilliam and the fast Mark Wade, If we hadn't sung 'em then they could have played. 
So, hey, N-C-Double-A, you think you've got guts, Take U-N-L-V out, and then we'll know you're nuts. Better do it to 'em now and stop all this fuss, 'Cause the Indiana Hoosiers are going to kick their butts. 
Also Thursday, radio station WENS-FM, which pulled its "Bobby Knight Bop" from the air earlier this week at the re­quest of the university, came up with a new tune, "In the Su­perdome," which features new lyrics to the tune "In the Ghet­to." 
Written and sung by morning show co-host Mark Patrick, the song's lyrics include: 
In the March skies, before a red Final Four chair can be flung, the 'Bobby Knight Bop' is already sung on the radio, 
N-C-A-A cries, 'cause if

Lady Longhorns look to repeat as champs 
Associated Press 
AUSTIN, Texas -Andrea Lloyd is regarded as women's basketball's answer to Boston Celtics star Larry Bird. 
She would rather pass than score. Tough defense is her trademark. And she wants the basketball in the "crunch minutes" of a close game. 
If the University of Texas Lady Longhorns are to repeat as NCAA women's national basketball champions, they'll have to get two big games from the only senior on their team, Lloyd. 
The 6-foot-2 All-American from Moscow, Idaho, provided the key points as Texas defeated Rutgers 85-77 in the final of the East Regional. 
Lloyd, who plays three differ­ent positions, averages 13 points, nine assists, three rebounds and three steals a game. In the NCAA Tourna­ment, she is shooting 65 percent from the field, 71 percent at the free throw line and has 15 steals in three games. 
"Andrea is the heart of our team," Texas coach Jody Con­radt says. "She's our leader. There is no better player in col­lege basketball. Her defense is just incredible. She's the most complete player I've seen.'' 
Lloyd has been giving her younger teammates some lec­tures this week. 
"I keep thinking how young this team is and I want to con­vey to the younger players not

to blow this chance we have," Lloyd said. "I don't have an­other chance. 

"I think it hurts us that we're young. Look at Louisiana Tech, where they have all senior starters. I just don't want our team to settle for less because they know they can come back next year.'' 
Louisiana Tech, the 1982 champion, has knocked Texas out of two regionals and again stands in the Lady Longhorns' championship path as the sixth annual tournament gets under­way on Friday with the semi­final games. 
The Lady Techsters, who are 29-2, take on the defending na­tional champion Lady Lon­ghorns, 31-1, at 6 p.m. before a sellout house of 16,000 fans in the Special Events Center. Texas has won 25 games in a row. 
Louisiana Tech beat Iowa 66­65 in the final of the Midwest Regional to advance to Austin.
