Alumni inducted into Hall of Fame 
Rosenthal among those to enter South Bend shrine 
By BRAD PRENDERGAST Assistant News Editor 
Richard Rosenthal, athletic director at the University, was one of three Notre Dame alum­ni inducted into the South Bend Hall of Fame on Sunday. 
A I s o 
inducted dur­ing the cer­emony held at the Century Center in downtown South Bend 


Dick
were Robert Grant, class Rosenthal of 1928, and LeRoy Troyer, class of 1971. 
"I was very pleased when I learned I would be inducted," Rosenthal said. "It's a tremen­dous thrill to be recognized in your own community." 
Rosenthal, a 1954 graduate with a bachelor's degree in fi­nance and a two-time basket­ball All-American, played pro­fessional basketball for two seasons with the Fort Wayne (Ind.) Pistons before beginning a career in banking. 
After serving as chairman of the board and chief executive officer of St. Joseph Bank and Trust Co. -now Society Bank ­Rosenthal became athletic di­rector at Notre Dame in 1987. 

According to Ron Bella, exec­utive director of the South Bend Alumni Association, which runs the hall, candidates for induc­tion must have made significant contributions to the South Bend community. 
"We select people based on what they have done for their fellow man," Bella said. 
Rosenthal, said Bella, cer­tainly qualifies. 
Actively involved in Project Future, an organization de­signed to attract businesses to the South Bend area, and in Special Olympics, Rosenthal also helped develop the Century Center and has worked exten­sively with the Chamber of Commerce. 
"Project Future pulls all the energy from the institutions in the economic community to bring in companies and create jobs," he said. 
"So far, we've been able to create thousands of jobs." 
According to Roland Kelly, vice-chairman of the South Bend Alumni Association, Rosenthal has been very in­strumental in the city. 
"He is a very good guy," Kelly said. "He is more than just a good athlete." 
Troyer, an architect, had a different reaction than Rosenthal when he learned he had been inducted. 
"I was surprised," he said. "My wife thought that I had been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame [located in South Bend and designed by Troyer] when she first heard." 
Besides designing the football hall of fame, the 1971 graduate in architecture has also been an international leader in Habitat for Humanity, working with former President Jimmy Carter in the Jimmy Carter Work Project as well. 
Troyer's interest in helping others build homes stems from an experience he had when he was younger. 
"As a student, I was invited to a United Nations international conference on housing in New York," he said. 
Troyer continues by adding, "at the final meetings, I became quite aware of the magnitude of the housing problem in the world. I learned that one quar­ter of the world is not ade­quately sheltered." 
Troyer noted that the dorm rooms of students on campus may appear small, but in poor­er countries, many homes are only 16'x16'. 
"Those home often shelter families of six or seven," he said. 
Grant, a federal magistrate for the past 37 years, earned his bachelor's and law degrees from Notre Dame in 1928 and 1930. 
The robing chamber of the Notre Dame Law School's moot courtroom was named in honor of Grant in 1992, and last year the federal building in South Bend was named for him 
The Notre Dame Alumni Association presented its John 
J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., Award to Grant this year. 



Peace possible in Northern Ireland

News Writer 
Although it may take a little more time, there is a serious chance of attaining peace in Northern Ireland for the first time in 25 years, according to Gerald Powers, a foreign policy advisor for the U.S. Catholic Conference.

University trustee Ernestine Raclin was also inducted. Artist James Borden and boxer Harold Brazier were honored as well. 
Begun in 1986, the hall now has 46 members, including Father Theodore Hesburgh, Ara Parseghian, and Ed "Moose" Krause. 
The South Bend Alumni Association solicits nominations for induction from the public, and then a committee of 15 people reviews the candidates and selects five to six people for induction annually. 
Nominees are chosen from five categories, including litera­ture and the arts, public ser­vice, education, athletics, and business. 
A sixth category, from which historical figures of South Bend will be nominated, will be initi­ated in 1995 or 1996. 
Kelly says, "this sixth catego­ry to honor people such as Knute Rockne, and others who have helped South Bend in the past." 
The hall was begun because there was no place locally to recognize those who con­tributed to the community, ac­cording to Bella. 
"These people who have been inducted put South Bend in the light as a community of doers," he said. 
Plaques for the members of the hall are located on the walls of the Century Center. 
The Century Center is located in downtown South Bend at 120 South Saint Joseph Street. 


Student arrested after game 
By LIZ FORAN 
Associate News Editor 
A Notre Dame student was arrested after an incident in­volving a St. Joe County police officer after the football game Saturday, according to Sgt. Charlie Fierrell, public rela­tions officer for the St. Joe County Police Department. 
A 21-year-old off campus se­nior was arrested at 5:30 p.m. in the north end zone of Notre Dame Stadium on charges of public intoxication and resist­ing law enforcement after what Fierrell described as "a celebration after the game." 
According to the report, the student was riding on the shoulders of a friend on the field of the stadium after the victory over Air Force, when the County officer told him to get down. 
The student allegedly said to the officer, "Why should I?" The officer then assisted the student in getting down. The student then allegedly shoved the officer, which resulted in his subsequent arrest. 
"If he had just listened, he would have walked away with­out a problem," Fierrell said. "In the state of Indiana, that (shoving a police officer) is called battery of a police offi­cer." 

Suspicious sound investigated in crash 
By MIKE ROBINSON 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO 

A strange "whooshing sound" aboard a USAir jetliner before the Sept. 8 crash that killed all 132 aboard apparent­ly was nothing more than an open public address system, industry sources said Monday. 
The report appeared to end speculation over the weekend that the mysterious sound could be a clue to the crash of Flight 427 near Pittsburgh, the fifth fatal crash of a USAir jet­liner in five years. 
Airline industry sources said the so-called whooshing noise had been traced to an open public address system. They said the pilot had made an announcement and did not turn off the sound system immedi­ately. 
They said the account of the noise was confirmed by an off­duty pilot who was riding free in the cockpit en route from Charlotte and got off the plane in Chicago. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity, say­ing it was protocol for the National Transportation Safety Board to disclose such informa­tion. 
Michael Benson of the NTSB said "We have one indication of that ... so far we have not been able to assess the significance of these reports." 
Andrew McKenna, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the University of Notre Dame, was a passenger who got off the plane in Chicago after traveling from Charlotte. He said he heard the sound and men­tionned it to a flight attendant. 
"She acknowledged it and that was it. Presumably, she reported it," said McKenna, a part owner of the National Football League's Chicago Bears and member of the Chicago Tribune's board. "I can tell you that it wasn't any­thing alarming." 
Also Monday, USAir named the fo1·mer top U.S. Air Force general in Europe to head all of its safety operations as it launched a major advertising drive designed to refurbish its safety image. 
Gen. Robert C. Oaks retired just this past year as com­mander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe.

Nope ... 
Not this 

Thanksgiving 
It's turkey time. And 
you know what that 
means. Time to reflect on 
friends and family and all 
that other good stuff that 
made us who we are 
today. We've all been 
doing this reflecting thing 
for twenty some odd 
years now right? You 
have to admit that's a 
mighty long time. And 
unless you want to help 
mom add water to the 

mashed potato mix or open that can of cran­
berry sauce, you're going to have a lot of time 
on your hands this Thanksgiving to reflect. 
I'm suggesting that this year, why not be 
wild and crazy. Skip the friends and family 
stuff. This ain't no long distance telephone 
commercial. This Thanksgiving, let it be all 
about you. Let's be materialistic. Let's have 
third helpings. Skip the vegetables complete­
ly. Pile your plate with Stove-Top before it 
gets down to Aunt Helen. You've moved up in 
the world now, no longer one of the little 
peons at the kiddie table. That's right, grab 
that drumstick before Aunt Wilma takes it 
over to no-mans land for cousin Billy. 
Wow, that trip from the kiddie table. It was 
a tough one wasn't it? It only took 16 or 17 
years. Remember, you spent the first three 
years or so crawling through the legs of the 
dining room table. And you never thought 
you'd make it That's something to be thankful 
for in itself. Sure, until you consider that in 
another six or seven years it'll be you trying to 
determine the correct poundage of turkey for 
twelve adults and five children. And it will be 
your kids that will be the little peons at the 
kiddie table. Your kids that will manage to 
drop the whole gravy bowl on the new shag 
rug. Your in-laws that'll be comparing your 
eooking with hubby's ex-girlfriend's. You who 
gets to wash more dishes than you ever use in 
a month. 

But enough future-talk. Let's talk about you. 
What made you what you are today? Lots of 
things, you say. Think about it, what would 
your life have been like without Jello? Bill 
Cosby? Atari? Monchichis? Sit-and-Spin? 
The Barbie Dream House? E.T.? The 
Millennium Falcon? Little House on the 
Prairie? Star Trek? Romper Room? Frozen 
Snickers? Judy Bloom? Jordache Jeans? 
Magic Shell? Legos? The Eurythmics? Taco 
Bell? The Violent Femmes? Alex P. Keaton? 
Jimmy Buffet? Frequent flyer miles? E-mail? 
Call waiting? Microsoft Windows? Little 
green men from Ireland? 

So what would your life be like? Pretty darn 
empty, I'd say. The trip from little peon to the 
grown-up table wouldn't have been half as 
interesting. Yes, bow to the gods at Mattei, 
Hershey, and Nickelodeon now. They made 
you what you are today. Forget your parents. 
All they did was feed and clothe you. Maybe, 
if you were good, they took you and eight 
friends to the bowling alley for your birthday. 
Face it, you are a product of the 1980's, 
Disneyworld, the Info Highway, and AT&T. 
Think about it and be grateful. 

But you know, maybe the kiddie table wasn't 
all that bad. Heck, it was a lot more fun than 
discussing mortgages and tax laws with the 
old folks, wasn't it? Why did you waste all 
those years trying to make it into the dining 
room anyhow? Flinging peas at each other in 
the kitchen was definitely a lot more fun than 
this. And on your way into the kitchen, make 
sure you drop the gravy bowl. For old times 
sake.

GATT providesClinton-Dole test 
WASHINGTON 
Congress is scheduled to vote after Thanksgiving on legislation to implement the 123-nation GATT agree­ment. The accord would reduce trade barriers and cut tariffs by an estimated $740 billion worldwide while offering more protection for American patents and copy­rights. The lame duck, Democratic-controlled House and Senate will be voting, but Democrats concede Republicans hold the balance of power, just as they will hold a majority in the new Congress that meets in January. In the Senate, in particular, where it will take 60 votes to prevail on a key procedural motion, the Republican grip on GATT is strong, and the politics intense. Dole and several other Republicans have expressed concerns that American sovereignty would be compromised by the World Trade Organization that would be established under GATT to police the accord. The White House says failure to vote on GATT by the end of the year would doom it to defeat because it would no longer be subject to a no-amendment rule in the Senate. 
Haagen-Dazs fat content misleading 
WASHINGTON 
A frozen-food maker crossed the line by implying that all its frozen yogurt -even the Praline Pandemonium and Vanilla Chocolate Crunch flavors-were low fat, the Federal Trade Commission said Monday. The FTC announced that Haagen-Dazs Co. Inc. had agreed to set­tle charges of false and misleading advertising. The company, while agreeing to the settlement, insisted the ads were not misleading. Under the proposed settle­ment, which will be open to public comment for 60 days, Haagen-Dazs would be barred from misrepresenting the fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or calorie content of any of its frozen yogurt or ice cream. At the time of the ad claiming many of its products were 98% fat-free, the FTC said, seven of the nine frozen yogurt flavors con­tained more than 2 percent fat, with as much as 12 grams of fat per serving. 
Ladder buckles and kills dad 
NEW YORK 

A fire ladder that twisted and collapsed during a res­
cue, throwing a man to his death and injuring four other 
people, is a workhorse piece of equipment used by large 
and small fire companies across the country. And it will 
go on being used despite the accident Sunday, several 
big city fire departments-including New York's-said 
Monday. Seagrave Aerial, based in Clintonville, Wis., 
has "been in business for 100 years" and its ladders are 
used in every major city, said Tom Kniaz, chief of appa­
ratus of the Detroit Fire Department. Yreno Espanoso, 
37, was killed when the 3-year-old lightweight, alu­
minum-alloy ladder buckled as he and his family climbed 
out a sixth floor window. Firefighter Greg Smith gripped 
Espanoso's children, 6-year-old Lissetto and 4-year-old 
Edwin, as the ladder groaned, twisted and crashed to the 
ground. Their mother, Aqueda Santana, 31, who was fol­
lowing Smith, also managed to hold on. The mother and 
children were in critical but stable condition at Bellevue 
Hospital, spokeswoman Vicki Ciampa said Monday. 
University bans sex in cyberspace 
PITTSBURGH 

In a case that has colleges taking another look at their 
legal responsibilities in cyberspace, Carnegie Mellon 
University has blocked access to bulletin boards that stu­
dents can use to call up dirty pictures. About 300 stu­
dents protested the move earlier this month as an 
assault on academic freedom, and a public interest 
group for computer users suggested Carnegie Mellon 
overreacted. "It is censorship," said Declan McCullagh, 
student body president. "We have obscene books in our 
library, but the university isn't burning them. The uni­
versity is burning cyberbooks." Carnegie Mellon officials 
said they fear the school can be prosecuted for distribut­
ing pornography to minors if it knowingly allows access 
to the pictures via the Internet to anyone under 18. Most 
of the school's students are adults, but children as young 
as elementary-school age also use the university's com­
puter networks.

Terrified passengers jumped from a flaming train after a ruptured diesel tank caught fire and drenched several cars with burning fuel. 
Dozens of passengers were injured Sunday night in what police suspect was a case of vandalism along the most heav­ily traveled train route in Canada.

Dear Editor. 
We are writing on behalf of Lyons Hall to thank ev­eryone from the Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and South Bend communities for the support, pledges, and en­thusiasm you shared with us last Saturday morning at the Fun Run. 
The run, which benefited the Mara Fox Memorial Scholarship Fund, was a huge success, but not merely in terms of the impressive donations we received. On a higher level, the run symbolized much more. It was a coming together of over 350 individuals....,-all of whom gave up sleeping late!-to celebrate the life of a fellow student and friend. 
Half of the runnen; and walkers probably never met Mara while she was alive, but this did not matter. We think that Mara was with all of us in love and hope. Thanks for keeping her spirit alive in each of you.

Resource Center assists gender relations 
Dear Editor: 

I am writing In response to Wendy Vestevich's letter of Nov. 4 ("Poor social mentalities spoil gender re­lations''). I was glad that Vestevich took the time to read and respond to The Observer article concerning the ND Speaks Out on Women forum. She seems to have been left with a rather negative impression of the event. but I believe that if she had attended the forum itself in addition to reading about it in The Observer, she might have had different things to say. 
The Women' s Resource Center sponsored ND Speaks Out on Women last year and this year in order to provide members of the campus community with a place to share their thoughts and feelings about women at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. Several indi­viduals were invited to speak, read poetry, and per­form music, and there was an open microphone for audience participation at the end of the formal pro­gram. The Women's Resource Center's role was to facilitate this event. not to announce its agenda for change or "thought control~ at Notre Dame. 
The Center seeks to promote the welfare of women nt Notre Dame. but its approach has always been based on an exchange of ideas, not a mandate, and the events it sponsors reflect this philosophy. 
Gender relations are often difficult at Notre Dame, as noted by Vestevich and many others who have written letters about the Alumni and Carroll Hall newsletters that were read aloud during the open mi­crophone portion of the forum. 
To try to address this concern, Student Government nnd the Women's Resource Center co-sponsored a panel discussion titled "Are ND/SMC women too sensi­tive? Are ND men too insensitive?" It was held Tuesday, Nov. 15.

Students get a taste of graduate school 
By MYRNA MALONEY 
Assistant Saint Mary's Editor 
If you're a junior at Saint Mary's College and have ever wondered what it would be like to pursue a master of business administration degree follow­ing graduation, the University of Chicago Business Fellows may be a program worth considering. 
Dottie White, Associate Director of Admissions at the University of Chicago Graduate School .of Business (GSB) will hold an informational meeting in Haggar Parlor at 7 p.m. on Tuesday, November 29 for Saint Mary's students interested in applying for the program, according to Lisa Baumann, a partici­pant during the summer of 1994. 
Baumann, a senior economics major and Tonya Ann Sunday, also a senior and completing a math major, rep­resented Saint Mary's during the sum­mer of 1994 at the University and found that the program exceeded all of their expectations. 
The program, which lasts from mid June through the end of August, allows current undergraduates to take up to three graduate level courses in business at the University and awards advance MBA credit which is applicable later, should they decide to return after re­ceiving their bachelors degrees. 
"We went through an orientation ses­sion prior to beginning the program. Later, in addition to our classes, we went as a group to visit various com­panies around Chicago such as McKinsey & Co. and Leo Burnett," Sunday said. 
The only requirements necessary for applicants, according to Baumann, are an interest in observing what GSB would 

GRA'P' SCJIOOL 

be like and consistent academic success at Saint Mary's. 
"Additional material on the program and GSB applications will be available at the meeting. Students must complete the applications and essays and turn them in to Patty Sayre, the coordinator of the selection process at Saint Mary's," Baumann said. 
"A panel composed of Saint Mary's professors and one alumna who also graduated from GSB will review them and choose five or six applicants to interview. This year, one representative from Saint Mary's will be chosen to par­ticipate," Sunday said. 
That student will win up to $6,000 in tuition from the Universit)', depending on the number of courses she takes. Students are encouraged to live in the International House on the main campus of the University, according to Baumann, because the GSB believes that time spent there fosters a sense of com­munity. 
"I thought living at the International House was a great experience because I was able to meet graduate students from other programs in addition to all the international students who lived there for the summer. We were respon­sible for all of our housing and living ex­penses," Baumann said. 
"The University discourages partici­pants from holding jobs during the pro­gram and this is probably the only drawback. Even though I had to forego summer earnings, the benefits I received outweighed having a job." 
"I met so many people from other lib­eral arts colleges across the country and the program included several social activities around Chicago such as a cruise on Lake Michigan and a White Sox game," she continued. 
Both students agree that completing the program added to their confidence and look back on it as an opportunity for growth. 
"It's such a good feeling to know that I was able to complete courses at the graduate level and that I was successful in doing so. In addition, the University of Chicago is such a wonderful business school and this is an opportunity to participate in a very reputable program. I encourage any interested juniors to look into it, especially if they have only taken liberal arts classes while they've been at Saint Mary's," Baumann said. 
"If you have the fundamentals of a liberal arts education that the University of Chicago believes you have received, you can succeed in this program," Sunday said.

• INTERHALL fOOTBAll 
Seniors suit up one last time in all-star game 
By JOE VILLINSKI Spons Writer 
For the seniors, tonight's in­terhall all-star game will mark the final chapter in their foot­ball careers. 
Sure, there will always be the pick-up games in the park, but it will be the last time to strap on the pads and reflect on the time as a child when they first performed that action. ''I'll still continue to play football, but it's different when you suit up with pads on," Carroll senior Tony Laboe said. 
In previous years, there had been no interhall all-star game, leaving some of the players with an empty feeling as the season ended. 
"In my sophomore year, there was an all-star team, but we didn't actually play," Morrissey senior Dave Powell said. "I thought this was a great idea when I heard about it." 
"I think it'll be a good oppor­tunity for everyone," Carroll senior Scott Ismail commented. ''I'm realizing it'll be my last game and it will be kind of an emotional thing." 
The game will begin at 9:00 in Loftus tonight following the women's all-star game at 7:30. With teams of 28 members rep­resenting both the Gold and Blue divisions, some players will be placed in some new positions making for an inter­esting game. 
In addition, WNDU sportscast­er Chuck Freeby will be attempting to score a touch­down between the first and sec­ond quarters as part of his seg­coaches. 
"If you took an all-star team from these two teams, they would be able to compete at a Division II or III level," Blue as­sistant coach Frank Castellino said. 
The game will not only feature seniors, though, as many un­derclassmen were picked by their peers to represent their dorms. 
"The upperclassmen are great to be around," Fisher freshman Sean Lynch added. "They're able to show you a lot of new things." 
One of those seniors, Fisher's Dan McGinty, may have summed it up the best. 
"I think it is a nice honor to give out," he added. 
"This is going to be my last game and it is a nice touch on which to end the season."

a first down at the. Bat 43, but then he fumbled under pres­sure, and Off-Campus' Joe Bergan fell on the football. 
Six plays later, Hammond dove in from the one, and the Crime had sealed a 14-0 vic­tory. 
The duel of the quarterback­ing Hammond brothers was clearly won by Off-Campus' Chris. He outshone Benji by completing 5 of 10 passes for 81 yards. Chris has played in the Stadium all three years of his lnterhall career, and won two titles. However, the victory left him feeling sorry for his fre~hman brother. . 
"They were hitting him pretty hard at the end. A freshman getting to the Stadium is pretty impressive. I thought he played well considering Zahm couldn't run the ball well." 
Bozanich felt Benji showed guts."Any freshman can hang his head, give up, and quit. He stuck in there. He never gave up. If Zahm has him for three more years, look out." 
Feeling more torn were the brothers' parents. They spent the first half in the Off-Campus stands, and the second half in the Zahm stands. 
The boys' mother, Susie, never really had a chance for a breather, since she had a son playing on both offenses. "Usually, I get pretty involved at games, but this time, I'll get no breaks." 
For the Crime, the game cul­minated a great season, and

George Reider-The senior linebacker provided leader· ship all year as the corner· stone of the dominating Off­Campus defense. In keeping the Zahm offense in check with an interception and some bone-crushing hits on Sunday, he gave the Crime offense time to get on track in the championship game.

The 0-C turnover gave the Lyons offense second life and a first down at the 30-yard line. It took just four plays for the team to score, as Lyons quar­terback Julie Byrd found re­ceiver Kathy Shantz wide open for an easy score as time ex­pired in the first half. Byrd added the conversion on a keeper to give Lyons a 7-0 lead heading into intermission. 
Just like the first, the second half started out as a defensive struggle. Neither squad was able to build a drive until the fi­nal minutes of the game. 
Unfortunately for Off-Campus, it was Lyons who answered the call when the game was on the line. Starting from deep in their own territory, Byrd and the Lyons offense engineered a nine-play, 60-yard drive. In what someday may come to be known as The Drive, Byrd con­nected with receiver Jenny Layden three times and Shantz once as a result of making ad­justments against the 0-C blitz. 
"We focused all week on pick­ing up the blitz, and we were able to do a pretty good job of that," said Byrd. "The offense executed pretty well, especially in the second half." 
As the Off-Campus defense stiffened up near the goal line, Lyons faced a fourth and goal situation with less than four minutes to play. Just as she had all afternoon, Byrd came up big for Lyons with a four yard touchdown scamper to ex­tend the lead to 13-0. 
Off-Campus narrowed the gap to 13-7 following a nine yard touchdown pass from Neidlinger to tailback Megan Allen. However, it proved to be too little too late, as Lyons was able to run the clock out and hang on to the 13-7 victory. 
Indeed the cream did rise to the top. And for Lyons, victory couldn't taste any sweeter.

0-C, Lyons deliver one-two punch 
Crime capture men's title with 14-0 rout of Zahm 
BY NEIL ZENDER Sports W rirer 

Whoever said 'Crime Doesn't Pay' never played OtT­Campus on the football field. The Crime rolled over a feisty Zahm club on their way to a 14-0 victory for the lnterhall Championship. 
OfT-Campus won all season because of an unyielding defense. Sunday was no exception. 
The Crime held the Rabid Bats to 23 total yards. Zahm ran the ball 15 times for a grand total of 7 yards. Quarterback Benji Hammond was 4 of 12 for 38 yards, and was sacked three times for a loss of 22 yards. 
The Off-Campus defense forced three Zahm turnovers, and the Bats were penalized five times for 60 yards. 
"They capitalized on our mistakes. We weren't able to do the same," Zahm captain Dave Bozanich said. 
The game was a 0-0 defensive stalemate in the fourth quarter, before the gutsy leadership of quarter­back Chris Hammond led the Crime to the win. Wide receiver Tom Fitzpatrick got past the Rabid Bat defense, and Hammond hit him with a 29-yard touch­down strike. Michael Marty's extra point made it a 7­0 lead. 
Zahm attempted to mount a drive on their next pos­session. Benji Hammond fired to Randy Swatland for

Lyons cruises past 0-C for women's title 
By MICHAEL DAY Sporrs Writer 


The cream always seems to rise to the top when the mo­ment of truth arrives. 
It certainly did on Sunday, as Lyons captured the lnterhall championship with an impressive 13-7 victory over a relentless Off-Campus squad at The Stadium. 
Lyons, coached by Kevin Kuwik, Andy Brant, Jim Mullen, and Kevin Klau, executed their game plan brilliantly on both sides of the ball. Offense. Defense. Coaching. You name it-Lyons was superior in each and every aspect of the game. 
"It was a great team effort,'' said Klau. "The game typi­fied the kind of effort we've had throughout the year." 
With the game scoreless after nearly 16 minutes into the contest, Lyons linebacker Cindy Eagan came up with the play of the game. Make that the play of the season. OtT­Campus appeared to be driving to take the lead when Eagan stepped in front of 0-C wideout Michelle Drury and intercepted a Nicole Neidlinger pass to turn the tide of the battle.
