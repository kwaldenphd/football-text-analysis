Administration details three-part worker plan 
By KATHLEEN McDONNELL News Writer 
The Campus Labor Action Project (CLAP) is en route to accomplishing some of its goals after meeting twice with administration members last week, member Nick Krafft said. 
"We're not going to stop until we feel like the wage scale is just," Krafft said. "There are definitely steps being made in the right direc­tion." 
An organization of about 20 students, CLAP was estab­lished last fall to secure a $12.10 per hour wage for campus workers. This year, the group hopes to address wages that are too low, an increased workload in the past few years and understaffing. 

On Sept. 12 representatives of both CLAP and student gov­ernment met with administra­tion members including Executive Assistant to the President Frances Shavers, Associate Vice President of Human Resourees Bob MeQuade and Executive Vice President John Affleck-Graves to diseuss the University's new developments in worker rela­

Millions on the line for student 
Senior to appear on game show today 
By RYAN SYDLIK News Writer 
When Laura Keough told her son Dan to earn some eash to supplement his unpaid summer internship, she didn't mean a mil­lion dollars. 
But that's just what the senior stands to win in his appearance on "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" today at 12:30 p.m. The show, to be aired on WNDU­TV, was taped on July 25, but Keough was prohibited from dis­closing the results. 
Keough nabbed his spot on "Millionaire" by applying online while in New York. At the time, he was interning with New Une Cinema to work on the latest Harry Potter movie. 
Once initially accepted, Keough had to take a trivia test and undergo interviews to actually earn a spot on the show. 
He was one of the 15 out of 100 people who passed both hurdles -a week after, he received a eall and was told his show would be July 24. 
While the "fastest-fmger" ques­tion has been eliminated, getting to the "hot seat" is still nerve­racking, Keough said -contest­ants are given no warning before their names are called. 
"They had us all back stage. They eall you up randomly, one at a time," he said. 
Keough waited an entire day without being called, and was forced to return to the studio the next day. Then. he finally heard the direetor say the magic words. 
"Dan Keough, you're up."

A King for all seasons 
"Winter, spring, summer, or fall/all you have to do is call/and I'll be there, yes I will! you've got a friend." 
God, I used to think that song was so corny. That is, until I discovered the wonder of 
Chris Hine 
Carole King's songwriting. She is much more than that lady Sports Writer who sings the 
theme to 
"Gilmore Girls." 
I grew up on the music of the 60s and 70s. It was the only music I heard, because it was all that my dad played. Somewhere around the age of 12, thankfully, my parents finally let me out of my caged existence and let me try something modern. So, for a few years, I listened to "cool" music. 
Then when I was 16, I was in Barnes and Noble and they had a dis­play out of "classic albums." One of those albums was King's "Tapestry." I looked at the back cover of the CD and there were many songs on there I recognized that other people had made famous: "You've Got a Friend," "So Far Away" and "Natural Woman." I figured, why not buy it? These are songs I know, thanks to dad. 
My ears have yet to hear anything resembling the idiosyncratic beauty and deceptive simplicity of Carole King's songs. 
I do not know that much about music, but I do know that King's songs are more than just hooks thrown to together to make a hit. Her songs, (along with lyricist, Gerry Goffin, with whom she wrote most of her big hits) have emotional punch behind them, and the melody and chords complement the lyrics, to underscore the feelings of the singer. Other times, the melody is more iron­ic, revealing emotions the singer does not want to acknowledge. 
In "You've Got a Friend," the verses contain minor chords, to convey sad­ness and depression, and the lyrics of the verses are sad and longing for someone. The chords then become major chords around the chorus, to show happiness to go along with the lyrics that convey the singer's relief that she will always have a friend. 
Goffin!King songs are songs that have no writers. They exist within our consciousness, buried within our memories because we either heard them on TV, in a movie, or on our parent's stereo. Whenever we hear one of their songs, we may not know the singer, but we have heard that song before. They are engrained in our minds and will stay there forever. 
After hearing "Tapestry." I bought many other Carole King albums. The same craftsmanship is present in all of her songs. 
The greatness of Goffin!King was not lost on Lennon!McCartney, who said they wanted to become "the Goffin and King of England." I encourage all of you to buy "Tapestry" or go and download one of the over 500 songs King wrote that were recorded by others. 
If she's good enough for the Beatles, she's good enough for you.

was in tears, hugging and celebrating," she said. "It was a celebration of an accomplishment for every­one, but particularly emo­tional and special for myself and my family." 
The three-day race took Barstis and the 11 other Ultraman competitors throughout the "extremely beautiful and peaceful" Canadian Rockies of British Columbia, she said. 
Throughout Barstis' 30 hours, 56 minutes, 21 sec­onds of extreme athletic exertion during the Aug. 12 to Aug. 14 race, she said she felt completely "in commun­ion with God and her family." 
Barstis found the inspira­tion to train and complete the physically grueling event from the women she met while undergoing chemother­apy treatment. 
Because of the extreme minority of women's partici­pation in the Ultraman, Barstis originally "applied to the Ultraman to represent the accomplishments of women." 
"I thought 'I've got to do it'," she said, "purely to show that as women we are tough and we can do these things." 
Never missing a single day of work during her treat­ment, the dedicated chair of the Department of Chemistry and Physics said her attitude and drive also came from her work atmosphere and the support of Saint Mary's women who helped her real­ize she could complete the race despite setbacks. 
Junior biology and chem­istry major Allie Greene has had Barstis as a professor for only one month, but has already witnessed the many "amazing characteristics that she possesses." 
"She motivates her students with her cheerful attitude, and amazing drive in life," Greene said. "She is an inspi­ration to me, because even though she was faced with one of the scariest moments of her life, she was still able to keep her head up and do something to overcome it." 
Senior biochemistry major Katie White also said she could not help but notice how Barstis "lives her life with a vengeance" and "cannot fully express [her] admiration and respect" for the resilient pro­fessor. 
"Her encouragement and support have been invaluable in my own development as a chemist and as a woman," she said. "Saint Mary's College is lucky to have such an enthusiastic, warm, and intelligent woman." 

The admired and revered College professor did not solely receive inspiration from Saint Mary's, but from her personal interaction with fellow cancer patients. 
The women she met during her chemotherapy treatment fueled her passion to train for the Ultraman -complet­ing the race in honor of women who have dealt with gynecological cancer. 
"I was very lucky that my cancer was discovered very early," she said. "I met women who had to receive chemo treatments five days a week just to stay alive." 
Despite being told to mini­mize or terminate training, Barstis used her workout time as a mental release from the tensions of dealing with 
her illness. 

"Every time I would go to receive chemo treatment, the other women would ask me how it was going," she said. "It reminded me of my higher purpose -I was doing this for them. It gave both myself and the other women strength and encourage­ment." 
The key to her success was the willpower to "show up on the starting line everyday," she said. "I did not know if I would finish, but the key is being there and starting the race. I finished every time ­it was a miracle." 
Through competing in the Ultraman, Barstis met many extraordinary athletes whom she described not as competi­tors, but as "family." 
The Ultraman athletes showed their kindness and compassion through their sincere support of Barstis and her family -comprised of her husband, Dave, and childt:en, 9-year-old Elijah and 6-year-old Aviyah. 
"All the competitors accom­plished an amazing feat," she said. "For me it was just under special circum­stances." 
Although Barstis will be monitored for 10 more years, she looks at life in depth now more than ever -never tak­ing anything for granted. 
"I look at how trivial many things in life are," she said. "Everyone is always worrying over stupid things, when the most important thing is fami­ly and family events." 
Barstis will "forever treas­ure the fact that [she] fin­ished the race," but more importantly, she will remem­ber the time spent and the support she received from her family during the race. 
"Being able to run down a mountain hand-in-hand with my little daughter is such a great memory -something I will never forget," she said. 
As for the future, Barstis hopes to run the Ultraman Hawaii or double triathlon in 2007 or 2008, but wherever her life takes her Barstis said she will "live fully." 
"You never know how long we'll be here," she said. "We must celebrate life and live every minute fully."

Woman knifed, baby kidnapped 
Associated Press 

ST. CLAIR, Mo. -A moth­er whose throat was slashed and newborn baby kid­napped was released from the hospital Sunday as authorities said they found a knife on property near her home. 
A woman came to 21-year­old Stephanie Ochsenbine's home in the town of Lonedell on Friday, attacked her with a knife and left with her week-old infant, Abigale Lynn Woods, offi­cials said. 
Franklin County Sheriff Gary Toelke said authorities found a knife and other evi­dence near Ochsenbine's home, but would not give more details. 
Heavy rain Sunday forced postponement of a search for more evidence. 
Ochsenbine is not a sus­pect, Toelke said. The attacker was described as a white woman with black hair, 5-feet-8 and 200 pounds. She was believed to be armed. 
Ochsenbine helped police artists with a composite drawing of the kidnapper 
after leaving the hospital. The picture could be released Sunday, Toelke said. 
Fliers showing the baby, called "Abby" by her family, were posted in gas stations and restaurants in neighbor­ing Union. The 6-pound girl, born Sept. 8, has dark brown hair, dark eyes and a strawberry birthmark on her forehead. 
People in the area, about 45 miles southwest of St. Louis, attended prayer serv­ices Sunday for Abby's safe return. 
Search dogs, Franklin County deputies, FBI agents and several Missouri National Guard members combed the area around the home for clues over the weekend. 
Callers continued to offer tips, Toelke said, but none led to a suspect. 
"Any lead is good, but so far there's nothing that has stood out," he said. "There's a lot of information we have, but nothing concrete." 
Ochsenbine told police she did not know the woman who came t? her door Friday and entered the house after asking to use the telephone. 
Ochsenbine 's 1-year-old son, Connor, also was in the house but was unharmed. Ochsenbine's boyfriend and Abby's father, James Woods, was at work. 
Authorities have asked hospitals and doctors to be on the lookout for anyone bringing in a newborn. 
The abductor has been profiled as someone who had a child die recently or as someone who could not have children, told people she was pregnant and need­ed to steal a child so her lie would not be found out. 
From 1983 to 2002, there were 217 reported cases of non-family infant abduc­tions, and all but a few babies were recovered safely within 25 miles of where they had been taken, according to a 2003 study by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. About three-quar­ters of the kidnapped infants were recovered in fewer than five days. 
"We're hopeful that's the case," Toelke said.

Rebel leader crosses into Sudan 
NABANGA, Sudan -Ugandan rebel leader Joseph Kony has turned up at a neutral camp in southern Sudan as part of a truce to end 19 years of conflict in the east African nation, a rebel official said Sunday. 
Kony, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity, arrived at Ri-Kwangba camp, just 550 yards north of the border with Congo, said Martin Ojul, the head of the rebel team negotiating a peace deal with the Ugandan government. 
Kony joins his deputy, Vincent Otti, whose arrival at the camp was announced on Sept. 11. 
U.N. officials estimate the rebels have kid­napped 20,000 children in the past two decades, turning the boys into soldiers and the girls into sex slaves for rebel commanders. Otti has told U.N. officials the group would be willing to hand over the women and children.

Social Democrats ousted in Sweden 
STOCKHOLM, Sweden -A center-right opposition vowing to revamp Sweden's famed welfare state ousted the Social Democratic government in a close parliamentary election Sunday. 
Social Democratic Prime Minister Goran Persson, who had governed for 10 years, con­ceded defeat and said his government would resign after the party's worst election showing in decades. 
With 99 percent of districts counted, the four-party opposition alliance led by Fredrik Reinfeldt had 48 percent of the votes, com­pared to 46.2 percent for the Social Democrats and their two allied parties. 
"It was team work that helped us win," Reinfeldt said in a victory speech.

Duquesne basketball players shot 
PITTSBURGH -Police searched for a man who shot five Duquesne basketball players on campus early Sunday after a dance at the student union, leaving at least two of them in critical condition. 
Two players were walking near a dormitory and encountered a man who apparently had been disruptive at the dance, authorities said. The players tried to calm the man and walked away but were shot. Players who rushed to their aid were also shot. 
The gunman and a group of people with him were not students, a university official said. 
Witnesses reported seeing two guns, said uni­versity president Charles Dougherty, but he couldn't confirm whether both were fired. The second gun was seen on someone in a group with the gunman, Dougherty said.

LaPORTE, Ind. -Gov. Mitch Daniels came to this Northern Indiana city last week to hand out a framed check symbolizing 40 mil­lion reasons he thinks voters there should support the leasing of the Indiana Toll Road. 
Waiting for him outside. City Hall, however, were about three dozen protesters. 
For a few minutes, Daniels verbally sparred with his critics, challenging their assertion that the Toll Road had made money and could have continued to do so in state hands. 
"I don't want to embarrass you," he told one man, "but you're wrong." 

Pope issues apology for remarks 
Mixed reaction from Islamic leaders as Vatican prepares for violent backlash 
Associated Pres.s 

VATICAN CITY -Pope Benedict XVI said Sunday that he is "deeply sorry" his remarks on Islam and vio­lence offended Muslims, but the unusual expression of papal regret drew a mixed reaction from Islamic lead­ers as the Vatican worried about a backlash of vio­lence. 
Some Muslim leaders accepted the statement. Others said it wasn't enough, but urged Muslims to avoid violence after attacks on churches in Palestinian areas and the slaying of a nun in Somalia. 
Benedict said he regretted causing offense with his speech last week in Germany, particularly his quoting of a medieval text that characterized some of the teachings of Islam's founder as "evil and inhu­man" and referred to spreading Islam "by the sword." 
He said those words did not reflect his own opinions. 
"I hope that this serves to appease hearts and to clari­fy the true meaning of my address, which in its totality was and is an invitation to frank and sincere dialogue, with great mutual respect," the pope said during his weekly Sunday appearance before pilgrims. words.

tions, Krafft said. 

The administration has a three-fold plan laid out to improve its relationship with workers. First, the University will send an extensive ques­tionnaire to all workers in order to evaluate its role as employer. CLAP will have an opportunity to alter or add to 
the survey before it is sent and also to see the results. 
Second, the administration plans to have a hotline run by a third party, a neu­tral company for workers, to allow employees to voice concerns. 
"A lot of workers are afraid to go to human resources with concerns," 

"We're glad with the out­come of the meeting because we feel like if we didn't start this dialogue, the changes may not have happened," Krafft said. "But at the same time, we're -still trying to work with them on the issue of wages ­I think that is going to take some more time." 
CLAP member Casey Stanton praised the administration's efforts. 
"They seem to have taken the issues to heart," she said. 
"In all of this, we are recognizing that we have the same interest ­making {Notre Dame] the best for its workers. " 
Casey Stanton CLAP member 
Krafft said. "So this neutral company will give them the opportunity to be heard." 
The third and final initiative will allow workers to feel more a part of campus life by starting town hall meetings in which new University develop­ments will be discussed. Jenkins will host the first meeting at the end of September, and he will offer four different meeting times so that workers from all shifts will be· able to attend, Krafft said. 
CLAP members seem happy with the progress made but stress that the project is ongo­ing. 
"There's a respectful collab­oration going on here." 
Krafft also said the administra­tion stressed that CLAP and the University do have the same goals. 
~'Right now we're just coming at the issue from two different per­spectives, and it's 

just going to take some time so that we can see things from the same vantage point," he said. 
The University feels it's a very fair employer compared to other institutions in the area, Krafft said, but CLAP still feels there is work to be done in terms of the pay scale. He described the meeting as "very collaborative -not at all antagonistic" which should lead to an even stronger part­nership in the future. 
On Sept. 14, CLAP members met with the Staff Advisory Council in order for the groups to discuss their goals and better understand each 
other. "They [the Staff Advisory Council] sort of represent the 
. whole range of workers on campus, all 3,000, and they had some really great ques­tions for us," Stanton said. "They were interested in exactly what we wanted to do and wanted to know how we thought we could do it," Krafft said. "It was really good knowing that this body of rep­resentatives was really throw­ing its support behind us." Krafft also said thn meeting was a good opportunity to gnt worker contaets, as the organ­ization is in tlw process of .assembling a eoalition of workers to movn the projnet forward. As for the futurn, Stanton stressed that any student interested in talking about labor issues should contact a CLAP leader to join the proj­ect. She also said CLAP's next step is to further involve workers in the process. "The most important thing is relationship-building in terms of really getting to know work­ers in a collective effort," Stanton said. "We're trying to figure out how the economics of it works while at the same time getting to know the work­ers and hearing their stories." Stanton praised last week's meetings with the University as steps toward real progress in the collaborative effort. "In all of this, we are recog­nizing that we have the same interest -making [Notre Dame] the best for its work­ers," she said.

Sex~offender captured

Kidnapped girl found in underground bunker 
Associated Press LUGOFF, S.C. -A man suspect­ed of kidnapping a 14-year-old girl and keeping her in an under­ground bunker was charged Sunday with raping the teen, Kershaw County Sheriff Steve McCaskill said. McCaskill said Vinson Filyaw had eluded police with an elaborate system of hideouts and bunkers since November 2005 when he was chargnd with criminal sexual conduct on a 12-ynar-old girl. lie surmndemd Sunday morning to police as he walked along Interstate 20 near Columbia, about five miles from where investigators found the teenager. Police say Filyaw, 36, abducted the girl as she walked home from a sehool bus stop on Sept. 6. Investigators arrested Filyaw in neighboring Hichland County about 24 hours after rescuing the girl, who sent a text message to her mother on Filyaw'-s phone while he was asleep Wednesday, McCaskill said. The sheriff·said Filyaw woke up and the girl still had the phone, but she told him she was simply playing with the phone. Investigators used cell towers to determine a general location of the phone and deputies began search­ing for Filyaw on Friday night. Mc:Ca'lkill said the girl cried out as searchers approached the bunker. "This little lady gntting that mes­

IN BRIEF 
Delphi bankruptcy hearings delayed 
NEW YORK -The bankruptcy court hear­ings to determine whether Delphi Corp. can reject its labor agreements and certain supply contracts with General Motors Corp. have been postponed, the company said on Friday. 
Delphi, which was part of GM until it was spun off in 1999, said the court had granted further adjournments in both cases. It has scheduled a Sept. 28 status conference with the judge presiding over its bankruptcy case. 
Friday was also the deadline for a second wave of UAW-represented Delphi employees to accept buyout offers. About 12,600 hourly employees have already taken early retire­ment offers. 
A call to the UAW was not immediately returned. 
Delphi has about 6,000 employees in Indiana -5,200 workers in Kokomo, with about 2,300 of those being union workers, plus operations in Anderson. 
The decision to postpone the bankruptcy court hearings came after GM, Delphi, and its unions met on Thursday with Judge Robert Drain of the Southern District of New York. 

Medicare changes to strain doctors 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -Medicare benefici­aries might soon face a shrinking pool of doc­tors willing to see them because the program's payments to physicians will undergo the first of a series of cuts on Jan. 1. 
The cuts of 5 percent in 2007 and 37 per­cent over the next nine years likely will force some physicians to limit the number of Medicare patients they see. 
A recent survey conducted by the American Medical Association found that 45 percent of the doctors who responded said they would either decrease or stop seeing new Medicare patients if the 5 percent cut goes through. 
"It would be devastating to my practice," said Dr. James LaFollette, who has had a Bloomington family practice for four decades. "Thirty to 40 percent of my patients are on Medicare, and 65 percent are over 50." 
If the cuts are made according to what is called the Medicare sustainable growth rate formula, LaFollette predicts many doctors will stop accepting new Medicare patients -and others will simply leave the profession. 



Outbreak affects buying habits 
Shoppers turn to other produce after recall of E. Coli-contaminated spinach 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES Shoppers changed their buying habits Saturday as spinach was pulled from grocery store shelves because of the outbreak of 
E. coli bacteria that had killed one person and sick­ened more than 100 others. 
Natural Selection Foods LLC recalled its packaged spinach throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico as a precaution after federal health ollicials said some of those hospital­ized reported eating brands of prepackaged spinach distributed by the company. 
The oflicials stressed that the bacteria had not been isolated in products sold by the holding company, based in San Juan Bautista, Calif., and known for Earthbound Farm and other brands. As the investigation continues, other brands may be impli­cated, officials said. 
At a Safeway grocery in San Francisco's Potrero Hill neighborhood, many bagged produce shelves were empty Saturday. Anna Cairns said she had to settle for bags of iceberg green lettuce and Caesar salad, instead of her nor­mal salad mix, which con­tained spinach.

''I've found out that children that don't have AIDS are lucky children," population resides there. 

A large part of Opwonya's talk consisted of the personal stories of several of her AIDS patients. Opwonya told of young children -some no older than 10 -looking after their dying HIV-positive par­ents. She related specific accounts of the way in which AIDS psychologically damaged certain children.

The title and theme of Opwonya's talk was "Who will speak for us?" Though scores of African children suffer from AIDS, it is the adults who get the most attention, she said -similar to the situ­ation when free antiretroviral drugs became available in Uganda three years ago.

Still another of Opwonya's stories described an HIV-positive child that died simply because the parents could not afford antibiotics when the child fell sick with pneumonia. 
The heart-wrenching stories that Opwonya told illustrated the injustices that so many African children experience because of AIDS and because they -the children -are often overlooked.

The season, however, is far from over. Students have been able to retain some hope in the face of defeat. Ochoa said she is still "very excited for the season." 
And Saturday's loss marks just one chapter in a large 2006 football novel -the Irish will write the next one at Michigan State next week. For Bartkus, the season rests on the Nov. 25 University of Southern California game. 

"Although there is business to take care of beforehand, the game at USC has become a statement game," he said.

Ahmadinejad praises Chavez for rebelling against U.S. 
Associated Press 
CARACAS -Iran's president praised Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez for his firm oppo­sition to the United States on Sunday, promising to deepen an alliance that is helping Tehran fight U.S. moves to rein in its nuclear program. 

President Makmoud Ahmadinejad called Chavez "my brother" and "the champion of the struggle against imperial­ism." 
The two leaders met as both were preparing to travel to New York for this week's U.N. General Assembly. 
"We have thoughts, objectives and interests in common," Ahmadinejad said. "We must be united to be able to make these ideas reality with the aim of achieving justice and peace." 
Venezuelan and Iranian offi­cials signed a series of accords, including agreements for Tehran to help Venezuela devel­op oil fields. The governments plan to build factories to pro­duce everything from bricks to

bicycles, and have agreed to set up a $2 billion investment fund. 
Chavez and Ahmadinejad spoke through a live television link with Iranian businessmen who are helping build a $250 million cement plant in the eastern state of Monagas. They also watched as a Venezuelan Muslim knelt and prayed in a new mosque opened at a joint petrochemical plant. 
Chavez honored the Iranian leader with a medal and demanded that the U.S. destroy its own nuclear arsenal instead of harassing Iran about a nuclear program that he said is purely for producing electricity. 
"Iran is not making an atomic bomb," Chavez said. "The ones that have many atomic bombs, and I repeat, many, are precise­ly the U.S. imperialists and their allies in the world." 
Iran insists its nuclear research is aimed solely at peaceful uses despite concerns among U.S. and European gov­ernments that it could be trying to develop nuclear weapons. 
"I salute all the revolutionar­ies who oppose world hegemo­ny," Ahmadinejad said through an interpreter, apparently referring to the United States. 
Ahmadinejad and other Middle Eastern leaders are backing Venezuela's bid for a 
U.N. Security Council seat, which would give Chavez a plat­form to battle a U.S. drive for sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program.

Mission pronounced a success 
NATO drives Taliban insurgents back-but victims are plenty 
Associated Press 
KABUL -NATO said Sunday that its two-week offensive in south Afghanistan was a "sig­nificant success" that had driv­en Taliban insurgents from their positions and opened the way for development. But vio­lence was unabated, with sui­cide bombers killing two civil­ians and wounding six soldiers. 
Militants also took control of a district in the west of the coun­try after chasing away the police, an official said, in an apparent attempt to open a new front. 
The developments came as the country is going through its bloodiest phase since the U.S.­led invasion ousted the hard­line Taliban from power in 2001. 
Lt. Gen. David Richards, head of the 20,000-strong NATO-led force in Afghanistan, said the insurgents have been forced out of the volatile former Taliban heartland, and reconstruction and development efforts there would soon begin. 
Alliance officials have said more than 500 militants were killed during the two-week operation, centered mainly in Panjwai, Pashmul and Zhari districts of southern Kandahar province. 
Two foreign military convoys in different areas came under attack from suicide bombers, a method frequently used by insurgents in Iraq. 
A 17-year-old carrying explo­sives jumped in front of a U.S. military convoy east of Kabul, killing a bystander and wound­ing three American soldiers, Afghan police said. 
Earlier in the day, a suicide bomber plowed his explosive­laden vehicle into a Canadian military convoy in southern Afghanistan, killing one civilian and wounding three soldiers. 
The bomber targeted the con­voy west of Kandahar city, said Zulmai Khan, a police official at the scene. Eight civilians were also hurt in the blast, police said. 
Most of Afghanistan's recent surge in violence has taken place in volatile southern provinces, where some 8,000 NATO forces took military con­trol from the U.S.-led coalition on Aug. 1. NATO commanders say they need another 2,500 troops plus greater air support to crush the Taliban threat more quickly. 
Richards said the end of the southern offensive should open the way for much needed reconstruction and develop­ment in areas where the central government has been unable to reach. 
But some 400 heavily armed Taliban crossed into the west­ern Farah province, taking con­trol of its Gulistan district after chasing away the police and burning the district headquar­ters and a local clinic, provin­cial police chief Gen. Sayed Aqa Saqib said. No casualties were reported. 
"We are hoping the govern­ment will send more troops, because there are too many Taliban in the area," Saqib told The Associated Press over the phone. 
Gen. Sher Mohammad Karimi, the Afghan army's chief of operations, acknowledged that the Taliban "were not all destroyed" and that some have called Big Northern Wind has simply slipped away into other been under way in Kunar areas.

Parents of enslaved catnel jockeys file suit 
Associated Press 

MIAMI -Hulers of the United Arab Emirates were accused in a lawsuit of enslaving tens of thousands of boys over three decades and forcing them to work as jockeys in the popular sport of camel racing. 
The lawsuit was filed last week by unnamed parents of boys suspected of being abducted, sold and enslaved. They claim more than 30,000 boys could have been victim­ized and seek class-action status. 
The lawsuit alleges Sheikh Mohammed bin Hashid al Maktoum, the crown prince of Dubai, and Sheikh Ilamdan bin Hashid al Maktoum, the deputy ruler, were the most active perpetrators. 
The lawsuit was filed in Miami because the members of the royal family maintain hundreds of horses at farms in Ocala. The suit seeks unspecified damages. 
Calls to the United Arab Emirates embassy in Washington, D.C., were not answered and it was not pos­sible to leave a telephone message after hours. A tele­phone message left at a Kentucky farm owned by the crown prince was not returned. 
John Andres Thornton, co­counsel for the children, said the crown prince was served with the lawsuit Monday while buying horses in Kentucky. 
The lawsuit claims the boys were taken largely from Bangladesh and Pakistan, were held at desert camps in the UAE and other Persian Gulf nations, and forced to work. It claims some boys were sexually abused, given limited food and sleep and injected with hormones to prevent their growth.

On Sept. 12, just one day after-the fifth anniversary of the attacks on the United States by Muslim extremists, Pope Benedict XVI gave a speech at the University of Regensburg that has shaken the relationship between the Catholics and Muslims of the world. His lecture entitled "Faith, Reason and the University Memories and Reflections" is an excellent survey of the history of various philosophers and the­ologians attempting to reconcile the gaps between faith and rea­son. It is an excellent lecture except for one sticking point: a quote used partway through the speech from a conversation that took place in the 
· 14th century. This conversation purport­edly took place between Byzantine emper­or Paleologus and an "educated Persian." In it, Paleologus blasts Islam with his chal­lenge to the Persian: "Show me just what Mohammed brought that was new, and there you will fmd things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached." 
The rather unnecessary use of this quote was a serious oversight. The Pope was simply using this quote as a means to an end in the discussion; it had nothing to do with the fact that Islam was targeted in the quote. It merely was an illustration that "not to act in accordance with reason is contrary to God's nature." 
Unfortunately, to many in the Islamic community, it had everything to do with the fact that Islam was the subject reli­gion. In a world where terms such as "Islamofacism" are being coined and Muslims are being held in Guantanamo Bay without benefit of a trial or accusation of a crime, this quote is a wedge in the ever-growing rift between the Islamic community and the rest of the world. A<> a religious and political figure, the Pope's words are subject to extreme scrutiny and occasional misinterpretation. With this in mind, it is puzzling that he chose this par­ticular discussion, relevant as it may be, to cite in his lecture. 


However, he did. And it seems to have unraveled the hard work that Pope Benedict XVI has put into interfaith dia­logues, despite his recently heartlillt but perhaps unsatisl)ring apology. This will be a sore subject that repeatedly comes up in future discussions with Muslim scholars and leaders. But this is more than just a sore subject and a loss of Papal political capital; it has led to protests and violence in various parts of the globe. 
Churches were firebombed along the Gaza Strip in direct response to the quote. Denunciation of the Pope from leaders in Pakistan, Lebanon and Turkey were all issued promptly. Even the killing of a nun in Somalia is suspected to also be part of the backlash. This wave of violence in the Islamic world as a reflection of outrage harkens back to the publication of Danish cartoons depicting Mohammed earlier this year. The death toll for the ensuing vio­lence over the cartoon was roughly 150. 
Here's what boggles the mind now as much as then: why are some in the Muslim world protesting accusations of Islam being a violent religion with vio­lence? 
Islam is not a violent religion. It profess­es intense faith, charity, scholarship and desire for peace. The problem is that this is not what is displayed in the media. 
What most see is the death toll from Islamic insurgents, the results of the latest 
'sectarian violence' in Iraq and the preaching of extremist leaders who per­vert the Qur'an's teachings for their per­sonal agendas. Of course none of these things are really aspects of Islam any 
more than the IRA's violent tactics were reflections of the teachings of Catholicism. 
It's a great irony that the fundamentalist groups who profess a union of church and state have in fact managed to take all the true meaning of their religion out of their religion leaving only slanted political read­ings of the core text that go against every true value of the religion. Whether it be Christian fanatics who bomb abortion clin­ics, Muslims who run planes into buildings or Jews who use an 'any means necessary' approach to defending their homeland of Israel. All these violent acts in the name of religion make us ask the questions: "What do we actually believe? What does it mean to have faith? Is it still something possible in the modern world? ... In the end, we can no longer see the forest for the trees." This quotation is obviously not my own. It was said by a man far more intelligent and well versed in religious issues than I: Pope Benedict XVI. He said this the same day that he benignly used a quote that offend­ed the Islam world. Extreme members of Islam then proceeded to yet again miss the forest for the trees.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Overpopulation column disputed 
Population shrinking 
In her Thursday column, "Big families equal big trouble," Liz Coffey makes a number of wrong assumptions concerning the nature of population growth and use of natural resourc~s. They are assumptions that are often made and, because they lead to the deaths of countless children worldwide, must be corrected. 
First, while natural resources are finite, our ability to manipulate them with ever-increasing efficiency is not. Ifwe possessed today only the farming technology of 1900, much of the world's population would indeed be starving. But thanks to tremendous improvements in farming techniques all across the world, the world has never been better fed. This is not to say there are not disparities and a need for further improvement. But there is no reason to expect that the rate of technological improvement will slow in the future, at least while the earth's population is still rising. 
Second, the world will not continue to grow at its current rate. As people across the globe grow wealthier, they will naturally have fewer children. The population of the United States would be declining if it were not for our huge influx of immigrants. And most of Europe and Russia is hemorrhaging population. The challenge by the end of this century will probably be to keep the world's population from declining. If this happens, we will lose the added brainpower that keeps technological progress going strong. 
Predicting the end of the world is a great way to attract attention. It worked for Malthus two hundred years ago, and it works today. But with theories of population mayhem proven wrong again and again, why should we believe them now? 
Tim Wymore senior Zahm Hall Sept. 14 
Charity will save world 

It is surprising that Liz Coffey, in her argument against large families, employs the example of Thomas Malthus, when-as she admits-his predictions were vastly incorrect, such that one would expect his credibil­ity as a social scientist to be lessened somewhat. But Coffey reissues the Malthusian error unaltered: the human race is outstripping a closed set of resources, with woeful consequences to follow; the only solution is to reduce the human race. 
A better response is to question why Malthus failed so miserably, in the hopes of learning·from him. To take two examples: what Malthus could not havepredicted mathematically was the incredible effect of human inven­tion on the stock and use of resources; and what many should have predicted is the too-familiar effect of wealth on human concupiscence. 
Therefore: Malthus firstly miscalculated because in his stock-taking of earth's goods he did not adequately include human intelligence, which is not materially limited; every new birth increments need finitely, but it is also the birth of a mind, which adds an infinite potential to resources. 
Secondly, neither is human desire limited. When more is available, people tend to want more, as Coffey unin­tentionalLy demonstrates: the United States, she says, does not have the highest birth rate, but has the highest rate of consumption. But this very fact leads to the discovery that consumption is not proportional; quite the contrary. The United States has dropped nearly to replacement rate, and most of Europe is well below it, such that the West is committing civilizational suicide; and consumption has merely increased in response. A family of three can easily out-consume one of seven, simply because there is no limit to human greed.  
That is, no limit except for the virtue of charity, among whose many effects in marriage are fruitfulness and sacrifice, which find in the necessities of a large family thrift and creativity they could not have imagined in the plenty of a small. Charity is, as ever, the only way the world can be saved, materially or spiritually, whatever its population. 
Patrick Gardner groo student off-campus Sept. 14 
Loving children is not selfish 
Liz Coffey claims that "America is one of the leading killers in the ongoing mur­der of Mother Earth" in her Sept. 14 edi­torial ("Big families equal big trouble"). According to Coffey, the culprits for this slaughter are big families. She indulges in the fear mongering typical of pseudo­scientists of the 60s and 70s who predict­ed an imminent global catastrophe caused by population growth. This "sci­ence" has proved to be wrong: their pre­dictions failed to take into account the advances in agriculture, science, and technology that have occurred since then. If population has increased over the last century, then food production has exploded. The UN Population Division 2001 report, "World Population Monitoring 2001," stated: "From 1900 to 2000, world population grew from 1.6 billion to 6.1 billion persons. However, while world population increased close to 4 times, world real gross domestic prod­uct [actual output of goods and service] increased 20 to 40 times, allowing the world not only to sustain a fourfold popu­lation increase but also to do so at vastly higher standards of living." The truth is that humanity is in no danger of becom­ing extinct because of overpopulation and big families. Coffey's claim that "having six kids is selfish" is not only false, but offensive and illogical as well. I have six siblings. My youngest three brothers are adopted. My parents' choice to adopt three inner-city children and love them as their own was anything but selfish. My parents have given much of their love, time, and yes, valuable resources, to provide them with a fair shot at life. Coffey acts as if it would've been better if my brothers had been left on the dangerous streets of drug-ridden neighborhoods. Back in the slums, my brothers wouldn't be using up nearly as much of the world's resources and "has­tening its death." In light of this, Liz Coffey's accusation of selfishness is grossly insulting. 
I wouldn't mind, however, if Coffey would follow her own advice and have only one or two children. At least then her ignorant attitudes wouldn't be passed on to much of the next generation.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Honor tradition 
OK, so the game was not pretty, let's get that out first. It will be analyzed to death by ESPN, every sportswriter in America, my grandmother and that kid that sits behind you in your 9:30 history class. Everyone will have an opinion about what went wrong, and I guess I am no different. My disappointment how­ever, lies not with the team, but with the fans -the student body in particular. In fact, I was so saddened by the lack of energy displayed by the students that it prompted me to write this letter. I started my collegiate career at Notre Dame in the fall of 1996. So for those of you who keep track of such informa­tion, I was here for the last season of Lou Holtz (8-3) and the first two seasons of the Bob Davie era (7-6 and 9-2; I was gone for the harsh 5 and 7 '99 season). I returned to the University this past January, looking forward to cheering on the Irish again come fall. After six long seasons away from the stadium, it was awe-inspiring to again be a part of the amazing tradition that is the student section at the University. But that awe was dulled this week as I watched senior after senior leaving the game before half time or during the third quarter. For the majority of the game, there was little to no cheering coming from the entire senior section. I overheard comments such as ''I'd rather go drink at Legend's then watch this." The low point for me came when we allowed the 5,000 or so Michigan fans to be louder then the entire student section, with chants of "why so quiet" and "overrated." I look around and see thousands of fans proudly sporting The Shirt with its proclamation of "Tradition," and I wonder do we really know what tradition is, or worse yet, do we care? Coach Weis and the players started a tradition last week of having the team sing the Alma Mater with the student body. It is a beautiful scene, and I hope that it holds as the years go by, but I couldn't help but notice how empty the seats around me were as the band played at the end of this week's game. I know how fleeting it is that we get the chance to be a part of something as amazing and inspiring as Notre Dame football, and I pity those seniors who will regret leaving even two min­utes early when they look back on their time at Notre Dame. You may return for games as an alum, but it is and never will be the same. Treasure your time here, treasure the traditions and the history.

MOVIE REVIEW 

Crossword devotees shine in documentary 
ture, including Ken Burns, Jon Stewart, Mike Mussina and Bill Clinton. All of these men have a great appreciation for Shurtz and the New York Times crossword, espe­cially Stewart, whose segments are hilari­ous. Calling himself a "Times puzzle man," he remarks that he'll do the USA Today puzzle if he's in a hotel, but adds that "I won't feel good about myself." 
"Wordplay" is about more than Shurtz, however, as it also focuses on competitors in the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament. Four competitors in particu­

By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Scene Editor 

At once engrossing and informative, Patrick Creadon's "Wordplay" is a taut and fast-paced documentary about Will Shurtz, the crossword puzzle editor for The New York Times. 
The film opens with a brief history of the crossword puzzle before concentrating on Shurtz, who holds a degree in Enigmatology (puzzle-solving, the only 
degree of its kind) from the University of Indiana. He has been crossword editor of The Times since 1993. Shurtz is charis­matic, intelligent and well-spoken, and his under­standing of puzzles is nearly unparal­

competitive mentality. 

leled. Were the documentary solely focused on him, it would still be entertain­ing in its own right, but "Wordplay" has much more on its mind. 
Celebrities abound throughout the pic-
Ripstein is a nerdy baton-twirler with radiant confidence. She remarks that a boyfriend made fun of her passion, to which she replies, "What are you the best in the world at?" 


Payne is a three-time ACPT winner, who at 24 was the youngest champion ever. Sanders is·a father and businessman who does the New York Times crossword every night (usually in under three minutes). Hinman is a 20-year-old Rutgers student who is striving to replace Payne as the youngest ACPT champion. 
Once the film shifts into the crossword competition, the film takes on a whole dif­ferent kind of life -the final crossword competition is surprisingly tense thanks to Creadon's approach, which emphasizes character. 
The audience by this time has gotten to know each of the three competitors, all of whom have the drive and ambition. Viewers at once want everyone to win and don't want any to lose, a testament to Creadon's sense of character. 
The most fascinating aspect of the film is the relationship between building the puzzles and solving the puzzles. Merl Heagle, a brilliant puzzle constructor, demonstrates the intricacies that go into the making of a crossword puzzle. His skill and intelligence is obvious, though he clearly loves what he does and is very good at it. At one point while driving, he casually remarks that moving the "D" of Dunkin Donuts to the end of the word makes it spell Unkind Donuts. 
The scenes that show puzzles being solved are adroitly handled. Audiences see a graphic of a puzzle being solved, which allows them to follow along -rather than be vertiginous and confusing (as it easily could have been), these scenes are direct and easy to follow. 
"Wordplay" was an official selection at the Sundance Film Festival and is a likely candidate for a Best Documentary Academy Award nomination. Creadon has proven himself to be quite a good film­maker, and unlike Morgan Spurlock and Michael Moore, he does not feel the need to make himself the focus of his own movie. After all, he knows he has a unique subject and approaches it with vigor and zeal. 
"Wordplay" is an excellent film, not just for people who care about puzzles, but for people who care about movies and, per­haps most importantly, for people who care about people.

Beaten and blue 
Michigan throttles Notre Dame 47-21, dims Irish national title hopes 

By TIM DOUGHERTY Sports Writer 
Another week, another Big Ten blowout -this time with opposite results. Led by wide receiver Mario Manningham 's three touchdown recep­tions, No. 11 Michigan capitalized on five Notre Dame turnovers to rout the No. 2 Irish 47-21 Saturday. 
Heisman hopeful Brady Quinn threw three interceptions -two to senior line­backer Prescott Burgess -as the Irish offense never found its rhythm, totaling 245 yards -including just four rushing -for the day. 
With the score tied 7-7 in the first quarter, Henne found Manningham for the go-ahead touchdown on a 69-yard fly down the sideline, from which the Irish never recovered. Though after the game Irish coach Charlie Weis said they had a "deep alert" on the play, the receiver soundly beat senior corner Ambrose Wooden before the catch, as the Irish secondary could not defend the big play, giving up its first of three 20 yard-plus touchdown receptions to Manningham before halftime. Manningham is the first player to haul in three scores against Notre Dame since Pat Fitzgerald of Texas in 1995. 
"I was able to run a good route and get by the defender," said Manningham about his 69-yard score. "I put a good move on him to get his hips turned and then I was able to get by him." 
On the heels of a blocked extra point by senior defensive tackle Derek Landri after Manningham's first score, sopho­more David Grimes fumbled the ensuing kickoff and with it the game. Four plays and two Irish penalties after Michigan cornerback Morgan Trent recovered to set the Wolverines up at the Irish 27, running back Michael Hart dove over top of the line to make the score 20-7. Hart also added 124 yards on 31 carries to balance a Wolverine attack that out­gained Notre Dame 340 yards to 245. 
"I have a lot of respect for Coach Carr and his staff," Weis said. "I think it's really important to understand that that team just came and just whooped us pretty good. They deserve their just due." 
With the score at 34-7 with under two minutes left in the first half, Notre Dame finally put together a scoring drive, com­pleting four consecutive completions for first downs, highlighted by sophomore David Grimes' leaping catch at the side­line inside the five. On the next play, senior receiver Jeff Samardzija reached back into traffic to haul in a touchdown pass to cut the deficit to 34-14 at half­time. But the rally never came. 
Quinn exploited the Wolverines' pre­vent defense on the touchdown drive­the first of the half in which he didn't face constant pressure from the Michigan front four led by Branch. 
"We went in with the idea if we were going to have a chance to win, we had to pressure Brady Quinn," Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said. "We felt we could do that because we have an excellent front. I mean, we've got some depth and we've got some guys that are very athletic. It's the best front we've had probably since I've been at Michigan." 
That defensive pressure made things difficult for Quinn from the begninning. On the game's second play from scrim­mage, under heavy pressure from junior defensive tackle Alan Branch, Quinn threw a high pass that slipped through the hands of senior tight end John Carlson and into those of Burgess, who ran 31 yards untouched for Michigan's first score. Quinn would throw two more interceptions before the end of the day along with three touchdowns in a 24-for­48, 234-yard effort. 
After a three and out Irish punt, senior safety Chinedum Ndukwe returned the favor when he intercepted a third and long pass from junior quarterback Chad Henne and returned it 51 yards before Henne could knock him out of bounds at the Michigan four. Quinn capitalized and threw a play action strike to senior full­back Ashley McConnell, marking his first career start with his first touchdown before Michigan followed with four straight scores to take a 20 point half­time lead that knocked Notre Dame out of the game and -likely -National Championship contention. 
The Irish were forced to abandon a balanced offensive attack in the second half due to the deficit and an ineffective rushing game that only gained 24 yards on 12 carries not including sack yardage. Dropped balls by Irish receivers as well as running back Darius Walker prevent­ed the passing attack from finding its typical success. 
"I was surprised that we collectively, from me on down, laid an egg," Weis said. "I expected us to have a better per­formance than we did, and we didn't. That surprises me. I expected us to do better in all facets." 
Needing a quick spark coming out of halftime, the Irish went three and out their first three drives and failed to record a first down in the entire third quarter, as they converted just two of 14 on third down for the day. After a Michigan field goal, Notre Dame mount­ed another touchdown drive in the fourth quarter, capped by a bizarre catch by Rhema McKnight, who fought off pass interference to snatch the ball off the defender's leg in the end zone to bring the game to 40-21. 
With three minutes remaining in the game, the Irish drove the final nail in their own coffic. On a drive in which the Irish committed three penalties, Quinn was sacked on third and six and fum­bled, allowing defensive end LaMarr Woodley to pick up the ball and run 54 yards for the fmal score.

quarterbacks: Three interceptions at cru­cial points in the game were devastat­ing for the Irish, and Quinn's fumble in the fourth quarter was the end of hope for even the most optimisitc Irish fans. 
running backs: Four rushing yards is deceptive, as it also includes lost yardage on sacks. Carr focused on stopping the running game and succeeded beyond expectations. 
receivers: The receivers dropped balls and didn't seem to run routes with intensity. Although Quinn often threw hurriedly and off-target, poor position­ing by receivers killed several drives. 
offensive line: The Irish knew Michigan would bring pressure from all angles and still couldn't seem to keep a pocket for Quinn. The run­ning backs also struggled to find 
defensive line: The defensive line was able to pressure Henne at times, with Victor Abimiari totaling 2.5 tackles for loss. Trevor Laws had 10 tackles but when the Wolverines ran the ball, the line had trouble stopping Mike Hart. 
linebackers: The starting linebackers accounted for just twelve tackles, six by Maurice Crum, Jr. The Wolverines were able to run the ball and control the clock, especially in the third quarter. 
defensive backs: The defensive backs proved susceptible once again to the deep ball, giving up an early 69-yard bomb to Mario Manningham. 
Chinedum Ndukwe had a key intercep­

8  special teams: Geoff Price tried to keep the Irish in the game, setting a school punting record. But David Grimes fumbled a kickoff return that proved  
costly and punt returns were weak.

and preparation.

It stayed in South Bend. 

With a little help from the same phantoms, ghosts and demons that haunted Carr in his previous three trips to Notre Dame, he earned his first win in South Bend this week­end. In doing so, Carr cleansed his conscience of the miscues and screw-ups that kept the Maize and Blue from winning a game at Notre Dame since 1994. 
Shane Walton's timely intercep­tion sealed Michigan's fate in 2002. The sudden discovery of Darius Walker beat the Wolverines in 2004. Even a Bob Davie-led drubbing of the defending nation­al champs stymied Carr in 1998. 
Everything that had hurt Lloyd Carr in past games against the Irish disappeared in front of a 
stunned 80,000 at Notre Dame Stadium. 
But phantoms in a rivalry like the Fight Song Fight-featuring the two most successful football schools (and marching bands)­don't just go away. 
They switch sides. Saturday was Notre Dame's

The figure perched on the football as it popped out of David Grimes' hands on a kickoff return, giving Michigan the ball right back.

Wolverines stifle Irish offense 
Notre Dame struggles to develop offensive rhythm 
By KATE GALES Associate Sports Editor 
The Michigan defensive line pres­sured Irish quarterback Brady Quinn all afternoon. 
The linebackers blitzed and didn't allow Notre Dame to establish any­thing resembling a running game. 
The secondary eliminated a viable passing game, keeping Notre Dame's receivers covered and under constant pressure. 
Saturday's story was all about Michigan's effectiveness against what was considered one of the nation's top offenses. 
"We went in [to the game] with the idea if we were going to have a chance to win, we had to pressure Brady Quinn," Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said. "We felt we could do that because we have an excellent front. I mean, we've got some depth and we've got some guys that are very athletic." 
Notre Dame certainly didn't prove Carr wrong. 
Quinn was unable to set his feet all 
day, and hurries kept him off-balance 
and unable to hit receivers in stride. 
"There was a lot of blitzing, espe­
cially later in the game," Irish coach 
Charlie Weis said. "I have a lot of 
respect for their front four." 
But pressuring Quinn was just one 
facet of a defense that dominated the 
game from start to finish. 
"It wasn't just their front four -I 
thought their whole defense played 
good," Weis said. 
Linebacker Preston Burgess inter­
cepted Quinn twice, one returned 31 

yards to halt Notre Dame's first series. Cornerback Leon Hall added one more, and cornerback Morgan Trent and defensive end LaMarr Woodley picked up fumbles, totaling five Irish turnovers. 
"I think this game was a team effort," Carr said. "But it certainly was, I think, punctuated by our defense." 
The man who put the 

biggest exclamation mark into the punctuation was Burgess. 
The senior linebacker from Warren, 
"We went in [to the smooth as his game] with the idea if game against the 
Irish. After playing

time as a fresh­man on special Lloyd Carr teams, but was 
Wolverines coach quiet on defense 
Ohio had what Carr called "quite a day." That could have been the under­statement of the day by Carr. 
"I mean, you intercept a ball, run back for the touchdown, then make another big one," he said. 
Burgess' devel­
opment wasn't as 
last year. 
He was anything but placid Saturday and neither was his team. 
The Wolverine defense was credited with six quarterback hurries, four pass break ups and five tackles for loss as it wouldn't let Notre Dame's offense settle into a rhythm. It took away Irish running back Darius Walker -who led the Irish in rushing with a meager 25 yards -and forced Notre Dame to be "one dimensional," Carr said. 

Although consistent play by the sec­ondary was crucial, praise returned to the front four, which Carr said could be the best he's had at Michigan. 
One of those on the front four was Woodley, who had two tackles, one for a loss and outran Irish tight end John Carlson on a 54-yard fumble return touchdown to top off Michigan's day. 
"Woodley, in my judgment ... he's the real deal," Carr said. "He's a cap­tain. He's a leader. Done a great job." 
Notre Dame would probably agree.

Wooden's game injury not threatening 
Cornerback left game groggy after tackle; was held out as precautionary measure 
By TIM DOUGHERTY Sports Writer 
Irish cornerback Ambrose Wooden is OK to play. He was cleared to play by team medical staff Saturday, soon after he delivered a crushing hit to Michigan receiver Adrian Arrington in the third quarter of Notre Dame's 47-21 loss to Michigan, but coach Charlie Weis held him out of the game in order to "err on the side of caution." 
"We figured the best thing to do would be to go ahead and get him out of there," he said. "His head was fairly clear. [Putting Wooden back in] just didn't seem like the right thing to d0. " 
The Irish have a policy where players must be cleared by the medical staff and answer football-related 
questions from a position coach before returning to the game after a head injury. 
+ Penalties hampered the Irish all day Saturday, as the team committed 11 for 84 yards. Michigan tal­lied five whistles for 70 yards. The Irish have 28 penalties in 2006, having also committed 11 penalties against Georgia Tech in the season opener. 
The Irish were penalized five times for holding Saturday, giving them 10 total on the year. Irish opponents have not been whistled for an offensive hold in the first three games. 
+ Saturday was the first time Notre Dame has lost to Michigan at home since 1994. It also snaps a two­game win streak against 
Michigan. The win certainly pleased Michigan coach Lloyd Carr who has heard grumbles in Ann Arbor after losing three of his last four games against rival Ohio State and, before Saturday, three of his last four against Notre Dame. Carr, who is 4-1 against No. 2 teams and 16-6 against top-10 teams, downplayed the connection between the win and his job security. 
"If you coach in enough of these games or play in enough of them, you're going to win some and you're going to lose some," he said. "I've done both. Cer!.ainly today was our day. 
+ The 47 points Notre Dame gave up marked the most it had allowed at home since a 51-19 loss against Purdue in 1960. Additionally, Notre Dame's five turnovers on three interceptions and two fum­bles were the most it sur­rendered since the 14-7 loss to Boston College in 2002, the first loss of Tyrone Willingham's three­year tenure as head coach. 
+ Geoff Price set a sin­gle-game record by boom­ing seven punts for an average of 51.9 yards per punt, including a long of 
59. He currently ranks third in the nation with a 
49.8 average. Michigan's combination of Zoltan Mesko and Ross Ryan com­bined for a 3 7. 5 yard aver­age. More importantly, they successfully kicked away from Irish returner Tom Zbikowski, allowing him only one return for four yards.

Big game blo-wout 
The Wolverines took the fight out of the Irish Saturday, efficiently 
shutting down quarterback Brady Quinn's favorite receivers and allowing just four rushing yards. The Irish defense had its moments, but five turnovers by the offense gave Michigan a short 
field all afternoon. Michigan quarterback Chad Henne avenged two years of brutality by the Irish, going 8-for-12 with three touchdowns in the first half. The Irish were unable to gain control of the clock and Quinn's fumble late in the fourth quarter ended hopes of a miraculous comeback.

MOVIE REVIEW 
Heder and Thornton drive comedy off-course 
By CASSIE BELEK Assistant Scene Editor 
Funny but disappointing can best explain director Todd Phillips' comedy "School for Scoundrels." Although the movie starts out promisingly strong, the man who gave us "Old School" delivers a weak and forgettable second act -one that could, and should, have been so much more. 
"School for Scoundrels" stars Jon Heder ("Napoleon Dynamite") as Roger, a lonely NYC meter maid, and Billy Bob Thornton ("Bad Santa") as Dr. P, the no nonsense "scoundrel" who teaches Roger how to win his crush, Amanda (Jacinda Barrett). When Roger soon jumps to the head of the class Dr. P teaches, the good doctor's competitive habits set him out on a path to destroy Roger's life and

Phillips, who also co-wrote the screen­play, continues his pattern of presenting weak female supporting characters that exist solely for male character develop­ment. "School for Scoundrels" follows the typical storyline for this kind of movie ­good boy likes girl, amoral boy gets girl, good boy is only person who can save duped girl from amoral boy and herself. Amanda is another forgettable female character in a male-dominated movie~ 
The only other dominant female char­acter is Amanda's roommate, played by Sarah Silverman. Silverman's character bombards Roger with deadpan insults in one of the least funny performances by a comedian this year.

DPAC SPOTLIGHT 
'Potemkin' remains revolutionary cinematic model

Scene Editor 
It is near the middle of the film, which is no mistake -it is obviously the centerpiece. Once it has been seen, it can't be shaken, much less forgotten. The images remain burned in the consciousness, stay in the back of the mind, linger in their relentless­ness. 
Crowds frantically fleeing down the steps. A mother carrying her fallen child. A woman screaming silently in utter terror. The legs of stormtrooper­like Cossacks, marching along roboti­cally with their rifles drawn. The baby carriage.

beliefs ran contrary to popular think­ing at the time, which was that each shot in a film is a building block that creates meaning. Instead, he believed that the true worth of the juxtaposi­tion of shots is conflict. The meaning created from the combination of shots was far greater· than the value of each individual shot in of itself. 
This theory manifested itself most clearly in "Battleship Potemkin" ­more specifically, in the "Odessa Steps" sequence. The film uses editing as a tool that creates tension and meaning in a powerful way. The last­ing images of "Potemkin" are as indelible as anything committed to celluloid.

"Battleship Potemkin" was and still is problematic for many due to its moments. Heder may have carried "Napoleon Dynamite," but he holds a stronger audience interest in the first half of this movie when he acts with an ensemble. The second half offers weaker performances from Heder and surpris­ingly, Thornton. Although clearly a cad, Dr. P's motivations remain unclear.

if at all -for its first act. After that, it veers off its solid path into an over-long and under-developed love story that quickly grows tired and boring. If this is an attempt to recapture any "Old School" glory, Phillips miserably fails. "School for Scoundrels" does not deliver an endless treasure trove of funny quotes for the American public to overuse. Instead, the movie is good for only a few laughs before the drama-heavy Oscar season begins.

nature as Soviet propaganda. The film is incendiary, however, it is incendiary against the Czarist regime and casts the Soviets in a supremely positive light. It is at times difficult to overlook the obvious nature of the propaganda, but once a person is able to do so, the filmic genius of the picture shines through. 
Eisenstein was, above all else, a man who loved the cinema. His exten­sive writings on Soviet Montage were revolutionary, but it's the films them­selves that stand as lasting evidence of his passion. 
"Battleship Potemkin" may be Soviet propaganda, but it is cinematic propa­ganda as well. Eisenstein believed that the construction of shots creates meaning and the meaning of "Potemkin" is clear -marvel at the power, greatness and deserved right­eousness of the Soviet Union. But the hidden meaning, the greater meaning and more timeless meaning, the meaning that Eisenstein is ultimately remembered for is also clear -mar­vel at the power, greatness and deserved righteousness of the cinema.

Padres defeat Dodgers to take over the lead in NL West 
San Diego prevails in pitchers' duel 2-1 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES-If it weren't for playing the Los Angeles Dodgers, the San Diego Padres might be lagging in the NL West. 
Thanks to their domination of the Dodgers, the Padres instead are a half-game up in the divi­sion, passing Los Angeles with a 2-1 victory Sunday. 
San Diego has won eight of the last nine meetings. The Padres are 13-4 overall against Los Angeles and 7-1 at Dodger Stadium. 
"There's no rhyme or reason to it," Padres manager Bruce Bochy said. 
Chris Young pitched one-hit ball for six innings, pinch-hitter Terrmel Sledge singled home the go-ahead run in the ninth and Trevor Hoffman earned his 475th career save. 
"They seem to get the big hits and pitch the big innings when they need them," said the Dodgers' Derek Lowe, who held San Diego to Russell Branyan's solo homer over seven innings. 
The Padres, atop the division for the first time since Aug. 9, go for their third straight win in the four-game set on Monday night at Dodger Stadium, their final regular-season meeting. 
The Dodgers won the opener 3-1 behind Greg Maddux, and the Padres bounced back with an 11-2 victory on Saturday night. 
"We don't want them to win three. out of four at our park," Lowe said. "We need to play the last game as if it's a must­win." 
Branyan agreed, from the Padres' perspective. 
"We're in first place by a half a game, and tomorrow's game really separates the men from the boys, I believe," he said. "If we can go up a game and a half with 14 games left in the sea­son, we'll be looking pretty good." 
Bochy figures the race will remain tight down the stretch. 
"We're right there. We know it," he said. "It's neck and neck. It's great to get this one. To come back after a tough loss and win two straight is big." 
Los Angeles manager Grady Little also believes it will gone down to the wire. 
"It was a tight game in a tight pennant race -and it's going to remain that way," he said. 
While the Dodgers dropped out of the division lead, they are one game ahead of Philadelphia for the wild card. 
Sledge singled to right off Jonathon Broxton to score pinch-runner Khalil Greene from second base. Josh Bard singled with one out, Greene came into the game and Geoff Blum walked. 
With the bases loaded, Broxton (3-1) struck out Brian Giles and retired Josh Barfield on a foul pop to keep the Dodgers within one run. 
Scott Linebrink (7-3) shut out Los Angeles in the eighth, and Hoffman pitched the ninth for his 39th save in 43 chances, and his career total is just three shy of Lee Smith's major league record. 
After Chris Young held the Dodgers to one hit during his six shutout innings, Russell Martin homered off Cia Meredith with one out in the seventh to tie it at 1.

Martin's shot over the fence in center was his ninth of the season and ended Meredith's franchise-record string of 34 scoreless innings. The San Diego reliever hadn't allowed a run in 28 appearances dating to July 17. 
Pirates 3, Mets 0 

The New York Mets failed for the third straight day to clinch the NL East title at PNC Park when the Pittsburgh Pirates fin­ished off an unlikely sweep. 
New York was denied its first division title since 1988 later in the day when second-place Philadelphia beat Houston 6-4. The Mets can clinch at home Monday night with a win over Florida or a loss by the Phillies. 
The Mets came to Pittsburgh with a magic number of one and the best record in the majors. Even with a sizable contingent of New York fans in the stands, the young Pirates became the first NL team to sweep the Mets this season. 
Showing their spirit, the Pirates -with the next-to­worst record in the league ­celebrated with hearty hand­shakes on the field. Pittsburgh completed its first three-game sweep at home against New York since 1998. 
Zach Duke (10-13) pitched shutout ball for eight innings, Freddy Sanchez had two hits and two RBis and Chris Duffy scored twice for the Pirates. 
Phillies 6, Astros 4 

Ryan Howard hit his major league-leading 57th home run_ without any dispute -and Mike Lieberthal connected twice as Randy Wolf and the Phillies kept up their push for a wild-card spot by beating Houston. 

Jimmy Rollins also homered as Philadelphia prevented the New York Mets from clinching the NL East. The second-place Phillies, however, are aiming at the wild card and are one game behind Los Angeles for that spot. 
Howard tied a team record with 29 road home runs in a season. He's homered in 16 of the 19 parks he's played this year. 
Wolf (4-0) won while pitching on three days' rest for the first time in his career. He won his career-best ninth straight deci­sion, the first time a Phillies starter has done that since Steve Carlton in 1980-81. 
Wandy Rodriguez (9-10) took the loss. 
Braves 8, Marlins 7 
Marcus Giles hit an RBI single and another runner scored when Florida left fielder Josh Willingham let the ball go through his legs, capping a five-run rally. 
After Florida scored four times in the top of the lOth, errors by shortstop Hanley Ramirez and Willingham let Atlanta win it. 
It was a demoralizing defeat for the young Marlins, who fell four games behind Los Angeles in the wild-card race. Florida lost for the fourth time in five games. 
With one out in the Atlanta 1Oth, Brian McCann doubled off Joe Borowski (3-3) and took third on a single by Jeff Francoeur. Matt Diaz followed with a two-run double and took third on a bloop single by Willy Aybar. 
Pinch-hitter Bryan Pena then reached when Ramirez when failed to hold onto a forceout throw, scoring Diaz to make it 7-6. Giles followed with his one-out single that rolled through Willingham, scoring Aybar and Pena. 
Kevin Barry (1-1) got one out for the win. 
Rockies 6, Diamondbacks 1 
Jeff Francis gave up three hits in eight strong innings and Jeff Baker hit his first homer of the season to help the Rockies beat the error-prone Diamondbacks. 
Francis (12-11) struck out five and did not walk a batter as Colorado snapped a three­game losing streak. Brian Fuentes pitched the ninth to complete the three-hitter. 
Miguel Batista (10-7) gave up three runs in six innings for the loss. 
Cubs 11, Reds 3 
Carlos Zambrano hit his fifth homer of the season and threw seven shutout innings in his return to help the Cubs beat the Reds. 
Zambrano (15-6) had missed his last two starts with lower back stiffness and picked up his first win since Aug. 24. He gave up four hits, struck out six and walked four. 
The right-hander left a game on Sept. 4 in the second inning complaining of back troubles. He was questionable to start this game before Saturday but is now one win away from tying his career high, set in 2004 when he went 16-8. 
Jacque Jones, Ronny Cedeno and Zambrano all homered in the Cubs' seven-run first inning. 
Eric Milton (8-8) left after recording just one out. 
Nationals 6, Brewers 1 
Austin Kearns homered and hit the go-ahead single in the seventh to lead the Nationals beat the Milwaukee Brewers 6­1 Sunday. 
Doug Davis (10-11) was per­fect for the first 4 1-3 innings before Kearns hit his 23rd home run of the season to left field. In the seventh, Bernie Castro reached on an infield single, moved to second on a sacrifice by Felipe Lopez and scored when Kearns looped a single to shallow right field. 
The Nationals added four runs in the eighth inning, including a rare three-run sin­gle by Lopez. 
Saul Rivera (3-0) pitched a scoreless seventh to earn the win.

Associated Press 
FARMINGTON, Pa. ­Ben Curtis excels in tak­ing home the best possi­ble going-away presents from disappearing PGA Tour events. 
Curtis, start-to-finish steady on a day when the leaderboard was filled with higher scores than the previous three days, claimed a lame-duck tour event for the second time in three months by win­ning the 84 Lumber Classic by two shots Sunday. 
Not only keeping his lead but building on it down the stretch, he broke out of a four-way 

tie for the lead at the turn with Charles Howell III, Robert Garrigus and Ryan Moore by getting three birdies in a span of five holes from No. 12 through No. 16, thanks to some excellent putting. 
But it was a par during that stretch may have won it for him, and the $828,000 first prize for finishing at 14-under 274, two ahead of Howell. 
Curtis flew a shot over the par-4 14th green and onto a grassy, uphill apron that left him with an extremely difficult shot. But he used a utility club -the same one that helped him win the 2003 British Open -to roll it 
IN BRIEF 
One week after stabbing,
Northern Colorado wins 
SAN MARCOS, Texas --The irony that Northern Colorado, down three punters after a week of controversy, won with a blocked punt was not lost on coach Scott Downing. 
"I don't even know what to say about that," said Downing, who lost two punters this week in a bizarre stabbing scandal that brought nation­al attention to the small university about 60 miles north of Denver. 
The Bears beat Texas State 14-13 on Saturday night for their first win on the road in three seasons. 
"It has been a tough week, but you know these guys, they're the type they survive a lot of stuff," Downing said. 
Bears punter Rafael Mendoza was treated Monday for a 3-to 5-inch deep puncture wound and released from the hospital after being stabbed outside his apartment in Evans, near Greeley, Colo. 

to about 12 feet, then sank that putt to save par and stay in the lead. 
He went up by three shots by dropping a 13­footer on No. 15, when Howell three-putted from 49 feet, then effectively won it by sinking a 50­footer on the par-5 16th that allowed him to with­stand a bogey on No. 17, a par 3. 
Curtis won cheers from the local gallery by wear­ing black and gold colors for the fourth day in a row -he is an avowed Browns fan who normally despises the Steelers. The former Kent State golfer won his third career title by holding off 15 others who began the day within three shots of the lead. 
Some fans chanted "Here we go Steelers, here we go!" when Curtis walked past, but the frown on his face revealed his true colors ­namely brown, orange and white. 
''I'm going to get my Browns hat out," he said. 
If any more events dis­appear from the PGA Tour schedule, look for Curtis to be the favorite in their final tournament. 
Curtis won the last Booz Allen Classic in late June, his first victory since that British Open, and then won the fourth and last 84 Lumber Classic. 

Gilder comes back to defend 
Energy Classic title 
HUNT VALLEY, Md. -No one will miss the Constellation Energy Classic more than Bob Gilder. 
Gilder shot a 7 -under 65, the lowest round of the day on Sunday, to over­come a three-shot deficit and success­fully defend his title, finishing two strokes ahead of Brad Bryant, Don Pooley and Jay Haas in the final year of the Champions Tour event. 
"Now we're leaving. He's going to go into mourning," Bryant said. "It's going to be terrible [for him]. It's like the Bob Gilder Annuity Fund here." 
Next year, the Senior Players Championship comes to nearby Baltimore Country Club. 
It was Gilder's ninth Champions Tour win, but only his second since 2003. Both have come at Hayfields Country Club, where he has never finished worse than 14th in five appearances. 
Gilder posted a seven-birdie, no­bogey final round to fmish at 14 under. 
Harvick's gamble pays off at 
New Hampshire Speedway 
LOUDON, N.H. -Kevin Harvick saw the hole in front of him, a small patch of open track between two other cars. 
Driving through it would be risky, but Harvick's never shied away from taking chances. So he shoved his Chevrolet in between Denny Hamlin and Jeff Burton, forcing his way to the front and running away with the win Sunday at New Hampshire International Speedway. 
This is how Harvick plans to run for his first Nextel Cup title: Unafraid, unapologetic and with everything he's got. 
"At this point, it's all about the championship and going for it and throwing caution to the wind," Harvick said of his three-wide pass just 37 laps into the race. "If you look back on it, I probably wouldn't do that again." 
Harvick, who started from the pole and paced almost every practice ses­sion, led 196 of the 300 laps.

Auburn and Florida collle up big in key SEC lllatchups 
Ducks best Sooners in nail-biter, 34-33 
Associated Press 
EUGENE -In a wild final 72 seconds, Dennis Dixon and the Oregon Ducks had everything go their way. 
Dixon rallied for two late touchdowns, with the help of a successful onside kick, and the No. 18 Ducks blocked a field goal on the final play to seal a victory over No. 15 Oklahoma on Saturday. 
"This shows the nation we can play with the big boys," Oregon rover Patrick Chung said. "We beat Oklahoma, No. 15 in the nation, and now you have to watch out for Oregon." 
Dixon's 16-yard keeper with 
1:12 left brought the Ducks within 33-27 and set up the onside kick attempt. 
The Ducks (3-0) recovered the bouncing kick on their own 48, but Oklahoma (2-1) argued that an Oregon player touched the ball before it went the required 10 yards, which would have given the Sooners possession. Officials delayed play for an instant replay review, but the call stood and Dixon went to work. 
After a pass interference call on Oklahoma again had Sooners coach Bob Stoops shaking his head on the side­line, Dixon threw a 23-yard TD pass to Brian Paysinger with 46 seconds to give Oregon the lead. 
Pac-1 0 commissioner Tom Hansen said Saturday night that both the onside kick and pass interference call will be reviewed by the league. 
Oklahoma wasn't done, though, as Reggie Smith returned a squib kick 55 yards to the Ducks' 27. 
With no timeouts the Sooners ran one play, run into the line by Adrian Peterson, then spiked the ball with a second left. Garrett Hartley's 44-yard field-goal attempt wasn't high enough to clear the line and the Ducks celebrated. 
"I was just praying we would get that onside kick," said Sooners tailback Adrian Peterson, who ran for 211 yards. "Once we didn't get it, things got really ugly from there. " 
The onside kick was made by Luke Bellotti, Oregon coach Mike Bellotti's son. 
"The thing about coaching your son it that it is pretty diffi­cult sometimes. Some positions require judgmental things that are fairly subjective. Kicking is not, it's very objective," the elder Bellotti said. 
"He's the best guy for that type of kick on the football team. Obviously, I'm very pleased for him, first of all because he's my son, and sec­ondly because it gave our team a chance to win. That's a total team thing." 
Auburn 7, LSU 3 
Eric Brock's instructions were simple and altogether appropriate for the final play of Auburn's latest slugfest with LSU. 
"The coaches told us any­thing we see in front of us, you hit it," the Auburn safety said. 
Brock's game-saving tackle just a few yards from the goal line on the final play preserved No. 3 Auburn's win over sixth­ranked LSU on Saturday. He also tipped away a fourth-down pass to end another late LSU threat as Auburn turned away the visiting Tigers again and again. 

What has become the Southeastern Conference's most rugged rivalry had all the usual elements: two punishing defenses, an pivotal officials' call that left both sides a bit perplexed and some follies in the kicking game. 
The call went Auburn's way. 
With LSU facing fourth-and-8 from Auburn's 31 and 2:43 left, JaMarcus Russell fired the ball to Early Doucet near the goal line. A diving Brock deflected the pass, but Zach Gilbert was called for pass interference that would have kept the drive alive. 
The officials overturned the call, although replays showed the contact came before the ball was tipped by Brock. 
"I got sick to my stomach," said Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville about seeing the flag. "I still don't understand it. It's just a judgment call and thank goodness it went our way." 
LSU coach Les Miles wasn't 
happy with the change. 
"If the ball is tipped at the line of scrimmage, there is no pass interference," said Miles, also unhappy with a pass inter­ference call against his team. "The ball was tipped downfield. The proper explanation will be forthcoming." 
Auburn (3-0, 2-0) got the ball but LSU's defense stopped Kenny Irons on three straight runs. Irons had 70 yards on 25 tough carries. 
The visiting Tigers (2-1, 0-1) drove to Auburn's 24 with 2.5 seconds left as Russell hooked up with Craig Davis for gains of 20 and 21 yards and Dwayne Bowe for 21. On the final play, Russell went to Davis again. The receiver caught the pass inside the 10, but Brock stopped him cold with a jarring hit at the 4. 
"It was a low throw on the final play, but it was not JaMarcus' fault," said Davis, who had 96 yards receiving. "I was expecting it to be a jump ball in the end zone." 
Russell finished 20-for-35 for 267 yards. 
Florida 21, Tennessee 20 
Another Florida coach has Tennessee's number. 
Dallas Baker caught a 21­yard touchdown pass from Chris Leak that gave Florida the lead in the fourth quarter and the Gators held on to beat No. 13 Tennessee on Saturday. 
Coach Urban Meyer's first trip to Neyland Stadium as Florida head coach was a suc­cess, and he made it two straight against the Vols. Not even Steve Spurrier, who was 8-4 against UT when he was at Florida, started 2-0 against the Vols as Gators coach. 
The No. 7 Gators (3-0, 1-0 Southeastern Conference) pre­served the victory when Heggie Nelson got his second intercep­tion of the game after Tennessee went for it on fourth down at the Florida 45. 
Then all the Gators needed was another first down, and they got it by inches on third down with 1:22 remaining. 
Meyer became the first Florida coach to beat Tennessee in his first two tries since Galen Hall. And Meyer joins Spurrier, Georgia's Mark Hicht and Tommy Tuberville as the only coaches to beat Tennessee's Phillip Fulmer in back-to-back seasons. The Gators won last year at The Swamp 16-7. 
Florida stuiTed the Volunteers' running game and pressured Erik Ainge all night, and not even an emotional final game by defensive tackle Justin Ilarrell could provide the lift Tennessee (2-1, 0-1) needed to beat its bitter rivals. 
Leak played in his final game in Neyland, where he ol'ten came to watch his older broth­er C.J. play, and managed the game well while his freshman backup Tim Tebow provided a lift all seven times he entered the game. Leak linisheci 15-of­25 for 199 yards with one interception. 
Tennessee was held to minus­11 yards rushing, and Aingc struggled in going 17 -of-32 for 183 yards. 
USC 28, Nebraska 10 
The Southnrn California Trojans have a new starting quarterback and six new run­ning baeks. 
But they look like the same old USC -with an even better defense than last year. 
If there was any doubt, No. 4 USC declared itself a national title contender for a fourth straight season with a victory over 19th-ranked Nebraska on Saturday night. 
"We're just getting going," USC coach Pete Carroll said. "We're just getting started. It's exciting." 
It's also scary for the rest of the country. The Trojans' attack isn't as potent as the one that lit up scoreboards last year. But their once-unreliable defense appears much stouter. The Trojans (2-0l limited Nebraska (2-1) to 211 yards, including 68 rushing yards on 36 carries, an average of 1. 9 yards per rush. 

"They were really good," Nebraska defensive tackle Barry Cryer said. "You just ean't deny that." 
USC won for the 36th time in 37 games, the lone defeat com­ing to Texas in the final sec­onds of last January's Rose Bowl. The Trojans have won 28 straight at home. 
Making his second career start, John David Booty was 25-for-36 for 257 with no inter­ceptions and three touchdown passes for USC in a Matt Leinart-esque performance. 
All-America receiver Dwayne Jarrett, the one holdover star from last year's record-break­ing offense, caught 11 passes for 136 yards, including two touchdowns. The 6-foot-5 Jarrett often found himself being covered by defensive backs who were four or more inches shorter. 
"Jarrett is a monster," Nebraska coach Bill Callahan said. "He physically dominated our guys. Our guys did what they could but he is almost unstoppable."

Indiana falls short in atte111pt to vvin ga111e for ailing coach 
Salukis down Hoosiers in emotional contest 
Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON -Indiana swore it was prepared to win one for its missing coach, Terry Hoeppner. Emotions weren't enough. 
What the Hoosiers learned Saturday was that it still comes down to execution. 
With a struggling ground game, an inconsistent offense and a poor run defense, Division I-AA Southern Illinois overpow­ered the Hoosiers 35-28, and now Indiana faces a defining week without their leader or the emotional victory they had hoped to give him. 
"We've got to learn from how we played today and playing through some adversity and all those kinds of things," interim coach Bill Lynch said. "We have to bounce back next week." 
Although the Hoosiers (2-1) insisted they were ready to play Saturday, the game told a differ­ent tale. 
There were mistakes, poor decisions, poor throws and lots of dropped passes. 
Lynch's postgame critique was simple: There's plenty of blame to go around, and nobody could pin it on the challenging week they endured. 
Instead, it came down to Southern Illinois' overpowering run game and Indiana's inability to keep the momentum after taking a quick 14-0 lead. When the Salukis challenged them in the second half, the Hoosiers never really responded, and when they had a chance to tie it up late, quarterback Kellen Lewis was sacked twice. 
It certainly wasn't the way Hoeppner or anyone else in the Hoosiers program drew it up. 
"We wanted to win this for coach Hep, and, obviously, we didn't get the job done," run­ning back Marcus Thigpen whispered. "Other than that, there were no distractions." 
The question now is where do the Hoosiers go from here? 
After an emotional week in which they lost Hoeppner and their best player, receiver James Hardy, for at least two games, Indiana must now make corrections quickly if they're going to put together a bowl run. 
Hoeppner had his second brain surgery in less than nine months Wednesday, and Hardy was suspended for two games Tuesday. 
Perhaps most disappointing was that the Hoosiers' bowl hopes took a huge hit. 
With three nonconference games against winnable oppo­nents, seven home games on the slate and only three games out­side of Indiana, all the Hoosiers seemingly needed to do was protect their home turf. Or, as Hoeppner would phrase it, "Defend the rock." 
Now they have to figure out how to beat Connecticut, a bud­ding Division I-A program that routed Indiana 34-10 in their last meeting in 2003, during what promises to be another emotional week. 
Hoeppner and Hardy will still be absent, and again there will be lots of questions about the quarterback situation after an inconsistent performance from Lewis, a redshirt freshman. 
"We had our chances, we really did, and we didn't take advantage when we had good field position" Lynch said. "We had a couple of big turnovers and eventually that comes back to hurt you in a close ballgame." 
As much as the Hoosiers played to win, there was little doubt Hoeppner was on their minds. 
Players repeatedly acknowl­edged they didn't let Hoeppner's absence become a distraction or an excuse, as Hoeppner insisted during a meeting in which he broke the news Tuesday. 
Before the game, a taped message from Hoeppner was played on the stadium's videoboard. One homemade sign read simply "Get well soon coach Hep." 
The Hoosiers responded by scoring on their first two pos­sessions before letting Southern Illinois back into the game with a 5-yard TD pass from Nick Hill to Braden Jones. 
In the second half, the Hoosiers didn't look like their early selves. 
After rebuilding a 21-7 lead, Hill found Ryan Kernes for a 7~ yard touchdown pass, and aftei! Lewis fumbled at the Hoosiers' 21, Hill hooked up with Alan Turner on an 8-yard TD pass to tie the score.

Addai filling the hole in Colts running gan1e 
Owens to miss 2-4 weeks 
Star wide receiver sidelined Sunday night with a broken finger 

Indianapolis tailback has over 100 total yards against Texans 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS-Indianapolis Colts running back Joseph Addai took a big step toward showing he's a suitable replacement for Edgerrin James -a 104-yard step. 
The rookie from LSU gained 104 total yards and scored his first NFL touchdown to help the Colts beat the Houston Texans 43-24 on Sunday. He gained 79 of his 82 rushing yards in the second half in relief of starter Dominic Rhodes. 
"I think I got into a rhythm with what I was doing," Addai said. "It was just important to get the feel of it and just to be in there for a long time. You have to take advantage of the situa­tion because you never know when you'll get another chance." 
Addai had a touchdown taken away in the second quarter when Houston challenged the call and it was determined that he fumbled into the end zone for a touchback. But the power run that carried would-be tacklers into the end zone left an impres­sion on his teammates. 
"Even with the fumble down there, golly, he's making an unbelievable effort to get into the end zone, and that's what hap­pens sometimes," quarterback Peyton Manning said. "The hard­er you try, something bad can happen. He'll learn from that, though." 
On a day when Marvin Harrison moved up to fifth place on the NFL's all-time receptions chart and Manning moved ahead of Johnny Unitas for first place on the Colts' completions list, Addai showed he's capable of becoming the newest triplet. The Colts' ability to run the ball was in doubt after James, the team's all-time leading rusher, signed with Arizona in the offseason. 

"Joe certainly showed some special things," Manning said. "He showed that great strength and power he has. That first guy was kind of bouncing off of him." 
"I thought Joseph and Dom ran well, but especially Joseph," coach Tony Dungy said. "We really don't think it's going to be an issue with our running backs." 
Addai's touchdown came on a 21-yard pass from Manning. 
"There was a blitz on that touchdown to him," Manning said. "Sometimes, more impor­tant than knowing when to block in blitz pickup is knowing when you don't have to block. His guy dropped and he was right out into his pass pattern and there­fore he was wide open, which shows he is really knowledgeable of his protection." 
The Colts gained 94 of their 125 rushing yards in the second half. Indianapolis led 20-3 at halftime and looked to prove it could grind out a drive a week after rushing for only 55 yards against the New York Giants. The Colts opened the second half with a 13-play, 82-yard drive that led to a 15-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Bryan Fletcher. Addai gained 41 yards on five carries on the possession. 
"We're not that overly worried about our running game," Dungy said. "When people give us looks to run, we think we're going to be able to run." 
Addai got the chance to get warmed up in the second half because Manning and the Indianapolis passing game estab­lished itself early. Manning threw for 400 yards and three touch­downs. 
Dungy said the Colts are doing a good job of putting Addai in position to succeed, and he's making the most of it. 
"He is very, very mature for a rookie," Dungy said. "He's going to be a good player for us. Dam's been great at helping him and getting him going. They're going to be a great one-two punch." 
Associated Press 
IRVING -Terrell Owens will miss from two to four weeks after breaking a finger Sunday night in the Dallas Cowboys' 27-10 victory over Washington. 
The controversial wide receiver broke his right ring finger and was scheduled to have surgery Monday. The Cowboys have a byP next week. 
Owens said he was hurt on the first or seeond play of the ganw, but didn't tell anybody that he was hurt until he was leaving the sideline for the locker room in the fourth quarter. lin said it was a "Huke thing" and occurred when he was blocking. 
"I think my hand got caught on a guy's jersey or something. I kind of felt something weird with it," Owens said. "I just kind of felt like I jammed it. I kept playing." 
Owens, who missed much of training camp and the presea­son because or a hamstring injury after signing a three­year, $25 million deal that ineludes a $5 million bonus and a $5 million salary in 2006, struggled against the Redskins. Owens flubbed a pass in the end zone on the opening drive -the first or three drops. By game's end, he was getting his hand X-rayed, his stats sealed at three catch­es for 19 yards. 
While Owens wasn't sure when he got hurt, he drew a personal foul penalty on the Cowboys' first offensive snap

of the game for an illegal block. 
On the dropped touchdown, Owens said he was trying to gather in the ball when cor­nerback Mike Humph knocked the ball away. 
"I didn't really have my full strength in my hand, so I think that probably may have con­tributed with him punching it out," Owens said. 
The X-rays revealed the break. llis right hand was par­tially wrapped after the game. 
"I feel like I'm a quick heal­er," Owens said. "Once we have the surgery, the healing process will start. ... I'm going to try to get back as soon as I can." 
After Owens felt a twinge in his hamstring the first week of training camp, he missed more than 20 workouts and the first three preseason games. Two MRis were clear, but Owens still flew in several doctors and trainers to California, plus a hyperbaric chamber, because he still didn't feel right. 
Last week, in a loss at Jacksonville, Owens played much better with six catches for 80 yards and a touchdown.

Grossman throws four TDs in Bears blowout 
Associated Press 
IRVING -While Terrell Owens botched his home debut with drops, penalties and then a broken finger that will sideline him for two to four weeks, Terry Glenn set up Dallas' first two touchdowns, then scored a third with a 40-yard catch in a 27-10 victory over Washington. 
Owens broke his right ring finger and will undergo surgery Monday. 
Drew Bledsoe threw for 237 yards and two touchdowns, with no interceptions, and would've had even better num­bers had his receivers not missed so many passes that hit their hands. Owens was among the most guilty, starting with a flubbed pass in the end zone on the opening drive. By game's end, he had three catches for 19 yards. 
Glenn caught six passes for 94 yards. He had a 34-yarder that set up a 4-yard touchdown p.ass to Patrick Crayton on Dallas' second drive and drew a 41-yard pass interference call against Kenny Wright to set up a 1-yard touchdown run by Marion Barber.

Colts 43, Texans 24 
Peyton Manning and the Colts played a near-perfect game. The Texans and David Carr looked like, well, their old selves. 
Manning threw three touch­down passes, broke one of John Unitas' franchise records, and the Colts scored on six of their first seven possessions. 
For Indy (2-0) -9-0 all-time against the Texans -it was another milestone day. 
Manning broke Unitas' fran­chise record for completions, Marvin Harrison moved into fifth place on the NFL's recep­tions list and Tony Dungy earned his 50th regular-season win as Colts coach. 
Manning's second TD pass, a 21-yarder to rookie Joseph Addai, gave him 2,797 comple­tions -one more than Unitas

had in his Colts career. Manning finished 26-of-38 for 400 yards, and had a 129.3 rating despite having one TD pass called back because of a holding penalty on Tarik Glenn. 
Harrison finished with seven receptions for 127 yards, and passed Art Monk for fifth on the career receptions list. lie now has 943 catches, two more than Monk's career total. 
Chargers 40, Titans 7 
LaDainian Tomlinson ran for two first-half touchdowns and Shawne Merriman led a defense that's starting to take this "Lights Out" thing seriously. 
Six days after blapking the Raiders, the Chargers came within 3:09 of consecutive shutouts for the first time in club history. Titans' No. 1 draft pick Vince Young threw an 18­yard touchdown pass to Drew Bennett to end the bid. 
Merriman, nicknamed "Lights Out" for his hard hits, was at it again against Tennessee (0-2). The linebacker intercepted a pass, batted away two others and San Diego (2-0) held the Titans to 218 total yards and 14 first downs, many of them late in the game. 
In last week's 27-0 win over the Raiders, Merriman had three of San Diego's nine sacks. 
Seahawks 21, Cardinals 10 
Seattle started with touch­downs by Shaun Alexander and Darrell Jackson on its first two drives before a strong pass rush and repeatedly blown opportu­nities by the bumbling Cardinals. 
Defending conference cham­pion Seattle is 2-0 for the third time in four seasons despite Pro Bowler Matt Hasselbeck throw­ing two interceptions and going just 12-for-27 for 221 yards_ his first game under 50 percent passing in two seasons. Alexander, last year's league MVP, ran for 89 yards on 26 carries, most of them late. 
The Seahawks also endured a blocked field goal, a 14-yard punt, and Arizona driving into their territory seven times. 
Patriots 24, Jets 17 
The student gave the teacher a scare, but Bill Belichick's Patriots held off a late rally by Eric Mangini's Jets. 

New England (2-0) took a 24­0 lead on touchdown runs by Corey Dillon and Laurence Maroney, and a TD catch by Chad Jackson. But the Jets stormed back in the second half. Jerricho Cotchery and Laveranues Coles each made brilliant touchdowns, Mike Nugent kicked a 42-yard field goal and Jonathan Vilma blocked a late field-goal attempt to give the Jets (1-1) one last chance in their home opener. 
But an interception by Tedy Bruschi ended the comeback hopes. 
Mangini was New England's defensive backs coach under Belichick from 2000-04, and served as defensive coordinator last season before becoming head coach of the Jets. Mangini, who said he hadn't spoken to Belichick in some time, talked about how much he learned while helping lead the Patriots to three Super Bowl titles. 
Bears 34, Lions 7 

Rex Grossman had his best game as a pro, and the Bears' defense silenced Detroit's Roy Williams and the Lions. 
Grossman set career highs with 289 yards and four touch­down passes to lead Chicago (2­0). The quarterback completed 20 of 27 passes with no inter­ceptions and set a career-high in yards for the second straight week after throwing for 262 in a season-opening win at Green Bay. 
A defense that handed the Packers' Brett Favre the first shutout of his career held the Lions to 245 yards and recov­ered three fumbles. Detroit (0­
2) committed 14 penalties for 104 yards, seven for 58 yards in the first quarter alone. 
Williams caught six passes for 71 yards after guaranteeing a win over the Bears. He was booed loudly after catching his first pass. 
Vikings 16, Panthers 13, OT 
Minnesota wanted a sea­soned, reliable kicker when they signed Ryan Longwell away from rival Green Bay this spring. Who knew he could play quarterback, too? 
Longwell's 16-yard TD pass to Richard Owens on a fake kick tied the game in the fourth quarter, and his third field goal -from 19 yards with 7:25 left in overtime -lifted the Vikings. 
Brad Johnson threw a falling­down, 30-yard pass to Troy Williamson, who caught it one­handed, and Chester Taylor ripped off a 33-yard run on the final drive. 
Taylor carried 24 times for 113 yards, and Williamson had six catches for 102 yards, all after halftime. 
Carolina (0-2) had been a popular Super Bowl pick, but the Panthers are struggling in several areas, including staying healthy. All-Pro Steve Smith ­who totaled 201 yards receiving against the Vikings last season -sat out again because of a strained hamstring. 
Giants 30, Eagles 24 OT 
Eli Manning brought the Giants back from a 17-point deficit in the fourth-quarter and threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to Plaxico Burress with 3:1lleft in overtime. 
On third-and-11 from the Eagles 31, Manning avoided a blitz and lofted a pass to Burress, who outjumped Sheldon Brown to make the catch and get in the end zone. 
Dominated through the first three quarters, the Giants (1-1) fought back and tied it on Jay Feely's 35-yard field goal with 7 seconds left. 
Manning overcame eight sacks and constant pressure to throw for 371 yards and three. TDs. He tossed a 22-yard TD pass to Amani Toomer with 
3:28 left in regulation to cut the deficit to 24-21. 
The Eagles (1-1) lost their seventh straight to an NFC East rival. Donovan McNabb passed for 350 yards and two TDs. 
Falcons 14, Buccaneers 3 
Led by Michael Vick and Warrick Dunn, Atlanta took its running game to a whole new level. And the defense fared just fine without John Abraham. 
Dunn ran for 134 yards against his former team, Vick added to one of his own NFL records with 127 yards rushing and the Falcons set a franchise record with 306 yards on the ground. 
Atlanta (2-0) has yet to allow a touchdown this season, keep­ing its streak alive when Jason Webster and DeAngelo Hall picked off passes in or near the end zone. 
Chris Simms had another mis­erable day for the Buccaneers (0-2), who have yet to score a touchdown in 2006. He was picked off three times by the Falcons, matching what he did in a 27-0 loss to Baltimore in the season opener. 
Bengals 34, Browns 17 
Chad Johnson made a toe­tapping catch in the corner of the end zone, popped up and flapped his elbows in a "Chicken Dance" celebration. Then, he shuffled to the bench in pain. 
It was that kind of a day for Cincinnati, which won despite losing three starters to injury ­a troubling turn for the defend­ing AFC North champs. 
Even with their patchwork lineup, the Bengals (2-0) had their way against the Browns (0-2), who again struggled mightily to move the ball. 
Operating behind a makeshift line, Carson Palmer threw for 352 yards and his first two touchdowns of the season. Chris Henry, who pleaded guilty to a gun charge five days earlier, led the way with five catches for 113 yards. And Rudi Johnson 
ran  for  145 yards and  two  
touchdowns.  
Receiver  T.J.  

Houshmandzadeh and left tack­le Levi Jones were inactive with lingering injuries. During the first half, the Bengals lost cen­ter Rich Braham to a knee injury, safety Dexter Jackson to an ankle injury, and linebacker David Pollack, who was taken to a hospital for evaluation of a neck injury. Pollack had full m~wement in his arms and legs. 
Saints 34, Packers 27 
Drew Brees overcame three early turnovers by throwing for 353 yards, and New Orleans (2­
0) is heading home unbeaten. 
They will play their first game in New Orleans since 2004 next Monday night against Atlanta. The Saints, of course, spent last season without a home after Hurricane Katrina ravaged their city and the Louisiana Superdome. 
With the game tied at 20, Brees threw a 35-yard touch­down pass to .Marques Colston for a 27-20 edge with 8:20 remaining. 
Brees completed 26 of 41 passes, throwing for two TDs and an interception for the Saints. The Packers (0-2) con­tained rookie running back Reggie Bush, but Deuce McAllister scored twice.

Michelle Daly's controversial goal with 19 seconds remain­ing in the second overtime Sunday gave North Central a 2-1 victory over Saint Mary's and concluded the Sal Vaccaro Invitational in Naperville, Ill. 
Daly seemed to be offsides, but the referee did not stop play and with a head start Daly was able to break away from the pack of defenders and beat goaltender Laura Heline. 
The winning goal was Daly's second of the game -the first came 13 minutes into the match as she beat a Belles' defender and chipped a shot over Reline's head. The Cardinals' star player had four goals in her two games during the tournament, helping North Central capture its third con­secutive Vaccaro Invitational championship. 

"It was difficult to lose on a goal that should have been called back because the player was offsides ... but we put up a solid fight throughout the game," senior Caroline Stancukas said. "I can honest­ly say that there is not one person who stepped on the field who did not player her heart out." 
Saint Mary's made the game interesting when Stancukas headed a crossing pass in for the Belles in the 71st minute. The speedy senior made a div­ing leap and connected with freshman defender Bridget Roynane's feed on a free kick from just outside the box. 
The goal was Stancukas's first of her career. The senior has played consistently over the past four years and con­tributed many assists, but had not put one between the pipes prior to Sunday's game.

Saint Mary's looked to be in charge throughout the contest, playing with a higher intensity and efficiency than the Mustangs. 
"We played with great ener­gy, were first to 50/50 balls, anticipated runs, strung quick passes together, and found the back of the net. We were the stronger team and the Hintons had a field day with the goal­keeper," Stancukas said. 
Senior captain Ashley Hinton had a hat trick to lead the Belles to victory. She opened up the scoring in the . middle of the first half with a pass from Samantha Goudreau. She later added two more unassisted goals within four minutes of each other in the second half. Sophomore Lauren Hinton also added a goal -her third of the season -late in the game. 
Saint Mary's outshot the Mustangs 21-4. Keri Ludwig scored the lone goal for Mount Mercy, but it was a meaning­less goal with only eight min­utes remaining in the contest.

Coach sees potential despite poor· shovving

Sports Writer 

The Belles finished in 18th place at the IWU Fall Classic Tournament in Normal, Ill. while turning in a team score of 696 (120-over par) this week­end. 
The team shot a 347 the first day and a 349 on the second day of the tournament. 
Co-captain Alex Sei said hard winds contributed to the Belles' struggles, and although coach Mark Hamilton was "disappoint­ed" with the finish, he said he saw signs of improvement. 
"We showed some definite signs of improvement," he said. "If we continue to work on our short game we should lower our scores dramatically. " 
DePauw captured first place by shooting 56-over par for a combined squad total of 632 (311, 321). Wisconsin-Eau Claire trailed by one stroke to finish in second place in the two-round, 72-par tournament. 
Junior captain Katie O'Brien led the Belles in scoring with an 86 on day one and an 82 on day two for a combined total of 168 (24-over par) to finish 43rd in a field of 134 golfers. 
Kate Doornbos, the only fresh­man competing for the Belles in the tournament said she only felt "some pressure" to prove herself on the team. 
''I'm more excited than any­thing," she said. "I just try my best." 
Doornbos finished with the second lowest score on the squad (174) by shooting 30-over par to finish 64th. Meredith Fantom and Katie Mcinerney both shot 180s to fmish 84 and 85, respectively and Alex Sei shot a 182 (95, 87) placing 89th. 
The tournament's individual winner, Katie Tewell from Franklin College, shot just 4 strokes over par and had a total score of148 (74, 74). 
The Belles will have a chance to show their improvement when they play the Comet Classic hosted by Olivet College Sept. 22-23.

and I think we let the tough condi­tions get to us a little." 
After a difficult first round Saturday in which the team carded a 313, the Irish bounced back to fire an impressive 295 later in the day. 
"After the second round, we were right [in contention]," Isban said. 
The squad headed into Sunday in seventh place and stayed in that slot until the 13th hole. The Irish were overtaken by both Northwestern and Ohio State in the last six·holes of play. 
"I was very disappointed, espe­cially because we had a chance to finish where we wanted to," Irish coach"Jim Kubinski said. 
On the last hole, four of the five Irish golfers recorded bogeys to cap off the poor finish. As a result, the team finished three shots behind Northwestern and two worse than Ohio State. 
The windy conditions were large­ly to blame for the dearth of individ­ual scores that exceeded par. Notre Dame's top two golfers, Isban and sophomore Josh Sandman, each finished with an 11-over par 227 and ended up in a four-way tie for 19th place. The other three players, senior Adam Gifford, junior Mike King, and freshman Doug Fortner each struggled at points throughout the tournament.

1984. The only other previous repeat winner was Notre Dame's JoAnna Deeter, who won the event all four years she ran it. 
Chasing Olding at the finish were three runners from Marquette, finishing over 12 seconds after Olding had crossed the line. The three Golden Eagles were followed by three Irish runners -junior Julie Opet (18:17), freshman Lindsey Ferguson (18:17) and sophomore Heidi Rocha (18:42). Sophomore Becca Bauman rounded out the Irish points qualifiers with a total time of 18:58. 
Rocha's finish was especially crucial as she held off advances from Duquesne's Amy Ruffolo (18:43) and Marquette's Amanda Beggs (18:44) down the stretch to secure the first place tie for Notre Dame. 
Women's coach Tim Connelly was glad his team won the race, but knew there was still a lot of room for improvement as Notre Dame will play host again in two weeks, but this time to many top-25 teams in the Notre Dame Invitational. 
"This will give them a lot of confidence going into the tough races coming up," Connelly said. "We do have a lot of room to get better. I don't think we closed particularly well, but now we've got some confidence to build on." 
One reason Connelly knows his team has so much room to improve is that he saved his best runners for the important races later in the season when they will be needed to beat top­ranked opponents. 
On the men's side, coach Joe Piane also held out his top two runners, senior Kurt Benninger and sophomore Patrick Smyth, but the Irish could not be 
Although a Notre Dame run­ner did not win the individual race -that honor was given to John Riak from St. Martin's College, who finished the 8K race in 24:38 -they did have the best team Friday. 
Junior Jake Watson led Notre Dame with a strong-second­place finish, chasing Riak down the stretch but falling to him by only two seconds. 
"I ran hard and gave it every­thing I had," Watson said of his tough finish. "I ~ad tried to break him early but he was able to hold on to me." 
Junior Brett Adams (25:18) and junior Mike Popejoy 
(25:20) finished eighth and 
ninth overall. Freshman Jake Walker 
(25:39) and sophomore Robbie Baranay (25:57) rounded out Notre Dame's top 5. 
Adams and Popejoy were the only Irish runners to follow Piane's gameplan and stay in a tight pack, a technique that won Notre Dame the Crusader Invitational, said Piane. 
"Honestly, we had a few freshmen in the race and they ran like freshmen," Piane said. "One thing they need to realize about the difference between college and high school cross country is that this is all about the team, not individual per­forman~es." 
Notre Dame will also reinsert its top runners in two weeks at the Notre Dame Invitational, with Benninger and Smyth returning to the race lineup. 
"When we slip in those two fellows we will eliminate 25 points from our total," Piane said. "We add in a 3:58 miler in Benninger and Smyth who can run 5000 meters in 4:10. 
"With those two guys and two more weeks of practice we can only get better."

Freshman Megan Fest con­tributed 10 kills and 14 digs in the Irish win. 
Notre Dame 3, Duke 1 

The Irish beat the Blue Devils in four games -30-27, 19-30, 30-24 and 30-25 -to take two matches in a row for their first consecutive wins since a three­game run to open the season. 
Stasiuk once again led the team in kills with 14 on 31 attacks -a .387 success rate -and added nine digs on defense. Fest broke Herndon's consecutive team-leading dig mark when she tallied 20 against the Blue Devils. 
"I thought Megan Fest had a pretty good weekend," Brown said. "She had a really good match against Duke. Her hit­ting numbers may not have been real impressive, but she had 20 digs and was playing really steady all around." 
Notre Dame and Duke both finished with 63 kills apiece, but the Irish emerged with a .242 successful attack percent­age to the Blue Devils' .220 mark. The Irish also out-dug their opponent with a tally of 59-58. 
Notre Dame rallied from a second set loss to take consecu­tive games while hitting .342. The third game wen' Notre Dame's way after the team opened up on an 11-4 run to overcome a one-point Duke lead. Sophomore Mallorie Croal gave the Irish a 2-1 lead with a kill.

to be a battle," he said. "That's what happens when you have the No.1 target on your back." 
The two teams played an even first half Sunday, with Michigan having the. best chance to score on a shot by junior forward Melissa Dobbyn which sailed just wide of the net. 
In the second half, Notre Dame shook off the cobwebs and found the back of the net in the 57th minute. Freshman for­ward Michele Weissenhofer took a pass from junior Susan Pinnick and beat Wolverine keeper Madison Gates. 
Gates was in the game after an early injury to regular starter senior Megan Tuura. 
The Irish struck again in the 84th minute with a goal by jun­ior forward Amanda Cinalli. Cinalli redirected a cross from Weissenhofer, giving the fresh­man her NCAA-leading lOth assist of the year. 
Waldrum said he was glad his team woke up in time to get the victory. 
"We came on the road and got a win, so I can't complain too much," he said. 
Notre Dame 5, DePaul 0 

Waldrum said Friday' per­formance against the Blue Demons in Notre Dame's first Big East conference game of the year was one of the most com­plete Irish wins of the season. 
"DePaul was probably the first game that we've put together 70-80 good minutes," he said.

gained an early 12-6 lead and never relinquished it. 
The Irish took the opening game in the match on a Blue Devil attack error, after it had been deadlocked at 22-22. Duke, however, took the second game with a 19-9 run after the two teams were tied at 11. 
Arizona State 3 Notre Dame 0 

The Sun Devils (8-3) defeated the Irish 30-20, 30-20, 30-28 to take the Classic title and equal their win total from the 2005 season. 
The Irish fought the sweep in the third game, as the two teams exchanged several leads and were tied five different times -mostly after both squads had eclipsed the 20­point mark. The Sun Devils prevailed. however, and took the game in which neither team led by more than three points. 
"I think the main thing was that we just had breakdown in serving and passing," Brown said. "That's just the funda­mentals -everything stems off of that." 
Arizona State took an early lead in the first game and held on as the team never trailed on the way to a 1-0 lead. The sec­ond stanza was more of the same, as the Sun Devils only gave up their lead once and took a 2-0 advantage on an identical score. 
Freshman kills-leader Christina Kaelin missed the match due to a migraine, which Brown said, "was unfortunate, we didn't have any depth because of that."

The Irish spent one practice inside the Loftus Center this week to get ready for the artifi­cial surface 
"We played pretty well with [the surface]," Waldrum said. "It didn't seem to have too big of an effect. The field wasn't too much of a problem." 
Notre Dame first got on the scoreboard with a goal by soph­omore Brittany Bock, her sec­ond since returning to action last week. Bock, along with sophomore defender Carrie Dew, had been playing for Team USA in the U-20 World Championships in Russia. 
The teams went into the lock­er room with the score 1-0, but the Irish exploded with four goals in the second half -two by Weissenhofer, one by sopho­more forward Kerri Hanks and one by senior midfielder Lizzie Reed. 
Notes: 

+After the Notre Dame foot­ball team's loss to Michigan on Saturday, Waldrum said he was anticipating a very hostile reception in Ann Arbor. While Sunday afternoon's crowd was relatively mild, Waldrum said he and the team were not greeted warmly when they arrived in town Saturday night. 
"We went to TGI Friday's [in Ann Arbor Saturday] night," Waldrum said. "When we got to the restaurant there were some people [who] had some not-so­nice things to say about Notre Dame."

Arizona State swept the Irish 3-0 in the Classic's final game to take the tournament cham­pionship and give Notre Dame a 2-1 record -one weekend after the team finished 1-2 in the University of Northern Iowa Invitational. 
"I felt we played pretty well against both Butler and Duke," Brown said. "Our serving and passing .were really good -we had a

Notre Dame 3, Butler 0 
Notre Dame swept Butler by scores of 30-23, 30-19 and 30-21 on game-ending kills by Serinity Phillips, Stremick and Stasiuk. 
In addition to the match­ender, Stasiuk recorded 13 kills and 13 digs on the match -the sixth time this year the junior has reached double digits in both categories at the same time and the 30th time of her career. 
Libero Danielle llerndon led the Irish for the ninth straight game with 21 digs -the third longest dig streak in Notre Dame history. Junior Ashley Tarutis led both squads in assists with 31. 
The Irish gained a 25-16 lead in the third game ol'f a kill from freshman Kim Kristoff and had a .400 attack percentage on the game before Stasiuk finished the Bulldogs. 
The first game was won on back-to-back kills by Phillips to cap an 8-3 run. Butler had cut the lead to 22-20 before the Irish were abl~ to close it out. 
In the second stanza, Notre Dame got out to an early 7-2 lead and never relinquished it. 
Stremick ended the game ­in which the Bulldogs could not cut the Irish lead closer

Despite chances, it wasn't until the 83rd minute that Notre Dame would find that elusive second goal. Similarly to his first goal, Lapira got behind his defender where he proceeded to take a through pass from freshman Justin Morrow and tuck the ball away into the corner of the Cardinal net. 
Cahill, playing in front of family friends in his hometown of Louisville, got the start in goal for the Irish. He recorded four saves on the night while earning the shutout, his second of the season and tenth of his Irish career. Notre Dame now stands at 3-1-0 this season when Cahill mans the net. 
"We wanted to give Chris a start in his hometown, and he certainly looked up to all expectations from family and friends," Clark said. "He made two key saves and played exceptionally well."

Men's, women's teams take first in National Catholic Championships at Burke Course 
By JAY FITZPATRICK 
Sporrs Writer 

Home course advantage came in handy for Notre Dame Friday in the National Catholic Championships as the Irish swept both the men's and women's events. 
For the No. 12 Irish men, it was their second win in as many tries this season while the Notre Dame women were able to build on a disappointing second-place finish in the Crusader Invitational last week with a tie for first with No. 18 Marquette at 28 points a piece. 
The women competed first and Notre Dame led most of the way with a strong pack near the front of the race. This group was led by eventual race champi­on Sunni Olding. The Irish junior com­pleted the 5K race in only 17:51. 
''I'm glad I was able to lead the team to a strong finish this week," Olding said. "I just ran hard and was able to hold off any moves anyone tried to make on me." 
Olding became only the second woman to win the National Catholic Championship two years in a row since women began racing in the event in

ND has not won back­to-back games in the same weekend this year 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sporrs Writer 
If there's one thing Notre Dame has been consistent with this season, it's been its incon­sistency. 
For the fourth consecutive week Notre Dame failed to win two games in a weekend. 
After Notre Dame dispatched of Louisville 2-0 on Friday night, it was Cincinnati who ruined an Irish bid for a perfect weekend as the Bearcats rallied for a 2-1 victory Sunday afternoon at Gettler Stadium. 
"After finally getting the Friday monkey off our back, we went out and lost on Sunday," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. "When you play two games on the road and win one and lose one, it's not the end of the work, but it would have been nice to win both of them." 

The Irish had an optimal start to the game as senior forward Justin McGeeney opened the scoring in only the 12th minute with his fourth goal of the sea­son. Midfielder Nate Norman started the play as he beat his defender inside the 18-yard box and unleashed a shot. Bearcat keeper Mike Vessells made the save, but McGeeney was there to tap in the rebound from close range. 
It wasn't until after halftime that Cincinnati found an equal­izer. Bearcat mid fielder Mike Dwyer beat his defender to the end line where he centered the ball around the penalty spot. His cross found an unmarked Kenny Anaba, who fired the ball into the goal on his first touch. 
Anaba also played a part in Cincinnati's second goal as he managed to get his head on a Patrick Baxter cross. Anaba's flick floated perfectly into the path of Noah Davidson, who headed home and put the game

No. 1 Notre Dame (8-0) was not at its best this weekend. but managed to win road con­tests 5-0 over DePaul Friday and 2-0 over Michigan Sunday. 
Irish coach Handy Waldrum said he was happy with the squad's effort against the Blue Demons, but he said the team was "lethargic" against the Wolverines. 
"Michigan played hard and was very organized, but we weren't real sharp," he said. 
Waldrum said he hoped his team, which has not allowed a goal since Sept. 3 against Santa Clara, learned a lesson from the relatively sub-par perform­ance against the Wolverines.
