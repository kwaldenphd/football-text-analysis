Price announces lottery procedure 
by Michael Lewis News Editor 
Edmund Price, director of Hous­

-ing, yesterday released an official off-campus housing lottery proce­dure which calls for an early contract deadline and .a substantial fine for students who do not fulfill the contract. The housing office will not be able to determine whether a lottery is necessary until the number of students-who wish to live on campus next year can be deter­mined. To obtain an accurate count, housing contracts will be distri­buted Jan. 18 and must be returned to the housing office by Feb. 2. The contract deadline has been April 15 in recent years. Students who do not return con­tracts by Feb. 2 will be denied on campus housing. . If a lottery is necessary, a list of the seniors who have returned residence hall contracts will be submitted to the Computer Center for random sorting by name. On 
March 9, a list will be published showing the order in which seniors will be assigned housing, and a cutoff line will be established to distinguish those seniors who must move off-campus. 
The procedure establishes a $250 fine for students who turn in a contract but later move off-campus. Price said the fine was created "to make sure those people who turn in a contract are serious about living on campus." He explained that, in past years. students have turned in contracts "while actively searching for a place off-campus.'' 
"We tried to eliminate that so we could get an accurate count," he stated. 
Under this procedure, any student who decides to move off-campus after Feb. 2 will be fined $300, including the $50 room deposit. Thus it is possible that students who move off-campus to join a senior who had to move due to the lottery will be subject to the fine. 
Price said that there may be "special considerations" given for "extenuating circumstances," but added that the procedure "has to don't believe a lottey is the last us," he continued.

ThOusands try to flee Iran 
TEHRAN, Iran [AP]-Foreigners and Iranians alike stampeded for flights out of Iran yesterday. Reports circulated that opponents of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi were preparing a bloody showdown with government troops this week­end. 
In Washington, President Carter said he does not know whether the Shah could survive the upheavals, but the United States would not intervene. He said Iran was "very important" to the United States and the stability of the Persian Gulf, Israel and the entire Medi· terranean. 
Officials at Tehran's Mehrebad Airport reported "utter chaos." Thousands of persons scrambled for plane tickets after airlines announced they cancelled flights in and out of the city Sunday and Monday, the critical days of the month-long holy season. 
Large groups of U.S. dependents arrived in Tehran from turbulent -provincial areas as major American companies such as Genera!Eiectric, Westinghouse, Fluor Corp. and others evacuated their familie.s. At least two U.S. companies chartered planes for employees' families when airlines reported their flights 
were filled. 
"We want to get out," said Mr!i. Betty Robinson, wife of an Ameri­can aircraft executive based in Isfahan. "But we're stuck here because all-the planes are over­booked. We'll just have to sit it out here." 
"Our people think things are going to get bad,'' said her husband, Walter. 
Troops kept hundreds of persons out of Tehran:s airport as pande­monium broke out inside when people shoved and yelled in the fight for plane seats.

BRING YOUR FRIENDS 
by Mark Perry Staff Reporter 
Dean of Students JameSt Roemer indicated that students might have some voice in the handling of parietal offenses if they could show some responsibility in other deci­sions regarding hall offenses. 
Roemer commented on the pari­etals proposal and other University issues in a forum before about SO students in t.he Flanner Hall pit last night. 
"If a lot of students were taking the responsibility and made some tough actions," Roemer com­mented, "I think that the Univer­sity would likely say on this parietals issue, 'O.K., we'll be glad to share concurrent responsibility on that.· And I would be all for it mvself. '' 
Roemer went on to say that the first time the parietals issue was discussed was at the students' rights forum in October, and that the general opinion of students at that time was that parietals should be abolished. 
''Then when the proposition came through on concurrent jurisdic­tion," Roemer continued, "there were a lot of people like myself who thought that this was just the first step in an attempt to kill pari­etals. '' 
"If there had been a bona fide demonstration over a period of time," Roemer added, "and we could have been convinced that you were trying to share responsibility on the parietals, I think that the Administration would have been delighted." 
Roemer was optimistic about the future of the parietalsproposal. "I think it's going to happen if the J-boards continue to handle hall offense cases well. If that's the case, I would love to give you concurrent responsibility." 
He added that he thought the final decision on this issue would have to occur over an extended period of time, "maybe over a matter of vears. I would have to be convinced that in the 21 residence halls there is a significant amount that are handling offenses in the right way. and demonstrate they are responsible in making tough decisions." 
In regards to parietals in general, Roemer said that he viewed pari­etals and sexuality on different grounds. ''I see parietals as a privacy kind of issue. a noise kind of issue. There are some good common sense reasons for pari­etals." 
Roemer also made some com­ments on the housing situation, saying that he didn't think that the lottery was the only solution right now, "But the administration has to be careful before they make any decisions about spending your 
ND professors comment on anti-inflation pro·gram 
by Tom J~kman St_aff Reporter 
With consumers across the nation clamoring for an end to raging inflation, President Jimmv Carter pr~ented Phase II of his a~ti-infla­tion program last month, voluntary guidelines asking that wages in­crease no more than seven percent and prices no more than nine and one-half percent. Additionally, Carter took emergency measures to shore up the rapidly falling dollar by increasing to $30 million the 
amount  of  strong  currencies  in  
reserve  to be  used in  buying up  
dollars.  

Around the country, reactions to Phase II were mixed, and at Notre Dame, the feeling was unanimous among professors surveyed that Carter's plan would meet with money, and see what kind of housing problem there is, if any." 
In regards to off-campus housing, Roemer said that he had no knowledge of a Notre Dame rule regarding co-habitation off. campus. He also added that he could see many reasons (security, etc.) for this arrangement. and that it would probably not be discour aged. 
Roemer also said that he has bt'en meeting with security and 0rher organizations involved in nne!'­gencies to discuss procedt:I'C in regards to a situation wr•:re a person must be taken ~~· the hospital. 
"If there is any questiol tioat there should be an ambulance. on~ will be called immediatelv." he said. · 
failure.  Most felt that mandatory  
controls  were  inevitable,  if  un­ 
wanted.  

Carter's guidelines asked that in labor contracts negotiated over the next year. increases in wages and fringe benefits should not exceed seven percent. Carter added a new idea here, a wage insurance plan for workers who settled for a seven percent or less increase. They would receive a tax rebate if inflation exceeded seven percent. 
The voluntary plan also requested that average price hikes for all products to be held to one-half percent below increases made in the previous two years. and that no company raise prices by more than nine and one-half percent, with certain exceptions. 
To enforce these guidelines, Car­ter has enlisted Alfred Kahn, (continued on page 8].

The foUowing procedure for the possible off-campus housing lottery was released yesterday by the Housing Office. 
1. 
On January 18, at the same time that next year's sophomores and juniors receive Residence Hall Contracts, next year's seniors will also be sent a contract that will be valid if sufficient spaces are avail­able. Overseas students will be included on an equal basis with other students.

There are some stipulating points. All students MUST return the signed (only) contract to the Hous­ing Office by February 2, 1979. Those students indicating off cam­pus preference will be crossed off the list. Those students not returning the contract by February 2 will be excluded-no exceptions. Those students whose names do not appear on the Student Accounts listing as pre-registered for the Fall Semester will also be excluded.

of the procedure at one stage or another, Price said, adding that some .of the ideas were formulated last summer. The procedure has been in the writing stages for about a month. 
The Housing Office projects a $150 raise in room and board fees 10r next year. The current median rate is $1360 for men, $1285 for women.

Roohan said that the Student Government is aware of the pos­sible problems associated with the $250 fine and the early deadlines, and that SG expressed t:oncern about it at the meeting. 
Cotton Bowl tickets abound 
by Paul Stauder 
Cotton Bowl football tickets, 
which were scarce last year, will be 
in abundance this year. according 
to Ticket Manager Mike Busick. 
This year's allotment provided by 
Cotton Bowl officials exceeds last 
year's by 1200 tickets. The 
recently completed student sale 
and the upcoming alumni and 
faculty sale indicate there may be a 
surplus of tickets due to lack of 
sales. 
Last year. students complained 
about the ticket allotment, and the 
allocation was increased this year 
from 2200 to 2700 tickets. The total 
number given to Notre Dame this 
year is 13,200 tickets which will be 
distributed among the alumni, 
administration. and students. At 
the recently completed student 
sale, 704 tickets were bought by 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's 
students for their personal use. 
Busick attributed the sharp drop­
off in sales to the lesser stature of 
the game and to the fact that the 
seniors have already spent much of 
their money on the Los Angeles 
trip. 
Busick added that freshman stu­
dents bought the largest amount of 
tickets. "response in general is 
down considerably from last year." 
Busick said, ''and the USC trip had 
a bearing on many decisions.'' 
The faculty and staff received 
their ticket applications Nov. 28, 
along with any alumni who contri· 
buted in the calendar year of 1977. 
The unsold student tickets will be 
added to the total alumni alloca­
tion. Any tickets unsold to the 
alumni and staff will then go on 
public sale "probably Tuesday," 
according to Busick. 
The ramifications of this year's situation, according to Busick, include possible cuts in future allocations by the Cotton Bowl Committee. "They (the commit­tee) would have a hard time justifying giving Notre the same number of tickets if we'd go there next year," he said. "More than likely we'll return tickets to the Cotton Bowl." 
The Cotton Bowl game is sche­duled for New Year's Day in Dallas. 
Buddy replaces Powley as St. Mary's Editor 
Ellen Buddy, a junior elementary education major from Dodge City, Kansas, bas been named Saint Mary's Editor effective next sem­ester. She will be replacing Jean Powley who is graduating this month. 
Powley has been Saint Mary's Editor since March, 1977. Buddy has acted as Assistant Saint Mary's Editor since September. 

Renovation of La Fortune " to continue over vacation 
by Cathy Santoro 
Renovation of the La Fortune Student Center will continue over the semester break. According to Student Body President Andy Mc­Kenna, most of the changes should be completed by the time students return in January. 
The Huddle and ice cream service areas are expected to completely reorganized. All of the food service machines will be replaced with new equipment, including pizza ovens. The Huddle will be changed in to . a more compressed, fast-food operation. 
The ice cream section will expan­ded to include an ice cream parlor with seating accomodations. The former dining area will be turned into a country store with a delica­tessen counter offering meats, cheeses and carry-out sandwiches. 
Structural changes in La Fortune were made last summer in prepara­tion for developing a food counter in the Rathskellar. A dumbwaiter between the Huddle and basement will make it possible to operate the 
proposed service kitchen. 
Bro. Kieran Ryan, assistant vice­president of Business Affairs and d~ector of the renovation plans, sa1d, ''The food service in the basement will be more or less an extension of the Huddle as far as the menu is concerned. It will however, offer students a large; food selection in the evening, including pizza.'' 
I 
' Whether or not the food counter in the basement becomes a reality

summer and took more time and money than was expected.'' 
Since the food counter is expect­ed to be profitable, McKenna would like to see the remainder or renovation money or funds from student activity fees used towards the proposed food counter. 
Funds for the entire remodeling project were given by the La Fortune family in memory of Joseph La Fortune, a Notre Dame alumnus. Of the $350,000 that was donated, a large portion, around $100,000, is tentatively earmarked for. 
McKenna doubted the value of an elevator in La Fortune. "It won't necessarily add to the value of the Student Center. We'd be spending around $100,000 on just an elevator. I'd rather' see the money used for a better cause in the renovation plans,'' he said. 
Ryan explained the issue of whether to install an elevator is 

. complicated by a federal law re­quiring all public service buildings to provide for some kind of access for the handicapped. 
Thousands try to flee Iran 
[continued from page 1 ]. An estimated 8,000 foreigners, including 5,,500 Americans, have fled in the last ten weeks. Thousands of nervous Iranians, fearful after eleven months of political turmoil, also have fled, diplomatic sources said. Anti-shah forces maintained strong economic pressure on the government with wildcat walkouts, slowdowns and a crippling four­day-old stoppage in~Iran's south­western oilfields. Well-placed sources reported that daily oil production Thursday slipped to around 2.6 million barrels -well below half the normal daily output of 6 million barrels, costing the · treasury about $35 million a day; The pa~;:e : of the exodus has swelled in ·recent days because of fears that trouble is looming Dec. 10 and 11, the climax of the holy Moslem month of Moharran when religious passions run high and the faithful march·in the streets or beat themselves with whips.

Students,faculty favor stopping-out 
Editor's Note: This is the second of a two-part series on the "stopping· out syndrome." Today's article deals with Administration and student views on stopping-out. 
by Mike Shields Staff Reporter 
"Stopping-out"--the temporary interruption of the educational process because of career in­decision, financial difficulty, moti­vational problems, or other rea­sons--has established itself as a permanent institution in America. 
Reactions to stopping-out are almost unanimously favorable on College of Arts and Letters, ap­proves of stopping-out because "it gives students with motivational or financial problems the opportunity to stop out for a semester of a year and reenter_ school without dif­ficulty. Students do not have to withdraw.'' 
the  part  of  both  Notre  Dame  
students and faculty.  
Isabel  Charles,  dean  of  the  

The subject of withdrawal from school is central to the issue of stopping-out. Before the present leave of absence policy was adop­ted at Notre Dame, students who withdrew from school were re­quired to apply for readmission. Under the new policy, students do not go through the readmission process. 
''Stopping-out is a good op­portunity for some students to reassess what they are doing," Charles said, noting that most students return to school. 
Most leaves of absence are short in duration, Charles noted. "We require a period of a semester or one year, although it can be lengthened with the permission of the dean. There is also a statute of limitations of five years,'' she explained. · 
The statute of limitations means that credit earned five years before a student returns to Notre Dame is not applicable toward degree re­quirements. "If a student has a good reason for a leave of absence, his request is always approved,'' Charles said. 
•'I think it is a good idea, but it is not common for Notre Dame students. Most are expected to go to college by their families, so it is the first thing they try," Charles said. 
A possible difficulty a returning 

OH! You said 7-UP didn't you? [Photo by Mark Ricca]. student :night encounter is the age 
disparity between him and his 
classmates, Charles noted. "It is 
the nature of school that most 
students are in the same age 
bracket," she said, calling this 
arrangement "More comfortable." Charles said she sometimes re­commends stopping-out to students. "If a student is having difficulty academically or sociaJJy, and I see the student does not want , to be in school, I recommend a 
leave," she said. "It's not amatter 
of potential; there is something 
wrong." 
''Most students are ready to take 
on the responsibility of a coJJege 
education. They know what they 
want to do. If not, it's good to stop 
out," she added. 
Vincent R. Raymond, associate 
dean of the College of Business 
Administration, was also in favor of 
the opportunity for a student to 
stop out. He noted that the former 
readmittance problem kept some 
potential stop-outs in school. 
"There was a 99.5 percent 
chance for readmission,'' Raymond 
said, ''but there was always that .5 
percent to be considered.'' That .5 
percent made students ''gunshy, 
hesitant," Raymond said, although 
he never had a student in good 
standing reapply and not be re­
admitted. 
Raymond observed that the rea­
sons usually give in requesting a 
leave include health, financial wor­
ries, and motivational problems, 
with financial problems foremost. 
Normally five business students a 
year request leaves, he added. 
''Students are so concerned with a 
job," Raymond said. " 'Who am 
I?' and 'Where am I?' are the 
questions in the background. Some 
students reflect that they are not 
getting a return in dollars and time, 
so they need a different environ­
ment." Raymond called the leave 
· of absence policy ''a good thing to have" in order to give students more flexible options. more flexible options. He presented a hypothetical case of a se~;ond-year MBA student, 23­years-old, who has spent 18 years of his life in school. "This student peters out, bums out, and may not 
go  on  to  further  study,"  he  
explained.  
"It's a worthwhile policy for  us  

to have," he continued. "It helps students decide future plans and more clearly think of options." Raymond said most students on leave return to school, but he does not recall many "radical" changes in majors. "Most students stay in business,'' he said. Raymond said that he never recom­mends that a student stop out, because "I do not feel qualified, even if I sp~nt an hour with a student, to recommend a leave.'' 
Joseph C. Hogan, dean of the College of Engineering, also favors the leave of absence policy. He said he • 'was one of the ones who pushed for it" when the idea of a leave policy was being evaluated. 
"Students who are burned-out would benefit in the long run from a semester off," Hogan said. "They should not be stuck in a mold for eight semesters. We have to· flexible enough for students to explore possibilities and be assured of readmission. I am very positive about it.'' 
He estimated that between five and ten students in the college take leaves each year for a wide number of reasons, including job exper­ience, career indecision, and per­sonal problems, but noted that the number of students stopping-out

Profs comment on program 
[continued from page 3]. former Civil Aeronautics Board 
chief and notorious red-tape cuter, as chairman of the enlarged Coun­cil on Wage and Price Stability. The Council will focus special attention on corporations whose annual sales top $500 million, and will use threats to withdraw Fed­eral aids and contracts as leverage. Roger Skurski, associate professor of economics, felt the program is "not harsh enough." He echoed the sentiments of his colleagues when he said, "There is not 
enough incentive to make people 
go along with it; there are not 
enough mandatory guidelines to 
force people to go along with it; and 
we don't have enough social con­
science to play without those." 
Skurski also pointed out that labor isn't going along with the program because it feels it is shouldering a disproportionate share of the bur­den. No less a labor leader than AFL-CIO head George. Meany agrees, denouncing the plan as "inequitable and unfair." Meany also concurred that the program is not harsh enough. saying. "The wav to control inflation is to control it--not to throw cream puffs as it." 
Barry Keating. assistant professor of finance and business economics. likened the program to "squeezing a thermometer to stop a fever. Prices might give. you the impres­sion that inflation is stopping. but the guidelines don't hit at the real cause of int1ation." 
·'The basic definition of inflation is too much money chasing too few goods. The Fed(eral Reser\'e Board) needs to be slowing down the rate of monetary growth. or the money supply." But the Fed. which is not under Carter's control. is not completely to blame. Keating noted. They must compensate the supply for the deficit in the federal budget. which Carter has increased 25 percent in the last two years. 
Finance Department Chairman Herbert Sim agreed, pointing to a reduction in government spending as the best way to cut down on inflation. "I don•t think it (the program) will be effective to any real extent. Carter is asking labor and business not to exercise the powers that they have," he said. 

A formidable viewpoint which seemed to represent how big business felt about not exercising these powers was presented by Herbert Stein. former chairman of the Council of Economic ·Advisors under Presidents Nixon and Ford. Stein, posing as a chairman of the imaginary. but typical. "Major Corporation." wrote a mock letter to Carter (published in the Wall St. Journal) explaining why his com­pany would not conform to the guidelines.

"While one may question whether the price-wage standards will have a positive or negative effect on inflation. there can be no doubt that they will have a negative effect on economic efficiency. Thev will prevent many price-adjustrnents that would be helpful in bringing about needed production or distri­buting scarce supplies...Adherence to the pricing standards enunciated bv the Council on Wage and Pric€ Stability would obstruct many price increases that are in the national interest. and that are not inconsis­tent with average price stability. 
·'Thus. in declining to commit Major Corp. to these price stan­dards. we are not dissenting from a policy that is like!~· to be economi­ca!lv efficient or effective in check­ing-inflation. Indeed. it is our hope that our dissent may to some degree help to concentrate the government's attention on sup­erior wav of dealing with inflation-­fiscal aJld monetar~· restraint." 
Stein· s conclusiOJl on the origin of inflation was stated more bluntly in another letter published several da\'S later. from West German Friedrich vonHavek. co-winner of the 1974 Nobel P~ize for economics. 
''Could you print in front of ;\'cry issue in headline letters the s1mple truth that inflation is made by government and its agents? No­body else can do anything about 

• it." he wrote .. "It might do some good!" Fr. Claude Pomerlau. assistant professor of government and inter­national studies. was also dubious about the success of the program. saying that "voluntary guidelines have never worked in the past. so it · appears that gowrnment regula­tion of prices and wages is abso­lutely inevitable." Adding to his l'ommcnt that mandatorv controls are needed. Pomerlau.sai<l that "verv selective. intelligent and flexible. conlrol~·· can \Vork. and he cited examples in West Germanv and Great Britain. each of which has suffered great inflation in recent vears. "Prices are being fixed, whether you like it or not. Take Exxon. or AT&T for example. Collusion. cartels. etc. are everywhere... You have to apply sophisticated controls where prices arc being set." he said. Jim Rakowski, associate professor of economics. did not feel manda­tory controls arc needed at this time. "Right now there·~ a good deal of inflation of hvstcria... It is not the ultimate evil.· The cost of putting up with prolonged intlation is less than that of putting up with a recession. We can go for quite a while yet." Keating did not feel mandatory controls arc needed ever. sa~·ing they "undermine the basi~ llf a:free society," and Ed Trubac. assol!iate prote.ssor of finance, concurre~. Trubac pointed out that :·there are so many of getting around them. For example, from 1971 to 1974 we had Nixon's wage controls. with a five and one-half percent limit on wage increases, unless you were promoted. So what hapehed was, everybody got a new title... they (controls) create incentives for people to cheat, and I think that's absolutely reprehensible. Even to the extent that controls work.· they're only temporary measures, and once they're lifted. there is a big splurge in prices." Without controls. some econom­ists, including Trubac, are forecas­ting a recession in the ncar future. Trubac predicted a recession for "the second half of 1979." Trubac noted that the sooner we have it. the better it will be," since at this time there are no great inve.ntory excesses or widespread shortages of goods. Economics Department Chairman Charles Wilber said, ''I'm sure there'll be a recession." Wilber felt Carter is hoping that the recovery will come about before the 1980 election, so as not to hurt his bid for re-election. Pomerlau said he believes "Car­ter can take measures to avoid a recession, but whether or not he

will--that's another question." Pomerlau added that "one of these is not to cut welfare; and eventually he must cut defense spending." He termed Carter's massive de­fense spending "god-awful," and noted "that's just politics." 
Keating suggested that "as one possibility, Carter could reduce the deficit and the Fed could reduce the rate of growth of the money supply, but that has nasty side effect," including high interest rates, causing a housing market recession which would not be at all politically beneficial to Carter. 
On the wage insurance tax rebate, Skurski commented that "it seems to be the only thing or incentive to get people to go along with it (the program)." Though most others were in favor of what Sim called a "novel idea," Keating questioned, "where is the money going to come from? Ifhe's forced to pay rebates, he must increase the deficit and the Fed would have to increase the money supply, and that would positively make it worse." 
Newsweek noted that if inflation were to run above ten percent next year, it might cost the government as much as $30 billion in tax rebates. 
Everyone backed Carter's moves to shore up the dollar, with Trubac calling it "long overdue." But both Pomerlau and Rakowski felt the plight of the dollar was over­played. Pomerlau, saying the dollar had already stabilized before Carter's actions, said, "I thought it was a good idea at the time, but it really hasn't made that much difference." Rakowski said, "I don't think the international situ­ation was as bad as a crisis. Politicians and bankers have al­ways thought we were on the precipice, but SI just don't believe we were on the verge of a free world monetary collapse." 
Rakowski pointed out that ''the reason the German mark is so low is because Germany is able to tolerate such low growth." He notes that the unemployment rate in Germany has almost stagnated, while Carter has brought the unemployment rate in the U.S. almost two percent. "A declining exchange rate is not necessarily something to be ashamed of,'' he said. 

Pomerlau said, "I don't see a big problem with the dollar. The American domestic market is ex­tremely strong... until Western Eu­rope puts more stringent controls on the Eurodollars, ours is going to fluctuate." 
Carter seems to be at the same crossroads now that John F. Ken­nedy reached in 1961, having denounced mandatory,controls un­less absolutely necessary. After climbing out of a mild recession in 1961, Kennedy faced creeping inflation, and set down his "Volun­tary Wage and Price Guideposts," similar in form to Carter's guide­lines. 
Trying to avoid the mandatory controls which many were advoca­ting at the time, similar to the present, Kennedy said in his 1962 Economic Report of the President: 
•'Mandatory controls in peacetime over the outcomes of wage negoti­ations and over individual price decisions are neither desirable in the American tradition nor prac­tical in a diffuse and decentralized economy."

'Toga Party' signs inform halls 
by Margaret Burke 

In an effort to help hall judicial boards inform studenls of the drinking regulations in the dorms, the Judicial Council's advertising committee recently circulated 'To­ga Party' signs listing University drinking regulations, 
The 'Toga Party' signs were intended to reinforce the idea that drinking in the halls is not exactly kosher," said Kristen Quann, co­ordinator of the Judicial Council's advertising committee. 
Quann said that if a student does get in trouble in a dorm it is usually because of a drinking violation. These violations are often the result of a party where students did not stay in private rooms while they were drinking alcohol. 
"Unfortunately, we did not get a very favorable result. People reacted by tearing the signs down," Quann related. "I think people misinterpreted them. We were not enforcing the regulations, we were just reminding students of 
Acidic rainfall threatens earth 
WASHINGTON [AP] -Scientists 
say man's omnivorous appetite for 
fossil fuels has spawned a new 
menace. to the environment. The 
heavens, they say, are raining acid. 
Precipitation bearing nitric and 
sulfuric acids is killing fish, eating 
away at buildings and threatening 
to destroy the delicate balance of 
nature in lush forests. 
"From what we know, it's cer­
tainly a very serious problem in 
sensitive areas,'' says Cornell Uni­
versity biologist Carl L. Schofield. 
"We perceive the possibility of a 
major problem," says Norman 
Glass, a research scientist at the 
federal Environmental Protection 
Agency. 
Glass believes the threat will 
worsen as the nation shifts more to 
coal to fuel its power plants.'' 
No one seems to know exactly 
whay, but the problem of acid rain 
is especially acute in the Scanda­
navian countries, and increasingly 
so in the Northeastern United 
States. 
Some scientists speculate that 
these regions are the hapless 
victims of global atmospheric wind 
currents which bring them the 
acidic fallout of pollution spewed 
into the skies from heavily indus­
trialized and populated areas hun­
dreds of miles away -in the 
industrial heartlands of Western 
Europe and the American Middle 
West. 
Schofield, Glass and other scien­
tists say acid rain begins with 
fossil-fueled power plants, shelters 
and automobiles discharging nitro­
gen oxides and sulfur oxides into 
the air. 
Through complex chemical reac­tions in the atmosphere, the oxides are changed into nitric and sulfuric acids which then fall to earth in rain, snow and fine debris. 
Little is known of the ture magnitude of the threat to man and his surroundings. The effects of acid rain are insidious and not easily detected. You can't tell whether the rain you see out the window is realJv acid rain. But the scattered available evidence is not encouraging. 
Researchers have found that: 
-Rainwater and snow have be­come increasingly acidic in the Northeast and parts of Canada in the past 15 years. 
-Fish life has been eliminated in more than 85 high-altitude lakes in Adirondack Park in upstate New York becuase of acid rain, says Schofield. The EPA's Glass re'­ports that in Scandanavia, lakes have become sterile bodies of water and salmon runs have been wiped out in rivers and streams, expecial­ly in Norway and Sweden. 
-Studies show deterioration of buildings and statuary is being accelerated by acid rain, which slowly dissolves cement and stone.

An Awkward Position 
Yesterday Edmund Price. director of Universitv Housing. announced a new procedure to deterntine housing availability for st:niors. In addition to moving up the deadline for submitting housing contracts to February 2 this year. the procedure assesses a $2SO tine on am· student who turns in his hou~ing contract and later decides to move off campus. Along with the fine. the student forfeits his $50 1oom deposit. bringing the total penalty to $300. 
Price savs the additional fine will better guarantee that each student will honor the contract. The Housing office obviously wants next year's seniors to make a serious commitment to living arrange­ments for the '79-'80 school vear. 
Unfortunatelv. the fine might mean something different for-asignificant number of juniors. The Housing Office has indicated that a lottery will very oossibly be held this spring to force some juniors to iive off-campus. Picture the following scenarios: It is possJ1le that a junior with several of his roommates might turn in his housing card. One of 

l ' 
the group could then he lotteried off-campus. 1f one or all of the roommates decicles to move off-campus

t 
a $250 fine will be assessed to each of them for not honoring the housing contract (and they will lose their room deposit). The other option is to let O.!).C friend rno\·e off-co..mpus and make his own living arrangements. 
Because the sUniversitv needs to kno,..,. the number of on-campus rooms req.uircd by <>eniors. they must force the present juniors ro make an early decision about housing. They must also realize the awkward position this places juniors in. A junior who is unsure about off-campus-arrangements may not turn in a housing to avoid a ";;300 loss. But. without a housing contract. he is not assured of a room on 
campus. . 
What the procedure does not cover ts the University's obligation to students who sign the housi'lg contract and do not get rooms on campus. 
Because the cheapest a1,1d most convenient housing will be reserved by this time. perhaps the Housing office should be fined $250 to compensate for the t'xpense and inconvenience they have caused a student. 
To the Junior Class1

We have just begun to make ourselvea hearrl. Hopefull:' the llotr" 

The Housing Office also gave notice of an anticipated $1 SO increase in board to cover "food and other expenses." While these "other expenses" are not enumerated. it is certain they will not be used to improve the halls, unless the University intends to use the funds for increased heat and electric bills. It seems to be merely a ploy to make off-campus housing more economically attractive. The quality of the food docs . need improvement, but it is inconceivable that this cost l could be $ISO per student. 
The next statement which should be examined is the definition of "random sorting." Ideally. a "random" lotterv includes even·one. But scholar­ship athletes are. required to live on campus. Will they be exempt? Also consider the hall officers:-­Anvone not living in the hall cannot be a hall officer. but if already-elected officers arc lotteried off­campus. they must resign and have new elections. or continue to preside in a hall where thev do not live. 
Lastlv we come to the matter of inducting women in the off-campus lottery. Price maintains that there will be two separate lotteries because the male and female overcrowding situations arc two different problems. Yet when Fr. Hesburgh .talk~d to the junior class last week. he strongly tmphed there would be no lottery for women. Apparently. there ts a lack of communication under the golden dome which further clouds the issues. 
The housing contract had always avoided the responsibility of the sUniversity to the students while placing heavy demands on the students· part of the contract. The latest news from the Housing Office adds a monetary burden to the responsibility students are saddled with.

======P.O.Box Q====== 

On Dan Devin,e 
Dear Editor: 
''What is Notre Dam.e? How rnanv books have been written on that subject and all have missed the point for I doubt if anyone could ever express in words what the spirit of Notre Dame is. I have to admit to being a Notre Dame fanatic, not a fan, but why? I wish I knew myself. 
1\s a subway alumni I realize that as students you will think little of my opinion. Why? Well, to most students a subway alumni is a 'character who always seems to get the tickets to the best games, etc.' and I can understand why there is often no love lost between the student body to my group. 
But to many of us, Notre Dame is much more than football-it is the exc~llence that Our Lady repre­sents not only on Saturday after­noons, but the students them­selves, the administration, and all those things that make Notre Dame so very special. 
Yet of all the trips I have made to Notre Dame and all the money scrapped together to send to the greatest university in the world one thing is a puzzle to me. I read in the Observer of the greatest stu­dent body in the world (and you are), but where is your appreciation 
• 
of Coach Dan Devine. I can readily remember all the rallvs held espe­cially for Coach Parseghian, who deserved th~m. But what of Coach Devine? No, he doesn't have the charisma of Ara, bu ·t look at the record just this year. What other team in this country could have lost its first two games, and gone on to do what it has. And what other r0ach in America could have led a team against such a rough schedule to the point where it now stands? To me the answer is none! So be proud of yourselves as the best student body in the world. But wouldn't it be nice if you could sit back and reflect for just awhile, and realize you have in Coach Devine a man who has had to overcome adversity at every step, and given your college such glory. 
How about it men and women of Notre Dame. Do you realize you have on your campus the best coach in this country? Can you honor him in some way, the way Ara was so much? Can the best student body in America come up with something for a man who stands for all the excellence that is Notre Dame, and show his detrac­tors that you stand behind him?

Notre Dante Investment 
Note: On November 6, two Notre Dame undergraduates, the author and Tom Bosche, held a conversa· tion with Fr. Richard P. Zang, the University Investment Officer. The questions and answers which follow are transcribed from a tape of that conversation. 

We asked, "Why isn't the University investment information available to the public?" To which Fr. Zang responded ''The Board of Trustees is accountable only to the Board of Fellows, it is not accoun­table to any public constituency by · law." 
If the University has no legal obligation to reveal such informa­tion then, perhaps, we suggested, it has a moral obligation to be open with the community on such mat­ters. Fr. Zang replied, "Unques­tionably there are moral responsi­bilities of the University to the students, whether or not this is one of them is the question at hand.'' He went on to call for "mutual respect'' between students and administration on this issue. We expressed doubt about this rela­tionship pointing out that at pre­sent there is no reciprocity; stu­dent's concern about University investments was not being respected. Fr. Zang st;tted, "It is not necessarv for Notre Dame to publish the list of its stockholders for, I suggest. to prove to the public that it (ND) cares about its respon­sibility (to the students and towards its investments.'' 
The reluctance of the administra­tion: to reveal the companies which it supports through investments was pursued further by my friend, as he asked, "Is there any specific reason for not releasing the infor­mation?" 
Fr. Zang answered, "I think it's just a matter of the trustees feeling no obligation to do so." 
A discussion followed which 
explored the potential educational 
value to students of a process 
which would allow them to contri­
bute to the decisions concerning 
the ethics of the University's 
investment policy. Fr. Zang 
objected to this form of participa­
tion and said, "This is not a 
classroom we're in; this is not a 
part of the educational process, it's 
the administration of the Univer-
Sl'ty• " 
The questioning then turned to the method of gathering informa­tion with which the trustees guide their decisions on potential com­panies for the University portfolio. Questionnaires are sent to each company by an independent 
' 
agency, an<i they are asked to reveal and explain their policies with regards to oft-condemned business practices. Fr. Zang continued, "Ifthey (the company) .. show a none of your damn business attitude...then the company's lack of willingness to respond indicates 
they're  not  committed  to  pro­ 
gress."  
It  was  pointed  out  by  the  
students that  perhaps  a  parallel  

might be drawn between the University's refusal to reveal infor­mation about its investments and the refusal to reveal information 
It was pointed out by ,the students that perhaps a parallel might be drawn between the University's refusal to reveal infor­mation about its investments and the refusal of certain companies to divulge information about their business practices. Fr. Zang responded, "The differnce is that there's a legal reason why the corporation has to be responsive to its stockholders. We are the company.'' . 
"Who is the source of the decision to maintain the privacy of the names of the companies in the portfolio?" I asked. "The decision was made by the investment com­mittee of the Board of Trustees." Fr. Zang added that it was a "consensus decision" and he said it was his opinion that further inquiry at this level would probably not be fruitful. 
Throughout the interview, Fr. Zang spoke of the pride the University takes in the influence it has been able to assert in pushing for progr:ess in the companies in which it is invested. He cited with satisfaction the endorsement during the past two years, of· the Sullivan principles by 200 Ameri­can companies with South African interests. He felt that several corporatiom. had been pressured into accepting the principles and argued that this was a major advance. University policy prohi­bited him from citing any illustra­tive examples of this positive influence, and Fr. Zang concluded by saying, "I'm doing all I can within the parameters in which I work.'' 
I have harbored my opinions for too long: I cannot maintain my neutrality. The Board of Trustees is not accountable to the students by law. Neither are Stanford and Yale, yet they have decided not to skirt their moral responsibilities to their students by releasing portfo­lio information to them. (Oberlin College Survey, 1978) But is this the same administration whose 
unfailing dedication to the_ perfec­
.jin1 byrne 
tion of its students' mores brought us "in loco parentis"? Perhaps it's 

-time for the students to exercise their right of "in loco offspringis". What child has ever been denied his right to know where his parents earn their money? 
" ... the corporation has to be responsive to its stockholders. We are the company." Is the Adminis­tration's justification for hiding the results of their investment policy implied by this statement? Using their own statement, it seems ta1r to insert "University" for "corpo­

. ration" and "student body and faculty" for "stockholders". Fr. Zang refused to accept such a simple analogy; he obviously has not seen 6,000 students chanting "we are (clap, clap) ND" at a football game. In that cheer is hidden a basic truth (at least I used to believe it), that this institution exists for, and because of, the students. The faculty, which provides the service students pay for, is equally essential to the University. Apparently the admi­nistration feels that we are not the University. Who is? It must be them; noone else is left. I would prefer not to accept this attitudinal atrocity, but the administration furnishes no escape from this interpretation of their policy. 
Fr. Hesburgh has made numer­ous statements about the need for Notre Dame to take a leadership role in a world-wide campaign for human development, especially for the Third World nations. Corpora­tions with holdings in Third World nations. from Sou:n Africa to South America, are a negative force in many respects. The furor about infant formulas. especially Nestle • s Bear Milk, and the illegal sale of weapons to the South African government by Olin are two examples of morally unjust acts by the "advanced" world. Should Notre Dame, as a moral leader, be willing to invest in these compa­nies, or companies with similar business practices? That is the primary question, but their policies prevent us from even finding answers to such secondary ques­tions as "Where do you invest?, or. more ac<;urately, "Where do we 

-invest?'' The Board of Trustees exhibits pride in their progressive invest­' 
ment decisions through press releases, so why do they fear public access to the product of their Christian decisions? How can a moral leader, an example for others to follow around the world. hide its actions? Finallv, how can the administration exclude student body and faculty input on such a crucial moral decision.?

Will Nixon Forgive Us 
art buchu,ald 

WASHINGTON--"When do you think he'll forgive us?" my -wife asked. . 
"Who?" I inquired. 

"Nixon," she said, pointing to the television set where he was telling the kids at Oxford how he screwed up on Watergate. 
"He's not supposed to forgive us!" I yelled, "we're supposed to forgive him. And I'm not ready to yet." 
"You're wrong," she replied. "We never forgive Nixon. He always forgives us. Remember back in 1952 how mad we were at him and he went on television with Checkers and told us he knew how we felt, and that if he was in our place he'd feel the same way? HE forgave us for feeling the way we did, and sure enough we made him Vice President of the United States." 
''I remember, but that wasn't Watergate. Why should I have Nixon forgive me, after what he did· in the White House?'' 
"Because that's the way it's always been with Nixon. No matter what he's ever done, we wind up asking him to forgive us, instead of 
' the other way around. Frankly, I'd rather ask his forgiveness now than string out the agony over the next few years. I don't think I can stand watching him take the blame for all the mistakes he made while he was President.'' "You can't ask his forgiveness," 
I told her angrily. ''This is one 
time I don't see how he can get off 
the hook. He blew it, and if it 
hadn't been for Gerry Ford's 
pardon he'd be taking the Fifth 
Amendment right now. Instead, 
he's running around Europe telling 
everyone he's guilty, but he for­
gives the American people 
anyway.'' 
My wife watched as the Oxford 
students beat up on Nixon's auto­
mobile. She said, "He loves it. To 
him the eggs they're throwing at 
him are roses." 
"How can you say that? Those 
kids haven't forgotten what he 
did.'' 
"They'll forgive him," she assured me. "In his heart he may think they're bums, but he'll say that although he doesn't like to have eggs thrown at him--nobody likes to have eggs thrown at them--he can understand why they would throw eggs at ·him, and perhaps, if he was going to Oxford instead of being the disgraced President ofthe United States, he's be throwing eggs at himself. 
''And he'11 come back here and tell us that although he had eggs thrown at him at Oxford he doesn't hold any ill feelings toward the students, because only a small percentage of them actually threw the eggs, and it isn't the first time people have thrown eggs at him. Then he'll say it was nothing compared to what thye did to him

e 1g1ous Preference 

Dear Editor: 
Having recently noted a letter in The Observer referring to the completion by students of "religi­ous preference" forms, I wish to supply the following clarification. 
The form to which Mr. Claude referred was prepared to assist the Campus Ministry Office in deter­mining the specific denomination with which Protestant students at 
,nd Pat in Venezuela. And you know something? We'll ask him to forgive us because we enjoyed watching the Oxford kids throw eggs at him." 
"That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Nixon lied to us, he obstructed justice, he plotted to cover up all sorts of crimes, and he was responsible for dozens of people going to jail to protect him. And you say we're going to ask him to forgive us?" 
"You got it. You thought he was going to sit it out in San Clemente looking out at the sea. I told you it would just be a matter of time before he'd be out in the streets having eggs thrown at him. I wouldn't be surprised if Nixon paid for the eggs out of his English royalties. Dick has done it to us again." 
"Woman," I cried, "have you taken leave of your senses? Do you think this country is ready to forgive and forget in less than five years?" 
''You can scream and yell all you want," she said, "but in a few years there won't be a man, woman or child in the United States who won't ask Nixon to forgive them for forcing him to resign from office. And the beauty of it is that he will forgive us. Because he knows that we didn't know all the facts, and even if we did know all the facts we still weren't in a position to judge him, because only history should judge a President and not the people who were there at the time." 
"You really think it's going to happen?" I asked nervously. She pointed at the TV set and replied, "It's happening already."

Juniors Being Sold Out

Attention a11 radical-I'm-mad-as-hell-and-I'm-not-going-to-take-it­
anymore-but-1-think-I'm-about-to-get-reamed-Juniors: 
Presently the Business Office of the University of Notre Dame is 
planning to market a product in the fall of 1979. It is a year of higher 
education that features two semester fo 15 to 18 credit hours each, a 
spacious suite of rooms with maid and laundry service, and 21 nourishing 
if not semi-delicious meals a week. From past experience, the Office of 
Business Affairs is expecting a record number of orders. 
The OBA calculates that it can provide about five or six thousand units 
of this product. However, being the sly entrepreneurs that they are, the 
business officers figure they can make even more of themoney that they 
worship so much if they. accept 300 to 400 more orders than they can 
actually fill with their existing facilities. In most industries this would be 
illegal, but they feel they will be able to stay one step ahead of the law as 
they have done so many times in the past. All they have to do is jam a few 
extra students into each classroom. Of course, no more tables will fit in 
the dining halls. so students will have to wait in line longer to get in and to 
get food. The business officers argue, however, that the students will not 
even notice the extra wait, because who can tell the difference between 
forever and twice as long as forever? Their only remaining problem is 
living quarters for the remaining people. I guess they figure we won't kick 
and scream if we get booted off campus justbecause part of the advertised 
product is missing just as people who find a piecr.: of a jigsaw puzzle 
missing wouldn't raise a raucous. · 
In other words, fellow Juniors, we are being sold out. For how much? 
Why for the amount of tuition ofcourse! Every Junior that they can coerce (i.e. boot) off campus still pays tuition so the more of the bootees that the booter can stuff into the classrooms the more money the booter makes. 1 hus, if they lottery 300 of us off at $3300 tuition apiece, then they are selling us out for $990,000. We should be honored! Pretty shrewd of our 
friends in the Office of Business Affairs. 
Speaking of religion, what was that thing they taught us about in theology-oh yeah-compassion. I remeber one story in the Bible about some guy and his pregnant wife coming up to an innkeeper and asking him for a place to stay. Instead of showing them compassion, this inkeeper says "sorry, no room at the inn" and tells them to take a hike. They end up sleeping in a stabel on animal dung, I think. Anyway, these university-establishment, sometimes called accountants, preach compas­sion to us, but then go and commit the Innkeeper's sin a thousand fold? Nice going guys! If you really want to make some money, maybe you can patent and sell your do-as-1-say-not-as-1-do, I-may-not-be-perfect-but­I'm-as-close-as-anyone-will-ever-get-attitude. 
Personally, the whole situation is disgusting and I think we Juniors ought to do something about it. Let's face it, tents with slogans are cute, but the Administration can shrug it off too easily. I think we should all go out and burn a few freshmen in protest, and if that doesn't work, then we should begin stockpiling napalm and nuclear warheads for the long hard fight ahead. Or maybe we could all do something really damaging like wearing tee shirts with nasty saying in front of the contributing alumni. That might hit N.D. right in the ol' bankbook. 
What can we learn from this whole situation? We learn how to connive; we learn to ripoff; we learn to ignore alternatives when we want to; we learn how to go as far as possible in trying a person's patience before he fights back. We also learn how to wring every possible dollar out of a business venture without concerning ourselves with silly morals and values. But then, aren't these the reasons why each of us chose to come here in the first place? Maybe not.

Christmas tree; the boy had his Channukah candles. I'm sure the boy loved his candles; but every year, the boy also fell in love with the Christmas tree, the Little Drummer Boy, the three kings, and the shepherds who followed the star. Aaron never told me he wanted to be friends with the Gentiles who visited the manger; but when he would come into my mother's house, he would move his cookies and milk into the living room so that he could watch the tree. Some days he watched it so closely that the cookies and milk never even got touched. Aaron was not a lad to be easily led into infidelity to his daily lunch. 
One year, when -Aaron was seven or eight, the Catholic children making their First Communions were invited to sing carols at the Midnight Mass. As a rule, Aaron never commented to me on what the Catholic children talked about; he only listened when they got excited about going to confesson or learning the lessons of the catechism. But he knew that going to Midnight Mass was something extraordi­nary that the kids were not usually allowed to do, and later he asked me about it. 
"Gritchen," he said, "Somebody is having a birthday party, and I haven't been invited." His language was always very formal, and he had called me "Gritchen" when he was too young to pronounce "Griffin", and now it was his personal nickname. A sign of our special friendship was that--unlike the Catholic children--he didn't have to call me "Father". 
"I think you've know about the birthday for a long time, Aaron," I said. "The birthday of the baby under the tree is the reason we have the Christmas tree. We celebrate the baby's birthday with a tree instead of a cake." 
"Yes," he said, "but there's going to be a party, and everyone is going to sing. I

Aaron was a little Jewish boy whom my niece used to take care of on afternoons when she wasn't busy being a school girl. I met him in the year I was ordained, when he was the merest toddler. He would stare at my collar as though wondering why I had put it on backwards; but afterwards, he would always ask, my niece said, what it meant to be a priest, and why the Catholic children called me "Father", when I didn't

I 
have an Aaron to my name. Her answers , must have been good, because one day, a J cake showed up at the door, frosted withi the Hebrew words of the Decalogue, a gift from Aaron and his parents, congratulating , me as though I were being bar mltzvahed. The cake, I think, was his Jewish parents' I 
way of letting their little son feel the the 1 newly-ordained priest belonged as much to j him as to the Christian children of the neighborhood. 
To establish covenants, the command­
ments do not have to be carved on tablets of stone; pink and white icing can spell out the commandments, if commandments are needed to establish a covenant. That ordinations-bar mitzvah cake established a covenant of friendship between Aaron and me as surely as though the articles of our mutual esteem had been signed under the cloud cover of Sinai. I was to be his special friend; he was to be my special friend; but I would not be friends with him in the same way I was friends with the Catholic

"Aaron," I said, "it isn't really a party; it's just something called ~oing to church. We do it every Sunday. It's like when you go to the synagogue on Friday nights or Saturdays." 
"I always go to parties," he said, "when I'm invited." 
"Aaron," I said, "why don't you ask your father aand mother about it." What other answer was there to give to this young son of Abraham who felt that doors were being closed against him? 
In the next few days, Aaron kept coming back with questions about the Christmas party and the children who were going to sing, and inquiring whether he might be invited to sing also. He knew that Midnight Mass was special, and First Communions were a goyim practice he had never had to deal with before. I could only suggest that he talk to his parents; I thought of telling· him how special it was to be Jewish, though the difference between Jews and Catholics was a topic on which we had kept our conspiracy of silence. "I can't tell him how special it is to be Jewish," I thought, ''without causing him to wonder if it is also special to be Catholic.'' 
One day, I found that Aaron wouldn't speak to me. He came into the house with my niece, and turned his head away when I greeted him. I went over to the chair where he was sitting, looking like the outcast of the world, a cherished child of the Chosen People, whom nobody had invited to the party.
"Aaron," I said, "what's wrong?" His eyes filled up with tears, but he just shook his head. I put my arms around him. He resisted for a moment, and then began sobbing as though some precious promise had been broken between us. "Oh, Gritchen,'' he said, "there's a

him God, but I didn't need to. God has promised to give Aaron God, and His promise was confirmed on tablets of stone. God is faithful to His promises, and I had to be faithful to mine, I thought, although the commandments that were exchanged between Aaron and me were written on a piece of cake.

he looks at life religiously. Springsteen is by no means making any formal profession of faith but he is stating that the story of faith, particularly Christian faith, is strongly connected with the faith that it takes to make sense out of, and find purpose to, this life we all go through. 
Such a venture is destined to be plagued with restlessness. This can be seen by the thought develot>ment Springsteen experi­ences as he moves through the years. In the classic piece "Growing Up", he recalls with both ardor and remorse the wild ways of his youth. ''I was open to the pain and crossed by the rain ... , I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared". In "It's 
so Hard to be a Saint in the City',, he tells of the price he had to pay for pretending to be "the pimps' main prophet" -disillu­sionment: The devil appeared like Jesus through the steam in the street, Showin' me a hand I kneweven the copscouldn't beat, I felt his hot breath on my neck as I drove into the heat, It's so hard to be saint when you're just a. bov o•It on the street.

leave it all behind:

more. Mike Baxter for example, he challenges the mythical figure Mary and also the listener in saying, 
You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain, make crosses from your lovers, throw roses 
in the rain, waste your summer prayin' in vain, for a savior to rise from these streets. The alternatives he presents are qualita­tively either/or. There is a real possibility that one might find some reasons to keep on living but it is an adventurous stab into the dark. No certainties, no guarantees, just a chance. It's an act of faith: 
·We got one last chance to make it real to trade in the~e wings on some wheels Climb in back

"that ain't got the faith to hold its ground" e 
is a powerful metaphor in this regard. e 
But alongside the intrepidness is a e soulful longing for release from the guilt • and irreconciliation that is painfully • inherent in the human condition.

He scorns people who are contented with the pointless and empty waiting that life can so easily become. In "Thunder Road", This is a tale of becoming painfully aware of life in the city, of the frustration, the fear, the pervasive boredom. In "Sandy", from The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle, Bruce snaps out at the triviality of the Jersey shore scene, with the "pleasure machines" (pinball) and "the factory girls who allpromiseto unsnap their jeans'', with analmostKierkegaardian rejection of aestheticism, when he says, "For me this boardwalk life's through, baby/you ought to quit this scene too." Somehow he wants to break out of the suffocating, repetitious, amusement-park pattern of his life thatso many seem to be able to thrive on. He wants something

Reviewing· Reviews 

A Touch of Keenan 
[Editor's Note: This Is a corrected version of Mark's review, which was pubUsbed In Tuesday's Observer.] 
It is possible, and in fact it is generally the norm, to pay a lot of money in the hopes of being entertained. The thought that the entertainment might not be worth it is a rather unentertaining thought. This being counter-productive, it occurs that being entertained is really something of a gambling proposition, so one appreciates the nicest aspect ofthe "Keenan Revue": it is free and it is good. I had a great time Saturday evening--it was an excellent way to start the night--and as I turned and looked up at the completely packed house and saw a lot of other people doing the same it occurred to me that, since people really lined up tor the free tickets, Keenan no doubt would have been able to sell them. But there the people were, sitting ther having a good time. For free. On Keenan. There is something very cool about that. 
At any rate, to the point: talent . like a keg, is there to be tapped, and that is precisely what Keenan did this weekend (tap talents, not kegs, though it is not clear that they did not do that too). I am told that on Friday night the show ran way too long and the sound systme was bad. Those two problems were improved to an extent Saturday night, but they still were notice­able. As far as running too long goes, the three hour show didn't really drag until dght at the end. And as for the sound I think the poignant observation would be that it was the only thing that Keenan residents were not involved in. In fact, ironically enough, the sound men were "professionals" hired by Keenan to guard against that very thing. But, even with all that, the amount of talent comin~ from one 
Mark Rust hall is the thing of which one is conscious during the show. 
The "Keenan Revue" (or the "New Keenan Revue,'' a distinction on which I am still not very clear) was full of people with something valuable to offer. There were poets and guitarists and readers and singers and violinists and actors and dancers and comedians and jugglers. There was wit and satire, direction and drama, rock and roll, and enough classical touches to keep everyone occupied. 
The music, to begin, was well done. Piano solos by Charlie Russ and Renard Guerringer were impressive. Mike Kammerdiener appeared frequently to add his guitar and voice to those of Rich Pugliese for a particularly good version of "If You Could Read My Mind," and the guitar work (if nothing else) was impres· sive on ''The Needle and the Damage Done." "Free Bird," performed by a group of Keenan rockers, was good, especially the lead guitar. As for the hits of feedback in the jam--what the hell. I imagine Lynyrd Skynyrd had to deal with 
that in the beginning too.  Sean Whaley's  
violin recitation of. Haydn  was superb and  
an unexpected treat.  

The humor, which sometimes soft-shoed over the boundaries of good taste, was genuinely funny. Life at Notre Dame cries out everyday to be satirized, and it is rare that a hall gets such a great chance to vent its collective spleen. Nice. 
In all, the "New Keenan Revue" was a very agreeable experience. I'm impressed that there is so much talent in one hall, and my guess is that there is more where that came from in other halls. It is a shame that we don't have more outlets around campus to showcase it like Keenan has showcased it for everyone's entertainment. And for free. Very cool.

Addiction rises 

Heroin 'floods' Europe 
BONN, West Germany [AP] -High 
quality, lowpricedheroin is flooding 
Western Europe, police say, result­
ing in a pattern of rising youth 
addiction and drug deaths reminis­
cent of the U.S. experience. 
Investigators believe most of the 
heroin comes from the Middle 
East, which last year began replac­
ing Southeast Asia as the major 
supplier for the Europeannarcotics 
trade. 
"We used to hear that the 'old 
world' attitude would keep drugs 
out of Europe,'' said Thomas V. 
Cash, special agent in charge the 
U.S. Drug Enforcement Admini­stration operation in Germany, "But this is very clearly not the case." 
He said that the increasing prevalence of heroin, various pills and other drugs bears striking similarities to the growth of drug abuse in the United States from 1966 to 1976: "It's eerie to watch." 
Heroin abuse has been on the decline in the United States in recent years -heroin-related deaths in New York City dropped

from 900 in the early 1970s to about 400 this year. 
In West Germany, where the drug problem is perhaps greatest, the federal criminal office reports 172 kilograms of heroin have been seized so far this year, compared with about a teaspoonful in 1968. A kilogram is 2.2 pounds. 
Berndt-Georg Thamm, a Berlin drug expert, said the percentage of 12-to 16-year-olds among West Germany's 50,000 estimated heroin addicts has jumped from nearly zero to 20 percent in three years. 

Heroin is sold in a purer form in West Germany, and is therefore somewhat cheaper. 
For the equivalent of $85, German addicts can buy a gram of heroin, enough for about 20 inject­ions, drug experts say. The product is 30-40 percent pure, compared with under 5 percent pure for heroin sold in the United States. In New York City, the price for a gram of heroin -the less pure variety -is $55 to $65.

Archibald talks to whooping cranes 
BARABOO, Wis. [AP]--It is not just that George Archibald talks to 
. the birds. Not even that he talks to the oldest. rarest, most beautiful birds in the world. The thing is. when George Archibald talks to them. they answer. And some­times. when he asks them to dance Yo"ith him. they do. 
And they should. Because the great cranes became the most important birds in the life of 
.I George Archibald, who has become 1 one of the most important men in , the lives of the birds. whose survival is threatened on much of the globe. 
Most Americans know about the whooping crane. the continent's 
' tallest bird. whose clarion once deafened the countryside during night-long passage. but whose numbers dipped to 22 wild birds and stirred the national conscience in 1941. 
Through the combined efforts of individuals. societies and govern­men~ agencies. there are now 77 birds in the wild census, and 28 more adults in captivity. 
But of the 15 species of cranes in the world. nearlv half are in trouble and several are more endangered 
than the whooper. 
Which brings the story back to George Archibald, and a 65-acre convered horse farm astride the

traditional sandhill crane migration path. · 
Here, in the headquarters of the International Crane Foundation, you can, Archibald says. "see more kinds of cranes in 15 minutes than most people could see in a life­time." 
The comment. like most scientif­
ic speculations. is conservative. In 
this country. for instance. many 
people can -or at least could -see 
the sandhill crane in one of is

The world·s second rarest bird is the Siberian crane. which has a voice like bells ringing. There are two remnant groups in Asia. total­some 360 birds. 
The Japanese crane. celebrated in poetry for 1.500 years. is said to be the most respected bird in Japan. Because legend has it living for a thousand years. it is a symbol of long life; because it mates for life, a svmbol of Jove. 
The species no~· numbers fewer than 55. many living year-round in nearly inaccessible marshes near Hokkaido. Archibald located theri nests in 1972, found the area was part of a real estate development and aroused Japanese opinion to

GATOR BOWL: Clemson has become a legitimate football power under Charlie Pell. This is their second straight trip to the Gator which says something aobut Pell's instant results. But Charlie will be making this his farewell appearance at Clemson as he has taken the coaching job at Florida. The effect of a coach leaving can cut deeply either way. In this case it may do harm because the Tigers face Ohio State, a team that can make any coach's last game a nightmare. Woody had to convince the athletic board to let him and his boys come east so don't expect him to lose. 
PEACH BOWL: The Boilermakers wish they were in sunny California picking roses but still they can't complain. This year Purdue was more than Mark Herrmann's arm which means their program is improving. They face another Irish opponent in Georgia Tech. If these teams' performances against ND are any indication of their talent. Purdue will win. Watch Eddie Lee Ivery to wow the scouts in a losing cause. 
BLUEBONNET BOWL: Georgia could be in the Sugar Bowl if they 
had gone for a two-point conversion two weeks earlier than they did. 
Instead of meeting the number one team in the nation, they go 
up against Stanford. Stanford doesn't even belong in a bowl game. 
They can pass on a sunny day but that's it. Georgia may be down 
about the inferior bowl but they should wake up in time to down the 
Cardinals. · 
ORANGE BOWL: This is a rerun but a new ending has been spliced in. The Cornhuskers took this one during the regular season but the Sooners will not fumble eight times .again including three times inside the twenty. Heisman Trophy winner Billy Simms was responsible for two of those faux pas but won't let it happen again--he promises. Oklahoma has everything to gain and nothing to lose while Nebrasks feels the pressure of reproving themselves with nothing to gain. Notre Dame should be playing in this one anyway. The Sooners will give the Cornhuskcrs a post-New Year hangover as they make it a Iaugher. 
ROSE BOWL: Finally the two best teams from the Big and PAC-lO"s will be playing each other. Michigan has been the better team for the last four vears and haven"t won. This vcar it will be different. The Wolverrnes aren't the better team and ~ill lose. USC has the most talent in the country but that doesn't always win football games. It will win this one. 
-

SUGAR BOWL: This is for all the chips and it couldn't match two bigger national championship crybabies. Bear Bryant sw,ears he should have won it last year, so now he and his supporters can either put up or shut up. Poor Joe Paterno. who has been robb'cd because his team is from the east and plays the worst schedule of any of the top ten teams. only has to win one more to get his first MacArthur Bowl. It should be a good game because it will be close but expect mistakes. The defenses prevail until Barna's offense breaks lose for the national championship clinching TD. 
COTION BOWL: Houston possesses one of the best offenses in the nation with a great rushing attack. Notre Dame possesses one of the best offenses in the nation with a great passing game. Expect a few points to be scored. However. points come easier through the air and the Comback Kid will be playing this one for that pro bonus. ND's defense has always been able to contain the run when necessarv. All this leads to the conclusions that the Irish will win if they w·ant to. l MA'\:' BE WRONG BUT I'LL PICK ND BY 10.

ND icers ready for Badgers 
by Lou Severino Sports Writer 
The t)lird ranked Notre Dame hockey team will attempt to defeat Wisconsin for the first time in over 2 years as they host the Badgers in a two game series at the Athletic and Convocation Center this week­en The Friday and Saturday games are virtualy sellouts but both contests will be carried live on WSND-AM 640. 
Wisconsin, coached by Bob Johnson, lost 11 players to graduat­ion and has gotten off to a slow start (6-5-1 in WCHA play.) The Badgers boast one of the top players in the nation in Mark Johnson who leads the WCHA in scoring with 11 goals in 15 assists for 26 points. The Junior All­American needs only nine more goals to become the Badger career­scoring leader. However, Johnson, the coach's son, is questionable for the series after suffering a deep thigh bruise last week as Wisconsin split with Michigan State. H Johnson is unable to play he will be replaced by his brother, freshman Pete Johnson. 
Wingers Lew Grauer a 20 goal scorer the past two years has notched seven goals despite miss­ing two games with injuries. Lecy enjoyed a spectacular series last week tallying two hat tricks and adding three assists against the Spartans. Tha performance earned him the WCHA Player of the week Jeff Brownschidle will try and lead the Irish to a home sweepaward.

since the opening faceoff of the first game Ted Weltzin will center the first line with Greg Meredith and Steve Schneider on the wings. The second line will consist of Tom Michalek, Jeff Logan and Kevin Humphreys. Rounding out the forward lines is the Freshman trio of Dave Poulin, Jeff Perry and Bill Rothstein. 
On the bluelinewill be John Friedmann and either Don Lucia or John Cox. Lucia is questionable because of strained knee liga­ments. Also on defense will be the pairing of Jeff Brownschidle and Scott Cameron, and first year men John Schmidt and Jim Brown. Frosh Dave Laurion will probably be in the nets both nights. 
Injuries may play a crucial role in the outcome of the series. In 

addition to Mark Johnson the Badgers may be at less thanfull strength with defensemen Ron Griffin and Jay Macfarlane return­ing to action after missing four weeks. Notre Dame which has been relatively injury free thus far, may be with the services of Cameron and Weltzin in addition to Lucia. 
Nonetheless this should be an outstanding series with both clubs looking to move up in the tightly bunched WCHA race. The Irish trail league leader Minnesota by a single point while the Badgers could possibly move from fifty to second with a sweep. 
This will be the last home series before the semester break.. The Irish will play road games against Western Michigan, Harvard and Boston College before returning home to meed N. Dakota Jan. 5th and 6th.

Irish cagers ready for UCLA; stopping Hamilton a key factor 

by Frank LaGrotta Sports Writer 
When Notre Dame and UCLA play basketball, it's not just another "big game." 
Don't compare it to the San Francisco game or even to Mar­quette, because it's just not the same. It's nothing like Maryland or NC State either. You just can't include the Bruins on Digger's list of "power games," as he likes to call them. 
Well, you can ... but I recommend that you put it at the top of the list and for a very good reason. 
' You see, Notre Dame versus UCLA is different. There's no getting around that. Neither team prepares more intensely for any other opponent. Ditto that state­ment for their fans. 
Really. When Marquette comes to South Bend, the scalpers beg for 20 bucks a ticket. On Bruin day, they demand no less than SO...and they usually get more. The reason for that is something all Irish fans should be familiar with. 
It's called tradition and in the ranks of college basketball, UCLA's got more than its' share. It started a few years back when John Wooden worked the same kind of magic on the Bruin hardcourt that a man named Rockne once per­formed on a football field tucked somewhere behind Notre Dame's ACC. 
The best players, a few tricks and lots of wins and championships. And when you come right down to it, it doesn't reany matter what any other team has done ... or will do. When it comes to college basket­ball, UCLA will always be the measuring stick. 

"They are," to use Digger's favorite adjective, "the Pin­stripes." He's a Yankee fan. 
But, speaking of tradition, Notre Dame is still Notre Dame. 
The two teams have played 21 times with the Bruins winning 13 and the Irish, eight. However, in their last eight meetings, Notre Dame has come away with five victories, including the last two at Pauley Pavilion, the Bruins home arena. 
They'll try to make it three in a row tomorrow night at 8 p.m. PST (11 o'clock South Bend time( when they meet the Bruins for the 22nd. time in a series that dates back to 1954. Up until tip-off, stories about tradition, legends and past games will fill the sports pages of practicany every newspaper from heretoSouthernCal. Butwhenthe game starts, none ofthe "what ifs" or "what coulds," or "what mights," will matter to anyone. What will make a difference are the ten players on the floor and the two coaches on the bench. And they've all been there before. For UCLA, the man is David Greenwood. Or, at least that's what they tell you. Oh, his stats are impressive: 22 points and 9.8 rebounds per game. He's shooting 65 percent from the field and against DePaul (remember DePaul?) the senior forward scored 
28 points-a season high for the 
Bruins.  He  was  first-team  An­ 
America  last  year  and  he'll  
probably  be  there  again  this  
spring.  

If he is, he better take his backcourt out to dinner. After the way they'll "feed" him all season, I think it would be only fair. 
You see, Greenwood may be the meat of the Bruin attack but Roy Hamilton and Brad Holland are Gary Cunningham's bread and butter. A source close to the Bruin coach points out that, "stopping Greenwood hurts the Bruins, but stopping Holland and Hamilton buries them." Digger Phelps, the son of an undertaker, would like nothing better. "It's not easy to beat the Bruins anywhere," emphasizes Phelps, "especially Pauley Pailion. They rebound well, they shoot wen and they play good defense." 
I won't bore you with talk of 1-3-1's or 3-1-3's. Maybe you understand all the technical jargon. 
I certainly dont. Offense and defense is about as far as I go. But when you get right down to it, that's what wins and loses ball­games. 
And it won't be any different tomorrow night. The Irish, in Digger's own words, have got to "out-rebound their big men and not let their guards get the ball inside." 
That means they have to stop Holland and Hamilton. 
Digger will start Rich Branning 


and Bill Hanzlik in his backcourt. In a man-to-man situation, the likely match-ups will be Branning on Holland and Hanzlik on Hamilton. Branning is one of the smartest players in the game and he's rarely beaten. If you've got any questions about Hanzlik, just ask Butch Lee. But talking about the past won't 
be worth anymore on Saturday than a ticket to last year's game. If· Digger and his crew have plans for a springtime visit to Salt Lake City, then they'd best take advantage of this winter excursion to sunny Southern Cal. 
My prediction? Bet a bundle on Notre Dame.

Ray O'Brien 

I may be wrong but.. _ 
Its final exam ~ime for the Irish Eye. The predictions are narrowed down to the major bowl games. The talent in these contests are so evenly matched in these games that debate in inevitable. The only game that means anything will be played in New Orleans between Alabama and New Orleans. As Digger Phelps would say for the other teams "the rest is gravy." Since I have no other finals. I have had plenty of time to research these teams anp as always these picks are not mere guesses but virtual certainty. For those that maligned this column every Friday, thank you for reading. 


GARDEN STATE BOWL: This is a new one on the bowl scene and will be played at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. Local favorite Rutgers is taking on Arizona State in an attempt to build a national calibre program. The Sun Devils wiil be them a national calibre humiliation in front of the home town folks as they make minced meat out of the Scarlet Knights defense. · 
HALL OF FAME BOWL: Texas A&M runs into an underrated Iowa State squad in this one. The Aggies have an awesom defense when they feel like playing. Iowa State boasts a_ balanced attack and proves that college football is gaining parity but is not as competitive as the NFL as the perennial power from Texas takes this 
·title. 
HOLIDAY BOWL: For the first time in a decjlde, a military academy has made it to post season play. The Middies tost three of 
. their last four gamt{s but injuries played a big part in their downfall. Leszcynski is a top calibre passer and Navy's defense is better than good. Brigham Young will pass for over 300 yards but \viii get shot down in the end by the sentimental favorites from Annapolis. 
LIBERTY BOWL: Missouri proved that their NO's opening loss was no fl ukc. The Tigers knocked off Nebrasks in their last regular 
__ season game. lSU played like champions until they faced a decent team called the Crimson Tide. Charles Alexander had a less than Heisman "·inning year and that had a lot to do with their downfall. Bo'' I games arc the last chance for pro scouts to grade the graduating studs. so look for Charlie to do a lot of things he didn't do all season as the Tigers slip by the Tigers. 
SUN BOWt: Claiborne once again got the Terps into a post season game which is more than Lefty Drisell has managed with his cagers. The T crps boast a strong offense although their defense has been suspect. The Maryland offense better be ready· •'cause they will be facing one of the best defenses in the coun ,-in Texas. The longhorns arc particularly stubborn against he run which the Tcrps usc to get up the passing attack. N•.l run. ,,) pass. no pass, no win. bet Texas.

They boast a good quarterbr,ck and backmates. The defense is stingy but an eyelash from making Arkansas the best.
