Students turn over a new-leaf w-ith raking 
Volunteers aid elderly in outdoor fall projects 
By JOE PIARULLI News Writer 
When the leaves started falling on South Bend, nearly 200 Notre Dame students were there to pick them up as part of Turning Over a New Leaf', a service project that helped dis­abled and elderly community members with their yard work. 
The event, organized by Circle K, Badin Hall and the Classes of 2007 and 2008, went from 9 
a.m. until noon Saturday. 
Volunteers congregated at the Robinson Community Centnr, a 15-minute walk from Main Circle, where free breakfast was provided. The volunteers then split into groups of about eight. 
"[The Robinson Center has] a strong connp,ction to the corn­munity, so they. wont out and found about 50 elderly. disabled homp,owrwrs that nnndnd stu­dents to come do yard work f'or them, mostly raking leaves," vice president of' serviee f'or Cirelp, K Adrienne HuiTner said. 
Most of' the homes were within sevp,ral bloeks of' the Hobinson Cnnter, so the residents are not far removed from the Univnrsity. 
"Everybody was eneouraged to knock on the door and talk to the !disabled or elderlyl person. A lot of' times people are shut in and thp,y don't really get to sen studnnts," said HufTnnr, who is also an Observnr reportor.

Funny how things work.

When it came to

amazing-looking (to us) pictures of the monuments and memorials, she'd been there, done that. On of first day of explo­ration of the city, we even walked -for four hours -back from the Capitol to Georgetown. We made our way up the National Mall, to all the monuments, past the White House, back to the monu­ments, to the Potomac River, over to George Washington University's neat, urban campus and, finally, up Pennsylvania Avenue and back to the Georgetown neighborhood. 
Tired, sore and impressed with our­selves, we told her of our trek, and she merely laughed and said, "People do that all time. People try to walk back from all over the place and get lost all the time." 
little did we know. 

Despite our setbacks, we were deter­mined to take an impressive picture or at least do something impressive. 
The next day we fake climbed out of the Potomac River-hanging over the edge, holding onto the railings-which was probably a bit dangerous consider­ing there was no ledge beneath us. 
We really were determined. 

After looking at our fairly impressive pictums, we decided we still hadn't taken "the one"-the one picture that would be the ultimate imprcssor. 
We continued our walk, tried to think of other outrageous poses and arrived at the FOR Memorial. 
It was getting dark, and all we had were a few photos of us climbing out of the Potomac River. 
Then, there he was. 

There walked Bono -the legendary rock star from U2 who just this week appeared on the cover of RoUing Stone. 
The sun was setting, so besides my roommate and me, Bono and the three other people (including a bodyguard) who walked with him, there were not many sightseeing tourists around. 
Unsure ifwe should bother him at first, we kept walking and eventually decided we had to ask. 
"Sorry to interrupt," we said, "but would you mind taking a picture with us?" 
"For sure, man," Bono said in his Irish accent. 
Sporting his infamous tinted sunglass­es, his shiny earrings, his dark boots and his black leather jacket, he even posed, and some guy in a suit-maybe his agent-took our picture. 
Bono was nice about it. We told him we were from Notre Dame. 
"Ah, beautiful campus. I loved that campus," he said, remembering his visit several years ago for a sold-out concert. 
We told him thanks and walked on in disbelief. He continued his short tour of the memorial and hopped in his ride. 
Needless to say, we decided we had found a fairly impressive picture. 
This time, we took the metro instead of making the tiring jaunt back to Georgetown.

Authorities said they already had gathered use­ful clues about the near­simultaneous blasts Saturday night that ripped through a bus and two crowded markets just before the Hindu festival of Diwali, one of the year's busiest shopping seasons. 
Investigators reportedly raided dozens of small hotels across India's capi­tal looking for possible suspects, and police said "numerous" people were being questioned. 
The attacks came at a particularly sensitive time as India and Pakistan were hashing out an unprecedented agreement to partially open the heav­ily militarized frontier that divides the disputed territory of Kashmir to speed relief to victims of a massive earthquake earli­er this month.

Walking' and sort of saw how she started, it sort of got me thinking how to do this same kind of proj­ect in a classroom setting," Incandela said. "My basic inter­est was to get students to experi­ence some of the things we are talking about in class." 
Incandela created a project in which students can write to death row inmates for one semester. In order to soothe student fears and anxiety about the project, Incandela gives them the option of using pseudonyms and having the letters sent to his office rather than their own mailboxes. At the end of the semester, students write a paper summarizing their experiences and personal growth. Incandela said he hopes this proj­ect allows his students to better understand death row inmates and capital punishment. 
"The purpose of the assignment is not to make students feel sorry for them. Rather, the point is to try to get students to understand the fundamental principle of Catholic Social Thought, and that is that every human being is made in the image and likeness of God," Incandela said. "Every human has a basic dignity that they don't earn by their actions or lose by their actions. On the very basic level, the point is for stu-. dents to see those on death row as persons." 
The project has been highly popular in the eight years that it has been ofl'ered. This semester, 34 out of 45 students have chosen to contact death row inmates. 
Sophomore Maggie Siefert, one of Incandela's students, recently began corresponding with a death row inmate. After receiv­ing two letters from the inmate, Siefert said her opinion on death row has already changed. 
"I realized that a lot of these people have just made one wrong mistake in their lives, and it's a huge factor," she said. "But they are people too. This project helps to get rid of stereotypes." 
Sophomore Ashley Brown, who is also taking the class, said she opted to write to an inmate because of her lack of knowledge on the subject. 
"I chose to do it because it would be interesting to hear from them and get their take on their lives and death row," Brown said. "I realized that they are humans and should be treated as humans." 
Looking back on her experi­ence, senior Nicole Gifford said she appreciates what she learned by corresponding to an inmate. Gifford took the class in fall 2004 and noted how she changed throughout the semester. 
"Prior to the class I wasn't decided [about the death penal­ty]," she said. "I was in the gray area. I thought that if you did a terrible crime then you should be punished. After taking the class, however, I am totally against the death penalty." 
Gifford also said she still has occasional contact with her inmate and writes to him every few months. 
Of all Incandela's students who have participated in the project, however, none has had an experi­ence quite like the senior who requested anonymity. January will mark the three-year anniver­sary of her correspondence with Lee. Writing three-to nine-page letters every three weeks has allowed the student and Lee to establish a level of trust with one another. The senior said she feels free to write to him about her friends, family and life at Saint Mary's. 
"He basically lets me tell him what I want to tell him. He knows that if I want to tell him some­thing specific about my life than I will," she said. "There are enough things to write about that I don't have to tell him all the ins and outs of my life." 
The senior also said she enjoys hearing about Lee's day to day life, and that she was surprised to learn about the many things he has access to. 
"In his cell, he has a television, a word processor and a radio," she said. "They have access to movies and to books." 
Even though Lee has access to life outside his cell, the student said she often feels guilty sharing her experiences with him. 
"I always feel selfish when I write about things that are going on and I try to stay somewhat neutral about what's going on. I feel selfish about writing that because I don't know if he wants to hear about the things he's missing out on," the senior said. "He tells me to not feel selfish because he definitely wants to hear that there is a world going on outside those walls." 
The senior said she and Lee often talk about serious issues, such as religion and fmding God. 
"I tell him that I pray for him every night and he is grateful for those prayers," she said. "He says that he prays for me and my fam­ily too." 
One subject the pen pals do not focus on is Lee's crime. While the senior knows the details of his crime and conviction, she said she does not like to dwell on it. By not focusing on his crime, she said she is able to see Lee as a person rather than a criminal. 
"By looking past his situation, I was able to see that there was more to this person than just a crime," she said. 
One aspect of Lee's personality the senior said she enjoys is his sense of humor. She is also impressed by his ability to stay positive, despite his situation. 
"The one thing that stands out to me over anything is his positive attitude. He is always happy, always laughing. He has an unbe­lievable will to make people laugh and to be positive about his situa­tion," she said. 
While the senior said she admires Lee's attitude and enjoys his correspondence, she also said she knows her boundaries. 
"I look at him like another human being and a friend but there is still that distance I try to keep because I realize the posi­tion he is in," she said. 
She also said although she is not emotionally attached to Lee, she cares for him and prays for him. 
"More than anything else, I want Lee to be at peace with his situation and to find God," she said. 
The senior said while she was initially apprehensive about writ­ing to an inmate, after correspon­ding with Lee her opinions about death row and capital punish­ment have changed. 
"The class and my letters from Lee have completely opened my eyes to capital punishment. I am not for capital punishment like I was before," she said. "I used to think that if you were on death row, you were there for a reason and you deserved to be punished for your actions. Now, I see that there are so many things wrong with the system and I can't sup­port it as is." 
While Lee's future is unknown, the student said she remains posi­tive about her correspondence with him and would eventually like to meet him. 
"I wouldn't be uncomfortable with that situation," she said.

professors on a scale of 1 to 10 in several categories including toughness, teaching quality, accessibility and sense of humor. 
CCI president Scott Palko said the reviews posted on his site are focused on teaching ability and are a reliable resource for students. 
"The reviews themselves are of a pretty high quality," Palko said. "We have no desire to post things about personal idiosyn­crasies of a professor." 
Comments posted on NDToday.com are screened for obscenities and slander, Palko said. Complaints from profes­sors have been far and few between, he said. In fact, the site's operators have been con­tacted by departments checking to make sure that professors were indeed listed. 
Junior accounting major Kevin Johnson said he has con­sulted the Web site for profes­sors for elective courses. With a few exceptions, he said, the evaluations posted on NDToday.com have generally been consistent with what he experienced in the classroom. The more reviews posted, the more accurate the rating, he said. 
"I just look at general reviews of the teachers," Johnson said. "The most important things I look for is the way the class is structured like tests and papers." 
Junior film major Mike Burke also said he has utilized NDToday.com's teacher evalua­tions when enrolling in general education classes. 
"Usually I am looking for good teachers not necessarily the easy ones," Burke said. 
Ratemyprofessor.com, found­ed in 1999 by software engi­neer John Swapceinski, has a similar format to the teacher evaluations found on NDToday.com. It boasts a listing of 5,277 universities and col­leges nation wide with a total of 646,000 professors reviewed. 
The site permits students to rate professors on a scale of one to five in three categories -helpfulness, clarity and easi­ness. They can also post specif­ic comments on workload as well as critique physical appearance using a chili pep­per icon -hot or not. 
The scores for helpfulness and clarity are averaged together to reach an overall quality rating. 
Anthropology professor James McKenna said he was surprised and flattered to learn he topped the list of Notre Dame professors listed on the site -he earned a score of 5. Although he had never heard of raetmyprofessor.com, McKenna said he has always placed a strong emphasis on his rela­tionship with students and reads student evaluations care­fully. 
Despite the flattering reviews, McKenna said he would never be tempted to look up what stu­dents say about him on the site. 
"I would never even think about it," he said emphatically. "I just couldn't do it. It would be like intruding. Perhaps it is not for my use. It is for the stu­dents' use." 
Not all professors are equally as shy about seeing how they rank in the eyes of their stu­dents, however. 
Saint Mary's history professor David Stefancic, who was jok­ingly described by a colleague as the "department monitor" for the Web site, said he likes to keep abreast of what students are saying about him. A good review is flattering, he said, while a bad review probably came from someone he "ticked off along the way." 
Students might feel more at ease to speak truthfully about teachers on the Web site, Stefancic said. 
"They may [be more honest] because this is totally anony­mous," Stefancic said. "Handwriting is distinctive for each student and some might feel intimidated [on traditional evaluations]." 
Junior Jenica Forquer said she would give a more open evaluation on ratemyprofessor.com than on a traditional evaluation for that very reason. 
"I don't know what happens to those course evaluations," Forquer said. "And it is sup­posed to be anonymous, but your handwriting gives you away." 
Saint Mary's history profess.or Bill Svelmoe laughed when he was told he received a 5 out 5 ratihgs and a chili pepper icon on ratemyprofessor.com. 
"Do students have the right to do this and is it a great Web site?" Svelmoe said. "Absolutely." 
However, some professors' overall scores are based on just one or two student reviews, Svelmoe said, and therefore are not statistically accurate and cannot be taken seriously. 
"At the moment I think it is more fun and a good place to start conversations," Svelmoe said. "You might go on the Web site and look up a professor and then go ask friends [about him]." 
Freshman Rachel Peck looked up her professors before arriving at Saint Mary's in August and said it helped her to anticipate what would be expected of her in the class­room. 
"It was positive so I got excit­ed," Peck said. "I wasn't too worried and I thought it was funny that you could read the hotness."

BEIJING -When the Xi'ao Center ol'lice complex wont looking for ten­ants, it hung out a 10-story-high banner boasting bookings by corpo­rate sponsors of the 2008 Olympics: "The Choice ol' Olympic Organizing Committee Partners."

Halloween events give new hope 
Hurricane-ravaged New Orleans finds strength to celebrate holiday 
Associated Press 

NEW OHLEANS -The mar­garita Diane Spieler sips during lwr nocturnal masqueradt~ on Bourbon Street perfectly match­es the glow-in-the-dark green of lwr hideous face, airbrushnd in dreadful detail with reptilian scah1s and skeletal hollows. 
Is she a radioaetivn ghoul'! An alim1 sea snrpnnt? 
"If' somebody asks me, I just tell 'nm I'm Katrina," the 57­year-old New Orleans accountant says, glaring through ghostly pale contact lnnses bnnnath hair moldnd into spikes. "Doesn't it look mean and freaky!" 
'1\vo months after the monster hurricane's horrifying rampage, I lalloween has brought back the French Quarter's thirst for the­atric horror and debauchery, its Mardi Goth mojo in the heart of a eity long known for its rever­enen f!1r voodoo and Anne Rice's glamorously gothic vampire nov­els. 
"Halloween is the best kept loeal secret. It's shoulder-to­shoulder. just like Mardi Gras, but evnrybody's in costume," Spieler said late Saturday, the spooky eelt1bration in full swing two days early. "It's the first big, fun drinking night since the hur­rkann." 
Much of' New Orleans remains a ghost town, but the French Quarter teems with wicked witc~hes and pimps in purple vel­vet. Elvis struts the sidewalk flanked by Supergirl and Marilyn Monroe. An Amazonian blonde's skimpy cop outfit flirl<; with inde­cent exposure. Others sham the Katrina theme, dressing as dis­carded mfrigerators and the blue tarps that cover broken city roofs. 
"Enough dean-up-time for a drink!" says Bobby Hughes, 23, a Loyola University graduate stu­dent sporting a blonde pigtailed wig, a plaid skirt that is too short on his 6-foot-6 frame, and a blouse knotted above his waist that bares traces of a red bra. 

"Helga's my name tonight," says llughes, joined by girlfriend Kat McKibben, a "love bug" with floppy antenna, feather boa, but­terfly wings and fuzzy slippers. "You're hot!" a passing man tells llughes. 
Spared the brunt of Katrina's wrath and the llooding that fol­lowed when levees ruptured, the French Quarter has steadily revived since reopening a month ago. Its bars. restaurant<> and T­shirt shops have been kept afloat by a transient stream of con­struetion workers, relief volun­teers and journalists. 
Trash cans overflow with dis­earded beer cups. Shoes stick to sidewalks lacquered in spilled liquor. Outside the Bourbon Street Blues Company, a woman lifts her shirt in return for a shower of beads tossed from the balcony. 
"Different parts of the city, the Garden District and everything, are not the same at all," said Dawn Carroll, 33, dressed as a "Tool Time" character from the sitcom "11ome Improvement," only with a naughty tool belt. "This makes you think that it's going to come back. It'll be back full-force." 
Bourbon Street may not be kid-friendly and many neighbor­hoods remain too wrecked for door-to-door trick or treating, but children haven't been neg­lected.. 
Outside De La Salle High School in the Garden District, lit­tle Batmen and butterfly-winged fairies fill sacks with chocolate bars and lollipops from bowls on tables lining the sidewalks. Indian braves and cheerleaders dance to zydeco music, oblivious to the downed power lines in the median of St. Charles Avenue.

This was the firth year for Turning Over a New Leaf, and it is one of the biggest serviee projects of the fall. 
"We spent a few weeks plan­ning it," vice president of membership for Circle K Mike Bogacz said. "We try to lind opportunities for large-seale projects on Saturdays. We wanted to try something dif­ferent, something we could get a lot of people involved in." 
In fact, so many people got involved this year that not everyone could get in on the raking. 
"I actually didn't end up doing [any raking! because we didn't have enough rakes," Bogacz said. "It was no big deal as long as all the mem­hers got to do it." 
The groups fell only a few rakes short of' accommodating everyone, but as it turnml out. volunteers did morn than just raking due to a lack of fallen leaves, which was the only real drawback of' the event. organizers said. 
''I'd say the only problem would be that the ll~aves aren't falling as early as they usually do because of the warmer weather, but I think that people found plenty of' other yard work to do, like pulling weeds and straighten­ing up around people's yards," Hufl'ner said. 
The event was about more than yard work, Brusky said. It was about making sure no one in the area feels left out. 
"Any time students are visi­ble in the community, that is important," she said.

Voters set to address gay rights, abortion 
Polls to open in several statesfor Nov. 8elections 
Associated Press 

Gay rights, teen abortion, Arnold Schwarzenegger's prestige. These and other volatile topics are adding spice to off-year elections in seven states where voters will be considering statewide bal­lot measures on Nov. 8. 
As is often the case, California has the most intriguing mix of propositions -including four backed by Schwarzenegger, the Republican governor, to curb the power of the Democratic­controlled Legislature and the state's public employee unions. Another measure, notable in a state with liberal leanings, would require par­ents to be notified when a minor seeks an abortion. 
Texas voters are expected to approve a proposed constitu­tional ban on same-sex mar­riages -a step already taken in 18 other states. In Maine, a conservative alliance is urging voters to quash a new law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
In Republican-controlled Ohio, site of bitter wrangling in the 2004 presidential elec­tion, four election overhaul measures backed by Democratic-leaning groups are on the ballot. Voters will be asked if bipartisan boards, instead of elected officials, should draw lawmakers' dis­tricts and oversee elections; whether campaign contribu­tion limits should be lowered: and whether all voters should be allowed to vote early by mail. 
Doctors and lawyers in Washington state are spend­ing heavily to support rival measures dealing with med­ical malpractice. The one backed by doctors would place a cap on certain types of jury awards aud limit lawyers' fees. The lawyers' proposal would create a state-run sup­plemental malpractice insur­ance program, and allow doe­tors' licenses to be revoked after three malpractice ver­dicts against them within I 0 years. 
Other mnasures in 
Washington would ban smok­ing in public areas and indqor workplaces, and overturn the Legislature's gas-tax hikn of 
9.5 cents a gallon. 

New Jersey voters will decide whether the statc1 should have an elected lieu­tenant governor to take over if a sitting governor leaves ollien early. The measure is a response to the sex scandal that drove former Gov. JamPs McGreevey from office and installed Snnate President Hichard Codey as acting gov­ernor even as he retained his Senate duties. New Jersey is one of eight states with no lieutenant governor. 
Voters in New York are being asked to approve a $2.9 billion transportation bond and a measure that would give the Legislature, not tlw govt'lrnor, the uppnr hand in writing a budget. 
In Texas. the proposed gay­marriage ban is the only high­prof11e statewide item on the ballot. and both sidns arn con­cerned about possibln low voter turnout. 
"We think thn vast majority of people in Texas are with us but that doesn't help if tlwy don't show up," said Kelly Shackelford of the Liberty Legal Institutn, which sup­ports the ban. 
Gay-rights activists opposing the ban have produced televi­sion ads featuring direct appeals by same-sex couples for marriage rights . 
"We are not second-elass citizens, and we nend the same resources and rights available to heterosexual cou­ples to protect our families," said the Hev. Carolyn Mobley, an associate pastor at the Hesurreetion Metropolitan Community Church, appearing with her partner in orw of' the ads. 
Massaehusntts is the only state allowing suc:h marriag11s: Vnrmont and Conn11c:tic:ut have approved same-sex civil unions. T11xas law already prohibits same-sex marriagc1s, but support11rs of tiH~ amerHI­ment say a constitutional ban would guard that law from judicial challenges.

Don't be a Halloweeny 
Well, your roommate is wearing a dress and clown makeup, so it must be Halloween again. What's that? He wears that everyday? Oh. Well, it's still Halloween today. 
Halloween follows the proud traditions of American holidays, in that the main focus is the fattening of the American pop­ulace. Thanksgiving -let's have some turkey. Memorial Day 


-who wants a hot 

Peter 
dog? Fourth of July 

Schroeder 
-who wants to blow stuff up and then Jtl!lll Write for have a hot dog? St. Food Patrick's Day-beer is too a food! Many of these holidays hide their gorging roots behind things like patriotism and green food coloring, but not Halloween. Halloween says, "Screw that, let's just have everyone everywhere give out candy for free. What, you want cos­tumes? Sure, we can have costumes." 
When we were children, we'd gladly apply the regalia of princesses and hobos to get bite-sized Milky Way candy bars, and today, we gladly apply the dress of whatever was cheap at Target in order to go out and consume alcohol, because everyone knows that you can't drink on Halloween unless you're wear­ing something insane people wear the other 364 days of the year. 
But we all gladly slap on the makeup and rubber masks that make us feel like our face is in the Everglades, so yes, you do need a costume. Nobody buys that "My Costume Is A Poor College Kid" or "My Costume Is A Guy In A Red Shirt." You're not fooling anybody, get a cos-tume. 
But what costume to wear? If you're a girl, it's quite simple: take a regular cos­tume, and sexy-cize it. That cowgirl can't herd cattle unless her midriff is showing and she keeps the sun out of her eyes with her sequin-festooned ten-gallon hat. This nurse can't change a bedpan unless her white pleather dress is tight enough to restrict any normal human movement. How could this maid, who happens to be French. possibly clean toi­lets without her fishnet stockings and lace? And this cat, well, that's just one sexy cat, I'd let her scratch my furniture and then relieve herself in a little box full of sand any day. Everyone knows that Halloween is the one day of the year that a girl can dress like a stripper and get away with it. Alas, my efforts to change the holiday into a month-long celebration ala Hamadan have come up short. 
For the dudes, proper Halloween cos­tuming may require a little bit more cre­ativity. There is one rule to live by, though; any costume that takes over five words to explain is a bad idea. Obtuse costumes are a bad idea for both you and me. For you, you'll get sick of yelling over party sounds the exact same expla­nation dozens of times a night. For me, I really just don't want to listen to you for that long. Put a white sheet with some eyeholes over your head if you're going to be complicated, then you won't even need to explain yourself. Even if you do have to explain your costume for the blind and the stupid, it's simple, ''I'm a ghost." 
Clever commentaries on big events are good ideas for costumes, but you have to make sure the timing is right. It's proba­bly a bit too soon for that Hurricane Katrina costume, but the Flu Plague of 1918 is fair game. Also, make sure that your timely costume isn't too obscure. Everyone can pick out a Monica Lewinsky or a Saddam Hussein, but peo­ple may not realize that your costume is a scathing representation of former Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers. You still might manage to win "Most Terrifying Mask," however. 
A favorite costume idea of mine is just something big and dumb, something that screams ''I'M WEARING A COSTUME." Sure, go as an ice cream cone or a pumpkin. Everybody knows what you are, the garishness of it all makes you the life of the party, and best of all, you get to be an ice cream cone or a pump­kin. With these types of costumes, you don't have to worry about being clever or too subtle, you are what you arc. 
Some people have problems with Halloween because of its Pagan roots, but I say to these critics, "Critics, if the Pagan religion includes fun-sized pack­ages of M&M's and Snickers, and I get to dress up like a vampire, hobo, or former Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers, heck, I'll be a Pagan for one night." 
Halloween is a great time for everyone involved, but remember to keep it in moderation. Don't eat too much candy and don't drink too much if you're an adult, because nobody, young or old, likes a vomiting Power Hanger. So get out there, boys and girls, and have some fun tonight. Don't forget your reflective tape.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Understanding sensitivity and tolerance 
We all know Halloween is supposed to be a time to let down your guard and to allow your real personality shine through. With this in mind, I looked forward to the Halloween weekend, ready to unload my mind and gorge on candy. 
So my weekend started on Thursday, when I attended the Student Comedy Show at Legends. I was a little skeptical about the show, not exactly sure if my abs were going to get their much-needed workout from laughter, or if my hands were just going to deliver whimpy applause all night. Things were going great, I even caught myself chuckling at times, until one "come­dian" mentioned the death of Hosa Parks. Instantly I became confused; I thought I was at a comedy show, and I could not fathom how the death of Hosa Parks would fit into his sequence. It was not until I heard the laughter that followed the "Thanks to Hosa Parks, blacks can sit in the front of the dining hall" that I froze and start~d around the room. TI liS was comedy? This warranted the jocular laughter I heard? 
Do not get me wrong -I am not trying to shoot daggers at the person who made this crude "joke." Instead, I am attacking every single person in that room who did not have the gall to stop and think for two seconds and say, "Hey, that's not cooL" 
But hey, that was only Thursday. The weekend was just beginning. 
Friday night approached, and a few friends and I stopped by a party to try and be "cool Notre Dame kids." The party was kind of wild-I think I even saw Michael Jackson there-and my impressions of Notre Dame started to ascend again, making up for the significant dip it took from the night before. It was 
then I spotted two people, one dressed as Hurricane Katrina . and the other one as the victim of the hurricane. As the 
imposter "Hurricane Katrina" ran around making "wooshing" 
noises, I froze and looked around, feeling a tad bit of deja vu. 
However, everyone was busy laughing and having a good time. 
No one took the time to wrinkle a brow or shake their head, 
and I could not believe the insensitivity that was displayed again 
by my peers. 
I entered this University as a non-Catholic, minority, liberal­
minded female VEHY apprehensive about my next four years at 
such a conservative learning institution. However, I realized 
that despite my differences, there still is, or I was led to believe, 
a common human morality that any person -black, white, 
short, tall -should be sensitive towards. I sec the diversity 
campaigns on campus-the bracelets, the seminars, the inven­
tion of new departments -to try and solve this perpetual prob­
lem of why race matters, but from two days out of my four 
months at Notre Dame, I must say I think we have a bigger 
issue at hand. If we are going to try and promote students to act 
with sensitivity and tolerance towards issues on campus, I think 
it may help if students know what those words mean.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Students lack respect for community and law 
South Bend owes no debt 

I am extremely frustrated. After reading the article "Baron wants better ND-city relations," I cannot help but be saddened by the situation. The students who received eviction notices did so because thny broke the law; the city of South Bend owes them nothing, and it's absolutely ridiculous to think that it should. Spnaking as both an ND student and as a resident of the South Bend area, I lind it completely degrading that my fellow students call people in this city "uneducated, low-aspir­ing, low-achieving, but generally nice." There is a high per­e,~ntagn of pnople who live here who are well-educated, high­aspiring and high-aehieving, and who are more than "general­ly niee." Ilow can students who perceive themselves to be wnll-educated make remarks like this? The city may not meet every single need that Notre Dame students require, but it has enough to offer. These students' taetlessness unfortunately puts a stigma on the rest of the student body, and it is no won­der to me why many South Bend residents often have such poor opinions of students. 
Lindsay Poulin sophomore Walsh Oct. 28 


Not in my backyard 
Thn rnportml reaction of the eurrent student body president to tlw eviction notices reeeived by students doonwd responsible for hosting a gathering that led to I00 policn dtations for underage drinking falls far short of adult standards of common sense. 
The claim that Notre Dame students need two chances to learn that providing (cheap or oven free) alcohol to (a very large number on minors is against the law, and that law-breaking on the premises is a lease breaker for any responsible landlord, is incredi­ble. 
The claim that South Bend has in loco parentis responsibilities for students, some of whom have cho­sen to live in South Bend specifically to avoid on-cam­pus scrutiny of alcohol consumption, beggars the imagination. Why would anyone but a student body 
U-WIRE 
sycophant say that? 
But the further suggestion (by a student leader?) that the likely student response to the eviction notices sent by the management of Turtle Creek Apartments will be to abandon that venue in search of more toler­ant landlords ehills the blood. I hope there are no such landlords in the South Bend neighborhoods where live of my grandchildren are· growing toward responsible adulthood. In truth, I hope there are no such landlords anywhere in my adopted hometown.

America: the global culture 
I got an e-mail this week from a friniHI going to school in Chicago, and she want11d to make sure that I had gottnn the news about the World Series. She's one of those metro-sox­uals, that is, a Cubs fan that has, Elizabeth overnight, mor­Meyer plwd into a White Sox fan, hncause, OSUDaily wnll, let's be rnal­Barometer 
istie. Oregon State I tried to explain University her excitement to my host family and got a blank stare. Finally, I tried to create an analogy that would make sense. "They haven't had a team in the World Series since the 1950s. It's like Ecuador and the World Cup." (Ecuador just qualified for their sec­ond ever appearance). Then they asked me how many countries were in the World Series. "The United States. And I think thern arn some Canadian teams." "I low is it the World Series if the world doesn't compete?" The truth is, baseball isn't that popular hero. Soceer is the big sport. Talking to a professor, I learned one of the grnat ironies. The two Latin American countries who play the most baseball are Cuba and Venezuela. These also are two of the most anti-Amnrkan countries in Latin Amnriea. The two countries that have sitting 
leaders who survived U.S. assassina­tion or coup attempts are the two countries drawn to a uniquely American sport. 
Much of the world has adopted American culture but rejected America. Ecuador seems to be the Island of Unwanted Songs, where the 
U.S. sends all of the COs that don't sell. I can't eat lunch without hear­ing Celine Dion, or "I Just Called to Say I Love You." 
American culture is being sold right alongside the Che Guevara shirts and posters. And not just American culture, but the U.S. as a whole. Ecuador, in the midst of an inflation crisis, dollarized their econ­omy, and now rely on U.S. economic policy for the value of their currency. They're an oil-exporting country, which means that U.S. energy policy will affeet whether or not they have money to run the schools. 
And Ecuador isn't the only country that looks to U.S. policy to see where they stand in the world. Throughout the free trade debate, Americans tend to focus on what free trade does to American factories and American jobs. Lost in the debate is what free trade does to the rest of the world. 
Just look at American subsidies to our "family" farms. Of course, in today's world, by family, I mean Monsanto, and other corporate farms. By subsidizing farming in the U.S., we can produce grain and rice cheaper, whieh means that when we sell it overseas, the local producers can't compete. Here in Ecuador, an 
increase in the popularity of wheat 
actually led to a decrease in domes­
tic wheat production, as local pro­
ducers couldn't compete with subsi­dized wheat coming out of Europe 
and the U.S. Most of the domestic 
products are for export-coffee, 
bananas and oil. 
As Americans we can't deny that we are connected to the world. Since the end of World War II, we have spread throughout the world, estab­lishing ourselves in developing nations. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, we have become the world's only superpower, although the EU is rising to a close second. The result of our quest for superpower? The world is now connected to us, and we are connected to the world. Even the parts of the world whose leaders despise us still embrace our culture.

Remarks insulting 
I would just like to say that in response to the artiele, "Baron wants better NI>-city relations" in The Observer on Oct. 27, I am absolutely appalled at the statements quoted in the paper by a few of the ND students. These students referred to people in the South Bend communi­ty as being "uneducated, low-aspiring, low­achieving." This is absolutely insulting bnhav­ior and these quotes reflect more than just a few students' views from what I have experi­enced. Who arn these students to make huge, inaccurate assumptions about the pnopln in this city? 
By making these assumptions, studnnts not only insult every single person who works here at the University besides professors, but they also insult students who attend Notre Dame with any amount of financial aid. It is a direct slap in hard-working people's faces. It is incredible to me how students who attend one of the leading universities in this country could be that unintelligent and that lacking in any sort of common respect and dass. Just because people may not have the amount of money as a lot of the students here does not mnan in any possible way that these people they don't work just as hard as any student, if not harder, on this campus. 
The problem with the relations between ND and the South Bend Community rnsts on tlw University's students. What kind of d1ange do the students expect to be able to make in this world if they can't even respect thn pnople who help Notre Dame work? Ilow do they think they'll succeed in life if they can't get along with anyone who isn't on their income level or who have the same "elass?" It is even more dis­turbing to hear these types of sentiments being made because this is a predominantly Catholic university. I am truly embarrassed for Notre Dame and for the entire student body.

English clubbing from the inside 
As an Englishman abroad, it is dear that [Viewpoint columnist Peter) Wicks is spend­ing rather too much time abroad, and when he is in his native land he seems to opt to spend his leisure time in vnnues that would not be easily categorized as "dubs." It is lamentable, therefore, that such an ill­informed Englishman should comment on "modern dancing." 
Wicks is correct to identify modern dub­bing as a fundamentally solitary aetivity. To suggest that only women have the eapaeity to interact with music in a way that suggests a heightened connectivity with the musk is bizarre and utterly false. Contnmporary clubbing is all about connecting the individ­ual with the music through the genius of the DJ who lifts the crowd before lowering it according to thfl beats of the music and his ability to mix songs competently. The eon­temporary clubber is often blissfully unaware of his/her surroundings and evnn other clubbers, such is thfl power of this con­nectivity. 
Clearly the popularity of certain recre­ational drugs is linked to connecting to the musie in major clubs, something which Wicks fails to appreciatn. In short, ahead of further commentaries on popular eulture, it would be helpful if the writer had some basic understanding of the culture and the venues where this culture is voraciously eonsunwd.

Tlwn~ have been many grnat horror lilms over the YIHtrs. In 196S, Homan Polanski released the film "J!osmnary's Baby." Centered on the fi1:tional character. Hosemary Woodhousn, il is a disturbing tale that dPals with ideo­logical tlwmes.

It was a well-crafted, sus­penseful tale of a young girl poten­tially possessnd by demons. Like "Hosemary's Baby," the film is entrenched in n~ligious lwliefs and ideology. 
The potential hnro for the film, Fathnr Lancaster Morrin, is a trou­
bled cleric who may not be up to the task of saving the young girl. 
The film may not be considered incredibly scary by today's standards, especially by any horror film fanatic. There have been so many derivatives and knock-offs during the years that the original has become a diluted shadow of its former shelf. However, for someone not well versed in the realm of horror, "The Exorcist" is an excellent starting point.

llownvnr, despite these limitations, it became one ol' tho most influential horror movies ever. 
;\ large part ol' its effectiveness arose !'rom its memorable and unique soundtrack. Composed by Carpenter and a l'nw of his friends, the film's theme song has become a staple of the Halloween 
direeting "The Fog" in 
1980. However, it wasn't until 1982 that he released what many consider to be his masterpiece. "The Thing" was financially a l'ailure, being released near the same time as "E.T." but has since rose to a cult sta­tus over DVD and video. 
The film chronicles the events of American Outpost 31, and its twelve members. Life is boring and mun­dane for them, but the appearance of a dog that is more than it seems changes everything. 
Everything about this movie has stood the test of time. The shot com­position, the musical score, even the special effects stand up well to today's standards. Because computer effects and stop-motion didn't appear real enough to Carpenter, he employed a young Hob Bottin to ere­ate the most realistic, gory effects ever seen, essentially creating a benchmark in the genre. 
Stephen King is a staple of the world of literary horror, but his film 
adaptations haven't 
held the same impact. 
Fortunately, Stanley 
(Nicholson) is charged 
with maintaining the hotel through the winter, along with his wife and son. As the winter pro­gresses however, cabin fever and the ghosts of the Overlook begin to play on their minds, with disastrous con­sequences. 
The later remake was more true to King's original work, but Nicholson's performance alone raises the original into greatness. 
Wes Craven is another established name in the realm of horror. lil'Lving helmed the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series, as well as "The People Under the Stairs" and the recently released "Hed Eye," Craven has become a staple for Halloween activi­ties. 
His movie "Scream," released in 1996, reinvented the dying slasher genre and made popular a new hor­ror icon. 
Halloween only comes around once a year, so make the best of it and participate in the festivities by watch­ing some classic horror movies.

SMC CROSS COUNTRY 
Otto, Feauto pace Saint Mary's at MIAA meet 
By KEN FOWLER 
Sports Writer 
Sara Otto and Becky Feauto led the Belles to their best-ever fmish at the MIAA Championship Meet Saturday, as Saint Mary's fin­ished fifth in the six-kilometer race hosted by Kalamazoo College in Three Rivers, Mich. 
Two weeks after setting per­sonal records in their final 5-kilo­meter race of the season, Otto and Feauto once again turned in strong performances for the team. 
The junior Otto finished No. 26 overall with a time of 24:15. 
Feauto, a senior, crossed the line just two seconds later, good for 
No. 29 in the race. 
"I felt pretty good," Feauto said. "We kept up with [the packs we wanted] ... and I was able to finish strong." 
Otto and Feauto both improved dramatically over their finishes in last year's MIAA Championship, hosted by Calvin College. Otto fin­ished No. 62 there, and Feauto came in No. 70. 
Both showed potential earlier this season in the MIAA Jamboree, where Otto and Feauto finished No. 28 and No. 29, respectively. 
The two have now placed one-two for Saint Mary's in each of its. seven races this season, but the gap between those two and their teammates has shrunk. 

Before the race, Belles head coach Jackie Bauters said she thought her two top runners would lead her team in the 6­kilometer race. 
"I think they probably will fin­ish one-two," Bauters said. "But I don't think the 3-4's will be too far behind." 
She was right. Junior Katie White ran a 24:45, and freshman Kelly Biedron finished fourth for the Belles at 25:02. 
White's time was a strong improvement, as she completed the 6k-course four minutes quicker than her time in her last 5-kilometer race, 20:45. 
Her pace in the longer race was nearly two seconds-per-kilo­meter faster than her previous best 5-K. 
For Feauto, though her pace was slightly slower this week than during her 19:59 5-K two weeks ago, the race was a suc­cess. 
"We don't have many [6-K races]. so it's kind of hard to compare times," she said. "We were really happy about [the fifth-place fmish]." 
Saint Mary's previous best fin­ish in the conference champi­onship was sixth. This year, the Belles' team score of 163 beat Olivet (170), Alma (183), Adrian 
(227) and Tri-State (257). 
Saint Mary's main competition in the top four, the host Hornets, staved off the Belles and fmished fourth with a team score of 116. 
With a team score of 22, Calvin reclaimed the league trophy from Hope, which ended Calvin's streak of 16 consecutive league titles in 2004. 
Hope finished second with 61 points. With a team score of 71, Albion rounded ljiUt the top three.

Irish lose to No. 8 Cal, No.15 Purdue 


THE NANOVIC INSTITUTE FOR EUROPEAN STUDIES 
Team upbeat despite pair ofclose losses to highly-ranked teams 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 
The women's swimming and diving team proved it could hang with the best talent in the country this weekend. 
The Irish competed with No. 8 ranked California-Berkeley down to the last event Friday night at home. 
Then, the Notre Dame shifted its focus immediately to a closely contested Saturday meet with rival Purdue in West Lafayette, Ind. 
Against California, the Irish needed a first-and second­
During the weekend, the Irish were hurt by their inabili­ty to touch out -or stretch for the finish. 
While the number of first and second place finishes were close in both meets, both Cal and Purdue consistently took home third and fourth place, giving them the precious points that led to their victories. 
There were many positives for the team, most notably the swimming of junior Katie Carroll, who won six events over the weekend. 
Those events included a school record against Cal with a time of 1:48.79 in the 200­freestyle. Another positive for the Irish was the performance of the new freshmen class which, between them, account­ed for three first-place finishes 
and one second­
place finish.

The Irish had little time to reflect on their positive per­formance against Cal as they faced a motivated Purdue team on Saturday. 
Notre Dame was not able to put together as strong an effort, as Purdue won the meet 172-128. 
Notre Dame pulled as close as 127-118, but Purdue put the meet out of reach by taking first and second place in both of the diving events. 
"We might have been a little tired against Purdue coming off of the Cal meet, and we also missed the home pool advantage that we had against Cal," junior Jessica Stephens said.

"We've been looking forward to this weekend for a while as we knew that Cal would be tough, but we realized that we're at their caliber," Carroll said. "We have the talent, we have the potential and we have the coaches to bring us to their caliber." 
The Irish will look to carry their newfound confidence with them when they open Big East play in their next meet Friday at Pittsburgh. 
"We've had some really great swims so far," Carroll said. "We're right where we want to be at this point."

Irish fall to Boilermakers 
NO cannot hold early lead as Purdue beats upset-minded squad 
By JACK THORNTON Spons Writer 
Tlw No. 11J Irish fpll to Purdue in WPst l.afayPtte, Ind. Saturday, as the No. 15 BoilnrmakPrs took advantage of an oarly load to run away with tho dual moot, 1 H2-118. 
Artnr a strong L!1am perform­ance in the 200-yard mndlny to hngin the moot, sophomoro Jay VandtHl Berg and junior Tnd Brown put the Irish on top 30­25 with vit:tories in the 1,000­yard rrnestylo and the 2(l0-yard frtH~styln, rospectively. 
lligher-ratnd Purdue, howev­nr, eame roaring back. 
Purdue's swimmors took the first place spot in the nnxt three nvnnts and sandwiched three more wins around Notrn Damn junior Louis Cavadini's 50-yard lhnstyle vidory to take a total of six or tlw next seven events. 
Wins in the 500-yard fn~estyle and I00-yard buttmlly helped put tlw Irish baek within eon­tenlion, but Purdue ended the match on a 5H-16 run to earn the win. 
"We got ourselves into a little bit of a hole a little early," snn­ior eo-captain Patrick I IefTernan said. "I think we weren't raeing where we did a wenk ago. The effort was there but just the times weren't going our away." 
Notre Dame has never beaten Purdue during the Tim Welsh era, but after dominating the DPnnis Starks Helays and taking down Texas A&M, the Irish worn eonfidnnt they eould final­ly upend their cross-state rivals. 
"We really thought we had a good chance to upset a team that was ranked higher than us -just from their times early last year," junior Tim Kegelman said. "They swam better, and we didn't swim up to our poten­tial, so it didn't make for the best situation." 
There were a few bright spots for Notre Dame at the meet. 
Most notably, Vanden Berg continued his impressive start by ratcheting two victories on the al'ternoon, also taking the 500-yard freestyle. 
"Jay Vanden Berg did swim fast overall, he's been swim­ming fast all year, and he's been solid winning those distance events," said Kegelman, who got his first win of the season in the 1 00-yard butterfly. "Graham Parker also had a great breast­stroke -he really stepped up in that one -and .lame Lutkus had a pretty fast 400 medley." 

The Irish have a week to recover from the loss before their matchup with Big East rival Pittsburgh this Friday. Notre Dame defeated the Panthers in meets twiee last year, ending Pittsburgh's run of eight straight conference cham­pionships. 
"We're heading into Pittsburgh, whieh is our biggest rivalry, so I think we'll just bring a lot more intensity and a little more focus and we'll just be better prepared to race," Heffernan said. 
Looking on the bright side, Kegelman said the loss gives the Irish motivation to work harder. 
"We should definitely realize there are lots of places to improve and that'll probably keep us focused during prac­tice," Kegelman said.

Bears top host Lions, take over NFC North 
Associated Press 
DETHOIT -With the NFC North up for grabs, thn Chicago Bears snatched con­trol. 
Charles Tillman intercepted Jeff Garcia's across-the-body pass and returned it 22 yards for a touchdown with H:43 left in overtime Sunday, putting Chicago atop the division with a 19-13 win over the Detroit Lions. 
Garcia, making his second start in place of Joey Harrington, rolled right and tried to throw back aeross the field to Mike Williams. 
Garcia was 23-for-35 for 197 yards with an intercep­tion. 
The Bears led 1:~-3 at half­time, then the Lions had con­secutive seoring drives to tie the game with 1:~:20 lnl't in the game. 
Thomas Jones fumbled on the ensuing drive at Detroit's 2H, thnn the Lions caught a huge break on the next play. 
With Brian Urlacher draped on him, Garcia was flagged for intentional grounding when the Bears thought he threw a latnral that li111~baeker lluntnr Ilillenmeyer picked up and returned for a score. Tlw

"The ball was floating," Tillman said. "But my eyes weren't big until I caught it and knew I would score." 
It was a big win for Chicago (4-3) not only because the Bears broke a first-place tin with Detroit (3-4), but also bncause they secured a head­to-head tiebreaker over the Lions, whom they beat 3H-6 in an earlier meeting. 
"This is my third year in the league and it's my first time in first place,'' Tillman said. "It's feeling pretty good. I'm going to savor the moment." 
Meanwhile, Garcia regretted trying to make plays that weren't there. 
The 35-year-old quarter­back was bailed out after one ill-advised play in the fourth quarter, then the Bears burned him on another in overtime. 
"This was an emotional game," said a distraught­sounding Garcia. "You battle for 60-plus minutes, and it falls on your shoulders to make a play, and you don't do it. Hight now, it hurts."

"llow about those Bears! What a great game!" Bears coach Lovin Smith said. "To get over the hump and gnt to the next levnl, you have to win a game like this on the road."

Team shuts down visiting Pirates, 4-0 
By KEVIN BRENNAN 
Sports Writer 
Badly needing a win, Notre Dame defeated No. 16 Seton I!all 4-0 Saturday in its final regular season game. 
The win moved Notre Dame's record to 10-6-2 overall and 6-4-1 in the Big East and signil"icantly bol­stered the team's chance of receiving an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. 
"That was a terrific team performance," Notre Dame 
Lapira headed the ball in off of a long cross from Martin, putting Notre Dame on top 4-0. 

With the two goals and one assist, Lapira recorded five points on the night. The for-· ward leads the Irish with 15 points on tho year. 
Junior Midfielder Nate Norman, who sat out Saturday's game with an injury, has the second most points with nine.

the Pirates. Senior

Dike took a pass from for­ward Joe Lapira, beat one Seton Hall defender and fired a shot past goalkeeper Boris Pardo for the score. 
"IIe brings so mueh energy to the team," Clark said. "He's a phenomenal athlete." 
In the second half, the Notre Dame offense exploded. Four minutes into the period, Lapira scored to stretch the Irish advantage to 2-0. 
Midfielders Matt Besler and Kurt Martin were both credit­ed with assists on the play. 
Two minutes later, Besler added another assist. The freshman found junior defender Ryan Miller on the right side of the box. Miller sent a shot past Pardo for his first career goal.

on the field for 
their last regular season home game. 
"It was very satisfying to get all the seniors on the field for good periods of time," Clark said. "I've not been able to do that right through so it was terrific to be able to do that." 
The win was vital for Notre Dame in terms of its NCAA Tournament chances. 
If the Irish do not win the Big East Tournament and thus secure an automatic bid, they must hope for an at­large invitation. 
"That's another great win when you're looking to get into the NCAA tournament," Clark said. "I think we get another win on top of that and I think we're almost a lock. So that was a very important game for us." 
Notre Dame will host a first round Big East tournament game Wednesday. The oppo­nent for the game has yet to be determined.

Bock made the pass, and the freshman picknd up goal No. 21 on the season. 
Thorlakson said the play was the rnsult of good movement by the Irish away from the main action. 
"There was just a lot of good movPmcnt ofT the ball today," the senior said. 
lrirsh coach Handy Waldrum attributed the goal to focus dur­ing the week and adjusting prac­tice pattnrns to live-game situa­tions. 
"W1~ work on little patterns and sequences like that," he said. The Irish kept on attacking after taking the lead, with eight 
shol'i on goal and a corner kick in the ten minutes following Hanks' score. 
The fast-paced action forced both teams to substitute many of their starters in the first half after the intense opening 25 minutes. Waldrum said Notre Dame's pro­ductive bench and good condi­tioning gave the Irish a decided advantage. 
"One thing is our kids work really hard," he said. "We're as lit as any team in the country. And when you can get your second team in land be productive] ... you can stay at a high-tempo pace." 
Notre Dame attempted 29 shot'> to Georgetown's two and con­stantly redirected Hoya goal kicks back into Georgetown's territory, keeping the IIoya defense on its heels. 

By halftime, the Irish had an 8­0 advantage in shots on goal but only a 2-0 lead after Thorlakson and sophomore Amanda Cinalli assisted on Jen Buczkowski's fifth goal of the season. Thorlakson took a pass from Cinalli and led Buczkowski on the left side. The junior midfielder made a move and beat 1-loya goalkeeper Jade Higgins to the left side at 22:22. 
Higgins was the main reason Georgetown remained in the con­test as long as it did. The sopho­more made several key saves in the first half that kept the Hoyas' deficit at just two despite the relentless Irish attack, including a diving kicksave on a Thorlakson shot midway through the period. 
Ashley Jones netted her first goal of the year and opened the scoring for the Irish in the second half with a blast from the right wing at 54:30 to give Notre Dame a 3-0 lead. 
Thirteen minutes later, Hanks and Thorlakson scored just 17 seconds apart to put the game out of reach at 5-0. 
"[The quick tempo! is fun," Thorlakson said. "It's harder in a slow-paced game to get into your rhythm." 
Georgetown failed to find an offensive rhythm and mount a serious offensive attack during the game, as the Irish swarmed the ball after each turnover to the I-Ioyas and prevented Georgetown from moving up field with ease. 
Waldrum said the forward Thorlakson was a key component in the Irish defense to the extent that she helped the Irish regain possession on several occasions. 
"[Thorlakson] adds a whole dif­ferent dimension to the game," 
Waldrum said. "She's a 90­minute player." Thorlakson credited the defense. 
"!Defenders Christie! Shaner and !Carrie] Dew and Kim ~Lo~~mzen I : .. all did an amazing JOb, she smd. 
The pressure from the Irish for­wards and strong defensive com­munication limited Georgetown's offensive chances. In all, Georgetown managed just one shot on goal, and Irish keeper Lauren Karas saved Shara McNeill's kick from the right side. 
Beth Koloup found the net for the second time this season with just over two minutes remaining to extend Notre Dame's ll\ad to il'> fmal margin, 6-0.

Irish Coach Martin Stone thought his team made progress this weekend, but not to the point that he had hoped. 
"Most boats had better rows than yesterday," Stone said, refer­ring to Sunday's race. "We're try­ing to get back to where we were before fall break, and we didn't make it. We were close, but not baek there yet, we still need more sharpness." 
He said this weekend's races provided his team with some great experience, and the team must now get ready for the spring. 
"If you take a look back, we are definitely closer to some of the other top schools this year than we were last year, and that gives us something to build on," Stone

3:59 into the second period, when junior right wing Michael Bartlett stole the puck in the Princeton zone and passed to Erik Condra. Condra's shot deflected off to the side, but freshman· Garrett Hegan put the rebound home. 
"The guy picked up the puck and was going up the ice. I saw that I had an opportunity, so I hit him and then we got a shot on net and the freshman put in the rebound," Bartlett said. 
At the time of Hegan's goal, Notre Dame had just returned to full strength after consecutive penalties by Condra and Noah Babin left them at a two-man disadvantage. Although the Tigers peppered the Irish net with shots for nearly two min­utes, Pearce and the rest of the defense did not allow a goal. 
"You always give up lots of r.hances in 5-on-3, but we played really well in [penalty killing]," Pearce said. 
Notre Dame picked up a sec­ond goal on the power play at the 16:13 mark of the second period. Barlett set up Mark Van Guilder to the left of the net. Van Guilder, shooting from a severe angle, snuck the puck behind Princeton goalie Eric Laroux. 
"The seams were open because their forwards were lazy, so I found [Van Guilder] and he put it in," Bartlett said. 
The Irish outshot the Tigers 30-27, the second time in as many nights they had the advan­tage in shots on goal. 
Princeton 5, Notre Dame 3 
The Irish gave up an early lead in Friday night's game to drop their regular season home open­er decision to the Tigers. 
Princeton capitalized on sever­al Notre Dame penalties to shift a 2-1 Irish lead early in the sec­ond stanza into a 4-2 Princeton advantage by the end of the period. 
A holding call on the freshman Regan at 6:50 into the second led to a Princeton power play goal by Grant Goeckner-Zoeller (2 goals), with the assist credited to Kevin Westgarth (3 assists). 
Goeckner-Zoeller found plenty of space on the left side to maneuver into the Notre Dame zone and rip a shot past the goaltender Brown at the 7:06 mark for the 2-2 tie. 
Notre Dame defenseinan Brock Sheahan was whistled for an obstruction-hooking call at the time of the goal, and the Irish found themselves down a man once again. 
Princeton struck only 21 sec­onds later on a Westgarth shot taken from the point that rebounded to center Patrick Neundorfer, who tucked the puck past Brown for a 3-2 Tigers lead. 
The Tigers made it 4-2 on an Irish turnover. A badly timed drop pass while entering the Tigers' zone created a Princeton 3-on-none for an Erik Pridham goal at 12:20. 
"I think we did okay in the sec­ond period, but a couple of mis­takes ended up in our net and we just imploded," Jackson said. "I've never seen anything like that before in my coaching career. The whole game just turned totally around." 
The frrst period ended in a 1-1

tie after both teams scored with­in a 10-second span of each other. Princeton got on the board first on Goeckner-Zoeller and Westgarth's first hookup of the night. 
The Irish wasted no time in answering after Van Guilder drew a faceoff to winger Tim Wallace. Wallace walked in on net and roofed the puck past Tigers goalie B.J. Sklapsky for the goal. 
Wallace scored his second goal of the game 5:07 into the second period to give the Irish a 2-1 lead, with an assist from Matt Amado. Wallace received a crisp cross-ice pass from Amado on a three-on-two rush to bury the goal. 
"Timmy Wallace, that was his best effort so far this season," Jackson said. "I mean not 


the goals per se, but it's good to see him have a real solid game." 
Princeton notched its last goal at 18:31 in the third period on an odd-man rush from defense­man Kyle Hagel, assisted by Pridham. 
The Irish struggled on the power play, going 0-for-10 with 23 total penalty minutes on the Tigers. Princeton went 2-for-7 in similar situations. 
"We were much sharper with our special teams tonight even though our power play still has the inability to finish," Jackson said. 
Brown stopped 8 of 13 shots, while Sklapsky saved 34 of 37 opportunities faced.

Bumping the Big East 
Heintzman leads Notre Dame to wins over Louisville, Cincinatti to move to top ofconference 
By TOM DORWART Sports Writer 
Leading up to Saturday's battle for the Big East lead, No. 6 and undefeated Louisville might have scouted the Irish. They had to have known pre-season Big East player of the year and All­American Lauren Brewster could hurt them. Or that pre­season all Big East pick Lauren Kelbley could hurt them. Or even that last week's CVU.com National Player of the Week Adrianna Stasiuk could hurt them. 
They most likely didn't guess sophomore outside hit­ter Ellen Heintzman would be one of No. 7 Notre Dame's top weapons in a 30-28, 30-28,

The No. 4 Irish women defeated second place Providence by a large 34-59 margin. Providence came into the meet ranked No. 16 in the country. Notre Dame placed four runners in the top 10 and recorded the lowest score in a women's Big East

ND WOMEN'S SOCCER 
Thorlakson leads ND 
to quarterfinal victory 
By KEN FOWLER 
SportS Writer 
Katie Thorlakson once again led Notre Dame to a postseason victory Sunday, as the Irish topped Georgetown, 6-0, at Alumni Field in the quarterfmals of the Big East Tournament. 
Thorlakson, who scored or assisted on 18 of Notre Dame's 22 postseason goals last year, found the net once and added three assists as the Irish advanced to face Marquette Friday in the conference semifi­nal game in Milwaukee, Wise. 
Just 10 minutes into the match Sunday, Thorlakson and fresh­man forward/midfielder Brittany Bock assisted on the only goal the Irish needed for the victory, a Kerri Hanks tap-in on the right side. 
Bock found Thorlakson on the left side of the box and made a backdoor cut to the goal. After Thorlakson hit Bock in stride, a Hoya defender rotated over to cover Bock, leaving the streaking Hanks open as she approached the net.
