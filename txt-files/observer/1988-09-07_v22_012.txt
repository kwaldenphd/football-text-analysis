Parking tickets computerized 
By ASHOK RODRIGUES News Staff 
Notre Dame Security has in­stalled a computer system to handle parking violations. Se­curity officers can now issue parking tickets generated on the spot by hand-held com­puters. The system also signals when a vehicle has accum­ulated enough violations to be towed. 
"The advantage to the Uni­versity is that it makes parking enforcement more efficient," said Phil Johnson, assistant director for Notre Dame secur­ity and the individual in charge of the new ticketing procedure. 
Using the touch sensitive screens on their portable Ep­son computers, security staff enter the relevant data about the vehicle in question. The unit then prints out the vehicle description, violation, and fine on a form, which is left on the vehicle. 
In addition, if the vehicle's owner has accumulated four or more citations in an academic year, the computer will in­struct the officer to have the car towed at the owner's ex­pense. Accumulation of two tickets for parking in handi­capped zones will also trigger a signal to tow the car. 
With over 800 'towable' cars on campus last year, Security needed a means to keep track of them. Cars that should have been towed were not, due to the administrative difficulty of keeping track of the violators. "My feeling is that if we are going to be towing people with tickets, we should tow after the fourth ticket, and this system will allow it," Johnson ex­plained. 
"We want violators to under­stand that if they park in an area where they ought not park, there are consequences," Johnson added. 
One advantage of the new system is that it displays the amount of the fine on the ticket. In the past, people had to call in to find out exactly how much the fine was. 
Security expects the system,

Notre Dame contributes to open homeless shelter 
By KELLEY TUTHILL News Staff 
An innovative multi-service center for the homeless will open this fall in South Bend, as a result of the efforts of the Council of Providers of Ser­vices to the Homeless (COPOSHl, and a half million dollars from the University of Notre Dame. 
Last year the United Religi­ous Community (URC) operated an overnight winter shelter in South Bend. This new center, located at 813 So. Mic­higan Street, will be open year round, 24 hours a day. David 
T. Link, dean of the Law School and member of COPOSH, said that the purpose of this facility "is not just to shelter the home­less, but to help people move from the homeless condition back into society." 
The center will consist of several different agencies un­der one roof offering various services to those in need. The URC has hired Stephen Newton to coordinate the operations of the center. "Keeping a balance between the different factors will be the trick," said Newton. "Notre Dame's involvement means that the school does care about the local community." 


Thomas Mason, vice presi­dent for Business Affairs, said, "the top reason the University became involved in this project is the number of students that have been active in serving the homeless in the past.'' Mason said the project was financed from physical plant funds that are generally used for the con­struction and renovation of campus facilities. He added that the University will main­tain the site as it does any other University building. 
Mason said that the center was particularly appealing be­cause, "we (the University) did not want a warehouse type of shelter, but a place that had a total involvement to the physical and mental well being of the homeless." He believes that the center will be, "a more

Anthony Kerrigan, senior guest scholar at the Univer­sity of Notre Dame's Helen Kellogg Institute for Interna­tional Studies, has been awarded a Senior Fellowship in Literature Grant of $40,000 by the National Endowment for the Arts CNEA). Kerrigan was one of only three Amer­ican writers to receive the special award. Kerrigan, a poet, writer and editor, is best known for his work as translator for such authors as Miguel de Unamuno, Jorge Luis Borges, and Pablo Neruda. He is the first translator to be recommended for a·senior Fellowship. 
In a bizarre experiment designed to simulate life in space, the Gambian Air Force welded four men in the cab of a 1957 Chevy pickup and left them there for sixteen days. The Weekly World News reports that the men were hospitalized with heatstroke after being freed from their "spacecraft." General Dembo Ceesay, the top-ranking of­ficer in the Gambian Air Force (which has yet to buy its first plane,) defended the tests, saying that they "are im­perative if we are to reap the benefits of interplanetary

INSIDE COLUMN 
Time to take a moment to reenter childhood 
Stop for a moment. Try to fprget about the assignments that are due tomorrow and the reading that you are already behind on. Tem­porarily disregard weekend plans and hectic schedules. Ignore any stress that you may be feeling right now. 
Now you are ready to reenter a child's world. Even though most college students consider elementary school ancient history, I feel that we could all benefit by occasionally adopting a child's carefree attitude and unclouded per­spective. 
We have many responsibilities and inhibitions now that did not dictate our actions as third graders. Although our current sit~ation~ i!l a college setting prevent us from actmg childish, we must remember how to think like a child. 
Healthy children seem to have an irrepres­sible love of life. They laugh about silly things. They cry about silly things. Kids are often can­did, spontaneous, and nervy. They don't deliberate about the long term consequences of their actions; they simply live for the moment. 
Does this mean that we should all cut after­noon classes tomorrow for recess, play hopscotch and dodge ball on the quads, and have food fights in the dining halls? Although these activities sound tempting (and maybe familiar), they are just not realistic. 
We are, however, not so far removed from our childhoods as you might imagine. We should learn to recognize our youthful tendencies and to be able to laugh at ourselves. For example, eight year olds love to play boys chase the girls and vice ver.sa. A slightly more complex version of this game is very popular on campus. 
Remember the undying devotion that you pledged to your first sweetheart (the one who gave you the fancy valentine in second grade?) A similar innocent infatuation emerges in those who have helpless crushes on people whom they are too scared to approach. 
What about the way that you idolized your parents when you were a kid? Everyone re­members arguments with friends about whose dad could run faster or yell louder. Last year it was Tim Brown who was indestructible. This year so far the students' strongest passions seem directed against Miami. Notre Dame stu­dents' avid school spirit also has roots in the exaggerated passions and loyalties of our younger years. 
Most Notre Dame students love sports. Many migrate outside on rare sunny days to play bas­ketball, football, frisbee and many other

games. Although the types of sports have evolved since grade school, it is the ability to play that we must remember from our childhoods. 
How do you distinguish between playing like a child and playing like an athelete? No one can teach you how to play like a child. It's a phenomenom that occurs when you relax, lose all feelings of self conciousness, and concen­trate solely on doing something fun. You may fear that others will see you as foolish. I can't deny that some will see you that way. But, I can assure you that no kids will agree. 
A child can find excitement and fun in even 
the most common matters. Bill Vaughan ex­
pressed this gift when he said,'' A three-year -old 
child is a being who gets almost as much fun 
out of a fifty-six dollar set of swings as it does 
out of finding a small green worm." 
Next time you stress about a test, lose your 
sense of humor, or buckle under the pressures 
of daily life, try to think like a child. Relax, go 
play outside, or say something directly from 
the heart. Acting like a kid again can put your 
life back in perspective. After all, it wasn't long 
ago that we were all playing tag on the play­
ground instead of studying in the library.

time to collect their thoughts Tuesday, after putting both men through mock debates during the Labor Day weekend. 
Both campaigns expect the debate to give their candidates broader exposure than they've enjoyed during the early months of the race, which began in earnest shortly after the May 3 primary. 
But campaign officials say the effect on the Nov. 8 election could be minimal in the long run, depending on how the two men perform. 

"I think there's no question it's very important," said Joseph H. Hogsett, Bayh's cam­paign manager. "It's espe­cially important when you have the opportunity to do this while it's beamed into every house­hold in the state. More viewers than ever before will have an opportunity to see it." 
Michael McDaniel, Mutz's campaign manager, agreed that the event will be important in allowing viewers to make comparisons between the two candidates. But the long-term effect could be minor, he said. 
"Unless someone makes a terrible blunder, these things have a short time span," said McDaniel. 
Bayh went through a mock debate Sunday night, and Mutz practiced Monday night for the second time in four days, cam­paign officials said.

caring place for the homeless because it is a multi-faceted project." 
J. D'Arcy Chisholm, associ­ate director of the Institute for Pastoral and Social Ministry and treasurer of COPOSH, ex­plained how this center was es­tablished. A year ago COPOSH decided that something better than an overnight winter shel­ter was needed, according to Chisholm. COPOSH negotiated 38,000 square feet of space in a former clothing store that had been empty for seven years, said Chisholm. COPOSH se­cured a $96,000 short term loan from the South Bend Housing Development Corp, according to Chisholm. 
The transaction was closed on January 29, 1988, and shortly after a proposal was submitted to the University, said Chis­holm. Father Edward Malloy, president of the University, and other university officers were interested, according to Chisholm. The University pur­chased the building and leased it back to COPOSH for $1 a year, said Chisholm. He added, 

"The University should be -----------------------. 
commended for putting to ac­tion its committment to the city of South Bend and to social jus­tice." 
The URC is an "organization of almost 100 local congrega­tions that acts to provide effec­tive, useful programs in areas where separate congregational efforts would be inade­quate,"according to a shelter pamphlet. Mason said that the University will budget the first year of operations and then it will be the responsibility of the URC. 
The URC, as well as almost 300 Notre Dame and St. Mary's students will staff the center according to Dean Link. The volunteers will also work with the various provider groups to service the homeless, said Link.

Newton said that he "hopes to coordinate the creation of a program that will respond to the immediate needs of the homeless." He also said that it is an original idea to coordinate the various providers under one roof. Newton hopes that this will become a model for the country and a challenge to major universities to become committed to their communit­ies. Newton said that having Notre Dame's reputation at­tached to this project is a plus.

P.O. Box Q 

Military represents a necessary evi I 
Dear Editor: 
To Mr. Michael Garvey's letter of Sept. 2, I must respond. If taken to its logical conclusion, the premise that the Armed Forces are for the sole purpose of killing would mean that members of the services are killers. I, for one, as a veteran, find that quite offensive. 
Mr. Garvey appears to be living in a world of black and white, in a vacuum that knows only pure good or pure evil. It may be true that we are all God's children. But a number of His children are severely misguided. It falls upon the shoulders of Mr. Garvey's "killers" to stop those of God's children who deviate from the accepted rules of be­havior. 
Note that I did not say punish, for that falls upon the domestic and inter­national courts and ultimately God. Nor did I say kill, for it has been proven throughout history that the mere threat of force will suffice in stopping possible uses of violence, either by states or in­dividuals. 
Historical figures that responded only to the use of force also come to mind. Men such as Hitler and Napoleon and groups such as the Red Brigade and IRA are evidence of those who have fallen victim to the less desirable traits of human nature. Mr. Garvey seems to ignore such traits in his black and white world. 
It would be wonderful if we could all live in a world of God-like perfection, in peace and harmony and knowing no national boundaries. I doubt, however, that God wishes us to ignore reality un­til we reach that state. 
I therefore applaud Notre Dame's commitment to training future officers for the service of our nation. Moreover, it is by playing educator to these men and women that the University is able to influence their training. I hope these aspiring officers will receive a dose of Christian ethics and responsibility that can only add to the qualities a good officer needs. 
I find the proposition that ROTC and Notre Dame are inconsistent to be com­pletely absurd and naive. I hope that the administration will be in no way influenced by the misguided and ir­responsible attitude of the proposition. Furthermore, the University should continue its responsible contribution to the United States by training more leaders of the future.

Jackson not a viable alternative 
Dear Editor: 
Mr. Tom Varnum's Viewpoint article of Aug. 29 concerning the defeat of Jesse Jackson and racism in America is far from reality. The claims that Americans did not vote for Reverend Jackson because he is black and that if Jackson were white he would be the Democratic ,presidential nominee are absurd. 
There are two reasons Rev. Jackson had the success he did. The first is the hands off attitude the press took with him. While we were bombarded with news of Gary Hart's relationship with Donna Rice, and unsubstantiated rumors of Dan Quayle and Linda Parkinson, the media did not think it important to cover Jesse Jackson's re­lationship with Vasser Arafat or Fidel Castro. The press made the Reverend's Rainbow Coalition a household term, while his significant term "Hymie­town" (in reference to New York City) was a footnote quickly forgotten. When Rep. Rodino of New Jersey, a Demo­cratic Congressman with a 100 percent civil rights voting record, sought re­election, Jackson supported his op­ponent, admittedly, because he was black. Jackson apologized, but the inci­dent was forgotten. The list goes on and on. 
The second reason for Jackson's suc­cess is the support he received from black voters. Nine out of ten black voters cast ballots for Jackson. While Mr. Varnum claimed racism kept whites from voting for Jackson, was it also racist for blacks not to vote for white candidates? If Jackson were white it would be safe to assume that blacks would not have come out in such masses to support him. Also, assuming Jackson were white, his super-liberal ideas (which make Mike Dukakis look conservative) would have been as ac­cepted as Senator Paul Simon's liberal ideas. But Simon was put out of the race long before Jackson. It is obvious that a white Jackson would have been laughed off the political arena. 

Mr. Varnum needs to stop looking at life in a mirror and seeing everything backwards. Americans would vote for a qualified black man or woman, for example Rep. William Gray of Penn­sylvania or Head of the National Secur­ity Council Colin Powell. But Americans can also see through an in­experienced, leftist, racist and anti­semitic candidate such as Jesse Jackson with or without the media's help.

Wednesday lunch fast helps needy 
Dear Editor: 

"No way, I need my lunch." I wish I had a dollar for every time I heard that type of response during the past three years when I've been signing people up for the Wednesday Lunch Fast. The Fast is a program in which students agree to give up their dining hall lunch on Wednesday. The Food Service then donates one dollar for every lunch that is skipped. It's sad that people who have always had more than enough to eat can really think that missing one turkey sandwich and some pudding is such a big deal. "Miss lunch?," people say, ''I'll get hungry.'' Maybe they will. And maybe it's time for those of us who have always enjoyed, not only enough food, but thousands of other good things in life, to find out what it's like to go hungry for a few hours. Maybe it will help us to appreciate our innumerable blessings. The ugly problem called hunger seems very far removed from us, and as students we don't have time to worry about it. The money collected from the Fast at the end of the semester goes toward grassroots development agencies in India, Bangladesh, Chile and Africa that are helping people to feed themselves and to better their existence. 
On Sept. 14 the Wednesday Lunch F'ast will begin. It will last through the semester, except for finals week. I would like to ask those of you who have been faithful fasters in the past to con­tinue your generosity this semester. And to those who've never fasted, I'd like to ask you to try it. Skip one lunch and see if you can keep it going. It's not necessarily going to be easy, but it's a sacrifice well worth making. If you are willing to give of yourself, please sign up at the dining halls this Wednesday or Thursday, or call 283­

Soviet scholar will speak at ND 
Dear Editor: 
Dr. Igor Semenovich Kon, senior re­searcher at the Institute of Ethnog­raphy, USSR Academy of Sciences, will be visiting the University of Notre Dame Sept. 6-11 in a visit sponsored collaboratively by the Hesburgh Pro­gram in Public Service, the Institute for International Peace Studies, the Family Studies Program of the Sociol­ogy Department, and the AT&T Visit­ing Scholar Series of the Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts. He is in the United States on a three-month visit sponsored by the International Re­search and Exchange Board. 
Author of over 20 books and 500 arti­cles, Kon holds several doctorates, the first in history and later ones in the social sciences, but is most noted for his work in sociology. He writes in com­parative history and theory, family studies and policy, human sexuality, gender, youth values, and ethnicity. He taught and conducted research in Leningrad prior to his move to the So­viet Academy in Moscow. 
A leading Soviet sociologist whose work was recognized already in the later Stalin era, he is also one of the most visible and widely respected proponents of Mr. Gorbachev's current reforms. 
Although he will give several collo­quia on campus, his principal public addresses are first on Wednesday eve­ning, Sept. 7, in the Annenberg Auditorium of the Snite Museum on the topic "Family Life and Values in the Soviet Union Today;" and second, on Thursday, Sept. 8 at 7:00 p.m. in the Century Center, a Community Forum on the topic "Understanding Change in the Soviet Union: Perestroika ... What Does It Mean To Us?" All interested are urged to attend. 
Those wishing to contact Dr. Kon should call Professor David Leege, director of the Hesburgh Program in Public Service at 239-5016.

Law School: a success 
Ian Mitchell accent writer 

F 
rom its early beginning as the first Catholic law school in the United States, the Notre Dame Law School has grown to become a na­tionally known, highly respected institution which draws applications from all over the country. 
The history of the study of law at Notre Dame began only two years after the crea­tion of the University itself. University founder Father Edward Sorin had shown an interest in forming a law de­partment in 1854, but 15 years passed before his dream fi­nally became a reality in 1869. By 1898 the department had become a full-fledged col­lege of the university, but law remained an undergraduate program until 1932. In 1955 the college was renamed the Law School, reflecting its purely graduate status. 
Today the Law School has over 510 students divided al­most equally over the three years of graduate study. This year the Law School's appli­cation pool was considerably larger than those of preceding years; approximately 2,000 applications were received for only 169 positions, making competition for admission extremely difficult. The num­ber of applications received this year represents a 20 per­cent increase over last year's total. 
On the national scale, law school applications have been up this past year, but no one reason for this trend has been generally accepted. Law School Assistant Dean William 0. McLean reports that "you have all sorts of speculation about that (the reasons for the larger num­bers of applicants), from L.A. Law to the Supreme Court confirmation hearings." But whatever the causes of the national upturn, here at Notre Dame the reasons seem more clear-cut; Assistant Dean McLean credits the increase in the Law School's "growing national reputation to in­creased faculty scholarship, highly successful placement of graduate students, and a strong representation of Notre Dame graduates hold­ing judgeships." 
As a result of the larger applicant pool, the Law School can afford to be more selective about its offers of

admission, and the Assistant Dean believes that "there is no question that the breadth and depth of diversity and academic credentials (of the students) have all been rising." These high caliber students, in turn, further en­hance the School's reputation. 
It seems that the benefits the Law School enjoys from its highly selective status will continue for years to come. In the words of Assistant Dean McLean, "we see no reason why we won't continue this ascent towards further na­tional prominence." From humble beginnnings to na­tional recognition; Father Sorin would be proud.

" l ike sands through the 
hourglass ... " For many, this phrase marks the beginning of the day's best hour of television viewing. Each day thousands of people spend their noon hour watch­ing the trials and tribulations of the Hortons and friends on NBC's "Days of Our Lives." 
On November 8, 1965, NBC unveiled the daytime serial that, two weeks ago, topped the ratings chart for the first time in fourteen years. Al­though "Days of Our Lives" ratings have recently dipped to the second position, the show continues to be the "king of the soaps" to its avid fans. 
The success of the show can be attributed to the cast and production staff, but the show's emphasis on family is one of its most evident and appealing factors. 
Since its beginnings, "Days" has centered around Alice and Tom Horton (Frances Reid and Mac­Donald Carey) and their fam­ily. The viewing audience has grown with the Hortons and the Hortons have grown with 
Bill Watterson 


'Days' lie ahead 
the audience. One of the best examples of audience enthusi­asm for "Days" occurred several years ago when the Salem Strangler atacked Marlena Brady(Deidre Hall) Roman's now-deceased wife. Viewers were so upset at the thoughc of losing Marlena that they protested at NBC Studios. In the end, the story explained the Strangler killed Marlena's twin sister Samantha. 
Another reason for the suc­cess of "Days" is its ability to keep the older audiences en­tertained while appealing to the "next generation" of soap viewers. In fact, NBC Media Relations indicates, "Days of Our Lives" is by far the most popular serial with men and women between ages twelve and twenty four. 
Socially-relevant plots keep audiences informed as well as entertained. Over the years the show has featured such tpoics as rape, surrogate parenthood, and diabetes. Currently, "Days" is tackling the problems of AIDS, il­literacy, and myesthenea gravis, Maggie's (Suzanne Rogers) muscle disorder. 
These elements are some of the reasons why "Days of Our Lives" hit number one. The peaks of certain plots, especially the wedding of Kayla and Patch (Mary Beth Evans and Stephen Nichols), attracted large audiences. Ironically, this landmark achievement occurred during the writer's strike when non­union writers as well as the show's producers were over­seeing the storylines. 
Two of the characters greatly responsible for the show's large appeal to teens are Jennifer and Frankie (Melissa Brennan and Billy Warlock); however, that may 
soon change. On October 5, 

Frankie will bid Salem a fond 
adieu by accepting a psychol­ogy scholarship to Columbia University. Billy Warlock, 
winner of the Emmy award for best supporting actor in a 
daytime drama series, 

decided to leave the show. Frankie's departure will open new storyline possibilities as Jennifer copes with the loss of 
Frankie and searches for a 
new love interest. 

Future "Days" plot twists should prove to be exciting. NBC Media Relations revealed that Roman's iden­tity crisis will emerge as one of the most exciting "Days" plots of the year. Mickey's campaign for a Senate seat will put pressure on his relationships with his wife Maggie and his daughter Melissa. Gabrielle will leave Salem on an important ISA mission. While this should relieve some of the stress on Kimberly and Shane's mar­riage, their world will be far from tranquil. Watch for Shane's twin brother to arrive in Salem shortly (Charles Shaugnessy who plays Shane will also star as Shane's twin). April and Mike's rela­tionship will grow while Justin and Adrienne begin to drift apart. 
With these exciting new storylines and the show's eternal devotion to quality entertainment, viewers will have more than their fill of romance, suspense, mystery, and intrigue. So are the days of our lives.

Red Sox increase lead to 2 in AL East 
Associated Press doubled to trigger a four-run impressed 
BALTIMORE--Mike Green­well had three hits, including a home run, and drove in three runs and Wes Gardner pitched a five-hitter as the Boston Red Sox increased their American League East lead by defeating the Baltimore Orioles 6-1 Tues­day night. 
Gardner, 7-4, walked two and struck out two as he won his second straight start with the first complete game of his career. His previous longest outing was 71-3 innings against Chicago on July 22. 
The Red Sox collected six singles their first time through the lineup against Jay Tibbs, 4­13, and finished with 13 hits in all. By the time Wade Boggs singled in the sixth, all nine Red Sox starters had hits. 
Blue Jays 7, Tigers 3 
DETROIT--George Bell Toronto second inning as the streaking Blue Jays beat the skidding Detroit Tigers 7-3 Tuesday night. 
The Tigers, 23-30 since the All-Star break, have lost six straight games and 13 of their last 15. 
Jimmy Key, 10-4, struck out five and walked one in seven innings plus. Two of the Detroit runs came on Chet Lemon's lOth and 11th home runs, in the fourth and seventh innings. Duane Ward, the third Toronto 
pitcher, got out of a bases­loaded jam in the Tiger eighth with a double-play ball and £inished for his 13th save. 
Detroit's Doyle Alexander, 11-11, was tagged for five runs on six hits in two-plus innings. Alexander, 8-4 at the All-Star break, is winless in his last six starts, going 0-5 since his last win Aug. 6. 
Indians 1, Yankees 0 
NEW YORK--Greg Swindell pitched a three-hitter and Ron Kittle hit his 18th home run to lead the Cleveland Indians to a 1-0 victory Tuesday night over the New York Yankees. 
AI Leiter, 4-4, making his first appearance since June 21, gave up three hits in five in­nings, throwing 80 pitches. He had been out with blisters on the middle finger of his left hand, but healed after a treat­ment that included soaking his hand in pickle brine. 
Swindell, 15-13, struck out eight and walked three in pitch­ing his fourth shutout and 12th complete game of the season. The 12 complete games tie him with Boston's Roger Clemens for second in the American League, behind the 14 of Oak­land's Dave Stewart. 

Braves 2, Dodgers 1 
ATLANTA--Jeff Blauser hit his first major league home run with two outs in the eighth in­ning to give the Atlanta Braves a 2-1 victory over the Los An­geles Dodgers Tuesday. 
With the score tied 1-1, Blauser hit a pitch from reliever Jesse Orosco, 2-2, over the left-field fence. 
Paul Assenmacher, 7-4, got the victory in relief of starter Pete Smith. Bruce Sutter got the last three outs for his 13th save and 299th lifetime. 
Pirates 3, Mets 2 
PITTSBURGH--John Smiley allowed five hits in 8 2-3 innings and Glenn Wilson hit a two-run double in the first inning as the Pittsburgh Pirates defeated the New York Mets 3-2 Tuesday night. 
by Nelson 
Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.­-The reviews are in on Karl Nel­son's first regular season game back in the NFL after a battle with cancer, and New York Giants coach Bill Parcells isn't too happy. 
Although the Giants over­came a 13-0 deficit to defeat the Super Bowl champion Redskins 27-20 on Monday night, Nelson really struggled against Washington defensive end Charles Mann. 
Parcells even went so far as 

to say that the reason the 
Giants gained only 56 yards 
rushing on 21 carries was be­
cause there was one break­
down on the offensive line. 
And yes, you guessed it. It was Nelson. "Well look it's only the first week," Parcells said Tuesday

Hurricanes not thrilled by No. 1 ranking 


Associated Press 
CORAL GABLES, Fla.--The Miami Hurricanes' ascension to the No. 1 ranking doesn't au­tomatically mean all's well with the defending national champions, Coach Jimmy Johnson said Tuesday.

Freshmen Julie Bremner and J ai Bruno performed well in their collegiate debuts and will be faced with their first real test under pressure against Stanford's senior setter Lara Asper and her talented team­mates. 
Notre Dame will need junior Kathy Cunningham to be in top form as well, and take up where she left off last season after suffering a shoulder in­jury. If the Indiana game is any indication, the Irish can count on her defensive skills and hit-

"Coming off the bench and playing is very difficult," said Irish head coach Art Lambert "but she's a real student of th~ game and she does it very well. I just love to have her in there in the close matches because she's going to do what it takes to win." 
Shewman's competitive atti­tude and never-say-die spirit have been the key to preserving

many Irish victories and the catalyst that has brought the team from behind to win on several occasions, but she tries not to think of that in the heat of the battle.

The Hurricanes replaced Florida State as the No. 1 team in this week's Associated Press poll by thrashing the Seminoles 31-0 in Saturday's opener. Despite the impressive victory, Johnson said, his players remain young, inexperienced 
and  unswayed  by  their  
ranking.

The Irish, 2-0, also had goals from K.T. Sullivan, Debbie Ho and Mimi Suba.

Anticipation. 

For over eight months there has been a fire bur­ning inside all those who live and die Notre Dame football. 
Sparked by an 8-1 start in 1987, dimmed by a 0-3 finish and fanned by a long off-season hiatus, this fire will be in full blaze on Saturday evening when the Irish open the 1988 campaign against Michigan. Finally. 
The tickets have been purchased, the Musco lights are being moved into position and the empty Stadium seems to beckon the Irish faithful. The bookstore readies for the impending rush. 
Upon returning to campus most students took one look at the Administration Building and asked 'When.will the scaffolding be down?' The answer was not September 10, although that was the projected date. The answer was, 'before the first home game.' 
The last remaining question is whether the foot­ball team will be ready by then, too. 
" We're right on schedule as far as our develop­ment," says tri-captain Andy Heck, "and we've been improving everyday. Saturday we will be where we need to be to face Michigan." 
Lou Holtz answers the question in a slightly dif, ferent manner. "I'm glad we're pl~ying at night," quipps Notre 
Dame head coach Lou Holtz after Monday's prac­tice. "That gives us longer to mature. I wish it were at 11 instead of 8." 
Humor aside, the general consensus among the coaches and the players and anyone who has seen them practice is that, yes, they are ready to play football on Saturday. They are improving every day and they are hungry to hit someone else besides their teammates. 
Recent Notre Dame-Michigan matchups have

provided for some of college football's most exciting 
moments. But there is another reason why this 
game is more important than the other eleven 
games the Irish will play this season. It is the season 
opener, the first test, the momentum builder, or destroyer. 
It is that first grade on the year's tally, and like Florida State found out on Saturday night, it can not always be as bright as expected. 
Like the Seminoles, the Irish face a nearby rival which is in the top 10 of nearly every national poll. The challenge of getting rid of opener jitters be­comes even more imposing when you're getting jarred by a team like the one Bo Schembechler will bring with him this weekend. 
"Against 99% of the teams in the country," says Head Coach Lou Holtz, "I'd say we would play ex­tremely well. But Michigan is one team that can make you look bad in the opening game. 
"I've never had a football team have as big a test as this one." 
Michigan. The season opener. Holtz' highest pre­season ranking in his three years here. And lofty expectations after last year. 
October 15 will come soon enough, Jimmy Johnson haters. But September 10 is three days away and the longest wait is over. Mter Saturday the Irish are off and running, with nine straight Saturdays of tests before a weekend off in mid-November. 
There are still several question marks. Holtz 
questions the ability of his offensive line. Schem­
bechler says he still doesn't know who will start as 
his quarterback. 
But the only answer will be on the scoreboard 
come Saturday night around 11 p.m. And it's about 
time.
