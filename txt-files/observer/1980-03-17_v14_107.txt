Thief takes student to cleaners 
by Mary Fran Callahan Senior StaffReporter 
Four bags of laundry were stolen from Stanford Hall last week and the theft has led a student to question University liability. 
Tom Melsheimer, of Stanford Hall, said he dropped off his laundry and when he went to claim it, laundry officials said they never received any of his clothes. Melsheimer estimated the value of his laundry to be between $80-$100. He said initially Bob Watkins, director of Student Support, had tentatively "tossed around'' the idea of reimbursing him 60 percent the cost of the clothes. Watkins later in the week then told Melsheimer that he had been advised by University officials 
that no recompense could be made, according to the student. 
Yesterday afternoon, Watkins declined to comment on the incident. 
Me I s h e i m e-r c o n t a c ted Timothy McDevitt, assistant general counsel for the Univer­sity, last w~ek to question University liability. McDevvit said, according to Melsheimer, that he could not legally advise!! the University to even partially compensate for the theft since such a move would set a precedent. 
Currently, DuLac states 

"the University cannot assume any responsibility for laundry items until they are received by the laundry." University officials used this regulation to justify non-reimbursement and told Melsheimer to report the theft to security. 
"I don't think the DuLac regulation is fair,'' Melsheimer 

Harrassment 

Sophomore accuses security 
by Margie Brassil SMC News Editor 
Gordon Geraci, an ND sophomore accused Notre Dame security officials of verbal abuse and harrassment last night following an altercation at the Main Gate security station. The incident reportedly occured when Geraci tried to get his ID back from three officers at the gate, in exchange for a 15 minute pass. 
According to Geraci he tried to retrieve his ID after parking his car in the D-2 parking lot. After the officers refused to return the pass without seeing the car, Geraci returned to his room and called the Main Security Office. Accoriding to Geraci, a patrol car was sent to verify that his car was in the lot and then he was told it was all right to claim his ID. 
Geraci said that after returning to the Main gate he made a wise-crack to the guards. He reponed that one of the guards then flared up, throwing off his badge, claiming to resign, ancl swearing at Geraci. He alleges that the guard then moved as if tostrike him but was restrained by one of the other guards. 
The second guard then began to indirectly threaten Geraci saying, "I've decked other people for doing less than you," according to Geraci. The officers finally gave Geraci his ID and shut the door on him. 
When contacted last night, one of the officers denied the charges, but all three refused to comment further. 
said, "It's nof a highly publicized thing. I think students should be aware of this if they've got a dangerous drop off point,'' he added. 
He criticized the presentsystem's legal obligation when he commented, "There is a grey area there which no one is responsible for." Melsheimer

Two tickets released plat­forms last night announcing their intentions to run for Student Government positions at Saint Mary's College for the 1980-1981 academic year, ac­cording to Election Commis­sioner Mary Mullaney. 
Running on one ticket are Kathleen Sweeney for student body president, Joan McCarthy for vice-president of Academic Affairs and Nini Stoll for vice­president of Student Affairs. The second ticket is comprised of Sue Scheiber who is running for Student Body President, Bernie Calatco for Vice­President for Ac1demic Affairs and Marie Liz Hackl for Vice­President of Student Affairs. 
The Sweeney ticket's plat­form is divided into four major areas -student life, academic life, social and athletic. 
In the area of student life, Sweeney hopes to implement the use of such services as consumer cards which would enable St. Mary's students to enjoy discounts at local stores and Rent-A-Student directories containing the names of stu­dents who could offer such services as typing or tutoring. 
Academically, the Sweeney ticket hopes to employ the use of Scholarship Literature which would outline opportunities available and explainin~ eligi­bility criteria, ,plus deadltnes for such grants as Rotary, Rhodes and Fulbright awards. In addition, the ticket endorses the use of pre-profesional guidance. 
Proposed social activities in­clude a political week featuring federal, state and local govern­ment officials and club house entertainment fe~.turi11g local musical and drama talents. 
In the area of athletics, the ticket proposes a fall Olympics Week and cardio-pulmanary resucitation and water safety instruction courses. 
Scheiber's ticket "student government of Saint Mary's has as its primary aim the welfare of the students as members of the college community in both the academic and co-curricular areas," as quoted in the Stu­dent Government Manual. 
Some of the Scheiber ticket's ideas for the 1980-81 academic year include a possible shuttle bus after football games, run­ning between the grotto and Holy Cross, and a weekly, informal "be-heard brunch" at which an officer would be present to listen to students' comments and suggestions. 
In addition, Scheiber hopes to communicate feedback from the Holy Cross nuns to the students concerning the chan­neling of funds, with regard to the Student Mission Care pro­gram and to continue the speaker series with the ob-­jective of presenting those speakers whom the student

Bush, Reagan intensify efforts to blunt Andersonpopularity in Illinois primary 
CHICAGO (AP) -With Gerald 
R. Ford out of the picture, Ronald Reagan and George Bush intensified their efforts yesterday to blunt John B. Anderson's popularity in ad­vance of the pivotal Illinois primary this week. 
Bolstered by fresh triumphs in Democratic caucuses in South Carolina, Mississippi and Wyoming, President Carter was headed for his crucial test in Illinois on Tuesday as an easy 

' favorite over Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. The early turnout yesterday in Puerro Rrco's presidential pri­mary, pitting Carter and Ken­nedy, was de5cribed as heavy. At stake are 41 ddegates to the Democratic National Conven­tion in August. Bush won Puerto Rico's winner-take-all GOP primary last month. Reagan, locked in a tight race with Anderson in Illinois for its 102 GOP National C(li1Ven­tion delegates, suggested yes­terday that Anderson might consider leaving the Republican Party. 
Reagan referred to the Illinois congressman's "inaoiliry to support Republican candidates, his tnability to go along with the philosophy'' of the GOP. The former California governor, however, said he wasn't pro­posing that Anderson be vision and que~tioned ~t a news thrown out of t~e parry. confere~ce, sa1d that if Ande_r­

St. Patrick's Day
Deposedshah returns to exile home after hospitalization Profs discuss Irish tradition 
The way Americans celebrate St. Patrick's Day is offensive to natives of Ireland, according to a couple of Irishmen at the Universiry of Notre Dame. 
''When it reached the stage of selling buttons that read 'Kiss me I'm Irish,' it losr all touch with the 5t. Patrick's Day of Ireland. The Irish call practices like this 'shamrock­ery,"' Sean V. Golden, an Irish native and assistant professor ofEnglish at Notre Dame, said. 
"I used to find the festivities offensive, the green beer and all," said Michad J. Clancy, who was born in County Clare and is now a Ph.D. candtdate at Notre Dame. "But now I give the charity of my silence. The behavior ts a bit boorish, but what I find most offensive is the music passed off here in the States as Irish has nothing to do with authentic traditional Irish music," he added. 
The coming of St. Patrick's Day is met in the United States with parades, green beer, festive drinking, music and 

dancing,  "the wearin'  of the  
green,''  shamrocks,  lepre­ 
chauns,  the  blarney  stone,  

"Erin go bragh," and claims, valid and otherwise, of an Irish ancestor perched in the family tree. 

In Ireland St. Patrick's Day is a Holy Day of Obligation, one of several days set aside by the Roman Catholic Church to commemorate saints and other religious events. Mass atend­ance is mandatory. And because Patrick is a patron saint of Ireland, whose popula­tion is 95 rer cent Catholic, it is a nationa holiday. 
"Paddy's Day is not cele­brated that much in Ireland,'' Clancy said. ''The one custom that might be said to be typically Irish is that everyone wears a shamrock. Everyone is appropriately adorned with a ntce fresh shamrock, taking pride in the fact that it doesn't grow anywhere else."

PANAMA CI1Y, Panama (AP) -Deposed Shah Mohamad Reza Pahlavi rerurned yesterday to his home-in-exile on the resort island of Contadora after his doctors announced they would delay removal of his inflamed spleen until his condition is "optimal." 
Morse denied a Panamanian doctor's statement that the shah's hospitalization had been a "false alarm" involving pneumonia. He said the shah had been admitted to Paitilla hospital on the outskirts of Panama City for an examination of his spleen, which might be canerous, and nothing else.

The social life of a village centers around these pubs where musicians congregate and drink a few pints. On Paddy's Day and typical Sundays the women will return and dance a few sets.

According to one chronicler, the earliest record found of Irishmen meeting on American soil to honor St. Patrick was in 1737 in Boston, when a group of Irish Protestants met to form the Irish Society of Boston. It was a charitable organization intended to help countrymen still living in Ireland. It was . opened to Catholics in 1742. 
Similar meetings of convivi­ality became commonplace with the growing number of Irish fraternal organizations. Soldiers fighting under Gen.

presentatton 
By Kelli Flint Senior StaffReporter 

Author Scott Spencer gave the final presentation of the Sophomore Literary Festival Saturday in the Library Audi­torium_ 
Spencer read excerpts from his latest novel, Endless Love. According to Spencer, the novel took over three years to write. ''By the time I was half-way finished with the work, my initial motivation was gone,'' he said. ''All that I wanted to do was complete the novel.'' 
Enless Love deals with the topic of puppy love. It centers on the effects of puppy love on David Axelrod, _ a. teen-age Chicagoan. ''I can identify with David,'' Spencer said. ''He is the least self regarding of persons. He never thought of himself, only the girl he loved.'' 
Spencer added that the purpose of Endless Love was to point out the seriousness of puppy love. "Puppy love is a sensitive, emotional experi­ence," he said. "It should be treated as a more serious matter than 1t IS now considered.'' 
Spencer also noted that the quality of writing never changes. "There are many first-rate writers in publishing today," he said. "There are. also many shockingly terrible' books on today's bestseller list. We're the same as we were fifty years ago. Things haven't changed that much at all." 
Spencer felt that the current trend for writing autobiograJ?h­ies is an annoying one which may serve a useful purpose in the future. "It's annoying that public figures who commit crimes can write books about

Facu1ty, students predict lllinois outcome ~ 
by Chip Block 

Professors and students ex­pressed varying views on the outcome of tomorrow's...Illinois primary and the impaCt it will have on the final selection of the Democratic and Republican battle between Ronald Reagan and John Anderson. 
The majority of the people questioned agreed that Ander-. son had a good thance of winning the primary, bur The affect of an Anderson win on the remaining primaries was debated. 
Peri Arnould, chairman of the Government and International Studies Department, stated, ''A win by Anderson will lead to better performance Tr, Tater primaries.'' Arnold said that the momentum from the win could even give Anderson a win in California-. 
Another governn.ent profes­sor, John Roos, disagreed. "A win by Anderson would make him a 50 co 1 chance to win the nomination. He is now a 100 to 1 chance," he said. 
Arnold cited Anderson's re­cenf campa!gncofitnbutions as an indication of his growing momentum. 'He has received as much money in the first week in March as he did in the entire month .o£ Eebruary,'' Amold said. 
. . . Cleaners 
(continued from page 1] 
added that he is out ''100 percent.'' 
Following officials' advice, the student did report the theft to security. On his own initiative, he wrote a letter to University President, Fr. Theodore Hesburgh. 
Though the University does not at present intend to compensate Melsheimer, they will let a paid security man investigate the theft. 
''There has been an investigator assigned to locate my dirty underwear!" Melsheimer commented. But, he added, "l don't really think the situation is funny. I'm resolved to the fact that I'll be picking up the tab for my clothes." 
Security acknowledged yesterday that Melsheimer did report the theft and that they cur~ently have a man investi­gaung. 
Melsheimer said the entire incident has left him with a "sour impression" of Univer­sity Busmess affairs. He intimated that he received a lack of cooperation from Laundry Service officials. --He said he would call the Laundry Seryi_ce_offi(;~aJs an_d be. told that they ''would get back to him within the hour." 
''The only time they called me back was when they told me they weren't going to do any­thing. I constantly had to call them through out the week,'' Melsheimer explained. 
Fr. Hesburgh acknowledged Melsheimer's letter Friday night with a phone call, but Melsheimer said he "seriously doubts" the University will renege_ on its decision. 
Melsheimer will continue to utilize the University laundry for the remainder of the semester since he has already paid for the service. But he said he will now deliver his laundry in person and save his receipts until he has clean clothes in hand. Next year, he intends to clean his own clothes. 

''The laundry service knows if they say your laundry was stolen before they got it, they don't have to pay a dime. People should know they should be a little more careful," Melsheimer said. 
Roos, on the other hand, brought up the point that Anderson has very ltttle chance of carrying the western and southwestern states. Because of these states, he said, he gives Anderson little chance to win the Republican nomination. Students also expressed dif­ferent views on tomorrow's election. Larry Hau, campaign chairman for Anderson at the 
Mock Convention, said, "If Anderson wins it would make · him an alternative to Reagan.'' 
Hau stressed that Anderson woud have a better chance in the general election than Rea­gan. According to Hau, Ander­son's liberality would attract more Democrats and In­dependents . 
Greg Folley, the campaign chairman for Reagan at the Mock Convention, said that he believed Reagan would win in Illinois. He called Anderson supporters ''unpredictable'' and predicted a strong Reagan turnout. 
Both Roos and Arnold agreed that President Jimmy Carter has the best chance of winning the Illinois Democratic pri­mary. According to Arnold, Kennedy is relying on the support of Chicago Mayor Jayne Byrne to carry the elec­tion. 
Arnold stated that Anderson would make a strong showing as the Republican nominee. He said the country is too conserva­tive for a Kennedy, but not for an Anderson. The big ques­tion, according to Arnold, is whether Anderson can shift his strategy to accomodate his new found success in the primaries. 
themselves and make enough money from them to pay their legal fees and buy a new home in Mexico," Spencer said. 
''Authors are free to write about what they please, according to the first amend­ment. The public chooses the books that they want to buy. Someday these books may provide useful documents about our past," he added. 
Spencer is currently writing another novel. "I never talk about a novel before finishing it," Spencer said. "You can talk yourself out ofwork. When you constantly talk about what you are writing, you take away the energy and motivation to finish the work.'' 
According the Chuck Russo, Executive Council member of the Sophomore Literary Festival, the festtival was well attended. "We had an excel­lent group of literary figures this year, " . he sa~?. "It was a good expenence.

According to Godlen, many of the symbols associated with rhe Irish have also been altered since crossing the Atlantic. For example, the leprechaun, the lirrle fellow who lives under a roadsrool near the pot of gold at rhc-rainbow's end, was used by rhe English centuries ago to ~epicr the Irish as "supersti­uous and backwards," Golden 'aid.

The shamrock, Godlen said, was used as a slur against the Catholic religion. "Irish Americans," he stated, "turned these forms of insults and wore them as badges cf 
pride."  .

Patrick, "The Steadfast Man," said: "Few are aware that this green, 'The Wearing of the Green' is a symbol not of the lush meadows and foliage ofthe Emerald Isle, but of an ancient Celtic fertility rite, the burning of green leaves, or green boughs, representing the spirit of vegetation, the ashes of which when carried forth and spread over the fields would make them fruitful." 
"St. Patrick's color is blue," Golden said . 
Corned beef and cabbage? ·'Corned beef and cabbage is an American invention,'' Golden commented. ''Butchers in Ireland cur the meat differ­ently. There is no corned beef. We do have boiled cabbage, but most Irishmen can't afford fancy cuts ofmeat. Traditional­ly we took the scrap thrown away--the pig's cheek, head or foot --and used that to flavor the broth. That is our 'soul food.''' ,
