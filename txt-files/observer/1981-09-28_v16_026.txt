The ND Activity Fee Subcommit­tee allocated S29,H...o worth of fund:. to various on campus dubs and organizations last Thursday night.

appropriaH: all of it, holding some in reserve as a contingency fund, .James .\1cDonndl, director of Student Ac­tivities and suhcomittee chairman, said. If a group is dissatisfied with the amount of money they reccivcd thq• have until Oct. 'i to appeal, in writing, to tht· subcommittee, Me Donnell said. To make their decisions, the sub­committee broke down the requests it rn:cived into six catcgorics: volunteer scrvice organizations; eth­nic organization~; acdemic and departmental; various dubs, athktic and recrcational and special projt·cts, McDonnell explained. Thl· subcommittee deeml·d the voluntt·t·r service organiztion as thc group that deserved the highest priority, McDonnell stated, "(because) the sl-rvi<.:e organiza­tions don't have much time to raise money, so they should be fundcd as fully as possihll'." The only volunteer st·rvicc or· ganization not to receive the full amount requested was the World llunger Coalition.

-FOCUS 
Fire hazards continue to exist at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, despite their efficient prevention systems. Bland emphasizl·s that a "major t·ause ti>r concern" at Notrc Daml· is the amount of building I materials that accumulate in the halls when students an· nmstrul't· ing things for their rooms. 
Another problem which adds to the risk of lire is storagt· of items such as furniture and cardboarll boxes. These items get crowded in­to areas which then become inac­n·ssible to eh:ctrkians and other maintenance people, Bland ex· plains. These problems, however, are easily takcn care of through the help of the hall rcctors and the stu­dents. 
Bland says that most residence hall tires are caused by carelessness, or students who "aren't paying at­tention to details." He explains that

Denis Healey,a moderate, was re-elected deputy leader of Britain's bitterly divided opposition Labor Party last night by a razor-thin margin over left-winger Tony Benn. In a runoff ballot at the party's annual conference, Healey received 50.4 percent of the vote to Benn's 49.6 percent in a runoff ballot at the party's annual conference. A third candidate, John Silken, also a left-winger, was eliminated on the first ballot. Benn's challenge was widely regarded as a bellwether of the 80-year-old Labor Party's future and that of British politics. The ballots, after being counted three times, were read to a hushed conference hall, which broke into loud applause. Healey apparently squeaked through on the strength ofabstentions by between 10 and 20 left-wing members of Parliament who had voted for Silken on the first ballot. -AP 
Prosecutors in San Francisco were deciding 
yesterday whether to seek a new trial and defense lawyers said they would ask for bail for Peoples Temple member Larry Layton, whose murder-conspiracy trial ended with a hung jury. U.S. District Judge Robert Peckham dclared a mistrial Saturday after the jury said it was "not possible" to decide Layton's guilt or innocence in the Nov. 18, 1978, slaying of U.S. Rep. Leo Ryan ofCalifornia on an airstrip in the Guyanese jungle. Defense attorney Tony Tamburello said he will seek to have Layton, 35, released on bail. Government attorneys refused to say whether they would retry the case. Prosecutors claim Layton plotted with the Rev. Jim Jones to kill Ryan, then boarded a truck for the Port Kaituma airstrip where Ryan, three journalists and a cult defector were g1,1nned down. -AP 
Former first lady Bess Truman was in serious condi­tion yesterday in Kansas City, Mo. after being hospitalized for a mild strok~ according to a spokeswoman for Research Medical Center here. Dr. Wallace Graham issued a statement saying the 96-year-old widow of former President Harry S. Truman was having trouble swallowing and was receiving oxygen, said Jackie Bergh. Graham also reported Mrs. Truman was receiving nutrients, including vitamins, proteins and fat emulsions, through a tube in her chest, Ms. Bergh said. The stroke was described by Graham as a transient ischmic attack involving a spasm ofa blood vessel. No further details were available as to its effect on Mrs. Truman, who was in a private room. -AP 
Atypical marriedworkerwith two children and weekly income of $400 will take home an extra $3.90 a week start­ing Thursday because of the tax cut recently enacted by Congress. Assuming the worker claims a withholding exemption for himself and each dependent and an extra one for itemized deductions, the federal income tax subtracted from each weekly paycheck will drop to $44.60 from the present $48.50. Ifthat worker earns $300 a week, the tax withheld will drop to $24 from $26.90; a $600 weekly earner will see withholding fall to $98.30 from $104.20. For the $700 ear­ner. tax withheld will drop $8 to S 130.90. -AP

carekss acts such as using ap­pliances with frayed wires and overloading the circuits of room outlets can lead to fires. Bland adds, however, that for the most part stu­dents arc very interested in fire prevention and they arc very good at taking directions and suggestions on tire safety. 
Notre Dame Housing Director Fr. Michael Hcppcn states that most problems with fire sakty at Notre Dame are handled through the hall rector. He explains that at the begin­ning ofthe year the rectors arc given a list oftire regulation~ and after that it is ''up to them ( tht· hall rectors) to foliO\\ the regulation~." 
Saint Maq '!>abo has it~ probkm~ with tire sakty. Saint Maq ·~ Direc­tor of Fiscal Affair~ Dick Linuown states that Saint .\1ary·s has in~talkd sprinkkr systems. smoke detectors and tire extinguishers which are all very effective; howl·vt-r. ~omt· problems do exist. 
One such problem is the theft and abuse of tire extinguishers. Lin­dower says that he stongly en· couragcs student~ not to tamper with the tire extinguishers. since, he stresses. they arc vitally important in a fire. 
Another problem is a lack of volume of the fire alarm in LcMans Hall. Students in certain area~> of LcMans could not hear the alarm when the drill took place, so the volume b now being upgraded. states Lindower. 
Student response to fire preven­tion ha~ been very positive, both Bland and Nugent agree. Bland says that fire prevention at Notre Dame works well because the students cooperate and the equipment is ex­cellent. 
Nugent summed up her feelings hy saying that the fire safety program at Saint Mary's is "very well-refined and serves the ntTds of the com­munity."

An average of three hundred stu· dents go through the deli line cvery wcck, Monday through Friday. Thcy have: their choicc ofdiffcrt·nt breads, mcats, chc:cses, sprcads, and gar· nishcs. Flaim said he feels the tuna !Ish is one of the biggest factors in 
the ovcrall studcnt satisfaction. 
A new crat·kcr display and an in· crcascd availihility of fresh fruit wcrc among otht·r changcs made. Flaim added "We made an effort toward a morc enjoyable dining hall decor by keeping tlowcrs on the tahlcs." Flaim urgnl studcnts to help kecp costs down by eating what they take and resisting the urge to carry fi>od out of tpt: dining hall, with the possible exception of a piece of fruit or an icc cl'l·am cone. 
He added that the students could 
also help by communicating their 
wants and needs. Students can make 
suggcstions in person, he said, or 
there is a hulll'lin board on the 
LeMans side of the dining hall ­
called the Bed Board -to which 
they can pin thck' request. 
There is also a fi1od committee that meets cvery month, Flaim said. This committee has a student government chosen rcprcsentativc from t'Vef}' dorm.

Notre Dame's field hockey team won two of 
five matches at this weekend's Sauk Valley (Mich.) tournament. The Irish lost their first two matches, 7-0 to Ohio University and 4-0 to Purdue, before coming back to beat Berea 1 1-0 in Saturday's action. Notre Dame opened yesterday's play with a 1-0 decision over Marion, before dropping its third match of the weekend, 2-1 to Bemidji State. The Irish will return to action this afternoon at 4:30, when they will take on Taylor on Alumni Field. -The Observer 
Tom Hartzell and Tom Robison each won 

three matches to lead Tom Fallon's men's tennis team to a second place tie in this weekend's Notre Dame InvitationaL held at the Courtney Tennis Center. The Irish won three of their four matches, the lone loss coming to the Broncos of Western Michigan in the opening match for both teams. A win in that match would have probably vaulted the Irish into a berth in the championship round against the University of Missouri, the tournament winner. ll)l addi­tion to Hartzell and Robison, freshmen Paul Najarian and Toin Pratt combined to post three wins as a doubles tandem. Notre Dame's three wins came against Purdue ( S-4 ), Illinois State ( S-1 ) and !\.1iami ofOhio (9-0). -The Obsen;er 
The Notre Dame women's volleyball team 
could manage only one win in three tries during this weekend's four­team Saint Mary's Invitational volleyball tournament, held at the An­gela Athletic Facility.

Miracle finish 
Roles reverse in Irish loss 
Turner fund 
Media Stats win benefit 

By KELLY SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
WEST LAYFAYETTE, IND. -A miracle finish I S-14 win took place in Notre Dame's game with Purdue Saturday, but this time it wasn't the Irish who snatched victory from the clutches ofdefeat. 
An aggressive Boiler dcfen~e and a never-say-die offense that gave Ger­ry Faust's squad fits all afternoon hung in there when it counted. Like so many contests between the intra­state rivals, this one went down to the wire, though the tables turned on Notre Dame and their patented last-minute heroic's. 
"I guess it was just our turn to lose one that way," said linebacker Bob Crable. 
Purdue coachJim Young credited _... the victory to more than just luck. "The effort by our players was out­
standing. We said before the game we'd have to play every play, some­thing we didn't do a week ago. It was 
a  great thing  for  our team  to  
achieve."  
Boiler  quarterback  Scott  

Campbell rallied his team for what 
he called the "biggest, mosi: emo­
tional win of my life." Behind 14-7 with 19 seconds remaining, he fired a seven-yard strike to flanker Steve Byrant in the cmlzone, then came back and ran the same play to the other side for a two-point convcr· sion that sealed Notre Dame's fate. 
"I asked my players to give me everything they had for this game," related Young. "They gave that, and a little bit more." 
"l thought Notre Dame was supposed to win that way, Gerry," noted one writer after the spectacle. "I thought so too," replied a dejected Faust.· "I've won a lot of games like this, but now's a heckuva time to have it come back and haunt

Though both offenses looked sluggish through most ofthe day, the game's final three minutes exploded with big plays, bringing the 70,007 fans in Ross-Adt: (third largest crowd in the stadium's history) to their feet. The two teams battled to a 7-7 stalemate until a three-play touchdown drive led by Phil Carter runs of IS, S, and 30 yards put the Irish on top late in the fourth quar­ter.

The Observer-Landon Turner Fund got off to a big start yesterday as a team of media all-stars defeated the Notre Dame basketball team in a softball encounter, 25-23. 
The game was played on Jake Kline Field before a good-sized cowd, and approximatdy lil I S was 
""' raised on the first day of the fund­raising drive. The Stars were led by ticket manager Steve Orsini, who drove in 12 runs, five of them in the first in­ning. The winners also got offensive hdp from two other unexpected sources. Athletic director Gene Cor­rigan hit two doubles in his two at­bats, andSouth Bend Tribune sports writer Forrest "Woody" Miller was two-for-two as wdl. The scoring punch was spread evenly among The Players. Tim Andree, Billy Varner and Tom Sluby each homered. Most of the team's runs came in a 14-run sixth inning, when The Players cut an 18-3 deficit to one run. 
Ja The proceeds from the game became the first installment in the fund designed to offset the medical bills ofIndiana University basketball player Landon Turner. Turner was left paralyzed in an automobile acci· dent in July, and is still hospitalized in Indianapolis. 
The predicted rain Ildd off, but a furious wind wrecked havoc with outfidders. The game was originally schedukd for seven innings, but the enthusiasm of both sides stretched the contest to nine. 
The afternoon was marked by a number of highlights: 
WNDU'sjeffjeffers made a diving stab of a drive at shortstop that brought the crowd to its feet and saved several runs. 
W AOR's Sid Schroyer made a run­ning catch of a long shot to left field an inning 1ater. That catch also kept several runs from crossing the plate. 
The Observer's own Kelly Sullivan amazed some skeptics when her stretch at firsfbase enabled Jeffers'_ throw to nip assistant basketball coachJim Baron and brought an end to the explosive sixth inning. 
Freshman basketball player Dan 
Duff made an auspicious debut 
when he left his pants behind on a 
head first slide into third base in the 
14-run explosion in the fifth inning. 
The Stars' pitcher, Mike Collins of WNDU, went the distance, settling down after the disastrous fifth inning to shut The Players off in the late going. 
Collins' counterpart, John Paxson also went the distance in a losing ef­fort. The stand-out guard also shared third-base coaching duties with backctturt mate Mike Mitchell. 
Conspicuous in his absence was 

These Notre Dame runners bunched together to help lead the 
head coach Digger Phdps. Phelps

What's going on here?

Ofcourse the logical question is, "Why?" 
How can a team that 'played with so much inspiration and intensity in front ofits own fans become listless on the road? Oh sure. Michigan and Purdue aren't LSU. but the fire that was in each player's eyes two weeks ago has burned out. 
The first question I heard after Saturday's fiasco was, "So what do you think of your Gerry Faust now?" I would hope that Notre Dame students are intelligent enough to differentiate between Gerry Faust the man and Gerry Faust the football coach. The man always has been, is, and will continue to be someone especially unique -friendly, cordial, intense, caring. The football coach on the other hand, rapidly is realizing that he has a few things to learn. 
People were quick to criticize Dan Devine the man 

after Dan Devine the coach made a mistake. At quite the opposite extreme, people now are saying, "I fed so sor· ry for Faust. He tries so hard." 
The Michigan loss hit Faust hard -very hard. Deep down he knew his 'team was not ready for the Wol· verines, but he v.owed that that would never happen again. Saturday, his team wasn't ready for a practice ses­sion, much less a game against a better-than-average team.
