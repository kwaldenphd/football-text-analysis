about it with a twist. 
Editor

Billions of dollars · (and probably more) are spent each year on various campaigns around the world; whether they are advertising, political. public service, etc. Advertising, public relations and other related fields often come under fire because of the vast amounts of money spent to persuade people to buy a particu­lar product or vote a certain way. The question that arises is ethics. 
Is it ethical to spend a..<;tronomical amount<; of money on packaging, bill­boards and television advertisements when people around the world and in our own country are living below the poverty level? . 
Is it ethical for cigarette companies to create advertising eampaigns advocating the eause to keep ehildren from smoking or to help eurrent smokers quit? 
Is it ethieal for presidential candidates to be allowed to aceept money from pri­vate donors who have eonneetions with major eompanies, or for that matter to accept money from major companies because of loopholes in our legal system? 
Is it etltieal for government oflieials to ereate advertising campaigns that throw a negative light on their opponents, but then to tum around and be the first to eomplain when it happens to them? 
Ethics, I would say, are like a conun­drum wrapped in an enigma ... and how­ever else that saying carries on. Basically, they're confusing and they're subjective. I would think. though. that in a society as advanced as ours where we know more and are able to do more than we have ever before, that we would have advanced our morals a..<; much as we have advanced our technology. 
Unfortunately, this isn't always the case. People lie. People cheat. People distort laws and situations bending and stretch­ing them so until they encompass their needs and actions. People spread rumors. People evade the truth. 
Oftentimes. in the consumerist society we have created, the self-serving bia..<; takes over. Human beings are competitive by nature; it's part ofour genetics. Sometimes people just go too far. 
There should be a line where ethics takes over and people know to stop. Unfortunately moral compasses don't always point north, and the line is either lost or smudged off the map. Depending on whom you ask, the line could be on dif­ferent sides of the world to begin with. 
Shouldn't there be a point in a situation when a majority of people should be able to realize and agree that something is no longer ethical? Isn't that why we come equipped with that little voice in our heads that tells us (hopefully) when we're doing something that isn't quite right? 
Maybe it's just the way of the world today, and ignoring ethics is something we all have to do to get by on occasion. I may be naive, but I'd like to think that there is hope.

"When you have a public square hostile to religious values ... who suffers?" Towey asked. "The poor do." 
Towey used a recent lawsuit against the Alliance for Catholic Education (ACE) as an example of how the poor suffer from a lack of religious volunteer organizations. ACE co-sponsored the lecture with the Center for Social Concerns.

Brown said she was excited and surprised Shappell and Andrichik chose her for the posi­tion. 
"I've been very impressed with what Lizzi and Bill have done in my work with them in the cam­paign," Brown said. "I know they have a lot of great initiatives that they want to get done next year, and I am excited to be a part of it." 
Brown said she feels her lead­ership experiences thus far will help her transition to the position of third in command of the stu­dent government. 
"I think I've done a good job this year in my position as Cavanaugh senator as far as bringing through initiatives that have been brought up," Brown many large secular nonprofits often squeeze out small, effective faith-based groups -even if the larger organizations are not very effective. 
"We don't measure success. There's no accountability ... You have to be incredibly inept to lose funding," Towey said. "It really is a cruel hoax to put forward a pro­gram that we're not going to [keep track oil" 
Towey said the federal govern­ment gave $2 billion to faith­based nonprofits last year, and that the amount continues to increase. 
He said when President Bush came into power, the president believed regulations in place were "forcing" faith-based groups to secularize in order to gain fund­ing. The groups were becoming less effective in the process, he said. 
"The little groups in the neigh­borhoods, often minority neigh­borhoods, that were not well-con­nected politically were cut off from funds," Towey said.

As CEA, Brown will serve as chair of the Executive Programming Board, coordinate Student Senate activities and run the daily logistics of the student government office.

High Court favors abortion protesters 
Associated Press 

WASIIINGTON -A 20-year-old legal light over protests outside abor­tion clinics ended Tuesday with the Supreme Court ruling that f'nderal extortion and racketoering laws can­not be used against demonstrators. 
The 8-0 decision was a setback for abortion clinics that were buoyed when the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals kept their case alive two years ago despite the high court's 2003 ruling that had eleared the way for lifting a nationwide injunction on anti-abortion leader Joseph Scheidler and others. 
Anti-abortion groups appealed to 
the justices after the lower court sought to determine whether the injunction could be supported by findings that protesters had made thrnats of violence. 
In Tuesday's ruling, Justice Stephen Breyer said Congress did not create "a freestanding physieal vio­lence offense" in the federal extor­tion law known as the Hobbs Act. 
Instead, Breyer wrote, Congress addressed violence outside abortion clinics in 1994 by passing the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which allows for court injunctions to set limits for such protests. 
"It's a great day !'or pro-lifers," said Troy Newman, prnsidnnt of' Operation Heseue. 

Kim Gandy, president of the National Organization for Women, said the decision was disappointing because the injunction had decreased violence outside dinics nationally. 
She said tho elinic accnss act is problematic becausn it requires abortion providers to sm1k injunc­tions "city by eity" and turns baek the elock to thn late 19H0s whnn NOW played eat and mousn with Opnration Heseue in trying to antiei­pate the cities and clinics that abor­tion protesters planned to targnt next.

On surfing naked 
It has been my privilege (and misfor­tune) to see many "hot" Internet trends come and go over the last few years. Most of them, while initially promising, never lived long enough to make any lasting mark on society, or even on other tech­nologies, and they were soon forgotten by everyone -except of course by their dumbstruck investors. 
The Internet, largely because of its novelty, has been both aided (commercially) and hindered (soeially) by attempts in the media and in business to define "what it all means." The major problem with this approach is that the Internet, just like any other freeliJrm collection of human inter­actions, has no actual goals, and very lit­tle focus. Local trends may shape the needs of Internet in the short term, but over the long haul it is moved by little else but sociology and psychology. Forgetting this, and forgetting the critical role of the individual, is the first step in creating a 
' soon-to-be failed dot-com, and the next unimportant trend. 
I bring this up because right now many pundil<> want to place blogs (and their cousins, like LiveJournal and MySpace) in this category of big-hype, low-impact tech­nologies. And worse, well-meaning parents and educators, having learned of these new social constructs from the media and believing that they understand their pur­pose and extent, are trying to restrict their sons' and daughters' access to these new media without first asking why they were interested in the first place. 
And actually, I don't entirely di<>agree 

Lance Gallop 
Tidewater Blues 
with either group on the underlying point, even though do I have a blog, (and I have no plans to dismantle it even ifblogs in general should fall out of favor). I think most of the current attraction is pure hype, and so the entire phenomena, as it is understood in the m·edia, is not worth much long-term attention. Blogs are too hyped and too misunderstoud, and there will shortly come a day when the blog-bub­ble will collapse, around the same time that people realize that there is not really money in blogs or blogging. 
I look forward to this day because I think that the current emphasis on blogging and on iL<> "moral," "moneymaking" or "popu­larity building" potential completely misses the real and significant trend of what blogs are doing, and what they have done, to the Internet and which gives a major hint toward were it may be going. 
In truth, a blog is nothing more than a publishing tool-an easy to use Web based interface that permits almost eflort­less personal publishing and community building, without the normal technical knowledge. It has always been possible liw a person to create something like a blog on the Internet, but only lately have program­mers worked together to make the task triviaL · 
Unfortunately, once blogs took off, their early writers began focusing on areas that called certain kinds of attention to them: foreign policy, politics and news. This iS the cause of the blog hype: politicians who were taken unaware and paranoid media companies who wondered ifblogs were a threat to their entrenched business model. This initial interest drew more individuals to blogging, but only as a pale clone of the earliest journalist/bloggers, in the hopes of emulating some of that fame. 
However, these media blogs are only business as usual. They are the direct equivalent of a bricks-and-mortar compa­
ny that cwates a Web site in order 4J move 
its business online but which otherwise 
does not alter il<> business model. 
The real power of blogs, and the real 
future of the Internet, does not lie in tl1ese 
popular media commentaries. It lies in the 
unseen blogs. There are, at last count, 
between 30 and 40 million blogs, the vast 
majority of which are written by teenagers 
lilr their immediate friends or for some 
small, but dosely-knit Internet community 
(such as DeviantART). The younger the 
blogger, tho greater the probability that he 
or she will share something quite personal, 
and in many cases, shockingly remarkable 
in iL<> naked honesty. 
It is this spiritual nudity, which also takes 
other limns depending on the artistic taste 
of the author, that I think hints at the 
future of the Internet. Blogs are important 
because they are a sort of vast soeial group 
therapy, created by a collection of other­
wise uninhibited people who have discov­
ered that, in this case, there may be more 
to gain from opmmess than from privacy. 
What was once confined to a book and 
read, perhaps, by a rnally nosy little sister 
is now sprnad, with il<> author's blessing, to 
the entire world. 
And iftl1is trend lasL<>, if the psychology 
of the computer screen, which gives both · intimacy and great distance and which 
completely changes what is "public" and 
what is "porsonal" takes hold, then the 
widespread social impact of this trend will 
dwarf anything a political blog could ever 
dream of attaining.

For nxample, I am willing to admit that what appears to me to be a highly uneonvnntional stratngy of complete abandonment of a low post game, coupled with an alternative strategy of "have two guards dribble it around with no other motion or oll'-the-ball screening and then dwek up a thren-ball from 35-feet with one seeond loft on the shot clock and two hands in your fan~ ... is a potentially more cutting­edge, sophisticated, winning strategy than tho trind-and-trun approach of feeding the low post f(lr two to four-foot bueket<; or a li1ul shot ovory other timn down the floor. I will also admit that it may bo incmdibly innovative to take the rarely pursued approach of rneruiting only two eolleg<H~al­iber big men during six years as eoach and combinP that with a complete laek of atten­tion to teaching those players how to play the low post so <L'> to ensurn no-semblance of an inside game <L<; an option lhr your oll\msn lhr thrm~ straight sea'ions.

These may be the mandates of' a true visionary, and it is not lilr me to suggest that other programs, lilr example, Indiana and Duke, which have combined li1r seven national championships via total commit­ment to dnfense and fundamentals, know any bett1~r than the curnmt Notre Dame eoaehes as to how to aehiove success on the eourt. 
llowover, I do feel qualified to state that at Notm Dame, where cxeP.IIence in men's b<L'ikotball was once a staple (see long-f(Jr­gotten nra from 1973-1981), mediocre-to­awful basketball as displayed in such his­torieally astounding fashion the past three years, should never be accepted. Tho ques­tion is: why has Notre Dame, which is arguably the national bnnchmark or com­bined academic and athletic excellence, tol­erated essentially two decades of non-exis­tent mnn's basketball? At a school that annually eompetes for national honors in women's soceer, women's basketball, fenc­ing, cross eountry, baseball, women's ten­nis and lacrosse, why has the administra­tion treated the men's basketball program Like the infirmed little sibling, as if unable to meet the standards to whieh everyone else in the family is held? This is particu­larly galling and ironic given that the lega­cy of suceess in men's basketball at Notre Dame needs to take a back seat to no other program on campus, save to that of the football program. 
Perhaps the "soft bigotry of low expecta­tions" surrounding men's basketball h<L'i come directly from the head coach alone. We certainly have all grown weary of his pathetic six-year running refrain of "we are just trying to steal enough wins to make it on to the tournament bubble." A.-, likely, I suspect it is the combined failing of the head coach's vision and that of the ath­letic director, who hailing from Arizona State, may have no working knowledge of Notre Dame's once-high standards of excel­lence in men's basketball; after all, this is the same athletic director who tolerated the Davie era far too long, panicked in hastily selecting two consecutive unworthy coaches for the football program (as if he never considered that Davie would ever

leave as head coach), had to be ordered to fire tho last football coach when it wa'> obvious that success would never be in the offing and then, again, having not learned his previous lesson, pathetically pandered to the wrong coaching target again (in Utah) in a very public and embarrassing manner. Hegardless of where this tolerance of mediocrity originated, the curmnt prob­lem at Notre Dame is not that "the land­scape of college basketball ha<; changed since Digger was the coach" or that "the JACC nneds to be renovated and new prac­tice facilities are necessary" or "the aea­demie standards impnde mcruiting the best playnrs." The curront problem is that the Notrn Dame leadership needs to a<;sign the same high standard to men's basketball as it does to football and every other sport at the school. When University Prnsidcnt Fathnr John Jenkins overhauled tho !(lOt­ball program 14 months ago, he statnd that, in order for Notrn Dame to bn suc­cessful in football, they needed to succeed "ethically, academieally and with wins on the lield." Out of simple respect for the cur­rent players on the basketball roster, that same mandate needs to be applied imme­diately to the men's b<L'iketball program. Thanks to a lack of accountability and high standards for the basketball team, Chris Quinn, a splendid basktltball player who might otherwise be this generation's John Paxson, has gone to the NCAA tournament once in his four years of labor at Notre Dame. For the administration to allow the men's basketball program to continue to languish in its current vegetative state does a disservice to all the younger players on the team, the incoming recruits, the stu­dent body who support the team and those who built this once-storied program. 
A.-, a final point, I would remind the administration that, the last time I checked, the men's basketball coaching position at Notre Dame was indeed a "job," not a vol­unteer camp counselor position. In fact, I suspect it ranks as one of the most highly­compensated positions at the University. As such, there should be fundamental standards and milestones which are required to be met. As an ordinary exam­ple, in my job as a new faculty member at a university medical center, I was given . three years of fmancial support up front, with the stipulation that I would achieve external (National Institutes of Health) grant funding to pay the entirety of my salary and research budget by the end of that time frame. If I failed in those goals, I would be at imminent risk of losing my university support and position. By virtu­ally any other professional standard, six 
years is plenty of time to objeetivoly assi~ss the milestones achieved by this basketball program. Short of simply existing, it is not eloar what goals am bPing met, other than the most dubious ones of failing to qualify for the 12-tnam Big East tourna­ment and having the worst confenmce weord in Notro Damn's history. I would submit to the administration that simply holding the men's basketball coach to standards that are appropriatn li1r Notn Dame would be a good place to start. For example, 1) annually compete lilr th1~ Big East conference title. 2) Annually finish in the top 10 or tho national rankings. 3) Annually compntn for one of tho top 16 sends in the NCAA tournamnnt braekd. If theso goals semn outrageous, consider that from 1970-1981, Notn~ Dame lin­ishnd in the top tm1 final national rankings seven times and garnerod sevnralnurnb1r. one to four scndings in tlw NCAA tourna­ment! Consider also that Notrn Damn is the ll th winningnst mon's basketball pro­gram in NCAA history (behind Indiana and ahead of UCLA) and has thn second­most 2,000-point scorers in NCAA history. DiggQr Phelps obviously undnrstood Emerson's fundamental tenet of human competition: "You have to aim abovo tho target to hit the target!" 
The history of college athletics has shown, more than at any other level, the impact that the right eoaeh can have at the right institution. The basketball pro­grams at UClA and Indiana como to mind as good examples. I work at an institution, Duke University, which, in 1982, had a comparable, if not inferior, history of achievement in men's basketball com­pared to Notre Dame's to that point. In that year, a single individual, a now head coach, came to that university, which had an antiquated arona and mediocre pra(:­tice facilities, and through his shncr, unrn­lenting commitment to excellence, they have become what they like to be eonsid­ered, "the Notre Dame of collngn basket­ball." Notre Damn needs a baskntball coach and athletic dirnctor who, recogniz­ing Notre Dame's own legacy in men's basketball, will commit to bring the Irish back to the top of the rankings, not to a seat on the annual bubble. And anyone who doubts the impact that hiring thn right coach can make for an institution should ask the men who hirod Charlie Weis at Notre Dame.

EDITORIAL CARTOON 



In other nominations, Spielberg's "Munich," mired in controversy and less­than-stellar box office returns, seems like an after­thought (though it garnered a few key nominations). while George Clooney finally comes into his own as a reg­ular Orson Welles with no 

.less than three nominations (acting, directing and writing, and his film "Good Night and Good Luck" was also nom­inated for Best Picture). 
In an unusual turn of events, all five of the Best Picture nominees were matched by nominations for their directors, something that has only happened three times before (in 1957, 1964 and 1981). 
While few of these categories are wide­open races, there's also no Scorsese, which means no guaranteed loser either. The 78th Annual Academy Awards will be aired on Sunday at 8 p.m. on ABC. Here's a look at the major categories: 
Best Picture What will win: Brokeback Mountain Why it will win: Bluntly put, there's not a 
whole lot of competition. "Crash" may be the closest contender, but· mixed critical consensus and the ensemble cast will sink its chances. "Brokeback Mountain" has work, as Hoffman controls "Fargo, " has ther the film with a perfectly been an Oscar ra~ modulated performance, 
oriented around s
proving once and for all that the one-time character many smaller film, 
actor is capable of carrying a picture by himself. Hoffman is an actor known for disappearing into his characters, and his affected turn as the eponymous ornery writer-journalist is both memorable and effective. The Academy will certainly not overlook Hoffman, who has become a criti­cal favorite over the years. 
Who should win:. Heath Ledger, "Brokeback Mountain" 
Why he should win: His staggeringly brave performance -an absolute revela­tion. Ledger does so much with so little that he commands the screen throughout "Brokeback Mountain," acting as the aching emotional core of the fllm, anchor­ing it with such presence that it's hard to believe that this is an actor whose past credits indude "A Knight's Tale" and 'Ten Things I Hate About You." His turn as the cowboy Ennis is heartbreaking in its emo­tional scope and breathtaking in its meas­ured control. Without doubt one of the best performances of the year, it should instant­ly move Ledger to the top of the A-list in Hollywood and make him a future Academy Award candidate.

best things about Fernando Meirelles' largely inconsistent "The Constant Gardener." ller steady performance as the aetivist Tessa gavn thn film an emotional anehor and she brought strong emotional impact to the difficult role. Weisz, whose prnvious crAdits include "The Mummy" and "Envy," has Amerged as the leading critical favorite after a win at the Golden Globes. An acting award here would also be an award for "The Constant Gardener" as a whole, which failed to garner any other major nominations. 
Who should win: Catherine Keener, "Capote"

Best Original Screenplay 
Who will win: Paul Haggis and Bobby Moresco, "Crash" 
Why they will win: Quentin Tarantino once quipped that the screenplay Oscar is the consolation prize for being the hippest f11rn of the year. And no film was hipper than "Crash," with its interlocking story­lines, clever dialogue and topical subject matter. Haggis' script for "Million Dollar Baby" lost to 1\lexander Payne's "Sideways" last year, so expect a win here for the tal­ented writer/director. 
Who should win: George Clooney and Grant 1-Ieslov, "Good Night and Good Luck" 
Why they should win: Clooney and lleslov's acute, insightful screenplay isn't as flashy as Haggis' work on "Crash," but it is 
in many ways more 
impressive. The examina-, 
in a better film, and that makes her performance stand out more. None of the actresses in this eategory dominated thnir picture (Weisz alongside Ralph Fiennes, K(~ener alongside Hoffman. Michelle Williams alongside Ledger), but KAnner held her own against Hoffman, which is no small feat. She did the same against Steve Carrell in "The 40 Year-Old Virgin," which, while slightly easier than playing against Hoffman, is still diflicult. 
Best Adapted Screenplay 
· Who will win: Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, "Brokeback Mountain" 
Why they will win: This is a tough call. The screenplay for "Brokeback Mountain" has been mocked almost as much as it has been praised, but it is still a solid achieve­ment. The writing is generally good, aside from a few poor lines (all of which appar­ently made it into the film's trailer). MeMurtry is a Pulitzer Prize-winner, which should give him some leverage with 1\cademy voters who like his prestige fac­tor. 
Who should win: Dan Futterman, "Capote" 
Why he should win: Futterman's screen­play for "Capote" is about as measured and exquisite as they come. Overshadowed by llofl'rnan's pnrforrnance, it's easy to forget just how well written this film is -yet the skillful dialogue and strong characteriza­tion is evident throughout. Futterman, who was also executive producer of thA film, is better known as an actor (he starred in "The Birdeage" and the TV show "Judging !\my") but it's obvious that he could have quite the earner in screenwriting. 

Night and Good Luck" sur­vives on the strength of its words alone. The writing 
handles a controversial topic with grace, fortitude and even a little style.

..... . SCENE FEATURE 
Cinematic combat: Hollywood's modem warfare 
By SEAN SWEANY 
Scene Writer 
Plato once famously said, "Only the dead have seen an end to war." For film fans, this means there will never be an end to war movies. · 
Since the invention of cinema, war films have come in various types and styles. With the arrival of computer­technology, war films about contempo­rary war have undergone broad trans­formations in the years before and after the turn of the twentieth century. The Thin Red Line (1998) 
This serious, brooding film from Terrence Malick details the ordeals, emotions and struggles of a young band of Marines fighting at Guadalcanal dur­ing World War II. Sean Penn headlines the all-star cast that also includes Adrien Brody, George Clooney and John 
C. Heilly. As with every other Malick film, "The Thin Red Line" is clearly his brainchild, a film he spent many years developing. Malick's cinematography is both superb and unique, especially in battle scenes. The most distinctive fea­ture is the film's slow pace. The three­hour-long movie uses numerous flash­backs that highlight the difference between war and home and ultimately question the pain and evil associated with war. 
Three Kings (1999) 
"Three Kings" can best be described as a comedic war movie. It begins at the end of the Gulf War, when three American soldiers try to find and steal Saddam Hussein's gold amid the turmoil and confusion at the end of Operation Desert Storm. The war scenes provide realistic and authentic visuals, and the comedy stems from good performances from Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and even rapper-turned-actor Ice Cube. Director David 0. Russell crafts a movie that is smart and intelligent, and he manages to provide a good moral lesson at the end. There is also a distinct style to "Three Kings," a gritty, bleached feel that makes the viewing experience vis­ceral and powerful, as if one were really living and fighting in the sands of Iraq. 

Black Hawk Down (2001) 
Ridley Scott's "Black Hawk Down" relates how a standard U.S. military operation in Mogadishu, Somalia went terribly wrong on Oct. 3, 1993. The acclaimed director assembled a stand­out cast featuring Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor and Eric Bana in this intense and bloody film. Unlike most other war movies, "Black Hawk Down" completely forgoes any political or cultural pretens­es and depicts events strictly from the point of view of the soldiers. During filming, Scott created a 360-degree war with pyrotechnics and used dozens of hidden cameras to film the reactions of the actors. As a result, the actors exhibit a genuine fear that viewers can feel and comprehend. This film is so successful because of the frankness with which it allows viewers to experience both the horrors and heroics of war. 
Saving Private Ryan (1998) 
Without doubt the best war movie in recent history -and perhaps the great­est war film of all time -Steven Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan" is a masterpiece. Tom Hanks is the leader of a military unit that must venture behind enemy lines to rescue a comrade after experiencing the dread of the D-Day invasion at Normandy. The opening minutes of the film constitute some of the most graphic war footage ever, and a constantly moving camera adds to the total chaos of the situation. 

After the surreal D-Day invasion, "Saving Private Ryan" becomes a char­acter study of men at war who must decide whether orders from distant superiors are moral and feasible. Incredible performances by all the actors, especially Hanks, dominate the rest of the movie and leave viewers pon­dering powerful themes and questions long after the movie ends. 

While it is possible to debate whether a good war film must either be for or against war, it may be more accurate to say that good war films depict charac­ters with whom an audience can sympa­thize and relate. 
Films like these four allow viewers to experience war realistically in order to understand and discuss its implications beyond the walls of a theater or living room.

MOVIE REVIEW 

Human characters fail to eclipse canine standards 
By ERIN MCGINN Scene Critic 
"Eight Below" is an inspirational story with a very strong message ­animals are far better actors than

-· humans. The movie is based on a true story from 1957. A fierce blizzard forced two Japanese scientists to evacuate their station, and the helicopter that took them to their ship didn't have room for their 15 sled dogs. The scientists were so certain a rescue team would be back soon that they chained the dogs to posts. But the storm made the rescue impossible. When the scientists finally got a ride back 11 months later, they were shocked and thrilled to find two of ute dogs had freed themselves and survived. "Antarctica," Koreyoshi Kurahara's 1983 movie about 
When geologist Dr. McLaren (Bruce Greenwood, "Thirteen Days") hires Gerry to take him to a remote moun­tain region, they get caught in a killer snowstorm, and McLaren gets badly hurt. Thanks to the heroic dogs, McLaren survives, and both men make it back to the base camp. 
The eight dogs are then --left behind when the exploration team has to sud­denly make an emergency evacuation. Gerry agrees to leave them because he thinks it's only going to be hours before they can return for the dogs, but a sec­ond trip turns out to be impossible ­and so begins the saga of the dogs' sur­vival. 
The movie switches back and forth between Gerry's efforts to return for his dogs and the story of the brave dog team's fight to survive alone in the wilderness. The film is at its best when it goes to the dogs. Not only are they

stand out against the beautiful backdrop of Antarctica (which was actually filmed in Canada and Greenland). Their struggles on the ice, complete with a ferocious attack by a Jeopard seal, are reminiscent of the highly successful "March of the Penguins." 
The people, not the animals, are where this movie falls to pieces. None of the characters ever experience any real development -they only serve to take the action away from the dogs and make the movie run longer than it should. While Walker isn't bad as the scientist Shepard, he also isn't very convincing in his role. 

There is also an undeveloped and pointless love interest between him and the pilot, played by Moon Bloodgood. Jason Biggs is Walker's friend on the research team and is meant to provide comic relief, but serves instead as a good indicator of when it is safe to go to the bathroom or refill a tub of pop­corn. 

With a little tweaking "Eight Below" could have been a great movie ­namely if they edited out the people and let the movie be strictly about the dogs. But overall, '"Eight Below" is a good movie worth watching for the endearing performances of the eight dogs.

BENGAL BOUTS 

Schaefer dominates Albonetti in quarterfinals 
By GREG ARBOGAST and JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writers 
Senior Greg Schaefer dominated his fight with graduate student Phil Albonetti, as he earned a unanimous decision victory in the 160-pound weight division Tuesday. 
Schaefer was the more aggres­sive of the two fighters, and he had Albonetti on the defensive for the entire evening. Schaefer was able to land repeated combos as Albonetti often retreated after the initial punch. 
Schaefer was often able to pin Albonetti into the corner, which allowed him to unleash some of his combos. In the third round, the ref had to stop the fight at one point to allow Albonetti to recover from one of Schaefer's combos. 
Charlie Gough vs. Andrew Massari 
Senior Charlie Gough finished strongly in his fight with freshman Andrew Massari to earn a unani­mous decision in the 165-pound weight division. 
In the fmal round, Gough took over a fight that was fairly even through the first two rounds as he consistently landed punches on Massari. Near the end of the round, Gough landed a combo that caused Massari to start bleed­ing and forced the ref to stop the fight. 
Gough continued this momen­tum immediately after the time­out as he landed multiple punches to the face of Massari right before the bell rang signaling the end of the match. 
Christopher Jordan vs. Adam Burns 
Junior Adam Burns used an aggressive style to narrowly defeat sophomore Christopher Jordan by a split decision in their 165-pound division fight. 
Burns opened the fight quickly as he threw a furious combination of punches, landing a couple to the body and face. Jordan countered by using his long reach, which allowed him to land consistent punches. The ref had to stop the fight twice. 
Burns, however, continued to land punches throughout the fight, including a final combo right before the final bell rang. The ref had to stop the fight once in the third round to check on Jordan. 
Stephen Hansen vs. Brad Amiri 
Junior Stephen Hansen domi­nated MBA student Brad Amiri as Hansen won a unanimous deci­sion in the 165-pound weight divi­sion. 
Hansen was on the attack all night, repeatedly forcing his oppo­nent into a defensive position on the ropes. Amiri often succumbed helplessly to vicious combos from Hansen, and the judges easily awarded the victory to Hansen. 
Mike Hazlebeck v. Billy Hederman 
-Law student Billy Hederman defeated sophomore Mike Hazlebeck by knockout in the sec­ond round in the last quarterfinal of the 165-pound weight class. 
Hazlebeck started off punching very frenetically, throwing many punches but only landing a few of them. Hederman took advantage of Hazlebeck's wild punching and went on the attack. While Hazlebeck danced around the ring, Hederman waited stoically in the middle, defending himself while landing his own onslaught. 
By the second round, Hazlebeck had taken a good deal of punish­ment, leading the referee to stop the fight. 
Brian Nicholson v. Stephen "The Wrecker" Klein 
Law student Brian Nicholson used his height and his aggressive nature to defeat junior Stephen "The Wrecker" Klein in a unani­mous decision in the first 170­pound quarterfinal. 
In the first round, Klein was able to get in close and tried com­binations and uppercuts, but was unable to overwhelm his oppo­nent. Nicholson came out aggres­sively in the second round, using an onslaught of various combina­tions to take the upper hand in the bout. 
Michael "The Uberator" O'Connely v. Gregory "Busta" 
Brown 
Senior Michael "The Liberator" O'Connely was able to avoid a strong attack from Gregory "Busta" Brown in the first round and came back to win the fight by knockout early in the third round. 
Brown attacked O'Connely with an almost constant onslaught in the first round, but his punches were so wild that it appeared that not even Brown knew where they were going to land. Luckily for Brown, many of these early attacks did connect, but not enough to give him the clear advantage in the fight. 
Early in the third round, O'Connely resumed his attacks on Brown, so much so that the refer­ee had to stop the fight in the third in a knockout victory for O'Connely. 
Jeffrey Schaal v. O'Neil "Prime Time" Peart 

Junior O'Neil "Prime Time" Peart was able-to stay competitive at the start of his fight with senior Jeffrey Schaal, but quickly lost control of the round and the fight, losing by a knockout in the third. 
Schaal showed his agility and quickness throughout the fight, dancing around Peart, who stood in the center of the ring. The jun­ior was able to move in and out quickly, delivering his attack and while not letting Peart counter. He used this advantage throughout the round, easily hitting Peart hard in the head and body. 
Peart was lucky enough to make it to the third round, as he was saved by the bell in each of the first two rounds, but could not escape the third, when he was knocked out. 
Brian Kantar v. Andrew Breslin 
In the final quarterfinal of the 170 pound weight class, senior Andrew Breslin delivered an enor­mous uppercut in the second round to defeat freshman Brian Kantar. 
Breslin had tried to use his uppercuts earlier in the first round, but Kantar was too quick for him, countering with quick jabs. The first was a relatively equal match, with the two fighters trading punches throughout the round. 
But the freshman-could do noth­ing to defend himself from the knockout punch in the second, after which the referee was com­pelled to stop the fight, giving the win to Kantar. 
Daniel "Pound Town" Ward v. Andy "Doogie".Houser 
The first fight in the 180 pound division was a blowout by junior Daniel ''Pound Town" Ward over fellow junior Andy "Doogie" Houser. 
Ward had the clear advantage in height, speed and strength, and merely toyed with Houser for three rounds. Almost none of Houser's punches landed because Ward was able to block or dodge most of them. Ward would then attack Houser quickly and move away to avoid any counterattack. 
Robert Lochridge v. Brian Bylica 
The bout between seniors Robert Lochridge and Brian Bylica featured wild, frantic punching by both fighters, result­ing in a split decision win for Lochridge. 
Lochridge and Bylica traded punches for much of the first round, but Lochridge took the advantage by working Bylica's body at the end of the round. Brian fought back throughout the second, forcing Lochridge to go on the defensive, including being forced by the referee to have a standing eight count. 
In a relatively equal third round, Lochridge was the slightly better fighter and won in a split decision. 
Jeffrey "The Golenator" Golen v. Ben O'Brien 
Despite throwing many big punches, sophomore Ben O'Brien lost to senior Jeffrey "The Golenator" Golen in a unanimous decision. 
One of the biggest assets for Golen in the fight was O'Brien's inaccuracy, which left him wide open to counterattacks. In the sec­ond round, O'Brien was able to slightly even things up, but Golen was still stronger throughout the round.. 
Eric Retter v. Daniel Stypula 
The last 180-pound quarterfinal was a sloppy fight between juniors Eric Retter and Daniel Stypula, one that Stypula won in a split decision. 
The two traded punches throughout the fight, but many of the punches thrown were highly inaccurate. Retter started off strong in the second round, chas­ing Stypula around the ring, but was not able to take a clear advantage over his opponent due to a high rate of missed punches. Retter was more aggressive in the third round, but Stypula was able to land several punches, giving him the win in a split decision. · 
Pat Bloniarz v. Peter Courtney 
The first cruiserweight fight of this year's Bengal Bouts featured a knockout win for sophomore Peter Courtney over freshman Pat Bloniarz by knockout in the first. 
After three consecutive big hit<> by Courtney, Bloniarz already was in a standing eight count, and would receive his second in the first round shortly thereafter. Courtney hit him with just a few more punches until the referee stopped the fight in the first, advancing Courtney to the semifi­nals. 
Patrick K. Ryan v. Benford Begay 
A relatively equal fight between sophomore Patrick K. Ryan and freshman Benford Begay ended abruptly in tl1e third round when Begay went down suddenly with what appeared to be a di<>located jaw. 
The fight started off in favor of Ryan, who used his height advan­tage to stop Begay. Begay tried to get in low against Ryan, and deliv­er combinations as a counterat­tack. 
Ryan continued to work tliese combinations in the second and third rounds while Begay began to fight higher, attacking Ryan's face and evening up the fight. 

In the middle of the third round, Begay suddenly and quickly went to the mat, although he was not hit. The referee stopped the fight then and checked on the fresh­man, who stood up and was fine after being treated by the medical staff on site. Ryan was declared the winner by knockout in. the third round. 
Patrick Mcinerney v. Chiistopher Nanovic 
The first heavyweight fight of the evening, between S!Jphomore Patrick Mcinerney and junior Christopher Nanovic, was another sloppy fight characterized by wild · punches. 
The wild punching was mainly done by Nanovic, who swung frantically at Mcinerney without hi-tting him consistently. Mcinerney, on the other hand, was able to get in some big hits in the second round to gain the clear ­advantage. He won in a unani­mous decision. 
Clarence Ervin Ill v. Kevin Lynch 
The evening's penultimate fight featured senior Clarence Ervin III knocking out law student Kevin Lynch in the third round. 
Although the first round was mostly defensive, with the two boxers protecting themselves and trying to get a read on the other fightflr, the second round was very aggressively fought, especially by Ervin. Ervin attacked Lynch, working the face throughout the round and forcing multiple stand­ing eight counts. Ervin was still much stronger than Lynch in the third, and won by knockout early in the third round. 
Matt "Bad to the" Bono v. John Bush 
The final quarterfinal bout was a heavyweight match-up bfltween freshman Matt "Bad to the" Bono and junior John Bush, who won the fight in a unanimous decision. 
Bush started off the fight aggressively, keeping Bono at bay with his advantage in height and reach. But Bono was still able to respond somewhat by getting inside on occasion and working the body. 
Bono came out strong in the third round, but was too tired from Bush's onslaught, leading to the junior's victory by unanimous decision.

NFL 


Associated Press 

NEW YOHK -NFL labor talks broke off Tuesday three days before the start of free agency, leaving teams and players in a quandary about negotiat­ing now contracts. 
Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFL Players Association, spent tho last throe days meeting in New York and Washington with commissioner Paul Tagliabu11. 
"We're deadlocked. There's nowhere to go," Upshaw said. "There's no rnason to continue meet­ing." 
The NFL acknowledged the talks had broken oiT and said no further discus· sions were scheduled. The league said it would not extend Friday's deadline for the start of free agency. 
Although the contraet docs not expire until after the 2007 season, this is a critical period in the nego· tiations to extend the 12­year-old agreement. Talks have been going on for more than a year. 
Free agency is scheduled to start Friday. If the deal is not extended, this would be the last year with a salary cap, so agents and team o!Ticials want to know how to structuro contracts. 
For example, if thern is no extension, the salary cap is expected to be about $95 million this sea­son and annual raises after 2006 in a long·tlmn deal would be limited to 30 percent. II' the deal is extended the cap could be $10 million or more high­er. 
The sides have agreed on a numbnr of issues. The biggest one is changing the formula for the amount of money to go to the players from "designated gross revenues" -primarily tel· evision and ticket salns ­to "total gross nwenues," which include almost every bit of money a team generates. 
They differ, IH>WilVI1r, on the pnrenntagn of.revnnuns 

to b11 allocated to the play­ers -the union is asking for (J() pnrcent and the league's current offer is 
56.2 pnrennl. 
But there are also dis­putns among groups of owners on that issue, too. Tagliabun has called a league ment.ing in Nnw York for Thursday. 
Teams with lower rnv­enuns -mostly small­market dubs -say that if the contributions to thP playnrs' fund an1 equally a p p or t i o n P d a m o n g :{ 2 franl'.hisns, tlwy will have

NFL DRAFT

impresses experts 
Cutler wows scouts ·at pre-draft combine 
Associated Press NASHVILLE, Tenn. -Jay Cutler will be leaving Vanderbilt with much more than an excellent education. Cutler, who was Indiana's Class 3A All-State quarter­back in 2000 at Heritage Hills, is the current hot topic of the NFL draft, shooting so far up the charts after a strong performance at the combine that some analysts now consider him the top 
player Ron Mercer. 
Cutler started wowing coaches and scouts at the Senior Bowl with his strong arm and decision-making. Not working out at the com­bine wasn't much of a consid­eration, and it's paid off with NFL Network analyst Mike Mayock calling Cutler the top qu&rterback in the draft. 
"He's a fan of mine, so I'm a fan of his," Cutler said. 
Other raves came from Sean Payton, the new coach of the New Orleans Saints, who hold the No. 2 pick over­all. He compared Cutler to a young

De. La Hoy a ready to defend his WBC belt 
Associated Press 
BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. ­With their fight more than two months away, Oscar De La Hoya and Ricardo Mayorga are tun­ing up with some verbal spar­ring. 
The 33-year-old De La Hoya has said he hopes to close out his career with the May 6 bout against Mayorga, and a grand finale against either Floyd Mayweather Jr. or Felix Trinidad in September. 
Mayorga, a wild-swinging WBC champion from Managua, Nicaragua, talked a great game on Tuesday, saying that he intends to spoil De La Hoya's plans. 
"This clown sitting here to my right has disrespected me," the animated Mayorga said at a news conference. "He keeps saying that he's going to be fighting in September or October, like he's fighting a nobody in May. 
''I'm the champion. You've got to recognize that. My strongest hand is my right hand. You see his eye? I'm going to detach his retina," Mayorga said through a translator. 
"I recognize that at one point that you were a great champi­on. But I'm going to prove on May 6 that you have nothing left in the. tank. You remind me 

Traditionally, the worst team in the Southeastern Conference? A program that last had a quarterback draft­ed in 1990 -in the long­defunct 12th round? 
Now you know why Cutler was determined not only to attend the combine that con­cluded earlier this week, but also answer every question and run every drill. 
"With Matt and Vince not working out, the spotlight wasn't going to be on them. It was going to have to go some­where else. That was the rea­son I wanted to step up and throw and get some of that media attention and kind of ride that wave a little bit," the SEC player of the year said Tuesday. 
"You want to try to keep your name positive in the media as much as possible up until the draft." 
So what if he nearly rallied the Commodores to victory in double overtime at Florida or beat Tennessee last November for Vandy's first 

-
victory in the series since 1982? Young almost single­handedly led Texas to a national championship last season. Leinart left USC with two national titles and a Reisman Trophy on his resume. But the 6-foot-3, 223-pound Cutler from the southern Indiana town of Santa Claus has a strong arm and was smart enough to be accepted by the SEC's only private uni­versity, a picky school that 
"He's one of the 
best quarterbacks ever. But I've got a long way to go before that comparison is going to be a reality." 
The idea that Cutler might be among the first five draft picks hasn't hit him yet. Vanderbilt's best-known quarterback drafted by the NFL was Bill Wade, the top pick in 1952.

of an old lady that's past her prime that should be sitting home in a rocking chair doing nothing." 
De La Hoya sat staring coldly at Mayorga. 
At one point, after Mayorga said he was going to bust up De La Hoya's face, the two traded shoves before others quickly stepped in to separate them. 
When De La Hoya's time at the podium came, he spoke in a measured tone. 
"This will be," he said and then took a long pause, "the fight of my life. I've never had

any anger toward anybody, or disrespect, except for one man out there who got knocked out," De La Hoya said, ostensibly alluding to Fernando Vargas. "This guy here, May 6, believe me, he will get knocked out. 
"He's throwing fuel at the flame. I'm not a talker at all, but inside the ring, he's going to pay." 
Again staring at Mayorga, De La Hoya added, "''m not afraid of you at all, nothing. Fighters are not afraid. But inside the ring, I'm going to knock you out. Believe it."

Through seven holes in Monday's first round, he was playing near-bogey golf, shooting five-over par. 
"If I had just played even over the first seven holes, I would have won the tournament," 
Baldwin said. 
Baldwin set­tled down after that and played solid golf. His recovery was important given his desire to play the tournament in remembrance of his father. 
"I dedicated this tournament to my dad," he ent he would have been proud of. 

"I guess his birthday present was the 12 birdies," said Baldwin, who is entering his forth and final season for the Irish. 
If Baldwin has it his way, he'll be able to dedicate a bit more than 12 birdies to his dad later this spring. 
"We, as a team, obviously want to reach the ultimate goal -the N a tiona! Championship," Baldwin said. "This was just the beginning of our championship run."

mistic about the upcoming sea­son. While he was able to pin­point a few negatives from the tournament such as Notre Dame's decision-making and bogies throughout the round, Kubinski feels all the Irish need is just to get the rust from the long winter ofl'. 
"I think we just need to get a few tournaments under our belt," Kubinski said. "By the time the Big East Championships roll around, we'll be feeling a lot bet­ter about how we're playing."

"It was a test of faith," Baldwin said. "When facing adversity, I said. "He passed away over Christmas and this would have been his birthday."

Duffy honored for academic success 
Senior point guard earned 3.821 Grade Point Average in fall 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Writer 
Notre Dame senior point guard Megan Duffy earned first-team Academic All­American honors Tuesday when f~SPN The Magazine announced this season's hon­orees. 
"I couldn't have asked for a better situation both academi­cally and athletically," Duffy said Monday before learning of the award. ''I'm going to get my degree from here ... and the overall atmosphere of this uni­versity is something I'll never forget." 
Duffy, a psychology and com­puter applications major in the College of Arts and Letters, earned a 3.821 grade-point average in the fall semester and a 3. 917 last spring. She has a cumulative 3.555 GPA. 
She is only the second player in team history to garner first­team honors. Former Irish cap­tain Ruth Riley earned the dis­tinction twice -in 2000 and 2001. 
Duffy qualified for the award when she earned Academic All­District V status for the second straight year earlier this sea­son. She is also a finalist for the Nancy Lieberman Award, given annually to the nation's top point guard. 
The preseason consensus All­American said she would likely to reflect on her accolades more after Notre Dame finishes . its season. 
"I feel like I'm going to savor it more after the season's over," she said. "I think when it's all over I'll be able to enjoy and look back at my experience a little more than I am right now." 
The other first-team honorees were Indiana State guard Melanie Boeglin, Kent State for­ward Lindsay Shearer, Michigan State forward Liz Shemik and Tennessee guard Shanna Zolman. 
Two other Notre Dame ath­letes have earned first-team Academic All-America status this school year. 'Irish women's soccer goalie Erika Bohn and midfielder Annie Schefter earned the distinction Nov. 24.

Dame's NCAA Tournament prospects and ensured the Irish of the No. 10 seed in this weekend's Big East Tournament in llariford, Conn. Notre Dame's first game of the tournament will 
be Saturday at 6 p.m. against South Florida in the Hartford Civic Center. 
"This team has a lot of p r i d e , " McGraw said. "To get back to .500 was really impor­tant for us for our NCAA Tournament hopes." 
The Irish used a 1 7-5 run in the first eight minutes of the second half Tuesday to turn a 41-31 deficit at the break into 48-46 lead. Allen capped the run with 12:21 left in the game when she hit a 15-foot jumper from the left side after she grabbed one of Notre Dame's eight second­half offensive rebounds. 
Senior Megan Duffy sparked the high intensity second half for Notre Dame when the 5-foot-7 point guard made a hard foul on Panthers 6-foot~3 space-eat­ing center Marcedes Walker -and both players fell to the floor. 
".I just tried to make a play on the ball," Duffy said. "I just wanted to not get crunched afterwards." 
Walker, who had eight inch­es on Duffy, had to come out of the game because of blood on her arm, and the Irish played motivated ball from that point forward. 
Walker tied her season high with 12 points and 18 rebounds in the game, but said Irish senior forward Courtney LaVere and Notre Dame's help defense improved dramatically in the second half. 
"I compliment their whole team for playing great defense and coming out aggressive," Walker said. 


"This team has a lot of pride. To get back to .sao was really important for us for our 
NCAA Tournament hopes." 
Muffet McGraw Irish head coach 
"It was 
there. People were definitely playing for something," she said. "In the second half, the 
crowd got into it and all of a sudden, it looked like our crew got ·shell­shocked." 
A f t e r Allen's. shot gave the Irish the 48­46 lead, the two teams battled back and forth "And as a team, we did­n't match their aggres­siveness in the second hall'."

was the sec­ond largest in Notre Dame history. The largest come­back for a vic­tory in team history is Notre Dame's win over Connecticut in the 2001 Final Four when the Irish came back from a 47-31 halftime 
for the next eight minutes. With Notre Dame clinging to a two-point lead, senior Courtney LaVere converted a layup in transition on a pass from Duffy to put the Irish up 63-59. 
The assist was one of six on the night for Duffy, who also had 11 points and four

rebounds. Sophomore guard Tulyah Gaines led Notre Dame's 21-assist perform­ance with eight dishes of her own. 
LaVere had success on the defensive end to go along with her offense. She finished the night with 14 points, five rebounds and five blocks. She held Walker to 2-of-12 shoot­ing in 31 minutes of physical play before fouling out with 
1:29 remaining in her final game in the Joyce Center. 
"She's so big in the lane ­she takes up so much space -I thought we did a decent job," LaVere said of the Irish defense on Walker. "I thought we did a good job at getting more bodies there and mak­ing it hard to shoot.". 
Pittsburgh's biggest lead of the night came with 2:26 left in the first when guard Maddy Brown hit a 3-pointer off the glass from the left side to put the Panthers ahead 38­23.

Notre Dame needs a win to keep Big East Tourney hopes alive 
By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 
.Facing elimination from the Big East tournament and an empty schedule in March, Notre Dame must win the first of its final two regular 
season games where it has been least successful -on the road. 
The Irish {13-2, 4-10 in the Big East) are 1-6 in confer­ence away games this season. They close their road sched­ule tonight in a 7:30 p.m. tipoff with Providence at the Dunkin Donuts Center in Providence, R.I. 
"I think we've played well on the road. We've compet­ed," Notre Dame coach Mike Brey said Monday, referring to his team's resilience but poor results away from the Joyce Center. "We played well against [Providence] before, and we've played well in the Dunkin Donuts Center histori­cally. No one in· [our] locker room has lost in that build­ing." 

Notre Dame has won three straight at the Dunkin Donuts Center, most recently winning 62-61 on Feb. 19, 2005.
