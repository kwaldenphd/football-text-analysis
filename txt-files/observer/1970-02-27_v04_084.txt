Universities becoming

With the rise the last few years in American universities of cultural and community self-consciousness, there has been a simultaneous sense of schiz­
ophrenia. Splits between ideals and realities, between orientation and res­ponsibilities, between students and ad­ministrations and sources of income, have tended to polarize, often super­ficially, all those involved in the uni­versity. The students of Columbia, for instance, having recognized the univer­sity's responsibilities to the communi­ty in which it lives and functions, successfully articulated the necessity for a reevaluation of the university's function, and hence structure. The price for such a second sight. however, was·-the danger from defenSive baci<-=­Jash from those who felt threatened. Berkeley's moments of glorious Un­revolution have been Juore than amply paid for by the new anti-intellectual­

ism  of  Ronald  Reagan,  California's  
Regents,  and  Spiro (the  Vice  Presi­ 
dent) Agnew.  

The result of such tensions has been that administrators have naturally found themselves racked between de­mands on one hand from frustrated students and faculty and on the other from alumni and other potential sour­ces of income. ("It makes me sick . .J am terribly disappointed with Fr. Hes­burgh ... " N.D. Alumnus, Jan.-Feb., I 970) Whether or not this schizophre­nia and tight-rope walking on the part of administrators is a well-deserved 

schizoid 
result of their own indecision or inept­itude is a moot point. The fact is that universities are split between their external functions and their intern"al necessities, and it is now the task of ·administrations to try to reconcile both functions without compromising either view. As an American university and legendary center for free thought, Notre Dame does have responsibilities to South Bend, to Clay towrtship, to the 30-some committees on which Fr. Hesburgh serves, to the government (dissent as patriotism); and most im­portant, to her students. In order to exist and to meet those. responsibilir

nationalistic ties of the mission­aries. He said that a friend once · cynically suggested that the mis­sionaries were used to "soften­up" the natives before the inva­sion of foreign troops. 
HORIZONTAL CHRISTIANITY ____"Only recently," asserted Peil, "has the-Church worked to 'd(JVe,: lop a native clergy." The pastor suggested that to­day the Christian must have an 
idea of "horizontal and vertical Christianity." Instead of viewing one's relationship with God as a straight line, Peil referred to view the relationship as a tri­angle, with the interaction bet­ween men as the base. 
"The ordinary way to get to God is out through other peo­ple," said the speaker. 
In suggesting future action for the Church, Fr. Peil emphasized the need for "attitudinal change," and the importance of Church involvement in the af­

fairs of the communities in 
which they exist. 
Fr. Peil asked those who were 
working for reforms to stay 
within the Church "to help 
make the Church become what 
you criticize it for not being." 
HYPOCRISY AND RACISM 

He urged his audience to see the hypocrisy and racism that exists in the established struc­tures today and to condemn all 

forms of violence, "violence against the spirit as well as pro­

presented the Vice-President's Council position. According to 
Frick, the University is already in the process of implementing eight of eleven Vice-President's Council proposals, and would act on the other three at a meeting to be held on March 3. Among the proposals acted upon were, "the increase of pay for campus police, recruitment of discharged Shore Patrol and military police as campus police, with a view towards them con­tinuing their education here, and the soliciting of the . editorial support of the Observer, the Scholastic, and WSND in a drive to upgrade the status of campus

At this point, the discussion turned towards hall security. Frick announced that the univer­sity was studying the imple­mentation of a $180,000 Honey­well system to safeguard the students against fires in all

school, he was willing to give it a try. 
"I may not always agree with some of Father Hesburgh's ideas," Mn. Olivarez said, "but I would defend him with cape and dagger." It was a brave move for him, she said, to invite her to the Notre Dame Law School. Ken­neth Galbraith, she said, asked why she was going to Notre Dame to study law." You're not built like a fullback," he said. But he never invited her to Harvard. 
But then Mrs. Olivarez was reluctant to accept Hesburgh's offer. From January to June 1967 she continued to think about the offer as she commuted between Phoenix and Los Angeles serving as a special con­sultant to O.E.O., the Labor Department, and the H.E.W.

King statement change
-
As a result of a meeting Wednesday night, James King, president of the Graduate Stu­dent Union, announced certain changes and clarifications of the information on graduate housing which had previously been re­leased. 
In this meeting with adminis­tration representatives Fathers William Botzum, Charles McCarragher, James Riehle, and Jerome Wilson and Carroll Hall Rector Fr. Rev. William Hund, King learned that the proposal to open a parking lot at Carroll opening to U.S. 31 would be opposed by the County Commis­sioners. 
This board controls matters of traffic and entrances to the high­way and would object to an intersection there without the protection of a traffic light. There is also a barrier which 
would prevent a southbound turn by anyone leaving the pro:' perty. 
King however plans to join with a committee to negotiate these points with the county authorities. 
APPLICATIONS ARE NOW BEING TAKEN FOR THE 
POSITION OF EDITOR OF THE OBSERVER 
THE POSITION IS OPEN TO ANY STUDENT 
OF NOTRE DAME OR ST. MARY'S 
APPLICATION MAY BE MADE BY SUBMITTING A STATEMENT OF INTENT TO 
THE BOARD~F DIRECTORS 
c/o·Gaetano M. De Sapio, Editor-in-Chief 
THE OBSERVER Box 11 
Notre Dame, Indiana 46556 
The statement should contain a resume ofqualifications as well as a statement of the applicant's concepts of the role and direction of THE OBSERVER. 
Applications must be filed by March 4. The applicant will be required to meet with the Board for a personal interview. 
Announcement of appointment and acceptance will be made on Friday, March 13. THE OBSERVER'S last publication date under the present editor will be Wed­nesday, March 25. Publication of THE OBSERVER will resume under the new editor on April 7. 
With regard to the actual ac­comodations of Carroll Hall as a dormitory for graduates, the ac­tual number of rooms available was found to be forty doubles and ten singles. Thus only ninety will be able to be accomodated. 
According to King, the ad­ministration representatives also pointed out that the former kitchen will not be reconverted into a kitchen for the grads. Thus they will be without the kitchen facilities for which they had planned. 
Today is the final day for graduate students to indicate their interest in on--campus hous­ing for the coming year. The committee studying this stresses that they hope to open the hall to all gmduate students includng law 'students although these lat­ter do not technically come under the Graduate School. 
The university's committment of a graduate dorm is contingent on the G.S.U. being able to produce at least ninety people who would like to live in these accomodations.

active on the campus. There is a solidarity and autonomy here in Carroll Hall which exemplifies the concepts of hall autonomy that the university preaches. It's like a family here. We're far away from things and most of us are here to study so we like the quiet." 
Greg Betz concluded "The 
only vandalism we have here is 
the grafitti on the bathroom 
walls. We can go on campus 
when we want or we can come 
here for quiet. We have our own 
gym, football, and baseball 
fields. The South quad interhall

Observer-SG 
Poll to try again 
Due to printing difficulties, the Observer-Student Govern­ment poll was not ready for distribution yesterday. The poll has been printed however and will be in the halls and at the off campus office during the lunch and dinner hours. 
The poll is extremely exten­sive and touches upon most of the major issues that concern students. The results of the poll will be tabulated as soon as possible, and will be announced in the Observer.

A two -bit pitcher 

The thing about Dennis Dale McLain, the former star of the Detriot Tigers, is that he was a two-bit pitcher. Well, he might even have been a six-bit pitcher, but that, of course, depended on the opposition. This put McLain up in some pretty good company. Not exactly Sandy Koufax, to be sure. Koufax was a 90-cent pitcher. 
There never has been a dollar pitcher. And, before you get the idea I'm putting down Denny McLain, you should know that Willie Mays was only a dime ballplayer in his best days-and that Henry Aaron is the only other dime ballplayer around. Mickey Mantle was a nickel ball.(llayer. . . 
All this small change has to do with why the comm1sswner of all baseball had to unfrock Denny McLain the other day. My friend, Jimmy (The Greek) Snyder, who will make you a price on the end of the world, patiently explained it all to me. 
Jimmy the Greek is the guy who makes the Baltimore Colts 17 points over the New York Jets. Jimmy doesn't book. The govern­ment ran him out of that pastime by taking 1 0-cents off the top of every buck and telling him he had to do with carrier pigeons who stayed in the state line. So Jimmy makes a line for newspaper men which is kind of like Keats and Shelley doing cigaret jingles, but oddsmakers have more respect for government than college kids­-and if I were a college kid I'd give THAT a lot of thought because that would indicate to me the government was an out price against anybody who didn't have his own army, and maybe against somebody who did. 
Jimmy explains that betting in baseball is on the pitcher. "You make a be t, you designate the pitcher. You say, 'I take the Dodgers if Drysdale goes.' With Drysdale, you had to lay 60 or 6S-cents. That meant you had to bet $1.60 against $1.00 on an otherwise even game. Only, bookies don't mess with bets under $100 usually. So, when we say '60-cents,' we're talking about $60 -minimum. When we say a guy bets 'SO dollars' we mean $S,OOO." 
This is not to be construed as a betting manual. The point to be made from all this is that the news that a pitcher even KNEW a bookmaker could send baseball's pulse soaring. The suggestion that Denny McLain was in partners with one could cause it to faint dead away. The last ballplayers to go in partners with a bookmaker were the 191 9 Chicago White Sox. Arnold Rothstein, who died from an overdose of bullets I 0 years later, cut them in on a parlay he was running on the '19 World Series. 
You can see where, if the gam biers figure the other ballplayers, even the sure Hall of Famers, can contribute no more than a nickel's worth to the price where a pitcher may double the punters' ante, a pitcher would be a nice guy to have in your pocket. It's like having a horse who can talk. 
What puzzles Jimmy The Greek in the McLain case is that, usually, by the times authorities act, it's an old story to the books. Chances are, they have closed the books on the guy in question years 
ago. But Jimmy The Greek heard nothing worse about Denny McLain than that he was an even-money organ player. A guy who wins 31 games would seem to be of little use to a handbook. Now, guy who could LOST 31 games ... ! Denny hasn't told his side of the story yet-although teammates point out Denny hasn't kept this silent this long since he had his tonsils out. Looking at Denny's books, he looks like an easier hit than a country bank. Either the guys were past-posting him, or his clockers were on Daylight Saving Time. Anyway, the guys down on the corner were pretty sure Denny wasn't booking. You got to get a federal license to deal that game. And, while you might figure you could handle baseball's action, you

May, but this year's edition of the Flyers is a well-balanced contingent. 
Dan's younger brother Ken leads Dayton with a 16.6 scoring average from his forward posi­tion. George Janky is right be­hind May at 16.3 and George Jackson stands at I 2.S. Four other Flyers carry averages of better than six points: forward Tom Crosswhite (8.S), guard Jim Gottschall (8.0), guard Pat Murneri (8 .0) and guard AI Bertke (6.2). 
Coach Johnny Dee has ac­cepted Catlett's explanation for his absence during the Butler 

game, and his addition pushes the Irish roster back to eight. Mike O'Connell is still in doubt­ful shape with his injured ankle. Although ND, and particularly Collis Jones, responded superbly to the small roster problem at Butler, it will be nice to have Big Sid back in the line-up, especial­ly the way he has been playing lately. 
Austin Carr has now scored SO points or more in three of his last four outings and owns 36.7 average with a .SS8 shooting percentage. Jones' 40-point spree last Monday raised his average to 17 .8. This twosome has also been devasting on th~ boards in recent games. 
Team shooting has continued to flirt with the 50% mark and now it stands at .484, far above the record of mark of .453. Only Jim Hinga has a percentage of less than 40%. 
Undoubtedly, the Irish will be tempted to let up against Day­ton tomorrow, but they are at the peak of their form. Since the Michigan State debacle and the return to form of Catlett, ND has been a powerful ball club. A win against Dayton would mean a 21-5 regular season log, and the best win-lost percentage since the 19S7-S8 squad went 22-4 during regular season play.

NEW YORK (UPI)-Pete 
Maravich can make or break the 
33rd National Invitation Tour­
nament. 
The floopy haired sharp­
shooter from Louisiana State 
University, the leading scorer in 
college basketball history, is the 
only "name" player guaranteed 
to sell tickets and television ex­
posure for the NIT this year. 
The NIT Selection Committee Wednesday named four of the 16 teams-LSU, St. John's, Mar­-quette and Georgia Tech-for 
this year's tournament, but LSU 
and Maravich are the main at­
traction. 
The tourney opens on March 
13, but LS U is sure to be saved 
for a national television contest 
on Saturday aftem.oon in its 
opening game. If Maravich could 
propel the Tigers 17-8 to the 
semifinals or finals, the NIT will 
be guaranteed a lot of excite­
ment. Without him, the NIT 
could lose a lot of luster since 
tenth ranked Marquette (19-3) is 
the only team in the top ten 
likely to be in the NIT this 
season. 
While Maravich may be good 
for the NIT, it's also true the 
NIT could be good for Maravich. 
The S U senior has never had a 
chance to show case is talents in 
New York with all the resulting 
exposure to the national media. 
One or two 60 poir~t, record breaking performances at Madison Square Garden might boost his price in the bidding war between the NBA and the ABA. 
"I've always dreamed of play­ing in Madison Square Garden," Maravich said, "the people in New York really appreciate bas­ketball and I think we can really put a show on for them." 
Marquette was an automatic NIT choice because it rejected an NCAA bid on Tuesday. Mar­quette was disturbed because it was asked to switch from the Mideast to the Midwest Regional in the NCAA. Marquette, a loser in the NIT finals in 1967 to Southern Illinois, could be the NIT favorite. 

St. John's will be trying to give Lou Carnesecca the same kind of farewell lit gave Joe Lapchick in 1965. The Red men won the tourney in Lap chick's last game before retiring. This will be Carnesecca 's farewell to St. John's before he joins the New York Nets. St. John's has appeared in the NIT 18 times and has won it four times. Both marks are records. 
Georgia Tech will be playing in the NIT for the first time and made itsouw other post season basketball appearance in 1960 when it played in the NCAA.

Pitcher Bob Humphreys, whose 20-10 eyesight is the best on the Washington Senators' squad, said he tries harder be·· cause Manager Ted Williams calls the pitchers "dum'dumb and non-athletes." 
On other fronts: First base­man Lee May, who hit 38 hom­ers last season, signed with the Cincinatti Reds for $42,000. 
Don Mincher and Frank Fernandez signed with the Oak­land Athletics but Reggie Jackson, a 4 7 homer hitter in 1969, and the club remained far apart. 
Richie Allen, Lou Brock and Steve Carlton all key players, were missing from the St. Louis Cardinals' workout. 

Tomasoni to be tested in 2-game set 
Irish goalie Dick Tomasoni will be in for a rough weeken~ as Colo­rado College comes into the Convo for a weekend set. CC IS a mem­ber of the Western College Hockey Association, to which ND has ap­plied for membership. The Tigers and Irish split 5-4 g~mes Olll Jan. 31 and Feb. 2. CC is led by Bob Collyard, an All-Amencan last year. It should be a series of high quality hockey. Tickets are on sale b~·· fore the games.
