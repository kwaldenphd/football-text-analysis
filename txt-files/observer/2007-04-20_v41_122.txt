Counseling Center offers services 
By EMMA DRISCOLL 
News Writer 
As more information seeps out about the mental state of Cho Seung-Hui, who shot and killed 32 people at Virginia Tech Monday before turning his gun on himself, university counseling services have become a nation­wide issue. 
In news conferences Thursday, VIrginia Tech officials said Cho did not receive any treatment from the school's counseling center, and the court did not tell the institution when Cho was released from outpa­tient treatment at a local clinic. 
Nonetheless, more and more

LGBTQ activists take new approach 
By EVA BINDA News Writer 
A Holocaust Memorial lined the east part of South Quad Tuesday as part of Stand Against Hate Week, organized by different campus groups and departments to send the message that "we here at Notre Dame do not di<>criminate or tolerate hate, specifically toward our lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or ques­tioning students." 
The display was just one indication of altering tactics used by those cam­paigning for rights and respect for LGBTQ students. 
Despite high visibility enjoyed by the "Gay? Fine By Me" campaign, the week's student organizers decided to take a different approach. 
"People are almost getting bored 
with this push for equality and acceptance for gay students," said ·senior co-organizer Casey Scott. "There's a whole lot more to be asked for. There isn't any way, shape or . form.full acceptance. I don't think this issue is going to go away for a while nor should it." 
In addition to the memorial and the distribution of T-shirts for the Stand Against Hate campaign, a Day of Silence was organized Wednesday. Participating students took a daylong vow of silence to represent the silence of LGBTQ students and their rights. 
Scott said she considers the week a success especially for its first time on campus.

Sorinsends students to Uganda 
Men's dorm raises funds for St. Jude 
By JOHN PAUL WITT News 'Writer 
Notre Dame students may have heard about the prob­lems facing Uganda through classes, academic forums and campus events this year, but it's likely few realize that Sorin College has been sending stu­dents and money to the East African country for almost four years now. 
Since the summer of 2003, Sorin has worked with the Center for Social Concerns and the Indiana Province of the Congregation of Holy Cross to send one student each sum­mer for an eight-week place­ment at St. Jude Primary School, a Catholic grade school in Buwekula, Uganda. 
. Last summer, junior Patrick Reidy was chosen to work at St. Jude and had an experi­ence he said has "stolen a piece of his heart." 
It's not every day that stu­dents are willing to work in a country famous for its long­standing civil conflict, though Reidy admits that his reasons for going were "selfish." 
"I never needed anything growing up, and I wanted to see if I could be the good per­son I hope I am when things aren't as easy, when things are really difficult," he said. "It wasn't a very Africa-oriented reason."

Rob Finch, who graduated from the University in 1998, is part of a team of journalists at The Oregonian newspaper in Portland, Ore., awarded the Pulitzer Prize Monday for their coverage of the disappearance of James Kim and his family in southern Oregon's Siskiyou mountains last December. 
Finch, part of the New Media department at The Oregonian, used Google Earth technology to develop maps of the path Kim took through the mountains, using an innovative "three-dimensional" approach to enable readers to bet­ter understand what occurred.

If you see in Messi the rebirth of Maradona, we might be on the same page and you may appreciate my reflections on the greatest team in the history of soccer. 
Is it wrong to fmd a group of soccer players covered in sweat, jumping on each other and kissing as they cele­brate a goal, absolutely adorable? Is this the equivalent of men's fascina­tion with lesbians? I don't know. I do know that Ronaldinho alone is won­derful. Messi alone is wonderful too. Put Ronaldinho and Messi together, however, and the wonderfulness explodes. 
Why won't coach Rijkaard let Saviola play more? I can understand Saviola's mammoth paycheck could create rivalries within the team­but benching him can't be the solu­tion. My heart weeps when I see his youth and skill squandered. Rijkaard, you're killing a mockingbird! 
While we're on Rijkaard's question­able coaching decisions, let's talk about his defense. Coach, off the top of my head, I can name a dozen other goalkeepers to fill Valdes' clown shoes. Give me someone along the lines of Real Madrid's Casillas, and Valdes can be a fantastic understudy. 
If Rijkaard wants to keep Puyol on the field, he needs to offset the cap­tain's retirement age with an impene­trable defense. What does he do instead? He calls Marquez, Mexico's Aztec Kaiser. Mexico, that's laugh­able. 
Marquez is the foil to Ronaldinho's clean game. He's incompetent too, allowing the other teams to come near Valdes when "leave it to Valdes" is the shortest way to defeat, fol­lowed closely by "leave it to Marquez." 
Is it sad that I only wake up every morning because I know it brings me one day closer to the next Real Madrid-Barcelona game? No, it's not sad because Barcelona is "mes que un club."

FROM THE EDITOR 
The picture accompanying the front­page Student Senate story in the April 19 edition of The Observer was an inappro­priate choice, given the article's subject matter. 
The photo, which showed student body president liz Brown and vice president Maris Braun laughing, was not taken during the Senate's discussion on how to respond to the shootings at Virginia Tech -although the headline may have implied that. Rather, it was taken at a different point in the group's meeting. 
The photo was poorly chosen during The Observer's production process, its placement was misleading, and we regret any confusion it caused.

SMC hosts annual dance n1arathon for hospital 
By LIZ HARTER 
News Writer 
With their comfortable shoes in tow, students will crowd into Saint Mary's Angela Athletic Facility tonight to raise money for Riley Hospital for Children in the College's second annu­al dance marathon. 
Close to 270 Saint Mary's, ·Notre Dame and Holy Cross students have already registered to participate in the marathon, which begins at 6 p.m. and runs until 6 a.m. Saturday, Dance Marathon co-presidents Francesca Johnson and Pauline Kistka said. 
"There are a lot of critically ill chil­dren in South Bend that go to Riley's," Johnson said. "We wanted to bring something here to benefit the Hospi~.al, and make it a tri-campus event. 
Last year, Saint Mary's raised $21,047.42 during its first ever marathon. 
"It was more than double any col­lege for the first year of a marathon," fundraising chair Sarah Voss said. 
Not only did the marathon raise the most money for a new dance marathon in Indiana, but it was also recognized last July at the Children's Miracle Network Dance Marathon Leadership Conference 2006 as the Best New Dance·Marathon. 
Organizers have held multiple fundraisers throughout the course of the school year to benefit the marathon, including selling sweat­shirts and holding a Battle of the Bands in December. 
The main fundraising initiative, however, is a letter-writing campaign. Each registered dancer provides addresses of family and friends back home to which organizers sent letters asking for donations to the hospital. The amount raised will be revealed at the end of the event Saturday morn­ing 
"We chose for it to be a surprise," Voss said. 
The organizers aim to beat their goal and raise as much money as they can for the hospital, Johnson said. 
Participants, who paid $12 to enter, are not allowed to sit down, Johnson said, and must remain on the premise the entire 12 hours. 
Entertainment will include perform­ances by The Undertones, the Notre Dame Swing Club, Troop ND, Katius, Becca Schiappa and Harper's Valley. There will also be a Morale Dance that will be taught to participants in stages throughout the night, and the event will culminate in completing the dance. 
More than 50 families personally involved in Riley Hospital will be attending the event and telling their stories throughout the night. 
Registration starts at 5 p.m. and anyone can register at the door. 
"We hope to have at least 300 dancers," Johnson said. "Our slogan is, 'We dance because we can. We stand for those who can't."'

Freshman Jackie Mirandola Mullen, who hails from the same town in Georgia as former running back Darius Walker, shares Ostrowski's enthusiasm. Since this is her first Blue­Gold game, she is excited to see all of the new players after the departure of Walker and last season's seniors. 
"I think that [running back] James Aldridge will do well next year. I am also excited to see [cornerback] Munir Prince as well as the new quarterbacks," she said. 
The Notre Dame ticket office expects a record high of ticket sales for this year's game. 
Ticket prices are $12 and $10 for adults and children, respectively, if bought in advance. On game day, the prices go up to $15 for adults and $10 for children. Notre Dame and Saint Mary's stu­dents are admitted for free with a valid ID and are to enter through Gate E. The game begins at 1:30 p.m. 
Holtz, head coach at Notre Dame from 1986 until 1996, will be the honorary head coach for the Gold team. Ara Parseghian, head coach from 1964 until 197 4, will be the honorary head coach for the Blue team. He was recently inducted into the AT&T Cotton Bowl Hall of Fame.

accounts from classmates ofthe dis­turbed student and the intense cov­erage of the incident have reinforced the crucial role counseling facilities play for many college students. 
At Notre Dame, the University Counseling Center (UCC) has a wide variety of options for students who "face any problem or concern that may require professional assis­tance," according to the UCC's brochure. 
In the 2005-06 school year, the vee saw approximately 950 stu­dents for individual counseling, said Susan Steibe-Pasalich, the vee director and assistant professor in the psychology department. Of those students, 14 percent were fresh­men, 21 percent sophomores, 19 percent juniors, 21 percent seniors and 21 percent graduate students, Steibe-Pasalich said. Three percent did not report their academic year. 
The UCC has 12 psychologists, eight employees under supervision who either are working toward or have received a Master's degree, one consulting psychiatrist and one consulting nutritionist. 
"We do think we have very quali­fied people here. We have licensed psychologists who are experts in col­lege student development," Steibe­Pasalich said. 
Although data on whether stu­dents visited these staff members as a result of the Virginia Tech shoot­ings is not available, the vee has added a links to its Web site for stu­dents, faculty and staff to give tips for managing distress in the after­math of the shootings. 
In University President Father John Jenkins' e-mail to students Thursday, he encouraged students, faculty and staff members with a need to discuss the shootings to con­tact the vee. 
Reasons for visits 
While Notre Dame students may visit the vee for a variety of reasons, 4 7 percent ofstudents seen last year reported depression, according to Steibe-Pasalich. Twenty-seven per­cent of students reported anxiety. 
"They really are our top two issues," she said. 
The vee asks counselors to report what issues they "work on" with students. Steibe-Pasalich said that 53 percent reported that they worked with students to deal with "interpersonal concerns," which could include relationships with family members, peers, classmates, roommates, or boyfriend<; and girl­friends. 
"I think it's really just not feeling good -feeling down, feeling depressed, feeling anxious -that brings students in, and the reasons for that could be all over the board," she said. 
Last year, 19 percent of students who visited the vee reported aca­demic adjustment as an issue. 
While Notre Dame strives to maintain a Catholic identity, some­thing the vee must take into account, Steibe-Pasalich said stu­dent<; are not counseled in a particu­lar religious direction. 
"We certainly are sensitive to a Catholic student body in that they are unique and it behooves us to pay attention to how that uniqueness manifests itself," she said. 
And with some students not used to the grey skies of a South Bend winter, seasonal affective disorder seems to impact "students who come from warm and sunny cli­mates," Steibe-Pasalich said. The vee. which sees slightly more females than males, has a light box to help with this in its Inner Resources Room. 


Rules ax! regulations 
Whether for faculty, undergradu­ate students or graduate student<;, the vee upholds the same confiden­tiality policy. 
"Legally, because we are staffed by licensed psychologist'>, we do, by law, have to maintain students' con­fidentiality," she said. "Exceptions to that are if a student is suicidal or homicidal. We might need to alert somebody to that fad in order that the student and others are kept safe." 
The Virginia Tech slayings have caused many to a<;k whether or not university counseling c~nters have the authority to force students to seek counseling. 
At Notre Dame's UCC, it is not pos­sible to make a student go to coun­seling, Steibe-Pasalich said. DuLac, however, does give faculty or Hall Staff permission to mandate an assessment. 
"A rector may say [to a student] 'I want you to present yourself to a counselor for psychological assess­ment in order for you to !>iay in thn hall," she said. 
When an assessment is mandat­ed, Steibe-Pasalich said, the UCC can make recommendations for that student, and the student will usually have the vee let his or her rector know that the student visited. 
However, if an assessment indi­cates that a student may be in or cause harm, the vee has the authority to hospitalize the student. 
Ultimately, students who want to want to make psychological changes must want to receive help. 
"The student has to want help, to be motivated," Steibe-Pa'ialich said. 
Off-site referrals from the UCC are not too common and are handled carefully. 
"We don't refer out many stu­dents," Steibe-Pasalich said. "We are careful when we refer out. We docu­ment that. We usually see the stu­dent untillhe or she] has connected with someone else, unless if medica­tion is the only issue." 
Reasons a student may be referred off site inelude the need lor medication, if a student is in so much distrflss he needs more than once-a-week counseling or if a stu­dent wishes to receive long term counseling with the same counselor, which can conflict with the UCC's brief therapy model. 
"We would like to see a student decrease their need for counseling," Steibc-Pasalich said, adding that the vee has an ethical obligation to refer students who do not seem to be "getting better" elsewhere. The vee may also suggest that !>tudents who do not comply with treatment recommendations seek help else­where. 

The beginning of help 
The recently renovated UCC ­located on the third floor of Saint Liam Hall -includes group and individual counseling rooms, a con­ference room and a library. The Inner Resource Room, which was the gift of the Oass of 2004, includes a massage ehair, biofeedback tech­nology and software games to help control breathing and increase relaxation. White noise machines in the halls keep counseling private and confidential. There are also rooms in which students can fill out intake paperwork. 
This intake paperwork -filled out on a student's frrst visit to the vee -helps see what a student<; issue is, Steibe-Pasalich said. It al'io helps the vee gather statistics and demographics to "determine who we're not meeting enough with" and to help the vee tailor services to specific groups of students when necessary. 
Once a student has completed intake fonns, the UCC's Disposition Team -a group of staff members that meets twice a week -discuss­es a student's case to determine whether the vee is the best place for the student to receive help, Steibe-Pasalich said. 
Along with regular scheduled counseling appointments, the vee offers options for students in emer­gency situations. 
"We have a walk-in emergency service. If a student or someone con­cerned for a student can't wait to come in !for a scheduled appoint­ment]," she said. "[We have] a 247 emergency call system. One of us is always available to help a student in di<;tress.... Our availability is para­mount, I think." 
Counselors are available by the call system to answer phone calls from students or anybody who may be concerned about a student. 
Students who are in distress themselves, have concerns about another distressed student, or are wondering what to do in the event that another student displays violent tendencies are encouraged to call 631-7336 between 9 a.m. and 5 
p.m. and request to speak with a "warm line" counselor. 
Along with individual and emer­gency counseling services, the vee offers group counseling and out­reach programs. vee groups deal with issues such as obsessive-com­pulsive disorder, depression, stress, alcohol, food and body image, per­sonal growth and relaxation. There is also a group for graduate stu­dents. 
In addition to helping students, the counseling center also advises facul­ty and staffon dealing with students. 
"We're also consultants to faculty and staff who need advice on han­dling a distressed student," Steibe­Pasalich said.

Suicide bomb rips Baghdad 
BAGHDAD -A suicide bomber slipped past security barriers to kill 12 people Thursday, the latest in a wave of attacks that have shown the resilience of insurgents in the face of a U.S.-led crackdown on major violence in Iraq's capital. 
The attack in a mostly Shiite district showed yet again the ability of insurgents to penetrate Baghdad's heavy security presence, a day after more than 230 people died in the worst spasm of mass killings since President Bush announced his plan in January to increase American troop levels in Iraq by 30,000. 
Iraq's prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, said an "open battle" was being waged for control of his nation. 
Child soldiers rampant in Congo 
DAKAR, Senegal --Congo's new govern­ment has failed to stop the use of child sol­diers _ merging forces of former warlords into the regular army without weeding out hundreds of underage fighters, an interna­tional human rights group said Thursday. 
New York-based Human Rights Watch said 300 to 500 children, some as young as 13, are serving in newly combined army brigades in remote North Kivu province. The group said the figures came from local and international child protection workers. 
"The head of the army has given the order that child soldiers need to be demobilized and taken out of the ranks, but despite the order, nothing is happening," said Anneke Van Woudenberg, a London-based Congo researcher with Human Rights Watch.

Record vaccine doses to be produced 
ATLANTA--Flu vaccine manufacturers expect to have a record 132 million doses ready for the 2007-2008 flu season, and even more could be available if a fifth company joins their ranks, officials said Thursday. 
CSL Biotherapies, an Australian company, applied last month for federal approval to sell its flu vaccine in the United States this fall. 
Government health officials have been expand­ing their flu shot recommendations to cover more age groups, and they now say that more than 200 million Americans should get vaccinat­ed each year. But setbacks in recent years­including vaccine delays and shortages --have left doctors and patients soured and confused. 
Influenza kills an estimated 36,000 Americans each year, and hospitalizes another 200,000, according to the CDC. 

Preacher's wife convicted 
SELMER, Tenn. -A preacher's wife who claimed her husband abused her was convicted Thursday of voluntary manslaughter for shoot­ing him. 
Mary Wmkler, 33, showed no emotion as the verdict was read. Prosecutors had asked that Winkler be convict­ed of first-degree murder, but the jury settled on the lesser charge after deliberating for eight hours. She faces three to six years in prison. 
Winkler had told jurors that her husband, Matthew, abused her physically and sexually, but she said the shotgun went off accidentally as she pointed it at him. 
The prosecution said it was ludicrous to sug­gest the shooting was an accident.

The House and Senate versions of the proposal include many differences -including the amount of upfront fees required, the number of slot machines permitted and the taxing struc­tures. The versions would also use the state's share of the money for different uses.

Gates says Iraq's 'clock is ticking' 
Defense secretary tells leaders that American commitment isn't open-ended 
Associated Press 
FALLUJAH U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates landed in Baghdad on Thursday to deliver a sharp message to Iraqi political leaders: The U.S. military's commitment to the war is not open-ended. 
"The clock is ticking," Gates told reporters, saying he will warn Iraqi officials that they must move faster on political reconciliation. "I know it's difficult, and clear­ly the attack on the council of representatives has made people nervous, but I think that it's very important that they bend every effort to getting this legislation done as quickly as possible." 
A suicide bomber infiltrat­ed the parliament building in the heavily fortified Green Zone a week ago, delivering a major blow to the U.S.-led effort to pacify the capital's streets. 
Prime Minister Nouri al­Maliki called the violence in Baghdad an "open battle." 
Gates, traveling to Iraq for the third time in four months, took a decidedly stronger tone this time, reflecting U.S. frustration and the political tumult in Washington where President Bush and Congress are deadlocked over whether to set an end date for the war. 
The defense secretary stressed again, however, that the debate has been helpful in letting the Iraqis know that American patience with the war is ebbing. Democrats have seized on those remarks to bolster their arguments that there must be a deadline for the Pentagon to begin with­drawing troops from Iraq. 
The last time a U.S. defense secretary visited Fallujah -which until late 2004 was a key stronghold of the Sunni insurgency --it was Donald H. Rumsfeld, who stopped here in December 2005 to announce a plan to begin reducing U.S. troops. Small reduc­tions were made, but shortly afterward troop levels began climbing again. In February 2006 the spectacular bomb­ing of a mosque in Samarra, north of Baghdad, set off a wave of sectarian retribu­tion and a surge of civilian deaths that scuttled U.S. plans to pull out more troops. 
Meantime, Gates said the Iraqis must, as quickly as possible, push through legis­lation on political niconcilia­tion and the sharing of oil revenues among the Sunni, Shiites and Kurds. 
"It's not that these laws are going to change the situ­ation immediately, but I think ... the ability to get them done communicates a willingness to work togeth­er," he said. 


Those efforts, Gates said, would, in turn, create an environment in which vio­lence could be reduced. But he acknowledged, ''I'm sym­pathetic with some of the challenges that they face." 
Shortly after landing in Baghdad, Gates boarded a helicopter to Camp Fallujah, about 35 miles west of the capital city. There, he met with top military command­ers, including Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Peter Pace, and the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Army Gen. David Petraeus. 
There commanders agreed that the recent uptick in violence is trouble­some, occurring just as they were starting' to see some improvements. 

Gates' visit comes on the heels of Iraq's bloodiest day since the U.S. troop buildup ordered by Bush began nine weeks ago. On Wednesday, four bomb blasts killed 230 people. 
"Yesterday was a bad day, there's no two ways about it," said Petraeus. "And a day like that can have a real psychological impact, and it came at a time where frankly ... (we) felt like we were getting a bit of trac­

Petraeus added that while the changes are almost imperceptible at times, there had been slow progress both in Anbar and with the Baghdad security plan.

how unique it is, and the power it contains." 
This year's designer, sophomore Andrew Parnell, said he wanted to create a shirt that expressed exactly what Notre Dame football fans feel every fall. 
Lenoir thinks Parnell succeed­ed. 
'The Shirt is a unifying factor of Notre Dame fans," Lenoir said. "It brings everyone together: the. stu­dents, alumni, fans and the foot­ball team. It is something special that has become a part of the Notre Dame football tradition." 
Although the design started as a the committee, a great finished product resulted, Lenoir said. 

Parnell agreed. 
"When you see The Shirt, you think, 'Now that is what Notre Dame football is all about,"' Parnell said. 
Although specifics regarding the look of The Shirt could not be revealed earlier this week, Parnell said students "can expect a com­fortable fitting quality made shirt "

Many students are interested in seeing how this year's shirt will stack up against its predecessor, The Shirt 2006. Last year's record-breaking campaign sold more than 150,000 units. 
"Last year's shirt was a huge this year's shirt can meet the high expectations we have from last year." 
But Lenoir said the committee "didn't feel any added pressure this year." 
"The beauty of The Shirt pr~ject is that it is a fresh start every year. We understood that last year was successful, but this is this year," he said. 
Although the committee did not look to old shirts for design inspi­ration, it did use shirts from the past in its promotional campaign. Posters across campus feature students wearing past designs of The Shirt. 
"In our campaign, we wanted to show everyone how far The Shirt lection of past shirts, from the navy blue 2006 Tradition' shirt way back to the original kelly green 1990 shirt." 
At the unveiling, the eommittee hopes to have all of the past shirts on display to show how far the project has eome, Lenoir said. 
Also at the unveiling will be a Johnsonville brat truck with the world's largest grill, measuring 64 feet long. The grill will be supply­ing 2,000 free brats to those in attendance. There will also be inflatables and a bike give-a-way at the event. 
Scheduled to appear at the unveiling are Alumni Association President Chuek Lennon, the Glee Club, the marching band, the porn rechaun. 
Festivities kick off at 5 p.m., with the official unveiling starting an hour later. The committee moved this year's release to the evening to accommodate the schedules of the students and community, Lenoir said. 
The Shirt will again sell for $15, but today only, students present­ing their ID can purchase The Shirt at a discounted price of $11. 
Proceeds from The Shirt go to student organizations and are donated to charity. During its 18 years, the project has raised over $4 million.

the kids survived." 
Finch credited the entire staff of The Oregonian with the award and said it was "cool to be part of such a team effort." 
''I'm proud of the work we did and effort it took to do that," Finch said. "This wasn't an individual award-it was the entire newspa­per's award -because 100 people touched these stories in one way, shape or form." 
But the award is bittersweet, Fineh said, the story was so tragic. 
"You're celebrating something that wouldn't have been a story if this guy hadn't died," Finch said, "It's a hard thing to accept." 
Finch worked as a photographer for The Observer when he was an undergraduate and covered Notre Dame's football game against Navy in Ireland in 1996. He credited Notre Dame with providing him with "many opportunities" and inspiring him with a sense of "new­ness and creativity." 

The other three recent Notre Dame Pulitzer winners are also former Observer staffers. 1995 graduate and Saint Paul Pioneer Press reporter George Dorhmann won the 2000 beat reporting award for a series on academic fraud within the University of Minnesota's men's basketball pro­gram, and 1994 graduate David Kinney was a member of the Newark Star-Ledger's Pulitzer-win­ning staff in 2005. The stall' won for its coverage of the resignation of New Jersey governor James McGreevey after he admitted to appointing his extramarital male lover to a state security leadership post. 
Former Observer Editor in Chief Michelle Krupa was part of last year's Pulitzer-winning New Orleans Times Picayune staff, which received the award for its coverage of Hurricane Katrina. The Pulitzer Board awarded the 2006 breaking news reporting prize to the Times-Picayune stall' for its aggressive coverage of the di<>aster, and the papnr won a sec­ond Pulitzer for public service for its multi-facetnd covnrag!~ of the hwTieann and il'> aftermath. 
Krupa served as editor in ehief of The Observer during the 1999­2000 acadnmic year. 
At least two other Notrn Damn alumni have won individual Pulitzers, A<>sistant Vice Pmsident lor News and Information Dennis Brown told The Observer last spring. 1939 graduate Edwin O'Connor won lbr fiction ("The Last Hurrah") in 1962, and 1927 gradu­atn and sports columnist Hod Smith won in 1976.

For freshman Patrick Bears, remaining silent all day "was the hardest thing in my life." 
"I hope what I did will hnlp the awareness of LGBT issues that are facnd by people at this and other universities," he said. 
Scott said she felt the Holocaust Memorial display on South Quad was particularly suceessful and had "the most reach in terms of all the events we did." 
"Just even walking by the few times that I did. it seemed that people took notice of it. I think that had a big impact," she said. 

To make an even bigger splash next year, Scott said she hopes to see "more interactive events," like the Day of Silence, so more students can partieipate. 
"While I'm happy with the amount of people who did par­take in the Day of Silence, I would love to see many more people participate," said Scott, who hopes the day will bncome a "significant campus-wide event."

IN BRIEF 
Newspapers face rocky quarter 
CHICAGO -Media companies announced lackluster earnings during their latest quarter as declining revenue, profit and circulation fig­ures dealt the newspaper industry its latest fmancial blow. 
Gannett Co., Tribune Co., New York Times Co. and Media General Inc. all reported lower earn­ings Thursday, as classified advertising dwin­dled and overall online revenue growth began to slow, analysts said. 
At Chicago-based Tribune, interactive revenue grew 17 percent to $60 million. That segment grew 30 percent during the first quarter in 2006. 
"The big problem and the big red flag for newspaper companies is that the slowing in online revenue growth means that their ability to make up that print loss is eroding very quick­ly," said Ken Doctor, a media analyst for Outsell, Inc. 
Newspaper publishers have been struggling for years as readers turn to the Internet for their news and advertisers -particularly clas­sified advertisers -follow them. That trend has continued. During the latest quarter, classified revenue at Tribune and Media General fell 14 percent, while dipping nearly 12 percent at New York Times and 3 percent for Gannett. 
Michael Simonton, newspaper analyst at the credit ratings service Fitch Ratings Inc. said an 8 percent drop in print ad revenue at Gannett's flagship USA Today was a cause for concern. 
Wall street finishes on flat note 
NEW YORK -Wall Street closed essentially flat Thursday after struggling to resume a modest upward trend while investors juggled upbeat economic data, divergent earnings reports and a pullback in Chinese stocks. The Dow Jones industrials edged higher to a record close for the second straight day. 
While a mix of profit reports pushed and tugged at stocks Thursday, investors also watched markets abroad, where stocks fell following word that economic growth in China's first quarter jumped a higher-than­expected 11.1 percent and inflation increased at the fastest pace in more than two years. 



Google's first-quarter profit rises 
Company's three-month earnings increase 69 percent, exceeding analyst estimates 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO Google Inc.'s first-quarter profit rose 69 percent, main­taining the online search leader's penchant for obliter­ating analyst estimates. 
The stellar results released Thursday left little doubt that Google has widened its lead over its closest rival in Internet search and advertis­ing, Yahoo Inc., whose first­quarter earnings eroded. 
Google detailed its sparkling performance on the same day that several major U.S. newspaper com­panies announced another quarter of financial decay, underscoring an advertising shift that is enriching Internet upstarts at the expense of traditional media outlets struggling to adapt to a new order. 
Born less than decade ago, Google now reigns as the most profitable -and prob­ably most powerful -force on the Web. 
In the latest demonstration 
of its clout, Google earned $1

Wolfowitz fights to keep his position 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Fighting to keep his job, World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz is offering to make manage­ment changes at the institution, offi­cials close to the situation said Thursday. 
The overture -which came during a meeting of bank vice presidents on Wednesday -was made as Wolfowitz is facing mounting calls for his resig­nation. The controversy is over Wolfowitz's role in arranging a high­paying job for Shaha Riza, a bank employee who he has dated. 
The World Bank's 24-member board 
is expected to meet behind closed 
doors on Thursday to discuss the mat­
ter. It is not clear what action, if any, 
the board might take. Wolfowitz has 
said he made a mistake and has apol­ogized. 
At Wednesday's meeting, Wolfowitz stated anew that he did not intend to step down, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not permitted to speak on behalf of the bank. They said Wolfowitz spoke in general terms for the need to improve the bank's man­agement, including that of his inner office, and to soften his management style. He also invited recommenda­tions. 
The United States -the bank's largest shareholder-has been stand­ing by Wolfowitz. "As we've said before, the president has confidence in Paul Wolfowitz," White House spokes­woman Dana Perino said Thursday in a fresh statement of support. She also said it is appropriate to let the board's review process take place. 
Although they have not said so pub­licly, some European governments would like to see Wolfowitz go but do not want to provoke a fight with the United States over the issue. 
Under an informal agreement, the United States names the head of the World Bank and the Europeans chose the leader of its sister institution, the International Monetary Fund. The controversy over Wolfowitz could bring this informal arrangement into question ifhe resigns or is fired. 
Documents released last week showed that Wolfowitz had a direct hand in securing a State Department job for Riza in September 2005 that pays her $193,590. Before the trans­fer, Riza was earning close to $133,000 as a communications advis­er in the bank's Middle East depart­ment.

Security with transparency 
There are still plenty of questions surrounding what hap­pened Monday at Virginia Tech. 
But one thing that isn't up for discussion is that Notre Dame should have a plan in case the unthinkable happnns here.

It's understandable that Notre Dame would need time to work out certain details before making a plan public. Still, when information of this nature isn't being released, it's important to tell people why, instead of generating anxious

Well wishes for the Class of '007 
Rarely does a year's numerical arrangement offer a cute correlation to an icon like the parallel this year between the Class of '007 with the fic­tional international spy James Bond. But this week is not a cute one with the massacre at Virginia Tech. Neither is this a charming year with the carnage that defies under­standing of both young Americans and Iraqis in the Middle East. The feel of our time is remi­niscent of my second semester of fresh­man year when four students were murdered at Kent State. 
It may seem whimsically befitting that at this time of international strife and uncertainty, this year's seniors can be branded with the James Bond code name of "007." Yet it is evident that for the near future, the years ahead will be filled with learning experiences in hope of healing an unsettled world. Life at times is cruel, shocking and unforgiving. Ask the families of sons and daughters lost on the Virginia Tech campus. Ask the maimed servicemen and servicewomen who return from Iraq each day with the scars and nightmares of war. 
Within a month, the Notre Dame senior class will march onward to many person­al and individual victories. Graduates will disperse in every direction like the high­flying seeds of a mature dandelion scat­tering on a windy day. Their choices in life can be motivated by either fear or love. All of us must decide if we are moti­vated by fear so that we are reactive, or if we are motivated by love so that we reach out to others in a proactive way. Tragically, many of us never know that

we have a choice. 
Notre Dame teaches its graduates to know better, to be better and to act bntter -not in a sell'-rightP.ous way, but in serv­ice to others. The bonds of love felt at Virginia T0ch in light of this week's tragedy are the bonds Notre Dame slow­ly, subtly instills in its graduates through­out their four-year journey. Many times, though, graduates who believe in absolute certainties diminish their ability for tolerance, open-mindedness and acceptance. However, sometimes the greater forces of the universe change individuals through an abrupt tragedy or death. 
This column regularly recalls Notre Dame's so-called "angels," the great friends and teachers who change or mold a student's outlook. In my era, Frank O'Malley, Tom Stritch and Father Robert Griflin were among the iconic figures in our hearts. Most recently, former Notre Dame Security/Police Director Rex Hakow joined that heavenly group. Their thoughts, their deeds and their warmth were the formula that sprouted their wings, but more importantly, touched our hearts. 
The members of the Class of '007 can­not conform like puppets to a small seg­ment of our society-although they have sought acceptance within the campus community for nearly four years. Do not confine yourselves to your sense of belonging, to your sense of behavior, or to your sense of morality. If you do limit yoursp,Jves, you will strike out against those who are difl'erent rather than embrace and tolerate others in our world. 
In the family of nations, wisdom is the first cousin of freedom while freedom is the glory of our nation. Without wisdom we cannot be a beacon of light. We can­not be brave, gallant or kind. This nation once stood as the be aeon of truth because others yearned for our ideals. Heeently, we lost our moral authority with secret prisons, torture, indifference and duplicity. Our leaders replaced wis­dom with an ideology. 
Does anyone think the world can fmd answers when we have no dialogue? One thing is for sure, when the Class of '007 grasps the torch of leadership, our nation will be less bigoted and more inclusive. The world will know that this year's graduates have asked the questions and extended a hand. It may take a decade to solve today's current international mess, but it is possible to heal and unite the world. Just when we have walked through a valley thinking that the sun has gone down on us, we should remem­ber that it always comes up again. 
Wisdom sometimes comes from the most unlikely sources, and we must learn to open our eyes to everyone. Robert Stroud, the famous prisoner known as "the Birdman of Aleatraz," found a baby sparrow and raised it to maturity. Whenever he thought it was time for the bird to go out into the world on its own, he said, "You best go find out who you are. Kick up dust, dance to fiddle music, taste sweet whiskey and red-eyed gravy. Bite the stars for me." 
In the true tradition of Bond, James Bond, this writer has high hopes for the future of this year's graduates and wishes the Class of '007 many bites at the stars. The dust, fiddle music, whiskey and red­eyed gravy are at your discretfon.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
What I really think about NDLS 
This week has seen opinions from all over the spectrum of viewpoints about Notre Dame Law School. One of those opinions was found in this paper, and attributed to me. Many of the other opin­ions were in response to my quotes in The Observer. But, none of those view­points were entirely mine. The quotes were out of context and didn't do justice to what I really feel about the school. And as the responses referenced those same quotes, they didn't get my position correct either. So, I'd like to explain what was said, what should have been said, and what was omitted, to provide a full under­standing of my much discussed opinion of NDLS. 
First, regarding what was actually said, Ken Fowler called my cell phone this past Monday and requested an interview about the Law School's drop in rankings. · Of course I obliged Ken. I knew who he was since I was his TA for Father Bob Dowd's Religion and Politics course last spring. I figured we'd talk. Our conversa­tion lasted roughly 25 minutes, and I explained my views of the school. At one point, I said, "And you can quote me on this," assuming that apart from that instance, I could drop my guard because I would not be quoted. But (and I have now been told that this is common practice) I was recorded without my knowledge, and everything I said was "fair game" for the article. 
As I'm sure my friends (and enemies) can agree, this law student has a tenden­cy to embellish his point. That's just one of the many skills the NDLS Trial Advocacy program teaches you. Unfortunately, when a paper reports "sound bytes," a speaker's more colorful statements can be divorced from their intended purpose. The quotes used were taken out of their context, and should be seen for what they were -about 30 sec­onds from a conversation that lasted roughly 1,750. 
Next, what should have been said (more clearly) in the article? Well, my first point to Ken was that, in my opinion, the Law School requires particular courses that aren't the most practical, vis. Jurisprudence and Ethics II, and that those courses are inappropriately under­stood as an integral part of the Law School's mission to educate a "different" kind of lawyer. And my second point was to suggest that while these courses are highlighted, other elements of a full legal education, which I explained to Ken included the study of the Federal Rules of Evidence and Trial Ad[ vocacy], are eclipsed. 
Part of making those points was to make abundantly clear to Ken my opinion that jurisprudence isn't very practical ... or as I put it, "jurisprudence is a joke." I have nothing against jurisprudence, per se; I have a BA with dual majors in poli­tics and legal philosophy and a MA in legal philosophy. It's the implementation that I fmd problematic. The administra­tion can require the course, but it cannot tell the faculty how to teach or evaluate the classes. That results in a marked gap between the concept of the course and the rather deficient-form it actually takes, or what many students would call a waste of our time. The law is important, as is good philosophy. But when you require nearly 100 adults to squeeze into .an over­crowded room and be force fed some mutation of legal philosophy, that exercise rings more comical than constructive. 
As a corollary, I had hoped to make it clear that this school lacks a strong focus on the practical, particularly the Trial Advocacy program. Consider the follow­ing. This Law School does not have one room that is capable of properly accom­modating a jury trial. And the drawings of the new courtroom show it is designed for appellate arguments, and not trials. 
Here's a shocker; you generally don't have an appeal unless you have a trial, but here at NDLS, that's apparently not a concern. How does that make sense? 
Finally, what was completely omitted from the article was my actual opinion of NDLS. Simply stated, I am proud that I will be a graduate of such a great Law School. I like the faculty, the administra­tion and the strong community here. Most importantly, I feel as though I have received an education that has prepared me to enter the workforce better equipped than students from almost any other school. 
In addition, I am personally committed to NDLS' Catholic mission, as exemplified in the character of faculty and scholar­ship at this school. I find that often it is the Christian ethic of professors, such as professor Matt Barrett, that can motivate them to pursue their vocation as educa­tors with an unparalleled dedication. Equally as important is the work of pro­fessor John Finnis, who is the epitome of a Catholic law professor and foremost among my intellectual heroes. 
Now it is my personal opinion that when the commitment to a "Catholic mis­sion" supersedes the practical necessities of a legal education, this school gets into trouble. And this, I believe, is one reason why the school's rankings are not as high as they could be. This can be seen in the failure to require something as simple as a course on evidence instead of a second ethics course. It can be seen in the unwa­veringly conservative approach to admin­istration that underlies many other actions at the school. And it can be seen in the employment of professors best suit­ed for philosophy-based courses as instructors in the secular law. 
A mix of both young and seasoned legal scholars, all of whom respect the school's Catholic mission, are responsible for teaching these Catholic or philosophy-based courses. I find it unfortunate that additional responsibilities are placed on several seasoned professor:s who would be better employed to provide the "differ­ent" aspects of the NDLS education, facul­ty who, in my opinion, are unable to teach any substantive -dare I say real -Law School course as well as other teachers. A contract is not a bread bowl. This is a divisive point, but one I am willing to make. The quality of a professor has nothing to do with religious affiliation. Neither does directing the Career Service Office, or being a librarian. But ifthe first hiring criterion is the ability to promote Catholic thought, the ability to teach sub­stantive law (or do anything else) must come second, or third, or fourth ... 
So, here's a suggestion. Hire the best professors you can. Get the best contracts professor. Get the best criminal law pro­fessor. Get the best international law pro­fessor (oh ... we already have her). Use some of that money and get Chemerinsky to come to NDLS. And do it while main­taining a balance between the concept of a Catholic mission and a "secular" legal education. 
I am confident that this school enjoys a position among the best Law Schools in the nation in large part because of the contributions of the faculty and the cur­rent administration. I am grateful for Dean O'Hara's leadership both in bringing the Law School into a new and much needed building, as well as working to strengthen the relationship between the administration and the students. I believe that most of the faculty are ranks above their academic peers in scholarship and teaching ability. As with all things in life, I think that there is still room for growth. But ... that's just one man's opinion.

Awareness main goal ofT-shirts 
I would like to thank Thomas Klepach for his Letter to the Editor ("T-shirts raise awareness, limit funds," April 18). As activists, we must always ask ourselves how we can b~st deliver our message, work toward our cause, and not lose sight of the real goal at hand. Social justice activists, in particular, must avoid becoming good-inten­tioned people who lose sight of the real purpose of their work. However, in regards to the choice of the Millennium Development Goals Task Force of the CSC to use T-shirts in their action week advocacy, I will give no apology. 
First, unlike Klepach speculated, the cost of the MDG T­shirts were entirely funded through a private company, which holds the Millennium DevelopmentGoals and the work of this task force close to its heart. Its generosity in donating the T-shirts is what enables us to give the entire $10 cost of each T-shirt to the Malaria No More bed-net distribution in Africa. The shirt is by no means intended to encourage "publicly lauding the self for donating to an anti'-malaria cause." On the contrary, the main purpose of these shirts is to raise awareness about all eight of the Millennium Development Goals -thus the large eight on the shirt -to which many students at Notre Dame have had little to no exposure. 
This is about teaching our campus that these goals exist and that the U.S. government has not fulfilled its commitments to them. The shirt aims to encourage peo­ple to ask questions, such as Klepach's, and to inspire students to help make the goals a reality. Furthermore, issues like malaria are not simply about "garnering resources for a charitable effort on another continent," as Klepach states. This is exactly the mentality about global issues that we hope to squash in our action week. Although monetary donations are obviously important, the largest impact we can have on issues of poverty, inequality, environmental injustice, etc. is through chang­ing our ways of thinking about the marginalized, chang­ing the way our government prioritizes its funds and the way we decide to spend our time. 
We are trying to shift the paradigm that led to these inequalities, in the first place. Awareness is the first step. If this task force were primarily a fundraising group, which we are not, then perhaps it would have been more helpful to the children of Africa to donate the money from our sponsor company directly to the bed net fundraiser. But then our already informed task force would be the only people learning anything. Through our T-shirt cam­paign we have the potential to create hundreds more dedicated students to the MDGs and, in the future, the number of bed-net donations will far exceed anything a few individuals could do. 
This T-shirt will serve as a constant reminder of our commitment to think and act toward these goals each day we wear it. For these reasons, we feel that the benefits of our campaign far outweigh the costs.

Value of a life 
This past Monday, people across the coun­try were glued to their television screens, witnessing the chaos that ensued as the result of the violence carried out on the Virginia Tech campus. Deservedly, this event received a great deal of publicity-it was on the front page of The Observer and also had multi-page layouts and analysis in the Chicago Tribune and New York Times. What didn't receive due media attention were the 37 Iraqi civilians who died the same day of the very same unwarranted and selfish vio­lence, as well as others in Darfur, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and other war-torn regions who perish daily. 
These stories were overshadowed by the story which undoubtedly hit much closer to home for many on the Notre Dame campus. But we must remember that regardless of the locality of violence, it is still violence. The Virginia Tech students who died are no more or no less human than the countless people who die-every day. 
This is neither a pro-nor anti-war debate. This is a life debate. The murders at Virginia Tech are indeed a tragedy, but pleas.e be aware that in many"countries vio­lence of this nature is part of their bleak, everyday reality. The frequency of this sort of violence should not discount its impact on our conscience. We must be thankful that we don't suffer from the fear of bombs and bloodshed on a daily basis but also be more mindful about the tragedies and suffering that are experienced by those stretched across the world.

THEATRE PREVIEW 

Love takes center stage in 'La Locandiera' 
By MICHELLE FORD ICE Assistant Scene Editor 
As one of the few foreign language pro­ductions on campus, "La Locandiera" ("The Innkeeper") is an excellent addition to Notre Dame's theatre season. A strong and excited cast and crew have brought what could have been a very unapproachable play -both in setting and language -to a point where it can be 

First. the posters advertising the play come in both Italian and English versions. The score from an opera based on "La Locandiera," composed by Antonio Salieri, will be played throughout the intermis­sions. Lastly, all of the ushers will speak Italian. 
"La Locandiera," chosen to commemo­rate the 300th anniversary of its author, Carlo Goldoni, tells the tale of Mirandolina, an innkeeper whose beauty and charm 
have left her with a promi­must surmount to experience "La Locandiera" is the Italian language. Students of Italian should take advantage of hearing the language spoken, but the rest should not be afraid. The plot is easy to follow (especially with the detailed synopsis provided in the program), and many of the jokes and emotions are universally under­stood. Thankfully, there are few places where the action is too difficult to grasp. 

"La Locandiera" should not be missed by any of Notre Dame's Italian community, and would be a wonderful new experience for those less familiar with the language. The themes it approaches and entertain­ment it provides can be universally enjoyed. 
"La Locandiera" will show Saturday and Sunday at the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center Philbin Theatre at 2:30 p.m. and 7:30p.m.

DVD REVIEW 

'Half Nelson' highlights power of relationships 
By RAMA GOTTUMUKKALA Senior StaffWrii'er 
When Ryan Gosling climbs into char­acter and takes his place by the chalk­board in "Half Nelson," he commands complete attention. 
Although he was nominated for an Academy Award, Gosling is not the first actor to play this role. But the familiar­ity he brings to Dan Dunne, a charis­matic but flawed inner-city teacher, makes all the difference. 
Not because you've seen this charac­ter in some other movie, but because Gosling makes you feel like you've met the man before. Exuding the warmth and comfort of a formative school­teacher, he entices you to lean forward and listen more closely to his words. 


This tactile connection between actor and audience drives "Half Nelson," a wonderfully understated and frequent­ly touching film. Dunne leads two very different lives. 
By day, he's a dedicated and caring middle-school teacher and basketball coach. 
But at night, he wanders through parties and streets, limp and lifeless, searching for his next crack cocaine fix. As the movie progresses, night and day begin to blur precariously. After one particularly long day, Dunne ducks into a locker room to get high, thinking he's alone. 
Fortunately, Trey (Shareeka Epps), a mature but reserved girl from Dunne's class, walks in on him sitting dazed in one of the bathroom stalls, legs pulled up to avoid being detected. 
This scene is chilling in its effective­ness. Played almost entirely without dialogue, the emotion tugs at us through looks stained with pain, shock and shame. 
Like many of the best moments in the l'ilm, it boils the action down to one profound relationship. Soon, an unlike­ly friendship develops between teacher 
. and student that extends beyond the classroom, and with far greater conse­quences. At its heart, "Half Nelson" works as a simple, somewhat predictable story told well. Regardless, the film thrives on its approach to the material, where much is left unsaid and there are no easy answers for .Dunne's pitiable con­dition. All of this is elevated by the remarkable chemistry between Gosling and Epps. With its recent release on a single­disc DVD, "Half Nelson" is finally avail-

able to the wide audience it deserved but never got during its limited art­house theatrical run. With crisp video and audio quality, the film's striking cinematography and nuanced sound­track are on fine display. 
For special features, the disc includes deleted scenes, outtakes and a music video. The main attraction, however, is a meticulous commentary from Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, the talented writer-director team behind the pic­ture. 
Consistently entertaining, they dis­cuss how a sub-million dollar inde­pendent film gets financed and made and the various technical and acting choices used to bring the material to life. Only a "Half Nelson" trailer is lacking here. 
Gosling's rare empathic ability to capture us within minutes of his arrival ensures that Dunne's troubles become our own -the mark of any fine drama. "Half Nelson" is one of those all-too­rare films that test your patience for much of the running time, before final­ly rewarding you for your indulgence. 
It subtly builds to a final, entirely silent confrontation between mentor and pupil. The sad little smile Gosling gives to Epps is heartbreaking in its sincerity, a quiet moment of truth that is as raw and moving a segment of cin­ema as the medium can muster.

You may know him as that kid from "Holes," Keanu Reeves' sidekick in the epic "Constantine," or most likely as Louis Stevens, the perennial prankster from the Disney Channel's now-defunct series "Even Stevens."· But Shia LaBeouf, with this summer's massive "Transformers" live-action blockbuster and current box­office champ "Disturbia," is fast becoming both a household name and a critical dar­ling. 
A Hollywood kid by birth, the mop­topped Shia (pronounced SHY-ah) was born in Los Angeles and grew up with the drive to perform. The little LaBeouf often toured around his childhood neighbor­hood with a self-designed comedy act, and eventually decided to hunt for an agent and go professional. At age seven, he phoned in an appointment with an agency and, after performing his routine, got himself some representation. Not bad for a kid whose contemporaries were barely starting first grade. 
LaBeouf continued his rise to fame with his most high-profile role, that of Louis Stevens, the youngest kid of the Stevens clan on the eponymous Disney sitcom. The show -which ran until LaBeouf's first major movie, "Holes," came out in 2003 -was hugely popular with Disney's tween fanbase and critics alike, and LaBeouf even won a daytime Emmy for the role. Louis, with best friends Twitty and Tawny, took his Sacramento middle school and its hapless principal, Mr. Wexler, by storm with his crazy schemes and ridiculous, slapstick-style comedy. LaBeouf's sweet, affable and completely goofy performance endeared him to the tail end of Generation Y and their older siblings, and the accessibility of exposure on the Disney Channel has helped him as

There are a couple things in this world that are just not smart to do. It's not smart to yell "fire" in a movie theatre,. for example. It's also not smart to remake classic films -especially Hitchcock movies. 
Even though the new film "Disturbia" isn't an official remake of the Jimmy Stewart/Grace Kelly classic, "Rear Window," it's hard not to make compar­isons between the two. This strongly works to the disadvantage of "Disturbia." While it's not a bad film on its

his house. Where Stewart's charac­ter was injured and wheelchair-bound, the modern technological counterpart is an ankle bracelet that Kale received after punching his teacher at school. 
Bored at home, Kale starts surveying the neighborhood with his best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) and a pair of binocu­lars. Added to their group is Ashley (Sarah Roemer), the hot blonde in the bikini who recently moved in next door and met the pair after she noticed Kale spying on her. 
Ashley isn't the only one Kale watches, however. Another neighbor, for example, has an affair with his housekeeper. And the younger kids who've been teasing the confined Kale apparently watch a lot of porn. Most importantly, though, is the neighbor behind Kale's house -Mr. Turner (David Morse), a strange guy who seems to have unhealthy relationships with women that might be prostitutes. To make matters worse, he drives a car that looks suspiciously like one that the cops suspect may belong to a high-profile 
serial killer. 
But director D.J. 
does get right, 
however -and where the film manages to distance itself from "Rear Window" -is in the ways the kids relate and interact in a modern world where iPods and laptop are ubiq­uitous, and where much of their daily lives is reducible to digital blips. Cell phones, the Internet and even a garage door opener all play pivotal roles in the detective story, often adding a nice layer of suspense to the film. 
While LaBeouf and Roemer can't com­pare to the classic elegance of Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly, they do have their own endearing teenage qualities. LaBeouf in particular possesses the same kind of dorky charm that John Cusack did in his youth. All of the teenagers come across as real characters, which is always good to see (and hard to find) in teen flicks. David Morse delivers an exceedingly creepy performance as the potential bad guy. He exudes an evil air that dominates the film as the tone pro­gresses from a teen comedy into a gen­uinely frightening thriller. 
Admittedly, "Disturbia" starts out a bit slow, but once the detective story takes off, it's an enjoyable popcorn-thriller with a surprisingly good cast and a much better story than expected. Yes, it's hard to ignore the film's obvious cinematic roots, but in the end, the repackaging is good enough that it almost stands on its own.

Shia LaBeouf, right, stars with Sarah Roemer in "Disturbia." LaBeouf, formerly the star of Disney's "Even Stevens," has become one of Hollywood's brightest new stars. 
he expands his acting range into more complex roles. 
LaBeoufs first big film role, the protag­onist in "Holes," was an easy bridge between television and cinema for the young actor. Stanley Yelnats, the slightly goofy mop-top who finds himself at the center of a crime circle rooted in Wild West legends and a century-long treasure hunt, was a character not too different from the fun_-loving Louis that fans had grown to love, but with a twinge of heart and a touch of the serious. The success of "Holes," based on the best-selling novel by children's author Louis Sachar, proved that LaBeouf was ready for the big time. 
Other films of note in LaBeoufs rise to fame include "A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints," a coming-of-age drama starring Robert Downey Jr., "The Battle of Shaker Heights," the second in Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's "Project Greenlight" series, and "Bobby," the 2006 critically acclaimed ensemble piece about the Robert F. Kennedy assassination. 
Currently, LaBeouf's latest film, "Disturbia," is turning heads and ticket turnstiles. "Disturbia," a horror/thriller type flick that draws its roots from clas­sics of the genre, most notably Hitchcock's "Rear Window," was recently the top draw at the box office, making over $20 million dollars. LaBeoufs lead role, in a project that's about as far from "Even Stevens" as you can get, shows how much this versatile young actor is capable of. 
LaBeouf is also versatile off of the silver screen. For example, LaBeouf, with best friend and fellow actor Lorenzo Eduardo, has begun his own hip-hop group and record label, Element, as well as a pro­duction company. 
With this diverse career path and a bright future ahead, former Disney tot Shia LaBeouf looks as though he's on his way to becoming one of his generation's most multitalented actors.

SMC GoLF 
O'Brien leads Belles to conderencetournannent 
By KATE ARNOLD 
News Writer 
The weather has finally decid­ed to cooperate with the Belles. 
After yet another delay, mem­bers of the Saint Mary's squad will travel this weekend to Marshall, Mich., to compete in the two-day, 36-hole first round of the MIAA NCAA qualifying tournament. The first round was originally scheduled to start April 12, but was post­poned due to poor weather con­ditions. 
Last October, captain Katie O'Brien fired an 85, leading the team to a fourth-place finish in the fall MIAA NCAA Championships. After three 18­hole jamborees and an 18-hole tournament, the Belles finished with a total team score of 373, falling behind Olivet, Tri-State University and Albion. Each of those squads will compete again this weekend. Although Saint Mary's has not beat Olivet yet this year, the team is anxious to prove themselves today. 
Saint Mary's has not played competitively since March 25, when it placed 19th in the Northern Kentucky Open. Belles coach Mark Hamilton said the three-week layoff will not have a positive effect on the team, but he is confident that the Belles will place well. 
"This will be the easiest course we have played all spring," Hamilton said. "The tournament will be won on the greens." 
The team has been working especially hard to eliminate wasted strokes on and near the putting surface. 
The third and fmal qualifying round will be held April 24 at Tri-State University's Zollnar golf course. The winning team after the three rounds will advance to the NCAA Championships, taking place May 8-11 at El Campeon Golf Course at the Mission Inn Resort & Club in Howey-in-the­Hills, Fla.

NO WOMEN'S LACROSSE 
ND finish season with ·RU 
By MICHAEL BRYAN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's lacrosse team will attempt to give its seniors a final home vic­tory as they finish the regular season Saturday against No. 18 Rutgers. 
For the Irish, currently in a three-way tie for first in the Big East with Georgetown and Syracuse, the game will deter­mine the team's final standing in the conference, as well as seeding for the inaugural Big East tournament. 
With a Notre Dame win and Syracuse loss against Loyola, the Irish would win the regular season Big East title and cap­ture the No. 1 seed in the con­ference tournament. If all three teams win Saturday, the tiebreaker will be determined by each team's goal differential in Big East play. A loss against the Scarlet Knights would likely drop Notre Dame to the No. 4 seed. 
Despite the importance of the Syracuse and Georgetown games this the weekend, Irish coach Tracy Coyne said her team will be focused only on a victory over Rutgers. 

"It's a must-win game for us, and before we start thinking about anyone else or tiebreak­ers, we need to just win our game," Coyne said. 
Rutgers enters the match with an 11-3 record, having lost only to ranked teams Georgetown, Syracuse and Princeton. Despite their impressive record, the Scarlet Knights will be looking for their first big win of the sea­son against the Irish. 
Defensively, Notre Dame will focus on Rutgers All-American Katie Batiuk. The senior leads the Big East in points with 39 goals and 23 assists. Kate Shomo, Nina Frankowski and Michelle Poole also lead the Scarlet Knights offense, each tallying more than 24 goals on the year. 
The Irish will look to send their seniors out with a victory in the final home game of their careers. Coyne said seniors Meaghan Fitzpatrick, Lena Zentgraf, Kaki Orr, Meghan Murphy and Kristin Hopson have been integral to Notre Dame's success. 
"The seniors have done an 

..
amazing job, and have been outstanding leaders," Coyne said. "At the same time, though, they're still looking to do some things to establish themselves and leave a legacy." 
Zentgraf. Orr and Murphy have made huge contributions offensively to a balanced scor­ing attack. Orr and Zentgraf have been excellent in draw control for the Irish, and Murphy has 18 goals and 16 assists on the year. 
Hopson and Fitzpatrick have led the team defensively all sea­son, often matching up with opponents' toughest players. The duo has helped the Irish become one of the best defen­sive squads in the Big East. 
The senior class will look to build on its legacy in the coming weeks, with one of the team's main goals being a champi­onship in the first-ever Big East tournament. In addition, with an NCAA Tournament berth, the senior class would make its third tournament appearance -the most ever by a Notre Dame class.

Bargar shuts out Valpo as Irish roll 

By LORENZO REYES Sporrs Wrirer 

Coming off her no-hit per­formance Wednesday, sopho­more Brittney Bargar pitched another gem against Valparaiso Thursday at Ivy Field. In her 17th complete game of the season, the soph­omore allowed seven hits and two walks on seven strikeouts in the 5-0 win. 
In her home starts, Bargar has been unstoppable, rack­ing up a 9-0 record with a 
0.22 ERA. The Irish improved to 24-14 on the season with the win. 
Notre Dame's bats heated up early and often, taking all five of their runs in the first inning. Senior Stephanie Brown continued her impres­sive play with a leadoff single, later advancing to second on a sacrifice bunt. 
Junior Katie Laing then smacked a double down the left field line, scoring Brown from second. This two-bagger gave Laing a season-best four­game hitting streak. Freshman Christine Lux responded with another dou­ble, scoring Laing. Lux would later advance to third on a balk. 
Sophomore Linda Kohan then singled to bring Lux in for an RBI. Kohan then scored all the way from first on soph­omore Beth Northway's dou­ble. Bargar helped out her own cause when she singled to bring in Northway, scoring

the fifth and final run of the inning. 
The Irish would later tack on some hits leading to base runners, and nearly scored another until a player was tagged out in a rundown. 
That was more than enough for Bargar, who improved to 16-7 on the season, extending her scoreless inning streak to 20. 
Bargar and senior pitcher Kenya Fuemmeler will need to continue their impressive pitching this weekend with doubleheaders on both Saturday and Sunday. 
To start off the weekend, Louisville will travel to Ivy Field for a pair of conference games begininng at noon Saturday. The Cardinals are currently behind the Irish in the Big East standings at third place with a 7-1 conference record and a 25-18 mark overall. After the Cardinals, the Irish stay at home for another doubleheader Sunday at noon against South Florida.

MEN'S TENNIS 

Squad set for Big East tournament 
ByJAY WADE Sporrs Writer 
All the hard work this season has paid o(T. 
No. 6 Notre Dame was rewarded for its 21-3 record this season when it was named the No. 1 seed in the Big East tournament, which begins today at South florida in Tampa, Fla. 
Since the Big East has only eight men's tennis teams and does not have a format where all league teams play each other, seeding for the tourna­ment is based on overall record and ranking. 
The Irish, who joined the Big East 11 years ago, has a suc­cessful past in the Big East tournament. This year marks the third year in a row -and ninth time overall -that the Irish have been the top seed. On top of that, the Irish have reached the finals of the tour­nament every year since joining the league, winning five it times, most recently in 2005. 
In 2006, second-seeded Louisville upset Notre Dame in the finals. The Irish do not expect a similar fate this year, however, with one of their high­est rankings and best records in school history. 
The Irish will face eighth­seeded and unranked Villanova in the first round. Going into the match, the Irish are not only riding a four-match win­ning streak and also have a 33 game win streak against unranked opponents. They are also 95-3 all-time against teams in the Big East. The team's phi­losophy all year, however, has been to take it one match at a time, and they are not ready to overlook Villanova. 


The Wildcats are coming off two successive wins -by 5-2 and 7-0 margins -against Quinnipiac and Sacred Heart, respectively. Louisville is now 5-9. 
"They have six pretty good players who are all pretty well balanced but I feel good about our chances," said head coach Bobby Bayliss. 
The winner of this weekend's competition gets an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. More important for the Irish, winning the tournament is paramount in getting the team 
tested and ready for the NCAAs. 
"Our goals are bigger than [the Big East Tournament]," Bayliss said. "The idea is to really condition ourselves to do well in the NCAA Tournament and this is the first step in our postseason goals." 
The first serve will be at 9 
a.m. today. The winner of the first game will face either fourth-seeded DePaul or fifth­seeded St. John's in the second round.

Irish look to record additional qualifiers 
By BILL BRINK Sports Writer 
Heading into this week­end's meets, Notre Dame has earned 16 bids to the NCAA Mideast Regional meet. The Irish, however, are far from finished. 
This weekend, some will runners will head to Eugene, Ore., for the Oregon Invitational, some will trav­el to Ypsilanti, Mich., to com­pete in the Central Collegiate Championship and others will go to West Lafayette, Ind. for the Dave Rankin Invitational. Each meet could see additional Irish athletes achieve qualifying times. 
Junior sprinter Domenique Manning missed qualifying in the 100-meter hurdles by 
0.01 seconds last weekend at the Azusa Pacific Invitational. Junior Crysta Swayzer and freshman Joanna Shultz should also qualify in the 400 meters, according to sprints coach John Millar. 
"Joanna's a tenth [of a sec­ond] off, Crysta's two tenths off," he said. "Over the last couple weeks they've consis­tently come down in their times, 
the high jump, but she is recovering from surgery on both legs. 
"She's getting her strength back," jumps coach Scott Windsor said. "She's made some pretty good strides this season." 
Senior thrower Garet Koxlien can qualify in both the discus and the hammer throw, but suffered a torn groin muscle last weekend at the Mount SAC Relays. 
"He's right there," throw­ing coach B.J. Linnenbrink said. "He's had a couple injuries that have set us back a little bit. But once we get recovered he'll be fine." 
Despite the injury prob­lems plaguing some of the field athletes, several others are in good position to quali­fy. Linnenbrink expects sophomore Anna Weber and junior Mike Schubert to qualify by the time the regional meet rolls around. He also said the way his throwers are practicing is a sign of positive things to come. 
"Right now it's just a mat­ter of doing what we do in practice and having that carry over into competition," he said. "In practice every d_ay, we're

Junior Austin Wechter and senior Jordan Powell both lack regional qualifications. Millar said Powell is about half a second away from the standard and has a good chance to achieve it. 
Millar was optimistic about the abilities of his sprinters. 
"All five of those I'd ven­ture to say are legitimate athletes with potential to do it, and ones that we sort of expect to see come through by the end of the season," he said. 
The field athletes have been hampered with injuries of late. Senior Cassie Gullickson has the ability to qualify but suffers from plantar fasciitis in her foot and may not compete. Sophomore Lauren Bascardi has a chance to qualify in

tial qualifiers for the Irish. Saxer cleared the necessary height last weekend, but the event was moved indoors because of bad weather. Any competi­tion moved indoors cannot count towards a qualifying spot. 
Jacques' recent perform­ances bode well for him. 
"He came real close in this past weekend out at Azusa in the high jump," Windsor said of Jacques, who com­petes in both the long jump and the high jump. "He was looking real good at 2.10 [meters]. He came real close to clearing it. And in the long jump he did pretty well."

"They have a lot of seniors on their team, and since this is their last game -they didn't qualify for their conference tournament -they're going to be pretty hungry," senior Brian Hubschmann said. "They have a lot of motivation despite their losing record." 
On defense, the Irish will have to account for senior attack Stephen Marino, who leads the Mountain Hawks in both points (33) and assists (18). On the offensive end, Notre Dame will look to exploit a Lehigh defense that has allowed 57 first-half goals this season. 
The Irish have the balanced offensive attack to do so. Notre Dame has four players that have netted 18 or more goals on the season. Sophomore attack Ryan Hoff leads the way with 28 goals on the year, and his 2.55 goals per game aver­age is 13th in the nation.

The Irish rotation for the weekend is set, with sopho­more ace David Phelps getting the start Friday. Last week, in a 10-0 victory over Georgetown. Phelps threw seven scoreless innings to lower his ERA to 1.34 on the season. He also struck out eight while passing out just two walks. 
Lefthander Wade Korpi will take the hill for the Irish Saturday. In the win against Purdue, Korpi warmed in the bullpen as sophomore Sam Elam ran up his pitch count in the late innings. But Korpi never entered the game as Elam held the Boilermakers scoreless over nine innings. Korpi takes a 3. 99 ERA into the matchup with West Virginia. 
"I would have never guessed that Sam Elam would give us nine innings like he did," Irish coach Dave Schrage said. 


Junior righty Tony Langford came in to pitch the 1Oth against Purdue before the Irish scored the deciding run in their half of the inning. 
On Sunday, freshman righty Eric Maust gets the ball for the Irish. Schrage said Maust, also a punter on the football team, was originally scheduled to start Saturday. But Schrage altered the rotation so that Maust could play in the Blue­Gold Game. 
The Irish, who are 10-4 at home, are hitting .320 with men on base this season but have struggled badly in losses with runners on.

Using height advantage, Frank Kendrick controlled the offensive glass, winning second chance opportuni­ties. The team was also able to penetrate and dish the ball to its big men in the post for points.

Irish head to championships 
By LORENZO REYES Sports Writer 

Notre Dame will travel to Louisville Sunday for the Big East championships at the Oxmoor Country Club. The three-day tournament will end Tuesday. 
The Irish enter a field of seven, joining Georgetown, Hutgers, USF, Cincinnati, St. John's and Louisville. 
The course is a par-72, 6,067-yard course that will bring out the best from each Big East team vying for the top spot. 
Coach Susan Holt said the team hadn't done anything dif­ferent to prepare for the tour­nament. 
"We have been going about everything as business as usual, practicing hard every day," she said 
She made no distinction as to where the team's focus has been, 
"Our main goal is to do our best and win it all," she said. 
Starting the championships 

for the Irish is senior co-cap­tain -and the most consistent Irish golfer this season -Noriko Nakazaki, who is com­ing off her season-best second­place finish at the Indiana Invitational. Nakazaki has led the team in shooting in all but one event this season. 
Taking the second spot is freshman Annie Brophy, who has been a solid contributor throughout the season. The freshman has become a solid golfer from the second posi­tion, earning the Irish valuable points to aid the team's overall standing. 
Teeing off third spot of the lineup will be fellow freshman Kristin Wetzel, whose best per­formance came at the end of the UNLV Invitational last March, shooting an even-par 
72. Following her will be class­mate Julie Kim. Both Wetzel and Kim have proven to be a solid core of young talent at the middle of the lineup for Notre Dame. 
The fifth and final position will go to sophomore Lisa Maunu, who has rounded up the lineup with solid perform­ances, most notably her even­par 72 at the UNLV Invitational. 
Maunu said Notre Dame is optimistic heading into the conference championship. 
"We are excited to play well, everyone has been practicing hard and I think we have been waiting all year to break through and this is going to be the tournament," she said. 
The Irish have learned from past failures and improved their overall play, Maunu said. 
"We all can hit the ball, putt the ball, but it is the break­down of our mental game," she said. "We however, learned our mistakes last tournament [Indiana Invitational] and will not let that happen again." 
One thing that Holt has stressed to her team in prac­tice is confidence. 
"She knows we can do it and we just all have to come together and play our best golf," Maunu said.

MLB 
Phillies, Astros eke out victories 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Jamie Moyer and Aaron Rowand helped the Philadelphia Phillies give manager Charlie Manuel a victory. 
Moyer took a two-hit shutout into the ninth inning, and Rowand hit his first homer of 2007, leading the slumping Phillies past the Washington Nationals 4-2 Thursday. 
Tossing in the 60s and 70s mph -and, only occasionally, in the low 80s -Moyer (2-1) allowed a single in the second, another in the third, and noth­ing inore until Ryan Zimmerman's double leading off the ninth. Dmitri Young fol­lowed with an RBI double, and that was it for Moyer. 
Tom Gordon came on and made things interesting, hitting his first batter, then allowing a single that loaded the bases with no outs. 
Pinch-hitter Robert Fick's sacrifice fly made it 4-2, but Gordon secured his third save by getting Brian Schneider to ground out and striking out Chris Snelling. 
Philadelphia, which entered a league-worst 3-10, won despite playing without reigning NL MVP Hyan Howard, who hurt his left leg during Wednesday. night's 13-inning loss to Washington. 
The Phillies also won despite more problems with runners in scoring position, going 3-l'or-16 in such situations Thursday and 4-f'or-27 in the series. 
Oh, right, and then there's this: Manuel is under intense scrutiny because of the team's slow start and his heated exchange with a radio talk­show host Tuesday night. 
General manager Pat Gillick offered a tepid defense of his manager before Thursday's game, saying: "We've got basi­cally the same guys we had at the end of the season ... so I don't see that much decline.... He can't go up there and hit for them." 
During the third inning, four Phillies fans tried to tell Gillick their opinion about Manuel, unfurling a banner in the upper deck that read: "Hey Pat, Phire Charlie! Save Our Team!" 
Astros 8, Reds 6 
Same inning. Same rally. Same disbelief for the Reds. 
Luke Scott hit a bases-loaded double to highlight another eighth-inning rally, and the Houston Astros completed a two-game sweep of the Cincinnati Reds with a bookend victory on Thursday night. 
"It's hard to believe you could have back-to-hack nights where you give up five runs in the eighth inning," Heds man­ager Jerry Narron said. 
The Astros believed it the entire time. 
They scored five runs in the eighth inning for a 7-2 victory on Wednesday night, with Jason Lane's three-run homer leading the way. 
That was still fresh in their minds when they headed into the eighth trailing 6-2 this time around. 
"In any situation, whenever you come back like that, it's positive energy," Scott said. Manager Phil Garner could sense it, too. 
"There was a feeling like we were in the ballgame," Garner said. 
Lance Berkman started the comeback sequel with a run­scoring single -his lOOth career RBI against the Reds ­and the Astros loaded the bases against closer David Weathers (0-2), who was summoned early with the game slipping away.

Top-seeded Irish 
to take on UConn 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Editor 
No. 1 seed and two-time defend­ing champion Notre Dame will take on Conneeticut in the quarter­finals of the Big East tournament today. 
The Irish earned a bye in the first round due to their consistent play throughout the season, which gave them a 23-2 dual mateh record. 
Notre Dame coach Jay Louderback expects junior Brook Buck to take part in the doubles matches, but said she will sit out No. 6 singles. 
"I don't know who'll play No. 6 singles, but the doubles will be full strength," Louderback said. 
Today marks the first time Buck and her doubles partner, sopho­more Kelcy Tefft, will be competing together since March 16. Together, they have a 21-5 record from the No.2 slot. 
Louderback said his team, which is 11-2 against top-25 opponents this season, is not looking past today's mateh. 
"[Connecticut] just competes and their doubles teams .... looked pret­ty good," Louderback said. "I think it'll be a good match for us, espe­cially the first match out. I think we're definitely the more talented team but they look like a bunch of kids who compete very well." 
The Irish battle Connecticut at 9 
a.m. today, and should they win, they will face the winner of Marquette and Rutgers Saturday.

Notre Dame's young quarterbacks have one spring to show they have the right stuff to replc

Brady has left the building. 

A year ago at this time, Brady Quinn was the center of atten­tion. After each spring practice, the face of Notre Dame football who carried the team on his right arm, would enter the press room at the Guglielmino Athletic Center and immediately be surrounded by a gaggle reporters, sometimes three and four deep on every side. People wanted every last sound-bite from the Heisman candidate, Notre Dame's most recent Golden Boy. 
But today things arc different. Quinn, holder of dozens of school records, is going through a different media circus, and 146 touchdowns in that span. 
All the success strained his arm once he arrived at Notre Dame in January as an early enrollee. Weis told Clausen to rest his arm in preparation for spring practice and the freshman was ready to go when camp opened March 21. 
The coach also tried to make the Clausen's life easier b~ sequestering him from publicit~ all spring. Weis has a policy ol restricting media access to fresh­man, and in that sense Clausen was no exception. 
The Life of the Party

for his team­
mates.

Monday. 

Back in South Bend, things have changed even more. Four quar­terbacks -rising junior Evan Sharpley, rising sophomores Demetrius Jones and Zach Frazer, and early-entry freshman .Jimmy Clausen -have splintered the media horde that used to fol­low Quinn wherever he went. In fact, when they walk into the press room after practice, some reporters hang back awkwardly, unsure of which quarterback is which. 
There are no school records among the four. As a group, they amassed only seven collegiate passing yards, all of them by Sharpley. Most Irish fans -and even many of their fellow stu­dents -know them only by their jersey numbers and perhaps the number of stars next to their names on various recruiting web­sites. 
Irish coach Charlie Weis has said that he will narrow the race from four to two based on spring practice -a decision he will announce at the end of May. Until then, however, each of the four divergent personalities is con­vinced that he will be Notre Dame's next "cult hero," as Weis used to call Quinn. 
So who are these masked men? 
The Hollywood Superstar 

Clausen is the most recogniza­ble face among the four competi­tors. · 
The 6-foot-5, 207-pounder out of Westlake Village, Calif., was the top-rated quarterback nation­ally in last year's recruiting class. He committed to the Irish the morning of last year's Blue-Gold Game at the College Football Hall of Fame in downtown South Bend. 
The announcement ceremony, which included Clausen pulling up in a Hummer limousine, was witnessed by most of the media assembled for the scrimmage later that day. 
But the excitement around Clausen wasn't just because of his elaborate ceremony. The younger brother of former Tennessee quarterbacks Casey and Rick Clausen, Jimmy started all four years at Oaks Christian High School, going 42-0. He threw for more than 10;000 yards to be a peopl 
person." 
Whether it'1 
celebrating ~ sunny day with his bright rec "summer shoes" or hinting abou the "G-Code" that he and hi! friends in his native Chicago use Jones loves to goof around. HE says his sense of humor and out· going personality helps him be l leader on the team. 
"The same guys you slap on th~ back of the head before class an the guys blocking for you," h~ said. "The same people you tease are the. ones catching passes for you." 
But it hasn't been all fun anc games for Jones this spring. Ir addition to the nerve-rackin! competition for starting quarter back, he also has to worry abou his grandmother, Gloria Pierce who was diagnosed with stomach cancer. 
Jones said his faith has helpec him get through the tough times. 
''I'm a pretty Biblical persor anq I believe everything happen! for a reason," he said. 
Pierce recently moved from heJ home in Selma, Ala., t~ Indianapolis to seek better care which means he can visit he. more often. He's planning on see­ing her soon after the Blue-Gold Game. 
But Jones said her health prob­lems won't affect him on the field -Pierce wouldn't allow it. 
"She says not to worry about her, because this is one of my dreams," he said. "She would b mad if worrying about her mad me do worse on the field." 
Jones is perhaps the most ver satile of the four quarterbacks leading to some speculation out side of the team that he might switch positions if he doesn't earn the starting job. 
Jones rejects these ideas -but he's also confidentthat that ques­tion will never need to be asked. 
"I didn't come here to be a back up and I didn't come here to be anyone's sidekick," he said.

pounds. 
"Being able to see the field is my strength, along with my arm," he said. 
Frazer's teammates agree on his arm strength 
"Zach has a strong arm," rising junior wide receiver David Grimes said. "I think he can probably throw the ball 70 or 80 yards." 
After red-shirting last fall, Frazer said he couldn't wait for spring practice and the competi­tion with the other quarterbacks to begin. 
"I was counting down the days from 100 days before spring," he said. 
Frazer said the experience he gained this past season on the sidelines watching Quinn pre­pared him well for the competi­tion this spring. 
"I was little nervous on the first day of practice, but after that I felt very confident moving in there and moving the ball," he said. 
That confidence extends to more than just the playbook. Frazer said playing in front of tens of thousands of people for the first time Saturday won't rat­tle him at all. 
"You have to go out and have a good time," he said. "You can't hype it too much or you'll get nervous." 
And Frazer has no reason to be nervous, because, according to him, he's already the best option at quarterback. 
"In my eyes, I'm number one," he said. 
The Elder Statesman 
Sharpley is the only one of the four quarterbacks who was enrolled at Notre Dame ball." 
Sharpley said he would like to emulate the two-sport career of former Notre Dame wide receiv­er/pitcher Jeff Samardzija, but that being a position player in baseball makes his task more dif­ficult than Samardzija's, who only had to pitch in one game per week. 
"His situation was a lot differ­ent than mine, him being a pitch­er and then obviously already establishing himself in both sports so he had a little leeway there with time constraints where he could do a little bit more," Sharpley said. 
So while his baseball career might be on hold right now, Sharpley said it is for the best. 
"In my situation right now, I need to be here at football trying to establish myself," he said. 
What's next? 
Notre Dame has had mixed suc­cess replacing highly successful quarterbacks in the past. 
After Joe Montana graduated in 1979, the Irish used several quar­terbacks, all with limited success, and finished just 7A. 
On the other hand, in 1969, Terry Hanratty, who led Notre Dame to the 1966 national cham­pionship, gave way seamlessly to Joe Theismann, who would set one of the few school records Quinn never broke with his 526 passing yards against USC in 1970. 
In 1997, then-coach Bob Davie attempted to ease the transition between then-senior Ron Powlus (now the Irish quarterbacks coach) and then-junior Jarious Jackson by having Jackson play at various times during games.

And the 6-foot­4, 212 pound ris­ing junior out of Marshall, Mich., says that gives him an advantage. 
"I was able to sit back and kind of be a sponge and learn from Coach Weis and Brady -whoev­er was there.... It was good for me," he said. "You learn a lot of nuances, a lot of little things that are helpful in picking up the play­book." 
Of course, with that experience comes the responsibility of being a leader to younger players ­even those that Sharpley is com­peting with for playing time. 
"It's difficult in that respect because we're all going after the same position, and you'd like to help as much as you can, but you also have to realize it's someone you're competing against," he said. "We have a great relation off the field as well as on, and it's just kind of, I guess almost a mutual fondness for each other where we're out there trying to help each other compete." · 
In between spring workouts, quarterback meetings and going to class, Sharpley is also a first baseman the Irish baseball team. He has appeared in 11 games this year, driving in two runs on his lone hit. 
Weis said he's grateful that Sharpley has decided to make football his top priority. 
"Evan's been here for all the football practices," he said. "He's putting a heavy emphasis on foot-
the next 
year. 
Weis never gave that method a thought. With Quinn playing well and expectations through the roof, there was little opportunity to get meaningful snaps for a back-up. 
Instead, Weis used this spring to judge which quarterback will fill Quinn's enormous shoes. 
For other players on the roster, the transition from one experi­enced leader under center to four young players still learning the playbook has not been easy, but veterans like fifth-year senior tight end John Carlson say they are making the best of the situa­tion. 
"There are four guys that we are developing chemistry with," he said. "They all got a lot better this spring." 
. Weis will narrow down his choice to two in about a month, and next fall he'll reveal which of the four has earned the right to start against Georgia Tech in the first game of the season. 
It's a long time to wait for the four competitors, but as Jones pointed out, it means that Weis took as much as possible into consideration. 
"Patience is a virtue, and we've been waiting this long," he said. "It won't kill us to wait a little longer."

They're the newest of the new, Notre Dame's most valuable unknown commodity, starting col­lege halfWay through their senior year of high school and sprinting into the heat of competition. 
Notre Dame's second trio of early-entree freshmen -quarter­back Jimmy Clausen, running back Armando Allen and corner­back Gary Gray -all came to the Irish in January with high expec­tations. 
Clausen was the consensus high school player of the year, finishing his career at Oaks Christian in California 42-0. Allen, a product of Hialeah-Miami Lakes in Florida, is supposed to be the speed threat out of the backfield that Notre Dame has long sought. And Irish coach Charlie Weis said Gray, from Hichland Northeast in Columbia, S.C., could become a shut-down cover corner in his col­legiate career. 
For the first two, Saturday's scrimmage should be a bench­mark of their progress as the con­tinue to compete for major play­ing time -and starting roles each -while Gray remains side­lined with a broken arm. 
The success of the first few batches of "gray-shirts" -the colloquial term lor early-entrant<> -may affect Weis' ability to con­tinue the practice and attract top prospects for open slol<>. 
A year ago, running back James Aldridge, wide receiver George West and lineman Chris Stewart became the school's first-ever early-entree trio. But the expecta­tions then were different. · 
Aldridge was coming off a seri­ous knee injury that slowed his 

e 
progress and kept him out of six of the first seven games of 2006. He amassed 142 rushing yards on the season, but never came close to being the featured back behind former Irish tailback Darius Walker. 
West played in every game, but saw most of his action on special teams. He touched the ball only three times on offense -though his lone rush on an end-around saw the fleet-footed freshman break the plane on an 11-yard scamper. 
And Stewart, who entered as a tremendous offensive guard prospect, did not play a single down last season. The 6-foot-5, 340-pound lineman from Spring, Texas, will have completed the equivalent of nearly two academic years of classes by the time he first lines up for his first snap ­and he'll likely be on the defen­sive side of the neutral zone as a nose tackle when he does. 
But this year's group is differ­ent. 
Every college football fan knew Clausen was going to compete immediately for Notre Dame's starting quarterback job -the most closely watched and highly scrutinized position in the sport. 
And yet, despite a sore arm ­revealed to the press by Allen in an interview with a Miami news­paper -all signs are positive for Clausen. 
Of course, there are struggles. 
"It's tough coming in and being a freshman," Sharpley said of Clausen. "I think we've all kind of been there for each other, and it's a learning process. Especially being young, being away from home, it's tough. I think we're kind of all there for each other." 
And the problems Clausen has faced were not limited to the 

server rs now a 
young freshman. Fifth-year senior Travis Thomas said he tormented all four candidates for the starting gig -Clausen, rising junior Evan Sharpley and sophomores Demetrius Jones and Zach Frazer -about their cadences at the line of scrimmage. 
In the quarterback race, Clausen came in with the disad­vantage of no experience in the system. But the race itself has given him the distinct advantage of knowing he could be on the field as soon as Notre Dame and Georgia Tech kick otT at 3:42 p.m. on Sept. 1. 
And Clausen could be handing off to Allen on that day. Though Thomas, with four years of expe­rience and a proven ability to cre­ate plays, is the favorite for the starting job, the senior said the competition between he, Aldridge and Allen has been anything but easy. 
"I can say he's not running like a freshman; he's running like he belongs here and like he's been here before," Thomas said of Allen, who is listed as 5-foot-1 0 and 190 pounds. "He's tough for his size. I don't know what size he is-maybe 5-9, 5-10, the most­and he runs real hard. Good vision, great speed, good hands. ... l-Ie's progressing real well." 
While Allen progresses on the field, the final member of the trio, Gray, has to take his strides for­ward on the sidelines. 

"The thing that an injured play­er, any injured player, has to do is they've got to be a good classroom student," Irish defensive backs coach Bill Lewis said. "Any time a player's injured, I try to impress upon him how important his classroom meetings are." 
Lewis said his hope is that Gray latches on to a veteran, who can be a "positive role model." position must do on each play, 

"In the case of Gary, what Gary studying both the defensive calls needs to do is he needs to hang on and the offensive formations. somebody, he needs to hang his Gray's test of how he has pro­hat on somebody. gressed will come in August when

LIKELY 2007 STARTERS 


QUARTERBACK 
In onn of the most hyp0d spring position battlns of the spring, four players compPt­ed this spring for the quarterbaek position: freshman Jimmy Clausen, rising soph­
omores  Demetrius  
Jonns  and  Zach  
Frazp,r  and  rising  

junior Evan Sharpley. 


Sharpley has the only game expnrienee, ·taking late gamH snaps as Brady Quinn's backup last season. Wnis said that does not give him a largp, advan­tagn and that each quarterback has an nqual chance of win­ning the starting job. 
TIGHT END 

JOHN CARLSON 
5TH-YEAR SENIOR 
Carlson put up historic numbers last season last season. Weis used .Carlson off the line and in the slot effectively. The l'irth-year gives the Irish consistfmcy on an offense that loses its top two wide outs. 
G"'ARDS 
FULLBACK 
ASAPH SCHWAPP 
JUNIOR 
Sehwapp missed most of last season aft11r suffering a knee injury against Penn State, but was effeetive his freshman year opening holes in the middle. He looks to continue to do that in 2007. 

WIDE RECEIVER No. 2 
Although Irish eoaeh Charlie Weis has run rising sophomore George West with thH l'irst team offense most of this spring, he has given no indica­tion that West defi­nitely will be the No. 2 wide out. I'Using junior D.J. 
Hord returns this season after an injury sidelined him for all of. 2006. Incoming freshmen Duval Kumara and Golden Tate could also complicate the depth chart at wide receiver once they arrive in August for fall practices. 
LEFT TACKLE 
PAUL DUNCAN JUNIOR 
Duncan has no starting experience, offensive line coach John Latina is con­fident he can effectively replace Ryan Harris. 


CENTER 
JOHN SULLIVAN 
5TH-YEAR SENIOR 
Sullivan anchored the Irish line last season, starting all 13 games. The fifth-year senior returns as most expe­rfenced lineman. 

NOSE TACKLE 
INSIDE LB 
MAURICE CRUM, JR. 
SENIOR 
Crum led the Irish with 100 ta-ckles last sea­son in addition to on pick. He looks to be even more effective in Corwin Brown's 3-4 defense. 
CORNERBACK 
TERRAIL lAMBERT SENIOR 


Lambert was inconsistent for the Irish last sea­son. He capped off the Michigan State win with two late picks but had only one more last year. 

One of the most he can make the important posi­transition tions to fill in smoothly from the new 3-4 the offensive defense is the line. Line coach nose tackle. Jappy Oliver Rising sopho­also said rising more Chris junior Pat Kuntz Stewart is the has played well favorite to at the nose anchor the tackle this defensive line if spring. 
INSIDE LB 
JoE BROCKINGTON 5TH-YEAR SENIOR 
Brockington took a fifth-year to join Crum in the middle of Notre Dame's new 3-4 look. lie had 59 tackles in a breakout year last season. 
STRONG SAFETY 
TOM ZBIKOWSKI 5TH-YEAR SENIOR 
The explosive Zbikowski returns to the Irish for a final year of eligibility after a shoulder injury slowed the speedster in 2006. 
Notre Dame replaees. both guards this sea­son after the gradua­tion of Bob Morton and Dan Santucci. The spring leaders to lake over as the guards are rising sophomores Dan Wenger, Dan Carufel and Eric Olsen and rising junior Mike Turkovich. None of the potential starters have significant game experience to give them any advan­tage. These four have not been trying out for one speeifie start­ing spot, but rather, We is said, the best two guards will be the starters. Although Wenger and Turkovitch worked out with the first team offense early in the spring, there was no indication that they would be the starters next fall. 
DEFENSIVE ENDS 
Fifth-year son;c~r Trevor . Laws, right, is the only def­inite on the line. Laws played as a tackle in Hick Minter's 4-3 defense, but will move to end in Corwin Brown's 3-4. The move should open up more chances for Laws to make plays. No clear leader emerged early in the spring to take over the 
defensive end slot opposite Laws. although Justin Brown and Pat Kuntz have some backup experience at the end from last season. Paddy Mullen is also in the running for the second defensive line sport. Brown and Oliver have made no indication of whieh player will be the starter going into the 2007 season. 
OUTSIDE LINEBACKER 
FREE SAFETY 
With the departure of senior Chinedum Ndukwe, the free safety position is free for less-experi­enced players to step up. The two leaders during the spring are jun­iors David Bruton and Hay Herring. Bruton played mainly on special teams last year, while Herring filled in for Zbikowski when he was injured part of last season. .Freshman Harrison Smith could complicate things in August. 
RIGHT TACKLE 
SAM YOUNG SOPHOMORE 
Young started all 13 games as right tackle last season as a true freshman, and Weis feels that the best option is to keep him there in 2007. 



The biggest question mark on defense remains which two players will be the outside linebackers. Four players are in the running for the two spots -John Ryan, Anthony Vernaglia, Dwight Stephenson, Jr. and Morrice Hichardson. Hyan, left, and Vernaglia, right, are the favorites going into the spring game because they have practiced with the first team defense for most of the spring. 
CORNERBACK 
AMBROSE WooDEN 5TH-YEAR SENIOR 



Wooden lost his starting job last year after an injury, but has since regained it. Darrin Walls, Haeshon MeN eil and Gary Gray could unseat him.
