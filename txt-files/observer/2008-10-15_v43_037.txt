Bike thefts are on the rise 
By JOSEPH McMAHON Assistant News Editor 
Cycling-enthusiasts around campus may want to be more careful about how they lock their bikes because according to assistant director of Notre Dame Security Police (NDSP) Dave Chapman, bike thefts are on the rise. 
"From Aug. 2006 to Aug. 2007 we had quite a drop in the number of bikes being stolen, and now we see an increase [in bikes being stolen!. I don't know why," he said.

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Group says pep rally 
format will be changed 
ByJOHN TIERNEY News Writer 
Football pep rallies will become more student-friendly, Hall Presidents Council (HPC) athletic committee co-chairs Laura Burdick and Derek Sanchez announced at the Council of Representatives (COR) meeting Tuesday. 
The change follows growing student dissatisfaction with the football Friday events, highlighted by Sorin College's boycott of the Stanford pep rally. 
After Burdick and Sanchez talked with football coach Charlie Weis, they decided the pep rallies need to promote a "student-football relation­ship," Burdick said. 
"Part of that is us not sitting there for an hour and a half before the football team comes out," Burdick said. 
However, the pep rallies can­not completely reject the role of the alumni and other fans. According to the new proposed pep rally structure, the alumni

Fake eye gives minature horse hope for career 
LAWTON, Okla. -A miniature horse has been given a second chance for a career as a show horse -thanks to a prosthetic eye. 
The 65-pound horse, named KBuck, was born June 1 at Lil Chums Miniature Horse Farm in Lawton and lost its eye a few days after birth. Owner Kelsey Chumbley, 12, said she suspects the young horse was the victim of a swift kick from its mother. 
"We thought he was going to end up being a backyard pet" instead of a show horse, Kelsey said. "When we found out he had a second chance I was really excited for him." 

Veterinarian .Jeff Hammond of Marlow tried in .June to save the young horse's eye. When it became evident the sur­gery didn't work, Hammond suggested the cosmetic alternative. 
KBuck's prosthetic eye was handcrafted by designers at La Fuente Ocular Prosthetics in Oklahoma City.

Oub hosts \Vinner of business avvard 
By MOLLY MADDEN 
News Writer 

Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, winner of the 2007 Harvard Business School Alumni Achievement Award, said it is possible to help out poor communities while at the same time making a profit in a 
lecture  hosted  by  the  
Entrepreneurship  Society  
Tuesday.  
Ayala  spoke  to  students  

about how he has developed business solutions that engage impoverished areas while still moving forward with economic growth. 
Ayala is the CEO of the Ayala Corporation and received the award for providing water for poor areas in his home country, the Philippines. 
At the start of this project in 1999, only 26 percent of people in the Philippines received water 24 hours a day, Ayala said. In 2007, after Ayala and his corporation had completely redesigned -the project, the number rose to 99 people. At the same time, the company made a profit, he said. 
"Originally in 1999, we invested $67 million into the project. The company now makes $50 million per year off this venture," Ayala said.

In order to do this, Ayala said businesses must know about the cul­ture and the people they are trying to do business with and remember that, in some cases, they are working with people living below the poverty line.

"Businesses that are setting out on these ventures need to expand their market but also reach people who have less money to spend," Ayala said. "They need to think of whole new ways to bring costs down." 
"You want to touch commu­nities at the lowest level of income and make them your customers,"Ayala said. "In order to do that, you have to make it beneficial to them." 
The biggest challenge that companies will face is changing the way that they do business and adapting their methods so that they will fit with the com­munity and people that they are trying to reach, Ayala said.

Ayala said companies must consider people as well as money when they make deci­sions about their business ven­tures. 
"Business is not just dealing with numbers and marketing; it also deals with people," Ayala said."We can have capi­talism that fulfills social devel­opment and addresses the needs of people around the world."

Notre Dame will hold celebrations 
Special to The Observer 
Community-wide celebrations will be held to mark both the opening of Irish Green from 4 to 6 p.m. tomorrow in front of the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, and the fifth anniversary of Notre Dame Downtown from 4 to 7 p.m. Friday at 217 S. Michigan St. in South Bend. 
Free entertainment, children's activities and food will be provid­ed Thursday in celebration of the completion of the 16-acre Irish Green on the south side of the Notre Dame campus. A per­formance by the N-E-W Trio will follow at 7 p.m. in the Leighton Concert Hall of the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center. Tickets to the concert are $32 general admission, $26 for faculty and staff, $24 for seniors and $15 for students. 
The Notre Dame Downtown celebration will include live music at 4 p.m. by the Herb Wilson Ensemble and at 5:15 
p.m. from the Merriman Jazz Trio. Activities for children and food from downtown restaurants will be provided free of charge. 
Underwritten with a gift from Notre Dame Trustee Fritz L. Duda and his wife, Mary Lee, Irish Green unfolds from the DeBartolo Center to Angela Boulevard, linking the campus to the community. It is populated by maple, elm, oak, beech and other trees and shrubs, and walkways lined with benches wind through

the park. 
"Irish Green is a wonderful new gathering spot for members of both the University community and, as importantly, the greater Michiana community," said Rev. John I. Jenkins, C.S.C., Notre Dame's president. "We are grate­ful to Fritz and Mary Lee for making this beautiful addition a reality." 
In addition to serving as a venue for outdoor receptions, picnics and recreational and other activities, Irish Green will provide a convenient route from many parts of the Notre Dame campus to Eddy Street Commons. 
Notre Dame Downtown, a 10,000-square-foot venue located across the street from the State Theatre in a section of the old Robertson's department store building, houses the University's Office of Commu.uity Relations. Under the direction of Jacquelyn Rucker, the office serves as the primary administrative link between Notre Dame and the local community. It embodies the University's goal to be responsive to its neighbors and to support the local community's efforts to create a prosperous, healthy environment in which to live. 
Notre Dame Downtown also is home to The Crossroads Gallery, which is operated by the Snite Museum of Art, Institute for Latino Studies and Community Relations and showcases art as a community outreach tool.

Chapman said Flores' case is not unique. Often students report their bikes being taken multiple times. 
"We've had students who have had their bikes stolen two or three times this year," he said. 
Chapman said one of the best ways to protect a bike was to buy a steel U-lock, which unlike cable locks cannot be easily broken. 
"The best locks for bicycles are the big U-locks because those can't be cut. The other chain locks and combination locks can be cut very easily and very quickly," he said. 
Chapman also stressed it is very important for students to register their bikes with NDSP, or else, unless they have the bike's serial num­ber, NDSP is forced to hold on to the bike because they do not know whom to return it to. 
"If you don't register your bike and you don't have a serial number, then even when we find a bike that looks like yours, if you can't prove it's yours then we can't give it to you," he said. 
Currently, NDSP is holding more than 600 bikes that have been found on campus. 
"We collected over 600 bikes at the end of the school year last year that were left laying on campus," Chapman said. 
Ultimately, Chapman said his major goal is simply making sure students are able to protect their bikes. 
"We want students to have their bikes," he said. "It's a convenience for them to have their bikes to ride to class or wherever they need to, and we're trying every­thing we can do to push reg­istration and locking your bike up."

tinues on upward path it's been for past two years," The Shirt 2008 president Jason Gott said. 
By aecepting the position as The Shirt president, Barloh will be forced to relinquish his Knott Hall presidency because it is an "enumerated position," whieh is a student government position already listed in the Student Constitution, according to Student Body president Bob Heish. 
Barloh said "it has always been my contention that Ipresident of The Shirt! is not an enumerated position," but he will not protest Reish's interpretation of the Student Constitution. 
Heish insisted that he will enforce his interpretation of the enumerated positions. 
"This is an enumerated position. You will be stepping down," he said. 
Barloh said that while detail of The Shirt must remain seeret, students can expect something special this year. 
"It's the 20th anniversary of The Shirt," he said. "We would be remiss to not do something to honor that."

Anonymous fliers encourage boycott 
Disgruntled diners call for students to protest food quality served at Noble Family Dining Hall 
By MANDl STIRONE Assistant News Editor 
Monday morning Saint Mary's students living on campus woke up to find small fliers that had been slid under their doors the night before. There were no names or groups identified as being responsible for the fliers. 
The fliers called for stu­dents to take action against the Noble Family Dining Hall by boycotting dinner Tuesday night. 
"Join with the rest of the student body to show your dissatisfaction. Eat at Cyber [Cafe] Dalloway's [Coffee House] or order out," the fliers said. 
They compared the meal plan at Virginia Tech to the 
meal plan at Saint Mary's, calling what the Dining Hall serves "fake meat," as opposed to the "lobster and steak" the fliers said Virginia Tech supplies to its students. 
B a r r y Bowles, General 
Manager of Sodexo at Saint Mary's, said he was sur­prised to hear of the protest. 
"I would expect they'd come talk to me," he said. "Nobody's really contacted me at all this year about major dissatisfactions." 
As to the fliers' claim about Virginia Tech, the writ­Notre Dame, by 9 a.m., he said. 
Sodexo wont be able to tell exactly how many students went to the Dining Hall last night until they get the weekly report on Friday, Bowles said. 
In the Noble Family Dining Hall during the dinner hours, some students did decide to ignore the fliers and eat dinner in the Dining IIall. 
"The reasoning for boy­eotting is not a valid rea­son," sophomore Katie Brown said. "I don't think the food's horrible." 
Other students decided to go to dinner because they disagreed with the methods the people who created the fliers were using to be heard. 
"I don't think the students 

"/ would expect they'd come talk to me. Nobody's really contacted me at this year about major dissatisfactions. " 
Barry Bowles General Manager Sodexo 
have taken into consideration the effects of boycotting," sophomore Christina Posadas said. "Workers could be laid off." 
Others found issue with the flier's anonymi­ty and the infor­mation present­ed on the fliers.

Real estate booms, segregation stays 
BAGHDAD -An arrow in central Baghdad points down a side-street to a glass door with a sign that reads: "Ali's Office." 
That's where real estate broker Hadi Abbas Ali has greeted clients for 25 years. Now Ali is witnessing a boom of sorts in the Iraqi capital, where real estate prices have doubled in some areas. 
But a sectarian shadow hangs over the boom. Buyers don't look for a river view or simply the best deal in town. Safety-conscious Shiites seek housing in walled-in areas dominated by their sect, and Sunnis stick to their own as well. 
With little new construction afoot, there are far more buyers or renters than available homes in places like Karradah, a mostly Shiite area where Ali is hard-pressed to shrink his waiting list. 
"The business in the ama is not so good now because there is high demand but not much supply." said Ali. He not11d that. the monthly rent for a two-room apartment in Karradah. wh11rn attacks still occur. is about $400, double the pricP in 2006.

LUCASVILLE. Ohio -The first inmate to die by lethal injection in Ohio in more than a y11ar argued to the end that his obesity would make it difficult for prison staff to find suit­able veins in his arms to deliver the deadly chemicals. 
During preparations for his execution Tuesday, Richard Cooey shouted for one of his attorneys as prison staff tried to insert a shunt in his left arm.

Iraqi officials review 'final draft" with U.S. to govern use of troops in nation 
Associated Press 

BAGHDAD Iraq's prime minister and presi­dent reviewed on Tuesday the "final draft" of the security pact with the United States -a first step in a process that could finally end in an agreement governing U.S. troops in Iraq. 
Yassin Majid, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, did not say whether the draft resolved the contentious issue of legal immunity for U.S. troops, the last major obstacle standing in the way of a deal. 
Although Iraqi officials had said the issue was unresolved, Majid's use of the phrase "final draft" suggested that negotia­tions have ended. 
American and Iraqi negotiators have been working for most of this year to hammer out an agreement setting down rules for the U.S. military mission beginning next year.

Wildfires prove difficult to control in California 
Associated Press 

LOS ANGELES -Flames whirled dangerously close to homes Tw~sday as gusty Santa Ana winds sent the biggest of southern California's wildlires flaring in hilly brushlands on Los Angeles' northern edge and along subdivisions to the west. 
Firefighters with hoses guard­ed houses as helicopters unleashed loads of water on hot spots of the more than 20­square-mile blaze charring slopns above the San Fernando Valll~y 1:ommunitins of Porter Haneh and Granada llills. 
Flanws thnn pushed west to the rolling grasslands or Ventura County and made runs toward Simi Valley nnighbor­hoods of modern homns dnfend­l~d by a broad firnbmak, heli­copters, airplanes and ground crews. 
The firn is one of three major blazes that have burned more than 34 square miles of Southern California, destroyed dozens of homes and forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes this week. One man died in the flames, and a motorist was killed in a crash as a lire neared a freeway. 
Fifteen homes and 47 out­buildings were destroyed in the Porter Hanch area, and another six homes were damaged, said Los Angeles County fire Inspector Hon Haralson. Ollieials said Tuesday night they did not know how mueh of the lire was eontained. 
Ten miles away, there was major progress against Los Angeles' other big wildfire. 
A 7 -square-mile blaze in the northeastern San Fernando Valley was 80 percent con­tained and some evacuees were allowed to go home. But people who Jived in an area where 38 mobile homes were destroyed were not permitted to return. 
Teresa Eseamilla, 4 7, lay on a cot in a Red Cross shelter, thinking the worst. She believed she lost everything including a shoebox containing five years of savings. 
"It feels like it's not real," the nursing assistant said in Spanish. "It's a nightmare." 
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa acknowledged the uncertainty facing residents of the fire areas. 
"Many still don't know when they are going to return home," he told a news conferenee. "Our hearts and prayers are out with all of them." 
On the north eoast of San Diego County, a 3,950-acre fire at the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton was 60 percent con­tained. Most evacuation orders were lifted for residents of about 1,500 homes in neighbor­ing Oceanside and many Marine Corps personnel and family members in military housing, but some remained in emer­gency shelters. 
In eastern San Diego County along the U.S.-Mexico border, a fire burned 200 acres and forced residents from 300 homes in the community of Campo before it was contained Tuesday night. Firelighters kept watch for flare-ups overnight. Two were injured battling the blaze. 
The outbreak of fires followed the weekend arrival of the first significant Santa Ana winds of the fall. 
The National Weather Service said the intensity or the winds was diminishing but warned there would still be strong gusts. Warnings for critical lire weather conditions were to remain in effect until Wednesday night. 
The Santa Anas usually sweep in between Oetober and February as cold, dry air descending over the Great Basin flows toward Southern California and squeezes through mountain passes and canyons. The extremely low humidity levels, which make vegetation easier to burn, and high windspeeds combine to whip fires into infernos.

IN BRIEF 
PepsiCo to cut jobs, close plants 
NEW YORK-PepsiCo announced plans on Tuesday to cut 3,300 jobs and close six plants as it deals with lagging U.S. drinks sales and a surging dollar, which will hurt profits from its rapidly growing international business. 
The announcement came as the global snacks and drinks maker reported a 9.5 per­cent drop in third-quarter profit that missed Wall Street expectations. It also offered a downbeat profit outlook. 
The job cuts amount to roughly 1.8 percent of PepsiCo's global work force of about 185,000 employees. The cuts will affect mana­gerial and factory jobs both in and outside the 
U.S. Most will be eliminated in the coming months, Chief Financial Officer Richard Goodman said. 
The nation's second-largest drink maker ­which also owns the Frito-Lay, Tropicana and Quaker brands -said the cuts would gener­ate pretax savings of more than $1.2 billion over the next three years. It plans to save $350 million to $400 million in 2009. 
Credit markets face slow improvement 
NEW YORK -The government's efforts to crank open the credit markets have led to some mild improvements in lending rates and Treasury bill yields. But it will probably take months, and perhaps a few years, before lending returns to healthier levels. 
It was clear Tuesday that there is still plenty of fear in the lending business -one indica­tor. the dill'erence between the rate at which banks lend to other banks and the rate at which they buy U.S. government debt remains near a 25-year high. 
But analysts believe that as long as condi­tions keep improving, the economy should be able to grow. 
"I don't think we need to have credit condi­tions come back to normal before we see signs that the economy is recovering," said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. lie said he believes the financial system won't be fully restored until at least 2010, but that he expects the economy to turn around in the second half of 2009 after the housing market bottoms.

Eat Reese's, light your fire 
A few days ago I was passing through the very busy sidewalk between the main gate of Trinity College and Dublin's pedestrian shopping area. It was a cool afternoon. damp-aired but not raining, and the sky, I'd 
Katherine

noticed earlier, 
was a few shades Khorey 
lighter than the 
Both Sides 

sidewalk. I was 
Now

looking down at the sidewalk now, watching people's shoes as they passed -women in this city have some pretty awesome boots -and admiring the gray slabs of pavement, when my eye caught a patch of din~:,ry gold laid in a gutter. 
It was a small, trampled-down pile of leaves. 
Very briefly I stopped walking. 
Then, with the human traflic at my back, I started again. A'l I walked, I final­ly looked up. I saw an entire tree whose leaves had gone ochre. 
I thought, "Wow. It's fall." And then, "Really? Seriously? Fall? Already?" 
See, we only just started class this past week. For the entire month of Snptember, Notre Dame students at Trinity have done next to nothing resem­bling schoolwork. So maybe it's under­standable that the first third of autumn had slipped past me unnoticed. 
Don't let this happen to you. 
*** 

Of course, there is no part of the year, not even the nastiest depths of winter, that should pass by us unnoticed and un­experienced. At two o'clock on a snowy January morning, for instance, when someone downstairs sets their bag of popcorn on fire and the harsh blare of the fire alarm yanks you from your snug­gled deep sleep, you can still find beauty and meaning even in standing outside, barefoot in the slush, for 20 minutes. At the very least, you can laugh at your more unfortunate dormmate who was in the middle of a nice hot shower when those clueless freshmen fatally misman­
aged the microwave. . 
But autumn, in which the setting off of the fire alarm would be admittedly much less dire (I'm told it's unseasonably warm in South Bend this year), deserves acknowledgement as a turning point as well as a season. It's the beginning of the school year, and it's the end of summer. Enjoy it for what it is, but don't forget what it all means. 
For many, it means enjoying football season, the thrill of experiencing either disgrace or glory on a weekly basis. Ditto the spirited roar of the pep rally or vol­untary lack thereof. You live in the midst of a legendary heritage; by all means continue to carry it on. 
Though you've carried through September already, and now September has flown there's another aspect of fall to enjoy, and reflect on. 
This is, after all, October. Halloween looms before us. 
*** 

I think the aura of Halloween makes October a time of purgation. When I was little October was a time to get ridicu­lously excited about wearing costumes and getting seared: much later, when I got involved with the haunted attraction business, it was a time to get ridiculously excited about wearing costumers and scaring other people. And of course there's more to Halloween, and the sur­rounding season, than that: The cool dark neighborhood streets made unrec­ognizable by decorations, the sudden influx of free Reese's cups, the helping little fairies and Buzz Lightyears throw­ing beanbags in the church gathering hall, the sitting in Spanish class imagin­ing what food I'd bring to a picnic at my great-grandmother's gravesite, etc,. 
That these things, as well as your own images of October (and early November, if you're fortunate enough to have actu­ally attended family picnics at your great-grandmother's gravesite) should be cathartic is hardly unsurprising. 
Halloween did originate as the day the 
living paid tribute to the dead; now the 
customs of this time of year allow us to 
explore our own mortality. 

So this October, keep exploring. Dress up. Hang cobwebs and lights around your door. Dance. Drink (sensibly, and preferably something interesting). Eat Reese's cups, Smarties, pumpkin pie and caramel apples (we don't have thes1~ things in Dublin). and provide a large selection of the best goodies for triek-or­treaters. Find a party to volunteer at. Brave the Niles' Scream Park. Treat yourself to laughter, creativity, adnma­line, hangovers, smiles, joy. Whether you're watching a kid's face light up as you drop a Twix into their plastic pump­kin bucket or refurbishing a strictly­functional funetion room with black and orange erepe paper or facing death in the form of the ehainsaw-wielding zom­bie who's just jumped onto your hay wagon, cherish that moment as one that proves your physical, fallible, soul-grant­ed humanity. 
Next month, you may be grateful you're alive and blessed: the month after, you may celebrate that life and blessing run higher and deeper than we can, while on Earth, understand. But now, October, the middle of fall, is the time to really feel what being alive means. 
It's the time to remember those who've gone before us, both the people and the summers, and to enjoy and anticipate the time, the loved ones, and the life we have now and will have a while longer. 
January's not far away. Look up. The leaves are blazing now.

Environment, image and Notre Dame 
Notre Dame has entered a new era of environmental stewardship, signaled by a new Office of Sustainability, the recent Forum on that topic and a serious recy­cling program energized by student par­ticipation. Efforts to recycle wastes, to

ment are commend­able and should be continued. But such efforts are quantita­tive (how many pounds recycled?) rather than qualitative, and are already com­monplace among Notre Dame's peer institutions. To assume a position of environmental leadership, Notre Dame will have to make qualitative changes as well. A few suggestions follow. 


Policy and planning 
Power Generation -During the 1990s, as reported in the most recent Scholastic (Sept. 18), Notre Dame's coal-burning power plant was in violation of the Clean Air Act, resulting in a large fme by the EPA. Rather than rest content that no fines have been levied since then, the University should seriously consider shifting to less polluting forms of energy. Reliance on clean energy might involve extra expense initially but certainly would reduce Notre Dame's ecological footprint. 
Ecological Footprint -The concept of carbon footprint is now established in public awareness. But carbon emissions are not the only burden the University places on our beleaguered environment. Others are the ozone-depleting halogens released in manufacturing the hundreds of computers we buy annually, toxic chemicals applied by factory farms pro­viding food for our dining halls and non­biodegradable plastics used in many aspects of campus life. These all con­tribute to the University's total ecological footprint. An environmentally alert insti­tution would strive to keep a complete tally of its ecological footprint and would take ser:ious steps to keep it at a mini­

mum. fr,., Avoiding Need to Recycle -A better policy than simply recycling is one of avoiding materials that require recy­cling. A few examples of things to avoid are glossy reports issued by centers and institutions, single-use manila envelopes containing routine notices, and vending machines selling things in plastic bottles. The University's goal in this regard should be to recycle as little as possible while at the same time recycling every­thing that needs it. 

Instruction 
Course Offerings -All undergraduates at ND should have opportunity to take a full-credit course exploring humankind's tenuous relation to the rest of the bios­phere. For students in some disciplines, such a course should be required. One possibility is to make environmental instruction part of a mandatory Freshman Seminar. The format of such an offering should be broad enough to be taught through any department that chooses to participate. 
Learning by Doing-Notre Dame stu­dents learn about social issues by partic­ipating in programs sponsored by the Center for Social Concerns. The University should consider establishing a similar center to help students learn about environmental issues. Such a cen­ter could set up cooperative arrange­ments with near-by organic farms, could arrange internships with state and fed­eral environmental agencies, and could train students to provide assistance to businesses concerned with their ecologi­cal footprints. 
A Demonstration Ecosystem -In most learning situations, doing and observing go hand-in-hand. Before its property is all taken up by buildings, the University should set aside 20-30 acres on which to enable a self-sufficient ecosystem (an "ecopark") of native woodlands, mead­ows, and wetlands. Once established, this demonstration ecosystem would be kept mostly free from human manage­ment. While the area would be available for field trips by appropriate groups, its main purpose would be to provide stu­dents a place to "commune with nature" and thereby to learn more about how nature works. 

Student Life 
Consuming Less -Consuming less water and electricity in dorms is a good beginning. A good continuation would be to reduce dependency on environmental­ly damaging consumer items like red meat and bottled drinks. A side benefit is 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 


Stop generalizations 
As a 2001 alum, it was good to see Darryl Campbell's column appear in The Observer ("Community building, common-council style," Oct. 13) in response to the article from Oct 10's article titles "University addresses community relations." 
It's pretty clear that the community relations between Notre Dame students and South Bend need a sweeping overhaul, but it's likely not going to get anywhere until the council mem­bers and community leaders understand how their stances comprise of unjust, sweeping gen­eralizations. 
It's funny. I think the article on Oct. 10 was meant to "educate" students about how poor their judgement is and unless they start acting differently then nothing will improve. The arti­cle probably did more harm than good and the leaders of South Bend might need to take a look in the mirror. 

Back in the winter of 2000-2001, a friend of mine who was visiting from another school referred to South Bend as "Russia" in reference to the cold weather. Sounds like nowadays, a statement like that has more than one meaning. Just wanted to say thanks for running Mr. Campbell's article sticking up for the students. 
Patrick Schaffier alum Class of 200 I Oct. 13 
Speak out against stipend 
As the proud parent of two Saint Mary's stu­dents, I am appalled at the stipend issue that has arisen and the subsequent delay in stu­dent activities funding as a result. 
This issue should not be holding student activities hostage by insisting that they receive a stipend in the budget. 
To the nine students that voted no: Congratulations for standing up for your beliefs in the face of tremendous pressure. 
To the Executive Board: The issue is not how much of a stipend you should receive. Rather, the question is should you receive a stipend at all? This flies in the face of a proud and honorable tradition at Saint Mary's. 
The only way this should be implemented is with a referendum type vote and if your stu­dent body agrees with the action, then fine. To the argument that other schools do this, since when does Saint Mary's want to be like every other school? 
Last I read, the ad campaign says "She's Saint Mary's" and the "She" represents every student who attends this outstanding college. The campaign does not proudly proclaim "We're Like Every Other School You Will Visit". 

You have been given the privilege of repre­senting the student body and should be voting on a budget that is for the greater good. Not for a select few of you to receive money in a vote that only you can cast. This issue calls for thoughtful discussion and input from every corner of campus. 
To Saint Mary's students: Last year's outra­geous aberration is a call for more vigilance in watching your representative's actions. Indeed, a prime example of why we should all pay attention to government action at every level. 
Please make your voice heard prior to the upcoming meeting and contact your student representatives with your feelings on this issue. Make your voice heard. 
To Saint Mary's parents: Please support our student groups in any way possible; so that events are able to continue if they do not receive funding in a timely manner due to this issue. The Saint Mary's spirit will prevail. 
Thank you,

that cutting back on beef and giving up soda pop is good for one's health. Other consumer items that could be cut back include fashionable clothing (e.g. The Shirt) and video games. 
Living without Cars-Few modern conveniences contribute more to a heavy ecological footprint than private automo­biles. On a truly green campus, people would limit use of cars to occasions of genuine need. Walking, riding bicycles and taking buses are adequate for most purposes. Notre Dame students should take pride in cutting reliance on automo­biles to a bare minimum. 
Life-style changes-To help Notre Dame gain preeminence in environmen­tal stewardship, its student body will have to go beyond recycling and turning off light switches-beyond even avoid­ing red meat and foreswearing soda pop. Concerned students will wal!lt to adopt life-styles devoted to "walking lightly on the earth." This includes living simply (minimum use of devices run by motors), reducing material needs (fewer trips to the mall) and becoming more aware of other creatures (listening to birds rather than ipods). With examples like these in its midst, the University could learn from its students and assume leadership in its witness of environmental values.

More reasons not to vote 
Sure, I watched the debate last week, and I was taken aback for the 20 seconds where I heard one of them start to answer the question they were given. The only reason I watched the debate is so that Saturday Night Live is funny. 
The point is: When will politicians start answering questions? Why is a bail out needed? Here is my attempt: because without the bail out, credit is hard to come by which is necessary for businesses to do a lot of their busi­ness and some times all of it. Therefore, if they can't get a loan, then they can't do business, then some people are going to lose their jobs. I think that's pretty accurate, and yet, I only heard part ofthat answer in the debate. When I ask a question, and you answer a different question, you're telling me that my question was stupid, and I'm not smart enough to know what to focus on. So as I see it, these two politicians are telling me that I'm an idiot. If I'm asking the question, it is because I expect an answer. So what can you do about it? I don't know, but I can tell you what I'm going to do about it. 
I'm not voting this year just like four years ago. I'm not voting until politi­cians stop answering questions I didn't ask. I'm not encouraging anyone else not to vote, and I was about to vote in this election. I was told it was important, and I was going to vote for a third party even though I know that's basically wasting my vote. I'm enslaved to one of two parties who are mostly the same. 
As Lewis Black says, you have the republicans on one side who say, "We have a really bad idea", and the democrats on the other side who say, "And we can make it worse!" Thank God for George Carlin on voting: "You may have noticed that there's one thing I don't complain about: Politicians. Everybody complains about politicians. Everybody says, 'They suck.' 
But where do people think these politicians come from? They don't fall out of the sky. They don't pass through a membrane from another reality. No, they come from American homes, American families, American schools, American churches, American businesses and they're elected by American voters. This is the best we can do, folks. It's what our system produces: Garbage in, garbage out. .... 
I have solved this political dilemma in a very direct way: I don't vote. On Election Day, I stay home. I firmly believe that ifyou vote, you have no right to complain. Now, some people like to twist that around. They say, "Ifyou don't vote, you have no right to complain," but where's the logic in that? If you vote, and you elect dishonest, incompetent politicians, and they get into office and screw everything up, you are responsible for what they have done. You voted them in. You caused the problem. You have no right to complain. 
I, on the other hand, who did not vote -who did not even leave the house on Election Day-am in no way responsible for that these politicians have done and have every right to complain about the mess that you created.

NCAA FooTBALL 
Tressel, tea111 at odds about quarterbacks 
Associated Press 
COLUMBUS -Ohio State 

coach Jim Tressel has no 
doubt Terrelle Pryor is the 
best quarterback to lead the 
Buckeyes. 
Not all his players agree. 

Tight end Jake Ballard said it could help the Buckeyes' struggling offense to turn back to former starter Todd Boeckman and have him share the job with Pryor. The freshman has shown flashes of skill, but is still a work in progress. 
"The senior leadership that Todd brings to the table and just how he commands the huddle would definitely help us out." Ballard said. "And he could make some big throws for us.... I don't think a two­quarterback system would be a bad idea." 
No. 12 Ohio State (6-1, 3-0 Big Ten) will be facing one of its biggest tests of the season Saturday when it plays at No. 20 Michigan State. 
The Buckeyes are last in the Rig Ten in passing and next to last in total offense. 
But Tressel clearly is com­mitted to Pryor going it alone, though he said Tuesday he wants to play Boeckman. The senior has not played either of the last two games, both Ohio State victories. 
"(I) haven't determined that that was the right moment (or) situation," Tressel said tersely. 
Boeckman led Ohio State to a Big Ten title and a spot in the BCS national champi­onship game last season. This season, he had the job for three games before Pryor, who was playing high school ball in Jeannette, Pa., a year ago, was promoted. 
Boeckman said the transi­tion has been painful but he's tried to make the best of it. 
"When you're on the side­lines, you always want to play," Boeckman said. "You always want to be that guy out there. Terrelle is doing some good things out there. lin's getting better each and nvnry week. I'm doing what I ean. If my number's ever called, I'm going to be there, nmdy to go." 
The Buckeyes have won all four of Pryor's starts, but the offense has sputtered. Pryor is only permitted to speak with reporters after games and not during weekly inter­vinw periods. 
A unit that returned nine starters stands 94th in total offense in major college foot-

CLASSIFIEDS 
ball, including 108th in pass­ing. 
"If an apology is what you'd like, we can all go to lunch," Tressel cracked. "I apologize. And we'll try to get better." 
But at the same time, he knows it's no laughing mat­ter. The Buckeyes have totaled 18 touchdowns in their first seven games; a year ago at this point, they had 31. 
Buckeyes fans on radio call­in shows and Web sites are calling the offense unimagi­native and predictable. Several Southern California players said they knew what the Buckeyes were going to do on almost every snap after USC pounded Ohio State 35-3 in Boeckman's last start. 
Even Tressel seemed to question his own approach on Tuesday. 
"You always have to start by being troubled by the plan, because there's got to be some reasons why you're not executing," he said. 
A porous offensive line might be Ohio State's biggest problem. The Buckeyes are 106th in the nation in sacks allowed. 
Tressel has taken an increasing interest in the line in recent weeks, even dub­bing himself the "assistant offensive line coach." Usually reserved on and off the field, Tressel has strained his voice yelling at the linemen to be quicker and hold their blocks longer. 
But the sacks aren't all the lines' fault. 
Pryor is dangerous runner -able to dodge or outrun onrushing defenders. Yet he sometimes doesn't know when to throw a ball away to avoid trouble. He was sacked three times on Saturday in a 16-3 victory over Purdue, a game in which the Buckeyes' 
didn't  score  an  offensive  
touchdown.  
"lie  can  make  big plays  

with his feet but he has to realize it's not high school, he can't make big plays every single time for 20 yards or more," Ballard said. "He's not always going to get big plays." 
He said the Buckeyes can­not continue playing the way they have been. 
"It's frustrating. Everybody thinks it's frustrating," he said. "But we're not worried about it as much as maybe others are because we know it's things that we can change, to turn around the way the season is going right now."

Stairs is Phillies' ironman 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -One day 
after hitting the most signifi­
cant home run of his career, 
Matt Stairs went about his 
business as though nothing 
ever happened -which 
helps explain why he's still 
around at age 40 after 12 
full seasons in the big 
leagues. 
No huge celebrations for the pinch-hit homer Monday night that broke an eighth­inning tie and sent the Philadelphia Phillies over Los Angeles 7-5 for a 3-1 lead in the NL championship series. 
Instead, he stood in the outfield at Dodger Stadium during an off-day workout and shagged fly balls and joked with teammates. He also tried to answer the 40 messages on his cell phone, including a few from guys he coached in hockey back in Maine. 
"I enjoyed it last night when I left the ballpark. My wife and two of my daugh­ters are here, so it was fun to talk to them about it. But my point of view, it was over with," Stairs said. 
"I mean, we didn't turn on SportsCenter, I didn't read any newspapers -nothing. It happened yesterday," he said. "That's what I've always learned. You can't live in the past." 
A lesson well learned in a career that's taken him to 11 different major league teams, starting with the Montreal Expos in 1992. He got this chance with the Phillies because of a trade Aug. 30 with Toronto for a player to be named. 
Some of his former Blue Jays teammates called to congratulate the Canadian­born Stairs. The shot off hard-throwing Jonathan Broxton was Stairs' 15th career pinch-hit homer. 
Stairs launched it from the same batter's box where one of the most famous pinch-hit homers ever was hit, Kirk Gibson's shot in the 1988 World Series. Stairs' homer came two days before the 20th anniversary of Gibson's drive. 
Yet the compact slugger with the powerful left-hand­ed swing tried to stay hum­ble. He has 254 regular-sea­son homers in the big leagues -and now one in the postseason. 
"Even the year I hit 38 homers (with Oakland in 1999), I didn't think about what I did," Stairs said. "This game can bite you in the butt. You can have a great day yesterday and all of a sudden go 0-for-20." 
Dodgers manager Joe Torre was well aware that Stairs was a dangerous threat off the bench because of all the years he managed against him in the American League. Stairs twice had more than 100 RBis in a sea­son and even drew some MVP votes. 
"He's one of those guys who has made his presence necessary," Torre said. "He has done a great job accept­ing whatever role is given to him. He knows he can hit. The biggest thing for me is he has a plan at the plate." 
Stairs has a unique hitting approach. He swings for the fences every time up. Most players will tell you that they can't hit a home run if they try for one. 
"Certain people for certain swings," Stairs said. "I swing as hard as I can. My goal when I get into the batter's box is to see how far I can hit the ball. I'm not going to lie. I try to hit home runs. It carries over from batting practice I try to hit every ball out of the ballpark." 
An outfielder, first base­man and DH most his career, he accepted his role as a bench player for the Phillies. 
"I was excited when they told me I was going to Philly," Stairs said. "It was a great team and it was head­ing in the right direction. I knew I was coming to an organization that needed a pinch-hitter. 
"When you come to a new team, you want to do some­thing big to fit in real nice. You want to contribute as 


much as possible. And I think last night was a good way to jump into the fire. That home run really helped us, so you feel like part of the team. But by no means did I feel like an outsider here before that." 
Asked why he's ended up with so many teams after others cut him loose, he just shrugged and pointed out that the other 10 teams did­n't want him anymore. 
"I think I bring a positive attitude," he said. "Nothing negative comes out of my mouth. I enjoy the game. I enjoy being here early and talking to guys about hitting and give them my point of view. This is the way I approach the game and play the game-to always have a smile on my face and not let things bother me." 
This is Stairs' third trip to the postseason and his first to the LCS. lie was with the Boston Red Sox in 1995 when they lost to Cleveland, and played for Athletics in 2000 when they were elimi­nated by the Yankees. 
Once he's done playing, Stairs wants to stay in the game as a manager or hit­ting coach. Phillies manager Charlie Manuel thinks it'll be an easy transition. 
"I think he's definitely got the qualifications and the resume," Manuel said. "He's been in the game a long time, he's got a lot of experi­ence and he's been a lot of places. so I'm sure he's got a lot of stories to tell." 
"lie's got a baseball eye, and if you talk to him, you can tell how much he loves the game," he said.

Associated Press 
DETROIT -The winless Detroit Lions placed quar­terback Jon· Kitna on injured reserve Tuesday, ending his season. 
The move could raise questions about Kitna's future in Detroit. 
There had been specu­lation the Lions (0-5) might trade Kitna and rely instead on backups Dan Orlovsky and Drew Stanton. But a trade didn't materialize. Instead, the Lions sent wide receiver Roy Williams to Dallas for draft picks. 
Kitna suffered a back injury in a loss to Chicago two weeks ago. He did not play last week against Minnesota. 
Orlovsky played in Kitna's place against the Vikings. He likely will make his second career start at Houston on Sunday. 
Kitna declined comment Tuesday, but had told The Associated Press on Monday he expected to play again this season and that his injury wasn't that serious. Also on Monday, Coach Rod Marinelli wouldn't answer ques­tions about Kitna's health. 
"After extensive exami­nation and consultation with the team medical staff, it became clear that placing Jon on injured reserve was the right decision," Lions general manager Martin Mayhew said in a statement. "Jon and I met today and dis­cussed moving forward with respect to his reha­bilitation which will be done in coordination with our medical staff." 
The Lions said Kitna's injury represents "an acute exacerbation of a chronic condition." 
Kitna had 758 yards passing this season with five touchdown passes and five interceptions before back spasms side­lined him against Chicago on Oct. 5. 
Kitna had started 36 straight games until 

Orlovsky played in Sunday's 12-10 loss at Minnesota. 
Orlovsky was 12-of-21 for 150 yards and a score. The fifth-round pick from Connecticut in 2005 also rolled out of the end zone for a safety. 
Stanton has not played in the regular season as a pro. 
Kitna had an MRI last week and was evaluated by a specialist, but had declined comment on his health. 
Kitna had 4,000-plus yards passing in each of the past two seasons in Detroit and combined to throw 39 TDs and 42 interceptions. 
IN BRIEF Ward fined $15,000 in 
last two weeks 
PITTSBURGH -The Pittsburgh Steelers are asking the NFL to clari­fy why Hines Ward, one of the league's best-blocking wide receivers, was fined $15,000 the past two games for unnecessary ~oughness despite not being penal· tzed. 
Ward was fined $10,000 following the Steelers' 26-21 win at Jacksonville on Oct. 5, a week after drawing a $5,000 fme for a play in which he stepped over Baltimore cornerback Corey Ivy on Sept. 29. Ward did not draw a penalty on either play. 
Also following the Jacksonville game, Steelers linebacker James Harrison was fined $20,000 for crit­icizing referee Brian Winter for calling a roughing-the-passer penalty against him. Two other Steelers also drew fines for that game, safety Ryan Clark $7,500 for unnecessary roughness -a late hit -and wide receiver Nate Washington $7,500 for taunting. Among the four players, the one­game fines totaled $45,000.

Sebastian Telfair was suspended on 
Tuesday for three games after

The Celtics traded him to Minnesota in the deal for Kevin Garnett, and Telfair had a solid and incident-free first season in Minnesota. He signed a three-year,$7.5 million deal this summer to remain with the Timberwolves. He

'Tve talked to Sebastian about the incident.

"Since he has been a member of the Timberwolves, Sebastian has been a great teammate and has been actively involved in the community." 
Gonzalez stays in KC as 
trade deadline pas:ses
KANSAS CITY, l\fo. --Tony Gonzalez is staying with the Chiefs. 
Just minutes after the 4 p.m. EDT trade deadline Tuesday, Kansas City coach Herm Edwards said no deal had been struck for the nine-time Pro Bowler. His announcement ended 10 days of tension for the player and his fans in Kansas City, most of whom were boring he would get what he wantec and be traded to a contender. 
Gonzalez, 32, asked the Chiefs to explore trade possibilities after deciding the rebuilding Chiefs (1-4) would probably not reach champi­onship caliber before time ran out on his career. 
Neither Gonzalez nor Chiefs presi­dent Carl Peterson was avaiilable for comment. Edwards said he did not know how close Peterson came to reaching an agreement with any­one. Arizona, Buffalo and Philadelphia had all expressed interest. Peterson had indicated he would not let Gonzalez, who has been the face of the struggling fran­chise, go cheaply.

Eli suffers bruised chest 
Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.­The New York Giants left Cleveland battered, and with a bruised quarterback. 
Eli Manning bruised his chest in the Giants' embar­rassing 35-14 loss to the Browns, and coach Tom Coughlin was not certain about the extent of the injury although he gave indications that the Super Bowl MVP would practice for this week­end's game against the San Francisco 49ers. 
"I'm not going to know until I hear some things," Coughlin said Tuesday. "From time to time, obviously for anybody who plays that position, you're going to have some things that don't allow you to perform at your best. Injuries do occur. I don't know whether this is (a serious injury) or not. 
"Eli has played very well with soreness and that type of thing," Coughlin said. ''I'm sure that will be something he'll go ahead and practice and play with, but we'll see. I don't have a lot of information now." 
Coughlin said he thought sprained his shoulder in a season-opening loss to Dallas last year and did not miss a game. 
Coughlin didn't know if the injury contributed to Manning three interceptions, including Eric Wright's game-clinching 94-yard touchdown return in the fourth quarter. 
"I can't tell you it wasn't," Coughlin said. "He is certainly very good at masking all of that." 
Coughlin said that on Wright's touchdown, Manning was under pressure and there was a timing issue. On the other two picks, Coughlin said the Giants ( 4-1) had chances, but the Browns made the plays. 
Coughlin was frank in say­ing that the Giants were thor­oughly outplayed in the game that ended their 11-game road winning streak -12 if you count the Super Bowl -come to an end. 
"Any time where you have a game where you don't stop the run and then you turn the ball over on the other side of the ball, you are not going to have much of a chance to win and that's

Manning, who threw three interceptions in the Giants first loss in eight games dating to last season, did not miss a play in the game. He com­plained of chest pain after the game ended, Coughlin said. 
Manning received treatment and underwent further exami­nation at Giants Stadium on Tuesday. However, players were not available for com­ment.

we didn't do any of those." 
Coughlin said the Giants also didn't use good technique, had mental errors and were not physical against a team that played very well with two weeks preparation. 
"It was a disappointing game, disappointing loss, and the film certainly does not change your opinion from last night," Coughlin said. 
One concern was the per­formance of the defense, which came into the game giv­ing up an average of 236 yards. 
The Browns gained 278 yards in the first half and fin­ished with 454 yards in total offense. Cleveland converted on 9 of 13 third-down chances. Even more troubling, the front seven barely touched quarterback Derek Anderson all night. 
"I really don't think for the last two weeks we have had much pressure on the quar­terback," Coughlin said. "I think there has to be a lot of self-analysis there in terms of not only how we are going about our business but exactly who is doing what. I think we need to look hard at that and we are talking about that." 
Coming off a very impressive win over Seattle the week before, the Giants went to Cleveland knowing that the Browns (2-3) would be des­perate. 
The Browns played that way. Coughlin was disappoint­ed the Giants did not match the intensity. 
"This team will bounce back. I believe that," Coughlin said. "I think it will be a good week of focus and a good week of practice. It is disap­pointing to fall into whatever lapse we fell into in not play­ing as well as we have been playing." 
Three other Giants also were injured in the game. Weakside linebacker Gerris Wilkinson had a mild knee sprain. His status is uncertain. Safety James Butler aggravat­ed a biceps injury and middle linebacker Antonio Pierce aggravated a quad that he hurt last week. 
Center Shaun O'Hara was treated at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York for an infected toe on Tuesday. 
Receiver David Tyree, who made the key catch off the top of his helmet in the Super Bowl win over the Patriots, has recovered from knee injury and was activated off the physically unable to per­form list. He will practice this week. The team has three weeks to decide whether to place him on the active roster, put him on injured reserve or cut him.

Covvboys receive -wR Williams in Lions trade 
Associated Press 
IRVING, Texas Roy Williams headed home to Texas on Tuesday in the NFL's biggest trade before the dead­line, giving the struggling Dallas Cowboys another proven receiver opposite Terrell Owens. 
The winless Detroit Lions traded their unhappy 2004 first-round pick and one-time Pro Bowler for three draft picks, from the first, third and sixth round in 2009. Detroit also gave the Cowboys a sev­enth-rounder next year. 
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said he struck the deal two minutes before the NFL trade deadline. 
"I'm more happy to be a Dallas Cowboy then when I got my first bike," said Williams, an Odessa native who starred at the University of Texas. 
Williams' best season was 2006, when he went to the Pro Bowl after catching 82 passes for 1,310 yards and seven touchdowns. He has 17 catches for 232 yards and a score this season, and has 262 career passes for 3,884 yards and 29 TDs. 
"We felt like right now that was the best thing for us to do as a football team. It gives us something for the future. You're looking at the possibili­ty of having five of the first hundred (2009) picks," Lions general manager Martin Mayhew said. "It was a prag­matic business decision." 
Soon after announcing the deal, the Cowboys4 said that they had given Williams a five­year extension on his contract that was set to expire after this season. 
The Cowboys acquired their new star hours after learning they lost another in corner­back Adam "Pacman" Jones, whom NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Tuesday for at least four games. 
Goodell will determine the full length of the suspension

following the Cowboys' game in Washington on Nov. 16. Jones was in repeated legal trouble while with the Tennessee Titans and was involved in an alcohol-related scuffle Oct. 7 with one of his bodyguards at a private party in Dallas. 
Jerry Jones, who has never shied from adding pllayers with checkered pasts to the Cowboys locker room, made a point Tuesday to mention Williams' "outstanding charac­ter, no matter who you talk to." 
Williams said the :first phone call he received after the trade was from Owens, who has complained recently about not getting enough catehes in an offense that lost quarterback Tony Romo this week for per­haps a month with a broken finger in his throwing hand. 
Jerry Jones said Owens was "elated and beside himself" upon hearing the trade. Williams said he and T.O. talked about winning. 
"We got two guys out there that can really run, they're big, but as you know, both of them can really make spectacular catches," Jones said. 
Williams is expected to begin practicing with the Cowboys on Wednesday, and play in their game Sunday at St. Louis. 
Williams will line up opposite Owens in an offense that has not had a clear No. 2 receiver since waiving veteran Terry Glenn this summer. Tight end Jason Witten leads the Cowboys with 39 catches and two touchdowns after six games. Owens has :23 catches and 5 TDs. 
The Cowboys have filled the gap with Patrick Crayton and Miles Austin. Now they will have two of the NFL's biggest, most physical receivers -both worthy of double coverage. 
After the trade, Williams talked as if he had found a new mentor in Owens, whom he made clear was "the No. 1 
guy." 

"I've never had an older wide receiver to sh1)w me the 
way," Williams said. 
Jerry Jones said Tuesday he said he'd been trying to pry Williams from Detroit for two years. 
The addition figures to fur­ther heighten Super Bowl expectations for the Cowboys (4-2), who are only a game behind the New York Giants in the NFC East but have dropped two of their last three games. 
Sunday's overtime loss to Arizona was particularly costly for Dallas. Romo broke his pinky finger and rookie run­ning back Felix Jones sprained a hamstring to end a trying week that began with contro­versy over Adam Jones' run-in with police. 
Williams will probably catch his first passes in Dallas from Brad Johnson, the 40-year-old backup whose last start was in 2006 for Minnesota. 
The 26-year-old Williams said it was tough to leave Detroit but said he was ready "to see what the playoffs feel like." Detroit was 21-48 since Williams arrived as a rookie and never made the postsea­son. 
"Going from 0-5 to 4-2, you can't ask for anything better than that," Williams said.

Red Sox lose reigning World Series MVP 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -Mike Lowell will undergo surgery on his right hip Monday, depriving the Hcd Sox of last year's World Series MVP for the rest of their season. 
The third baseman, who is not on Boston's roster for the AL championship series, chose to have the surgery as soon as possible so he would have a good chanee to be ready for the start of spring training. 
''I'm kind of relieved, in a snnse, just to get it over," l.ownll said in the dugout Tuesday. "I think I was hang­ing onto something that was­n't really rnalistie." 
l.ownll was removed from the playoff rostnr after Game 3 of the first-round series against Los Angeles, making him innligible for the ALCS. Tho Hnd Sox beat tho Angels three games to one to advancn. 
Boston enternd Tuesday night's gamP against Tampa Bay trailing 2-1 in thn best­of-seven ALCS. 
Lowell said his hip started bothering him a fnw weeks bnforn the All-Star brnak. lie 
was  limited  to  one  at-bat in  
the last  ll  regular-season  
games and  went 0-for-8 in  

two postseason games. 
lin dncidPd late last wePk to have the surgery. It will be done in New York. 
General manager Theo Epstein told Lowell "there was probably a 99 pereent chance I was not on the ros­ter" if the Hed Sox get to the World Series, Lowell said before Game 4 against the Hays. 
"I don't think we can bank on that one percent and !just didn't want to drag it out and then see if it affpcts the later 
part of spring training or even April of next year," he said. 
The arthroscopic surgery involves repairing a torn labrum in the hip and a bone spur on the femur as well as checking and possibly fixing a muscle. 
"There's no way he was going to be able to play" this year, manager Terry Francona said. "Any addi­tional time that he can have now so he ean come to spring training, he really wanted, and l don't blame him." 
Doctors have told Lowell 
that's realistic. 
"They've told me they've cleared NFL players for full contact after four months" following similar surgery, he said. "So I guess I'm banking on that." 
Lowell had two stints on the disabled list this year and played in just 112 games. He had a sprained lefi thumb and a strained left side mus­cle along with the hip injury. 
"[ was very happy with two months, May and June," he said. "Obviously, disappoint­ed in April because I got hurt early and it was just really a struggle, I'd say, the last three months." 
In last year's World Series sweep over the Colorado Hockies, Lowell was 6-for-15 with four HB!s. And in the last two games he went 4-for­9 with a solo homer in the seventh inning of the finale that gave Boston a 3-0 lead in the clinehing 4-3 victory. 
Lowell said he expected to be released from the hospital Tuesday and spend the next two weeks on crutches. 
''I'd love to be in the dugout here (for) Game 1 of the World Series," he said. "That would be good, as long as no foul balls come in."

Saturday, November 8, 2008 9:00am-5:15pm, followed by dinner 
Sponsored by the Institute for Church Life 
What is a "Day of Recollection?" Itis an opportunity to set some time aside for God. 
We are all busy! Sometimes in the midst of all our activity, it is good to take an 
opportunity for some time apart, time for guided prayer and meditation, time with 
God and one another. The Day is structured around two "conferences" (biblically 
based reflections) offered by the retreat director, one morning and one afternoon. 
Each is followed by guided meditative and conversational response for the group, 
and opportunity for individual prayer and reflection afterward. The day will end 
with Mass and dinner. 

Who is invited? All faculty members interested in deepening their relationship with God. The retreat is in the living tradition of Catholic spirituality. It can be meaning­fully experienced from a variety of perspectives, including those with no previous exposure. The only requirement is commitment to the whole day's experience. 
For further information and to register: The Day of Recollection is a project of the Institute for Church Life, which assumes all costs. Simply email: cavadini.l®nd.edu. Deadline: Monday, Nov. 3, 2008.

"I want to give a lot of credit to Calvin on the game Saturday," Crabbe said. "They are certainly a very good team and it showed in their play why they are one of the top teams in the country." 
Part of the Belles' recent struggles can be attributed to mistakes early in matches.

son ended -what defense can we play that can help us do that -and I think that we haven't figured it out yet." 
The first step in figuring out her team's defense will be to decide what kind of personality her team will have, McGraw said. For much of last year, the Irish played their best defense when pressing opponents, but McGraw said she will give different types of defenses a look when prac­tices begin on Friday. 
"We really feel pretty good about that. The question is what type of zone do we want to play," she said. "We will work on our man-to­man, but I don't think we are going to be as aggres­sive man-to-man as we want to be. So we're going to have to mix it up and keep the [other] team off-bal­ance." 
One thing that should help McGraw's team in develop­ing a zone is the new crop of freshmen -guards Fraderica Miller and Natalie Novosel and forwards Erica Solomon and Kellie Watson. 
Solomon and Watson will add length to the Irish defense as both are 6-foot­

game. Especially with a team like Calvin, we cannot allow ourselves to make their job any easier. Our biggest strug­gles have come from creating quality scoring opportunities. Being behind early in games is certainly not helping that." 
Crabbe has made several midseason changes to the line­up that he said will help cor­rect some of the problems that have plagued the Belles all season. 
"We have looked at some changes in our lineup recently to try and better utilize some personnel," he said. "I think working through some of these changes will hopefully spark us on the field. We gave some of 
height will make it a lot eas­ier for her team to defend. 
"It's amazing how big we can be in the back line. That really says to me that if we can get a good zone, it's going to be hard to throw the ball over us," she said. 
Solomon, who echoed McGraw's need to defend against 3-pointers, said she hopes to be strong on the boards for the Irish this season, but that she also has a team-first outlook for the season. 
"I'm comfortable on defense. Whatever coach needs me to do, defense­wise, whether it's guarding the guards on the perimeter or guarding the post, what­ever she needs me to do, I'm going to do it," she said. 
One major change in Notre Dame's defense from the end of last season will look familiar. Sophomore forward Devereaux Peters was cleared for practice after tearing her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) on Feb. 10 in a win against Pittsburgh. When she went down, Peters was the Big East leader in blocked shots with 45, and averaged 5.6 rebounds and 9.0 points to go along with 39 steals. 
"[Peters] changes the game. When we lost her in the Pitt game, it changed our defense," McGraw said. "Our press wasn't as good. Our defense wasn't as good." 
McGraw said that, after watching Peters in training sessions, the sophomore

Looking ahead to Trine and the remaining matches on the schedule, Crabbe said he is

"I would like to see the team gen­erate and finish more opportu­nities on goal. That being said, we need to limit our mistakes and not allow teams to take an early advantage in games."

hasn't lost a step on the court, but may need to be patient before trying to go at full speed too quickly. 
Peters said she feels good, but is not quite where she wants to be. She said she thinks she will be back at 100 percent at some point during the season. 
She also said she is glad to have the added team height defensively. 
"I think it's great. It will be helpful with the taller, kind of skinny guards, because that's what we have now. And I think it will help a lot in the post, too. I think, as far as defense, we'll get a lot more steals and tips," she said. 
Junior Erica Williamson returns as the only true center on the Irish roster. The 6-foot-4 Williamson will often be the lone big man in McGraw's four-guard set, but only because Solomon and Watson will be playing on the perimeter. 
As the center, Williamson said she wants to be a strong presence under the basket, taking charges ­something she excelled at last season. 
"I definitely want to get back to taking charges because I really think that offsets the other team a lit­tle bit, a little scared to drive the lane," she said. "I just want to be a big pres­ence in the post and be there if something happens to the guards."

Associated Press 
BOSTON -They fluttered in and rocketed out: Three more homers sent sailing over the Green Monster to help the Tampa Bay Rays blow out Boston for the second straight game and move within one win of their first AL pennant. 
Evan Longoria hit his rookie­record fifth home run of the playoffs, and Carlos Pena and Willy Aybar also homered off aging knuckleballer Tim Wakefield on Tuesday night to give the Rays a 13-4 victory over the Red Sox that put the defending World Series champi­ons on the brink of elimination. 
Carl Crawford tied an AL championship series record with five hits and Andy Sonnanstine pitched 7 1-3 innings of six-hit ball as Tampa Bay took a 3-1 lead in the best­of-seven playoff. Aybar had four hits and fiye RBis. 
After an off day, James Shields and Game 1 winner Daisuke Matsuzaka are sched­uled to pitch Thursday night at Fenway Park in a potential clincher for the surprising Rays. 
"We've just got to go out there and play our game, not let up on them," Crawford said. "It would be nice to finish it here." 
Tampa Bay had never even approached a .500 record dur­ing its first decade in the majors before edging wild-card Boston for the AL East title by two games. But the Rays were poised and powerful against a Red Sox team that has made the playoffs in five of the last six years, advancing to the ALCS four times and winning it all twice. 
Facing the 42-year-old Wakefield, the oldest pitcher to start an ALCS game, the league's newest team homered three times in the first three innings to take a 5-0 lead. The Rays scored another in the frfth and blew it open with l.ive more in the sixth when seven straight batters reached base to make it 
11-1. 

"We wanted to be aggressive at the plate," Crawford said. "Guys are just focused right now." 
Fans lined up for the exits after the Red Sox went down 1­2-3 in the sixth -the third inning in a row they were retired in order; TV showed horror-master Stephen King reading a book in the stands, bored. 
On the fie.ld, it was twice as scary. 
One night after the Rays hit four homers to beat Boston 9-1, they hit three more and totaled 14 hits against five Red Sox pitchers. Wakefield, who was making his first appearance in 16 days, lasted just 2 2-3 innings, giving up five runs, including Longoria's fifth play­off homer to break the rookie record set by Florida's Miguel Cabrera in 2003. 
"Sitting through that wasn't a whole lot of fun," Hed Sox manager Terry Francona said. "We've been on the other side. When it happens to you, you've got to get through it the best you can, and we'll need to regroup as quickly as we can." 
Red Sox reliever Justin Masterson allowed another run; Manny Delcarmen gave up five more while getting just. one out; 42-year-old Mike Timlin gave up two more in the eighth. 
Meanwhile, Sonnanstine retired 12 consecutive batters in all after Kevin Cash's homer to lead off the third and make it 5-l. The Rays right··hander, who pitched 13 shutout innings against Boston in a pair of September no-decisions, allowed just two hits before David Ortiz's leadoff triple in the seventh. 
Ortiz, who had been hitless in his first 12 at-bats in the series, scored on a groundout to make it 11-2, and Boston chased Sonnanstine while adding two more in the eighth.

Usher finished in 73rd place, carding a 19-over 235. 
For Notre Dame, the sopho­more-led effort has been par for the course this season. The younger members of the Irish squad have posted strong scores throughout the season, leading the team in scoring several times so far. Kubinski said he has been happy with the way his underclassmen have stepped up and provided a lift when needed. 
less team," Kubinski said. "The sophomore class has four very talented players, for sure. None have a great deal of college experience, but our three sophomores are all capable of leading the way."

threes. This year, he said, the team wants to correet that imbalanee. 
"The girls have kind of taken it on themselves as a personal challenge to bn more ready and more consistent from the 3-point linn," Tsipis said. 
Head coach Muffet McGraw said lots of the players can step out on the perimeter and hit a shot, and she and Tsipis said two freshmen -guard Natalie Novosel and forward Kellie Watson -will contribute to the perimeter game. How many they make in the game depends on their work beforehand; the play­ers said their ability to hit 3­point shots depends on getting good practice. 
Novosel said she and the other freshmen come to the JACC at night to practice their shooting. A helpful device they call the "gun," a ball retriever that sends basketballs back to the shooter at varying speeds, allows the player to take a high volume of shots in a short amount of time. 
"It's really effective," Novosel said. 
The beauty of the gun, Novosel said, is it helps her work on her quick release, the biggest shift in the 3-point shot from high school to college. 
Watson agreed, saying the gun's variable speed helps her practice getting the shot off quicker. 
"If you don't get the shot up in time you'll get hit with it," she said. 
Novosel, a self-described night owl, said the machine also saves energy late at night. 
Junior guard Melissa Lechlitner said the gun allows her to take 300-400 shots in a 45-rninute period. For her, how­ever, she said taking shots in game situations and building confidence would foster improvement. 
"I didn't attempt many shots last season so I think that's going to be something you'll see more from me this year," she said. 
What the team needs, Lechlitner said, is the confidence bred from shooting during games. 
"We've got a lot of good shoot­ers coming in and I know the returning players have been working on our threes a lot more," Lechlitner said. "We still have the confidence to knock them down. We know we can hit them, it's just a matter of doing 

it... Sophomore guard Brittany Mallory said the 3-point shoot­ing game works in conjunction with the inside game. When the defense expects a drive to the lane, she said, the players can pull up and shoot a three. And should the defender come out to guard the three, the players can drive. "It goes hand in hand. We've been working on that a lot this year," Mallory said. "It opens up a little more inside because the help's not going to be there. It gets good looks for everybody else." Tsipis echoed Mallory's asser­
tion that the deep ball opens up the rest of the offense. 
"To just be out there and be a threat, be someone the defense knows is a 3-point shooter, I think that opens everything else up," he said. 
Notes: 
+Team doctors cleared sopho­more forward Devereaux Peters to play. Peters suffered a torn ACL in February. 
+Mallory will miss the team's opener at LSU as a punishment for her incident with law enforcement at an off-campus party. Mallory was one of 37 Notre Dame students, many of them athletes, arrested at a party on Sept. 22.

BASKETBALL MEDIA DAY 
Irish rnen look to build on solid season 
By FRAN TOLAN Associate Sports Editor 
Last season, the Irish won 26 games, induding 14 in Big East play. Their reward? 
Try one of the most grueling schedules in college basketball. In addition to the always-formi­dable Big East gauntlet, Notre Dame's slate includes an early­season trip to the prestigious Maui Invitational and non-con­ference tilts against Ohio State and UClA. 
"At times I've looked at [the schedule! during the summer and wondered what I was think­ing when we did all this," Irish coach Mike Brny said in his media day press conference Tuesday. " ... The thing that's crazy-in the midst of what the

Coach Mike Brey said over and over how excited he was about this year's team, but it seemed as though he was chomping at the bit, waiting for some­one to ask this one question during his 40-minute chat with the media Monday. 
It finally came about 35 minutes into the press con­ference.

Women's squad looks to improve perimeter shooting and 3-point defense

Notm Dame's 3-point shooting li~ll short last season. This sfm­son. the Irish have plans to make sure the long-range game comes bark on line. 
The Irish shot okay from behind the are in the regular s1mson -they hit 29.2 percent of their thnws. In the postsea­son, however, that number droppnd to 23.1 percent. In the limll game of the regular season against St. John's, a Big East tournanwnt game against Pittsburgh and a Sweet 16 game vs. Tennessee (all losses), Notre Dame hit only thnH~ 3-pointers. 
Assoeiate head coach Jonathan Tsipis said last year's problem with hitting 3s stmnmnd partially from the fact that the team had lots of shoot­ers that could hit midrange jump shots, but not necessarily

Last season, Notre Dame ranked sixth in the 16-team Big East in team defense, surrendering only 61.6 points per game. But the defense could hav1~ been even stronger if not for giv­ing up the third worst 3­point percentage in the con­ference, allowing opponents to shoot 35.5 percent against it. 
All last season, the 3-point defense was a point of emphasis for the Irish, and this season nothing has changed. 
"We are going to guard the 3-point line this year. We are determined to guard the 3­point line, Irish coach Muffet MeGraw said. "That is the one thing I think we have talked nonstop since the sea-

Belles attempt to end slump against Trine 
By ALEX BARKER 
Sporrs Writer 
As the final few games of the regular season approach, Saint Mary's is still searching for its first MIAA eonference win. The Belles (1-9-1 overall, 0-4 MIM) will get a promising opportunity to end the drought when they face Trine (3-11. 0-4) today at 4 p.m. 
Despite the team's disappoint­ing record so far this season, Belles coach Hyan Crabbe said he still sees a determined efl'ort and unwillingness to back down from his young team. 
"One thing I have bt~en most proud of with this team this season is the faet that they eon­tinue to show up every day and work hard to get better," he said. "Even with the frustration of our lack of results on the field in terms of wins, those players continue to eompete every time they are out on the field." 
The Belles are eurnmtly on a six-game losing streak, includ­ing last weekend's 4-0 home loss to No. 8 Calvin.
