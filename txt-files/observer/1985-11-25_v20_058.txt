Egyptian plane raid leaves 50 dead 
A.uocllted P~u 
VALLEITA, Malta · Egyptian com­mandos stormed a hijacked Egyptalr jetliner last night, and an explosion and gunfire during the assault ldlled a.'l many as ~0 people aboard the Boeing 737, a government spokes­man said. 
The jetliner is the same plane U.S. Navy jets Intercepted last month with the Achllle Lauro pirates on board. 
"There are about ~0 dead by bul­let or fire," spokesman Paul Mifsud told reporters two hours after the as­sault. 
Deputy U.S. Embassy Chief Joel Levy said there were three Americans aboard the Egyptair jet­liner and one was ldlled. He said at least two bodies, Including that ofan American, were thrown olfthe plane before the assault. Several wounded passengers, Including the two other Americans, also were tossed olf and I I women were allowed to leave before the commando charge. 
Mifsud said the hijackers hurled hand grenades at the passengers when they realized the plane was being stormed, and the resulting fire destroyed the Inside ofthe jetliner. 
The victims "were trapped inside 
and couldn't get out," he added. 
Malta's state-run television said 
about 80 people were on the jetliner 
when the commandos attacked. It 
said 28 wounded people were taken 
to hospitals. 
Mifsud said Prime Minister Car­
melo Mifsud Bonnici authorized the 
assault because "the situation was 
getting out ofhand." He added that it 
was totally an Egyptian operation. 
Mifsud quoted the pilot, Capt. Hani Galal, as saying the hijack leader was "a madman" who sang and danced each time he shot a hostage and tossed the body from the plane onto the tarmac. 
Galal earlier told authorities by 
radio that the hijackers had ldlled 
seven people. 
As the commandos stormed the 
plane, Galal killed the hijack leader 
with an ax, Mifsud said. 
The pilot, his head bandaged and his jacket and white shirt spotted with blood, told a news conference that the hijack leader singled out Americans and Israelis "for execu­.tlon." 
"It was "awful. ... But our only hope was the storming," Galal said. 
The assault troops ..were tacing first­class killers. They were desperate and would hot hestiate to blow up the plane." 
Galal, a pilot for I 5 years, said he fully agreed with the decision to storm the plane::. 
"I think the storming operation was very, very well conducted. But we were not lucky," Galal said, ad­ding "We are lucky to save about 26." 
"It's not a very happy ending at all," said Levy, two hours after the assault. 
Asked about Egyptian reports that no passengers were killed, he told The Associated Press: "that's not the case at all." 
Levy said he did not know what caused the explosion, but that it hap­pened after the commandos blew open the two doors. He called that "fairly standard procedure." 
The Inferno that followed killed "what we are estimating to be as many as 40 or 50 people." 
Levy told reporters the com­mandos attacked at 8:20 p.m. ( 2:20 
p.m. EST), about 24 hours after the jetliner en ' route from Athens, Greece, to Cairo, Egypt, was coman­deered and diverted to Malta.

Success should be recognized 
During one ofher first breaks at Notre Dame, a fresh­man found herself riding home with two seniors. The seniors, as is typical, began to reminisce about their col­lege careers. 
One, a double-major in English and engineering, spoke about her various interviews. She said she sometimes was embarassed about C's she'd received in classes she knew to be important, but hoped it wouldn't hurt her chances for employment. After all, everyone knows Notre Dame is a tough school. 
The other, a resident assistant soon to graduate high in his class in finance, spoke of his coming law school career. He also spoke ofyears he spent immersed in his books. 
The woman said she wished she'd spent more time studying instead ofpartying with her friends. Too often she'd pushed her books aside when enticed by promises offun. 
The man said just the opposite. He was certainly proud of his achievements, but he wished he'd spent more time relaxing, being

sharing can develop. Almost none ofus are organized or driven enough to do so. Although it may seem painfully obvious, no one can be the best at everything. 
And yet we are taught to be the best, to strive for perfection, to always aim high. We look at what we are and see that we are nowhere near the models ofperfec­tion we'd like to be. 
Thus we are forced to doom ourselves to failure ­we'll never be perfect -orredefine for ourselves what it

The conversation in the regr::ts. Your college career, 

car had little meaning for this all-too-confident fresh­man. But she remembered it. 

And today, three years later, she understands what these then old and wise seniors were saying. 
Few, if any of us, are completely satisfied with our college careers to date. The student with a 3.8 GPA will curse those two B's that kept him from a 3.9. The senior now facing employers with a 2.6 GPA may regret a few ofthe parties, or the hours spent working in hall govern­ment or at The Observer. The student graduatingwith a mediocre GPA and many irreplaceable friendships and memories will sometimes overlook hisother successes and consider only his academic failures. 
The engineer or business major may wish he or she had had more time to study liberal arts. The Arts and Letters major may wish he or she had chosen a more vocationally oriented major. 
Almost everyone would like to graduate with highest honors and spend time in some sport or activity, wit­hout giving.up the friendships that only time and no matter what you achieve, 
will n"t bt: an unblemished 
success. 

Yet success, even marked by many blemishes, remains success. One of the two se::niors received a lucrative job offer from a engineering firm in California. The other will graduate from law school this year. Both are, by their own standards, successful individuals. 
Sometimes, when the workload seems impossible, our A's have slipped out ofreach and finals are looming, it is all too easy to focus on our mistakes. It is easy to sit back and lament that we cannot possibly do everything we'd like to do as well as we'd like to do it. 
It is much more difficult to decide what is really im­portant to us and do our best to achieve that. It is much more difficult to pull ourselves out of mediocre perfor­mances and continue to give life our best effort. 
Yet this is what success really consists of. Not being the best at everything, but being good at something worthwhile. 
This is the lesson a starry-eyed freshman learned from two seniors. Now, three years later, she hopes it speaks to you.

He said a 3-year-old American child was among those released but could give no further details. 
The injured included 19 U.S. military personnel, II American civilians, a West German civilian and a Filipino, Swisher said. 
"For the other two who were treated here we still don't have any personal details," he said. The !den­titles of the injured were not released. 
"Many people just walked off and took themselves to the hospital," said a U.S. Army spokesman, Major Christopher Chalko. "Most ofthe in· juries seem to have been bruises and cuts from flying glass."

Raises questions about Hoffman's remarks at ND 
As the excitement dies down and as the crowds disperse, there are seeds of liberalism remaining after Abbie Hoffman's speech. While he was very entertaining, his facts and opinions appeared to this confused individual to be somewhat tainted. I say that I am confused to assure everyone that I ~m no ex­pert on international atfalrs, but I do1ind that subject immensely intriguing. It is my purpose here not to assault Hoffman's charac­ter but to raise a few questions which I did not get to ask after his speech. 
Brendan Daniels guest column 

It seems to me Hoffman supports im­mediate divestiture of all investments of the University from all corporations in South Africa. This would send a message to the government ofthat nation that we are actively engaged in seeking an end to their racist policies. While a message may be sent, nobody in Botha's government will receive it. 
As long as there is no international agree­ment to divest, the actions of one nation are going to be minimized; other nations are likely to pick up our investments at greatly reduced costs. Roughly 70 institutions across the United States have divested, but nobody has told whether or not these Investments have been taken up by other institutions or by other governments. Nor has anyone said, "Why not?" I cannot say for I do not know. 
Another thing I cannot say is that I know the answers to the problems with U.S. foreign policy in Latin America. Since Hoffman con­centrated on the Nicaraguan situation, so shall 

I. Arguing about the correctness or about the morality of the position taken by the U.S. government immediately after the Sandinistas overthrew Somoza in the extremely popular 1979 revolution is a moot argument; the situa­tion six years ago is unchangeable. 
The fact remains that governments of the United States and of Nicaragua are unfriendly toward each other and that Nicaragua has received much aid from the Soviet Union. 
Ifwe were to pull out all aid from the Con­tras, they probably would be defeated quickly, the Sandinistas would probably restore a bit of order as soon as possible, and the Soviets would want to collect the returns of their in­vestments in Ortega's government in the form ofmilitary bases and other favors -probably. 
Hoffman said that night that the United States didn't need to be interfering in Nicaragua. Well, the way I see it-at best, un­clear; at worst, wrong -in the interests of na­tional security, we do need to prevent the Soviets from gaining another military foothold to our south which could threaten the Panama Canal and Caribbean trade routes. 
Hoffman also mentioned that the revolu­tionary government still is popular, but he failed to mention that many of the revolutionaries feel that Ortega and Co. have betrayed the movement and these people have joined the Contras. They are not, as Hof­fman implied, solely the remnants of the Somoza regime. Also, the Catholic Church in Nicaragua Is separating itself from the govern­
ment because of the harsh suspension of

Following in the choppy wake left by any 
number of letters to the editor, there are a 
couple ofpoints which need to be made in the

Let's go after this superiority/inferiority myth. Does anyone wish it to be knowable? And when you have the answer, what do you do with it? 
One woman put forth the notion that since women had the higher grade point, they were the superior sex on campus. Her reasoning speaks for itself. My grade point will not get me a job, it will not pay for my car, nor will it impress a young woman into ecstasy.

supremacy at Notre Dame Is engendered (pun intended) simply because the biggest of the big shots are men, for example, Father Hes­burgh, Fa\her Tyson, and Digger Phelps. 
Speaking for myself, I do not feel threatened by women. In fact, one ofmy best high school friends was a girl from another school. We met through academic debate, which to say the least, is a competitive endeavor. We got along famously, despite the fact that in head to head competition, she blasted me out of the room and came within one ballot of winnning the national championship. I can truthfully say that her success never bothered me a bit, and in fact, I really enjoyed seeing one of my friends doing well. · 
Okay, so the women have the better grade point on campus. But that has about as much to do with which is the superior sex as the bench press weights for the football team. Let's state this succinctly, so no one can miss it. 
Superior sex, Notre Dame: NONE. 
That done, we can now move on to the topic of exploitation. In all seriousness, it is a problem, but the issues raised in P.O. Box Q have set the cause back at least a decade. The fact of the matter is that a USC song girl ap­peared in The Observer with an accompany­ing caption which made reference to the fact that the men on campus were happy that she was there. 
Was The Observer being sexist? Let's face reality, the men were happy to see an at­tractive woman, and always are happy to see one. It's part ofthis great conspiracy. Men are supposed to be attracted to women. Indeed, The Observer reported the facts reliably,

human freedoms in many areas -a suspension which Hoffman tried to justify. 
In both Nicaragua and South Africa, we are involved in bringing about a change in government, and in both cases, Hoffman is opposed to the policy ofthe United States. His message seemed to be clear that night: "Be heard, be rude, swear ifyou must to get some attention because you cannot use the system of the 'King's Court' nor can you use the 'King's English' to communicate." 
It seems that he feels rational, intelligent discussions are useless and violen~e is the 
answer. One last question Hoffman, ifI may. If you are so opposed to the deplorable condi­tions of poverty in these nations, where do you get the nerve to put a SI00 bill on the podium to help defray the costs of stolen sheets to be used In the anti-apartheid "rally" at the Notre Dame/Ole Miss. football game? From where I was, it seemed like your roll of bills was rather thick, but I cannot say for sure.

sexist or otherwise. To call this explmtauon is to stretch the definition beyond recognition. 
Recall what I just said about men being at­tracted to women. Perhaps that should be turned around. Aren't women attracted to men? Sure they are, which begs the question of their admiration of the male form. Guys don't notice this much, but football players run around in tight, form fitting pants which give females a good look at some posterior and thigh muscles. 
'Fess up girls, you've been looking, haven't you? Can you truthfully say that all you look for is the ball? How many times has it been said at a party, "Omigod, I saw him at the football game! Whatta hunk!" I have run across, in my three years plus on this fonress of solitude, women who will date only football players. That in and ofitselfis all right; football players don't have a corner on the looks or nice guy market, but they aren't total jerks, either. But there are women who freely admit that they will only date football players simply because they're football players. I submit that those women are just as bad as a man who says he wants to date only cheerleaders or song gtl1s. 
Look, we all appreciate the assets of the op­
posite sex. God wanted it that way. The sexes 
are separate, but equal. There are men who 
are smarter than I am and there are women 
who are smarter than I am. Who cares? We're 
all part ofthe human race, not to mention the 
Notre Dame community. Why divide accord­
ing to sex, GPA, good looks or money? 
Women have their charms and men have theirs. The twain perhaps never shall meet, but they're pretty good when they get toget­her.

P.O. BoxQ 
Reacts to commentary on ND maternity policy 
Dear Editor: 
In response to the article written by Joann 
DdlaNeva and Thoma.~ Flint regarding the 
shortcomings of Notre Dame's maternity 
policy, I quote directly from the Notre Dame 
handbook: 
"Leave of absence is also granted to mem­
bers for reason ofchildbearing, incapacitating 
sickness, or serious disability. The University 
obligates itself to pay a member's salary for a 
period ofsix months. During this period medi­
cal reports are to be submitted to the Provost 
at two-month intervals. The University 
reserves the right to discontinue payments 
after the six-month period. 
Leave of absence officially granted by the 
llnlverslty with or without renumeratlon is 
counted as service for purpose of tenure and 
promotion unless otherwise expressly stip­
ulated."

Coffey's Inside column CQnfuses the whole issue 
Dear Editor: 
We are writing in regard to Catherine Cof­fey's article on rape at Notre Dame. We feel the article is totally inappropriate and biased. Although It does depict a case of rape, It does not depict a case ofdate rape. 
Date rape occurs when a male takes 
advantage of a female In a date situation, not 
an acquaintance the victim "hardly knew" 
luring an unsuspecting girl into his car. While 
it Is possible that "rape can happen anywhere, 
even here at Notre Dame," here are the facts. 
There has been one rape, not date rape, 
reported here in the last 1 0 years. Going by 
Coffey's statistics, Women's Day, "forty-seven 
percent of all rapes go unreported," this 
means there actually have been two rapes 
committed at Notre Dame In the past decade. 
We agree two rape cases are two too many, but this should not cause the women here to develop a sense ofinsecurity. We agree some precautions should be taken, but those of­fered by Coffey will not alleviate the situation. Again her confusion between rape and date rape is apparent. 
We also wish to question Coffey's choice of sources. We do not believe accurate and un­biased Information on a topic such as rape can be found using only one source, Women's Day. A topic of this importance should be researched thoroughly before a complete ar­ticle can be written. 
As a result of Coffey's generalizations and misuse offacts, her article appears to be a per­sonal vendetta rather than an objective look at a very serious subject.

Key days remembered for mark on generation 
There seems to be certain events in one's lifetime that are particularly noteworthy. So much so that we can remember exactly where we were at the time of the event, what we were feeling and what was running through our minds. 
Daniel C. DeCarlo guest column 
On the personal level, maybe this occurred 
when a certain loved one passed away. 
Whatever the occasion, these experiences 
truly pa.~ the test of time; we never forget. As 
a nation, there have been several such occa­
sions down through the generations. Our 
parents' generation surely can tell us were it 
was at the time the news of President Ken­
nedy's assasination was aired. My 
grandparents hardly can forget the details of 
their feelings at the news of Pearl Harbor or 
the bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
As a generation, we have grown up with the nuclear age. Big bombs are as real to us as the Cubs being 23 games out by the all-star break. We have never known the world to be any 
other way. In fact, to many of us, a world free of the threat of nuclear war has never entered our minds, which made the summit in Geneva usch a momentous occasion whether we realized it or not. 
In examining my own lifetime, I can think of only one event which could stimulate nationwide "Yeaa, I was at my friend Billy's and ... " type of talk. The oddity ofit allis that the event was by no means Important. This trivial event willstick In most ofour minds as a joyous, proud moment. The event was the winning of the gold medal by The United States t 980 Olympic Hockey Team In Lake Placid, New York. The victory over The Soviets was an Incredible task by an even more Incredible set ofyoung men. Americans everywhere could not help bur love them. On 
that chilly night in February, Americns across 
the country sat in their living rooms with tears 
in their eyes whispering the words ofThe Na­
tional Anthem along with Jim Craig and Herb 
Brooks. 
As great a thrill as the hockey team gave us, it does not seem appropriate the victory should symbolize our generation. At best, the victory was an outstanding effort, a lesson in determination. It was not something that marked a change in the course of history. It was not, as many would like to think, a victory ofgood over evil. We did not prove to the rest of the world that the Soviets were the devll's handyman and that we are better than those dogs. 
I hoped this would all change and the two leaders who met in Geneva would be able to put their public relation machines aside and concentrate on givingour generation agift we have never received before, a world free of atomic fear. 
Most of us did not pay too much attention to the summit. Many feel it was just more use­l~ss talk. The odds of getting any-thing ac­complished amidst the propaganda war were even greater than the odds those twenty dreamy-eyed kids faced; however, a major breakthrough at the talks would have given us all something to remember. 
I hope my kid, unlike me, only will know a world free of a Cold War. Then, I can tell him what was running through my mind when Reagan announced the good news of the his­toric of a nuclear-free world and when Jim Craig clutched the American flag like a baby blanket. Only President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev can give us another event to mark our generation. Maybe we could even get AI Michaels to make a trip to Geneva and break the news when this im­possible dream comes true. Oh say can you see ... (sniff, sniff).

ND Thanksgiving noted as special by Hesburgh 
DearNotre Dame men and women: 
One thing I learned from my mother, long ago, was to say "Thank you" for favors received. I've tried to practice that lesson ever since, but must admit that I really don't say thanks often enough to all the people to whom I am indebted for so much. 
Fr. Theodore Hesburgh guest column 
Thanksgiving Day is an opportunity for all of us to catch up on ourgratitude. We do well to begin with God, thanking Him for life, present and eternal, for home and family, for America and freedom, for so many unearned and often neglected graces, for peace thus far, despite ever-impending nuclear dissaster. 
And then thanks to all those people who give us so much, mom and dad, teachers through all the long years of our education, friends who put up with our foibles and love us none the less, all the people we take so much for grante.d: farmers and cooks and dish­washers, maids and janitors, laundry workers and groundskeepers. The list gets longer: rec­tors and RAs, chaplains, librarians and nurses, 
secrectarles, coaches, guards, mailmen and bus drivers. They all deserve a word of thanks and so seldom get one. 
I would like, here and now, to thank all of this community for all that each one of you does to make this a special place. And thanks especially to Notre Dame, Our Lady, for watching over each one ofus as Her own. 
Happy Thanksgiving. 
Ever devotedly In Notre Dame, 
Father Ted Hesburgb 


Church must eliminate its Vatican II 'reforms' 
The Catholic Church has, until 1962, been one of the most traditional bodies the world has known. Many parts of the Mass date back to the time ofChrist and some of the readings date all the way back to the time ofMoses. The church has been proud ofthese traditions and followed them to the letter. Then came the Second Vatican Council. This Church council tried to follow the lead ofthe rest ofthe world and depart from the ways of the past and sub­stitute them with the idea that whatever works is right. 
Rich Coglianese the way we were 
It was this council that destroyed the Ideaof the Latin Mass. It changed that ageless formula in the false hope that a Mass in the venacular would bring more people to Church. Church attendance, however, was higher in the t 950's (while the Mass was still In Latin) than it is today. This is an absurd notion that if the 
people do not understand what is being said they will not go. As a priest once told me, "If somebody really wants to go to Mass, he will go if the Mass is said in English, Latin, Swahili, or any other language." The Latin Mass was one of the most beautiful Church traditions that Vatican II destroyed. 
Another tradition that was destroyed by Vatican II was a set order ofauthority. Priests followed the orders ofthe bishop, and the bis­hop followed the orders of the Pope. The laymen knew exactly where the church stood on a particular issue without any doubt. Vatican II has done away with the absolute authority of the Pope, as is clearly evident today. 
More and more priests are allowing alter­girls, something that the Pope has forbidden, to serve Mass, Instead ofalterboys. When told by the Pope and their particular bishop that this practice Is wrong, the priests claim they 
are really following the will of God since It Is 
God's will that men and women Should be 
equal. 
These priests are also doing away· with the 
tradition that women are not allowed to serve 
In that position since that has been revealed to 
us In sacred scripture-tradition. Alterboy Is 
supposed to be the first step toward the pries­
thood that a young boy can take. Since Jesus 
himself set It up that no woman Is eligible to 
become a priest, we cannot change that fact. I 
would like to ask all ofthe feminists out there 
who think that It is fine to ordain women, 
when Christ commissioned his apostles Into ,the priesthood, how many women did he commission? Well, if there were I I people commissioned and they were all men, I guess that the answer Is zero. Christ set the Church up this way for a reason. Neither I nor anyone else understands why Christ did this, but He did. We cannot change it. 
Vatican II has succeeded In destroying these great traditions. Pope John Paul II has called for an "extraordinary synod" to meet In Rome in late November to reassess the changes Vatican II has made and to prepare the Church as it enters Its third millennium. We can only hope this synod will see the mistakes of Vatican II and reverse the dan­gerus momentum. 
If Pope John Paul II is able to reverse the dangers of Vatican II, the Church will once again be able to be proud of Its traditions and use them to guide It through another millen­nium. On the other hand, if the synod falls to see the mistakes ofVatican II, the Church will continue farther away from the path that Christ has dug and the Church's third millen­nium will present problems for pastors and parishioners alike. 
Remember: Don't fix something that ain't broke. 
Rich Coglianese is in the Freshman Year of Studies at Notre Dame.

"We had many opportunities that 
we did not capitalize on such as the 
blocked field goal." 
The second half belonged to the Dogs, both offensively and defensively. On their opening drive, the Dogs drove down the field and scored the only touchdown of the day. The main part ofthe drive con­sisted ofScheurmann's two passes to Bill Kelly. The first pass covered 40­yards to set up the bigger one two plays later when Kelly hauled in a pass, spun around one man, and scored the only touchdown. The point-after attempt was blocked by 
John Haydin making the score 6-0. 
Following this impressive first drive, the Alumni defense stopped the Flanner offense in just three plays withJoe Puetz picking up a key sack. Following the punt by Frank Malone, the Alumni offense tried to get things started again only to be halted by the strong play ofJim Kelly and Greg Smith. 
Orrthe next Flanner possession, it tried tt, 1-.cep control by keeping the ball on the ~round, but again was forced t·> giH' the ball to Alumni when Gibbs tackled a Flanner Bob Diloreto, stopped the Alumni offense forcing a punt. 

The Alumni defense then rose to the occasion. On lilanner's first play a strong front lead by Matt Ror., Bill Smith, and Joe Puetz stopped Kt:lly after only ont· \'ard. After a holding penalty put the ball on the Q-vard line, Roy burst through the line of scrimmage and chased Bridgeman into the end ;.one, tacl..ling him for a safety. This was the final scoring as Flanner's final drive was stymied by an inteception by Gibbs. The game ended as Alumni had posted an 8-0 victory. 
Roy thought that the quickness of Flanner's quarterback would ; prevent him from getting the safety. 
"I didn't think that I was going to be able to get him," said Roy. "He is very quick. After I fought off the Ini­tial block no one picked me up. He tried to get rid of the ball, but I was there to tackle him." 
Joe Milkovich thought that Alumni had no stand outs, but the team played together which helped them to victory. He also felt that a few Flanner players should receive recognition for their play. 
"No player really stood out for Alumni. They played as a team and put forth a 100 percent effort," said Milkovich. "As for our play, Tom Sul­livan, Jim Kelly, Frank Malone, and Bob Diloreto played extremely well. Tom Sullivan was the glue to our team. He brouwu the team together. 
also commented that other players deserved credit for the victory. 
"Paul was most likely the most dedicated Dog player," said Puetz. "He was always willing to play and succeed. He was the strength ofour team. He guided us to where we are today.' 
"Joe, on tiv: other hand, was our emotional leader," continued Puetz. "He knew we were capable of win­ning. He was always on the field yel­ling, screaming, doing anything to help boost the morale of the team. These two held the team together." 
"The play of Joe Dearie, Jim Goebel, Tim Smith, and Bod Debroux really inspired the team," added Gcro. "Tim Smith played both ways giving everything he had. In ad· dition to these players, I feel the play 
of Ned Gaffney really helped us im· prove the line. All in all, the win must be considered a team effort." 
The fan support at the game really showed the spirit of both halls. The Alumni fans formed a tunnel for the team, barked out vicious Dog calls, and cheered the team to victory. Gibbs felt that this support capped a great season. 
"Today's effort was a culmination of a great season," said Gibbs. "Fan participation played a big part in our victory. The Dog fans literally pushed us to victory with their cheering. The team appreciates it very much."

LAKE FOREST, Ill. · The Notre Dame hockey team got its first road victory ofthe year Saturday night by beating Lake Forest, 6-3. Rich Sobilo scored twice, including a short­handed tally, and Tim Lukendaregis­tered 36 saves to pace the Irish to the win. The victory boosted the 
Irish recored to 4-7-1 while the Foresters fell to 0-5-1.

Ever thought about where those 
big, thick media guides for Irish foot· 
ball and basketball seasons come 
from? Ever wondered who keeps 
track of all Notre Dame's sports 
statistics for the media? How about 
who gets programs ready for foot· 
ball and basketball games? 
The hidden office responsible for all these visible functions is the sports information department, a division of the Notre Dame athletic department with an office tucked far away in the back right hand corner of the athletic department office in theACC. 
The sports information depart­
ment performs a variety ofduties for 
the university. Apart from produc­
ing the media guides for all 19 var­
sity sports and the game programs, 
For the past two years the depart­ment has also trained an intern, one who hopes to work as a sports in­formation director somewhere the 
following year. Mike McCall is doing his internship at Notre Dame in 
1985-86.

fort from everyone, especially the penalty killers," Smith said. "We moved the puck well, forechecked well, and broke out well. 
"It's very positive to go out and win one on the road," Smith con­tinued. "It gets that monkey (the Irish had won but one game on the road dating back to last season) off our back." 
This game was much more physi­cal than Thursday night's 4-4 tie with the Lake Forest squad. Notre Dame displayed intense forecheck­ing throughout the game. Their defensive effort ai.iowed only one equal-strength goal.

Valdiserri's top aide is Associate Sports Information Directo' John Heisler, who directs publicity in­volving Irish football and basketball. Now in his eighth year in Notre Dame's sports information depart­ment, Heisler has helped produce 
1 0 programs and media guides which have been judged best in the nation by the CSIDA. 
Fourth-year Assistant Sports In­formation Director Eddie White handles the 1 7 "non-revenue" sports. He, too, can boast of award­winning publications. The CSIDA has voted three of his publications among the top five in the nation. 
The department also employs three secretaries and eight student workers. The students, some of whom hope to be sports information directors themselves in the future, 
work two hours a day, five days a week, orgainizing information on as­signed teams.

penalty. In the resulting five-minute power play, the Foresters tied the score on goals from Kevin Hannigan and jim Elia. 
That would be as close as the Foresters would get for the rest of the game. With one minute left in Chapman's major penalty, Sobilo converted a pass from Jeff Badalich to put the Irish al).ead 3·2. Sobilo scored his second of the night and the Irish's fifth on a pretty back· handed shot in the second period. Tom Mooney had the fourth Notre Dame tally on a power-play score with Badalich picking up another as­sist. 
Freshman center Bob Bilton got the first goal of his Notre Dame career at 6:34 of the third to round out the ·Irish scoring.. With just un­der three minutes to go in the game, Lake Forest's Tim Kelly's. netted a slapshot from the top of the slot to finish off the scoring. 
One sour note for the Irish, co­captain Dave Waldbillig and center Mark Anquillare did not make the trip as they joined co-captain Bob Thebeau on the injury list.

For the Notre Dame volleyball team, the weekend brought the final home match ofthe year. The Irish went up against nationally· ranked Arizona State and lost in straight games, 15-6, 15·8, 15·5. 
"By far, they were the best defensive team we've played against all year," said Notre Dame head coach Art lambert. "But we're a young team and we've got a way to go."

"I made (the decision to change kickers) right after Lewis missed the second one," said Arnsbarger. "In the pregame warmup, I didn't think Ron was kicking the ball well. I felt it was time to give someone else a chance." 
As it turned out, replacement Matt DeFrank lined up for a 27-yard at­tempt which he barely placed over the crossbar in the Irish end zone with 44 seconds left in the first half. With a late touchdown and the DeFrank conversion, the Tigers were able to rack up ten points to top the Irish.

a lack of execution at critical times that did them in. Beuerlein was in­tercepted twice in the final two minutes, and John Carney had two field goal tries blocked by LSU's Henry Thomas and missed a third after it was tipped at the line of scrimmage. 
"It was especially tough on the seniors, but the way it happened it was tough on everybody," said Beuerlein. "We played well, but it just wasn't meant to be. It makes you wonder what it takes to win. It's frustrating." 
In addition to being the last home appearance for the 24 Irish seniors, this game also was most likely the last Notre Dame Stadium contest for Irish head coach Gerry Faust. But af. terwards Faust, who is on the final year ofa five-year contract and is not expected to be offered an extension, tried to downplay his situation.

After extending the Irish lead to seven following their initial score, Camey saw his next kick get blocked by LSU noseguard Henry Thomas after a 1 0-play Notre Dame drive. TI1en, after barely missing Car­ney's second try, Thomas got through the line again In the second half to knock down a third attempt foUowing an 18-play Irish march. 
"(Tiger defensive end Karl Wil­son) was able to open the hole for me," explained the 6-2, 255-pound Thomas·. "He knocked the guy out of the way. I was just able to get through the line and I guess I just timed It weU when the kick came." 
Faust replied in the post-game press conference when asked if he con· sidered this to be his last game at Notre Dame Stadium. Everyone else apparently did think ofit, however. 
Faust said he had no idea as to whether or not he would be back to coach the team next season. An an­nouncement on that subject should be forthcoming next week. But Faust's post-game philosophizing in the past tense about his tenure at Notre Dame raised a few eyebrows. 
"I've gotten a lot ofbreaks in life," Faust said. "I'm healthy. I've got a healthy family. I've represented a great unive~ity. I'm just happy to have had that opportunity." 
Faust's five-year record now stands at 30·25·1. He has lost more games than any coach In Notre Dame history. 
As for the game, it looked as if it might be a long day for the LSU defense when Notre Dame scored on its opening drive on an 18-yard end-around run by Brown. But as things turned.out, those were the only points the Irish would get. 
"It wasn't a question of moving the ball," said Beuerlein, "because I think we did a good job of that. It was just a question of putting the ball in the end zone." 
Although Notre Dame's otfense managed to do that only once, the defense came within three-and-a· 
half minutes of making it stand up.

FoUowing early injuries to Irish quick tackle jay Underwood and strong guard Shawn Heffern, Notre Dame was forced to test Its depth on the llne. 
"We had a couple of breakdowns in the Jlne," explained holder Hal Von Wyl. "The loss of Underwood and Shawn (Heffern) were key losses." 
While Thomas was able to penetrate the llne and get at the kicked balls, credit al10 should be given to the Tiger defensive line which created the openings for the junior noseguard to keep the Irish score at seven. 
While the Irish saw late drives fal· ter after the Tigers established a 10· 7 lead, the kicking game proved to be a crudal ingredient. Ofthe seven field goal attempts lOr tbr day, only one was successful. 
Unfortunately for the Irish, that 
was the difterence in the match. 

Up until that point the Tigers had managed only a second-quarter field goal by punter Matt Defrank, who was called upon by Arnsparger to replace the inetfcctlvc Ron Lewis. But late in the founh quarter a fine punt by DeFrank pinned Notre Dame in its own end and helped set up the good field position for the 
Tigers' winning touchdown drive. 

That drive started on the Tigers' 48-yard line, and was keyed by quar­terback Jeff Wickersham's three completions for 49 yards. Tailback Garry James blasted through a gaping hole over left tackle for the winning points with a little more than three minutes to play. 
Wickersham had an outstanding day, connecting on 31-of-42 passes for 294 yards, setting a record for passes completed against a Notre Dame team. He benefitted all after­
noon from consistent pass protec­tion that did not allow a sack. 
After the LSU touchdown Notre Dame took the ensuing kickoff and drove to midfield, but Beuerlein threw high over the middle for Reggie Ward and saw his pasS inter· cepted by LSU's Ron Sancho to halt the drive. 
The Irish got one last gasp when Eric Dorsey forced and recovered a fumble by Dalton HIUfard, but that threat ended when Beuerlein's pass found Rehage's hands on the first play.

SMC basketball team loses, 58-57, on last-second Kalamazoo prayer 
ByJILL SARBENOFF 
Sports Writer-
The Saint Mary's basketball team lost a heartbreaker Saturday night at Kalamazoo College, 58-57, on a last­second desperation shot from 25 feet out. 
The Belles completed 32 percent of their shots from the .floor for a to­tal of 56 points. They suffered at the line, however, completing only one out of their three free throw chances. Kalamazoo, on the other hand, went 12-for-25 in this depart­ment. 
Even though the team lost this first game of the season, St. Mary's head coach Marvin Wood was still pleased with the Belles' perfor­
mance. 
"I really felt we played pretty good. There were a couple of dead spots when the ball just would not go into the basket, but we were playing a team with a lot ofsize. 
"It was hard playing against their match-up so early in the season," continued Wood. "but the girls

made some excellent adjustments. Our press did well most of the time and our quickness created some dif­ficulties for them." 
Offensively, the Belles made relatively few mistakes and had only 19 turnovers. Leading scorer for Saint Mary's was seniorforward Beth Krieber out ofColumbus, Ohio with 20 points. Sophomore Tammye Radke from Saint Joseph, Mich. was next with a total of 12 points. In ad­dition, Krieber helped pace the defense with her eight rebounds. Freshman center Jennifer Harte out ofOak Park, Ill. had seven rebounds, while sophomore center-forward, Stephanie Duke, had six. The Belles also had a total of 22 assists and 16 steals in Kalamazoo. 
According to Woods, there are three goals he would like to see the team accomplish this year. 
"First of all, we'd like to be a win­ner. Last season was a really long season, winning only four games. There are a lot of young ladies who are giving (us) a lot oftheir time and

( 7-of-15 from the floor, 6-of-6 from the line). The sophomore guard with the flashy moves even was moved to attempt a few new ones. 
"You have to try some new things at some point in time," he said. "This was a good game to do that. As the season goes on, you're going to see more and more new things. 

"We really didn't play well tonight, though, and I think that was due to a lack of mental concentra­tion. Mentally, we didn't really prepare for St. Joe because they didn't come in here with that big ofa reputation." 
St.Joseph's, 0-1, was paced by Stan Kappers' 18 points and 13 rebounds. Mark Wingard added 13 points for the Pumas. 
With the game well in hand, Phelps had an opportunity to clear the bench and give his reserves plenty of playing time. Walk-on Steve Nicgorski even managed to get in for the game's final minute, taking the opportunity to register the frrst field goal of his college career.

effort. It'd be worthwhile to have. winning season. 
"Also, we'd like to win a tourna­ment," continued Woods. "We play in one at Goshen and we are hosting one this season. Thirdly, we'd like to get in the NAJA playoffs. Getting in means being one ofthe better teams in the area." 
The Belles, nevertheless, will be tested a number of times in the up­coming games on the schedule. Among their opponents are Val­paraiso University, which is in Divi­sion I, St. Joe's College, a Division II member, and Aquinas College. Aquinas is the winner of last year's National Catholic Championship. 
In the irnmediate future, Saint Mary's will take on Hunnington Col­lege Tuesday night at Hunnington. There are several things the team is doing to prepare for this game and to avenge this weekend's loss. 
"We are going to go over things (Hunnington) did last year," said Woods. "We will prepare for what they did to us last year and, hope­fully, we will be ready for them."

to clinch interhall championship 
Notre Dame suffers another painful loss 
By LARRY BURKE 
.AssistantSportsEditor 
It could have been a perfect ending in a not-so­perfect season, but it turned out to be another one of those disappointing finishes that have become all too 
 
I familiar to Notre Dame fans this year. It wasn't until the final minute-and-a-half, when Steve Beuerlein's pass bounced off Tim Brown's chest and 
into the hands ofTiger strong safety Steve Rehage, that LSU could breath a sigh ofrelief. The 1 7th-ranked Tigers had to stave off two Notre Dame comebackdrives in the final three minutes to preserve their 10-7 victory before a capacity crowd of 59,075 in Notre Dame Stadium. 
The Irish lost at home for the first time in six games this season, and saw their record drop to 5-5. I.SU went to 7-1-1 with the victory. 
Lost in the frustration of the loss was another fine effon by Allen Pinkett. The senior tailback picked up 103 yards on 30 carries, the 21st time in his career that he has surpassed the century mark. He also broke the 4,000-yard mark for his career and became the first back in Irish history to gain 1,000 yards in three con­secutive seasons. 
"The bottom line is the success of the team and win­ning the football game," Pinkett said when asked about his accomplishments. "Personal achievements don't mean that much to me in a loss. Ifwe lose I'll look back and figure that I must have been lacking somewhere in my performance." 
But as has been typical of many of Notre Dame's games this season, the Irish were not really lacking in the quality oftheir performance Saturday. Ratherit was

Missed kicks make difference in defeat 
By MICHAELJ. CHMIEL 
Sports Writer 
In any one of their first five games at Notre Dame Stadium this season, a missed field goal by the Irish probably would not have had a bearing on the outcome of the contest. Using a mixed bag of field goals and touchdowns, Notre Dame was able to run up the tally sheet and account for its five wins in a fairly impressive manner. 
Saturday, however, the story was slightly different. In frigid conditions, the Irish became engaged in a tough, hard-hitting affair. Every point proved to be crucial as Notre Dame eventually lost a tight contest by the mar­gin ofa kick. 
"It was just one ofthose hard knockers with everyone going at it until the very end," explained I.SU head coach Bill Arnsbarger. "It was a great football game. It was what we had anticipated." 
What the Tiger coach did not expect, however, was 
to be trailing for most of the game. Scoring first, Notre 
Dame proceeded to dominate its rivals from I.SU 
throughout the first three quaners. 
With a i-0 deficit and the Tigers' holding the ball for the third time late in the first quarter, however, I.SU kicker Ron Lewis lined up for a 49-yard field goal at-' tempt. The sophomore promptly booted the ball short and wide to the right for the first ofhis two blunders. 
While this first kick was from considerable distance, Lewis' second miss was merely a chip shot, coming from only 26 yards away. This performance in a tight defensive struggle prompted Arnsbarger to replace Lewis with a punter who had lined up for only two

The center ofthe universe, at least in terms of interhall football, is Alumni Hall. 
On Sunday, Alumni and Flanner, two teams known for their physical play, met in Notre Dame Stadium to decide which hall would reign as the 1985 interhall football champion. When the game concluded, the Alumni Dogs had posted an 8-0 shutout of Flanner Hall. 
Both teams played well, but Alumni had a more overall balanced attack which propelled it to victory. 
The game began with Flanner on offense. The intensity to win was shown on the first play. Flanner quarterback Randy Bridgeman sent a flea-flicker pass downfield where it was intercepted by Alumni defensive back Steve Hagnell. Al­though this was nullified by defensive interference, it showed that both teams had come ready to play. Following this penalty, Flanner proceeded to march down the field behind the strong running of Jim Kelly. The drive was halted, though, as a field goal attempt was blocked by Alumni's Paul Laughlin. 
Following Flanner's opening drive, Alumni proceeded to open in an impressive fashion. On its second play from scrimmage, Tim Smith rambled for 50 yards to the Flanner 20-yard line before being tackled. The threat, however, ended as a Keh Scheurmann pass was intercepted by Jeff Strazis, a Flanner defensive back. 
In the second quaner Flanner, after a 13-yard run, gained 15 more yards on a penalty against the Alumni defense. With Flanner on the march again, the Alumni defense had to rise to the occassion. On second down, Bridgeman pitched the ball to Frank Malone who proceeded to fumble it. By the time he picked up the ball, a wall of Dog defensive players had formed. They proceeded to drop Malone for a 15­yard loss. On the n!!x~ play, a reverse by Flanner was stopped for another 10-yard loss by Tom Meagher and Steve Hagnell. Flanner, as result of Alumni's defensive play, punted the ball. 
On its second series, Alumni was 
halted in four plays as defensive lineman Greg Smith made two key tackles. Flanner regained possession of the ball and used a bit of trickery to sustain a long drive. On a founh and seven, Malone dropped back to punt but instead threw a 20-yard 1strike for a first down. Following 
I this, Jim Kelly ran for 1 5 yards. Inside the Alumni 20-yard line, Kelly looked as though he had broken free for a touchdown on this run, but Alumni linebacker Mike Gibbs dove and made a touchdown saving tackle, a tackle that would prove im­ponant to the final outcome of the game. The Alumni defense buckled up and, a few plays after, nose tackle Jim Gero sacked Bridgeman for a 12­yard loss. On the next play, a Flanner pass was batted to the ground en­ding the drive and the half. 
Alumni player John Puetz thought that the Alumni team did not play up to Its capability in the first half. On the other hand, Flanner coach Joe Milkovich thought that Flanner played well but did not capitalize on its opponunities.
