Police investigate Linebacker larcenies 
Numerous auto break-ins occurred in recent months; women's purses and luggage targeted 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Assistant News Editor 
More than a dozen car break-ins have occurred in the parking lot adjacent to the Linebacker Lounge since April -and five of them have happened since late August, police said Wednesday. 
Four break-ins were reported over a three-day stretch in September. said Capt. Phil Trent, the spokesman for the South Bend Police Department. One car was broken into on Sept. 22, two were broken into on Sept. 23 and another on Sept. 
24. 
In the past 12 months, 
Trent said, 19 larcenies have been reported involving vehi­cles outside the Linebacker, located at 1631 South Bend Ave. Twelve of the larcenies involved women's purses being stolen from the car, Trent said. 
"Somebody's there looking in cars, and when they see a purse exposed, they break into the car," Trent said. 
Laptop computers, cell phones, cash and a piece of luggage have also been taken during the break-ins. 
In addition, Trent said, seven larcenies have been reported inside the bar in the last year. The police reports

With increasing numbers of international undergradu­ate and post-graduate stu­dents from Asia, Europe and Latin America, the International Student Services Association (ISSA) is working to keep those individuals updated on their legal immigration status while studying in the United States. 
Typically, international students possess one of two types of visas: the F1 or Jl. 
The majority are F1 visa holders, which is the stan­dard student visa. J1 visa holders are usually spon­sored either by the student's country of origin or the U.S. and are generally short­term. 
Most of the J1 visa-holding students at Notre Dame are post-graduate visiting schol­ars or non-degree under­graduate students pursuing an exchange program, according to the ISSA.

Mooney creates council 
Fleming to chair panel on multicultural affairs 
By KATIE KOHLER Saint Mary's Editor 
College President Carol Ann Mooney announced last week the formation of the President's Council on Multicultural Affairs after the recommendation of both the 2005 Diversity Task Force and last year's Chairs' Diversity Action Committee. The Council, which is expect­ed to be fully operational by the spring, will meet monthly and report to Mooney twice a year. 
"We have a long way to go with fulfilling our diversity goals, but this council will help us work on the overall diversity of the College and reevaluate how we approach certain issues," Mooney said. 
The Council will consist of both appointed and elected faculty members, as well as administrators and students appointed by Mooney. In total, there will be either 15 or 16 people on the Council, Mooney said. 
The membership has not been finalized.

News Writer 
On a campus where more than 80 percent of the stu­dent body is Catholic, Notre Damn's Campus Ministry con­tinues to reach out to stu­dents of other faiths. 
About 13 percent of stu­dents are of non-Catholic Christian denominations, said Brett Perkins, the direc­tor of student resources for Campus Ministry. The remaining two percent come fro·m other religious baek­grounds. 
"One of the goals of Campus Ministry," Perkins said, "is to offer outlets to all

fACULTY SENATE 
Group recommends student advisors 
By JOSEPH MCMAHON News Writer 
The Faculty Senate recom­mended Wednesday adding student representatives with votes on the committees that review the dean of the School of Architecture and the dean of the Law School. 
The Senate made the sug­gestions to the Academic Council, which is currently in the middle of its review of the University's Academic Articles, something that occurs every 10 years. 
Both amendments passed with mild opposition from fac­ulty members. All the other colleges have student mem­bers on their dean review committees. 
"We need to have consistent principles across all of the col­leges," said Tom Noble, a rep­resentative from the history department. "We do not want to create disunity." 
But Julian Velasco, a mem­ber of the Law School faculty, strongly disagreed.

Man goes fishing, gets stuck in mud 
DURHAM, N.C. -Add another victim to North Carolina's prolonged drought. Donald Meeks set out Monday morning with bow and arrow in hand to hunt for earp on Falls Lake. He almost didn't return. The retired landscaper from Durham went one foot out on the lake because the drought had left the water level so low. 
Using thermal-imaging equipment, the helicopter crew found Meeks at 2:11 
a.m. Tuesday, about 300 yards north of Interstate 85. 
He was surrounded by tall grass and "buried up to his chest in some mud, quick­sand-type matter," Andrews said. 
Deputies created a walk­way with plywood and used some "elbow grease" and finally freed Meeks about two hours later, Andrews said.

Walsh Hall crowned Matt Gelchion, a junior from Fisher Hall, as Mr. ND 2007. The dorms's signature male beauty 
pageant  parody  was  held  
Wednesday  night  in  the  
LaFortune Ballroom.  

The event was a fundraiser for the Catholic Worker House in South Bend, and each male resi­dence hall paid $100 to sponsor a contestant for the Mr. ND title. Women's residence halls con­tributed $50 to have one repre­sentative participate in judging the contest. 
In a series of dance, song and comedic performances, contest­ants from every male dorm, except Keough and Knott Halls, competed for a $100 first place prize. 
Mr. Stanford, Justin Schneider, was first runner-up in the contest and winner of a $50 prize. Molly McCarthy and Elizabeth Berger, Walsh residents and hosts for Mr. ND 2007, presented the winners with checks and flowers. 
The 12 contestants, dressed in jeans and white T-shirts, opened the night with a choreographed dance to Avril Lavigne's "Girlfriend." 
In the personality competition that followed, the contestants were asked to describe the outfit they had chosen to represent their personality. 
The outfits were judged on originality, creativity and overall impression. 
"Personality is probably the biggest thing I look for when judging," said Cristin O'Connor, a judge from Pasquerilla East. 
The second part of Mr. ND 2007 allowed each contestant to showcase a talent. After this round, the top five contestants participated in a singing bee com­petition. That was followed by a question and answer segment. 
After he was crowned Mr. ND, Gelchion, who participated in the competition last year, said: "It was great to do it for a great cause." 
· Schneider was pleased with his experience and plans on donating his $50 back to charity. 
Claire Northway, a junior from Walsh Hall, organized Mr. ND 2007. Northway said the money donated to Catholic Worker House will help residents, who are otherwise homeless, to "be motivated by something, be in community and get back on their feet." 
Northway expects the proceeds to exceed the $700 raised by the event last year. With 12 male dorms and the judges from the women dorms contributing, the total should surpass $1,000, she said.

faiths on campus, not just Catholicism." 
As part of' its Prayer From Around the World series, Campus Ministry held an Eastflrn Orthodox Christian praynr service Wednesday night at the Coleman-Morse Cnn tnr. lnd by Father Mile Subotic. a priest at St. Peter and Paul Eastern Orthodox Church in South Bend and a graduate of Notre Dame. 
The purpose of' holding the service at Notre Dame is to provide "authentic prayer and worship from various faith traditions," said Campus Ministry intern Erika Meyer. About 45 students and faculty attended the prayer service. 
The prayer. ealled Akathist, eonsisted of 13 student-read hymns. Subotie conducted tlw responses. The prayer is traditionally said in dedica­tion to the Most Holy Mother of' (;od, who is venerated throughout the faith as being a holy bridge between humanity and the divine. 
Su botie held a question­and-answer session about the Eastern Orthodox faith after the prayer, revealing dif'­study and discussion about Scripture. 

Chu said he always desired a religious school over a sec­ular one and he liked the "recognition of religion as well as the understanding and respect for community" at Notre Dame. He attends service locally at Fellowship Baptist Church. 
The Ministry's secretary, junior Clarissa Negrete, said it was nice to find the group when he arrived as a fresh­man. 
"It was a good way _to stay grounded in my religion," she said. 
Negrete, who has partici­pated in Campus Ministry­sponsored events like Appalachia, said her faith experience at Notre D.ame has been one of learning. 
"I have had to learn from talking to other Catholics," she said. "I have definitely come to a better understand­ing of their and my own faith." 
Negrete said she hopes non-Catholic students who visit Campus Ministry experi­enee a "wonderful feeling of hospitality." 
Muslim students can come gather weekly for eelebration and a Koran reading, said Priscilla Wong, the advisor to the Muslim Student

Campus Ministry offers non-Catholic students several ways to beeome familiar with Notre Dame and its Catholic tradition. 
In addition to getting a tour of the Basilica, Perkins said, non-Catholic students are also given a complete guide to the Catholic Mass, explain­ing the order of the Mass as well as the different respons­es. 
Campus Ministry also offers many opportunities for non­Catholic students to celebrate their own faith at the University, he said. These students are provided with a complete list of local places of worship in South Bend,

In addition to weekly gath­erings, "students also are able to gather and celebrate the beginning of Hamadan, with the traditional meal beginning with milk and dates," Campus Ministry Direetor Hichard Warner said. 
Such efforts, says Warner, are in accordance with the goal of "Prayer From Around the World." 
"The series started about four to five years ago," Wong said. "The goal is to have people experience prayer forms of different traditions." This year's events include the Eastern Orthodox Service, a Muslim prayer service, a Taize prayer, a Jewish

Students who wish to seek employment off campus or summer internships must undergo a training program called Optional Practical Training (OPT) sponsored by the ISSA. 
OPT guarantees students legal employment status for 12 months after graduation for each degree level in case they plan to stay and work in the U.S. 
"Most students wait until after they graduate to apply (for OPT]," Zhu said. "For students who want to contin­ue working even after that 12-month period terminates, they can seek sponsorship from their respective employer."

SAN DIEGO -A landslide swept away a chunk of an upscale hilltop neighborhood Wednesday, destroying a home, damaging five others and opening up a 50-yard chasm in a four-lane road. 
Forty-six homes in the La Jolla neighborhood were evacuated but no one was hurt in the col­lapse, which occurred the morning after city officials warned residents of four homes not to sleep in them because the land might give way. 
The collapse shortly before 9 a.m. toppled power lines and left a 15-foot-deep ravine of crumpled pavement. Orange traflic cones and sections of big concrete pipes sat in the fissure slashing across the wide boulevard.

Polish ambassador injured after attack 
Fire aimed at diplomatic convoy kills three, injures at least 10; al-Maliki blames Blackwater 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD -A daring ambush of bombs and gun­fire left Poland's ambassador pinned down in a burning vehicle Wednesday before being pulled to safety and airlifted in a rescue mission by the embattled security firm Blackwater USA. At least three people were killed, including a Polish bodyguard. 
The attack -apparently well planned in one of Baghdad's most secure neighborhoods -raised questions about whether it sought to punish Poland for its contributions to the U.S.­led military force in Iraq. But Poland's prime minister. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said his nation would not retreat "in the face of terrorists." 
The diplomatic convoy was hit by three bombs and then attackers opened fire in the Shiite-controlled Karradah district. Polish guards returned fire as the injured ambassador, Gen. Edward Pietrzyk, was pulled from his burning vehicle. At least 10 people, including four Polish security agents, were wounded.

-will represent the student 
body, Mooney said. 
Patricia Fleming, vice pres­
idnnt and dean of faculty, 
who was appointed last 
spring, was named ehair of 
tho Council and is charged 
with forming the Couneil over 
the noxt few weeks. 
"Dr. Fleming's exp1~rienec 
as an administrator and fae­
ulty member makes her a 
good candidate for this posi­
tion." Mooney said. "She was 
chosen both on her experi­
once on theso issues and the 
fact that she is the second 
ranking officer at the 
College." 
The dutios of the Council 
are many, Mooney said. 
"Tho first charge is to mon­
itor the racial and ethnic

faculty, staff and administra­
tors, receive annual reports 
from lluman Hesources and 
Admission regarding the 
College's efforts to create a 
more raeially and ethnically 
diverse student body and 
workforce," Mooney said in 
her announcement of the 
Couneil. 
The Couneil will also over­sen the ongoing odueation and development of the College's cultural diversity and reeeive assessment rnports on these efforts, she said. 
Other eharges of the Council are to reeommond policies and procedures on harassment, propose initia­tives to improve the campus elirnate and raeial and ethnic d ivnrsi fiealion of the College eommunity. 
While Mooney will only be mooting with the Council biannually, she is responsible for implementing policy changes. 
"My job is to form the Couneil and give it general direction," she said. "I expect the Couneil to set its own goals once it gets underway. It is their job to prioritize their work." 
But the Couneil will be allowed -and expeetod. Mooney said -to be the cat­alyst behind those changes. 
"Their reeommendations are what will be the basis for the changes we make," Mooney said. 
lnernasing College diversity among students and faculty was one of the main pillars of Mooney's inaugural platform in 2005. 
The platform focused on increasing diversity to raise academic standards and be eompotitive with nationally known schools, adapting to the more diversified demo­graphies of the United States and developing a new hiring poliey to have a more diverse staff. 
"This will be a body with ongoing goals for the ColiPge," Mooney said. "Goals that will ultimately help us aehievo the levels [of diversi­ty I we set .!'or ourselves a few years ago.

Trent said the break-ins have been through a smashed-in window. In most eases, Trent said, visible items of value, like a purse or a piece of luggage, attracted the thief.

Saint Mary's senior Jeney 
Anderson found her car 
broken into early on May 
12 in a parking lot next to 
the Linebacker. 
Anderson said she arrived at the bar between 
10:30 and 11:00 p.m. and returned outside to the parking lot at approximate­ly 2:30a.m. 
"We all walked back over to our cars, and I was get­ting in my ear when one of my friends said 'Jeney, is your car window always like that?"' said Anderson, who was the designated driver that night. 
The small window on the rear passenger's side had been "eompletely shat­tered" and the doors were unlocked, Anderson said. 
ller friend's purse, which had been lying on the back seat, was gone. Anderson's purse, whieh she had hid­den under the front passen­ger seat, was also missing. 
Neither of the purses taken from Anderson's car have been found. Anderson's purse contained money, debit cards, gift cards and a rosary her roommate gave her from Home. 
ller friend's purse con­tained a digital camera and credit cards. Anderson said someone attempted to use her friend's stolen eredit eards. but not any of her debit cards.

IN BRIEF Democrats call for mortgage solution 
WASHINGTON -Congress' top Democrats demanded quick action on the subprime mort­gage crisis, saying President Bush has been slow to address a situation that could cost mil­lions of people their homes. 
"This is a national crisis. Too bad it's taken so long to realize that we have a crisis," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said at a joint news conference with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. 
Pelosi, Heid and other Democrats want the president to appoint a special adviser to coor­dinate the federal response to the subprime mortgage crisis. 
"The subprime crisis demands action, and we're working to protect families who have lost their home or are in danger of foreclo­sure," Pelosi said. 
For two years, President Bush has sought legislation revamping the Federal Housing Administration but has not gotten anything, said Housing and Urban Development Secretary Alphonso Jackson. "To place even one family at risk is irresponsible, and Congress should stop playing politics with homeowners' financial security," Jackson said. 

Lawsuit filed over frozen hamburgers 
NEWAHK -As government scientists searched for the source of a multistate E. coli outbreak linked to frozen hamburgers, a class-action law­suit W<L'i tiled Wednesday against the producer of the patties and supermarket<; that sold them. 
The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary com­pensation for anyone who bought or was sickened by hamburgers made by Topps Meat Co. of Elizabeth and sold by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Pathmark Stores Inc., ShopRite and Rastelli Fine Foods. 
Topps last week recalled the 21.7 million pounds of frozen hamburgers it made over the past year, the second-largest beef recall in U.S. history. 
The company, which has said it believes much of the meat has already been eaten, declined to comment on the class-action lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Buffalo, N.Y. 
Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., declined to comment on the lawsuit, spokeswoman Sharon Weber said. 
Wall Street unsure rebound warranted 
Investors eager to see Friday's employment report that may gauge consumer spending 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -Wall Street extended its pull­back Wednesday as investors, retrenching from an optimistic stance early in the week, waited to see how well corporate earnings and the job market have held up in an uneven economy. 
The market showed lit­tle conviction for a sec­ond day as economic readings offered few sur­prises and as investors looked for signs -possi­bly from the September employment report due Friday -of whether the market's rebound from its summer lows has been warranted. 
The decline Wednesday preceded earnings reports from the recently completed third quarter and Friday's jobs number, which can signal whether consumer spending will continue apace. Wall Street had little reaction to a report that the nation's service sector, whose industries account for 80 percent of U.S. economic activity, showed a decline last month.

In this past Sunday's Gospel, Jesus challenges us with the story of a rich man who lived sumptuously, all the while ignoring Lazarus, a destitute man who sufl'ered just outside the rich man's 
front door. When  
both men die,  Father Lou  
angels lift the  DeiFra  
poor man oil' to  
the bosom of  FaithPoint  
Abraham, while  
the rich man  

descends into a pit of flames. When the rich man begs for Lazarus to come down and save him, Jesus delivers one of the harshest lines in all of his para­bles to the tormented rich man: "Between us and you, a great chasm is established to prevent anyone from crossing who might wish to go from our side to yours." 
What can Jesus possibly mean? Jesus was not a man who was often held back by chasms, boundaries or taboos. He, for example, regularly trespassed a firmly entrenched boundary between those who were healthy and those who were infected by the highly eontagious disease of leprosy. A similar trench sep­arated Jews and Samaritans-and women and men. Yet, in the fourth chapter of John, we find Jesus, a Jewish man, approach, sit down next to, and converse with a Samaritan adulteress. Neither her gender, race, sexual history, nor the fact that the two of them were alone seems to have deterred him from calling her to holiness. Just for good measure, he ends by commissioning her, reputation and all, to go into the town and tell everyone about him. 
What, then, to make of this absolute "chasm" that Jesus depicts separating the rich man from the poor man? If Jesus spent his life as the Gospels say he did -crossing boundaries to save those who seemed beyond saving­why place the rich and selfish beyond all hope? 
Maybe because they're so rich. So rieh that they don't need anything. At least, they don't think so. Perhaps the main dill'erence between the leper, the Samaritan woman at the well, and the rich man is that the rich man alone is unaware of his poverty-that is to say, his need, no matter how rich he is, for the love of God. and for a life of serving others. 
Though Jesus is uneoncerned with the social taboo of trespassing borders, he makes eJp,ar that there is an impone­t.rable boundary between those who reeognize in Jesus the God whom they need for their salvation. and those­including the Pharisees, rich people. and the self-righteous-who prefer to try to "save" themselves by their own expertise, wealth, or virtue. These peo­ple fail to recognize that all humanity is born into a poverty that only God ean overcome. The boundary that Jesus cannot eross, as it turns out, is not drawn by Jesus himself, but by those who understand themselves as self-suf­ficient. And, because of his ultimate love for our freedom, Jesus refuses to use his divinity and power to impose himself upon those who don't see the need for him. 
The Gospel of John makes explicit that Jesus came to save, not condemn, 
the world. There is no evidence that 
Jesus enjoyed telling the rich man of 
the uncrossable chasm. But Jesus 
seems to me not so much to be judging 
the man -"You go over thore and I 
will build a wall between you and me as 
a punishment for what you've done"­
as he is describing, in brutally honest 
terms, what the man has done to him­
self: "By declaring yourself self-sulli­
cient, you have left no one any means of 
reac~hing you." 
It is not ignoring the harsh facts of Jesus' words to say that thern is much (;ood NPws in this parable, set as it is betwPen the Prodigal Son and the cleansing of the 10 lepers. Throughout tlw Gospels, Jesus' actions make dear that if there is a way to cross a bound­ary to reach us, Jesus will lind it, no matter how great the cost, no matter how great the sin, no matter how unde­serving we might believe ourselves to be. It is only when we rnfuse to rneog­nize our poverty-our absolute need for God, regardless of our wealth, our intelligence, our girts (or our weakrwss­es, limits or sinfulness) -that we truly isolatn ourselves from God's love. The gospel of the rich man and Lazarus makes clear that Jesus dews not stop at any chasm. except a freely made refusal to recognize our need for him.

Disgusted 

It is not very often that I read something in the Viewpoint that has any major effect on me. However, when I read Greg Yatarola's column {"Anorexia and the devil," Oct. 2) I thought I might vomit. Probably surprisingly to Mr. Yatarola, it wasn't because I felt a sudden compulsion to lose a few more pounds so that our trag­ically flawed society would accept me, or even because the main point of his column was so elusive that I got a bit dizzy after the fourth or so paragraph. No, despite being told by an apparently female­respecting writer that I "dress like an Amazon" simply to elicit male attentions or that the reason he doesn't find me attrac­tive is that my physique doesn't "correlate positively with fertility" (what?), the thing that really got me was his nonchalant ref­erence to partial-birth abortions in the opening paragraph. 
You know what's ironic to me, Greg? The fact that you claim to be concerned with the "health problems, physical and psycho­logical" that stem from high beauty stan­dards, and yet, you can still make a joke about sucking the brains from a human being that is only inches away from inde­pendent life. It wasn't witty; it was sicken­ing. I'll let the more "clever folks" follow up on the rest of your column, ifindeed they can tell what you were trying to say. But don't expect me to be gaining a little weight in all the right places to attract your atten­tions any time soon. I don't want them.

''Tiw biggPr thn bands, the greater the dnmands," said Aaron Perri. thn gnrwral managnr of Lngnnds. 
As thn man behind the musie, Perri books bands and arranges the logistks of concerts at thn on-campus restaurant and dub.

Perri finds himself inundated with an average of 25-30 press kits per month from various artists, in addition to avail­ability lists from promoters. I le also con­ducts market research and finds pobmtial new acl<; the old-fashioned way. 
"More often than not, I like to lind out about bands by simply reading maga­zines, watching TV, listening to the radio or going to shows,'' he said. "If you're good enough to play here, chances are you don't have to tell us, we already know." 
Paring down the list of potential acts becomes a bit a more ditlieult. 
"I have to ascertain which acts will go 
over well here on 
campus," Perri said. 


then contact them," Perri said. "Sometimes the hard part is getting some of these guys on the phone. The beauty of it is, I've formed relationships with many of these agents over the past few years. They rest assured that when they book a band to come play at Legends they will be treated professionally and will be given first-class accommodations on stage." 
Believe it or not, the crowd also factors into determining which talent comes to play at Legends. 
"The fan base here at Notre Dame also plays a role in our ability to recruit well known acts," Perri said. "If agents consis­tently hear reports of capacity crowds, they'll want to bring their artist here. Conversely, if they hear reports of apa­thetic crowds, they'll think twice about sending their next band through." 
Once Perri targets a specific band. the real work begins. First, he has to get managers to agree on a performance date. Then an issue known as "routing" comes into play. 
"If [agents] send an artist out to work, they don't want to send them to L.A. and then to Chicago and then to Phoenix. They'll take them from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago to Notre Dame to Cleveland to Philadelphia and Blue October, Umphrey's McGee, Motion City Soundtrack, Demetri Martin, Ben Kweller and OK GO, among many others, it's fair to say that Perri and Legends have had a good deal of success in attracting name-brand talent. That success has only bred more success, Perri said. 
"As our eredibility increases, we're get­ting more and more agencies who will bring bands to us, instead of me going to them first. They want their bands to play Legends," he said. "We're being perceived as a must-play venue and that is really making my job much easier. 
"Another benefit that is coming with increased credibility is the fad that we're no longer really classified as 'college venue' in most agencies' eyes -we've been distinguished as a 'dub.' This may sound like semantics. but the difl'erence is night and day. College shows are often perceived as second-rate shows in sec­<md-rate venues -we're not in that boat.'' 
Despite the success Legends has had, Perri continues to look forward and refus­es to let himsnll' or Lngends rest on il<; lau­rels.

other markets or at other schools, but unfortunately just don't have a good draw here. It seems as though the No. 1 factor in assuring a pop­ular show here is name recognition." 
While Perri also works to offer enter­tainment from all genres, the ultimate decision on who plays at Legends hinges on availability and afl'ordability.

When Perri finally manages to arrange for prospective talent, price negotiation comes into play.

Seinfeld guest stars on premiere of Emmy-winning '30 Rock' 
By CASSIE BELEK 
Assistant Scene Editor 
"30 Hoek," the best least-watched comedy on television, premieres its sec­ond season tonight at 8:30 on NBC. The series avoided cancellation last season through a combination of eritieal acclaim and former NBC president Kevin Heilly's good faith and now it has an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series to add to its comedy clout. 
Tonight's f1pisode follows the east and erew or "TGS" as everyone returns from hiatus. I lead writer Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) spent the summer getting over ex­boyfriend Floyd, best friend Jenna (Jane Krakowski) starred in a musical version of "Mystic Pizza" on Broadway, and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) separated from his wife after he was photographed doing a good aet gone wrong. 
Tonight also marks the return of Jerry Seinf'nld to NBC and prime time. After boss Jaek Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) unveils his plan for SeinfeldVision, which will insert a digitalized Seinf'nld in every NBC show from "Medium" to "Law & Order: SVU," Seinfeld shows up in per­son to protest the exploitation of his image. Playing himself, he negotiates with Jack (Jack's favorite activity} and counsels Liz as she quickly self-destructs after realizing she is not over Floyd. 
By guest starring in tonight's episode, the sitcom giant has deemed "30 Rock" worthy. After all, from his own series' struggles, Seinfeld understands better than anyone the struggles to find an audience and appease network execu­tives. 
Seinfeld's blessing may not save the show in the long run, but it should at least pique interest in "30 Roek," espe­cially among dedicated fans of "Seinfeld." 
"30 Rock" has been given the NBC timeslot traditionally reserved for strug­gling shows. The series will hope to retain the audience of "My Name is Earl" while catching the eye of fans of "The Office" who tune in to the network early. If "30 Rock" can bridge the gap and keep the audience between "Earl" and "The Office," then it has a chance of sur­viving for a third season. 
"The Oflice" and "Scrubs" survived in the 8:30 time slot, but failure is more common than success, as shows like and sueh lovable and endearing charac­ters, failure to attract an audience is an exasperating mystery. Kenneth the Page should be incentive enough. But for now, "30 Rock" is banking on Seinfeld's appeal as it starts its second season as strong as ever.

"Inside Schwartz," "Leap of Faith" and "Cursed" all perished relatively quickly. But "30 Rock" has an Emmy, and those other attempts at sitcoms don't. In a per­feet world, an Emmy would be enough to save a series, but one mention of "Arrested Development" and it is dear that our world is far from perfect.

NFL 
Associated Press 
FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. -The Atlanta Falcons will try to convince an arbitra­tor the team deserves a refund on up to $22 million in bonus money paid to quarterback Michael Vick. 
The Falcons will be rep­resented Thursday by team president and general manager Hich McKay and three more team officials in the private hearing in Philadelphia. 
"I don't expect it will go beyond a day," said University of Pennsylvania law professor Stephen B. Burbank, the special mas­ter who confirmed he will serve as arbitrator of the hearing at the law school. 

Attorneys representing the NFL Players Association will argue against the Falcons' claim. 
An expert in sports con­tracts said the Falcons face long odds in their effort to have bonus money returned to the team. 
The Falcons are expect­ed to contend that Vick knew he was in violation of the contract when he signed the $130 million deal in December of 2004, and that he used proceeds from the deal to fund his dogfighting operation. 
"I think clearly it's a reach on the part of the Falcons," said Jerry Reisman, a contract and business attorney based in Garden City, N.Y. "I think Vick earned that money. He received the roster bonus given out if you are on a roster at any point. He was on the roster in 2004 and earned the money." 
Reisman said he has fol­lowed the case closely because it is an unusual demand by the Falcons. 
"The Falcons are claim­ing that if they had known of Vick's criminal activity on the date he signed his contract in 2004 they wouldn't have signed the contract and therefore there was fraud." Reisman said. 
1\cisman said under the NFL's collective bargaining agreement, bonus money earned cannot be

returned. 
Reisman said the Falcons are asking for the refund from Vick but haven't in turn offered refunds to their customers. 
"I don't know the Falcons have given back season tickets they sold," he said. 
McKay was not availabh for comment Wednesday. Team spokesman 1\eggiP Hoberts said McKay is standing by his earlier statements that he would make no comment during the process. 
On Aug. 27, Vick admit­ted helping to kill six to eight dogs and bankrolling the dogfighting operation that was based in Virginia and extended into other states. 
IN BRIEF 
Franchitti makes move to 
NASCAR 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -With an Indianapolis 500 victory and the series championship, Dario Franchitti believed the time was right to walk away from open-wheel racing. 
He'd flirted briefly with NASCAR last year, but a deal to move into stock cars fell apart when Juan Pablo Montoya snagged his ride. So when Chip Ganassi called again with a new opportunity, Franchitti could take it knowing he had nothing left to accomplish in the lndyCar Series. 
"We had conversations last year, and one of the options going into the '07 season was NASCAR," Franchitti said in a Wednesday telephone inter­view. "Then with Juan coming along, it didn't work out. And looking back, I am really happy it didn't work out. To win the Indianapolis 500 this year, and then the open-wheel title in my last race, it was a great way to sign 0ff. " 

Jocketty out after 13 years 
as Cards' GM 
Sf LOUIS -Walt Jocketty is out after 13 seasons as general manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, one year after the team won the World Series for the first time since 1982. 
Team president Mark Lamping said Jocketty's departure with a year remain­ing on his eontract wa<> a mutual decision, and that he'd be paid. Team CEO Bill DeWitt Jr. said Jocketty and the Cardinals had "cordially and respectfully parted ways." 
"We were in agreement our arrange­ment had likely run it's course," DeWitt said. 
It's unclear how Jocketty's departure affects the status of manager Tony La Hussa, whose contract expired after the season. Jocketty hired La Russa in 1996. 
DeWitt spoke with La Russa on Wednesday, reaffirming the franchise's eommitment to building a eompetitor after injuries and ill-advised moves led to a 78­win team that eollapsed in the final month. 
Durant to fill shooting guard 
spot for Sonics 
SEATTLE Kevin Durant grabbed outlet passes. He stepped out and fed post players who were running down the middle of the floor. 
When he did go inside, he soared to the baseline for a rebound over Wally Szczerbiak, the veteran small forward who at 6-foot-7 is two inch­es shorter but far more bulky than the teenager with the body of a greyhound. 
"Way to go, KD!" an assistant coach yelled, proving Durant had an NBA nickname even before his first practice with the Seattle SuperSonics on Tuesday. 
The one time he was in the middle during a fast-break drill that ended the 90-minute session, Durant rose above the rim with both hands clutching the ball. Yet instead of dunking, he simply and smoothly dropped the ball through the hoop.

Associated l'ress 
OHCHAIW PAHK -Bills rookh~ Trent Edwards will make his second straight start wlwn Buffalo hosts Dallas on Monday night after J.P. l.osrnan missed praetice Wednesday. 
Coach l>i('k Jauron ruled l.osman out. saying the quar­terback is recovering steadily from a sprained left knee but it's not dear when he'll be able to resunw practieing with the tnam. 
Losman has been out since he was hurt during the first series of a :~S-7 loss at Nnw England on Snpt. 23. 
Edwards was inconsistent standing in for Los man against the Patriots, but

Jauron continued to sidestep questions about whether l.osman would get his job back. 
"The response to that ques­tion has always been the same for me, and it has been for a numbor of years: Any position on our t_na.~ is up for ~ra?.s. It always IS, Jauron sa1d. The best guy will be the guy that plays. Otlwr than that, Uwrn's not a whole lot to say about that position right now because J.P. isn't abln to prac­tiee." 
The Bills enter their bye wnnk aftor playing Dallas, and thon host Baltimore on Oct. 21. 
Edwards is attempting to kenp an even keel in preparing for a prime-limn game. 

"It's dofinitely been a fun expEHionce so far. I never thought it would happen this quickly for me. But that's the way tho pieces fall some­times," ho said. "I am going to just try and keep doing my job. I know I still have a lot to learn." 
HuiTalo remains a banged-up team as it prepared to host its first Monday night game sinee Sept. 26, I 994. 
Backup safety Jim Leonhard (calf") and reserve linebacker Kevin Harrison (knee) were ruled out after both were hurt last weekend. Heserve corner­back Ashton Youboty's status is uncertain after he missed praclicn with an ankle injury also sustained against the Jets. 
That further dnpletes a defense that already has three starters on the season-ending injured reserve list. And that doosn't inelude reserve defen­sive end Hyan Denney (broken fool) and reserve linebacker Coy Wire (sprained knee). both or whom aren't expected back until aner the bye. 
Starting linebacker Keith Ellison practiced Wednesday for the first time since hurting 
his knee in Buffalo's pre­season finale, but it's not elear whether he 'II be ready to play Monday. 
The Bills could get back one player on Sunday: reserve defen­sive end Anthony Hargrove, 
who finished serving the NFL's four-game suspension for vio­lating tho league's substanen abuse policy. 
The Bills have not yet decid­ed to activate Hargrove, although he has returned to praeticn. The Bills have until Monday afternoon to make a dneision whether to activate or release llargrove. 
Jauron said he's pleased that Hargrove stayed in condition while he was suspended, but added the player is not yet in game shape. 
"We're pulling for him," Jauron said. "He's a very lik­able guy, a guy you want to have everything to go well for him. We're in his corner." 
Hargrove said he'll be play­ing after he practiced with the Bills first special teams unit. 
"Look for me. If we're kick­ing off l"irst, I'll be out there getting this thing bumping and jumping," Hargrove said. "Monday night, prime-time TV: That's. nothi~.g but setting the stage lor me. 
And he was thankful the Bills stuek by him during his sus­pension. 
"This is a gift. Not everybody gels to play this game," he said. "They gave me a second chance. They believe in me. And I don't want to let them down." 
llargrove still faces potential trouble from a confrontation he had with police outside a Hoehester nightelub during training camp in August. Hargrove has pleaded not guilty to three misdemeanors and is next seheduled in court on Oet. 11.

"All that has undoubtedly cre­ated some communications problems that may have slowed down a final decision," said Bonds' attorney, Michael Hains. "We find ourselves in a holding pattern." 
Schools declined to comment Wednesday on the status of the Bonds investigation, which fol­lowed Bonds' 2003 testimony in the BALCO investigation. 
According to grand jury tran­scripts obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle, Bonds said he thought two substances given to him by trainer Greg Anderson were flaxseed oil and an arthritic balm. Authorities suspect those items were actu­ally "the clear" and "the cream," two performance­enhancing drugs linked to the Bay Area Laboratory Co­Operative. 
Two grand juries have spent the past three years trying to determine whether Bonds was lying under oath. And Anderson has spent a total of about a year in federal prison as authorities try to compel him to testify against Bonds, a childhood friend. 
Anderson will remain locked up until he talks, the grand jury's term expires or the judge who sent him to prison decides to set him free. 
"Greg is going to spend his third Christmas in prison," said Anderson's attorney, Paula Canny. 
Anderson previously served three months in prison during the winter of 2005 after plead­ing guilty to illegally selling steroids. Canny said her client will never talk, and she's not optimistic that the judge will turn him loose anytime soon. 
Another vital prosecution wit­ness is Kimberly Bell, Bonds' former mistress. She told the BALCO grand jury in 2003 that Bonds told her he took steroids and that the slugger and Anderson would disappear into a locked bedroom on occasional mornings during spring training in 1999. 
"On top of that, I saw all the effects," Bell said. 


Bonds' former personal trainer is still languishing in prison for refusing to testify before a grand jury considering perjury and other charges against the slugger. And the panel hasn't even met in two months, even though prosecutors extended its term in July by at least three months and as many as six months. His lawyer and others

U.S. attorney and chief Bonds prosecutor Kevin Ryan. 
San Francisco lawyer Joseph Russoniello, who long ago cleared an FBI background check, is expected to replace Hyan, but President Bush has delayed making an announce­ment. In the meantime, career prosecutor Scott Schools contin-He hanged himself last week in Phoenix, where he was under house arrest after agreeing last month to plead guilty in a plot to extort more than $1 million from Tom Cruise for the actor's stolen wedding photos. 

"I think it is something that can be used to impeach her credibility," Rains said of Bell's Playboy deal. "It is probably just one more piece of impeach­ing information for someone who has already filled three banker's boxes in my office with impeaching information." 
Rains said Bell is miffed that Bonds didn't pay her the nearly $200,000 she demanded when their 10-year relationship ended in 2003. Bell said she was asking Bonds to keep a promise to buy her house in Arizona, but Rains said the demand amounted to extortion. 
He said he's confident Bell's credibility is damaged enough to make her a tough witness to believe. 
"They have tried to turn over every possible stone to prove a perjury case against Barry," Rains said. 'They don't have it. The government needs to move on to stalk someone else." 
The 37-year-old Bell said it was obvious Bonds was doing steroids -his head grew big­ger, he developed acne and his testicles shrank. 
"There was a dramatic shift in his personality," Bell said. She declined to say if she has been called before the grand jury conducting the perjury probe. 
Bell did say she's declined to help Major League Baseball's steroids investigator, former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell. 
"I haven't seen the purpose in it," said Bell, who said she feared a further erosion of her privacy if she cooperated. "The government investigation is the one that counts." 
But Rains said Bell's value as a witness might diminish some­what when the latest issue of Playboy hits the stands Friday. 
Bell appears nude, wears panties emblazoned with Bonds' No. 25 and recounts her 2003 grand jury testimony in an accompanying article. 
Bell declined to say how much she was paid for the Playboy deal, which was brokered by her agent, David Hans Schmidt.

Because of an injury, Andrew Holh also did not play in last weekend's tourna­nw n t. 
"Hoth sprained his ankle in Chicago and has not played sinee," Bayliss said. "lie did pradiee for an hour with the team on Monday. We're hop­ing to get him ready for rngionals. The main goal is to have him at 100 percent when he does eome back." 
Bayliss said he was pleased with the way his team's newest players performed in front of the home crowd. 
"The freshmen are very tal­ented and they handled them­selves very well," Bayliss said. "The tournament was a good way for them to break in with the round robin for­mal-it didn't put as much prnssure on them. There wnrn a few times when the inexperience showed, but overall they played very well."

The Irish had not tackled to the ground during practice until the week leading up to the Michigan State game, when they had fallen to 0-3 after a 38-0 loss at Michigan. 
Weis said he derived the for­mula for this week's practices as a way to increase early-gamP productivity and energy. Opponents have outscored Notre Dame 47-14 in the first quarter and 101-21 in the first half this season. 
''I'm really concerned about how we start the game," Weis said. "So I'm trying to find another method to start the game bettm." 
Notes: 

+ Weis insinuated that fresh­man Brandon Walker will take over the place-kicking responsi­bilities this week, after the team miss1~d two extra point attempts and had a field goal blocked against Purdue. 
In a live-hitting drill in front of reporters Tuesday, Walker made three of four field goal attempts, while walk-on kicker Nate Whitaker made only one of four. 
"The one guy who missed one, he's probably going to be the guy who's going to be kick­ing," Weis said. "That's a pretty easy one."

Miller's second goal, which came in the 29th minute, was also unassisted. He picked up the ball a bit sooner than he had on his first score but made a nice move on a Wolverine to cut toward the middle of the field before firing the ball to the keeper's right and sneaking it just inside the post. 
"We wanted to really use our speed against their back line tonight because we felt we had an advantage there," Miller said. 
Notre Dame has been jump­ing out to quick starts consis­tently this season. netting 10 of its 16 goals in the first half. Miller attributed the team's early successes to mental focus exercises the players do before each game. 
"It really gets your mind ready to play," he said. "That's really important, it's kind of underrated." 
Irish junior defender Cory Rellas also picked up a first­half goal for Notre Dame, five include a plan for a new soccer sta­dium, located almost adjacent to the east side of the Joyce Center, a new tennis facility and the renova­tion of the football team's practice fields. Plans call for the football team, which currently uses three natural-grass practice fields, to have two Field Turf-quality artifi­cial grass fields and one natural ­grass practice facility. 

Irish coach Charlie Weis said Wednesday the main benefit of Field Turf practice fields is allowing the team to "practice outside regardless of the weather." It also allows the team to practice on arti­ficial surfaces outside when the team prepares to play in places ­like Baltimore's M&T Bank Stadium, where Notre Dame and Navy played last season -that have open-air stadiums with artifi­cial turf 
"When we played Navy last year and you're playing in the Ravens' stadium, and they play on Field Turf, you don't want to practice inside if you're playing [outside],"

minutes before Miller's second. 
Junior defender Jack Traynor started the play with a free kick from just outside of the box. Sperry made the initial save and stopped a second shot, but was out of position for the Weissaid. 
"But the other positive effect, to be honest with you, is it'd be nice to have the students to have surfaces they could use when we're not using them. And when you have grass fields, you can't really do that. But you have Field Turf fields, there'll be plenty of times in the year we're not using them that now, all of a sudden, RecSports could end up using them. And I think that everyone wins in that sit­uation." 
The athletic department has raised more than $68 million for athletic facility improvements as part of the University's $1.5 billion "Spirit of Notre Dame" capital cam­paign.

rebound. Rellas tapped it in for his second goal of the season. 
The Irish slowed down in the second half but kept the potent Michigan offense off of the scoreboard -despite a couple of good Wolverines scoring chances. 
"I think we defended them fairly smartly, it was nothing more than that," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. "[Senior goalkeeper Chris] Cahill looked very calm and collected in net tonight, and that's very impor­tant." 
The solid lead allowed Clark to empty his bench throughout the game, with many reserves playing a substantial amount of time. 
"The biggest bonus of the evening was having Michael Thomas back," Clark said. "It was a boost for everyone get­ting him out there." 
Thomas, a sophomore mid­fielder, broke his jaw earlier in the season and has been side­lined for several weeks. The doctor approved him to play a few hours before the game started. 
Sophomore forward Samba Tamba also returned from a foot injury to see his first action of the season. 
"Tamba still has to get fit; it was easier [for] Michael because he could still run," Clark said. "He lost a little fit­ness and mobility, but that will come back." 
Notre Dame will attempt to keep its perfect conference record intact Saturday when the Irish host West Virginia at 7 p.m.

Lyons vs. Lewis 
Lyons and Lewis meet tonight in a game that will be crucial to both teams' playoff aspirations. 
Lyons currently sits in fourth place of the Gold League standings, ahead of fifth-place Lewis by only a half-game. The Lions need just one win in their final two games to secure a play­ofT berth. 
Meanwhile, a win would propel the Chicks into a three-way tic with Lyons and Pasquerilla West for the f'inal playoff' spot.

Belles set for Hope rematch 
By SAMANTHA LEONARD 
Sports Writer 

Saint Mary's avenged last month's loss to Adrian with a five-set victory Tuesday. Tonight, the Belles will look to win another rematch, this time against Hope. 
Hope swept Saint Mary's 30-14, 30-20, 30-17 Sept. 6. Head coach Julie Sehroeder-Biek said she hopes her team will show the same drive against Hope that it did Tuesday over Adrian, which one month ear­lier, beat Saint Mary's 30-25, 30-28, 30-11. 
"'In our win against Adrian, we really brought our game to the next level," Schroeder-Biek said. 'The intensity and drive to win was amazing. We now only carry the confidence gained from that win along with the momentum into our Hope match." 
Hope, which ranks third in the MlAA standings, has a strong defense that will test the Belles often. 
"'Hope has a strong outside attack and they have great hustle on defense," Schroeder-Biek said. "'These will be the big threats to watch fbr in facing them." 
The Belles will look to eliminate the unforced errors that have plagued them in their last three matches. They average ninn servic­es errors per game during that span. 

"Consistent serving is our biggest weakness," Schroeder-Biek said. "We are definitely working on our focus when it comes to serves." 
Against Hope, Schroeder-Biek does not plan to make changes in the lineup that took down Adrian. 
"We have been bordering on this type of play all season," she said. "The mental game has been our battle ITom the beginning. Wn are making huge strides in mastering it and we ean't let up now -just keep working at being a great team." 
lbe Belles are 4-5 in league play and 7-10 overall while !lope L<> 6-2 in the MIM and 11-5 overall. The teams will face off tonight at 7 at the Angnla Athletic Facility.

WOMEN'S INTERHALL 

Phoxes look to keep rolling against Babes 
Purple Weasels look to get back on track 
By MATT GAMBER, 
EUGENIA ALFONZO and 
SAM WERNER 
Sports Writers 

Tonight's game between Pangborn and Breen-Phillips at 7 on Riehle Field features two teams going in opposite directions. 
While Pangborn's 13-9 vie­tory over reigning champion Pasquerilla West kept its play­off hopes alive, the Babes are desperately trying to recover from their 6-0 loss to previ­ously winless Lewis. 
Leading the Phoxes' offense will be freshman quarterbaek Gabby Tate. Sophomore receivers Annie Kotz and Meghan Bescher, the team's captain, both eaught touch­down passes last week. 
Bescher also had an inter­ception in the Phoxes' upset win over Pasquerilla West, as did freshman Kathy Poploski. They'll anchor a defense that hopes to contain the Babes' attack. 
"We've been working hard, trying to get both our offense and defense working," Tate said. "Our main goal all along has been to make the playoffs. 
so wn're pretty pumped to keep this thing going." 
Breen-Phillips will rely on its captain, junior quarter­baek Melissa Meagher, to rejuvenate the offense. She'll target reeeiver Tara McCarron, a fellow junior, early and often. 
"She runs quick routes, and she just always seems to find herself open," Meagher said. 
The Babes defensive line, led by senior Collenn Stehlin and freshman Kristin Moore, will hope to slow down a Pangborn running game that torched the Babes in last year's matehup. 
"Our coaches have IH~en prnparing for a wonk and a half by watehing !Pangborn's) games, so hopefully ·we'll be able to tailor our defense to attack their offense in appro­priate places,'' Meaglwr said. "They havn a strong oiTnnse. so we really have to focus on stopping them."
