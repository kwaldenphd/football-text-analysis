Forest lecture pays tribute to Dorthy Day 
By KATE STEER 
Associ:ue News Ediror 
To lead a life according to the life of God is the greatest thing we can do, said Jim Forest of the Orthodox Peace Fellowship in a talk about Dorothy Day Tuesday evening. 
Forest, who served in Day's Catholic Worker Houses for many years, recalled the words and lifo of the "trouble-· maker and saint." 
Forest first learned of Day and the Catholic Worker movement when he was declared a conscientious objector to the Vietnam war after participating in a prayer vigil organized by Catholic Workers as a protest against the Bay of Pigs invasion. Aller leaving the military, Forest devoted his life to helping oth­ers in the way that Day had established. 
"Iler basic message was, 'We are called by God to love one another,"' he said of Day. 
Forest. who has written a biography of Day, said that he is glad that people today do not receive a polished version of the person he knew. Part of what made her such an inspir­ing person was that she had flaws and made mistakes but 
was willing to claim them and 
go back to work, he said. 
"She will be not onlv the 
patron saint of the horneless 
and those who try to take care 
of them but people who lose 
their temper." 

However, according to 
Forest, hospitality was a 
trademark of Day's Catholic 
Worker philosophy. 

"She said that hospitality is 
simply practicing God's mercy 
to those around us," he said. 
"There is not only hospitality 
of the door, but also of the face 
and the heart." Hospitality 
includes not only taking in 
those who need shelter, food 
and clothing, but also those 
who are difficult to take in, 
including one's own enemies. 
This philosophy extended to 
the members of the movement 
as well. 

The people who make up the 
Catholic \\forker movement are strong and strong-willed, and every day in service is a struggle to maintain civility -and one's own ideals, Forest 
said. 

"One of the miracles of 
Dorothy's life is that she 
remained part of a conflict­
torn life for nearly a half cen­
tury," he said.

Roche: questioning religion leads to faith 
maintaining an open frame of mind in regard to religion, call­ing internal questioning of faith "healthy," especially when used as "an opportunity to measure the validity of one's own reli­gion." 
"I absolutely endorse the idea that a loss of faith or the criti­cism of faith can ultimately strengthen [it]." he said. 
He highlighted the existence of other faiths, such as the funda­mentalist and sociological per­spectives. 
The fundamentalist perspec­tive emerges amid a crisis of faith and is generally a radically conservative view of religion. 
"There is no tolerance of a secular position that contradicts the religious," Roche said of this view, claiming that this position "produces tremendous conflict." 
The sociological perspective, he said, has much in common with skepticism. This school of Lhought recognizes the impor­tance of the moral component of religion but discredits the importance of faith and the divine. Roche further explained the sociological perspective as wanting to "use religion for alte­

TheNever­Ending Story: Election 2000 

By KIFLIN TURNER 
News Writer 

One week has passed since the contro­versial presidential election and the country is still eagerly awaiting the results. With Florida hanging in the bal­ance, the candidates are in a heated bat­tle over whether Florida ballots should be recounted. Circuit Judge Terry Lewis upheld the 5 p.m. deadline yesterday for the Florida recount originally set by Florida Republican Secretary of Statfl. Katherine Harris. 
The Gore campaign vowed to chal­lenge the decision, as stated by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. The halt in the recount is expected to 
confirm Bush the vic­ 
tor by 388 votes according to an unof- See Also

had on society. Especially alarming is  page9  
the possible aftermath  

of the lengthy election process on the future of the Electoral College as well as on financial markets. 
"I see it as an index of the system working not malfunctioning," said Donald Kommers, concurrent professor in the Notre Dame Law School, on the issue ofthe extended elections. 
With the elections dragging on for days, many Americans have voiced con­cern over the constitutionality of the Florida recount, as well as over the inci­dents that have occurred in various Floridian counties 
"The [further away] we keep getting from the election it seems like people are more frustrated; it's starting to look real­ly petty among the candidates," said Susan Alexander, associate professor of sociology at Saint Mary's. 
Many voters are having a difficult time accepting the voting delay, said Sean Savage, Saint Mary's associate professor of political scicne. 
"Generally Americans expect much more of an immediate, specific response or the majority will than they did more than 200 years ago when the Electoral College was developed and instituted," Savage said. 
Kommers agreed. 

"These people have no historical sense," he added. "When the Electoral College functioned during the early 19th Century it was really days and weeks before anyone knew who was going to be elected. I guess we feel differently because of modern technology." 
"From the polls I've seen so far about two-thirds of all Americans say they

Intellect and religion can mix, said Mark Roche, dean of the College of Arts and Letters in a lectured titled "Religion and Intellectuals" Tuesday. 
"The idea that intellectuals cannot be religious ... is irra­·tional and embarrassing," Roche 
said. 
Approximately 25 students and 
professors attended the talk held 
at the Ilesburgh Library Lounge. 
According to Roche, most peo­ple initially hold a position of "simple faith." He characterized this perspective as one of total acceptance of a -religion, as a "moment of na'ive piety." 
"Most of us at Notre Dame 
have been raised in a religious 
household and we don't initially 
question our religious beliefs," 
he said.

some aspects of this position on

Be nice to me, I'm sick. 
I hate being sick.

Then after battling the flu for a week, I was diagnosed with Pneumonia. I have been sick before, but it has never really affected my lungs. There is no feeling that can compare to the terror that pulsates through your body when you cannot grab your breath to walk to the bathroom. or find the air to speak. 
My first couple or days in quarantine were extremely miserable. I was in and out of the EH and doctor's office and scared to death. I didn't really move too much from my bed except to go to the restroom and to Health Services. And I really didn't want to move either. 
It was extremely lonely. 

I never had a television in my room, I was never in my dorm room enough to really sit and watch it. I tried to read and color to keep myself entertained. However, after only two days of sitting and staring at the wall. I real­ized I was not St. Clare of Assisi and I broke down and had my friends get me a small TV. And the next day. there was cable. And it was good. 
My friends always joked that all Health Services can offer regarding medical care are popsides. But I am thankful because lucky for me, the popsicles are buddy pops -you know, the ones with two sticks you break and share with a buddy? Those popsicles gave me an excuse not only to venture out of my room, but also share some time and popsicle good­ness with a friend. 
It amazes me how people have come to visit me during this whole ordeal. And, 1thank them. My friends did everything from smug­gling dining hall food to helping me find my remote. Some even offered to vaccuum my 11oor and iron my pajamas stating, "!Icy, what are friends for?" 
So, now a few weeks later I am still sick and counting off the days until I can go home for Thanksgiving. 1am ready. I long for my own bed and I crave my dad's special camp­bell's soup. I want my mommy. 

You might recognize my name as the per­son who begs people not to smoke, and not to eat saccharin and sorbitol. Yeah, even us health freaks get sick. And, I am afraid that all of the ginseng and echinacea will not cure me. I just need more time, more prescriptions -and hopefully, more popsicles. 
Oh yes, and if you haven't been vaccinated ycit, plciase do so. Being sick is no fun. Especially if'you don't have a TV.

Nashville native Robert Ammarell remains in the Miami Valley Regional Hospital for treatment for smoke inhalation. College Corner firefighters, who were called in to assist the Oxford Fire Department, found Ammarell unconscious in the third-floor bathroom using a thermal-imaging camera to "see" through the billow­ing black smoke. The zoology major was carried out ol' the building and airf1ighted to Miami Valley in critical condition. Ammarell did regain consciousness and was upgraded to serious condition late Friday evening.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 
Study shows nicotine targets brain 
Funded by smokers themselves, researchers havo found that nicotine degenerates the part of the brain that controls sexual arousal, emotional control and HEM sleep. Nicotine causes degeneration in one part of the brain, according to University of California-Los Angeles profes~or of psychology Gaylord Ellison. who announced the finding in the journal Neuropharmacology, and at this year's meeting of the Society for Neuroscience. Ellison found that nico­tine causes selective degeneration of the fasciculus retroflexus, the part of the higher brain that primari­ly controls the dopamine and serotonin levcils in the body.Dopamine controls movement, emotional response, and the ability to experience pleasure and pain, while serotonin regulates a person's mood. In past research, Ellison's team has shown that drugs such as amphetamines, cocaine and ecstasy damage one half of the fasciculus retrol'lexus. but new research shows that nicotine affects the other half.

Koestner: date rape is an important ~ue on college campuses 
By COLLEN McCARTHY Associate N,:ws Editor 
When Katie Koestner began college in the fall ol' 1990 at the College of William and Mary in Virginia, she never imagined that her plans for the future would have led her tu giving the speech she did before students from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's on Tuesday night. 
"When l started college I had more than a few plans, none of which worked out, and now rm standing here in front of all of you," Koestner said. 
Koestner's life was changed in the fall of her freshman year when she was raped by a fellow student she had been dating casually. After going on a date with the student named Peter. Koestner invited him buck to her dorm room with the intentions of dancing. However. Peter had other plans. At one point while in her room. she turned around and saw he was in only his boxers and socks. 
Koestner acknowledged that she did not think she was sending him a message that she wanted to have sex with him just because she invited him back to her room. 
"Some might say that I was naive." said Koestner. "l guess I was naive if your definition of naive is someone who thinks that you can like some­I did that, and started to fall one, be in a room alone with asleep, I l:ould feel him and he someone and not havfl sex." started to kiss me and I said

Perhaps what brought Day through such a dedicated and controversial life was her devotion to her religion. "While she was one of the freest persons in our society, she was also one of the most disciplined. especially in her religious life," Forest said. She didn't let a day pass-without recognizing the Blessed Sacrament. 
She prayed her way through many maJor life events from her conversion to the birth of a daughter out of wedlock to the collapse of' her common-law marriage, Forest said. 
Her inl1uence·on the lives of' others continues today, as the Catholic Worker movement continues to work to help those in need. Forest said that every day he is reminded of

rior purposes." 
In order to attain a more moderate view of faith and religion, he suggested combin­ing favorable aspects of each perspective. This perspective would lack the blind accep­tance of one's own religion but recognize the inherent virtues of religion. Additionally, Hoche maintained that it would allow religion to be weighed against reason, while recognizing its contributions to society. 
her effect on his own lif'e. 
"She made me more capable of seeing beauty where I would have seen rubbish." 
Day has made Forest think more about the words of Christ than anyone else, he said. 
"Every time I open the door to a guest is partly because of Dorothy Day. Every time I think about things in the bright light of the gospel rather than the dim light of politics and money is partly because of Dorothy Day. Every time I try to overcome mean­ness and selfishness rising up in myself' is partly because of Dorothy Day. Every lime I resist the impulse to buy something I can get along without and use the money for some better purpose is partly thanks to Dorothy Day. Every time I try to see Christ's pres­ence in a stranger, there again I O\Ve a debt to Dorothy Day." 
The talk was sponsored by Pax Christi. 
Hoche said that this perspec­tive is a major component of the world's major religions, especially Christianity. He praised Notre Dame as an institution that embraced this view. 

"Notre Dame tries to help students to develop a philoso­phy of faith which is why it's a good place to have a crisis of faith," Roche said. 
Roche encouraged his audi­ence to continue to reflect on the issues behind religion and intellectualism. 

"With grace I think that we today can find a path that brings together reason and faith in a productive way.

would rather have the count be 
accurate than quick, and so far 
Americans have been patient 
with the whole process," said 
Savage. "As a consequence of all 
this. we'll probably have the 
Electoral College subjected to 
the greatest scrutiny ever, espe­
cially in modern century." 

If in the event Democrat presi­dential candidate Al Gore wins the popular vote and Republican candidate George W. Bush wins the Electoral College vote, there is a strong possibility that the · American opinion of the voting process may sour and lead to reform. Savage said. 
"I think we could have proba­bly the most serious effort in modern times to amend the Constitution," he said. 
Kommers, howevor, said that the efficiency concerns of the Electoral College and talks of absolving it are misguided. 
"There's a lot of exaggerated rhetoric over what this ail means," said Kommers. "I think the Electoral College gives the states, particularly the small states more clout in· the federal system than would otherwise be the case. So for federalistic rea­sons we should probably be in favor of retaining the Electoral College." 
Not only has the delay in elec­tions results sparked debate on the efficiency of the Electoral College, but the doubt of who will become the next leader of the United States has had specu­lated effects on the stock mar­kets during the last week. 
Former Secretary of State James Baker, representing the Bush campaign, said that the election confusion was causing financial market profits to decline, and that the market may continue to suffer until Dec. 18, when the Electoral College will meet to vote in the next president. 
1'1 think the presidential elec­tion situation is being blamed for a lot of the decline in the stock market," said Claude Renshaw, professor of the College of Business Administration and Economics at Saint Mary's. 
"But I think the real reason for the decline in the stock mar­ket is just because people are coming to the realization that so many com­panies have more than 19,000 ballots to bn thrown out due to the com­plaints from several voters who accidlmlally voted for Pat Buchanan thinking they were voting for Al Gore. 
Savage said that these errors may cause a national reform to establish uniform standards for voling processes. 
"I don't know if !the govern­ment] is going to achieve that kind of national uniformity, but I think at least at lhP state level, we may see each state trying to get greater similarity in all dif­ferent counties about what kind of system is used for voting," he said.

nothing new, and that the market had been showing signs of decline before the presiden­tial elections began. 
"If you look at the trend of the last several months, the decline in the market started and con­tinued long before a question of the presidential election came in," he said. "How do you explain all the decline that took place about 10 months before the election'?" 
Despite the prediction that the market would continue to dwin­dle during the post-election process, yesterday proved the idea false when the markets began to rise. 
Other election discrepancies have surfaced lately including a Florida voting mishap, causing 
American cit­izens who choose to vote in the future. 
"Even as close as this race has been all along. it did not make much impact on voter turnout, but the controversy now might make more of' a difference," said Alexander. With Bush recaptur­ing New Mexico by a slim mar­gin of 17 votes after it had been awarded to Gore, and the gener­al narrow scope of the elections. the voting process has raised more interest on behalf ol' the voters, said Alexander. 
"I do think it is making people far more attentive to the process," she added. "The actu­al strategy of' the campaign I think is largely going to be over­shadowed by the post-election strategy."

ISRAEL 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM 
Israel imposed a strin­gent blockade around Palestinian communities Tuesday in response to the deadly drive-by shootings of Israelis, paralyzing nor­mal life but failing to halt violence. At least three Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
The killings of four Israelis on Monday was part of a new "death on the roads" terror cam­paign by Palestinian mili­tants, Israel said. Palestinian leaders harshly condemned the army cor­don around the territories they control. 
It came as Prime Minister Ehud Barak head­ed home from a U.S. trip that produced no peace breakthroughs, and as Israelis and Palestinians braced for potentially widespread confrontations Wednesday -the 12th anniversary of a symbolic declaration of Palestinian independence. 
"The (Palestinian) state will be fundamental to peace in the Middle East," Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat declared upon his return to Gaza Tuesday from an Islamic summit in Qatar. 
Arafat, who was in exile when he first declared Palestinian independence on Nov. 15, 1988, has repeatedly promised that statehood would arrive this year. Some Palestinians have called for a unilateral declaration Wednesday. 
But with the peace process derailed by vio­lence, no such move is planned, Palestinian lead­ers said. Israel, mean­while, has warned that it would respond harshly to any one-sided action by the Palestinians. 
"There will be no deci­sion on the Palestinian state in the coming few days," said Yasser Abed Rabbo, the Palestinian information minister. 
In Tuesday's violence, three teen-agers, aged 13­19, were shot dead by Israeli troops in the West Bank and Gaza, hospital doctors said. Israel, how­ever, denied that its solid­ers had killed the two youths in Gaza, calling reports of the incident part of the "campaign of Palestinian lies that have inflamed the territories." 
In a fourth case, Palestinians said a 50­year-old man died after settlers threw rocks at his car. The man was hit in the chest by a huge rock.

EL-AMAR 

Police fired live ammunition and pummeled opposition supporters with batons and tear gas in clashes Tuesday that left five people dead and 40 injured during the final round of parliamentary voting. 
In the Nile Delta village of El­Amar, 20 miles north of Cairo, fight­ing erupted when supporters of an independent candidate broke down-the doors of polling stations after they were not allowed to enter to vote, according to residents and police speaking on condition of anonvmitv. 
Four people were killed and five injured there. 
Hundreds of voters in Shubra El Kheima, in northern Cairo. also clashed with police Tuesday when polls did not open on time. Police, some on borseback, fired into the crowd after attacking the protesters wiih batons and dogs and using tear gas. That clash left one dead and 35 people -including children ­injured. 
Police blocked polling stations and fired tear gas at voters in the Cairo district of Maadi. In Hawamdiya. a district of Cairo, police detained 7 S people for election-related distur­bances, according to officials. 
"Is this the democracy thal (President Hosni) Mubarak is calling for?" asked Kamal Abdel Karim, who said he was stopped from entering a polling station in Maadi.

Associated Press 
After a week of suspense, a fistful of lawsuits and thousands of ballots counted, counted again, then recounted by hand, George W. Bush clings to a ten­uous 300-vote lead over Al Gore in Florida's decisive presiden­tial election. But the outcome remains uncertain in a struggle still careening through the courts and open to additional canvassing. 
"This is a pretty intense process," Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said Tuesday, his state at the center of a post-election battle unlike any other. "I hope this will be resolved." 
On that -and that alone, it seemed -there was no dis­pute. 
Of the counties where the Gore campaign has sought com­plete hand recounts, officials in Volusia County had completed them as of Tuesday night; Democratic party officials said they went to court seeking to force a recount in Broward County; and Miami-Dade voted Tuesday night not to honor the request, although officials said the Gore campaign hoped to overturn that refusal, as well. 
Palm Beach County officials stood ready to launch a full manual recount Wednesday morning. 
The politics were intense, the legal maneuvering no less so, since the winner of Florida stands lo gain an Electoral College majority and take the 
oath of office Jan. 20  as  the  
nation's 43rd president.  
The  current White  House  

· occupant, President Clinton. assured a gathering of Pacific Rim leaders in Brunei that the United States was not shaken by the election impasse. 
"The world can rest easy," Clinton said early Wednesday. 
ln a fast-paced series of developments Tuesday, Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris announced that Bush, the GOP presidential candidate, officially held a lead of 300 votes over the vice president out of about 6 million cast, accord­ing to totals submitted by all 6 7 counties in response to her 5 
p.m. deadline. 
An unknown number of absentee ballots remained to be counted by Friday midnight, Harris said.

I would have loved to have written this· column back in October on National Coming Out Day or even last week during our week of learning tol­erance. but there were reasons for my delay. My mother 
Marlayna
was just here for 
the Boston College Soenneker 
game. and I didn't 
want to write this 
Here We Go
until she had come 
Again
and gone. You see, 
it's about my 
mother that I want 
to write. Mv mother is a lesbian and I 
want to talk about that today. 
You arc probably wondering why l want to talk about this in such a pub­lic forum. To explain this, I need to tell you more about myself and my experiences thus far in life. 
My mother discovered that she was a lesbian when I was ten and subse­quently left my father, whom I lived with afterward. I didn't actually know why she left until about a year later. It was never really a big deal to me. I loved my mother, and it didn't matter to me what gender the people she loved were. 
But I wasn't stupid and I did know thal in my small town. other people would not be nearly so accepting. So I kept my mouth shut about it for another year or two. Then I started to slowly tell my closest friends. I'll say right now that l have never, in all of · the last eight years, had anyone react badly to my telling them my mother is lesbian. Never. Of course, until now, I've never broadcast the fact in a pub­lic forum. but I find the reception I've gotten thus far in life very hopeful. 
Anyway. 1slowly began to bring this fact into my public life. I gave a 
speech in my sophomore speech class 
about gay rights. I was proud of 
myself. I was also heckled by an 
extremely annoying guy. (Needless to 
say, not someone I've mentioned my 
mother's preference to.) By the end of' 
my sophomore year, all my close 
friends knew. 
Then, at the very end of my sopho­more year, two friends and I decided to throw a big old party at the beach. I asked my mother to chaperone, and she agreed. But she thought I meant both her and Barb. her partner, when l just meant her. So they both showed up to pick me up for the party. 
I asked my mom why Barb was there and she covered quickly and told me that she was just taking us to the beach and would leave then. I said that was good, because I didn't know how I would explain her. Barb heard that and it really hurt her feelings, as I found out later. I've felt bad about that for years. But she's a loving woman, and has never held it against me. 
So I wasn't ready to tell everyone I knew just yet. As I got older, I was pretty much ready to tclf anyone I liked. When I went to college, I decid­ed that it was time to be open about it. to say something when it seemed relevant. And I have. I've told more people around here than I ever did al home. 
My life, since I was ten years old, has been a long coming out of the closet. When we hear that phrase, "coming out of the closet," we normal­ly only think o!' gay or lesbian people themselves. Most people never realize that tlrn friends and family of gays and

But I had to learn to say to hell with

For a More Just and Humane World 

I got my first look at East Timur through the plane window while holding the hand of the girl sitting next to me, (Terrified of flying, she braved the trip to visit her mother who worked for the united Nations.) The mountain peaks of the half-island formerly part of Indonesia jutted through the clouds, 
After 25 years of Indonesian occupation ­full of deprivation and torture -East Timor was granted independence in an August 1999 referendum. But the Indonesian military and pro-integration militia did not leave without destroying virtually the entire country, 
Walking through the streets of the capital city Dili, you see building after building burnt out or demolished. People would point out where once had been a school, a business, their home. There is no social infrastructure; currently the unemployment rate is 80 percent. In rural vil­lages, people starve since crops cannot be planted because seeds and ox were carried away to Indonesian West Timor. (Many Timorese were pushed there as well and still remain captive refugees.) Timorese living today have faced great hardship all their lives. 
Perhaps the first (and only) time Americans heard of East Timor was when a U.N. peace­keeping force was finally sent to stop the destruction. Since then, East Timor has again become obscure to Americans -disturbing especially since in other nations like Australia it is a prominent issue. 
But Timor is on the other side of the world, and media cameras turned their attention to Kosovo and now Israel. They have "unmade" the struggle in Timor, but in real life it contin­ues. 
I worked for the U.N., teaching English to their local stuff. On one occasion, we climbed into a U .N. helicopter and headed for Suai, a rural border district. Militia still threaten the stability of the peace process, as we were reminded upon touching down. Be cautious. Don't leave town. A New Zealand peacekeeper was killed yesterday in a border confrontation. During our stay, conversations were often interrupted by the loud rumble of tanks passing to and from the border. 
We came to survey the educational needs of the area. One school operated, thanks to about 30 volunteers. One teacher I met, Rogerio, taught high school biology -from what he remembers; there are no more books. A univer­sity student himself, Rogerio longed for the opportunity to return to school and again be challenged. If he did not teach, his only other option was household chores. As one friend from Suai recently wrote to me, while indepen­dence from Indonesia was the first resistance, the struggle against educational poverty is the second. 
Another university student, Ajiza Magno. was forced to put off her education, making remarkable contributions in the meantime. Magno helped organize the women's national congress and even represented Timor labor issues to the U.N. in Geneva. Now she is travel­ing across the U.S., making people aware of her country's struggle. Come to the Hunger Banquet tonight {or Pangborn afterwards). lis­ten to her speak and the struggle will no longer go on silently.

I was more than a little disappointed in the University in their handling of the Tim Russert talk. It is not often that the students get to hear someone of his stature speak on our campus. 
What does the University do? I don't know the exact number, but it looked like they packed about 150 people in the auditorium at McKcnna, while a number that size was left outside. 
Those remaining either had to stand in the hallway or leave. To the organizers: Next time you get a high-profile person to talk, try to get a bigger auditorium.

seeds every small step in the tilled fields. Droplets of sweat poured down our faces under the 95-degree heat. The plants that were to grow from our work would prevent further erosion of the surrounding land. Twelve Notre Dame students on the Mexico Seminar discovered how demanding life is for many other people throughout the world. 
Sitting around a large circular table in a cold, damp church, the ND/SMC participants of our Chicago Urban Plunge, con­versed with two gang members from the local neighborhoods. Although the two young men left at 10 p.m., most ofthe group stayed awake until well after 2 a.m., discussing and debating critical social questions and issues spurred by the dialogue that night. Away l'rom the classroom-based learning, we breached real life subjects and formed opinions on how to improve our country. 
The experiential learning opportunities offered through the Center for Social Concerns arc an essential part of the educa­tional experience. For my first three years, 1was involved with various opportunities as a participant, drinking the nectar of knowledge. But this year. as a seminar coordinator, I saw others expanding their minds and broadening their life experiences to become more concerned, professional and analytical students. 
On the Washington D.C. Seminar, participants met with vari­ous government, non-government and religious organizations during the day to discuss international humanitarian issues. The topics included sweatshops, third world development, refugees, human rights accountability and the Catholic Church's role in global issues. In the afternoons, they explored the city: Arlington National Cemetery, the Smithsonian Museums, Congress and much more. In the evenings, they familiarized themselves with the different neighborhoods of Washington including Georgetown, Union Station, Adams Morgan and Dupont Circle, 
Now. more globally aware, politically conscious and familiar with the city of Washington D.C., the participants returned from a week outside of the bubble of Notre Dame, And, they had grown in ways that could not be measured by paper and pencil. 
Experiential learning opportunities help students connect classroom-based learning to real world problems and occur­rences. Through the Center for Social Concerns. students have the opportunity to meet the outside world during the academic school year or over their breaks. Whether it be as a summer service project, spring or fall break seminar or a study abroad experience, no Notre Dame student should graduate without participating in one of these formative experiences. 
Notre Dame is a great place for a college education, but it could become an even better place if everyone were to bring back and share the experiences which occur away from campus. We should sit down with a friend who spent a semester "around the world" or "down-under" and find out what the people are like in another part of our global community, what is unique about another culture's way of life, what his favorite part of the experience was. You may be surprised to find that there exists ways of life that are more appealing than the American way. 
I acknowledge that spring breaks on a cruise, summer jobs on the Jersey shore and skiing in the Rockies are incredibly fun and relaxing experiences. Our breaks arc meant for that -to recharge our batteries. But ask almost anyone who has partic­ipated in at least one of these experiential learning seminar opportunities and you will likely hear how enriching the experi­ence was. 
The seminars are fun. You learn about new and exciting top­ics, meet other great Notre Dame and Saint Mary's studenL,; and experience something completely difforent and novel to your daily lives at Notre Dame. Try one. It may be one of the most rewarding experiences of your time at Notre Dame. What do you have to lose? The beaches and mountains will still be there after you graduate. But these opportunities may not.

Cutthroat ratings weed out the weak, support the stron~ 
ABC relies on big-name movie stars, Regis scharisma to rake in millions 

"Sabrina the Teenage Witch." 
"The Geena Davis Show" seems to have a better chance of surviving its first season. The show chronicles Davis' comedic escapades as a single New York woman adjusting to life in the sub­urbs with her new husband and step-children. 
"The Geena Davis Show" premiered at 14 in the Nielsen ratings -the highest ol' all major network pre­mieres this season. Though it has since slipped out of the Nielsen top 30. 'The Geena Davis Show" is definitely ABC's strongest addition to the fall line-up.

Tired of hearing Regis ask "Is that your final answer?" Apparently the executives at the American Broadcasting Company are not. 
Originally adding an extra night of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" to their primetime line up (bringing the game show's appearance to four hour-long air­ings a w,iek) and premiering only three new series. ABC opened this season confi­dent that Regis and his 11ashy suits would carry them through the fall ratings. 
Within the first month of the season, however. "Millionaire" suffered a signifi­cant drop in ratings. hinting that viewers arc growing increasingly tired of the game show phenomenon. So does ABC have any life lines left in its fall line up? A recap of the network's latest attractions. and returning favorites should save you the call to a friend to find out. 
Surprisingly, ABC's most interesting hook this season is its inl1ux of stars mak­ing the leap from the silver screen to the TV screen. Two of these brave faces appear in brand new series -Gabriel Byrne ("The Usual Suspects") in "Madigan Men" and Geena Davis in the not-so-cre­atively titled "The Geena Davis Show." 

Byrne stars as the father in an inter­generational trio.of grandfather, father,

ers, "Spin City" has promised various cameo appearances by Fox throughout the season. 
Many of ABC's returning series also look strong, especially David E. Kelley's "The Practice," which has held steady in the eighth and ninth ratings positions all season. Sela Ward and Billy Campbell return for a second season of "Once and Again," which opened to rave reviews last fall, but has since dropped out of lhe Nielsen top 30. 
"The Drew C a r e y Show" is back for its fifth hilari­ous season and Norm MacDonald returns for his second ~-,, year of . "Norm " . Sitcoms like · "Two Guys and a Girl" and "Dharma & Greg" also continue to draw viewers. 
Ultimately, ABC's biggest blow this season is the tem­porary hiatus ol' '"NYPD Blue," whose 19 Emmy Awards have brought strong ratings for the past seven seasons. 
While ABC promises that the hour-long police drama will return this January for its eighth season. it's clear that the network's overall ratings have felt its absence since the new season opened. 
This fall, net­work executives and viewers alike arc left wondering if "Millionaire" will be able to pick up the slack. 
With ABC's fresh faces, new series and old favorites, Hegis should .have some help, but tun­ing in is the only way to be sure. 

Nothing to do? No excuse for boredom in South Bend 
Because of the Finnegan's bust and the pending end of the home football season, students have already begun to complain that there's nothing to do around here. I have one piece of advice for you pessimists: Get over it. 
You're in college. If you can't find ways to amuse yourself now. think what you'll end up doing in ten years. You'll be sit­ting around. watching infomer­cials. wondering what happened to your youth. 
There are a million things to do at Notre Dame both on and off campus. If you're the magical age of 21, your possibilities are limitless. Since most of us aren't, we have to be a bit more imaginative. 

if you've got access lo a car (or are confident enough to brave the South Bend bus system). see a movie. Go bowling. Forget the dining halls for an 

evening and try one of the million chain restaurants on Grape road. 
Out of money? Flex yourself a meal and get cre­ative with the hotpot. Put your VCR to use and watch a movie with your roommate/friends/signifi­cant other. 
Still looking for some fun? You may have out­grown the freshman dorm parties, but if you're really looking to recreate a Boat Club-esque atmos­phere, here's an idea. Overcrowd your room, spill things on the floor to make it sticky, purchase cheap refreshments, play the latest top-40 music, invite a few locals over and see what develops. You may be surprised. 
Get creative. You know, way back in the dark ages. there was a man who found hours of amuse­ment flipping plastic cups up on a table for sport. That sure caught on, and these days the game can provide a night's worth of entertainment and allow participants to develop great hand eye coordination all in one. Who knew that such a simple game would be so much fun? It's that easy. 
Still searching? Notre Dame offers a multitude of 
options for every crowd. Maybe take in a lecture 
from a visiting professor and make yourself smarter. Even if you don't learn anything. you can still brag to your friends that you did. The SUB 
movies aren't half-bad either. 
Visit friends in other dorms -even if it's cold out and they live on (gasp!) another quad. Or maybe you could get to know your roommate better. You'd be surprised of all the things you might learn. 
If all else fails, catch up on your sleep. Lord knows you need it. 
Once again, you're in college. Make the most of it. Complaining that there's noLhiug to do here on the weekends is like saying that polyester is going to come back into style or that the bookstore is going to charge a reasonable amount for books next semester. It just isn't true. So get out there, be cre­ative and have a good weekend.

Cowher weighed whether it was better to leave Burress in the lineup and allow him to play his way through his mis­takes. 
"That's a fine line you have to live with," Cowher said. "At this time, I'm making this decision because I feel like it's in the best interest of our team.... But nobody should look at it as I'm taking Plax out of the lineup because he's the reason why we haven't been executing." 
Warner to return to lineup Dec. 3 
Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS 

St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt Warner began rehab on his r!ght pinkie this week and is expected to return to the lineup Dec. 3 against the Carolina Panthers. 
That means Warner, the NFL's MVP last year. will have missed five games since he broke the finger on his throwing hand taking a snap from a backup center Oct. 22 at Kansas City. The original prognosis was he'd be side­lined 4-to-6 weeks. 
Warner had surgery on Oct. 24 to insert two pins into the finger. He'll be X-rayed on Friday after a week of thera­py. and the pins are due to come out next Tuesday. 
The pins are being taken out a week later than origi­nally scheduled. Doctors decided the best strategy was for Warner to begin therapy with the pins still in. 
"They chose to be a little more aggressive with the physical therapy." coach Mike Martz said. "With what Kurt does. it's important that (the finger) is very straight. 
That has a lot to do with how you throw the ball." 
Warner has completed 68.7 percent of his passes !'or 2,445 yards with 18 touch­downs and 10 interceptions in seven starts. He and back­up Trent Green are 1-2 in passer ratings. 111.6 to 109.0,

WTA TOUR 
Williams sisters upset with WTA 
Associated Press 
MIAMI 

Venus and Serena Williams have brought excitement and "a ton of money" to women's tennis, and the family deserves more of the WT!\ Tour's windfall, t h e i r father said Tuesday. 
"Venus a n d Serena arc not shar­ing in the revenues packages that the WTA is collecting because of them," Richard Williams said. "It's very unfair, and something should be done. I should share in that package too." 
Williams' remarks came in the wake of complaints last week by Tiger Woods about marketing rights. Woods 

didn't rule out leaving the PGA Tour if the issue isn't resolved. 
Speaking from Palm Beach Gardens, where the family lives, Williams said he wants an equal partnership with the WT!\. If the issue isn't addressed soon. he said, his daughters might skip tourna­ments they would otherwise play. 
"They might du a slowdown here and there," he said. As it is. the sisters rarely play in the same events. 
The impact the Williams sisters have made in tennis is comparable to Woods' effect on golf, Richard Williams said. 
"I look at it as being exactly similar in the exposure they bring, the tickets, the money they generate," he said. "Any place Venus and Serena go, they sell out everything, even if they play doubles. No one has been able to sell out a doubles match before." 
Bart McGuire, chief execu­live oflicer of' the WT!\ Tour, responded by saying all play­ers share in the revenue gen­erated by the tour. 
"The WT!\ is a not-for-prof­it organization, with the t Oll r ' S S h a r e O f re Ve 11 ll(' S being used for overall tour operations and the day-to­day running of' the tour," lw said in a statement. Mc(;uirl' said he's always willing to discuss operations with play­ers and their parents. 
The mercurial Williams has been known to make inflam­matory remarks. Last spring he said Venus might retire, 
but  instead  she  won  
Wimbledon, the U.S.  Opt\n  
and  two  Olympic  gold  

medals, teaming with Serena to win the doubles in Sydney. 
Williams said his family, himself included, deserves a share of television and other revenue. He plans to discuss his complaints in the next couple of weeks with McGuire.

"I was surprised myself' how well I served today," llingis said. 'Tm just enjoying myself out there."

Hingis lost her serve just

"This week, just like every week, the scenario changes," Davie said. "We are playing at Rutgers -the first time we have ever played there in that stadium, the first time I have ever been on that campus. It is [head coach] Terry Shea's last home football game that he is coaching in. We have players from New Jersey. So as always, those are the issues."

Irbh head coach Debbie Hrown is excited about the class of 2005 and feels they 
blend perfectly into the Notrn Dame program. 
"Speed has been a key qua! ity we have looked for and we have that in all three of these student-athletes." Brown said. "Another important trait is competitiveness and a will to win. All three meet that crite­ria as well." 
Corbett is a 6-foot-0 middle blocker out of St. Francis High School in Mountain View, Calif., which is currently ranked second in the nation and captured the state title in 1997 and 1998. 
A four-year starter for St. francis, Corbett helped the team compile a 149-6 record during her career. She was named Most Valuable Player in the DeAnza League last season and earned All­American honors at the 1999 Junior Nationals in New

Loomis  hails  from  Fort

she is slated to begin at outside hit­ter and opposite for the Irish next season, Loomis has the ability to play any position on the court. 
"She is an excellent blocker and has very good natural instincts for blocking," Brown said. "She is an all-around player with solid passing and defensive skills. She has never dedicated herself to volleyball full-time, but I think that is very healthy. She will be able to maximize her potential next season." 
Leah Nedderman will be the third Texan on the Irish roster next. Nedderman, who hails from Grapevine. Texas, is a 5­10 outside hitter who possess­es raw speed and natural ath­letic ability. 
"There are a couple things that stand out with Leah," Brown said. "She has very good jumping ability. She also possesses very good all­around skills, solid court sense and excellent communi­cation skills. 
"Any of her past coaches had nothing but good things to say about her -not only as a player but as a person as well." 
A two-sport star in volley­ball and track at Colleyville High School, Nedderman also played at· Grace Preparatory in 1997 with her sister Anna, who currently plays for Tulsa. She has been named the dis­trict defensive player of the year. district outstanding hit­ter and team most valuable player. also earning the team Heart and Hustle Award. She earned the MVP award at the University of Texas-Arlington volleyball camp in 1997 and

While narrowing down my choices. I saw tho campus, met the coaches and players and I knew that Notre· Dame was a really good fit for me.
