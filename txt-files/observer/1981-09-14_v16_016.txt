Mrs. Wilson denies charges 
Helen Dolan Wilson says published reports tht Cardinal John P. Cody made her wealthy at the expense of the Catholic Church are 'scandalizing" and make her look like a "kept woman." The Chicago Sun-Times, in a co~;>yright series that began Thursday, said a federal grand Jury is investigating whether Cody diverted up to $1 million from two unaudited church accounts to buy Mrs. Wilson a Florida home, a luxury home, designer clothes and furs. The Sun-Times said Mrs. Wilson is beneficiary of a $100,000 insurance policy on Cody's life, received a "secret salary" from the Chicago archdiocese but was never seen working there and lists her summer address at his mansion in Chicago. --AP 

Watt delivers 1report -card' 
Interior Secretary James Watt, whose appointment was 
vigorously opposed by environmental groups, says most 
Americans are beginning to hear his message that 
conservation and development can co-exist. "I don't think 
they understand," he said of his most vocal opponents .during a four-day swing through his native Wyom10g, "but we're making progress." Governors of w~stern states, where most of the nation's public lands are located, have taken a wait-and-see attitude toward Watt, but he received a warm reception Friday after giving governors his "report card" and his attempts to satisfy concerns they voiced in February. --AP 

Solidarity fights for rights 
The chief of Polands'sstatetelevision said yesterday the communist government would never share control over radio and television broadcasts with Solidarity, as the independent union is demanding. "We defend and we shall defend the indivisibility of Polish radio and television,'' Wladyslaw Lorenc said in a televised interview. "In the 20th century, radio and television are for social life what ener~y is for the economy." Solidarity leader Lech Walesa was JUSt as adamant in his demands in a speech in Gniezno, the religious cpital where Roman Catholic Archbishop Jozef Glemp was installed formally yesterday as the primate of Poland. --AP 

Begin discusses military trade 
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin denied last night chat defeat of the Reagan administration's plan to sell sophisticated radar planes and other equipment to Saudi Arabia would endanger a military cooperation agreement between his nation and the United States. The agreement, under which the United States apparently would stockpile weapons in Israel, would endure any outcome of the congressionsl vote on the $8.5 billion arms sale, Begin said on NBC's Meet the Press. Be~in criticized a published report which quoted an unidentified Defense Department official as saying defeat of the sale would jeopardize prospects for American-Israeli military cooperation. --AP 

William Loeb df.es of cancer 
William Loeb, the acerbic publisher of the Manchester Union Leader and New Hampshire Sunday News who influenced state and national politics for a generation, died of cancer yesterday. Loeb, 75, died at the Leahy Clinic in Burlin8ton, Mass., shorly after noon, said Paul Tracy, editor-10-chief of the Loeb newspapers. Loeb was well­known for his conservative views, often delivered in stinging prose, but in recent months he had stopped writing the front-page editorials for which he had become famous.

fair and basic principle to accept, yet thousands of Americans are fighting it in rallies and other SMC Executive Editor protests against the Equal Rights Amendment. · ___;__=--;~--::-="'----::---­
Since its March 22, 1972 proposal by Congress, iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii~~~~iiiiiiii~iiiiii 
some who have opposed the ERA have . . surrounded ~ the amendment with miscon-·--·-----~ __, 
ce~tions and even lies. Thirty-five states have ratified the amendment, yet three more ~eed to ag~ee b_efore the June 30, 1?82 deadline for r~tificanon. T~e snnple w~rd10g (Perha~s too snnple) states us purpose: 'Eq!Jahty of r~ghts, under the _law, shall not be demed or abndged by tJ;t~ U~ued States or_any stat~ on account of sex. Still, the ERA 1s often 10terpreted by opponents ~s to provoke fear instead of a reasoned disagreement to those unsure of 
accep~ance. 
Clanns of two-sex bathrooms, the decay of the American family, the decay of male-female relationships or the demeanment of the woman who chooses to work inside her home as a 
I. 

full-time homemaker all coming true as a result of the ERA's ratification are absurd. These are issues of pn·vacy (and governed by laws on privacy) and have nothing to do with the issue of equal righs in the public arena of American life, such as education, employment, the right to hold property, etc. 
Perhaps one may ar~ue that existing laws guard people from discrnnination (primarily the Civil Rights Act of 1964(, but the ERA has forced such a conscious examination of age-old stereotypes and sex-roles that abandoning the measure would be a crucial blow to civil rights of both men and women. Over the past decade, an awareness over the i~norance of r_estricting someone because of therr sex has ar1sen, and failure to adopt the ERA would begin the battle for individual rights all over again. There is a need to establish the principle of equal rights for women and men in the constitution and the ERA will. 
The amendment's focus has been placed on women (since women still only earn about 59 cents for every dollar men earn: the same disparity that existed in 1939) but both sexes can benefit. Men can also use the ERA as a legal measure to fight discrimination. It's obvious that the ERA will be used as an excuse by both men and women attempting to get jobs for which they weren't originally qualified, but it's up to the United States Court System to interpret and define the amendment in indiv­idual cases, a job the courts have enough skill to handle. Maybe the proposal's wording is too vague, and maybe the proposal will add more cases to the already clogged courts, but it's a chance the nation must take. ERA is the best shot the country has of fulfilling it's premise of equal ri~hts, and no other measure comes close to prohibiting sex-discrimination as efficiently as the ERA will. Americans shouldn't risk the chance of another measure like the amendment coming into the pill.lic's focus as clearly as the ERA has. It may not. 
People should be judged as individuals at all tiJ:nes with t~tal fre_ed<_>m to choose what they wtsh to do w1th therr hves. Any barrier on the vasis of the sex of an individual is inexcusable. Women, especially, have been barred from many fields due to· their (80 percent of women still work as secretaries, salesclerks, waitres'ses and at othe! lov.:-paying entry-level jobs), not any lack of 10telhgence or talent. Women with four years of college still earn less than men with eighth-grade educations, according to the 1981World Almanac. In 1979, 45 percent of all women worked outside the home, a trend that will continue as long as inflation soars. With the need for two-income families is also the demand of women to be able to realize their talents and be paid accordingly. 
All of these arguments for ratification of the 

Equal Rights Amendment are not new. Most of these ideas have been expressed in one publication or another, but society's unwilling­ness to change is stoppin~ ERA. Discrimination is still very prevalent 10 this country and, although it cannot be removed, it can be diminished. The ERA would be useful to both men and women who suffer, and will continue to suffer, and will continue to suffer, the painful experience of sex discrimination in personal careers. The ERA means Equal Rights for All.

Fr. Blantz: 'determined to maintain vocation' 
By HANK WAGNER 
News Staff 
Mention the history depart­
ment here at Notre Dame and 
one name usually springs to 
mide: "Fr. Thomas Blantz. 
Fr. Blantz, who often can be found in the periodicals section of the Memorial Library, has been on the faculty of that department since 1968 and serves as its chariman. 
Fr. Blantz, a 1957 graduate of Notre Dame, studied theology in Rome until 1961, during which time he was ordained as a priest in the Holy Cross order. He received a master of arts degree in history from ND in 1963 and earned a doctorate in philosophy from Columbia University five years later. 
At Notre Dame, Fr. Blantz has served as University archivist and vice president for student affairs. 
As chairman of the history department, Fr. Blantz repre­sents the department on the College Council and at the department chairmen's meet­ings. He oversees scheduling in the department, sets up and administers its budget and SU(>ervises the day-to-day acti­viues of the department. 
Besides his duties as chair­man, Fr. Blantz teaches under­~raduate and graduate classes m history. In an article which apl'eared in Notre Dame Mag­azzne last summer he said: "I feel about teaching the way Ernie Banks felt about baseball --it's hard to believe I get paid for it." 
When he teaches, he says, he attempts to impart data through facts, figures, names, dates--and attempts to get his students to use that data to arrive at their own conclusions. 
When asked rt he had any personal idols or role models, Fr. Blantz said that there were many, and specifically mentioned Father Thomas McAvoy, C.S.C. (former Notre Dame archivist and historian), Father Hesburgh (for h1s achievements at the University), and Mother Teresa (for her sood works). He said he espec1ally admired Dr. Tom Dooley, because of his great dedication to his work; a standard of dedication Fr. Blantz said he is determined to maintain in his own vocation.

the old slogan that "there are no atheists in foxholes''. Was it hard to find atheists in a pn·son camp? 
A: Yes it was, but there were some. They were self­espoused atheists or agnostics. 
They had a very difficult time keeping faith in themselves to endure because after all, faith is by definition the ability to believe in something you can't rouch or see or smell, and it

Purnima Bose and Helen Locher feel right at home during the Jth annual Breen-Phtllips Bathrobe Breakfast, held on 
the Pledge of Allegiance to our flag, and sometimes the 23rd Psalm as we worshiped together. Later on in '71 and '72 when we were put together in big cellblocks for the flrst time we would have a church service every Sunday morning. The vietnamese were very disturbed by that because they thought we were plotting something during the services. 
Q: Did you expen'tmce a kind ofRip Van Winkle effect when you finally came home? 
A: Yes, I certainly did. For exa~ple, little things, ·like com1ng home and learmng how to direct dial a telephone was maddening for me. Everybody's toilet water was blue. When I left home

beards so I had to reorient my thinking about beards and long h4ir as well. The loosening of morals was particularly distrubing. 
Q:Are you ofthe opinion that we still have seroicemen left back in southeast Asia? 
A: Yes. 
Q: What causes you to hold that belief? 
A: Well I just think the evidence is overwhelming. In spite of the fact that we can't hterally prove it, the circumstancial evidence is overwhelming at least. I don't ne~essarily think. that they are bemg held at Hanoi at least. We had a pretty good communication system so we knew who was and who wasn't in the Hanoi area. We may have left a half dozen men over there who had been tortured to such ~ mental state that they had hterally lost their minds and were beyond help.

The Natural Family Planning Program of St. Joseph County will conduct an informational meeting tonight in an effort to ·acquaint all _student~, faculty and staff w1th the1r annual clinic series to be held on campus this year. 
The meetmg, which takes place at 7:30 p.m. in the Hayes-Healey Auditorium, will consist of an explanation of the Sympto-Thermal method of family planning, which the program stresses, followed by a question-answer session.

Today Bloch's lung cancer is in to­tal remission and doctors say he faces no greater threat from the disease than does the average per­son. 
Bloch's frantic search for answers 
and the promise ofthe Houston doc­
tors prompted him to form The Can­
cer Hot Line; a unique information 
service he's expanding nationwide. 
In the year since its inception, the hotline h'as spread to Memphis, Tenn., and Little Rock, Ark., with programs planned soon in Fort Worth, Texas, and Gainesville, Fla. 
The Cancer Hot Line is staffed by volunteers who have had cancer or had experiences with the disease they can share with callers. Bloch himself works half-days, fielding questions from around the country. 
The other part ofBloch's program is the Cancer Treatment Panel ­medical experts who meet weekly with as many as four cancer patients and their families to review their records and sometimes suggest al­ternative treatment. The experts are an oncologist, a surgeon, a radiologist, a pathologist and a psyc­hiatrist or psychologist, all of whom volunteer their time. 
The panel has seen more than I00

and put the ball right in play. It was not a judgment call." 
Four minutes into the second half, the Billikens threatened to bury the Irish with an offensive onslaught that ended in Filla's second goal of the match on a pass connection from Olwig and All-America striker John Hayes. 
The assault continued for almost 20 minutes, with the Billikens peppering Milligan and the Irish defense with shots from point blank territory and Notre Dame unable to cross midfield. But out of nowhere, Irish halfback Mike Sullivan worked a give-and-go feed to Steve Berry streaking down the right side. Berry sent the ball ahead to Kahale and the vet­eran co-captain broke in by himself to beat Baker from 15 yards away for the tying goal on Notre Dame's ftrst offensive surge of the half. 
"Give them credit," said SLU's John Hayes. "Even when we went ahead they kept

The complexion of the match changed completely after Kahale' s goal. The rejuvenated Irish began to create scoring chances of their own amidst a spectacular sequence of end-to­end action that saw Baker and Milligan tested to their limits. Notre Dame freshman Rich Herdegen just missed connect­ing on a cross from Kahale with 
11:30 to play, while SLU's Hayes twice hit Milligan square in the hands during the final ten minutes of regulation while standing on the doorstep. 
After on scoreless overtime, the match appeared headed for. a tie when Hayes popped free on a breakaway with seven minutes left. Irish sweeper Ted Schwartz caught up with Hayes near the penalty area and went for a tackle. Blasevitch blew his whistle and everyone expected an SLU penalty kick, but the foul was on Hayes. Thirty seconds later, Blasevitch called a foul on Kavanaugh in the SLU penalty area and Kahale's blast mto the upper right corner gave the Irish the lead. 
Belden, Griffith and Bock,'' said their coach, Bill Meyers. ''They've never really had a chance to show themselves in the past because of injuries.'' 
And with the liberal substitu­ting Faust did, several other upperclassmen, as well as freshmen, saw their ftrst game action Saturday. ' 'All I want is to see our score a little higher than the oppo­nent's," Faust related. "I don't care about point spreads or anything. We're going to play as many people as we can if we have a lead, because the play­ers work hard all week and they should get that thrill of playing * in a game.'' 
What did Faust's stomach feel like before his ftrst jaunt through the Stadium tunnel? 
"I was nervous; I'm always nervous before a game. But I wasn't tight because I believe in those kids. I knew I had nothing to worry about." 
And it was clear from hearing the students chant "Ger-ry, Ger-ry," that their new coach is ftrst with them.

"We didn't play well and the other team did,'' said SLU coach Harry Keough. ''But it should have been a tie. A tie would have been a victory for Notre Dame anyway. The ref­eree had no business making either one of those calls." 
The Irish apparently got away with an extra man on the field after a mixup in substitu­tions two minutes later, but the damage was already complete as far as the Billikens were concerned.

''Notre Dame beat us to death physicall," said LSU Coach Jerry Stovall. ''They battered and bruised us. They are more physical than Ala­bama. They have good offen­sive arrangements and they move the ball well." 
The Irish offensive attack showed remarkable continuity with its new multiple system, despite rotatin~ quarterbacks Koegel and Blarr Kiel with the first unit. ''Tim and I can both do the job," said Kiel. "I thought that's what we might do, since that's the way the coaches ran our scrimmages.'' 
Kiel and the rest of the offense got their first call after LSU's third play, when Notre Dame's joe Rudzinski hit quar­terback Alan Risher, setting up Kevin Griffith's fumble recov­ery at the 20.

''Notre Dame is very big and very tough," agreed corner­back James Britt. "And Tony Hunter ·· he's the key man in their offense. " 
Hunter gained 49 yards on the ground and another 40 in the air. "He typified what the wingback is supposed to do," Koegel explained. ''He ran, caught the ball, blocked and acted as a decoy. " 
"It feels good to say I'm tired because it means I'm contribut­ing," smiled Hunter. "We felt we could confuse LSU by flood­ing areas well, and it worked.
