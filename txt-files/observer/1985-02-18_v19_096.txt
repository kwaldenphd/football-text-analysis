President Reagan, returning to the White House yesterday after a four-day vacation, says he feels justified making frequent trips to his California ranch because "you give up an awful lot of privacy" serving in the Oval Office. Reagan said the demands of the presidency accompany him wherever he goes. "And I look at it in another way -at my age, how many more years do I have to go to the ranch and enjoy the ranch," the 74­year-old president said. After enjoying warm termperatures and sunny skies at his mountaintop spread, Reagan was greeted by 44­degree, overcoat weather back in the capital.

It takes a lot to close ND 
Blizzard warning today. Snow, heavy at tirrJes, with strong winds causing considerable blowing and drifting sno11·, high around 10. 
The weather word wasn't "unpredictable" a little 
more than seven years ago. This weather forecast of 
Jan. 26, 1978 was 100 percent correct. More than 15 
inches of snow fell on the South Bend area that 
Thursday. 
The wind whipped across the campuses at an 
average of 27 miles per hour, causing drifts of up to 
five feet, and the average temperature was 27 degrees. 
From under this blanket of snow, which by the next 
day was 32 inches deep, neither Notre Dame nor Saint 
Mary's stirred, except for food. Both schools were of­
ficially closed Thursday, Friday, and Monday. This 
was the longest period in the history of both in­
stitutions that classes had been cancelled officially 
because of inclement weather. 
Besides the disaster of cancelled classes, a malfunc­
tioning cable caused a power outage Sunday, Jan. 29. 
Some dorms lost electricity, others were without heat 
or hot water. Roads were impassable, which kept 
much of the grounds crew working around the clock 
in eight-hour shifts. 
Almost a year to the day before this closing, the 
College shut down for the first time in its history and 
the University cancelled classes for the first time in 59 
years. Both schools clo'sed on Friday, Jan. 28, even 
though a relatively small amount of snow had fallen. 
Low temperatures and high winds combined to im­
mobilize the area with a minus-70 degree windchill 
factor. 
On this historic occasion classes and office hours 
were cancelled, and the ACC and the bookstore were 
closed, although the Rockne Memorial remained 
open. The Huddle tried to grill up its huddleburgers as 
usual, but had to close early because of a shortage of 
help. At the request of Father James Burtchaell, the 
university provost at the time, the library kept open its 
doors. "Conserver" signs were placed on the milk 
machines, but other than that, the dining halls served 
the students routinely. 
Last week 17.5 inches of snow dropped on South Bend. Winds raced at an average of 14 m.p.h. Last Tuesday they were at their fastest, a chilling 23.9 
m.p.h. And to the dismay of many students and facul­ty members alike, school went on as usual with only random class cancellations. 
As students trekked over mounds of snow, that rivaled the Hi mala) as, to get to classes, the dining halls, and the library this week. they must have wondered why. In 1967 students probably pondered the same thing. A blizzard struck the Midwest at the end of Christmas break but it did not delay registra­tion or the opening of the semester. reports in Scholastic reveal that there were major snow storms in November 1940 and January 1873. 
So what does all this mean? Was last week just another week that eluded the record books? Did these past storms provide support for school closings or just the opposite?

Dame Archives, it is obvious that the snow, wind and cold were more crippling in years past. More snow buried the campus, taller drifts impeded any attempts at plowing, and the air was raw. 
Then again, the University was increasingly more self-sufficient the farther back in history one looks. More faculty and students lived on campus; therefore, the hazard of the roadways was not as serious a con­sideration. For example, in 1873, the student-faculty population totaled only 720, and most resided on cam­pus. 
Besides contemplating the danger of staying open, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's could be considering the cost of an official holiday in 1985. 
The schools would have to pay employees more than their standard salary to come to work on such an occasion. 
Another major concern could be discipline and con­trol of alcohol abuse if classes officially were cancell­ed. Local liquor stores and bars reported drastic in­creases in sales during the three-day holiday of 1978. 
All of this is not to say that last week did not merit at least one official day off. Neither is the conclusion that Father Hesburgh personally should have closed the University. If there is any definitive statement to be made, it is that when you are wading through the snow, remember that students ever since 1873 have shared your plight, as well as your contempt for In­diana winters.

President Reagan's new budget proposals could have a serious ef­fect upon Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students. 
In an effort to cut back on the nation's budget, Reagan has in­troduced several proposals which would drastically limit the amount of federal funding given to college students. Among the various ideas is the impostion of a maximum of $4,000 per eligible student and the restriction of aid to those families earning less than $32,000 annually.

recently commented on the possible ramification of such legislation and on the effect it would have on Notre Dame and St. Maris students. "There is no doubt that this new budget will have a major impact on some students. Not only here, but at most private schools in general, it is likely that some students wh<J" wanted to attend these schools may have to reconsider on the basis of financial difficulties. 
"However, the impact will not be immediate. It will grow gradually. After three or four years it may become a problem but the people already in school will not be af­fected very soon," Sim said. 
"The new budget will haw an ef­fect on public or state s.:hools. Many students will be encouraged to attend public schools. This is good for these schools because it produces more students and in­variabley student of higher quality. And yes, the state schools can han­dle more students."

Funai said he hopes to have the petition signed and the referendum passed by. March 10, the date the constitution states the student body elections must be finalized. "This isn't a final deadline, however," he said. 
Tonight, Funai said he plans to go before the Student Senate for an official ruling on his plan. 
But Bertino said, "If he wants an 
official ruling, he can just call me." 
The petition may be available for 
signatures in a few days. "We've

all ready and we hope to start this

The petition will be taken around "mostly to the residence dorms," sai<;i Funai. "We're going to try to keep it away from the dining halls. People go there with their friends and it's tough to get their atten­tion." As of yesterday afternoon at 3, 
Healy said he had not heard of Funai's plan. "I think the election is over now and we have been work­ing with Rob Bertino and Cathy David (current student body vice president) to set up the new ad­ministration. We're working very hard in setting up an administra­tion for next year," Healy said.

The possibility of working one's

it really depends on the individual. 
Some people can do it and some 
can't. The opportunities for earn­

are not great." 
"You must remember that these are only proposals right now. It is up to Congress to go to work. They will take the budget apart; they will make changes. They will probably compromise on the figures, however." 
The proposed changes will apply to all students seeking federal assistance and low-interest loans. 
On such loans, the interest is waived until after the student graduates. Then after several months the student must begin repayment. 
"No proposals are aimed at par­ticular schools such as graduate and medical schools. They seem to apply generally to various students," Sim said.

The initiative section of the con­
stitution states: 
"A Petition bearing the valid signature of 15 percent of the -undergraduate student body shall cause Student Government to hold an election concerning the given issue. 
"If the initiative addresses the structure or organization of Stu­dent Government, or the activities of the University of Student Government, the election shall be held no less than two, no more than six, weeks from the date of the fil­ing of the initiative petition. If one or more regularly scheduled campus-wide electionsfall within the specified period, then the in­itiative election shall be held con­currently with a regular election. 
"If the initiative does not deal with the structure or organization of Student Government, or the ac­tivities of the University or Student Government, . the election shall be held concurrently with the next regularly scheduled campus-wide election not less than two weeks from the date of filing of initiative petition, even if this requires the election to be held one or more semesters later." 
the Urban Plunge is that of a very positive shock treatment. . . The plunge is a necessary attempt to of­fer something which students can use," said Bellalta. 
Bellalta said she finds there is a lot of social justice ignorance among students because of their middle-class backgrounds. "It is not the moral backgrounds they are lacking," said Bellalta, "the students need to be more inform­ed." The Urban Plunge, along with its new follow-up course, may pro­vide this information and offer students first-hand experience with the problems of justice. 
Bellalta said she believes the faculty can get involved in justice issues also. Saint Mary's has recent­ly joined an interdisciplinary Facul­ty Development project, funded by the Lilly Endowment, Inc. Along with faculty from six other col­leges, members of the Saint Mary's faculty will have the opportunity to meet and to discuss the American Catholic Bishops' pastoral letter, "The Challenge of Peace," and search for ways to incorporate these concerns into college life. 
"I think the biggest value is get­ting (social justice) into all the disciplines." 
Bellalta said she feels the key to the success of a social justice department would be to have an in­terdisciplinary structure.

Diversity is an integral part of good education 
What is an education? Is it simply attending classes, doing homework and thereby ex­panding one's knowledge of various subjects? Do we receive a "good" education by merely attending a top-notch school and doing the best we can? Possibly, but not likely. 
An education must be as diverse as the people and beliefs of the world in order to be valuable, or even viable. 
Why? Because the fairest possible judge· ment cannot be made without being informed ofas many different views as possible. 
So what Is a diverse education? It is mainly learning about as many different lifestyles, 
Michael Froning in the minority. 
values, beltels, cultures, and ways of doing things as possible. Institutions at which we can experience these differences play a large role In our society. To better understand how these institutions can provide a diverse educa­tion, it is best to examine one, like Notre Dame. 
Academically, Notre Dame is one of the finest universities in the country, yet it does not have the diversity many other top schools do. 
Racial, economic, religious and cultural di­versity on this campus are virtually non-exis­tent. Yet these differences are crucial to a true learning environment. 
Racial diversity, meaning black, white, red, green or whatever is necessary because it of­fers the experience of successful interaction in a stratified society such as ours. Sure, we can read about the different racial experi­ences ofour country, but the best way to learn them is to live them. 
The people ofdifferent races can provide us with the best insight and information about their racial heritage. In addition, professors of different races should be present because they can provide their insight in a trained pro­fessional way, thus complementing the stu­dents' Insight. 
The same is true of economic and cultural diversity. Experience to be gained from the 
different economic classes and cultures 
throughout the country and the world are 
best relayed by those in the particular eco­
nomic class or culture. Students and teachers 
from different backgrounds should be present 
in reasonable proportion to their overall 
percentage in our society. This would provide 
the greatest opportunity for others to learn 
and appreciate the different experiences 
available in our society and therefore,it is 
hoped, become as successful as possible in 
their interaction with others. 

Religious diversity among students and fac­ulty is imperative to a true learning environ­ment. For it is through the learning ofdifferent value systems and beliefs that we can reaffirm or reassess our own faith and values. And again, the best way to learn about other religions is to be taught by believers of that particular religion. 
This is not to say that these criterion alone constitute a "good" education. There are other contributing factors such as decent facilities, materials, and professors, not to mention financial security, all of which this University seems to have under control. Yet neither of these factors alone can provide us with a good education; they must be combined. Unfortunately, Notre D,!!me has a long way to go before a balance between these factors is achieved. But with all its re­sources, financial and otherwise, Notre Dame can surely overcome this major setback in its 
quest to become one ofthe most valuable uni­versities in the country. 
Therefore, to provide the true education our society demands, it is the responsibility of the educational systems ofthis country to take unprecedented measures to provide a diverse education for all who desire one. This means actively searching for, and recruiting, stu­dents and teachers ofdiverse backgrounds. In addition, it is up to the people of this country to demand a diverse education for themselves and for others in order for this to become a truly pluralistic society.

Peter's Chair has not 
been filled by the best 
Recently The Observer reported that repre­sentatives from the sophomore class had pressed Father Hesburgh to extend an invita­tion to the Pope to speak at their class' com­mencement. 
This initiative has certain brio. 
Commencement marks a significant rite de passage for students and understandably they do not wish to see the University use the occa­sion to scratch the back of some lack-luster person to whom the University owes a favor. 
Ann Pettifer 
guest column 
·But what of this idea to ask the Pope? I have 
some grave reservations which I would like to 
share with the class of'87. 
Let me start with an axiom that is seldom 
heeded by Catholics. Our tradition has been 
frequently susceptible to the election oflousy 
Popes: the doctrine of papal infalibility seems 
to have been designed to confuse our grasp of 
this truth. 
This century has already seen a papacy which ought to bring a blush of shame to every Catholic cheek. Puis XII's record before, during, and after World War II reveals a scandalous accommodation of fascism. I learned recently that the estimable, London­based, Catholic Institute for International Re­lations started as The Sword of the Spirit, in 1940, founded by English Catholics distressed by Pius XII's failure to rouse Catholics to the dangers of fascism. They were also disturbed by the peculiar fascination that fascism exer­cised in Catholic cultures. It is now clear that the Nazi war criminal, Claus Barbie, the Butcher of Lyons, used the Vatican to escape to Bolivia. His was not an isolated case. The Vatican "rat-route" was well known to fleeing Nazis. 
Ah, the opposition will argue, we are blessed at the moment with a charismatic pope in the Chair of Peter. Everytime some­one reaches for the adjective charismatic, I get nervous. It is a double-edged sword and may convey more than the person using it in­tends. We too easily forget that virtually every demagogue in history was considered charis­matic by those who blindly followed. I know that I would rather have a good and just pope than a charismatic one. IsJohn Paul II just? Not very, I am afraid. 
Anyone interested in learning more about John Paul II would not have to dig very far. Just try reading the National Catholic Reader for a while; its Vatican affairs writer, Peter Hebblethwaite, is erudite, orthodox and run­ning scared of this pope and of what he is doing to the church. Then move on to Heb­blethwaite's book, The New Inquisition, which describes the Vatican's revival of the inquisitional machinery and mt'thod. The book reads like a horrifying pot-boiler. The trial ofHans Kung is bad enough· yet one can't help feeling that the pope has met his match in the vigorous, clever and disdainful Swiss. It is, however, the trial of the elderly, diffident and scholarly Dutch Dominican, Edward Schil­lebeeckx, that leaves one in a state of revul­sion. We condemn such travesties of justice when they happen in the Soviet Union, why on earth do we exempt the Vatican from censure? 
Schillebeeckx's crime, for which he Is being hounded, Is to have published a book in which he claims that, on the basis of the evidence, the priesthood as we know it, looks nothing like the priesthood of the early church. He goes on to say that in the absence ofa priest, a community should not be deprived of the Eucharist, even if this means ordaining an available woman or married man, post haste. Rome is unlikely to settle for anything less than a formal recantation. The class of '87 must ask Itself whether a man who would sup­press the findings ofacademic inquiry belongs at a university commencement. 
Asecond problem very close to Islamic im­ams in his repudiation ofsexual equality. The American Catholic hierarchy was given their orders by the pope to oppose the ERA. John Paul II believes in all that dreary, oppressive stuff about men representing the head, and women, the heart and wives submitting to their husbands etc.. He resolutely denies wo­men the right to define themselves. Women are so weary of being told that the genitals with which we are born are ofparamount im­portance in determining Christian identity. We know better. Like most fundamentalist men (Catholic and Protestant), the pope closes his eyes to the sexual egalitarianism whichJesus promoted and practiced. 
In a recent editorial on the Catholic Bis­hop's pastoral draft on economics, Christian­ity and Crisis picked up on the Bishop's theme that overcoming patterns of marginalization and powerlessness is "the most urgent demand of justice." The editorial continued, "Exclusion of women from ordination in the Catholic Church is the most basic institutional instrument of marginalization still extant, at least in the western world · not because it denies any individual woman the chance to exercise sacerdotal ministry, but because it says that all women are incapable of full par­ticipation in the life of the Catholic commu­nity." 
John Paul II is not a totem, not an idol, for ours is not a cultic religion. He is a historical person carrying his share of prejudices and human frailty. A mature Catholic is a Christian who sees conversion as an ongoing process for all of us and that includes the occupant of Peter's chair.

Dominant squad 
B-P beats Farley, 45-32, to go 8-0 
By MICHAEL FLANNERY 
Sports Writer 

The streak continues. With a convincing 45-32 victory over Farley's A-team Thursday night, 
Breen-phillips'  A-team  ran  its  
record to a perfect 8-0.  
There  was  no  mystery  to  this  

contest. B-P simply outplayed Farley in every aspect of the game. Like every good team, B-P has a wide variety of weapons to throw at its opponents. Dava Newman makes a steal; Lisa Brown cuts for a back-door pass and a layup. Ann Curoe powers inside for two. These examples are only the begin­ning. 
Even the subs did the job. Valli Scott and Kitty Duffy came off the bench in the first half and split eight points, helping B-P take a 22­17 lead. This five-point margin was as close as Farley would get in the second half. 
. B-P blew the game open with eight quick points at the start of the third quarter, as Curoe and Kathy 
Saint Mary's swimming team falls to Illinois-Chicago over weekend 
By KATHLEEN NICHOLSON 
Sports Writer 
In its last dual meet of the 1984­85 season, the Saint Mary's swim team traveled to the University of Illinois at Chicago and suffered a 72-39 defeat. 
Although the defeat dropped the Belles' record to 0-5, the meet qualified nine team members for the NAIA National Competition in Indianapolis, which will be held from Feb. 28 through March 2. 
Freshman Jenny Pancratz won the 500-and 1000-yd. freestyle, breaking the current varsity record in the latter event. Junior Joyce Murtagh was able to capture the in­dividual 200-yd. freestyle event while contributing to the 200-yd. free relay victory along with team­mates Ellen Byrne, Megan Rafferty and Pancratz. 
Sophomore Kathleen Kennedy qualified for national competition in both butterfly events as she place second in the 100-yd. event. Freshman teammate Rafferty, in another outstanding performance, won the· 50-yd. freestyle which qualified her for yet another event at the nationals. 
Other national-bound Belles are team c'aptain Byrne in the 200-, 400-and 800-yd. freestyle relays, along with Anne Cushing, Margaret Mannion and Jennifer Veslick in the 400-yd. medley relay. 
Despite the Belles' disappointing team record for the 1984-85 year, Coach Dan Flynn feels that the team has shown great improvement over the season. 
"The season really is not a good indicator of a team's performance in an individual sport like swimm­ing," says Flynn. "The girls have been breaking records and we have almost half the team going to the nationals next week, so I am pleas­ed." 
With the nationals only a week and a half away, the team will be tapering down its workouts before 
It makes the trip to Indiana Univer­sity's natatorium. The Belles w:ll see some exciting individual and relay competition in Indianapolis, 
which may give them a perfect op­portunity to redeem themselves from their slightly disappointing team season. 
Hunter began to find room inside. Farley struggled, but could not recover from the outburst. When point guard Mary Borkowski foul­ed out early in the fourth quarter, Farley was left without its leading scorer, and any attemtped com­eback went with her to the bench. 
Farley enjoyed a slight height ad­vantage throughout the game, but was unable to exploit it. B-P was quicker and more aggressive inside. At guard, the B-P trio of Janice Monagle, Brown and Newman harassed farley constantly; on of­fense, they ripped apart Farley's 1­2-2 zone with their accurate outside shooting and crisp passing. 
In other Thursday night action, Walsh beat Lewis' A-team by a score of 41-25. Laura Gleason poured in 22 points for the winners. 
Pasquerilla East withstood a fourth-quarter rally to defeat Lyons, 35-30. Lyons scored 17 points down the stretch after get­ting only two points in the third quarter. 

SMC fencing team picks up win against Case Western 
By ANDREA LAFRENIERE 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's fencing team improved its record to 5-8 Satur­day in Cleveland, where it defeated Case Western Reserve, II -5. 
Coach Mike Weeks said he was pleased with the team's efforts and was particularly impressed with Mary Ann Castaneda's perfor­mance. 
"Marv Ann is doing really well," said Weeks. "She went 4-0 Saturday and has done well this season." 
The Belles had intended to fence in several bouts, but the other teams didn't show up, ruining Saint Mary's hopes of further improving its record at the meet. 
The Wayne State fencers beat Saint Mary's, 14-2, in Detroit on 
Feb. I and the Belles traveled to Angola, Ind., the following day, losing to Cleveland State,9-7, but defeating Tri-State,l4-2, giving the team a record of 3-5. 
At Oakland University in Detroit on Feb. 9, the· Belles fenced four bouts. Michigan-Dearborn defeated the team, 12-4,and Detroit beat the Belles, 10-6. The women took a 15-1 victory over Oakland but lost at Ohio dropping the team's record to 4-8. 
Weeks, who fenced for four years at the University of Penn­sylvania, went to the NCAA Cham­pionships his junior year and was an alternate for the Junior World Team in 1982, is in his first year of coaching. 
He cites the team's lack of ex­
perience as the primary reason for 
its losses. Team captain Castaneda, 
a senior from San Diego, is the only 
member who fenced in high school. 
The others began fencing at Saint 
Mary's as novices, practicing with 
the Notre Dame fencing team until 
they gained enough experience to 
join the varsity team. 
Like most of the team members, 
Castaneda started fencing when a 
friend encouraged her to try the 
sport. 
"I went to boarding school and my 
roommate was captain of the 
team, "says Casteneda. "She got me 
interested." 
Junior Ann Raney from En­
dicott, N.Y., also was encouraged 
by her friends to try the sport. 
"A lot of my friends are fencers, 

and one of them convinced me to go novice,"Explains Raney. "The people at Notre Dame have a lot of · experience, and they help us out 
quite a bit." 
Weeks acknowledges that the 
team has made progress this 
season. 
"We've been inconsistent, but 
we're improving with every 
meet,"he says. 
The Belles will fence in their first 
home meet of the season this Satur­
day at the ACC. Weeks was hesi­
tant to make any guesses about the 
outcome, however. 
"WE've got some tough teams fo 
face,"says the Belles' coach. "No 
prediction."

Off Campus, Alumni, Pangborn lead in hockey 
By KEVIN HERBERT 
Sports Writer 
As the interhall hockey season 

reaches its closing stage, Off-Campus finds itself atop the Krause Division, while Alumni and Pangborn are tied for the lead in the Corrigan Division. 
Off-Campus, with a record of 3-0-1, is maintaining a one-half game lead over Grace (2-0-2). Tim Farrell, the coach of Off-Campus, says he is not too pleased with his teams perfor­mances this year, despite their im­pressive record. 
"We have not played very well at all thus far this season," notes Far­rell. "We have been fortunate to not have played, with the excep­tion of Grace, a very good team so far." 
To try to remedy his squad's shortcomings Farrell says he has scheduled several practices. 
"We just haven't jelled," he says. 

"We have three practices coming 
up. I hope we can come together in 
time for Dillon and Holy Cross/St. 
Ed's." 
Grace, currently second in the Krause division, has been powered by the superb goaltending of Pat Chura. Grace will, however, have to pass Off Campus in the league standings to end up in first, a task which Grace team captain Mike Mulligan says he does not think his team can do. 
"I think our team will make the playoffs finishing second in our division behind Off Campus," says Mulligan. 
Holy Cross/St. Ed's (3-1-1) has been aided by the goaltending of Frank Latuda, but must win its re­maining two games to make the playoffs. 
In fourth place in the Krause division is Dillon with a record of 2-1-1. After Dillon are

Pangborn coach Mike Barry says his team will have to improve its defense if it is to defeat Alumni. 
"Our offense has carried us so far this year," says Barry. "Tomor­row night we will have to slow the tempo and improve our defense if we are to beat Alumni." Stanford Hall is only a half-game out of first place with a record of 3­1, its only loss coming to Alumni. Stanford coach Tim Connors says his team's outlook is hopeful for the playoffs. 
"We are a small team with good defense and goal tending (J. A. Lacy)," says Connors. "If we can keep healthy, we have a very good shot at making the playoffs." 
In the only Corrigan league game Thursday, Zahm handily defeated Sorin "We held a 2-0 lead into the se­cond period, but then the defense broke down," said Sarin's Ed Laboe. "This led to our ultimate 

defeat."
