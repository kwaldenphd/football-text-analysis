Notre Datne cotntnunity remembers Sept. 11 attacks 

By MADDIE HANNA A~sociate News Editor 
Sept. 11 was not forgotten at Notre Dame. 
About 150 students and com­munity members gathered near the Clarke Memorial Fountain Sunday for prayer and reflection on the fourth anniversary of the World Trade Center terrorist attacks. The event was spon­sored by the Department of Political Science, College Demoerats, College Hepublicans, College Libertarians and Women in Politics. 
Director of Campus Ministry Father Warner, who led the opening and closing prayers, shared the story of his visit to Ground Zero right al'ter th1~ attacks. 
"I spent about five hours look­ing at that rubble, that smoke and fire ... watching firemen as they looked through debris for remains," Warner said. "While I was there, I would have these firemen come up to me with dark, sunken eyes and say to me, 'This was a friend of mine's brother. Will you pray for him'?"' 
For Warner, experiencing the scene firsthand was essential to his understanding of the situa­tion. 
"It was an amazing thing to see the sorrow," hn said. 
But tho cernrnony was not entirely about rnflnetion. Political sdonce professor Dan Lindley analyzed the U.S. response to Sept. 11, saying his main goal was to increase dis­cussion on tnrrorisrn "to try and help people who dil~d on Sept. 11 and 'make sure they didn't die in vain." 
Lindley said viewing terrorism as a form of war offers a per­spectivn many people do not consider.

Everyday heroes 
For those students from New York City or the Washington D.C. area, and those who lost loved ones on Sept. 11, 2001, yesterday was a day of mourn­ing and remembering. I am from nei­ther of these

places. I have no

tims of 9/11. I am 
Wzre Editor
from Fayette 
County, Penn., 
about 45 minutes 
of winding, tree-lined mountain road 
away from the crash site of Flight 93. 
On that fateful day, America was at first confused, then terrified and angry, and all the while helpless. I am sure that millions of people in the countless small towns across America breathed a sigh of relief, believing they were safe, as they said prayers under their breath for those who were suffering in the big, far-away cities. 
As I watched, someone joked that no one would bother to attack southwest­ern Penn. If they thought they would destroy the United States' main coal and steel supplier, they were about 30 years too late. As soon as our quiet chuckles ended, the news broke that Flight 93 had crashed. It had crashed close. A feeling of dread moved like a shock wave from the site to the sur­rounding villages and towns. Many in the area thought that this was the start of a full-scale attack on every inch of America. It seems silly in hind­sight, but we thought that if the small town of Shanksville was attacked, then nowhere was safe. It was not until later that week that the coura­geous truth came out. 
The blood spilt on the ground in Shanksville is unique, set apart even from that of Gettysburg or the beaches of Normandy. The brave soldiers in those situations were prepared and trained for the horrors they would encounter. They awoke those morn­ings knowing they might not return to their loved ones. The 40 people who overpowered the highjackers and sac­rificed their lives were in no way pre­pared to become heroes the morning they boarded the plane, but their actions have placed them in the ranks of the bravest of veterans. 

The field where they crashed will . f soon be the sight of a memorial. But it will never be able to fully thank them.
t 
I I They overcame all fear to stop the evil and sacrificed themselves to save innocent lives just like theirs. And in doing this, they saved what had the
I potential to be the greatest symbolic 
t loss of 9/11: the White House. But I do 
r not think they thought of this as they charged the cockpit. They thought of the loved ones they called from the plane. They thought of the goodbyes sworn and hoped these would be made lies, not that they would be made heroes. I know my area was not chosen as the sight of final resting place for these brave individuals. It was fortu­nate that a bare field was chosen instead of a town, or even a house. But now that ground is holy. And it will forever emanate the one question we must all ask ourselves: would we do the same thing they did in that situ­ation?

Scottish team wins 2005 elephant polo match 
BANGKOK, Thailand ­Straddled atop hulking pachyderms and wielding long mallets, the Chivas Regal Scotland team clinched their second King's Cup Elephant Polo title Sunday after scoring a golden goal in overtime to beat Thailand's Mullis Capital, 6-5. 
Some 1,500 spectators came to watch the fifth annu­al charity game to raise money for Thailand's National Elephant Institute in Lampang, Thailand. The tournament was held near Hua Hin, 80 miles southwest of Bangkok. 
The game is played on a field 330 feet by 200 feet, roughly one-third the size of a horse polo field. A game has two seven-minute halves ­known as chukkas -with a 15-minute interval. Three elephants form a team. 
Chivas Regal, which won the 2004 tournament, was tied with Mullis Capital after the second chukka and scored the winning goal after two minutes of overtime, said Wanida Khunthipmark, a spokeswoman for the event. 
Squirrel kills Topeka power 
TOPEKA, Kan.-A squir­rel too curious for its own good caused an outage that left the Statehouse and other downtown Topeka buildings briefly without power Thursday, according to Westar Energy Inc. 
Company spokeswoman Gina Penzig said the squirrel got into a power substation and was touching different parts of a circuit, causing electricity to flow through its body and overload the circuit. 
The power went out about 8:30a.m. and returned about a half-hour later. Besides the Statehouse, two state govern­ment office buildings were affected.

Waltnrs said.

Thn cPrnmony indudnd an invocation and hnrwdirtion from HOTC Chaplain httiHr I'Plnr Hocca, the playing or t.lw national antlwm, and words from guns!. spnakm· r<'lirml Lt. Col. Douglas llmnphill, who shand with tlw audinnc:n his thoughts on patriotism aft<·r· snrv­ing in t.hn Army. 
"I hPiinvn WP can't just. allow rircumst.ar11·.ns to dPiirw patriot, or patriotism, or anything else for that matter," he said. "It is more bask and concrntn than thai." 
llemphill said children are taught about good and evil, a dis­tinction that blurs as they grow older. 
"lAs children! we wanted so much for truth and goodness to prevail that we almost accepted tho idea that tho world would simply evolve into a kinder and gentler place," he said. "Some of us even drnamed we could trans­form evil through our own human adions. Sept. 11 and tho events of thn last liwr years contradict that drmun. Cnrtainly God can trans­lill'ln evil. I cannot. What I can d() -what I have done -what you are doing -is to stand up to evil through patriotic servien." 
llnmphill called thn Notrn Damn nnvironmnnt a nurturing place I(Jr snrvi<:n whore the call to serve can bn hnard "nspndally dearly," noting campus landmarks such as tlw Clarko Memorial Fountain, lloly Cross Cmnetnry -where soventl markers signify "the serv­ieo of priests of tho Iloly Cross and Notre Dame community as military chaplains" -and the Basilica to prove his point. 
"At Notre Damn, the idea of snrvieH presents itself to us every day. The words on the east entrance to our Basilica of the Sacred llfmrt call us to service ­to 'Cod, Country, Notre Dame."' hn said. "And hearing the words 'God, Country, Notrn Dame,' it is dillicult lilr any of us who wear a unii(H·m not to think of a related call to snrviee -to 'Duty, I lonor, Country."' 
llnmphill also spoke of war vet­erans, both those who "served to the point of the ultimate sacrifice" and those who "returned home to continue quietly serving society." Several such veterans, including Ralph "Lefty" Guillette, were in attendance at the ceremony. 
"]Ceremonies like this are important! to show that the youth we have, that are so often degraded and insulted, care about being patriots,'' Guillette said. "Inside, we're just as proud of this country as we were in my generation. the 'Greatest Generation."' 
Hemphill spoke of the 'Greatest Generation· as well, and called the uniformed students in atten­dance to serve as their fathers and grandfathers did. 
"What makes this commemora­tion so speeial is this: if you look around, I think you will see next to you the people who will bncome the Greatest Generation. Your membership in the HOTC programs imposes on you a call to service that I think most of you have already accepted," Hemphill said. "It is as well a call to vigi-· lance. It is a call to responsibility. It is a call to stand and protect." 
Giullette, who served in the Korean War and wa·s wounded during one or two long tours in Vietnam -totaling 24 years in service -said he feels the Notre Dame cadets answered this call and will continue to remember why it is important to serve. 
"We talk about 'remember the Alamo,"' he said. "Now we've got to say, 'remember 9111.' That's the thing the military teaches you -how commitment and devotion ... always stay with you, you're born an American." 

Guillette, 75, said he undor­stands the community atmos­phere and spirit of service at Notre Dame -he is a student at the University. 
"I am so proud to be a part of Notre Dame's campus but even more proud to be a student at Notre Dame," he said. "l look at Notre Dame like the Marine Corps -semper li, always faith­ful. There's no middle road for ND or the Marine Corps, you either love 'em m· you hate 'em. You have to be a part of it to approeiatn it." 
Guillette and snveral othnr vnt­nrans tnarnd up at snvnral poinL'i during the n~remony, most notice­ably wlwn two cadets played 'Taps' across thn mllnding pool.

Poche accidents described professor or violent 
the New Orleans area as a place that has often generated more heat than light. 
"It is only now in the wake of a national tragedy that it gains some attention," he said. 
Louisiana, like many places in the south, had a movement of families from rural areas into the cities -which led to limited housing, raised rents, crowded schools, persistent violence and high prices, Poche said. "Superghettos" were formed, where the lower class and minorities often lived. 
There was a "reinforced insu­lation of the communities from the rest of New Orleans," Poche said. 
Hurricane Katrina has brought the chance for people to reflect on the urban underclass in New Orleans and to reflect on nation­al values, Poche said. 
"It is difficult to avoid a deep sense of humanity," he said­noting that among glaring con­tradictions, people have a sur­prising connectedness to one another. "Perhaps the images coming through today will move us to finish the job." 
Hickman began his speech by letting the audience know the University Counseling Center is now located in the old post office building near Main Circle, if any­one requires their services. 
"There have been major disas­ters and crises in this country," he said. "We need to be available 

personal 
assaults 
like rape, Hickman said. 
"PTSD doesn't apply to what is going on in New Orleans now," Hickman said. "It could be in four months, six months from now." 
Individuals in New Orleans are likely experiencing acute stress disorder now, which often occurs anywhere from two days to four weeks after an event, Hickman said. 
However, Hickman said it is likely PTSD will be seen in the south in coming months. 
"The situation was not what we've come to expect," Hickman said. "We're used to the Red Cross bringing coffee and blan­kets, not bodies floating down the streets for five days." 
People who suffer from PTSD often relive the experience through nightmares and flash­backs, have difficulty sleeping and feel detached or estranged, and these symptoms can be severe enough and last long enough to significantly impair the person's daily life. 
Still, Hickman said positives often come out of tragedy. 
"The effects of traumatic events are not always negative. Resilience is the most common response to trauma," he said. 
Those at risk for PTSD include females, ages 40 to 60, ethnic minorities, people of low income status, witnesses of grotesque death and those who suffer from 

physical injury, resource or social support deterioration, alienation and mistrust, Hickman said. 
Warlick spoke on the economic impact of Hurricane Katrina. Individuals in the New Orleans area already had significantly lower incomes than the rest of the country. While the median of American household annual income earnings is $42,000 and $33,000 for Louisiana, 50 per­cent of houses in New Orleans made ends meet on only $27,000 or less annually, she said. 
Warlick said economic policy­makers at every level are going to be struggling to meet the needs of the people affected in different ways. 
"The last thing we want to do is forget the people who lost the most," she said. "Economists do sometim~s try to put a monetary value on a life -we don't want to do that." 
Warlick also said economic struggle in the area will come about in large part because many of the people who died in New Orleans were important sources of income and economic support for families in the area. 
Advanced societies have socie­tal safety nets to keep people from being totally destitute. The struggle now, Warlick said, is to see what kinds of nets were actually in place before Katrina and see how they are respond­ing. 
Though individuals often had private safety nets -like home insurance -they are of little value. Most homes in the dam­aged areas were insured against wind damage but not flooding. 
"Even people who had home insurance -not many would be able to receive a replacement value," Warlick said. 
While welfare is an option, to receive such funds one has to be working. 
"How do you respond if there are not jobs available?" Warlick said. 
A further problem is that pro­grams like welfare and food stamps require proof of residen­cy and birth certificate, an impossible task for people who may have left documentation in their now-ruined homes. 
Warlick said it appears as if the federal government will have to spend $200 billion on rebuild­ing the New Orleans area. 
Williams spoke about the efforts by the Red Cross to offer aid to hurricane victims. 
So far, almost 160,000 people have been housed across 17 states. Millions of meals have been given out thanks to the hands of over 32,000 volunteers, Williams said. 
The Red Cross' mission is to provide food, shelter and cloth­ing -not through collections, but funds. 
"We help anyone affected by disaster," Williams said. "We are mandated by Congress to pro­vide this service, however we receive no government funding." 
The Red Cross has exercised their national disaster plan, mean"ing all money collected goes directly to the national headquarters for use only on hurricane victims. 
The local Red Cross chapter has been welcoming evacuees, who turn to workers to help them "start a paper trail." Specifically, every effort has to be made to locate parents of children left orphans by the hur­ricane, Williams said. 
Never before has the Red Cross given this kind of aid. The monetary collections were not this high -$240 million -after the tsunami or Sept. 11, 2001, Williams said. 
Williams said their main goals are family identification and rebuilding. She also said although they are "all up in arms about a lot of things" with the response time, the Red Cross cannot lose sight of providing food, shelter and clothing. 
"We specialize in disaster," she said.

The student body seems to have an optimistic attitude about this year's football sea­son, freshman Christine Clark said. 
"I was a little scared in the fourth quarter when Michigan started coming back, but I knew the Irish would pull through in the end," she said. 
Freshman Ronald Kerelegon said he was sur­prised at the final score of the game, in which Michigan remained held to three points until its first touchdown in the fourth quarter. 

"The game was surprising­ly low-scoring," Kerelegon said. "I didn't think the Michigan defense would have played as well as they did. It was smart, though, how Notre Dame ran down the clock at the end of the game." 
Many fans, like freshman Megan Erikson, said the highlight of this low-scoring game was second-year Michigan quarterback Chad Henne's fumble on the one­yard line. 
"As a freshman, I am new to the whole Notre Dame football experience, and I found the game to be enthralling," she said. "The touchback was so intense. It was definitely the best part of the game. It must have been embarrassing for the Wolverines." 
With two wins behind the team, many Notre Dame fans ·I are anxiously looking foward to watching the Irish take on Michigan State this Saturday in the opening home game.

Nearly two weeks al'ter llurricane Katrina's onslaught, the day was marked by signs that hopelessness was begin­ning to lift in this shat­tPred eity. While the final toll from the disaster remains unknown, there were indications New Orleans had begun to turn a corner. 
"You see the eleaning of the streets. You sec the people coming out," said the volunteer with the bullhorn, Norman Flowers. "The people aren't as afraid anymore." 
Later in the day, President Bush began his third visit to the city since the hurricane, landing on a warship that was assist­ing in recovery efforts and visiting with firelighters. 
Flowers, deployed by the Southern Baptist Convention, stood in the bed of a pickup truck on Canal Street, leading police, firefighters and relief workers in song, punctuated by tho exuber­ant honk of a fire truck nearby. 
"This is a sign of progress," said New Orleans resident Linda Taylor, gesturing at the impromptu gathering. "Last Sunday, I couldn't lind any church services. This Sunday, people have gathered together to wor­ship." 
Numerous residents were able to visit their homes· for the first time, however briPily, as flood­waters receded and work crews eleared trees, debris and downed telephone poles from major streets.

Bush planned to spend the night aboard the USS lwo Jima, an amphibious assault ship anchored in the Mississippi Hiver in front of the convention center, where thousands of people waited in squalor for several days before being rescued. The vessel is serving as a control cen­ter in the relief efforts. On Monday, the president planned to tour the devas­tated town of Gulfport, Miss.

Israeli troops pull out of Gaza Strip 
Associated Press 

NEVE DEKALIM, Gaza Strip -The last Israeli troops began driving out of the Gaza Strip in large convoys early Monday and flag-waving Palestinian police took over the abandoned posi­tions as Israel wrapped up it<; historic pullout from the coastal territory after 38 years of occupation. 
Some 5,000 Israeli troops left in Gaza began driving toward Israel and the last Israeli soldier was to be out by daybreak. Meanwhile, Palestinian police on foot and in buses moved into the abandoned Jewish settlements. accompanied by cars earrying civilians who honked horns and waved flags. 
Palestinian forces in red beret'> plant­ed their flag in what was once the largest Jewish settlement in Gaza, Neve Dekalim. Hundreds of Palestinians celebrated, beating drums and marching toward the settlements. In the abandoned Morag settlement, the synagogue was set on frre. Mosques blared ·chants praising the "liberation" and fireworks lit up the sky. 
"It is only the first step to more liber­ation ... tomorrow we liberate all of Palestine," Gaza resident Mohammed Khamish Habboush shouted into a mosque loudspeaker. 
Late Sunday, Israeli troops had low­ered their national banner in Neve Dekalirn, snapped farewell pictures and dosed army headquarters, which were left intaet for use by the Palestinians. 
In a somber farnwell ccrnmony, the Israeli comrnandnr in Gaza, Brig. Gen. Aviv Kochavi, exprnssed hopn thn pull­out would be a step toward peace. "The gate that will dosn behind us is also the gate that will opnn," he said. "We hope it will bn a gate of pmu:n and quiet, a gate of hopn and goodwill, a gate of neighborliness and if' a bad wind brnaks through then we will greet it with a force of troops ready and waiting."

Westerink came up with the ADCIRC with Rick Luettich, his roommate during their first year of graduate studies at MIT and now a professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The pair has actively worked on the model's development since com­pleting graduate school more than 15 years ago.

Gas prices reach all-time highs 
LOS AN<;I\LES -Damage to Gulf Coast rnfineries and pipelines by Hurricane Katrina pushed retail gas prices to historic highs in the past two wonks, with self-serve regular aver­aging more than $3 a gallon for the first time nvnr, according to a nationwide survey rnleased Sunday. 
The weighted average price for all three grades surged more than 38 cents to nearly $:~.04 a gallon between Aug. 26 and Sept. 9, said Trilby Lundborg, who publishes the semi­monthly Lundberg Survey of 7,000 gas stations around the country. 
Self-serve regular averaged $3.01 a gallon nationwide, according to the survey. Midgrade was pegged at about $3.11, while premium­grade was at nearly $3.21. 
"That's all thanks to Katrina," Lundberg said. The spike occurred despite dedines in the '~ost of crude oil in recent weeks. 
The hurricane dncimated refineries along the (;u]f Coast. cutting 11 pnrcent of the nation's rdining capaeity for all petroleum products and shutting down essential pipelines to the East Coast and elsewhere, Lundberg said.

U.S. gave unnecessary 9/llloans 
Associated Press 

Washington -The government promised banks a hands-off approach in overseeing nearly $5 billion in Sept. 11 recovery aid to small businesses. What it got in return was numerous loans to com­panies that didn't need terror relief -or even know they were getting it, The Associated Press found. 
"llad we known it was 9/11 money, we would not have bor­rowed it," said John Adams, a vice president of Brankle Brokerage and Leasing in Marion, Ind., who didn't know until informed by AP that his company's $1.33 million loan had been drawn by his bank from a pro­gram created by Congress to help economic victims of the 2001 terror attaeks. 
"We would have chosen some other avenue. That money surely eould have been used by people who 
needed it more than we did," Adams said. 
llis company wasn't alone. From Dunkin' Donuts shops and florists to motorcycle dealers and chiroprac­tors, businesses nationwide said they were unaware their banks had lnnt them money from the low-inter­est, government-guaranteed Sept. 11 loan program. 
The records obtained under the Freedom of Information Aet also show that many other loan recipi­ents who made cases they were injured by Sept. 11 were far removed from the direct devastation of New York City and Washington, like a South Dakota country radio station, a Virgin Islands perfume shop and a Utah dog boutique. 
The pattern of lending left many at New York's Ground Zero seething, especially those who had trouble getting government assis­tance. 
"You havn .to take it back and give it to us. Even now, I could use it," fumed Mikn Yagudayev, who said the governnwnt offered him only $20,000 of tlw $70,000 loan he requested to rebuild t.lw hair salon l'lattened by tlw collapse of the World Trade Center's twin towers.

Saint Mary's vice president for enrollment management. "We had received calls to the admissions office asking if we would accept displaced students." 
Meyer said initially some administrators were hesitant to accept additional students because they would have to start the semester already two weeks behind. 
However, after working with The National Catholic College Admissions Association and seeing the great need, Saint Mary's decided to accommodate stranded undergraduates. 
"I think we really felt from a moral standpoint that this was something that would make sense for us to do," Meyer said. 
College officials said they wanted to make the process as simple as possible and acknowledged the tremen­dous difficulties the incoming students had already faced. 
"Under the new policy, qualifying students will be admitted as visiting students, defined as those attending on a temporary basis until they're able to return to their · original place of enrollment," the College said in a state­ment. "Visiting student enrollment is based on the availability of classes and the college's ability to offer coursework suitable to her intended program of study." 
Displaced students will be charged tuition equal to that of their original institution, the statement said. If stu­dents had already paid tuition to their intended school, no additional tuition would be charged by Saint Mary's. 
Prior, originally from the Chicago suburb Lincoln Park, was looking forward to her first weekend at Tulane University when Hurricane Katrina bore down on New Orleans.

Back home, Prior kept her­self updated on the status of the school through an emer­gency Web site the University established. The school remained largely dry as it is located uptown, she said. Once it was clear Tulane and the city of New Orleans 

would not reopen for some time, however, she and her family started to explore other options. 
"My mom and I started calling some schools and I had a friend who went to Saint Mary's last year and goes to Holy Cross this year, and I knew a lot of people who lived in South Bend," Prior said.

Martin hits high note with film 
'Shopgirl' demonstrates actor's versatility as writer, producer 
Associated Press 
TORONTO -More so than at perhaps any other time in his career, Steve Martin has a film that showcases his versa­tility. 
"Shopgirl" started with Martin's prose, his best-selling novella about a depressive wallflower pursued by a rich older man and an awkward young slacker. It comes to the theater via Martin's own screenplay adaptation, which turned a highly internalized tale with minimal dialogue into a eamera-friendly story. 
It also features one of the finer in Martin's growing range of quiet, restrained per­formances as he fills the role of the lonely older man looking for love while settling for sex with a woman half his age. And as the producer, Martin helpAd stitch together a pitch­perfect cast that includes Claire Danes as the wallflower and Jason Schwartzman as the slacker. 
The only thing missing is the wild-and-crazy physical come­dy that has been a trademark of Martin's biggest successes, from "The Jerk" and "All of Me" to "Bringing Down the House" and "Cheaper By the Dozen." 
Dismissed by critics in the 1970s as an anti-intellectual, banjo-toting buffoon with a fake arrow through his head, Martin has undergone a grad­ual transformation since the mid-1980s to become an esteemed writer and per­former. 
"I think when the movie 'Roxanne' came out, which I also had written, I felt some­thing new that I never felt, which was respect," Martin said with a bonny laugh in an interview at the Toronto International Film Festival, where "Shopgirl" played in advance of its Oct. 21 theatri­cal debut. 
That continued through such films as "Planes, Trains & Automobiles," "L.A. Story," "Grand Canyon" and "The Spanish Prisoner" and a liter­ary career that has produced the play "Picasso at the Lapin Agile" and the novel "The Pleasure of My Company." 
"Also, as you get older, you gain a little more weight just by default because you've been around that long," said 
Martin,  who  turned  60 in  
August.  
"Shopgirl"  centers  on  

Mirabelle (Danes), a twen­tysomething clerk at a ritzy Beverly Hills store. Solitary and on medication for deep depression, Mirabelle finds herself ineptly romanced by a young bumbler (Schwartzman) and swept off her feet by a rich divorced man (Martin). 
Neither man proves quite what Mirabelle expected as the story winds through the euphoria of new romance, the sour taste of rejection and the human inclination to obsess over relationships gone wrong. 
"I often think all that think­ing we do and that emotional pain is some kind of evolution­ary flaw. Why? Why are we neurotic? What's the pur­pose?" Martin said. "It's some­thing like evolution going too far, and we end up so worried about things that don't matter. That's what love is. It's like this whole side effect of mating that got really complicated." 
"Shopgirl" is the first of a flurry of Martin films that con­tinues with the Christmas release "Cheaper By the Dozen 2," in which he reprises his role as patriarch to a family of 12 kids, and February's "The Pink Panther," in which he recreates Peter Sellers' bum­bling Inspector Clouseau. 

Even that broad range of films only scratches the sur­face of Martin's talent, said "Shopgirl" co-star Danes. 
"He's an incredibly dynamic person. I don't know if the general public is so conscious of that," Danes said. "He's a skillful, celebrated writer. He also collects art in earnest, and he's also an incredible musician. You should hear him play the ukulele. It's ridiculous what he's capable of." 
The soft-spoken, graciously polite Martin comes off like an elder statesman far removed from the wild-and-crazy guy he once portrayed. 
"The Steve Martin I met and got to know is not a wild-and­crazy guy," said "Shopgirl" director Anand Tucker. "He's an incredibly erudite, articu­late, quiet, I want to say even shy man. Very thoughtful. So in some ways, the Steve Martin you see in 'Shopgirl' is more the real Steve Martin now." 
Martin is braced for the day when writing could become his main job if lead movie roles dry up. 
''I've kind of looked at it in two ways. One, one day it'll just be over," Martin said. "On the other hand, you've got Walter Matthau. He found a way to be funny late in life. But to just take a role as a cor­porate executive who sets up the new young stars, I have no interest in that." 
'Exorcism' con1bines courtroon1 and horror 
Film bends genres to boost box office sales 
Associated Press 

LOS ANGELES -"The Exorcism of Emily Rose" bedeviled its competition in its box-office debut this weekend, hauling in $30.2 million with its mix of courtroom drama and classic horror. 
The film, inspired by true events, follows a Catholic priest on trial for negligent homicide following the death of a satani­cally possessed 19-year-old. 
Its PG-13 rating and cast, including Oscar nominees Tom Wilkinson, Laura Linney and Shohreh Aghdashloo, helped give it wide appeal, bumping last week's newcomer, "Transporter 2," from the No. 1 spot, according to studio esti­mates. 
Overall revenue for this weekend's top 12 films was up 16 percent from the same peri­od last year, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Exhibitor Helations. 
"Transporter 2" fell to third place with three-day estimated ticket sales of $7.2 million. The action sequel dropped below "The 40-Year-Old Virgin," which held on to the No. 2 spot in its fourth week with $7.9 million, boosting its total domestic gross to $82.3 mil­lion. 
The critically panned "The Man," a buddy comedy that throws together federal agent Samuel L. Jackson and dental supply salesman Eugene Levy to solve a murder, opened in sixth place with $4.0 million. 
"An Unfinished Life," which stars Robert Redford, Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Lopez in the story of a rancher reluc­tantly reunited with his estranged daughter-in-law, opened well in limited release, with $1.0 million and a per theater average of $7,264. 
Meanwhile, "The Constant Gardener," starring Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz and based on a John le Carre novel, moved to fourth place in its second week. The film took in $4.8 million, bringing its total to $19.1 million, while playing on fewer than half the number of screens given to "The Exorcism of Emily Rose." 
Dergarabedian attributed the popularity of "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" to its genre-bend­ing style. 
"It has a lot of very interest­ing elements that make it not your typical horror movie," he said. 
The film's debut marks the third biggest September open­er, behind "Sweet Home Alabama" and the first "Rush Hour." 
Rory Bruer, president of dis­tribution for Sony Pictures, called the opening "phenome­nal." 
"The movie cost us less than $20 million to make. We would have been very happy had the picture opened to $15 million," he said.  
Raunchy summer comedies like "The 40-Year-Old Virgin"and "The Wedding Crashers" also continue to boost the sagging box office. 
Still, overall revenues for the year are down about 6 percent and attendance is down about 9 percent.

Coast Guard duties tnultiply 
Associated Press 
ABOARD JAYHAWK 6028 ­Petty Officer Wayne Weschrek thought he'd long ago put the dangerous stuff behind him. Yet here he was, aboard a Coast Guard heli­copter hovering at 50 feet. 
Weschrek, 28, clipped a metal cable onto his flight jacket, the instructor gave a final tug to his flight suit, and Weschrek slid out, riding the cable to the ground below at the Coast Guard's Cape Cod air station. 
Eight years ago, after his daughter was born, Weschrek transferred out of the Coast Guard's law enforcement side, from ship hoardings and drug interdic­tion missions, and became an environmental officer, a "duck scrubber" who con­tained oil spills and saved wildlife. 
Then came the 2001 terror­ist attacks. The Coast Guard became the nation's largest Homeland Security agency and Weschrek's duties changed again. He became a boarding officer, a member of the armed teams that search foreign ships entering U.S. ports. 
The Coast Guard's duties are growing faster than its ranks and officers like Weschrek who were saving seals, breaking ice or repair­ing harbor lights are being retrained. 
"If you're part of the Coast Guard today, you have to 

understand that we have two priorities: search and rescue, and security," said Capt. Peter Boynton, commander for all of Long Island Sound, which includes Weschrek's unit based at New Haven, Conn. "We still do everything else, but those are the main acts." 
Today, "eve-rything else" includes helping victims of Hurricane Katrina. Rescue crews on other Jayhawk heli­copters were among the first to respond and the Coast Guard is credited with saving thousands from rooftops of flooded homes in New Orleans. Coast Guard person­nel also run medical centers and head up shelter opera­tions. 

And on Friday, Coast Guard Vice Adm. Thad W. Allen was named to replace Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Michael Brown as commander of the New Orleans relief efforts. 
Deer hunter goes on trial for six murders 
Associated Press 

HAYWARD, Wis. -A deer hunter went on a rampage last fall, killing six hunters and wounding two others, after he felt insulted, a prosecutor told jurors Saturday. The defense said Chai Soua Yang felt physi­cally threatened by a group of white hunters who tormented him with racial slurs. 
Yang's attorney, Steve Kohn, said Yang, 36, of St. Paul, Minn., started shooting because he believed another hunter fired at him first. 
"You will hear him telling you 
-that he felt he was under siege," Kohn said during the opening day of the trial in Sawyer County. "He knows he was shot at by some very hostile individuals." 
Earlier, prosecutors said Yang fired first because he was angry the others were disrespectful to him and said they would report him to state· game wardens for trespassing, Assistant Attorney General Roy Korte said. 
"In the end, it was nothing more than anger," Korte said. 
Korte said Yang fired at least 20 shots, and the other hunters had only one gun and managed just one shot during the con­frontation in the northwestern Wisconsin woods last November. Four hunters were shot in the back, and one victim ran nearly 500 feet before being shot, Ko:rte said. 
Korte denied the hunters used racial slurs, though he said one hunter, Robert Crotteau, got angry and used profanity. Kohn described a different confronta­tion in which the white hunters repeatedly used racial slurs against Yang, an ethnic Hmong who came to the United States from a refugee camp in Thailand in 1980. 
'There is no question that race and racial prejudice played a part in the interplay between these individuals," Kohn said. 
·vang is charged with six counts of first-degree murder and three counts of attempted murder. If convicted, he faces mandatory life in prison. Wisconsin does not have the death penalty. 
Yang, dressed in khaki shirt and pants, showed no emotion as the attorneys gave their opening statements to the all-white jury. The trial is expected to last two weeks. 
Yang, a National Guard marks­man who has hunted deer since 1992, told investigators he got lost chasing a wounded deer and crawled into a tree stand on pri­vate land, where Terry Willers found him, the jury was told. Willers asked him to leave, and other hunters soon arrived and called Yang derogatory names, Kohn said. 
Crotteau, one of the property's owners, rushed to confront Yang, Kohn said. 
"He starts laying into him. Foul language, racial epithets, and he is physically threatened," Kohn said.

Nation n1ourns fourth anniversary of Sept. 11 attacks 
Memorial services held in New York City, throughout United States to remember those who Lost their Lives 
Associa ted Press 
NEW YOBK-As if they w1we writing lntters to a long-lost l'rinnd. tlw brotlwrs and sisters of Snpt. II victims walked to liH mierophorw, lookPd to the sky and tearfully told thnir sib­lings what had happened in tho world since tlwy died. 
They talk1Hl about babies born. children growing up. and how lllLH'.h the vktims W!H"e still missed. 
"II' you wnrn lwn~. you'd be so proud. so proud of Gabe and Madeleinn," Francis Hoffman told his brotlwr Stephen. a 36­ynar-old Cantor Fitzgerald bond broknr. 
"If it's a boy in I>neember, we'rn taking your name," said Nancy Brennan-Poulis, Peter Brnnnan 's brollwr. 
The siblings were among morn than 600 pnopln who read thn names of the 2, 7 49 victims who died four ynars ago when hijacked jetliners crashed into tim World Trad11 Center. Tears sometimes swallowed their words as they read the names, and rn I a ti vos in tlw crowd bowed their )wads and sobbed as the siblings spoke. 
"You're still our hero. Please knep watching over us," Elizabeth Ahearn said to her brother, Fire Lt. Brian Ahearn. 
Several times, the brothers and sistnrs came in groups ­sometimes six or seven large ­to honor their loved one, all huddling together to say their namn. Somn blnw kisses to the sunny, paln-blun sky, whiln oth­~~rs said over and over, "We love you. Wn miss you." 
"We know you're keeping everyonn laughing up in heav­en," said Kathleen Pslrogianes to her brother, Thomas Cahill. a Cantor Fitzgnrald trader who was 36 wlwn he died. 
As the namns of the dead wnrn read. weeping mournnrs filed down a ramp to a reflect­ing memorial pool at the floor of thn sitn. which remains vir­tually nmpty four years after tlw attack torn a hole in tho Now York skyline. Familins l'illed tho water with red. orange and yellow roses, some shaking as they inseribnd dedi­cations on the wooden edge of the pool. 
The four-hour ceremony came as Hurricane Katrina left Americans once again strug­gling with a catastrophe that eaught the nation unprepared and left thousands of citizens dead and grieving. 
Mayor Miehael Bloomberg opened with words of condo­lence for those devastated by Katrina and the terrorist bomb­ings in the London Underground. 
"To Americans suffering in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, our deepest sympa­thies go out to you this day," Bloomberg said. 
In New Orleans, New York firefighters helping with the relief effort gathered around a makeshif't memorial for their fallen comrades, accepting the gift of a bell from a nearby church whose steeple was destroyed in the storm. 
Nnw York Fire Commissioner Nicholas Seoppetta said at a ceremony in Brooklyn that his firefighters who have gone to the Gulf Coast are "doing what this department does best. and that is saving lives." 
"An entire city has been vir­tually destroyed ... but four years later, we are in a position to respond with the same gen­erosity of spirit which was shown to us," he said. 

In Shanksville, Pa., about 1,000 people attended a memo­rial service for the 40 passen­gers and erew who died when Flight 93 crashed into a field after those aboard struggled with the al-Qaida hijackers 11y­ing it toward Washington. 
In Washington, President Bush marked the anniversary with his wife on the South Lawn, and throngs of people marched in remembrance of the attacks and in tribute to troops fighting overseas. 
The ground zero ceremony 
paused for moments of silence at 8:46 a.m., the time at which a hijacked jetliner crashed into the north tower, at 9:03 a.m., the moment a second plane struck the south tower, at 9:59 a.m., when the south tower fell and at 10:29 a.m., when the second tower collapsed. 
Secretary of State Condoleezza Riee, Gov. George 
E. Pataki, former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and New Jersey Gov. Richard Corley all addressed the crowd. 
"We all stand together to help each other and to help those who need our help in the future," Giuliani said. "We remember forever all the brothers and sisters that wo lost on that day." 
For several family members, their messages became politi­cal. Many prayed to suceeed in efforts to provide a fitting memorial at the site, a refer­ence to the battle over an inter­national museum of frendom planned for ground zero. Some families say the museum would politicize the site and overshad­ow the memorial. 
Parents and grandparnnts read the victims' names at ground zero last year, while ehildren's voices were heard in 2003. A selection of politidans, relatives and others read the names on the first anniversary.

Three years ago, New York Times reporter Adam Cohen wrote a column titled "If the Big One Hits, New Orleans Could Disappear." In his remarkably insightful article, he noted that America's most "cul­turally rich city" was also "a disaster waiting to happen" because of its pre­carious position below sea level and in between Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi River. 
In other words, as Cohen wrote in 2002, "If a bad hur­ricane hit ... the city could fill up like a cereal bowl, killing tens of thousands and laying waste to the city's architectural heritage. If the Big One hit, New Orleans could disap­pear." 
Well, the Big One did hit, and New Orleans did fill up like a cereal bowl. Worst of all, when this horrific episode in American history is all said and done with, tens of thousands of people could very well turn out to have lost their lives at the hands of "the Big One." The problem is, however, that the anarchy that has engulfed New Orleans for the past two weeks could have easily been prevented. 
As Cohen noted in his prophetic story, Washington could have followed the lead of the Italian government, which invested over $3 billion into saving its own drowning city-Venice. In New Orleans, this could have been accom­plished by various methods, including building a 30-foot wall across the city to hold back lake water or investing money into raising lake levees and sav­ing the eroding coastal wetlands. 
Instead, according to Cohen's article, the head of the New Orleans Office of Emergency Preparedness at the time, 

EDITORIAL CARTOON 

Terry Tullier, merely chose to give his citizens disaster preparedness presen­tations in which he started by saying, "When the Big One comes, many of you will die -let's get that out of the way." (If that was the best disaster prepared­ness plan that the city could come up with, then maybe the New Orleans gov­ernment was already suffering from one too many Hurricanes -the drink, not the storm, that is.) 
Of course, ignoring warnings has become an unofficial American pastime as of late, so it comes as no surprise that the Big Easy wasn't at all prepared to handle "the Big One." 
Only a week after the Sept. 11 terror­ist attacks, it was uncovered that the FBI had learned in 1995-and several dozen times afterwards -that terror­ists with ties to Osama bin Laden had planned to hijack commercial planes and slam them into major U.S. targets, including buildings in New York and Washington. Of course, those warnings were largely ignored until after the fact. 
Similarly, as the body count began to grow in Iraq, America learned that its government had been warned numer­ous times that their reasons for getting tied up in this Middle Eastern reincar­nation of Vietnam -namely, that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction and had ties to Osama bin Laden-were false. Naturally, these warnings were ignored until it was too late as well. 
Even with less-pressing issues, the United States seems bent on staying true to its "ignore it, then deplore it" outlook on life. For several years now, Americans have been inundated with warnings about over-eating and the health risks related to obesity. Eating fast food on a regular basis is like beg­ging to be buried in an extra-wide cas­ket, and everyone knows it. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that eight percent of the American population is sucked into McDonalds every single day of the year! Not only does this explain why they stopped counting how many hamburg­ers they've sold on their signs, but it also provides another sickening exam­ple of U.S. citizens ignoring a blatant warning and suffering because of it. 
In each of these cases, someone of authority has told America not to push the red button, and each time, without fail, Uncle Sam has stuck out his pudgy white hand and pushed defiantly. No wonder the rest of the world considers this country to be a bunch of cocky, self­serving imperialists. 
The real question, of course, becomes why. Why does America do it? Who are we to laugh in the face of experts and go about living our lives as if we were somehow above the mundane triviali­ties of being a human? 
Who was Michigan to sit around in their Big House with their No. 3 ranking and inept defense and expect to keep up with what some have called the "nastifi­cation" of Notre Dame football? 
It seems as if no matter how many cities are destroyed, no matter how many buildings collapse, no matter how many soldiers are killed, no matter how many overweight people die of heart attacks, and no matter how many Wolverines go limping off the football field, America will never alter its pat­tern of ignoring the evidence first and pointing fingers (at federal agencies, former presidents, British people, fast food corporations or video replay refer­ees) later. That's just the American way, and one day, it's going to be our down­fall. 
But don't say I didn't warn you.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Advertising Notre Dame 
Preserving faith 
I don't mad The Observer's Viewpoint sm:tion often, and Friday's disappointing presentation reminded me why. I am sad­dened to learn that The Observer's edito­rial stan· and some students have become so pretentious and self-aggrandizing that they were "insulted" by Notre Dame's "Candle" television Spot. 
Although the ad doesn't strike me as particularly brilliant, I think it does a fair job of d1mwnstrating that Notre Dame is a school that recognizes that we are not self-made. It seems the editorial stafl' is too prnoccupied with proving to their friends in the Ivies that Notre Dame isn't just a "football school" and, unfortunately for thnm, all that religious stuff doesn't eorne oiT as impressive either. 
It's too bad that Mr. Kearns and his friends in the theology department spend thnir tinw laughing at the simple piety of us "candle lighting" Catholics, but the Notre Dame I love rneognizes that there is profound thnology at work in a simple "candln." Maybe he should take a few dasses with Profnssor Cavadini or Father Daley, I'm sure they at least can help him stop that nasty laughing habit, if not also 
Ad shows ND's shortcomings 
What kind ofimage is Notrn Dame selling in the nnw television advnrtisement'? A uni­versity that providns highnr ndueation'? I think not, bncausn it dons not say anything about Notre Damn's aeadnmie programs. It dons not highlight the wonderful faculty and fadlity wn h<tVn. It dons not say what the S!~hool's mission statement is. Instead, the eomnwrdal successfully sold an image of hornogonoity. It perfectly dnpkl<; thnlaek of diversity at Notrn Damn, which not only dis­muragns those who cannot identify with the girl in tho video to apply, but it also shows disrnspmt to the minoritins at Notre Dame since they arn nowhere to be foun·d in thi'> :m-s1~mnd telovision advertisement that is supposed to mprnsent Notrn Dame. 
In the comnwrdal, the whito 1-,>irl who livns in a middlo-upper dass suburban nnighbor­hood prays that she will get admitted to Notrn Damn. What kind of students will this vidno attrad'? Definitely not those who grow up in innnr cities and eonstantly struggle with the innquality in the distribution of education­al n~sourees and yet manage to score high on the SATs and maintain a 3.8. Dnfmitnly not tho African American studenl'> who study so hard just so that they can be the first ones in thnir lilmilies to attend college. Definitely not .Jews or atheisl<; who believe that Notre Damn olli~rs them what they want academi­cally and yet are skeptical about the differ­ence of their religious backgrounds. These studenl'> are ditfnrnnt and yet they are the kind of studenl<; that Notrn Dame daims it strivos to reach out to. llowever, not only does this nnw commereiallail to reach out to stud1ml'> with a divnrse background, it sends a dear mnssage telling thorn not to apply bo,:ausn we don't want tl10se who hold dill"er­ont opinions and thny will nnver fit in. 
In addition, when Julie Flory, an assistant din~dor at the Ollice of News and lnfiJrmation, states, "It's hard to crall ames­sage so perliJct that no one can dislike it," she neglects the minorities on campus. They are not Catholic, white or rieh, and ynt they have d10snn to come to this school for the higher ndueation opportunities it provides. They are part of the studnnt body and yet they are not rnm).,'Tlized by the administration. Indeed thn majority of Notre Dame studcnl<; arc from white, Catholic, middle-upper class families; however, that does not moan Asians, Mormons, gays or p110ple whose parents have three jobs just to kenp them in school do not nxist here. Ofumtimes these marginaliznd ~-,rroups are only seen but not heard on cam-helping him to see that theology is more than smarty pants sniggering. 
The "Candle" ad may not show every­thing about Notre Dame. It was not meant to. I think it does show one thing brilliant­ly however, and that is that at Notre Dame we recognize more than just the academic and athletic success of our students, alumni and faculty. We recognize more than the rankings and statistics. We rec­ognize more than the avant-garde aca­demic (and theological) posturing. We rec­ognize that all of reality, even getting into Notre Dame, is a sign of the Mystery who became a man continuing his saving pres­ence in history. 
I am grateful for students like the young woman in New Jersey. I hope that her four years of study at Notre Dame strengthen this aw1,1reness. And I think there is still hope for Mr. Kearns and the editorial staiT of The Observer. The Mystery is wait-' ing to encounter them too.

pus. In this case, thny arc 
not even seen in this 
commercial, as if Notre 
Dame dons not approve 
of their presence. 

Notre Dame tries hard to create an image of "We arn ND." Everyone in this big Notre Dame filmily is happy and well taken care of. However, who is exduded in this sehool is evident. Somn may argue that it is white, rkh and Catholic studenl<; arn Notre Dame legacies and 
Notre Dame must carry on this tradition. Sure, Notre Dame can accnpt any kind of students it wanl<>, but these stu­dents will not always live in the Notre Dame bubble. When they graduate, they will realize that there are many different kinds of people in real­ity. Not everyone shares the same world­views, not everyone votes for Bush, not everyone is heterosexual, not everyone goes to church and not everyone can afford foot­ball tickets. 
Diversity has been one thing that Notre Dame tries to increase in the past decade because the school sees the importance of diversity and the advantages it brings. I can­not imagine how this commercial will hurt the efforts and awareness that have been made by students who care about diversity issues. One thing that was right about the commerdal is how flawlessly it illustrates the lack of diversity in thn student body, as Matt Storin, the associate vice president for News and Information stated -"]The video] shows what Notre Dame L<>, what it strives to be and how it is different from other universities" ­Notre Dame is unique because there is no othnr school that betrays il<; mission to increase diversity and neglects the marginal­ized like Notre Dame does. I wonder when Notre Dame will truly embrace diversity as it says it does. I can only hope for the day when everyone -Latinos, bisexuals and Buddhisl'> -arn truly considered part ofthe Notre Dame family.

Ad for core constituents 
Perhaps the video advertisement shown during the Pittsburgh game is intended for a very specific audience which has been long neglected. The ad was not designed to attract prospective students or evnn their parents. There is certainly no shortage of applicants. Nor was it intended to demonstrate how the University is on a par academically with certain aspirational peers, or how much the University and its alums are contributing to make a better world. It is good to see that we don't sense the need to say that. Perhaps the ad is intended for that core constituency who believe that the messagn has been too subdued in recent times, saying to them yes, we are uniquely Notre Dame and proud of our traditions. I am thrilled that our new leaders aro willing to shout that boldly, not only to a neglected constituency but to thn world, on national television. 
Jack Fremeau alumnus Class of 1971 Sept. 9 
Spot sends wrong message 
The Notre Dame "Candle" video, shown during the ND­
Pitt game, was an embarrassment to the University. First, the "institutional spot" is theologically unsound. Its message-if you light enough candles, the payoff will be admission to Notre Dame-is what the Gorman theologian Dietrich Bonhoefer called the myth of "cheap grace." It is a simplistic message unworthy of 
a university aspiring to greatness. One doubts that Notre Dame's theology department, or its Campus Ministry, would support tl~e theology underlying tho 
video. It is unimaginable that Georgetown University or Boston College, Notre Dame's peer institutions in the Catholic academy, would promotn themselves in this fashion. 
Second, the video mischaracterizes Notre Dame's admissions process. From our own experiences, we know that admissions officnrs base their decisions on academic achievement-not on whom one knows, or how many candles one lights. The process is professional and eorreet. It is an insult to 
the Admissions Of!'ice to suggest othnrwise. 
Over 11,000 students apply annually to ND; fewer than 4,000 are accepted. Did God turn a deaf oar to the prayers of the other 7,000 applicants'? 
We speak from expnrienen. having had one son admitted to ND and another not, plus a daughter applying this year. Our bnlief' is, and our prayer is, that God will show our children, and us, what direction He wishes their lives to take-and that they will have 
the courage and grace to accept God's will in their lives -whether or not that ineludes a Notre Dame ndiu:ation. The video was creatnd by slick PH professionals who have 
little appreciation of what Notre Damn is really about. That the University would allow it to be shown to a national audi­
ence is very disappointing. Those who defend the video on thn grounds that they were merely pointing out the University's uniqun Catholic character haven't a clue about what being "Catholic" really is.

Implications are demeaning 
Whoever created and, worse, approved the insulting new 30-second ND ad understands neither Notre Dame nor Catholicism. It dnmeans our reli­gion and our University. A Notre Dame "higher education" does not mean an Admissions Office sitting around until God inspires it to admit thn stu­dent who piled up the most prayers. The world trivializes what a great university like Notre Dame could possibly mean by calling itself a "Catholic" university. How awful when the University itself pays for that trivialization! After 45 years on the faculty, I am ashamed.

Michigan and  Mike Gilloon  
all the other  
schools who  
have bullied  Sports Editor  
Notre Dame  
around the past  

few years on the college football playground, taking its bowl money but never its potential. The Notre Dame potential -its tradition, its spirit, its financial power -was always right there, stuffed in its back pocket. No one could take it. Notre Dame just needed to realize what it had. 
Weis knows what he has -and it has nothing to do with offense. His best weapon -the reason the Irish are 2-0 -is defense. 
An Irish defense that lost the memo informing it of its inexperi­ence, its lack of talent, its knack for giving up four touchdown passes to Oregon State. 
Well, Tom Zbikowski might have received that memo. But he proba­bly ripped it up, or at least knocked the messenger around. The Irish strong safety, who was compared to a kamikaze pilot by defensive coor­dinator Rick Minter last week, helped knock the Wolverines out. He stuck his helmet in the chest of every Maize and Blue receiver in his sight Saturday. And his inter­ception at the Irish 1-yard line early in the third quarter let Notre Dame breathe easier. 
A coach can only do so much. Weis may be one of the best offen­sive minds in the sport, but he needs an enforcer, a fighter, a com­petitor like Zbikowski to grind out a win. 
And Zbikowski loves it -the attention, the rush, the feeling of stopping one of the nation's best teams on the biggest home turf of all. 
"Coming into the Big House and getting a win, it's just unbeliev­able," Zbikowski said. ''I'm just 
happy we won." The Notre Dame potential tations and aren't This was sup­-its tradition, its spirit, planning on a let­posed to be a down.

Quinn to show off their talent; another chance for Weis to cement his reputation as an offensive wizard. 
But, as usual, this Michigan-Notre Dame clash was anything but pre­dictable. 
The offense, besides an opening touchdown drive as smooth as a Don Henley tune, struggled against a gritty Michigan defense. 
Quinn looked jittery, his timing slow. And the Michigan defense was too fast, too talented, too good for the Irish signal-caller to have an off day and still be successful. 
Paging the defense. 
Linebackers Brandon Hoyte and Corey Mays joined Zbikowski in smacking the Wolverines and sav­ing the day for Notre Dame. ' 
Chinedurn Ndukwe showed a Shane Walton-like sense for the football, and Maurice Crum Jr. showed poise in his first year as a starter. 
Notre Dame couldn't have asked for any more. The offensive success overall, with ten starters and Darius Walker returning, is no sur­prise. 
The defense is what had Irish fans buying extra bottles of Turns before the season started. Don't put them away yet-some guy named Pete Carroll is bringing a pretty good team to South Bend next month. 
However, Zbikowski and friends 
have already 

exceeded expec­
he can to prevent 
a mental lapse 
that seems possi­ble considering the hype his rejuve­nated program is receiving. 
The Spartans are one of those teams that have bullied the Irish around in the last decade. They've won the past four contests in Notre Dame Stadium -reason enough to give Notre Dame heartburn. 
The Irish are the stronger squad and should win on paper. But this game, just like Saturday at Michigan, could turn ugly. 
That's fine for this defense. 
They like to be the bully.

Teamadjusts to game use of instant replay 
Hy KATE GALES 
A'soci:ue Sports Ediror 
/\NN 1\HBOH. Mich.-Two of tlw most important decisions in the ganw didn't oven happen on tho liold. Instant mplay was an important fador, overturn­ing two key calls in favor of the Irish. 
In tlw fourth quarter, Chirwdum Ndukwn's goal-line fumble recovery for a touch­hack was initially ruled as a rncovnry for tlw Wolvnrines. Later that quarter, what was first called a fumble by Brady ()uinn was overturnod as the oflidals rulnd hn wm; down. 
Weis' experienco as an oll{m­sive coordinator in the NFL accustomed him to a slightly different set of rules on the mplay, which is not used in the pros unless a coach challenges tlw call. Collnge ruins dietato no coach can challnnge a call. /\n oflkial in a booth reviews every play and determines if a mplay is nncnssary. 
"The onn time I really thought was ridiculous is when· they're told -and I'm talking about the last one when I()uinn I was down -they're told to err on the side of safety because they havn replay," Weis said. 
lin pointed out that college rnfnrnes can rnly on replays for backup on any eall. 
"IThe oflkialsl told me right then Iaf'ter the calli that because they have instant replay they're told to make that call in that way because they know it can be corrncted upstairs," Wnis said. "Whereas that's not the rule that I've been used to dealing with." 
()uinn's play was evidence that instant rnplay could play a sihrnificant role in tim outcome of collegn f(lOtball games. 
"The tough thing is, there's still a couple of calls where I fool like thoro should have bnen instant replay ... there's still a lot of tough issues regarding that on both sides of the ball, I'm sure," Quinn said. 
Notes 
+ McKnight injured 
Hhema McKnight appeared to injure his knee on a passing play from Brady Quinn in the first half. McKnight left the game and was seen in street clothes at the end. 
"They said at halftime, they said they were going to go do an MRI on him," Weis said. "I moan I'll have to wait and find out. But obviously it was some­thing where he couldn't come back in the second half', you know -the severity ofit." 
Wcis said at his noon press 
conference Sunday he would meet with his stan· to discuss injuries at 1:20 P.M. lie was, therefore, not able to com­ment further on McKnight's status. 
+ Michigan Stadium win streak snapped 
Saturday's loss marked the first home loss for Michigan in 16 games. Their last home loss was on Sept. 12, 199H, in a 3H­28 decision to Syracuse. It is only the seventh home loss for Wolverines coach Lloyd Carr in his 11-year career as head eoach. 
+ Walker runs past century mark-again 
Darius Walker, Notre Dame's versatile running back, reached the 100-yard mile­stone for the second consecu­tive game on Saturday. This is the first time Walker has rushed for over 100 yards in consecutive games, after post­ing exactly 100 yards (and two touchdowns) against Pittsburgh last week. 
Walker rushed for 115 yards in his collegiate debut against Michigan last season in Notre Dame Stadium, also scoring two touchdowns. lie added 112 yards against Pittsburgh last season. 
"I thought Darius ran hard," Weis said. "He got a lot of extra yards for us." 
+ Top-3 drought over 
The game was the first time the Irish have defeated a top-3 opponent since defeating No. 3 Michigan in 1993. That was also the last year the Irish won in Michigan Stadium. Current Irish defensive coordinator lUck Minter was also Notre Dame's defensive coordinator during that win. 
+ Compared to the Rock 
Weis entered the record books with the victory as only the second Irish coach to win consecutive opening road games in his first year. The first was Knute Rockne in 1918. 
But Weis wasn't looking for comparisons to the legendary Irish coach. 
''I'm really happy for our kids right now," Weis said. "They're starting to figure it out. And that's two weeks in a row now. That's a really happy locker room, and they deserve it." 
+Captains 
Saturday's captains were Brady Quinn on offense, Brandon Boyte on defense and Casey Cullen on special teams.

Defensive spectacular 

A game expected to showcase two high-octane offenses instead turned into a scrappy defensive battle. Safeties Tom Zbikowski and Chinedum Ndukwe each came up with critical turnovers along the Irish goal line. Brady Quinn kept his cool while evading a heavy Michigan blitz, and Notre Dame coacli Charlie Weis drew comparisons to Irish legend Knute Rockne by winning his first two games on the road. The Irish beat Michigan at the Big House for the first time in 12 years and vaulted themselves into the Associated Press top ten with the victory .

CONCERT REVIEW 
Classic country sounds featured at concert 
New bands add flair to Michiana radiostation's anniversary celebration 
By LIZ BYRUM 
Al;sistanr Scene Editor 
When you're heading to a show wlwrn the schedule of' events ineludes a listing that tldls what time the Miller Lite Beer (;arden opens, you can't be exactly surn what to oxpect. 
On Sunday, the St. Josoph County Fair (;rounds thn~w opon its gates to country l'ans of' all ages and walks of lil'n. To ccdnbrate its 11th birthday, Mir.hiana's top country station, B1 00.7 hold its annual birthday party. There were quite a few give-away nvcmts on and around Notr:n Damn's campus in the past week. but only a l'ew students were spotted in tlw crowd that filled the Cnntm111ial Wirelnss Festival Park. 
Like every otlwr country concert in tlw U.S., a wide range of' people bravHd tlw lwat and canw out for the show. Tlw group ranged from girls wearing .I. Crew cowboy hats to old men sport­ing tattooed arms and real Stetsons. 
This varied l'an base that makes muntry musk what it is today. It is a genre of' music that addresses many serious issuns. such as the terrorist attac:ks that happened four years ago, hut also manages to keop things light with songs about hillbillic~s. cowboys and tlw comforts of tho South. 
Thn performers at the concnrt includnd up and coming acts sueh as .Jason Aldnan. llot Appln Pie and Shooter .Jennings, as wnll as veteran c:ountry nwn Pat Green and the head­liner, Tracy Lawrence. 
in tlw opening acts, it was obvious that nnw sounds are coming out of today's country music. Singers and liwir hands are bnginning to pull away from the "pop-country" hybrid that has propellod the industry in recent years. Although some of tho sounds coming from tho stage during the concert were dif'f'ernnt than the audience was used to !waring, they seemed to be a welcome change. 
Jason Aldean, a young singer raised in (;norgia, was one of the first per­forms to hit the stage. lie reached a low point in 2003 when he lost his recording contract and almost gave up on the music industry, but has been slowly inching his way up through the Nashville music scene since then. It wasn't until he released his song "llicktown" that he became a popular name in country music. The crowd at the concert today definitely showed him support by singing along to every word of the catchy song. 

The band Hot Apple Pie seems to be making great strides in the area of "country groups." This band knows how to play real country, and they arHn't afraid to show it. Unlike some of the other fairly new male country groups in the music industry today, such as Rascal Flatts and Emerson Drive, there isn't a hint of pop in their country twang (not that there's any­thing wrong with pop country). 
Hot Apple Pie was formed by lead singer Brady Seals in 2002. All of the band's members, whieh indude Seals, Sparky Matejka, Keith Horne and Trey Landry, have had past experience in groups of their own, or in touring and performing with other country greats, such as Waylon Jennings, Trisha Yearwood, Charlie Daniels and Lonestar. Seals was a member of the band Little Texas before he began to formulate plans for Hot Apple Pie. 

The band chose their uniqun name because, as Seals said, "it moans so many things. It means honw. it means com fort. it means country, it means rock 'n' roll. And it's so American." 
The band's self-titled dobut album 
was releasnd this past sumnwr and 
ineludes thn fun summnr-timn hit, 
"llillbillies." Although this is a grc~ai. 
song, it was not the best one that eould 
be lward from the stage as the band 
played at the Bl 00 eonenrt Sunday. 
";\nnabelln" was a gmat southnrn bal­
lad that had the erowd swaying, and 
everyonn sennwd to enjoy thn bounc:ing 
sounds of "Wn'rn Making Up." 
The most interesting act at. thn c:on­cert may havn bnnn tlw son of famed country lognnd Waylon .Jnnnings Whiln he is the son of a country lngnnd. Shooter Jennings did not bngin his music career in ~~ o un try mu s i e. II n instead has slowly made his way from Hoek 'n' Holl baek to the music: of' his roots. After playing with a band called Stargunn for many ynars in Los Angeles, Calif'., Jnnnings dncidnd to turn his earnnr around and work on the music that madn him tho happinst. -true, old-school country. With a band hn calls the 357s, hn has reenntly 
releasnd his first f'ull-lnngth eount.ry 
album, titled "Put the '()' back in 
Country." 
That is exactly what Jennings wants 
to do. Some of tho most dnseriptivo 
lyrics in the song by thn same namn 
include "I'm rollin' like a f'rnight train, comin' straight at you I I'm playin' hill­billy music, like I was born to do I You know, it ain't country music you'vn been listenin' to." 
With tons of great new music being showcased like it was in South Bend this past weekend, country fans def'i­nitely don't need to wol'l'y about t.hn future of their favorite radio stations. The sounds may be evolving, but there's something about country music and the dedication of' its fans that will never change.

MLB-AMERICAN LEAGUE 
Johnson leads Yanks in classic over Red Sox 
Lackey, Angels roll over White Sox; Rogers, Rangers top Oakland 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK-Randy Johnson glared at Johnny Damon, send­ing an early message. The Big Unit muttered when plate umpire Derryl Cousins didn't give him calls and tapped his glove on his chest after strike­outs. 
Pumping fastballs at up to 99 mph and sliders that darted down, he put together his best performance of the season, and did it against the Red Sox with the Yankees desperately need­ing a win to stay in contention in the AL East. 
Johnson gave up one hit -a soft single at that -in stifling Boston over seven innings. Jason Giambi homered off Tim Wakefield in the first on a curveball that just stayed fair, and Tom Gordon and Mariano Rivera staved off the Red Sox in a 1-0 victory Sunday. 
"That's the pitcher that every­body expected, and that's the pitcher that I'd expected," said Johnson, who improved to 4-0 against the Red Sox this season. 
After the teams exchanged sloppy wins -8-4 by New York on Friday and 9-2 by Boston on Saturday -they played nine crisp and tense innings. Wakefield pitched a three-hit­ter, and the Yankees allowed just three hits. New York had not beaten the Red Sox 1-0 on a homer since Roy White connect­ed off Jose Santiago on May 11, 1968, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. · 
Seeking its eighth straight AL East title, New York moved within three games of the first­place Red Sox with three weeks left. The Yankees began the day 1 112 games behind Cleveland in the wild-card race. 
"The big thing was not com­ing in here and getting swept," Boston's Doug Mirabelli said. 
Do the Yankees have a shot to overtake the Red Sox? "Sure we have," owner George Steinbrenner said. 
Pitching one day after his 42nd birthday and on the fourth anniversary of the 2001 terror­ist attacks, Johnson (14-8) struck out eight and walked two on an afternoon tilled with bril­liant sunshine. 
Rangers 7, Athletics 4 
Winning two out of three isn't good enough for the Oakland Athletics when they are running out of games. 
Mark Teixeira hit a tiebreak­ing, three-run homer that made him the major league RBI leader and the Texas Rangers avoided a three-game sweep with their victory Sunday that dropped Oakland to third place in the AL wild-card chase. 
"We're trying to win as much as we can. This one's going to hurt a little bit because the next two series are going to be really important," said Oakland short­stop Marco Scutaro, who had a two-run double and a solo homer. "We're just trying to win every game. We don't have much time left." 

Oakland (79-63) had won three straight, but lost for the seventh time in 11 games over­all. The 1\s began the day tied with New York at 1 1/2 games behind wild-card leader Cleveland, but the Yankees beat Boston. And Oakland dropped two games behind AL West­leading Los Angeles after the Angels beat the White Sox. 
Angels 6, White Sox 1 
Chone Figgins got the Los Angeles Angels off to a powerful start Sunday. 
Figgins hit a leadoff homer off Orlando Hernandez, and Garret Anderson and Darin Erstad added solo shots in the first to give the Angels a quick three­run lead in a victory over the Chicago White Sox. 
"That's my job, to try"!tnd get on base," said Figgins, who hit his third career leadoff homer, all this season. ''I'm not used to doing things like that." 
John Lackey pitched seven shutout innings and the Angels completed the three-game sweep. 
Figgins had a sacrifice fly in the second and stole his 50th base in the eighth. 
"We just got pitches to hit and we didn't miss them," Figgins said. "When you get pitches to hit, you can't miss them. We put

the ball in play hard today." 

Vladimir Guerrero hit his 29th homer in the eighth to help the Angels win their fourth straight game, all on the road. After Friday's 6-5 win in extra innings, Los Angeles outscored the White Sox 16-6 in the last two games. The Angels came into the game 1Oth in the AL in home runs. 
Devil Rays 6, Blue Jays 5 

Travis Lee hit a tying infield single with two outs in the ninth, then drove in the winning run on an 11th-inning grounder to help the Tampa Bay Devil Rays rally for a victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Sunday. 
Joey Gathright had a leadoff single against Scott Schoenewnis (3-4) in the 11th. Gathright went to second on Aubrey Huff's grounder before stealing third. Lee then hit a grounder to first, but the speedy Gathright beat Shea Hillenbrand's throw to the plate. 
Tampa Bay right fielder Damon Hollins kept the game tied with a running catch on Russ Adams' drive near the wall in the top of the 11th. Eric Hinske, who was on first after drawing a walk, was doubled off to end the inning. 
Travis Harper (3-6) threw two scoreless innings for the win. The Devil Rays avoided a three­game sweep and moved to 32­23 since the All-Star break. 
Blue Jays starter Gustavo Chacin allowed three runs and five hits in 7 2-3 innings, nearly improving to 4-0 in four starts against Tampa Bay this year. He struck out a career-high seven and walked one. 
Jason Frasor got the final out in the eighth but Miguel Batista allowed two runs in the ninth for his seventh blown save in 34 opportunities. 
Huff hit an RBI grounder off Batista to get Tampa Bay to 5-4. Lne tied it with a two-out infield single, a high chopper to first that Hillenbrand failed to field cleanly. 
The Devil Rays improved to 4­76 when trailing after eight innings. 
Hillenbrand's RBI double off Chad Orvella broke a 3-all tie in the eighth. Aaron Hill made it 5-3 with a sacrifice fly. 
Tampa Bay starter Casey Fossum gave up three runs ­two earned -and five hits in seven innings.

United States prevails, reclaims Solheim Cup 
-
19-year old Creamer leads the Americans 
Associated Press 

CARMEL, Ind. -Juli Inkster saw flags waving, heard chants of "U-S-A" and felt a lump in her throat on the practice range, the intensity building before the first match Sunday in the Solheim Cup. 
She gathered all the American players she could find. With their hands together in a collective fist, they broke huddle with a shout that carried them to victory and kept their record perfect on home soil. 
"FINISH!" 

"That was our key phrase," Paula Creamer said. "They don't remember how you start, but how you finish." 
Creamer made sure the start sent a message just as powerful. 
The United States won back the Solheim Cup and picked up a new star along the way-Creamer, the 19-year-old rookie who all but guaranteed victory and then backed it up with a crushing win over Laura Davies that set the tone for an American rout in sin­gles. 
The finish turned out to be anti­climactic. The only match that reached the 18th hole was the last one, when Rosie Jones earned a halve with Suzann Pettersen. All that did was provide a final score for posterity. 
United States 151/2, Europe 12112. 
"It's like a dream," U.S. captain Nancy Lopez said. "These players played their hearts out." 
The matches were tied going into the last day for the first time in 11 years, but not for long. The scoreboard was awash in so much American red that when Jones teed off in the final twosome, Europe did not lead in any match. 
Creamer, who went through her high school commencement just four months ago, shot 30 on the front nine and buried Davies, 7 and 5, as the Americans won six of the first seven matches. 
"I saw after nine holes she was 6 up," said Pat Hurst, who rallied in the match behind Creamer. "She's our rookie, and she was unbelievable." 
The Europeans were in a state of shock. 
"You're thinking about your own match, but it's hard not to look at the board," Carin Koch said. "With all the matches going the wrong way for us, it was tough. We've done everything we can." 
Meg Mallon clinched the cup for the United States with a par putt on the 16th hole for a 2-up lead, assuring the Americans at least the 14112 points they needed to win it back from Europe. 
Mallon won the next hole with a par for a 3-and-1 victory over Karen Stupples, and the celebra­tion was on. 
Players joined arms in a chorus line dance, rambled down fair­ways with an American flag and sang to the record gallery. Inkster took a camera from her bag before her caddie took it away. The only downer was after the
-
closing ceremonies. 

Lopez said Mallon became light­headed because of the heat, and was taken to the hospital as a pre­caution. 
It left a U.S. team that was slightly more somber, but still all smiles about the trophy before them. 
Europe was subdued for obvious reasons. 
"''m not one to grieve too hard or too long over golf," European captain Catrin Nilsmark said. ''I'm disappointed, mostly for the girls. They tried their best and they did their best. ... But we got down by so much. There were some big numbers up there." 
The youngest player in Solheim Cup history led the way, with help from a few others from the hip­hop generation. 
Creamer, the first LPGA Tour rookie to earn a spot in the Solheim Cup, surprised even her teammates two Weeks ago when the U.S. team was named with a sassy message to the Europeans. 
"All J can say is they had better get ready, because they're going to beat," Creamer said. 
Then she backed it up in a big way. 
"You should never say anything you don't believe," Creamer said. "This is a week I'll never forget." 

Over three days, she was in the fearless putting. She played all five Davies. 13 holes. toughest matches and came matches and went 3-1-1, the Starting with her opening birdie, For the first time all week, the through with clutch shots and biggest of all her rout against Creamer was 7 under par through United States had the lead.

NEW YORK -Andre Agassi has battled the champions of three eras ­Pete Sampras, Boris Becker, John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lend! -and now he puts Roger Federer above them all. 
"He's the best I've ever played against," Agassi said after falling to Federer 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (1), 6-1 Sunday in the U.S. Open final. "Pete was great. No question. But there was a place to get to with Pete. You knew what you had to do. If you do it, it could be on your terms. There's no such place like that with Roger. 
"He plays the game in a very special way that I haven't seen before." 
Federer, a player of panache and unparalleled perfection in finals, with­stood Agassi's spirited upset bid to capture a sec­ond straight U.S. Open and sixth Grand Slam title. 
Federer responded to his few moments of pressure by reeling off seven straight points in the tiebreak that turned the match around, then blew Agassi away in the fourth set to run his stunning record in finals over the past two years to 23-0. He has never lost in a major final. 
"This is probably the most special Grand Slam final in my career," Federer said. "To play against Andre in New York, it's a dream." 
Federer moved into a tie with Becker and Stefan Edberg for Grand Slam titles among Open era play­ers, and one behind McEnroe and Mats Wilander. Sampras holds the record with 14 Grand Slam titles, but at 24 years old Federer could well have a shot at that. 
"That's fantastic," Federer said of tying Edberg and Becker. 'Tying your idols -isn't that great? It's every boy's dream and I made it come true today in a memorable final." 
Federer, flattered by Agassi's comments, shied away from pronouncing himself the best of all time. 
"The best player of this generation, yes. Nowhere close to ever," Federer said. "Just look at the records that some guys have. I'm a little cookie." 
Federer shrieked and leapt in the air when Agassi's backhand return looped long on the champi­onship point. The two men, who have the highest of respect for each other, shook hands warmly at the net.

NFL 
Redskins defeat Bears in season opener, 9-7 
Three false starts kill Chicago's final drive 
Associated Press 
LANDOVER, Md. -The Chicago Bears were driving in Washington Redskins territory in the fourth quarter, seemingly poised to make a winner of a rookie quar­terback on opening day. 
Then, in one cruel sequence, the Redskins rattled the drive into oblivion. False start on Fred Miller. False start on John Tait. False start on Ruben Brown. Kyle Orton sacked by Demetric Evans. Suddenly, it was third-and-38. The Bears' last good scoring chance was over, and Washington's defense showed it hadn't lost a beat from last year in leading the team to a victory Sunday. 
"I guess they know we're a blitzing team," Washington line­backer Marcus Washington said with a smile as he recounted the sequence. "A couple of time~ we're looking like we're going to come, with one foot up and eyes big. Those guys, they kind of panic a little bit, and they say, This Washington defense is com­ing.' Whatever it was, we were glad we were able to back them 
-
up a little bit." 
The Redskins allowed only 166 total yards, overcame three turnovers, several untimely penalties and the loss of starter Patrick Ramsey, who had his neck wrung in the second quarter by blitzing linebacker Lance Briggs. Mark Brunell, booed mercilessly last year by the home fans, entered and led three scoring drives, all ending in field goals by John Hall and powered in part by the running of Clinton Portis, who rushed for 121 yards on 21 car­ries. 
Ramsey is fine with a mild neck sprain, but coach Joe Gibbs would not commit to a starter for next week's game at Dallas. Hall isn't fine -he strained his quad on his last kick and might not be able to play next week. 
Miami 34, Denver 10 
MIAMI -When the Miami Dolphins scored their first touch­down for new coach Nick Saban, 
-
he celebrated by pacing the side­line with a stoic expression. 
Randy McMichael strutted into end zone with the score, Jason Taylor jumped for joy and Gus Frerotte did a jig. But Saban kept his game face, well aware that one touchdown -and one wfu ­is merely a start. 
Frerotte led a creative offense by throwing for 275 yards, Taylor returned a fumble 85 yards for a score and Miami successfully kicked off the Saban era by rout­ing the Denver Broncos Sunday. 
"It's important how you respond to good things and bad things," Saban said. "We should enjoy this for 24 hours, but this is one game in a long season." 
It was a long day for the Broncos. They lost cornerback Champ Bailey and running back Mike Anderson to injuries, wilted in the 90-degree South Florida heat and fell to 0-7 in Miami'. 
"We knew it was going to be difficult to come in here and deal with the elements in their back­yard," said coach Mike Shanahan, now 10-3 in season openers with Denver and Oakland. 
New Orleans 23, Carolina 20 
CHARLOTTE, N.C.-Football is no longer a simple game for the 
New Orleans Saints. They'll play 
this season for the victims of 
Hurricane Katrina, a burden 
they'll carry every time they step 
on the field. 
The Saints won Sunday for 
their deluged dty and the dis­
placed victims of the Gulf Coast 
region, getting two touchdowns 
from Deuce McAllister and a 47­
yard field goal from John Carney 
with 3 seconds left in a season­
opening win over the Carolina 
Panthers. 
"In the back of our minds, we 
know we have to give them one 
tiny bit of hope," said New 
Orleans quarterback Aaron 
Brooks. "We have complete faith 
in what we are doing because 
every time we go out there, it is 
our job to givn them hope that 
every day will be a better day." 
The Saints have visited shelters 
in Louisiana, Mississippi and 
Texas, spending time with fans 
who had lost ,~verything. Each 
time they h,~ard the same · request: Win a game for us. 
If they needed another 
reminder, they got it during a 
Saturday night team meeting 
when coach Jim Haslett read an 
emotional letter from New 
Orleans Mayor C. Ray Nagin. 
"He talked about the things he 
had seen, babies dying," receiver 
Joe Horn said. "You would only 
see it in a horror story. People 
were crying on his shoulder, say­
ing they don't know where their 
son is, where the daughter is.

It was the most noticeable thing

wrong in the S{:ason opener.

least I don't have to pay the fine now." 
Peterson was the only Jacksonville player feeling he had something left to prove. 
Smith, 36, showed he hasn't lost a step. Taylor broke tackles, took hard hits and gained 76 yards despite a bulky brace on his left knee. And quarterback­turned-receiver Matt Jones emerged as a triple threat in Jacksonville's new offense. 
The defense returned to form, too. 
Pittsburgh 34, Tennessee 7 
PITTSBURGH -The Tennessee Titans needed a scouting report on Steelers running back Willie Parker, so cornerback Michael Waddell issued this warning: Don't pay attention to his college career, this guy can run. 
Who knew he could run like this? 
Parker, a college backup who adds speed to the NFL:s most run­heavy offense, had a dazzling first career start with 161 yards rush­ing and a long reception, and a mistake-free Ben Roethlisberger threw for two scores in Pittsburgh's rout of Tennessee on Sunday. 
"He's got the kind of speed you can't coach," tackle Marvel Smith said. "He's a raw talent, basically, but he's so fast and he's just all over the place. He broke a lot of tackles out there." 
For more than 40 years, the Steelers have been all about big, physical backs who run over or elude tacklers: Hall of Farner John Henry Johnson, Franco Harris, Jerome Bettis and, last year, Duce Staley. Parker provides a speed element they've never had, and his yardage was the most for a Steelers back on open­ing day. 
"I really didn't take any hits in college, so my career's really just beginning," Parker said. "I had to make a name for myself, open up some eyes that I can play." 
Parke~ playing because of injuries to Bettis and Staley, near­ly equaled the 181 yards he had as a non-starting senior at North Carolina, where Waddell was his roommate. He followed up a 102­yard game against Buffalo to end last season. 
"The game plan is different with him, to take advantage of his speed," center Jeff Hartings said. "I don't know if there's another running back in the league who can get down the sideline as fast as he does."

NCAA FooTBALL 
Young, No.2 rfexas knock off No.4 Ohio State 
Associated Press 
COLUMBUS, Ohio -Vince Young did what star quarter­backs do, passing his team to a victory, and making the Texas Longhorns look as if this could be the season they come up big in the biggest of games. 
Best known for his highlight­reel runs, Young threw a 24-yard go-ahead touchdown to Limas Sweed with 2:37 left and No. 2 Texas defeated No. 4 Ohio State 25-22 Saturday night in the much-anticipated first meeting between two of college football's most storied programs. 
While it's a long way to the Rose Bowl, Texas validated itself as a prime contender to Southern California's crown. Ohio State, meanwhile, will have to win out to even have a shot at a national title. 
Young's floating touchdown pass over a defender capped a 67-yard drive that started with five minutes left after Josh Huston, who made school-record five field goals, missed a 50­yarder. 
The biggest plays came on Young's passes, including a third­and-6 completion of 9 yards to Jamaal Charles. Young's second TD pass of the game made the score 23-22. 
"Sweed came off the ball real good and I threw the ball to the outside so he could go out of bounds or make the great play and Sweed made a great play for us," said Young, who threw for 270 yards. 
The Longhorns' 'D,' which time and time again held firm after turnovers and special teams gave Ohio State good field position, had the biggest takeaway of the game when Drew Kelson stripped a scrambling Justin Zwick and Brian Robison recov­ered and returned it inside the 20. 
Ohio State (1-1) held the Longhorns (2-0} out of the end zone, but Larry Dibbles sacked Troy Smith for a safety and Texas coach Mack Brown had his sec­ond straight huge victory over a Big Ten team. 
The Longhorns defeated Michigan in the Rose Bowl, when-Young launched his 2005 
I 
Heisman Trophy campaign with 
192 yards rushing. 
Young proved against the 
Buckeyes he can pass it when he 
needs to as well. 
"Obviously ho's a great run­
ner," Ohio State linebacker A.J. 
Hawk said. "Tonight he showed 
us he's a great passer." 
One Ohio Stato player had said 
the Buckeyes' goal was to put an 
end to Young's Heisman cam­
paign. And while Bobby 
Carpenter and Ohio State's swift 
linebacking crew hemmed in 
Young after some good runs 
early, they couldn't stop his pass­
ing. 
"When you have to play extra 
people in the box to stop his run 
it's going to leave 
you a bit vulnerable to the 
pass," Ohio State coach Jim 
Tressel said. "I thought he played 
hard. He kept getting hit and 
beat up and kept coming back. 
And his team won." 
Young also had made a couple 
of those poor decisions and bad 
throws -he was intercepted 
twice -that have caused him to 
be labeled a tailback playing 
quarterback. 
But he finished 18-for-29 and 
ran 20 times for 76 yards. 
Tressel was tme to his promise, 
playing both Zwick and Smith at 
quarterback. Neither distin­
guished himself, and it looks like 
the quarterback competition will 
resume for the Buckeyes. 
Smith ran for 27 yards, threw a 
touchdown pass to Santonio 
Holmes and led Ohio State on five 
scoring drives. 
Zwick was 9-for-15 for 66 
yards and led Ohio State to one 
field goal. 
Ohio State came up with three 
turnovers in Texas territory, but 
the Buckeyes could only manage 
three field goals against defen­
sive end Tim Cr)Wder and Co. 
And when T·~d Ginn Jr.'s 46­
yard kickoff return got the 
Buckeyes to around midfield in 
the third quarter, they again 
drove inside th·~ 20, only to stall 
when Ryan Hamby let a sure TD 
pass pop off his chest. 
Huston knocked his final field 
goal of the game through to tie a 
record last acccmplished by Mike 
Nugent, the All-American he 
replaced this :>eason, and give

Texas quarterback Vince Young lunges forward in the first quarter of a 25-23 Texas win over 
Ohio State at Ohio Stadium in Columbus, Ohio Saturday night. 
Ohio State a 22-16lead with 5:12 left in the third. 
"I was walking down the side­lines telling the guys, 'We've been though this (before) play by play,"' Young said. "The defense is going to give us the ball and they did a great job." 
Ginn, Ohio State's big play spe­cialist, was only a factor on spe­cial teams. He caught two passes for nine yards. 
For Brown, the ballyhooed matchup was another opportuni­ty to try to prove to critics that he can, indeed, win the big games. 
It's a reputation mostly built on five straight losses to rival Oklahoma and no Big 12 titles, despite winning at least 10 games the past four seasons. 
Brown took a step toward shedding that tag by beating Michigan in the Rose Bowl and another big one Saturday night. 
"I don't think you ever silence critics," Brown said."They'll be critics in the morning, that's part of the deal." 
Tressel dropped to 6-2 against opponents ranked in the top 10. 
"Our goal was to win the national championship that's remote now," Buckeyes guard Rob Sims said. 
Zwick got the start over Smith,

who was returning from an NCAA suspension, and played the first two series as Texas built a 10-0 lead. 
Smith, who's kind of a Vince Young-lite, gave the Buckeyes a lift with his running, and tossed a 36-yard TD pass to Holmes that tied the game at 10. 
Hawk then came up with an interception and fumble recovery on consecutive series to give Ohio State the ball deep in Texas terri­tory. 
Both times the Longhorns stiff­ened and made the Buckeyes set­tle for field goals of 37 and 25 yards by Huston.

Belles drop road game against Flying Dutch 
Early morning road trip leads to sloppy play, 2-0 loss to Hope 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 

The rigors of travel, time and a tough oppo.nent caused the Belles trouble in a close­fought 2-0 defeat at the hands of the Flying Dutch of Hope College. 
The game, played at noon at Hope, worked against the Belles even prior to the start of the game. 
The long road trip in the early morning hours, along with the loss of an hour due to time zone differences, did not contribute to an .energetic 
Saint Mar) 's soccer team entering the pitch. 
These conditions would hin­der even thEJ most dominant team playing an inferior oppo­nent, but th'3 Belles were not playing a pushover -Hope is the cream of the MIAA crop and always a tough competitor for the women of Saint Mary's. 
Belles coach Caryn Mackenzie V\ as concerned that her players were not given the most ideal C·Jnditions to win a key MIAA conference game. 
"Hope just took advantage of [the inhibiting conditions];" she said. "They came with high energy, just out-pos­sessed and out-played us in the first half." 
The Flying Dutch registered their first g;oal shortly after the opening whistle, tickling the twine at the eight minute 

mark. Hope's Kristin Krcmar dribbled the ball into Saint Mary's penalty box and shot a cross over the middle to Linnae Klompmaker. Klompmaker headed the ball towards the back post, driving past the Belle's Laura Heline (5 saves) for the score. 
"The first lgoall was really great," Mackenzie said. "It was really hard to stop it, just how well it was timed. We did­n't defend it very well -it was a bit of a breakdown defensively for tis." 
Hope's control of the game did not end following the quick tally -18 minutes later the Flying Dutch added the insurance goal. Sarah Cochrane notched the tally unassisted past a tiring Belles' defense. 
The Belles reversed the flow of the game once the second half began, but could not put the ball past Hope goalkeeper Holly Nestle (seven saves on 10 shots). 
"We kept pressing, pressing but couldn't put the ball in the net," Mackenzie said. 
The Belles have been score­less for the past 270 minutes of play, their last goal coming in a double overtime victory over SUNY-Brockport in the Marietta College Classic. 
"It puts more pressure on the forwards than I wanted too," Mackenzie said. 
But that is not to say that there has been a lack of strong play from the Belles' attackers and midfielders. Carolyn Logan and Cat MacMillan tried to spark the fuse that would ignite a Belles' offensive explosion, but 
were unable to complete the feat. 
On defense, Carrie Orr was the backbone for the defensive four that handled the Flying Dutch attack competently, along with goaltender Heline, but did not receive the sup­port on offense necessary for victory. 
"It's back to the drawing board in terms of playing on the road," Mackenzie said. "I think we are about ready to turn a corner, so hopefully that will come to fruition on our home fie! d, after two weeks of playing on the road." 
The Belles will take these hopes into another. MIAA match-up with Albion College at home on Wednesday.

NCAA FOOTBALL 

LSU opens season in wake of Hurricane Katrina disaster 
Tigers' original first 

game was postponed 
after storm hit land 
Associated Press 

For LSU, football has a stark look this season. 
"This is not a made-for-TV movie," coach Les Miles said. "This was a real-life trauma where friends and family had to stay in the dorms and the town swelled to take in the New Orleans evacuees. We are treating people that are injured and disadvantaged 200 yards from our stadium. We have a scrimmage, and Blackhawk helicopters are fly­ing people from New Orleans over our heads." 
The fifth-ranked Tigers trav­eled halfway across the coun­try to play their "home" open­er Saturday night -a 35-31 victory over No. 15 Arizona State in Miles' debut as LSU's coach.
-The game should have been the second this season in Baton Rouge, La., but Hurricane Katrina washed out the opener against North Texas on Sept. 3. A week later, the Tigers were in Tempe, forced off campus by the 
influx of pE:ople who turned the basketball arena into what athletic director Skip Bertman called the largest triage center in the United States. 
"Our team has had the longest camp in the history of camps," Miles said. 
On Saturday night, JaMarcus Russell hoo1wd up with Early Doucet for a 39-yard touch­down on fourth down with 
1:13 to go to win it for the Tigers. 
This waE hardly smooth going for LSU. The Tigers committed 11 penalties for 100 yard;; and allowed Arizona State's Sam Keller to pass for four TDs and more yards (461) than LSU's team total (434). 
But LSU played like a national titlEJ contender at the end, outscoring Arizona State 28-14 in the fourth quarter with contributions everywhere -offense, defense and special teams. 
Even after Russell rolled right, reversed direction and threw an against-the-grain floater that Doucet grabbed and came down with his right foot in, th1~ defense had its work cut out. Keller went to work with 27-and 25-yard completiors, setting up the 

Sun Devils (1-1) on the LSU 28 with just under a minute left. 
Then the Tigers, who had to replace current NFL corner­backs Corey Webster and Travis Daniels this season, forced Keller into four straight incompletions and got the ball back. 
"I've never been in a game like this," defensive tackle Kyle Williams said. "It's good to come to Tempe and play against a good team that had one game up on us. We fought hard on both ends." 
The special teams made a 
big contribution. Mario Stevenson returned a field­goal attempt 55 yards after Claude Wroten blocked it, and Craig Steltz returned a blocked punt 29 yards 1:20 later, sending LSU to its first lead, 21-17, with 13:27 remaining. 
Joseph Addai scored two short-yardage TDs and had 109 yards on 16 carries. 
Keller was 35-of-56 for 461 yards in his third game as a starter, throwing scoring pass­es of 25 and 26 yards to Jamaal Lewis, 8 yards to Rudy Burgess and 4 yards to Mocy Mutz. 
Derek Hagan and Terry Richardson each had seven catches, and Hagan finished with 191 career receptions to move past John Jefferson (1974-77) for first in school history. 
"We had a couple of soft spots, and they were just mak­ing good plays against the calls we had," Steltz said. "We have an off-week coming up, and that is going to be some­thing that we improve on and get ready for Tennessee."

Irish take first in Valpo Invitational 
Freshman Rodriguezftnishes second to lead Notre Dame to win 
By CHRIS KHOREY Sports Writer 
Chris Hodriguez startnd his col­lege earner with a bang. 
The frnshman finished second ovnrall with a time of 26:01 to lnad Notre Dame to a win at tho Crusadnr Invitational Friday at Sunset llills Park in Valparaiso, Ind. 
Hodriguez attributnd his sue­c~nss to continuing to li1el strong deep into tho race. 
"I was li1Clling good, so I tried to go as fast as I could, and it workNI out," he said. 
Although it didn't show in his performance, Hodrigunz said tho transition from fivn-kilomnter 
(3.1 mile) races to eight-kilome­ter (5 milo) races was diiTicult. 
"Coing from 5K to HK is a huge dill"nrnnce," he said. "I delinitnly l'nlt it wlwn I got to the 5K point. I li11l like I should bn done, but I was only a litlle over half way." 
Hodriguez said thn longer dis­tances have. been noticeable in praetien as well. 
"J put in tho work this summer to prnparn, but training has still bc11m hard," lw said. 
Irish coach Joe Piano sent a young squad to the meet in order to crnate depth and rest front­runners Tim Moore, Kurt Benninger and Kaleb Van Ort, among others. Notre Dame still won the six-team meet with a scorn of 26 points, besting seeond place Oakland by nine points. 
Hodriguez led the way, but only 11 seconds behind him was Irish sophomore Zach Einterz, who finished third. Four more Irish runners finished in the top 10: sophomore James Millar took sixth, sophomore Brett Adams was seventh, sophomore Dan Bradley placed eighth and fresh­man Mark Monro finished ninth. 
Sophomore Mike Popejoy, sen­ior Tom Longo and freshman Kevin McFadden also competed. All linished in the~ top 30 of the 82-man field. 
Hodrigunz said the freshmen mainly ran together apart from the upperdassmen in pre-season training in order to ease their transition to collegiate distances. lie said that because of this, ho didn't realize how fast he and the others had become. 
"I wasn't running with the top guys. [Instead[ I was running with the freshmen, so I didn't have anyone to compare myself to," Hodriguez said. 
Oakland runner Adam Freezer was the individual ehampion, but fourth runner Paul Kulesik eould not get past the Irish pack of Millar, Adams, Bradley and Moore, and the Golden Grizzlies fell to seeond plaee. 
The meet featured mostly small schools. Western Illinois was a distant third with 110 points, followed by St. Joseph's and IUPUI. 
Valparaiso and Wisconsin­Green Bay tied for sixth, and Chieago State finished eighth with 260 points.

NO WOMEN'S CROSS COUNTRY 
Young teatn gets third at Valpo 
Underclassmen gain 
. . ' 
experzence zn year s opening competition 
By RYAN KIEFER Sports Writer 
Late summer heat and inexpe­rience took their toll on the Notre Dame women's cross country team Friday at the Crusader Invitational. 
The Irish tallied 72 points to match last year's third plaee fm­ish at the event, but coach Tim Connelly was not pleased with his team's results. 
"This was definitely not our best effort this afternoon," Connelly said. "We've trained a lot better than this, and I was disappointed at the way things turned out." 
The Irish chose to s1md their younger, less expnrienced run­ners to Valparaiso in an effort to build their conlidonce and give them the opportunity to race. 
Notre Dame's top runners con­tinued to train over the week­end. 
Junior Ann Mazur was the first Notre Dame runner to eross the line, finishing sixth in 2:~ minutes, 30 seconds for the six­kilometer course. Other Irish athletes who finished in the top 20 included freshman Boeea Bauman, who finished ninth in her first collegiate raee (23:35), sophomore Julie Opet (16th, 
23:41) and sophomore Allyson Parker (19th, 23:52). Loryn King, the lone eompotitor with significant top-seven experience, finished 25th. The senior com­peted in her first race in several months after sustaining an injury during the track season. 
Connelly said that tho heat adversely affected his runners as the race wore on. Temperatures approached 80 degrees by raee time Friday aftnrnoon. 
"We told them not to go out so fast beeause of the heat, but they did," Connelly said. "They got in trouble in the middle part of the race and had to deal with it. Some of thmn were able to compete and l'ight it, others worn not." 
Connelly saw a few bright spol'i in Friday's raee, induding the pnrlilrmanen of his top two finishers, Mazur and Bauman. 
"I did like thn raee that Ann and Bncea ran, but as a group, we should have done better," Connelly said. 
The Irish eoaeh fnlt his team was physically rnady to sueennd at Valparaiso, but also said that the intense training, eombined with a lack of experience, may have been rnasons for the subpar pnrforrnanee. Ito said his runners wore not rnstnd enter­ing the meet. 
Connelly made it dear, howev­er, that the goal is for his run­ners to bc1 in the best possible condition at the cmd of the sea­son and would sacrifice results in early sl1ason raees to mont this goal.

Belles take fifth at Wooster Invite 
Saint Mary's bounces back from two opening losses with three wins

The Saint Mary's volleyball team's performance at the Wooster Invitational this week­end was most accurately summed up in one word.

After losing their first two matches of the tournament Friday, the Belles roared back to win three straight matches Saturday, capturing fifth place out of eight teams. 
Belles coach Julie Schroeder­Hick was proud of her team's weekend effort.

SMC GOLF 
Belles struggle against Division I competition 
Mattia paces Saint Mary's in mostly large school tournament 
By ANNA FRICANO 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's golf team faced a multitude of challenges this weekend at the Notre Dame Invitational, not includ­ing the host of Division-I pro­grams that took part in the tournament. Unfamiliar territo­ry, uncomfortable temperatures and unexpected illness all pro­vided extra difficulty for the Belles, who accepted an invita­tion to be the only Division-III team at the annual event, host­ed by the Notre Dame women's golf team. 
Saint Mary's finished in last place out of 17 teams at the invitational, which Notre Dame won. The Irish finished nine strokes ahead of the runner-up, the University of Toledo, which was followed by Georgetown in third place. 
The weekE:nd marked the fourth time in six years that the Irish have elaimed the title at their home tournament. 
Five Saint Mary's women competed in lhe 54-hole tour­nament, which took place at Warren Golf Course, but senior and co-captain Nicole Bellino was forced to withdraw before the third round due to illness. 
Senior Meg.:m Mattia led the way for the Belles, finishing in 68th place oyerall with scores consistently in the mid-80s. Kirsten Fantom, also a senior and eo-captain for Saint Mary's, showed scores that reflected the general tJ·end of the team. 

Fantom struggled in the first round. finishing at 94, but improved her score by nine strokes in the second round. 
"Overall, I think we were pretty proud of sticking it out," Fantom said."I think we expected our numbers to be a little lower, but we shouldn't be ashamed at all of how it ended up." 
The invitational marked the first of its kind in which the Belles have competed, being a three-round tournament taking place over two days. And the· Warren Golf Course, located just northeast of campus, pro­vided a challenge in itself for Saint Mary's, which initially struggled on the greens. Their scores reflected the level of confidence they were able to gain after having played a round on Saturday. 
"Once we got over getting 
used to the greens we were able to get down our scores," Fantom said. 
The team went from an over­all score of 369 in the first round to 350 in the second round. The Belles were hin­dered in yesterday morning's third and final round, having only four golfers after Bellino withdrew. The team finished the last round with a score of 374. 
If there was one factor that the Belles did not let get to them, it was the level of intimi­dation that comes with being the only Division-III school up against 16 D-1 programs. 
Although Saint Mary's fin­ished in last place in the tour­nament, they were in no way blown out of the water by the competition. They were, for the most part, able to keep up with all of the groups in the tourna­ment. 
"I think it's good every once in awhile for Division-III teams to play bigger competition," Fantom said. "There's no rea­son to feel intimidated, [because) we're a good team overall. These girls are almost all scholarship -we just play for the love of the game." 
The 54 holes of golf that the women played this weekend should do well to prepare them for the first major competition of the year. On Wednesday, the Belles will travel to Calvin College to compete in the first MIAA competition of the sea­son. Expectations will continue to be high for the team, which hopes to capture its fourth MIAA title in a row.

Oklahoma struggles to replace former quarterback 
Without 2003 Heisrnan winner Jason White, Sooner offense stalls 
Associated Press 
Perhaps now Oklahoma fans truly appreciate Jason White. 
With the best quarterback in school history gone after six long years, the Sooners would probably do just about anything to have him -bad knees and all -back for a seventh sea­son. 
Neither of his two successors have been able to lead the Oklahoma offense with any level of success, and the No. 21 Sooners (1-1) decided a game and a half into their season that it might be better to go without the pass than to have either Rhett Bomar or Paul Thompson throwing the ball. 
The Sooners had 42 yards passing in Saturday's 31-15 win against Tulsa, their lowest total since throwing for 38 yards against Syracuse in 1997. The Sooners had never thrown for less than 100 yards in Bob Stoops' 80 previous games as Oklahoma's coach. They had only 12 8 passing yards in a 17­10 loss to TCU in Week 1. 
We need to develop a passing game that our players can exe­cute," Stoops said. "For what­ever reason for the past two weeks, what we have been doing hasn't been productive. That is being about as kind as r· can be. 
"We are not going to continue to go through the year like this and not be able to throw the football some " 
Adrian Peterson bailed out the Sooners a.gainst Tulsa, run­ning for 220 yards on 32 car­ries with three touchdowns. 
After going without a pass attempt in the second half against Tulsa. Stoops and offen­sive coordinator Chuck Long plan to thorc ughly re-evaluate -and not just the quarter­backs. They'll also examine whether jhfl team's current receivers can execute the same plays as thne receivers taken in the NFL draft during the off­season. 


"When we're as unproductive in two games as we've been, we have got to really be critical of what we're doing and what we're asking them to do," Stoops said. "Just because it's worked for us in the past, and it's worked well, doesn't mean it's going to." 
The coaches declined to say whether there might be anoth­er change at quarterback, but said the competition for the position will continue. 
Long said he never consid­ered replacing Bomar with Thompson. 
"We felt good about him being in there," Long said. "He's in command. He's good on the sideline. We wanted to keep that rhythm going if we could." 
White, who would win the Heisman Trophy in 2003, threw for 343 yards when he made his first collegiate start in 2001 against Baylor, but by that time he had already played in sever­al games as a backup over the course of 2 1/2 seasons. Bomar's first start came in his second game, with a receiving corps that includes four fresh­men. 
"You can slice it every way you want, but we're young and starting over," Long said. "I thought these guys had a little growth." 
Bomar was more confident than the coaches in his analysis of Oklahoma's passing game. 
"We have the plays that will work and we know what to do," Bomar said.

"Against Florida, in the sec­ond game, Ellen Heitzman came in for [Croal) and did a great job, had some great shots, so it was great to be able to see her and Madison Clark come off the bench and really contribute right away." 
The Irish were scheduled to play in the Sugar Bowl Classic in New Orleans this weekend, but the tournament has been cancelled because of Hurricane Katrina and the tragic situation in New Orleans. Their next scheduled match is Sept. 25 against Big East foe Seton Hall at the Joyce Center. Hather than taking the entire two­week hiatus, Notre Dame is working on scheduling a few matches. 
For now, the Irish won't dwell on their successes. 
"We're ready to keep working harder," Brewster said. "We have some other great teams

the most dedicated people I've ever met," she said. "She's des­tined for greatness because she works hard at it." 
Indiana's Shannon Johnson also shot a 223 to tie Nakazaki for the title. The Hoosiers fin­ished tied for tenth. 
Nakasaki, who became the first Irish player since Rebecca Hogers in 2000 to finish first in the NO Invitational, shot a 72 and a 73 in the first two rounds of competition, followed by a 78 on Sunday. 
"The first 36 holes I was eon­sistent, and the last round I only had one bad hole," Nakasaki said. 
The junior was not fazed by her success, however. She noted at least one area of her game that needed improve­ment. 
"I really have to work on my sand shot," she said. "I was blading it a little bit." 
Other scoring players for the Irish included senior Katie Brophy with a 236, junior Stacy Brown with a 237, senior Suzie Hayes with a 238 and sopho­more Jane Lee with a 239. 
Five other Irish players ­Lisa Maunu, Sarah Bassett, Alejandra Diaz-Calderon, Lauren Gebauer and Courtney Sullivan -competed in the tournament as individuals. Maunu and Gebauer, who shot a 234 and a 237, respectivoly, were in the top-five scores for coming up." 
Despite the 3-1 victory against the Trojan!;' -a team that has won two or the past three national championships and lost and in last year's title match -the Irish weren't completely pleased, Brewster said 
"Against USC, we didn't play as well as we would've liked," she said. 
It's not cockiness that makes Brewster and her teammates think such things. It's their desire to win, their awareness of th.eir limitless potential. Even after defeating tho intimi­dating Trojans, the pesky Sooners and the Gators -who had not been swept in more than two years -tho Irish aren't satisfied. 
The bar is that high. And they like it.

the Irish. 
King said good rounds by non-scoring players are indica­tive of a deep roster. 
"That happens to us a lot beeause we're a very deep team," she said. "It's very hard to choose five because we're such a deep team." 
King said she hopes the victo­ry will spur the Irish to a suc­cessful season in 2005-06. 
"This is what we hoped for," she said. "We wanted to start out our season with a win." 
The tournament marked the last Notre Dame Invitational for Illinois coach Paula Smith. The Hall of Farner, who has coached the lllini for 28 years, will retire after the season. She was hon­ored by King at the tournament awards ceremony. 
"Paula's one of the most kind­hearted people I've over met, and she will be greatly missed in thn coaching field," King said of her longtime rival. 
Toledo finished second in the tournament, followed by Big East member Georgetown. Bradley placed fourth, with Eastern Michigan only one stroke behind. Western Michigan and Xavier tied for sixth with team scorns of 950 with Illinois just one stroke behind thorn. Yale, the only Ivy League school in the field, lin­islwd eighth, followed immedi­ately by Winthrop. 
Indiana and Butler tiod for tenth. Boston Collego, Bucknell, Western Illinois, IUPUI and St. Mary's rounded out the lield.

Gordon 111isses chase for 2005 N ex tel title 
Four-time series champion fails to qualify for playoff 
Associated Press 

The sound of defeat echoed from Jeff Gordon's voice as he saw his chance at making the "Chase for the Nextel Cup" come to a screeching halt. 
"We're done now," Gordon said over the radio after scrap­ing the wall on lap 211 of Saturday night's NASCAR Chevy Hock & Roll 400 at Hichmond International Haceway. 
Gordon, who entered the decisive race 30 points out of lOth place, was forced to pit multiple times under caution to repair the damage to the right side of his No. 24 Chevrolet Monte Carlo. He returned to the track one lap down in 36th. 
Earlinr, after making a rou­tine stop for adjustments to his ill-handling car, Gordon had to pit a second time because of a loose lug nut on the left-rear tire. He returned from that mishap in 29th. 
"I knew we were in trouble," Gordon said. "I wasn't feeling too good about things when we started going backwards." 
He l'inished 30th to remain 12th in the standings, 83 points out of the 10th and final spot for the "Chase." The last time the four-time series champion finished· outside the top 10 in points was his rookie season of 1993. 
Gordon, who won three of the season's first nine events, has recorded as many top-1 0 finishes (9) as results of 30th or worse this year. He joins Dale Earnhardt Jr. as NASCAH's biggest names out of the cham­pionship hunt. 
"It's disappointing, but·it's been a disappointing year," Gordon said. "There are so many moments throughout the year where you can look back and say, 'Boy, if this could of happened, we could have been in the Chase.' But lately, things have not gone our way, and we haven't performed." 
Though angry and frustrat­ed, Gordon put missing a shot at his fifth series championship into perspective. 
''I've had some far more dis­appointing seasons than this one," Gordon said. "Life is still pretty darn good for Jlle right now. Hacing is not everything. I've put my heart and soul into it like this team does, and we want to win. But we also know at the end of the day, that it's not the number one thing in our lives."
