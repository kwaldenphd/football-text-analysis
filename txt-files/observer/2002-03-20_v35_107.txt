Leaders challenge policy with signs 

By HELENA PAYNE News Editor 
Student government's execu­tive cabinet sponsored the pub­lication of thousands of signs challenging the Notre Dame administration's decision to end in-hall dances, better known as "SYRs." 
The signs, which read, "We need a voice," and "Save the SYR," were distributed to the Hall President's Council Tuesday night as a protest of just one of the several regula­t i o n s announced See Also in the 
"Students voice

University's new alcohol opposition to new policy by 
alcohol policy"

vice presi­dent for pageB Student Affairs Father Mark Poorman Tuesday. The major changes included the ban of all hard alcohol in resi­dence halls, the end of in-hall dances and the enforcement of the rule that only students 21­years-old or older may host tail­gaters in a designated lot. 
"We're asking all the students to pul them in their windows and in their doors," said Student Body Vice President Brian Moscona. 
Members of the executive cabinet said they were disap­pointed that the administration did not seek more of their input before making the new alcohol policy. 
"The real frustration of exec­utive cabinet was about stu­dents having a voice in these decisions," said senior class president Peter Rossman. "It could be any big decision, not just alcohol." 
Moscona, who will be a resi­dent assistant in Stanford Hall next year, said the end of SYR dances will be detrimental to the Notre Dame residence hall life. The SYR, which stands for "Screw Your Roommate," is a casual to semi-formal dance in the dorm, usually with themes like O'Neill Hall's Mardi Gras or Lyons Hall's Luau. The original concept of the SYR was that students would get dates for their roommates, hence the expression, but now it varies depending on the dorm and the individual. 
'The SYR is a major part of Notre Dame tradition and it's a huge part of the residential community tliat we try to foster here at Notre Dame," said Moscona. 
Junior Amy O'Connor, the executive cabinet's Club Coordination Council athletic division representative, said she and others were shocked about the soon-to-end SYR tradition. According to O'Connor, there had been many rumors about banning hard alcohol, and addi­tional changes to the tailgating policy, but many were com­pletely unaware of the plans to move all dances out of the resi­dence halls. 
"The SYRs had seemed to just come out of the blue," said O'Connor. "To think when my brother comes here, he's not going to get to go to an SYR in his dorm, is something I can't believe." 
O'Connor said she was sym­pathetic of the administration's concern regarding alcohol use on campus, but she disagreed with the way it made the deci­sions.

Lehrer blasts entertainIDent news influence 
By KATE NAGENGAST 
News Writer 
Jim Lehrer, executive editor and anchor of "NewsHour with Jim Lehrer," admonished mod­ern media for the increasing influence of cable news net­works and sensationalism dur­ing his speech Tuesday at this year's Red Smith Lecture in Journalism in the Hesburgh Library Auditorium. 
Although cable news net­works such as CNN, MSNBC and Fox News have relatively small audiences compared to Lehrer's NewsHour on PBS, the news networks' pervasive pres­ence in newsrooms influences journalists, he said 
"People engaged in the prac­tice of journalism are watching cable news channels and this will have an enormous, but not necessarily a bad or an evil sig­nificance," said Lehrer. 'Tm waving a yellow flag of caution because cable news networks have air time to fill and excite­ment to generate -issues that arc not always related to news relevance." 
Lehrer cautioned that this quest to engage viewers is intriguing, but can also blur the line between entertainment and information. 
"There is an increasing ten­dency to see news as entertain­ment, not information," said Lehrer. "Using an entertaining way to inform is fine, but the purpose of news is to inform.... If you want to be entertained, go to the circus." 
At a time of when many inde­pendent news organizations are joining conglomerations, Lehrer stressed the importance of "independent news judge­ments ... for a fully functioning free press." 
Lehrer highlighted signs of hope in the industry as well, mostly credited to the after­math of Sept. 11. 
"There is and has been a serious world out there that deserves to be covered serious­ly," said Lehrer. "You cannot tell American people that the world is getting smaller and then not tell them what's going on in the rest of the world." 
To demonstrate how drasti­cally things have changed in the last six months, Lehrer revealed that during his early years in journalism his col­leagues coined the term "Afghanistanism" to describe stories considered irrelevant to the American public. "But nothing is irrelevant anymore," he said. 
Lehrer responded to ques­tions from the standing-room­only audience on a variety of topics including how he decides what to discuss on his show,

Thieves take cash 
from 
SMC choir 
By SHEILA EGTS Saint Mary's Editor 
A total of $2,335 dollars was stolen on March 11 from the purses of about 30 Saint Mary's students while they were on tour with the College choir in Redmond, Wa., according to a King County police report. 
The Saint Mary's choir toured the Pacific Northwest, giving performances at area churches as part of their spring break tour. The money was stolen during the first half of their concert · at Washington Cathedral, between 7 and 7:45 p.m. 
The thieves stole cash only from the women's purses, which were unattended in an upper room of the church. 
Nancy Menk, chair of the Saint Mary's Department of Music noticed the money was missing when the choir went back to the dressing room at intermission. 
Karen Webb Wasserman, an "88 Saint Mary's alumna, was present at the performance and happened to overhear Menk give news of the theft to two choir members while she was purchasing a CD. 
"There was a short delay, but just a few minutes later the choir ushered back in and retook the stage, several of them wiping away their tears as they walked," said Wasserman. "Without a word about the incident, they began the second half of their reper­toire. The audience gave them a standing ovation for their superb performance." 
A' church leader asked that a special collection be taken up after the performance to help reimburse the loss. The collection amounted to more than the stolen money. 
"I was able to reimburse each student for her loss the following morning, and the rest of the tour continued without any problems," said Menk. "We made sure our belongings were locked up while we were singing, how­ever. 
According to Menk, the choir plans to return the tick­et sale proceeds to the Washington Cathedral to put toward their mission Guatemala.

INSIDE COLUMN 


Are you called? 
As the end of the school year approaches and graduation looms overhead, those of us who are seniors have to look at where we stand and where we will be in the next couple months. This is a time that will get us ready for the rest of our lives. It is during this 
time that we get ready to leave our haven at Notre Dame and prepare to take on the world. 
In this time of decisions, we must be willing to look at every option, explore every opportunity, and jump at every chance we 


have to make sure that we Angela Campos don't accidentally miss something really important. We must also make sure we Lab Tech don't walk past our voca­tions. 
Did she just say what we all just thought she said? Did she say vocation? I don't want a vocation ... l just want to get a good job. I just want to help people through service. I just want to live out my dream. 
For one thing, everyone is called to a voca­tion. A vocation is a summons or strong incli­nation to a particular state or course of action. or the work in which a person is regularly employed. That job that you always wanted as a consultant with Deloitte & Touche or as a programmer with Microsoft could be your vocation. Teaching children could be your vocation. You could be called to a religious vocation. Your vocation could be documenting tribes along the Amazon and Congo rivers. It could be helping the poor and the sick to find help. Or to counsel, console and help those people who have problems or are going through hard times. It could just be to give ser­vice. 
How do you know that you are called to a particular vocation? For one, don't count any­thing out. You might find that your branch of Microsoft is sponsoring a computer field day for elementary school kids and, while you are there helping out, you discover that you are really good at helping the kids understand how things work. So you start volunteering at the local elementary school or recreation center. You were called to work with kids, but would not have necessarily realized it if you had not worked at that particular Microsoft branch. 
Likewise, don't limit what you allow yourself to do. There are so many ways for people to find their vocations. Some people know that they can make a rational choice to be a football player, a priest, a teacher, or a lawyer. Others take a little persuasion from fate by being in the right place at the right time. Some people go through three, four or more occupations (or companies) before they find what they really want to do. or know what they need to do. 
So, to all of you seniors out there: good luck in finding your vocation. Be open to the spec­trum of opportunities that is open to you. Listen. Are you being called?

Virginia student's death raises depression issues 
CIIARLOTTESVILLE, Va. 
The death of junior Aaron John Fox in his father's home over spring break has brought the issue of sui­cide among college students to the forefront of the University communi­ty. 
The details of Fox's death had not been released as of Monday, but it has been identified as suicide. 
The Office of the Dean of Students "received word from his father, say­ing he was comfortable with people knowing the manner of his [Aaron's] death," Dean of Students Penny Rue said. 
A memorial service for Fox was held Friday in Fairfax, Va., at Everly Funeral Home. 
Individuals wishing to offer condo­lences to Fox's family may contact the Office of the Dean of Students at

UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
Student suicide opposes privacy 
LOS ANGELES 
A negligence lawsuit involving student and parent rights has sparked a national debate on where confi­dentiality lines should be drawn, but University of Southern California will continue to follow federal law when dealing with student privacy. USC strictly follows the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act when it comes to disclosing information, said Ken Taylor, director of the Office of Residential and Greek Life. The act prevents colleges and universi­ties from disclosing any personal information about students. "We judge everything on a case-by-case basis," Taylor said. "We follow federal law. The cri­teria for disclosing any student information is as the law dictates." The only exception is if the situation is a life-threatening emergency -a situation the par­ents of Elizabeth Shin, a sophomore who committed suicide at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said they believe she was facing.

Since 1950, the suicide rate among college-age women has more than doubled, and the rate among college-age men has tripled. 
While some individuals do not show any sign they are contemplat­ing suicide, some give warning sig­nals in a "cry for help." 
Depressed individuals are most susceptible to suicide. More than 95 percent of all suicide victims were depressed before death. 
"They may say something like, 'Everything would be better off without me.' Or 'It doesn't matter. I won't be around much longer, any­way,' according to the Web site for Suicide Awareness Voices for Education. "We need to 'key into' phrases like those instead of dis­missing them as just talk."

Federal Bureau of Investigation agents arrested a Harvard University Kennedy School of Government (KSG) student Friday at Peabody Terrace on charges he allegedly embezzled $3.35 million from a Hong Kong company.

U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston. The Hong Kong war­rant for Fung's arrest, issued Dec. 21, 2001, describes his nationality as British and Canadian. According to the KSG registrar's office, Fung is registered there as Edward Fong, the same name he uses on his Canadian passport.

The increase of file-sharing on web sites like Audiogalaxy.com has prompted the Office of Information Technologies to adopt new ways to control net­work traffic. 
OIT's two main solutions cur­rently are to provide more band­width for users of ResNet by adding a second Internet service prnvider (ISP) and to cap the amount of network bandwidth available to an individual user. 
"The growth of demand fur network bandwidth and the growth in utilization of the net­tional activity." 
Klimek said he and other OIT 
employees had noticed that 
more students were using band­
width on sites such as 
Audiogalaxy .com and 
Gnutella.com, which are most 
often used to download music in 
the form of MP3 files. 
Also, called peer-to-peer pro­
tocols, MP3 file-sharing Web 
sites can clog the Internet and 
slow down the speed of 
browsers or other online activity 
for network users. 
"At one point, all the traffic with the peer-to-peer protocols used for downloading files off the Internet substantially incrc~sed the demands for Internet bandwidth," said Klimek. "It impacted the [net­·work's] pe"rformance for the entire campus. It made it diffi­cult to browse the Internet to do 
any work." 
In order to reduce the network 
congestion, OIT has engaged in 
a task called "packet shaping," 
which allows the OIT staff to 
control the Internet trafTic for a 
particular protocol. 
"Shaping is a way of allocating 
bandwidth," said Klimek. "That 
means you can define a half a 
meg[abyte per second] for a spe­
cific purpose." 
In the case of protocols like 
the popular file-sharing site 
Audiogalaxy, Klimek said OTT 
has designated exactly one-half 
a megabyte p"er second to that 
site for the entire campus. 
"It's a trade-off," said Klimek. 
"We're giving you faster brows­
ing performing and slower 
downloading performance." 
Through "shaping," Klimek 
and Wishon said OIT hopes to make browsing the Internet quicker and monitor the exces­sive use of certain protocol. 
So far, the following sites have been shaped: Aimster,. Audiogalaxy, Directconnect, Gnutella, !mesh, Kazaa, Napster, and Edonkey2000. 
"We allocated a certain amount of bandwidth to each protocol," Klimek said. 
Although rumors had circulat­ed before the mid-semester break that Audiogalaxy had been blocked, or "firewalled," Klimek and Wishon said that was not the case. 
"[There is] no firewall in place at the university," Wishon said. "Orr is not blocking access to Audiogalaxy or any other file­sharing or peer networking. pro­tocols or servers." 
OIT has been packet shaping since the last academic year when the heightened use of Napster became an issue on campus as well as at other insti­tutions. 
Wishon said, although all incoming students learn about rules regarding the use of the network, they need to respect those rules. The OTT web site, www.nd.edu/~ndoit, contains a responsible use policy under the link titled "Getting Started with IT." 
"We provide access to the net­work principally to support the educational objectives of the university and that will always be our first priority," Wishon said. 
Contact Helena Payne at payne.30@nd.edu. 
work participation by students in the residence halls has exceeded our ability to deliver," said Gordon Wishon, chief infor­mation officer. 
Before the mid-semester break, OIT had the limited band­width of 20 megabytes per sec­ond for the entire campus net­work with the Genuity, a nation­al company. However, OlT has now doubled the campus bandwidth through Gra.mtel, a local ISP that "provides good, reliable, redundant access to the Internet," Wishon said. 
OIT has beeu planning this change for the last six months, but many of the final steps took place during the break.

"The added bandwidth means you won't be competing with the rest of campus for bandwidth," said manager of OIT network engineering Tom Klimek. "I think you'll notice a perfor­mance boost." 
However, with this rise in net­work performance, OIT staff said they would continue to monitor the network space that students use for non-academic activities, like downloading from file-sharing Web sites. 
"OIT is not blocking any of those applications," said Wishon. "We are, however, cap­ping their utilization during periods of high network activity ... to give preference to educa­

President Brooke Norton said. 
"We wanted to show that as students we are a strong com­munity and are a voice for change on this campus," ­Norton said. 
The action comes just two days after Vice President for Student Affairs Father Mark Poorman unveiled the three policy changes: 
. 
the outlaw of "hard alco­hol" in undergraduate resi­dence halls 

. the ban of in-hall dances 

. 
and the revision of tailgat­ing rules to allow 21-year-old students to host parties in des­ignated par!<ing lots before home football games · 


University officers will likely formally approve the changes this summer and enact them in the fall. 
Norton criticized University officials for not working close­ly with students to rewrite the policy. 
"We weren't able to be a part of this before Monday," she said. "We needed to do something to show that we are concerned and want to get students involved." 
Norton expected that several student leaders, including her­tions and worries. Organizers will field questions on stage at the meeting, and designated people with notepads will be available to write down ques­tions and deliver them to stu­dent leaders for answers later. 
"We want students to feel like we're listening," Bishop said.

"With the war on terrorism and the prospect of starting war with Iraq, what better opportu­nity to speak out against vio­lence and injustice than now?" 
These complex issues that the speakers will address include ethnic and religious dimensions of conflict, multi-faceted solu­tions for peace and develop­ment, the role of youth, media and military in the advance­ment of' peace and more. 
A number of the students involved with the conference are from Notre Dame, but there are also presenters from many Midwest colleges including Western Michigan University, Kent State, Purdue University and St. John's University. 
Kristin Corcoran, committee head on panelists presenters, said there was a great response to the invil.ations to speak but unfortunately not enough fund­ing to fly presenters in from around the world. 
"We had responses from all over the world including Uzbekistan and the Balkans," said Corcoran. 
Many of the presenters have had some kind of experience with their topic through intern­ships, studying abroad or class­es. Lauren Berrigan, presenting on Nuclear Weapons, had an internship last semester in Washington D.C. and is dis­cussing issues that she researched. Berrigan sees the topic as one that is not easily understood because it can get very technical but is very important to explain and teach. 
"I want to educate people to the [nuclear weapon] threat out there. It's an issue that needs to be constantly presented and addressed," said Berrigan. 
Liam Dacey will be critically analyzing how the media has sensationalized and spun the news and the possible role for 
2112 
the media to play in peace. 
"You rarely see peace advo­cates on the major networks. In recent years the media has twisted the underlying issues," said Dacey. 
Dacey planned on drawing on the examples like the media coverage of the WTO demon­stration in Seattle in 1999. 
Beth Krause and the Notre Dame Take Ten team will fea­ture area elementary children to present their award winning essays and posters addressing conflict management in elemen­tary school. 
The conference will feature not only peace studies minors and government majors but also students majoring in film, biology and pre-medical stud­ies. Boyd hopes the conference will reach the nontraditional humanity and peace studies group and highlight the impor­tance of being aware of interna­tional and domestic events for college students. 
"Often as college students we can become immersed in the 'bubble,' oblivious to what is going on in the world around us," Boyd said. 'The conference is a forum where undergradu­ate students have the opportu­nity to engage in open dialogue with other undergraduates and experts about a variety of peace and social justice issues." 
Registration will take place from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Friday and Saturday from 9 a.m. to noon at the Krock Institute

PAKISTAN 



Associated Press 
ISLAMABAD 
Islamabad's police chief and four other senior poUce officials were fired Tuesday after a deadly grenade attack on a Protestant church frequented by for­eigners. 
The shake-up came as police said they would send the United States DNA sam­ples from the body of a man they suspect carried out the attack that killed five peo­ple, including two Americans. 
Forty-five people, most of them foreigners, were injured when an attacker hurled grenades in the church in a heavily guarded diplomatic quarter near the 

U.S. Embassy during a Sunday morning service. 
The attack on the Protestant International Church has prompted the State Department to warn Americans against traveling to Pakistan. Agents from the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security will help with the investigation. 
The president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, ordered "imme­diate and effective steps" to improve law and order after meeting with top security officials and regional officials Tuesday to review the case. 
The government announced the dismissal of Islamabad's police chief and four other top police officials in the capital. 
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but investigators focused on Islamic extremists who were outraged by Musharraf's support for the United States in its war on terrorism. 
Attacks linked to Muslim militants have surged throughout Pakistan since Musharraf banned five Islamic extremist groups in January. 
The Pakistani newspaper Dawn said Tuesday that the "abject failure" of law enforcement agencies to counter the militant threat called the sincerity of Musharrafs crackdown into question. 

Another newspaper, The Nation, reported that police were investigating whether the attacker was linked to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida terrorist network. 
A senior Interior Ministry official said authorities believe the church was attacked because of the large num­ber of Americans and other foreigners in the congregation. 
However, he said investi­gators are also looking into the possibility that Christians -regardless of nationality -were the tar­gets.

Jury mulling over evidence in dog attack 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES 

The dog-mauling trial that began with a defense attorney crawling on the courtroom floor during her opening statement neared its end with a judge threatening to lock her up if she didn't sit down and keep quiet. 
Jurors began deliberating the case on Tuesday following a stormy closing rebuttal by the prosecution during which Nedra Ruiz was rebuked for her interruption. 
"Take your seat now and do not get up again or your next objection will be made from the holding cell behind you," Superior Court Judge James Warren warned. 
Ruiz represents Marjorie Knoller, who is charged with second-degree murder, involun­tary manslaughter and owning a mischievous dog that killed a person. She was walking her two huge presa canario dogs when they mauled neighbor Diane Whipple to death in January of 2000. 
Knoller, 46, could get 15 years to life in prison if convict­ed. Her 60-year-old husband, Robert Noel, faces involuntary manslaughter and keeping a mischievous dog that killed a person and could get up to four years. 
Ruiz had tried to argue that prosecutor Jim Hammer was misinterpreting a piece of evi­dence when the courtroom fire­works erupted. The judge said Hammer was entitled to give his own interpretation. 
Warren had also rebuked Ruiz at the beginning of the trial for crawling on the floor during her opening statement. 
Hammer told the jury it was clear the defendants ignored repeated warnings that their dogs, Bane and Hera, were dangerous. 
He also criticized Ruiz for accusing Whipple's domestic partner, Sharon Smith, of lying on the witness stand when she said Whipple had been bitten by one of the dogs before and was afraid of them. 
Hammer declined to respond to another of Ruiz's statements during her closing argument on Monday, that the prosecution was trying to curry favor with the San Francisco homosexual community by bringing the case. Whipple was gay. 
The case was moved to San Francisco because of pretrial publicity.

Students voice opposition to new alcohol policy 
By MEGHANNE DOWNES Assistant News Editor 
Between classes, on the quad, in the dining hall, and at LaFortune, the topic of discus­sion for many students yesterday was the proposed changes sug­gested by Father Mark Poorman to the University's alcohol policy. 
Students expressed surprise and irritation at these changes that will affect in hall dances, tailgating regulations and hard alcohol consumption. 
"People will drink regardless. I don't understand how they will find out who is drinking hard liquor," said off-campus senior Eileen Lewis. "Moving off cam­pus is becoming more popular and for people who are on the brink this could push them. I also think that moving the dances is ridiculous and by doing so they are taking away something that is a tradition and a poor decision." 
Many students are concerned with the effect that these pro­posed changes would have on dorm life. Notre Dame prides itself on its strong residential life program. 
"It really disrupts the whole concept of residential life that Notre Dame advocates," said junior Miguel Vieyra. "Since we were freshmen they talked about the uniqueness of residential life here and that will be changed because this policy will be forc­ing students off campus. There won't be that sense of unity in the halls." 

According to Vieyra, he has to assume next year. Ewing heard several students. who believes an RA has the role of either were not considering to being a friend but also a facilita­move off campus or whom he tor to ensure there is a certain would not have expected to level of responsibility. move off campus, discussing "It will turn the role of the RA how these changes could effect into a policeman," said Ewing. their decisions about remaining "J\ person will be less likely to on campus. approach you with problems if

According  to  sophomore  

Elizabeth Martin, an resident assistant that she spoke with was concerned with how the atmosphere of the dorm would change because unique person­alities would be absent. This new policy would almost certain­ly increase the number of stu­dents moving off campus. 
Lane Ewing, an RA at Sorin Hall, expressed concern about the new role that RAs will have

According to Rrinkman, future RAs commented to her that they would not be overtly fervent in enforcing alcohol policy should it be passed. 
There has not been a revision in the University's alcohol policy in the past fourteen years, and some wonder if the current pro­posal could signal an even stricter policy in the future.

Many students expressed con­cern about the fairness of adopt­ing the amendment that would eliminate hard alcohol from resi­dence halls, including students who are over 21. 
"I understand where they are coming from, but I don't think it's fair to say that even if you arc 21 you can't have hard liquor," said Brinkman. 
Dooley said, "It's the University's policy and they can do what they want but it is somewhat unfortunate." 
According to students, stricter alcohol policies would force more students to leave campus to drink. Many believe that this would create more problems and possibly raise the incidents of alcohol-related accidents as students find their ways back to campus after drinking. 
"There should be communica­tion and education instead of restriction," said Martin. 
Other students pointed out the discrepancies between the poli­cies on hard alcohol and tailgat­ing. 
The letter says, "Students, regardless of age, will not be allowed to possess or consume 'hard' alcohol in undergraduate halls.... Undergraduate students who are 21 years of are may host tailgate gatherings in a des­ignated parking lot on home football Saturdays, provided that these gatherings are properly registered." 
"I thought that it was really interesting they changed the tail­gating policy to follow state law,

two Emmys, Lehrer received the National Humanities Medal in 1999 in addition to a num­ber of other journalistic achievements. 
"I was 16-years-old when I decided to write," said Lehrer "And I've been in journalism every day since." 
"Jim is a journalist who has a clear understanding of who he is and what his role should be, he doesn't confuse himself with the story ... and that sets him apart," said Terence but they changed the dorm poli­cy to be further from state law," said Martin. 

Sophomore Paul Madrid won­dered if the provisions outlined in the tailgating policy were made to placate those who were over 21 who objected to other aspects of the alcohol policy. 
"It basically says that we will let you tailgate but hard liquor will not be tolerated," said Madrid. 
Many saw the new proposal as detracting from the traditions that exist at Notre Dame. Tailgating and SYRs are the lat­est traditions that seem to be facing impending extinction such as Sophomore Siblings Weekend and the Graffiti Dance. 
Many believe that moving SYRs outside of the dorm would negatively affect the hall atmos­phere because of the section or floor unity that it creates through pre-dance related con­tests, activities and decorating. 
"Tailgating and SYRs are two major things that make Notre Dame what it is," said sopho­more Ana Farach. "It will change the traditional flare of residential life." 
Students surprised by these unexpected changes, as student government was not consulted or asked for input in any way. 
"I wasn't angered so much by the loss of alcohol. That students were not involved in the process angered me the most," said Vierya.

Captured Afghns not al-Qaida 

By ANDREW THAGARD 
Assisrant News Editor 
Latin American Cardinal Oscar Andres Rodriguez Maradiaga referred to Oscar Romero, the famous Salvadoran bishop assassinated in March 1980, as a model for all Catholic bishops and remembered him from pro­fessional and personal experi­ence in a Tuesday evening lec­ture. 
"I was moved by his profound piety and his simplicity," Rodriguez said of everybody's radio," he said. 
Romero also used his power as Archbishop to comment on the political and social scene in his war-torn country -a practice that led to his martyrdom, according to Rodriguez. 
"I have no ambition of power and because of that I tell those in power what is good and bad," Rodriguez recalled Romero as saying. 
Although Romero's death was a tragedy, the Cardinal said, it also had positive consequences, including an increase in voca­tions and the estab­

lt's an example of what has been called the invisihle part of the war against terror. 
American forces swoop down on a suspected al-Qaida or Taliban hide-out, some­times raiding unoccupied sites, where they collect only intelli­gence, sometimes taking pris­oners. Sometimes the prison­ers arc nothing more than ordinary Afghans.

U.S. general details about
Tuesday. 
The devel­opment highlights difficulties the U.S.­led coalition faces to figure out who's who in a nation where lawlessness is rampant and one-time supporters switched sides after the harsh Taliban governing system fell. 
It also highlights the difficul­ty in collecting good intelli­gence as coalition forces seek out scattered and hiding enemy fighters. 
Additionally, it is an example of operations rarely talked about openly by the Pentagon. Sunday's raid was made pub­lic, but an unknown number of others with similar outcomes have remained secret, defense officials said. 
After watching and gather­ing intelligence, American forces detained 31 suspected 
al-Qaida or Taliban fighters Sunday in what they called a military compound near the southern Afghan city of Kandahar. 
"We continue to screen them to determine exactly who they are,"Maj. Ralph Mills, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command, said Tuesday night. 
Two other defecse officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that upon interrogating the detainees, Americans found they were not wanted by the United States in its campaign to root terrorists out of Afghanistan. 
They said 
the men 
the opera· 

tion except to say U.S. forces went into the compound some 40 miles west of Kandahar and detained the 
31. The capture came as coali­tion forces were winding down Operation Anaconda, a 2,000­troop assault to kill or capture al-Qaida and Taliban fighters believed regrouping in eastern Afghanistan. 
"Over the last two weeks most of the focus has been in and around Anaconda ... our largest offensive," Gen. John Rosa Jr. told reporters Monday. 
"But we continue to surveil. We continued our intelligence efforts all through the coun­try,"he said. "It's ongoing, and the key indicators made us believe that we needed to go into that compound." 
Before Anaconda, the last known ground operation was on Jan. 23, when U.S. special forces raided a compound where the United States mis­takenly believed enemy figures were holed up. 
The Pentagon has said 16 people who turned out not to be to al-Qaida or Taliban were killed when they resisted and another 27 captured were later released to Afghan authorities. 
Smaller. undisclosed raids took place before and after the Jan. 23 raid, otftcials have said privately. Those raids concen­trated on gathering informa­tion about pockets of resis­tance and at times netted doc­um ents or individuals who were interrogated or then released, officials said. 
On Sunday, a team of Army Special Forces soldiers attacked a convoy that American intelligence had been watching, three vehicles traveling about 45 miles southwest of the city of Gardez. Sixteen people in the convoy were killed, and the military said they were believed to be al-Qaida fight­ers. One man was detained, officials said. 
Although Anaconda was the largest U.S. ground operation in the war, it is not expected to be the last. 
On Wednesday, gunmen attacked U.S. coalition forces in eastern Afghanistan, touch­ing off a firefight that last~d several hours, a U.S. military spokesman said. 
One U.S. soldier with the . 101st Airborne Division was shot in the arm during the attack in the city of Khost, which is on the southeastern end of the valley where Operation Anaconda was staged. 


people watched a video presen­tation of the speech. "If you will allow me this daring statement, he was the most beloved martyr of the 20th century." 
Romero, according to Rodriguez, was a brilliant leader who had the power to instill hope in even the most desperate people. 
"A leader is someone with a clear idea who can communicate it and who moves forward giving witness to it," he said. 
Romero, Rodriguez said, had these qualities and used them to spread a message of hope. 
"After Sept. 11, it is difficult to talk about hope," he said. "fn a global world it is also difficult to 
talk about hope  as  poverty  
increases. What  was  Oscar  
Romero's secret?"  

Romero, according to the Cardinal. focused on the hope of Easter. promoting it in his first Pastoral letter as Archbishop. 
"The Easter Church is a Church of the cross, of hope, of power, of contemplation. This was the Church of Archbishop Romero's dreams -a Church that· exists here and now," Rodriguez said. "Focusing the Church on Raster is a brilliant move, to say Easter is to say unfailing hope." 
People, the Cardinal said, jumped at the opportunity to hear Romero speak. 
"It was said that during the eight o'clock Mass in the towns and vi!Jages you could walk up and dov.n the street and see that Archbishop Romero was on ney," he said. "People like Archbishop Romero restore our pride in being Christians and Latin Americans. With Bishops like him the Church can stand for hope in the world." 
Rodriguez also remembered the person behind the title, recalling Romero as a timid, lit­tle man filled with God who had compassion and a special rela­tionship with the poor. 
"His priest friends remember him as a man of God with fer­vent discipline of prayer with love of confession and love of the Gospel," the Cardinal said. 
As a person, Rodriguez said that Romero could often be impatient and shy, but he was also a man filled with the Holy Spirit and gave an air of being in perpetual conversion. 
Progress is being made as a result of Romero's work, Rodriguez said. 
"We have seen little steps but strong steps in the right direc­tion," he said. 
The Tuesday night lecture "Archbishop Romero: A Bishop for the Third Millennium" was sponsored by the Kroc and Kellogg Institutes. 
Rodriguez is the archbishop of Tegucigalpa and Honduras' first cardinal. He has served as a Vatican representative on Third World debt to the International Monetary fund and the World Bank.

Scene Editor 
The Saint Mary's campus may have a wrinkle in time this week­end as the Saint Mary's Department of Communication, Dance and Theatre opens its spring 2002 show "The Learned Ladies." 
The French playwright Jean­Baptiste Poquelin, better known by his penname Moliere, finished "The Learned Ladies" in 1672 after working on the script for four years, which is notable because most of his plays were completed in a matter of months. 
"The Learned Ladies" was Moliere's penultimate play; he completed the farcical "La Malade Imaginaire" before his death a year later. "The Learned Ladies" is Moliere's least performed play, although there has been resur­gence in interest since Richard Wilbur's translation of the show began to be produced in 1982. Wilber's translation, which is used by Saint Mary's, rhymes in five-foot iambic pentameter as opposed to the original French that follows the 12-foot Alexandrian meter. 
Most of Moliere's work was done under the command of King Louis XIV. The king was a deep­pocketed patron of the arts and paid many artists for command performances before his court. It was the king's court that Moliere often lampooned in his comedies. Although Louis XIV's sponsorship of Moliere may seem philanthrop­ic, his underlying motivation is much more self-serving. By creat­ing an extremely class-conscious society, Louis XlV's nobility bus­ied themselves trying to out-dress and outwit each other instead of plotting rebellions. 
"The Learned Ladies" follows the farcical courtships in the house of a well-to-do 17th centu­ry French bourgeois Chrysale (played by Saint Mary's director of Special Events Hichard Baxter). When Chyrsale's youngest daugh­ter, Henriette (played by junior Maria Conticelli). sets her sights on marriage, she is chastised by her older sister, Armade (played by Saint Mary's freshman Nicole Hogarty), for pursuing base activ­ities unlike herself and their phi­losophy-reading, self-proclaimed intellectual, shrew of a mother, Philamente (play by Saint Mary's junior Merideth Pierce). 
But Henriette persuades her lover, Clitandre (played by Vini DeDario). to attempt to win the favor of the matriarchal Philamente by feigning interest in her and her entourage's intellec­tual pursuits and gaining the favor of Philamente's cronies. Unfortunately, Clitandrc's plan fails when Chyrsale's megaloman­ical sister, Belise (played by Saint Mary's junior !leather Muth), interprets his pleas for her sup­port in his suit as a clandestine way of hitting on her. 
Exasperated, Clitandre implores Chyrsale's brother, Ariste (played by Greg Melton), to take his suit directly to Chrysale himself. Chrysale approves of the match and vows to inform his domineer­ing wife of his decision. But before he can get the words out of his mouth, Philamente informs him that she has chosen one of her "cultured" acquaintances to be llenriette's betrothed: the fop­p is h Trissotin (played by Holy Cross sophomore Shane Lewis). 
Faced with Philamente's procla­mation, the lovers hatch new schemes· to dispose of Trissotin and gain the family's consent in their marriage. 
"The Learned Ladies" features some marvelous acting, especially from Baxter whose hysterical facial expressions and razor sharp timing lead to big laughs. Muth's over-the-top rendition of the spacey Belise is certain to bring down the house too. Along with Lewis' gives-a-new-meaning­to-the-word "pompous" perfor­mance as Trissotin, the cast of "The Learned Ladies" will have the audience falling out of their scats. As an ensemble, the group's obvious dedication and hard work pays off. 
The Saint Mary's production of the show also includes a framing play, which was written by tl~e show's dramaturge Henee Kingcaid. The framing play is set at Saint Mary's where the produc­tion of "The Learned Ladies" is in l'ull-swing. A student, Sarah (played by Saint Mary's junior Erin Schultz). struggling to learn her lines and trying to come to terms with the meaning of the show, is visited by the ghosts of Moliere (played by Notre Dame fifth-year graduate student Troy Feay) and le Tartuffe (played by Notre Dame Associate Professor of Homancc Languages and Literature Louis MacKenzie). a.

character from one of Moliere's most famous plays of the same name. Moliere's phantasm acts as Sarah muse and helps her to understand why the play is not misogynistic even though it is making fun of educated women. 
The framing piece over-ago­nizes the meaning of the play, attempting to explicitly justify the show's role at a women's college. This hyper-sensitivity to the slightest possibly of offending the College's character reflects the disturbing trend of tacit and self­imposed censorship in theatre on the Saint Mary's campus preva­lent in the last few years. Campus theatre patrons have witnessed a decline from the blatant censor­ship of "The Vagina Monologues" to a tamed version of "The Keenan Revue" to a politically correct situating of Moliere. 
Moliere's words speak for them­selves. It is obvious that he was not ridiculing educated women, but rather pretension. The fram­ing ·piece, in one sense, detracts from Moliere's intent of making fun of the very people that were in his audience. Ironically, if one were offended on behalf of Saint Mary's by the lines Moliere uses, he or she would, in fact, be pre­tentious and rightly ridiculed by the show. At times the framing piece comes close to insulting the audience's intelligence. 
The framing piece is, however. well-written and Schultz, Feay and MacKenzie are entertaining in their roles. Although it adds time to the two hour and 15 minule show. the framing piece does elaborate on a few theatrical conventions and philosophic points that the audience would otherwise almost certainly miss. In the end, the framing piece is entertaining to watch with its anachronistic humor, but adds only a moderate amoun l to the overall show's meaning. 
The Saint Mary's production of "The Learned Ladies" strives to recreate the setting in which the play was originally produced. 
"We wanted to be as historically authentic as we could in Lhe pre­sentation in the show," Kingcaid said. 
Doing so is a daunting task, but 1.he crew pulls it off quite nicely. The elaborate costumes and make-up were researched thor­oughly by Kingcaid. Further. because parts of the show are politically referential poetry in French, Kingcaid often had to go beyond simple meanings and find out to what Moliere may have been subtly referring. 
Kingcaid also researched what a 17th century French bourgeois salon looked like and the results are stunningly accurate. The stage looks like something out of a painting. 
The director, Mark Abram­Copenhaver, knew from the beginning that the show would be challenging to produce from the acting standpoint as well. 
"There are so many technical things that have to be dealt with: how to move in the corset. how to move even for the men who aren't corseted, how you carry your body. And then, once you mater the physical life of the characters, it's important for the actors to start to deal with the fact that the play is in rhyme. Every other line rhymes," Abram-Copenhaver said. 
Abram-Copenhaver even brought in a motion coach, junior Adrienne DeGraffe, to teach the cast how to carry themselves in the proper 17th century French manner. The women were all required to wear corsets and pet­ticoats from the beginning of the rehearsal process to give them an idea of what (and how uncomfort­able} their costumes would be. 
Kingcaid taught members of the cast some French so they could recite their lines or catch their cues; as a result, the ensemble has impeccable French accents. 
"It's been difficult, but it's been a good experience because you learn so much," Conticelli said. 
"The Learned Ladies" opens tomorrow night and runs through Saturday night at 8 p.m., there will be a matinee on both Saturday and Sunday at 2:30 
p.m.. The show will be performed in the Stapleton Lounge in Le Mans Hall. General Admission is $8.50, $7.50 for senior citizens, $6.50 for Notre Dame and Saint Mary's community members and $5.50 for students.

Scene previews "A Night on Broadway" revue 

By CHRISTOPHER SCOTT 
Scene Theater Critic 
Every February, an article appears in this newspaper touting the unending talent and innovation of the Pasquerilla East Musical Company (PEMC). This year was no exception as the members of PEMC wowed sold­out crowds on three successive nights with their pro­duction of "Damn Yankees." 
Last year, Notre Dame students' appetites for musical theater was wetted on more than just the PEMC musi­cal by the Farley Hall Players production of "Chance at Love." The musical, which poked fun at musical theater itself, was the product of a capricious Lafortune con­versation between seniors Ryan Cunningham and Tommy Curtin during their freshman year. 
"Chance at Love" was such a hit during its two-night debut in the LaFortune Ballroom that the cast, com­posed of members from PEMC. gave an encore perfor­mance in Washington Hall during study days and even took the show on a national tour this past summer. 
Now. the PEMC members are at it again, performing the PEMC Musical Revue this Thursday and Friday in the LaFortune Ballroom. Titled "A Night on Broadway," the Revue includes songs from popu­
the acts, Linnert and Griffin selected senior Tommy Curtin and sophomore Shawna Monson as music direc­tor and choreographer respectively. The group held auditions during late February and left the choices of songs solely up to the company members. Linnert and Griffin felt that not only should the company members be in the spotlight, but also they should perform what they wanted to perform. And the interested parties responded 
amazingly. 'The great thing about the never been part of PEMC. The "After we saw the first audi­Revue is that everyone is a lead Revue features the vocal talents

in London last semester lead to the concept of a musical revue. 
Linnert and Griffin's main concern for the Revue was that there be an opportunity for normally unassuming chorus members to stand out. As Linnert stated, "The great thing about the Revue is that everyone is a lead and a company member. Each person has an opportu­nity to stand in the spotlight." In fact only 3 of the 25 company members have previously held leads in any PEMC production.

members to shine. Sjostrom also appears with eight other freshman from PEMC in the feel-good, Act I closer "Happiness" from "You're a Good Man Charlie Brown." This song takes the audience back to elementary school days and reminisces of the joys and simple pleasure of life at that age. 
Opposing simple childhood memories is the song "Bring on the Men" from Jekyll & Hyde, performed by freshman Beth Duran. Junior Kristin Kajdzik and sophomores Lindsey Horvath, Claire McAuliffe and April Trimble support her in both vocals and dance. 
This sexy number addresses Duran's character's lust for men and how she cannot get enough of them. "Bring on the Men" should easily impress audience members with its display of vocal and dance talent. 
Duran is unique in that she was not part of the PEMC musical this year. Sophomore Mike Romano also deserves this distinction as he performs "They Can't Take That Away From Me" from Crazy For You and yet has also 
she then appears in "Take Me or 
Leave Me" from Rent opposite junior Mary Beth Asmussen as a brazen young diva proclaiming how lucky her female partner is to date her. Only a few songs later she returns, attempting to convince the man she loves (played by senior Christopher Scott) to "Forget regret / Or life is yours to miss" in "Another Day," also from Rent. Finally she per­forms as a woman hoping that this time she will have found the right man in "Maybe This Time" from the musical Cabaret. 
"A Night on Broadway" breaches the realms of hilari­ty as well. Sophomore Katie Welch and freshman Theresa Sherman perform "Stepsister's Lament" from Cinderella demonstrating the sisters constant attempt to put Cinderella down while competing with each other in everything. The song "Big Ass Rock" from the Full Monty depicts the wide-reaching capacities of friend­ship. Scott and freshman Brian Grundy play two friends who encounter a former co-worker (freshman KC Kenney) attempting suicide and befriend him in his time of need. 
Piecing together this production from nothing has been a grueling process for the director duo, their musical director and choreographer. However they all believe that "A Night on Broadway" will be a spectacu­lar show for the company members performing in it and the 500 audience members who have the opportu­nity to experience the first annual Revue this week.

MEN'S GOLF 
Irish struggle at El Diablo 
+ Ratay's 4th-place finish impressive in tough field 
By KEVIN BERCHOU 
Sports W ricer 
For senior star Steve Ratay, it was a weekend to remember. The rest of his teammates, however. would just as soon forget the lackluster play that saw them finish a collective 17th out of 20 teams at the El Diablo Invitational held at the par-72 country club for which the event is named. 
Hatay posted rounds of 73­68-76 en route to a fourth place finish. Able to harness the erratic driving that had plagued him in the past, Ratay kept the ball in play off the tee and thus gave himself many chances to score on the tight El Diablo track. 
"I was pretty pleased," Ratay said. "Keeping the ball in play was key. It's something that has been a problem in the past and on a course like this it was a must." 
First-year head coach John Jasinski was proud of his top player. 
"Steve's been solid all year," Jasinski said. "He's had a chance to win a couple of times and his mechanics have been solid. Notoriously, he's been a hit of a slow starter so for him to be playing this well early is a major plus." 
Unfortunately for the Irish, Ratay was the only golfer who seemed at ease in the difficult conditions. A 54 hole total of 918 put them a whopping 25 While the team's perfor­strokes behind William and mance this past weekend was Mary, the champions of the poor at best, Ratay said that event. much can be learned and lifted

players capable of going low. It seems that for Notre Dame, though, the bad days are far worse than those endured by other schools. When a player at the collegiate level is off his game, a score in the mid to high seventies can be expected. Too often in the recent past, struggling Notre Dame players have posted scores in the low 80s, numbers that at this level are unaccept­able. 
"Our bad days can't be as bad," said Ratay. "We have to find a level of consistency to really compete with some of these teams." 
His coach agreed. 
'There's a window of scoring that's acceptable," Jasinski added. "We overreacted to the conditions and that cost us." 
accompanies a first place finish in the event. 
"It's what our season builds toward," Ratay said. "It's defi­nitely the one that matters." 
Jasinski is confident that the team will respond well to the challenges ahead. 
"We're talented enough to make a run at it," he said. "We just need to get some of our confidence back and get every­one scoring again." 
The first opportunity to turn those bogeys into birdies and higher finishes comes this weekend when the Irish return 
to  action  in  the  Pepsi

Memos from a bar napkin 
A lot of people view spring break as a hiatus from reali­ty. What happens on the beach should stay on the beach. 
In such a state, finding a pad, pen and a way to watch a mile­stone game for the Notre Dame men's bas­ketball program can get a little tricky. 
So on Saturday afternoon, with the Irish lead­ing Duke 10-8 with 
15:59 to go in the first half of their second round NCAA Tournament game, I fittingly entered an Irish pub called Finnegan's Way to watch the game. 
I grabbed a drink napkin from the bar, borrowed a pen from the bartender and prepared myself to take some copious notes. 
Now this Finnegan's, pre­sumably not related to the late South Bend venue, sits on Ocean Drive in Miami. You know, Will Smith, $100,000 cars, everybody's got 'em, the whole deal. Not your typical Lafortune game watch experience. 
And never mind that the Finnegan's Way sound sys­tem spins only the latest tracks from today's hottest groups, like Genesis and the guys who sing "Take These Broken Wings." 
The real attention-grabber was Notre Dame, looking from the start like it wasn't content as Duke's 15.5 point underdog. With that, a bizarre way of watching the ballgame faded into some building St. Patty's Eve magic. 
My only record of this almost surreal experience, which ultimately ended with an 84-77 Notre Dame loss, is the now crumpled-up nap­kin, roughly tracking the progress of the contest over 35 minutes and 59 seconds of game time. 
That napkin tells a crude story about the greatest Notre Dame men's basket­ball game in recent memory. 
Somewhere on the front side. at around four minutes to go in the first half, the Irish got down 38-30 on two Chris Duhon free throws. 
A coup!~ crinkles and folds later, inside of the two­minute mark. it says Matt Carroll pulled up for a three in transition, hit it, and Notre Dame had suddenly bounced hack within two, 39-37. 
Mike Dunleavy Jr., who has more flops to his credit than Steven Seagall. made four free throws in a row somewhere near the bottom of side one, and then hit a 3-pointer to start the second half. 
While the despaired writer of these notes didn't actually jot down that triple, the next five inches of corrugated paper do document the most amazing part of last Saturday: Notre Dame didn't ever go away. 


They went shot-for-shot ­luckily not in a Notre Dame dorm -with the best team 
in the country, which 
included a 14-0 run after 
that Dunleavy basket. 
True, the Irish laid their 
fair share of bricks for the 
next few minutes after their 
run, allowing the Dukies to 
surge back to the lead with 
under twelve to go. 
But since when can a 
Notre Dame basketball team 
dabble in masonry and still 
play a team from Tobacco 
Road straight up, (flip to 
inside of napkin) let alone 
have a seven-point lead 
with under seven minutes to 
go? 

Apparently, since now. 
The Napkin Chronicles end with about one minute to go in the game, the Irish trail­ing 77 -7 5 and the song "The Heat is On" said to be filling the bar, refusing to let the 80s just die in peace. 
In a sense. though, maybe there couldn't have been a better tune for the end of that game. Sure, Duke won. But they were sweating, something they usually don't have to do, especially not in March. 
Tending that boiler room were the Irish. Unfortunately for them, the fire got a little out of their control down the stretch. 
But their day is coming. Making the NCAA Tournament? Been there, done that, two years in a row now. Now we've seen there are bigger fish to fry than the Xaviers and Charlottes of the world. 
Chris Thomas will be as good as Jason Williams. Ryan Humphrey made Carlos Boozer look like he was standing still, except, of course, when he went out of his way to hump Humphrey coming off the court in the first half. 
That's what you do when you're battling for your post­season life, not cakewalking to the Sweet 16. Someone showed Notre Dame where the big dogs play, and the Irish just called "next". 
Somewhere in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, North Carolina head coach Matt Doherty had to be pulling for his former players to pull off the unthinkable against his in-state rival. 
Meanwhile, he's busy try ing to reload his Tar Heels to compete with that team from Durham once again. 
However, Mike Brey's Irish would probably take the Blue Devils on over at Stepan right now. 
For the first time in a long time. that isn't a terrifying proposition for Irish fans. 
As long as there isn't any more Phil Collins.

net by way of two quick passes 
from Natalie Loftus and 
Eleanor Weille. The goal nar­
rowed the Irish deficit to 8-5. 
Cornell answered again with a free position goal to increase their lead back to four. 
The Irish continued to pres­sure offensively and were sparked by Kassen Delano's return to the field. Delano had taken a stick to the head on a defensive play and was forced to the bench to deal with the cut on her forehead. The sophomore would not be slowed, how­ever, and set net until Lauren Fischer con­verted her second goal with 15 seconds to play. Captain Kathryn Lam forced a turnover to give the Irish one last chance but her pass was knocked out of Kate Marotta's stick as time expired.

Notre Dame lined up against a much larger and higher­ranked Big Red team. One of the more exciting matchups of the day was between Fcdarcyk and Cornell's senior All­American, Jamiee Reynolds, who was four inches taller than Fedarcyk, Notre Dame's tallest defender. 
Reynolds was the target of every single draw, and would constantly switch from the offensive to the defensive end. But Fedarcyk refused to give their star player any open looks and hustled con­
another goal off a full-field charge from senior Maureen Henwood. Delano, despite the injury, led the Irish in points. Her goal cut the Cornell lead to 9-8. 
The Irish continued to push offensively, but could not con­nect for the tying goal. Jamiee Reynolds gave Cornell a bit more room with a goal with seven minutes to play in the game. 
The game then turned extremely scrappy as both teams were playing with great intensity. 
"We had them scared," said Fedarcyk. The Irish could not find the 
tough loss, 

the Irish plan to focus on the positive aspects that came from a solid second half where they both outplayed and outscored Cornell 6-2. 
"We are going to focus on the good things that happened today," said Fedarcyk. "We learned a lot about ourselves." 
The Irish will be looking for­ward to using their new knowledge when they play Delaware next Tuesday in the third game of a five-game homestand.

Belles hang with competition 
By KATIEMcVOY 
Associace Sporrs Editor 
Last-minute travel changes didn't stop the Belles from serv­ing up a few victories in the last week. Despite the fa.ct that their first trip was cancelled when the resort closed, the Saint Mary's tennis team had a strong start in sunny Daytona, Fla., before dropping three matches. 
"We had several days where we played two matches in one day so that by the end of the trip the team was exhausted and some injuries had caught up with us," said head coach Dee Stevenson. "Otherwise, I feel that we would have won the match against Saint Cloud State. The competition was very good and better than any other spring trip since I have been here." 
The Belles dropped matches to Division I Creighton and Division II North Dakota and Saint Cloud State. But with seven matches under their belts, the defending MIAA champion Belles are ready to start the regular season. 
"The team is ready for the season to begin," said sopho­more Kris Spriggle. "After such an aggressive spring trip, we all are ready to begin the sea­son and move towards another conference title." 
Saint Mary's took home four wins against Springfield College. Haverford College, Hillsborough Community College and Pasco Ilernandao Community College. 
"The competition was more fitting this year," junior Elisa Ryan said. "We played Division III teams with nationally ranked players, as well as solid Division I and Division II teams." 
The Belles, who finished with a 4-3 record during their spring break trip, finished off the trip with a heart-breaking loss to Saint Cloud State. 4-5, coming close on the heels of a 4-5 loss to North Dakota. 
Following the singles match­es, Saint Mary's was tied at three apiece with North Dakota. But a close loss in No. 3 doubles (8-6) and a loss in No. 2 doubles left North Dakota with the 5-4 victory. 
Sophomore Jeannie Knish, sophomore Kaitlin Cutler and Ryan took home wins in No. 2 singles, No. 3 singles and No. 5 singles respectively. Knish teamed up with her older sister Annie to take home the win in No. 1 doubles. 
Before falling 9-0 to Division I Creighton, the Belles had solid victories against Haverford College (6-3) and Springfield College (9-0). 
The Belles followed up their 9-0 shut-out of Springfield with 
a  6-3  victory  against  
Hills borough.  
In  the  match  against  

Hillsborough, Cutler, Spriggle, Ryan and Angela Sandner took home wins in singles while the doubles teams of Ryan and Cutler and Sandncr and Spriggle took home wins in doubles. 
Today, the Belles will face off against Tri-State College in their home opener. Tri-State, which will be joining the MIAA in the near future, should allow Saint Mary's to get some hitting prac­tice before they head into the tough part ofthe MIAA schedule. Last season. Tri-State barely slipped past Saint Mary's JV squad, so Stevenson plans on playing some of his younger players. 
"Tri-State will be joining our conference in a couple of years but at the moment would not be in the upper echelon of the con­ference in tennis," Stevenson said. "I hope to allow a lot of players to play in this match. We will use this as a practice match in preparation for the confer­ence season which begins on Saturday at Albion." 
With another MIAA champi­onship looming in the minds of the returning players, the Belles are looking forward to getting back into regular season play. 
"The team is strong this year and is aiming to defend their undefeated season and confer­ence championship title," Ryan said. 
The match will get under way at Saint Mary's at 3 p.m.

Ruth Riley selected to Senior Nationals 
Special to The Observer 
Former Notre Dame All­America center and 2001 Naismith Player of the Year Ruth Riley has been chosen to participate in the 2002 USA Basketball Senior Women's National Team spring training camps, which will be held from March 19 to April 10 in four cities across the country. 
Riley, who currently plays for the Miami Sol in the WNBA, will be competing for one of seven roster spots on the 2002 USA World Championship Team. The 14th FIBA World Championship for Women will feature teams from 16 nations competing in nine cities in the People's Republic of China from Sept. 14 to 25. 
Hiley completed her Notre Dame career last April as one of the most decorated players in school history. In addition to earning consensus national player of the year honors last year, she was a three-time All-America selection and was named the Most Outstanding Player at the 2001 NCAA Final Four, sparking the Irish to their first national champi­onship. 
She also was the 2001 Big East Player of the Year, a three-time Big East Defensive Player of the Year and a three-time all-Big East selec­tion. She is the only player in school history to log both 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds. placing third on the Irish all-time scoring chart with 2,072 points and tops on the Notre Dame career rebounding ledger with 1,007 caroms. 

As the No. 5 overall pick in the 2001 WNBA Draft, Riley averaged 6.3 points and 4.1 rebounds per game for the Sol, and ranked ninth in the league with 1.44 blocks per game. In addition, Miami was 15-5 with the Macy, Ind., native in the starting lineup, qualifying for the playoffs in just its second year of exis­tence. 
If she is selected for the '02 World Championship squad, Riley would join her third USA Basketball unit. In 1998, she averaged 10.3 ppg. and a team-high 7.6 rpg. as a mem­ber of the USA Select Team that posted a 7-1 record against national teams from Puerto Rico, Poland and Spain. The following summer, she helped the United States collect a silver medal at the 1999 World University Games, notching 10.3 ppg. and 5.2 rpg.

MEN'S TENNIS 
Illinois knocks off No. 4 Notre Dame in finals 
By JOE LINDSLEY 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's tennis team learned two important lessons at the Blue-Gray National Tennis Classic held in Montgomery, Ala. over spring break. 
First, it is important to watch out for dehydration, even in winter, in the South. Second, going from underdog to favorite status is not always advanta­geous. 
Fourth-ranked Notre Dame fell to eighth-ranked Illinois 4-2 in the finals of the Blue-Gray Invitational after defeating lower seeds Tulsa, Alabama­Birmingham and Harvard to advance to the championship round. 
In past years, the Irish have been perceived as an underdog coming into this nationally esteemed tournament, but after last year's victory and this sea­son's high ranking and a 15-3 record, Notre Dame was clearly the team to beat in Montgomery. 
"We expect­ed a very and played maybe the best match we have played during my four years here." 
The Irish started off the final round against Illinois with Taborga and senior Casey Smith's doubles loss to Amer Delic and Michael Calkins, 7-6, 6-1. Taborga and Smith had defeated the same duo during the match at Illinois. 
According to Taborga, losing the doubles point was the turn­ing point of the match because it gave Illinois more confidence to add to their already-present desire for revenge. 
"(That is] one of the biggest things we have to work on, try­ing to come out strong after los­ing the doubles point because we cannot win the doubles point every single time," he said. 
Taborga and Scott achieved the only Irish singles victories on Sunday. Scott. who moved up to the No. 4 position after Talarico was taken out, defeat­ed Michael Costa 6-4, 7-5. 
"Beating Costa was a good win," said Scott. "He's their fire­
power,  their  leader  who  
screams  and  
shouts  and

Irish senior

player Amer Delic of Illinois, by scores of 1-6, 6-4 and 7-5. After finishing 4-0 in singles over the weekend. he was named the tournament's most valuable player. 
"We're ranked very high in the nation and I think a lot of teams wanted to get the chance to play against top ten teams," Taborga said. "In th·e past we were the underdogs, and this year it's the opposite. A lot of teams are looking to beat us whenever they get the chance. Blue-Gray was a great chance for us. It was really hard for us. Although [Illinois] were ranked lower than we were, we had to play really, really well to beat them." 
Notre Dame's toughest match before Sunday's loss was a close bout with Harvard, ranked No. 40 nationally. The Irish narrow­ly won 4-3 and it was evident th_at the Crimson were looking for an upset. 
"We knew that there were a lot of dangerous teams that were underrated, but I don't think we expected as tough as a match as we had against Harvard," said sophomore Matt Scott. 
Although the Irish had upset the Illini two weeks ago at Illinois, they were not expecting it to be easy to defeat them again to earn the Blue-Gray title for the second year in a row. Additionally, Notre Dame was without its No. 3 singles player Aaron Talarico, who had to be hospitalized Saturday after suf­fering severe dehydration. 
"We knew that we would have to play at a very high level [to beat Illinois]." Taborga said. "They were really disappointed with their performance. We came out strong [11 days agoJ 
making the 

transition from indoor to outdoor player. Talarico's sickness may have been a result of that, especially with the very hot conditions in Alabama. 
"Going from indoors to out­doors is one of the more difficult things to do in tennis," Scott said. "Going [against Illinois] without Aaron, we knew that we were a bit hurt in the line-up." 
"Going outdoors was a big change," Taborga said. "We had to try to save as much energy as we can." 
Taborga thought Talarico's dehydration was surprising though. 
"He's in better shape than the rest of the team," Taborga said. 
Despite Notre Dame's current ranking, the Irish are not com­placent. 
"I think [the tournament] was a big eye-opener," said Taborga. "We came into it thinking that we were a top 10 team and that we had earned it. We were wrong. We still have to earn our position, and we have to work even harder to stay up there. Other teams are coming after us. It's going to be very hard these last months of the season before the tournament starts." 
Yet the Irish feel lhat they are where they need to be at this early point of the outdoor sea son as they progress towards their goal of a national champi­onship. 
"Overall, we reached the finals. won three matches, and got some experience playing outdoors," Scott said. 
Notre Dame will next compete against the Hoosiers at Indiana on March 23.

in coming from behind to beat Southern Cal and I just thought they showed unbelievable char­acter and determination in that game," said Mainieri. 
Unfortunately for Notre Dame. they could not keep their momentum against Texas Pan-_ American. In that game, the Irish left the bases loaded in the ninth inning, en route to losing to Texas Pan-American 6-5. In the final game of the tournament the Irish suffered another close loss, this time to the hands of Creighton 8-6. 
"Already after a few days, it was a stressful weekend." said Mainieri. "I thought against Creighton we really felt the effects of the emotional draining of the first three days," said Maiuieri. 
Heading into the second leg of their spring break stint in San Antonio at the Irish Baseball Classic, Notre Dame was deter­mined to improve on their 5-6 record. 
In the first game, they avenged their earlier loss to Creighton by beating the Blucjays 6-2. After missing the previous nine gam_es due to a shoulder injury, pre­season All-American junior Brian Stavisky hit a home run on the first pitch he saw. He also added a triple later in the game. Freshman John Axford went seven strong innings, giving up no earned runs, striking out six and allowing zero walks. 
"[Axford] topped out at 94 mph and just had a really p_owerful performance," said Mainieri. 
The Irish came back strong against Southern Illinois in their next game and snapped the Salukis eight game winning streak by nabbing a 6-3 victory. Freshman Grant Johnson went eight innings, yielding only five hits and no earned runs. Johnson's classmate, Macri, hit his first collegiate home run and added a triple to lead the effort for the Irish offense. 
Despite their tendency to lose close games earlier in the sea­son, the Irish defeated Arkansas Little-Rock 7-5 when sophomore Joe Thaman blasted a two-run home run to end the game. Stavisky also connected for his second and third home runs of the season as the Irish improved to 8-6. Freshman pitcher Chris Niesel contributed another solid outing on the mound going seven innings and allowing only one earned run. 
"That was a wild game but it was a good win to give us three in a row," said Mainieri. 
In the finale of the spring break trip, Notre Dame used a late-run rally to upend Southern Illinois for the second time this season. Stanley tied the game with a triple in the eighth before scoring on a Paul O'Toole single. Pete Ogilvie pitched the final three innings for his second win of the year. 
In Mainieri's many years of coaching, he has never seen a team face so many early season obstacles. 
"Clearly, right now we have battled as much adversity in an early part of a season as you could face in an entire year. We have lost our top three middle infielders in Macri, [Steve] Sollman and Matt Edwards. I'm not sure how many teams in the country can lose their top three middle infielders and still battle the way we are."

WOMEN'S LACROSSE 

Edged by the Big Red 
. Irish second half rally not enough in 10-9 loss to No. 10 Cornell 
By CHRIS COLEMAN 
Sports Writer 

... 
The No. 15 Irish women's lacrosse team·s comeback fell just short as time ran out on Meyn Field Tuesday, losing to Cornell 10-9. 
Cornell started strong and quickly accumulated a 5-1 lead. 
"We didn't come out strong enough," senior Tina Fcdarcyk said. "We weren't playing our game in the beginning."
