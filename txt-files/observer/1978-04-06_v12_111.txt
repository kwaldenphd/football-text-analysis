Senate sets Apri/18 for last Panama Canal treaty vote 
WASHINGTON [AP]  The Senate set a date for its final showdown vote on the Panama Canal treaty yesterday, while deal­ing treaty foes an unexpectedly sharp defeat on a move to give the House an equal voice in the issue. 
Leaders of the pro and anti-treaty factions agreed to put the second of the two pacts to a vote on April 18. That means the Senate will have only nine working days to consider amendments and reserva­tions before taking a final vote on the issue. 
Previously the Senate had set a deadline of April 26 for the ratification test. But with the 
debate already two months old, Senate leaders and anti-treaty stra­tegists acknowledged a need to bring the issut.-to a conclusion. 
On a surprisingly wide margin of 58 to 37, the Senate killed an amendment by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, that would have allowed

Controversy dominates Gryp's year as director 
by Jack Pizzolato Senior Staff Reporter 

After a month of preparation, sophomore Bill Roche quietly assumed the directorship of the Student Union (SU) last Saturday. Roche, a member of the Union since his freshman year. had worked in various SU commissions and was serving as assistant ser­vices commissioner when he appli­ed for the director's position. He was nominated for Student Union director on Feb. 20 by the organiza­tion's own five-member Steering Committee. Six days later, at a Sunday night meeting of the Stu­dent Government's Board of Com­missioners, Roche's nomination was quickly approved. In the month between his appointment and assuming office last week, Roche has had an opportunity to closely observe the Student Union at work and to carefully select his new staff. In all, it was as smooth a transition as the drafters of the Student Government's new consti­tution could have hoped for. 
"Bill will do an excellent job," former SU Director Tom Gryp commented, adding "No one should have to go through what I went through to get in." Of all those who could admire the ease with which Roche became Student Union director, none could appreci­ate it more than GrypA year ago he was the center of one of the biggest mix-ups in recent Student Union history. 
Stormy debate 

On March 30. 1977, the Student Union Appointment Board met to select a new director. The Board then consisted of four members of the Student Union, outgoing and incoming members of the Student Government, a Hall President's Council representative and the director of Student Activities. At the time, representatives of the Student Union and Student Government leaders were locked in a stormy debate centering around the Union's independence. 
On the fifth ballot, after long hours of debate, Gryp was appoint­ed SU director. He had been North Quad campaign manager for the incoming student body president, Dave Bender, and had served ont the Keenan Hall Judicial Board. But Gryp had no previous experi­ence with the Student Union. 
Tempers flared, and the next day, when the votes were retabu­lated, it was discovered that there had been a miscount and that Gryp had not carried a two-thirds major­ity. On April 3, Bender called together the members of the Appointment Board to clarify the vote. Yet on a second vote Gryp was defeated. When outgoing Student Body President and Board chairman Mike Gassman disquali­fied the second vote, there was an uproar. 
Members of the Student Union accused the student government of "political maneuvering." In an Observer opinion column, one offi­cer of the Student Union equated Bender with a political party boss· who doled out patronage to those who aided him in his campaign. 
On April 6, the Student Govern­ment's Board of Commissioners passed Gryp's nomination. The 

SU plans summer storage 
by Andy Segovia 

Student Union Director Bill 
Roche Tuesday night announced 
plans for a new summer storage 
program. Under the new plan the 
hall presidnets will be responsible 
for summer storage in their res­
pective dorms. 
Last year the Student Union used 
privately owned storage space be­
cause major firms no longer desir­
ed to undertake the project. ''The 
larger firms shy away because of 
law 'suits, lack of facilities and 
minimal profits," Roche stated. 
"Last year's operation proved in­
effective. There was a substantial 
amount of damages and losses." 
The new program calls for the 
hall presidents to estimate the 
volume of storage from their hall. 
This information would be used to 
reserve space in a self-lock storage 
establishment. Hall presidents

would then draw up a price list based on the cost of the space and the size of the various articles. 
''The plan allows for the dorms to make some profit form the operation,'' Roche commented. 
The suggested date for moving the articles to the storage area is the Saturday before finals. The stored articles are to be picked up and returned to campus in the fall. 
''The preferable date for the return is the day before registration day" Roche said. Volunteers will . be recruited from the dorms to aid in the loading and unloading of the materials. 
"Under this system many of the problems of last year's program will be alleviated", Roche continu­ed. "The new plan will cut cost and eliminate many of the damage problems since the students will be actively involved in the process." 
Roche stressed that it is impor­tant for the hall presidents to begin making arrangements for the program. "It is urgent that they start now since the semester is rapidly coming to an end." 
Students interested in utilizing the new storage program should contact their hall president in the near future.

same day, an Observer editorial noted that ''the controversy has stirred up suspicion and ill-will on , both sides. They did not disappear with the Board's vote and won't until Tom Gryp and the Student Union find they can work toge­ther... Tom Gryp is going to have to prove that he can do the job." The big question for most students was 
still "Who is Tom Gryp?" 
Surprisingly, though, the Stu­

dent Union under Gryp proved to 
be a very unified and cohesive 
group. There were controversies, 
but they were mostly external and 
directed at the Union as a whole. · 
On April 28, after appointing a 

new movie commissioner, Gryp 
hinted that he would eliminate the, 
Cinema 78 film series, a group 
which, under past Student Unions, ' 
had promoted and exhibited note­
worthy cultural films. The announcement drew strong criti­cism and, though the Cinema film series was eventually abandoned. Gryp negotiated an informal agree­ment about cultural films in Sep­tember with the then newly estab­lished Notre Dame Film Society. The difficulties over ftlm selection have continued throughout the year, despite the appointment of an assistant movie commissioner for cultural films. Members of the ND Film Society, as late as last March, attacked the Student Union's film 
policies. 
A second major controversy involving the Student Union exploded in late September of last year. Gryp reserved 32 USC football tickets for his staff out of a total of 500 which were scheduled

Sadat calls for more flexibility in negotiations 
CAIRO* Egypt [AP] . Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin "should be more flexible" in peace negotiations, President Anwar Sadat said yesterday. He added that Defense Minister Ezer Weiz­man. seen as Begin's growing political rival, is welcome to return to Cairo ''whenever there are new ideas.'' 
The Egyptian leader spoke to an international group of jounalists and academics here for a confer­ence on news exchanges with the Third World. 
He was asked whether Begin personally was regarded as respon­sible for the current deadlock in the Israeli-Egyptian peace process. 
··well. I don't want to interfere in others' domestic problems," Sadat replied. "What I feel is this · Mr. Begin should be more flexible, and I told this to Weizman when he visited me last time. I don't feel like making any comment other than this." 
Israelis protest 

The Egyptian president also said, as he had Sunday, that the estimated 30,000 Israelis who dem­onstrated in Tel Aviv over the weekend for Begin to make more concessions to the Arabs were "wise." 
Formal talks between the two nations were suspended more than two months ago, although Weiz­man visited Egypt last week and met twice with Sadat. The defense minister is expected to return next week. 
Israeli spokesmen said Weizman brought new proposals last week, but the Egyptians said there had been no progress. 
The stalemate centers on Egypt's insistence that Israel with­draw from all occupied Arab land and allow the Palestinians to determine their own future. Israel rejects the idea of total withdrawal and Begin has offered home rule 
with a continued Israeli military presence for the Palestinians of the Gaza Strip and West Bank of the 
Jordan River. 
Also yesterday, Foreign Minins­ter Moshe Dayan returned to Israel from a three-day visit to Romania and Mideast talks with President Nicolae Ceausescu which Dayan said yielded no concrete results. 


Other developments 
In other Middle East develop­ments: -A symbolic force of 30 Lebanese national police entered the port city 

of Tyre, a Palestinian enclave in Israeli-occupied s_outh Lebanon, and joined French paratroopers of the United Nations peace-keeping force in patrolling coastal areas. It was the first regular Lebanese force to enter Tyre in three years
and its deployment, officials in Beirut said, was an attempt to start restoring state control of the war 
torn region. 
-In Jerusalem, Lt. Gen. Morde­chai Gur met privately with a parliamentary committee to report on plans for evacuating the 500­square-mile sector of Lebanon in­vaded by Israeli forces beginning March 15. The cease-fire Israel declared March 21 was reported holding, with a single morning incident of firing between Israeli and Palestinian guerrilla positions. But independent observers said little sign was visible 'of the thinning-out of occupation forces Israel claimed it began more than a week ago.

"I've heard a lot about this agreement, but candidates don't have the right to do that. People have a right to cast their votes," Reid said.

Carter drafting ~get-tough' approach to handle inflation 

WASHINGTON [AP] -President Carter. beset by a falling dollar. rising prices and large oil imports, is drafting what is described as a new, get-tough approach to con­trolling inflation. 
He told congressional leaders at a breakfast meeting yesterday that he will take a larger personal role in lobbying for his energy bill. which he said is crucial to controlling oil imports and inflation, according to some who attended the meeting. 
And he expressed what was described as "hostility" to the multi-billion-dollar farm subsidy bill being considered by Congress, which he considers inflationary. White House spokesman Jody Powell said Carter considers the bill"unacceptable." 
Powell said inflation control pro­posals have been "the major focus of activity" in the White House since the president returned from a four-nation trip to South America and Africa on Monday night. 
He said Carter will deliver a speech sometime next week about "inflation, the dollar and energy." 
Powell said the president prob­ably has not yet decided on all details of his anti-inflation pro­gram. One of the things under consideration is a proposal to hold down the size of this year's annual federal pay increase. 
House Democratic leader James Wright said after the breakfast meeting that the president's pro­gram, will include tougher anti­inflation measures than any taken by the administration so far. 
Wright described Carter as ex­tremely concerned about the infla­tion rate, officially projected to be from 6 percent to 6.5 percent this year, but which some administra­tion officials privately concede could turn out closer to 7 percent. 
''The president believes, and I

think most of us believe, that our failure to achieve a solution to the energy problem is the one thing that more than anything else is causing a drop in the value of the dollar and thus impacting the American people with inflation,'' Wright said. 
According to this view, Ameri­cans are importing so much oil that dollars are flowing out of the country at a record rate: $4.5 billion in February alone. This has contributed to a sharp drop in the value of the dollar abroad-down 15 percent against Swiss and nearly 20 percent against the Japanese yen during the last year.

The University's proposed action pertaining to lofts and room con­struction has metwith some student opposition. 
Mike Gilroy, a sophomore from Dillon has been circulating a peti­tion that expresses the students' dissatisfaction. So far, 350 people have signed the petition. 
"I started the petition basically to see if anyone agreed with me," Gilroy said. "If I need more signatures I'll get them. Right now the rules are the issue." 
Gilroy claimed that the adminis­tration is inconsistent. "They've banned lofts, yet many of the

Edmund T. Price, official liaison between Saga Food Services and Notre Dame, will now expand his duties to include Director for Sum­mer Housing. He replaces Fr. Gregory Green, who became Assis­tant Vice-President for Student Affairs earlier this year. 
Price was director of food and housing at the University of Cali­fornia-Davis, and also directed food and housing for a private Memphis Company. 
Duties of the Summer Housing Director include hiring of housing workers and staff, proper account­ing, and the allocation of residen­tial space and assigning of all undergraduate halls. The office is 
also  responsible  for  issuing  a  
spring  calendar  and  a  housing  
summary.  

Price characterized his new du­ties as ''very interesting with lots of new challenges. I look forward to it."

mattresses that students sleep on are not fire safe," he remarked. "My dorm doesn't even have a functional fire alarm.'' 
Paneling, lofts, and extension cords are symptoms of overcrowd­ed conditions, Gilroy noted. "Stu­dents wouldn't use these things if there were fewer people,'' he said. "The administration is fighting off the symptoms rather than correct­ing the overcrowding." 
There are many alternatives that could be acted upon, Gilroy stated.

Washington _ Every city, county and state government is trying to think up new ways of raising tax dollars. All the obvious things have already been taxed such as income, cigarettes, gasoline, park­ing, liquor, everything you buy in a store etc., etc., and it's almost impossible to come up with some­thing new that doesn't already have a tax on it. 
I was therefore very impressed with a new revenue-raising idea proposed by Merriweather Sample, who found something to tax that nobody else had thought of. In America today, this is the equival­ent of discovering a new constell­at ion in the sky or a virus without a 
name or a noncarcinogenic spray that will kill fire ants. Sample revealed his plan at a secret meeting of the board of supervisors of Bleeding County. 
"Gentlemen, I think I have it. I propose we put a tax on jogging." There was a look of surprise from everyone in the room. 
"Jogging?" someone said. 
Sample continued, "There are thousands of joggers running all around our county right now and it 
isn't costing them one cent. 1 say they've been getting a free ride for too long." 
One nervous supervisor said, "But how can we tax men and women for just running around?" 
"It's simple. They're using county roads and sidewalks to jog. Do you realize the damage they're doing every time they clomp on the asphalt or the pavement?" Sample said. 
"I didn't know runners do dam­

Student Government sponsor this first event in a lighter social environment. Other activities in-elude the formation of the Council of Communication. The Council will serve to make Student Govern­mentmore attentive to the needs of the individual students. Mike and I will, in the weeks ahead personally appear at individual halls to ac­quaint ourselves with the problems specific to each hall. 
A student survey will be adminis­tered in the latter part of the month dealing with many of the issues before us. Two newsletters per month will be published to keep people posted on the progress ot the campaign. Finally, the findings of all activities and the goals of the new Student Government will be summed up in a presentation to the Hall Presidents' Council at the end of the month. 
The Campaign for Student Input is not seen as an activity to solve all problems for Student Government, or to insure its productivity in the year ahead. However, Mike and I feel it is important that our first step be aimed at bringing us closer to the students and at seeking their thoughts about Student Govern­ment. We encourage all students to contact us personally throughout the year if they feel Student Government is ignoring the needs of an individual or the community as a whole.

The Notre Dame Person 


Before the Deluge: McKenna/Roohan 

The office bore all of the characteristics of change. Filing cabinets occupied seats on the sofa; a tape recorder hid behind a bookshelf; papers,books, boxes and assor­ted other items lie haphazardly on the single desk. Andy McKenna, nattily dressed in a beige suit and wing-tipped shoes, reflected nothing of his chaotic surroundings. 
"I guess there are several reasons for the campaign," remarked McKenna, Notre Dame's recently elected student body president. ''The challenge of the job and all of its responsibilities was part of it," he continued, "plus the chance to use the many resources of the campus. I also saw a great opportunity for my own personal growth." 
The third of seven children, McKenna spent his formative years in Long Beach, Indiana, a small community tucked into the northwest corner of the Hoosier state. He now resides in Winnetka, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, where his father is president of the Schwartz Paper Company, a nation­wide industrial paper distributor, a mem­ber of the board of directors. 
McKenna an accountmg maJor with thoughts of going to law school, feels that even though "there is so much involved, more work than anyone realizes, there is a definite organizational challenge as presi­dent to model the resources available to get s'>mething done." 
"The office itself has many meanings," McKenna said. "The idea of the leadership role, the amount of attention, and the challenge to handle the attention. And it is a vehicle to make changes," he continued. ''Although in the next twelve months, you won't see any dramatic changes, we can get things started. In any educational institution, changes come a­bout slowly, and even more slowly at conservative institutions like Notre Dame.  
Although specific goals are hard to forecast, McKenna stated, "I want people to feet that our administration was respons­ible to student needs, both as a group and as individuals. I also want to make students aware of the social issues that are 
'happening and will be happening in the coming year." 
Specifically, McKenna feels there are certain priority areas for his administration to pursue. Included in these areas are a follow-through of the LaFortune Student Center renovation, scheduled to begin this summer; an examination, evaluation, and recommendation of fire regulations; im­provement of student-faculty relations; reviews of the pass/fail option and the am/pm examination policy; a course evaluation booklet; and a career develop­ment office. 
In contrast to the cluttered office and business-like appearance of McKenna, student body vice-president Mike Roohan relaxed in an orderly office by reclining his chair and resting his sneaker-clad feet on a relatively clear desk. 
"I want the student government to be 
recognized as a functioning body, " 
Roohan said, "and I want to change the 
students' attitudes about the offices. I 
want to make students aware of what is 
going on. If we can do that," he explained, 
"I think we'll get much more student 
participation, just because of the caliber of 
people here." 
Roohan is a pre-professional science 
major from Saratoga Springs, New York, a 
place known for its mineral baths and the 
oldest stakes horserace in the United 
States. He comes from a family of leaders. 
His father was a student body president 
and two of his brothers have been their 
college class presidents. 
Strong family political inclination wasn't 
the reason for the campaign, though; rather 


it was the chaJJenge of the. job. ·"I also 
have a great deal of respect for Andy and 
what Itt: did for the junior class," added 
Roohan. 

Besides his studies, Roohan was presid­
ent and treasurer of St. Ed's his junior and 
sophomore years, respectively and has 
played for the ND rugby club for the past 
three years, "because," Roohan said, "I 
enjoy the people and the sport itself." 
Roohan feels that as vice president, he will be the foreman of the McKenna administration, following through on ass­igned projects, working as executive coordinator with the cabinet, and dealing with the government commissioners. 
Roohan's main concern as vice-president is the. social life at Notre Dame. "Too much ofthe social life here revolves around liquor, and that's wrong," he commented. "We need to get more students involved and the only way to do that is with an influx of new ideas that are responsible to the student needs," Roohan added. 
' ~'lotre Dame is too much of a nice place to be from and not such a nice place to be," remarked Roohan. "A reason for going to college is to learn how to associate with people," he continued, "and it doesn't happen enough here. That's what I really want to impmve." 
..................................................................................... 
The Turning Point 
Arthur Laurent's The Turning Point is an incredibi:Y beautiful, sensitive film.  It is about the choice every woman must make that of giving 190 percent to a career or live the domestic role. It is-the story of two friends (Anne Bancroft and Shirley Mac­Laine), who, after a twenty year separa­tion, meet to answer the question, "Who is better off {or the role they've chosen?" The answer that the ftlm gives should be of interest to everyone -male and female ­because it is an insight into not just the unique situation of women, but the whole human experience. The answer that the film gives is "Neither". Nor are the women any worse for their choice. This message comes through in the form of a pleasant story line and a marvelous lj.isplay of acting by Bancroft and-MacLaine that earned it 11 Academy Award nominations. On the surface, The Turning Point is about a confrontation between two friends ­one who quit the ballet to get married and one who went on to become the star of the 
Two Ladies and A Choice 
show -20 years after the decision. Laurent, who both wrote and co-produced the movie, uses The American Ballet Company and Michel Baryshnikov as the backdrop. What results are several magnificent scenes, aided by exceptional cinematic work, that heighten one's sense of the ballet's grace and splendor: That is how the movie is beautiful. It is sensitive when it explores the emotions of its ·two female leads and examines the bond of friendship that allows them, even after 20 years, to fight with each other, scream at each other, laugh and cry with each other and finally realize together that the roles they have chosen have their own separate benefits and limitations. Neither of their roles is perfectly satisfying because in «<.a~h , there are sacrifices to be made. Bancroft, as Emma, realizes that while she has the glamor associated with a Manhattan base and a starring role, she cannot have the children and security of her friend DeeDee. 
DeeDee, (played by MacLaine), on the 
? 



daue gill 

other hand, feels imprisoned by her Oklahoma City domesticity and is deeply troubled by her nagging self-doubt. CouJd she have become as big a star as Emma? What would life had been like then? 
Amelia, the daughter with whom DeeDee was pregnant at the time of her split with the company, is quite a ballet prodigy in her o\vn right. She is given an opportunity to perform with the ballet company in New York for the summer· and Dee Dee follows, both to look out for her daughter and to relive the ballet vicariously. This gives Director Herbert Ross the opportunity to intersperse strikingly beautiful ballet scenes with scenes depicting the conflict between the two old friends over Amelia's rising stardom. Emma is desperate in her need of a daughter figure, for her star is fading fast and she has no "next genera­tion" to rely on. Dee Dee is livid with jealousy and a feeling of being left out. All I will say about the scene in which all these pent up emotions are released and confron­ted is that is worth twice the price of admission. The electric energy created by these two legendary film giants is intense, and it is highlighted by adventurous camera work that is, for the most part, 
flawle~. 

In fact, the force that Bancroft and McLaine create is so powerful that it completely overshadows the minor annoy­ances in the film. For instance, in a sub-plot, Amelia (Leslie Brown -a fine actress) has an affair with the star of the ballet company (Uri, played by Michel Baryshnikov, who does a pretty spiffy job of acting ·himself). After spending the better part of an evening losing her virginity to the Russian, Amelia returns home to the apartment in which she and her mother share a bedroom, and casually reports the fait accompli, along with the fact that she has been taking the pill to be ready for just such an occasion. She handles her mother's incredulouslook with an admonishment: "C'mon mom, I don't want to talk about it now. It will ruin the glow." Would a born and bred Oklahoma City girl handle her new found sophistica­tion so quickly and effortlessly? Amelia deals with the sudden onslaught of love, fame and cosmopolitan life as gracefu~ as 

mark rust 
she pirouettes. Such a smooth adaptation 
seems somehow contrived. 
One tends to dismiss the slight contri­vance, though, because it helps to build Amelia into the kink of catalyst needed for the confrontation between her mother and Emma, a confrontation which forces Dee Dee to do two things. First, she is forced into an awareness that her dreaming of the life that might have been is self-destruct­ive; and second, she is forced into confronting Emma with her feelings of jealousy which she con't hold inside any longer. The ,ensuing fight between the two friends and the catharsis of emotion that occurs with it, clears the air so that the two can finally communicate. It is through this communication that the two under­stand how it feels to be in one anothers' shoes, and it becomes clear to both of them that no matter what one chooses at the turning point, that choice will be filled with equal amounts of misery and happiness. 
Jn a few reviews of this movie, some mention has been given to a suggested lesbian relationship between DeeDee and Emma. This suggestion is groundless and .>uperflous to Laurent's explanation of the spiritual wavelength on which th_ey both exist. The relevant perception of their relationship as sisters in a shared exper­ience is that it is one devoid of games, superficial banter, or any of a host of other plastic devices that plague two people reaquainting themselves after a long separation. These two human beings are . real, not in spite of their openness, but:-:..,: because of it. 
T. =,Turning Point is a very fine movie; it deserved an Oscar. The fact that it did not receive one (despite 11 ,nominations) tells one less about the movie than it does about the state of the Academy. The acting is superb, the technical effects are well-done, and the glimpse of the ballet is a delightful addition to a story that can stand on its own merit. It is playing at the Scottsdale, and if you see no other movie this year, this is one you shouldcatch.

etts and had been brought to California to talk to investigators, remained in federal custody Wed­nesday. Police spokesman Lt. Dan Cooke said the investigators would be talking to him again. 
Meanwhile, a 93-member police task force is at work -Gates had headed it before becoming chief recently -but Cooke pointed out that this case is not one that can be solved in short order. 
"We have so little in the way of physical evidence," he said. 
"The usual homicide is committed in someone's home by known members of the victim's family or friends." He said the victims had been strangled, meaning no mur­der weapon; left nude, with no clothing to be sent to the lab, and dumped at various locations, with no witnesses. 
"We have not figured out the common denominator," he added. The victims have ranged from prostitutes to school girls to the most recent victim last month. a teacher at a bible school. 
And the backfiring leads have done no good at all to the department's reputation. In add­
ition to Jones· arrest, release and the apology to him. they include: -In February. police arrested a television actor who confessed to 
the killlings. He was released after 
police explained that he apparently 
was under the influence of drugs 
and had nothing whatsoever to do 
with the case. 

-Three months ago, police called a news conference at which two composite drawings of suspects were to be released. But the conference was called off minutes before it was to start when two undercover detectives discovered the drawings depicted them. 
Cooke talks good-naturedly about that one: "We discovered the situation ourselves. After all. it does point up the efficiency of our artist that the men would be able to recognize themselves." 
Gryp's SU year controversial 
to go on sale to students as part of an entire homecoming package. At first Gryp stood firm by the' Student Union's "preferential" ticket pol­icy. but after receiving pressure from the Hall Presidents Council (HPC), he backed off, concluding that "the policy was wrong." Later, when the question of compli­mentary concert tickets for Student Union personnel was debated, the SU Board of Directors came out in favor of continuing the policy, over objections voiced by the HPC. 
Gryp has also had his difficulties with the Observer. He, along with Bender, have publicly accused the, newspaper of inadequate and inac­curate coverage during the year. "Things just weren't clicking." Gryp explained. ''The Observer made goofs just like I did, but my goofs were on the front page." 
"At first," Gryp remembered, "I got angry and then defensive. I wasn't used to press coverage and then, so much so soon." He concludes that there was a break­down in communications between the Observer and the Student Union during the year. adding "I thought I had to say something about it." 
Being ~ "outsider" helped 

Despite the problems of adjust­ment, looking back on the year since his controversial appointment as SU director, Gryp believes that being an "outsider" has helped him. "I had a unique perspective, coming in from the outside," he recalled. "and I could see the 
things  that  needed  to  be  chal­ 
lenged."  
"It  was  a  good  experience,"  

Gryp said, "but I don't know if I would do it again. When I got into the Union I liked politics, but now, " he commented, "I know it's not for me . I wasn't prepared for all the different points of view, all the sub-groups and cliques. I've had to force myself to broaden my hori­zons, and to expect the unfore­seen." 
"I'm happy with the Student Union movies. They're what people wanted to see and that's what I care about," Gryp observed. "With the USC thing, I screwed up, I walked into the blades, but with the complimentary tickets I did the best thing I could have done. The whole thing was undercover and there was corrup­tion before. Now people know about it and we have a written policy." 
Yet along with the controversial side of his directorship, Gryp has accomplished many of the goals he outlined for the Student Union at the beginning of the school year. In early October, the Student Government approved an operating budget for the Union just short of $60.000. It represented an increase of approximately IS percent above 
· last year's budget. Gryp. with Assistant SU Director Jodie Korth and SU Comptroller Colleen McGrath. advocated strict budgeting of Union funds. All Student Union commissions and even such events as the Sophomore Literary Festival were able to stay within their budgets this year and Gryp predicts that there will be a great "surplus" at the end of the semester. In other areas, the Student Union abandoned the idea of "block parties" and turned to sponsoring Happy Hours with great success. The Student Union introduced "mini-concerts" and one man per­formances. such as William Win­dom's appearance at Notre Dame this semseter. The Union also experimented with turntable clinics and plant sales, all of which. Gryp noted, received large support from the students. Another idea that Gryp was able 
to initiate was the co-sponsoring of speakers and activities by the Student Union in cooperation with the dorms on campus. Large events were scheduled with Howard and Planner, among others. 
The Calendar Office was estab­lished to coordinate the scheduling of campus events and to help avoid conflicts. The SU Ticket Office instituted a lottery system for ticket distribution so that students would not have to sleep out for tickets. 
Although Gryp' s original propo­sal to "revive" the LaFortune Student Center, by keeping it open two extra hours and by installing video entertainment equipment, was rejected by the student govern­ment. a copy machine was finally placed in the lounge. . 
"I tried to do my best,Gryp sa1d. "We had a good relationship with the Student Government, and where there was a wall before, it's totally gone now." 
"There are people who disagree with me and dislike me," he admitted, "but I want them to understand that I did everything for the Student Union and the student body. I had no ulterior motives," Gryp reiterated. "I screwed up a lot, but a lot of good things happened." 
"It's been a success this year, and I want to thank everyone in the Union." he concluded. "We set out to give the student body what they wanted. and to make the Union touch their lives. That's not easy to do in a year, but we started at least to turn it ~round.

Wolfe leads Irish with three-hitter 
by Greg Solman Associate Sports Editor 
Even under ideal conditionlt, 
pitchers seldom scoff at "three 
hitters." Early in the season, on 
cold days, against fairly good 
hitting teams, they never do. 
Hurler Don Wolfe, who held the 
Valporaiso Crusaders to three 
widely spaced hits yesterday in the 
Irish 4-1 win, was no exception 
"I feel very good about my 
performance today,'' commented 
Wolfe, "It's probably the best 
game I've pitched so far this year." 
Coach Tom Kelly agreed, and 
said the performance ranked with 
any ofthe pitching staff's this year. 
"He had his control, he showed good poise, and he moved his pitches around well," said Kelly of the southpaw, after seeing his team engineer a well-played victory to bring their record to 6-6, "and Valporaiso is not an easy team to pitch against by any means." 
But Wolfe had little problem, striking out six while surrendering but a solid single to Nils Boyer in the fifth inning, an infield hit to John Belskis in the eigth, and a ground ball single to center to John Simmons. 
The Valporaiso run came, ironi­cally, in the fourth with Wolfe still pitching a no-hitter. After Sim­mons had drawn a walk, he advanced to second on a wild pitch, then scored on two infield outs. One run, no hits--but it came an inning too late for the Crusaders. as the Irish had broken it open

(continued from p.l2) ' are a solid relief duo, though Hiller is getting on in years. The Tigers have a very young team, one that should be a contender in future seasons. They will rise this year as quickly as they mature. Milwaukee Brewers-Bud Selig has followed the example of the other free-spending owners by signing Sal Bando for last season and Larry Hisle for this year. Unfortunately, Selig has spent a lot of money on questionable players. Bando had a fine career for Oakland but.heis now34 and he had an off year last year. Hisle was a flop when he first came up with the Phillies and had his best year ever last year. He also has the bats 
o Lyman Bostock and Rod Carew in the same lineup in Minnesota to help him. Hisle will be 31 in May and he has a six year contract. Selig could have spent his money more wisely. 
The star of the Brewers is Robin Yount. Young is only 22 but he has played 4 years in the majors. He is looking to play out his option and go elsewhere. Selig should have spent some of his money on Yount. . 
This year the bats of Hisle, Bando and Yount along with those of <;e.ctl Cooper and Sixto Lezcano will have to carry the Brewers. Ben Oghvte, obtainedfrom the Tigers, should add some punch. 
The biggest question mark on the Brewers concerns their pitching. Bill 
Travers at the age of 25, is a staff veteran. Other hurlers being counted on 
are Jerry Augustine and Mosse Haas. In the bullpen Bill Castro and Ed 
Rodriguez are being counted on. All in all, it is a very young and untested 
staff. Manager George Bamberger claims that this will soom be a . 
solid pitching staff. While he may be right, they may not be ready thts 
year. 
aeveland Indians-The Indians position may be the toughest to predict. 
Gabe Paul has returned and his propensity for trading leads one to believe 
that the current Indian roster may be drastically changed by the June 15 
trading deadline. Paul has already traded Dennis Eckersley, a pitcher 
who was thought to be untouchable. The trading may just have begun. 
The offensive stars for the Indians are Buddy Bell, Andre Thornton and newly acquired Ted Cox. Cox was the MVP in the International League

Manning should also add some thing to the run totals after recovering from a series of injuries which hampered his play last season. 
The Indian defense is generally good. Manning and second baseman Duane Kuiper are thier two best fielders. Larvell Blanks has been penciled in at shortstop and that could create defensive problems. He is a good hitter but he has never been smooth with the glove. Thorton must also improve in the field. 
With Eckersley gone, Wayne Garland and Rick Waits are going to have to carry the load. Mike Paxton and Rick Wise should also fit in. Their top reliever is Jim Kern. He may have a lot of work this summer. 
It is hard to evaluate the Indians because they are changing and will continue to change, their personnel. Unless a major change takes place and the team jells quickly, however, the Tribe could be in for a long year. Toronto Blue Jays-The Blue Jays had a mildly successful first year and they should improve this year. Like the Tigers, they are very young, and their future is bright. However it is unlikely that they will escape the cellar this year. 
The two main cogs in the Jays' offense for this year and years to come are Bob Bailor and Roy Howell. Both Batted over .300 last year and they might even improve this year. yankee cast-off Otto Velez provided some timely hits last year. Ron Fairly, the ageless wonder of baseball is gone. 
Recently acquired John Mayberry could be a great addition for the Blue Jays. His offensive production had fallen off in his last two seasons with Kansas City, but he still is a good rbi man. Mayberry was acquired for the ever-present player to be named later. 
The Jays pitching is young and respectable. Dave Lemanczyk, Jerry Garvin, Jesse Jefferson, Tom Murphy and Tom Underwood provide the Jays with the nucleus of a good mound staff. The outfield of Bailor, Velez and Woods is good defensively. And, Alan Ashby and Rick Cerone are a good catching duo. the infield is error prone, but as the younger players gain experience they will improve. 
The Blue Jays are still an expansion team and they are going to have a 
season. However they should improve a little on last year's 54-107 
and he should be a star. Rick

Notre Dame's athletic success of 
la.te has spread to the golf team. 
L{lst year in the Purdue Invitation­
al, the Irish placed second to the 
University of Illinois. This year 
Notre Dame hopes to accomplish 
even more. It will not be an easy 
task as the Irish encounters a very 
challenging and extensive sched­
ule. The Irish will have to face the 
number two rated Ohio State 
Buckeyes in sis invitationals along 
with numerous other high!)' regar­
ded schools. In spite of the rough 
schedule Coach O'Sullivan feels that a realistic goal would be that of taking his team to the NCAA tournament. 
For this goal to become a reality the Irish will have to perform as a team. Although golf is an individ­~al sport, team spirit is very Important and' as long as we have the team spirit we will get the high finishes.' One has believe that the high finishes might be .achieved and thier goal of reaching the NCAA tournament will no longer be a dream. 
Notre Dame's next home meet Back to work for the 1977 National Champs. will be this Friday April 7th against  
The Yankees brought the baseball title back to the American League by 
defeating the Dodgers in last October's World Series. The Yankees have 
a fair shot to repeat as champions in 1978. The biggest obstacle in their 
path is right in their own division: the Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox 
improved their main weak spot, pitching, over the winter and their race 
with the Yankees is a toss-up. Both of these clubs are head and shoulders 
above the rest of the division. 

The Baltimore Orioles still have the best manager in baseball, Earl 
Weaver. but they have lost some of their top pitching. Detroit is young 
and will be in the race for a while but they need more experience. Gabe 
Paul has returned to Cleveland and he has a large task facing him in the 
Indians. Toronto will still be the doormat of the division. Here's an 
in-depth look at the AL East: 
New York Yankees-The Yankees won it all last year when they easily 
could have been destroyed by the turmoil off the field. Having gone 
through such a season the Yankees may have calmed down so this season 
will be a little more normal. If the Yankees are to win the division. they 
will have to expend all their energies on the playing field. 
The two major improvements this year are in the bullpen. Free agents 
Rich Gossage and Rawly Eastwick have been added. With Cy Young 
award winner Sparky Lyle already a Yankee, New York has the makings of 
one of the greatest bullpens in baseball history. Lyle. of course, has said 
he wants to be traded because he does not think their is going to be 
!Dough work for the three of them. With the injury problems the Yankee 
~tarters have been having and Billy Martin's plan to yank some starters 
.1fter only six innings. there should be plenty of work for this talented trio. 
The loss of Mike Torrez will hurt the starting rotation. Catfish Hunter is 
.:oming off his worst season ever, Don Gullet. is hurt again. and Ed 
Figueroa has been inconsistent during the spring. Ron Guidry and Dick 
Tidrow. moved to a starting spot, will have to pitch well. Maybe Martin 
.viii even take Ken Holtzman out of storage to see if he can still pitch. 
Offensively the Yankees are the same team they were last year. 
Thurman Munson, Graig Nettles and Reggie Jackson are the biggest run 
producers. Mickey Rivers and Willie Randolph provide solid hitting and 
speed on the basepaths. Chris Chambliss and Lou Pinella hit for average 
and knock in timely runs. 
Defensively. Jim Spencer is a valuable edition. The Gold Glove first 
'iacker will relieve Chambliss in late innings. Nettles is the best defensive 
third baseman in either league. He makes the great plays look easy. The 
Yankee outfield. when Roy White is out there has the worst set of arms in 
the league. Also. Jackson was a major defensive liability in rightfield last 
year. Fortunately, Paul Blair can relieve him. 
The Yankees should battle the Red Sox to the wire, edging them on the 
last day or two of the season. 
Boston Red Sox-Even with a poor pitching staff and some minor defensive 
problems. the Red Sox won 97 games last year. They did it with offensive 
power. They are just as strong offensively this year and they have taken 
steps to improve their pitching. They should win over 100 games. 
Mike Torrez and Dennis Eckersley are the two new starters for the Bosox and they should help immediately. Torrez. however, is a very slow starter. His 1977 record was only 17-13, and that was with a long winning streak in the second half of the season. He is not going to pitch every game as he did against the Dodgers in the World Series. Torrez will have problems pitching in Fenway Park. When he is throwing a bit high. 
the netover the Green Monster might fill with baseballs. Torrez's value will be seen when the Red Sox and Yankees are battling in late August and September. Eckersley is young and he throws hard. He had a no-hitter last year. With those powerful Boston bats behind him, he should become a :'!0 game winner. Luis Tiant and Bill "Spaceman" Lee, holdovers from last year's staff. will be the other starters. 
Th,· new reliever for the Red Sox is Dick Drago. He has been around for a few years but he is a valuable hurler. He should take some of the relief load off the shoulders of Bill Campbell. 
Not only do the Red Sox have power, now they also have speed. Jerry Remy. acquired from the Angels, has stolen 110 bases in the last th.i-ee years. and his lifetime batting average hovers around the .260 mark. He should team wi' Rick Burleson to give Boston a dynamic leadoff combination. ::g;ers Jim Rice, Butch Hobson, George Scott, Carl Yastremski and Carleton Fisk dot the rest of the Red Sox lineup. If Fred Lynn has recovered from his ankle injury, then he should add to their fire power. Boston should score more runs than ever this year. 
Remy's presence improves the team defensively. No longer will the inconsistent Denny Doyle be occupying the second base slot. George Scott. normally a superb outfielder, slumped some last season. Butch Hobson should improve at the hot corner. Burleson is sound at shortstop. 
Although Fred Lynn says Yastremski is not the fielder he once was. Yaz still plays the wall in Fenway better than anyone else. With Lynn in center and the riflearmed Dwight Evans in right. Boston has a fine defensive outfield. Rick Miller. defensive insurance for the flychasers. has been traded. 
Even with Torrez and Eckersly, the Red Sox are still shy on pitching. Neither Tiant or Lee has been consistent. Look for Boston to fall a game or two short of New York. Baltimore Orioles-The Orioles were not supposed to even be in the race last season. but somehow they survived until the end of September. Much of the credit goes to Earl Weaver. This year Weaver's task looks even more difficult as Rudy May and Ross Grimsley are both wearing the red. white and blue of the Montreal Expos. 
The Birds' biggest weapon in recent years has been Ken Singleton. However. he has been suffering from a back ailment and may not be able to perform up to his expectations. The bulk of the load will then have to be carried by Eddie Murray and Lee May. Murray. last season's Rookie-of-the-Year in the AL. has a world of potential as a slugger. May. who is nearing the end of an illustrious career. should have a few more solid seasons for the Orioles. AI Bumbry is a steady leadoff man and Doug DeCinces is a tough out. Carlos Lopez. obtained from Seattle. should help the offense. 
Defense has always been an Oriole strongpoint. Though it has declined somewhat. this year should be no different. Mark Belanger is entering his tenth season as the fulltime Baltimore shortstop. He is a magician with the glove. DeCinces will never make the fans forget Brooks Robinson, but 
he is a more than adequate defensive player. Rick Dempsey is back behind the plate after an injury. and his replacement, Dave Skaggs. showed that he can do a suitable job when called on. Bumbry is not the best centerfielder in the game and his arm is weak. Weaver may have unloaded Paul Blair too soon. 
Who do the Birds have to throw at opposing teams? Well there is the ageless Jim Palmer. Palmer pitched against the Dodgers in the 1966 World Series if you can remember that far back in baseball history. He has a .651 career winning percentage and that does not figure to decrease this year. The other starters should be Mike Hanagan. Dennis Martinez and either Scott McGregor or Don Stanhouse. If Stanhouse is moved to the bullpen. he will team with Tippy Martinez. These pitchers are not bad. just untested. They may not be able to fill the gap left by May and Grimsley. 
This should be a typical Baltimore team: scrapping for whatever they can get. and winning about 85 games. Detroit Tigers -The Tigers have slumped recently. They have not been a factor in the AL East. This year should begin a turnaround. ~The Tigers are committed to youth and they should begin to see some results. 
The best young player on the Tigers is Jason Thompson. Last year the young slugger socked 31 home runs and drove in 105 runs. He should be joined in the infield this season by a pair of twenty year old rookies, Lou Whitaker. the second baseman. and Alan Trammell, the shortstop. They They played together last year in the Tiger farm system and management thinks they are ready for the big time. This may be a painful transition early in the season, but by the end of the year this duo should have proved their value to the club. Another young player of note is Steve Kemp, who followed in the footsteps of Fred Lynn at USC. 
For veterans, the Tigers have Ron LeAore, the man who makes their attack go, and Milt May who steadies the young Tiger pitching staff. 
TheTigersfans are anxiously awaiting the return of "the Bird," Mark Fidrych, to top form. Dave Rozema, last season's rookie sensation, also must return to full strength if the Tigers are to win. Jim Slaton was added to the mound corps and he should help. Steve Foucault and John Hiller

National Champs start practice 
by Ray O'Brien Sports Editor 
The 1977 NCAA football national 
champions took to Cartier Field 
yesterday to begin their defense of 
the number one position. With 16 
monogram winners lost to gradua­
tion. Dan Devine has a lot of work 
ahead in the spring months. 
''I am just happy to be done with 
recruiting and public relations work 
and be back outdoors. the Irish 
coach commented. "Our approach 
will be no different than last year's preparation . 
The biggest switch so far has 
been the transporting of David 
Waymer across the line of scrim­
mage from his flanker positon to 
the left corner-back slot. 
"When I aske~ Waymer what he thought of the switch he said. "I just want to win another ring," explained Devine. 
The offense is highlighted by returners Joe Montana, Jerome Heavens, Vagas Ferguson and Kris Haines. Defensive stalwarts Bob Golic, Steve Heimkreiter, Jim Browner, Joe Restic and Randy Harrison will be looking to sharpen their skills in the warm weather and avoid injury. Names that will be missing this spring due to injuries are: Dave Mitchell, Jeff Weston, Mark Czaja, K.C. Ryan, Howard Meyer, Larry Graziani and Chris Muhlenkamp. 
The first scrimmage will be held this Saturday and will be open to the public. The tentative time is 

1:00 pm and, weather permitting, the event will be held in the stadium.
