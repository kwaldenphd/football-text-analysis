An hour an a half before most Notre Dame students walk lo their first Thursday morning class, John Osborn. Mike lleinz and Brian O'Donoghue will board the University's plane and head to Washington, D.C. They will be the 11rst students in Notre Dame history to all<'nd the winter Board of Trustees meeting and actually play active role in the discussions. 
"I think it is great we arc able lo attend the meet­ing," said Osborn, co-chair of the Board of Trustees reports committee. "I have been working on reports for three years ... and we are making great in-roads !'or student relations with the Board." 
Representing student opinion 

When the trustees agreed to hear student input at the wintnr meeting, they also suggested a specific topic for the students to speak on -"Students' ability to understand and articulate their Catholic faith." 
After receiving the topic, lleinz, Osborn and ()'Donoghue advertised and invited students to come to a focus group where they handed out surveys and had discussions with students to determine what role Catholicism plays at Notre Dame. Osborn said around 30 total students attended the focus group. 
"It is impossible to take 8,000 students and form one collective opinion," said Heinz, co-chair of the Board of Trustees reports committee. "We view ourselves as representatives and we've been put here on good faith ... We've tried to gather a spectrum of student opin­ion.

INSIDE COLUMN 

This season w-as for I.any 
In a state currently enamored with the New York Football Giants, Long Island native Jim Baumbach pledged his allegiances this past season to the J-E-T­
S. And thanks to a gracious long-time Jets season ticket holder. Baumbach's memories may surpass those ofthe fans oflhe 2001 Super Bowl runner­ups. 
So who was this mystery man? 
For over t:wo months, Bawnbach knew him as "La.ny." It made no difference. As long as he attended New York's 10 home games (including t:wo preseason con­tests}. Baumbach was content with his row 28, end zone seats. But after a random Internet search, Baumbach's curiosity peaked. 
This story begins in July, when Baumbach, a 22-year­old assistant Internet nevvs manager for Newsday.com, placed a bid on Ebay for five Jets season tickets. He lost the first auction but quickly found another eager seUer-Larry. Baumbach, his brother and three friends won the tickets. July 29, the quintet drove to East Rutherford. New Jersey for the Jets-New Orleans pre-season tilt. 
"When we got to the game, we were psyched," Bawnbach said. "We were basically throwing out Larry's name left and right. We were like 'This sea­son's for Larry."' 
Around Sept. 11, when New York was 4-0, Kevin Baumbach (Jim's 19-year-old brother) searched the Internet and came across Notre Dame's 2000 foot­ball roster. He scrolled down and noticed a familiar name: LoVecchio. The Irish quarterback shared the same last name as Larry, of"This season's for Larry," fame. Baumbach clicked on a link and found that Matt was from Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, the same hometown as Larry. 
On Oct. 7. while watching the Notre Dame­Stanford game, Kevin figured out the connection: Larry, the Ebay seller, was also Larry, Matt's father. 
"All of a sudden La.ny LoVecchio shows up on the 1V (getting interviewed)," Jim Baumbach said. "That was the kicker right there. At the end ofthe game they were running the music and they showed Larry in slow-motion, chanting." The Baurnbachs, who prefer the NFL, suddenly became Irish fans. 
"It was neat, following the whole Notre Dame run and watching Matt on 1V," Jim said. "When he first started, we would hear his name on SportsCenter and we were like, 'Hey, Matt LoVecchio.' We knew nothing of him. We didn't know how long his run would last" 
As the winning streak continued, the Baumbachs' hopes soared. IfNotre Dame qualified for a Bowl Championship Series berth and the Jets hosted a Wild Card game, both contests would be on the same weekend. Larry could not pass up his son's game, the Baumbachs reasoned. Jim sent an e-mail to Larry in late November inquiring about the possi­ble playoff game and also to see ifhe could have the tickets again in 2001. He waited a few weeks with­out getting a reply, then wrote a column for the Dec. 27 edition ofNewsday (Long Island's newspaper of record), chronicling his unexpected Ebay encounter. 
The next day, having read Jim's piece, Larry replied. "He was like. 'Sorry I never got back to you about the playoffs,"' Jim recalled. "'But ifyou want the tickets for next year, that would be fine.' I called my friends up that day and was like 'One more year of Jets tickets."' 
And another round of''This season's for Larry" chants.

OUTSIDE THE DOME 
Agents arrest Iowa State U. graduate student 
AIMES 

An Iowa State University graduate student and his brother await trial after being charged with attempting to export sophisticated military equipment to Pakistan, their home country. U.S. Customs Service agents, assisted by the Ames Police Department, arrested 36-year-old Tauquir Khan, graduate student in electrical and computer engineer­ing, early Wednesday and charged him with conspiracy to violate the Arms Export Control Act, said Customs spokesperson Dean Boyd. His brother, Tanzeem Khan, a natu­ralized U.S. citizen, also was arrest­ed Wednesday in Derby, Kan., on the same charge. Customs agents confiscated two pan-tilt-zoom cam­eras that are used to survey troop movement in battle, Boyd said. "Basically, these are very sophisti­cated cameras that are designed for drones, ... which are remote-con­trolled aircraft," he said. "You can fly it without a pilot, and you can imagine what that would do for sur­veillance." Drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles. are U.S. Munitions List items, Boyd said. The United States used drones in Desert Storm, he said, to take long-range pho­tographs or video surveillance. To export these items. one must be reg­istered with the State Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls and receive an export license, according to the Arms Control Export Act.Licensing the export of military equipment is rare, Boyd said, because of U.S. government sanc­tions against Pakistan. The sanc­tions were issued after the May 1998 nuclear testing in Pakistan, he said. Adding to the country's mili­tary instability was the 1999 mili­tary coup and ongoing tension with India. 

KENT STATE UNIVERSITY 
President revokes military rifles 
KENT, Ohio 
The M-16 military rifles purchased by the Kent State Police Department are being returned despite President Carol Cartwright's initial acceptance of the weapons. Cartwright asked the Kent State Police Department to return the weapons after hearing a wave of discontent in both the university and community. "I think it's a great decision made by President Carol Cartwright," said undergraduate student senator Ethan Picman. "It shows genuine concern and support for the students." Cartwright said she only had about five phone calls con­cerning the weapons, but both the petition from Undergraduate Student Senate to do away with the weapons and the large amount of media attention played a role in the request. "It shows what Senate can do when they rally around a cause," Senator Joe Dangelo said, "It shows we had our voices heard. Many students felt the way Latya Dent did." "They need to find a new type of gun which will be a little more suitable to students and the city of Kent," she said.

UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO 
Prof reinstated, charges dropped 
BOULDER, Colo. 

As of Thursday, Margaret Zamudio is no longer banned from the University of Colorado-Boulder cam­pus. The assistant sociology professor was banned without pay after officers from the Boulder County Drug Task Force and Boulder Police Dept arrested her on suspicion of selling cocaine in December. On Jan. 19 a Boulder District Court judge threw out the drug sales charges against Zamudio after she pied guilty to pos­session of drug paraphernalia, a petty offense. Zamudio said she was happy and grateful that the uni­versity finally did the right thing in returning her to the work she loves. "I worked so hard for my degree, to do what I do," said Zamudio. "To have it taken away... Now it's back, and I can continue to do what I want to do." Zamudio said the sociology department should be held accountable for putting her through the agony of being excluded without pay from the campus. "Someone has to look at the department and say, 'These guys really screwed up."' said Zamudio.

The Recommendations 
After gathering student input, Osborn. Heinz and O'Donoghue decided upon three recommendations thev will present to the Board on

Catholic doctrine and apolo­getics. 
"Many students had already had a course on Biblical histo­ry or they were uninterested in the topic," Osborn said. 
Heinz said the course will also teach Catholic opinion on contemporary topics such as abortion, birth control and homosexuality. 
The second recommendation 
Osborn said many students were dis­satisfied with the required Theology 100 course on Biblical history, so they are recom­mending an alter­native course be offered on Ministry. Osborn said if the two interacted. it would com­bine the social and spiritual aspects of faith. 

''Students should take the practical aspect of faith they learn in the classroom and go out and use that faith for social justice and social out­reach," Heinz said. 
The third recommendation parallels the second by emphasizing practical faith. Osborn, Heinz. and O'Donoghue said they are rec­ommending more programs be offered with the Center for the Homeless, the Logan Center and the Community Learning Center.

The magnitude 7.9 quake struck western India on Friday, and by Sunday more than 6,000 people were confirmed dead. The death toll was expected to rise by thousands more. 
At first, survivors said, help from the government was too slow in coming. When the quake hit, state officials were attending a military parade for Republic Day, a commemo­ration of the adoption of India's constitution in 1950. 
"We lost precious hours soon after the earthquake. Every state government officer we called was away at a parade. Even police came six hours after the quake," Dhrumal Vaidya, a movie cameraman, said Saturday. 
Chief Minister Keshubahi Patel. the top elected offi­cial of Gujarat state, where the quake hit, denied charges of a slow response. 
"I organized the officials at the parade itself and we got down to work. But an earthquake is not a cyclone," he said. "We were not forewarned." 
It took time to gather earth movers and cranes, and the larger ones could not reach many of the apartment buildings because of the region's narrow roads, Patel said. 
Vaidya lives in Ahmedabad, a city of 4.5 mi1lion people and the com­mercial capital of Gujarat state. At almost all the 42 collapsed buildings in the city. local residents com­plained they had to orga­nize rescues themselves. 
"The municipal corpora­tion has not helped at all," said Ashok Patel, a bank manager in a neighborhood where residents struggled to lift debris with a crane. 

"We private citizens have arranged for this single crane," he said. "We need at least another two cranes, but who will listen to us?" 
Vaidya blamed poor enforcement of construc­tion standards for many deaths. 
"So many buildings have come up in recent years which clearly wouldn't meet any of the building standards," he said. "Unscrupulous builders get away with it, and it takes a tragedy like this for people to realize they've been cheated."

Pope names 5 more Cardinals 
Associated P rc:ss 
VATICAN CITY 
Taking many by surprise, Pope John Paul II on Sunday named seven cardinals ­including a liberal -only a week after he set a record by announc­ing 37 new "princes" of the church. expanding the ranks 

John Paul II
of those who will some day elect his successor. 
Smiling broadly as he appeared at the window of his studio overlooking St. Peter's Square for his weekly appoint­ment with the faithful. John Paul gave no explanation for his unprecedented back-to­back announcements of new cardinals, who included a U.S. citizen born in the Ukraine and South Africa's first black cardinal. 
All together, 44 new mem­bers are being added to the College of Cardinals, bringing to 13 5 the number of those under 80 and thus eligible to vote for the next pontiff. Of these electors, John Paul has now named all but 10, nearly all doctrinal conservatives like himself. 
One new cardinal, 
Monsignor Lubomyr Husar, 
was only appointed three days 
earlier to lead Greek Catholics 
in Ukraine as archbishop in 
Lviv. An American. he left his 
native Ukraine in 1944 and 
studied and entered the priest­
hood in the United States. 
Then there are two 
Germans. One is liberal Mainz 
Archbishop Karl Lehmann, 
who only a year ago stunned 
the Vatican by saying the pope 
should step down if no longer 
able to lead the church. 
Lehmann immediately 
claimed that the interview was 
misinterpreted. But the inci­
dent, combined with his sug­
gestion that the Vatican should 
rethink its ban on Communion 
for divorced Catholics, made 
many observers say he never stood a chance of becoming a cardinal. 

'Tm pleased with the recog­nition of my work as a bishop and also as head of the German bishop's conference," Lehmann said. 
Also named from Germany is a staunch conservative, Johannes Deganhardt, arch­bishop of Paderborn. He was one of the first German bish­ops to pull out of a program that certified pregnant women who have had counseling, paving the way for legal abor­tions. The Vatican opposes the counseling system. 
Others to be made cardinals in a Feb. 21 ceremonv at the Vatican include Julio Terrazas Sandoval, archbishop of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia; and Wilfrid Fox Napier, archbishop of Durban, South Africa, who for years has fought for social justice. 
John Paul also revealed the names of two men made cardi­nals in 1998 but have persuaded the pope to put off the announcement to avoid aggravating tensions. 
And Jaworski's appointment might have been kept quiet to avoid sparking tension between Catholics and Orthodox in Ukraine. 
Husar's appointment to car­dinal rank was made possible by the death last month of the man he assisted for several years. Cardinal Myroslav Lubachivsky, and comes five months before the pope is to journey to Ukr.aine, part of the pontiff's efforts to improve relations in places with large Orthodox populations. 
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls, noting that Husar's appointment to the archbishop's post was only made Thursday, said the pope didn't want the Ukrainian to be the only cardinal named on the second announcement. Thus. said Navarro-Valls, the pope held off on some of the 
names in the 
first round.

Washington sending $5 million in quake aid 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON 
The United States will send $5 million in emergency sup­plies to earthquake-stricken lndia, officials said Sunday, and could send more as the situation worsens. 
More than 6,000 bodies have been recovered in the quake, and the death toll was expected to climb by several thousand more. Tens of thou­sands of Indians are home­less. 
"This is clearly a terrible earthquake,"said Len Rogers, acting assistant administra­tor in the bureau for humani­tarian response at the U.S. Agency for International Development. Rogers said the United States will monitor the relief effort and send more aid if it becomes neces­sary_ 
"This is a major disaster, and we will respond accord-ingly,"he said. 
A seven-person disaster response team will be in India on Monday. USAID said the United States would send supplies that include plastic sheeting, blankets, water containers, purification and distribution kits and genera­tors. 
The agency, through the organization CARE, also began distributing 100 met­ric tons of' food on Saturday. The emergency food will meet half the daily require­ments for 4,000 families for 15-20 days, USAID said. 
USAID also will provide financial assistance to sup­port the work of relief groups already on the ground in Gujarat, the In di an state hardest hit. 
Bhuj. a town in Gujarat, was near the epicenter of Friday's 7 .9-magnitude quake and suffered the most casualties and damage.

Wing residents, but Clinton's crew took the next step. In addition to defacing the · W keys on 40 White House keyboards, phone lines were cut or misdirected to other government offices, pornographic images were inserted randomly into copy machines, desks were overturned and fil­ing cabinets were glued shut. 
Even though it was no longer his air­craft, Clinton borrowed Air Force One to take him "home" to New York in style. It returned to Andrews Air Force Base nearly picked clean. with presidential seal-marked porcelain dishes, silver­ware, salt and pepper shakers, pillows, blankets, candies -even toothpaste ­pilfered from the plane. The seats might have been taken if they weren't bolted to the floor. 
They also shook down Democratic fat­cat donors for more than $200,000 in housewarming gifts cleverly timed before Hillary took her Senatorial oath of office and therefore came under more restric­tions for donations. One of the most gen­erous suppliers of the Clinton's gift reg­istry was Denise Rich, whose ex-hus­band, Marc Rich, skipped the country in 1983 after being indicted for tax evasion and making an illegal oil deal with Iran. He, somehow not surprisingly, received one of Clinton's 176 last-second presi­dential pardons. (Can we say "quid pro quo"?) 
Ointon also sealed outstanding legal cases shut, most notably by cutting a sweetheart deal with Independent CounsPI Robert Ray that would be called "a slap on the wrist" except slaps on the wrist are at least temporarily painful. 
The Janet Heno Justice Department brokered a similarly favorable arrange­ment for Indonesian billionaire James Riady, the foreign national who orches­trated the millions of dollars of illegal campaign contributions with which Clinton used to help him win reelection in 1996. 
He was a busy man, but he found time along the way to criticize the election process that put the son of the man Clinton vanquished in 1992 into the White House and sent his vice president to Columbia University. 
According to Clinton, George W. Bush won Florida because Republicans "stopped the voting." Not the counting, the voting. 
His final self-reflection on his adminis­tration: He had fun. And he wishes that the 22nd Amendment was altered so he could have another go-round. 
God help us all. 
Clinton's actions on the way. out only reinforce the truism that he was in office to serve not the American people, but Bill Clinton. Originally, Clinton performed all of his actions to get reelected. Then it was to stay in office. Then it was to build a legacy:Under the Clinton regime. rules of decorum and campaigning-even the Constitution -were bent to his will. A president didn't leave office, a king abdi­cated his throne. 
Let us examine the havoc King Clinton and his cronies have wrought, in semi­chronological order: A huge tax increase in 1993. The attempt to nationalize one­seventh of the U.S. economy; a gutted military which is spread all over the world in areas where they don't belong; the "war room," normally only used dur­ing campaigns, as a day-to-day opera­tion; smear campaigns which helped destroy the careers of Billy Dale, Newt Gingrich, Ken Starr, Llnda Tripp and many others; the use of the Internal Revenue Service to harass political ene­mies; 900 FBI files which weren't an enemies' list, but a "bureaucratic snafu;" the acceptance of stonewalling, perjury and "the politics of personal destruc­tion;" nuclear secrets traded to and/or stolen by China: "putting the Lincoln Bedroom up to the highest bidder; com­mencing bombing missions against Iraq and Serbia in an attempt. to push person­al indiscretions off the front page; issuing executive orders and presidential pre­rogative to avoid testifying before a grand jury; ABC News putting a warning of sexual content on the screen when he finally did testify. Add to it the outright theft of items from Air Force One and the White House and the destruction of oth­ers. 
Bill Clinton left office without enacting one piece of meaningful legislation by himself. He was bullied into signing wel­fare reform (after vetoing it twice) and six other maxims in the Contract With America. Most of his pct projects, like "100,000 new cops on the streets," have either not panned out or have been inef­fective. And all of the things on which Al Gore based his campaign -Social Security reform, education reform, Medicare reform -could and should have been completed in eight golden years of prosperity. 
Speaking of that prosperity, Clinton had as much to do with it as he does for the weather in South Bend. He was just lucky enough to be in charge when the e­conomy/dot.conomy boomed. Ile did . nothing except enjoy the ride. I le didn't cut taxes to fuel the economy or to give the surplus back to the American people. 
And now that apparently the ride has ended, he has no choice but hope that everyone believes that the slowdown/recession is the fault of the new administration. As George W. Bush himself said, "The path of least resis­tance is always downhill." 
Bill Clinton's legacy will be a slowing economy, the most unethical administra­tion in history and a blue dress with a stain on it (kind of metaphoric, ain't it?). So, goodbye, Mr. Clinton, good riddance, and thanks for nothing. Glad you had fun.

We were all supposed to go back to living straight oIT the land like our forefathers or our forefather's fathers. It would have been

I'd like to ponder martial law. That would be interesting. Martial law. In 1999, 1 was thinking such law wasn't very democrat­ic, but heck, I had some connections so I wasn't too worried. I was hop­ing that there would be a short time of martial law. and then we could all go about our business: gathering crops, tending the Hocks, herding the herds. Hight. Well.

Let's slop a minute. though. and ponder the modern era. Did Y2K problems really pass by, leaving only a fow stones touched? I wonder. One may never know. 
It is important to note, however. that that illustrious visionary from Lhc 16th century, Nostradamus, predicted a Y2K catastrophe in the form of global warming for this new millennium. Well. okay, he may have actual­ly said that a "great king of terror" would come from the sky in 1999. But many have interpreted this to be a long-term sky-king of terror, i.e. global warming. And we all know that the Earth's temperature is gradu­ally increasing; glaciers are gradually melt­ing: patches of permafrost arc melting in Alaska that have never melted before.

I was pondering what might happen in 2020 and 2020 looks an awful lot like 20/20 as in vision so maybe that's the date when many will lose their vision, having stared one too many times into a palm-pilot. Certainly, it's a shot in the dark, but one simply cannot dismiss the quiet and strange problems of a new millennium. Maybe going back to a time before industry, to a time when land was the key to power, is not the answer to modern problems (although hav­ing a horse as a personal transportation vehicle would still be neat), but using every­thing that is new just because it is new. is not the way to avoid technological problems either.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Answering charge of 
'Deceptive diversity' 
This letter is in response to Friday's front page article entitled "Deceptive 
Diversity." 
In a time when we are looking for unity on the campus of Notre Dame, it is unfortunate that an article be printed that portrays the Admissions Oflice as deceiving diversity students. As a minority person who has been part of the Notre Dame community for 7 years, it disheartens me that such negativity is highlighted for such a successful program. 
Th~ ~ulticultural Recruitment Committee of the Otnce of Undergraduate Adm1ss10ns feels as though we were the ones deceived when we were inter­viewed for this Sp~ing Visitation article. We incorrectly assumed it was going to be :in opportunity for us to get more people involved in the minority recrmtment process. Instead of highlighting all of the positive aspecL'i or the Spring Visitation program, The Observer decided to highlight a negative 
aspect. 

The main purpose of Spring Visitation is to bring students here who may not be fortunate enough to visit the campus on their own as well as high tal­ent diversity students that may not. be considering Notre Dame as their first choice. This is an opportunity for students to decide, for themselves, whether 
or not Notre Dame is their match. In no way are we trying to sell Notre Dame. Spring Visitation is not a show. We hope that students leave Notre Dame knowing that we have answered all of their unanswered questions. We also hope to clarify all of the misconceptions of this place by exposing them to a taste of the different cultural events that take place throughout the year. This is the main reason why the organizations that put on the shows, choose this particular weekend. 
Many of the prospective students feel fortunate in August because they 
have made friends before arrival to campus. Most will stay in contact 
throughout the summer and those that are from the same area will also get 
together and plan their first trip to Notre Dame as freshmen. 
Recruiting minorities is a diflicultjob, but it is not impossible. The most 
important thing, though. is that we be supported by the Notre Dame commu­
nity, as an office that is here to help the University as a whole. There is so 
much effort that is put into this weekend, and we work extremely hard to 
improve it every year. The only way to increase. diversity on this campus is to 
have as many people as possible involved in the recruitment process. Every 
student on this campus is a recruiter for Notre Dame. We appreciate all of 
the students and alumni that return to their high schools and hometowns to 
spread the word of Notre Dame and identify those prospectives that will reap 
the benefits of this fine institution. 
Negative focus hurts more than helps and if you choose to magnify it, then 
it will only make our job that more diflicult. It is important to know that 
Spring Visitation does not hurt us in any way. 
It is also important to know that without the support of the community, we 
are never going to improve the diversity of this campus. We challenge this 
campus to come together and unite and help N.D. become a better place.

By SCOTT LITTLE 
s~ene Writer 

Here you are at school. It is a lot like a play-dough facto­ry. In you go, a brightly col­ored blob, and then out you come in a fun shape like stars or spaghetti. The athletic clubs of Notre Dame allow students and professors to reach that next level in their livelihoods by rounding their buttockses and molding their attitudes with the hopes of squeezing out a better­formed person. Here are just a few of the options that you may have overlooked at activ­ities night, but could add the extra dimension to your life that you have been looking for: 
Ballroom Dancing 
The Notre Dame Ballroom Club may come in handy for anyone who likes to impress the ladies (or gentlemen) with smooth moves and grace. And ladies. you can be as ugly as a worm and still get the guys if you know where to throw your weight around on the dance floor. The group meets two times a week, on Tues·days (8:30 to 10:00p.m.) and Thursdays (8:00 to 9:30p.m.). The cost is $4 per session or you can pay $30 for the whole semester. It is a great place to get the individ­ual attention that we all crave. A competition is com­ing to Notre Dame March 31. There will undoubtedlv be all your favorite dancing styles including the cha-cha, tango and Latin. 

Women's Boxing 

When you think about box­ing, you probably think about men. Well, not at Notre Dame. The Women's Boxing Team is probably the only women's boxing program in the country. Despite popular belief. the average woman boxer is not a toothless, 

The Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Equestrian Club is one of the many University sponsored organi­zations offering students a chance to try something new. 
rough-n-tough, knockabout kind of a girl. They arc well­mannered, sleek, cute faced delights. If you are a guy, it is possible to help out, but you have to be good at boxing. So if you are a guy that likes to get beat up by girls, you'll have to dress up like one to get hit by one. They train for four weeks. and instructional­ly spar for two. They aren't allowed to box in public. like the men's Bengal Bouts. but we all hope they will be able to in the coming years. In order for this to happen the University has to start think­ing of the sport like it's Tae­130 and not mud wrestling. 
Triathlons 

The Triathlon Club is anoth­er gem of' the ND/Saint Mary's athletic club tradition. It is currently in its second year. Last semester St. Mary's host­ed their own triathlon. It takes a lot of' training and dedication, but when you're done you will know three sp.orts -running, swimming and biking. Because there is so much training, a members have to practice on their own from time to time. There are people .available to help you set-up a program. though. Only girls belong to this club, but they will accept boys. Contact Jean Tierney if you arc interested.

of my memories. Overwhelmed by the melodies and the recollections they bring, l return to Toledo, my home for the three and a half months of Fall semester 2000. 
Without buying a plane ticket or packing my bags, I find myself arriv ing in the heart of Toled(i again, the way I always did, bouncing up the steep, slanting roads on one of the many ubiquitous city buses. Suddenly, the maze of streets opens into a clear­ing and the Plaza Zocodover comes into view ahead. 
To the left side, a string of cheerful marzipan shops flanks the familiar plaza, beckoning to tourists and ·natives alike with endless rows of' almond-scented treats. Clusters of yel­low-tinged buildings and cafes with plentiful outdoor seating form the semicircular border of Zocodover. Busy at all hours, the plaza offers the observer a broad spectrum of Spaniards; elderly couples who have seen generations come and go in this old city, boisterous youth who spill into the streets as they shout out their plans for the evening, and middle­aged women who expertly sidestep the crowds en route to the local bak­ery to buy the bread of the day. Except for the whining pitch of the occasional youth-driven motorcycle, the town center of Toledo appears much as I'd imagine it did a few hun­dred years ago. 
From Zocodover, I'd navigate the winding cobblestone streets effortless­ly, making sharp turns and finding shortcuts to a pleasant plaza, where the crowds fade away and paved roads and tourists are only memories. In this quiet, persistently sunny cor­ner of medieval Toledo is the Fundacion Ortega y Gasset, the school for international students where Notre Dame students spend their semester or academic year. I remem­ber clearly the central courtyard where we danced to the music of a Spanish band under the open night sky. and the daily anticipation of our 2 p.m. lunch, Spanish-style, which always seemed to take too long to arrive. 
All of this, these familiar places and swirls in my mind, as I open my eyes and find myself at Notre Dame once again; the music in my mind dissolves and I'm faced with a friend awaiting my answer. "How was Spain?" he'll. 
repeat. 

"It was incredible; it changed my life," I'll always respond, unable to put into words my muddled thoughts. And my friend will nod and smile, confident that those seven words are a fair representation of my experi­ence. I'm only sorry that I can't take everyone I know back there, for no words on paper can capture the color and vitality of the semester abroad, and no descriptions can do justice to the place I called home while I was away.

the Big East West Division race. Notre Dame's normal strategy would be to turn All­American Troy Murphy loose inside and keep forwards Ryan Humphrey and Harold Swanagan. who were shooting just 54 percent from the foul 
line in league play prior to Saturday, far from the charity stripe. ­
Yet Murphy was relegated to the bench after fouling out with four minutes, 27 seconds to play. Brey called a quick timeout to tell the team his tactics for garnering the upset victory. 
"We wanted to look a little more perimeter-oriented," Brey said of his game plan

offense: The Irish forte is scoring. The loaded back­court of Graves, Carroll and Jngelsby is supplemented by down-low threats Murphy, Humphrey and Swanagan, and the Irish have no trouble here. Even individual slumps are overshadowed, bccausl:l there's always another weapon on the mark. 
ball-handling: Ingelsby has silenced many critics by 
leading the league in assist/turnover ratio, while 
Carroll has nearly equaled his older teammate in the same category. The point play isn't quick or flashy, 
but it's stealthy and consistent. 
defense: Broy had to drill the idea of an active man­to-man into his squad's head after staying in zone most of last year. Yet it's finally caught on, and the 
Irish are holding conference opponents to one of 
the lowest point totals and field goal shooting per­
centages of any Big East team. 
rebounds: Murphy and Humphrey are among the league's best, and they should be with their athleti­cism. Swanagan provides a boost when in. One thermometer for Irish success is whether the rest of the squad keeps up its end of the bargain. 
hustle: Swanagan's the king of floor burns, and 
Carroll's gotten up close and personal with the 
hardwood at times. Since the new year began, the 
other players have been taking cues from 
Swanagan, and Graves has become a star pupil 
since moving to the role of Super Sub. 
teamwork: Notre Dame's "starting six" are long on talent. The only problem with having so much skill is finding a way to juggle roles and keep team goals above personal aims. Working together netted wins over Syracuse and Georgetown, and a lack con­tributed to early season losses. 
bench: It's tough to rate this group, since a faceC+beyond the top six rarely enters the lineup. However, more was expected from Jones, Macura

and Kartelo at the season's start. 
coaching: The Irish have a different feel than they did beneath Doherty. Late season play will determine which style has been more successful, but the team is on a roll right now and at the top of its division. 
3.25 

overall: Notre Dame's voice squeaked a bit as growing pains and the pressure of high expectations hit, but adolescence seems over as the Irish ride a four-game winning streak. Better to work through problems early than discover them in the midst of March Madness, a phenomenon the Irish are likely to experience for the first time in more than a decade.

"I never thought that 1 would be sitting here telling you that I thought Notre Dame played better without Murphy than with him." Hoya

Humphrey batted down both free throws for Notre Dame·s first lead of the game, a 61-59 threshold, with 3:57 to play. After an official timeout, Georgetown's Wesley Wilson, who scored 10 points off the bench, missed his own put­back, and Humphrey grabbed the board. 
Back on offense, Humphrey, who led the Irish with 17 points and 10 rebounds, 
couldn't  guide  the  ball  
through  the  hoop,  but  
Swanagan eked  out  the  

rebound and was hammered in the process. The 6-foot-7 junior, starting his fourth straight game in place of Graves, followed through with two free throws to crank the Irish ahead by four. 
"Swanagan's been the guy we've used as an example with our team to do the tough, dirty little things," Brey said. "He is so well respected by his teammates I think at times he has shamed them into taking charges, diving after loose balls and setting screens." 
Both teams failed to convert on their next offensive series, then Humphrey and Graves 
free throws, and that was a big part of how they closed the game." 

At the other end, Swanagan rebounded a shot by Georgetown's second-leading scorer, Ruben Boumtje. who the Irish held scoreless on the day. The Hoyas, desperate to geCback in the game, fouled Swanagan, who sank his fifth straight free throw. 
Humphrey connected on one of two free throws a few sec­onds later to close out a 19-2 Notre Dame explosion. The scoring stream began on back-to-back treys by Graves and a long distance shot by Ingelsby to tie the game at 59, Notre Dame's first tie since a 2-2 start. 
The Hoyas whittled the Irish lead to seven in the final minute. After Lee Scruggs, who topped Georgetown's scorers with 17, and Gerald Riley, fouled out, the Irish hung back from defending the Hoyas. choosing to avoid any piddly fouls that could cut at their scoring handicap. 
Georgetown carved out an early lead. crafting as large as an eight-point advantage sev­eral times, the latest a 54-46 
scored 15 in 
the game, 
ground out 
one of his best defensive efforts this year. Notre Dame as a whole outrebounded Georgetown. which leads the Big East in boards per game, 38 to 37. 
The tag team road win com­pleted Notre Dame's primer lesson in life without Murphy. Two days practicing without their 6-foot-10 captain this week helped school the Irish in avoiding the Fall of Troy. Murphy missed most of Thursday's practice with a sore toe, and a hard blow to the head early in Friday's workout sidelined him the day before battling the Hoyas.

continued from page 20 
head, seemingly in disbelief as lngelsby pumped his fist and the Irish bench jumped to its feet. 
After all, why would Esherick expect the shot to come from Ingels by. an assist artist rather than Graves who has no reser­vations about tossing up the long shot whether he's on or not, or Carroll who had already come through with a couple clutch threes? 
He didn't. 
And so went Notre Dame's unlikely 78-71 upset Saturday over No. 10 Georgetown. It wasn't the score that was unlikely; it was the way it hap­pened. 
"Our defense was very good in the first half," Esherick said. "But in the second half we left guys that can shoot well open." 
That and Esherick bet heavily that Notre Dame would play its typical basketball game. 
He gambled that when Troy 1\-i.:rphy, the bedrock of the Irish offense fouled out with 
4:27 remaining, he could elimi­nate the Irish post play and quiet the fans to swing momen­tum back the Boyas' way. 
He gambled that forwards Ryan Humphrey and Harold Swanagan would put on their typical less-than-stellar perfor­mances from the free throw lire. 
And he gambled that his team could keep up its impres­sive field goal percentage to close out the game. 
But in a high-stakes game with the top spot in the Big East West Division on the line, none of the dice rolled in Esherick's favor. 
Great teams know how to risk it all and lay it on the line when it counts and the Irish gave the Hoyas a quick glimpse of that greatness in the game's final stretch. 
"We knew we had to stay close and then make a run at the end," Murphy said. "We knew we could win and we came to play." 
Just not in the usual way. 

No one could have scripted a better plot and made it believ­able. But, sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. And a lot more exciting, too. 
As the minutes ticked off the clock, the Hoyas needed just one card to fall in their favor; the Irish needed them all. And while Georgetown could not even grab one break, Notre Dame found them all. 
And the Irish did it for the 

most part without Murphy. 
"It just shows we're a big time team," Humphrey said. "Troy is a big asset, but we're not a one-man team. Everyone can come out and play." 
Humphrey and teammate 

Swanagan came not only to play, but to lead by example in the final minutes. taking their game to new heights. 
Targeted as easy marks by the Hoyas, the pair had shot just over 50 percent from the line in Big East games this sea­son. 
But just minutes away from tasting their second big upset in less than a week, Swanagan went 7-7 from the line while Humphrey added 5-8. causing Esherick's strategy to backfire. 
"Swanagan and Humphrey made their free throws," Esherick said. "It's a big part of how they closed the game. I don't know what you can do for free throw defense. I haven't figured out a way to guard from the line yet." 
Even with the poise of the Humphrey and Swanagan. the Boyas could have pulled out a win with their usually consis­tent offensive arsenal. But the team that had been averaging a little more than 50 percent from the floor most of the game suddenly went cold. Unable to score on nine straight posses­sions over five minutes, the Boyas felt the game slip away as the Irish went on a 17-2 run to surprise the 17 -2 Big East power house. 
. "It wasn't necessarily making bad decisions and taking poor shots," Esherick said. "It was more a product of trying to catch up and having to go for it." 
But on an improbable after­noon, It was Notre Dame, not Georgetown, that went for it and got it all. 
When officials called Murphy for his fifth foul. the Hoyas thought the scales had tipped in their favor. But they forgot the weight a team hungry for an upset can have when each player carries more than his usual load. 
And that extra weight has now upped the stakes for the rest of the season, as the Irish will ascend to the No. 1 division spot. 
"It's good," Murphy said. "It's not bad. Nice. Hopefully it will stay that way." 
After Saturday's improbable outcome, it should be expected.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
Belles cartwheel into MIAA cellar 
By KATIE McVOY Assistant Spores Editor 
In a game that left fans without a smile, a Katie Christiansen cartwheel with a minute and a half left was enough to make the crowd at Angela Athletic Facility go crazy. 
But even the antics weren't enough to capture a game for the Belles, as Saint Mary's dropped its seventh consecu­tive matchup against Albion College Saturday, 56-69. 
The Christiansen cartwheel came as an attempt to miss falling on an Albion player late in the second half. With the score at 51-62, it was enough to pep up a disap­pointed crowd. 
Coming into Saturday's game, a must-win game to remain out of last place in the MIM, the Belles were looking for a chance to get back on their feet and win. However, the Britons of Albion (1-16) were looking for that same opportunity. It was the Britons that came out on top. 
"I think this team was better 

than us," head coach Suzanne 
Smith said. "We had it in our 
minds that we could just get 
out there and not do anything 
and win." 
The effort was there for the 

Belles, but the focus was not. 
Anne Blair started off the 

game with a field goal to put 
the Belles on top. Ten minutes 
into the first quarter, a foul 
sent Christiansen to the line in the bonus. and she made both foul shots, keeping Saint Mary's in the lead 18-16. That was the last time the Belles would be in control of the game. 
Saint Mary's shot 28 percent during the first half. leaving them behind by four as the halftime buzzer sounded. Although their shooting per­centage went up in the second half, turnovers, a weak defense, and a general loss of' focus dropped the Belles to the 13 point deficit that ended the game. 
"We just lost focus," Smith said. "We may have looked and the score and just given up." 
Albion scored 15 points early in the second half; Saint Mary's only answered with four. After that, the closest the Belles came was within eight. 
"We're having a hard time right now," Smith said. "We need someone to step up right now and its not happening." 
Blair led the team in offense again, with 16 total points. Katie Miller and Shaun Hussell joined her with nine and eight points, respectively. 
Becky Cambpell lead the Britons with 18 points. Teammates Amanda Yeater and Stacey Supanich joined her with 12 and 13 points, as the three players totaled over half of the Britons' offense. 
The Belles take the road to 

face off against Alma College 
in Michigan Wednesday night.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING 
Irish splash past fatigue, win consecutive dual meets 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Spom Wrir"r 
If the Notre Dame women's swimming team was tired, they didn't show it. 
Just 24 hours after edging No. 23 Northwestern 154-146 Thursday night. Notre Dame turned around and upset No. 14 Michigan 157--143 on Friday afternoon to finish the dual meet sea.son 10-1. 
best 56.0 in the 100-yard backstroke and a 2:00.47 in the 200-yard backstroke, chopping nearly three seconds of her pre­
vious best. Hecking w o u l d eclipse the mark a day 1 a t e r against Michigan. 
Freshman 


M a r i e Hecklng Labo sky also had a tremendous week­
end by taking home five indi­vidual victories. She won the 1,000-yard freestyle against both Michigan and Northwestern -her time of 
10:03.16 against the Wildcats is her best performance of the season. 
Labosky also took first in the 200-yard individual medley and the 500-yard freestyle against Northwestern, and she won the 400-yard individual medley against Michigan. 
The freshman also took sec­ond place in the 500-yard freestyle against the Wolverines -her NCAA quali­fying time of 4:53.49 was just five hundredths of a second of first and nearly four seconds faster than her time against Northwestern. 
"I think Marie made a tacti­
cal error in the 500, one that 
probably cost her the race," 
said Weathers. "She went out 
a little early. But she still had 
a great race." 
Junior Heather Mattingly won all four diving events. Her 
324.67 point total against Michigan was an NCAA-quali­fying mark. Mattingly has now won six consecutive diving events. 
"Heather's been solid for us all year," said Weathers. "When you compete against two Big Ten teams and win four boards, it's a great effort." 
The Irish used two complete­ly different strategies to knock of Northwestern and Michigan. Against the Wildcats, they relied on their depth to take crucial second and third place 
positions away from Northwestern. However, against the Wolverines, the Irish recorded four NCAA­qualifying performances and capturedlO out of 16 first place spots. 
Notre Dame counted on its depth to stay ahead of Northwestern, especially in the early events. Although the Wildcats took first in the 200­yard freestyle, the 100-yard breaststroke, and the 100­yard butterny, the Irish man­aged to secure enough places to still outscore the Wildcats. 
In the 200-yard freestyle, Lindsay Moorhead, Brenda Reilly. and Kristen Van Saun took second through fourth place. Laurie Musgrave and Allison Lloyd captured second and third in the 100-yard breaststroke. while Lisa Garcia and Sarah Bowman took second and third in the 100 butterfly. 
The Irish dominated Michigan in part because they took the top two places in mul­tiple events, allowing them to build an early lead. Van Saun followed Labosky in the 1,000­yard freestyle, while Musgrave and Lloyd took first and sec­ond in the 100-yard breast­stroke. 
In the 100-yard butterfly, Notre Dame went one-two­three as Amy Deger, Lisa D'Olier, and Garcia picked up crucial points for the Irish. Later, Musgrave also won the 200-yard breaststroke. 
"Amy was probably the biggest shock," said Weathers. "She really struggled on Thursday, and then on Friday, two of her races were lifetime bests." 
The Irish put an exclamation 
point on an outstanding week­
end by taking the top three 
places in the 400-yard individ­
ual medley when Labosky, 
Deger, and Tiffany O'Brien 
secured the Notre Dame victo­
ry. 
The Irish have three weeks 
without any competitions 
scheduled before they travel to 
New York for the Big East 
Championships. Notre Dame 
has won the last four conf'er­
ence titles. 
"The key for us now is rest," 
said Weathers. "We really 
have to individualize workouts 
now. You end up every day 
with a different workout !'or 
everyone." 
NOIIIY:,HH,HEIKS IETIERI 

"In all the time I've been here, I don't think we've ever had two meets that tough even within a week," said Notre Dame head coach Bailey Weathers. "To have two meets that tough back-to-back and win both is just incredible." · 
Junior Kelly Hecking led the way for the Irish with a pair of victories against Michigan in the 100-yard and 200-yard backstroke. Her times of 56.01 seconds in the 100 backstroke 
and 2:00.32 in the 200-yard backstroke were among her fastest performances of the year. 
"I think she's really, really excited about where she is at this point in the season," said Weathers. "Kelly's started to shift her focus from Big Easts to seeing what she can do at NCAAs." 
Against Northwestern, Hecking was equally as domi­nant. She swam a personal

Georgetown win exemplifies strong supporting cast 
" expert" Ted Fox analysis, which is 
only slight-Fox Sports... ly more Almost 
flawed than my frequently freezing computer, spit out Georgetown 69, Notre Dame 
61. 
OK, so reverse the winner and the loser, add 10 to both scores, and then subtract one from the higher point total. 
Or just say Notre Dame 78, Georgetown 71. 
Let's get down to what this game really showed. The Irish were on the road. Troy Murphy became the nation's highest scoring cheerleader with a lit­tle over four minutes to go in the game. The score was tied 

___. at 59, and the Irish hadn't led all day. Any one of these factors -a conference road game, losing your go-to-guy, battling in a close game -could have ended the conference winning 
I really have to stop underes­timating these Notre Dame basketball teams. 
When 

asked to make a prediction f o r Saturday's 
m e n ' s g a m e against No. 10 George­town, my streak at three. 


But they didn't. 
Harold Swanagan stepped up and filled the potential scoring void at the point in the game where it looked like Georgetown was ready to ~eep a quality win off the Irish resume_ 
Before Saturday's game. Swanagan had shot only 38 free throws on the season and made 23, good for around 60.5 percent. 
In those last four minutes, not only did he get to the line four times and attempt seven free throws, he hit all seven. 
With that little time left, on the road, in a game in which you're the underdog. shooting free throws can feel like trying to drop a basketball into a golf hole. no matter how good a shooter you are. Fortunately for Irish fans, the man at the line didn"t see it that way_ 
And it wasn't just Swanagan. This game for Notre Dame exemplified the contributions from all over the floor that it takes to reach the top of the conference standings. which is where the Irish currently reside. 
Five people scored in double digits, with Ryan Humphrey_ leading the way with 17 points (he also led the team with 10 boards). 
David Graves took a charge and got to know the paint bet­ter than Sherwin Williams. Graves. Matt Carroll. and Martin Ingelsby combined to go 7-11 from three ball range. These 21 points were three times (bad pun. I know) as important for the Irish, as Georgetown focused most of its defensive assault on the guys operating down low. 
With this string of wins, the Irish are on a roll now. Not a roll that has Dicky V. scream­ing: "Let's cut down the nets and raise the roof a.t the Joyce Center because this is Basketball City. USA, baby!" but a roll nonetheless. 
And you know, it's funny, but it seems like every time I write a column about a big Notre Dame win, I always end up talking about ho\Y the journey isn't over. Whether the senti­ment or my wording of it is the bigger cliche, I don't know, but it seems to hold true. 
When the team got back from the game yesterday. Matt Carroll talked about the upcoming Pittsburgh game and how he felt the loss in Panther country last year might have been one of those "bad" losses the selection committee looked at in leaving Notre Dame out ol' the NCM tournament. 
He and the rest of the team know that people can forget four straight wins pretty quick­ly if you lose lo a learn you've already beaten by 16 at home_ 
But who cares about what people think'? A loss next week­end would affect a team trying lo get to the Big Dance for the first time in years, after being snubbed last March, a lot more than the people who follow their games. 
Notre Dame knows that it needs to keep winning, whether it's Georgetown or No­Town, and it has proven it can do so with a diversified attack. 
And, like the beginning of the season, they're once again a team everyone wants to beat.

SUPER BOWL XXXV 

Lewis, Ravens back up trash talk, top Giants 34-7 
Associated Press 

TAMPA. Fla. Baltimore's brazen defense backed up its bragging. After boasting all week that the Giants couldn't move on 
their league-leading unit, Ray Lewis and the Ravens did what they said they would. beating New York 34-7 for their first Super Bowl vic­tory. 
Despite the score, 


Sunday's game was Lewis as advertised -a battle of defenses until New York's wilt­ed late in the game. 
Led by Lewis, the MVP, the Ravens intercepted Kerry Collins four times, the final pick returned 49 yards for a touch­down by Duane Starks, the first of three TDs on three plays late in the third quar­ter. The other two were kickoff returns for scores by Ron Dixon of New York and Jermaine Lewis of Baltimore, the first time that's ever happened in a Super Bowl. 
"If you put this in a storybook, nobody would believe it," said Ray Lewis, who was arrested Jast year on murder charges in the stabbing deaths of two men at a Super Bowl party in Atlanta. He subsequently pleaded guilty to a misde­meanor charge of obstructing justice. 
"We didn't just break records, we shat­tered them," Lewis said. "We dominated .literally. This is what you work your whole life for. You come from childhood, dreaming whatever you want it to be, but now, at 25, to be a world champion, what else can I dream of?" 
The Ravens held the Giants to just 149 yards total offense in giving Art Modell his first Super Bowl win in 40 years as an owner. He won one NFL title in 35 seasons in Cleveland before inoving his franchise to Baltimore in 1996, but he had never been to a Super Bowl, losing two close AFC title games in Cleveland. 
The 75-year-old Modell won by beating his good friend Wellington Mara of the Giants, who has 75 seasons in the NFL. 
"To the people of Baltimore, to the people of Maryland. This is for you," said Model!. who stood on the podium hug­ging son David as he received the Vince Lombardi Trophy from commissioner Paul Tagliabue. 
So effective was Baltimore's defense that. the New York offense never got inside its 29. The game might as well have been stopped after Trent Dilfer's 38-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Stokley with 6:50 left in the lirst quarter gave the Ravens a 7-0 lead. It stayed that way for most of the first half. 
Before the game, Dilfer said all he wanted to be was the quarterback of a team that won a Super Bowl despite its quarterback. He is after completing 12 of 25 passes for 153 yards, in his rnturn to Tampa Bay, where he was released by the Buccaneers aft.er last season. 
"I didn't throw the ball very well," Dilfer said. "But we b\lked about making
