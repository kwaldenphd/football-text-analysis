HPC plans for return of Weekend Wheels program 
By PAUL PEARSON & STEVEN KRAUSS 
News Writers 
The Hall Presidents Council (IIPC) voted unanimously Tues­day night to restart the The Weekend Wheels bus program, which transports students from off-campus bars back to cam­pus and to Campus View Apartments, by September 28th. 
The program, which has been sponsored by HPC since Its in­ception in 1988, used to use lo­cal school buses and drivers to transport students. These buses can no longer be used due to an Indiana law, passed In 1986 and now being enforced by the state highway patrol, which forbids school buses to be used on state highways as anything other than school buses. 
Since learning that the school buses can no longer be used, HPC co-chairman Charlie James has looked into other options for continuing the program. He contacted United Limo, which told him that they would charge $158/day for the service. This, James said, would be "about twice as much" as they paid the school buses (which cost $150/weekend), and would not be covered by the $4,200 in the HPC budget set aside for the program. 
Tuesday night HPC passed a proposal to use the entire $4,200 budget for flrst semester expenses only. Furthermore, they decided to set aside $4,500 in profits from The Shirt sales in order to keep the service running next semester. 
James said he was "very pleased" with the decision, but he hopes the extra money won't have to be used. "Next semester I hope we can find funding from some alternate source other than HPC because that money is supposed to be for hall allocations." 
James said the decision con­stituted a "big sacriflce" by the dorms, and is, "a message to the administration that this is a very important student need." 
Before the meeting, James and HPC co-chairman Kevin Roxas talked with James 
O'Meara recognized for contributions in field of mathematics: elected fellow 

By ANN MARIE HARTMAN 
News Writer 
In recognition of his mathe­matical research and contribu­tions to the enhancement of Notre Dame's education for nearly 30 years, University of Notre Dame provost, Timothy 0' Meara, has been elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. 
Upon his induction Into the Academy In October, O'Meara will join the select company of 3,400 leading figures from academia, government, busi­ness, and the creative arts in­cluding 152 Nobel laureates and 50 Pulitzer Prize winners. 
"Nominations for the Academy come from local members," said O'Meara. "The nominations are then compiled from all over the country and the final selections are an-Lyphout, associate vice presi­dent for business affairs. Lyphout, in turn, contacted the Office of Student Affairs in search of extra funding. How­ever, according to James, Stu­dent Affairs said that it would not make up the difference. 
James believes that this is be­cause the office does riot want to encourage people going to the "Five Corners" area of South Bend, where Bridget McGuire's Filling Station and the Commons are located, for fear of off-campus crime. 
According to James, to take the "Five Corners" area off Weekend Wheels' route would make the service "ineffective," since "more than 50 percent" of its passengers are picked up at that stop. 
Flanner Hall co-president Rich Delevan commented, "If the administration wants to keep people out of the Five Corners area by killing off this program, then taking money away from hall allocations in order to keep It going is worth it." 
The buses ran every Friday and Saturday between 12 and 3 
a.m. between the Main Circle, Club 23, Bridget's, Commons and Campus View. The pro­gram also ran in only one di­rection-from the bars to the campus. "People couldn't use It to go from campus to the bars,"

A native of South Africa edu­cated at the University of Cape Town, O'Meara received his Ph.D from Princeton University in 1953 and 1957-1962 served on the Princeton faculty and the Institute for Advanced Study. 
O'Meara joined Notre Dame's department of mathematics in 1962 and has written three books on mathematics at the graduate research level. He and fellow NO professor of mathematics Alex Hahn re­cently published a new book which is considered the refer­ence standard of its fleld. 
As chairman of a special Uni­versity committee on Priorities and Commitments for Excel­lence (PACE), O'Meara led a two-year evaluation of Notre Dame's educational mission that designed a plan of aca­demic strides that the Univer­sity has taken in the past eight years.

Profs claim Thomas n·ot qualified 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Four black Jaw professors argued Tuesday that Clarence Thomas' conservative views disqualified him for the Supreme Court but other witnesses defended him, including his eighth-grade teacher, who said Thomas had "not forgotten his roots." 
Thomas' character and back­ground were highlighted at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings by friends and sup­porters, notably a Roman Catholic nun who was his eighth-grade teacher in Savan­nah, Ga. 
Sister Mary Virgilius Reidy said, "lie lived day by day. the cruel story of discrimination. He knows the results of being on the wrong side of the law not because of what one has done, or not done, but because of the color of one's skin." 
The panel is expected to vote within two weeks on Thomas' nomination to be the nation's second black Supreme Court justice. Both sides say that Thomas Is heading toward Se­nate confirmation to succeed the flrst black, Thurgood Mar­shall. 
The panel could vote as early as Sept. 26. The four professors, from 
Harvard, Yale, Stanford and Georgetown, said that despite Thomas' rise from poverty, the views he espoused as a "foot soldier" in the Heagan adminis­tration raise questions about what kind of justice he would make. 
"This has been a very difficult situation for African-Ameri­cans, said Yale professor Drew Days of Yale, who headed the Justice Department's civil rights division in the Carter administration.. 
"It would give me great pride to see another African-Ameri­can on the Supreme Court," but, Days said, "I want to see something below the skin, be­neath the skin, that convinces me that person will be a voice and a vote for the people who are voiceless and voteless on the Supreme Court." 
The argument that Thomas' rise from poverty would make him more sensitive to human rights "is just simply too ro­mantic," said Christopher Edley of Harvard. ''I'd like to believe in the power of redemption but I'd like to see some evidence." 
"Background and character are not a substitute for a con­stitutional vision," Edley said. During Thomas' five days of testimony, "I saw no indication he has a framework of ap­proaching constitutional issues. I saw artful ways of evading the questions." 
Charles Lawrence of Stanford said Thomas was nominated because "he has demonstrated his loyalty as an administration foot soldier. He has been an eager spokesperson for the agenda of the radical right." 
~·In always striving to please those who have been his bene­factors, has he lost himself?" Lawrence said. 
"Thomas has been able to dream and to reach for his dreams; yet he has ignored the need for or worked to deny that choit;e to others," said Patricia King of Georgetown. 
John Gibbons, former chief judge of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadel­phia, called Thomas "intellectually gifted, open­minded and not doctrinaire." 
Gibbons and Sister Virgilius both disagreed with suggestions that Thomas was less than candid when he said the views he had expressed as a Reagan administration official would not shape his judicial thinking. 
"I do not in one instant mistrust his honesty, knowing Thomas from a child," the nun told lawmakers.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Rumors spread like wild fire at ND/SMC 
First there was slasher, a razor blade­wielding maniac with designs on females at Saint Mary's. 
Then . it was gang initiation week. The story line said that to be 
inducted into one of South Monica Yant 
Bend's finest gangs, local News Editor thugs were required to slash a Notre Dame male ------­and rape a Saint Mary's female. 
Now the talk is of a different nature, of an attempted administrative thwarting of security issues at Saint Mary's. 
Though the stories have changed, one thing remains the same: they are all rumors that are spreading like wildfire across both campuses. 
Rumors are a curious breed. They seem to generate spontaneously, yet once started they infect virtually everyone they touch. They often become so embellished that by the time the story has returned to its origin, even the storyteller does not recognize the tale. 
Such was the case with the recent wave of rumors about gang initiation week in South Bend that sounds like a fraternity rush ex­perience gone awry. Some versions have th~ gang members raping and killing students, while others have them cutting off limbs for physical proof of their conquest. 
The gang rumor even made its way to hall meetings and stall notes, alarming RAs and scaring students. 
This should never have happened, accord­ing to Chuck Hurley, assistant director of Security. A simple phone call to Security or the police would have confirmed that the rumors are false, and saved a lot of people a lot of worrying. 
A second wave of rumors has hit the Saint Mary's campus of late, seemingly related to the two attacks on Saint Mary's students last week. When the College did not receive copies of The Observer last Wednesday, rumors spread that the mishap was really the work of Saint Mary's administrators who stopped delivery because they did not want students to read about the attacks. 
Even with a clarification from Observer editors about the mishap, (which was in fact a circulation error and in no way the product of administrative tampering) the rumors are still flying, much to the dismay of Brett McLaughlin, public information officer of College Communications. 
"It makes me wonder, 'What can people be thinking?'" he said. "Do they really want to believe these things?" 
They must, for McLaughlin said he is still hearing talk of the "Uttle B.o Peep" killer, one of last year's stellar rumors. 
And then there are the rumors about a sup­posed murder of a Saint Mary's student in her room last year. McLauglin said he's received calls from frantic parents who have heard "from reputable sources" about the murder and how they heard the victim was dis­covered when "blood came gushing from under the door." 
For Hurley and McLaughlin, these vicious rumor mills mean trouble-and possibly panic. Their advice? Resist the temptation, and maybe the rumor can be killed before "the slasher" kills those who spread it.

Kaifu retracts remark about U.S. 

 TOKYO -Prime Minister Toshikl Kaifu today retracted a remark he made last week about the ethics of U.S. politicians. Kaifu said today that he regretted the remark and hoped the U.S. would understand he had not meant to say U.S. politicians were unethical. He said he had meant to say that the U. S. did not have the same limitations on campaign spending as Japan. A political blunder could hurt Kaifu because several senior leaders in the Liberal Democratic Party are vying for his position as his term expires next month. His close associations with President Bush have been considered his political strong point, and any damage to Kaifu's image in Washington could likewise weaken his position in Japan.

Power shifts in Middle East says Gaffney 

By ELIZABETH COSTELLO 
News Wnter 
The balance of power has now shifted in the Middle East and the new king is the United States, according to Father Patrick Gaffney. 
In a lecture on the Arab World in the aftermath of the Kuwait crisis, Gaffney said that Israel is now second in power, followed by Turkey, which un­expectedly emerged and has geopolitical links to the West and East. 
Gaffney has travelled exten­sively and done research in the Middle East. This summer he spent six weeks in the Arab World studying the effects of the Gulf War. 
Gaffney, an Institute for In­ternational Peace Studies fac­ulty fellow and associate pro­fessor in the department of an­thropology, said there were dif­ferent types of conflicts in the Arab World, Including clashes in Palestine, Lebanon and terri­tory around the Red Sea. 
Egypt may be the largest country, but "they are not the king of the hlll," he said, be­cause Saudi Arabian and Le­banese power blocks stopped former Egyptian President Nasser from rising to power years ago. 
Inspired by the Nasservist Revolution, Gaffney said Iraq also wanted to dominate the Arab World. 
Gaffney discussed several attempts at peace in the Middle East that have failed in recent years. 
In 1989, at the end of the Iraq-Iran War, an Arab Coop­eration Council was held to unify the Arab world. In addi­spect of many regional people. Gaffney added that the United States made an error in not ousting him before the war's end, but that Saddam could lose power any time. 

Gaffney showed several slides of some pictures he and a friend took while in the Middle East. Gaffney emphasized that there was not total destruction in Kuwait and that one had to

Gaffney also showed pictures or the black clouds of smoke and roaring flames that are ecologically damaging to Kuwait and to the rest of the world. There were approxi­mately 700 oil wells torched by the Iraqis and only about half have been capped, he said. 
He said that "little structural damage was done in Kuwait." There was, however, great looting and pillage, so buildings were in need of restocking. 
To illustrate the dangers of disguised hand grenades and bombs planted by Iraqis to kill their enemies during the war, Gaffney presented a picture of a poster in a Kuwaiti airport warning visitors: "Attention brothers of our nation: don't become another victim of Sad­dam."

Special to The Observer 
The former Non-varsity Ath­letics (NVA} program at the University of Notre Dame now will be known as RecSports, or Office of Recreational Sports, according to assistant athletic director Tom Kelly. 
Once limited to intramural and club sports, the program now offers a wide variety of sporting and fitness activities for Notre Dame students, fac­uJty and staff. 
"Our new name Is reflective of a more broad-based program !hat has been built up over the last few years, with particular emphasis on recreational activities," said Kelly, who directs the RecSports programs. u About 80 percent of our student body is involvelj in some sort of formal recreational program, and that number goes to 90 percent if you include those who work out on their own." 
RecSports offers 10 competi­tive club teams and more than 40 recreational services such as courses, clinics and fitness programs. About 50 percent of the student body participates in Intram urals. 
NVA was established in 1976 and placed under the jurisdic­tion or the athletic department. Before that time, the depart­ment was known as lntrahall and offered just intramural and club sports.

Earthquake hits central California 
SAN SIMEON, Calif. (AP) -An earthquake shook the central California coast on Tuesday, startling visitors at the famed Hearst Castle and others in the sparsely populated area with a sharp jolt. 
There were no reports of damage or injuries in the tem­blor, which registered 5.1 on the Richter scale, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. 
The quake struck at 2:10 

p.m. and was felt over a wide area, said USGS spokeswoman Pat Jorgenson. 
The quake was centered in a remote area 14 miles northwest of San Simeon, home to Hearst Castle, the seaside mansion built by newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst and now a state park. It is about 170 miles south of San Francisco. 
"It rolled in and then there was a jolt and then it rolled away, three seconds, four sec­onds. Short and sharp. No damage. It was a little too quick for people to react," said Bill Payne, a state park ranger at Hearst Castle. 
The quake was felt hundreds of miles away, as far south as San Luis Obispo and as far north as the outskirts of San Francisco.

Battle reaches Zagreb regardless of cease-fire 
ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) ­Shell bursts and the rattle of anti-aircraft fire rocked Zagreb late Tuesday in the first major fighting in the Croatian capital, an outbreak that seemed likely to doom a cease-fire agreement signed hours before. 
Federal Air Force jets swooped out of the clear night sky to blizz the city center and were greeted by dense orange flashes of flak. Officials said an air raid warning was in effect for the entire battle-scarred republic of Croatia. An all-clear was given .early Wednesday. 
Zagreb civil defense officials said five people were wounded in the fighting and that two schools, a textile factory, a pri­vate home and an apartment block were damaged. 
Air attacks damaged Zagreb's radio and TV transmission tower, north of the city, and damaged the airport and police station in the southern suburb of Lucko, civil defense authorities said. 
Jets also attacked the town of Gospic, south of Zagreb near the Adriatic coast, Croatian of­ficials said, and news reports said other towns were also un­der attack. 
It was by far the worst vio­lence to hit Zagreb in the 2 1/2 months of fighting that has left more than 450 dead in Croatia, including 34 killed Tuesday. 
fellows from educational and science administration include former Smith College president Jill Ker Conway; National The violence left in doubt the fate of a European Community­brokered cease-fire, signed earlier in the day in a coastal city in the republic of Montene­gro. 
Zagreb, with 1.2 million in­habitants, is Yugoslavia's sec­ond-biggest city, the largest being Belgrade, the federal and Serbian capital. 
Whether the latest fighting was intended to sabotage the cease-fire-or as a last bloody blow by one of the parties in­volved-could not immediately be determined, as it was impos­sible to determine who started the firing. 
Within an hour of the agree­ment, gunfire broke out be­tween Croatian forces and fed­eral troops at the Dusan Corkovic barracks on Zagreb's east side. As dusk fell, tracers fired from the barracks could be seen over the housing blocks of the Lascina and Boronogaj districts. 
Later in the night, Air Force jets flew over the city and in­tense shelling lasted for about 30 minutes, interspersed with heavy machine-gun and sniper fire audible in the city center from all directions. 
Zagreb was nearly completely darkened as a precaution against a\r raids. Public trans­portation was halted, and city officials told residents to go to shelter and remain calm.

Freight trains collide killing one 
KNOX, Ind. (AP) -Two freight trains collided head-on and caught lire Tuesday, killing a locomotive engineer and criti­cally injuring a crewman, au­thorities said. Fumes from burning sulfur forced about 100 evacuations. 
It took firelighters more than six hours to lind the engineer's body. A survivor was found trapped under wreckage nearly four hours after the crash. 
"It's amazing how he was able to survive as long as he did," said State Police Sgt. Jerry Parker..."He was surrounded by flames. 
The crewman was in fair condition at Parkview Hospital in Fort Wayne. 
Four other railroad employ­ees suffered minor injuries, and five firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation and heat exhaustion. 
The Norfolk Southern trains collided in a rural area about 40 miles southwest of South Bend when the eastbound train failed to change tracks, said Kelly Stemnock of the State Emergency Management Agency. 
"Somewhere along the line, there must have beeljl a switch­ing problem someplace because these trains both ended up on the same track going in oppo­site directions," Parker said. 
The circumstances of the crash were under investigation. Four engines and five cars derailed, said Bob Auman, a spokesman at Norfolk Southern in Roanoke, Va. 
Fire erupted in the eastbound train's three engines and one of its 95 tank cars carrying sulfur, as well as in the westbound train's engine and one of its seven cars, Auman said.

UN General Assembly welcomes its members 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -The General Assembly, its influence enhanced by tumultuous change from Moscow to the Middle East, convened its 46th session on Tuesday. It picked Saudi Arabia's Palestinian-born envoy as its president and welcomed seven nations earlier barred by Cold War politics. 
The assembly accepted the three newly independent Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as North and South Korea, the Marshall Is­lands and Micronesia. With their membership, the world body's size increased to 166 members. 
The Baltics, active members of the League of Nations, were seated with applause to signify their rejoining the family of nations after 51 years of domi­nation by the Soviet Union. All seven new members were seated by acclamation. 
Resolutions of the General Assembly, a kind of interna­tional parliament, are not le­gally binding, like those of the Security Council. 
But its decisions carry weight as expressions of world opinion. Also, the United Nations' new clout in the wake of its key role in the Persian Gulf War provides new opportunities for international cooperation and the settling of disputes. 
Soon after convening; the assembly elected the Saudi U.N. envoy, Samir Shihabi, 66, as its president. The post is largely ceremonial, but the president has the power to arrange the agenda and schedule or post­pone debates, sometimes defus­ing acrimonious issues. 
Addressing the assembly, Shihabi raised one of those is­sues, referring to "the tragedy of Palestine." 
"The United Nations is committed to full realization of Palestinian rights in accordance with U.N. resolutions, the U.N. Charter and desire of the international community," said Shihabi, who was born in 
Jerusalem into a  Palestinian  
family.  
But he touched  on  broader  

themes as well, Including the collapse of Soviet Communism and the new era in East-West ties. 
Wearing a black gold-bor­dered Arab robe and a white Arab headdress, Shiabi said sweeping political changes around the world had increased the effectiveness of the United Nations in mediating disputes. 
"We are witnessing a great relaxation in international rela­tions between the United States and the Soviet Union and the positive transformation in most states' attitudes, substituting a policy of cooperation In place of confrontation," Shihabi told the assembly. He spoke in Arabic. 
Shihabi, Saudi Arabia's U.N. envoy for eight years, won 83 votes to 4 7 for Papua New Guinea's foreign minister, Michael Somare, and 20 for Ambassador Abdalla Saleh al­Ashtal of Yemen. 
Of the seven new members, Shihabi said they would "enrich the United Nations and increase the universality of this organization."

Cocaine babies increase hospital costs 
CHICAGO (AP)-Cocaine ba­hies are running up excess hos­pital costs of more than $500 million a year, a benchmark for how much money could be saved by helping expectant mothers get ofT or stay ofT co­caine, researchers say. 
Babies exposed to the drug while in the womb required hospitalizations that averaged four days longer and $2,610 more than non-cocaine babies in a study of hundreds of New York newborns, the re­
searchers said. The cocaine-exposed infants were 50 percent more likely
than unexposed babies to re­quire intensive care and more than twice as likely to have a very low birth weight, the re­searchers said. The team was led by Ciai:'an Phibbs, a health economist who directed the re­search while at Columbia Uni­versity School of Public Health in New York and at the Univer­
sity of California, San Fran­cisco. 
A recent·study indicates that cocaine-exposed babies require more care at birth than unexposed infants, resulting in longer hospital stays and larger hospital bills. Here is the average amount of additional hospital costs and additional length of stay for cocaine babies in three scenarios: 
FETAL EXPOSURE 
Any cocaine: Additional costs+ $2,610 Additional stay + 4.0 days 
Multiple drug: Additional costs+ $8,450 
Additional stay + 1 0·0 days Cocaine only: Additional costs+ $1,283 Additional stay+ 2.7 days 
Crack: 
Additional costs+ $6,735 
Additional stay+ 7.5 days 
Other forms of cocaine: 
Additional costs+ $1,226 
Additional stay + 2.9 days

Research done by Chasnoff indicates women who stop tak­ing drugs before their second trimester of pregnancy are at-most as likely to have healthy
babies as women who don't use drugs. 
"Three days in the neonatal intensive care unit is going to make up for that (cost) right there," ChasnofT said. "I don't think there is any question that 
if you can provide these ser­vices early on, you're going to \save enormous amounts of 
money later." Yet only about 10,000 drug abuse-treatment slots exist for the estimated 250,000 pregnant women who could benefit from them, said Chaspoff, citing a study two 
years ago by the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors.

Gates admits to misjudging Soviets while CIA analyst 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Robert Gates, under intense Senate questioning of his qualifications to head the CIA, conceded Tuesday that as an agency ana­lyst he had focused on the So­viet Union's threat to the out­side world and not the "unthinkable" changes perco­
lating among its people. 
On the second day of his con­firmation hearings before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Gates also came in for renewed grilling from Democrats critical of his actions at the time of the 1985-86 diversion of money from Iran arms sales to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. 
However, many of the panel's 15 members appeared to have been disarmed by Gates' 
orrection

"What has happened, hap­pened. And you admitted you made mistakes, and I admire that," said Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz. 
Republicans sought to stress Gates' abilities as an analyst ­the metier that propelled him through CIA and White House ranks to be nominated to the top intelligence post at the age of47. 
"There's a very strong record of your acting aggressively" at the CIA, suggested Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo. 
In response, Gates described a record that brought him into

On the Soviet Union, Gates conceded, his record was im­perfect. 
For instance, he said he had publicly disagreed with a CIA analysis that the Soviets would undertake unilateral cuts in their defense spending. "I was wrong," he said. 
When asked about a 1986 speech he had made saying the Soviets would test a ground­based anti-missile laser defense system by the end of the 1980s, Gates also conceded error but defended himself by saying he had drawn from various expert opinions. 
He rejected suggestions from Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., that he had tailored his assessment in order to justify U.S. defense spending by sounding a false alarm about a Soviet buildup_ But "I may have erred on the side of focusing on the con­cerns," Gates said. 
When reminded by Bradley that in 1986 he had rejected any suggestions that change was brewing in the Soviet Union, Gates responded: "We have all learned some impor­tant lessons ... in terms of thinking the unthinkable." 
Bradley also suggested that 
U.S. intelligence sharing with Iraq between 1985 and 1988, while Gates served in top intel­ligence posts, violated U.S. law. Gates disagreed and the subject will be addressed again in a closed-door session planned for Friday.

Mexico allows torture, says Amnesty International 
MEXICO CITY (AP) -Anyone arrested in Mexico runs the risk of being tortured, Amnesty International said Tuesday in a report accusing the government of tolerating police human rights abuses. 
Hit's time for the United States government and the In­ternational community to stop turning a blind eye to the fla­grant human rights abuses committed by the Mexican gov­ernment," John Healey, execu­tive director of the London­based monitoring group said in a statement. 
Amnesty said It has had hun­dreds of reports of torture in the last two years, Including some In which the victims died. 
"This terrible pattern of vlo­lations clearly contradicts the government's repeatedly stressed commitment to human rights," it said. 
The Amnesty report marked the second time in the last few days that a prominent interna­tional human rights organiza­tion accused the Mexican gov­ernment of doing little more than paying lip service to hu­man rights. 
"Human rights violations in Mexico will not stop until the institutions of abuse are dis­mantled," America's Watch said last week in an update to a 1990 report, which singled out federal police as some of the worst abusers. 
Neither the president's office nor the attorney general's office had any immediate comment. 

Last week, Attorney General Ignacio Morales Lechuga defended President Carlos Sali­nas Gortari's administration at a news conference llJtended by Secretary of State James Baker. 
"There is change," he said when asked about the Americas Watch report. "There is re­form." 
The attorney general's office cited an update on several no­torious human rights cases re­leased Monday by Assi.stant At­torney General Federico Ponce Rojas. 
Rojas said the attorney gen­eral was "acting with energy, efficiency and within the mark of the law and the constitution." 
Amnesty International, America's Watch and a host of Mexican human rights groups disagree. 
"Complaints of torture are rarely investigated by the courts and torturers almost never brought to justice," Amnesty said. 
It said people are beaten, subjected to electric shocks and mock executions, immersed in water, nearly asphyxiated with plastic bags and have mineral water mixed with chili powder forced up their noses. Some die, it said. 
"Torture victims in Mexico come from a wide range of backgrounds," it said. "They include people detained for political reasons or in the con­text of land disputes, human rights and indigenous activists, trade unionists, lawyers and criminal suspects." 
Amnesty said even children run the risk of torture after being picked up by police or soldiers. Those who complain run the risk of "harassment, Intimidation and in some cases abduction and torture." 
It cited one case in which a small town mayor was beaten and jailed for seven months for trying to complain about abuses committed by drug agents during a raid. Agullilla Mayor Salomon Mendoza Barajas was finally freed In December. 
In another case, crusading newspaper columnist Victor Manuel Oropeza was murdered in July in Ciudad Juarez, on the Texas-Mexico border. Oro'peza had received death threats for writing articles on rights abuses.

Congress approves bill Shuttle heads home in darkness 
to benefit unemployed 
WASHINGTON (AJ>) -The !louse disregarded a White I louse veto threat Tuesday and overwhelmingly passed Demo­cratic legislation that would give 3 million long-term jobless Americans up to 20 extra weeks of unemployment bene­til.,. 
The lawmakers sent the $6.4 billion measure to the Senate on a vote of 283-125, with the support of nearly one-third of voting House Republicans. Top Democrats predicted they would have enough votes to override a veto by Bush. 
"The administration Is ignor­Ing people with mouths to feed, and they're serving them a bunch of baloney," said House Whip David Bonlor, D-Mich. 
If all 433 House members participate in a vote to try to override, 289 votes would be needed to enact the measure over Bush's objections. A two­thirds Senate majority would then also be needed. 
Voting for the bill were 234 Democrats, 48 Republicans and one independent. Eighteen Democrats and 107 Republi­cans voted against it. 
Democrats embraced the measure as a lifeline for the 300,000 workers who each month use up the standard 26 weeks of unemployment com­pensation and remain jobless. They accused Bush of being in­sensitive to Americans suffering during the recession. 
Administration officials have argued the measure should be rejected because the recession has not been as serious as past downturns and is ending any­way. They have also said the bill would Increase the federal deficit. 
"We have a veto threat on it, yes," said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. 
Meanwhile, 27 Democratic governors wrote the president urging him to sign the bill into law. 
'These Americans have been looking for work for at least half a year and they need more help," the governors wrote of the nation's long-term unem­p ed. "T need help, be-

cause the economy is not gen­
erating enough jobs." 
Gov. William Donald Schaefer 
of Maryland was the only 
Democratic governor to not 
sign. 
House GOP leaders said they believed the measure would ul­timately be changed and gain the support of Bush and most lawmakers. Whip Newt Gin­grich, R-Ga., said such changes could involve including some of the Republican tax proposals and making the bill's benefits temporary instead of perma­nent. 
But some Republicans who voted for the measure said they would do so again, even if It were not changed and Congress was trying to override a veto. 
"On this issue, I wouldn't give" it a second thought, because I felt so strongly about the equity issue here," said Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J. 
The House approved a similar bill on Aug. 2 by a 375-45 vote. The Senate sent it to Bush on a voice vote the same day. 
House Republicans, knowing Bush could kill that measure on his own, felt free to support it in greater numbers than they did Tuesday. 
Bush signed the measure Aug. 17 but then killed it by refusing to declare an emergency, as budget law requires. Congress therefore had no chance to override a veto. 
Under the new version, Bush's separate emergency declaration would not be needed. Thus, the president would have to veto the bill to stop it, and Congress would have a chance to override. 
In a last-ditch effort to thwart the new bill, Republicans tried to offer an administration­backed "economic growth" package Including a cut In the capital gains tax and tax credits for business. Democrats blocked a vote. 
"They don't want to see any kind of turnaround in this re­cession," Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., said of the Democrats. "They just want to give out these benefits ... {as they) get closer to an election " 


CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP} -Discovery's five astronauts packed away their gear Tues­day for the trip home, a spec­tacular, nighttime plunge over Canada, the Midwest and down into Florida. 
The space shuttle has never descended over so much of the United States in the dark. Dis­covery's glowing trail was ex­pected to be most vivid as the ship sped from the Canadian province of Saskatchewan to­ward Tennessee. 
Discovery was scheduled to land at 2:06 a.m. EDT Wednes­day at Kennedy Space Center. The weather outlook was good, despite the potential for patchy ground fog. 
"Of course, the weathermen keep reminding me. that the weather's kind of like investing: past performance is no guaran­tee on future results," said NASA flight director Jeff Bantle. 
It would be the first tim~ a shuttle has landed at Kennedy in the dark; the eight previous Florida touchdowns were dur­ing the day. Shuttles have landed four times in darkness at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., the alternative touch­down site Wednesday. 
About 20 minutes before landing, the shuttle was to race over parts of North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee. It would look like a slow shooting star with yellow and green streaks trailing it. 
Weather permitting, residents in such cities as Grand Forks, N.D., Minneapolis, Danville, Ill., Evansville, Ind., Bowling Green, Ky., and Nashville, Tenn., may have the chance to see the shut­tle overhead. 
The astronauts, who have been working night owl hours, awoke Tuesday afternoon to begin preparations for the trip home. 
An evening liftoff last Thurs­day was required for the pre­cisely timed release of an atmo­spheric observatory, and It put the shuttle on an approach path home in the early hours. 
Shuttle managers restored Kennedy's status as a primary landing site three months ago in an effort to save time and money. 
The 2.8-mlle runway was to be lit by a special bank of high­Intensity lights stationed at each end. City officials In Ti­tusville, across the Indian River, asked residents to turn on their porch lights as a goodwill gesture.

School may ban religious song 
ALEXANDRIA, Ind. (AP) ­The Alexandria Community S~hool Board Is expected to de­ctde next month whether stu­de~~s can ~lng "Jesus Loves Me dunng school, a spokesman said Tuesday. 
The board discussed in an ex­
ecutive session earlier this 
week a complaint filed by a 
mother whose young child had 
sung the religious song during a 
kindergarten music class at 
Orestes Elementary School. 
For more than two hours 
Monday night, parents were al­
lowed to voice their opinion on 
whether the religious tune is 
appropriate for the classroom. 
-Kathie Wilbur, who filed the complaint, said the issue has "been blown all out of propor­tion." 
Wilbur said she had asked Orestes Principal Michael Shaver how the schools "got

away with" singing religious songs in school. 
When Shaver didn't have an answer, Wilbur said she anonymously called the I~diana Civil Liberties Union. She later told Shaver the ICLU advised against singing the song in pub­lic schools. 
Two days later, the song was banned on the advice of school attorney Jeffrey Lockwood and the Indiana School Board Asso­ciation. 
Superintendent Jack Bowers said recommended to the school board that the song be banned because he was concerned that Mrs. Wilbur might take legal action. 
 "The complainant had con­tacted the ICLU, and that was an indication, I would think, that there was pretty serious concern," Bowers said Tuesday. 
Wilbur said she never in­tended to take legal action. 
"l think it's been blown all out of proportion," she said. "My husband's been called anti­Christ and I've been called an atheist. This is not true." 
Bowers said parents attend­ing the meeting Monday night were allowed to offer their opinions on the issue, but It was not on the board's agenda. He said he believed the board probably would take some ac­tion at its next meeting, Oct. 7. It could either ban the song or not take any action. 
Some parents were incensed that the song might be banned for good. 
"There are a lot of born-again Christians who are taxpayers," said Richard Hardest. "We object to Halloween being observed in the schools because it's contrary to scriptural teaching. I wonder if the ICLU would take m case."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Dear Editor: 
I do not understand the atti­tude that Molly O'Neill, presi­dent of Lewis Hall, takes to­ward Michael Yore's memoran­dum seeking support from hall presidents for the homosexuals at Notre Dame (The Observer, Sept. 11). On the one hand, Lewis claims she "did not feel that Lewis's Hall Council was 
' obligated to address the memo," since Yore sent it in a private capacity "as one student to another." On the other, she evidently has no reservations about attacking both the memo and its writer in as public a forum as The Observer. First, O'Neill blatantly ac­cuses Yore of using the Hall President's Council "as a way to get around Student Affairs." On the contrary, Yore and others have tried for years to get Stu­dent Affairs to acknowledge the need for a lesbian and gay sup­port system at Notre Dame. However, the office has persistently blocked-worse, actively hindered-their efforts. When the administration has proved so willfully unreasonable, Yore is more than justified in turning to hall presidents and seeking their help in providing a supportive atmosphere to lesbians and gay men. To imply that he is being underhanded is to ignore the facts. O'Neill also questions whether the resolution Yore proposes would achieve his ob­jectives. Since she hasn't given

it a chance, I don't see how she plans on fmding out. In any case, by her logic, one might argue that since our statures against homicide haven't succeeded in eradicating murder, perhaps we ought to repeal them. 
O'Neill goes on to ask why hall councils should single out a specific minority group, les­bians and gays, and affirm their rights. As an Asian on an overwhelmingly white campus, I applaud O'Neill's consideration for other minority groups. Rather than shoot down Yore's proposal, then, why doesn't she expand or supplement it to cover the others she is so concerned about? 
O'Neill's final objection, that Yore doesn't give "concrete ex­amples" of the fear with which homosexuals live, is simply lu­dicrous. I should have thought that the examples are so pal­pable all around us that it was utterly unnecessary to set them down in print. 
And speaking of setting things down in print, I wonder why The Observer devoted so much space to O'Neill's reasons for not even considering Yore's proposal, and none at all to those of Amy Listerman and the Siegfried Hall Council for adopting it by unanimous con­sent.

Rouault's spiritually inspired works on display 
By PAIGE SMORON Assistant Accent Editor 
It's bleak. It's dark. It's ugly. 
It's a direct confrontation with isolationism, suffering, and corruption. The art of Georges Rouault is not to be taken lightly. 
Starting this week, the Notre Dame community will be able to view a selection of Rouault's graphic works at the Snite Museum. The featured series, "Miserere," is Rouault's inter­pretation of man's inhumanity to man. 
"These prints evoke a feeling of suffering that is in sync with a lot of what is happening today in Russia, Yugoslavia, and South Africa," said John Shields, the Snite's education coordinator. "Even though they were created after World War I and before the Depression, this art is still very

Rouault then studied with the symbolist painter Gustave Moreau, who was known for his exotic themes and erotic views of religion -Salome dancing was a favorite subject. 
From Moreau, Rouault learned artistic mediums and arrangement of composition. And like Mcireau, Rouault tack­led religious subjects, but with a very different intention. Strongly committed to the Catholic revival movement in France, Rouault's art is very spiritual. 
Learning from the masters, like Goya, Daumier, and Van Gogh, Rouault eventually be­came a contemporary of Matisse and of the Fauve genre. Also called the "Wild Beast" movement, these artists were characterized by their shock­ingly vivid use of colors: oranges, blues, purples. 
As his style evolved, Rouault became known for his familiar subjects. He painted many clowns, seeing them as a symbol of universal suffering. One of the etchings on display at the Snite, "Who Does Not Paint Himself a Face?" is fairly representative of the theme that everyone hides

their own pain. 
Another motif of Rouault's was the prostitute. Devoid of any eroticism, Rouault drew a very bloated and decadent portrait of these women whom he saw as products of a corrupt society. Likewise, his distorted versions of judges summon up the cruelty and hypocrisy in society. 
To the point of being bluntly judgmental, Rouault often used titles to clarify any subtleties in his artwork. One etching, titled in explanation, "The Society Lady Fancies She has a Reserved Seat for Heaven," portrays a'· smug, aristocratic woman in his cynical attack on her religious insincerity. 
There is an overriding feeling of isolationism in most of his prints. In "Beneath a Forgotten Crucifix," Christ is portrayed alone, deserted by everyone, in­cluding Mary. The bleak portrait seems to ask, has Christ died in vain? 
According to Shields, Catholic writers of the time supported the content and message of Rouault's work, but were uncomfortable with its visual qualities. "They didn't think religion should be ugly," said Shields. 

At the same time, there are shades of hope in some of Rouault's prints. One work is entitled, "In These Dark Times of Vain Glory and Unbelief, Our Lady of the Ends of the Earth Keeps Watch," and the dramatic contrast between white and black heightens emotions. 
"He was a very serious social commentator," said .Shields. "He had a strong sympathy, a compassion for the poor." 
Rouault himself was more of a mystery. "In my research, I have been unable to find out any particulars concerning his personal life," said Shields. While it is known that Rouault was married with children, Shields points out that it is noteworthy that with all his re­ligious topics, portraits of the Holy Family are conspicuously missing. 
This collection is owlrled by the Snite Museum, and is one of 450 sets. Rouault preferred to work on hundreds of pieces at once, and as a result, it would tah him typically ten years to complete a painting or etching. Each time he would go back to a piece to work, he would add more layers of paint or etching, which would build up over the years into a harsh, vivid work of art. 
"This series is an excellent sampling of what Rouault is famous for," said Shields, who will be presenting a "Noontalk," an informal walk through the gallery, on October 29 at 12:10 until 12:55 p.m. There is no charge for the informal tour, entitled "Georges Rouault: Outlined in Black," and Shields will be discussing Rouault's life as well as particular works on display. 
Everyone is invited to attend this informative session, or simply to view the works. "These prints should appeal to everybody," said Shields. "In particular, anybody studying theology, social work, or anyone with a social conscience would gain a great deal of insight from Rouault." 
These prints will be on display in the Print, Drawing, and Photography Gallery of the Snite until December 29. The museum is open Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. until 4 p.m., 
and is open until  8 p.m.  on  
Thursdays  for  students'  
convenience.  
Rouault's  dramatic  

Expressionist art is an effective medium for conveying his con­cern with faith, hypocrisy, cru­elty, and humanity. 
"These problems have not disappeared," said Shields. "There is an allegory for human suffering here, a global consciousness."

Pirates rip Cubs; magic number is 8 
PITTSBUHGII (AP) -Barry Bonds homered and became the eighth Pittsburgh player to have consecutive 100-RBI seasons as the Pirates beat the Chicago Cubs 9-2 Tuesday night, reducing their magic number for clinching the NL East to eight. 
Stove Buechele added a double, a two-run triple and a sacrifice fly as the Pirates won for the fifth time in seven games. 
Doug Drabek (14-13) ended a personal two-game losing streak and took a shutout into the eighth inning. 
Phlllles 4, cardinals 2 
PHILADELPHIA -Cliff Brantley pitched seven strong innings for his first major­league victory as Philadelphia defeated St. Louis. 
Brantley (1-1), making only his second big-league start, allowed two runs, six hits, struck out two and walked two. Mitch Williams pitched two innings for his 28th save. 

Red Sox 4, Orioles 3 
BOSTON -The Boston Red 
Sox won and lost Tuesday 
night. 

Jack Clark's wind-blown 
home run broke a sixth-inning 
tie and Jeff Reardon protected 
the lead for his 40th save as the 
Red Sox beat the Baltimore 
Orioles 4-3. 
But the victory was tempered by the possible loss of Mike Greenwell for the rest of the season. 
"It doesn't look good," Boston manager Joe Morgan said after Greenwell sustained a pulled right groin muscle and a possible torn cartilage in his right knee. 
The Red Sox, who had lost four of five to Baltimore at Fenway Park, won for the 11th time in 14 games. 
Glenn Davis hit a two-run homer in the first inning and Leo Gomez connected in the second, putting Baltimore ahead 3-0. But rookie Kevin Morton (6-3) settled down and left after the sixth with the score tied at 3. 
Clark hit the first pitch in the bottom of the sixth to right. The opposite-field fly got caught in a crosswind and landed in the seats, just out of Dwight Evans' reach near the 302-foot mark, for Clark's 23rd home run. 
White Sox 1, A's 0 
CHICAGO -Bo Jackson's solo shot in the seventh inning off Ron Darling was all Chicago needed in defeating Oakland and pulling within seven games of AL West leading Minnesota.

Dawson withdraws appeal, serves one-day suspension 
NEW YORK (AP) -Andre Dawson of the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday withdrew his appeal of a one-day suspension, levied last month in an umpire-humping, hat­throwing incident in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. 
The suspension was held in abeyance during the appeal period, and the National League said Tuesday that Dawson would serve it during that night's game at Pittsburgh. 
Dawson bumped umpire Joe West after disputing a called third strike in a game on July 23 and later threw bats out of the dugout. He was suspended for "incidental contact with the umpire and Inciting the crowd" and immediately appealed. 
The incident took place in the same game in which Cincinnati reliever Rob Dibble was fined for throwing a ball at Doug Dascenzo of Chicago as he ran to first base after a suicide squeeze hunt. 
The two incidents apparently were unrelated. 

Other Jose doing just fine as part of Cardinals' revival 
ST. LOUIS (AP) -When the St. Louis Cardinals traded National League hatting cham­pion Willie McGee last season, they had no idea they might be getting one in return. 
With a couple of weeks to go, Felix Jose is in the hunt. He's fourth in the batting race with 
a .312 average, 13 points be­hind leader Hal Morris of Cincinnati, only five points be­hind runner-up Tony Gwynn of San Diego and a point ahead of McGee, now with San Francisco. 
"He's a slasher like Willie," manager Joe Torre said. 
Gwynn, who has won four hatting titles, will be a specta­tor the rest of the season after 
~ . .. ~.,. ...... f ................. . 
undergoing arthroscopic surgery to repair cartilage damage to his left knee. 
If Jose can win the batting ti­tle, it would be the first time players traded for each other won titles in consecutive sea­sons. But he doesn't want to talk about the numbers game. 

"I don't even think about It," he said. "I never want to think about winning the hatting title. The only thing I want to try to do is hit .300. That's what I've been working on every day." 
When the Cardinals acquired Jose and minor-league third baseman Stan Royer for McGee in August 1990, Torre thought he'd be getting a player capable of hitting 30 home runs instead of a .300 hitter. Jose looks like a power hitter, but so far he's been another typical Cardinals player, hitting the ball into the gaps and using his speed. 
In many respects, he's been like a younger McGee. 
For instance, he has only six home runs, hut is second in the NL with 39 doubles and is sec­ond on the team with 67 RBis. 
"Every time I hit the ball it never takes off," Jose said. "I'm going to be working hard over the winter to try to find my home run swing. Right now ... it is too late for that. I forgot about that a long time ago." 
He's also a free swinger like McGee, sometimes hacking at most anything within range, and has the ability to look awe­some or awful on consecutive pitches. But unlike McGee, with two strikes, his average is about .350. 
''I'd hate to rely on that for the rest of my career, getting to two strikes and then getting the hit," Torre said. "I don't think I'd have won a hatting title do­ing that." 
Torre is trying to work with Jose and other young players on concentrating on a hitting zone and looking for specific pitches. He said that kind of approach would greatly Im­prove Jose's home-run total. 
"Right now, he's just a free­wheeler," Torre said. "He just swings. The way you hit home runs is by getting ahead In the count, looking for something, and zeroing ln." 
To illustrate his point, Torre drew an imaginary rectangle that began above the knees and around the waist. That was his hitting zone. 
"A lot of times when you zone it, you don't know whether you hit a fastball or a breaking ball," Torre said. "Once It goes through that sort of window, you hack at it." 
Moving the fences in 10 feet at Busch Stadium between the power alleys next season also should help Jose's power num­bers.

Daly would add Thomas SPORlS BRIEFS

NEW YORK (AP) --Chuck Daly stopped over at the Spanish island of Majorca be­fore going on to Barcelona. There, he experienced the howling winds that he said con­tribute to such a high suicide rate. 
"So, I may never return if we don't win the gold medal," he said.

I ''I've tried to eliminate all

Quite frankly, so does the rest of the world, and that's because the United States will be using NBA players for the fll'st time in '92. The selection committee will announce the names of the NBA players who have been invited on Saturday. 
"Everybody talks about the pressure on the coach, but what about the players?" Daly said. "Remember, the coach doesn't get a gold medal." 
While he has not been part of the selection process, Daly said the team would consist of per­haps only one or two college players, and the rest of the

players on the 12-man squad would come from the NBA. 
Various published reports have tentatively identified the NBA Olympians as Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Larry Bird, David Robinson, Scottie Pippen and Chris Mullin. If an 11th NBA player is added, it could be Isiah Thomas. 
The one or two collegians probably would come from among Shaquille O'Neal, Alonzo Mourning or Christian Laettner. 
Daly said he would like to have Thomas from his own Pistons team, as well as Bill Laimbeer and Dennis Rodman, "but I don't think that'll be the case. There's no question, though, that Isiah is deserving." 
Daly took the Pistons to NBA championships in 1989 and '90 but likens this experience more to that of coaching in the All­Star Game. He said his team would be together about one week before the regional Olympic qualifying tournament in Portland next June 27-July 35, then again for a week be­fore the Olympics.

Harris, Packers still at an impasse 
GHEEN BAY, Wis. (AP) ­lloldout linebacker Tim llarris has lowered his demands for a new two-year contract by about $300,000, but his offer was re­jected by the Green Bay Packers, his agent said Tuesday. 
Agent Ulice Payne said I larris, the Packers' sack leader each of his live seasons in the NFL, was not optimistic about signing with the team and was trying a second time to arrange a trade. 
Rockne 
continued from page 20 
"If we can compliment our run­ning game with a good passing attack, we should be success­ful." 
In Its season opener, Fisher 
will attempt to avenge its only 
1990 regular-season loss when 
it faces Sorin. 
PANGBORN 

Hob Thomson begins his first year as coach of the Violence after starring for the team a year ago. He will armed with a high powered offense and a solid defense which should make his coaching debut a suc­cessful one. 
Pangborn features the big play capabilities of tailback Paul Zachlin and quarterback Justin Sage. Despite the obvi­ous talent of the Violence backfield, however, the team's offense success will depend on the play of star center Kropen Wickey and an improved offen­sive line. 
Pangborn's 5-2 defense will be headed by sophomore defen­sive end Nick Treala and 
His holdout entered its 65th day Tuesday. 
"It doesn't look good," Payne said. "We're.left with a trade, or sitting out the season and challenging any right the Packers have to his rights." 
Harris, an All-Pro in 1989 when he recorded 19 1/2 sacks, met with Packers negotiators Monday, offering to sign a two­year contract that would pay him about $1 million for 1991 and an undetermined amount in 1992, Payne said. 
linebacker Scott Kamenick. The maturation of the defensive line will be key if the Violence are to make waves this season. 
Despite the absence of a sin­gle senior from the Violence roster, Zachlin is optimistic about the teams chances. "If we play consistently, we should have a good team this year," he said. 
The Violence have a bye this Sunday. 
ST. EDWARDS 

St. Edward's will seek to im­prove on its 0-3-1 record from last year by building an offense centered around junior running back Jamie Bailey. 
Bailey will be asked to carry the load as a inexperienced of­fensive line develops. St. Ed's will search for balance in its of­fense with a control passing game, so-teams will be unable to key solely on Bailey. 
Defensively, St. Ed's will need to make drastic improvement over last year. The defense was onP of the most porous in the league and will need numerous players to step forward for the team to compete. 
The offer was down substan­tially from Harris' two-year, $2.8 million demand last week, but the team rejected it Monday and made no counter offer, Payne said. 
"He explained to them how he felt," Payne said. "He's disap­pointed that his five years with the Packers doesn't even get­him a counter otTer. Their cur­rent offer wasn't acceptable before, and it's not acceptable now." 
"We have had a hard time getting practice in, but despite that we are coming along of­fensively," said coach Kevin Huie. "Defensively we have some bigger guys this year, and that should help." 
SORIN 

Matt Tutler takes over for the 
departed Kevin Kramer as the 
coach of the Otters. He inherits 
one of the most talented teams 
in the league. 
Sorin returns all but two of its defensive starters from a defensive unit which allowed only 12 points in all of its regu­lar season games. The linebacker duo of AI Kozar and Sean Ryan will provide inside support while Mike Murphy and Mike Gebecki roam the outside. 
On offense the Otters will once again turn to Ryan to led them. The talented fullback, along with quarterback Sean Kelly and tailback Chris Estes, make up a formidable backfield which will terrorize defehses throughout the division. 
"We need to stay focused, and not get to confident," said Tutler. "We can't get caught looking ahead to the playoffs."

Syracuse investigation expanding its scope 
SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) ­Syracuse University's investigation into alleged wrongdoing in its basketball program has expanded beyond its original scope, accounting for a delay in the release of findings, a school spokesman said Tuesday. 
The Syracuse Post-Standard reported Tuesday that some former players, including Derrick Coleman and Billy Owens, have refused to answer questions, hampering university lawyers looking into possible NCAA violations. 
Syracuse spokesman Robert Hill refused to confirm or deny that some former players were not cooperating. He would only say that the investigation is continuing and that the lawyers are expected to report by late October or early November.

to see some walk-ons on the kickoff return team. I love walk-ons, and I miss having a lot of walk-ons. I think that they're the best thing for a football team. Rick Lozano, Chet Hollister, Robert Hughes and John Farren are all great walk-ons." 
Holtz also gave his team a passing grade for its test at Michigan Stadium. 
"For being 17 points down on the road, I thought that we did a good job of coming back," stated Holtz. "Rick Mirer really came to the forefront as quar­terback. He kept our offense in the game all by himself. Tony 
he had some outstanding catches. Our inability to run the
football hurt our cause as much 
as anything.
"Some people played very, very well. Demetrius DuBose played an outstanding football game, and so did Devon McDonald. I'm really pleased with the performances of Eric Jones and Bryant Young. There wasn't anybody that played re­ally bad. We made a lot of progress in that game, and we found out some things about this team that we did not know before."

playing time this season. Despite their inexperience, however, the freshmen have proven their ability to perform on the college level and they will continue to improve as the season progresses. 
With three games in the next five days, though, the freshmen will have to mature quickly if the Irish hope to be successful against some of the nation's top teams. 
Michigan State will be in town Friday night to continue the home stand, before 1990 NCAA finalist Evansville visits Alumni Field Sunday afternoon. 
Perennial powerhouse Indiana will round out the home stand next Thursday night at South Bend's School Field. 
"When you begin an investigation that starts with 43 allegations and you're exercising diligence, what you find is when you interview people it raises more issues," Hill said. "To some extent, there's a lot of exponential growth." 
The newspaper, which ex­posed the allegations in a series of stories last December, also quoted sources who said former player Erich Santifer refused to cooperate with in­vestigators. 
The investigators have also been unable to reach former player Rodney Walker, who told the Post-Standard that Syracuse coaches arranged to have one of his grades changed to make him eligible to play in a key Big East Conference game, the sources said. 
with the Wolverines. 
Justin Hall is in the infrrmary with a minor injury, and is ex­pected to be lost from practice for one to two days. In the event that Hall is not healthy by Saturday, Todd Norman will take his place. 
Mirer who has been classified as "bruised up" and did not practice Monday, is nonetheless predicted to start against Michigan State. Derek Brown, however, has been diagnosed with turf toe, apparently the result of a tumbling catch he made at Michigan. BroV!_n should return to practice by Thursday.

Paterno blames fumbles for loss 
STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP)­Those blitzing Southern Cal linebackers that blew past the Penn State offensive line weren't the main culprits in the Nittany Lions' 21-10 loss to the Trojans, coach Joe Paterno said Tuesday. 
Paterno laid the blame on his own team, which suffered from a serious case of fumble-itis for the third week in a row. 
"I don't think you can let it take care of itself," Paterno said. His team dropped the ball nine times, losing it twice. The Lions have fumbled 16 times this season. 
"You have to lay the law down: If you fumble, you don't play. Production will be better when you play somebody who can hang onto the ball," Paterno said. 
lCOULDN'r BE SECRETARY, l'M JUST N01 THE TYPE AND 
ICAWTTYPE· 

The Lions (2-1) play Brigham Young on Saturday in Beaver Stadium and Paierno said his team also will have to string together first downs to maintain good field position. 
In addition to the fumbles, penalties added to the Lions' woes against Southern Cal, in­cluding calls for personal fouls. 
"It was a lack of poise," Paterno said. 
One call, however, was ques­tionable, Paterno said. In the first quarter, cornerback Derek Bochna returned a shove against a Southern Cal receiver and was penalized for a per­sonal foul. USC later scored. 
"I think we got a bad call. The one on Bochna was a bad call," Paterno said. 
Tuesday afternoon, Bochna admitted returning a shove. 
"Yeah. I did it, but it looked harder than it was," Bochna said. Bochna protested to the referee that he was shoved first. 
"I said, 'Aren't you going to call that? That was interfer­ence.' That's all I said." 
Paterno on Tuesday said he was looking for more consis­tency on offense, especially after the Trojans rattled the Lions' game plan Saturday. Tailback Richie Anderson, who splits time with Gerry Collins, said the team could be more consistent if one back was given the job full time. 
"That could be a possibility. I think it would help the running game, but that's a decision to be left up to Joe," Anderson said. Previous players have fallen into bad graces with Paterno for complaining about playing time.

Men's soccer opens homestand 
Irish look to break into win column vs. Central Michigan 
By JASON KELLY 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame (0-2) opens a four-game homestand with a 
7:30 p.m. matchup against Central Michigan tonight at Moose Krause Stadium. 
The Chippewas-who return nine of 11 starters from last year's Mid-America Conference championship team-proved their offensive abilities in their opening two games, a 7-0 vic­
-tory over Alma and a 5-0 win against Sienna Heights. Two consecutive losses to East 
·Stroudsburg and Oneonta State, however, have evened their record at 2-2. 
In order to defeat the Chippewas, the Irish defense will have to shut down junior forward Craig Bailey, who has collected five goals already this season. Bailey finished the 1990 campaign ranked 11th in the nation in scoring with 16 goals and 11 assists. 
While the defensive perfor­mance has been adequate, the Irish hope for better things of­fensively against Central Michigan. 
"Our emphasis has been to­tally on offense this week." said junior forward Kevin Pen­dergast. "We need to be able to convert on our opportunities, so we've been working a lot on finishing." 
Losing the first two games without scoring a goal would discourage most coaches, but the play of the Notre Dame men's soccer team has given coach Mike Berticelli nothing but encouragement. 
Despite being held scoreless in the opening two games, the 


Senior Tony Sm~h's performance against Michigan earned him praise from Lou Holtz at his weekly press conference. Smith caught five passes for a career-high 121 yards. 
Irish have blasted 22 shots on goal, keeping opposing de­fenses on the ropes. Senior captain Kenyon Meyer has led the way with seven shots this season, followed by Pendergast with four. 
"We had a lot of opportunities against Loyola, so I think it's just a matter of time," said Pendergast, who may sit out tonight's contest with a bruised ankle. "Look for us to come out and score about four or five goals tonight." 
Defensively, the Irish have also been impressive this sea­son. Freshman goalkeeper Bert Bader has adjusted quickly to college level competition, turn­ing back 14 shots in the open­ing two games. 
Bader is just one of 10 rook­ies who have seen considerable

Holtz struggles with loss of Bumpas, Miller 
By DAVE DIETEMAN 
Sports Editor 

As Lou Holtz has so often maintained, adversity is a part . of life. 
And as Notre Dame found out 
in Ann Arbor last weekend, ad­
versity isn't always pretty. 
The Irish, however, learned 
two painful lessons in life 
Monday night when defensive 
line coach Dick Bumpas fell ill 
with a virus of the cerebellum 
and freshman superstar-to-be 
Mike Miller quit school. 
In Bumpas' absence, Holtz 
will personally oversee the de­
velopment of the improving 
Notre Dame defense. 
"The loss of our defensive line 
coach is going to make it diffi­
cult for us to develop the rap­
port that we wish to develop on 
defense," noted Holtz. "Monday 
was more like the way I like to 
be on the practice field. I'm a 
hands-on kind of coach. I'm

Men's interhall football gears up for '91 
Defending Rockne champ Sarin faces stiff competition 
By GEORGE DOHRMANN 
Sports Writer 
Editor's note: This is the first in a three-part series preview­ing the 1991 men's interhall football season. 
Men's interhall football kicks off play this Sunday as 15 teams compete for a spot in the championship game played in Notre Dame Stadium in late October. 
The league consists of three divisions, and teams are placed in each division according to dorm size. The Rockne Division contains the five smallest dorms, while the medium-sized dorms play in the Leahy Division. The four largest dorms and the Off-Campus team play in the Parseghian Division. 
The Rockne Division may be the home of the smallest dorms, but by no means is it small on talent. Sorin skated through the regular season un­beaten last year, but will have difficulty repeating that feat in 1991, as the remaining four teams set their sights on a divi­
,.. 
sion crown. A Rockne Division team-by­team outlook: 

CARROLL 
There is an air of confidence which surrounds this year's Carroll squad, and for good reason. The Vermin enter the season with a number of re­turning players who will lead a dedicated team. 
Linebacker Tom Sullivan is the heart and soul of a stingy Carroll defense. Sullivan re­turns for his final year after earning Rockne League MVP honors last year. Joining Sullivan on the Vermin defense is end Tom Elmer, who should provide solid outside support to compliment Sullivan's tough in­terior defense. 
Junior quarterback Jack Hay and running back Mike Bell will be the focal points of the of­fense. They will work behind a talented group of lineman led by Elmer and guard Hastings Seigfried. 
Another plus for the Vermin could be coach Marty Urgen, who returns for his" second sea­son. 
"It's a big advantage having played under the same coach last year," said Elmer. "I think just that fact alone alone will help us." 
Carroll opens its season against St. Edward's on Sunday. 
FISHER 
The Green Wave surprised many last year by finishing 3-2 and earning a playoff berth. This year, they will take no one by surprise with a number of talented players on both sides of the ball. 
Quarterback Rick Ebert and tailback Curtis Baker make up a star-studded backfield which will work behind a mammoth offensive line. Ebert's main target will be 1990 All-Rockne performer Renzy Smith, who gives Fisher an explosive deep threat. 
Teams will be wary to run in­side on Fisher this year, as linebackers Gene Richards and Joe Mattio are imposing fig­ures. They are the nucleus of a defensive unit which appears solid in all areas. 
"We have had some good practices, and appear ready for the games to start," said Ebert.

the defense because defense is my thing. It's the only thing I've ever coached, and I do expect us to be a very good defensive football team." 
Bumpas was reportedly sick Monday night and again Tuesday morning, and is ex­pected to remain hospitalized for between one to ten days. 
Where Miller was concerned, however, Holtz expressed only sympathy and bewilderment. 
"Notre Dame is very great school," admitted Holtz, "but it is also a difficult school. It's not all glamour, There are a lot of lonely hours and hard work, not just football. I asked him if he had any plans for the future, and he said that he did not. He just made the decision that he was going to leave Notre Dame. Everybody has to do what is right and proper for them. But happiness isn't the goal of life. Your goal has to be a feeling of satisfaction inside yourself. 
"Michael Miller is a fine young man, an excellent ath­lete, and he has a good future in football. I think he had an explosiveness that could have given us some big plays, but we don't have him. If we don't have a gamebreaker, so be it. Let's hit the recruiting trail. You may see a number of people on kickoff returns that you've never seen befonl. There may be some guys that have never dreamed that they·would be doing that job." 
In assessing Milller's impact on the return game, Holtz openly declared tlb.at the possi­bility of playing walk-ons had not been ruled out. 
"I do expect us to be a good football team in the near fu­ture," said Holtz, "because we've won a lot of games at Notre Dame without a game­breaker. I have tremendous re­spect for walk-ons. You're going
