Student injured in fight 
A Flanner freshman was injured in an incident Friday night at the dorm's Screw-Your-Roommate dance. Another Flanner resident, a junior, allegedly accused the freshman of purposely bumping him on the dance floor. A fight ensued and resulted in the freshman being taken to a local hospital. He was treated for a slight nose fracture. According to a dorm source, the incident will be investigated by Dean ofStudentsJames Roemer. The Observer 
Red Cross revises policy 
The American Red Cross will revise its policy for selecting blood donors following reports that a baby may have gotten an often-fatal immune deficiency from a donor, the group's director says. However, because Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome may have a long incubation period, ''changes in donor selection or _ transfusion practices may not have an immediate effect on the number uf new cases reported," Dr. Alfred Katz, whose office is in Washington, D.C, told the Orange County Register in a story published Saturday. A 20-month-old San Francisco child is suspected to being a victim of the baffling syndrome, which leaves the patient unable to fight off infections. The child received blood from an apparently healthy 48-year-old man who later developed a pneumonia frequently associated with the syndrome and died, said Dr. Harold Jaffe, an epidemiologist with the National Center for Disease Control in Atlanta. -AP 
E.T. brings Christmas headaches 
Bouquets of flowers, bribes and threats are the stuff of Astnd Kamar's Christmas season. She is president of the company with exclusive rights to make "E.T." dolls -and some retailers are desperate for extra extra-terrestrials. "The pressure has been incredible," Mrs. Kamar said. "I've been around for 25 years and I have never been offered bribes before. I have never received flowers or been taken to dinner by customers before. Usually, I take them. Kamar International Inc. is the sole licensee for making the stuffed toys, which are based on the title character in the Steven Spielberg film, "E.T., The Extra-Terrestrial." Even with 45 factories in Korea and Taiwan working overtime, Kamar can't keep up with demand. Kamar has turned to air freight to try to meet orders. -AP 
Oark remains critical 
Barney Clark, who received a mechanical heart 11 days ago, remained semiconscious yesterday, his condition critical and "basically unchanged." Clark suffered seizures last Tuesday which were attributed to a chemical imbalance in his body and not to the plastic heart. Doctors say the heart has worked flawlessly. ''He slept through the night,'' said mary Dockham, the nursing supervisor at the University of Utah Medical Center. "It's basically unchanged, still critical but stable. He remains semiconscious." Clark's family was with him asain yesterday, she said talking with him and touching htm in hopes that the stimulation wil!l quicken his recovery. His wife, Una Loy, their daughter, Karen, and her husband, Tim Shaefer, have been in Salt Lake City since the surgery. -AP · 
Mother arrested for poisoning 
A woman arrested in Decatur, Illinois on a Virginia warrant chargin~ her with poisoning her 3-month-old daughter has watved extradition and will be returned to Virginia sometime next week. Eva Rogers, 21, was arrested Thursday on a warrant from Virginia Beach charging malicious assault with a toxic poison for allegedly giving juice laced with iodine to the child. The infant, whose name was withheld, was treated at a hospital and released. She waived extradition at a hearing Friday and will be returned to Virginia this week, although officials could not say exactly when. Mrs. Rogers, accompanied by the infant and a 3-year-old son, left Vtrginia Dec. 3 and came here, where she lived previously. -AP

Christmas all year 'round 
As Christmas approaches a spirit of love and good cheer fills us all. Yet the holiday goes by so quickly, and is usually capped with "Christmas is so short, wouldn't it be great if it could last all year long?'' 
The truth is, the spirit of Christmas can last long after the tree has lost its needles and the last candy cane is eaten, one only has to know where to find it. Once found, the spirit is an inspiring discovery. 
There's a nun in London by the name of Sister Moira who embodies that spirit. Moira and a group of volunteers go out each Friday night and feed the city's homeless from the back of a small van. 
The students in last semester's London Program were introduced to Moira through our rectress. A number of us went on the weekly excursions, and had the chance to see firsthand an example of the ''goodwill toward men" heralded at Christ's birth. 
Another student and myself accompanied Moira one cold night in mid-February. It had begun to drizzle as we made our first stop on the south side of the Thames (the "wrong" side of the river, so to speak). Gathered there around a small fire were a number of poorly dressed men of women, young and old, trying to fight off the cold until the van arrived. 
Moira, tough as the Connemara marble mined in the hills near her native Galway, Ireland, was all business as she designated certain volunteers to distribute soup, bread, rolls and tea. 
Her exterior softened as she talked with the people (Dossers, as they're known in London), mquiring after one man's health, chiding another for smelling of whiskey, arguing gently with a third that the soup was not overcooked. Moira felt at home with these people. 
Moira explained that many of the homeless had left economically depressed Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow in search of work in London. Failing to find a job, low on money and with nowhere to go, the dossers live on the streets. Rescue shelters provide only tempo­rary housing, and some dossers do not want to take advantage of Britain's extensive welfare system, fearful that their families will track them down. On the street, home is an old sleeping bag or discarded box, and dinner arrives any time between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m. 
The dossers, in spite of their situation, put on a proud front. One young man said that he was on the streets only for a little while, as he had found a job and a flat. Moira later told me that this guy had been finding jobs and flats for months. 
At our next stop I met an elderly Irishman named Paddy O'Malley. Like Moira, he was from galway, and he regaled us with a rendition of ''Galway Bay'' in his magnifi­cently clear Irish tenor voice. Moira remarked that I had planned to visit Galway before returning to the States. Upon hearing this, Paddy said ''Tim, can you take me back with you, please? I've haven't been home in fifty years, and I miss the place so " I didn't know

Inside Monday 


what to say; I mumbled that I'd think about It, and wandered to the other side of the van. 

We moved on tct Fleet Street, home of London's daily newspapers, and a popular site for the homeless. Dossers huddle near the lower windows of the buildings, warmed by the exhaust fans of the printing press rooms. In a side doorway of one of the building was a seemingly empty box. Further investigation revealed a sleeping woman, who awoke long enough to take a cup of soup and some bread. 
A few stops later we came upon a row of people in boxes and wrapped in blankets, sleeping under a railroad bridge. -A woman named only "Madame" requested soup, bread and tea. Was this a fallen member of the French aristocracy? Perhaps she wanted us to think so, as she said "Madame would like two cups of soup, Madame would like some bread, oh, no crusts please, and some tea, but only if it's hot." 
The most amazing stop was the last, at Charing Cross Station, a large Under~round and railroad terminal. Earlier that evemng the station had been bustling with playgoers on their way home from the nearby theaters. Now, sleeping men covered the floor of the upper station. Moira noted that the Greater London Council was seeking an injunction to have Charing Cross Station locked at night, charging that the dossers were an eyesore. 
My Fair Lady this was not. None of the. dossers had been kicking up their heels to "Wouldn't It Be Loverly?" We fed a lot of hungry, homeless people that night, and when it was all over, I felt quite a sense of achievement. 
I eagerly went on another soup run a few weeks later, and the second time around was a bit more difficult.. Here were the same people that we'd fed a few weeks ago, no better off than when we'd ldt them. Later, I asked Moira ifit wasn't discou1raging to see the same faces week after week. She said she wasn't expecting miracles. If she could help one or two to their feet, wonderful, if not, she'd see that they wouldn't sleep with an empty belly one night of the week. 
This is the true spirit of Christmas, giving, and not expecting anything in return, and giving not because it is a holiday, but year 'round. . 
Christmas Eve falls on a Friday this year. While many in Britain are enjoyinf! roast goose and Yorkshire pudding, Motta wtll be provid­ing a Christmas feast of soup, bread and tea. The dossers will receive much more than food, though. They'll be graced by the spirit of Christmas, a spirit that visits them every Friday night, all year 'round.

MXcontroversy to delay recess 
WASHINGTON (AP) -De­spite talk of compromise on the MX missile controversy, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that Congress will wind up its . lame-duck session as schedul­ed on Friday. 
Such rroublespors as the gas tax, an emergency jobs bill and the battle over the missile President Reagan dubbed the "Peacemaker," may keep the lawmakers in session through next week or even after Christ­mas. 
And Sen. Robert Dole, R­Kan., indicated yesterday the gas tax issue alone would keep Congress busy until New Year's Eve. 
Early in the week. the House IS expected to begin action on a storage spending measure that includes a $5.4 billion Demo­cratic jobs bilL 
Reagan signaled an apparent willingness to compromise on the MX issue Friday, saying he was willing to listen to con­gressional suggestions for improvement although he still thought his plan was the best. He insisted that the MX itself is viral to national security and arms controL 
Senators, including some highly-cr-itical of the MX and "dense pack," have stepped up negotiations for a compro­
mise. Most talk was about approving the production funds, but holding them up 

Congress sorts through 15 0 natural gas bills 
WASHINGTON (AP) ­Natural gas, America's most popular heating fuel, is raising temperatures in Congress, too. Facing an uproar over price increases, Congress will begin this week sorting out the first of more than 150 bills intro­duced to deal with the prob­lem. 
Controversy over natural gas is nothing new. But the current arguments are the hottest since the mid 1970s when gas short­ages forced the closing of hundreds ofschools and factor­Ies. 
This time people are upset because, despite a hug-e natur­al gas surplus, /nces are climbing at a recor pace. The government reported last week that in November, the start of the heating season in many areas, wholesale gas prices climbed by 5 percent, the biggest one-month increase since early 1980. 
One consumer group esti­mates that natural gas custom­ers will pay out $5 billion more in 1982 than they should be­cause of lax enforcement by regulatory agencies and impro­per actions by energy compan­Ies.

while another basing plan is studied, and giving Congress some kind of voice in the selection of a basing mode. 
Dole said he supported pro­duction of the missile, but the "dense pack" basing mode he dismissed with a curt: ''Forget it." 
In other matters, the House was still to complete action ona bill requiring manufacturers selling more than 100,000 auto­mobiles and light trucks a year in the United States to have a fixed portion of their produc­tion done in this country. It faces opposition in the Senate if it gets There. 
Dole warned that such a bill is only a hint of a possible ''rush to protectionism'' unless other ways are found to protect American industry competitive­ly. 
"We must demonstrate (to the Europeans and the Japan­ese) that we mean business" by offering American indus­tries government subsidies "in a few selected areas," Dole said.

SnoW clogs Eastern Seaboard 
(AP) -An unexpected snow­storm yesterday decorated the Eastern Seaboard with snow up to a foot deep from Virginia to Maine and Christmas shoppers were urged to stay home while plows worked to reopen clog­ged streets and highways. 
Heavy snow falling at the rate of 4 inches an hour in the Washington suburbs plastered the nation's capital and the big cities of Baltimore, Philadel­phia, New York, Providence, R.I., and Boston. Areas farther Inland were spared deep ac­cumulations. 
There were scattered black­outs and driving was perilous. 
At least 10 inches of snow fell at Dulles International Air­port outside of Washington. About 9 inches accumulated in Ashland, Va., 15 miles north of Richmond, and in other com­munities in the central and southern part of the state. 
The storm spread a broad swath of rain, sleet and snow from northern Mississippi to Maine. Muscle Shoals, Ala. got an inch of snow and anywhere from 4 to. 10 inches fell uvermght from eastern Ken­tucky to coastal New Jersey. 
Winter storm warnings were posted from Virginia to eastern Massachusetts, where a foot of snow was expected on Cape Cod. 
But skies were mostly clear in the Mississippi Valley and rivers continued to recede from flood levels last week that caused at least $620 million in damage and drove 35,500 people from their homes. 
The storm which developed off the coast of the Carolinas during the -night brought a sharp contrast to the· balmy weather of the week earlier when Virginians were enjoying barbecues with temperatures in thF mirl-70s and the ice

Police in Baltimore, where 5 inches of snow was on the ground by mid-morning, were urging motorists to stay off the icy bridges and highways. 
Dan McCarthy, a police spokesman, said, "The bottom line is: if you don't have to drive, don't." 
In Philadelphia, which also got 5 inches by morning, police said the snow combined with high winds caused numerous traffic accidents.

88-4 5 over Dartmouth 
Irish romp, enter finals 4-3 
By CHRIS NEEDLES 
Sports Editor 
Following its easy 88-45 
thrashing of Dartmouth Satur­
day, Notre Dame now faces its 
toughest tests of the semester. 
Yes, even tougher than Ken­
tucky, UCLA and Indiana. Last 
year, they put forward Tom 
Sluby out of action, and over 
the summer they took care of 
forward Barry Spencer and 
came dangerously close to 
taking one or two others with 
him. 

They're called final exams, 
and since basketball players 
are students too, they have to 
take them with the rest of the 
students. And, in past years, 
they haven't been too kind to 
Digger Phelps' teams. Bill 
Laimbeer and Gil Salinas, just 
to name two, were among the 
victims of the university's strict 
2.0 eligibility standard. 
But Phelps hopes this year 
will be different, and he is 
making exams a vital part of 
his gameplan. 
"Exams are our priority 
now," said Phelps of his team, 
which doesn't play again for 
ten days. "I'm going to give 
them a week to 'book' it. If 
we're rusty in our next game, 
I'll take the responsibility. 
That's the only way I coach 
final exams.' ' 
The academic probation lev­
ied upon Sluby last year and Spencer this year both came as somewhat of a surprise to Irish followers. And if he unfortu­nate happens again this year, 'Phelps and Co. won't know 
about it until it is too late. 
''Until finals are over we won't know if we lose any­body," Phelps said. "That's how hnals are. If you fail one, you can fail the whole course.'' 
Saturday's victory was the last basketball action of any kind that the Irish will see until Friday, wh_en Phelps will re­sume practice. 
Against Dartmouth, the Irish broke out to a quick 10-0 lead and were never seriously chal­lenged. The Big Green tried to shut off Notre Dame's inside game in the first half, but that just gave guard John Paxson free reign to fill it up from the outside. The senior all­American scored 16 points on 8-of-1 0 shooting to spur the Irish to a 40-16 halftime lead. 
The second half gave Phelps the opportunity to give every­some playing time, as all 12 scholarship players saw at least eight minutes of action. · 
"We got the lead and then we just played some people,'' said Phelps. ''I'm sure it was a big confidence builder for guys Iif.., Ti..,.., 4 .,rJrt>c and Jim Dolan.'' 
Dolan, the freshman from Point Pleasant, N.)., got a career-high nine points and five rebounds in his 17-minute stint·. Meanwhile, Andree, who has been relegated to the bench because of the play of freshman center Ken Barlow, grabbed a team-high nine rebounds to go along with six points in 20 minutes. 
Paxson finished with 22 points to lead the Irish, while senior Bill Varner chipped 15. Paul Anderson had 13 points to pace the_Big Green, but he had little help. The Dartmouth bench shot a combined 5-of-28. 
Notre Dame, which boosted its record above .500 (4-3) with the win, does not resume action until Dec. 22, when Valparaiso visits the ACC. But the next ten days may be the most important ones of the season for the Irish -when the "tests" really count. 
S.C. coach suffers heart attack 
University of South Car­olina basketball coach Bill Foster suffered a heart attack following his team's 59-53 upset of No. 20 Purdue on Saturday night, The Observer has learned. 
Foster, 52, who coached Duke to a runner-up finish in the NCAA Tournament in 1978, is in the intc'!nsive care unit of a Columbia S.C., hospital and his cond­ition is not known.

, , ,after beating Miami Friday 
By MIKE SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's basketball team made it four wins in a row by beating a tough Miami of Ohio team, 64-59, on Friday night at the ACC.

Irish trailed nearly the entire game before taking the lead for good with 4:33 remaining in the contest. Some tough defense allowed them to keep the score close while they tri.ed to overcome some offensive problems. 
"It was a good win for us," said Notre Dame coach Mary DiStanislao. ''This win was important because we didn't shoot well, and we didn't execute as well as we should have. Even though we went two-or three-minujte periods without scoring, we could hold them on the other end." 
For the first half, however, the Irish had their hands full with Miami, or specifically, Linda Mallender and Arlethia Porter. Mallender, the Red­skins' leading scorer entering the game with more than 19 points a game, and Porter, a 5-10 forward who was averag­ing four points a gam'e coming off the bench, combined for 30 of Miami's 39 first-half points. 
Despite making only 38 per­cent of its shots in the half while the Redskins were suc­cessful on 65 percent of theirs (mostly from outside), Notre Dame was able to hang _close and went into the locker room trailing only by six, 39-33. 
The offensive problems con­tinued in the second half for the Irish, who turned the ball over 11 times after inter­nusswn, and it was these problems that kept the game from turning into a rout, as the defense totally stymied Miami. 
The Irish defensive effort centered around stopping the hot-shooting mallender who ha made 9 of 11 shots in the first half. 
"We tried to take her out of the flow,'' explained Stanislao. "It was a lot like what Indiana did ·againstUohn) Paxson (last Tuesday). Once the ball left her hands, it couldn't get back in them." 
The strategy worked wond­ers as senior co-captain Debbi Hensley and Freshman Denise i3 •sford held Mallender score­.e.:;s for the entire half. Porter, who had 12 points in the first half, was held to only two in the second half. 
Meanwhile, the Notre Dame offense, led by senior forward Shari Matvey, slowly chipped away at a tough Redskin defense. Matvey's 15-foot jumper with 8:34 left gave the Irish their first lead since early in the game, 48-47. 
The lead see-sawed back and for the neYr six minutes as both teams turn ~d the ball over on several ucc tsicms. However, it was a missed shot that turned the game around.

Kaiser. ''But I heard Laura call for the ball and saw her alone under the basket.'' 
Dougherty's heads-up play allowed the irish women to win their fifth consecutive game, giving them a 5-2 record. The win was more difficult than it had to be, as Michigan ran its way ba::k into the ball game, outscoring the Irish during one stretch 18-5 to pull to within two points of the lead. 
"The (opponents') running game is still our Achilles' heel,'' said Notre Dame coach Mary DiStanislao. ''We were getting down way too slow. It got to the point where there were always four white shirts
