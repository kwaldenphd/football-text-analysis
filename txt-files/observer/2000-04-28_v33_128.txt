Despite $30M budget surplus, tuition rises 
By ERIN PIROUTEK Associate News Editor 
Money is everyvvhere at Notre Dame. The Generations campaign reached its $767 mil­lion goal 18 months ahead of schedule. The endowment climbed to more than $2 billion dollars. During football weekends the sold-out stadium, NBC contract and booming business at the new bookstore suggest an endless stream of wealth. 
But tuition continues to rise. 
A letter from University President Edward Malloy to parents boasts of "the lowest percentage increase in tuition and fees in two decades -5.2 percent." Although it sounds like the University reached a major breakthrough, each stu­dent still needs to pay Notre Dame about $1,000 more than last year, when tuition was $20,900. 
Notre Dame undergraduates are baffied. 
By all accounts, the University had a financially successful year in fiscal 1999, with a $259.3 million increase in net assets. The University usually finishes the year with

for this incident to leave permanent mental damage on Elian. 
"The photos of when they took the child were rather strong," said Martin Murphy, associate professor of anthropology, fellow at the Kellogg Institute and currently research.ing in the Dominican Republic. "This was a vulgar thing and a bit out of the norm." 
Although the pictures in tho media were powerful. 

Barbara Szweda, co-director of the Nofre Dame legal aid clinic and associate profes­sional specialist. said she believes it was necessary. 
"The government was try­ing to protect the kid, and they didn't know what Urn mob was capable of," she said. "I don·t think there is a bntter way [of getting Elian back to his father]." 
"If it's politicized to the point that it was, the govern­ment has little options," said Ailert Brown-Gort, associate director of the Institute for Latino Studies. ''A better way to resolve this case would have been to give Elian a green card and give him back to bis dad. He could have come back when­ever he wantt>d -it would have given him the ticket to come back."

ND, SMC attend WRC meeting 
By MOLLY McVOY Saine Mary's Editor 
Representatives from both Saint Mary's College and the University of Notre Dame will travel to 
Chicago today for the Worker Rights Consortium convention. 
Sandy Vander­werven, 


the manag-Hoye er of the Saint Mary's bookstore and the College's representative, will go as a voting member of the WRC and William Hoye, associate vice president and counsel for Nolre Dame, will go as an observer. 
This is the first meeting that has been open to non-members and, therefore, the first that Notre Dame has been able Lo attend. 
"We're going, not as partic­pants, but as an observer," Hoye said. "We have a number of questions we hope to get answered this weekend." 
Saint Mary's announced that it joined the group on April 3 and sent representatives to the founder's meeting on April 7. 
Currently, the Consortium has 45 collegiate members including the University of Michigan, Boston College and Indiana University. 
The conference includes rep­resentatives from just one fac­tion of the Consortium's three sections, the college and uni­versity representatives. 
This weekend, the WRC hopes to elect the college administrators who will com­prise part of the three-council governing board, assign the working groups that will final­ize many policies of thfl consor­tium and work out a final draft of the bylaws. 
'Tm really exf'.ited about this weekend," Vanderwerven said. "I do hope we come out of this with a more concrete message of what the WRC is about, not what it hopes to be." 
The working groups will dis­cuss the staffing and adminis­tration of the consortium, the 1froccdure for data collection on buyers, the development of a network among university members, the disclosure poli­cies and the bylaws. 
Many of the questions Notre Dame has going into to this weekend will likely be answered by one of those working groups. 
"We're anxious to know what their budget looks like," Hoye said. "We want to make sure it makes financial sense before we turn over 1 percent of our liscensing revenue." 
The open disclosure of buyers that the WRC monitors has been a deciding factor for many institutions in their decisions to join or not join the consortium. Hoye hopes to have a clearer understanding of what the WRC's disclosure policies are. 
"We'd also like to know whether the WRC is going to require all monitoring to be released, and. if they are, what their policies on that release will be." 
Hoye explained that, aside from meeting other university and college members this weekend, Notre Dame would like tu sit down with the cur-

Where are the 
sages? 
Where have all the prophets gone'? What has happened to the wise, the sages and the gurus') Where are the voices that cry out from the wilderness preaching 
reform and penance and peace? Is it that our society locks them up in a failure to respect what was once rec­ognized as a message from on high. or are they simply 
no more'/ 
I guess tlwse questions first arose for mP-when I was taking my first Hebrew 

class and we noted that the AJ Boyd JPwish prophetic tradition 
seemed to die out in the last 
Associate
couple centuries before Christ. No one really knows Viewpoint why, though many Editor 
Christians will assert that 
the obvious answer is that 
with the arrival of Christ there was no longer 
need to herald the coming of the messiah. 
My curiosity \-\'as further piqued when study­ing the Hebrew Scriptures (in English this time). My professor asked us to name modern day prophets. While several mentionnd Mother Theresa and the Dalai Lama and various local sages. he noted that no one mentioned the Pope. Yet. one eminent rabbi has said that the only world figure to speak with the same mes­sage and authority in this age is, in fact, the Holy Father. 
I had begun to consider the voices that speak to us as college students in a materialistic soci­ety, wonder which might have prophetic quali­ty. Certainly not the voices that have said it is better to amass things for oneself in disregard of or even competition with others, or those that have stated as Cain did that we are not our brother's and sister's keeper. 
Neither are they prophets who say {as mem­bers of our own Notre Dame family have) that it is more important to write papers and meet deadlines than to counsel friends or feed the hungry; that the main purpose of a Catholic university is to train financial leaders; or that the awareness raised by victims of crimes such as rape is self serving and that everything would be better if they all just kept quiet about what had been done to them. These are the voices of the servants of demons, not of God. 
Rather I think that, short of the voices of world leaders. we are first called to listen to those that cry out from the wilderness of loneli­ness or true faith in our very midst. Those who speak for victims, those who remind us we are here to be Christians first and students second, those who question the invasion of the profane, secular and material into this, a sacred institu­tion. 
Where have the prophets gone? They no longer address the nations. for the nations have long been lost, but they are addressed to communities and individuals. When we arc ready again to hear the voice of national and international prophecy and wisdom, we know that time has neared its end. But until then we are called to lend our ears to the small voices of our public conscious that will be humiliated by the majority, ignored by the press and belit­tled by our social leaders. For in that quiet call to repentance, penance and peace is the voice of God.

Metallica releases USC from lawsuit 
LOS ANGELES 
The University of Southern California has been released from Metallica's lawsuit regarding Napster, Inc., after the university instituted a partial ban on the mp3 music-sharing software last rriday, Metallica lawyer Howard King said. King said he hoped other universities would follow the precedent set by USC. Yale and Indiana universities. all of which instituted tempo­rary bans on Napster pending the outcome of the suit, in which all three were initially named. "[We would ask] the rest of the universities Ito] please look at these three leading universities, see what they did and why they did it and consider whether or not you should do the right thing also," King said. "If you're asking me (ill the implication [isl there that there's going to be other lawsuits, the answer is: possibly." There is alrnady one other lawsuit, filed Tuesday by rapper Dr. Dre in the

Maryland colleges censor papers 
TOWSON, Md. 

First Amendment rights have come into question this semester as some college newspapers in Maryland have faced opposition from school administrators rnacting to material printed in the publications. Administrators at Mount Saint Mary's College in Emmitsburg and Morgan State University in Baltimore have taken serious action against student newspapers. Oflicials at MSU blocked the Spokesman from printing one recent issue and William Lawbaugh, faculty adviser of the Mount St. Mary's Mountain Echo, was sent two letters of reprimand and had a raise withheld until lw could prove he would "serve the college as a responsible teacher of' journal­ism." At Goucher College in February, soveral stacks of the student newspaper were stolen and burned in protest of a controversial article. "Most colleges and universities are embarrassed to be labeled as a censor, but in a lot of cases that's what they do," said Mark Goodman, execu­tive director of the Student Law Press Association. Officials of the Mountain Echo believe the sanctions against its adviser stem from perceived improper or lewd material published in the pap<1r. One such advertisement claimed the I lolocaust never happened.

Leckey: Wo111en's roles expanding in Church, parishes 
Bv MOLLY McVOY Sainr Mary's EJicm 
The Convergence panel at Sn int Mary's will draft a char­ter for women in the Church in tlw new millennium this weck­Pnd. Tim annual conference will addr,,ss women and their rnlli in tlw Catholic Church 
Dolor('S Le('kPy. onP of' the Madel1wa lnctLJrPrs who will be rnturning lhis Wl'Pkend, sct\S wonrnn's roles expanding in the American Church. 
"What's happening today is that tlwrn is a scnsP of many doors opening !'or women In the Church," she said. "Today, which was not lhP case in the past, diocesan agencies are as likely to be run by women as men." 
Women serve on marriage tribunals. and more and more have become canon lawyers. These women am leading prayer services, and in some placPs, carrying oul limited sacramental roles. In Alaska, ror example. wonrnn are per­forming f\mnrals. Leckey said. 
Although the prit-isthood is not an option for women in the Catholic Church, Lcck11v sens both religious and lay .;omen as having an integral role in parish lii'e. 
''Women am taking on many more administrative roles in the Church today," Lcckey 
explained. "Eighty-five percent ui' parish lay ministers are women." 
Women played a role in the foundation of the Church and their roles will continue to grow, according to Leckey. 
"Women built the many infrastructures of tlrn Church in the United States, such as tlw hospitals and the schools." she said. "Since the Sncond Vatican Council, they have been very involved in parish life as well." 
Mary Doak, an assistant pro­fessor of theology at Notre Dame, agrees that women have played a major part in shaping the faith in the Catholic Church. 

"The faith that we have has been passed down to us pri­marily by many groups of women," she said. 
However, she sees women's roles as somewhat limited by leaders of the Church today, 
"It's sort of ironic," Doak said. "We inheritnd a tradition of allowing expanded roles for women outside the home, and now, in the Unitnd States, we [the Catholic Church] are viewed as the ones that are limiting women." 
Leckey sees more options available for women today, but agrees that tho effort to encourage women to take lead­ership positions in the Church has declined in recent years. 
"There needs to be more energetic efforts by bishops to evoke the gifts of women in the Church," Leckey said. "The bishops are smart enough to know, however, that they can't run their diocese without these women." 
As Convergence approaches, Lockey secs Saint Mary's as an institution which has the unique ability to not only pro­duce leaders with a strong Catholic background, but women leaders with t.hat f'oun­dation. 
"We have a lot of data that women's educational institu­tions are fertile ground for women leaders," she said. "I have run into young women who have a lot of ideal and dedication. Combine that with talent, and you have a pow<~r­l'ul resource."

The Saint Mary's Board of Trustees members will arrive on campus approve the budget for next year, present a strategic planning prgress report and report on the progress of the Master Plan. 
Saint Mary's role in the debate over sweatshop labor will not be discussed. 
"The trustees are aware of the WHC [Worker Rights Consortium] decision but that is not on the agenda," Eldred said. "The Master Plan is an ongoing item that the trustees will be discussing for the next several years." 
Senior Manuela Hernandez, the outgoing Student Trustee, will present the composition of the new Board of Governance and recount the events of the first annual Midnight Madness at her Student Life committee meeting. 
The Student Life committee has the largest number of' Board members and involves faculty and students from the Residence Hall Association and other organizations. 
"[The trustees] want more interaction with the students," Hernandez said. "We'll be having a discussion about how Saint Mary's is preparing for the future." 
Hernandez also said that Linda Timm, vice president for Student Affairs, would be giving a presentation about 
Student  Affairs  at  the  
Saturday  meeting  of  the  
Board.  

Eldred also usually gives a report on the status of admis­sions at each meeting, dis­cussing the class size and how Saint Mary's is doing in com­parison to past years, Hernandez said. 
Committee meetings will be held today, to be followed by a meeting of the entire Board. The Board will present the committees' information Saturday in Stapleton Lounge.

MIAMI 
!Vliami Mayor Joo Carollo firPd the city ma1iager Thursday. just days after he demanded the man dismiss the police chief for failing tu warn the mayor about the raid to seize Elian Gonzalez. 
Carollo had asked City Manager Donald Warshaw to fire Police Chief William O'Brien, saying he "lost all confidence" in the chief for not telling him that federal agents were about to raid the Gonzalez household early Saturday. Warshaw refused. 
Carollo insisted Thursday that Warshaw's firing had nothing to do with "little Elian." Carollo said Warshaw has been criticiz­ing him, lying and trying to turn department heads against him. 
The seizure of the 6-year-old Cuban boy has plunged City Hall into political turmoil. Only the city manager can fire the police chief. and Warshaw's refusal set the stage for the confrontation at a City Commission meeting Thursday night. 
Warshaw. who preceded O'Brien as chief, shook his head with a look of disgust as Carollo spokr-. Thr, city commission can 
overturn Carollo"s docision ii' four out. of five commissioners \'Ote to do so. 
"This is a painful thing to watd,. obviously," Warshaw said afterwards. "i'm sad for all that's happening in our city. Plf'ase be c-alm, the eyrs of the world arc watching us." 
Ilours after Elian was taking from the home of his Miami rel­atives, Carolin said of O'Brien "If I had that power ... I would !ire him." 
The police chief had an hour of advance notice of the 5:15 
a.m. raid. but has said he didn't want to tip off the mayor, who unlike O'Brien is Cuban­American and had openly sided with the Cuban boy's :vliami rel­atives.

NEW YOHK 
PPruvian candidate Alejandro Toledo said Thursdav he'II boycott the deciding second ~ound of presidential elections unless wide-ranging elec­toral abuses are eliminat­ed and he is allowed to rompetc on a "level play­ing field." 
The 54-vear-old ernno­mist poi~tAd to ballot stuffing and tampering throughout th,i country by President Alberto Fu_jimori's supporters in the ,\pril 9 first round, and warnr.d that he won't ­allow a repeal perfor­mance. 
TURKEY 
"Let me relate to you our firm commitment of not going into an election if conditions do not change significantly for the second round," Toledo told a gathering at the nonprofit Americas Society in New York. 
Fu_jimori has denied irregularities and assured a clean second round. The president won 49.8 per­r,ent of the vote in the first round, just short of the absolute majority needed to avoid the run-off with Toledo. 
But the results have been questioned by international monitors and on Tuesday, President Clinton signed a congres­
sional resolution warning that Peru could far,e politi­cal and economic sanc­tions if electoral irregular­ities persist. 
Toledo said the second round of elections may be a one-man race. There is no date set yet, but it is likely the elections will take place in eithAr late May or early June. 
"I don't want to legit­imize a process that is fraudulent," he said. "If there is not a political will to make any significant r,hanges in the rules of the game, (Fu_jimori) might be alone in the contest ... and he will not gain national and international legiti­macy. 
"At this point. I'm not very optimistic," he added. 
Toledo said Thursdav that ballots in many regions were cut so that his name -which was last on the list of candi­dates -did not appear. In other instanr,es he said ballots were waxed over. allowing only Fujimori's name to be marked. 
In some states. more people were reported to have voted than there were eligible voters. 
"It is clear that the fig­ures that vou see officiallv do not co0rrespond to the will of the voters." Toledo told the conference. He spoke in English. 
Parliament likely to elect reformist judge 
Associated Press 
ANKAHA 
Turkey's Parliament railed to eltH.;t a president in the first round of voting Thursday, but delivered its strong support to a reformist judge who is liktily io caplllre the office in latPr balloting. 
The vote was a blow to Prime Minister Bulent F:cevit who had serurnd promises !'mm party lead­rrs to support his candi­date. 
Ahmet l\iecdet Sezer, a top jutlgt1 who has spoken of the need for demor,ratir, reforms, received 281 votes. falling short of the two-thirds required for election i-n the flrst round. There are 550 seats in parliament. 
The other votes were split between nine other candidates. The cundidate who came in sor,ond, '\/rwzat Yalcintas, recrived only 61 votes. 
SPveral candidates were expected to drop out of the race in the coming days. The next round of balloting is schPduled fur Monday. If the vote reaches a third 
round, a candidate r,an take the ollice with a sim­ple majority. 
"ft is dear as of now that the results will be good for Mr. Sezer." Ecevit said after the balloting. "I am very optimistic about the rnsults." 
Earlier this week, the leadArs or all five parties in parliament agreed to sup­port Sezer's nomination. But Thursday's vote was a secret ballot and many deputies from the ruling coalition clearly did not back SezAr. The ruling coalition has 351 mem­bers. 
"The government is los­ing its force over its own party groups," said Fehmi Koru. a political analyst. "It will not affect the gov­ernment in the short-run. but after the elPction. Ecevit mav think about his partners.in the govern­mAnt." 
Thr f'irst-round ballot comes just two weeks after Eccvit failed to muster enough support for a r,on­stitutional amendment that would enable Prnsident Suleyman DPmirel to run for another tPrm.

Hawkins speaks on struggle to integrate sexuality, work 
By KIFLIN TURNER 
News Wrirer 
Prol'1issor Pel!ir Hawkins spokn as a mnntor, a Christian and a gay man when he addrcss11d the sexual idfmtity in tlw workl'orco on Thursday. llawkins ideutified his presen­tation as one emanating from an oral history that he cmbod­
i11s, 
"l knew what I was, I knew what my dtHlp loves wr.re, but I was unnhli: to act out." said llawkins 
/\s a product of the Baby Boom in thf' '50's and '60's, Hawkins recalled that dialogue about homosexuality did not PxisL Thnre wtrn n;i st.udi:nt organizations that properly addrnssf'd sexuality, said llawkins. 
During the '70's Hawkins dodgNI going to thP Vietnam War by becoming an elomcn-
Lury school tnachnr in Nnw York, llawkins nil1Pcted on the many ideas he canw up with in his attempt to evade war. 
·11 never orcurrnd to me to be gay to get uut of Vietnam," said Hawkins. This evirnt was an influential moment in llawkins's life in shaping his id1ntitv as an individual. 
"The '60's and '?O's were about Vietnam, and staying out of it -whirh I did," said llawkins. The '70's and '80's W!ll'H for,useci towards diwelop­ing a professional career, llawkins said. 
"Work was tlrn way I got out or the middle class," said Hawkins. Escaping from this social class that embraces tra­ditional views. Hawkins was able to define himself in terms of accomplishmf'nts rather than basing his worth from the judgements of others. 
''Work became my identity and I would not give uµ my identity for the world," Hawkins said, In other social circles within Church and closn relationships, Hawkins com­mnntnd that his sexuality did not prove as a menacing obsta­cle. 
"I could integrate my sexuali­ty and my Christianity," said Hawkins. Church was a place to be real, and consequently, Hawkins added, his sexuality was not something feigned, 
"It was work wlrnrc I could not allow myself to be gay," said Hawkins. The closet had its many reasons, and during this time, the closet was a place to retreat and hide, said Hawkins. 
"I did not want to ber,ome the boy scout leader for gay stu­dents," he said. Hawkins had begun teaching at Yale University and recalled keeping his sexuality a st>crnt in tht> beginning. 
Along wilh the continued dcvPlopment of his profrssional and academic career, Hawkins also spoke uf his life-altering relationship with his lover who later died of' AIDS. 
"I managed to evade Vietnam. and I managed to miss the UIV virus, but I did not miss AIDS," said Hawkins. Even though Hawkins was not infect­ed with the virus, he r,ited this experience as the key turning point in coming out or the closet at work. 
"I. am not a confronting per­son, I am nnt a radical person. in any sense -but I am a gay man," Hawkins said. Hawkins noted that Yale stood by his request to take time off work to take care or his lover through his battle with AIDS. 
At this point, Hawkins found it impossible not to come out about his sexuality, and sal­vaged the strength and courage necessarv in the face of death, Hawkins· became increasingly vocal about his sexuality with his fellow facultv members at Yale.  
"II' I did not talk about these things in faculty nHwtings, who would?" said Hawkins. Hawkins noted that being in tenure at the University facili­
tated his decision to be more forward. 
"The silence of who we are. the tnrror of speaking as a gay man" has gradually disap­peared, Hawkins said. Hawkins remarked that there were no noticeable differences in the way his co-workers responded to his revelation. 
Aside from the workplace, Hawkins finds that his deep spirituality and faith inspires him to reach peopln in the Church to accnptancn and awareness. 
"The way I am interested in being a gay activist is as a Christian," said Hawkins. The Church is the primary institu­tion that breeds fear and igno­rance, said Hawkins. 
llawkins is currently a pro­fessor of Religion and Literature at Yale Divinity School. 
Hawkins received his Master of Divinity from the Union Theological Seminary and his Ph.D. in English from Yale. Hawkins is also a respected Dante scholar.

a budget surplus. 
''Thr average budget surplus is well over :Jo million dollars per year," said Notre Dame student body presidenl Brian O'Donoghue. 
$30 million question The budget surplus is not well­publicized, but students who know about it are surprised that tuition incr<'ascs an still 1rnces­sary. "When you haw a $30 miUi.on surplus like that, I think it's totally inexcusable to raise tuition," said junior Julie Carbo!. 
Scott Malpass, Notre Dame vice president of' finance, acknowledges that the hudget usually has a surplus. He 
explained lhal "Notre Dame is not

discuss how tu allocate tho money. Last year the surplus was spent on capital improve­ments. academic needs and financial aid. 
Notre Dame doesn't pretend to be cheap. It costs more than a million dollars a day to operate the University. Financial aid lit­erature warns students that pay­ing for Notre Dame requires sac­rifice and that "annual increases in the cost of a Notre Dame edu­cation are anticipated." 
But in light of Notre Dame's vast financial resources, why does tuition continue to rise? Malpass explained that Notre Dame's goal is to increase its academic reputation. 
"Notre Dame is in a mode of continuing advancement," said Malpass. Currently ranked 19th in the influential U.S. News and Reports rankings, Notre Dame is striving to better not only that ranking but also the overall quality of academics, research and student life. 
And advancement is expen­sive. 
Building to the future 
Construction occurs at a dizzy­ing pace. '.Ytore faculty positions are necessary for smaller classes and more student-professor interaction. Thanks to massive improvements in recent years, Notre Dame's technology infra­structure is in the top 1 percent among colleges and universities. 
One reason the University focuses on advancement is to continue recruiting quality stu­dents. The average S/\T score of the freshman class has risen substantially over the past sever­al years. Today's students pay for new advancements to attract tomorrow's best and brightest. 
But shouldn't it be possible to provide a quality education, maintain a top ranking and make Notre Oame affordable lo all students? Williams College, a Massachusetts liberal arts school, decided to freeze tuition [or the first lime in 46 years, cre­ating a buzz in schools across the~ nation. Notre Dame doesn't c'xpect to follow suit anytime soon. 
"We continually have to raise tuition to continue that advance­ment." said Malpass, citing William's move as a short-term solution that would cause long­term problems. Williams used money from its endowment. to cover the tuition increase. 
"Yes, we 
could [freeze 
emphasizing 
the impor­tance of the endowment for 
Notre Dame's future. 
Malpass explained that Notre Dame's $2 billion endowment is not sufficient to halt tuition increases and provide security for the future. Although Notre Dame's alumni are more gener­ous than most, donors often have specific requirements, which don't necessarily coincide with students' desire for more schol­arships. 
"People don't want to give 
money to financial aid, they want 
theil· names on things," said 
O'Donoghue. 
Excellence for all? 
Perhaps more important than the overall cost of Notre Dame is whether the Cniversity helps all students afford it. 
Officials note with pride that 
the amount of financial aid has 
increased a much greater per­
crmtage than tuition has. 
Admission to Notre Dame is 
need-blind and the financial aid 
ollice boasts that it now meets all 
students' demonstrated financial 
need. In the current school year, 
Notre Dame undergraduates 
receive more than $27.8 million 
in need-based University schol­
arship aid and $15.8 million in 
need-based student loans. 
But individual families oftnn 
have greater need than the for­
mula demonstrates. 
"Notre Dame is not meant to 
be, nor was it ever meant to be 
an institution for upper-dass 
kids," said ()'Donoghue.

class -J9 percent -receives scholarship assistance. Although the University is proud of its increased scholarship funding, is Notre Dame really doing enough if 61 percent of students do nut recoive scholarships'! Or is tho majority of the freshman class wealthy enough that it doesn't ne£~d scholarship assistance to foot tho approximaloly $30,000 yearly bill for tuition, room and board'? 
For those who do rnceive aid, often a large potion of' thn need is met not through scholarships, bm "sdf-lrnlp" measurns such as loans and work-s1udy. While in theory, "self-help" programs placfl necessary responsibility on the shoulders of the students, it may n1quirn more hfl!p than stu dents are ablo to give. 
"From my point of view the administration has not helped me at all financially," said Carbo!. "I will bn so rar in debt when I get out or here," 
Administrators say they are awarn uf student debt worries but, as of yet, no solutions have been developed. "Thfl Universily is currently striving to address the concern for student debt lev els," said Joseph Husso, direr.trir of finandal aid. Students, howev­er, will continue to struggle until the concern translatc~s into spe­cific changes. 
Students who have to or want to pay for their education them­selves find it nearly impossible, even with great sacrifice. At six dollars per hour -the approxi­mate pay rate or student campus jobs -a student would have to work 96 hours a week, year­round, to pay the $30.000 yearly bill for a Notre Dame education. 
For some, it's just not worth it. All of her life, Erin Emme has been a Notre Dame fan. When she was accepted at Notre Dame and entered school in fall 1998, it was the realization of a dream. But Emme, a theology major, Jell Notrn Dame all.er her f'reshman year. 

"Since I was going into such an 1111-lucrativn ffold and becausP I wasn't goi11g tu rnakP any nrnney, I couldn't justify tlrn cost," said Emme. 
'"My exp<'rience with the pcio­plc in financial aid [is thall these people arn passionate," said ()'Donoghue. "I've always been impressed with their dedication to the studenL<;.'' 
Hut financial aid otlicials work with strict rules and formulas rooted in the concept of demon­strated financial need. Personal situations don't always show up in the numbers that th(~ financial aid officers sec. 
"In some cases there will be allowances for individual circum­stances," said James Malloy, associate director of financial aid. "That's part of our business, to listen and respond to each family." 
It's not easy, though. Financial aid officers require convincing proof that family circumstances have changed or the aid formula overlooked the specific financial dilliculties. 
Athletics to the rescue 
Notro DamB has also c:ontin­ued to pursue f'unding souru\S rrom outside the University. Notre Dame's tPlcvision con­tract with NBC for home foot­ball games has bolstered finan­cial aid by $50 million over sev­eral years. Additionally, the University requires that a por­tion of' the tickPt profits is retunrnd to the gtmeral operat­ing budget for academic S!'r­vic:os. 
"l\otre Dame may be the only major institution where athlet­ics actually funds academic advancement -at most schools the athletic department loses money and must be fund­ed by the univc1 rsity." s a i cl Malpass. 
But while students can hope that the growing endowment and football revenues will pro­vide more financial aid in the future, the University has no plans to discontinue tuition increases. 
"Quality is expcmsive. That's just the bottom line," said Malpass.

Students step up to the plate to defeat breast cancer

Whl'n the l'\otn Da11w hase­hal I t<>am takcs on Big East rival St. John's this Sunday, it will be µlaying nnP of' its biggt>st gamt>s of thP season. l'rofossor Charles Lennon's managPnwnt dass will also bfl squaring off with a formidahlc oppo1rnnt. Tbn two organiza­tions hnvP l"ornwd an alliancf\ in tlw battlr against brrast

"Chuck Lc1u1011's mnnage­mPllt 231 class is promoting and pulling togntlrnr this breast !'Hllf'<'r awarPn<ss gamf' to put inl'ornrnt.ion out in the commu­nity about this so young people and 1woplr in tlw community will lwronrn morn awarn," said soplrnmorP Paul O'Toolc. ThP gam<' is cspl'(:ially swPPt for O'To11l1, who is a l:atclrnr for tlw lmschall tPam. 
ull is a huge rivalry will! St. John ·s. so ol" coursn WI) are going t.o bP t11nml up for that, but with the crowrl we arc P.XJJPl'ting, we an) rnally going to be excited," hi' said. O'Toole was inlimately involved with tlw project. 
IIP organized 111'f-lidd activi­tiPs likr· thP national anthem, lirst pitch and priZP giveaways. l!P also acwd as the clas:;' link to team coaches and players. 
'Tm actually llw only one on tlw baseball team from the class and to lw on Llw field and SP!' it all rnme togPllwr is really spPc·ial." Im said. 
"This is tlw third vcar he l.Pnnonl has b!:Pll d11ing this. llis wit'P is a breast nrnn!r sur­vivor, I am assuming that is the reason," evaluation committee leader Heather Shannon said. Shannon's duties indude cam­pus promotion and surveying the crowd about breast cancr,r, OthPr committees include plan­ning, organizing. leading and docunrnntation groups. 
"Thci very first day we were given our groups, it is definitely the main focus or the class," Shannon said, 
''Tho management course is onp where students sign a con­tract with me to apply managc­m en t skills to an event,'' Lr.nnon said. The course is a Cullege of 13usiness approved Sl'rvir.e IP-arning dass. OvP-r tlrn past five semesters, Lennon's classns have put on breast can­u r awar<'ness !'Vents at women's volleyball and basket­ball games in adrlition t.o base­ball games. 
"We are going to bn honoring breast cancer survivors at tlrn game," Shannon said. Ilonorc!ls include Professor Lennon's wil'e. Joan. Professor LPnnon was candid with the class about Lhe reasons for the game; he brought breast cancer sur­vivors in to share their stories. 
"We had speakers every Wednr.sday throughout the whole semester. Some of the spflakers were survivors, Mrs. Lennon came out too." O'Toole said. 
Mrs. Lennon is a likely candi­date for throwing the first pitch, narrowly beating out Regis Philbin. he continw~d. 
Other honorees include a male alum who b!1at breast cancer. "lie is doing the Avon three-day walk and we are going to help him raise money because he needs $1800 to 
walk in it," Shannon said. Thi' walk is con­ducted in an effort to raise money for breast cancur research. 
"We am going to do things between the innings and we have prizes to give away; Adidas equip­ment and plane tickPts," said Shannon. The game promises to have a carni­val atmosphere, but the greater messagH will focus on breast cancer. 
"Thnc will br people there hanrling out information packets from the hospitals nearby," O'Toole said. ThP packPts will help inform a large audience about signs of breast cancer and how to help the day's cause. 
This weekend's activities seek to promote not only breast can­cer awareness, but Notre Dame baseball as well. 
"It is good to get a lot of' peo­ple involved, because not a lot of people come out to the base­ball games. But with this event we are hoping for a big turnout," O'Toole said. "Last year we had terriblr, weather and still had over 2000 people come out to the baseball game." 
On the other hand, Professor Lennon's management class has managed to promote itself. 

"This is a great experience, and flveryone is talking about it," O'Toolc said. Lennon's class was one of the first courses to close during last spring's pre­registration. 
"I would say that tho over the past five semesters that there is no doubt that this is a totally different experience," Lennon said. "It is a fun class to teach." 
"It is definitely my most inter­esting class, I feel like I have more invested in it. It is a real­life experience and I will have more experiences like it later in life," Shannon said. 
In addition to text readings, lectures and exams, Shannon's efforts include breakfast meet­ings and more work than she puts into her other classes at school. But she doesn't mind. 
"It doesn't feel like classwork," she said, "it just feels like plan­ning a baseball game." 
"I think that is the way most people learn, to get their hands dirty, do the actual work and sec the end result," O'Toole said. 
While tensions could be run­ning high for the team at such an event, Lennon isn't con­cerned. "My motto is; high trust -high performance. You trust them [the students] and pre­pare them and you can expect the performance to be there. But the anxiety helps keep you on your toes." 
Anxiety aside and after a semester of planning, Lennon's class will see the end results at noon this Sunday at Eck Stadium. Admission is free.

CDC study: Higher beer taxes mean fewer STDs 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA 
Cheap benr is a leading contributor to the spread of sexually transmitted dis­eases, according to a government rnport that says raising the tax on a six­pack by 20 cents could reduce gonor­rhea by up to 9 percent. 
Tlw CPntPrs for Disease Control and Prevention study, released Thursday, comµared changes in gonorrhea rates to changes in alcohol policy in all states from 1981 to 1995. 
In years following beer tax increases, gonorrhra rates usually dropped among young people. The same happened wlwn the drinking age went up -as it did in many states during the 1980s. 
"Alcohol has been linked to risky sex­ual behavior among youth. It influences a person's judgment and they are morn likely to have sex without a condom, with multiple partners or with high-risk partners," said llarrell Chesson. a health economist with the CDC. 
Beer industi·y lobbyists, howovcr, said recent statistics show young pnople are already drinking more responsibly, thanks in part to efforts by brewers. 
"Excise taxf's have little or nothing to do with alcohol abuse in sodcty," said Lori Levy or The Beer lnslitute in Washington. 
"I think that our members understand the importance of educating young pco­plf' about how to make responsihlc choices once they're old enough and they put a lot of monny and effort into those programs," lw continued. 
Gonorrhea, one of' the most common venereal diseases, was examinmJ in thn CDC study because long-term statistics am available and the disease is more 
Nike will not renew U. Mich contract 
Associated Press 
DETROIT 
'.\like Inc. said Thursday that it has terminated negotirrtions on the renewal of a six-year, multimillion-dollar licensing agreement with the University of Michigan. 
University President Lee Bollinger accused the company of retaliating against Michigan for its involvement with the Worker Rights Consortium, a student-driven coalition of schools demanding that Nike provide better labor conditions for overseas workers. 
Last week, Nike Chairman Phil Knight withdrew plans to donate $30 million to his alma mater. the University of Oregon, after that school joined the consortium. 
"Michigan seems to be the next target or a major attempt 
bv Nike to breach understand­ings and make some kind of corporate statement," Bollinger srrid. 
Nike did not disclose the dol­lar value or the proposed new contract with Michigan, one of 
',200 colleges and universities with which it has licensing agreements. But tho new deal would have been what Nike called its largest university kpartnership" -providing funding and Nike footwear, apparel and equip­ment to all 2!i men's and women's varsity teams and recreational sports programs through August 2006. Under Michigan's existing deal with Nike, which Pxpircs Aug. 31, the company annually pays the athlPtics department $590,000. Nike also supplies $930.000 in products to be Michigan's 
exclusive sporting goods provider -and gets a promo­tion al Loost from placing its logo on Wolvnrine uniforms. 
kit Morris, Nike's director of' college sports marketing, said in a statement that the break­down of talks with Michigan had nothing to do with the uni­versity's membership in the Worker Rights Consortium. 
But Morris said one of the changes Michigan· sought in the proposed contract -regarding labor issues -was "problmnat­
ic." 
That change, Morris said, "would give thn university uni­lat1!ral authority to impos11 any standards, guidelines or princi­ples that thr.y should adopt over the six-year tnrm of th11 agree­ment, and that kind or open­checkbook agroenrnnt is some­thing that we're simply unpre­pared to agree to." 
evonly spread among states. 
The CDC analyzed the drops i11 gonor­rh ca rates l"nllowing different tax increases and came up with the esti­mate that 20-cent increase per six-pack would lead to a 9 percr.nt drop in gon­orrlrna rates. 
Chesson cited the example or a HJ­cPnt per gallon -about 9 cPnts per six­pack -tax increase in California in 1991. 
Gonorrhea rat11s in th<' l !i to 1IJ agn group dropped about 30 percnnt the f'ol­lowillg year. Drops in other states wPrn not as dramatic. 
During the study, various statns raised beer taxes 36 times. Gonorrlrna rates among in Uw 1!i to 19 ago group dropped in 24 ol' those instances, and rates among those 20 to 24 dropped 26 times. 
In both age groups, men soem to he morn affected than women by higher beer prices. 
Most minimum legal drinking age increases were also followed by a decrease in the gonorrhea rate, espe­cially in the 15 to 19 age group. 
"This study suggests these strategics could have a significant impact in reducing sexually transmitted disr,ases among young people," said Dr. Kathleen Irwin, chief of health services research and evaluation for tlw CDC's division of' sexually transmittnd dis­casos. 
/\bout 3 million t1)1rn-agers are infect­ed with sexually transmitted diseases each year, Chesson said. 
Gonorrhea usually can be treated with antibiotics, although somr. drug­rnsistant strains have been developed over the years.

A HACKER BROKE INTO OUR 5Y5TEI"'\ AND FOUND OUT OUR CORPORATE 
STRATEGY. 

The Notre Dame Connection 
Last Friday I sat in thn Cincinnati­Western Kentucky Airport, waiting for a plane to take me to Philadelphia. Every half-hour or so, an apologetic Delta employee announced over the microphone that the departure would be another half-hour or so later than planned. Two hours after the scheduled departure time, I called my mother. "Mom, sorry but I won't be home for Easter this year. The plane to take me to Philly isn't going to arrive before the one to return me to Notre Dame." 
I sighed and took a scat by the window. "So where are you coming f'rom?" the guy next to me asked. 
"South Bend," I replied. "How 'bout you?" "Oh, just Cincinnati. Notre Dame?" he 
inquired. "Yeah, I'm a first year," I answered. "Yes! My sister and two brothers went 
to Notre Dame. I'm a big fan," he exclaimed. 
The woman next to mn, who had spent the last hour frantically dialing numbers on her cell phone, turned to us. "So you go to ND. I low do you like it'?" 
"Oh, love it," I responded to her, a 1998 graduate. 
As we conversed about the current state of our fair University. an older cou­ple seated across from us interrupted our conversation. Their son also went here. A lively conversation ensued aboul this University and its relationship with llrn world, which at the moment seemed very, very small. I then noticed a bizarrn phenomenon. I had gained the approval of four complete strangers simply through my attPndanco at this University. The daughter of an alumnus, I have wit­nessp,d this before. As my father explains, "If you ment someone else from Notn Dame, that pBrson immediately regards you as 'ok' simply bncause you went (or go) there." 

Or know someorw who went (or goes) here. My mother. for example, brokt1 tlw law without punishment for her associa­tion with my fathnr. Hacing to ment friends arriving for a football game against Navy the next day, she was stopped by a policeman. When he asked her why she had reach11d 65 miles per hour (or 55 miles per hour depnnding upon your point of view) on a 45 mile ppr hour road, she explained about tho foot­ball game and the l'riends and my father. The policeman, a fan apparently, let hor go. I le seemed to rngard a Notre Dam1i football game as an adequate motivo for speeding. (l)espito my months long ago­nizing colloge search, I now know that I made my choic< at that moment. Any rol­lnge that gets you out of a ticket must be superior. And also, why not avoid stress over speed traps if possible'?) 
Occurrences like the af'orementiormd sometimes evoke within me the foeling that I have bncomf' part ol' a secret soci­ety. As I pondered this feeling, I rnalized that this Univnrsity do1is have some cult­like characteristics, For instance, tho elders or th11 community -the alumni ­indoctrinate impressionable youth ­their children -with the dogma of this University. I rmnmnber reciting our fight song on the bus in fourth grade. My father had written it out for me and sung it (unfortunately) to me numerous timns. (According to my aunt, he hummed tlrn melody to nw in my crib.) 
The isolation of' earn pus augments this indoctrination once tht~ youth arrivP to study. Frcshnrnn sp1md most of tlrn year on onn square miln of land as thny lack masons to leave campus and have dilli­culty doing so when one arises. But I sup­pose this occurs on many college cam­puses. 
Finally, a friend. Beth, alnrwd me to a striking parallPI betwPen this University and a clandesti1rn community in tlw wildernnss. Freshman Orientation did not mark the lirst time llfith had biwn grnnt­nd by inhabitants of' a place foreign to her with the phrase, "Welcome home." Apparently, she had driven a f'rilmd lo a hippie, earth-loving camp isolated in the woods ofwcst1ffn Pa., where the campers also used this expression to welconw visi­tor~ (home, p1)rhaps). Nnedlnss to say, BHth folt rather uncnrtain of her 1·.hoirn of college on hnr lirst day here. 
But I believe thal llrn phrase, "wclconrn home," and the otlrnr sc1111ingly cult-like aspP.cts of tlrn University s1!rve simply as marks of its strong sense of' community. The presence of active alumni clubs also speaks of this unity. 
And my connection with follow Donwrs in the Cincinnati airport certainly 111adP tho wait for the plane more lrnarabln and less lonely, although I belinve I would have eventually madn other f'ricrnds whiln waiting for my commcting !light to Philadelphia. I nrnan. who can spend six hours in an airport without al lnast talk­ing to somebody? 
But tlrn "Notrn Danw Conrwrtion" c.er­lainly did make it vnry easy for nw to find friends.

College Illust warn about poison lawns 
I wish to protest the totally unm)ccessary chemical spraying of Saint !vlary's lawns on Wednesday, April 26. A friend and I walk to school togiither, along the old railroad track and across the fields at Saint Mary's. Walking home on Tuesday, we breathnd in delicious, health-giving air laden with the scent of blossoming cherries and just-opening lilacs. Returning on Wed1wsday morning, we were nearly choked and entered Madalcva coughing. We were unablo to walk on any grass for foar of poison -but had lo stick to the pavement. As we approachPCl we saw a man actually spraying the chemicals. He had no mask or protection of any kind. 
On private lawns. it is the custom for the spraying company to put up litt!B warning signs to keep people and pets off the lawn until the poison has dried or supposedly become less virulent. No such signs appeared at Saint Mary's. On April 27, the air still reeked or chemicals, but I have seen sun-bathing students -and even some classes -sitting outside on the sprayed lawns. 
Saint Mary's has been remiss in failing to protect its faculty, students and staff -especially the grounds staff. But it has also brwn uncaring about the other living creatures on campus. Spraying lawns promotes the collapse of biological diversity. As part of its Fall 1999 Landscape project, Saint Mary's Library sponsored a photographic exhibit on lawns called "Crush Zone" by PPrry Kirk. Kirk described the disastrous results of pesticide run-off from tlrn \lississippi River: crustaceans and other ocean life am suffocated by i.he algae bloom caused by the chemical run-olT. Every year, a greater area of the Gulf of Mexico is affected. The College also sponsored a lecture by ecologist Professor Holly Great-Bear Tibbets, who had excellent advice to offer Saint l\lury's about ecological matters. The College spon­sors these events but then ignon~s their message. 
At present, there arc signs up at Saint Mary's urging ecologi­cal awareness in honor of Earth Week. The students do their best to promote recycling and other ecological efforts, but they can do very little while the College still pursues such an irre­sponsible. short-sighted policy,

Reject black and white world views, embrace ambiguity 
With each May comes my unauthorized com­mencement address to the seniors. This year's unauthorized fantasy address has special rele­vance for me because Spring 2000 is the 30th anniversary ofmy first spring at Notre Dame in 1970. 
Between the end of my high school senior vear and the end of my collegl\ freshman year 30 years ago, my life had completely changed. 
The first man landed on the 1110011 and Woodstock rocked during my summer between high school and col­

lege. Yet those events paled 
in comparison to the impact the shootings of four student protesters had on mfl. When 
Capitol
my fellow students at Kent 
Comments
State were murdered for voicing their opposition to the Vietnam War, I saw that school meant nothing in relation to events in the real world. College undergraduates of that day knew that we would find good jobs after gradua­tion. But at that moment in the spring of 1970, life and principle had to take precedence. 
Overnight I went from a relatively conservative apple-pie-eating, American-flag-waving, patriotic supporter of the war to a hard line opponent. It was wrong for my government to kill unarmed students. It could have been me who was shot by American National Guard soldiers. But for the chance location of the event, it could have hap­pened at Notre Dame to my roommate, my class­matos or to my cousins in colleges across the nation. It was truly a black and white moment in mv life. 
Today 30-second sound bites try to make issues, candidates and political philosophies easy black and white choices for us. Yet nothing is ever pure­ly black or white in our political arena. The shades of gray may vary ever so slightly to reflect the various complexities of the choices we or our elected officials must make. 
An equal rights constitutional amendment in the 1970s was such an issue where seeing the color of the issue would have enlightened and benefited our nation. Abortion, gay rights, gun control mea­sures and Elian Gonzalez's custody battle are the most recent examples of such issues that have manv brilliant colors that, unfortunately, are blind to those unwilling to work for consensus by aban­doning their black and white rhetoric. 
Notre Dame's administration plays the black and white game to perfection. Recently though, I, for one, am puzzled. On one hand, gay students cannot organize a University-recognized group because their conduct is in conflict with the University's mission and character. Yet on the other hand, an alleged student rapist's conduct has not violated a code of conduct, bas not harmed a fellow student who refuses to press charges against him and does not violate either the University's mission or character. Can anyone explain to me how premarital heterosexual con­duct ... alleged date rape nonetheless ... differs? 
And while Notre Dame on more than one occa­sion disappoints a K-Mart Catholic like me, I have come to realize that the University of my youth is a constant ... still a Catholic Disneyland that pro­tects its young from thp, world. I can respect that it is an institution that chooses to rarely change, although l am confident that its graduates always change. I remain optimistic because change, cou­pled with a sense of humor, allows good people to opp,n themselves to the colorful world of possibili­ties that lie between black and white alternatives, 
Much water has run under my bridge to the 21st Century, but I can honestly say that humor has sustained me since graduation. Unfortunately, laugher alone does not define the elusive meaning of life. At Notre Dame, educators strive to develop intellect, character and values. Yet, all too often, 
i.n an effort to attain such lofty ideals, individuality is sacrificed for a herd mentality. One will eventu­ally learn in the real world -well beyond our Catholic Disneyland -that diversity and toler­ance am the strengths of our nation. Humor is the thread that ties civilized societies together. 
Good people practice every religion -some have no religious affiliation nor belief. Good peo­ple come in all colors and shapes, from every eth­nic heritage and geographical region. Some fairly good people strictly follow the literal letter of the Churr,h's teachings while other very good people barely agree with the Pope. Politically, good peo­ple are both conservative and liberal, Democrat, Independent, LaRouche and Republkan ­although I personally choose the former two par­ties over the latter! Most importantly, good people respect others, regardless of how repulsive others may seem. 
I find that beneath every good person lies a touch of humor. I also find that humor helps bond societies. How many times have we forgotten an incident, but remembered that we had a good time? How often have we only remembered one thing about a person by saying, "wasn't he or she a lot of fun?" 
The effective commencement speeches this year will be delivered bv those who have humor and believe that the future belongs to the hearts of good people who see color when others see gray. Notre Dame is a wonderful place for personal growth in the area of community service. Advising the Domers of 2000 to serve is preaching to the choir. However, urging this graduating class lo maintain a sense of humor and an open heart throughout their lives may be a tall task for them to undertake. 
After 30 years, I mostly remember the happy, funny times of dormitory life. But, I recollect suf­fering and sadness at the prospect of leaving the comfortable collegiate schedule with the fabulous facilities and diverse activities. I also recall the uncertainties and pressures that contributed at times to my misery. Yet through it all and throughout life after college, I kept humor as my crutch. Consequently, I did not begin acting like a 45-year-old the day after graduation, nor have I hardened like many of my fellow alumni. 
So, to the graduates of this economically won­derful year of 2000, a product of' the Clinton-Gore economy, I offer my best wishes and hopes for you. Thirty years from now in 2030, I hope you will still have a sense of humor and be able to see color while others see gray. I pray that the world will be a. place where ethnic cleansing and hatred of gender, race, heritage, sexual preference and religion does not exist. 
I expect the world -and specifically Notre Dame -to approach the complexities of issues without embracing the barriers of black and white choices. I am confident that, within one generation, our world will become more united in demanding human and equal rights in every cul­ture. A'i a result, I expect the nations of the world to recognize the colors of opportunity from the grays of rigid stagnation. Above all, I believe that 30 years from now, with your help, our nation will face each challenge with open thought. humor and a colorful good heart.

night. . 
Midnight -Bond Hall 
As ·we approach tlw prestigious front steps, what do we hear but ··Boom. boom. boom, boom, I want you in my room'" A large cruv,d of young Archies has lilied thf\ front stairs of tho architecture headquarters. Soon the sounds or "Back that. Ass Up." one man's tribute to his impudent mult>, replace the Boom Boom song. A senior 011 the steps explains the late-night commotion. Apparently. the freshman pro­jects were due the next day. and fifth-year projects due the next week. "It's sort ofa tradition. We're breaking in the freshmen," the senior archie savs. 
"Without release like this, we would go insane:· Dan Pizanello says. 
As ifin reply another voice breaks through, "Less talk. more rock." 
12:07 a.m. -The Huddle 
Burger King looks like a ghost town -the first sign that night is coming. Silent and empty. The result of this abandonment: loads of people are quarter-dogging it. 
"BK is my first choice, but it's closed and I'm running out of flex points," junior P J DuWors reports. 
12:10 a.m. -God Quad 
A giggling couple is neckin' away. That guy must be telling her a really good joke. Wonder what that joke is? It must be dirty 'cause she stopped laughing. 
12:16 a.m. -The Huddle 
Scene approaches a group of guys who are stocking up on quarter dogs. 'Tve been working all day, and my brain's fried," junior Mike Crowe tells Scene. 
The perfect end to a day of studying ... a pair or the steaming hot dogs. 
12:30 a.m. -Fitzpatrick Hall 
Word has it that the engineers have a lounge on the second floor a mutation ofsenioritis." 
"I just want a beer," Andres, tho president emeritus of the lit choir, concludes.

A [\,Jountain Dew bottln collection sits quietly, a testament to tlrn sleepless. bleary eyed nights of Architecture students. Sophomore Diana Reising explains that the sophs are designing "a row house for the Lincoln Park neighbor­hood [of'C:hicagol. It's worth 40 percent of our grade ... and it's due the 29th." 
Despite the imminent pres­sure, the J\rchies are remarkably cheerful and take the extra work in stride. It seems to be agreed that so long as they are going to spend the rest of their lives in Bond, they might as well be cheerful about it. 
"I haven't been in my room for awhile ... like this whole semes­ter!" says sophomore Johnny Maas with a certain amount of pride. 
1:42 a.m. -Lafun Computers 
The lab is half full. One particu­larly stunning croaturc is finish­ing up her Spanish Review Sheet. Her name? Verinique Something­or-othcr. She looks up from her computer and says softly, "Tom­orrow, I'm gonna suffor for iL I ha,·c to be up at 6."

12:35 a.m. -LaFortune 
The basement after midnight consists of both intense crammers and casual socializers. which is interesting. but not exactly out of the ordinary. In the midst of it all, sophomore Elizabeth Emerson plows through her history text. With 100 pages to go, she's remarkably cheerful. "J usually go to the library, but I was looking for a change of pace," she tells Scene. The basement is certainly a change of pace from the library, but not an especially exciting one.

IRISH INSIGHT 
Sports Illustrated inconsistent in criticism of Irish 
Is Notre Dame football dead? 
Sport<; Illustrated seems to think it is. In its issue that came out Thursday, SI spent 10 pages bashing Notre Dame for having academic standards that were too high, playing schedules that were too tough and having a coach described as not "worth a s-" byan anony­mous NFL personnel man. 
Sports Illustrated is blasting NotrP Dame for one thing: hold­ing athletes to a standard equal to that of the nigular student body. 
Is this a bad thing'/ 
Sports lllustrated wags its fin­ger at Notre Dame fur requiring that every freshman football play­er is able to complete the course of study required for all fresh­men. What a novel idea! Making sure that every student-athlete lives up to both the athlete and the student part of his name should not be a rarity in the world of college athletics. 
Rather than asking if Notre Dame football is dead, shouldn't we be asking if college football is dead? 
Notre Dame assistant provost for enrollment Dan Saracino said in the article, "It's not my goal to make the coaches happy." 

v\!hy should it be Saracino's job to make coaches happy? Sports lilustrated has written plenty of articles in the past criticizing schools who let the athlAl.ic department push around profes­sors and academic administrators to let athletes slide academically. In l 998, Sports Illustrated embar­rassed Ohio State with its article about star linebaf'.ker Andv Katzamoyer's joke of a schedule and failing grades. lt also criti­dzed Minnesota for head basket­ball coach Oem Haskins' bullying of admini,;;trators and professors that led to ½ide spread academic fraud by the lvlinnesota basketball team. 
But SI also criticizes Notre Dam~ with its high academic standards for not bowing down to athletic pressure and accepting students that might not be able to hand.le the course load under the Golden Dome. 
According to Sports illustrated, you should lower your standards for athletes so that it is signifi­cantly below that ofthe general student body population, but when those low standards lead to wide spread corruption in your athletic department, you are an evil and corrupt school. Makes sense to me. 
Next Sports illustrated goes after Notre Dame for playing a tough schedule. Maybe playing Texas A&M, Nebraska, Purdue and Michigan State to open 2000 is suicide hut ifyou want to be the best, you have to beat the best. Would a few cream puffs help the Irish win that extra game or tvvo to earu a bowl bid? Probably. But if Notre Dame, or any team i'i really bowl worthy, it will earn i1s bowl bid against quality opposi­ticm. Plus, it is expected that Notre Dame ,!\,ill play a strong opponent every week. For every service academy. thA Irish play a national title contender. vVho did Virginia Tech beat last year'? Miami and ... nobody. Don't get me wrong, Virginia Tech was an excellent football team but give the Hokics a real schedule and the closest they get to the Sugar Bowl is eating some Frosted Flakes for breakfast. 
So playing tough opponents and having high admission standards has caused Notre Dame to fail on the football field according to Sports Illuslrated. Has Nol.re Dame failed or has college foot­ball failed'! 
\-Vhat was the most memorable story from this past seac;on? 
It wasn't Florida State's run to the national title. It was the Seminoles run from the law. Every time you turned around, another Florida State player was getting in trouble with the law and Bobby Bowden was making up an excuse. 
IfPeter Warrick wasn't robbing department stores, Sebastian Janikowski was bribing police officers. Is this what college foot­ball has become? Bowden spent more time thinking up excuses for his goon squad he calls a foot­ball team than he did drawing up plays. 
Felonies and general disregard for the law is rationalized by the Bowden because "Boys will be boys." 
And Seminoles will be crimi-

against the Spartans in only his second game ever at strong safe­ty. 
But now, less than 36 hours later, Driver had Pnough. Enough of the losing. Enough of SV\itcrnng positions. Enough of lhc strin­gent rules and academic standards at Notre Dame. 
So Driver and two friends from Keough drove 250 miles to Louisville, Ky., Driver's hometown, to consult with his mother and guardian, to determine Driver's future. 
"I talked to my boys [at home and at other schools] and they weren't doing any­thing," Driver said of his decision. "I was still adjusting to school, those 10-15 page papers. Here there's just a load, a lot of work you have to do. You're putting in 20 hours of football a week then you come back in your room after you eat at 8 and you're tired. But you've still got work to do. After awhile you get into a routine. But it's hard getting into that routine when you first come in, when you're not used to that type ofwork load." 
That day in September of 1998 was the culmination of Driver's difficult transition from Male High School to Notre Dame. 
Before he came to Notre Dame, Driver was everybody's All-American, the type of player that was atop all the recruiting rankings. He was named first-team USA Today. Parade and Reebok All-American after rushing for 3,460 yards and 48 touch­downs in his high school career. He had the size (6-foot, 200 pounds), the speed (he was the Kenturkv 100­meter state champion as a junior) and the hype to attract the attention of every college pro­gram in the country. 
But despite the accolades, Driver remained the sanie person, the second old­est of five children, the same kid that played freshman ball only three years ear­lier. 
"In high school everyone knew me then all of a sudden, junior and senior year, I was an All-American," Driver said. "But still everyone knew me just as Tony. When I came here no one ever saw me before but every magazine in the world had me as a Parade All-American and that I would be playing every year [at Notre Dame]. So people [here at Notre Darnel were like 'Oh 
Tony'." 
"Freshman year everyone wanted to talk so much football -I wanted to talk about something different, like basketball or baseball, anything other than football. It [the attention] is something you get used to real quick." 
Most people here knew Driver as the crown jewel of new head coach Bob Davie's first recruiting class. They may have even known that Driver spurned Florida State, after giving a verbal commit­Driver's classmate Darcey Levy returning as well as some incoming freshmen. And they knew they needed Driver. one of the team's best athletes. on the field. 

"You hear it [the rumors ot switching to defense] in the papers first," Driver said. "Then the coaches told me about the change a couple weeks before the spring." 
Initially, Driver practiced at free safety but when he came back in the fall he was switched to strong safety. He started the year as a backup to senior Benny Guilbeaux. But when Guilbeaux was hurt in the first 10 minutes of the first quarter against Michigan State, Driver was thrust into the game. His performance was one of the rare highlights in an otherwise dismal performance by the Irish. After the game, a distraught Driver needed time to think, time to consider what had happened in the past year. So he went 
that for 300,000 years and they're going to stay ~!ke that. You've just got to obey them. 
In addition to the suspension, Driver's reputation was now questioned more than ever. Everyone on campus knew of the lat­est transgression. 
And they weren't about to let Driver for­get about it. 
"It was a big distraction," Driver said of the questioning. "I just tried to be Tony, hanging out, going to the pre-game parties but with all the questions it was difficult. I tried to [go to the games]. too but when I went out there I got a thousand questions. So I sat at the end of my couch, watching the games, hollering at the TV." 
It was another obstacle, one he wished he never had to to experience. But nonetheless, a mistake that he was respon­
sible for.

ment, to sign with the Irish. They had read that Driver would be the next great tail­back at Notre Dame, following Vagas Ferguson, Jerome Bettis, Autry Denson and all the others. 
Besides dealing with instant fame on a football-crazed campus, Driver also realized that all the high school hype doesn't translate into guaranteed success on the field. In his first season Driver played behind Denson, carrying the ball just 35 times for 125 yards and three touchdowns. But he was only a freshman, with three more years to fulfill the expectations. 
Then came the spring before his sophomore year when the future star tailback was switched to defense. The coaches decided they were set at tailback with Denson and home. "Last semester every­

Heeding the advice of and off the field. his mom and guardian. Tony Driver Sometimes I felt like I Driver returned to campus free safety never wanted to play 
a few days later, eager to start anew. The next weekend, against Purdue, Driver played the best game of his short career. From his strong safety position, Driver intercepted two of Drew Brees's passes in the last two minutes. His first interception, with 1:39 remaining in the game set up Jim Sanson's winning field goal in a 31-30 Irish victory. 
Driver finished his sophomore campaign fourth on the team with 58 tackles and was the team's most consistent performer on special teams. 
But Driver wanted more, he wanted to get a shot at tailback. With Denson gradu­ating, the position was open. The coaches granted Driver's wish but there were no guarantees of playing time. Last season, Driver shared the tailback duties with Tony Fisher and Julius Jones. He started off the season against Kansas gaining 45 yards on 13 carries. As the season progressed, how­ever, Driver's role diminished as Fisher began to emerge as the top back. 
The Irish were losing, Driver's carries were down but the worst was yet to come. 
During fall break, a few days after a 25­24 victory over USC, Driver was caught breaking parietals. Because he had been warned on more than one occasion, Driver was dismissed from Keough Hall. 
He was also suspended from playing football for the remainder ofthe season. "I knew the rules and I broke them," Driver said. "The rules here have been like 
football again. But I 

fought through it." 
Here Driver is, six months later, trying to piece together the final chapter of his col­lege career. He's back on defense, at free safety, his third position since he came here in the fall of 1997. He's no longer the naive freshman with so much promise. 
"He's done everything we asked," Davie said. "He does so much for your football team when you talk about all the special teams and on defense. He brings a lot to this team. It's good to have Tony Driver back." 
Entering his final season, Driver has some unfinished business. He'll graduate with a degree in sociology in May 2001 and dreams of playing in the NFL. But before he thinks about those goals, he plans on making his mark at Notre Dame, to show that the pre-college expectations were not just hype. 
"Last year was just bad," Driver said. "We want to get to the old Notre Dame [this season], when people were scared to come here, when the fight song was blast­ing, when 110 people on the sidelines were obnoxious." 
Regardless of where he ends up follow­ing next season, the struggles of the past three years have changed Driver. 
"It makes you grow up being at a University that expects so much of you," Driver said. "You see life in a whole differ­entway."

Trojans highlight pack of nation's spring games 
. Palmer throws well in return from broken collarbone 
Associated Pres, 
LOS ANGELES 
Carson Palmer and Malaefou MacKenzie highlighted USC's spring intrasquad football game before an estimated 4,000 at the Col.iseum on Saturday. 
Palmer. who was sidelined for much of tho 1999 season with a broken collarbone, com­pleted J4-of-21 passes for 155 yards and connected with Marcell Allmond for a 17-yard touchdo'½'ll pass. 
l\lacKenzie, coming back from a son> hamstring. rushed for 87 yards on 10 carries. Sophomore tailback Sultan McCullough ran for 26 yards on eight carries and Miguel Fletcher added 33 yards on 11 tries. 
Walk-on junior tailback Mark Gomez had 41 yards on 12 attempts. 
"I'm pleased," USC Head Coach Paul Hackett said. "We're started back on the right track. The offense was sloppy early on, but then we got a rhythm going and put together some nice drives." 
Defensively, senior safety Ifeanyi Ohalete led all players with 13 tackles, and sopho­more defensive tackle Bernard Riley had seven. 

. Saban twists things up, gives media helm in LSU spring game 
BATON ROUGE, La. 
Don't tell LSU head coach Nick Saban that college football coaches are sup­posed to be all busi­ness and can't have a little fun every once in a while. 
For the Spring Football Game Saban has added a new twist, where the media will be given a chance to step into the shoes of the individuals they spend most of their time criticizing. 
Each team will have three members from the print media as assistant coach­es, with a LSU professor serving as the head coach. 
Saban will serve as the commissioner for the game and will turn the tables on the reporters after the game, as he will ask the questions. 
"So if your guy drops a touchdown pass at the end of the game and your 

team loses, I'm going to ask you why did he drop lhe hall," Saban said. 
The LSU seniors will be split up for the game and they will be able to draft their respective teams from the 
remaining players. 
"It's a 'steak and beans' game," Saban said. "On Monday if your team wins you get steak with the team; if you're team loses you get beans." 
Ile said the idea will become an annu­al event, with next year's coaches com­ing from television and the following year coming from radio. 
While tho first-year coach may have been in a lighthearted mood after 
Sophomore cornerback Darrell Rideaux came away with an interc:eption and Matt Childers recovered a fumble. 
"Our defense looked fast and there was some good coverage in the secondary." Hackett said. 
However, USC's kicking game cast a dark shadow over the otherwise impressive showing. 
Sophomore place-kicker David Newburv missed three field goals (a pair of 42-yarders and a 37-yarder) and senior David Bell missed a 31-yarder. 
"I was disappointed iu our kicking,'' Hackett said. "We have a long way to go there." 
In the split-squad scrim­mage, the Cardinal team, led by senior quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst, held on to a 14-10 victory against the White team. 
Van Raaphorst connected with sophomore Steve St1wenson for a touchdown and was 11-of-22 for 95 yards with one interception. 
The Trojans will conclude spring practice on Saturday before opening up the 2000 season against Penn State on Aug. 27 in the Kickoff Classic in East Rutherford, N.J. 
"Everybody wants to play Penn State tomorrow," Pahner said. "But we need some work. It felt good to be out there today. But it will take a while before I get back to the form of last year. I need to get my tim ­ing back. I missed some easy passes today." 
. High school record­holder Walker comes into own for Seminoles 
T ALlAHASSEE, Fla. 
Freshman quarterback Fabian Walker, like most of his teammates, stood exhausted in the middle of the field following his first Garnet and Gold spring scrimmage. His shoulder pads and helmet were unbuckled and unstrapped and both rested on the grass at his feet. 
The quarter­back, who as a 
"This game was good for the young guys to get in there and get some real­time action," Bowden said. "Javon Walker and Kendyll Pope, especially, they really showed they have the ability to play." 
Javon Walker made his bid to be the No. 1 receiver with the loss of Peter Warrick and Ron Dugans to graduation. The top junior college receiver last sea­son, proved why he was as highly tout­ed as he was, second on the Gold team with two receptions for 70 yards as well as scoring one touchdown. 
The other, Pope, 
didn't wait for this 
Wednesday's practice, during the work­out he and his assistants were still work­ing with a group of players who are try­ing to learn a new philosophy. 
Saban said what is ailing his team at this point is the players have not had the ability to execute in game-like situations, which prevents team chemistry from developing. 
"[The player] has to recognize what the situation and formation is," he said. "Then they have to be able to comnmni­cate, apply it and get confidence playing together with each other." 
Saban said having experienced players boosts a team's confidence because those veteran players are not intimidat­ed in tough situations. 
With one receiver, Ed Dangerfield, lost for the spring after last Saturday's scrimmage and two more, Josh Reed and Reggie Robinson, trying to recover from injuries, the Tigers are in desper­ate need for healthy hands. 
"One of the things we haven't been able to keep a lot of continuity in is the receivers," Saban said. "Guys are mak­ing progress, hut we haven't had the continuity I think we need to develop consistency with the quarterbacks." 
He said he has been pleased with the progress of the quarterbacks, as both Josh Booty and Craig Nall faced blitzes 
"So ifyour guy drops a touch­down at the end ofthe game and your team loses, I'm going to ask you why did he drop the ball."

from the defense on Wednesday. 
Saban said anoth­er aspect that wor­ries him is the lack of strength on the defensive line. 
"When you've got so many guys that arc young, inexperi­enced, haven't played and got moved there from 
other positions you just got to let those guys go through a process of develop­ment that they feel comfortable and con­fident in what they are doing," be said.

writers patiently, tirelessly. 
"I feel very good about Fabian Walker," FSU head coach Bobby Bowden said. "It was good to see him out there executing and leading the team down the field. I'm really taken by his ability this early. He just needs to keep on improving." 
"I just want to play," Fabian Walker said. "I just want to get out onto the field and play. I'm going to absorb as much as I can, as fast as I can, to pre­pare me to be ready whenever," 
Although the Seminoles are the reign­ing National Champions, Walker's story is similar to many of those who played in the spring's game -where their level of inexperience matches their desire to play. 
The outcome of the game itself was tertiary, making the 28-28 final score that much more appropriate. Aside from the legendary head coach Hear Bryant's philosophy on ties, the final scrimmage, highlighted by two touch­down receptions from the tight ends and 92 yards rushing by Travis Minor, the spring successfully achieved its pri­mary task: exposure. 
"They have got the 
talent, they're just young," Bowden said. "A lot of the guys are just so young. What they have to do now is learn how to play the position and that will come with experience." 
The group of tackles, led by Kevin Emmanuel and Rian Cason, struggled to establish the same inside presence that became the custom from the now-grad­uated Corey Simon and Jerry Johnson. 
"The key for this team though, wil1 be the offensive line," Bowden said. "We've got great receivers and runners and quarterbacks, but the line is so deep and so talented. I reallv believe that if everything else came· apart, the OL could carry this tean1." 
The line on Saturday provided gaping holes for the backs and solid protection for the quarterbacks. Each team, the Garnet and the Gold, effectively ran the ball because of what at times looked like an overpowering line. 
"But you can always get better on the football field," sophomore running back Davey Ford said. "If you're not always looking and working to get better than you start to get complacent."

Top-ranked Keyplay.com rared its stiffest compPtition of the tournament in No. I fi Sexual Frustration V. but even this opposition could not keep it tou close, as Keyplay advanced with a 21-11 victorv. 
The winning squad of Cas Schneller. Tom Dietrich, Paul Moorf', football player .John Teasdale and varsity basket­ba11 player Jimmy Dillon jumped out to an 11-4 lead, with their only troubles com­ing when they tried too much showboating and slam dunks. T,,asdale and Dillon each scored four in the first half, induding a couple of dunks. 
Dillon opened the second stanza scoring for Keyplay with a one-handed dunk on a fast break. Moore layed in a shot to give Keyplay a 13-5 leact. 
Dillon kicked into overdrive at times, looking like he had forgotten the conqrntition wasn't a Big East foe. His defense looked tough enough to grab a sleal against Uconn·s Khalid El-Amin. However, some of his moves probably wouldn't have flown bv Notre Dame coach Matt Doh-erty as Dillon missed a fancy layup and a fancy attempt to bounce himself the ball for a slam dunk.

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
League sets example with Tigers, White Sox punishment 
Associated Pres. 
Cl-llCAGO 
In what is believed to be the harslwst penalty for a brawl in baseball history, 16 members of the Detro.it Tigers and Chicago White Sox were sus­p e n d e d Thursday for a. total of 82 games. 
"They're trying to set an example fur the rest of the league," \Vh itc Sox manager Ron Schueler said. "I think it will. I think you 're going to see around the league a littlt> more reluctuncc to start tights or get involved with them. 
"I respect the decision," he said. "Don't necessarily agree with it. but I respect it." 
Managers Phil Garner of Detroit and Jerry Manuel of the White Sox WP.re suspended for eight games each for Saturday's two fights at Comiskey Park. Tigers coach Juan Samuel must sit out 15 for throwing punches. 
Detroit third baseman Dean Palmer. who charged the mound after being hit by Jim Parque in the first fight, was suspended for eight games. Parque got a three-game sus­pension. Chicago outfielder Magglio Ordonez was suspend­ed for five. 

White Sox relievM Keith Foulke, who got thA worst of the brawl, needing five stitches tu dose a cut under his left eye, was suspendt>d for three games. 
There were 25 people fined -including the 16 who also received suspensions -rang­ing from $3.000 for Palmer to 
$500 for  Detroit  pitchors  
Danny  Patterson  and  Jim  
Poole."  

"We researched this as best we ·could, and we think this is the largest mass susp1rnsion ever." baseball spokesman Rich Levin said. 
In 'I 998, fights at Kansas City and Yankee Stadium resulted in multip\p suspPnsions. Five players, including Orioles pitcher Armando Benitez, were suspended for a total of 18 games after a wild brawl against the Yankees. 
Two weeks later, nine play­ers and both managers were suspended for a total of 38 games after the Anaheim Angels brawled with the Kansas City Royals. 
Thursday's penalties were the first ones issued by Frank Robinson, baseball's vice presi.­dent of on-field operations. 
"'.'vlajor league baseball wants to send a message ... that par­ticipation in these sorts of inci­dents will be handled in a swift and serious manner," Robinson said. 
"Altercations like the one that took place in Chicago last week show a lack of sports­manship," Robinson said. "It sends the wrong message to 
our fans -particularly young 
people. Fighting is not an 
acceptable part of the game." 
Uecidi11g discipline became 
his rt'sponsibility when com­
missioner Bud Selig dissolved 
tbe president's ol11ce in the AL 
and NL. 
"I didn't. 11xpect that harsh of 
a t.rnatment, I guess you r,ould 
say," Manuel said. "Frank 
Robinson .is a baseball man 
who I have great respRct for. I 
can't dispute his decisions one 
way or the other. 
"I don't agre<' with it. but I 
won't dispute it." 
The p!-rnalties came a day 
before the White So:x were to 
start a series in Detroit. The 
suspensions will bfl staggered 
from Friday night through May 
10 l.Jecause ol' the number of 
players involVPd. 
Some of the players already 
said they will appeal, and the 
penalties would nut take effect 
until appeals have bemi heard. 
"All you can ask !'or is consis­
tent and equal penalties,· 
Detroit general manager Randy 
Smith said. "I think he made 
every effort to do that." 
White Sox reliever Bob Howry anrl outfielder Carlos Lee said their three-game sus­pensions are scheduled to begin Friday. Both plan to _serve them. Ordonez, who said his suspension is to begin May 
1, wants to appiml. 
Though the suspensions 
dredge up the bad feelings 
from the brawl all over again, 
the White Sox said they don't 
anticipate problems in Detroit. 
"They had some concerns 
about the severity of it. And more so about the severity for the other club," Schueler said. "After that, it was another war rally, 'Let's go get 'cm.' We've got a good bu11d1 of kids in that clubhouse. I think tomorrow you'll sflc them come out play­ing bard again." 
Some White Sox wcro ups0t. though, that Detroit starter Jeff Weaver wasn't suspended. Weaver started the bad blood by plunking Lee in tho sixth inning. Ile was done pitching Rnd had his unil'nrm jnrsey off when the fighting began. but he cam·e back out onto the lield. 
Weaver was fined $750. 
"For throwing at Carlos, maybe not," Howry said. "The fact he comes back on the field and the tapes show him fight­ing with Magglio. yeah. he probably should have got.t1rn something." 
The other Tigm·s suspended were: pitcher Doug Brocail

NBA 
Milwaukee Bucks gain first playoff win since 1990 
their offrnsn and shed a Milwauker beat Indiana 104­
:\ssociateJ Press 
decadn of playoff frustration. 91 Thursday night, the Bucks' INDIANAPOLIS Ray Allen and Sam Cassell lirst playoff victory since 1990. Tlw l\lilwaukcw Bucks found scored 20 points apir,cc as The Rucks rvened the b1:st­
of-five Eastern Conference series at one game apiece, tak­ing the home-court advantage away from the rattled Pacers as the first-round series heads tu Milwauker for the next two games on Saturday and Monday. 
The Bucks had lost four straight playoff games to the Pacers. including last year's 3­0 first-round sweep. But the poor shooting in Sunday's 88­85 loss was forgotten in a hurry. The Bucks never trailed, hit 15 of 21 shots in the first quarter, built the lead to 27 points late in the second period and to 31 in the third quarter. 
The Pacers, losing by the largest margin since a 19-point defeat to Chicago in the 1998 conference finals, never caught up. 
Rik Smits, who had 12 points in the first half, was ejected after putting a forearm tu Ervin .Johnson's head as they fought for a rebound midway through the third quarter. Jalen Rose, who had 26 points in Sunday's victory, had only 8 through three periods and 11 for the game. Reggie Miller, the Pacers' clutch player in so many playoff series, picked up three fouls and a technical within one minute late in the third and finished with 10 points. 
Milwaukee, whose last play­off victory was on May 1, 1990, against Chicago, never allowrd the Pacers more than three consecutive points until the final srconds of the second quarter, when two free throws by Rose and a basket by Smits cut the lead to 61-38 at the half. 
A 3-pointer by Allen and a slam dunk by Darvin Harn pushed the lead to 30 points in the first four minutes of the third quarter, then two free throws by Cassell with 7 :29 left gave the Bucks their biggest lead at 75-44. 
Indiana, which has reached the Eastern Conference finals series four of the past six years, cut the lead to 21 points several times late in the third quarter before the flurry of fouls by Miller. 
The Bucks led 88-64 going into the final period. Scott Williams. who finished with 15 points, hit two straight baskets at the start of the quarter to push the lead IJack to 28. 
Austin CrosherP. scornless in the first game, led the Pacers with 16 points. Travis Best, who scored the Pacers' final nine points, added 14. Tim Thomas had 19 for the Bur.ks. 
Lakers 113, Kings 89 
The Los Angeles Lakers' playoff opener was Shaq's Show. Game 2 was Bryant's Time. 
Kobe Bryant, seemingly improving with every game, scored 22 of his earner playoff high 32 points in the first half as the Lakcrs rolled to a victo­ry over the Sacramento Kings and a 2-0 lead in their first­round playoff series. 
Game 3 in the best-of-five series will be played Sunday at Arco Arena in Sacramento, where a fourth game will be played Tuesday night, if neces­sary. 
Shaquille O'Neal, who had 4(, points, 17 rebounds and five blocked shots in the Lakers' 117-107 victory in the opener, had 23 points, 19 rebounds, six assists and three blocked shots in Game 2, and Glen Rice added 18 points. 
The Lakers took command by outscoring Sacramento 16-3 in the linal seven minutes of the second quarter for a 56-41 halftime lead. 
The Kings appeared thor­oughly demoralized before the third quarter was over, and understandably so, considering the Lakers led by as many as 23 points before settling for an 8:1-64 lead entering the final period. 
Chris Webber, who scored 28 points in 27 minutes before fouling out midway through the fourth quarter of the open­er, avoided foul problems in Game 2 and shrugged off a bad start to get 22 points, 12 rebounds and six assists in 42 minutes. 
It wasn't nearly enough. 
Vlade Divac was the only other Sacramento player in double figures with 14 points. 
The Kings were determined to do a better job of blocking out after the Lakers got 25 offensive rebounds in Game 1, but did poorly early.

"IL was really just our determi­nation to keep going al it that won the game,'· Owens said. "It sum wasn't our free throws." 
130th teams had more than their share of chances to win but couldn't capitaliz1\ on free throws or open shots.

Hansen proved key for Versatility. 
"Ross Hansen was on fire. He has been I.he whole tourna­ment,'' Dillon said. "We made it to the finals last year, and I don't see why we can't do that again." 
Rampage had tons of athletic ability with three football players -Arnaz Battle, Gary Godsey and Jim Molinaro -joined by Will Matthews and Torn Juntunen. But they failed to over<'.ome a team used to playing together. 
"Organization hurt us. They've been playing together for the past two years so they were able to make plays," Matthews sairl. "We didn't have another shooter. They were too fast for us." 
FormPr Versatility player Hiltz, who coaches this year's squad, said, "Five basketball players bnai five athletes tonight"

The underdog squad of Charlie McKenna, Dan Irving, Kevin Mclean, B.J. Scott and A.J, Altman couldn't make up for its early scoring drought. 
"In the first half, we just didn't block out I.he way we should have," Altman said. "The thing that killed us was the o!Tensive boards." 
The Torch got within five at 15-11, but. that was as close as it could come. Franchise wasn't too pleased with its perfor­mance, although it won. 
"We tried to get back to play­ing the way we were at the beginning of the year, but we're still not hitting our shots," f,.lcLcan said. "We accepted the easy shots." 
Franchise will face another tough team in No. 6 Ma,jestics, a 
team that held off 11th-ranked Fueled by Hate 21-14. 
The Fueled by Hate team of Matt DeDorninicis, .Jim Moravek, John Lally and Steve Kovatis added varsity basketball player Todd Palmer to their squad, but his help wasn't enough to get the job done. 
"We gave up a lot of offensive rebounds and didn't hit as many shots as we did earlier in the tournament," Del)ominicis. 
Majesties hopes a victory will give it the respect it thinks it deserves. 
"We haven't gotten much respect,"' Justin Heberle said. 
Heberle is joined by Corey llartmann, Peter Hyan, Derek Bautier and Matt Wolbeck on the squad. Majesties has been play­ing together since last year, with only one player different, the addition being Bengal Bouts heavyweight champion Ryan.

Notre Dame's women lacrosse team faces its final opponrmt, 19th-ranhd Rutgers, on Saturday at Yurcak Field in Piscataway, N.J. 
The Scarlet Knights come ofT a 9-3 loss to 16th-ranked Yale on Wednesday in the Yale 13owL The Irish also fell_ to the Bulldogs on April 15, 17-3. Notre Dame has never faced Hutgers. The Irish are 5­9 on the season and the Knights are 6-8. 
"If we play the same way we played [against Columbia and Harvard). Hutgers will be a good game," said head coach Tracy Coyne. 
Knights coach Anna Marie Vesco has compiled a 61-38 record with Hutgers after six years and coached her team to their first-ever NCAA tournament appearance in 1999. Rutgers finished 14-3 last season. 
Rutgers senior co-captain and All­American Liz Chambers leads her squad against the senior-less Irish. ChambP-rs finished with 45 goals and 20 assists in 1999. Like Irish tri-captain Lael O'Shaughnessy, Chambers has reached
