Conflict arises over pets in dortnitories 
By EVA BINDA News Writer 
Beginning last fall, controversy has been brewing in Pasquerilla East Hall because of a ·new resident, hand-chosen by the dorm's rectress, Breyan Tornifolio. The unconven­tional resident is a cocker spaniel dog named Ella. 
Though numerous dorms on campus have pets, Ella's presence in Pasquerilla East caused a slew of problems for three stu­dents -Jacqueline Collins, Catherine Wetten and Lauren Carr -who suffer from allergies. 
Originally placed in the dorm because it is air-conditioned -and thus the best placement for students suffering from severe allergies -the women were left with a tough decision following Ella's debut. They could either stay in Pasquerilla East and deal with recurring health prob­lems or move out of the dorm.

Computer difficulties delay SMC elections 
By MANDl STIRONE News Writer 
Student Class Elections at Saint Mary's have been postponed for the second time as many days because of administrative prob­lems with the computer system students use to vote, Board of Governance members said. 
Students were supposed to vote Monday using Prism -the Saint Mary's Internet program used for various academic processes as well as Student Election voting. Because of recurring problems, voting was pushed back to yester­day and then rescheduled again for today. Students received an e­mail Tuesday from the Board of Governance informing them of the voting difficulties and the pro­cedures that needs to be followed. 
"Elections for class boards have been postponed until [tonight] due to problems with Prism. The survey on Prism has been reset. Voting will start at 12:00 p.m. [tonight] and will last until 11:59 
p.m. [Thursday.] If you have already voted, you must vote again," the e-mail said. 
Elections Commissioner Christin Molnar first noticed problems Friday when she real­ized that the online survey would not be ready in time for the Prism voting to begin Monday. Because of that error, the voting was pushed back to Tuesday, she said. 
The candidates were notified

said she has followed her progress closely in the Senate. 
Plamoottil redefined the Social Concerns committee at the beginning of the year, Brown said, and "she really took the committee and ran with it and has gotten some good things accomplished." 
The selection of Plamoottil fills the top three positions in the student government with women, something that has never before happened at Notre Dame. 
Brown said she is happy to be part of history, but said the choice of Plamoottil was

Students give thanks to donors 
Letters to be written to benefactors 
By STEVE KERINS 
News Writer 

Students are giving thanks today for the nearly $68 mil­lion . received by the University for scholarships this year by partaking in "Thanksgiving in February," an event organized by the Development Office allowing students to personally thank individual donors. 
"'Thanksgiving in February' is basically an event to edu­cate the students to the importance of donors to Notre Dame and to give the students the opportunity to say thank you," said Aly Baumgartner, a member of the Senior Class Gift Committee helping to organ­ize today's campaign. 
From noon to 7 p.m. today, students can stop by the Sorin Room in LaFortune to compose a note thanking Notre Dame's donors for their contributions. The Development Office will post some of the responses on its Web site and make others available in print. 
Throughout the day, seniors on the Gift Committee and Development Office staff members will be on hand explaining the purpose of "Thanksgiving in February" and situating students at computer stations. 
Baumgartner said that the event's timing is not acciden­

The thrill of the fall 
I love the feeling of skydiving. I love the freedom that I get up in the air. 
Jumping's scary. When I jump out of that plane, I struggle to do it at first. I look down and see John Tierney how big the fall can be, and won­der what's the News Wzre worst that can Editor happen. I quickly realize that the worst thing that can happen is something that kind of sucks. I could die. 
But honestly, what are the chances of that? I'm not really sure, but I know that they're pretty slim. I'm much more likely to break something -my leg, my arm, my skull, who knows what else. 
When I first jump out of the plane, I'm scared. I think ... what's going to happen to me? What all can I break? What all will I break? Will I still have a skull? What it still be intact? Will they be able to fix everything I break? 
But then, after a little while, I calm down, which is hard, consid­ering I'm still thousands of feet up in the air and there's still no way of knowing if I will land safely. But I realize that I can't enjoy the sky­diving experience (and, obviously, I'm up there because I want to enjoy it) if I don't just relax and let gravity and my parachute take me away. 
I've taken a risk. It could end badly, but I wouldn't have bothered taking the risk if I thought that it would. I would never have allowed myself to go skydiving in the first place if I thought that I'd die, or if I thought I'd wind up with a bro­Ren skull. So I let myself enjoy the fall, and trust that I will be safe. 
Skydiving is not a sport for the weak. You have to know your bodi­ly limits on earth before you attempt to challenge them in the air. You must be confident in your own skin, on your own surface, before reaching out to the different environment of the vast sky. Otherwise, it's bound to end in a failure of some variety. 
I love skydiving. But I've only done it once. I don't want to go again, even though I can't name an experience I've had that I've enjoyed more. Nothing compares to the excitement I got when I real­ized that I was totally exposed, that anything -for better or for worse -could happen to me when I hit the ground. Nothing compares to the serenity and peace I felt when I realized I didn't care what happened when I hit ground, because the thrill of the fall itself was worth whatever price I might have to pay later with broken limbs (or even with a broken skull). 
Before I went skydiving, I had one love in my life -cookies. Skydiving tripled that number. Now I love skydiving, but, more impor­tantly, I love the ground that I hit. 
Do something you love today.

Janitor spends weekend in courthouse 
POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. ­Think you had a boring weekend? Talk to Harold Jones. The 32-year-old jani­tor spent two and a half days without food, water or access to a bathroom after he was accidentally locked in a secure room at an upstate courthouse. 
Jones was mopping the floor in a meeting room at the Dutchess County Courthouse in Poughkeepsie on Friday night when the door swung shut, locking him in. 
To make matters worse, he had left his cell phone in his coat, which was in another room. 
Jones banged on the door, but no one heard him until yesterday morning, when a county employee found him in the room. 
Even though he was stuck for nearly 60 hours, Jones said he was so upset by his ordeal that he couldn't eat.

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Me111bers to debate, vote on two fiscal arnendJ:nents 
BySONIARAO News Writer 
Student body vice president Bill Andrichik announced Tuesday that two amendments will be debated and voted on tomorrow concerning the fiscal policies discussed during recent Council of Representatives (COR) meetings. 
One of the amendments concerns moving presidential division of the Student Union Board's budget to Student Government's budget. 
The presidential division is a sepa­rate part of the SUB budget set aside for programming that is used by stu­dent government. SUB manager Patrick Vassel proposed that the funds be moved out of SUB budget and into student government fund­ing. 
Andrichik said that the oversight committee has approved the request. 
"The new amendment would require that the student body presi­dent make a formal request for allo­cation to the office of the president budget that would encompass all policy-based programming," he said. 
The second amendment concerns the amount of money groups are able to spend without needing approval. As of now, any expendi­tures over $5,000 need approval, but some groups, such as the Student Union Board, have large budgets and consistently need to spend over $5,000. 
The new plan under the proposed amendment would be a "hybrid model," Andrichik said, with the limit being "five percent of the group budget or $5,000, whichever is high­er." 
In other COR News:

Judicial Council President Liz Kozlow reported that both senior and junior class council elections were suspended due to both senior and junior candidates running unop­posed. The sophomore class council elections resulted in a run-off, which will take place Thursday, she said.

Student Union Treasurer Steve Friend nominated Kadeja Gaines as his successor for the term that begins March 1. 


"Kadeja is qualified, dedicated, and hard-working." Friend said in a recommendation letter to the COR members. 
"As an assistant, she has demon­strated the ambition, drive, and capacity necessary to serve the stu­dent body," Friend said. 
Gaines was approved. 
+ Club Coordination Council President Kerry Kilbourn presented a COR Collaboration Fund Appeal for Disability Awareness Month sponsored by Best Buddies, Perspectives and Sophomore Class Council. Most of the proposed fund­ing is to be spent toward a speaker, Kilbourn said. The event was grant­ed $1,385.

Seminar explores mediause 
BySONIARAO News Writer 

While students in dorm rooms across the country have been influenced by popular Web sites like Facebook.com and YouTube, it isn't always clear if this technology is relevant in the real w~rld. Tonight's New Age Media Seminar at the Mendoza College of Business plans to explore just how sites like MySpace.com have changed the business world and why marketing students should be inter­ested. 
"[The event is] the first of its kind," said Marketing Club President Michelle Brintnall, whose organiza­tion is sponsoring the event. "Right now is one of the most dynamic times for technology. The seminar is designed to highlight infor­mation from both sides of media markets: the compa­nies using the media to gain exposure and the agencies selling them."

North, South Korea resume talks 
SEOUL -North and South Korea held high­level reconciliation talks Tuesday for the first time since the communist nation's nuclear test in October, paving the way for a resumption of aid to the impoverished country. 
The meetings came as North Korea showed strong signs of commitment to its Feb. 13 pledge at international arms talks to shut down its main nuclear reactor within 60 days in exchange for energy aid. 
It has already invited the chief U.N. nuclear inspector to visit to discuss verification of a shutdown. 
North Korea's main nuclear negotiator, Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan, headed for the United States for talks on following through on the landmark deal on dismantling its nuclear weapons program. Kim stopped over in Beijing en route to the U.S., the Chinese foreign Ministry said. 
Hamas not ready to recognize Israel 
MOSCOW -Hamas has pledged to end missile attacks and violence against Israel. Russia's foreign minister said Tuesday, but the radical Palestinian group's spiritual leader struck a less con­ciliatory note, saying it was not ready to recognize Israel. 
With Russia markedly increasing its efforts in Middle East peacemaking, Khaled Mashaal traveled to Moscow for the second time in a year -amid deep Israeli consternation -in a visit that reflected the Kremlin's position that nego­tiations, rather than sanctions, are the best way to deal with Hamas. 
His reception shows that Hamas is gain­ing at least tentative support outside the Middle East.

Officials: Castro era to end this year 
WASHINGTON -Repression is increasing in Cuba under the control of Raul Castro, and the domination of the government by his brother, Fidel, is nearing an end, Bush administration officials said Tuesday. 
"In Cuba, this year will mark the end of the long domination of that country by Fidel Castro," Mike McConnell, the nation's new spy chief, told Congress. 
McConnell, who did not explain his remark, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that significant positive change immediately after Fidel Castro's death was unlikely. He said Raul Castro has had the opportunity to solidify his control in the seven months since his brother~s incapacitating illness last July.

Failed assassination attempt kills 23 
Suicide bomber attacks U.S. military base during visit by Vice President Cheney 
Associated Press 
BAGRAM -In what the Taliban claimed was an assassination attempt, a suicide bomber attacked the main gate of a U.S. mili­tary base Tuesday within earshot of Vice President Dick Cheney. The ·explosion killed 23 people, including two Americans, and deliv­ered a propaganda blow that undercut the U.S. mili­tary and the weak Afghan government it supports. 
The bomber struck about 10 a.m., and U.S. military officials declared a "red alert"· at the sprawling Bagram Air Base while Cheney was rushed to a bomb shelter. Cheney, who had been stranded at the base overnight by a snow­storm, met with President Hamid Karzai in the capital before heading back to the United States via the Gulf state of Oman. 
"I heard a loud boom," Cheney told reporters aboard Air Force Two en route to Oman. "The Secret Service· came in and told me there had been an attack on the main gate."

Plamoottil called the selec­tion of an all-female ticket for president and vice president "long-awaited." 
"I think that it's an awesome accomplishment for women," she said. "I think that we are very capable young women and I think that is great that the student body has elected two women. I am happy and proud to join that team as the third woman." 
Plamoottil said her ideas and her passion for student gov­

"It's a unique job because it's

but with my major and the MCATs, I wasn't able to run," she said. "So this is the next best thing and I think it will be perfect for what I want to do and the passion I've had for student government all my life." 
Plamoottil, a science pre­professional and psychology double major, has been involved in student govern­ment at Notre Dame since she sat on the Freshman Class Council. 
She was a committee chair for the Sophomore Class Council the following year.

IN BRIEF 
Toyota to build new $1.3 billion plant 
TUPELO, Miss. -Toyota Motor Corp.'s Highlander sport utility vehicle should start rolling off the assembly line at a new, $1.3 billion plant in northeast Mississippi by 2010, company and state officials said Tuesday. 
Toyota disclosed the site for its eighth vehi­cle assembly plant in North America, saying it will be built on a 1,700-acre site at Blue Springs, about 10 miles northwest of Tupelo. It also considered sites in neighboring states Arkansas and Tennessee. 
The Mississippi plant will manufacture 150,000 Highlanders a year. It also will cre­ate 2,000 badly needed jobs in an area with an economy that has slowed because of loss­es in furniture manufacturing positions. 
Mississippi officials courted Toyota for two­and-one-half years, mostly out of the public eye. 
"As Elvis would say, 'Only fools rush in,"' Ray Tanguay, executive vice president of Toyota-Motor-Engineering and Manufacturing North America Inc., said dur­ing the company's announcement at Tupelo High School. 

Managers plead guilty to illegal hires 
ALBANY -Five former managers from a major crate and pallet manufacturer that employed illegal immigrants pleaded guilty Tuesday, 10 months after federal agents staged sweeping raids at company sites in 26 states. 
James Rice, 37, of Houston, an executive regional general manager of IFCO Systems, pleaded guilty to conspiring to employ illegal workers. Robert Belvin, 43, of Stuart, Fla., a former general manager of the Albany IFCO plant, pleaded guilty to two felony conspiracy charges. 
The two executives could face up to two years in prison and a $250,000 fine, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tina Sciocchetti said. 
Netherlands-based IFCO Systems NV describes itself as the leading pallet services company in America. It reported $108 mil­lion in profits in 2006 on revenues of $647 million. 



Chrysler will pay off workers 
Company plans to pay up to $100,000 to employees in its recovery plan 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -Chrysler Group will offer all 49,600 hourly workers in the U.S. up to $100,000 to leave the company as part of a recov­ery plan announced earlier this month. 
The company, which lost $1.4 7 5 billion in 2006 and said it expects losses to con­tinue through 2007, said on Feb. 14 that it would cut 13,000 jobs, including 11,000 hourly positions and 2,000 salaried, as it tries to further shrink itself to match reduced demand for its products. 
A company document obtained by The Associated. Press outlines an early retirement program for hourly workers near retire­ment age and a buyout pro­gram for those with at least one year of tenure with the company. 
The offers were reported earlier Tuesday by The Detroit News. 
Under the buyout offer, workers would receive a pretax lump-sum paymflnt of $100,000 plus six months of medical and vision cover­age in exchange for their departure. 
The early retirement package includes a $70,000 payment, health care bene­fits and whatever pension a worker was eligible for based on age and years of service. 
According to the document, the United­Au to-Workers-union and DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler Group agreed on the .offers, which are not as lucrative as some made to workers leaving Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. under restructuring plans. 
"UAW members are once again stepping forward to make hard choices," union President Ron Gettelfinger said in a statement. "Now it's up to DaimlerChrysler to move the company forward, by using the skill and dedi­cation of our members to deliver quality vehicles that customers want to buy." 


The offers come as Chrysler tries to reduce pro­duction by 400,000 vehicles per year. 
All U.S. production work­ers will get the offers, including those at a plant scheduled for closure in Newark, Del. 
Of the production job cuts, 9,000 are in the U.S. and 2,000 are in Canada. All the cuts will take place during the next three years. Chrysler's 10,060 Canadian workers were given sepa­
rate offers earlier this month. 
The company document said that each U.S. facility would have different timing for workers to take the packages, but the timing for plants slated to lose produc­tion this year will be between April and December. Further cuts scheduled for 2008 and 2009 will be done in similar fashion. 
To be eligible for early retirement, workers must have 30 years with the com­pany or be at least 60 years old and have at least 10 years of service, or be at least 55 years old and their age and years of company service must total 85 or more. A worker also could be at least 65 and have at least one year of pension credit to be eligible, accord­ing to the document. 
Chrysler, part of Germany-based Daimler­Chrysler AG, said Feb. 14 that that 11 U.S. plants would be affected by the 
-downsizing. The Delaware plant would closed during the next two years, and Chrysler also plans to cut shifts at plants in Warren, Mich., and St. Louis. 

AT&T call-center able to hire 425 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS-AT&T will hire 425 people for call-center jobs that previ­ously had been outsourced under an initiative to reinvest in the state after a sweeping telecommunications reform bill passed the Indiana Legislature last year. 
AT&T will create the technical sup­port jobs for its national broadband operations at its state headquarters in downtown Indianapolis, George Fleetwood, president of AT&T Indiana, said at a Statehouse news conference Tuesday. 
The union jobs will pay more than $40,000 annually in wages and bene­fits, he said. 
AT&T already has begun hiring man­agers for the call center, but full staffing might not occur until 2009, company spokesman Mike Marker said. The cen­ter is due to start taking calls in July. 

The state will provide up to $1 million 
in training funds and income tax cred­
its, and the city will provide more than 
$279,000 in personal property tax 
abatement to AT&T, which will invest 
more than $4.6 million in new equip­
ment and other upgrades, state and 
local economic development officials 
said. 

The call center jobs previously had 
been outsourced, but AT&T chose to 
bring them back in-house at 
Indianapolis because the passage of the 
telecom reform bill encourages the 
industry to invest in the state, 
Fleetwood said. 
"I think these jobs could have been 
placed anyplace in the country where 
we do business," Fleetwood said. Of 
about 20 states that have tackled · telecommunications reform in the last few years, Indiana has done so most 
comprehensively. 
"We at AT&T believe no one has done it better than Indiana," he said. 
The General Assembly last year approved legislation that frees tele­phone companies from state regula­tions and changes the way the cable industry works. 
Since then, in addition to Tuesday's announcement, AT&T and Verizon have announced they would expand high-speed DSL Internet service to 102 rural communities, and Verizon and Comcast have said they will create 375 new jobs in the state. AT&T last month also launched an Internet television service in Anderson, Bloomington, Indianapolis and Muncie, among just 11 markets nationally, Fleetwood said. 
Gov. Mitch Daniels and lawmakers also have said that Indiana consumers can expect to see lower prices for cable and other services. 
Daniels said AT&T had promised to invest more in Indiana if the reforms passed.

group organizes volunteer adven­ture travel to developing countries, including a bike ride across Cambodia -and has its own chap­ter at Notre Dame. 
PEPYND -a student chapter within the SIBC -assists in fundraisi.ng, research and business planning for PEPY Ride. 
PEPYND put itself on the map in December by hosting its first fundraising dinner in an effort to collect $20.000 to build a second school in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. 
Last night's dinner represented the group's attempt to raise the last $1,000 needed to fund the school. 
"I tmly believe that people have taken an interest in our initiatives," said junior PEPYND member Allio;;on Fleece. "And we've made it pretty clear that they are support­ing a good cause by attending this dinner." 
Attracting an overwhelming number of student supporters, part of the organizer's intent was to help the community become aware of the situation in Cambodia. 
"Our overall goal is to increase the quality and breadth of educa­tion in an underdeveloped country like Cambodia, where 75 percent of the children do not even complete the seventh grade," said Tim Rann, PEPYND president. 
When the doors opened at 6 p.m., the line wrapped around the lV lounge outside the Sorin Room, and continued to augment for the next 45 minutes. 
Luckily for PEPYND members, the turnout was more than expect­ed. 
"This has been an incredible turnout," said senior Christian Kondratowicz. "We were already mnning out of food within the first half hour." 
While the long wait for a Thai/Cambodian meal may not have seemed appealing for stu­dents, there were other incentives to attend the dinner as well. There

and everything was set up for the delayed election, but the prob­lems continued once voting began. Molnar said she received several phone calls from con­cerned students who were able to log onto Prism, but were unable to find the survey to vote. 
She said that due to the amount of students facing this problem, the elections were stopped and moved to today. Those in charge said the root of the problem is still unclear. 
Though many students were not too bothered by all the confu­sion, many candidates are begin­ning to get impatient. 
''I've been very frustrated with the delays and the way it has been handled administratively," said Jennie Antonelli, one of the junior presidential candidates. 
Many of the candidates feel that they are putting a lot of effort was an abundance of information about PEPYND-organized trips to Cambodia. 
"I knew there would be pam­phlets containing information about volunteering one's Spring Break or Winter Break in Cambodia," said sophomore Brian Hamamoto. "So I decided to put my name on the list they had for inter­ested studenl'>." 
Thi'> Spring Break, Hann will be accompanied by nine other PEPYND members to oversee the building of this school in Phnom Penh. Hann says that during the trip, the tc~am will be lilming a doc­umentary so that the Notre Dame patrons can "see their money put in action." 
"We're encouraging students interested in joining PEPYND or who wio;;h to travel in the future to 
explore  our  Web  site  
www.nd.Pdul-trann  - for more  
information," he said.  

PEPYND is eovnring new ground to stimulate economic rede~Plop­ment in Cambodia in addition to vocational purposes by working on the Independent Travelers Database project, which encour­ages tourisl'> visiting Cambodia to stay in hotels or eat in restauranlo;; run by Cambodian families. 
"Travelers often stay or eat in chains owned by foreign eorpora­tions, so it doesn't direetly benefit the Cambodian economy," said Hann. "Howevor. through this proj­ect, which will become available soon on a Web site, we will provide information to travelers about Cambodians who might have invested their lilfl savings into oper­ating a hotel or restaurant, and so they can take advantage of those venues." 
The Street Friends Cafe in Phnom Pehn -which is run com­pletely by street children in Cambodia -is another project supported by PEPYND. Working in the cafe or the beauty salon next door, the childnm serve as waiters, cooks, and stylists, ·and in return are provided with housing, educa­tion, and spending money. 
"It's a great project to help ehil­
into something that is resulting in more and more setbacks. 
"Basically it's just been a real frustration we just wasted so much time preparing for the 'next election' that's happening, we put in a lot of time and efibrt into going door to door and trying to get everyone to vote," said sophomore Taryn Pabst. Antonelli's rwming mate. "It's just frustrating because we're not sure if it's even going to happen tomorrow." 
Even those who are running unopposed are bothered by the setbacks and sympathize with the upcoming juniors' frustrations. 
"It's kind of inconvenient for everybody to vote," said fresh­man presidential candidate Emily Young, who is running unop­posed.

Mayor stalked at apartment 
Newsom 'alarmed and concerned' after San Francisco man's actions 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO -A man talked his way into Mayor Gavin Newsom's apartment building late one night before a doorman called police, according to state­ments that helped persuade a judge to issue a temporary restraining order. 
Han Shin, 42, told the doorman around 1 a.m. on Feb. 15 that he was visiting a woman who lived there. The woman said she didn't know him, according to the door­man's declaration. 
Shin then showed the doorman pictures of himself with Newsom and another of Newsom standing next to an Asian man wearing only a diaper, and asked if Newsom was home. The door­man said he was not, and Shin left as the doorman called police. 
The next day, police got a war­rant to search Shin's car. Inside, they found a city map with the mayor's apartment building highlighted, a cutout composite photograph of the mayor, Shin and Shin's father and material labeled "President Newsom," according to court papers. 
On Feb. 10, Shin sat in the front row at a meeting held by Newsom and appeared to be tak­ing photographs of the lower half of Newsom's body, according to a statement from a member of the mayor's security team. 
Newsom's jacket fell off a chair and Shin picked it up, wiped it ofT gently and held it on his lap, according to court documents. Afterward, he grabbed the mayor and prevented him from closing his car door until a police officer intervened. 
Newsom told police Shin has long shown his support and often attends public meetings, but he had been behaving bizarrely lately. The mayor "is alarmed and concerned about Shin's attempt to get to his apartment," according to court records. 
Reports of Shin's actions come amid Newsom's recent headline­grabbing personal problems. Earlier this month, the mayor acknowledged an affair with his campaign manager's wife and began treatment for alcohol abuse. 
Shin did not have a listed phone number and could not immediately be reached for com­ment Tuesday. But KNTV-TV reported that Shin called its newsroom Tuesday to speak out against the allegations. 
"Everything is a lie. I feel vio­lated," Shin said. "Do not judge people from bits of information that you hear. Everybody's going to feel like a fool when they real­ize the truth, what really hap­pened, that I was not stalking him." 
Shin was charged in November with making criminal threats against two family members and a police officer, false imprison­ment and obstructing a law enforcement officer, according to the Alameda County district attorney's office. In November 2003, he was charged with obstructing a police officer. Those cases are pending. 
A hearing on the restraining order, which was issued Feb. 21, was set for next week. 

Ne-w York steriod sales network investigated 
Associated Press 
ORLANDO, Fla. -A New York prosecutor said athletes and celebrities were involved as cus­tomers of an illicit steroid sales network that produced arrests of four company officials on Tuesday. 
However, Albany County District Attorney P. David Soares declined to name anY, consumers. He said his office was not investigating patients, but alleged producers and distributors, including doctors and pharmacists. 
"I understand that the involve­ment of athletes and celebrities makes this a sexy story, but I assure you we are not, at this point, we are not concerned with the celebrity factor," Soares said. "Our focus here is to shut down distribution channels." 
Soares was in Florida on Tuesday for two pharmacy raids conducted by federal and state agents at two Signature Pharmacy stores. Four company officials, including a married couple who are both pharmacists, were

arrested. They were charged with criminal diversion of prescription medications and prescriptions, criminal sale of a controlled sub­stance and insurance fraud. 
Soares refused to answer most questions about the case, which involves sealed indictments. 
"I cannot elaborate any more and I cannot provide you with any more details without compromis­ing an investigation which even at this point is at a very sensitive stage," he said, 
The Times Union of Albany, N.Y., first disclosed the steroid investigation in a report citing unidentified sources. The newspa­per said investigators found evi­dence that testosterone and other performance-enhancing drugs may have been fraudulently pre­scribed over the Internet to cur­rent and former Major League Baseball and NFL players, college athletes, high school coaches, a former Mr. Olympia champion and another top contender in the bodybuilding competition. 
Customers include Angels out­fielder Gary Matthews Jr., accord­ing to the Times Union, which cited unidentified sources with knowledge of the investigation. 
Angels spokesman Tim Mead told The Associated Press the team was aware of the story, adding, "That's the only informa­tion we have." 
Mead said manager Mike Sciascia told Matthews about it, and that general manager Bill Stoneman and Mead spoke to Matthews. 
"We strongly recommended that Gary inform his agent and make sure he's aware as well," Mead said. "The information is sketchy at best." 
The paper said a New York investigator flew to Pittsburgh last month to interview a physician for tl1e Pittsburgh Steelers about why he allegedly used a personal cred­it card to purchase roughly $150,000 in testosterone and human growth hormone in 2006. 
The physician, Richard A. Rydze, told the investigator the drugs were for his private patients, the paper said, citing an unidentified person briefed on the interview. 
There are no allegations Rydze violated any laws. 
Steelers spokesman Dave Lockett told the AP that Rydze works for the club mostly on game days. He is listed among the seven doctors under the "medical staff' designation on the official team employment roster. 
"We can't comment any further because we are still gathering information," Lockett said. 
A message was left seeking comment from Rydze. 
Arrested on Tuesday were Stan and Naomi Loomis, who own the Signature Pharmacy in downtown Orlando, Stan's brother Mike Loomis and Kirk Calvert, Signature's marketing director. Soares' office identified Signature as a "producer" of the illegally dis­tributed drugs. 
Also arrested as a result of the New York investigation were three people Soares' office described as "distributors" from a Sugarland, Texas, company called Cellular Nucleonic Advantage. 
Before the investigation is com­plete, Soares' office said, up to 24 people could face charges, includ­ing six doctors and three pharma­cists. 
The Loomis' downtown phar­macy contains a small retail store that sells bodybuilding supple­ments, a drug laboratory and executive offices.

Over the past two weeks it has been nearly impossible to find a news station that was not reporting the latest updates on the Anna Nicole Smith death or dis­cussing new possible reasons as to why Britney Spears buzzed her head. Although somewhat interesting and often times comical, celebrity news deserves no spot in the fwening head­lines. There are more relevant and demanding events happening in the world than trying to decide who is Anna Nicole's baby's daddy, and we must cre­ate a demand for pertinent current afl'airs in our daily paper and primetime

Buzzworthy 
news before it is too late. 
By now, we are all well aware of the 
possible causes of death of Anna Nicole 
Smith. Not only is there debate over her 
cause of death, but also the location of 
her burial. The father of her child is still 
a hot topic of discussion, and remains, 
20 days later, to be headline news. 
Consequently, foreign affairs and 
political matters have fallen to the way­
side and lly under the public radar. The 
fact that the Iraqi president is contro­
versially ill and hospitalized hails in 
comparison to the controversy regard­
ing Jennifer Aniston and her reportedly 
new nose. If the President in Iraq is in 
fact on his deathbed, the United States' 
ongoing struggle in Iraq just grew expo­
nentially worse, which means more 
death for soldiers and civilians alike. 
The consequences of Jen getting a 
nose job, however, are obviously more 
important to the American public. And 
the fact that Britney is committing acts 
of mass destruction to her appearance 
(and her career) is far more important 
that the threat of destruction and death 
in the newfound Al-Qaeda operation in 
Pakistan. And this is all according to 
"The Today Show" and CNN, not 
"Entertainment Tonight" and the TV 
Guide Channel as one would expect. 
It is not breaking news that entertain­
ment is what sells, but consumers 
should not buy into entertainment as 
our breaking news. For some reason, 
we all enjoy hearing about the latllst 
celebrity gossip: who is dating whom, 
who is gaining weight, and who cheeked 
into rehab. Our culture thrives on this 
information, and, as a result, the news 
media have succumbed to our obses­
sion. We are thus sadly left recognizing 
the names "TomKat" and "Brangelina" instead of Zawahri and Talabani. 

And we at Notre Dame cannot escape the epidemic. Students seem to be more concerned about the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's conflict than the ongoing, deadly conflict in the Middle East. Our igno­rance of worldly affairs will lead to not only our personal downfall, but the downfall of the country as well. The stu­dents of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's hold the key to our nation's future, and if we cannot even recognize our igno­rance and strive for a change, the hope for a better future is bleak. 
Pretty soon, the lack of public aware­ness of current events is going to take its toll. The threat of global warming and the ongoing conflict Iraq have man­aged to fall through the cracks, and those are the issues that have way more of an efl'ect on our lives, definitely more so than who won the Oscar Sunday night. If we do not start holding the media responsible for providing us with substantial, significant information, the welfare of our country will plummet. As citizens, we need to be well informed so that we can make better decisions in our daily lives, elect political leaders that will provide the best well being for their constituents, and exercise our freedom of speech so that we may have a voice in public policy. The sooner we start acting like responsible citizens, the sooner buzzworthy will refer to signifi­cant news rather than Britney's new 'do.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 

Speech should be free but genial 
The issue of censorship and freedom of speech has been the subject of fervent debate on campus and in the Viewpoint of late. Questions have arisen of whether cer­tain cartoons should be published in The Observer and also of whether certain plays, such as the "Vagina Monologues" and "Loyal Daughters" have a rightful place on this campus or not. As Americans, we have been trained since grade school to quote our Constitutional rights and the "freedom of speech" rights derived from the First Amendment are the ones most often quoted. The mantra is, "It's a free country, and I can say or print whatever I want," and of course, I must be grateful of this reality, because these very words of mine have not been cen-1 sored. 
Yet, what does freedom of speech really mean? It is true that in America, unlike other repressive regimes such as the Communist U.S.S.R., the government cannot restrict the speech and publications of its citizens (with some exceptions, like child pornography). But this is a restriction upon the government, not upon the editors of newspapers or upon the authors of plays or comic strips. Would it not be equally oppres­sive for the government to require that newspapers publish everything submitted to them, taking away their power of self cen­sorship? 
In the case of The Observer, the recent let­ters asking that it make the editorial deci­sion not to publish certain cartoons do not breech the First Amendment. Their request is that an independent newspaper censor itself and tighten the standards for what it publishes. No doubt, if The Observer fea­tured articles or cartoons lampooning African-Americans, Jews, or homosexuals in a mean-spirited way, members of those com­munities would be upset and call upon the paper to censor itself in the future. 
Yet, does this mean that The Observer should only publish articles or cartoons por­traying the Church in a favorable light? No. The paper and the University should remain an open forum of debate, facilitating the exchange of opinions and teachings, this being the hallmark of any great intellectual institution. We must be free to debate whether there is any truth to be known, and if there is, what it is and how it affects our lives. That is what academic freedom is all about and what Oliver Wendell Holmes means by "free trade in ideas... in the com­petition of the market" (Jake Vos, "Paper should uphold 'free trade of ideas,"' Feb 27). 
But in order for it to remain an open mar­ket, all ideas and viewpoints must have the freedom to be heard and no side must become so belligerent as to do violence to other points of view. Thus, those in favor of the Church's views must make their cases without being self-righteous, judgmental, or insulting. Likewise, those who offer view-. points different from those of the Church should be free to air their opinions at Notre Dame and in The Observer, but also must be polite and genial. Freedom of speech does not mean the right to be as nasty and brutish as one can, but rather the right to speak one's piece in such a way that will fur­ther the dialogue, seeking to persuade the opposition and not simply taking a cheap­shot at them. 
Chris Spellman senior off campus Feb. 27 

'Monologues' not only· gender issue 
While many of us on the Notre Dame campus had mixed feel­ings regarding the debates about the "Vagina Monologues," aca­demic freedom and Notre Dame's Catholic character last year, I think it's important not to see the "Vagina Monologues" as the only response of the campus community to the admitted difficul­
. ties of gender relations here at Notre Dame. 
Personally, I find it sad that the move of the "Vagina Monologues" off campus this year made the front page of The Observer while there was no mention of the Edith Stein Project, a student-run conference that addresses difficult issues of gen­der (rape, abortion, etc.) in a context that seeks to integrate femininity, intelligence, and Catholic identity. 
There were many big nam.es from the ranks of the national Catholic community, women like Jennifer Roback Morse, Janet Smith and Dr. Pia de Solleni, who have successfully reconciled their identities as women with their identities as Catholics. They have managed to do so without ignoring the difficult issues that face women, and they have done so without rejecting men. If anything came out of this year's Edith Stein Project, it is the need to see all of us, men and women, in our integrated human identity. That integrated identity is relational, and we cannot exile one sex or the other and hope to remain healthy and whole ourselves. 
I found it very affirming that Edith Stein organizers included a talk on pornography given by two male undergraduates, Jack Calcutt and Patrick Tighe, who bravely explored the difficult issues of male sexual transgression here on campus but did so in a way that invited dialogue and mutual vulnerability between men and women. Isn't this what we're all trying to do on cam­pus? 
Similarly, in this year's production of "Loyal Daughters" there were segments that explored male-on-male sexual assault, and female-on-male alcohol-induced rape. Gender relations on this campus will never improve until we all, male and female, start admitting our own sins toward each other and work for healing, forgiveness and change in Christian charity.

Notre Dame to host Genocide Film Series 
Films include Oscar winners and powerful documentaries 
By MARTY SCHROEDER Assistant Scene Editor 

With militant combat stories emerging out of Darfur, UN rulings concerning the massacre at Srebrenica, Bosnia and other terrible events happening in various parts of the world, genocide has become a topic our generation must face -not only cur­rent atrocities but also those of the past. 
As we struggle to grapple with the horrif­ic capabilities of mankind's violence against itself, filmmakers have offered their inter­pretations on the consequences of war. Their films offer peace in some cases, sol­ace in others or sometimes merely graze the topic, offering more questions than solu­tions to the problem. 
In an attempt to further explore the themes and ideas necessary to end geno­cide, the Genocide Film Series will be screened at the Browning Cinema of the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center (DPAC) this weekend. This event -subtitled "On Our Watch?"-showcases some of the best explorations of genocide that (the) cinema has to offer. These include a wide range of entries, from Oscar winners to relative unknown films, all powerful and important in their own way. 
"The Last King of Scotland" (2006) 

Starring Forest Whitaker, who won the Best Actor award at the 79th Academy Awards last Sunday, this is the highest pro­file film in the series. Whitaker's darkly mesmerizing performance as the complex Idi Amin, the de facto dictator of Uganda from 1971-79, led critics to hail the film as one of the year's best. 
But it's Whitaker's recent Oscar win ­against the likes of Peter O'Toole, Leonardo DiCaprio, Will Smith and Ryan Gosling ­that has drawn even more attention to the headlining film in the Genocide Series. "The Last King of Scotland" will show March 3 at 7 p.m. and March 4 at 1 p.m. 
"Shake Hands With the Devil: The Journey of Romeo Dallaire" (2004) 
This 2004 documentary is based on a book of the same name by now-retired Lieutenant-General Romeo Dallaire, com­mander of the United Nations forces that served in Rwanda during the 1993-94 genocide. Dallaire implored the UN for more troops but was ultimately denied. However, his actions are credited for saving approximately 20,000 lives. The film was nominated for two documentary awards during the Sundance Film Festival. "Shake Hands With the Devil" will show March 4 at 4p.m. 

The setting Cambodian sun makes for a striking image in the 1984 film "The Killing 
Fields," which showed the genocide the Khmer Rouge regime committed there.

System of a Down has a personal connec­tion to the Armenian genocide. The grand­father of System of a Down's frontman, Seij Tankian, is a survivor of the conflict and plays an integral part in the film. 
The film also employs Harvard University Professor Samantha Powers and other experts as part of an effort to point the fin­ger of blame not just at the traditional cul­prits but also at the United States for its seeming neutrality in regards to genocide. "Screamers" will show March 2 at 7 p.m. 
"Night and Fog" (1955) This documentary was filmed in 1955 at the Auschwitz concentration camp in 
especially the hate 
that motivates horrific killings like that of the Jews at Auschwitz. The film takes its name from Adolf Hitler's "Night and Fog" (Nacht und Nebel) direc­tive, one that facilitated the brutal execution of political prisoners in Germany and the territories occupied by the Nazis during World War II. It contains graphic footage of the conditions at Auschwitz and is one of the most poignant examinations of 20th century genocide. "Night and Fog" will show alongside "Shake Hands With the Devil" on March 4. 
"The Killing Fields" (1984) 
This British film is about the actions directed by the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia. The story is told through the eyes of three journalists -Dith Pran, a Cambodian, Sydney Schanberg, an American and John Swain, a Briton. This picture, directed by Roland Joffe, won three Oscars and stars Sam Waterston and John Malkovich. The 1OOth greatest British film according to the British Film Institute, it is an excellent look at the war in Cambodia, which is often overshadowed by the U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The geno­cide instituted by Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge is thought to have contributed to the deaths of over 

1.5 million Cambodians. This award winning frlm about an often­overshadowed tragedy will show March 2 at 10 p.m. 
"No Man's Land" (2001) 
This Best Foreign Language Oscar-winner depicts two soldiers, one Bosniak and the other Serb, who find themselves alone in a trench during the Bosnian War. With no other avenues available, the two trade insults and also find common ground in an interesting mix of irony and futility. The United 
Nations, ordered to remain neutral in the conflict, must bring aid to these wounded soldiers after an 
American journalist brings media attention to their situation. To further complicate matters, another Bosniak soldier awakens near the first two only to discover himself on top of a landmine that will explode if he moves. 
The worst of the killings in the Bosnian War took place in the region of Srebrenica, located within the nation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many sources say that over 8,000 men were killed in this region alone. Recently, the International Court of Justice ruled that Serbia is not to blame for the genocide that occurred during the war. Thanks to this ruling, this film has become especially important in the discussion of international jurisdiction and what the spe­cific definition of genocide is. "No Man's Land" will show March 3 at 10 p.m. 
Each film in this series brings something different to the forefront of the discussion on genocide. Whether big, dramatic narra­tives or more realistic, probing documen­taries, they all cause viewers to reflect on the nature of human life and the costs of taking it. 
The Genocide Film Series is sponsored by the Nanovic Institute for European Studies, the Notre Dame Holocaust Project, the Center for Social Concerns and the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center.

By RAMA GOTTUMUKKALA and 
SEAN SWEANY 
Scene Critics 
Rama: Magic is an art form built around misdirection. In film, its first cousin is the thriller, a genre where, like a fragile deck of cards, deceitful twists and turns are layered one on top of the other. 
With his 2006 film "The Prestige," direc­tor Christopher Nolan melded the two pursuits together in hopes of conjuring the greatest magic trick the cinema had ever seen. The result is a superb film about the devotion of two illusionists to their craft, and the darkness that drives them to pur­sue their great triumphs. 
At the heart of "The Prestige" lies a rivalry between two Victorian era stage magicians, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). Angier is the more gifted showman but he lacks Borden's ingenuity and passion for creat­ing new tricks. When his wife Julia (Piper Perabo) drowns after a water tank illusion goes awry, Angier is inconsolable and blames Borden. A friendship built upon a mutual admiration dissolves, replaced by a vindictive, near murderous, need to trump the other's skill. 
What Borden and Angier fail to realize is that between the two of them, they share the two greatest gifts a magician can have -creativity and showmanship, respectively. A truly great illusionist lacks neither one. But instead of pooling their talents, the two men waste much of their professional and personal lives on a much darker obsession than magic -each other. 
The very first line of the film ­Borden's, "Are you watching closely?" ­is more than a plea. It's a dare to us, the audience, to outwit two very clever men -brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan, who shared the writing duties on this film. 
With the film's recent release on DVD, it becomes increasingly clear just how often the Nolans dangle the secrets to the film's puzzle in front of our noses. Small snip­pets of conversation, a look from one periphery character to another and sub­tleties in the performances of Bale and Jackman are the crumbs left by the two writers. 
Films like "The Prestige" are made to he watched and rewatched, savored for the way they pull a steady curtain of decep­tion over our eyes. Smart, stylish and sly, it deserves its place alongside gems like "The Usual Suspects," "The Sixth Sense," "Fight Club" and Nolan's own "Memento" -four of the cleverest thrillers (and best films) of the last decade. 
Sadly, like a true magician, Nolan refus­es to reveal many of his secrets on this single-disc DVD. Most conspicuously, there's no commentary track by Nolan, who previously recorded ones for "Following," "Memento" and "Insomnia." In general, the special features are sparse, which is a shame because "The Prestige" is more than a simple parlor trick. The film also works as a sumptuous period piece. It glamorizes the routinely dull Victorian era, a time when magic was bowing out to an even-greater power ­science. . 
"The Director's Notebook," a 19-minute featurette, is a collection of interviews and footage behind the set where Nolan is joined by Bale, Jackman, cinematograph­er Wally Pfister, production designer Nathan Crowley and other members of the crew. The feature is brief but informa­tive, and it's hard not to come away with an appreciation for how much thought went into the film's careful set and cos­tume design and its dark, moody, and often beautiful look. 
The only other feature is "The Art of The Prestige," a gallery of production stills, posters, costumes and sets, all arranged in slideshow fashion. It's a fun addition but is often the most-lightly regarded extra on much grander releases like the superlative "Lord of the Rings" extended editions. Here, it seems like more effort was spent on the DVD's charming and elegant menu system than the special features that system houses. 
Fortunately, the movie itself looks and sounds great. With deep, rich colors and a sharpness to the film's many hazy and dimly-lit scenes, the video, especially, is near-reference quality. 
Twenty minutes into "The Prestige," Bale reveals one of his tricks to a wide­eyed young fan. He warns the hoy, "Never show anyone. They'll beg you and they'll flatter you for the secret, hut as soon as you give it up, you'll be nothing to 'em. 
"The secret impresses no one. The trick you use it for is everything." 
After successfully pulling off a fantastic sleight of hand with this film, it's unfortu­nate to see Nolan follow his own charac­ter's advice for the DVD. 
Sean: Audiences face a conundrum when it comes to magic tricks. On one hand, there is a strong desire to know how magicians accomplish their fantastic tricks, but on the other, this knowledge spoils the fun of the trick, which might be off-putting for some audiences. 
"The Prestige" sets itself up as a movie that aims to maintain the illusion of the magician's world while also unraveling it for audiences through its narrative struc­ture -a conflict in terms that hurts what should otherwise be a superb film. 
From the beginning, "The Prestige" has a lot going for it. A plot about rival Victorian-era magicians constantly trying to outdo one another in their obsession­driven pursuits of love, power and fame is inherently exciting. Christopher Nolan ­well respected for films such as "Memento" and "Insomnia" -directs an all-star cast including Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlet Johansson and Michael Caine (a veritable "Batman Begins" reunion), another reason for film fans to rejoice. 
Jackman and Bale play well off each other, creating characters whose obses­sions appear real and believable. Of the two, Bale is the better actor, and this is manifest in his character, whose appear­ance onscreen belies a deep, emotional, human element -as Bale's characters usually do. 
The supporting cast of "The Prestige" is phenomenal, with Michael Caine, David Bowie and Andy Serkis headlining the group. Johansson is limited mostly to role of eye-candy, but she does not try to exceed these bounds and her acting accordingly complements that of her fel­low actors. 
In addition to all these positives, 'The Prestige" is a beautiful film to watch. Nolan and his production crew take advantage of the visually appealing Victorian age as a setting, creating a rich, textured world for viewers to pore over with their eyes. 
So, with all of these redeeming qualities, what causes the DVD release of "The Prestige" to fall short of the mark? 
The answer basically comes down· to the film's storytelling. Nolan's plan in making the movie was to create a mystery within a mystery, and in order to do this effec­tively, the narrative of the film must make frequent jumps between various times and places. This is largely accomplished in two sections of the movie where the magicians, Angier and Borden, learn cer­tain facts that further the plot by reading the diary of the other. · 
While a good idea in theory, Nolan's execution of this technique is clumsy and confusing. Viewers can spend more time trying to figure out how the narrative is working than they can spend enjoying it, which is not a good sign. One tagline for "The Prestige" recommended multiple viewings, presumably for enjoyment, but these could be necessary just to under­stand the convoluted storytelling. 


It is a shame that the method of story­telling has such glaring flaws, for the rest of the film itself is exceptional, especially when compared to its contemporaneous competitor, 'The Illusionist." The potential here was high, but Nolan miscalculated his approach to the film and did not achieve that potential. 
Nevertheless, "The Prestige" is an entertaining, if not great, film and deserves better treatment than it has received on DVD. Two, yes, two special features fill out the disc to give fans a peek into how the film was made.These features are insightful and well done, hut their brevity and paucity detracts from the experience they begin to promise. Finally, an inconsistent sound quality during the film perhaps indicates a lack of studio effort in putting together the DVD for 'The Prestige." 
Overall, the DVD of "The Prestige" is a very mixed package. Excellent plot, act­ing, directing and set design exist in a confusing method of storytelling and on a single-disc DVD that is painfully light on special features. This ultimately makes for an entertaining rental that disappoints because of what it could have been.

A closer look at the other side of the Oscars 
Alright, I'll say it. I'm glad the Oscars are over. I'm glad they won't roll around for another year. The reason is that the cere­mony that should ostensibly and ideally hand out awards for achievement in various areas offilm has become so noticeably political and hype-driv­en that it has lost its charm, its prestige and its credibility. 
There are several examples from this year's Oscars that make this point painfully clear. 

Take Forest Whitaker's Best Actor win for his role in "The Last King of Scotland." By all accounts, Whitaker had locked up the award many weeks before the little statue was handed to him on Sunday night thanks to the press he received for the film. For a film that enjoyed very limited release, it would have been dif­ficult for many of the 6,000 Academy voters to see and judge Whitaker's acting. Rather, news stories ran ceaselessly about Whitaker's onscreen talents -a surefire way to goad an Academy voter into choos­ing Whitaker as the year's best actor with­out having seen the film. Whitaker's acting may be superb -I have yet to see the film -but it seems that any excellence was pro­liferated more through studio hype than by people actually seeing the film. 
"The Departed" is another film whose pedigree may have earned it more praise than it may have deserved ..For all "Departed" lovers out there, let me say that I loved this film. It was fantastic. But the conflation of two stories -the greatness of the film and the fact that Martin Scorsese, who had never won an Oscar for directing, helmed it-made me ask a question. Was it a foregone conclusion that Scorsese would win the Oscar for directing and his film would win Best Picture by association? 

Let me put it this way: ifStephen Sommers -the director of the awful "Mummy" films and the even more abom­inable "Van Reising" -had directed "The Departed," would it have received so much attention to win the Oscars for directing and picture? Probably not. 
The point here is that actors, directors and films can receive unfair benefits or dis­advantages based on their name, associa­tion or particular marketing campaign. 
Take for example, Johnny Depp's Best Actor nomination in 2004 for playing Captain Jack Sparrow in Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest." IL'l hard to deny that his performance was bet­ter than any of his competitors from that year, including Sean Penn (who won) for "Mystic River" or Bill Murray for "Lost in Translation." But this was quirky Johnny Depp, acting in a popcorn-munching, effects-laden, summer blockbuster Disney movie. There was no chance that the Academy would deem him (and the movie as a whole) worthy of one of their awards. 
The situation is somewhat akin to the Reisman Trophy award in its convoluted nature. In 2005, Reggie Bush won college football's biggest honor because he was the best player on the team everyone believed to be the best in the country. Nevermind that Vmce Young was more talented, a bet­ter leader on his team and ultimately more deserving of the award. Bush's highlights saturated the ESPN family of networks, he and USC were media darlings and the result, as they say, is history. 


The Academy Awards seem like they could be falling victim to this predicament of allowing the media and Hollywood poli­tics to help determine who should and does win. Were Forest Whitaker or "The Departed" really deserving winners or did the hype machine help them win? Perhaps a better question is whether the hype machine is avoidable or not-it probably isn't-or even a new phenomenon-it's not. When you look at it that way, you can't really complain, just watch "The Last King of Scotland" and "The Departed" and wait until next year's Academy Awards.

DVD REVIEW 

Oassic 'Indemnity' gets double treabnent on DVD 
By BRIAN DOXTADER Scene Ediror 

A man bleeding from a gunshot wound stumbles into his office, turns on a dictating machine and tersely admits he is a murder­er. 
So begins "Double Indemnity," Billy Wilder's 1944 film noir. masterpiece, and a cornerstone of American cinema. "Double. Indemnity" arrived near the height of film nair's popularity and success, standing alongside (and some would argue above) noir classics like "Laura;" "The Postman Always Rings Twice" and "The Big Sleep.~' The film has been a long time coming on DVD, and has finally arrived in a respectable package that pays homage to the considerable influence it has had on Hollywood. 
"Double Indemnity," based on James M. Cain's 1943 novella "Three of a Kind," fol­lows insurance agent Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), who is seduced by femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) into killing her husband to collect the insurance money. Unfortunately for Neff, after the hit goes as planned, his boss Barton Keyes (Edward G. Hobinson) takes over the murder investigation. 
Is there a more under-appreciated direc­tor in Hollywood history than Billy Wilder'? "Double Indemnity" was his first master­piece, but the filmmaker would go on to helm such classics as "The Lost Weekend," "Sunset Boulevard," "Stalag 17," "The Seven Year Itch," "The Spirit of St. Louis," "Some Like It Hot" and "The Apartment" over the course of a several decade career. 
What makes "Double Indemnity" so effec­tive is Wilder's inventive and atmospheric use of lighting and his moody sense of pur­pose, which drives the film throughout. He also gets some of the best work out of veter­an actors like MacMurray, Stanwyck and Robinson, all of whom ignite the picture with a creeping sense ofparanoia. 
It's also interesting to think that this seedy tale of adultery, murder and greed was released in 1944, a time when Hollywood was still regulated by the Hays Code -its gleeful immorality is one of the most alluring aspects of "Double Indemnity," even 60 


years later. "Double Indemnity,"
Double Indemnity 
along with the original 1933 "King Kong" and

Universal Legacy Series 
'The African Queen," is one of the last of the Universal American Film Institute's 100 Greatest Films to come to DVD. Universal finally recti­fied this at the end of last year, releasing the film in a two-disc spe­
cial edition with a re-mastered print and 
sound. "Double Indemnity" certainly looks 
good on DVD, with relatively dean picture, 
especially considering that the film is over 
60 years old. There is a Dolby Digital 2.0 
Mono audio track, and a pair of commen­
taries, one from Richard Shickel and one 
from Lem Dobbs and Nick Redman. 
There are only two special features, but they're both pretty interesting. The first is a new documentary, "Shadows of Suspense," which explores the film and its impact. The ·other is the 1973 "Double Indemnity" TV 
movie, which really proves just how power-. 
ful Wilder's film is. 


"Double Indemnity" is one of the great film noirs, and some would argue it is the greatest. Critic Roger Ebert once claimed that film noir is not a genre of detectives and mysteries, but of ordinary people who find within themselves the capacity for great evil. In that respect, "Double Indemnity" is the prototypical filn1 noir. Neff commits horrific crimes, but it ends on an oddly sympathetic note. As ifto say that yes, man has the capacity for great evil, but the capacity for great dignity as well.

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Vols topple defending champs in home finale 
No. 12 Panthers best Mountaineers 80-66 
Associated Press 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. -Chris Lofton scored 21 points, and Tennessee pulled away from No. 5 Florida in the first half and held on for an 86-76 victory Tuesday night. . 
JaJuan Smith added 16 points for Tennessee and Ramar Smith and Dane Bradshaw each had 10 points. 
The Gators (25-5, 12-3 Southeastern Conference) con­tinued a troubling trend for the defending national champions, who have lost three of four after a 17 -game winning streak. Their chances for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament are slipping away after easily wrapping up the SEC regular-season title last week. 
AI Horford led Florida with 17 points while Chris Richard and Corey Brewer had 12 apiece. Joakim Noah added 11 rebounds and Horford had 10. 
But this was the Volunteers' night. With Lady Vols coach Pat

Summitt dressing as a cheer­leader and singing "Rocky Top" and Super Bowl MVP Peyton Manning watching his alma mater, Tennessee (21-9, 9-6) fin­ished the season 16-0 at home. 
The Vols dominated Florida until the Gators started making a run late in the second half. 

Tennessee had a 17-0 run in the first half and were ahead by 19 points at halftime and as many as 27 in the second half. 
The Vols were leading 65-40 with 11:54 left when Florida had a 14-2 run that included eight points by Noah. His dunk with 
9:22 remaining cut it to 67-54. 
Tennessee scored again, but the Gators answered with a 7-0 run to pull to 69-61 with 6:08 to go. A drive by Lofton started a 6-0 run for the Vols, and the Gators couldn't get any closer. 
The Gators rallied from 18 points down against Alabama on Feb. 14 to win 76-67. It was the biggest deficit overcome by a team coached by Billy Donovan, and they looked poised for another miracle comeback. 
However, Florida couldn't sus­tain a rally. 
After pulling to within eight, the Gators cut it to nine three more times, but the final 1:58 featured seven trips to the foul line for Tennessee. The Vols went 8-of-14 in free throws down the stretch. 
In the first half, Florida was leading 17-16 with 13:48 left after Horford scored, and Bradshaw's basket over Noah sparked the big run. When Duke Crews scored with 8:05 left to end it, the Vols were up 33-17. 
Noah had another off night, scoring all eight of his points in Florida's late run. 
Appropriately, the Vols hon­ored their lone senior,

Bradshaw, before the final home game. Bradshaw made go­ahead layups in eaeh of the Vols' wins last year over Florida. 
The Gators had an easier time against Tennessee in Gainesville, winning 94-78, while Tennessee was playing without Lofton beeause he had a sprained right ·ankle. 
The Vols finished undefeated at home for the first time since 1975-76, and a near-capaeity crowd of 24,047 saw the home finale. 
No. 12 Pittsburgh 80 West Virginia 66 
This second half displayed No. 12 Pittsburgh at its best. Aaron Gray scoring consistently and teaming with Levon Kendall to make it difficult on opponents inside, and Mike Cook and Ronald Ramon hitting 3-pointers to extend runs and build leads. 
What the Panthers want to do is keep this going for, say, anoth­er five weeks. 
Gray and Kendall wore down West Virginia with their inside scoring and rebounding and the Panthers remained in contention for the Big East regular-season title, beating the Mountaineers Tuesday night behind a domi­nating second half. 
Despite losing at Big East leader Georgetown 61-53 on Saturday, Pitt (25-5, 12-3) can win the league title and be top­seeded in the eonference tour­nament next week if it wins at No. 20 Marquette on Saturday and Georgetown, an upset loser Monday to Syracuse, falls at home to Conneeticut the same day. Pitt ean finish no worse than seeond if it beats Marquette, whieh won at Pittsburgh 77-74 on Jan. 21. 
"We're right where we wanted to be in the Big East," coach Jamie Dixon said, even though Pitt would be leading if it had beatfm the Iloyas. "This is what we talked about. being right here in the conference." 
The surprise was that much of that talking was done by Gray, a 7 -footer who is one of the top big men in school history. 
Normally not a big talker, Gray was unhappy that Pitt trailed 32-29 at halftime in his final home game and let his team­mates know it. He was especial­ly disappointHd Pitt might lose any ehance of winning the con­ference, which he called "a huge preseason goal." 
''I'm usually not one to say something in the huddle, but I almost lost my voice from the halftime speech," Gray said. "We didn't want to let the chanee for the ehampionship slip away." 
Gray, hampered by a badly sprained ankle for 10 days and not much of a factor against Georgetown, keyed a 9-0 run that started the second half and put the Panthers up 38-32. Gray scored the first four points of a run finished off by Levance Fields' 3-pointer. 


"They're so hard to defend," West Virginia eoaeh John Beilein said, a referenee to Pitt's size and depth. "But I think we're coming. We did some things well, and we almost seored 70 points against one of the best del'ensive teams in the country, even though we didn't shoot well." 
Cook credited Gray's talk for the Panthers outscoring the Mountaineers 51-34 in the sec­ond half. 
"Aaron huddled us up at half­time, and we responded," he said. 
West Virginia (20-8, 8-7) had a ehance to win it, closing it to 54­51 with about 8 minutes remaining, but Cook made a 3­pointer and two free throws and Fields hit an ofT-balance 3 while nearly falling out of bounds dur­ing another 9-0 run that gave Pitt its first double-digit lead. Cook all but sealed it with another 3 that made it 66-53 after Joe Alexander hit two free throws for West Virginia. 
Brigham Young 62 No. 25 Air Force 58 
Austin Ainge scored 14 points and Keena Young added 12 ­including eight straight in a piv­otal second-half run -as Brigham Young beat No. 25 Air Force 62-58 on Tuesday night to assure the Cougars at least a share of the Mountain West Conference title. 
The Cougars also ended the Falcons' 30-game winning streak at Clune Arena, a place where Air Force had been near­ly unbeatable. The Falcons had won 54 of their previous 55 home games. 
Brigham Young (22-7, 12-3) now has the longest home-win­ning streak in the nation at 30 games and ean clinch the league title outright with a win Saturday at home against Utah. A UNLV loss in one of its two remaining games would elinch the title for BYU as well. It would be the Cougars' first out­right conference title since 1987-88. 
Jimmy Balderson had 11 points and Trent Plaisted 10 as the Cougars won for the ninth time in 10 games. 
Air Force (23-7, 10-6) lost its third striaght and dropped to 6­6 since starting 17-1. Tim Anderson and Jacob Burtschi each had 15 points. Dan Nwaelele seored 14, becoming the 21st player at Ai.r Force to eelipse 1,000 points for his career. 
A pair of free throws by Plaisted with 2:36 remaining gave the Cougars a 60-58 lead, which they wouldn't surrender.

Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES Clippers point guard Shaun Livingston will be out 8-to-12 months after tearing three of the four ligaments in his left knee while driving to the basket against Charlotte. 
"It's probably the most serious injury you can have to the knee," Clippers physician Dr. Tony Daly said Tuesday. "lie might miss all of next year." 
Livingston had an MRI exam Tuesday which revealed tears in the ante­rior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate liga­ment, medial collateral ligament and lateral meniscus. 
He also dislocated his patella, besides the previ­ously diagnosed disloca­tion of his tibia-femoral. As a rookie in 2004, he dislocated his right knee. 
Livingston was driving to the basket on a fast break Monday night, went up for a layup, and his left knee contorted as he col­lapsed in pain. A team doctor had to pop his knee back into place to alleviate the pain. 
"He came down on the leg without any contact with anybody. It's a freak accident, that's for sure," said Daly, who has rarely seen anything similar in 
IN BRIEF 
Oilers trade Smyth to 
Islanders before deadline 
The New York Islanders kept their leading scorer and nabbed the guy that makes the Edmonton Oilers go. 
Just minutes before the NHL trad­ing deadline expired Tuesday after­noon, the Islanders plucked Ryan Smyth away from the Oilers after deciding to hold onto Jason Blake. 
New York's big ·deal trumped those made earlier in the day that sent Bill Guerin from the St. Louis Blues to the San Jose Sharks, Todd Bertuzzi from Florida to Detroit, and longtime Kings captain Mattias Norstrom from Los Angeles to Dallas. 
True to form, the final 'dealing day of the season was very busy. The 25 trades made in the final six hours before the deadline matched last year for the most active in NHL his­tory. The 30 clubs moved 44 play­ers, two shy of the mark set in 2003. 
24 years of practice. 
He said the injury is more commonly associat­ed with contact sports such as football and rugby. 
Daly will solicit various medical opinions over the next two weeks, after which Livingston will have arthroscopic surgery, the doctor said. It wasn't yet decided if all three liga­ments would be repaired at once. 
Daly said Livingston did not tear an artery or dam­age any of the nerves in his knee, which can be serious complications. 
"If everything goes well, he could be back playing as soon as eight months," Daly said. "My nature is to be conservative. I've seen people who've had this done by other people and it hasn't worked out." 

Livingston, a three-year veteran who was drafted by the Clippers out of high school, has been ham­pered by injuries and has yet to play a full season in the NBA 
He sat out two games in January with a sprained right ankle. He missed 39 games during his rookie season because of a dislo­cated right knee, and another 12 that season because of torn cartilage in his right shoulder. Last season he sat out the first 21 games with a stress reaction in his lower back. 
Duke committee finds need 
for increased diversity 
RALEIGH, N.C. -Duke University needs to become more diverse, inclu­sive and engaged, a committee con­cluded Tuesday in its evaluation of campus culture following rape allega­tions involving the lacrosse team. 
The committee called for a new course requirement for undergradu­ates focusing on racial and class dif­ferences in the United States, and increasing admission standards at the elite, private university in Durham. 
A university official hesitated to commit to any of the proposals. 
"I don't think any of the recommen­dations should be considered anything but starting points for conversations," Provost Peter Lange said. 
The report barely mentions the March 13 party thrown by the school's lacrosse team, where a women hired to perform as a stripper told police she was attacked by three men in a bathroom. 

Safin · defeats Koubek 
while battling tough winds 
LAS VEGAS -Marat Safin beat Stefan Koubek of Austria 7-5, 6-2 in his opening round-robin match at the Tennis Channel Open on Tuesday. 
The third-seeded Russian, now 3-0 in his career against Koubek, had to adapt gusting winds of up to 32 mph throughout his match. 
"It is very tough," said Satin. "It is difficult to play your very best ten­nis. You just try to stay as cool as you can and try to attack. That is the only way to try and control the ball." 
Satin never trailed and never faced on a break point. He made 83 per­cent of his second serve points com­pared to 63 percent for Koubek. 
Second-seeded Lleyton Hewitt of Australia triumphed over Vincent Spadea 6-3, 6-3. 
Hewitt, a two-time event champion and a 2006 finalist, led throughout Tuesday's match.

BASEBALL HALL OF FAME 
Vets committee issues veto 
Ron Santo closest to election with 57 of 65 necessary votes 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -The Hall of Fame pitched another shutout. 
Ron Santo. Jim Kaat, Marvin Miller and all the other candi­dates were left out Tuesday when the Veterans Committee admitted no new members for the third straight election. 
The blank siate could lead to changes before the next vote in 2009. 
"We're being blamed because something hasn't happened," Hall member and vice chair­man Joe Morgan said. "If you're asking me, 'Do we lower our standards to get more peo­ple in?' my answer would be no." 
Santo came the closest to the required 75 percent. A nine­time All-Star, the former Cubs third baseman was picked on 57 of 82 ballots (70 percent). Players needed 62 for election. 
Kaat, a 283-game winner and strongly backed by Hall mem­ber Mike Schmidt, drew 52 votes. Gil Hodges, who hit 370 home runs, got 50 votes and three-time AL batting champion Tony Oliva had 47. 
Umpire Doug Harvey received 52 of the necessary 61 votes on the ballot for managers, umpires and executives. Miller, the union head who led players to free-agent riches, showed a strong increase in getting 51 of the potential 81 votes. 
The vets committee was revamped after charges of cronyism when it elected Bill Mazeroski in 2001. That marked the eighth straight year the 15-member panel sent someone to Cooperstown. 
After that, the panel was expanded to include all living Hall of Famers. The new com­mittee votes every other year for players and every four years for the others. 
"We are disappointed that no one has been elected in the three voting cycles," Hall chair­man Jane Forbes Clark said. "We will be evaluating this process and its trends at our next meeting, which is March 13, and discussing whether there should be any changes." 

"The board may dedde that the trends are not what wn thought they were going to be. Perhaps this hasn't worked as well as some of the board mem­bers thought it would and maybe it needs a little bit of change," she said. 
Cal Hipknn Jr. and Tony Gwynn were elected to the Ilall by the Baseball Writers' Association of Ameriea in January. They will stand alonn at the induction cernmonies .July 29 in Cooperstown. 
The 84 eligible voters on tlw vets committee indudnd 61 Hall members, 14 broadcasters, eight writers and one holdover from the previous panel. 
Morgan said he voted for the maximum 10 players. 
"I feel there are some guys out there that belong in the Hall of Fame," he said. "The writers voted on these people for 15 years and they weren't elected. Why are we being criticized because we haven't elected someone?" 
Maury Wills, Joe Tom\ Hoger Maris, Luis Tiant and Bobby Bonds were among the 27 ean­didates on the players ballot. 
"Noboby got in'? That's too bad. I'm sorry to hear that," Torre said. ''I'm not exactly sure what process they use. Don't forget, you've got the old guard and the young guard. People with dill'erent interests." 
Torre drew 32 percent of the votes based on his playing career. The New York Yankees manager -and former NL MVP -is expected to be elect­ed wlwn his time in tlw dugout is eonsidered. 

"Jon Torre, when he retires and he has 8,000 wins or what­evnr, I think that people would vote for him," Morgan said. 
Diek Williams, Whitey Ilerzog, Walter O'Mallny and Charlie 0. Finley also were among tho 15 nanws on the composite ballot. Morgan said it was hard to piek from those eandidates. 
"It is dillkult for some of tlw playnrs or me to nvaluate thPir pnrformanen on a Hall of Fame level. It is mueh easier for me to evaluate the players," Morgan said. 
Millnr received 63 percent, moving up from 44 pereent in the previous election. 
"Personally, I would love to see him get in," Torre said at the Yankees' spring eamp in Tampa, Fla. "lie's made such an impact on this modern play­er and the game itself." 
Union head Donald Fehr said it was "profoundly disappoint­ing" that Miller did not get enough support. 
"Given the increased number of votes for Marvin this time, there is certainly reason to believe that the votes will be there in the future," he said. 
Two years ago, Santo and I lodges eaeh eamc within eight votes of eloetion in drawing 65 pereent. .

The president called O'Neal "one of the most well-known figures in the United States of Amnrica." 
"Standing next to Shaq," Bush said, "is an awe-inspir­ing experience." The champi­onship was the first in the 18­ynar history of the Heat, and it came with contributions from some famous NBA play­ers on the back end of their careers, like guard Gary Payton and center Alonzo Mourning. 
Bush devoted most of his comments to praising individ­ual lleat players for their charity work. 
Hiley gave Bush a jersey and then told the audience: "I voted for the man. If you don't vote you don't count." 
Addressing :reporters later, Hiley denied that he had injected politics into the cere­mony. "I'm pro-American, pro-democracy, I'm pro-gov­ernment," the coach said. "I follow my boss. lie's my boss."

freak, benched 225 pounds 25 times -far from spectacular for a defensive lineman. Michigan's Alan Branch and Arkansas' Keith Jackson-no relation-managed 33 reps. Joe Cohen from Florida put the bar up 34 times. 
But the nation' most feared defensive end, UCLA's Justin Hickman, did 23 reps of 225. 
Maybe the bench isn't the he-all, end-all. 
Let's look a little closer. 

Along with Hickman, who was listed at 263 pounds -seven less than Abiarniri -UClA had Kevin Brown (293 pounds) and Brigham 
Harwell (286) as its starting tack­les. By comparison, former Irish defensive tackle Derek Landri was listed at 277, while fellow tackle Trevor Laws is at 283. On the inside, Notre Dame gave up 10 more pounds per player than did 
UClA, and the lighter Hickman benefited. 
To be fair, Landri clocked in with 24 reps at 225, beating only five of 20 competitors in his group. And yet, Landri had a year that deserved All-America considera­tion. He finished with 15.5 tackles for loss, including seven sacks. Hardly a result of too little muscle mass, right? 
Well, not quite. 

Landri benefited from the defense's inability to get the oppo­nent off the field. lie had extra plays on which to bring down run­ning backs behind the line because, all too often. the opposi­tion would tear through the Irish defense on the next play and miti­gate any prior defensive stop. 
A large part of Notre Dame's fail­lire to stop offenses was the lack of a pass rush, and the relative light­ness of the Irish defensive line was an unfortunate compounding fac­tor. Against Michigan State's spread offense, the Irish offensive line barely outweighed the Spartans defensive line by 10 pounds per player. On the flip side, Michigan State held a 30-pound edge per lineman when the Spartans were on ofl!mse. 
It's no wonder the lrL'ih couldn't control the line of scrimmage or get a running game going that wet Septembnr night. 
The question then is, what's the proper formula? 
The defensive unit needs to be fast on the ends and big in the mid­dle. With the implementation of the 3-4 personnel, it's only fair to wait and see how the conditioning stan· deals with the new configuration. 
But the offensive line needs to get bigger. 
Ryan Harris was an All-America candidate and Notre Dame's most effective man on the offensive line, according to Irish coach Charlie Weis. Yet he didn't meet the hype, not by a mile. 
Harris, who weighed in over 300 pounds, did 22 reps of 225 this week, while fellow former Irish lineman Dan Santucci did 23. 
While they weren't at the bot­tom, neither came close to the top end of the offensive linemen in tho drill. 
Both Harris and Santucci, along with fifth-year applicant .John Sullivan, were recruited for Tyrone Willingham's "West Coast" ollimse. The formula then might have been liw smaller, faster oflensive line­men. But it sure hasn't worked in the pro-style set<; Charlie Weis runs. The Irish offensive line got beat all season in 2006, and beat badly. 
If it wants to be successful in 2007, Notre Dame must control the line of scrimmage. No first­year starting quarterback, no mat­ter how good, can be expected to operate to any level dose to what Brady Quinn did behind the porous 2006 oflensive line. 
The starters need to bH physkal and strong. Fast is good, but it's tough to run screens when you can't run up the gut. 
So ifthis week is the impetus for any revelation, it should be this one: It's time to bulk up.

lose. 
Notrn Dame, on thn other hand, has a lot riding on this game. A bye in the Big East tournament would bn wrappnd up with a win Saturday or a loss by Synu:usn to Villanova the same day. Evon if the Irish are liknly to make the · NCM tournamnnt no matter how the next two wonks play out, it is important lin· Notrn Danw to dis­patch of tlw Knights in a nmn1mr befitting a top-25 team. 
The Big East tourney 
To say Notre Damn has strug­glod in the Big East tournament would bn an undnrstatnmnnt. Tho Irish are just 3-11 all-tinw at the tournament and seniors Colin Falls and Bussell Carter are just 1­:~ in their eareors. To owreome history like that. Notrn Dame will need to be on a roll going to New York. Losing to one of tlw Big East's worst tnams just days beforo the tournamm1t could be devastating. 
In addition, a bye is not assured if the Irish lose. Tho Orange are on the bubble f(Jr an NCAA berth and should b1mt a Wildcats team that has bmm inconsistent for most of this season. If that hap­pens, Notrn Damn will need to boat Hutgers to take tim tiobrnak­nr from 11-5 Syracuse. 
A bye will be important filr thn Irish not only bncause just one tnam has ever won thn Big Hast tournament without earning a bye. but also bnc:auso having a bye gives Notre Dame positive publici­ty in the eyes of the NCAA Tournamnnt snlnction eommittnn. Although the dimmm<~e is only ono place in the Big East stand­ings, a fimrth-placn Irish squad with a byn would likely earn a higher seed than a fifth-plan~ team forced to play in the first. round in New York. 
The Big Dance 
The Hutgers game will also have a direct efl'eet on Notrn Damn's sooding for the NCAA tournamont. Tho Scarlet Knights arn eurnmtly ranked 205 in tho HPI, according to eollegerpi.eom. A loss to thorn would be devastating to Notrn Dame's own RPI, which is current­ly 32. Most experL<>, including ESPNs Joe Lunardi, are project­ing the Irish as high as a live or six sned based on other factors, like Notre Dame's 6-3 record against the RPI top-50 and position 111~ar the top of the Big East standings. 

On the other side of tho eoin, the Irish can help themselves in the s1~eding quite a bit with a win Saturday. The win will be on the road, and will thnrl'lim~ count as 
1.4 wins in the HPI's !(Jrmula. This will boost Notre Dame into the higher 20s in HPJ and probably put the Irish at least one seed higher in the NCAA Tournanwnt. than they would bn if tlwy lost. 
While the eomp1~lling matehups that await the Irish in NPw York (such as a possible rematch with Marquette) will also play a big role in Notre Dame's sneding liJr the Big Dance, no game is more important than the next one. 
With a conJerence tournamPnt bye and seeding in thn NCAA'i on the line, the Rutgers game sud­denly means a whole lot.

Richmond a month later, Hurley ascended to second in the world rankings. 
But that wasn't even good enough for first in her house. 
Hurley's younger sister, Courtney, is an epee prodigy of her own. The younger Hurley took first in the cadet division (under-16) in Albuquerque and third -just behind her sister ­in the open event in Richmond, Va. By December, she was the national No. 1 epee in the rolling points system used to rank American fencers. 
Needless to say, the Hurley sisters were quite the competi­tors. 
"My sister and I hated each other's guts for a while," Kelley Hurley said. "The feeling sucks when you know your younger sister can beat you." 
Kelley Hurley said separation has made the heart grow fonder traveling to domestic and intm­national events as she stays at Notre Dame, Kelley said she can root for Courtney more. Even if they face off. they know it's not the end of the world. 
"l finally got over it when l realized that she would win some and I would win some," the older sister said. 
But then there's the 2008 Beijing Games. Because the U.S. national team will not have a full women's epee squad com­peting, the two Hurleys are essentially fighting for one spot. The Irish freshman entered the year with a lead in the points used to determine the Olympic qualifiers, but Courtney Hurley's more flexible schedule has allowed her to rack up cru­cial points while big sister com­petes for Notre Dame. 
Although Irish junior sabreist Marie! Zagunis recently with­drew from school to take a three-semester leave of absence in order to train and qualify in her weapon, Notre Dame's Hurley is hesitant about leaving she has the opportunity to trav­el," Kelley llurlny said of hnr sistnr. "I don't want to take a year ofT. lbutl if I do really well in the summer competitions, I'll probably take the year off." 
But with the way she's fenc­ing, Notre Dame might want to start preparing for a ynar with­out its young star. 
Note: 
+The Notre Dame coaching staff on Tuesday named senior foilist Fran Bontempo and soph­omore foilist Adrienne Nott as the squad's first fencers of the month. 
Bontempo went 10-2 at th1~ Duke Duals Feb. 9-10 and 10-2 Saturday at the Northwestern Duals. Nott was a perfect 10-0 at Duke and 17-2 at Northwestern. Nott also took the silver medal at the USFA Junior Olympics Feb. 16-19.

Badgering for a chance 
Sawatske hungers for title after transferring from Wisconsin to ND 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 
Last spring, as the Wisconsin Badgers took home their sixth national championship in Milwaukee, Irish defenseman Tom Sawatske was forced to watch his former teammates celebrate the victory from his apartment. 
Sawatske transferred from Madison to South Bend prior to his junior season after playing for the Badgers in the first two years of his collegiate career. The senior played in 54 games for Wisconsin while picking up 3 goals and 11 assists from his spot on the blue line, but chose to leave for both hockey and academic reasons. 
"I was happy for all the guys that I played with. They deserved it," Sawatske said. "But at the same time it was kind of tough to know that you could have been there." 
It didn't seem likely at the time -Notre Dame had fin­ished its season at 13-17-4 ­but Sawatske may get a second chance at a championship. The No. 1 Irish are certainly on a VANESSA GEMPIS/The Observer

FOOTBALL COMMENTARY 
Irish need n1uscle on front lines 
Ruben Mendoza is an imposing figure. 
His upper body -calling it stout would be an understate­ment-screams power on top of legs that say strength. 
He's Notre Dame's drill sergeant strength and conditioning coordinator, the one blow­ing whistles and demand­ing the Irish stay in top form. 
But while he's built of brute force, questions about Notre Dame's linemen are understand­able. 
The Irish failed to dominate the line of scrimmage all season, and looked badly overmatched at times. In the off-season, the battle of the trenches might not get much talk, but results from the Irish at this week's NFL Combine in Indianapolis throw into ques­tion whether one of Notre Dame's strategies is hurting the Irish.

fENCING 
Hurley learned to 
fence at 'dinner' 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Editor 
Kelley Hurley is the youngest fencer for Notre Dame, but she just might be the best. 
The freshman epeeist is 51-4 this season, including a second­place finish at the prestigious .Penn State Open in November. But her .927 winning percent­age -the team's best -does­n't satisfy her. 
"I feel like I shouldn't have lost those bouts," Hurley said of her four defeats. 
With her background, the feeling is understandable. 
Hurley captured the under-17 title at the World Championships in 2005. Only 
16 years old at the time, she climbed her way up the nation­al and world rankings. 
Hurley, who learned fencing from her parents, Tracy and Robert, became the youngest 
U.S. women's epee junior cham­pion in 2004 after taking the national crown as a 14-ycar­old. The junior circuit is open to all fencers under 19. 
"Fencing has always been taught at the dinner table," she said. "And everywhere else." 
After taking first in the junior competition at the North American Cup (NAC) event in Albuquerque, N.M., last November and second in the senior NAC competition in

MEN'S BASKETBALL ANALYSIS 

Overlooking Rutgers could cost ND 
On the surface, No. 17/22 Notre Dame's matchup against Rutgers Saturday means little. The Irish (22-6, 1 0-5 Big East) ean wrap up a bye in the Big East tournament oven with a

NCM Tournament. For the Scarlet Knights (1 0-18, 3­12 Big East), the game will be their last this season regardless of the outcome. 
In reality, Saturday's matehup can have tremendous impact. For Rutgers, a win over Notre Dame would give a positive ending to an otherwise drnadli.JI season. The Scarlet Knights have nothing to play for except an ups1~t over a top-25 toam. They will be moti­vatPd to play with reckless aban­don, boca use thoy have nothing to
