Judge dismisses Ramadan lawsuit 
ACLU claimed Ramadan's visa unconsitutionally denied; court maintains terrorist ties 
By KAREN LANGLEY 
News Editor 
More than three years after prominent Muslim scholar Tariq Ramadan was barred from entering the United States to take up a tenured teaching position at Notre Dame, a feder­al judge in New York has ruled that the government had legiti­mate reasons to deny Ramadan's visa. 
The judge, Paul A. Crotty of the Federal District Court in Manhattan, dismissed a lawsuit in December filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) that claimed the govern­ment used an unconstitutional 
portion of the Patriot Act to deny Ramadan a work visa in July 2004, when he attempt­ed to enter the United 

States from 
Ramadan
his home in Switzerland, The New York Times reported in December. 
The ACLU suit claimed the portion of the Patriot Act deny­ing visa to people who "endorse or espouse terrorist activity" was unconstitutional. 
Crotty ruled the government had revoked Ramadan's visa because the scholar had, over the course of four years, given $1,336 to a Swiss charity later designated as a terrorist group, the Times reported. He did not address the Patriot Act's consti­tutionality. 
Ramadan has publicly argued he was unaware of any terrorist ties and had made contribu­tions solely as humanitarian aid. 
"In its letter, the U.S. Embassy claims that I 'reasonably should have known' that the charities in question provided money to Hamas," Ramadan said in a let­ter published in The Washington Post in October 2006. "But my donations were made between December 1998 and July 2002, and the United States did not blacklist the charities until 2003. How should I reasonably have known of their activities before the U.S. government itself knew?"

University uses residence halls for classrooms 
O'Neill, McGlinn lounges host literature seminars due to lack ofcampus teaching space 
By GENE NOONE News Writer 
For the first time in the University's history, a number of courses are currently being taught inside residence halls. 
Lounges in O'Neill and McGlinn Halls are currently being used as classrooms for a variety of courses, including a literature University seminar, a "Great Books" seminar and several Portuguese courses, Vice President and Associate Provost Dennis Jacobs said. 
Jacobs said the residence halls' lounges would only be used as classrooms during mid-day hours, a time slot dur­ing which the University has had difficulty finding teaching space recently. 
"There is tremendous demand on this campus for classes which meet anytime between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and Notte Dame does not have enough classroom space to meet the demand," Jacobs said. "Therefore ... the seminar spaces in O'Neill and McGlinn will allow additional courses to meet during the most popular time slots. 
The administration, he said, first considered the possibility of holding classes in the dorms in November 2006. At that time, McGlinn rector Sister Mary Lynch and O'Neill rector Ed Mack pitched the idea to

Students, faculty to consider 'iTunes U' 
Program offers downloadable course materials 
By ROHAN ANAND News· Writer 
With the tagline "the campus that never sleeps," Apple, Inc. launched "iTunes U" last spring, a program that looks like the regular iTunes store but offers students, professors and the public free access to downloadable classroom lectures. And while more than 250 institutions across the nation are registered, Notre Dame is still in the process of examining the technology. 
"My description of it would be a way of distrib­uting media --namely 
video clips, audio clips, pic­tures, and even documents -to share what is going on in classrooms with the pub­lic," said senior Patrick Finnigan, the undergradu­ate representative to the University Committee on Academic Technology. 
Schools that are already affiliated with iTunes U use it to distribute course con­tent to its students, but some even take it a step further by turning it into a public relations medium. It can offer prospective high school students guided tours of campuses, Finnigan said.

10 Things 
that 111ake 

Heathnevvs 
Every time I come back to school, my 
mom gets inevitably teary, and in desper­
ate attempts to cheer her up I always tell 
her to look ahead to the next break, when 
I'll bn back and we'll have plenty of moth­
er-daughter time. 
This time I told Marcela Berrios 
her to look ahead 
to the summer, 
Associate News 
for "Sex and the 
Editor 
City: The Movie" 
and "The Dark 
Knight." And then I went otf on a tangent about how !Ieath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker is scary. 
Way darker than Jack Nicholson's. 
But with death Tuesday and the exten­sive eoverage that followed it, I no longer think of him as that exquisitely tormented Joker. IJe's no longer the Enni'i Del Mar Jake Gyllenhaal wished to quit. 
And I also don't think he is our genera­
tion's James Dean, as one ofthose talking 
heads in CNN called him. 
In fad-and lbr someone who checks 
Perez I Iilton's blog almost as often as her 
Facebook, this is a huge step away from 
frivolity-I think what saddens me most 
about I Ieath Ledger's death is his baby. 
Yes, people with babies die everyday and I don't write Inside Columns about them. And at lea'it Baby Ledger doesn't have to worry about money. 
But this column isn't really about Heath Lodger a'i much a'i it is about tim things that really make his story tra).,ric. I picked 10. 
1. 
People shouldn't die at 28. That's too young. 

2. 
lin was a gilted aetor. Forget the Oscar nomination. He lbund work in · llollywond even after "A Knight's Tale." 

3. 
Ilis parents are still alive. And no par­ent should have to bury a child. 

4. 
IIe gave gay cowboys everywhere a voice. 

5. 
lli'i death was unexpeeted. Death is sad whether it's a surprise or the end of a prolonged disease. But when it's a sur­prise it's easier to be paralyzed by it. 

6. 
That being said, I hope all the self­righteous, holier-than-thou people who think tim Federal Reserve's rate cuts or the Super Bowl are legitimate news­and Heath Ledger is tabloid news to them -realize that we, those who are suscepti­ble to this news, are not foolish or insipid. We are merely that. Susceptible. 


And for you information, I was also glued to the t.v. when Benazir Bhutto died. But it was for 10 different reasons. 
7. 
That being said, his death shouldn't be milked for ratings, but it undoubtedly will bn. "Entertainment Tonight" relegat­ed its exclusive interview with Britney Spears' new boyfriend to focus on this story. 

8. 
My own father died when I was very young. And while it's true that toddlers are oblivious to their surroundings and spared from the immediate, heart attack­inducing blow, it will still hurt. Especially on Father's Day and birthdays. 

9. 
Did the apartment belong to Mary Kate Olsen? Must those girls be every­where? 

10. 
The bodybag was carried out on a gurney amidst hundreds of flashing cam­era'>. With such a sad ending, he and his liunily should be in our prayers.

ProfessorexannUnes Tawainese atrocity 
Special to The Observer 
In 1947, an anti-government uprising in northern Taiwan led to the slaughter of some 20,000 citizens and contributed to a 40-year period of govern­ment suppression that effec­tively buried knowledge of the incident until martial law ended in 1987. 
How the uprising re-entered the public consciousness through literature and film is examined in a new book by Sylvia Lin, assistant professor of East Asian languages and cultures at Notre Dame. Called "Representing Atrocity in Taiwan: The 2/28 Incident and White Terror in Fiction and Film," it is published by Columbia University Press. 

A native of Taiwan, Lin has first-hand experience of living in a totalitarian state, exempli­fied by the era known as White Terror. During the 40 years of martial law, the government effectively suppressed chal­lenge by arresting and impris­oning dissidents and by instill­ing a pervasive fear in the citi­zenry. The bloodiest of these acts occurred around Feb. 28, 1947, a melee that began when government agents harassed a woman who was selling untaxed. black market ciga­rettes. 
Fearing retribution, Lin's parents' generation refused to discuss the 2/28 incident even in private. Unlike the Jews in the Holocaust or the Japanese who survived Hiroshima, Lin's generation grew up unaware of this national tragedy. 

The subsequent awakening provides a case study on the lasting cultural impact of atroc­ities, particularly as they are portrayed in literature and film. Drawing on abundant Holocaust scholarship of atroci­ty and trauma, Lin analyzes Taiwanese and Chinese litera­ture and post-martial law cine­ma and identifies emotional and reflective patterns that appear across cultures. 
Time is needed to support an environment in which art turns from themes such as anger or victimization to those that honor the sacrifice of the dead and grasp the tragedy of human suffering. However, Lin's book cautions, the process demands judicious deliberation to avoid a reversal of interpre­tive tyranny after a regime change. 
A member of the Notre Dame faculty since 2002, Lin teaches modern and contemporary Chinese literature, film and culture. Her research interests include Western missionaries and Chinese women, women and new culture in early 20th century China, language and identity in Taiwan, and narra­tive theory. She earned her doctorate from the University of California, Berkeley.

"They proposed the idea that the study lounges in their respective halls be utilized as seminar classrooms during the daytime because students rarely use them for personal study space except at night," Jacobs said. 
The rectors eventually took their proposal back to their respective hall councils, which welcomed the plan. The suggestion then also received support from the Provost's Office and the Office of Student Affairs, Jacobs said. 
A benefit of teaching inside dorms, Jacobs said, is the increased integration of the campus' residential life and its academic one.

College Headership program, which provides students with free copies of USA Today, The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. 
Carol Hendrickson, the chair of Academic Affairs, said she was very pleased with the response the program has received this year. 
"Consumption rates are in the high 80 percent all across cam­pus," she said. "This year we've been really happy with the pro­gram because we've been able to find the right amount and the right papers [to distribute]." 
Although Hendrickson often requests a certain amount of papers, USA Today (which runs the program) will often use its own figures to determine how many to deliver, she said. Student body president Liz Brown explained that the con­tract is written in such a way that USA Today has the freedom to use its own analysis to deter­mine the quantities it should deliver to campus. 
However, because this has not caused the program to exceed its budget and readership is cur­rently strong, Hendrickson has seen no major reason to com­plain. 
Moreover, the program has seen a major success in its recent expansion to the Mendoza College of Business and the Hesburgh Library. 
"We've been targeting more people," Hendrickson said. 'The success at Mendoza and the Library really shows more peo­ple are reading."

capable of interacting with such a person and not becoming overwhelmed, threatened or 'corrupted' by challenging ideas, provocative criticisms and con­troversial opinions," he said. 
Appleby praised the University's "courageous" sup­port of Hamadan, a decision that stirred debate even before the visa revocation because of con­troversy over the scholar's views. 
Ramadan is known as a liberal Muslim scholar who has spoken for religious tolerance and added to debate on issues of Muslims in the Western and democratic world. He has also been accused by some groups of spreading Islamic militant ideas. 
The Luee professorship has remained unfilled since Hamadan resigned in December 2004. The University plans to search for a suitable candidate this year, Appleby said. 
Appleby said he does not expect Hamadan will teach at Notre Dame in the future. 
"It seems unlikely that Professor Hamadan will be re­appointed to Notre Dame, given his current position at Oxford and the fact that he still does not have a visa permitting him per­manent residence in the U.S.," he said. 
The addition of Ramadan to the University's teaching faculty would have made a particular impact on the mission of the Kroc Institute, he said. 
"Hamadan is innuential with millions of people whom we seek bntter to understand and engage in a eonstructive way," he said. "As a person of faith, he wel­comed a chance to interact with Catholics and other Christians, as well as Muslim and Jewish students and faculty."

Israel sends fuel, eases fiveday blockade 
GAZA CITY -Israel sent fuel to Gaza's power plant on Tuesday, easing its five-day blockade of the Palestinian territory amid growing interna­tional concern about a humanitarian crisis. 
The U.S. warned Israel not to add to the hard­ship for ordinary Palestinians but blamed the problem on Gaza's Islamic Barnas rulers. Israel imposod the siege in response to increasing rocket attacks on its border communities by Gaza mili­tants. 
Despite the easing of the closure, Palestinian militants fired 19 rockets toward Israel on Tuesday, the military said, up from just two on Monday. 
The lights were back on in most of Gaza City by Tuesday afternoon after a blackout that lasted almost two days. But Gazans still vented their anger. 
U.N. to pressure Iran's nuclear program 
PAHIS -The U.N. Security Council's five per­manent members and Germany are expected to agree Tuesday on a new resolution to pressure Iran over its nuclear program, a French diplomat said. But a U.S. official said differences over the issue remain. 
The senior French diplomat, who briefed reporters Monday on condition that he not be identified by name, said an agreement was very close and should be fmalized by the six nation's foreign ministers at a meeting in Berlin, Germany. 
However, others were more cautious about what the talks could produce. Momentum for a third resolution has slowed since a U.S. intelli­gence assessment last month indicated Tehran had stopped active work on a nuclear weapons program in 2003.

Heath Leill!er found dead, pills nearby 
NEW YORK-Heath Ledger was found dead Tuesday in a Manhattan apartment, naked in bed with sleeping pills nearby, police said. The Australian-born actor was 28. 
It wasn't immediately clear if Ledger had com­mitted suicide. He had an appointment for a mas­sage at the residence in the tony neighborhood of SoHo, NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said. A housekeeper who went to let him know the mas­sage therapist had arrived found him dead at 3:26 p.m. 
Ledger's body had not been removed from the building where paparazzi and gawkers gathered outside, and several police officers put up barri­cades to control the crowd of about 300. A medical examiner's office van arrived with a gurney Tuesday evening.

Government to stimulate economy 
Leaders hope $150 billion in tax cuts, government spending will calm recession fears 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Jolted by global recession fears, the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates Tuesday, and President Bush and leaders of Congress joined in a rare show of cooperation in promising urgent action to pump up the economy with upwards of $150 billion in tax cuts and government spending. 
Market meltdowns overnight around the globe and growing anxiety at home stirred lawmakers and the administration toward swift action, possibly within a few weeks. Wall Street plummet­ed as the day began, follow­ing Asian stocks, then warily eased its sell-off after the Fed ordered the biggest cut on record in a key interest rate.

Actor's family says death an accident 
Associated Press 
SYDNEY -Heath Ledger's family rejected any suggestion Wednesday that the actor killed himself and joined fellow Australians in mourning one of their rising stars after he was found dead in a New York apartment. 
The Australian-born actor was found face-down and naked at the foot of a bed in a Manhattan apartment Tuesday. Police said there were pre­scription sleeping pills near Ledger's body, but there was no obvious sign he had committed suicide. 
Ledger's family members faced a throng of journalists in the actor's hometown of Perth in western Australia and read a statement saying his death was purely accidental, though they did not say whether he died of an overdose. 
"We, Heath's family, can con­firm the very tragic, untimely and accidental passing of our dearly loved son, brother and doting father of Matilda," Ledger's father Kim told reporters. "He was found peacefully asleep in his New York apartment by his house­keeper at 3:30p.m. U.S. time." 
Kim Ledger remembered his 28-year-old son as a "down to earth, generous, kindhearted, life-loving, unselfish individual" who was "extremely inspira­tional" to those who knew him. 
"Heath has touched so many people on so many different levels during his short life but few had the pleasure of truly knowing him," Kim Ledger said. "Please now respeet our family's need to grieve and come to terms with our loss privately." 
Meanwhile, tributes from fel­low Australians flooded in Wednesday, with actress Nicole Kidman called Ledger's death a "terrible tragedy." 
Cate Blanchett, who starred with Ledger in the Bob Dylan bio-flick ''I'm Not There," a role that earned her an Oscar nomi­nation Tuesday for best sup­porting actress, said she was "shocked and saddened" at the news. 
"I deeply respect Heath's work and always admired his continuing development as an artist," Blanchett said in a statement published by News Ltd. newspapers online. "My thoughts are with his family and close friends." 
Australia's Prime Minister Kevin Rudd expressed shock over losing "one of our nation's finest actors in the prime of his life."

IN BRIEF 
Bernanke slashes key interest rate 
WASHINGTON -The Federal Reserve unex­pectedly slashed a key interest rate by a bold three-fourths of a percentage point on Tuesday, responding to a global plunge in stock markets that heightened concerns about a recession. The Fed signaled that further rate cuts were likely. 
The reduction in the federal funds rate from 
4.25 percent down to 3.5 percent marked the biggest reduction in this target rate for overnight loans on records going back to 1990. It marked the first time that the Fed has changed the funds rate between meetings since 2001, when the central bank was battling the combined impacts of a recession and the terror­ist attacks. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues approved the large rate cut after an emergency video conference on Monday night, a day when global markets had been pounded by rising concerns that weakness in the world's largest economy was spreading worldwide. 
Supreme Court will not hear Fnron case 
WASHINGTON -The Supreme Court dealt a probable fatal blow Tuesday to Enron Corp. investors' efforts to recover $40 billion from Wall Street banks in the 2001 collapse of the Texas energy company. 
Without comment, the justices refused to hear arguments in the Enron case. Attorneys for shareholders immediately vowed to return to federal court in Houston in an attempt to prove that the investment banks misled the public and helped conceal Enron's true fmancial condition. 
"It's an uphill battle and we'll keep fighting," Patrick Coughlin, the lead lawyer for the stock­holders, said. 
Attorney Greg Markel, a lawyer not connect­ed with the case who represents corporate clients in securities fraud lawsuits, said share­holders' "chances of succeeding ... are nearly zero." 
Enron's demise wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension plans at what had been the seventh-largest company in the country. 

DowJones falls earl~ rebounds later 
Emergency prime rate cut precedes 300-point drop in first minute of trading 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -The open­ing bell hadn't even sounded on Wall Street when the Federal Reserve announced an emergency interest-rate cut. The Dow Jones industri­al average fell 465 points ­including 300 in the first minute -then rebounded to fmish down a more bear­able 128. 
The recovery Tuesday was a victory of sorts for a bat­tered market. But a long­term comeback may depend on factors much more diffi­cult to achieve -a turn­around in the housing mar­ket and renewed confidence among U.S. consumers, who hold up most of the econo­my. 
The alarming early drop in U.S. stocks followed the lead of markets abroad, where investors fled stocks and sent indexes plummet­ing on fears of a U.S. reces­sion that could spread to other global economies. 
By the close, the Dow had recovered to a loss of 128.11, or just over 1 per­cent, at 11,971.19. 

Before trading began, the Federal Rese-rve moved to slash its benchmark federal funds rate by 0.75 percent­age points, to 3.5 percent.

elective abortion at 
every stage in preg­

nancy. The Court defined the unborn 
child as a nonperson who is therefore 
not entitled to the right to life guaran­
teed by the Constitution to persons. 
The Supreme Court will not reverse that holding of Roe. Even the Justices who say that Roe should be "overruled" define that as a "states' rights" approach that would allow the states to permit or forbid abortion. That would affirm the holding of Roe. If your life is subject to extinction whenever a state legislature so decrees, then, so far as the United States Constitution is con­cerned, you are a nonperson. 
Depersonalization is the theory of the Nazis' treatment of the Jews and of the Supreme Court's 1857 Dred Scott case in which the Court held that freed slaves could not be citizens and said that slaves were property rather than persons. . 
Abortion is not simply a legal issue. It is embedded in American culture. The Alan Guttmacher Institute reports that from 1973 to 2005, more than 45 mil­lion surgical abortions occurred in the United States, with 1.21 million in 2005, down from 1.31 in 2000. Twenty­two percent of all pregnancies in the United States end in abortion. These figures do not include the uncountable number of early abortions by abortifa­cients, including most "contraceptive" pills. 
Abortion is a symptom of what Pope Benedict XVI called "a dictatorship of relativism ... that recognizes nothing as absolute and which only leaves the 'I' and its whims as the ultimate meas­ure." The secularism, relativism and individualism of that culture affect the 
Embrace life 
most fundamental human activity, the 
generation of life. 

Abortion is a product of the contra­
ceptive ethic. "[D]espite their differ­
ences," said John Paul II, "contracep­
tion and abortion are often closely con­
nected, as fruits of the same tree.... 
rooted in a hedonistic mentality unwill­
ing to accept responsibility in matters 
of sexuality, and ... a self-centered con­
cept of freedom, which regards procre­
ation as an obstacle to personal fulfill­
ment." 
Until the Anglican Lambeth 
Conference of 1930, no Christian 

denomination had ever said that con­
traception could ever be objectively 
right. Contraception deliberately sepa­
rates sex from procreation. It affirms 
that there is such a thing as a life not 
worth living, and that man (of both 
sexes), rather than God, is the arbiter of 
whether and when human life shall 
begin. If you claim the right to decide 
when life begins you will predictably 
claim the right to decide when it ends, 
as in abortion and euthanasia. 

With the marketing of the pill in the 
1960s, Roe v. Wade was inevitable. A 
contraceptive culture needs abortion as 
a back-up. The meltdown of that cul­
ture is accelerating. 

Francis Fukuyama called the intro­
duction of the contraceptive pill "The 
Great Disruption" in relations between 
men and women. In the nature of 
things, sex is reserved for marriage, 
and marriage is permanent, because 
sex has something to do with babies. 
The contraceptive separation of sex 
from life leads to the separation of sex 
from marriage and to the irrelevancy of 
marriage. In 2006, as reported by the 
Centers for Disease Control, a record 
36.9 percent of all births were out of wedlock. Out-of-wedlock births are 80 percent of births to teens and 60 per­cent to mothers in their early 20s. In 2006, they were 26.6 percent among non-Hispanic whites, 70.7 percent among non-Hispanic blacks and 49.9 percent among Hispanics. 
Government officials, including edu­
cators, throw fuel on the fire by pro­
moting contraception even among pre­

teens. Not surprisingly, the birth rate to 
teens rose three percent in 2006, the 
first rise since 1991. Cases of gonor­

rhea, chlamydia and syphilis, the STDs 
for which reporting is required, contin­
ue to rise. 
In such a Copulation Explosion, you 
have to expeet a rise in pregnancies 

and that many will end in abortion. The 
"morning-after pill," an abortifacient, is 
available over-the-counter and is easily, 
if illegally, obtainable by minors without 
parental knowledge. 

Neither the law nor politics can get us out of this mess. Contraception and abortion are a subset of the question: Who is God? Who decides whether and when life begins and when it ends? Abortion is an aspeet of our contracep­tive rejection of God's gift of life. Before he became Benedict XVI, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger said, "[T]he ultimate root of hatred for human life ... is the loss of God. When God disappears, the absolute dignity of human life disap­pears as well .... Only this divine dimen­sion guarantees the full dignity of the human person.... In the struggle for life, talking about God is indispensa­ble." 
The March for Life is not a futile exer­cise. It focuses on abortion, the ultimate secular sacrament. The March is an in­your-face, on-site reminder to the Executive, the Court and the Congress of their derelictions and of what they ought to do. Under the leadership of Washington attorney Nellie Gray, the March, from its inception, has also been an act of prayer. The message: Human life is sacred because it is a gift of God. The students in the March bring honor to the Notre Dame community.

Vote for Norris, not Huckabee 
I don't know about you, but I am going to vote for Mike Huckabee for one reason and one reason only: Chuck Norris is cam­paigning for him. Anybody who is hiding a fist in his beard must know his politics.

But back to Huckabee. I think the main reason I'm voting for him is because of Chuck Norris. Any candidate who can win the support of and employ a celebrity in his campaigning arsenal is obviously the best candidate. 
In case you don't know, the other day Norris, while campaigning for Huckabee, said that an opponent, John McCain, wouldn't make a good president because of his old age. 

He even made a comment about McCain's good traits being inherited from his mom. 
Norris pretty much just karate-kicked McCain in the face there. 
But this really annoys me, this whole trend of celebrities getting involved in pol­itics enough so to try and use their repu­tation and position to not only win votes for their candidate, but they go so far as to try and demean their opponents. 
But in Huckabee's defense, the title President Huckabee, brought to you by Chuck Norris, does roll off the tongue pretty easily. 
I know this has been going on for a long time, and will continue to happen in elec­tions to come, but I just think it's sad that Norris campaigning for Huckabee will actually win some votes. 
And then to go even further and bash other people, I think is a misuse of fame.

Once, in 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. had a dream. Forty-five years later, it moves closer to reality. ..,. ! 1  
We stand in a present where a possible future is that our first black preside·nt, Barack Obama, brings tremendous change to society. 
This is not a political endorsement, just something to think about. 
Imagine that exactly one year and two days from now, Obama is sworn into the chair President Bush has warmed

thoughts on policy or the fact that, unlike most politicians, he makes sense when he talks. Yet the reality is that those with a spirit of equality in their hearts cannot deny that part of us secretly roots for him because he is potentially the first black president. 
This possible future where Obama takes the presidential oath would be a moment where King's prophetic dream reaches fulfillment. The beauty of Obama's character is that he represents the whole spectrum: black to white, rich to poor. 
His victory would fulfill King's words: "Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood." On the international level, America would finally share brotherhood with the greater part of the globe: We would finally have a non-white leader. 
This would alter worldwide opinions of America; in case you didn't know, a good percentage of the world is some shade of brown, whether in Pakistan, Peru or Palau. The NMCP also defines racial harmony beyond the limited paradigm of just black or white; think about what the letters of its name mean. 
We would be brothers with countries where non-white leaders led massive demo­cratic reform. South Africa ended apartheid with the help of Nelson Mandela. Bolivia recently began reforming the constitution with the help of indigenous president Evo Morales, who hopes to transform Bolivia's 90 percent non-white lower caste into equals. 
President Obama may not join them in creating structural change, but he would get respect from a world of people who have long felt oppressed by the legacy of colonialism and that American policy makers do not understand them. 
This wish for equality is what makes Obama so dynamic. On a deeper level, we want him to win because he understands us. No matter who you are, he understands my people, your people and their people. His cultural sensitivity proclaims us equals, fulfilling King's dream to "make justice a reality for all of God's children." 
Of course, reality is never as magical as we wish, but if Obama were to win, society would be redefmed, and those who have hungered and thirsted for equality, as King once did, would be satisfied.

I understand Norris is free to spend his money and think politically however he likes, but it just seems that more and more our society is getting sponsored. 
It started with sports stadiums and the­atres, how we now go to the Allstate arena instead of the Rosemont Horizon. 
Now Huckabee is, in a way, being spon­sored by Chuck Norris, something die­hard Norris enthusiasts will be influenced by, and something wimps will be scared into conformity by. 
I mean after all, who wants to receive a round-house kick to the face if they don't vote for Huckabee? I don't. 
I think that there are certain areas, poli­tics being one of them, that famed citizens should stay out of. 
It's a cheap trick performed by Huckabee, a desperate attempt to try and win more votes, and an irresponsible decision by Norris, who will sway people's decisions with no regard to issues and the welfare of our nation, but because of pop­ularity and famed jokes. 
Granted, Norris almost assuredly believes Huckabee is the best candidate, I'm not entirely comfortable with the idea of people blindly voting for Huckabee because Norris endorses him. 
I can think of some people who will be swayed by Norris' influence on Huckabee's campaign, and that could be all it takes in a race this close. 
It's just sad that our society has become so commercialized to the point where it influences critical issues for the welfare of our country.

By CHRIS McGRADY 
Assistant Scene Ediror 

Tom Hanks' predictability, is beginning to bn almost laughable. 
Before all you fans out there get angry, it does not mean that his roles are type­cast, or that he is struggling. Hather it seems that these days, any movie star­ring Hanks is instantly good. 
Such is the case in "Charlie Wilson's War." where Hanks once again turns in an imprnssive performance. He plays Texas congressman Charlie Wilson, and 
Charlie Wilson's War 
Director: Mike Nichols Starring: Tom Hanks, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julia Roberts 
the story follows him as he tries to gar­ner support to help Afghanistan rid itself of Soviet oppression. When Wilson visits Afghanistan and views the refugee camps left in the wake of Soviet bomb­ing, he launches a campaign to garner American support to help Afghanistan liberate itself from Soviet control. 
Hank's whiskey-swilling, straight-talk­ing character is likeable from the begin­ning. Opposite of Hanks is Julia Roberts, playing Texas aristocrat Joanne Herring. Roberts turns in a decent performance, but is probably the least-believable char­acter in the film. Her Southern drawl sounds tepid and she is some­times outshined by her co­
actors. One remarkable thing about her performance is how good she looks in a bikini at age 40 and after three children. She plays the sixth-richest woman in Texas, and with her political influence, she helps Hanks raise awareness of the 

Soviet atrocities. 

However, the real show-steal­er of the film is Philip Seymour Hoffman, who is quickly solidi­fying himself as one of Hollywood's best talents. Hoffman plays CIA agent Gust Avrakotos, a quick-tem­pered and sarcastic character who works with Hanks. Hoffman has already garnered a bid for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and more awards are sure to follow. Hoffman repeat­edly steals the scene from the other actors, and his energy is palpa­ble. The greatest thing about his performance is the realism of how he portrays his character. Hot-headed, quick-to-react, but obvious­ly intelligent, Hoffman plays the role of Avrakotos perfectly. Without him, "Charlie Wilson's War" would not be nearly as strong. 
The film also stars Amy Adams as Wilson's assistant Bonnie Bach. Adams' portrayal is quite good, albeit forget­table. However, she does a great job with what she is given and turns in a strong 
performance. 

"Charlie Wilson's War" was nominated for five Golden Globes -Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy), Best Actor (Hanks), Best Supporting Actor (Hoffman), Best Supporting Actor (Roberts) and Best Screenplay (Aaron Sorkin). 
The film is directed by Mike Nichols and is based off of the book (and true story) by George Crile. It was adapted for film by Sorkin, and the screenplay is full of sharp dialogue and brilliant lan­guage. 
All in all, the film is a very strong screenplay supported by several stellar actors.

NBA 

O'Neal out for two weeks after positive MRI 
Miami star sidelined with hip and leg pain, will miss at least six games as disappointing season continues 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -Shaquille O'Neal will miss at least the next two WPeks becausp, of n~cur­ring pain in his left hip and lng, the latest piece of disap­pointing rwws for the rneling Miami llnat. 
An MHI nxam performed Tuesday on O'Neal's ailing hip found acutn inllammation in that joint and his quadri­ceps muscle. lin will be trPatnd with ice, but won't do any basketbal1-n~lated activi­ty-with hopes that rest will r.ure the problem. 
O'Neal will miss at least six games, barring a change in the rehabilitation schedule. The earliest he could return under the timntable released by the team is Feb. 6 at I>Pt.roit. 
"llis activity, the activity, is exacerbating it," said Heat coach Pat Hiley, whose team has lost 14 straight games, three shy of matehing the franchise rneord. "That's all. That's what happens. lie's trying to do everything he do. Ill~ 's gotten all the treatment hn ean get. And now it's probably going to be an inac­tive period of time until the thing hPals." 
O'Neal was not available to rnporters Tuesday. lie has missed an average of 20 games over thn past six sea­sons because of an array of injuries, and still has two full seasons after this remaining on his five-year, $100 million contraet with Miami. 
Other tests done Tuesday, including bloodwork, ruled out the possibility of infec­tion or other problems, the team said. 

O'Neal suffered the hip injury while diving for a loose ball against Utah on Dee. 22 -the last game Miami won. lie missed eight games from Dec. 28 through .Jan. 11, sought treatment in Los Angeles over that stretch, and returned when the Heat started their cur­rent seven-game homestand .Jan. 16. 
O'Neal left Monday's game against Cleveland in the first quarter to have the hip re­taped, then returned to the game with a noticeable limp. lie finished with 10 points, none after halftime. 
lie's averaging a career­low 14.2 points this season, and his string of 14 straight All-Star Game selections ­which matches a league record -almost seems cer­tain to end because of his latest malady. 
lleat guard Dwyane Wade, who scored 32 of Miami's 38 second-half points in Monday's 97-90 loss to Cleveland. said it's tough to continue watching O'Neal play in obvious pain. 
"lie's judged more than a lot of the ·athletes in the world because of who he is, who he has become," Wade said. "If he's playing and hurting and not playing good, he's being talked about. If he's not playing and he's try­ing to get healthy, then he's being talked about for taking 
time off. It's a lose-lose situ­
ation. As his friend, I want 
him to be healthy. That's the 
most important thing to us." 
Mark Blount likely will become Miami's new starting center, now that O'Neal and Alonzo Mourning (season­ending knee and quadriceps injuries) are hurting. Centers .Joel Anthony and Earl Barron are also on the Heat roster, although they've com­bined to play 207 minutes this season. 
Depending on how long O'Neal is out, Hiley said the team might try to add anoth­er big man for depth. 
"We'll talk about it," Riley said. 
For now, Blount -who started 81 games for Minnesota last year and who has averaged 5. 7 points in 16 minutes per game this sea­son -will be the primary pivot man Miami, which has the Eastern Conference's worst reeord at 8-32. 
When Blount was acquired before the season in a trade, he expected to spend the year playing alongside O'Neal and Mourning and helping the Heat get back to their championship form from two seasons ago. 
"It's been different," Blount said. "There's nothing I can do about that. Nothing you can really say. The team is looking at me to try to help them out right now. or course, you want to be there with Shaq and be there with Zo, but that's not the situa­tion right now."

Defending champion Serena Williams ousted in quarterfinals by third-ranked ]elena Jankovic in two sets 
Associated Press 
MELBOUHNE Sernna 
Williams stumbled onn round 
short of a rnmatch, so Maria 
Sharapova had to unload a 
ynar's worth of r!'tribution on 
somnbody Plsn. 
.Justine llnnin caught tho 
brunt of it. 
Sharapova advancnd to tlw 
Australian Opnn semifinals for 
tho fourth straight ynar with a 
convindng 6-4. 6-0 win ovPr 
top-ranked IIPnin, snapping 
tlw Bnlgian star's 32-mal.ch 
winning streak. 
"EvPn though I bnat .lustinP. 
it's ddinitely not ovnr," tlw 
20-ynar-old Hussian star said. 
"I still have a lot of business to 
tako earn of." 
l>nfnnding champion 
Williams had slumped 6-3, 6-4 
narlier in thP afternoon to 
third-rankNI Jelnna Jankovic, 
who n~aelwd the semifinals at 
Mnlbourne Park for the first 
tinw and only the third timP in 
a major. 
Williams was unseeded and 
ranked No. X1 when she made 
her stunning run to an eighth 
Grand Slam title 12 months 
ago, punctuating that with an 
omphatie 6-1, 6-2 win over 
Sharapova in one of the most 
lopsided Grand Slam finals. 
It was a big setback for Sharapova, who struggled with a shoulder problem for most of the season and her ranking slipped outside the top 5. 
But the winner of two Grand Slam events started returning to her best at the WTA cham­pionships in November before losing in three sets to !lenin in throe hours, 24 minutes ­among the dozen longest women's tour matches in the Open ora. 
She turned the tables in only 1:3X on Tuesday, inflicting the first 6-0 set on llenin since 2002. 
"I n~ally felt like I was in a bubbln," Sharapova said. "I think it was one of the most consistent matches where I did all the things I wanted to do. and I did them corrnctly from tho beginning to the (md ... and just played the way I ean play." 
!lenin. who struggled with her serve and was broken live limns by Sharapova. said she had a minor concern over a lingering knee injury but put the loss down as an inevitabil­ity. 
"ll's very hard to be at your best love! all the time," she said. "''ll have to think about that and build again for the future." 
Sharapova will be looking back for lnssons to take into tlw semis against Jankovic, hnr old tnnnis academy pal. 
"Evnr since the juniors wn'vn always played rnally tough and we've always bat­t.lnd it out. and it's great to see hnr in tlw smnis." Sharapova said. "It's gn~at wn're playing tognthnr."

Agnieszka Hadwanska. 
On the men's side, Serbia's 
Novak Djokovic plays David 
Ferrer of Spain and defending 
champion Roger FederPr go 
against No. 12 James Blake. 
Blake is 0-7 against Federer, 
who beat him in the 2006 U.S. 
Opon quarterfinals. 
But he's taking heart from 
FNiernr's last two matehes, 
when he was taken to 10-X in 
thP fifth snt against Serbia's 
.Janko Tisparevic and had to 
save set points against Tomas 
Berdyeh. 
No. 2 Hafael Nadal, the only player to beat Federer at the last 10 (;rand Slams, advanced to his f'irst Australian Opon semifinal with a 7-5, 6-3, 6-1 win over No. 24 Jarkko Nimninnn of Finland. 
"Maybe I wasn't playing my bnst match, my best tennis today, but it was enough," the three-time French Open cham­pion said. "It's a good moment for me, first semifinals on hardeourt, Grand Slam." 
lie will play 22-year-old Jo­Wilf'ried Tsonga, who beat No. 14 Mikhail Youzhny 7-5, 6-0, 7-6 {6) late Tuesday. 
The 38th-ranked Tsonga has only played four previous majors due to a combination of back, shoulder and abdomi­nal injuries and never won a title at the elite level, but has already upset No. 9 Andy Murray and No. 8 Richard Gasquet so far at Melbourne Park. 
"It's just amazing. I played just unbelievable," Tsonga said. "It's a very big event. It's very difficult to stay on this world." 
Serena Williams was that ecstatic last year after her amazing run. 
Despite being in better phys­ical condition this time around, she still could not go beyond the quarters for the fourth consecutive major. 
Williams looked sluggish and her serve misfired against Jankovic, contributing to seven service breaks. 
ShP. had time to reflect on the singles loss when she com­bined with Venus in a 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 doubles quarterfinal loss to Chinese pair Yan Zi and Zheng Jie. 
"I think that I went crazy, maybe, and I made a lot of mistakes. I didn't really play the game I wanted to play," Williams said, adding that she had some physical issues she didn't want to elaborate on. "I don't like to make excuses. We

won't discuss those." 
Williams did not seem to possess the same aggressive­ness she used to overcome match points in early rounds last year and beat six seeded players en route to the 2007 title. 
Instead, she was constantly angry with herself and even got a code violation for smash­ing her racket. 
"My shots just weren't right," Williams said. "I didn't move the way I want to move, and I wasn't feeling 100 per­cent. But as an athlete, some days you have to win feeling 30 percent. 
''I'm not going to sit here and make excuses -I lost because Jelena played better than me and I made too many errors -I think regardless, the match was on my racket, and I gave it away." 
Jankovic has been hampered by a thigh problem since help­ing Serbia to the Hopman Cup final, where it lost to the Serena Williams-led United States. 
She needed treatment dur­ing her first-round match here, when she had to save three match points, and again in the second set Tuesday. 
''I'm like a wounded animal. I still keep going," she said, adding for emphasis that she had a point to prove following 
a fourth-round loss to Williams here last year. "Getting revenge, it feels so good," Jankovic said. "I came 
out very strong, and I was going for my shots ... and that's how I hurt my oppo­nent."

time expired or Notre Dame fouled her. But Quigley tried to escape and lost the ball out of bounds, giving the Irish a chance to inbound on their end of the court. 
"I don't know why I'm thinking [of] running away from people. I should have just stayed strong with the ball," said Quigley, who finished with 16 points and seven assists. "I wanted to make it a little more interesting." 
Irish guard Ashley Barlow sent the inbounds pass to guard Tulyah Gaines, who handed the ball off to guard Charel Allen. Allen darted left to fmd a shot, but stumbled, and Blue Demon guard Holly Medley stole the ball as time expired. DePaul has now beaten Notre Dame three games in a row. 
"We were trying to set a screen for Charel," Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw said. "The ball was going to come in to Tulyah, and Undsay [Schrader] was going to screen for Charel, but it obviously never got to that point. Tulyah had a little trouble getting off the screen. 
"That's a play we run all the fune." 
Barlow scored a career-high 23 points and shot 8-of-12 from the floor. She also grabbed seven rebounds. 
DePaul shot 72 percent from the field in the first half and led 45-43 at the break. A pair of 3­point plays and a 3-pointer by guard Missy Mitidiero sent the Blue Demons on a nine-point run,. despite their committing six Williamson, who tied a career high with 16 points, sank two free throws, and Barlow dropped two quick lay-ups and three foul shots to bring Notre Dame within a point with 9:33 remaining in the game. 
DePaul found itself in foul trouble near the end of the game. Forwards Caprice Smith and Felicia Chester fouled out, and the Irish began shooting the double bonus with 7:39 left in the game. Notre Dame, however, shot only 71.4 percent from the line. 
"We missed 10 free throws. That's the difference in the game right there," McGraw said. 
After Blue Demon forward Natasha Williams hit a free throw that made the score 71­67, Allen drained a 3-pointer from the top of the key to bring the Irish within 1. 
But Notre Dame could not close the gap. Quigley converted four free throws in the final three minutes. 
Down 79-77 with 23 seconds remaining, Williams fouled Allen, sending the Irish senior to the line with a chance to tie the game. Allen made only one of two and forced Notre Dame to foul Quigley again. 
DePaul coach Doug Bruno was thrilled with what the win meant to his team, which has been struggling since a Jan. 2 loss to No. 3 Tennessee. 
"I think to come in to a place like the Joyce Center and steal one, I think it's done an unbe­lievable amount for our collec­tive team psyches," Bruno said. 
McGraw expressed her disap­
"I think we have to play zone. We obviously can't play people man-to-man," McGraw said. "We must be a zone team." 
Williamson said that the defensive improvement needed to come on both an individual and team level. 
"I think we need to have pride in our defense," she said. "I don't think we have enough energy out there, and that's going to start at practice tomor­row. 
"At some point, we have to just say, 'you know what, that's enough. I'm going to do it.' and we have to do it as a team." 
The Blue Demons took advan­tage of the man defense, moving the ball well and creating out­side shots for Quigley, Mitidiero and guard Deirdre Naughton, who had 20 points and eight rebounds. 
"Tonight was the first time we even got close to the end of the shot clock," Naughton said. "I think we had very good ball movement.'' 
Barlow hit two 3-pointers in quick succession to help the Irish grab a 17-9 lead with 13 min­utes remaining in the first half. But Notre Dame relinquished the pressure and allowed DePaul back into the game. 
"We got off to a great start, and then we gave them confi­dence," McGraw said. " ... And suddenly they get on a roll, and now a team that's reeling from a couple losses in a row, suddenly they have confidence.''

dropping seven shots from 3­point land and superstar forward Candace Parker dominating the paint for 20 points, eight boards and two blocks. 
Notre Dame's offense was ane­mic in the first half against West Virginia on Jan. 13, scoring a record-low 11 first-half points before mounting an incomplete comeback. 
Tuesday night against DePaul, however, Irish coach Muffet McGraw said that the defense was one of the most embarrass­ing she has ever seen. 
"I don't know ifwe are the worst defensive team in the country, but we are certainly the worst defensive team in the Big East," she said. " ... We have no commitment at that end of the floor whatsoever and that was an absolute disgrace." 
The loss to the Blue Demons was indicative of the way Notre Dame has played defense all sea­son. The squad gave up 80 points to Georgetown and Bowling Green and 70 points to Louisville earlier this season. The only dif­ference in those games was that Notre Dame's offense was good enough to outscore its oppo­nents. 
For the past two seasons, Notre Dame has struggled to defend the perimeter. But McGraw said after this game that the problem is at that entire end of the court. 
"I think it's a little bit of every­thing," she said. "I was really just disappointed in just everyone's defense. It's not just one person, it's really just everyone." 

defense, and McGraw said that her team must make the switch to the zone defense. 
McGraw said she needs to ren­ovate her team's defense from top to bottom immediately -but that change cannot come soon enough. 
The Irish still have to play five regular season games against ranked teams -including Sunday's contest with top-ranked Connecticut -before the Big East tournament starts on March 
8. The Irish are sure to play a quality team in the conference tournament -all 16 teams are over .500, and seven teams (including Notre Dame) are ranked. 
If Notre Dame doesn't fix its defense -a possibility, consider­ing McGraw has talked about clamping down against opponent 3-point shooting since the begin­ning oflast season -it could be in for a world of hurt over the next few months. 
The Irish have their toughest remaining games of the season (UConn excluded) on the road ­and McGraw has said all season that winning on the road in the Big East is always a challenge. 
The Irish still have time left this season to get better before the Big East championship and NCAA Tournament start in March. But ifthey don't, the team's great start will be wasted by a very disappointing finish.

Blue Demons exploit man-to-nzan scheme for victory at Joyce 
By BILL BRINK Sports Writer 
When a team on the rise meeL'i a tnam gasping for air, sometimes thn desire to breathe can prevail over normal respiration. 
DePaul, which lost three of iL'i last live games, held ofT Notre Dame for the entire second half and survived two late scoring chances to win 81-80 Tuesday at the Joyce Center, reviving the Blue Demons and adding to Notre Dame's troubles. The pulse-quickening moments near the end of the second half kept the half-full Joyce Center louder than it's been all season. 
The game should have been out of hand earlier than it was, but Allie Quigley gift-wrapped the Irish one more chance. 
After Irish guard Brittany Mallory hit two free throws to bring the Irish within 1 point with four seconds remaining, all the Blue Demon guard had to do was hold the ball while either

against ranked teams this year. Granted, two of those games were against top­five teams (75-59 against then­No. 3 Maryland on Nov. 16 and 87-63 against No. 2 Tennessee on Jan. 5). But Notre Dame has looked bad in all of those games this year. 
The worst part is, the prob­lems have been diflerent every game. 
The Terrapins were dominant from beyond the arc, punishing Notre Dame's impotent 3-point defense with 12 treys against the Irish. 
The Lady Vols had a great inside-outside offense working, with guard Angie Bjorklund

Strong freshman class adds depth to Irish team 
By KATE GRABAREK Spons Writer 
;\ftpr a strong end to the fall season, No. 12 Notre Dame will look to carry its success into the spring. 

-
.Junior Brett Helgeson and senior Sheeva Parbhu had strong showings in the fall and will be contenders for the No. 1 singles position. 
"Parbhu was an All-American 
last year. Brett IHelgeson I had that kind of fall," Notre Dame coach Bobby Bayliss said. "Either one can play the No. 1 singles position." 
llelgeson wasn't the only one tParing up the courts this fall. The team's six freshmen also made their presence known, proving that the Irish are a young team, but a deep one. 
"We are deeper than last year, Bayliss said.

-
"]Sophomore Sean] Corrigan and ].Junior Santiago) Montoya, traveled with us last year, and are competing for positions this season. We are less experi­enced but the freshmen will learn from these experiences." 
Freshman Stephen Havens proved himself to be one of the strongest young players for the Irish. Bayliss praised the Cincinnati native for his great timing and ability to make important shots. In addition, Freshman David Anderson is making great strides at net to complement his groundstrokes. 
Bayliss noted the similarity in the playing style of freshman Daniel Stahl and Helgeson. Stahl likes to bang the ball, but needs to come to the net more. 
Freshman Tyler Davis has also made contributions early in his career at Notre Dame.

Junior Santiago Montoya looks to return a volley in Notre Dame's 5-2 victory over Penn State at the Eck Tennis Pavilion on Jan. 20. The Irish are ranked No. 12 in the ITA Poll.
