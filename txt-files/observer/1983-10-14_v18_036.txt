President Reagan gave the go-ahead on yesterday for the establishment of a campaign commiltee for the re-election of himself and Vice President George Bush. Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev., who will head the effort, said "I have no doubt ... that Ronald Reagan will be a candidate for re-election." Laxalt, the general chair­man of the Republican party and the chairman of both previous Reagan campaigns for the presidency, said he would formally estab­
lish the re-election panel on Monday and file the necessary docu­ments with the Federal Election Commission. Also on Monday, the president will sign a leiter formally authorizing the step, Laxalt said, noting that "he will legally be a candidate at that point." Laxalt spoke to reporters in the White House driveway after Reagan gave him the green light. The White House press staff took pains to call attention to his visit. He said that Reagan would delay a full declaration of his candidacy until the current congressional session ends, probably shortly before Thanksgiving. "I think that his position in delaying his final announcement until after Congress adjourns is entirely ap· propriate," he said. -AP 
A 53-year-old minister in Indianapolis was held on $1 S,OOO bond Thursday after being charged with sexually ex­ploiting runaway girls, and in one case, taking them to his church's basemem, police said. The Rev. Clifton Morris of Indianapolis was booked Wednesday on four felony counts of child molesting, offi­cials said. The pastor ofthe Beech Grove Church ofGod was held in the Marion County jail on Sl 5,000 bond. The girls he is accused of molesting ranged in age from 9 to I 3, Indianapolis vice detectives said. Detective Thomas N. Wininger said Morris drove the church van or his personal t.·ar while looking for girls. He would look for young prostitutes or go to a park where runaways congregate, police said. Police alleged that Morris usually engaged in sex acts with the runaways in thc vchidcs.

Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON President Reagan on Thursday named William 
P. Clark, his national security adviser and "a God-fearing Westerner," to succeed James \X'att as secrt:tary of the interior. 
Clark, a longtime Reagan con­fidante, already is one of the most powerful men in the administration. In moving from the national security post that put Henry A. Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzzinski on the global stage, Clark would appt·ar to be' taking a step down in all but title. 
But "he is a God-fearing wester­ner, a fourth generation rancher, a person I trust and I think he will be a great secretary of the interior," Reagan said. 
The president made the stunning announcement at the end ofa talk to women leaders of Christian religious organizations. White House officials earlier had talked ofa 
"really long" list of contenders for the interior post, and virtually no one had mentioned Clark as being on it. 
According to deputy press secretary Larry Speakes, Reagan didn't even tell his inner circle ofad­visers he was considering Clark until just hours before revealing the deci­sion publicly. Speakes said Clark hadn't asked for the job; "It was the president's idea." 
Clark, S2, said he was "pleased and honored that the president has expressed his confidence in me by this nomination, and look forward to continuing my service to him and this administration." 
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker Jr. of Tennessee said he was confident Clark . would be con­firmed. 

But the environmental com­munity criticized the appointment 
: and expressed bewilderment that Reagan would choose someone with no apparent background in con­servation issues. 
"It is a preposterous appointment and an insult to the American en­vironment," said Willaim Turnage, executive director of the Wilder­ness Society. "It is the third time that President Reagan has appointed Mr. Clark to a job for which he has no apparent qualificaions ... The ap­pointment apparently is being made as a sop to the extreme right wing of

West Germans protest, want U.S. missiles out 
Associated Press 
BREMERHAVEN, West Germany -Helmeted riot police dragged away 255 anti-nuclear protesters Thursday but 2.500 others blockaded a U.S. Army base and tem­porarily sealed off a major German port. Some demonstrators handed flowers to police. 
The demonstration was the start of a three-day protest against NATO deployment of new ll.S. nuclear missiles in Western Europe. It marks the start of a series of anti-nuclear protests scheduled around West Germany in the next I 0 days in what the peace movement bills as its "hot autumn." 
The protesters were carted away from the Carl Schurz Barracks and adjoining Midgard Harbor, where 
U.S. ammunition and supplies are unloaded. The protesters went limp in a display of passive resistance, while other demonstrators shouted, "Let them go!" and chanted "We don't want your weapons." 
Police Chief Eckart Naumann said all but 55 of the protesters detained were released. The 55 were iden­tified as "troublemakers" and will be held until the protest is over. he said. 
Armored police personnel car­riers were backed hy some 6,000 of­ficers. including 5,000 riot police and border guards brought in from surrounding cities to prevent violence during the three-day blockade. 
Police said the heavy security was a response to unsigned leaflets dis­tributed in recent weeks by anti· nuclear activists who urged violence against the base. But there has been no violence so far. 
A U.S. Army spokesman confirmed that ground traffic had been halted to and from the base. Helicopters were seen landing at the base throughout the day. 
The Army refused to say whether personnel had been ordered to stay on base during the demonstration. 
U.S. military sources earlier had said such a "lock-in" would be put into 
effect  at  any  base  temporarily  
blockaded  by  German  
demonstrators.  

Ships ferried shift workers to the docks, and work inside the shipyards continued as usual, the officials said. 
The Midgard port, used by the American Military Sealift Command to bring supplies and ammunition into the country, has become a tar­get ofthe West German peace move­ment. An estimated 25 percent of the goods unloaded at the Midgard harbor are for the U.S. Army. 
Protest organizers predicted 30,000 demonstrators would be on the scene by Saturdav.

Jesse Jackson calls for formation of nationwide minority coalition 
Associated Press 

EVANSVILLE, Ind. -A new coali­
tion of blacks, women and hispanics 
can change the outcome of the na­
tional, state and local elections 
throughout the country, the Rev. 
JesseJackson said Thursday. 

Jackson also said that coalition 
may make possible his own can­
didacy for president. 

The civil rights leader was not ac­tually in Indiana on Thursday. He was in Houston but was connected with I4 Indiana cities through a telephone hookup. 
"There must be ...a new coali­
tion of small farmers, poor whites, 
blacks, hispanics and others to re­
direct the course of this nation and 
changes its leadership," Jackson 
said. 

The issues being raised by tbe 
Rainbow Coaltion are not just im­
portant to blacks or hispanics but af­
fect everyone in the country, he 
said. 

Jackson, who is of! leave from his post as president ofOperation Push, is being mentioned as a possible can­didate for national office and he did not preclude that possibility provid­ing certain conditions are met. 
But having one black man elected

to national office is not as significant as "changing the political priorities from the bottom up," Jackson said. 
Jackson said he would rather have I0,000 disadvantaged or effectively disenfranchised people running for local offices from sheriff to school board than having one black running for president. 
Nonetheless, Jackson said he is 
exploring the chances for his own 
candidacy. One of the major factors 
of that candidacy is finding out if 
there is support for it. 
And, as with any political race 
these days, that support must be 
measured, at \east in part, in terms of 
dollars. 
"If the money market test is positive .. .it would be an encourag­ing note," Jackson said. "It's impor­tant to see where the money is and where it is coming from." 
The barometer is whether S5,000 can be raised in 20 states so a can­didacy can qualify for matching funds, Jackson said. 
Jackson said he is not abandoning the Democratic party in this bid, nor is he "brokering for a personal posi­tion." 
The Rainbow Coalition is the "progressive wing" of the party which is looking for "a fundamental renegotiation of our relationship with the Democratic party." 

The party is going to have to make efforts to open up its processes to blacks, women, hispanics and others ifit wishes to count on the tradition­al support of those groups, jackson said. 
The Republicans, he said, were making inroads into that traditional constituency by running minorities and women in many areas, including the south. 
Michael Malone, an Evansville member of the Rainbow Coalition, said more teleconferences will be held in others states because it provides exposure relatively cheap­ly. 
Malone said inviting members of the general public to the con­ferences also provides something else. 
"Teleconferences with the media and community people keep the media honest," Malone said. "There is a very real concern that the press, in terms of trust, leaves a lot to be desired." 
The conferences were held in An­derson, Bloomington, Evansville, Fort Wayne, Gary, Indianapolis, jef­fersonville, Kokcmo, Lafayette, Marion, Muncie, Richmond, South Bend and Terre Haute.

Israeli defense minister resigns after failure of new monetary plan 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM -Finance Minister Yoram Aridor:resigned Thursday, hours after · he proposed a revolutionary scheme that would have linked the Israeli economy to the American dollar. 
Aridor's plan to solve Israel's economic crisis was immediately as­sailed from all sides. Opponents said it would surrender Israeli indepen­dence and t1.1rn the country into America's "5I~t state." The Cabinet called an emergency session to dis­cuss it, and a few minutes after the meeting began Aridor emerged and announced his resignation. 
With Aridor gone his "dollarization" plan collapsed within 12 hours of its first publica­tion. But Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's newly installed govern­ment faced its first Cabinet crisis.

Two 21 I.D.'s required for each card 

when his resignation takes effect Saturday were Energy Minister Yitzhak Modai and former Defense Minister Ezer Weizman. 
But Modai faces opposition inside his own divided Liberal Party in the governing Likud bloc, while Weiz­man's dovish views are unpalatable to the right-wing nationalist side of the Cabinet. 
The dollarizati.on ;drama began Thursday morning when the daily Yedioth Ahronoth reported that Aridor was proposingto cure Israel's money troubles" by wiring its economy into the American dollar. 
Aridor confirmed the report, saying he believed dollarization ~ his own term -would reduce Is­rael's triple-digit annual inflation to the level of inflation of other Wes­tern economies. 
As Aridor explained it, Israel's existing !>)'stem of automatically compensating salary earners for in­flation had led to "terrible distor­tions in the economy." Wages and prices were constantly pushing each other up, and "somewhere along the line we have to break this vicious circle." 
Thus he proposed linking all salaries and debts to the dollar and abolishing compensation for infla­tion. 
The proposal was met with outrage from within the Cabinet as well as from the political opposition. Aridor's critics charged that the plan would leave Israel entirely at the mercy ofAmerican benevolence. 
Thus dollarization struck a tt·nder national nerve. Many Israelis talked about Israel becoming "the 5 I st state ofthe t'nited States." 
Dollars already are deeply em­bedded in the Israeli economy. Many prices are set in dollars to avoid constant calculation of the· shekel rate. Dollar bank accounts are legal and popular as protection against inflation. 
Aridor had said dollarization could ultimately lead to the dollar becoming legal tender in Israel alongside the shekel, which was in­troduced in October 1980 at a value of 17 cents, and is now worth 1.2~ cents. The shekel was chosen w replace the lira inherited from British rule in Palestine. Its name is taken from the biblical Israelite measure for gold and it was con­sidered a symbol of renewed Israeli independence.

In this diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend, Notre Dame has give-n the hest response to the May 1983 Bishops' Pa...tc raJ Letter on Peace. 
Notre Dame's academic course, Nuclear Dilem­ma, is a high level answer to the hishop's plea for enlightened study and research on the complex moral questions raised hy the unprecedented production of weapons for mass destruction of millions ofpe >pie. 
I hclieve, however, as do my hrother bishops, that the supt r-powers' present day potential to destroy a vast amount of God's own creation is so threatening and ominous that reasonahlc persons

individual in tht· J.S. and U.S.S.R. faces today.

quickly can sense the need for God's intervention 
to prevent a global nuclear holocaust. 
The bishops have recommended prayer, abstinence from meat on Fridays, fasting from food, and good deeds ofcharity as tried and proven efficacious ways to implore God's mercy and help. 
More than any other group in this diocese, Notre Dame students have been serious about this recommendation. I particularly commend the stu­dents' idea of"fasting for a purpose," i.e. to eat les_s so that hungry people, benefiting from alms derived from fasting, will have something to eat. 
On Notre Dame's forthcoming day offast on Oc­

:No second chance with nuclear weapons 
tremcly concerned about this situation. The gun at our heads is the reality of the world. Man now has the means of completely destroying all of civilization, and the destructive potentials grow daily. 
This prospect is unprecedented in the human experience. This fortunate lack of his­torical precedent is perhaps the biggest obstacle to the problem's solution. 
A sign outside the gates of Dachau says "Never Again." The Holocaust, because it has happened and is embedded in man's historical experience, may hdp prevent future Holocausts. 
Modern man knows what he is capable of doing, and this awareness reduces the pos­sibility of future brutality on the order of Nazism. A nuclear holocaust, will teach man no lessons, as there may be no one left to learn them. 
The prospect of nuclear war is so uni­maginable and horrific that our minds cannot grasp it. Man has enough trouble understand­ing the prospect of his own death, let alone that ofthe human race. 
tober 16-I 7 I will be in Rome to give the Pope a report on this diocese. In a face-to-face interview with him I intend to extoll Notre Dame's solid Christian traditions, and for an update, I'll tell the Holy Father about the students' Day of Fast. 
Please do it up big and get everybody into it. Be sure the fast is accompanied by prayers for peace, particularly prayers for the intercession of "Notre Dame," Queen ofPeace. 
Bishop William E. McManus 

This possibility exists, however, and to prevent it man must overcome his narrow vi­sion ofthe everyday world and come to terms with the prospect of total genocide. A super­human effort may be required, but there is no alternative. 
Imagine, again, ifevery time the negotiators sat down they each had guns at each other's heads, and back home in their respective countries their children and everyone they knew also had guns at their heads. The reality of possible destruction would be so vivid, so within their grasp, that they would force themselves to reach some agreement to get the cursed guns offtheir heads. 
No government, it seems, would be able to 
withstand the pressure of a population held 
hostage by these hideous individual means of 
destruction a way would be found to get rid of 
them. There would be little talk ofthe number 
ofguns each person had strapped to his head, 
or the calibre ofthose guns. 
Distinctions ofthrow-weights and numbers of launchers would instantly fade as each in­dividual realized the possibility of sudden death and cried out for his release from this crystal clear threat. 
Nuclear annihilation is not a pleasant thought. Its . character, however, makes it none the less real nor any less likely. Ignoring the prospect of snuffing out our civilization will not make that threat go away. 

The guns are at our heads, and ifwe are to rid ourselves of them, we must acknowl­edge their presence and learn how they got there in the first place. They will not fall offof their own accord, only we can remove them. 
It is long past time that citizens took the issue of nuclear weapons (i.e. the fate of the earth) out of the hands of the "experts," the technologists, the generals and the politicians. Given the present level of destructive poten­tials, it seems they haven't done a very good job. 
If you want to learn more about the gun at your head, and how it might be disposed of, check out Ground Zero, a non-advocacy campus group that promotes education on the question ofnuclear arms.

Irish hit road again to overrun Army 

By CHUCK FREEBY 
Sports Writer 
On the road again I just can 'I tl'aif to get on the road again The life flow is making music uitb myfriends AndI can't uait to get on the road again 
Gerry Faust and Willie Nelson don't have much in com­
mon, but both should be familiar with this tune by now. 
Nelson's reason for knowing these words are obvious; 
but in Faust's case, it's because the Irish are preparingfor 
their fourth consecutive road game tomorrow afternoon 
when they take on Army in the Meadowlands ofEast Rut­
herford, N.J. at 1 p.m. EST. A capacity crowd of 76,891 is 
expected to be on hand for the 45th renewal ofthis tradi­
tional football rivalry. 
While some people may already have put this one in the victory column for the Irish, Faust knows not to take the 2-3 Cadets lightly. "Army is a talented football team." notes the Irish coach. "Theycould very easily be 4-I right now. They will give us a tough test." 
Indeed, first-year Army coach jim Young's team has quite a bit ofunpublicized talent. Speedy halfback Elton Atkins has been the heart ofthe Cadet attack this season, collecting 370 yards rushing and 122 yards receiving in the first five games. Atkins is a triple-threat, as he dis­played last week in the Cadets' 20-I2 victory over Rut­gers. Against the Scarlet Knights, the 5-l0, I85-pound junior ran for I 50 yards, threw for a touchdown pass, and caught several passes coming out of the backfield. This 
week, Atkins ranks third in the nation in all-purpose rus­
hing, and he will pose a constant danger to the Irish 
defense. 
When the Cadets aren't running the football, they rely 
on one ofthree quarterbacks to execute a fine passing at­
tack. Rob Healy is the starting quarterback, but he suf­
fered an injury in the Harvard game, and is questionable 
for Saturday's contest. The sophomore signal-caller has 
amassed some impressive stats in the first five contests, 
completing 44 of76 passes for 576 yards and one touch­
down. These statistics have not escaped Faust's attention. 
"Their passing game is excellent," says Faust. "Coach 
Young always has a complex offensive scheme." 
Faust knows ofYoung's talents first-hand. In his first 
year as coach ofthe Irish, Faust took his team to Purdue to 
take on Young's Boilermakers in West Lafayette. The Irish 
fell victim to the upset bug, as they lost I S-14 on some 
pinpoint passing by Scott Campbell in the final seconds. 

By the time the Boilers came to South Bend in 19H2, Young had yidded the coaching reigns to Leon Burtnett in order to assume a position as assistant athletic director at Purdue. 
However. after eighteen years as a college football coach, Young missed being on the sidelines on Saturday, and was one ofthe first people to apply for the Army job left open by the firing of Ed Cavanaugh last December. It didn't take the Cadet athletic stafflongto hire the veteran 
mentor. 

While Young will certainly try to confuse the Irish with multiple formations, the Irish will rely on execution of the basics to beat the Cadets. The Irish ground attack has been in high geru;, thanks to a fine job done by the Irish line. Sophomore tailback Allen Pinkett is one ofthe na­tion's top rushers, averaging nearly I05 yards per con­test. His darting style ofrunning is complemented by bruising fullbacks Chris Smith and Mark Brooks, who have been running over people when the holes have not been available. Smith had his best game ofthe year against South Carolina last Saturday, picking up 75 yards on 11 carries. 
On the rare occasions when the ground game stalls, Steve Beuerlein provides the Irish with a potent passing attack. The freshman quarterback has assumed his start­ing role nicely, completing 31 of 51 passes for 458 yards and two touchdowns. Most importantly, however, Beuer­lein has yet to throw an interception in two-and-a-half games, and has found a variety ofIrish receivers. 
While the Irish offense has been formidable, the Army 
defense has been just as strong, allowing opponents only 
20 points a game this season. The Cadet defense is led by 
the linebacking tandem of)im Gentile and John Roney. 
Gentile leads all Black Knight tacklers with 73 stops, 
while Roney places second with 60 tackles. While the 
linebackers have been the key to Young's 5-2 defense, the 
defensive ends have been solidifying the Cadet line. 
Seniors Larry Carroll and Glen Veevaert have been tough 
on opposing quarterbacks, making up for a lack ofsize 
with great quickness. The weak spot ofthe Cadet defense 
appears to be the middle ofthat line, as Army has allowed 
nearly 200 yards a game on the ground, while only giving 
up 122 yards via the pass. 
Meanwhile, the Irish defense has risen to the occasion 
in the last two outings, allowing only a touchdown and a 
field goal against Colorado and South Carolina. Middle 
linebacker Tony Furjanic paces the defensive unit with

The Army Game: 
ND owes a lot to 

Cadets for rich history 
By LOUIE SOMOGYI 
Sports Writer 
For the sixth straight week. the Notre Dame football learn will be facing a team that is trying to regain nationwide respect. 
Despite struggling itselffor the past couple ofyears. a victory over any Notre Dame football team is regarded by any rebuilding football team as a step in the right direc­tion. 
A victory over Notre I?amc represents not only the defeat ofa nationally-renownt:d institution. but also the defeat ofits legends and !orcs-Rockne, The Four Horse­man, The "Gippcr." 
There is probably no team in the nation that would like to defeat the legend and lore of Notre Dame more than the Army. That's because no team is more responsible for helping create such legend and lore for Notre Dame than the Army teams of the past. 
It was 70 years ago that Notre Dame first met Army. The Cadet football team then, and up until World War II, was regarded as, not only the "Beast ofThe East," but also as one ofthe great powerhouse football teams in the na­tion. 
Meanwhile, the Notre Dame football program in I9I3 consisted ofsome very obscure talent. The teams ofthe previous two years had gone undefeated, but victories over St. Viator, Morris Harvey, Ohio Northern, and Wabash were not exactly wins that gained nationwide respect. In order to help make a name for the small Cath­olic Midwestern School, Head Coach jesse Harper scheduled Army as the fourth game for the 19I3 season. 
Just before the players departed for summer vacation that year, quarterback Gus Dorais and wide receiver Knute Rockne were given a football by Harper and wc;re told to throw it around in their leisure time. A rule change that would become effective that fall had removed all restrictions on the length of a forward pass (still regarded as a very radical concept in football). Dorais and Rockne prm:eedcd to practice all summtTat a beach resort in Cedar Point. Ohio.

Mike (;oJic ha' been a part of Notre Dwnt·liJOthall 
longer than hh junior ra 1king would seem to indicatt·, 
Some may a'k how thh i, po,,ihle, hut those who are at 
all Luniliar with the lamb\' namt· know very clearly why 
this is tht' CISl'. 
t )Jdcst brotht-r Bob\\ as a member of the lrhh foot­
b,lll 'quad Irom I'P'i 10 llJ~H. during which time hh 
play t'\Tntually earned Ilim unanimous all-America 
recognition as a lim·hac .;n during his senior year. 
And brother<;reg, as< nior this year, is also a member 
of the ti>Otball team. Ik is an offensive tackle. 
Ilaving bel'!I exposed to Notre Dame football for so 
long. it'' no wonder that c;olic. like his hrothers, also 
cho,t· to he a a part ol tl e program, and he explains his 
feelings \'l'f\' dearly.,, II ad tome to this place so many 
t tnll"s when Bobby wa' h :rc I saw tht· people I saw the 
'' h11k atmo.sphere of th< campus and of the football 
program and Isaid to nty ,dfthat it was great ant d that I 
wanted to he a part of it.' says the management major 
from \\'illowid.. Ohio ":,o when Coach Faust called. I 
anTptnl right away. and just told all the other colleges 
that I had t·ommittt·d." 
When it t·amt· to making tht· final decision, some may 
think that what intluencnl the younger Golic's decision 
to comt· to Notrt· Dame was the fact that he had an Ali­
Aml'fican brother alrl'ady graduate, and another 
brother currently enrollt:tl. But he ensurt:s that tht: 
dt·dsion was ldt t:ntirdy with him. "Wht:n rt:cruiting 
started, Bobhy came up o mt: and said, 'Don't think that 
you have to go to Notn: Dame hecause I went there or 
bt'l.'ause (;reg's tht:rt: n1 w. You have an opportunity to 
go to a lot ofdifft:rt:tlol p· aces so you should look 
around."' 
Since coming to Notr_. Dam<:, c;oJic has steadily im­. provnl and has seen int reasingly more playing time. 
Serving mostly as a tack e and mt·mber of the punt 
return squad his freshm 111 year. Golic playt·d in all but 
tlw Michigan gamt·. II is longest appt·arance of the 
season ctme against 1\li;~mi when he playt·d for devt:n 
minutt·s. During that tin t' he was creditt:d with sevt:"n 
tackks, three of which \'.'tTl' unassisted. 
In I1lHl, (;olic played in all dt:vt·n games while st·rv­
ing as backup to Kevin (.ritl1th at the end posttion. lie 
did, howt·vt-r, earn a Maningassignmcnt against Arizona 
wht·n (;riffith was hurt, 1s wdl as one versus Air Force 
liJIIowing Mike Gann·~ ~nee surgery. In that game, ht: 
started at flip tackk. 

Golic secured his starting position for this season with an impressive spring performance that was high­lighted by the Defensive MVP award in tht: Blut:-Gold game. 
So far this st·ason (;olic has heen a stt:adily improving playl'f, and head ddcnsive line coach Greg Blache is wdl aware of his an:omplishmc:nts. "It's a ert:dit to Mike that he is bettn each time he comes out," Blache says. "To see him get hetter each day is what b most pleasing to me. He is maturing into the position and each week you see Mikt: involved in more and more big plays and becoming more ofa force in our defense. The more experience he gains, the more it helps him." 
This season Golic is taking up for the highly talented (;ritl1th. and Blache t:mphasizes that t:xperience is a key ingredient to filling such a role. "You havt: to r<:member that Kevin Griffith was a fifth-year player," says Blache. "Mike is just a junior and as a coach I can't emphasize enough the importanct: ofexperience. You can't go to the bookstore and buy it. You just have to go out and earn it. and I think that Mike is earning his stript:s through <:xperience. Getting ht:tter each week is asign of a good playt:r." 
After five games, Golic has accumulatt:d .30 tackles which places him third on tht: team hehind linebackers Tony Furjanic and Mike Kovaleski. Nine ofhis stops have hcen hehind the line accounting for 27 yards in losses. In this category, he leads the team. In last Satur­day's game against South Carolina, Golic led the team with eleven tackles. 
Getting ready for this season, Golic set what he con­sidered to be a necessary goal for himself. "I had to get stronger," he says. "In high school I didn't lift weights early enough and it showed when I came here. It really showed freshman year and even sophomore year, so for this season I worked out really hard with Greg and Boh­hy. Now I fed a lot stronger. It's helped on the field too, in that hdort: I had to use more finesse with players, wht:reas now I am able to take tht:m on more physical­ly." 
The importanct: ofbdngphysical is crucial to heing a good playn and Blache admires Golic's desire to make himsdf more physical. "When Mike realized he had to hccome a physical playt:r to he successful on this level, he went and worked hard in the weight room and im­proved his strength as well as mental toughness," says Blache. "The difference between Mike Golic today and last year is that he has become a physical, intimidating player." Being 6-5 and 250 pounds also must be looked at as somewhat ofan asset. 
Living up to a reputation is often ditfacult, not only to do, hut to deal with as well. Golic has had to play under tht: dose scrutiny of many observ<:rs sine<: the great career of his brother Boh, yet he feds no pressure. "I nt:ver looked at it as having to live up to a reputation," he says. "I knew Bohby cam<: here and did a great job. My whole family told me that people are going to tell you that you havt· some hig shoes to fill, but I just don't look at it that way. I just look at it that I'm going to com<: in and play Mike Golic's way offoothall. Things Bobby 
did, Iwould set as goals for mysdf. Because he achieved so much, it's something to shoot for, but as far as think­ing that I have to be as good as him or I fail -I don't 
agree with that at all." 
The Golics art: a dose family and this is something that Mike is v<:ry proud of. "Just us(brothers) alone, we arc very. dose. We go out a lot together in the summer. We work out together and we run together," he says. "My father even drills us in the off-season, evt:n Bohby, and they aren't easy workouts either. My father played a year at Indiana, in the Marines, and about sevt·n years professionally in Canada so he knows how to work us hard. My mother, she provides support. She's bt·t·n through it so long, she knows how to handk things and what to say. They both come to every home game, and if the away game is dose, they go to it too. Sometimes they'll even go right from here to the stadium in Cleveland ifBobhy has a game with the Browns. They really enjoy it alL Without their help and support we couldn't have achieved anything we have." 
In addition.to football, Golic is also a heavyweight wrestler and he feels that this helps him get ready for football. "Wrestling helps quickness, strength and leverage," he says. "All of these are very important for football so I think the two tie together very welL" 
Just as with football, older brother Boh is a big help with Mike's wrestling as welL The two train together and, "Bob provides stiffcompetition." 
For the time being, however, it is foothall season and Golie's services are needed as a defensive end. And with six games still to play, there are many chances for him to become <:ven better. When Golie looks at the remaining season, his goal is not far reaching. "I just hope to im­prove every game, play as hard as I can and be able to look in the mirror after the game and say that I played as well as I could." 
lfhoth Golic and his teammates continue to improve as they have over the last several weeks, there should be many satisfied reflections in the locker room mirrors.

That fall, 18 Notre Dame players with a total of 14 
cleats traveled from South Bend to Buffalo by train before 
heading to West Point. Many wore their jerseys on the 
ride in ordt:r to save luggage space, and each man carried 
his own equipment. No pre-game steak dinners were 
provided, either. The team had to stick with sandwiches 
provided hy the school refectory for the trip. 
"There was no pampering in those days," recalled 
Rocknt:. "We wanted none ofit." 

Despite entering the game with a 3-0 mark, the rag-tag 
Notre Dame outfit was rated as a heavy underdog against 
the classy Cadet team which had a player named Dwight 
Eisenhower as a reserve. 

The "Air Power" attack ofNotre Dame was unveiled to 
the nation for the first time by Harper. Dorais completed 
14 of his 17 passes that afternoon for 243 yards as the 
befuddled Army team simply did not know how to adjust 
to the sophisticated new weaponry. Nothing was more 
stunning than a 40-yard bomb that was thrown to Rockne 
for one ofthe touchdowns in the 35-13 Notre Dame rout. 
"Everybody seemed astonished," wrote Rockne later 
on. "There had heen no hurdling, no tackling, no plung­
ing, no crushing offiber and sinew. Just a long distance 
touchdown by rapid transit. At the moment when I 
touched the ball, life for me was complete." 
Meanwhile, theNew York Times reported the next day 
that, "The Westerners flashed the most sensational foot­
hall ever seen in the East." 

Notre Dame now had a name. Thus, this victory over 
the Army is regarded as the single most important tri­
umph in Notre Dame football history. The Irish went on 
to post a final mark of 7-0 that season. 
Eleven years later, Rockne guided Notre Dame to its 
first national championship. The victory that propelled 
Notre Dame to its heights once again came against a 
powerful Army team in the season's third game. 
Before the 1.3-7 triumph against the Cadets, Notre 
Dame's starting backfield was known as one of the 
lightest in college football history (the heaviest of the 
group weighed 162 pounds). By the next morning, they 
became the most famous backfield in college football his­
tory. 

America woke up the next day to read Grantland Rice's story ofthe game which was to become the grandd~ddy ofall sports literature. 
"Outltned against a blue-gray Octobersky, the FourHorseman rode again. In dramatic lore they are known as Famine, Pestilence, Destruction, and Death. These are on(y aliases. Their real names are Stuhldreher, Miller, Crowley, and Layden. They formed the crest ofthe South Bend cyclone before which anotherfighting Armyfoot­ball team wassweptovertheprecipiceat thePolo Grounds yesterday afternoon, as 55,000 spec­tatorspeereddown on the bewilderingpanorama spread on the green plain below. A cyclone can't he snared. It may be surrounded, but somewhere it breaks through to keep going When the cyclone starts from South Bend, where the candle ltghts stillgleam through the Indiana sycamores, those in the way musttake to storm cellars at top speed. Yesterday the cyclone struck again, as Notre Dame beat the Army, 13 to 7, with a set ofback­field stars that ripped and crashed through a strong Army defense with more speed andpower than the warring cadets could meet." 
The granddaddy ofall sports stories in America followed four years later -cnce again against Army. 

In 1928, adversity hit Notre Dame football for the first time in quite a while. The Irish lost four of their nine games that year. The feeling was that Rockne had let tht: game pass him by. Calls were made for him to step down. The team, meanwhile, was decimated with injuries. Ful­lback Freddie Collins would have to play the upcoming game against the highly-ranked Army team with his arm in a cast. It was the moment Rockne had been waiting for for eight years. 
Eight years earlier, his greatest player ever made a spe· cia! request on his deathbed. 
"Sometime, Rock, when the team is up against it, when things are going wrong and the breaks

are beating the boys -tell them to go in there 
with all they've got and winjust onefor the Gip­
per.ldon't know u;here I'll be then, Rock. ButI'll 
know about it, and/'II be happy." 
just before the down-trodden Irish team was ready to take the field at Yankee Stadium, Rockne sat the team down, silently retold the story, paused for effect, and then stated, "This is the game." 
"There was no one in the room that wasn't crying, including Rockne and me," recalled line coach, Ed Healy. "There was a moment ofsilence, and then all ofa sudden those players ran out of the dressing room and almost tore the hines off the door. They were all ready to kill someone." 
The Irish didn't exactly kill Army, but their 12-6 vic­tory stunned the nation. The lore ofNotre Dame con­tinued, and the "Subway Alumni" following dramatically increased as the story of the "Gipper" captured many hearts in the nation. 
One more game against Army ranks as one ofthe greatest and most intense in Notre Dame history. 
In 1943, Notre Dame won the national championship. Due to the war in Europe, though, Head Coach Frank Leahy and his most talented players were shipped across the ocean to partake in more serious battles. Thus, the Army Cadets in 1944 and 1945, led by Heisman Trophy backfield mates "Doc" Blanchard and Glenn Davis, owned college football as they won back-to-back national championships. Included in those years were the two greatest defeats ever administered on Notre Dame teams 
-59-0 in 1944 and 48-0 in 1945. 
In 1946, Leahy, along with some of the greatest talent 
in Notre Dame history, returned to the campus. The Irish 
and the Cadets, the two top teams in the nation had a 
showdown for the national championship that year 
before 74,121 fans at Yankee Stadium. It is estimated that 
over five million dollars was wagered on this game as the 
gambling element in collegiate sports came into full 
force. 
The war cry for the Irish players was "Fifty-nine and 
forty eight, this is the year we retaliate." The student 
body got into the act, too. They sent daily hate mail to 
Army Head Coach Earl Blaik that was signed "SPATNC (Society for the Prevention ofArmy's Third National Championship)." 
The game ended in a 0-0 tie and is most remembered for a single tackle. Ironically, for all his tremendous ex­ploits as a Heisman Trophy winning quarterback the next year,johnny Lujack is most remembered for the tackle he made as a member ofthe defensive backfield. The great Blanchard had broken into the open field on the one potential game-breaking play in this contest. Nothing was between him after his 20-yard gain but 3 7 yards ofgreen grass and Lujack. Lujack proceeded to pin Blanchard toward the sideline t s before decking him. 
Lujack is also remebered for his involvement in this game over a couple of missed tackles. 
Realizing that justone mistake could cost the team the game, an intense Lujack was incensed on the bench when a teammate missed a tackle. 
"Oh, Bob Livingstone," Lujack hollered. "You son ofa 
A stunned Leahy turned around and exploded with a livid rage against Lujack 
"Another sacrilegious outburst like that, jonathan Lujack, and you will be disassociated with our fine Cath­olic university." 
On the next play, Livingstone missed another tackle. Leahy turned back to the bench again. "Lads, jonathan Lujack was right about Robert Livingstone." 
Despite the tie, Notre Dame was awarded the national 
championship when the season ended. It was the first of 
three national championships that Notre Dame won be­
tween 1946 and 1949. 

The last eight games against the Cadets -dating back 
to 1965 -have hardly been as exciting or intense as the 
ones in the past. Notre Dame has outscored the Army in 
those games by a 312-16 margin. 
The roles of the two teams from 70 years ago will be switched tomorrow. It would seem that for all Army has done to help make so much of Notre Dame's lore and legend possible, Notre Dame would help make it possible for Army to rebuild their own great tradition. 
Don't bet on it, though.

68 tackles, while teammate Mike Kovaleski follows with 
35 stops. While the linebackers have been rolling up the 
stats, the line has been drawing rave reviews for its play 
the last two weeks. After being condemned earlier in the 
season for a lack ofa pass rush, the front four has been 
harassing opposing quarterbacks in recent games, bring­
ing plaudits from Faust. "Defensively, we are definitely 
getting more pressure from our front line, but we're also 
starting to play well as a unit," comments Faust. 
Overall, Faust will be looking for the Irish to maintain the intensity that has manifested itself in the last two weeks. "The one thing we've done each ofthe last two weeks is dominate and take control of the game," notes the third-year Irish coach. "I would just like to continue that consistency we've shown the last two weeks." 
Ifthe Irish maintain the consistency and intensity Faust speaks of, it should be a delightful afternoon in the Meadowlands. And if the Irish do win "on the road again,'' look for Faust, the Irish, and their fans to change the sad tunes ofearly in the season to much more beautiful music.

plosion in a "glove box" where 
workers handled radioactive 
materials through lead-shielded 
gloves. 
From its opening until l974, 
when Dow Chemical Co. was run­
ning the plant for a succession of 
federal agencies, there were several 
accidents in which workers were 
contaminated with plutonium. 
There also were more than 200 fires, many caused by plutonium's propensity to smolder like charcoal in an oxygen atmosphere. Rockwell officials say the spontaneous fires don't occur now,-due to special precautions. The U.S. Department of Energy now oversees the plant. 
Two ofthe 200 fires were serious 
-one in 1957 that received little 
public attention, and another in 
1969. Dr. CarlJohnson, who has had 
several studies published on Rocky 
Flats's effects on people, said smoke 
from the 1957 fire spewed 
radioactive contamination for ·several miles. 
The 1969 fire received more 
publicity and heightened public 
concern about Rocky Flats. In recent 
years even the physicians in the 
Colorado Medical Society have 
urged that the plant be closed or rel­
ocated and its site decontaminated. An official DOE study found that such a pr.:>ject would take up to 19 years and cost about $1.9 billion. 
Other problems the plant has en­countered included the release of tritium, a radioactive hydrogen isotope, into a reservoir that supplied water to a nearby city; the autopsy reports showing plutonium in lungs, and Johnson's studies showing higher rates of cancer ­especially types of cancer linked with radiation -in persons near the plant than in people far from it.

'Beyond the Limit:' 
beyond repair 
by Stephen Thomas 
J.~atures staff writer 
O
--------------~ n~: must wonder wht·ther the marquee at the Foru n Cinema here in South Bend shoui.J read Richard Gere instl·ad ofBryond The Limit. For most ofBeyona The Limit Is just that: Rkhard Gere. That is, Richard Gere trying to ac ., trying to develop an accent and trying to make something out of this film. 
A potentially good story line is ruined by a cast 111-cquiptJCd to develop it. Limit takes place in Northern Argentina. Gen· plays a doctor whose father Is be lng held as a political prisoner in Uruguay. In Argentina, Gere become! involved with rebels who are planning to 
capture the United Stat·s ,~mbas­sador when he visits In town. He­cause Gere is having an a! fair with a British Consul's wife, he i; able to obtain information concerning the car route ofthe Ambassador. When the kidnapping takes place. however, the Consul is m istakedly captured in place oftht.· Ambas­sador. Because ofGere·s involve­ment with the Consul'~ ""ife, the police suspect him as part ofthe kidnapping group. Their lead even­tually leads to a surprise t·nding, which, ofcourse, I canno: reveal. 
Beyond Tht Limit, at first, is interesting. An interestm!. story line, what appears to be a good cast, and McCartney get the film off to a good 
start. Eventually, though, the film 
starts to slow down. We realize that 
the ~haracters will never develop from a one-dimensional level and the pace becomes more and more annoying. The best one can do at this point is just patiently wait for the film to end. 
Much ofthe film's failure is due to 
character development. Richard 
Gere makes no attempt to become 
anything more than Richard Gere. 
There is no real evidence ofan 
emotoional bond between Gere and 
his father. Gere speaks ofa love and a 
concern, but we feel nothing. Mic­
hael Caine is also a victim offaulty 
character development. The love 
that he expresses for his wife is artifi­
cial. It also is hard to believe that 
Caine feels sympathy and admira­
tion for Gere at the end ofthe film, 
especially, after he finds out Gere 
has had an affitir with his wife. 
The writers of this film are also at fault. There's not much room for characterization within the script, and, at times, the dialogue is non­sensical. For example, Caine tells Gere that his potentially pregnant wife is not on the pill becuse she's one ofthoseSpanish Catholics. I of· ten found myselfaskingwhy some of the dialogue was in the film at all. 
hard to love someone you can't put your arms around. I believe I am the beneficiary ofgraces that come from heaven. It would be embarrassing to say how much I enjoy them. 
Analysis used to be an indoor sport that students played in the dorms on Saturday nights in winter. It has varsity status In pseudo­intellectual sets addicted to watch­ing the Winds ofWar amd the Thornbirds on television. Gloria, at a cookout, says to Ralph: "You've got sensitive hands. Those hands could be at home on a brain surgeon or a violinist." Actually, Ralph's mitts arc large and uncoordinated, like the ones In the drawings ofMickey Mouse. Ralph becomes conscious of his hands as though he were posing for Michelangelo's statue ofDavid. He never doubts the sincerity of the compliment, which was invented 
when Gloria noticed Ralph picking his nose. 
I have a great deal oftrouble being the me that God intended. I'm not sure how I will turn out. Cardinal Cooke died last week in New York; from the courageous way he ac­
cepted suffering and death, he 
became a hero to the world. Ernest Hemingway, who taught us to ad­mire grace under pressure, died of a self-inflicted wound. You can feel sorry for Hemingway, but it took a 
hero to teach us how to die. Nobody can write my press notice, praising my worth, until, like a runner, I have finished the course. Until I have crossed the finish line, I am full of surprises. 
You can write yourselfoff as below or above average. Surveys measure you in relation to the repair. It would have been helpful for the directors and producers to have thought a little more hefore they made this film. The actors could have made some effort toward character development. A little more money in the film's budget could have made the film more presentable. The film gets by on just the necessary amount ofset and the characters don't seem to have more than one costume. Finally, the film's 
writers could have thought ofsome meaningful dialogue. 
Then again, with an ad that boasts Richard Gere, Michal Caine and implies tempting sex scenes, who needs quality? The ad seems to be doing a good job on its own In sell­ing this film. I think that's just what 
the nr.<VInr,.,..., un<;;II'U<OI.J. 
mainstream. National tests warn of the risks your group takes with tooth decay. The total information evaluates you as a statistic. But nobody except God can define potential. Holden Caufield in 
Catcher in the Rye tries to think of somethinggood to say about a kid doesn't like. Finally, he decides, the kid was probably a. terrific whistler. The ordinaryguy strugglesall his life to get outfrom under classifications. Uke no one else he ever heard of, he's got this wonderful talent: he's a terrific whistler. On the day the earth is nuked, he will whistle the Star Spangled Banner, and save the world's morale. On the last night of civilization, he will have this gift of music that saves the survivors from the despair ofcommitting suicide. 
· I used to collect unicorns, when they were rare and hard to find. I could go for a couple ofyears before adding a new beast to the glass menagerie. Suddenly, the unicorn poplulation exploded. Now, uni­corns are everywhere, and I am em­barrassed. I'm looking for a nearly 
extinct species to identify with. Wild geese flying lonely against the sky would be a better symbol of Christ. I've lost respect for the sillly, simpering creatures that roam in herds, suffocating from the Hallmark cuteness that makes one inter­changeable with the other, their 
reticence and shyness gone like a lost innocence. 
The lady who finds me vulnerable praises me for honesty. She says: "I know priests who wouldn't say merde Ifthey had· a mouthful." Amateur analysis lacks the poetry of reassurance. Being one ofa kind is too much magic for the amateurs to deal with. They couldn't leave uni­corns well enough alone. I don'l 'eel complimented when one ofthem tells me the way I am honest.

Upsets make football race interestilig 
By MARY SIEGER 
Sports Writer 
Two major upsets occurred this week in women's interhall football as Lewis defeated Breen-Phillips 14­8 and Pasquerilla West beat Farley 
8-0. 
It was the first time in the history of women's interhall football that Lewis had ever defeated B.P. 
"It was an important win ti>r us be­
cause it helped u~ huild our con­
fidence and we learned it is never 
too late to recover from mistakes," 
said Lewis team captainjaneen Olds. 
Sunday's victory tied Lewis and 
Pasquerilla East each at 3-1 for the 
best records in the league. 
"It shows that no one can 
dominate this league," said Olds. 
B.P. team captain Lisa Ehrhardt said that the contest with Lewis was close and B.P.'s defense did not play as well as it had in past games. She said that although Sunday's loss put the team in a bad position for a play· off spot, she does not expect the team to drop another game this 
season. The game gives B.P. a -~-2 record as it enters its game against 
P.W. 
next week. 

P.W. 
athletic director Mary Jane Lorton said Tuesday's victory over Farley gives the team "more momentum." and will givt: the team a better chance ofentering the play­offs in November. 


Lorton credited the upset to 
defense and an improving offense. 
"We scored early and the defense 
pulled it out for us," she said. 
P.W.'s momentum began with a 
14-0 victory over Lyons on Sunday, 
and Tuesday's game gave P.W. a 2-2 
record. 
Illness has affected the Farley team this week and team captain Sharon Zoehlcr said many team members have missed practice be­
cause they were sick. "The lack of practice weakens the team," she explained. 
Zoehlcr said Farley, 2-2, plans to use more imagination and variety in its plays going into its game with Badin last night. She expected to beat Badin because the last two losses "make us mad and we're hungry for a win." 
In action this week, Lyons won its 
tlrst game of the season against 
Badin. 6-0. Lyons' team captain. 
Martha Burns. attributed the victory 
to the deknsive line and to t~:am 
spirit. 
"We really wanted it basically," 
she explained. 
The 1--l Lyons team will play P.E. 
next week and Burns expects her 
team to give P.E... a good run for the 
money." 
Although the Badin team is disap­pointed with its loss to Lyons, team captain Sally Esposito docs not ex­pect the team to lose any morale. 
"We don't think we're any worse," Esposito commented. 
Esposto attributed the loss to "an offt night" and said the offensive line is improving. The 0-3 squad played Farley last night and Esposito hoped the team would hold its own against the former league champions. 
On Tuesday, P.E. improved its record to 3-1 after defeating Walsh, 6-0. 
"The game gave us confidence," said P.E. captain Kim Zerr, and she is confident her team will be included in the playoffs this season. 
Next week P.E. will be facing its most challenging games of the season. Zerr said the squad will con­tinue to "work on the basics" in preparation for the week. 
Walsh was disappointed with the outcome ofTuesday's game and cap­tain Mary Langer believed "there were a lot of unnecessary personal fouls." She described the contest as "emotional'' and attributed Walsh's loss to penalties.

Associated Press 
PHILADELIPHIA -Dave Johnson 
was named manager of the New 
York Mets yesterday, becoming the 
fourth man in three years to take on 
the job of restoring the perennial 
National League East cellar-dwellers 
to the heights they scaled a decade 
ago. 
The former Gold Glove second baseman foe four major league teams, who guided two Mets' minor league teams to championships in two years in their system, signed a two-year contract at undisclosed terms, said Mets General Manager Frank Cashen. 
"I want to thank Mr. Cashen for 
having the intelligence to hire me. I 
really felt I was qualified to manage 
in the big league three years ago," 
joked Johnson, who played a minor 
role in Mets' history when as a player 
with Baltimore, he made the final 
out in New York's triumph over the 
Orioles in the 1969 World Series. 
"I feel fortunate to come to a city 
that can make a normal human being 
and a less-than-average ballplayer a 
superst.ar"

The courtroom is filled beyond its capacity of 59,07 ;. Many others arc stuck outside see <ing to buy, at any price, a ticket of admis.<;ion. Others arc glued to thdr television sets. All are awaiting whal could go down in history a<; the tria of the century. 
All rise for the honorable I.M. 
Judge. 

The trial to he heard today is that 
of two young ccliege sophomores. 
lbe charge is th.1t of purporting to 
be top-notch football players in key 
positions at the 1 Jniversity of Notre 
Dame. The suspects are tight end 
Mark Bavaro and middle linebacker 
Tony Furjanic. 

The prosecuti 1g attorney begins 
with his opening statement. 

As the 1983 lootball season ap­proaches its mid ><>int game tomor­row, it provide~. a good time to assess the progre:;s ofplayers. 
At the start of this season there were definite qut stion marks at the Notre Dame tight end and middle linebacker positi<ns. Two relatively inexperienced players were slated to take over posi rions which in the la<;t ten years havt produced some of the more promin·~nt names in Notre Dame football hi~ tory. 
Fans recall. the names of Dave Casper, Ken Mac.\fee, Dean Maztek, and Tony Humer as the outstanding tight ends of the Ia~t decade. 
Likl·wise, the 11ames of Greg Col­lins, Marv Ru!osell, Bob Golic, Bob Crable, and Mar~ Zavagnin come to mind a<; the great middle: linebackers ofthe la~t dccadt. 
A look at the history books reveals that seven of the nine aforemen­tioned player.. v'ere all-Americans. The exceptions being Dean Maztek, who suffered a knee injury in his senior year, and Marv Russell, who had knee surgeri after starting his 
sophomore year. 

These two players here today 
arrive on the scene with relatively 
little experience and expect to fill 
the shoes vacated by the past all­
Americans. 

The defense attorney begins his 
opening statement. 

Although these players here today 
began the season with little' ex­
perience, they possessed the tools, 
such as speed, strength, skill, and 
desire, needed to achieve success. 
Bavaro, 6-4, 246-pounds, is offto a 
good start this season. In five games 
he has caught eight passes for 100 
yards and two touchdowns. While in 
high school he was a unanimous 
prep all-America choice on Parade, 
Adidas/Scholastic Coach and Coach 
& Athlete/National High School Ath­
letic Coaches Association teams. 
Furjanic, 6-2, 231-pounds, is also making a name for himself. After five games he leads the team with 68 to­tal tackles, I 9 of them solo. In addi­tion he has two interceptions, broken up two passes, caused two fumbles, and has two quarterback sacks. 
The interrogation begins with Bavaro on the stand. 
Bavaro notes, "At the beginning of the season I did not think too much about filling the shoes of past players. Rather I just went out and did what I was supposed to do." 
The position of tight end at Notre Dame is of great importance. Being in an important position means coping with the pressures that ac­company it. Bavaro's case is no ex­ception. 
"I felt pressure from the coaches because they expected me to play well and I wasn't sure how well I could play," says Bavaro. 
Bavaro adds, "I also had pressure from myself because I had worked hard and did not want to see it go down the drain in one game."

ND tennis team hosts conference tournament as favorite to win NSC 
ByJANE HEALEY 
Assistant Sports Editor 

The Notre Dame women's tennis team will be hosting the first annual North Star Conference champion­ship tournament this weekend at the ACC. Play begins today and con­tinues tomorrow morning at 8 am. on the Courtney Courts. If there is rain, the tournament will move inside the ACC. 
According to Coach Sharon Petro, the Irish are not only the hosts ofthe championships, but the favorites, too. 
"I would expect or I would guess that we would be seeded going into the tournament," Petro said. 
Petro's assumption is based on previous competition this season. :rhc Irish demolished NSC members Butler and DePaul 9-0. 
The other members of the con­fercnce who the Irish have yet to face are Dayton, Detroit, Evansville, 
Loyola, and Xavier.

idea," she said. "You're out there on your own. It won't show who is the better team, just the better in­dividual players." 
Petro isn't putting a lot of em­phasis on the weekend, seeing that it is only the end ofthe fall season, and the Irish have an entire spring season to play -not to mention the NCAA tournament at the end of the 
year. . . 
. But, she_ can still find_ s?~e ments

It will provtd~ us .~tth m(~re tournament expencnce, Petro sat~. "Since we are expected to do well, tt will put additional pressure on us. W c need all the pressure we can get 
righht now." 
Coach and players alike arc really looking forward to something other than a conference title, though.

Hank Hofman has described the .. fas d . , 
team as a t, goo -runmng team, and the players have demonstrated that ability by running circles around several opponents. With almost two-thirds of the season completed, Notre Dame has shutout II teams en route to an im­pressive overall record of I 1-3. One might get the idea that it's pretty easy being an Irish soccer player right now. Wrong. Last Tuesday evening, the soccer team had a conditioning practice. They ran a lot -and they ran hard. This sort ofeffort, seen at this late time in the season, is indicative of the kind ofattitude that is prevalent on the team. Despite a disappointing 
"Our sights are set way beyond this (to the NCAA's)," LaFratta said. "It (the NSC tournamant) means something to us. We want to put the team on top of the conference in its first year, but we're looking ahead." 
Though the visions into the future are obvious, LaFratta docs not fed that the Irish are being overconfi­dent or cocky. 
. "This team gets motivated even 
' when we're playing teams we know
Iwe arc going to beat," she said. That fact can bt· verified by the spotless 9-0 record the Irish posted in dual competition this fall. 
After the NSC tournamem, the team ha~ several months off to catch up on school work and conditioning before the rigors of the spring season begin. 

arq ue e 

double-overtime loss last weekend 
to Wisconson-Milwaukee, the 
players are looking forward to this 
weekend's games with a positive 
outlook. 

The Irish will take on a very tough 
Marquette squad tonight at 8 p.m. on 
Cartier Field. Sunday, Notre Dame 
will host Chicago on Alumni Field at 
2p.m. 

Last year, the Irish shutout 
Chicago, 2-0, and grabbed a 2-1 
overtime victory at Marquette. 

The Notre Dame players had a 
chance to watch Marquette down 
Minnesota, 2-0, la<;t week. In that 
game, they were able to see that 
Marquette's defense is not as strong 
as it was last year, but that their mid­
field is very good. 

Everyone expects that tonight's game will be as close as those in past years against Marquette. 
According to one of the Irish cap­tains, fullback Mark Luetkehans, "Marquette is always an exciting game for the fans. We always seem to have close games against them."
