Brown, Braun elected new student leaders 
Senate decides run-off tie in closed meeting by 15-13 vote 
BySONIARAO News Writer 
After a drawn-out election process, a decision on who will be next year's stu­dent body president and vice president was reached Sunday. 
Student body presidential candidate Liz Brown and vice presidential candidate Maris Braun defeated Danny Smith and Ashley Weiss by a 15-13 vote Sunday night in a closed Student Senate meeting. Brown and Braun will assume their positions April 1. 
Because neither Brown and Braun nor contenders Smith and Weiss received the 50 percent plus one of the student vote required to seal the election in the run-off, the Student Union Constitution required the decision to be made in a closed meet-

Confusion over Constitution causes problems for senators 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Assistant News Editor 
Senators had to deal with more than just elec­tion drama during Sunday night's closed meet­ing, after it came to light that they had been working from a copy of the Student Union Constitution with incorrect instructions for the tie-breaking procedure. 
Prior to the conclusion of voting in Thursday's run-off election for student body president, Student Activities Office Director Brian Coughlin discovered that the copy of the Student Union Constitution given to senators at the beginning of their terms contained the wrong description of voting protocol for a closed meeting of the Senate, student body vice president Bill Andrichik said.

Female officials: Power at ND wielded not only by men 
University's top women say bylaw restricting presidency to priest does not hinder their advancement 
By AMANDA MICHAELS Assistant News Editor 
Media coverage surrounding the Feb. 11 election of Drew Gilpin Faust to the top spot at Harvard University focused on one fact and one fact only ­that Drew Gilpin Faust is a woman. 
Faust became the first female president in Harvard's 371-year history last Sunday, bringing the total number of Ivy League schools with women at the helm to four, including the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University and Brown University. A 2006 survey by the American Council on Education found that 23 percent of college presidents were women, up from 9.5 percent in 1986. 
Notre Dame, however, will never join this trend. University bylaws state the president must always be a priest and a mem­ber of the Indiana Province of the Congregation of Holy Cross. 
Yet several of the highest ranking women at Notre Dame said this rule doesn't bother them, and does not restrict power so much as it encourages the University's mission of pro­viding a faith-based campus environment. In short, it insures that the University stays its course as a Catholic institu­tion, they said. 
"[The bylaw] absolutely does have an effect -but the effect to me is not on how leadership can therefore be expressed by women," said Carolyn Woo, dean of the Mendoza College of Business. "I think it's why we're able to maintain the whole Catholic mission and identity. If we didn't have [a priest as a University president] it would be very difficult to carry that DNA." 
Woo said to view Notre Dame's situation only as one in which a woman can never be head of the University limits the

English duckling born with four legs 
LONDON -Webbed feet run in Stumpy's family, but he's the first to have four of them. 
A rare mutation has left the eight-day-old duckling with two nearly full-sized legs behind the two he runs on. Nicky Janaway, a duck farmer in New Forest, Hampshire, 95 miles southwest or London, showed the duck­ling to reporters Saturday. 
"It was absolutely bizarre. I was thinking 'he's got too many legs' and I kept counting 'one, two, three, four,"' Janaway said. 
Stumpy would probably 
not survive in the wild, but Janaway, who runs the Warrawee Duck Farm in New Forest, says he is doing well. 
"He's eating and surviv­ing so far, and he is run­ning about with those extra legs acting like sta­bilizers," Janaway said.

Students, parents enjoy JPW 
By ROHAN ANAND News Writer 
Families gathered on campus this weekend for the 56th annual Junior Parents Weekend -an event consid­ered by many an important part of Notre Dame tradition. 
The weekend kicked off with an opening gala on Friday evening, where juniors and their families enjoyed a cash bar, hors d'oeuvres, portrait photography and dancing. 
Junior class president Bridget Higgins' parents drove the six-hour trip from Pittsburgh Friday morning, and she said was delighted they could be there so she could introduce them to her friends. 
"At the gala, wandering around and meeting people, you get more of a view of a person's life and their back­grounds, because sometimes you only see them in the con­text of school," Higgins said. 
In addition to an evening of socializing, visiting parents were also given a glimpse of the University's academic and spiritual aspects of the University during Saturday's program. 
From 10 a.m. to noon, par­ents and students had the opportunity to attend work­shops and lectures at the University's four colleges. 
Joe Real showed his parents the newly constructed Jordan Hall of Science, in addition to the resources available for pre­professional students like him. 
"At the reception and the workshops that followed, we learned a lot about the future in medicine," said the Philadelphia resident. "We also learned important things about entrance into medical school, relieving my parents about some of our concerns about the process." 
Immediately following were luncheons in the individual res­
idence halls, concerts per­formed by stu­dent ensembles and receptions for honors groups. 
A highlight of Saturday evening was the 
5:30 Mass held in the Joyce Center. 
University President Father John Jenkins 
1986-1996, in

"With all ofour 
addition to 

families and friends C h a n d r a together, we really had Johnson, asso­
the chance to reflect on the blessings that we have as members ofthe Notre Dame community. " 
Bridget Keating junior class president 
presided, and Zahm Hall rector Father Daniel Parrish delivered the homily. 
Keating said the Mass served as a great opportunity for per­sonal reflection. 
"With all of our families and friends together, we really had the chance to reflect on the blessings that we have as members of the Notre Dame community," said Keating, who also writes news for The Observer. 
Keating also addressed the class during the President's 

Dinner at the Joyce Center Fieldhouse after Mass. 
She said it was "incredible that nearly 3,500 parents from coast to coast had traveled in this horrible weather for this year's JPW," in comparison to the 120 in attendance during the inaugural event in 1952. 
The weekend concluded Sunday morning with a closing brunch featuring guest speaker Lou 1-Ioltz, head Irish football 
coach from 


ciate director of Campus Ministry and Kerry Carroll, JPW chairper­son. 
University President Em­eritus Father Theodore Hesburgh gave the benediction. 

Nancy McEvily said the clos­ing speakers made her realize how important JPW was in making her Notre Dame expe­rience truly unique. 
"During your junior year, you have a really solid group of friends and you know who's important to you," she said. "And this event allows your parents to meet those people who are really important to you."

Details of Student Union Board's budget up for debate 
By JOHN-PAUL WITT 
News Writer 
The Student Union Board (SUB), responsible for bringing events like last semester's Ben Folds concert to Notre Dame, has been mired lately in Student Senate debates about control over its budget. 
Two potential resolutions dealing with limitations on who can spend SUB's money and how much those people can spend have seen discussion on the Senate floor. 
The first resolution proposes that the amount SUB can spend without authorization from the Financial Management Board (FMB) -the group that over­sees SUB's budget -be raised from the current $5,000. 
The other proposes that money allotted to the Office of the President but kept in a SUB account be given entirely to student government, said stu­dent body vice president Bill Andrichik. 
"The most likely [outcome]

question to formal power. 
"I don't believe that leader­ship is just a formal title. In terms of formal power, no, women will not have as much power at Notre Dame. But I also don't believe that formal hierar­chy is the only source of power," she said. "Power comes from credibility, respect that a person generates, the informal type of power -which isn't less powerful by any means." 
And while the University does have hierarchy that formally favors men, it does not bar women from having as much influence as men, Woo said. 
"Does it prevent women from the exercise of leadership just because there's a man as presi­dent? No. Not at all, in fact," she said. 
For Christine Maziar, vice president of the University and associate provost, academic administration is about service rather than power in the strictest sense. 
"I think a place like Notre Dame, where by the bylaws, our president must be a member of the Indiana province of the Congregation of the Holy Cross, guarantees that the person asked to play that role is a per­son who feels very deeply about service," Maziar said. "That really should be a guarantee at every university." 
At the head of the class 
Differences in the University's will be a compromise -stu­dent groups will have to seek approval for requests of $5,000 or a certain percentage of their budget, whichever is higher," Andrichik said. 

SUB had an initial budget of $217,000 for the 2006-07 school year, said SUB manager Patrick Vassel. 
After winter break, SUB received $21,000 -its share of The Shirt proceeds, which are allocated to student groups. 
SUB divides its budget between its 11 programming committees, an administrative account and an advertising account. 
Concerts are by far SUB's largest cost, though the "Issues and Ideas" fund for bringing speakers to campus is also sub­stantial, Vassel said. The Notre Dame Literary Festival, Jazz Festival and Special Events committees are also large expenses. 
Revenue from ticket sales at events is looped back into the fund to pay for programming later in the year, Vassel said. 
"Anything left in the budget at the end of the year doesn't turn over Ito usl, so we're aim­ing for zero [left in the budg­et[," Vassel said. 
The $5,000 limit is central to the current debate in the S1mate. Vassel has argued that since SUB's budget is much larger than other student groups, an exception to the authorization restriction should be made so that SUB can secure bigger-name artists. 
If a week passes before FMB can approve an oiTer over $5,000, the delay can break a deal, he said. 
"What we do is time sensi­tive. Often, artists have only a few dates open, and by the time our offer is approved, the artist is booked," Vassel said. 
SUB treasurer Steve Friend said on several occasions, top artists could not be contracted because of the delay in the approval process. The new pro­posal will raise SUB's spending limit, provided that SUB gives regular updates to the FMB. 
"As long as SUB is willing to keep the FMB informed of its exp1mditures, I am not opposed to the proposal to amend the spending limit," Friend said. "The student body will benefit from superior performers." 
Vassel and Friend said they support the $5,000 limit for groups with smaller budgets, but argue that SUB's size puts it in a difl'erent league. 
"What [SUB] does is more significant than any other stu­dent group, and the [Student Union] constitution should reflect this," Vassel said. 
The other issue before the Student Senate relates to the funding of the Presidential Division, tasked with imple­menting programs directly from the Office of the President. 
The funding is currently in an account controlled by SUB, which is compelled to provide funding from the account to student government when requested. 
The resolution would remove the involvement of the SUB and place the account under the control of student government, something that Andrichik said he favors because the current text "creates an extra barrier for student government to withdraw its already-approved money." 
The next step in the process of changing the Constitution is the submission of draft resolu­tions for debate in the Senate by Oversight committee chair Chris Hollon. 
"The versions [of the resolu­tions] my committee has endorsed [read]: an organiza­tion would be able to spend $5,000 or five percent of their budget, whichever is more, without FMB approval," Hollon said. "This would reduce the amount of times SUB would have to seek FMB approval to a more reasonable level, while still maintaining strong student oversight over funds." 
The resolution will likely be introduced in the Senate on Feb. 28, Hollon said.

At the Lama Temple and White Cloud Temple in Beijing, faithful burned incense and tossed coins at incense burners, believing that if they landed in the pot they would have better luck in the New Year.

U.S. helicopter crash kills eight 
SHAHJOI, Afghanistan-A U.S. helicopter suffered a "sudden, unexplained loss of power" and crashed Sunday in southeastern Afghanistan, killing eight American troops, the military said. Fourteen people on board survived. 
A NATO spokesman denied the helicopter had been shot down, saying the pilot had radioed ahead to report engine problems. It was the deadliest U.S. crash in Afghanistan since last May. 
The CH-47 Chinook helicopter was carry­ing 22 U.S. service members under overcast skies when there was a "sudden, unex­plained loss of power and control and crashed," U.S. military spokesman Lt. Col. David Accetta said. The 14 survivors suf­fered injuries. 
The helicopter crashed in the Shahjoi dis­trict of Zabul province, about 50 yards from the main highway between Kabul and Kandahar, and appeared to be destroyed and scattered in several pieces.

N.J. civil unions law takes effect 
HADDONFIELD, N.J.-Diane Marini used to joke that she was always the bridesmaid and never the bride because, as a lesbian, she thought it was unlikely New Jersey would ever approve same-sex marriage. 
Still, she and longtime partner Marilyn Maneely campaigned for gay marriage. They were among seven couples who sued the state in 2002 demanding the right to marry. While their suit didn't lead to a gay marriage law, it has led to New Jersey becoming the third state to offer civil unions to same-sex couples. 
The civil unions law takes effect Monday and some same-sex couples are planning ceremonies. For couples who are not already in civil unions from other states, however, there is a 72-hour waiting period after applying for a license -just like with mar­riages. A few town halls around the state planned to open at 12:01 a.m. Monday so couples could filed their applications.

Peace bid begins amid doubts 
Rice encounters stalemate between governments over Palestinian militants 
Associated Press JERUSALEM -Hoping to turn the page on six years of stalled Mideast negotiations, the U.S. instead found itself boxed in Sunday by a char­acteristically complex politi­cal impasse involving ally Israel and the Palestinians. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice came to the region intending to lead a symbolic peace summit. Her plans, however, have been eclipsed amid uncer­tainty and disagreement over how to handle last week's sudden announce­ment of a power-sharing deal to end internal Palestinian fighting. Rice met for two hours with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, resolute in his position that he must govern hand-in-hand with Hamas militants who refuse to moderate anti-Israeli policies.

day we had four responses," Van Mill said. 
Weisbecker said she experi­enced a similar response last year. 
"I was really amazed and impressed with how much peo­ple were ready to come in and share their personal experi­ences with me," she said. "They were very open and there was definitely no short­age of volunteers." 
Van Mill was not involved in last fall's production of "Loyal Daughters," but went to sever­al rehearsals and all three shows to aid in her research of rape on campus. She decided to take up the task for next year since Weisbecker will graduate in May. 
Van Mill changed the name of the project to "Loyal Daughters and Sons," since last year many men eager to tell their stories responded to Weisbecker's interview requests. 
"Sexual assault isn't just one gender's issue," Van Mill said. "[The play] still focuses on the women's experience, but men are a part of that experience." 
Sitting through the inter­views can be a difficult experi­ence, Van Mill said. Weisbecker advised her to never schedule more than two in a day to avoid an emotional overload. 
To learn how to best conduct the interviews, Weisbecker received training from the S-0­S rape crisis center in South Bend. 
Weisbecker said she starts the interviews casually to establish a connection with the interviewee and then she lets them guide where the inter­view goes. 
"I ask questions for clarifica­tion, but I don't push people beyond where they arc com­fortable going," she said. "It's about trying to help people, not repeat the experience." 

Many people who respond to her e-mails are not survivors of sexual assault, but just want to talk about their own feelings on sexuality and sexual assault, Van Mill said. for many interviewees, telling their story is part of their heal­ing process, Weisbecker said. 
"It's really hard emotionally, but it's also really exciting that people are willing to trust you with their stories," Van Mill said. 
Van Mill has recorded the interviews, and over the sum­mer she will write the play based on her transcriptions. Van Mill said she applied for research permission last week and will also apply for a UHOP grant to subsidize her time spent writing and interviewing. 
To reserve a place for the play to be performed next year, Van Mill needs to get either club or departmental sponsor­ship, Weisbecker said. Last year, the Gender Studies department sponsored the pro­duction. Weisbecker would not comment. on which depart­ments may sponsor the event next fall, but said three have expressed interest. 
While her close involvement in the project is drawing to an end, "Loyal Daughters" is a production Weisbecker said she thinks should continue to be produced at Notre Dame. 
"I think the fact that we sold out every night is an indicator that this is something that peo­ple want around and they want to see it because it is a difficult thing to talk about and even though it's not pleasant, it's good to know that it happens," she said.

goal, said producer Becki Faunce, was to alter the audience's views of women and the world. 
The production's 17 mono­logues, written by members of the College community and performed by student actresses, touched on issues ranging from Notre Dame's academic freedom debate to middle school sex education class -topics Saint Mary's senior Dana Christiano said increased campus con­sciousness. 
"[SMC Monologues! raised issues that are not talked about openly on campus," she said. "1 think !the pro­duction] allows for more freedom to express and not to be afraid of certain issues on campus." 
While junior actress Giuliangela Hosato said she enjoyed "hearing the audi­ence laugh so much," the lightheartedness of some monologues left senior Erin Bergman questioning the skit's message. 
"I thought that some of the skits were relatable," she said, "but other times they tried too hard to be too humorous. The message was kind of lost." 
The SMC Monologues' message was clear, however, for faculty advisor Catherine Pittman, who called the pro­duction an "emotional rollercoaster" -an experi­ence that "gives the audi­ence a sense of the strength of the intimate personal and emotional experiences that are associated with one's sexuality." 
While Pittman said she did not anticipate that people would agree with every

Pittman said it was the vocalization of silenced cam­pus voices that impressed upon her how diverse the Saint Mary's community really is. 
"When we call for mono­logues," she said, "we seem to get the most responses from survivors of sexual assault, women asking ques­tions about their sexuality, women questioning the views of sexuality that they have been taught and women celebrating their sexuality, whether it be het­erosexual, bisexual or les­bian." 
In the future, Pittman said she would like to find a way to reach out to alumnae dur­ing the monologue submis­sion process.

Housing industry in major slowdown 
WASHINGTON -Housing construction plunged to the lowest level in nearly a decade last month as the housing industry continued to struggle with a severe slow­down. 
Meanwhile, wholesale prices fell 0.6 per­cent in January, the biggest drop in three months, providing fresh evidence that inflation pressures are easing. 
Construction of new homes and apart­ments plunged by 14.3 percent in January, pushing total activity down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.408 million units, the Commerce Department reported Friday. 
The decline pushed activity to the slowest pace since August 1997, with construction in January 37.8 percent below the pace of a year ago. The steep decline last month followed two months of construction increases that had raised hopes that per­haps the worst of the housing slump was over. 
The weather was blamed for part of the setback. November and December had been unusually mild while more normal winter weather returned to much of the 
country in January, depressing building activity. 
However, economists said the depth of the decline showed that housing was still facing major problems after a five-year boom that ended last year. 
House passes business tax breaks 
WASHINGTON -The House overwhelm­ingly approved business tax breaks worth $1.8 billion over 10 years, a key step toward forging a congressional compro­mise on increasing the minimum wage. 
Friday's vote on the tax cuts was 360-45. 
Passage of a wage hike for the lowest­paid workers now depends on how quickly the House and Senate work out differences between their tax packages. The Senate tax breaks -worth $8.3 billion -are more than four times bigger than the ones passed in the !louse. 
Under the House bill, small businesses would see an extension in some tax write­offs that are scheduled to expire and would be able to continue to claim a tax credit for hiring disadvantaged workers. 
Fox News competes with CNBC 
Murdoch says new business channel will be more accessible than competitors 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -News Corp. chief Rupert Murdoch says the new Fox Business Channel will be "more busi­ness-friendly" than rival CNBC, making that point on the day he announced his network would launch at the end of the year. 
It was the first hint that a classic political tactic used in launching Fox News Channel a decade ago -defining the opposition -was back in play. 
Within a day of Murdoch's statement on Feb. 8, Fox News business anchor Neil Cavuto told MarketWatch that "we're going to be a channel for America -not for old white men with money." 
Roger Ailes, chairman and chief executive for Fox News, told The New York Times that he'd often seen things on CNBC where they aren't as friendly to corporations and profits as they should be. 
"We don't get up every morning thinking business is bad," Ailes said. 
Substitute "America" for "business" in that quote and you'd swear it was 1996 again, and Ailes was needling CNN. 
The tactic worked for Fox News Channel. Worked bril­liantly. Many people doubted the network was even neces­sary yet it charged past the industry pioneer within six years and hasn't been caught since. Now many are questioning whether Fox Business Channel can com­pete against CNBC. 
CNBC will be defined by what it delivers on the air every day, and not by Fox, said Jeff Zucker, chairman and CEO of NBC Universal, CNBC's parent company. 
"When you don't have a product, it's easy to throw darts," Zucker told The Associated Press. "We're not concerned at all." 
Rick Kaplan, who ran CNN from 1996 to 2000, wasn't much concerned back then, either. Why worry about snide references to the Clinton News Network or a Fox slogan like "fair and bal­anced," with the inference that CNN wasn't? Fox's rat­ings were so negligible it did­n't matter. 

"I thought that people were not going to buy the argument," Kaplan said. 
CNN didn't bother responding. 
Yet Fox caught on with an audience that believed the slogans. Partly it was because there was a ring of truth, Kaplan said. Not that CNN was partisan, but main­stream news organizations may not have been sensitive enough to other points of view, he said. President Clinton's impeachment trou­bles galvanized what became Fox's audience, he said. 
What should CNN have done? ''I'm not sure," he said. 
"Maybe fight back harder and not just show disdain for Fox News Channel and the noise that was coming out of Fox and their advertising campaigns." 
CNN counterpunches now, as it did recently when Fox referred to Anderson Cooper as the Paris Hilton of TV news. 
CNBC hasn't sat back. Spokesman Kevin Goldman answered the criticism com­ing from Fox Business Channel: "It doesn't surprise me that our alleged competi­tion is already starting with its usual lies and propagan­da." 
Like a boxer training before a fight, CNBC has also made several changes in the two years since Mark Hoffman became president. 

It has added a business newsmagazine, retooled "Squawk Box" and added the popular "Fast Money." 
What worked in politics is not likely to work in busi­ness, said Porter Bibb, of Wall Street's Mediatech Partners and author of a biography on CNN founder Ted Turner released the year after Fox News Channel started. 
Bibb believes CNBC's advantage will be too much for Fox to overcome. CNBC, which started in 1989, is in more than 90 million of the nation's 110 million homes; Fox will start this fall in 30 million homes. There's usu­ally room for only one TV on the desks of business lead­ers, and it will stay tuned to CNBC, he said. 
JetBlue cancels more flights, 'resets' 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -JetBlue called off almost a quarter of its flights for Monday but hoped that would be the last round of cancellations as it strug­gles to recover from the snowstorm that saw some travelers sitting on grounded planes for hours. 
The news sent passengers scram­bling to deal with the disruption to their plans. 
The airline had scheduled 600 flights for President's Day, more than the 550 to 575 flights it has on a normal Monday, but 139 of them were can­celed, JetBlue announced late Saturday. 
The latest cancellations were needed to make sure all flight crews had got­ten the legally mandated amount of rest before returning to service, JetBlue Airways Corp. spokesman Sebastian White said Sunday. 

"Canceling one more day's opera­tions will really help reset our airline," White said Sunday. 
All JetBlue flights were canceled in and out of 11 airports: Richmond, Va.; Pittsburgh; Charlotte and Raleigh/Durham, N.C.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Austin and Houston, Texas; Columbus, Ohio; Nashville; Portland, Maine; and Bermuda. 
The cancellations followed hundreds of other canceled and delayed flights since Wednesday, when the snow and ice storm that had plowed across the Midwest struck the Northeast, ground­ing the company's airliners at John F. Kennedy International Airport. 
Maria Arbelo and two companions had been ticketed for a JetBlue flight to Houston on Saturday morning to get on a cruise. That flight was canceled, as were all flights to Houston on Sunday. The airline put the three women up in a hotel for the night, and had them on a Sunday evening flight to Cancun. From there, they would have to find a driver to take them on a four-hour trip to meet their ship. 
"Oh my God, horrendous," Arbelo, a teacher from New Haven, Conn., said of her experience. "It's been a terrible ordeal, I tell you. We've been from line to line."

ing of the Student Senate, said Judicial Council presi­dent Liz Kozlow. 
"Each senator is mandated by the Constitution to follow the plurality of their dorm, which means they must vote according to the majority vote in their dorm," Kozlow said. Only in the event of a tie within a dorm will a senator be able to vote freely, she said. 
Each senator received an envelope with the voting breakdown of his or her dorm directly before the Senate meeting vote took place. Four senators were not present for the formal vote, but none of the four had ties within their dorms and therefore their absence did not affect the outcome, Kozlow said. 
McGlinn and O'Neill were the only two dorms with a tied vote, and both senators voted for Smith and Weiss. 
Even those swing votes, however, were not enough for Smith and Weiss to pull away with the presidency. 
"It happens," Smith said fol­lowing the decision. ''I'm just going to take a step back, start focusing a little bit on school again and see what comes my way." 
Brown said she felt "a little bit shocked and over­whelmed" after the results were announced. 
"It was a long meeting and it's been a long process," she said. 
Resorting to a Student Senate meeting to determine a president is "not something that people are hoping for," Kozlow said. 
"[The meeting] was a tense and difficult environment," she said. "It's not ideal. We 

would have all liked it to end after the run-off vote." 
A contributing factor to that "tense" environment is the fact that senators may strong­ly support one candidate but be required to vote a different way. 
"[Senators] must follow their constituents," Kozlow said. "No one wanted it to end like this [a Senate vote[. We dido 't feel great." 
Brown said there was a concerted effort to make sure correct protocol was followed. 
"I think everyone wanted to make sure that the procedure for voting was correct and accurate so that it was done as professionally and accu­rately as possible," she said. "There wasn't a lot of antago­nism. I just think that every­one was just in a little bit of high stress and wanting to make sure it was done right." 
Though this process is unpleasant, it is also rare. 
"The only time I know of Lan election being determined by Student Senate] is three years ago," Kozlow said. "That's the only time I can think of. It's a huge deal." 
Kozlow was referring to the 2004 election, when tho Senate elected Adam Istvan and Karla Bell in a 15-13 vote over opposing ticket Charlie Ebersol and James Leito. 
Now that the election process is finally over, Brown and Braun will be able to take a breather before assuming their roles as leaders of the student body. 
Brown, speaking for an absent Braun, said they hope to "hit the ground running on our initiatives," and that both she and Braun are "definitely excited" about the decision. 
"I think we're all just happy it's over," she said.

Fallen cli111bers on Mt. Hood all found alive 
Associated Press 
GOVERNMENT CAMP, Ore.­Rescuers located three climbers who fell from a ledge on snowy Mount Hood on Sunday, but res­cue efforts were being ham­pered by blinding snow and wind, officials said. 
Rescuers were trying to rap­pel 150 feet to reach the climbers, but were caught in whiteout conditions. Officials were in sporadic cell phone contact with the three, and believed they were in decent condition. 
All three -a man and two women -were able to walk, and rescuers suggested they cautiously try to work their way down the mountain as rescue teams worked their way up toward them, said Sgt. Sean Collinson, a spokesman for the Clackamas County Sheriff's office. 
At least one of the three had a mountain locator unit, which emits signals used to find miss­ing or stranded climbers. Rescuers were using the signals to keep track of the trio's posi­tion on the mountain. 
"They're very cold," said Russell Gubele, who was coor­dinating communications for the rescue operation. "It's snowing heavy. Conditions are awful." 

Collinson said the two women appeared to have suffered some bumps and bruises and their male companion is in good con­dition. lie said all three "were in fairly good spirits when we talked to them on the phone." 
The drama on Oregon's high­est mountain began shortly before noon, when someone in the eight-person climbing party called emergency dispatchers to say three of the climbers had fallen off a cliff. 
The climbing mishap occurred at about the 8,300­foot level on the mountain. which is about 60 miles east of Portland. 
Battling snow and winds that exceeded 70 mph, a team of rescue mountaineers serambled up the mountain to search. The other members of the party were told to dig a snow cave and wait for help. 
Authorities said the climbers' electronic locator device helped rescuers lind them. One of the devices was aetivated after the fall, authorities said. 
The three climbers who fell were found near the five others, authorities said. The live were taken down to Timberline Lodge, a ski resort at the 6,000­foot level of Mount Hood, and all are reported in good condi­tion, the sheriff's office said in an e-mail.

Senate 
continued from page 1 
reeeived 50 perennt plus one vote in the student body run-oil' elec­tion, the Constitution dietated that the winner be decided by a majority vote in a dosed meeting of the Senate. Andrichik, who as vice president is also the Student Senate chair, called an emer­gency meeting of the Senate for Sunday night at 6 p.m. 
In an e-mail sent Thursday, which The Observer obtained, Andrichik included the text of the Constitution that applied to the voting protocol in the elosed meeting. Article VII, Section VI, Part 1c of the Constitution read: 
"Senators must east their votes for the eandidate eapturing the plurality of his eonstitueney's votes. Each senator shall be informed of the vote in his or her constituency by the Judicial Council President immediately preceding the meeting." 
But the copy of' the Constitution given to senators at the begin­ning of their terms last spring read di!Terently and did not say senators were compdled to cast their vote in aceordance with the plurality in their residence hall. 
The section of the Constitution that senators have had since the beginning of their terms roads: 
"Prior to the meeting, the Judicial Couneil prnsid1mt shall present each senator with the voting breakdown from the Senator's respective dorm. In light of this information, each Senator may east his vote freely." 
Coughlin diseovered this dis­crepancy Thursday and called a meeting of various members of student government inducting Andrichik, student body presi­dent Lizzi Shappell, Judieial Couneil president Liz Kozlow, Senate Oversight ehair Chris IIollon and parliamentarian Matt Barlow to deeide whieh version to follow, Andriehik said.

But one senator, who wished to remain anonymous to avoid con­flict with fellow senators, dis­<Lf:,'l'ned with the decision to sub­stitute a section of the Constitution without consulting the senators. 
"To give a version of the Constitution and then to say, well, actually, that's not true -we have a difl'orent set of rules we are going to go by -it sets a dangerous precedent." 
At the dosed meeting, many senators expressed confusion over the changns and over being Jell out of the decision to insert a difli.lrent dause regarding dosed meetings into the Constitution, the senator said.

Some senators were also unhappy to be at a meeting where their vote was predeter­mined. 
"Another main concern was that since we have to vote with our dorm no matter what. ... A lot of people were ticked ofl' that they were forced to go to a meet­ing in which they had no control over their vote," he said. 
Brown-Braun won the majority with a 15-13 vote and will be stu­dent body president and vice president starting April 1.

I would like to thank and congratu­late all of the academic departments that truly understand the importance and meaning of academic freedom, and in particular, those that chose to not sponsor "The Vagina Monologues" this year. 
An Observer editorial published this past Friday ("After debate, inaction can't continue," Feb. 16) lamented the decisions of these departments in regards to the "Monologues." The editorial expressed a sense of confu­sion as to why "departments wouldn't fully exercise the right they fought so hard to protect." This confusion, I believe, stems from a misunderstand­ing of both the nature of freedom and of academic departments. The mean­ing of freedom is not the obligation of people to slander and disrespect each other, or bombard their community with "controversy" that makes excit­ing headlines. The meaning of free­dom is far deeper and more beautiful than that. 
Freedom, which is grounded in rea­son, contains its meaning only when used in the pursuit of truth; and it is only within truth that we become truly free. Universities and academic departments within them are founded so that this quest may be pursued. Here at Notre Dame, we understand that the truth we pursue in freedom is God, whom we come to know through both faith and reason. Because of the knowledge which has been given to us by revelation, we fol­low the teaching of the Catholie Church and pay due respect to its sacred teaching and tradition. Therefore, the editorial's statement "It doesn't matter what people think of the 'Monologues,' or 'Qlassics,' or any other student-run event that

presents ideas in opposition to Church teaching. It just matters that they think about them,'' is false. 
The University is a place of forma­tion where young men and women come seeking the assistance of learned professors in order to pursue tho truth in each of their aeademic fields, from engineering to English. The issues should not be simply "thought about" as one thinks of grabbing some fro-yo on the way out of the dining hall, but rather that one carefully eonsiders them in light of what we know so that the truth may be better grasped. Thus, academic excellence and freedom enter into the University. Eaeh department must focus itself within its own discipline and understand that it is there that true freedom lies and not in the wan­ton spending of funds and time on events ill-suited to their mission of pursuing the highest and ultimate truth. 
It is true that discussion of issues makes Notre Dame a vibrant place. Tho editorial eorrectly noted "As he issued his dosing statement last spring, Jenkins commended students and faculty members for engaging in thoughtful, concerned debate." But then it added, "Unfortunately, that debate now seems to be lost." That, however, is far from the truth. There are daily opportunities to eontinue that dialogue. Groups formerly opposed to each other, such as Feminist Voice, Hight to Life, the Identity Project of Notre Dame and Sustained Dialogue have come together on a number of occasions to continue fruitful debate and also to reach out of themselves to make a positive impact on the broader com­munity.

QUOTE OF THE DAY 

'The way to get things done is not to mind who gets the credit for doing them." 
Benjamin Jowett English scholar and theologian 

I would like to invite anyone inter­ested in discussing these topics to contact one of these groups. I may suggest attending the Edith Stein Conference Feb. 23-24 to learn about women's issues. Or contact Emily Weisbecker to interview for next year's "Loyal Daughters." Join Sustained Dialogue -perhaps the most "vibrant" group from The Observer's perspective since it brings together people from "both sides" to debate and discuss a number of issues. Mark your calendars for the Hight to Life Conference April 13-14 to discuss human sexuality. 
The University is not hurt in the slightest by the invisibility of the "Monologues" this year. I could fill this entire newspaper with opportuni­ties for vibrant dialogue which have all proven more fruitful than the viewing of an explicit stage produc­tion year after year. The dialogue does continue, in a civilized, educated and reasonable fashion every day. Hather than sitting in a pi ush theatre seat you can actively discuss with your peers and professors. You can volunteer by working at one of the local women's centers. You can per­sonally step forward and be a part of these issues. I would invite you all to participate with us. It is not hard to get involved, and it will be rewarding. 
Perhaps we do not scream and sling mud at each other, but this is not the proper form of debate at a premier academic institution. If that is what you wish for, then I respectfully sug­gest you consider transferring to another school.

Looking for cotnedy in the conservative -world 
It's often tempting for a tree-hug­ging, anti-war, blue-state Yankee like me to get a little self-important while watching the foibles of conservative America in recent months. As if hear­
ing President Bush say "Madam Speaker" at his State of the Union Address wasn't sat­isfying enough, learning that the leader of the National 

Association of Joey Falco 
Evangelicals had an affair with a gay Forty Ounces prostitute last fall to Falco almost caused me to spit my free-range chicken out onto a biodegradable recycled napkin, and what an eco-waste that would have been! 
I soon realized, however, that much of my liberal arrogance and ability to laugh at the antics of the Keystone Kops in the White House can be attrib­uted entirely to the fact that nearly all of America's current comedy is whole­heartedly liberal. Having Jon Stewart or Jay Leno cue me in on when to laugh at a presidential misnomer cer­tainly makes me feel better for not supporting the president's Iraq troop buildup. And hearing Stephen Colbert mock Republican ideology by sounding like a stubborn fool who honors blind faith over solid fact definitely allows me to pat myself on the back for encouraging increased measures to eliminate global warming. 
But what about conservatives? Maybe the reason they're so glum all the time -picketing abortion clinics, chopping down trees, blowing up other countries, fantasizing about Jack Bauer-is that they don't have any conservative comedians to bright­en their spirits and bolster their ideol­ogy. Whenever Nancy Pelosi is feeling down, she can simply turn on "The Daily Show" and listen to Jon Stewart do his Dick Cheney impression. But what about Dick? Where does Dick turn when he needs to laugh at America's silly liberals? 
Sure, there are a few bright spots of Republican humor in America. Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of "South Park," famously announced a few years back that they voted Republican because, while they "hate conservatives, they really [expletive] hate liberals." "South Park" is possibly the funniest show on television, but one can hardly call Parker and Stone's outrageously offensive humor "conser­vative." Then there are the members of the highly successful Blue Collar Comedy Tour -certainly some of the favorite comedians of the American South. Unfortunately, these four men are only at their best when they are either fall-down drunk (Ron White) or making fun of themselves for being hicks (Jeff Foxworthy and the Get 'R Done guy). One could also point to the so-called "American Conservative Comedian" Brad Stine as a beacon of humorous hope for the conservative world, but a quick scan of YouTube proved that Brad Stine's rants on the difference between cat names and dog names were about as comically inspir­ing as Ben Stein's deadpan teaching voice in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." 
Simply put, there is no truly funny conservative comedian out there who rips into the left wing like Stewart, Colbert, and Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat) rip a new one into the political right. 
Then along came the programming gurus at the Fox News Channel. In an effort to tap into the market for politi­cal comedy exposed by Stewart and Colbert, Fox News introduced a con­servative version of "The Daily Show" last night, cleverly titled "The Half­Hour News Hour." Unfortunately, that title was really only clever the first time it was used-in the short-lived 1983 MTV show featuring Victoria Jackson titled "The Half-Hour Comedy Hour." Strike one, Fox News. 
The new show is the brainchild of Joel Surnow, the co-creator of the most patriotic show in the history of the world, "24." Surnow, who actually calls himself "a right-wing nut job," decided that a conservative comedy news program was necessary because "the other side hasn't been skewered in a fair and balanced way." To fur­ther clarify this point, advertisements leading up to the show's premiere announced that it might offend "the left, the far left, anyone standing to the left, gay penguins, lawyers, the ACLU, anyone with the ACLU in their name, etc." Clearly, skewering in a "fair-and-balanced way" meant attacking both liberals and their gay counterparts in the penguin communi­ty. Unfortunately, if Morgan Freeman taught us anything last year, it's that Americans love penguins-even pen­guins who like dudes. Strike two, Fox News. 
When portions of "The Half-Hour News Hour" were finally released to the public in the past few days, one would have expected a truly rollicking zinger to introduce the show to the world. Instead, co-anchor Kurt Long 

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
ACE for all reasons 
Thirteen years ago I graduated from Notre Dame with majors in marketing and sociology, an optimism for the future and a desire to serve. One of 40 fortu­nately selected to comprise the first class of a new program called the Alliance for Catholic Education, I had an undergradu­ate degree, a big heart and a thirst for adventure. 
We spent that first summer developing in each of the three pillar areas of ACE: teaching, community and spirituality. Then it was off to Hammond, La. For the next two years I taught religion and English to fifth and sixth graders at the under-resourced Holy Ghost Catholic School there. I lived in a community with fellow ACE teachers and we shared everything from evening meals to lesson plans. We celebrated classroom triumphs, supported one another when people less than half our age got the better of us and wondered together about the futures of our students, our schools and ourselves. 
Now former pupils are calling me with engagement announcements, career plans and questions of their own about what impact they will have on the world. I know that somewhere in there a seed was planted a dozen years ago, and I hope that I played some part, even if a slight one, in these young men and women growing and blossoming into com­mitted Christians and citizens who are going on, in turn, to create a better world. 
In my current work with homeless men, women, and children, I'm tasked with thinking of new and more effective ways to break the ruthless cycle of genera­tional poverty afflicting our nation today. It's a very large and complicated prob­lem, but there's one thing I know for cer­tain: there's no replacement for a strong education. There's no exaggerating the impact a teacher can have on the life of a young mind. I have also come to realize that there's no exaggerating the impor­tance of the preparation needed to become a highly effective teacher. I am convinced that ACE not only prepared me to be the best possible teacher I could be, but that it continues to get better each year. 
There's also great need in our Catholic schools today. Our Church is in a position to continue, as it has historically, to serve immigrant and inner-city families by pro­viding them with quality schooling and formation in faith and character. But this is only possible if people like you commit your time and energy to the mission. ACE teachers today have a unique and crucial role to play in the future of our Church and country. Last July, the U.S. Secretary of Education, Margaret Spellings, speak­ing at the ACE Commencement Exercises, praised Catholic schools as "national treasures" that must be preserved. In particular, she cited their heroic work to educate the poor and marginalized, whether the students are Catholic or not. 
So if you seek to change the world one life at a time or if you're looking, like I was, to give to give back something of what you've been given here under the Dome, ACE is one incredible experience for a truly credible cause. I have pro­found gratitude for my challenging, awe­inspiring time in ACE, and I hope many of you will look to serve in this program that, without question, was the most transformative experience of my life.

led with the following: "Illinois Sen. Barack Obama admits that as a teenager he sometimes used cocaine. This news sent Obama's approval rat­ing among Democrats plummeting to an all-time low of99.9 percent." A laugh track (I didn't even know they still existed) filled in the awkward silence that followed until Long added, "But, in a related story, Sen. Obama has just been endorsed for president by former Washington, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry." Even the prerecorded laugh track had a tough time giggling after this one. Strike three, Fox News. 
Clearly, conservative Americans are faced with a serious dilemma. Without any truly great comedians or remotely· funny political satire shows to tickle his gun-toting funny bone, what is a right-wing boy to do when he needs to let out a good laugh after a long day of melting the polar ice caps with the exhaust from his Hummer? Certainly, he cannot be expected to laugh along with Stephen Colbert as he unabashedly mocks Bill O'Reilly. 
No, without a talented conservative comedian to incite their laughter, right-wing Americans will simply have no choice but to continue to grumpily invade foreign nations, attack illegal immigrants and destroy the happiness of gay Americans -and gay penguins -everywhere. 
It's not their fault. They just haven't had anything to laugh at in awhile.

Kaleidoscope a valuable addition 
Vu Nguyen's criticism of the comic strip Kaleidoscope McDaniels ("Kaleidoscope McDaniels proves its poor taste," Feb. 16) is unwarranted. It is true that the comic does dance along the border between decency and obscenity, but it also takes on issues that we must confront ourselves. One example of this is the very memo­rable comic that featured University founder Father Edward Sorin shotgunning a Natural Light. That comic showed the irony that Notre Dame is riddled with. Here we have arguably the most famous Catholic university in the world, yet there is an unending search for debauchery on the weekends. 
Another example is the Eating Disorders Conference comic Nguyen mentioned. To be perfectly honest, the reality of the impor­tance of such a conference was not apparent to me until I read the comic which made fun of Notre Dame's perceptions of eating disor­ders. Our inability to laugh at the imperfections we are riddled with is a reflection on our inability to correct these imperfections. For example, the constant comparison of girls to gremlins reflects the dominant opinion of many Notre Dame men who feel that Notre Dame women do not fit society's norms for beauty. As most of us will admit, society's "norm" for beauty is an exaggeration and is not representative of reality anyway. The comic's portrayal,then, challenges the men to alter their perceptions of women here. 
It is true that sometimes the portrayals are ridiculous, such as Nguyen's reference to the comic featuring University president Father John Jenkins smoking marijuana. What makes this comic funny, though, is not that Jenkins is portrayed as being a pothead, but that this is very unlike Jenkins. Personally, I find Liam Moran's sarcasm and satire a refreshing escape from the surrealistic life that Notre Dame is famous for. Kaleidoscope McDaniels is a valu­able addition to The Observer. We spend so much time worrying about the image of the University and the student body, but most of us are not willing to make a change. We want the world to see us as a pristine and wholly moral institution. So every now and then, we need a humorous reminder that the world and even Notre Dame are not perfect places.

DVD REVIEWS 
New 1 Dogs' DVD has bite to match bark 
By BRIAN DOXTADER Scene Editor 
Has it really been 15 years since "Reservoir Dogs" came along and introduced the world to the mad genius of writer/director Quentin Tarantino? The cooler-than-cool dia­logue, the matching suits, the ear-slic­ing violence and the constant cultural references made Tarantino a hot com­modity in Hollywood. Those elements laid the groundwork for his next pic­ture, "Pulp Fiction." Yet "Reservoir Dogs" remains a great film on its own merits, an involving and fast-paced heist movie with a freewheeling energy and desultory sense of detached cool. 
The basic plot revolves around a dia­mond heist organized by Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney). Cabot hires a group of professional thieves, who are all given code names: the unstable Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), the sea­soned veteran Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), the rookie Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) and the consummate profession­al Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi). After the robbery -which is never shown on­screen -goes awry and Mr. Orange ends up with a bullet in his gut, the an immersive mix that uses quite a bit of surround. "Heservoir Dogs" is a dia­logue-heavy nim, and the dialogue is clear and upfront. 

This edition jettisons the worthless full screen version of the film in favor of some new special features, which include a documentary about the impact "Heservoir Dogs" has had, and some interesting featurettes on the characters. The commentary tracks are the same as on the 10-year anniversary l:)dition..~Qich means ifs snippets of Tarantino, and not an actu­al track he recorded specifically for the film. 
"Reservoir Dogs" is released in some of the funkiest packaging to come around in a while. It comes in a tin case shaped like a gasoline barrel, with the DVDs themselves housed in a giant cardboard matchbox. Unfortunately, there's no booklet to accompany the set, but the packaging is definitely unique. 
It's usually difficult to recommend upgrades on films, especially since it encourages studios to release multiple versions. In the case of "Reservoir Dogs," however, the remasteted pic­ture and i!Udio are eno,l,lgll,ip, Il)-P.)~}(; .. 1this a worthwhile release of a ground­breaking picture.

thieves assemble at the meeting point and try to determine which one of them is the rat. 
"Reservoir Dogs" didn't quite have the massive cultural impact of "Pulp Fiction," but it came pretty close, though accusations that it ripped off the Hong Kong film "City on Fire" slightly hampered its reputation. Still, Tarantino's sense o[ dialogue (much of which has little to do with the plot) and pacing drive "Reservoir Dogs" and are the main reasons it doesn't feel outdated. 
Artisan released a special edition to commemorate the 1Oth anniversary, and five years later, Lions Gate has released a 15th anniversary edition. This is something the studios can keep milking, with a new release of "Reservoir Dogs" every five years ­fans will surely appreciate shelling out more money for bigger and better editions. 
Actually, however, in this case there is ample reason to upgrade. The pic­ture quality was one of the weakest points on Artisan's release, with faded, washed-out colors. The image has been remastered on Lions Gate's ver­sion and the difference is immediately noticeable. The colors are much more 
vibrant and the 


image looks much sharper. The audio is improved as well, with a 6.1 DTS-ES track (and a 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround EX mix), which doesn't sound a whole lot different than Artisan's 5.1 DTS track -still, it's 

Anniversary of 'The Doors' breaks on through 
By BRIAN DOXTADER Scene Editor 
Oliver Stone's biopic "The Doors" is much like the band itself -sometimes brilliant, maddeningly inconsistent, yet ultimately memorable. It was released to mixed reviews a decade and a half ago, and its uneasy mixture of standard biopic, nco-psy­chedelic head-trip, and rock god worship understandably caused reservations with critics and audiences. Yet it's still a fascinat­ingly atypical look at a major rock band, anchored by a strong cast and the group's music. 
"The Doors" hits all of the major points in the band's development: its formation in Los Angeles in the mid-1960s, the skyrocketing popularity of its first album, its infamous performance on Ed Sullivan, Morrison's trial for indecent exposure and his death in Paris in 1971. The band consisted of singer Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer), keyboardist Ray Manzarek (Kyle MacLachlan), guitarist Robby Krieger (Frank Whaley) and drum­mer John Densmore (Kevin Dillon). The fihn focuses on Morrison, whose increasingly erratic behavior and difficult relationships

with girlfriend Pam Courso (Meg Ryan) and rock journalist Patricia Kennealy (Kathleen Quinlan) form the bulk of the picture. 
Kilmer's performance may be the best thing about "The Doors." He effortlessly embodies the spirit and quirks of Morrison, drawing the audience into the character. Stone, however, makes the charismatic front man almost impenetrable, which means that "The Doors" isn't as insightful as it could (and should) be. The Doors' music, which forms most of the soundtrack, is great, with many of the band's biggest hits and best known tracks ("Ught My Fire," "Break On Through," "Riders on the Storm") making appearances. 
Stone remains an energetic and powerful director, and there are scenes of great power and beauty. The strangeness of the film often matches the strangeness of the band, which is why many of the sequences feel oddly appropriate, despite theil' seem­ingly unfocused nature. The concert scenes in particular are often fantastic, and the fihn version of the band does a great job of imitating the strangeness of The Doors' stage show. 
Unfortunately, the fihn often gets bogged down in nco-psychedelic fantasy, much of 


which does little to advance the plot. This would be forgiv­able if "The Doors" made much effort to give psychological insight into the mind of Morrison, but it instead chooses to celebrate his legend. The film includes plenty of familiar folklore about The Lizard King, such as his claim that the spirit of a dying Indian entered his body when he was a child. 

"The Doors" was already released once on a special edition DVD, now usurped by this new 15th anniversary edition. Both ver­sions were two-dises, but the 15th anniver­sary edition has received a picture and audio upgrade. The 6.1 DTS track sounds fantastic, with The Doors' music popping out of the speakers. Most of the special fea­tures, which are housed on the second disc, focus on the band rather than the film. Sadly, the DVD does not contain an audio commentary from director Oliver Stone, which would have been welcome, especially considering Stone's outspokenness and the mixed reaction to the fihn. 
As a document of its time and a straight­forward examination of the band, the impact of "The Doors" is negligibh~. It's not quite a great picture, but it's not nearly as bad as its reputation, either. The new 15th anniversary edition is a welcome upgrade, especially for those who have never seen the film -it's a strange and sometimes powerful ode to one of the 1960s most revered rock gods.

The dangers of walking in a winter wonderland 
Normally I'm a fairly sure-footed fel­low, save for those occasional exceptions when my internal inner-ear mechanism seems to be out of whack (such as late at night Thursdays, Fridays or Saturdays on my way to and from Sbarros). 
So imagine my shock when I was exiting DeBartolo last week, bundled up in my jacket like a South Park character to protect against the cold, when I slipped on some ice and bit it. Hard. I felt like Kenny as he suffers one of his many ignominious deaths. 
As I lay there dazed, random passers-by looked at me in derision, laughter written all over their faces. (Oh, and by the way, thanks to random South Quad guy for stepping over my prone form. What a Good Samaritan you are.) 
Of course, I have been on the other side of that scenario, pointing and giggling like a schoolchild as other people wiped out on the treacherous slip 'n' slides that pass for walkways around this campus. However, I found the sudden role rever­sal somewhat less than hilarious. 
It's all fun and games until you're splattered on the ground like Humpty Dumpty. Trust me, it's no fun when you find yourself in that position. So as I lay there in what some would refer to as the "Awkward Turtle" position, flipped back­wards onto my shell as my arms and legs waved feebly in the air, a variety of thoughts occurred to me. 

The first was just to lie there and die of embarrassment and hypothermia. 'Til wait it out until I succumb to the freezing temperature and my body shuts down," I thought. Well played, Mother Nature, I thought, as I waited for Death to take me (complete with scythe and Norm MacDonald's voice). 
Yet apparently a part of my psyche wanted to live, for some spark within me burst into flame. "No," I thought, "it's not my time to die. Not yet." As such, the next issue at hand was how to get up. This turned out to be easier said than done. However, as Jeff Goldblum and the Jurassic Park movies taught us, "Life will find a way." 
I recalled a news story I read once about how a pair of hikers trapped in a snowstorm built an igloo and weathered the frozen tempest. So I started to gather snow about me in the hopes of insulating myself against the cold. Unfortunately, all I succeeded in doing was creating a sort of sloppy snow angel out of the muddy slush around me. 
Finally, I was able to roll over and pick myself up off the ground, wet and cold with a bruised knee and a battered ego. 
So if you find yourself in that position, perched precariously at the tipping point between keeping your footing and finding yourself splayed out on some black ice, here are a few tips: 
+Yelp for help and latch onto anyone and anything close at hand. Maybe you'll be able to stay upright, but even if you can't, misery loves company and it always helps to drag people down with you. 

+ Tuck your shoulder and try to snap roll like a ninja (you could also try to launch into some break-dancing move like the step-over). The upside to this one is that if you pull it off, you'll probably look pretty cool, although the downside is that if you don't pull it off, you'll probably just face-plant and eat some ice. 
+Try to increase the coeffrcientof:\fr.~c­tion on your shoe soles by wrappiiig chains around your sneaker soles. Who says snow tires are just for cars? 
+ Or you could try to build a protective igloo or pass off your wiping out as an impromptu snow angel-making session. 
Regardless of what you decide to go with, remember to keep a smile on your face as you traverse the treacherous crosswalks on campus. Whoever thought that walking could become an extreme sport?

Fear of the uncertain is one of the most alarming and terrifying feelings. Not know­ing where one is, how one got there or ­worst of all -who one is can instill a ter­ror so profound that one resorts to desper­ate measures to find the answers to these simple questions. 
This is the dilemma facing five men who awake to find themselves injured and locked inside a warehouse in the movie "Unknown." Confused as to who they are and why they are injured, the men learn from a discarded newspaper they are all connected with a kidnapping plot -and that two were kidnapped while the other three were kidnappers. 
A phone call alerts them that the ring­leader of the kidnapping will return to the warehouse in several hours to "sort out" the situation. What follows is a race against time for the men to piece together their col­lective memories and escape the ware­house before the other kidnappers arrive. 
The greatest strength of "Unknown" is its script. Penned by Notre Dame grad Matthew Waynee, the smart writing drops hints and creates mystery at just the right times. Cerebral explorations of good and evil take place at the same time as charac­ter development and even brief flashes of humor, demonstrating Waynee's skill in his first screenplay. 
The narrative is quick-paced and com­plex, using flashbacks to gradually reveal the truth to the audience slightly before the characters themselves realize it. One man (Jim Caviezel, "The Passion of the Christ") seems most integral to the plot and quickly becomes the story's protagonist. 
Caviezel's fellow actors include Greg Kinnear ("Little Miss Sunshine"), Barry Pepper ("Saving Private Ryan"), Joe Pantoliano ("Memento") and Jeremy Sisto ("Six Feet Under"), all of whose story arcs weave in and out of each other as their characters gain and lose each other's trust. 
At its heart, "Unknown" is a psychologi­cal thriller about the interaction of fear and trust, and all five men convey this per­
fectly in their acting.

Widescreen Edition 
Weinstein Company 


Occasionally, the narrative eases the tension by leaving the warehouse to show us the head kidnapper (Peter Stormare, "Prison Break") and the wife of one of the kid­napped men (Bridget Moynahan, "I, Robot"), two deep characters that add much to the film. 

The excellent script and acting overcome what is mediocre directing and camera work, especially since the unchanging set­ting provided director Simon Brand a realm of creative possibilities. The simple and repetitive cinematography becomes evident towards the end of the film, which is also when the whole ship starts to sink. 
In any film of this genre, like "Reservoir Dogs," one expects plot twists, and they begin in earnest in the last 15 minutes of "Unknown." As the plot twists begin to pile up like the dead bodies in the film, howev­er, the plausibility becomes questionable. 
Ultimately, the good traits of the first thrilling hour of the movie become negated by unrealistic events and connections view­ers are asked to believe in the last few min­utes. This is not to say that the movie is not worthwhile -the acting is superb, and the first five minutes alone should be enough to hook anyone. However, it is hard to imag­ine what "Unknown" could have been had its ending kept pace with the rest of the movie.

Associated Press 
LAS VEGAS -The Eastern Conference turned the NBA's big game in Las Vegas into a dud. 
Overmatched by the West -or perhaps worn out from a weekend of partying in Sin City-the East bum­bled its way to a 153-132 loss Sunday night in the All­Star game. 
Kobe Bryant had 31 points and six of the West's record 52 assists and was the game MVP. Amare Stoudemire added 29 points for the West, which quickly built a big lead and held it this time, a year after blowing a 21-point cushion in a loss in Houston. 
LeBron James scored 28 points for the East, and Dwight Howard had 20 points and 12 rebounds, but offense wasn't the prob­lem -the East allowed a record 69 field goals. 
An event that some locals called the biggest thing to hit Las Vegas featured showgirls, acrobats, magi­cians and Elvis imperson­ators -all the glitz and glamour that this city offers in excess. 
Good thing the players had plenty to deflect the attention away from them. 
The East was hovering at barely 40 percent shooting for nearly all of the first three quarters in a game that isn't known for its defensive intensity before a late flurry during garbage time brought it up to 49 percent. 
Late All-Star addition Carmelo Anthony scored 20 points and Shawn Marion of Phoenix, who played at the Thomas & Mack Center at UNLV, added 18. 
Dwyane Wade had only 10 points on 5-of-12 shoot­ing, but he had reason to be tired after hosting events Thursday and Friday night. Those were two of the many functions that kept the players out until all hours of the night. 
Still, the game was sec­ondary to the show in this most unusual of All-Star games -and it was quite a show. 
With tickets unavailable to the public, brokers were asking more than $20,000 for a top seat. Jay-Z, Beyonce, Diddy, Prince, Eva Longoria and Adam Sandler were among those who scored spots in the front row, and Christina Aguilera and Toni Braxton performed at halftime. 
The event started with a celebrity red carpet, where Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman, flanked as usual 
by  his  showgirls  and  
backed  by  entertainer  
Wayne  Newton,  vowed  

again to get the NBA here full-time with a new arena to play in. 

IN BRIEF 
Howell defeats Mickelson in 
playoff to win Nissan Open 
LOS ANGELES -Charles Howell III finally ended that nasty habit of finishing second, making three clutch pars in a playoff that deliv­ered a dramatic victory over Phil Mickelson in the Nissan Open on Sunday. 
Howell closed with a 6-under 65 and got into a playoff when Mickelson bogeyed the 18th hole. Howell put away the two-time Masters champion with his third straight par save, holing a 3-foot putt on the 14th hole and raising his head to the sky in utter relief. 
"I said a prayer before I hit the putt," Howell said, his voice crack­ing. "I said, 'It's time. Go in.'" 
It was only the second victory of his career, and Howell had been haunted by nine runner-up finishes since winning the now-defunct Michelob Championship in the fall of 2002. 
Harvick edt!es Martin for 
win in rough'Daytona 500 
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -Kevin Harvick nosed out Mark Martin in a frantic wreck-filled finish to win Sunday's Daytona 500. 
Martin, making his 23rd attempt at a 500 win, seemed to have victory in hand when a hard-charging Harvick barreled along the outside of Martin to earn his second victory at Daytona International Speedway in two days. Harvick won Saturday's Busch race -his first victory at Daytona. 
As Harvick pushed into the lead, Kyle Busch wiggled behind them and bumped into Matt Kenseth to start a melee. Harvick and Martin raced side by side, waiting for NASCAR to call for a caution. When it finally came, Harvick was barely ahead. 
"My go-kart experience over the winter paid off, because I didn't let off the floor and we just kept hitting things and the wall and bouncing off everything," Harvick said. 
Shvedova sweeps San!angelo 
to win first career WTA event 
BANGALORE, India -Yaraslova Shvedova of Russia won her first WTA Tour title by stunning top-seeded defending champion Mara Santangelo of Italy 6-4, 6-4 at the Sony Ericsson International on Sunday. 
Shvedova, ranked 143rd in the world, again showed the outstanding form she displayed all week to over­come the 36th-ranked Santangelo. 
"It's been a wonderful week, win­ning one's first title surely is a very special moment," said an excited Shvedova. 
"Playing my first final, I took one game at a time and tried to keep things simple," said Shvedova, who had the spectators rooting for her in this southern Indian city. 
Santangelo committed too many unforced errors. 
"I played well to reach the final, but she played better than me today," Santangelo said.

Irish win twice in last at-bats in opening tourney 
Freshman Johnson goes 81or-16 with a homer in her collegiate debut 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 
Freshman Heather Johnson wasted no time making her presence known at Notre Dame. 
In her debut this weekend, the rookie racked up eight hits, four RBI's and a walk-off home run as the Irish went 2-3 to open their season at the Tiger Invitational. 
Trailing 5-4 in the bottom of the seventh against Tennessee Tech Saturday, Johnson stepped up to the plate with a runner on third. She got a hold of a pitch and drove her third hit of the game over the fence to help Notre Dame pick up a win over a weekend where the Irish went 2-3. 
Johnson, who leads the team with a .500 batting average, also played a big role in the first win of the season. Friday afternoon the Irish took on Auburn at Jane B. Moore field and won in another final at-bat thriller. 
Tiger outfielder Myesha Finney gave Auburn a 2-1 lead in the seventh with a sacrifice fly, but the advantage did not last long. Senior captain Stephanie Brown led off the inning with a bloop single for Notre Dame and eventually scored on a sacrifice from Johnson to tie the score. 
Sophomore Erin Glasco ended the game in the very next at bat with a line drive single down the right field line. 
Sophomore pitcher Brittany Bargar threw complete games in both wins, striking out a combined total of 15 batters and allowing three earned runs. Bargar lost her first game of the year Sunday in a 2-0 pitcher's duel with Virginia Tech. 
Hokie junior Angela Tincher continued her incredible start to the season with a one-hit complete game shutout. Tincher (5-0, 0.60 ERA) has thrown complete games in all five of her starts so far this season. She has three shutouts and is averaging more than two strikeouts per inning. Tincher rang up 15 batter against the Irish. 
Notre Dame also dropped games to UAB and Tulsa. 
UAB (4-4) jumped out to a quick lead in the second game of Friday's doubleheader by scoring at least one run in each of the first four innings. Junior shortstop Holly Krzan put the final nail in the coffin for the Blazers with a two-run double in the sixth to bring the score to 8-0. 
The Irish bats also struggled in their loss to the Golden Hurricanes. Notre Dame's offense was dormant until the fifth inning when Brown· drove in junior outfielder Sarah Smith on a double and later came around to score junior shortstop Katie Laing got a ball deep enough for Brown to tag

ND tops No. 7 UNC, No. 20 Wake Forest to stay unbeaten this year 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Wrirer 

No. 2 Notre Dame made its case this weekend for a No. 1 ranking, knocking off two more top-20 teams with a 5-2 win over No. 7 North Carolina Friday and a 7-0 win Sunday over No. 20 Wake Forest. 
Against the Tar Heels, the Irish stumbled out of the gate, losing the doubles point for only the second time this season. Both doubles pairings of Christian and Catrina Thompson and Brooke Buck and Kelcy Tefft dropped their matches, giving the Tar Heels an early 1-0 lead. 
"I was a little nervous after that," Irish coach Jay Louderback said. "[Freshmen] Cosmina Ciobanu and Kali Krisik played well, but our other two doubles teams just didn't play well." 
Luckily for Notre Dame, the Tar Heels were missing some of their players due to sickness, including No. 7 Jenna Long. 
"They fought harder than we did. I thought winning the dou­bles point gave us some momen­tum, but they came out and won a bunch of first sets and took some momentum away from us," North Carolina coach Brian Kalbas said. ''I'm not so sure we would've won the match [if we were healthy] with the way they played singles." 
After junior Brooke Buck made quick work of Tar Heels sopho­more Meg Fanjoy 6-0, 6-1, North Carolina took a 2-1 lead when Christian Thompson fell to fresh­man Katrina Tsang 6-3, 6-2. 
No. 41 Catrina Thompson dom­inated Tar Heels sophomore No. 33 Austin Smith in the first set, 6­1, and staved off a comeback by Smith in the second set, winning it 7-5 and tying the score at two points apiece. 
"Austin Smith played really well to stay in the match, and I was impressed with the way she played," Louderback said. 
Freshman Colleen Hielley snapped her four-match losing streak with a 6-4, 6-2, defeat of Tar Heels senior Sara Anundsen to make the score 3-2. 
Then, in a match that drew the attention of the crowd gathered at the Eck Tennis Pavilion, Ciobanu fought back from a 4-1 first-set deficit and a 5-2 second­set deficit to knock off North Carolina freshman Sanaz Marand 6-4, 7-5. Ciobanu's victo­ry clinched the match for the Irish. 
"That match was very tiring," Ciobanu said. "I think the difler­ence was the momentum shifts. The first set, she played unbeliev­able, and then I had a good game at ~-1 and started playing bet­ter. 
Teffi added the fifth point after dropping the first set to North Carolina's Caitlin Collins, 4-6, 6­2, and 6-3. 
On Sunday, the Irish made quick work of Wake Forest. The Irish grabbed all three doubles matches, and Christian Thompson and Hielley won first­set tiebreakers to boost the Irish to victory. 
"I just thought we played really well all weekend," Louderback said. "Our doubles bounced back [Sunday]." 
Ciobanu preserved her perfect 10-0 dual match record and clinchfld the match again for the Irish. 
Notre Dame has a couple of days off before it battles Iowa Sunday at home. 
"We can get a couple of our kids to get a couplB of days rest," Louderback said. "WB've had three tough matches in live days. We've had a few naghring iqjuries with some players, so it's good to get them a few days rest."

Irish fall just short in Big East championship 

PHIL HUDELSON!The Observer Irish freshman Ray Toomey swims during the Dennis Stark relays Oct. 6. Notre Dame finished in first with 264 points. 
West Virginia denies Welsh and Co. third straight Big East title 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame achieved coach Tim Welsh's goal of swimming lifetime bests at the Big East championships this past week­end, but it still wasn't enough for the Irish to capture their third consecutive Big East title. 
Heading into the fmal event of the four-day championships ­the 400-yard freestyle relay ­the Irish held a three-and-a-half point lead over West Virginia. The Notre Dame quartet of freshman John Lytle and seniors Louis Cavadini, Ted Brown and Tim Kegelman touched the wall in a school-record time of 2:59.59, but they were outdone by the Mountaineers, who fin­ished the race in 2:56.21. 
The victory gave West Virginia 40 points while Notre Dame's third-place finish netted 32, which was the ultimate differ­ence in the Mountaineers' 765.5­761 defeat of the Irish. 
"It's crushing, but I don't feel like we lost the meet as much as West Virginia won it," Welsh said. "We had four guys set a school record in the last event, and it still wasn't enough. What more can you ask of them?" 
In addition to the 400-yard freestyle relay, Notre Dame set nine school records, 13 season­best times and six NCAA consid­eration times. 
"We swam fast, and we raced well," Welsh said. "If you look at anything other than the final score, we had a very good meet." 
Despite Notre Dame's impres­sive performances, which includ­ed seven second-place finishes, the Irish did not win a single event. West Virginia took 12 out of the 15 events. 
"[Not winning any events] played an enormous role," Welsh said. "On the positive side, though, the fact that we almost won the title without winning a single event shows the emphasis we place on the team aspect. We're team-oriented rather than superstar-oriented." 
Brown and Kegelman, espe­cially, stood out on the weekend. Brown, who picked up three all­Big East honors on the weekend, finished his career at Notre Dame with nine such accolades. Kegelman, who also picked up three all-Big East honors, con­cludes his Irish career with a school-record 12 conference awards. 
"They've been very depend­able performers, and they go about things the right way," Welsh said. "We've leaned on them ever since they've been here, and we'll miss them." 
In addition to the senior lead­ers, the team's underclassmen also raced well. 
Lytle set school records in both the 100 and 200-meter freestyle. NCAA "B" cut times were posted by freshman MacKenzie LeBlanc (200-meter butterfly) and sopho­more Sam Pendergast (100­meter breaststroke), and sopho­more Daniel Rave achieved a NCAA consideration time in the 200-meter breaststroke. Juniors Jay Vanden Berg and Rob Seery, who both garnered all-Big East honors in the 1,650-meter freestyle, will also be back next season. 
"We have a very good return­ing team, a very good incoming class, and we aren't graduating any of our divers," Welsh said. "We want some time to recover a little bit [from this weekend's loss], but we think the future's very bright for us."

she has topped 25 points. Allen became the first Notre Dame player who has scored upward of 25 points in three straight games since Katryna Gaither scored 25 in the first four rounds of the 1997 NCAA Tournament. 
"[Allen has] been amazing the last few weeks," McGraw said. "She's shooting the ball well. She's taking good shots, she's not forcing things. She's scoring in the offense. She's patient -the team is looking for her and yet not exclusively. She's been just phenomenal." 
Despite Notre Dame's second­half domination, the opening period was much more of a back-and-forth battle. Friars guard Chelsea Marandola took control of the first half, scoring 14 points with four boards and three assists. Providence led for most of the stanza, and had a 33-31 lead with less than four minutes to play. 
Allen nailed every shot she took down the first-half stretch, sinking two free throws and two jumpers to put the Irish up three. 
Allen led all scorers with 26 points, but Notre Dame's offense was split between its entire line­up. Four Irish players fmished in double figures, as freshman guard Melissa Lechlitner scored 16, junior center Melissa D'amico had 11 and freshman center Erica Williamson finished with 10. 
Freshman guard Ashley Barlow fmished with eight points and nine rebounds. Notre Dame's freshmen once again outplayed the opponents bench, outscoring the Friars reserves 34-11. 
"I thought Melissa Lechlitner gave us a huge lift off the bench," McGraw said. "She did a good job of looking to score, doing what she can do running the offense, running in transi­tion. And I thought Erica came in and did a good job on the boards. And Ashley made some great contributions also." ,.. 

After the convincing win, McGraw still felt that the Irish had some work to do, especially on the defensive end of the court. 
"We've played a lot of man-to­man recently and so it was good to see our zone work today," she said. "Our press wasn't as good, I think we need to work on that a little more."

"We'll be fine once the Big East [schedule] starts [against South Florida March 23]." 
In the first game Saturday, Notre Dame hit three home runs in a win over Prairie View A&M. 
Designated hitter Mike Dury, third baseman A.J. Pollock and leftfielder Michael Wright all homered for the Irish. 
Sophomore Wade Korpi gave up four runs on four hits in four innings to earn the win for Notre Dame. 
The Irish jumped out to a 6­0 lead after three innings, but the Panthers (8-5) jumped on Korpi for four runs in the fourth to cut the lead to two. Notre Dame bounced back with a two-run single by sophomore Jeremy Barnes in the bottom half of the inning and then scored six in the sixth to blow the game wide open.

Irish coach 

Notre Dame eliminated Michigan, the only remaining contender, from the title race with the shutout win and then added a couple more points Saturday for a season total of 43 points with two games remaining -nine more than second-place Miami. 
The Irish are the first con­ference champions in college hockey this season, with both No. 2 Minnesota and No. 3 New Hampshire one win away from taking their respective titles in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association and Hockey East. Notre Dame also has the most wins (26) in col­lege hockey this season as the team heads into the final two games of the regular season this weekend at home against ninth-place Ferris State. 
It is the third CCHA regular­season championship for sec­ond-year coach Jackson, who won his first while head coach of Lake Superior State in 1990-91. He earned his sec­ond in 1995-96 when the Lakers split the crown with Michigan. 
"For me, it's all about Notre Dame and the hockey pro­gram," Jackson said. "It's huge stuff for us in such a short period of time. It's a real credit to the kids, and it's great for Notre Dame." 
It is the second time this sea­son that the Irish have swept Alaska (9-17 -6, 7-14-5 CCHA), with Notre Dame taking 3-1 and 6-2 decisions at home Dec. 2-3 over the then-No. 14 Nanooks. Notre Dame has gone 16-2-2 since that week­end, including a current nine­game unbeaten streak that started after a Jan. 19 loss to Western Michigan on the road. 
The Nanooks watched a promising start to their season give way to a free fall to the bottom of the league standings since that series. Alaska has gone 3-16-2 since Dec. 2, including a nine-game losing streak that ended with a 5-2 win Jan. 26 over last-place Bowling Green. 
The Irish, however, needed a third-period goal in the first game from freshman Ryan Thang and an overtime tally from sophomore Garrett Regan to get past the Nanooks -the fifth straight game in which the Irish have won by only one goal, including a 4-2 win Feb. 9 over Nebraska­Omaha in which the Irish got an empty-goal with only sec­onds left. 
"The thing is that we're win­ning those one-goal games," Jackson said. "It's more important that we win those games, than we lose them. If it's by one goal, then that's not a huge thing." 
Thang scored the only goal in Friday's 1-0 victory 4:47 into the third period when he stole the puck in Alaska's zone from defenseman Tyler Eckford and beat Nanooks goalie Wylie Rogers through his pads for the game-winner. 
Irish goalie Dave Brown made 28 saves to earn his fourth shutout of the year and the lOth of his career, before he was replaced in net Saturday by sophomore and 
bottom of the 

standings are not much different than the teams at the top." 
Pearce made 33 saves in the 3-2 Irish overtime win Saturday -his first start since a 4-2 loss Jan. 7 to Robert Morris. Sophomore center. Christian Hanson also made his first appearance this week­end since he was sidelined by mononucleosis over a month ago. 
"It was good to get Christian Hanson back in the lineup," Jackson said. "It was good to have Jordan Pearce get a game under his belt, play well and look confident. We want to get guys ready for the play­offs." 
Regan scored the overtime winner 1:41 into the extra ses­sion on a three-on-one. He made a rush up the ice with center Mark Van Guilder and defenseman Wes O'Neill and dished the puck off to Van Guilder in the Nanooks zone. Van Guilder drew in the Alaska defenseman and sent the puck back to Regan, who beat Alaska's Rogers up high for the win. 
"Once again, we found an answer," Jackson said. "It's a different guy every game." 
The Nanooks forced the overtime period when Alaska's Trevor Hyatt shoveled a rebound past Pearce 17:45 into the third period to tie the game 2-2. 
The Irish scored first with a power play goal from right wing Erik Condra at 8:29 of the second period. Alaska evened the game at 1-1 with a goal from right wing Kyle Greentree at 13:05, but the Irish got back into the lead 2-1 with Regan's first goal of the game a little over a minute later. 
"You get to February, right as everyone is battling for position in the playoffs, [andl it gets tight," Jackson said. "In every level I've ever been involved in, there's a different level of hockey after Christmas time and a different level right before the playoffs." 
Notes: 
+Jackson said senior for­ward Josh Sciba, who has been out of the Irish lineup for three weeks with an upper­body injury, will begin to skate again following next week­end's series against Ferris State. Sciba was last season's leading goal scorer and has seven goals and 10 assists in 27 games this year.

see in practice everyday that he's got a great stroke. lie's a very good shooter. That's something we want him to do, if he's open or even if he's a little bit contested ... beeause he's a long guy and can get the shot off against any other perimeter player." 
Ayers and Falls eontributed to Notre Dame's (20-6, 8-5 Big East) 13-of-20 perform­ance from 3-point land. 
Carter, who has been nurs­ing a hip flexor injury over the past few weeks, finished with only three points in lim­ited minutes. 
"Once he gets baek and he's healthy, we'll be hitting on all cylinders," Falls said. "It's huge for guys like Ayers to step up when he's not in thfl lineup." 
Trailing 37-30 at halftime, the Beareats (10-16, 1-11 Big East) could only get as close as four in the second half. Twiee in thfl frame, Cincinnati scored four straight points and picked up s_ome momentum, but Falls came down and knocked down 3-pointers -giving the Irish some breathing room and quieting the sold-out erowd of 11,038 at the Fifth Third Arena. 
"It's very fitting that [Falls] broke the record here because every one of those shots had a lot riding on it," Irish coach Mike Brey said. 
Beareat forward John Williamson matched Falls' game-high 23 points and guard Deonta Vaughn pitched in 22 for Cineinnati. 
The Beareats utilized baek­court zone pressure on the Irish for much of the second half, but could not create enough turnovers to give them the lead. 
"We were patient and took our time," Hillesland said. "A press like that is designed to make you go faster than you want to. They were quick, so it was just a matter of taking our time." 
Irish forward Luke llarangody gave the Irish a lift inside. The freshman scored eight in the second half, l'inishing with 11 points and eight rebounds for the game. 
"I just felt like I had good position down low on the block and I could get my shot off-and I did," Ilarangody said. 
In the first half, Notre Dame used 3-pointers from Falls and guards Tory Jackson and Jonathan Peoples to open up 
a 20-11 lead at 11:43. Cincinnati cut the lead to 22­18, but never got ahead. 
The victory lifted Notre Dame into a four-way tie for fourth place in the Big East with Marquette, West Virginia and Syracuse. The Irish own tiebreakers over the Orange and the Mountaineers, and 
face Marquette next Saturday at home. 
Notre Dame returns Tuesday to the Joyce Center to take on DePaul. The Blue Demons bested the Irish 6 7­66 in Chicago Feb. 8.

Conference clinched 
Irish win their first­ever CCHA regular season championship 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 
Only two years removed from a five-win season and a year after a rebuilding campaign ended in an early tournament exit, No. 1 Notre Dame has won the CCHA regular season title for the first time in the pro­gram's 39-year history. 
But Irish coach Jeff Jackson continued to walk the modest line that has been characteristic all year of a Notre Dame pro­gram that has shattered and barnstormed its way through records and ranked opponents

Big second-half run fuels squad's victory 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 
After going into the locker room with just a 3-point lead over Providence, Notre Dame scored the first 21 points of the second half en route to a domi­nating 82-65 road win Saturday. 
Notre Dame (18-8, 9-4) held Providence (13-13, 3-10) score­less for the first 8:57 of the half until Friars guard Brittany Dorsey hit a pair of free throws to make the score 60-38. Providence did not score its first field goal until 10:37 in the half, when Shauna Snyder sank a jumper at the free-throw line, pushing her over the 1,000 point mark for her career. 

In the opening nine minutes of the half, the Irish shot 7 -of-1 0 from the floor while the Friars were 0-of-12. 
"We switched to zone, we played mostly man in the first half, and [the switchI worked pretty well," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "They missed some shots, we rebounded well and we didn't give them any sec­ond chance opportunities." 
Irish guard Charel Allen was crucial to Notre Dame's second half success, scoring eight points in the first eight minutes of the half. Allen finished with 26 points -the third straight game

Falls breaks record in win 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Writer 
Irish guard Colin Falls scored 23 points and broke Notre Dame's career 3-point record as the Irish reached 20 wins Sunday for the first time in four seasons with a 76-64 victory in Cincinnati. 
Falls netted 5-of-8 threes to boost his career total to 305, surpassing former guard Chris Thomas (302) for the school mark. 
"It's a great accomplishment. There have been a lot of great shooters in Notre Dame's past," Falls said. "I've had a lot of great point guards that have gotten me the ball in posi­tions where I could make a lot of shots." 
Sophomore forward Ryan Ayers, who saw significant playing time in place of injured guard Hussell Carter, shot 4-of-4 from beyond the arc to finish with a career-high 12 points. 
"That's something we've been waiting on him to do," Irish forward Zach Hillesland said. "We
