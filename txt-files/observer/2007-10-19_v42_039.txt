Purchases of condos continue 
But sales slow amid football team's woes 
By MARY KATE MALONE and 
MADDIE HANNA 
News Writers 
Prompted by rising hotel prices that were costing them $6,000 each year, Notre Dame parents Rick and Terri Martini decided to purchase a condo at New London Lake near Bulla Road two years ago. 
The decision proved to be a profitable one. Rick, who lives in Pittsburgh, bought the property just as the off-campus housing market in South Bend was heat­ing up -and his condo has appreciated by 20 percent in 24 months. 
Condominiums, townhouses 

and hotel-condos have been 
sprouting up around Notre Dame, 
collectively feeding an investment . 
of more than $200 million to the '

Saint Mary's group will make pilgrimage to Monterrey, Mexico 
By KATLYN SMITH News Writer 
Six Saint Mary's students will travel to Monterrey, Mexico, during fall break, where they will immerse themselves in some of the most destitute areas of the region for a week. 
Carolyne Call, the director of the Office for Civil and Social Engagement (OCSE), will accompany the students to the Sisters of the Holy Cross Mission in Guadalupe, a suburb of Monterrey. The trip, which is sponsored by the OCSE and Campus Ministry, was offered for the first time at Saint Mary's last year. 
"Students see a different living situation and can experience spiritual growth in a completely new environment," Call said.

Shame of the Yankees

DECATUH, Ala. -Kim Ledford returned to her home after an extended absenee and found a strange man in her bed and a woman wearing her clothes. Then another man walked up to question why she was in his house.

Prime Minister Olmert pushes Putin to back major sanctions, halt sale of arms to Syria 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert pressed Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday to support new sanetions against Iran over its nuclear activities and urged Russia not to sell arms to Iran or Syria. 
Olmert's brief, abruptly announeed visit eame days after Putin traveled to Iran and met with its president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has publicly called for Israel's demise. During the trip, Putin vowed to support Iran's pur­suit of nuclear energy and warned "outside forees"-an apparent reference to the 
U.S. -against attacking Tehran. 
In a three-hour meeting with Putin, Olmert "expressed his opinion that effective sanctions by all the interna­tional eommunity would have the potential to stop Iran pur­suing the nuclear path," said Miri Eisin, the Israeli prime minister's spokeswoman.

Woo's story began with her birth in I long Kong as the fifth of six childrnn. In a dimate of polit­ical displacement, Woo learned to value life's opportunities. 
"! grew up with this sense l that) nothing is to be taken for granted.... Everything could just ehange places overnight," Woo said. 
Adding to the instability was Woo's father, who, though talent­ed and hard -working, abused alcohol, gambled and had a qukk temper. Woo's mother, like othnr women shn knew, lived a lifo of ((\ar and subordination.

At home, Woo grew under the 
care of her family's servant as 
well. 
"My mother by and large was nHtlly quite weak ... but my nanny was the opposite," Woo said. "She had this incredible abilit~ to find her way as a ser­vant. 
Yao brought unique experi­encns to the Woo family when she began working for them as a nanny even bd"ore Woo's birth. 
"She lwlped me undPrstand how servanL'i look at things.... It was r:.eally qu.ite a good expnri­ence, Woo sard. 
As Woo grew up in "chaos countered by family routines and celebrations," she discovered studying as a way to escape life's challenges. ller older brother attondcd a university in the Unitml States, and Woo became deterrnint\d to do the same. 
While her father respected her grades, he could not imaginP. sending his daughter to the United States. Woo said she sus­pects that her parents' visit to San Francisco in the 1960s prompted their view that the country had loose morals. 
Nonetheless, encouraged by hnr nanny, Woo persevnred in her quest to receive a college nducation in the United Statns. 
In an emotional moment, she told her father: "I don't want to be a daughter. .Just treat me as a son. I will accept the responsi­bilities of a son." 
During this time, Woo met a faculty member on leave from Purdue University and decided to apply to Purdue. She was accepted, but without her father's help, saw no way to pay the $1,600 tuition. 

Yao then revealed that she had established savings for the chil­dren. With her older sisters established in jobs and her brothers taken care of, Woo had full access to these funds. This money and the further financial support of Woo's siblings would fund one year in college. 
Woo enrolled as a student at Purdue University and entered the United States with little besides a gold bracelet, which was to be sold for a plane ticket if anything went wrong. 
After she arrived in the United States, Woo was homesick but found support in the Catholic Church and great satisfaction in all that slm was learning. 
"Because I only had one year, I didn't know where it would lead me," Woo reealled. She immersed herself in university life, taking 24 credits each

As sophomore year approached, Woo applied for one of two intornational student scholarships but feared a B­grade in one course would elimi­nate her from the competitive applicant pool. 
She received a three-year scholarship, which she used to finish a bachelor's degree and then a master's degree. She then completml a Ph.D. program, also at Purdue University. 
While Woo acknowledged the role of her own work ethic, she appreciated all who helped her rnach her goals. 
"When you need help. it's amazing how many people will lwlp," Woo said, mentioning her nanny, siblings, tho Purdue com­munity and those who welcomed her into their homes for holiday meals. 
Woo continuns to connect with pnople from her past. This week­end, two of the nuns who taught lwr in llong Kong will visit for the football game. The sisters, ages 85 and 95, continue to challenge her to be a citizen of the world, she said. 
Woo's hour-long presentation ended with open questions from audience members, who inquired about everything from job-searching and child-rearing to her choice of major.

Google surpasses Cisco Systems 
SAN FRANCISCO --Already the Internet search leader, Google Inc. picked up more bragging rights Thursday when it surpassed Cisco Systems Inc. as Silicon Valley's most valuable company. 
Then Google's third-quarter earnings provid­ed another reminder of why the nine-year-old company is such a hot commodity. 
In the latest on a long list of pleasant sur­prises, Google's profit soared 46 percent to surpass the high expectations that had elevat­ed its stock price by more than $100 in the past month. 
As it has been for years, Google reaped the benefits of running the Internet's most popular advertising network as more marketing dol­lars shift to the Web from television, radio, newspapers and magazines. 

Fruit prices rise as land is developed 
FOHT PIEHCE -There seem to be more trac­tors tearing up St. Lucie County's old citrus groves than tending them these days. 
This county once had more orange and grape­fruit trees than almost any other place in Florida. the nation's largest citrus producer. Now it's one of the fastest-growing counties in onn of America's fastest-growing states, and that land is fast giving way to housing tracts. 
The same is happening in varying degrees across f<'lorida's citrus belt. It has been for years, but the slow slide has suddenly quick­nned. Farmers are replanting fewer trees than any point since the 1970s, and crop land is rap­idly disappearing. Previously high land prices, diseases like citrus canker and greening and even the rising .cost of trees are hurting farmers and driving orange juice prices to reeord levels, up more than a third since 2002. 
"It's a very, very expensive process to get back into the business, even though you have land sit­ting there fallow," said Doug Bournique, head of the Indian River Citrus League. "It's not a dollar a tree like it was 20 years ago, just to pop them into the ground." It can now cost $10 a tree.

Coalition sets copyright guidelines 
Several major media companies outline various techniques for Web sites to filter material 
A~sociated Press 

LOS ANGELES -A coali­tion of major media and Internet companies Thursday issued a set of guidelines for handling copyright-protected videos on large user-generated sites such as MySpace. 
Conspicuously absent was Google Inc., whose YouTube Web site this week rolled out its own technology to fil­ter copyrighted videos once they've been posted. 
Media companies Walt Disney Co., Viacom Inc., CBS Corp., NBC Universal and News Corp. joined Internet companies Microsoft Corp., MySpace, Veoh Networks and Dailymotion to issue the guidelines, which would require sites to use filtering technology to block copy­righted clips from being posted without permission. 
The incentive for the coalition's Web sites and others to comply is the media companies' promise not to sue if any copyrighted material sneaks past their best efforts to block it. 
"Today's announcement marks a significant step in transforming the Internet from a Wild West to a popu­lar medium that respects the rule of law," NBC Universal president and chief executive Jeff Zucker said in a statement.

One trustee asked Brown, a political science and peace studies major, whether she was able to use any skills learned in the classroom dur­ing the negotiations. 
Brown said she had, adding that she had at one point called the professor of her conflict resolution class to say she was involved in a simula­tion from his class.

Maris Braun described one proposal student government made that is included in the finalized ordinance. The ordi­nance called for the establish­ment of a Community/Campus Advisory Coalition (CCAC). which will include students and administrators from Notre Dame, Saint Mary's, Holy Cross and Indiana University South Bend, as well as Common Council members, the mayor, land­lords and local residents. It will be responsible for help­ing the Common Council iden­tify neighborhood concerns related to local colleges, and it will propose solutions. 
The CCAC was modeled after a similar group estab­lished by the city of East Lansing, Mich., and Michigan State University, which Braun called a "benchmark of a peer institution that dealt with col­lege-town issues in an extremely proactive manner." 
When a trustee asked how the student government can hope to sustain interest in community relations as the student population changes. Braun responded that the presence of the student body president on the CCAC would help to ease the transition from year to year. 
Chief executive assistant Sheena Plamoottil told Board members about other student government initiatives in the area of community relations, such as the work of the Senate Community Relations Committee, the bus tour of South Bend held during fresh­man orientation weekend and the Campus Legal Aid Clinic held to instruct students mov­ing off campus on leasing obligations and good neighbor protocol. Student government is also in the process of approaching each academic department to ask them to offer a community-based class through which students would spend time in the com­munity as well as the class­room. 
"The more students are able to get into the community, the more they'll be interested in the community," Plamoottil said.

This year, the group has stepped up from its traditional method of recruiting volunteers to gut destroyed homes in the Big Easy, said senior Nick Albares, who is leading the trip this fall.

Since it is expensive to hire reputable contractors to pay for the homes to be rebuilt, Operation Helping Hands asked that the task force recruit stu­dents with higher skill levels to ­help with the rebuilding process. 
"When you gut a house, it doesn't take much as far as skills; you can just rip stuff out," Albares said. "Right now, Operation Helping Hands is looking for people experienced in things like plumbing and 
_ electricity to help out, so they imposed a quota of around 20 vplunteers." Regardless, any hands that can help move projects along will make a difference. Albares, like the other task force lead­ers, is hoping the participants will fall in love with the people and heritage of the sites they visit. 'Tm really looking forward to a great trip," he said. "We have a fantastic group of people ded­icated to the region, and I'm hoping that people can come away with a new sense of what's going on down there and it will awaken them to how social issues are playing out down there."

BOLIVIA 
Troops, residents fight over airport 
Associated Press 
SANTA CHUZ, Bolivia ­Soldiers fired tear gas at an1,try residents who tried to storm Bolivia's busiest airport Thursday as the facility became a focal point of an autonomy dispute betwP-en the federal gov­ernmp,nt and thfl country's wealthiest province. 
Several hundred residents of the city and province of Santa Cruz attempted to crash through the gates of the Viru Viru airport, which was seized earlier in the day by the military amid a dispute over landing fees. 
Waving green-and-white Santa Cruz flags and setting off fireworks, the protesters were repelled by vollp,ys or tp,ar gas fired by military policfl from behind the airport's gates. Small grass fires burned, apparently set on· by the fireworks or hot tear gas canisters. 
"The airport belongs to Santa Cruz!" some 300 to 400 protest­ers shouted. Some said the gov­ernment rnbull"cd their attempts to open negotiations on return­ing control of the airport to the state, and vowed to maintain a vigil at the gate Thursday night. · 
Motorists were stranded in a traflic jam that extended at least 2 miles (3 kilometers) on the approach to the airport. The gatm; were sealed and guarded by about 150 soldiers. An opera­tor who answered the airport's 1:ustomer Sflrvice line said there had bmm no flight cancellations. 
About 220 air force troops and military police stormed Viru Viru before Thursday after air­port workers detained an American Airlines plane on the runway, demanding the carrier pay them landing fees in cash. The plane was bound for Miami on Tuesday with 140 passengers aboard. 
The workers were demanding the airline pay landing fees of up to $2,000 in cash locally, rather than deposit the fees with the fp,deral airport authority. 
In the military raid, one sol­dier was wounded by gunfire and another was treated for cuts, officials said. There were no immediate rP-ports of more injuries when protesters tried to retake the airport, but an AP reporter saw eight ambulances driving toward the airport. 
The airport conflict took on broader political implications because Santa Cruz, the nation's largest province, has chafed under the government of leftist President Evo Morales as it moves to nationalize industries and redistribute land and wealth to the country's poor majority. 
The airport "has been stolen by the government using army troops," said Omar Mustafa, one of the Santa Cruz protesters. 
Santa Cruz is home to soy plantations and cattle ranches and the provinces relatively wealthy residents feel targeted by government plans to seize land judged idle or fraudulently obtained for redistribution. 
Santa Cruz is also the center of Bolivia's energy industry, and some worry about foreign investment now that Morales has forced international gas companies to increase royalty payments. Its leaders want autonomy and a bigger share of their state's natural gas rev­enues, but Morales needs the cash for desperatP-ly poor high­land states. 
Viru Viru "will remain milita­rized until the government is certain there will be no more disturbances," said Javier Garcia, the head of civil avia­tion. 
On Wednesday, American, a unit of Dallas-based AMR Corp., and Brazil's Go! Linhas Aereas Intcligentes SA temporarily sus­pended service to Bolivia due to the conflict at Vrru Viru. 
Quinn said the government was calling on Viru Viru work­ers, who number about 100, to return to their jobs. But, he said, the airport will be run by the federal government for about 90 days while the local airport agency is audited.

Hiker found after 4-day search 
Autistic youth returned to family hungry, fatigued, unharmed 
Associated Press 
CHARLESTON, W.Va. -An autistic 18-year-old lost in the wilderness for four days was found alive Thursday, weak but apparently fine, and reunited with his family, searchers said. 
"To the best of our knowl­edge, he was just hungry and thirsty and fatigued," Jim Reneau, one of the nine searchers who found Jacob Allen, said at a news confer­ence at the command post near Davis, about 90 miles south of Pittsburgh. 
Allen, who wandered away from his parents while hiking Sunday, was found lying in a clearing about a mile from where his hat was found Monday. 
Allen, who has the mental capacity of a 3-or 4-year-old, opened his eyes and rolled over to meet his rescuers when Reneau's son, Jeremy 
Reneau, called out his name. 
"He was very quiet, he was 
nonverbal," said Jeremy 
Reneau, 25, the first to spot 
Allen. "But you could tell by 
his body language he was 
hungry." 
Rescuers fed him candy 
bars and peanut butter sand­
wiches and tried to walk him 
out of the wooded Dolly Sods 
Wilderness Area, part of the 
Monongahela National 
Forest. When he became too 
tired, they carried him out on 
a litter, Reneau said. 
"The family is all togeth­
er," "search group spokesman 
Chris Stadelman said. "As 
soon as they heard the report 
he was alive and doing fairly 
well, they gathered in a 
prayer circle." 
The Inter-Mountain news­
paper reported that Allen 
was taken to Davis Memorial 
Hospital, but a spokeswoman ·for the hospital declined to comment. "I think the whole state's 
relieved," said Lara Ramsburg, spokeswoman for Gov. Joe Manchin, who visit­ed the Allen family Wednesday night. "We're all relieved for him and his fami­ly." 
Allen wandered away from his parents Sunday after­noon. Hundreds of volunteers and trained professionals had been combing the woods, calling for him to come to them for candy bars, ice cream and other food. 
Allen had no food or water with him, but Stadelman had said there were natural water sources in the search area, which consists of about 10 square miles of often steep and brush-covered ter­rain. 
Overnight temperatures dropped to as low as 38 degrees on the nights Allen was missing. He was wearing hiking boots, a long-sleeved T-shirt, a wind jacket and wind pants.

Dalai Lama receives award from U.S., angers China 
Country says distinction undernlines supportive relations, urges action 

should make. 

China pulled out of' a plamwd strategy session the U.S. had arranged on Iran Wednesday, citing "technieal reasons," but said the countries involved would discuss setting another meeting date. 
Despite the bluster, Beijing is unlikely to take actions that would jeopardize relations with the U.S., its largest trading part­ner, and increasingly a diplomat­ic one, experts said. 
"I think there will be meetings postponed or canceled," said Joseph Fewsmith, a Chinese pol­itics expert and professor at Boston University. But "I don't think that China wants to throw the whole relationship into dilli­culty beeause of this partkular meeting." 
Besides tho aeeess to the valu­able Anwriean market. China is also counting on the Bush administration to rein in Taiwan, whieh Beijing considers a rene­gade provi nco. Taiwan's demo­eratie government has taken steps toward f'ormalizing tho de facto indnpendence it has enjoyed since splitting f'rom China 5R ynars ago -movos that Beijing has said could bring war.

closely on North Korea. their positions are further apart in pressuring Iran over its nudear program and Myanmar for crushing a dfnnocraey move­ment. Friction also persists over trade and Taiwan. 
The decision by Washington to honor the Dalai Lama is a set­back to Beijing's efforts to lond legitimacy to China's often harsh rule over Tibet and undermine support for the spiritual leader, who remains popular among Tibetans despite fleeing into exile 48 years ago after a failed uprising. 
Thousands of Tibetan exiles celebratnd the award Thursday in Dharmsala, the Indian town when~ the Dalai Lama set up his government in exile. Tibetan flags, which are banned in Chinese-controlled Tibet, flew from buildings. Shops and schools were closed. and the exiles had a daylong picnic with dance performances at the Dalai Lama's Tsuglakhang tomple. 
"This a ward doesn't just honor the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people but all the peace-loving people in the world," said Dawa Tsering, a parliamentarian in the govornment in exile. 
Liu, the Chinese spokesman, said Washington's actions encouraged Tibetan separatists, and demanded it take eorn~ctive aetion. 
"China urges the United States to take effective mnasures immediately to remove the terri­ble impact of its erroneous act, cease supporting and conniving with the separatist activities of th!~ Tihnt independnnee forces ... and take concrete stops to pro­teet China-U.S. relations," Liu said.

"I'm tin~d of snning our children din," the chief said. "We as adult<> havn a responsibility to our chil­drnn to allow them to grow up as adult<> in a safi1 environment, and we're failing tlwm." 
Pandora Eppinger said her nince, 9-year-old Alexus Eppinger, and nephew, 5-year-old Terrence Eppinger Jr., were killed. 

"It's scary out here. You can't go out anywhere and feel safe," Eppingnr said. 
"They were just little, sweet kids," she said. "Why would they do that?" 
The ehildnm 's mother, Lynnette Lawson, 2S, and Jason Davis, 34, also dind, according to the Wayne County medical examiner's ollice and relatives who gathered in the morning rain near the home. The boy died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen, and the others were shot multiple times at close range, according to the medical examiner's ollice. 
Georgia Davis. 53, said her son, Jason, had bnen dating Lawson recently. 
"Why would someone kill those kids?" she said. "They're crazy." 
Bully-Cummings, speaking to rnport!~rs on the street just hours aftnr the shootings, reiterated a plea for Detroiters to take respon­sibility li1r the community, one she has made repnatedly since taking the job in 2003. 
In 2004, she and other oflkials joined a coalition of ministers in prayer as they called on residents to join them in ending a eulture of violence in the city. But the killings have continued. 
The four were killed a day after a man and woman were eonvict­ed of murdering two boys who were shot in a ransacked Detroit apartment in February. Authorities say they planned to kidnap the boys' cousin and rob him of cocaine and cash.

City denies man 
died from 9/11 dust 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -The city med­ical examiner has ruled that the death of a retired police detec­tive -seen as one of the strongest cases to be linked to post-Sept. 11 illness -was not caused by exposure to toxic dust while working at ground zero. 
that the foreign material in your son's lungs did not get there as the result of inhaling dust at the World Trade Center or else­where," said the letter, dated Tuesday and signed by Chief Medical Examiner Hirsch and Medical Examiner Michele Slone. 
The letter did not elaborate. Hirsch spokeswoman Ellen 
Dr. Charles Hirsch rejected a New Jersey med­ical examiner's rul­ing that 34-year­old James Zadroga's death was "directly relat­ed" to his work cleaning up the World Trade Center site. That ruling found that Zadroga died in January 2006 of sarcoidosis, a lung­scarring disease that deposits dan­gerous growths in the lungs. 
After reviewing 
"It is our unequivocal opinion, with certainty beyond doubt, that the foreign material in your son's lungs did not get there as a result of inhaling dust at the World Trade Center or elsewhere." 
Dr. Charles Hirsch Chief Medical Examiner

the autopsy report, Zadroga's medical records and slides of the detective's lung tissue, Ilirsch concluded that the detective's death was not caused by expo­sure to dust, according to a letter addressed to Zadroga's family and obtained by The Associated Press. 
"It is our unequivocal opinion, with certainty beyond doubt, they be so callous?" Joseph Zadroga said. He said his son developed a cough in the first weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks while logging hundreds of hours cleaning up the toxic site. 
"He had the acid reflux. He had short-term memory loss.... He was on strong medications for the pain in his lungs," Zadroga said. 
Construction deaths soar in NYC 
87 percent rise not consistent with 3 percent national average 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Sucha Ram was getting ready to tar the roof of a building in the Bronx last year when he fell over the side, plunging 15 feet to his death. He was not wearing any fall­protection gear and had never received formal training in fall hazards, a report said. 
Ram was a 52-year-old immi­
grant from India, the sole breadwinner of the family ­and part of a long line of casualties of New York City's roaring con­struction indus­try in 2006. 
Forty-three people died while working construction in New York in 2006, the dead­liest year in at least a decade 
bureau said. The Miami area had 34 deaths, compared with 26 in the previous year. 
Construction is the most dan­gerous work nationally, accounting for 1,226 fatalities in 2006, or 21 percent of the 5,703 workplace deaths overall, according to the bureau. 
New York construction work­ers and safety experts point to the city's unprecedented build­
"The city government doesn't have a lot of people who can speak the language or that can offer the appropriate training." 
Oscar Paredes executive director Latin American Workers 
Project 
in the city, according to recently released data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The death toll was up 87 percent from 2005, when 23 people died. Nationally, construction deaths in 2006 rose just 3 per­cent. 
The rise in New York vastly exceeds what happened in other big cities. The Los Angeles area recorded 33 deaths in 2006, versus 35 in 2005, the ing boom as a rea­son for the jump . Scaffolds cover the facades of thousands of build­i n g s . M a j or develop­ments are going up in every borough. Apartment buildings and high­
rise condos are being built at a frenetic pace. 
"It spiked because the work spiked," said Dennis Holloway, director of the John B. Scola Training Center in Queens, which trains union bricklayers and other construction workers. 
Compounding the problem: The city has seen a big influx of immigrants at the same time as the construction boom. That means more immigrant con­struction workers who don't speak English and may not comprehend safety warnings. 
Oscar Paredes, executive director of the Latin American Workers Project, said outreach and training by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and city agen­cies are ineffective because of the language barrier. 
'The city government doesn't have a lot of people who speak the language or that can offer the appropriate training," he said. 
Moreover, Paredes said some workers ignore safety precau­tions, sometimes because they are apathetic, sometimes because they are afraid to lose their job if they refuse to per­form a dangerous task, such as scaling heights with no harness­es or guardrails. 
"If you don't go up, you lose the work," he said. 
The government does not break down workplace deaths by immigration status, so it is difficult to know how many involve illegal immigrants. 
But a review of federal data from 1997 to 2006 illustrates some powerful trends In that period, there was a more than 260 percent increase in con­struction deaths in the city involving Hispanics, the largest and one of the fastest-growing immigrant groups in New York. Six Hispanics died in 1997 working construction, 22 in 2006.

Studnnt body pn1sident Liz Brown and vice pmsident Maris B.raun said Tuesday they are considering a push for student govnrnmnnt support of the I> BEAM Act, a bill now pending in the Unitnd Statns Senate. 
The DHEAM Act would provide a pathway to legal immigra­tion status for immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally before they were 16 years old, have graduated from high school and commit two years to college education or military service. 
Individual members of student government are right to have interest in issues that extend far bnyond the sternotypi­
cal studnnt concerns of grade point averages, social lives and career trajectorins. And the DHEAM Act is good lngislation. 
But a student government resolution intend­ed -at lnast symbolically -to influence the United Statns Senate is far out of line with the mission of student government and d<)mon­strates why so many students are apathetic toward student govnrnment. 
Even worSl\ Brown's administration has no reported plans to tnst studnnt opinion before stating the support of student gowrnnwnt for this important but controversial national bill. 
"As much as I'm all for nstablishing consfmsus," Braun said. "wn might just have to do thn best thing and the right thing. Ijust worry wn're going to run out of time." 
Such lighthnartnd commitment to measuring and respm:ting student opinion would be an arrogant move.

international significance. Such a precedent would threaten the quality of services provided by student government, which already operates within the constraints imposed by tlw full-time academic obligations of its mmnbers. 
Perhaps the wisest eomrnent delivernd at tho COH meoting came from chief exeeutivo assistant Sheena Plamoottil, who noted that student government can provide students with resources for learning about and exprnssing support for the bill without committing itself to a total show of support for the legislation. 
Still, student government is elected to provide leadership on 
issues of importancn and relevance to the student

What do you get when you cross a New Orleans-bred saxophonist with a group of versatile Michiana musicians that includes a drummer named "Krojo"? 
Shaken Cajun-style, not stirred, these ingredients get you Half-Pint Jones, a genre-defying, South Bend­based, jazz-reggae-funk-with-a-twist ensemble that arrives today at Legends. 
Half-Pint Jones comes to the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's communities with a somewhat mythic story behind it. 
The band's founding member, Chris Olivier, grew up in New Orleans, La., a proud member of the city's well­known musical culture. Like much of the N'awlins musician community, however, Olivier, a saxophonist, found himself and his family displaced by the effects of Hurricane Katrina. Surprisingly, he wound up in -you probably guessed it -South Bend, Indiana. 
In time, Olivier found other like­minded musicians in the area to jam with, eventually resulting in the eclec­tic group that they are today. Several of the musicians have played with each other previously in different con­texts, but Half-Pint Jones is the final result. 
The band consists of Olivier, Steve Krojniewski (a.k.a. "Krojo") on drums, Jayson Sites on bass, guitarist and vocalist Justin Ross and trumpet player Mark Gamble. The mix of musicians has helped Half-Pint Jones develop its unique music-undefined by any particular genre, the band has created a combination of jazz, funk and other types to create a sound that, to the band, is also reminiscent of their musical heritage. 
-

"We're like a traditional bebop band from the '50s and '60s," Olivier said in a recent interview with Lakeview Magazine. "There are so many New Orleans elements but also a rock ele­ment and East Coast jazz. It's a fusion of all these different styles, and I real­ly feel it's a fresh, new sound." The band released their first album, "Trilogy of Patches and Olaf," this past summer, which exhibits their penchant for mixing up musical con­ventions as well as their varied indi­vidual talents. "From the beginning, my concept was [that] I wanted everybody to play what they're feeling," Olivier told Lakeview Magazine. "If you're playing true to yourself, then people will know that." As effortless as it may seem on "Trilogy of Patches and Olaf' for the band members to play off of each other's strengths, it can't be done without effort and care for the music itself. "It's a musical language, and just like any language, you have to become fluent in it. It takes hours and hours of practice, for days and days and years on end," Olivier said in an interview with IN-Michiana magazine. "It's not only ability, it's a natural drive. That [music] is what you do, and you're not happy without it." Legends will offer a small, more intimate venue for the band. The concert begins at 7 tonight, a tough time slot for a football week­end. But given the skills and strengths of this jazz-rock-funk-with-a-twist group of musicians, Half-Pint Jones should definitely tear down the house anyway. Make sure to check your expecta­tions at the door.  --

NEW YOHK-Joe Torre is out as manager of the New York Yankees, reject­ing a substantial pay cut after the team failed to make it past the first round of the playoffs for the third straight year. 
Torre turned down a $5 million, one-year contract Thursday-$2.5 million less than he made last season. 
Hather than put up with the indignity of a salary slap coupled with a per­formance-based contract. the man who led the Yankees to playoff appearances in all 12 years he managed walked. 
"A difficult day," general manager Brian Cashman said. 
Bench coach Don Mattingly is the leading contender to replace Torre, who won four World Series champi­onships with the Yanks but none since 2000. Yankees broadcaster Joe Girardi, the NL Manager of the Year with Florida in 2006, is another top con­tender. Tony La Bussa and Bobby Valentine also could be considered. 
Most Yankees fans could see this day coming. 
After losing the first two playoff games to Cleveland, owner George 
IN BRIEF 

Open-wheelers follow 
Montoya to NASCAR 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -Juan Pablo Montoya never meant for his move from Formula One to NASCAH to be the one that made devout open­wheelers accepting of stock cars. But in the 15 months since he made the switch, the list of followers has grown. 
Now Montoya has a warning for those considering NASCAR: It's a lot harder than it looks. 
"This is not easy," Montoya said. "I think the person who thinks that it is easy should look again, because I think this is pretty hard. And now, with the full fields, even getting into the race is very, very hard." 
Montoya has paid attention to the plight of Sam Harnish, who is debat­ing whether or not to leave the IndyCar Series for NASCAR. A three­time series champion and Indianapolis 500 winner, Hornish has accomplished everything he set out to do in open-wheel and is crav­ing a new challenge. 
Steinbrenner said he did­n't think Torre would be asked back if the Yankees didn't advance. 
The 67-year-old Torre, who took over the team to start the 1996 season, made his decision after traveling from New York to the team's spring train­ing complex in Tampa, Fla., and meeting with Steinbrenner, the owner's sons and top executives for about an hour. He was accompanied by Cashman and chief operating officer Lonn Trost. 
New York's offer inelud­ed $3 million in bonuses if the Yankees reached next year's World Series and an $8 million option for 

2009 that would have become guaranteed if New York won the AL pennant. 
Torre just completed a $19.2 million, three-year contract. The Chicago Cubs' Lou Piniella was the second-highest paid man­ager at $3.5 million. 
"Under this offer, he would continue to be the highest-paid manager in major league baseball," team president Randy Levine said. "We thought ­that we need to go to a performance-based model, having nothing to do with Joe Torre's char­acter, integrity or ability. We just think it's impor­tant to motivate people." 
Patriots to be given names 
of StubHub users 
BOSTON -The New England Patriots have won a bid to get the names of all the fans who bought or sold -or tried to buy or sell-tick­ets to home games through online ticket reseller StubHub Inc., a move one technology group sees as an invasion of privacy. 
In a lawsuit against San Francisco­based StubHub, a subsidiary of eBay Inc., claiming that the Web site encourages fans to break state law and violate team policies, The Patriots said they could seek to revoke season tickets of people who use StubHub. 
A lawyer for the Patriots wouldn't say what the team plans to do with the 13,000 names, which StubHub gave it last week after losing its appeal of a Massachusetts state court ruling. 
Team rules bar reselling game tickets for a profit. State law, though rarely enforced, restricts ticket markups to $2 above face value plus some service charges. 
Johnson will start practice
with Cowboys today 
IRVING, Texas -Suspended defensive tackle Tank Johnson will be allowed to practice starting Friday, which will be his first team ­session with the Dallas Cowboys since they signed him last month. 
Johnson still has two gam!:_ls left on his eight-game NFL suspension for violating probation on a gun charge. Unless the suspension is reduced by commissioner Roger Goodell, Johnson will be eligible to play when the Cowboys play at the New York Giants on Nov. 11. 
"It will be good to get him out on the field and get him in the meeting room too," Cowboys coach Wade Phillips said. "Alii know is he's going to practice. I don't know when he's going to be able to play, or when he'll be able to play." 
Johnson, who was released by the Chicago Bears after his suspension, signed with the Cowboys last month.

Federer beats Canas after two straight losses 
Straight-set win puts Federer in quarterfinals 
Associated Press 
MADRID, Spain -Hoger Federer finally got a win against Guillermo Canas, beating the 14th-ranked Argentine 6-0, 6-3 Thursday to reach the quarterfinals of the Madrid Masters. 
Canas, who beat Federer in 
consecutive tournaments in 
March, was broken at love in 
the second game. Two more 
breaks of serve gave Federer 
the first set in 21 minutes. 
"I played aggressively, took my chances and felt in con­trol," Federer said. "It was nice to beat him, that's for sure." 
Canas held serve for 1-1 in the second set. But Federer, the defending champion, abandoned the ground­strokes and carne to the net. He scored 14 of his 1 7 over­all winners at the net in the second set. 
Federer, who won 32 of his 41 service points, broke Canas again in the sixth game before holding serve for the rest of the way. lie beat Canas for the first time since 2005, improving to 2-3 against him in his career. 
Second-ranked Rafael Nadal edged Andy Murray 7­6 (5), 6-4 in a match marked by long rallies from the base­line. 
Nadal looked to take con­trol of the first set with a break in the 11th game, but Murray broke back to send it to a tiebreaker where the Spaniard converted his sec­ond set point, spinning a forehand down the line. 
"It was a great game from start to finish and winning that first set was important ... with this surface favoring Andy's game," Nadal said. 
Murray immediately broke to open second set, using a backhand to take the lead after Nadal recovered from 15-40 back to deuce. 
Nadal needed four tries, 
but broke back to even the 
set at 4-4. Looking to repeat 
his 2005 title, Nadal held 
with a light touch at the net 
before clinching it with a 
final break in the 1Oth to 
earn a quarterfinal match 
against David Nalbandian, 
who beat Juan Martin Del 
Potro 6-2, 6-4. 
"It was an unbelievably close match," Murray said. "I probably should have won the second set ... I had a lot of chances and didn't take them. lie's a little bit more experienced than me and he took the points better." 
Federer next will play Feliciano Lopez after the Spanish wild card beat Austrian qualifier Stefan Koubek 7-6 (9), 6-1. 
Canas defeated the top­ranked player in earlier in the year at Indian Wells and Miami but the indoor surface favored Federer. 
"I was especially disap­pointed with the Miami loss, so to beat him later in the year after two tough losses is nice," Federer said. "I think the surface was much slower in Indian Wells and Miami. And I didn't know his game so well then." 
Earlier, fifth-seeded Fernando Gonzalez of Chile defeated Juan Monaeo of Argentina 6-4, 6-2 to set up a quarterfinal match with Nicolas Kiefer of Germany, who beat Ivo Karlovic 7-(> 
(5). 7-6 (3). 
Third-ranked Novak Djokovie beat Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain 6-3, 2-6. 6­4 to advance to the quarter­finals. Djokovic will play Mario Ancic, who beat Paul­Henri Mathieu of France 6-4, 6-3. 
"I haven't played so far on the level that I can, but the most important thing is that I won," Djokovic said. 
Ferrero's last title was the 2003 Madrid Masters, a stretch of 88 tournaments.

llergns has pitched in four of the Hoekies' seven playoff games. giving up just one hit in :{ 2-3 innings. lie earned the win in lhn dinrlwr over Arizona in thn NL championship sories. 
Not bad for someone who had to beg the Hockins for an invita­tion to spring training. He's still puzzled over why no team want­ed to give him a shot. lie was coming off a 2006 campaign with Florida in whieh he was 2­3 with a 4.31 EHA. 
"I had an OK year, not great

-
by any means, but not horrible," llerges said. "I think that should be enough to get a job with somebody and it wasn't." Berges felt like the train with the square wheels on the Island of Misfit Toys in "Hudolph, the Hed-Nosed Heindeer," the long­running Christmas television special. That would make I Iawkins the cowboy riding the ostrich. They were there on the island along with the squirt gun that squirted jelly. thn polka dot elephant and the Charlie-in-the-Box, and nobody likes a Charlie-in-the­box, remember? "That's a good analogy. That's how I felt." Herges said with a laugh. "I felt like I was on that island and didn't know why." 
llerges was especially stumped why a guy like I lawkins was there with him. 
"He's been a premier setup guy his whole career. I'm trying to eke by," Herges said. "He's on the next level in terms of talent. When he was a free agent, there were 15 to 20 teams calling him. When I was a free agent, no one was calling me." 
Hawkins was corning off a 
4.48 EHA in Baltimore, his fourth stop in three seasons. 
He diligently did his home­work before signing with Colorado last December. He wanted to be on an up-and­corning team that played out­standing defensn. 
I le succeeded on both counts. 
In Colorado he pitched in front of a defense like no other he had ever seen -nobody had, in fad. The Hockies had the high­est fielding percentagfl in major lfmgue history this season. 
"A lot of people were like, 'You don't want to sign there. You sure you want to pitch in that thin air and that altitude?'" Ilawkins said. "I told them if I go out there and just be LaTroy Hawkins. it won't be a problem. I'm always up for a challenge." 
So far in the playo!Ts, Hawkins has been terrific, throwing three scoreless innings. 
"Me and Matt-we're alike," said Hawkins, who has 75 
career saves, including 28 in 
2001 with Minnesota. "We've 
been given a second chance." 
The fact Herges had to earn his spot in the Rockies bullpen is nothing new. He has taken the difficult road his entire career. lie spent eight years in the minors before receiving his major league opportunity with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1999. 
So he didn't mind having to prove himself again with the Rockies, who brought him to spring training as a non-roster invitee. He began the season at Triple-A Colorado Springs and was called up on July 3, then went 5-1 with a 2.96 ERA with the Hackies this season. 
Herges closed out the regular season with nine scoreless innings, spanning five games, cementing his role as the Hockies' top middle reliever. 
"Every year I've had to prove myself so I didn't get released," he said. "That's all I know ­when I get an opportunity I try to impress." 
Pitching coach Bob Apodaca was more impressed with Berges' mental makeup than his physical attributes. Any player who can handle being sent back down to the minors at 37 to prove his worth and responds like Berges did is all right in Apodaca's book.

MLB 
Red Sox stay alive with 7-1 win over Indians 
-

Associated Press 
CLEVELAND -He blocked out everything: the screaming crowd, Kenny Lofton's chirping, even his ex-girlfriend singing only a few feet away. 
Josh Beckett, standing tall as ever on the mound, rose above it all -October's biggest star. 
Beckett dominat1HI the Cleveland Indians for the sec­ond time and Manny Hamirez drove in the go-ahead run with a 390-foot single as the Boston Hed Sox stayed alive in the AL championship series with a 7-1 win Thursday night in Game 5. 
Back to Fehway Park they go. Just the Hod Sox being the Bed Sox. They have plenty of prac­tice at these postseason come­backs. 
"We weren't trying to win three games in one night," Kevin Youkilis said. "We were just going out there and fight and do whatever we had to do to win." 
Youkilis set the tone with a first-inning homer off C.C. Sabathia as Boston shipped the best-of-seven series back to the heart of Hed Sox Nation to con­tinue a season nearly canned for the cold New England win­ter. 
Clearly, Hamirez & Co. cared. "We made it happen," Ramirez said. 
In 2004, Boston rallied from an 0-3 deficit to win the 2004 ALCS against the New York Yankees and went on to sweep the St. Louis Cardinals in four strai-ght for its first World Series title since 1918. 
The Hed Sox forced Game 6 on Saturday night, and will turn to Curt Schilling, 9-3 in 17 career postseason starts, against Fausto Carmona. 
Boston still trails 3-2, but if not for Beckett, the calm, cool and cocky 20-game winner, their would be no more base­ball until spring. 
"Josh is unbelievable," Youkilis said. "This year has been unbelievable for him and we hope he wins the Cy Young. He's shown here in the playoffs why he should." 
In the late innings, drummer John Adams, whose tom-tom beat has pulsated through a special season at Jacobs Field, slumped against his instrument as the Hed Sox tacked on runs. 
Meanwhile, in the Boston bullpen, two relievers used water bottles to playfully bang on backup catcher Doug Mirabelli's shinguards. 
The 27 -year-old Beckett, who beat Cleveland in the opener, once again came through with the stakes at their highest. 
The right-hander allowed only a run and three hits in the first, and only five total hits in eight innings. He struck out 11, walked one and was around the plate with almost every one of his 109 pitches. 
"He's got something others don't have," third baseman Mike Lowell said. "There is a different feel for us when he takes the mound. Time and time again he comes through."

carves his name deeper among the postseason pitching elite, is no stranger to comebacks. 
In 2003, he pitched a two-hit­ter for Florida in Game 5 of the NLCS as the Marlins rallied from a 3-1 deficit to eliminate the Chicago Cubs. Then, pitch­ing on just three days' rest in Game 6 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium, he allowed five hits in a 2-0 win and was picked as MVP. 
If the Red Sox can win two 
-

more, he might have another trophy for his mantle. "We know we have to do now," said Beckett, 3-0 with a 
1.17 ERA this October. "This is not where we want to be, but obviously, we're inching closer to where we want to be." 
The Indians missed a chance to advance to the World Series for the first time since 1997, and will have to find a way to avoid being the latest Cleveland team to come close but not win it all. 
Cleveland, which hasn't won the Series since 1948, had won three straight to seemingly take control. But the Indians, trying to clinch a pennant at home for the first time, could do little against Beckett, who rarely shook off a sign from Varitek and kept hitters guessing with a rocket fastball and knee­buckling curve. 
"He's the best," David Ortiz said. "We were confident with him going out there. He was unbelievable. It was one of the best pitching performances I've seen." 
The Indians fell apart at the seams. 
Even their rock-solid bullpen cracked for the first time. Boston added three runs in the eighth on three walks, a throw­ing error by reliever Hafael Perez, a passed ball and a sac­rifice fly. 
"Beating Boston four in a row is tough to do," Indians manag­er Eric Wedge said. 
With so much on the line, both teams were on edge and tempers flared briefly in the fifth when Beckett and Lofton screamed at each other. 
Cleveland's outfielder had flipped his bat to the ground after what he thought was ball four, and when Beckett retired him on a fly, the pair exchanged words and both benches and bullpens emptied. 
The two got into a similar argument two years ago, when Lofton was with Philadelphia and Beckett with Florida. 
"It goes back a way," Beckett said. "Those things have a way of working themselves out." 
No punches were thrown, and if Lofton was trying to rat­tle Beckett, he didn't. 
"He doesn't like it when I take my bat and flip it," Lofton ­said. "He's the only pitcher who's had a problem with it. He was saying stuff I didn't like, and I said something back." 
Beckett then struck out Franklin Gutierrez looking before Casey Blake singled and went to thirg when Grady ­Sizemore's single. But Beckett fanned Asdrubal Cabrera on three pitches, and the rookie smacked his bat on the plate in disgust. 
For Sabathia, the Indians' ace and leader, it was more disappointment. He allowed four runs and 10 hits in six­plus innings, his third straight sub-par performance this month.

NFL 
Bears balance roles given to versatile Hester 
-
Associated Press 
LAKE FOHEST, Ill. -Devin I lester took oil', and in a flash he was in the end zone. 
Anotlwr breathtaking return? Not this time. 
-
Instead. it was a game-tying Sl-yard touchdown reception with less than two minutes left against the Minnesota Vikings last week. just the sort of boost the Chicago Bears envisioned him giving the offense. And it 
was just the sort of spark he rngularly provides on special teams. 
"We're all thinking, 'Oh, let's put him on oiTensn a little morn. Oh, wait a minute, we don't want to lose him on special teams,"' guard Huben Brown said. 
It's easy to see why the Bears are conllictnd. 
llnstnr already has a league­high thren touchdown returns after setting an NFL record with six last season. And against the Vikings, he provided a tantaliz­ing tasto of what could come on oll'onse. 
The Bears were within 31-24 after Muhsin Muhammad caught a :B-yard touchdown pass with 
2:36 rnmaining. The defense lwld after the Vikings recovernd an onside kick, and Chicago took over at the 19 with I :53 t.o go. 
!lester made a nice move to gd by Dwight Smith, caught the hall at the 35 and raend along t.hn right sidnlirw to eompletn the first touchdown rnception of his career. That tied it at :n and elicited a deafening roar from the crowd. 
The good feelings nroded when the Vikings' Hyan Longwell endnd the game with a 55-yard field goal, handing the Bears (2-4) their most disap­pointing regular-season loss in years. On a day when the defnnse surrendered 444 yards and got run over by Adrian Peterson, Chicago still had a chancn to win because of Hester's heroics. 
Besides the tying reception, there was an 89-yard punt return for a touchdown. On that one, Hester made an over-the­shoulder-catch along the side­line, reversed toward the middle to pick up his blockers and then went to work. lie split two deffmders, pulled away from one lunging for his ankle and avoid­ed another on his way to the end zone. 
In other words, it was a typical Hester return. The touchdown reception was a new twist. 
Hester became the third NFL player and second Bear to return a punt 80 or more yards for a touchdown and catch an 80-plus yard scoring pass in the same game, joining Gale Sayers and the St. Louis Hams' Az-Zahir Hakim. 
"Tiw morn opportunities you get, the morn chances you get to make a play," Hester said. "That's the way I look at it." 
lin had a different view as a rookie last year. llestnr had bounced from posi­tion to position at the University 
of Miami and was reluctant to move to oll'ense, even though the Bears drafted him thinking he could contributfl on either side of the ball. He played mostly on special teams, occasionally iri the secondary, but never on the other side. Coach Lovie Smith broached the subject early on, and it became a full-fledged sales pitch after the season. 
Hester finally gave in just before offseason workouts, and the Bears have been slowly working him into the rotation. The transition to offense is not easy because receivers have to run precise routes and can't simply rely on speed, although the Bears have kept it simple for him. 
"In fairness to him, not giving him too much to start with ... worked well," quarterback Brian Griese said. "lie's shown that he can handle a lot of it." 
Hester had been used mainly as a decoy on offense the first live games, with just one 3-yard reception. Even so, defenses had to pay attention. 
"People have to respect his speed and the playmaking abili­ty that he has," Muhammad said. "I don't think people have seen some of the best things he can do, but obviously, when he's on t.h.e .n;;Id, they know where No. 23 rs. 
For the Bears, it's a delicate balance. If they use Hester too much on offense, that could limit his play on special teams. Worse, what if he gets injured? 
The NFC special teams player of the month in September, Hester leads the league with seven punt returns for 20 or more yards. Against the Vikings, he had four for 108 yards and ran back four kickoiTs for 86. ­


Teams are paying a heavy price when they put the ball in his hands and are sacrificing field position when they don't. That's not a bad strategy consid­ering the Bears' o!Tense is 28th in the league at 287.7 yards per game. 
"I kind of figure Devin's good for seven points nvery timn he steps on the f'ield, maybe 14," Brown said. "So you pick your poison: Which way do you want to usn him? Do you want to get your seven or 14 on offense? Do you want to get your seven or 14 on spndal tnams? Or do you split it in hatr?"

Hay Hice provided a more con­ventional 181 yards on 39 car­ries for Rutgers (5-2, 2-1 Big East) and Mike Tee! threw two touchdown passes to Tiquan Underwood.  
"We just went out there and played our best football," Hice said. 
South Florida became the 

third No. 2 team to lose in the 
last three weeks. 
"I thought we had a chip on our shoulders tonight," Bulls cornerback Trae Williams said. "That we would prove some­thing to the nation. That we are deserving of the ranking. Obviously, we didn't get it done tonight." 
The Bulls (6-1, 1-1) had their eight-game winning streak come to an end, no doubt to the delight of Boston College, LSU, Oklahoma and the rest of the teams hoping to grab the second spot in the BCS standings USF held this week. 
Matt Grothe threw for 247 yards and a touchdown and ran for 58 yards, but Hutgers' defense swarmed South Florida's multitalented quarter­back in the second half and sacked him seven times in the game. 
A week after No. 2 California lost to Oregon State and two weeks after then-No. 2 Southern California was upset by Stanford, the Bulls became the 11th Top 10 team to fall to an unranked opponent this season. There are five undefeated teams left in major coi!Pge football. 
"PP.rsonally, rankings don't mean that much when you're on the field," Bulls mceiver Mareus Edwards said. "All that stuff goes out the window. It comes down to who scores the most points and they scored more than we did tonight." 
Hutgers, which started the season ranked 16th but fell out after two straight losses last month. might not be unrankP.d much longer. 
Jeremy Ito lined a career-long 51 yard field with 11 :59 left in the fourth quarter to give Hutgnrs a 30-20 !Pad. 
Grothe's gang wasn't done. lie led the Bulls on a 70-yard tow~h­down drive that Mike Ford capped with a 1-yard run with 
9:16 left to make it 30-27. 
When USF linebacker Ben Moffitt recovered Rice's fumble near midfield with 4:11 left, the Bulls were in business at the Hutgers 40. But Brandon Henkart sacked Grothe on the first play, and the Bulls were forced to punt. 
"We had the ball at the 50, down by three and their defense came up to play," USF coach Jim Leavitt said. "Give them credit. Give them a lot of credit. They did it twice." 
Rutgers was unable to kill the dock and the Bulls got one more shot to keep their perfect season alive, starting at the Hutgers 49. 
On the first play, freshman Joe Lefeged came on a safety blitz and sacked Grothe from the blind side. On fourth-and-22, Amarri Jackson caught a pass down thf~ sideline bnyond tlw first down marknr, but the play was wipml out by an of'fnnsivn pass interference call becausp, the receiver pushed ofl'. 
The last gasp came on a fourth-and-37 from tlw Hutgers 
24. (;rothe heaved a desperation pass into tral'f'ic and HutgPrs defensive back Zaire Kitchen interceptPd. 
For thfl second straight sPason HutgPrs came up with a huge victory on a Thursday night at horne. Last yp,ar it was then-No. :{ LouisvillP., at thn timfl the high­nst ranked opponent Hutgers had P.ver beaten. 
Not anymore. This win set ofT another party on the f'ip,Jd, though not quitn as wild as last year's after beating Louisvilln. 
After reaching the rankings for first time in the 11-year history of South Florida football earlier this season. the Bulls shot up the charts bf~hind a quick and hard­hitting defense and Grothe's dynamic playmaking. 
In this topsy-turv~ season, the Bulls' national title hopes can't quite be put to rest. But they took a major hit. 
The Scarlet Knights, last sea­son's surprise tPam from the Big East, gave their sPason a much­neP.ded jolt. 
With Rutgers up 20-17 mid­way through the third quarter, Hutgers defensive back Devin McCourty blocked a field goal to preserve the lead.

Palmer apologizes for temper 
Johnson resents difference in reaction after 'Golden Boy's' outbursts 
Associated Press 
CINCINNATI -Carson Palmer is sorry. 
Sorry that he blew up at receiv­er Chad Johnson for running the wrong route. Sorry that he's lost his cool during thn Cincinnati Bnngals' awful start. Sorry that his easygoing temperament has failed him on the field. 
Not that anyone blames him. 

The Pro Bowl MVP has vented his anger in the last two games, something quite out of character for the laid-back quarterback from California. A 1-4 start will do that. 
"I think everybody's a little bit on edge around here," Palmer said. "We have boards in the ofTensive and defensive rooms, and every time you look up at thnm and see our produetion and our record there, you're just nat­urally on edge because you have such high expectations. 
"I have lost my cool a couple of times, and I apologize for that. I'll try to contain myself and be calm." 
Usually, Palmer is the club's voice of reason during tough times. When things go bad, he acknowledges the problems and accepts a bigger share of the blame than necessary. When tnammates squabble, he tries to restore the peace.

quarterback as they left the field for halftime. 
Palmer was visibly angry again Sunday when his last throw was intercepted during a 27-20 loss at Kansas City. Palmer tried to get the ball to Johnson in a crowd, but the receiver slowed at the end of the route, setting up the inter­ception. 
"New England -that was on me," Johnson said this week. "It's all on me. You can't blame him. He's the Golden Boy." 
That's Johnson's nickname for the 2002 Heisman Trophy win­ner, one that's more good-natured than it sounds. What bothers Johnson, though, is that their out­bursts are taken different ways these days. 
When Palmer gets angry, it's a

self with his 

touchdown cele­brations, his brash statements and his trash talking to opponents on the field. Sometimes, he'll be talking to an opposing player while his teammates are gath­ered on the field during a time­out. 
When coach Marvin Lewis lashed out at his players for being "selfish" following the loss to New England, everyone thought about Johnson even though the coach didn't single anyone out. Johnson thinks there's a double standard among fans and the media because no one has called.Palmer selfish for showing emotion. 
"He's just like me," Johnson said. "What if he throws a bad ball, and I do the same thing? 
NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
Sun1n1itt happy -with Vols tea111 chen1istry ­
Associated Press 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. Tennessee coach Pat Summitt knows talent will only get you so far in college basketball. 
She's had Lady Vols teams loaded with stars that haven't reached the NCAA Final Four. She's had teams with six and 10 losses win national cham­pionships. 
"Two years ago, we didn;t particularly like each other. we didn't play well together. we didn't get to a Final Four," Summitt said Thursday during Tennessee's media day. "Last year, we had great chemistry." 
The Lady Vols are coming off their seventh NCAA title. With Candace Parker and three other starters returning plus a top-notch freshman class, Summitt's team is about as talented as they get. 
That won't necessarily translate into another title. 
"You always worry about what happens after you've won a championship," Summitt said. "I've sat and watched this many times: car­rying the big national champi­onship on your back. Every possession, every game, every venue that we go to, it's going to be a challenge for them. 
"This is one of the hardest things to do in sports ... to repeat the performance of the national championship." 

In the 1998-99 season, 

Tennessee followed up three 
consecutive national titles 
with a disappointing finish, 
losing in the Elite Eight. That 
team boasted the superstar 
trio of Chamique Holdsclaw, 
Tamika Catchings and 
Semeka Handall. but players 
failed to step up in thai 
regional finals game when 
Holdsclaw went 2-of-18 from 
the floor in a loss to Duke. 
Basketball's winningest 

coach thinks this year's team 
is different. 
For one thing, the current 

squad's one national champi­
onship humbles in compari­
son to the three-peat. And 
rookies Kelley Cain, Angie 
Bjorklund, Sydney Smallbone 
and Vicki Baugh will be look­
ing for their own title. 
"What I see right now 

appears to be something 
that's going to be a special 
chemistry," Summitt said. 
"Can they live up to it? In my 
estimation we have the talent 
to do so." 
The first step in fighting any 

potential post-championship 
slump is to train hard in the 
offseason and practice hard in 
the preseason, Summit said. 
She also wants to see a com­
mitment from players to 
improve daily. 
Coach and players all said 

they've been pleased with the 
progress so far. 
"There's been no signs of 

slacking off or not working 
hard," Parker said. "This 
summer we had tremendous 
work ethic." 
Nicky Anosike said it takes 

being on the court in a game 
to really know whether a 
team's got the right chemistry. 
"It's too early to tell," she 

said. "I don't know who rises 
when there's pressure, who 
falls. I don't know anyone's 
tendencies in games, who 
cracks under pressure. We'll 
see." 
Cain said she's already com­

fortable with the veteran play­-ers, who she said took thp, freshmen under their wings. showed thnm the ropes and advisP.d them what to do on 
and off the court. 
Shp, already seems to be 

oozing the tPam spirit that 
Summitt finds handy in a 
player. 
"I don't think one player

Season begins with relays 
Belles travel north for first competition against conference foes 
By MARIE BUGNITZ Sports Writer 

With the end of fall break comes the beginning of Saint Mary's season. 
The Belles are set to swim in their first competition in a relay meet in llolland, Mich., against several other teams from the MIAA. 
Coach Ryan Dombkowski said this first meet was really "just for fun" and is thn "first taste of competition for the season" for the Belles. 
Led by senior captains Kelly Tighe and Tracy Kosmala, and junior Melissa Gerberth, Saint Mary's should have a strong season. Dombkowski said. 
"Last year, almost every swimmer on the team swam lifetime bests, and I expect to see that trend continue," Dombkowski said. "Ali-in-all, I will be happy to see us all work hard, be competitive, and have fun." 
That sort of attitude defines Dombkowski's technique of coaching -and the Belles have taken well to that method. 
"[They're] willing to work hard, want to swim fast, and want to have fun," Dombkowski said. 
With 27 swimmers and five divers on the team, Dombkowski believes the 2007­08 Belles squad is as talented a team as Saint Mary's has ever had. 
"We return all of our individ­ual conference scorers," Dombkowski said. "Plus we've added several new faces that have the ability to score at con­ference championships as well. ... As a team, we've never fin­ished higher than fifth in our conference, and I believe this team has the potential to sur­pass that mark." 
Dombkowski said he was happy with the efficiency of practices leading up to the sea­son. 
"Although swimming is often thought of as an individual sport, practices and competi­tion for spots in line-ups and on relays play a huge role into determining the success of a team," Dombkowski said. 

"During our first several weeks, I have seen some great competition day-in and day-out in practice that should propel our team to even more suc­cess." 
Swimmers to watch include Gerberth in the distance freestyle and freshman Casey Niezer in the individual medley and backstroke events. Both show the potential to qualify for the national championships this year, Dombkowski said. He also said there were more swimmers in every class that will "add to the depth" of the team, including junior diver Leah Bocinsky and freshmen Maggie Williams and Lauren Hartman. 
After the relay meet, Saint Mary's will go to Chicago on Nov. 2 to compete against the University of Chicago and the Illinois Institute of Technology. The following day, the Belles will travel to Crawfordsville, Ind., to compete against Illinois Wesleyan and Rose-Hulman.

SMC VOLLEYBALL 

Four conference gatnes left before tournatnent ­
Squad plays three times in the next week 

By SAMANTHA LEONARD Sports Writer 
As Saint Mary's students relax for fall break, the Belles volleyball team will be hard at work. The Belles begin play Saturday against Kalamazoo and Defiance and will play three more games next week. These final five games will finish up regular­season play for Saint Mary's. 
Kalamazoo is seventh in the 1\:IIAA (8-15, 4-8 MIAA). The Belles squashed the Hornets earlier this season, sweeping them in three games. 
Saint Mary's coach Julie Schroeder-Biek has been very busy preparing for the multi­tude of games over fall break, and it has been a challenge for the coach. 
"This is an interesting time in our season," Schroeder­Biek said. "We have limited practice opportunities in rela­tion to the Kalamazoo, Alma and Calvin matches. Our plan of attack is to bring our best game to the floor. Each one of these conference oppo­nents is very different but still very much a threat to us." 
After Kalamazoo, the Belles will take on the only non-con­ference match left this sea­son, Defiance. 
The Belles will have one day off before they take on eighth-place Alma (6-19, 2­11). The Scots proved no match for the Belles in their first meeting, where the Belles won 3-0. 
The Belles will leave Alma to head to Calvin for another conference meet. Calvin has been a tough competitor for all conference teams this sea­son, with a record of 12-1 in the MIAA and 21-4 overall. In their first meeting, Calvin swept the Belles with ease. 

The Belles will wrap up the conference schedule against fourth-place Tri-State (12-12, 9-5). The Belles were swept by the Thunder in their last meeting earlier in the season. 
With very little time to pre­pare, the Belles are focusing on one of their weaknesses: their emotions. 
"The key will be us playing with the heart and soul of winners ... putting in that extra effort to make that dig, get to that set, close that block, be in position to pass the ball to target, communi­cating on the court to team­mates -just being deter­mined to finish the season strong," Schroeder-Biek said. "Our key is our mind set." 
One of the Belles main goals this season was to be a host for the MIAA conference tour­nament. To be a host the Belles must be in fourth place by the end of the season, but right now Saint Mary's is sixth. 
Schroeder-Biek has not given up on this goal. But the main priority, she said, is to finish the season strong. 
"We still have a chance [to host]," Schroeder-Biek said. "But there are some things that will have to happen that are not in our control -it will help us if certain teams lose and certain teams win."

By MICHAEL BRYAN Sports Writer 
Notre Damn will look to continue its recent sueccss this wnnknnd, playing in the Mason Hudolph Invitational at Vanderbilt University. 
The three-round tourna­ment will hngin Sunday and end Tunsday. with one round !wing playnd each day. Complltitors will play all three rounds on the par-72 Vand1~rhilt Legends Club Ironhorse Course. The course, dnsigrwd. by Tom Kite and Bob Cupp, plays at 7,190 yards. 
"H's a very fair course of'f thn ten that will oiTer some hi rd in o p portuni ti1s," Irish coach Jim Kubinski said. "Tiw I.egPtHls Club is always in gn~at shap1~ and will snrv1~ as a pnrfnrt venue for this wenk's event." 
Last year, OIP Miss won the Invitational with a two-over­par 876. Tlw Hnbels clPfnated Vandnrbilt and North Florida hy night shots, and TennessPP-Chattanooga pl;u:('(J fourth. 
The Irish Pnter tlw tourna­ment frosh off best perform­ance of the young season at the Dukn Golf Classic. Notre Dame placed third of twelve teams in Durham, N.C., vault­ing past a quarter of tho field in the final round. 
"The guys have a great deal of conl"idenee at this point," Kubinski said. "It was nice to get four good seores for tho most part; the goal will be getting live in eontention." 
The Irish had four starters finish in the top 20 at I>uko, with freshman Tyler llock and junior Josh Sandman tying for No. 11 at three­under. Hock, starting for the first time in his career, was seven-under in the final two rounds. 
Snnior captain Greg Hodgnrs also had a solid tournament for the Irish, tying for 15th at two-under par. 
Sophomore Doug Fortrw r continued his exceptional play this season, taking his third top-20 finish in as many events. Fortner tied for 20th at one-over par, despite bogeying five of the last six holes in tlw first round. 
"W1~ canw out very focusnd and got some very solid seores from one through four in the lineup," Kubinski said. "That's the kind of depth we've been looking for during the past year or so, and we'll look to keep building on this the rest of the season." 
Notre Dame opened the tournament with a first­round of one-under, placing the Irish in seventh. After dropping several places mid­way through Sunday's second round, Notre Dame rallied into sixth place with several key birdies -in the last few holes. The Irish passed North Carolina-Wilmington and Eastern Carolina in the last four holes, and their hot play continued in a strong finish. 
There will be one changfl in the starting lineup for the Irish this weekend, with sophomore Kyle Willis enter­ing in place of senior Eddie Peckels. 
"Kyle is a steady player and exceiiBnt puttBr," Kubinski said. "I think he'll give us a couple nice rounds and a good boost."

"The girls are physically pre­pared to raee well, and this last week !of practice] is just main­taining the routine and getting in the last eonlidence booster," Bauters said. "This is going to be a very interesting meet. There are usually mixed emo­tions beeausn this is always an exciting meet but also the last of the season for some girls." 
Perhaps the biggest reason for the Belles' recent success has been the progression of the pack behind Gray. Consistent efforts from freshmen Sam Wieczorek and Catie Salyer, sophomore Megan McClowry and senior Olenka Bilyk have given Saint Mary's a deep team that could perform well at the championships. 
"I feel like the team has really improved across the board, and our four through eight runners have stepped up as a unit," BautBrs said. "Even if we end up at fourth overall in the con­ference, we've improved since last year in leaps and bounds beyond what the ranking can show."

After break, Irish look for fourth straight vvin 
By LORENZO REYES Sports Writer 
After an unprecedented 3-0 start for Notre Dame, a two­week break was a welcome dis­traction for the Irish. 
"I think it was a good way for the girls to get caught up in their school work," Irish coach Susan Holt said. "I think they're relieved and were able to rest up over the break." 
Now, the Irish, ranked No. 12 in the nation by Golfstat.com, look to start the season four­for-four at the thrBe-day Lady 
Paladin  Invitational  at  the  
Furman  Golf  Course  in  
Greenville, S.C.  

ThB field consists of 18 teams, six of which are ranked in the top 50. The Invitational will fea­ture No. 34 Louisville, No. 36 TCU, No. 39 Augusta State, No. 44 Furman and No. 50 Mississippi. 
Junior eo-captain Lisa Maunu will ten-ofT in the No. 1 spot when the tournamBnt bBgins today. Maunu shot a program record six-under-par 66 earli1~r this year and has linishnd all of th season's tournaments in thfl top 10 -inducting her overall victory in th<\ Cougar Classic. 
Teeing off from the No. 2 spot will be freshman So-llyun Park, who has made an instant con­tribution in her first year at Notre Dame. Park leads the team with a 72.00 scoring avBr­agn and thrBe top-five finishes on the year. 
The third spot belongs to freshman Katie Conway, who has averaged a 76.11. It is the highest position at which Conway has started this season. 
Sophomore Annie Brophy will ten off fourth. ller scoring aver­age of 75.89 has her in a tie for third on the team with fellow sophomore Kristin Wetzel, who

Holt said her team has prac­ticed well since its last competi­tive golf. 
"I think the break was a great chance for some of the players to focus on some of their indi­vidual issues," llolt said. "I was encouraged by their response over the break." 
Notre Dame had its practice round Thursday at the Furman Golf Course, where they got used to the course in prepara­tion for the tournamnnt. 
"They played well today," Holt said. "I was.impressed with their ball striking morB than anything." 
After the Lady Paladin Invitational, the Irish will head to Tuscaloosa, Ala., for the Ann Hhoads lntercollngiate from Oct. 26-28. That will bn the last tournament in tlw fall portion of the team's schedule.

game. They cur­
rently lead the 
Big East National Division by six points and have clinched a spot in the Big East tournament. 
Their recent scoring frenzy is due in part to the offensive explosion of junior forward Brittany Bock, the national and Big East player of the week for two weeks running. Bock leads the Big East in goals (10, also good for 15th in the nation} and goals per game (0.71). She ranks second in the conference in points and points per game and falls behind her teammate, junior forward Kerri Hanks, in both categories. Bock had four goals and an assist in wins can score goals in bunches, so that speaks for itself." 
If Seton Hall is able to contin­ue their recent scoring binge, Notre Dame can take comfort in the return to form of senior forward Joseph Lapira. Last season's national player of"the year scored only two goals in the team's first 12 games this season, but Lapira has tripled that output by netting two goals against both Connecticut and Indiana. 
"He came in with a calf injury, and then he picked up a hamstring, so he's been a little unfit from the start," Clark said. "A goal scorer needs pre­cision, and now that he's start­ing to get his fitness back, he's starting to score." 
Sunday's game will carry important implications in seed­ing for the Big East tourna­ment. Currently, the Irish con­trol their own destiny. Although they're two points behind Blue Division leader Connecticut, the Irish have four conference games remammg to the Huskies' three. If both teams were to win the remainder of their games, the Notre Dame would have the top seed going into the Big East tournament. 
Sunday's game is scheduled to begin at 1:30 p.m. at Alumni Field.

leers overcome deficit, delay in 4-3 victory 
By KYLE CASSILY 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame was a whirl­wind on the ice in the second period, bombarding Denver with shots and making the Pioneers dizzy with dazzling puck control in the offensive zone -and then an actual whirlwind intervened. 

The No. 11 Irish (2-1) weathered a 12-minute delay after the second period Thursday when a tornado warning prompt11d an evacua­tion of the Joyce Center. The stadium eventually refilled, and tho Irish held on in the third to defeat No. 5 Denver 4-3.

Karas, Bock pace squad in Big East 
By BILL BRINK Sporrs Writer 
On paper, Lauren Karas has it easy. 
In seven Big East games this year -all Notre Dame wins -the senior goalkeep­er has saved exactly seven shots. She is the proud owner of a 1.000 winning percentage and a 0.00 goals­against average against con­ference opponents. Heading into this weekend's games against Providence and No. 15 Connecticut, the No. 22 Irish are 7-0-0 in conference play and 9-4-1 overall. 

But for Karas, a senior, the stat lines don't reveal what makes her job dil'licult. 
"Its not that I don't see any action," Karas s-aid. "I do a lot of moving around in the box or I'll eo me piek Ithe ball] up in the top of' the box. It's frustrating for me because the shots are not ... all I do; I do a lot of other stuff."

Some people arn good at hid­ing their emotions. Evan Sharpley is great at it. 
Every wnnk sinen the begin­ning of the season, Sharpley has had to eomn out and hidn his dis­appointment with being the baekup mu:h wnnk. lie did it like a pro. Thanks to his calm personality, Sharpley hasn't caused the team any distractions. despite his battle with freshman Jimmy Clausen for the starting position.

"I think 1werybody wants to play," Sharpley said. "If you don't want that then you shouldn't be playing."

It's hard to put a linger on just what happens to Notre Dame's oiTense when Sharpley is out thero, but something is different. The team perks up and raises its level of play. 
Sharpley, also a member of Notre Dame's basdJall toam, doserves to start not only for his play on the field, but also for his loadership off the field.

So, whnn Evan Sharpley takes the first snap for Notre Dame on Saturday, he should have his teammates' full confi­dence that he can get the job done. If the Irish end up losing, no one will take the loss hard­er than Sharpley. Odds are, he'll blame it on himself. 
But if Notre Dame wins Saturday, 80,000 people in the stands and millions more across the country will be smiling. 
Hopefully, Evan Sharpley will let himself smile. lie's earned that much already.

The answer: Give or take two and a half months. 
USC fans at the time said they thought the Trojans were des­tined to win the national cham­pionship that year. It was fate. No way could they drive the length of the field in 2:04, con­vert on fourth-and-nine, have Heggie Bush push Matt Leinart over the goal line and win the most dramatic game of football in ages, just to lose later in the year. 
Well, they did. 
The Trojans had two more games that rivaled the intensity and emotions, the thrills and drama of the Notre Dame-USC matchup by the end of the year. They held off Fresno State, 50­42, but not Texas.

Sports Editor 
Nothing will change this weok. USC will play completely disinterested and unemotional foot­ball, allowing Notre Dame to stay in the game. For their part, the Irish will make key mistakes to give the game right baek. Evan Sharpley will do his best Jake "The Snake" Plummer impression behind the porous offensive line, whieh will lead to some exciting plays and also to some interceptions.

Notre Dame's rushing 

Notre Dame's pass 
The Irish special teams have run hot and cold this season. Last week, Notre Dame blocked a field goal, but missed one of its own and had a bad punt snap to give Boston College good field posi­tion. The kicking game needs to be more consis­tent this week.  
Desmond Reed is back to return kickoffs after injuring his knee at Notre Dame Stadium on a kickoff in 2005. Kicker David Buehler is 8-for-9 on field goals and 24­for-26 on extra points. Joe McKnight is a dan­gerous punt returner.

Notre Dame is slowly improving after a bad start to its season. The Irish played a Top-S team tough last week and won the week before. The weather is predicted to be rainy and the home crowd will be on Notre Dame's side.  
USC's last three oppo­nents, Washington, Stanford and Arizona, all have losing records, yet the Trojans struggled against them. USC is playing unemotional football. The Trojans need to wake up soon or they won't get back to the BCS.

Smith and Neal provide spark for defense 
By CHRIS KHOREY Spons Editor 
Brian Smith and Kerry Neal broke the defensive huddle and headed to the line of scrimmage. 
The two freshmen outside linebackers usually play on opposite sides of the defense, but on this play Saturday, defensive coordinator Corwin Brown had them line up together. Neal got into a three­point stance over Boston College left tackle Gosder Cherilus, while Smith lined up a couple feet inside him. lean­ing forward and threatening to blitz. 
At the snap, Neal blew past the tackle on the outside. Cherilus dropped well off the line to cut him off, and safety Tom Zbikowski blitzed through the newly created gap. 
Smith. however, did not blitz. Using the quickness that earned him his scholarship offer last winter, he backpedaled into pass cover­age. 
Eagles quarterback Matt Ryan saw Zbikowski flying toward him and got rid of the ball, but he never saw Smith, who intercepted it and returned it for a touchdown. 
The play looked beautiful from the stands, but the secret is that Smith wasn't where he was supposed to be -and nei­ther was anyone else. 
"We blew the coverage," fifth-year senior linebacker 
Joe Brockington said. "None of us were in the right spot." 
But whether or not Smith knew what he was supposed to do on that particular play, it still illustrates what he and Neal bring to the Notre Dame defense. That kind of dynamic play has earned the two fresh­men more time on the field in recent games. 
In reeent weeks, Neal earned a starting spot at out­side linebacker, and Smith, who plays on passing downs, beeame the first freshman in 31 years to return an intereep­tion for a touchdown. 
"I can't talk enough about them," head coaeh Charlie Weis said. "I keep on saying how the arrow is pointing up on them." 
Despite weighing 233 and 245 pounds, respeetively, Neal and Smith bring an element of speed to the edge that the Irish haven't had since Justin Tuck was lining up at defen­sive end. 
"They've brought a different dimension that coming into the season we weren't sure they could provide," Brown said. 
But it's not just their speed that has impressed the coach­ing staff. 
"They play this game with passion, and I think that any time you play the game with passion and have some athleti­eism, OK, you have a chanee to be something special, and I think that both those guys have a ehanee to be," Weis 
said. "When it's all said and done, by the time they leave here, they'll be household names." 
So far this season, Neal has appeared in every game, start­ing three of them. He has eight tackles, a sack and a fumble recovery. Smith has played in six games and has had 10 taekles, ineluding two for loss, along with his interception. 
Neal and Smith also provide position versatility. Both have lined up at inside and outside linebacker as well as in a three-point stance along the defensive line. On one play in the Boston College game, Smith even lined up at nose guard. 
Brown said putting Smith on the inside on third-and-long is something the Irish are eon­sidering going forward. 
"If he lined up there, we're thinking about doing it," he said. 
Coming into fall camp, Brown said, the Irish coaching staff wasn't sure whether Neal and Smith would be ready. 
"You'd like to think that they could do some things, but they've done things we weren't expecting," Brown said. 
Brockington said the two freshmen have a bright future. 
"Now, they're pretty good players," Brockington said. "But in the future once they've settled in they're going to be really good."
