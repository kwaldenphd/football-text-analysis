Ushering in the end of an era 
Stadium usher hired by Rockne at age 12 to retire after 60 years at ND 
By HELENA PAYNE 
News Writer 
At the end of the football season, one man will retire after 60 years of greeting Notre Dame fans eager to see Fighting Irish teams battle opponents on the field. 
Victor Couch, 86, started working as an usher when Knute Rockne hired him in -1926 to usher in Cartier Field at age 
12. Although Couch was not old enough to usher when Notre-Dame Stadium was erected in 1930, Couch was hired as a stadium usher in 1941 after a few years on the waitlist. Since then Couch has remained on the 850-member team of stadium ushers, waking up every football Saturday-for his part-time job at Notre Dame.

Although, he was a stadium usher for 60 years, Couch, since his job at Cartier Field, has been affiliated with the University for 7 4 years. 
Couch has seen many Irish football teams, head coaches and a renovation in the Stadium, but the change he identi­fied as the largest was the expansion of parking. 
"I would have to rush over to [the campus after work] on Saturdays," said Couch about earlier years of ushering. "That's when you could get a parking space." 
Though parking is more limited, Couch still manages to get on campus and said he always enjoys the games.

Luck of the Irish 
Unlike many Notre Dame or Saint Mary' stu­
dents, I was not weaned on Notre Dame foot­
ball. I would say I watch the games to appreci­
ate all the hard work the athletes put into 
their game, not because rm a rabid fan. 
My interest is partially 
d11e to the fact that my Sarah 
younger brother also RykQwskl 
plays on an Irish team for 
his high school. A team 
Saint Mary's
that, like the Irish of 
News Editor
Notre Dame, has strug­
gled at times. 
In 1997, the Father 
Gabriel Richard Fighting Irish were 0-9. A 
ye:,ar later, under new head coach Ed Maloney, 
they went 3-6. Last year I came home for Fall 
Break only to watch his team win their ninth 
strnight game. 
For the first time in years, the Irish were 
undefeated. No one can remember when they 
la:,t accomplished this feat. 
That year, in the fall of 1999, I bought one of 
those underground T-shirts that students sell 
before the games. one for the Kansas game. 
Then I brought it home as a souvenir for my 
brother. lie wore it to every single practice 
and every single game during his junior sea­
so11. And they won every single game he 
played in. 
'!'he Richard squad earned the Catholic League Class C championship and a trip to the Silverdome to play in the Catholic League Pr,)pBowl, only to lose by two touchdowns for their first loss of the season. They won their lirnt playoff game, and lost the second to end tht1 season at 10-2. 
My brother did not play in the PrepBowl 
except to take the kickoffs, after spraining his 
an.de in the final regular season game. He 
mi:;sed the second playoff game because my 
parents had scheduled a trip to Israel, not 
thi 11king that the Irish had a chance to make 
the playoffs. 
So I would like to think that the shirt had something to do with it. That somehow, the spirit of the Irish after that opening victory rubbed off on the shirt and transferred to my brother and to his Irish teammates. 
My city was as shocked as I was to see them do so well. The newspapers called them a Cinderella team over and over. Perhaps I am doing his team an injustice, going on about a shirt when in fact it was more likely their hard work and skill that did the trick. Still, some­thing different was in the air around the Irish of Ann Arbor, something that seemed to be missing from the Irish of South Bend. 
I wanted to test my hypothesis this year, but I didn't manage to get him a shirt until fall break. By then they were 2-5 overall and strvggling, after losing most of their offensive line to graduation. Most of the seniors and sorr.e of the juniors were playing the whole game to fill the holes. Suddenly, on the same day the Irish walloped Navy, coach Maloney decided to move his senior quarterback to wid,:\ reciever and let his sophomore signal­caller start. Sound familiar? It worked. 
That evening I watched the high school Irish pull through a nail-biter to improve to 3-5. Richard's final game of the season was the nigtt before the West Virginia game. It was a blow-out. They scored on the opening kickoff and went from there. After ending his junior season on a lackluster note, my brother scored two touchdowns in the final game of his career to hdp his team to a 46-12 victory. 
So was all of this an eerie coincidence? I prefer to think of it as the luck of the Irish at worl<.

DEKALB. Ill. 
A Northern Illinois University student, bound naked to a tree and covered in human waste, has drawn the atten­tion of NIU officials and DeKalb police for what he claimed was a voluntary incident. At 12:40 a.m. Wednesday, Todd Mattran was found by DeKalb police officers in front of his girlfriend's sorority house, Alpha Phi, 920 Hillcrest Drive. Members of the organization KEG. a Greenbrier Road fraternity c_hapter unrecognized by NIU, had been saving their urine and feces for the pre­vious week by putting it in pots and other containers, said Rick Clark, university programming and activities direc­tor. KEG members are formerly of Sigma Chi, a fraternity booted off campus for a host of violations earlier this semester. "I want to make it clear that the Greeks are appalled by this," Clark said. "They don't want the com­munity to think they were associated with this incident at all." Alpha Phi vice president Carrie McCarren said the situation was part of a tradition of lavaliering, in which a male professes his love for a sorority member.

UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA 
USF suspends basketball coach 
TAMPA, Fla. 

The University of South Florida suspended women's basketball coach Jerry Ann Winters Wednesday after an investigation said there was "reasonable cause" to believe she retaliated against former player Dione Smith after Smith complained about racial discrimination to universi­ty officials. "Examination of the evidence indicates that the complainant [Smith] would not have been dismissed from the basketball team was it not for her participation in a discrimination complaint," said assistant vice presi­dent for human resources Edouard Piou in a letter to Smith and Winters. Winters is suspended with pay for the duration of the appeal process, which will be more than a month. Assistant coach Jose Fernandez is the acting coach. "I believe that is the appropriate course of action," Athletics Director Paul Griffin said. "This will give her time to consider her options, which include an appeal. She actually asked to have time to concentrate." Winters said in a statement she would appeal and that the final investigation was "wrong and is defective on its face."

Cited students receive advice 
. Students busted in Finnigan's raid hear legal options 
By MIKE CONNOLLY 
News Wrirer 
ThreP Notrr Dame students with knowledge of the St. JosHph's County legal syslem and thr Notre Dame Residents I.ife system spoke to students citr.d at Finnigan's Irish Pub on Oct. 13 to di::;cuss their legal options. 
"I guess I am glad that I am pan or this Notre Dame tradi­tion. We had Bridget's and you guys have Finnigan's," said Kudy Monterrosa, student bar president of the Notre Dame Law School and an asshtant rector in Siegfried Hail. 
Monterrosa, the coordinator of the public defender program at the Law School. told approxi­malely 50 of the 147 Notre Dame and Saint Mary's student.'> cited at Finnigan's what to expect when they go to the St. Joseph's County courthouse. 
"This is really just to demysti­fy the process," he said. "I know most of you have never been in court before and have never been in trouble with the law." 
He said the prosecutor's office will most likely give the Finnigan's 147 the option for a pretrial diversion. If students select a pretrial diversion they will most likely be required to pay a $220 fine, perform 40 hours of community service and be placed on probation for one year. If students remain out of trouble for that one-year period, the citation will be wiped from their record. 
He said the prosecutor's office is not interested in slamming the student,; with heavy punish­ments because it has so many cases to handle at once. Most of the students at the information session had court dates today. 
"They are really worried about you folks coming over !Friday) because they are understaffed," Monterrosa said. "It's not everyday that they bust that many people so they are going to speed up the process. The pretrial diver::;ion process is the best way to get this off your record." 
If a student has prior offenses on his or her record. however, pretrial diversion may not be an option. lf a student is not given the option of a pretrial diver­s i o n . Monterrosa rec­

"I think [a pretrial] diver­sion is pretty much what every­body is going to get but every­one has different circumstances so your penalty may vary," said Monterrosa who planned to be at the courthouse today to give students advice. 
While Monterrosa outlined· exactly what the charges against the students meant, stu­dent government chief of staff Jay Smith told the students how the procedures at the court­house actually work. 
Smith spoke from personal experience. He was one of the 165 Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students cited at Bridget McGuire's on Jan. 30, 1998. 
Smith encouraged students to show up for their hearings early and dress appropriately. 

"It's early. It's Friday. It sucks but get there early," he said. "You don't want to give them any reason to mess with you." 
In addition to punishment from St. Joseph's County, sever­al students at the meeting were also concerned with possible punishment from ResLife. 
Tony Wagner. president of the judicial board and a peer advo­cate, said all the Notre Dame students but. three would receive conferences with HesLife and not H.esLife hear­ings. 
A conference is a one-on-one meeting with an administralor and usually less serious than a 
hearing. At a hear­

with a hearing but peer advocates do not usually participate in conferences, Wagner said. 
While students cited at Bridget's did not receive further discipline from ResLlfe, Wagner suspects that the students cited at Finnigan's may be disciplined more seriously. With the Board of Trustees examining the alco­hol policies at Notre Dame, Wagner thinks students might be treated more harshly than in the past. 
"They may be taking this thing more seriously than in the past," Wagner said but he didn't know what those punishments might be. "I can't even begin to understand their minds."

Students kick off free speech group 
By HELENA PAYNE 
News Writer 
Twenty-two students and one faculty member brainstormed ideas to promote free speech in a meeting for the newly formed 
coalition  for  free  speech  
Thursday night.  
Though  not  an  official  

University group, participants at the meeting were members of various student organiza­tions that wantf)d to discuss the issue of free speech and how it is implemented on cam­pus. 
"If you want to advance as an academic institu­
would consider other forms of getting the issue heard such as petitions. forums and rallies. 
Graduate student and PSA member Aaron Kreider cited several examples in the past in which the University affected free speech, especially pointing out incidents when it censored student media as well as stu­dent organizations. 
"Threats like this are nothing new," said Kreider referring to recent debate about The Observer's status as an inde­pendent paper free to choose its own advertisement. "The administration systematically violated freedom of speech."

Members of the Progressive Student Alliance (PSA) were on hand to suggest different ways in which they could effectively send messages to both students and the administration about the importance of and necessi­ty for free speech. 
"As a coalition we need to do constructive work and brain­storm ideas," said senior Sarah Greeman of PSA. 
Students said they would make a strong effort to work with administrators to collabo­rate on free speech issues. However, if that method did not work, many also said they 
ing students 

were under even more restrictions in regards to free speech. 
"I'm sort of an old Domer with a chip on his shoulder," said Manier. 
He said that compared to many other academic institu­tions. the University often lim­its free speech here, usually on the grounds that statements or actions go aga'ihst Catholic doctrine. 
"People in power like to exercise that power," said Manier. "If they can support those decisions with Catholic doctrine, they'll do that."

was hard to control the section. 
"They were full of pep all over the place," said Couch. "You couldn't get them to sit down like they were supposed to." 
Clark said that alumni who knew him as students have come back for games and encouraged him to continue to usher. Others, Couch said have asked him, "When are you going to call it quits?" 
"It makes me proud to be an usher at Notre Dame," said Couch and said he will remain an avid Notre Dame fan after he stops ushering. 
Before Couch retired, he worked as a road driver for Latheworks in South Bend for 15 years. Often during the week, Couch would eat in South Dining Hall with his wife who was a clerk in the old University bookstore. 
Gagnon, who has been the head of stadium ushers for six years, said Couch represents the usher mission, which is to be "ambassadors for Notre Dame." 
As ambassadors, Gagnon said the ushers have to be well­groomed, with white collared shirts, dress slacks and ties ­but the dress code is not the only defining characteristic of the "ambassadors." 
Gagnon said while the ushers are allowed to be -and over­whelmingly are -Notre Dame fans, they need to be objective in the stadium so as not to seem biased to guests from other teams. 
"Can you put your fanship aside a little bit and instead be a host for a little bit?" Gagnon 
said, asking a common question 
that he wants the ushers to 
answer affirmatively. 
Gagnon said this policy has 

worked and people often call 
him to complement the ushers. 
The stadium ushers -500 of 

whom are unpaid volunteers ­
come from various places and 
backgrounds to work at Notre 
Dame football games. These 
include Tim Schwartz of 
Louisville, Ky. who drivns to 
South Bend starting at 12 a.m. 
Saturdays and arrives at 6 a.m. 
Gagnon said as an early shirt 
usher, he offered Schwartz pay, 
but he wouldn't except it. 
"We have so many people who work for free just to be part of Notre Dame," said Gagnon. 
Another traveling usher is a physician from Washington, DC who is not ushering this season because of his job. However, he used to ny to South Bend for games regularly. 
Cagnon said he was thor­oughly impressed with Jim Hall. an usher at the wheel­chair entrance who uses a wheelchair himself. At the Texas A&M game, Hall gave up his wheelchair so that senior citizens that had trouble mov­ing quickly in the 100 degree­plus weather could get to their seats more easily. 
"I think that's an incredible act of kindness," said Gagnon. 
Couch said that he has not seen any stadium with the amount of ushers that Notre Dame has nor the quality of service they provide. 
After the final score decides the winner of the last home game of the season against Boston College on Nov. 11, the stadium ushers will lose a staff member, but retain a man who intends to remain an ambas­sador for Notre Dame forever. 
"I love Notre Dame very, very much," said Couch.

Manager admits faking robbery: 
The manager of a Christian bookstore, who tripped and hit his head while stealing money from the store, tried to fool police into believing he'd been battered and robbed. Sgt. Matt Myers of the Columbus Police Department said police were dispatched to the Family Christian Store early Tuesday morning on a report that a rob­ber had beaten the store's manager. Gilbert 'Tony" Matteucci, 28, of Greenwood, was man­ager of the store for less than three weeks. Myers said Matteucci told police he was in the store and was coming out of the restroom when he was knocked unconscious by a blow to the head. Employees found him shortly after 7:30 
a.m. lying on the floor with a small abrasion on his face. He told them he had been robbed and they called police.

Officials find 23 survived Kursk accident 
Auociau:d Press 
MURMANSK 

Huddled in a destroved submarine on the sea floor, a Russian sailcir wrotfl a terse account of how he and 22 comrades tried in vain to escape, then scrawled a last message to his family, Russian naval officials said Thursday. 
The note was found in the pocht of Lt. Dmitry Kolesnikov, whose body was one of the first to be recovered from the nuclear submarine Kursk that sank Aug. 12 with 118 men aboard. The message was the first firm evidence that any of the crew initially survived explosions that shattered the submarine. 
Written a few hours after the sub plunged to the bottom of the Barents Sea, the note tells a horrifying story in eerily straightforward sentences. 
"All the crew from the sixth, sev­enth and eighth compartments went over to the ninth. There are 23 peo­ple here. We made this decision as a result of the accident," Russian navy chief Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov quot­ed the note as saying. 
"None of us can get to the surface," the message continued. 
Kolesnikov's handwriting in the first part of the note was neat, Kuroyedov said during a meeting with the victims' relatives. But after the submarine's emergency lights went out, the 27-year-old seaman from St. Petersburg began to scrawl and desperation set in. 
"I am writing blindly," Kuroyedov quoted the latter part of the note as saying. 
The rest of the note was private and would be shown to Kolesnikov's family, said Vice Adm. Mikhail Motsak, the Northern Fleet chief of staff. 
Most of the Kursk's crew apparent­ly died instantly in the explosions that tore open the Kursk's first six compartments or within minutes as water roared into the submarine. 
But the knowledge that some remained alive for hours revived the horror that gripped the nation after the sinking. 
"I feel pain, enormous pain," Kolesnikov's widow, Olga, said on the NTV television channel. "I had a pre­monition my husband didn't die instantly. The pain I felt then has come true." 
In excerpts of a documentary shown on NTV Thursday, Olga also said her husband had penned her a mournful poem in the days before he went on the Kursk's final voyage and left it. 
"Shortly before he went to sea, he wrote a poem to me that says 'When the hour to die will come, although I try not to think about it, I would like to have time to say, 'My darling I love you'," she said in a documentary made by Norway's TV2. Parts of it were shown on NTV Thursday. 

The recovered bodies are to be flown on Saturday to Severomorsk, the Northern Fleet's main port, for a memorial service. However, fierce winds forced the divers to suspend operations Thursday and it was unclear when bodies could be brought to the surface, the IT AR­Tass news agency reported. 
The Russian government has been widely criticized at home for a slow and seemingly confused response to the disaster. Russian mini-sub­marines tried unsuccessfully for days to open the Kursk's escape hatch. There were reports that noises from the wreckage could have come from trapped sailors banging on the hull. 
Two days after the Kursk went down, Russia made the sinking pub­
lic. Although Western countries quickly offered to help, it was anoth­er two days before a Norwegian div­ing team was asked to assist. The Norwegians quickly opened the hatch but determined that the sub was flooded and the crew dead.

Government jails sect members 
Associated Press 
BEIJING 

The 11 Falun Gong followers eat­ing stewed pork and spicy peppers in a private room at a Beijing restau­rant knew it could be their last sup­per before a long detention in prison. 
Mostly strangers, they introduced themselves in hushed voices and shared their anger over a Chinese government crackdown on their sect. 
It was a scene replayed throughout Beijing on Wednesday night, a day before at least 100 sect members wern detained during one of Falun Gong's largest demonstrations since it was banned 15 months ago. 
Thursday's events at Tiananmen Square were brief but violent, like most of the sect's previous demons­trations. No sooner had small bands of Falun Gong members begun to unfurl banners or throw leaflets than dozens of police rushed to pummel them and drag them to waiting vans. 
One man, thrown to the ground, was kicked in the stomach and head until blood ran from his mouth onto the gray flagstones. An elderly woman was dragged by her hair for several yards as bystanders pleaded with police to stop. 
Order was restored only after police closed China's best known public monument for almost a half hour. One witness said 30 police vans fillfld with protesters drove off the square, which could put the numbers detained over several hun­dred.

"[Lieberman I sees this as something extremely important,'' said Signer. "The Sabbath laws can be 
set aside for saving a human life." 
The most recent issue that has contin­ued the debate about Liflberman's religious infl Licncc on policies is the continuous and increasingly violent 

outt>reaks in the West Lieberman Bank, which are impeding the process of negotiation between Israelis and Palestinians difficult. Ma-r1y have protested Lieberman's presence on the ticket saying that he would be biased whim dflaling with Middle East officials. 
"When you go to the bargaining table you ha~e to be fair," said freshman Dan Tyszka, member of the College Hepublicans. "Lioberman's views could be biased." 
Tyszka said that he could not specifically prndict Lieberman's actions but he thinks that Lieberman would push for a Jewish stale in the Middle East. 
"I don't know what he would do directly othar than he would not be a very good per­son to send to the bargaining table for the United States," Tyszka said. 
However government and international relations professor Alan Dowty said that foreign policy is not a large enough issue to sway the vote significantly against Lieberman. 
"Foreign policy is still a minor concern and Lieberman's attitudes are not di!Terent from Gore's or from the other candidates," Dowty said. 
Signer pointed out that Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who is also Jewish, held his office in another time of unrest in the Middle East. 

"There's someone who on a daily basis had to deal with the Middle East," said Signer. 
Signer said that as Kissinger handled the situation, Liebf'rrman could also. 
In addition to comparisons to Kissinger, some have compared the situation of Lieberman to that of President John Kennedy in 1960 when Kennedy became the first Catholic U.S. president If Lieberman should be elected with Gore, he could introduce yet another religion to the executive office. 
Dowty said the comparisons are similar because both politician broke significant political barriers. 
"In a sense, it represents a kind of break­through for a particular religion, Catholicism then, Judaism now," said Dowty. 
"If anything it's a positive factor," said Uowty of Gore's choice of Lieberman for his ticket. 
Tyszka, however. said if there was a con flict in Northern Ireland in 1960, he feels that Kennedy would hold the same bias and therefore be a poor repre­
sentative in negotiations. "Even as a Catholic I would say that he would  "... I believe we are still struggling to  as a nation need to have. for I believe that we are still strug­gling to regain our moral bal­

In an August ABC/Good Morning America telephone poll, 89 percent said they're "not concerned that Lieberman's faith would interfere with his duties as vice president." 
Monday Lieberman said during his lecture on "Faith and Values" that he did not see a radical difference among the religion's influence in U.S. society, but he noted soci­ety has become divided into two sides: secu­lar and religious. He made it clear that he supported the religious side because he the Clinton impeachment trial

But they were not, and are not, exclusive to any one religious denomination," said Lieberman. 
Dowty said by including all religions, Lieberman has not been divisive. Instead. he has used religious values like faith to appeal to all people in the U.S. 
"His candidacy has represented an appeal to basic religious values that look beyond any specific religion,'' said Dowty.

College Park may allow fewer students in each unit 
By LIZ ZANONI 
News Writer 
College Park, the all-student apartment complex on Bulla Road. is considering limiting the number of students allowed in each of the 52 units, said College Park man­ager, P.R. Gibson. 
Instead of permitting threfl to four people in each apart­ment. Gibson said that the apartments, owned by Southwest Corporation in Fort Wayne. might limit each unit to two or three students. 
"Three is being talked about," said Gibson. "It seems to work out better, but none of it is carved in stone." 
Past experience is the prima­ry reason for the cap on the number of students per apart­ment said Gibson. Although Pach College Park apartment has only Lwo bedrooms and two bathrooms, most current residences have three or four students living in each unit. 
Although Gibson believes that limiting students would have little effect on next year's potential residents, students who have heard the rumor are concerned about higher living expenses. This year's College Park students paid $915 for a lower apartment and $940 for an upper apartment per month. 
"I don't think they'll find many people who can afford it," said senior Matt Schoettler, a College Park resident who lives with three other room­mates on the second floor. Schoettler said he and his roommates might .not have lived at Collegfl Park if they were limited to three people. 
Gibson, however believes that splitting the rent among three people is a reasonable request. 
"I'd like to know where else you i;an rent for $300 a piece," said Gibson. "If that is too high, somebody has a real

alone or with only one other person. 
"That would be the ideal sit­uation," Gibson said in refer­ence to maintaining two people per apartment. 
Erin Place, a senior Finance major who lives at College Park, said that the rent would be obscene when split between only two students. 
Although Gibson was clear in pointing out that the cutback was speculative, Notre Dame juniors Colleen Flood, Kate Diaz and Mandy Reimer were told by Gibson that for next year, only three were allowed in the bottom apartments and two were allowed in the upper apartments. Flood, Diaz and Reimer instead decided to rent from Ann Ward who bought some of the units within College Park and is allowing the three women to live in an upper apartment. 
It is not clear at this point what the ramifications could mean to students wanting to live off-campus. 
Despite the circulating rumor, Gibson said that College Park will continue to remain a student only apart­ment complex, regardless whether the maximum number of residences per apartment is reduced. 
"We'd like to think we have the best place in town," said Gibson. "The kids tell me so."

truck tires 
Associated Pre.. 
PHOENIX 
Officers at the Arizona Department of Public Safety were so worried about dan­gers associated with Fircston'e truck tires that in 
l998 the agency's director had them replaced on _all vehicles. 
But while the agency voiced concerns over accidents and tread· separation blowouts to Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., it did not alert federal regula­1ors or the public. When Bridgestone/Firestone gave the agency a $42,000 replacement credit, it accept­ud the tire maker's charac­terization of the problem as '·customer dissatisfaction" rather than faulty tires, an investigation by The Associated Press found. 
"It seems that they took a very short-term, practical approach to this and didn't look al the safety ramifica­tions," said Grant Woods, who was the state's attorney {teneral at the time. "It's one thing for a private citizen to do it. It's another for a gov­cirnmen t agency to do it. A !tovernment agency shouldn't do it." 
Joan Claybrook, director of the consumer watchdog group Public Citizen and a former head of the National llighway Traffic Safety Administration, said agencies like Arizona's public safety department, which have large fleets of vehicles. skilled dri­\'ers and consistent mainte­nance programs. are in the hest position to recognize tire s af'ety problems first. 
"When you have the responsibility of public safety. you always have to be think­ing of the publie." she said. "My God. it seems like corpo­rate behavior not public behavior." 
Joe Albo. the agency's director at the time who ordered the switch to tires made by The Goodyear Tire Hubber Co .. said the risk management unit of Arizona's Department of Administration was told t,bout its tire problems. No one from the state filed any complaints with the National Ilighway Traffic Safety Administration, according to the federal agency's records. 
Gov. Jane Hull's spokes­woman, Francie Noyes, said the administration is review­ing the tire problems and the agency's response. 
"We've just become aware of the issues you raise and we're looking into it," Noyes told AP. 
Federal regulators are investigating 3,500 com­plaints and 119 tratTic deaths in connection with tires made by Nashville, Tenn.-based Bridgestone/Firestone. Some of the complaints were about tread separation. 
Arizona was one of four hot-weather states where most of' the initial tread-sepa· ration complaints about Firestone tires originated. 
In 1997 and 1998, Arizona public safety officers were involved in at least five acci­dents caused by tread sepa­rations, according to the agency's documents.

]Report: Hackers break iinto Microsoft network 
Associa1cd Press 

NEW YORK 
Hackers reportedly broke into Microsoft Corp.'s computer net­work and may have stolen blueprints to the latest versions or the rnmpany's Wiqdows and Office software. 
Microsoft and the FBI are investigating the break-in, which was discovered Wednesday by the software giant's security employees, The Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site Friday, citing people familiar with the situation. 
Security employees discovered that passwords used to transfer the source code behind Microsoft's software were being sent from the company's computer network in Redmond, Wash., to an e­nail account in St. Petersburg, Russia, the Journal reported. 
A Microsoft spokesman confirmed that the company's corporate 
r. etwork had been hacked and said "the integrity of Microsoft source code remains secure," the newspaper reported. The identities of the hackers are unknown. They are believed to 11 ave had access to the software codes for three months. 
A person familiar with the break-in told the Journal that it appeared the hackers accessed Microsoft's system by e-mailing software, called QAZ Trojan, to the company's network and then opening a so-called back door through the infected computer. 
Microsoft was planning lo investigate the break-in without help from U.S. authorities. the Journal reported, but the company con­tacted the FBI on Thursday.

Waterbury Mayor Philip Giordano, the Republican chal­!.cn ger ,.. called the decision

"I think the people of the state of Connecticut ought to stand up and take notice that this man is not only being self­ish in running for two offices, but he has taken the voters of Connecticut for granted by not participating in the democratic process," Giordano said Thursday. 
Lieberman has campaigned one day in his home state. August. 
Giordano has taken to calling Lieberman "No Show Joe" and last week staged a mock debate with a cardboard cutout of Lieberman. 
Clinton, GOP in tax cut battle 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Republicans warn that if President Clinton delivers on his promise to veto a tax-cut package and a spending bill t h a t 
revamps immigra­tion laws it will hurt Democrats· prospects in the Nov. 7 elections. 
Defiant 

GOP lead-Clinton ers hoped to push both measures through the Senate on Friday, a day atler a divided House approved the spending bill by 206-198 and the tax legislation by 237 -17 4. 
Both votes fell short of the two-thirds majorities needed to reverse a presidential veto. Even so, the brewing con­frontation seemed likely to draw public attention to this year's long-running budget fight, just as it was looking as if Congress might finally com­plete its business and adjourn quietly -less than two weeks from Election Day. 
Clinton's veto threat on a $39.9 billion measure financing the departments of Commerce, Justice and State for 2001 focused on the GOP's failure to overhaul immigration laws as broadly as Clinton wants. 
The president would grant amnestv to all aliens who arrived illegally before 1986, while Republicans would ease restrictions for some close rela­tives of permanent residents and let others with long-run­ning disputes over their immi­gration. "Hispanics who are here legally abhor aliens who

Gore saves $23M for final push 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

Al Gore put away $23.1 mil­lion to spend during the final stretch of the campaign, hop­ing to offset the Republican Party's 
c a s h advantage over the Democrats. 
In the last look at campaign spending before the 


Nov. 7 Gore election, 
Gore reported to the federal Election Commission on Thursday that he spent $18.1 
million bt>tween Oct. 1 and Oct. 18 -$1 million a day -with two-thirds of that. or $12.6 million, going for television commercials. lie had $23.1 million left of the $67.6 million in federal funds he received for the fall campaign. 
Spending figures for George 

W. Bush were not immediately available. 
At the same iime, the Republican National Committee reported that it had $32 million in the bank on Oct. 18, with $24.6 million of that raised under federal contribu­tion limits, meaning that it can be used to directly aid candi­dates. 
The party raised $19 million during the first 18 days of the month, or more than $1 mil­lion a day, from 300,000 con­tributors. 
"Governor Bush's positive message is resonating with Americans and ,their contribu­tions to the party and the ticket are the proof," Republican National Chairman Jim Nicholson said. 
The Democratic National Committee did even better than the GOP in raising money, taking in $22.6 million between Oct. 1-18. But the party still trails the Republicans in the size of its bank account. The DNC reported a bank balance of $27 million, of which $18.1 million was raised under fed­eral limits. The party also had debts of $5.8 million, giving it a net surplus of $21.2 million. 
The DNC raised another $3.5 million Tuesday at a concert held at the Wildhorse Saloon in Nashville, featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, Tony Bennett and

this election is about issues and getting your mes­sage out to the voters," DNC spokeswoman Jenny Backus said. 
Even so, Gore campaign aides said the vice president had put away money for the final push, concerned about the Republicans' cash advan­tage. 
In the competitive race for the House, where the Democrats need just eight seats to guarantee that they will pick the next speaker, the National Republican Congressional Committee reported having $25 million in the bank as of Oct. 18, includ­ing $13.3 million raised under federal limits. Since then, the Bush campaign contributed $1 million and vice-presidential nominee Dick Cheney head­lined an Ohio fund-raiser Thursday that brought in another $600,000. 

Helping to fill the coffers were members of the House GOP majority, who more than met their fund-raising goal of $16 million. contributing more than $18 million to the NRCC. 
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee officials did not make their fund-rais­ing figures available Thursday. On the Senate side. the

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee had $2.8 million in the bank on Oct. 18, half of it raised under federal limits. 
Spokesmen for both commit­tees said the balances were so low because they already had bought most of their advertis­ing time for the election. But they also had enough funds for some last-minute purchases; the NRSC on Thursday spent $600,000 on ads in support of Rep. Bob Franks of New Jersey, running for an open Senate seat against millionaire Jon Corzine. 
Republicans criticize anti-Bush phone calls 
Associated Press 
LANSING. Mich. 

Michigan residents am get­ting taped phone calls from Texans and actor Ed Asner say­ing George W. Hush breaks promises and would harm Social Security ­calls that GOP leaders say show a desperate Al Gore. 
In one call, Charlotte Cherry of Houston says that "Governor Bush has accepted $1.3 million from corporate polluters and he's allowed them to keep pol­luting while my kids suffer." 
In another, Ann Friday of Arlington, Texas, says that her husband died after neglect in a nursing home four years ago and that Hush has signed legis­lation that has weakened rather than strengthened nursing home regulations. 
Asner's calls say that "George 
W. Bush has a proposal that would undermine Social Security, even scuttling current benefits." . 
GOP Gov. Engler called the phone calls "a stealth campaign designed to be below the radar and designed to appeal to fears or prejudices." 
"These are not advocacy calls," he said. "These are designed to put a bad taste in someone's mouth." 
The Michigan Democratic Coordinated Campaign paid to have the calls by Cherry and Friday recordAd and sent auto­matically to Michigan voters' phones, said spokesman Chad Clanton. 


The Asner call, which is not being made anymore, was sent out bv tho Democratic National Comrnittee and Michigan Democratic Party. 
The so-called "push calls" are the first in Michigan during this year's general election, but they are not the first in the state this year. 
In the days leading up to the Peb. 22 Republican presidential primary, the campaign of Sen. John McCain of Arizona paid for calls suggesting Bush was anti-Catholic after Bush spoke at Hob Jones University. 
At the same time, Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson made taped phone calls to Michigan households accusing a top McCain adviser of being "a vicious bigot" who called con­servative Christians "anti-abor­tion zealots, homophobes and would-be censors." 
McCain won the Michigan pri­mary. and some analysts said the phone calls backfired. 
A poll released Thursday by EPIC/MRA of Lansing and con­ducted for the Detroit Free Press and WXYZ-TV in Southfield had Gore at 44 per­cent and Bush at 42 percent two weeks before the election, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
Cherry, who taped the cur­rent phone call on pollution, said in a telephone interview that she has voted for both Republicans and Democrats in the past.

Senate passes health legislation 
Aso~iated Press 
WASHINGTON 

The Senate passed a $919.5 million bill Thursday intended to improve the nation's ability to respond to a bioterrorist attack, modernize federal dis­ease labo­ratories and move toward placing heart delib­ri lla tors in all federal buildings. 
"This comprehensive legisla­tion contains a variety of public health bills that will help to improve the health and safety of all Americans," said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tcnn , a physician. 
In separate action, lawmak­ers were poised to send the president a package that boosts outreach programs for the elderly. 
But the health care action was overshadowed by 

President Clinton's vow to Vf'tO a Medicare package. The $30 billion package aims to boost payments to health care providers who say 1997 budget cuts went too far. 
"You insist on an unjustifi­able spending increase for HMOs," Clinton said in n. Thursday letter. 
Clinton complains the mea­sure gives managed care com­panies too much without enough accountability. The president, hoping to deter HMOs from dropping out of Medicare, wants provisions forcing managed care compa­nies to stay in the program ­which benefits elderly and the disabled -at least three years. 
The Medicare package faced problems over a provision granting t'he Congressional Budget Office access to federal census and tax records. The CBO wanted it to make long­term projections about Social Securily and Medicare pro­grams. 
The Commerce Department maintains it violates census­related privacy protections. 



There were also complaints from at least one Republican over a provision added by House Speaker Dennis Hastert to give states more time tu end any use of a loophole in the Medicaid law that lets states collect billions in extra dollars. 
Illinois is a major benefactor of the loophole, and the Department of Health and Human Services recently issued ·a proposed rule that phases out the loophole over five years. 
Sen. William Roth, the Finance Committee chairman, issued a statement saying, "It makes too many special accom­modations to those states that have abused the system." 
The "mini-bus" package, a compilation of several health bills introduced this session, passed the Senate by unani­mous consent Thursday. The House planned to take it up later in the day. 
A major portion of the bill authorizes $540 million to strengthen the nation's ability to deal with serious public health threats such as antimi­
crobial resistance and bioterrorist attacks. 
It provides grants to study how well public health agen­cies respond to disease out­breaks, coordinates efforts between federal agencies and authorizes the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control to develop new vaccines for biological weapons. 
The heart defibrillator provision allows the Health and Human Services Department to make recom­mendations on placing these external devices in federal buildings. It also protects helpers from liability. 
PlayStation2 sales cause some scuffles 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 

When it came to getting your hands on a Sony PlayStation2, it didn't pay to be polite. 
With the company already acknowledging it can't meet demand because of parts shortages, consumers resorted to whatever tactics necessary to nab whatever was on the shelves when the widely-antic­ipated video-gaine console went on sale Thursday. 
In some cases, that meant picking fights with retailers' security guards or pushing their way into the front of the line at 3 a.m. Others mapped out a clear-cut strategy before parking them­selves on line,

from hard-core gamers in their 20s and 30s to grandmothers looking to buy PlayStation2 for their grandchildren, went home angry -and empty­handed. 
Scuffles even broke out at some locations. ·In Minot, N.D., police were called to a Wal­Mart store after receiving reports of people threatening others waiting in line for the console. 
In Woodstock, Ga., north­west of Atlanta, two eager cus­tomers were ticketed for disor­basis before the doors opened to prevent a stampede. 
"We heard that if you didn't get it today, we'll have to wait 'ti! Christmas. So we need to get it now," said Brian Jones, 24, a game designer from Dallas, who was the first per­son in line at a North Dallas Best Buy and had been wait­ing since 6 p.m, the prior evening. 
Other shoppers took things in stride and created parties of their own, ordering pizza and watching the World Series on miniature TVs as they camped out all night. Customers them­selves tried to keep the peace by organizing the lines and keeping tabs on when people showed up. 
"We are trying 
to create harmo­
together and 

organized a very tight line." 
It worked in his favor. Reyes, who describes himself as a game addict, was one of only' 10 out of 60 in line who was able to get a PlayStation2. 
PlayStation2 signals a new generation of consoles, where consumers can eventually play DVD movies, download music, play games with their friends in another city, and do some surfing -all through their TV sets.

ZIMBABWE 

President threatens to try whites 
Associated Press 
HARARE 
With lhe opposilion trying to impeach him and his popularity at an all-time low. President Hobert Mugabe has lashed out at Zimbabwe's white minority, Lhreatening genocide trials for all who fought against him in the independence war. 
Mugabe told supporters Wednesday that Ian Smith, the white leader he helped over­throw two decades ago, and all whites who fought against black guerrillas would face tri­als for war crimes. 
"Ian SmiLh and his fellow whites committed genocide during our liberation war. They will stand trial for their crimes," Mugabe said. 
Smith, 81, was the last white leader of the former British colony of Rhodesia, as Zimbabwe was known before independence. 
He was in Britain on a lecture tour Thursday, his son Alec said, 
Mugabe said the nation's 70,000 whites -less than 1 percent of the population of 13 million -mostly opposed his government and had spurned offers of forgiveness and recon­ciliation. 
"National reconciliation is greatly threatened by the whites. We should revoke it. After all, in Europe they are still hunting for those behind Nazi war crimes, and Zimbabwe cannot be an excep­tion," Mugabe said. 
About 40,000 mostly black lighters died in the seven-year bush war that led to indepen­dence in 1980. 
Namibian President Sam 

Nujoma declared his support Thursday for Mugabe's plans during a press conference in Botswana. 
Nujoma said the root of Zimbabwe's problem was that Britain had reneged on its promise to give the country funds to buy land from white farmers for redistribution it to landless blacks. 
Britain, which pledged nearly $55 million for land reform at independence in 1980, deliv­ered nearly 90 percent of that money before freezing the fund in 1990. 
It said Zimbabwe violated .the 
agreement by forcing unwilling farmers to sell their land to the state. 
Opposition leaders con­demned Mugabe's statemenL'> and said he could hold tri­als only after repealing 

"Ian Smith and his 
enforce law and fellow whites committed order to end 
independence-era amnesty clauses in the constitution, a move that could backfire. 
"This opens a Pandora's box," said David Coltart, a white law­maker for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. "The abuses by the guerrilla forces would have to come under equal scrutiny." 
Mugabe specifically named Coltart -a longtime human rights activist who was a harsh critic of the Rhodesian govern­ment -as one of those who should be investigated. 
Coltart's party on Wednesday asked parliament to impeach Mugabe, the same day a poll

Museums search for Nazi-looted works

Britain's museums and gal­leries, seeking to establish that their collections are free of Nazi-looted art, are appealing for public help in researching the backgrounds of hundreds of works whose whereabouts during World War II are uncertain.

"People could have the small­est pieces of information that could be crucial for us in determining where a piece of art was" before and during the Holocaust, said Sir Nicholas Serota, chairman of a British committee set up to investigate the issue of Nazi­looted art. 
An exhaustive search of Britain's national museums launched last year has failed to establish that any items in their collections were wrongly appropriated during World War II. But 600 works are under a cloud because no reliable record exists of their wartime history. 
Eight months ago, the museums published a list of 350 items whose where­abouts could not be estab­lished before and during the war. Some have since been removed because their pedi­grees were established, but others were added in the interim. 
The latest additions include a valuable miniature of a cru­cifix from a 15th-century Latin prayer book, now held by the British Library -one of more than 80 million works in its possession. It was acquired in the mid-1970s from a now-deceased buyer who said he had bought it at an antique shop that in turn had acquired it from a clergy­man in southern England. 
"We have no reason to believe that ... it ever left the British Isles," said Alice Prochaska, the library's director of special collections.

master Edgar Degas, "Lady with a Parasol," painted between 1870 and 1872. It was bequeathed to Britain's Courtauld Institute gallery· in 1978. Researchers know it came via a Paris col­lection, but cannot establish when it changed hands. 
Also being investigated is a painting held by the National Maritime Museum, signed by a T. Boone or F. Boone, por­traying an 18th-century brig­antine, or double-masted sail­ing ship. 
So far, the museums have received only one claim of possible misappropriation ­an 18th-Century oil painting titled "View of Hampton Court Palace" attributed to Jan Griffier the Elder and held by the Tate Gallery. That claim is being assessed.

accordingly. a re­examination of the laws regarding the off-campus social scene could prevent future large-scale arrests and curb underage drinking in off-campus bars. 
Finnigan's was more than just a place to drink. It was the place to be for many Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students. While many students did procure fake IDs in order to drink underage, many others sought access to Finnigan's as a chance to dance and socialize with their pus establishments 
without needing a fake JD. Such a law might actually cut down on underage drinking. 
Some underage students who drink lightly at the bars might stop drinking if they did not need to use a fake ID to access the bar. "18 to enter, 21 to drink" laws would also cut down on the number of students who have fake IDs but no intention of drinking. If underage non-drinkers could attend off-campus establishments without using a fake ID, they would not break the law by print­ing fake IDs. 
People attending the bar who arc 21 could be given a wristband alerting bar­tenders that they are legal to drink. Bartenders and establishment bouncers could better regulate the drinking done by minor attendants by checking for wristbands. 
While minors within the establish­ment might still drink by having friends who are legal buy them alcohol or pre­senting fake IDs, authorities within the bar could more easily detect underage drinkers by looking for wristbands. The absence of such demarcations among those drinking would alert officials of their status as underage drinkers. 
The implementation of an "18 to enter. 21 to drink" law would uphold the enforcement and regulation of underage drinking laws while fostering a social environment for adults 18 and older. 
Entering the election's home stretch 
The late Bob Prince, the Pittsburgh Pirates· legendary announcer, often described a play as, "close as the fuzz in a tick's ear." That description portrays the presidential polls between Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor George 
W. Bush. Barring any major outside developments or October surprises, the outcome of the election should begin to come into focus by Monday. 

Elections evolve through cycles. The final phase encom­passes the last 10 days when voters tend to decide on their selections and trend lines begin to show in the polls. Today is the first of the final 10 days of the 2000 election. Weekend polling results released on Monday should shed some light on who has the momentum. That candidate will be the winner if outside forces do not interrupt the final days of the campaign. 
For Gore. stock market declines or fur­ther instability in the Middle East can be an outside force that sidetracks his cam­paign. For Bush, the recently released Rand report criticizing the Texas educa­tional progress may be the force that unravels his candidacy. President Clinton could also influence reactions favoring either candidate by making a policy mis­take that shows him weak or using mili­tary force against terrorists that shows him strong and decisive. 
At this point in time during the election 20 years ago between President Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, the candidates were deadlocked in the polls. However, the voters had begun moving towards Reagan, so much so that Carter's pollster told the president on the Saturday before the election that he had lost. Similarly in 1992, President Bush was told of his fate 

during the weekend before his loss to Bill 
Clinton. 

Gore has begun a slight rise in the polls this week. overtaking Bush for the first time in many days. Was this rise the start of the final trend breaking for Gore or just a reflection of Gore's further consolidation of the Democratic base? Bush has consis­tently held his Republican base support in the high 80 percentage levels while Gore has gone from the high 70s into the low 80 percentage levels. Getting those core supporters to the polls will be crucial in this election. 
Women who favor Gore's positions have moved back and forth. first to Bush and now back to Gore. They have provided the vice president's advantage thus far. 
It appears that as election day looms, many are choosing presidential substance over presidential personality. Gun owners are enthusiastically reacting to the National Rifle Association's massive vilifi­cation of the vice president, keeping many of the battleground states into play for Bush. 
qosely watch the polls released on Wednesday next week. As the days of the campaign draw short, each day's momen­tum doubles in importance as more voters break with the final trend. If Gore contin­ues to hold the national lead in most or all of the polis on that day, he will be able to sustain the momentum until election day. If Bush regains his lead in most of the polls, you may be assured that he will win most battleground states the following week. 
Gore has the more formidable task in the electoral college. He must win nine of about 14 toss-up states. Election night may be decided early or late, depending if Washington and Oregon come into play. 
Given the currently "locked up" states, Gore and Bush have simple tasks. Gore must win four of the following states worth a minimum of 40 electoral votes: Tennessee, Wisconsin, Missouri, Minnesota and Washington. He must carry Pennsylvania (23). Illinois (22) and 
Michigan (18) along with New York, 
California, Maryland, New Jersey, the 
District of Columbia and Delaware. 
In New England, Gore must carry all but one state. Either Maine or New Hampshire (both worth four electoral votes) can go to Bush, but not both. And Gore must carry three of the following five states: Iowa. Oregon, Arkansas, West Virginia and New Mexico. 
This scenario concedes Florida (25), Ohio (21), Louisiana (9), Kentucky (8), Arizona (8) and Nevada (4) to Bush. However, should Gore win Florida, he could afford to lose one or two more of the "must states" listed above, but would in fact probably win the election regardless. 
Contrary to the belief that Missouri is key to the election, Pennsylvania and Michigan are absolute musts for Gore. Florida is an absolute must for Bush. For once, given that they come in accordingly, the west coast may finally determine a national election with Washington being the most crucial for Gore. Green Party candidate Halph Nader may tip that state and the election to Bush by pulling enough support from Gore. 
For political junkies, this year is heaven. For the staffs of the candidates, it has been a roller coaster ride with enough ups and downs to numb everyone. 
For me, my roller coaster will either take a huge surge upward or a depressing dive downward by the middle of next week. I will know the outcome from trending polls and subsequently watch my formula of states fall into place according­ly. My hope is that next week I can use the other famous Bob Prince line describing a Pirate homerun, "You can kiss it good­bye."

POLITICAL FACE-OFF 
Differing approaches to utilize our armed forces 
Using the military to uphold American values 
The United States flag and all that it represents embody what it means to be American. As if the very words were ingrained in our hearts and minds, gen­erations of Americans have willingly sac­rificed their lives to uphold the sacred Clayton values we profess

Democrats

these universal rights of justice, freedom and unity are denied to humanity, the United States must act to restore them. Just as the United States remained a beacon of democracy against communism during the 20th Century, the United States must now continue to stand for justice in today's post-Cold War world. 
Throughout the last century, the global community and the United States has striven to create the mechanisms neces­sary to promote and uphold basic human rights of justice, freedom and security through the establishment of the United Nations, scores of nuclear treaties, strategic alliances and democratically elected governments. With the rise ofter­rorism and civil conflicts since the col­lapse of the Soviet Union, these mecha­nisms have undergone strain and in some cases collapsed. Without skillful leadership, the United States and the planet may witness further destabiliza­tion and conflict. Vice President Gore is determined to strengthen these organiza­tions and treaties in order to uphold American values. 
The United States is the unequivocal leader or the world, both economically and militarily. lfthose facing genocide in Kosovo and regional violence in the Congo are helpless to end their plight and restore justice, why isn't the responsibili­ty of the United States and other wealthy nations to see that human suffering ends? Vice President Gore believes that United States advancement of peace and security in the Balkans may not serve to protect U.S. economic interests. but that it does uphold democracy, establish jus­tice and most importantly, prevent human suffering while in the process honoring America and all its citizens. 
George W. Bush has continually assert­ed that the U.S. military should only be used to defend vital national interests. To Bush, our vital interests do not include upholding the values that sparked the American Revolution; instead, they simply entail the monetary values that drive Wall Street. By criticiz­ing U.S. involvement in regions outside of its strategic economic interests, Bush fails in promoting cherished American values of freedom and justice. By having the United States ignore ethnic cleansing and violations of basic human rights. Bush disregards American values that he claims to uphold. 
Additionally, Bush, who has never served his country in the armed forces, claims that U.S. military involvement in peacekeeping missions degrades the mili­tary's ability to fight war. General Montgomery Meigs, the commander of 
U.S. Army troops in Europe, and Vice President Gore believe that these mis­sions provide invaluable training for our armed forces. "You're getting a core of young leaders in the Army who are very tough and experienced," states Gen. Meigs, "and that is worth its weight in gold." 
Vice President Gore will uphold the nuclear treaties that the U.S. has signed and has upheld for over 30 years and still push for the develop­ment of a National Missile Defense {NMD). These treaties have assured the continual reduction of nuclear weapons on earth and have kept nuclear weapons from devastating humanity for over 45 years. Vice President Gore understands that a NMD is needed to protect the United States from missile attacks by rogue states but at the same time understands the importance of the system of treaties that has helped to avert nuclear war. Bush calls for a massive NMD that would require the U.S. to disregard nuclear treaties and in the process re-ignite a global nuclear arms race. 
Finally, without innovation and adaptation, the U.S. military may find itself unprepared for the future of armed conflicts. Peace and security for the U.S., its allies and the rest of the globe can only be maintained if the U.S. dedicates itself towards adapting the mil­itary to the crises that occur in the world today. The vice president dedicates $127 billion more than the current amount towards defense spending in his budget plan to ensure U.S. security. With his extensive tax cuts draining the national budget, Bush only allocates $45 billion. 
Vice President Gore understands the importance of maintaining our global 
. military presence through peacekeeping, while Bush claims it threatens our national defense. The vice president believes in honoring our nuclear arms reduction treaties. Bush simply casts them aside. Above all, Bush does not uphold the values he claims to represent. Vice President Gore believes in America's commitment to upholding American val­ues across the globe and does not shy 
· away from protecting life and preventing human suffering.

2003, the Chinese military will have the capacity to overpower the United States. The next Chief Executive Officer must 
be ready to take action, while also protecting the best interests of the nation domestically. 
Governor George W. Bush is the best candidate to manage such a task. 
Governor Bush sees U.S. for­eign policy and military defense as more than managing a cri­sis. His plans include peace­keeping efforts and establishing stronger alliances in world the­atres. He will present an amended version of the Anti­Ballistic Missile Treaty, which came out of Cold War resolution 
efforts, to Russia, allowing the i/ _ establishment of anti-ballistic · ' 'l' missiles in world theatres for 
~ peacekeeping efforts. By increas­ing assistance to Russia in dis­mantling weapons, he hopes to protect the Baltics, Caucasus and Central Asia from potential Russian 
imperialism. Also, he will work with European and Asian allies to work with the transitions in China and Russia. 
Peace in the Middle East and Persian Gulf is of key importance, especially in securing Israel. He will deter aggres­sion against the Republic of Korea, while strengthening security ties with Japan. Also, Governor Bush will increase trade and investment in India, aiding their security and stability with­out undermining ties with Pakistan . Most importantly, he will insist on con­sistent direction of NATO for its effi­ciency. 
Vice President Al Gore, in the current administration, has cut military support and aid to the Defense and Veterans' Affairs departments. Defense spending has decreased 40 percent, dropping to the lowest percentage of the GNP since 1940. While decreasing spending, Vice President Gore has increased deploy­ment on average of one new deploy­ment every nine weeks. Also, the cur­rent administration spends defense funds imprudently, investing in outdat­ed equipment that cannot compete with the capabilities of other countries. 
The enlisted members of the military are also dissatisfied with the current conditions. There is a 13 percent gap between civilian and military pay, and an estimated 12,000 members of the military are on food stamps. A 1999 GAO report states that over 500 of the surveyed enlisted planned on leaving after their current term,

At the beginning of the current administration, 85 per­cent of the Air Force was considered at the best level of performance, while at the beginning of this year, only 65 per­cent was at this level. 
Similarly, the Navy faced an estimat­ed decline of 18,000 personnel in 1999, and had to cut back in training and maintenance due to a lack of funding. In June of 1999, the Navy and Army ROTC _programs faced their fifth con­secutive year of failing commissioning requirements. 
The Army faced a decline of 6,700 personnel in 1999. The retiring Commander of the U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf states that it will be diffi­cult to conduct operations on the scale of the 1991 Gulf War. In April, the Army Chief of Staff stated that he did not have a fully "C~l" army, meaning that it could not "undertake the full wartime mission for which it is orga­nized and designed." All of these short­comings result from the current advise­ment of Vice President Gore in the cur­rent administration. 
Governor Bush will restore the morale of the military by better sup­porting and respecting it. He will only enact deployments with well-defined objectives, while focusing on the American homeland. Also, he will insist on its mobility, swiftness and stealth, especially in the transfer and acquisi­tion of information and intelligence. On land, Governor Bush will demand lighter, more lethal deployments. Naval reforms will surface in smaller platforms and arsenal ships with long range missiles. Reviews of air strikes capabilities will be necessary. A one billion dollars per year increase to the military pay raise will give active duty service members a $750 increase, while also working on housing renova­tions and training improvements. 
Governor Bush is well-prepared to undertake these gravely important issues, while Vice President Gore still struggles to give hope to protecting the nation.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Urging students to exercise their right to vote 
I think Erin English made a very good point in her letter yesterday entitled "Candidates failing to address young voters." She said politicians most likely don't try to address issues rnlevant to our generation because we don't vote. And she's absolutely right. 
Look at it from the politican's point of view. Why should they spend valuable time. money and energy trying to implement our concerns into their platforms and trying to market to us when we, as a demographic group, don't vote? Why should they worry about us when we don't make or break an election? 
This puts us in a Catch-22 situation. Politicians don't listen to us because we don't vote; consequently, we don't vote because politicans continue to ignore us. 
We can end this vicious cycle by casting ballots. If we vote, they'll listen, and we'll have a voice in the future of this country. The initiative lies with us. Get out and vote this November!

Behind the scenes of 
The men in yellow 

By JACQUELINE BROWDER 
Assiscanr Scene Ediroc 
They take our tickets, direct us to our seats and ensure that students main­tain well-behaved conduct while cheering for the Irish. They'll even clean up after us when we've had an untimely "parting" with our tailgate lunches. 
They're the guys in the bright yellow jackets. 
But what is the true role of a Notre Dame usher? Notre Dame boasts one of the largest crowd management programs in the country, uti­lizing 850 ushers each home game. 
While mo.st stadiums our size have between 350-400 ushers. Notre Dame is fortu­nate to have 550 unpaid ush­ers. They willingly serve in this role for the opportunity to be part of the Notre Dame experience. 
Ushers must arrive 30 min­utes before gate opening for a pre-game training session and come an additional hour early for the home opener. They work the Blue and Gold game, used as a training game and observe a dress code, wearing a white shirt, neckwear, dress slacks and exhibiting good grooming. They are also subject to a 

code of conduct, which is described under the larger heading of being an "Ambassador for Notre Dame." 
"We have an outstanding corps of ushers," said Cappy Gagnon, coordinator of stadi­um personnel. "We get many compliments for our enforce­ment of rules, such as our zero tolerance policy for alcohol, profanity or smok­ing, which is designed to pro­duce a family atmosphere. 
"We have ushers from a very diverse background. We have more than 100 ushers with more than 20 years experience. We have five ushers with more than 50 years experience. We even have one usher, hired by Knute Rockne, in 1926 when he was a 12 year old Boy Scout," s a i d Gagnon. 
T h e ushers h e I p p r o ­v i d e every f a n with t h e won­der­ful atmosphere in the stadi­um that so many people look forward to when visiting Notre Dame. They come early, leave late and spend countless hours working behind the scenes so that you can enjoy watching the Irish. 
So, this weekend, when you walk (or stumble. as the case may be) into the Stadium. be sure to thank the ushers for their hard work and commit­ment to the University. They've earned it. 




Taking out the tailgaters' trash 
By TAI ROMERO 
Scene Writer 
From the bowels of Notre Dame's stadium lurks a power stronger than a stadium crowd of 80,000 fans. With 80 arms and strength enough to clear 17 tons of trash off the street, this super human force has but one task-to beautify our campus. 
Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No! It's the crew. of Great Lakes Property Maintenance, pro­tecting the Notre Dame parking lots and sta­dium from the constant threat of Trash Man, an intimidating pile of a villain. Combating this awesome beast is a seasonal job. In fact, the beast only rears its gruesome head on home football game days. 
Have no fear students; Great Lakes Property Maintenance has the ultimate plan to prevent Trash Man from overtaking the campus and using his garbage super powers to turn students into mulch for a compost heap. The mastermind behind the Great Lakes Property Maintenance is Hichard Stein, who explains the steps with which he and his crew tackle Trash Man and his evil ways. 
First, the crew fights the big pieces of litter 
in the parking lots while emptying the trash 
barrels filled by Trash Man's greatest ally ... 
tailgaters. Next 15 crew members, affection­
ately termed pickers. do their part in battle 
by sweeping the parking lots after the party­
ing tailgaters' retreat. The pickers have to 
brave such feats as clearing the lots of five t 0

campus and more. But what make 

Lastly the Great Lakes Property Maintenance fights battle on the final fron­tier, the Notre Dame Stadium. Here, the crew must deal with the annoyance of plastic cups. leftover food, food wrappers and those ever-poJU.Ilar marshmallow remains in the student section. Using backpack blowers, the crew suppresses Trash Man into 700 garbage bags, weighing 10 pounds each. 
Great Lakes Property Maintenance has been whooping Trash Man's booty in the parking lots for six years and in the Stadium for three. Being the victor against Trash Man is not all fun and games. though. Being on the prowl for an evil villain can occupy six to eight hours on Saturdays and Sundays. In addition. the good guy misses the action of the football game. 
Students should appreciate the efforts of Great Lakes Property Maintenance and their trash fight­ing crew. After all, without their hard work, the students would be forced daily to brave a waste­land of trash and lamb carcasses -not the pris­tine grounds they've become accustomed to tra­versing.

ND football weekend 
By AMANDA GRECO Scene Editor 
With the drone of cars and the ringing of the reg­
ister in the background, Rich Motz, tollbooth plaza 
supervisor for the Notre Dame exit. recreated the 
home game tollbooth experience. "It's really a very enjoyable time," Rich said as he gave a traveller his change. Traffic for home games increases as early as 
Thursday, but the plaza workers usher between 
7,000 and 10,000 cars past their booths on 
Saturday alone. This int1ux forces Motz to double 
his normal staff. Surprisingly, though, there is no lack of enthusiastic workers to cover the shifts. "Employees come from as far as East Point and Portage to work the games. They really do enjoy it." So what makes it so much fun? The enthusiasm of 
the fans. "It's such an enjoy­able atmosphere," 
Motz said. "Everyone is honking and 
cheering with flags on their cars and painted faces, hang­ing out t h e win ­dows y e I ­l i TI g. I t isn't rare that p e o ­p l e w i I 1 moon 
y O U , 
too." 


Toiling at the tollbooth 
Even the travellers seem to enjoy the .... plaza scene. Rumor has it that people who have exited at the Mishawaka plaza -while perfectly capable of reaching the stadium -will turn around to go back to the Notre Dame exit just so they can wait in line with all the rest of the fans. 
"Some people have never been on a toll road before," employee Kristi Franklin ­said. "When you ask them for their tick­et, they'll hand you their football ticket." 
Franklin went on to regale many inter­esting tales gained only from the vantage point of her tollbooth throne. 
"You think it's dull, but you sec all sorts of things working here," she said. 
"There are people in search of the nud­ist colony who drive through completely naked and smiling. One woman gave birth at the tollbooth. And sometimes you will catch people in 'compromising' posi­tions," she said laughing. "Often people offer coffee and doughnuts to us." 
But travellers aren't always so kind. Irate fans after Notre Dame's loss to Nebraska doused Franklin in a mixture of pop and beer. The tollbooth employ­ees' work doesn't end once the fans take their seats in the stadium. The workers need to keep their eye on the game from their booths. ... 
"If it's a blow away game, people will start leaving at half-time, so we need to switch the lanes to accommodate the traffic," Motz explained. Once the game has ended, it takes between three to four hours to give everyone their ticket and 
. pass them on to their final destinations. 
After the game, the energy levels have changed. It's easy to tell the winners from the losers, and no one seems to

lrt all possible? 
Scene Writer 

Few visitors leave a Notre Dame football week­end without a souvenir, and for many. that means the game program. While most students pass up buying a program, citing its $5 cost, m.,i,ny visitors and parents look at its glossy pages as a chance to remember their experience on campus. 
Lisa Nelson. publications coordinator for the sports information department, is charged with the task of putting together each week's program. After collecting articles. some written by students. she works with Host Communications to produce the issue. The program is proofread eight times, six by Nelson herself. 
Most of the issue is done two weeks in advance, but Nelson must update the rosters and injury report for each issue, and also include information on the previous week's game. 
Nelson and the Sports Information department begin work on the program each July, when they create the general section about Notre Dame, with factoids about the campus and information about previous football teams. 
Programs! Programs! Get your programs! 
For those fans who don't want to drop a Lincoln on the program at the game, many articles are available on the sports information Web site. 
After Nelson completes her at times arduous task of organizing the program, Host Communications prints up, on average, 20,000 copies for each weekend's game, for a grand total of 120,000 for the season. Nelson explained that the number of programs printed varies by game. This weekend's Air Force game will see only 16,000 programs distributed, while the show­down with Nebraska saw 32,000 sold. 
After printing. the program sellers pick up boxes of programs at the stadium on Friday, before venturing out on Saturday morning to screech "Program, get your program!" 
Program sellers range in age. and some seem to be just barely young enough to haul around their allotment of programs. "I saw this one kid who was just hurting lifting a box of programs," said sophomore Kevin Heffernan. "That kid needed to eat some serious vegetables." 
Despite the stress that comes with such a mas­sive undertaking, Nelson said her reward was "to know that on Saturday, thousands of people will read something I helped put together."

.. - Chris Pranger celebrated his new contract extension with a goal and two assists, and Scott Young scored twice to become the first player to reach the 10­goal mark as the St. Louis Blues beat the Calgary Flames 4-3 Th11rsday night. Pranger, who won the Hart Trophy and the Norris Trophy last year, agreed to a three-year extension earlier in the day. He befan paying dividends immedi­ately by scoring the game's first go~.l and the adding assists on goals by Young and Al Macinnis. Young entered the game tied with four other players for first in the NHL with eight goals. He reached double digits in a 1 :33 spa.n of the second period by tipping home a Pierre Turgeon pass on a break-in, and then banging in the rebound of Pronger's shot from the point. Brent Johnson made 18 saves for St. Louis. which has won all four games its played at the Savvis Center. The Blues have Jost once in seven games since dropping their season opener in Phoenix. Cnry Stillman scored twice for the Flames. Phil Housley had the other Calgary goal. St. Louis led 4-1 going into the third period, but Stillman scored at 8:03 and then again at 17:41 to make it a one-goal  izer. The Blues took the lead 10:47 into the game when Pronger broke out of the penalty box and carried a pass from Craig Conroy down the left wing. Pranger then beat Calgary's Mike Vernon with a snap shot from the left circle for his sec­ond goal. Young made it 3-0 early in the second period. He scored his first goal of the game at 5:49 when he split the defense and directed Macinnis' pass home. With the Blues on the power play, Young blasted the rebound of Pronger's slap shot by Vernon at the 7:22 mark. After Housley cut it to 3-1 at 8:26, Macinnis scored his first goal on a slap shot 55 seconds later while the Flames were two men short. Avalanche 2, Blackhawks 0 Tip to NHL teams. If you need to give your No. 1 goaltender a night off, do it against the Chicago Blackhawks. Colorado's Patrick Roy rested and David Aebischer became the fourth backup this season to beat the Blackhawks as the Avalanche stayed unbeaten through 10 games. In just his second NHL start, Aebischer record his first shutout, stopping 18 shots against the anemic Blackhawk  goalie Jocelyn Thibault was screened by teammate Kevin Dean. Alex Tanguay's power play goal less than two minutes into the second period put the Avalanche (8-0-2) up 2-0. Chicago had a first-period goal by Stepahne Quintal wiped out when Michael Nylander was called for a crosscheck in the crease. Flyers 3, Rangers 0 Michal Sykora scored his first goal in two years and Brian Boucher made 32 saves as the Philadelphia Flyers beat the New York Rangers. It was Philadelphia's second victory over the Rangers in three days. The Flyers snapped a seven-game winless streak with a 5-4 victory over New York on Tuesday. The Rangers have lost five of their last six games. Rick Tocchet also scored for Philadelphia. Dayrnond Langkow added an empty-net goal. Sykora, who spent the last two seasons playing in the Czech Republic, gave the Flyers a 1-0 lead 7:07 into the game when he one-timed a crossing pass from Paul Ranheim just inside the far post. Sykora's last goal came on Nov. 8, 1998, when he played for Tampa Bay.  recently. He allowed 14 goals in his previous three starts, and was yanked in his last two starts at home. After failing to stop several shots during a practice drill on Wednesday, Boucher smashed · his stick over the crossbar in anger. He made a couple nice stops in the final minutes when New York pulled its goalie during a power-play for a 6-on-4 advan­tage. Boucher, the first rookie in 50 years to allow less than two goals a game last season, saw his goals-against average dip to 3.83 from 4.52 after the shutout. Tocchet made it 2-0 by beat­ing Rangers goalie Mike Richter with a backhander 5:21 into the third period. Philadelphia outshot New York 17-9 in the third period. The Rangers entered the game with the league's best power play unit on the road, but went 0-for-5 with the man-advan­tage. The Flyers squandered a five­m in u te power play after Eric Lacroix nailed Justin Williams into the boards midway through the first. LaCroix was called for boarding and received a game misconduct. Philadelphia's best chance on the power play came when Eric Desjardins hit the far post on a  Bruins 4, Capitals 1 Mike Keenan won his first game as coach of the Boston Bruins, as Jason Allison scored twice and Andrew Raycroft stopped 27 shots in a victory over Washington on. P.J. Axelsson and Mikko Eloranta also scored for Boston, which had lost four straight after opening the season 3-0-1. Craig Billington stopped 39 shots, and Joe Sacco scored for Washington. The Bruins fired Pat Burns on Wednesday -just eight games into his fourth season with the team. Boston is Keenan's sixth NHL club, and the man they call "Iron Mike" promised to turn things around quickly, as he has in three of his five previous stops. But Keenan inherited a team that didn't respond to Burns, who is himself no slouch as a motivator. Thursday's victory may have had more to do with the opponent: The Capitals dropped to just 1-4-3 with the loss. Burns was right about one thing: Joe Murphy is a discipline problem. The Washington for­ward was released by Boston last season for insubordination after getting in to a shouting match with Burns during a game.

Add in Bulls' rookies AJ Guyton. Jake Voskuhl and Dalibor Bagaric and third-year Pacers' player Bruno Sundov (who was Irish center Ivan Kartelo's teammate at the Winchendon School in Massachusetts) and more than 1 /3 of last night's participanl'i 1;,re under 23. 
The oldest player, Voskuhl (who turns 23 Wednesday), also made a return trip to the Joyce Center. A teammate of El-Amin 

... 1:.t UConn, Voskuhl was subjeci.­1:-d to several taunts from stu­dents in la.st season's game. Among the signs: "Troy Murphy: All-American. Jake Voskuhl: Fairy Princess." "Not trying to sound arrogant but it was normally a big game for the opposing team [when they played against the Huskies) so we were used to it." said \'oskuhl. referring to last year's game. "It's over and done with so who cares?" Apparently the fans on Thursday night. Voskuhl. who still has the long blonde hair and "surfer" look, entered the game with 6:45 left in the fourth quarter amidst a scattering of coos from the neutral crowd. Now a lowly NBA rookie, \'oskuhl has other things to worry about. His duties include carrying the veterans' bags and providing Krispy Kreme glazed donuts at practice. 
If he does not oblige to the demands of older teammates. Voskuhl is punished with a "'silly fine." The "silly fines" are listed on a piece of paper in an enve­lope containing the rookies' meal money and are deducted from the check. 
''One guy farted on the court one day," Voskuhl recalled. "And that got one of the veter­ans upset, so they fined him 50 bucks." 
Among the "veterans" on the young Bulls' squad is Artest. As a freshman at SL John's, Artest led the Red Storm to a 79-69 victory against the Irish at the Joyce Center. He left school after two years and was selected 16th overall in the 1999 draft. Artest expected to be a lottery pick, an experience that helped him understand the "business" of the NBA. He hopes to contin­ue with the Bulls but knows there are no guarantees. 
"You never know in this busi­ness." Artest said. "It's crazy. I've seen a lot of funny things happen." 
Another "funny thing" Artest has seen in the last year has been the development of Notre Dame's Troy Murphy. Coming out of high school in New York City, Artest was a "can't-miss" prospect while Murphy, a New Jersey native. was a relative unknown. 
"l didn't know he would be this good," said Artest, who attended the Five-Star camp with Murphy during high school. "Elton [Brand] and me always talk about that. We're like, Troy Murphy? But he's got a lot of heart. 
"Really nobody can guard him. Nobody." 
That includes Harrington. When Harrington and Murphy last played together, the unher­alded Murphy upstaged the nation's top player (Harrington) in the 19-and-under MU 
National tournament. 
"He played unbelievable," 
Harrington said. "And I might 
have played my worst game 
ever. Ile left that last impression 
on n1e." 
Harrington, who also played high school ball in New Jersey, met with Murphy before Thursday night's game. The two 20-year olds reminisced for awhile and Harrington gave the Irish star another vote of' confi­dence. 
"I'm projecting he's going to score 25 [points] and 12 [rebounds per game]," Harrington said. "He's dominat­ing college ball." 
The same cannot be said for Harrington in the pros. He aver­aged just 6.6 points per game last season but expects to see more playing time in 2000. Last night, he scored nine points and grabbed five rebounds in 30 minutes. 
Brand (26 points and 16 rebounds), Bender (19 points) and Artest (10 points) seem to have adapted to the pro game better than the other young players. 
But the future looks bright for the members of the 22-and under club, including El-Amin. 
Although he saw no action last night. El-Amin, a second-round pick signed a contract with Chicago on Oct. 2. He may not play much this season and has yet to play in a regular season game. 
But he has already learned the most overused cliche in profes­sional sports. 
'Tm not in it for the money," El-Amin said. Welcome to the NBA, Khalid.

WORLD SERIES 
Yankees defeat Mets, win third-straight Series title 
There's more than one road to success. 
j 
-


Associated Press 
Best in their own back yard, best in all of baseball. 
The New York Yankees, thought to be too old and too banged-up to make it this far, became the first team in more than a quarter-century to win three straight World Series championships, beating the New York Mets 4-2 Thursday night. 
Luis Sojo, one of many mid­season pickups, hit a two-out, tiebreaking single off Al Leiter in the ninth inning to decide Game 5, stunning a Shea Stadium crowd that was sure there was more baseball to play. 
The Subway Series turned out to be a short ride for New York fans who had waited 44 years for another one and hoped it would go seven games. Instead, the Yankees quickly matched the Oakland Athletics' three in a row from 1972-74, and won their fourth title in five years. 

Only two other runs in base­ball history can compare -Joe DiMaggio led the Yankees to five crowns from 19 36-41, and Mickey Mantle helped take the Bronx Bombers to six titles from 1947-53. 
And while the lasting image of this Series is certain to be Roger Clemens throwing the bat at Mike Piazza, this is the picture the Yankees will prefer to savor: Owner George Steinbrenner hoisting another big piece of hardware for the team's trophy case. 
Game Four hero Derek Jeter, who earned his fourth ring at only 26 and was selected Series MVP, and slumping Bernie Williams homered for the Yankees. But it was Sojo, who blossomed into a good-luck charm after rejoining the Yanks from Pittsburgh on Aug. 7, who deliverfld thfl winning hit. 
-

Leiter battled all night, and struck out the first two batters in the ninth. Then he walked Jorge Posada and gave up a single to Scott Brosius, and Sojo followed by slapping a single up the middle on Leiter's 142nd and final pitch. Another run scored on the play when center fielder Jay Payton's throw home hit Posada and bounded into the Mets dugout. 
Leiter remained winless in 11 postseason starts, while Mike Stanton won in relief of Andy Pettitte. Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth for a save. 
At the stroke of midnight, Piazza flied out to the edge of the warning track in center field with a runner on base to finish it. 
The Yankees fans in the sell­out crowd of 55,292 went wild after having been outshouted all evening. 
Even with so much at stake, there was room to have a little fun, with a broken bat, no less. 
Kurt Abbott shattered his bat on a foul ball in the Mets fourth, and the jagged barrel skittered out toward Jeter at shortstop. 
With the crowd starting to hoot, mindful of the Clemens Piazza encounter in Game Two, Jeter made a nice show in defusing any hint of trouble. Ile fielded the broken piece with his glove, laughed and handed it to a Mets batboy. 
While Jeter and Williams hit the solo homers for the Yankees, the Mets scraped out two runs that left it tied at two through the seventh. 
Williams put the Yankees ahead 1-0 when he homered leading off the second. The 
-

cleanup man had been O-for-15 through four games and hitless in his last 22 Series at-bats overall. 
Trying to ensure that the skid was behind him, he singled and walked his next two times up. 
Jeter, who homered on the first pitch of the game the pre­vious night, made it two-all by hitting a shot into the Yankees' left-field bullpen in the sixth off Leiter. 
The Mets had to work much harder for their runs. 
Bubba Trammell, starting because of his career success against Pettitte, walked with one out in the second and Payton singled. The runners moved up on a groundout and Leiter, an .053 hitter this sea­son, dragged a perfect bunt past the mound. 
First baseman Tino Martinez bobbled the ball for a moment and made an underhanded flip to Pettitte, but the pitcher dropped the throw. Pettitte was charged with an error, denying an RBI to Leiter, who had none this year, but a run scored and the Mets were satisfied. 
Benny Agbayani followed with a slow roller that third baseman Brosius tried to play with his bare hand. but the ball escaped his grasp and went for an RBI single that gave the Mels a 2-1 lead. 
Pettitte helped himself with his second pickoff of the Series, trapping a wandering Abbott off first in the fourth.

WOMEN'S INTERHALL PLAYOFFS 
Crime looks to steal victory from No. 7 Bullfrogs 


By SUSIE CARPENTER and. 
LIA MILHOAN 
Sports Writers 
When Badin and Off-Campus faced off earlier this season, the game resulted in a 12-12 tie. The two compete in the first round of playoff action this weekend. 
"We've been waiting for an opportunity at redemption after our poor performance in our first meeting with Badin," Off-Campus coach Paul Diamantopoulos said. 
Seeded No. 1 in their league and number two in the play­offs, Off-Campus is considered the favorite. However, Diamantupoulos does not place much importance on the rank­
ings.  
"I believe that you can never feel  "We've been waiting for an opportunity at

"However, I  
feel that our team knows  Paul Diamantopoulos  
what it takes  Off-Campus head coach  
to  win  and  
they will do  

their best to accomplish this is in order to get to the stadium this year." 
The Off-Campus Crime have be·en effective both offensively and defensively this season, allowing only two touchdowns. 
Diamantopoulos attributes their success, not to a few star players, but to the raw talent and cohesiveness of the entire team. 
"I can't really single out any individual player because Off­Campus truly is a team," he said. "No matter what the situ­ation, the majority of the girls give it their best each and every play even through injuries and fowl weather." 
"We have a smaller roster, but we are a solid core group of girls," co-captain Katie Leicht added. 
Throughout the season, the Badin offense had been suc­cessful at moving the ball down the field, but had diffi­culty scoring touchdowns. 
"We had a lot of chances to score but we didn't," co-cap­tain, Tiffney Colon said. 
Despite their previous hard­ships, the Bullfrogs came away with a victory in their last game. The offense capitalized at the end of their drives, and the defense, who has remained strong all season. held. Coach Anthony Pilcher hopes to use the momentum from that last game into this weekend's game. 
"Everything just clicked for us in that game," he said. "We have good momentum going into the playoffs." 
Badin is undaunted by its seventh seed. Coach Brett Gansen is optimistic about Sunday's game. 
"We know we can compete at the same level as they are," he said. "If we play well, we have a good shot [at beating Off-Campus]." 
Senior quarterback, Prissy Clements looks to lead the offense to another win. On the defensive side of the ball. strong safety Suzie Schwaab, who averaged 10 batted down balls per game, could be a force to be reckoned with. 
"She is as good as anyone in the league in at her position," Pilcher said 
Both Off-Campus and Badin said that they have designed new plays in order to be effec­tive offensively and to be domi­nant defensively. With eyes only for the stadium. neither wants Sunday's game to be the last of the year. 
Cavanaugh vs. Howard 
On Sunday, the Chaos of Cavanaugh square off against inter­division rival Howard Hall in a 3 p.m. first round playoff game at the McGlinn fields. 
Cavanaugh and Howard last played on Sept. 28, with Cavanaugh coming away with a 13-0 regular sea­

son victory. 
"We're excited to play Cavanaugh," Howard coach Brad Untiedt said. "We think we have improved since we faced them in the regular sea­son, so it should be a good match up for the playoffs." 
Howard enters the playoffs on a high note after defeating last year's runner up, Pasquerilla East, in its final regular season game. The Ducks enter the playoffs with a 3-3 overall record. 
The Ducks will look to quar­terback Jill Veselik and fresh­man receiver Elizabeth Klimek to have strong games as the duo has hooked up for many of Howard's big plays throughout· the season. 
Cavanaugh returns to the playoffs once again. Last sea­son the Chaos advanced to the semifinals before losing to Pasquerilla East. Cavanaugh rounded out the regular sea­son with a win over Lewis Hall and brings a 5-1 overall record into the Sunday's game. 
"We think that if we practice hard and then keep our heads in the game we can come away with a win," senior captain Amy Szestak said. "Howard is a tough team and we will have to play well to win." 
"We have played well this year and hope to make it to the stadium," Chaos coach Bart Bruckert said. "Howard played well against us last time and they have a really good quarterback [Jill Veselik]." 
The Chaos will be depending on the linemen to bring home the win. "We're working on ­the offensive and defensive lines and hoping to contain her," Bruckert said. "We need to concentrate on assignments. I think it will be a good game."

lJndefeated Welsh looks for second win against Lyons 

... 
By-COLIN BOYlAN and LAU­
REN CONTI 
Srorrs Writers 
t\ 6-0 record during the regu­lar season may have earned Welsh Family Ilall the No. 1 seed in the upcoming playoffs. but it won't get the defending champions much else this week­er.d in their first round match­u~, against Lyons. 
'I lhink its going to be a tough. close game." Lyons quarterback Sarah Jenkins said. "We certain­ly aren't intimidated by their record." 
Perhaps it won't be the memo­ry of a 6-0 record that lingers in the mind of Lyon's players as 

... they take the field. but rather. the week two regular season contest between the two teams. In that game. Welsh dominated. claiming a 20-0 victory against Lyons. "We feel we've improved a lot since the second week," Jenkins said. "Our offense is much bet­ter." For its part. Welsh has been operating on all cylinders. defeating Cavanaugh 20-2 and Howard 35-0 in its past two games to complete an undefeat­ed Blue League campaign. The strength of the team is a quick offense coupled with a slrong passing game with quar­terback Kalie Rak throwing to receivers Jen Grubb and Vanessa Lichon. "Offensively, Katie has been 
outstanding for us this year." 
Welsh coach Casey Bouton said. 
"She's familiar with all our 
returning receivers and that's 
key." 

Bouton was also quick to give credit to fourth-year defender Maria Fieldmayer, who he called "a real leader on the field." 
For Lyons (3-3). defensive backs Lisa Thomas and Lisa Chamblee will have to contain Welsh's passing game if they hope to score an upset. Offensively. Jenkins will be look­ing downfield to a receiving corps headed by freshman Roxy Trevino. 
And while the odds will defi­nitely be in Welsh's favor, no one is counting out Lyons just yet. After dropping its first three games of the season, the team rallied to win their last three and secure a playoff berth. 
"If we can beat Welsh. I think we'll have a good chance to win it all." Jenkins said. 
Welsh coach Bouton agreed. 
"We have lots of confidence in our team," he said. "But were just going to take it one game at a time and hopefully we'll end up in the stadium." 
Pasquerilla West vs. Walsh 

The Purple Weasels of Pasquerilla West will play in their first lnterha!l playoff game since the 1998 season this Sunday at 2 p.m .. when they face off against Walsh Hall's Wild Women at Stepan Fields. 
The PW Women have tweaked 
their offense and feel well pre­
pared for the challenge. 
"We've put in a lot of new plays in pr<'paration," PW offen­sive coordinator Steve Branowski said. ''We didn't make rthe playoITsJ last year. but this year we're linally breaking through." 
After a successful season, Walsh will be looking to cement this season's prowess and prove they can move further up the ranks than they did last season. In 1999, they beat the Purple Weasels 7-6 in the last game of the season to narrowly qualify for the playoffs, but lost in the first round. 
"I think we're more competi­tive this year than we were last year, and hopefully we'll get fur­ther in the playoffs," Walsh receiver Kay Scanlan said. 
"Last time we played IPW]. we tied at 0-0, and to be honest, I thought they played better than we did," he said. "In order for us to beat them, we'll have to play as well as we possibly can, but I think our offense can pick it up, and our defense was there strong last time." 
He added, "if we can beat them, I see us going far." Baranowski looks to Sunday's game with confidence. 
"Previously against Walsh, our offense moved the ball well. but we just couldn't manage to punch it into the end zone," he said. "Now, we've made a few offensive adjustments. We've put in a lot of new plays, and we're keep it very close to the vest." 

The Purple Weasels may be the team with something to prove, but the Wild Women have just as much at stake. 
"I know we all have a person­al investment in this game," Walsh quarterback Lauren Walsh said. "We have a lot of seniors on the team. it's their last year, and they really want 
it... "We're such a small team that 

every one of us plays, so if we do win, it will be because of every­body, not just a few star play­ers," she added. 
The game is shaping up to the kind of highly competitive match that should be the hallmark of Women's lnterhall playoffs this season. 
"We're pumped to actually be in the playoffs," PW captain Amanda Gallen said. "After a season with so many teams that had such close records, it should be a great postseason and a great game."

ROWING 
Irish look to star in Elkhart regatta 
ByJEFF BALTRUZAK Sports Wricer 
After a fall season full of Midwest travel, the Irish will take a short trip to Elkhart this Sunday to row in the I lead of thP. Elk regatta. Coming off a disappointing perfor­mance against Michigan State, Notre Dame hopes to gain momen­tum I.hat will carry into (he spdng season with strong finic;hes on the St. Joseph River. 
With the race so close to· home, the Irish view the Head of the Elk as the pinnacle of the fall season, a culmination of their work in previ­ous races in Chicago, Rockford and East Lansing. If racing in front of the home crowd is not enough to inspire the Irish, racing rowing powerhouse Michigan will be. 
"I would say it's a big race," sophomore rower Ashlee Warren said. "Michigan "will be there, and they've been to the NCAAs the last few years." 
"It should be interesting to see how we stack up against some of the best teams in the Midwest," she added. 
The Irish will face some new challenges this weekend besides just the 2 112 mile course. Pair rac­ing has been a source of success for Notre Dame this fall season behind the consistent rowing of Warren and her partner Becky Luckett. HowevPr. Sunday's race hll.5 no pair events. 
The open fours competition, which caused problems for the squad against Michigan State two weeks ago, will feature the first varsity eight boat divided into two four boats, with the stern four rowers competing in the A race and the bow fow· rowers in the B compPtition. 
"We haven't rowed in that par­ticular four yet,'' said Warren, who will be in the A race. "But we should be able to row together because we're just half of the eight. 
"I'm looking forward to that race, it should be pretty fast," she continued. 
As for the eights competition, the first varsity eight boat that has competP.d together the entire sea­son will stay with the same lineup 
and will be coxod by senior captain 
Clare Bula. The Irish will once 
again mix lightweight row1\rs into 
the other varsity eights. 
The regatta will feature light­weight racing, whereas the com­petition against Michigan State did not. The Irish will race two strong four boats. with Kerri Murphy. Leah Ashe, Laura Aull, Diana LaQuinta and captain coxswain Erin Kiemicki competing in the A race. 
The team will send a total of six boats of eight rowers into four dif­ferent novice eight races. 
Notre Dame's somewhat lacklus­ter team performance against Michigan State two weekends ago has yielded some positives for the Irish. 
"If anything, it provided more motivation for this week," Warren said. "It will push us faster." 
Plenty is at stake for the Irish rowers in Elkhart, with conse­quences for the later in the year. 
"Its important for us to have a strong performance when we go into winter training and the spring season." Warren said. "We're excited about how we've started."

MEN'S INTERHALL PLAYOFFS 
Alulllni hopes to secure revenge against Keenan Sunday 
By JAMES VERALI and TODD 
NIETO 
Sport> Wrirers 
The Keenan Knights are hop­ing for a replay as they take on the Alumni Dawgs in the first round of the playoff.<; Sunday. 
Keenan comes in as the 4th seed with a 3-1 record. Alumni took the filth seed in the playoffs and also finished with a 3-1 mark. 
In week three of the regular season, the Knights blanked the Oawgs 13-0 in a very impressive performance. However. repeat­ing that performance will be a diflicult task. 
"The second time you play a team is always harder than the first," Keenan quarterback Billy Ellsworth said. 
"They will make the necessary adjustments from the first game. we will need to notice the adjustments and make some 

ourselves," Brian Kunitzcr added. 
Both teams finished off the regular season with a win and feel very confident, especially on the defensive side of the ball. With two strong defenses, the game will turn on which defense fa! Is first. 
Linebacker Bailey Siegfried, who has come through with many key plays throughout tho season to help the Dawgs shut out three of their four oppo­nents, leads the "Oawgy O." 
Tho Keenan defense has already shut out the Alumni offense. 
Offensively, both teams will look to their offensive lines to lead the way.

face off against the Keenan passing attack that is led by the connection between Ellsworth and wide out John Hussy. 
Both teams feel that they have something to prove from last year's disappointments. After running the tabli:l last year in the regular season, Alumni's hopes of winning the title were dashed in an early, unexpected playoff exit. 
The Knights lost to Sorin in the second round of the playoffs last year for their first playoff loss in three seasons, ending their string of back-to-back championships. 
One thing is for sure; lack of intensity won't be a problem out on Stepan field Sunday. Both teams know that they can win, but are also aware that it is going to take a valiant effort on both sides of the ball to advance to the next round. 
"It will be our toughest game of the year," said Kunitzer. 
When asked what it's going to take to beat Keenan this week, Alumni tailback Alex Roodhouse responded, "Ask them after we run all over them on Sunday." 
Dillon vs. Stanford

The bone-crushing action of interhall football has returned to Notre Dame after a weeklong fall break. Sunday in the first round of the playoffs, the Dillon 
Bulldogs will face off against the Griffins of Stanford at 1 p.m. at the Stepan Fields in a game that is sure to get the adrenaline pumping. 
The Bulldogs have dominated interhall football, posting an impressive 4-0 record. Dillon has a strong lineup that includes quarterback Tate Odom, line­man Joe Parker. defensive end Rick Hasty and running back Chris Crane. 
"We played Stanford at the beginning of the season but we l have both improved since the -lIbeginning of the season," Jason

Visner said. "It is going to be a

Stanford comes into Sunday's I I game with a 2-2 record. The I I Griffins are looking towards tail­I I back J.C. Perez, guard/defensive tackle Josh Caakua. and wide receiver/cornerback Corey Hartmann to provide the team with the key plays needed to beat Dillon.

NBA 
Stern explains penalties levied on Timberwolves 
Associated Press 
MINNEAPOLIS 

NBA commissioner David 
Stern  said  Thursday  that  
"shocking"  fraud  by  the  
Minnesota  Timb-erwolves  

forced him to inflict record punishment over a secret con­tract for star forward Joe Smith. 
Stern stripped the Wolves of five first-round draft choices and fined the team $3.5 mil­lion for the agreement. which an arbitrator found was 
intended to circumvent the NBA salary cap. "The fact is, we gave this a lot more thought than the 

parties in t h e Minnesota franchise who risked their future by engag­ing in one of the most far-reach­
Smith ing frauds 
w e ' v e 
seen," Stern said. 

"This was a fraud of major Stern's punishment of the proportions. There were no Wolves could include one-year fewer than five undisclosed suspensions for owner Glen

Taylor and 

o t h e r Timberwolves officials, possi­bly including vice president Kevin McHale and coach Flip Saunders, to determine whether they will be suspend­ed. 
At halftime of Minnesota's exhibition game with Detroit on Thursday night, Taylor apologized to Minnesotans and accepted full responsibili­ty. He said he did not realize when he made the agreement that he was breaking rules of the collective bargaining agreement and said unusual circumstances were involved that he would not reveal. 
"There are always reaso,ns why things happen," Taylor said. "They're not as simple as they seem." 
The NBA said the fine was the stiffest ever imposed by the league on any franchise, player or other individual and the maximum allowed. Spokesman Brian McIntyre also said he could not recall any team being stripped of multiple draft choices. 
It's the loss of draft choices that is particularly damaging to a franchise that will be at or near the top of the salary cap as long as it is carrying forward Kevin Garnett's $126 million contract through 2004. Without draft picks or the ability to pursue high-priced free agents, manage­ment will have little room to bulk up the roster around Garnett. 
"We'll still want to field good teams," Taylor said. "It'll be harder, more difficult. We always recognized we were in a small market and it would always be more diffi­cult to attract good players. We'll have to be lucky. I
...'====================~-=-=-=..;;;..:.=.=..:.=.=.=.=.=_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:______________, teams such as Dallas and the 

understand that." The job might be tougher than Taylor suggested. 
"I was reading across the page and the draft picks just kept going." New York Knicks general manager Scott Layden said. "The money is probably the least of the penalty, but collectively it shows that the commissioner is not soft on circumvention." 
At a team shootaround Thursday morning, Saunders said the Wolves were used to dealing with adversity. 
"We've been through a lot in the last five years," he said. "We were written off when we lost Googs [Tom Gugliotta] and Stephon [Marbury]. We won 50 games when a lot of people didn't think we could." 
Saunders said he didn't know whether the Wolves would appeal the penalties. 
Garnett said the ruling would not affect whether he stays with the Wolves when his contract expires. 
"It's very, very easy to jump ship when things get hard," Garnett said. "It's very, very easy to start thinking differ­ently. I'm not that type of per­son. I'm a loyal cat. I do know that running from your prob­lems will not solve problems." 
NBA arbitrator Kenneth Dam ruled Monday that the Timberwolves signed a secret agreement with Smith in January 1999 that was worth as much as $86 million over seven years. With the NBA,. meanwhile, the Timberwolves filed a one-year contract worth $1.7 5 million, allow­able under the salary cap. 
Stern said he abided by the arbitrator's ruling when he voided Smith's current $2.5 million contract and his past two contracts with the Timberwolves, preventing Smith from signing a lucrative contract with them after this season. 
Though Smith has said he would like to re-sign with the Timberwolves, NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik said the arbitrator's ruling also would allow Stern to void a contract if Smith re-signed. 
Smith's future remained uncertain Wednesday, though 
Knicks have expressed inter­
est. 
Though he has said he would like to re-sign with the Timberwolves, their salary­cap limitations would limit him to $611,000, about one­tenth what the Chicago Bulls could offer. 
His agent, Dan Fegan. did not return telephone calls Thursday. 
"Everyone here's main con-. cern is for Joe and that he does what's right for him," Garnett said. "We still love him. He's still our man." 
Stern denied that the Timberwolves were being made an example for under­the-table deals that supposed­ly are common. Though Stern said the NBA actively pursues· all "wink-and-a-nod" deals, 
1many turn out to be rumors. 1 "I think we all were shocked Iat the level of what went on 'here," Granik said. "David 
and I have been around long enough not to be shocked by very much. I would be shocked to learn that some­thing of this level has hap-J 
pened before. I think this is a 
_J

totally different level."

IJelles believe they <~an finish strong 
By SARAH RYKOWSKI 
Sr·orts Writer 

As the lone senior on the Saint Mary's soccer squad, Laura Paulen has been a leader and a solid player for the entire year. On Saturday. she will play her final collc­gi ate game, as the Belles face 
off  against  the  Flying  
Dutchmen of Hope.  
''I'd like to  finish  out  our  

season strong," senior Laura Pt.ulen said. "We definitely have the ability to beat Hope." 
3ecause of' a change in league play, this will be Pa ulen 's last game as well as the Belles' last competition for the season. The MIAA tournament has been replaced with round-robin play, where each team in the league plays the others twice and the NCAA bid goes to the team with the most wins. 
l'aulcn and other players were not pleased with the syi,tem. 
"It doesn't give teams the chance to improve through tho season and then play at that improved level for the tournament." Paulen said. 
Hut after Tuesday's compet­itive effort against league­leader Albion, Paulen has no do·1bt that the Belles can turn tht, tables on the Dutchmen. 
"I think that we are ready to finish strong," Paulen said. "Everybody's up for the game." 
The Belles improved last week to hold the Albion Britons to two goals in the first half and five overall, while scoring a goal of their own. 
During their last battle with Albion they were shutout 7-0. 
"I attribute our improve­ment to the fact that the girls am communicating really well," Milligan said. "You can see it on and off the lield." 
When Saint Mary's last faced off against llope the Belles suffered a 3-0 loss at the hands of the Dutchmen. 
her first solo appearance in 
goal. holding the Dutchmen 
scoreless in the second half. 

The Belles are ready for 
revenge. 

"As much as we've been 
through this year, (the 
women are I going to come 
out and beat up on Hope," 
head coach Jason Milligan 
said "All the things we've 
been working on all year are 
coming together." 

According to Milligan, Tia Kapphahn, junior co-captain for the Belles, will be in the net against the Dutchmen this time after recovering from an arm injury. Milligan will also be experimenting with differ­ent lineups against Hope. 
The Dutchmen are 4-11-1 overall and 4-8-1 in the MIAA. Amy Dobb leads the Dutchmen in scoring and had a hand in one of the goals in the previous meeting between the two teams on October 4. Freshman Lauren Hinkle, who took the earlier shutout for the Dutchmen, will be in goal against Saint Mary's. 
The Belles sit just behind the Dutchmen in the stand­ings with a 3-9-1 record in the MIAA and are 3-12-1 overall. 
Freshman Stephanie Artnak leads the Belles with 5 goals. Unfortunately the Belles' number two scorer, sopho­more Heather Muth is out for the season with an injury. 
Milligan sees this game as an opportunity to end a sea­son that involved a lot of adjustments and injuries on a positive note. As in past years, he looks at the last game as the senior game 
"We are going to try to cre­ate something great for [Paulen's] last game," Milligan said. "She's a great demonstration of leadership by example. She works really hard and she has been a rock on this team all year." 
The Belles face off against the Flying Dutchmen at 4 pm on Saint Mary's soccer field.

The seniors of Notre Dame will say goodbye to Alumni Field as the Irish men's soc­cer team takes on the Mountaineers of West Virginia tonight. 
Tri-captains Steve Maio, Dustin Pridmore and Connor LaRose will be playing their final games in front of the Irish faithful, as will team­mates Griffin Howard, Reggie McKnight and Dan Storino. 
"Those guys have put in four long, hard years of com­mitment," head coach Chris Apple said. "They'll go out on a positive note. They've real­ly left their mark on this team as far as their work ethic and commitment." 
Apple also remarked that, although the team only won one Big East tournament game during the seniors' four years, the work ethic they have instilled in the younger players will be a huge part of any success the team has in the future. 

"They've instilled an atti­tude within the team that is more important than the wins," said Apple. "They've laid the foundation." 
This weekend's game pits two of the four Big East teams that will not compete in the Big East tournament, as only the top eight teams in the conference make the tournament. West Virginia's only Big East win came against Boston College, who are currently third in the conference, on Oct. 7 in Morgantown, W.V. The Mountaineers also tied the Orangemen of Syracuse in September.

Irish take on Mountaineers 
Friday, October 27, 2000 
Despite the Mountaineers' less than impressive record, Irish head coach Chris Apple is taking nothing for granted against West Virginia. 
"They're a lot like we are," said Apple. "From what the other coaches have told me, they're a very talented team." 
The Mountaineers bring in a balanced offense with six players who have tallied six or more points. On defense, the West Virginians have had a rotating spot in goal, where three different players have logged Lime. The Mountaineers bring in a three-game losing streak, recently falling to the Panthers of Pitt 2-0 on Oct. 22. 
The Irish and Mountaineers kick off tonight at 7:30 pm.

The Irish will receive an unexpected boost from the return of senior co-captain and player of the year candi­date Anne Makinen, who was not supposed to play with a knee injury. Makinen believes she can play on the . knee without risking further injury. 

Head coach Randy Waldrum will use Makinen as needed this weekend. If the game is close, she'll play, but if the Irish leave nothing but the margin of victory in doubt, Waldrurn would pre­fer to rest his star player.

MEN'S TENNIS 

Notre Dame wraps up successful fall schedule 
By RACHEL BIBER 
Spans Writer 
If this fall season is any indi­
cation of what is to come in 
the spring, then the Notre 
Dame men's tennb team may 
have an exciting future ahead. 
The Irish wrap up the !"all 
season after a successful cam­
paign as they travel to 
Madison, \Vis .. to participate 
in the Intercollegiate Tennis 
Association Midwest 
Championships. 
"I'm verv excited with the 
progress we've made." Irish 
head coach Bob Bayliss said. 
"It's early, and steps are 
small. but we'v1\ continually 
stepped forward as the year 
has gcmc on, and I think that 
it bodes well for us in thti 
spring." 
Notre Dame is allowed six 
singles entries and two dou­
bles entries in the regional 
tournament, which includes 
teams from the Big Ten con­
ference. Conference USA. the 
Missouri Valley Conference, 
and all teams within the 
Midwest region. Bayliss has 
penciled in Casey Smith, 
Aaron Talarico, Javier 
Taborga, Luis Haddock­
Morales, Matt Scott, and 
Andrew Laflin in singles: 
while the doubles pairings will 
be ninth-ranked Taborga and 
Talarico, along with the duo 
of Brian Farrell and Ashok 
Raju. 
Due to the shared success 
by all of the Irish players, 
decisions about the make-up 
of the line-up were difficult, 
but the controversy could only 
be a win-win situation. 
"It was very, very close between Laflin and Farrell." Bayliss said. "Basically it was a flip of a coin, they've both earned the right to play. and they're both 10-1 for the fall. As a result I'm going to play Farrell in doubles with Ashok Raju, but an equally deserving guy was James Malhame. That was sort of an unusual pairing, but I think its some­thing we can get some mileage out of." 
After a surprisingly success­ful showing in the singles por­tion of the recent ITA Men's All-American Championships, Taborga is sure to have an impact on Notre· Dame's suc­cess this weekend. The Irish junior plowed through an elite f1eld at the previous tourna­ment. upending Stanford's third-seeded and defending champion K.J. Hippensteel to land a spot in the round of 16 before he was defeated. 
"[Taborga) obviously had a great tournament in Stone Mountain, Georgia, and we're real excited to see him make a breakthrough," Bayliss said. "I think he is one of several people on QUr team that is capable of doing what he did." 
Taborga also performed well in the doubles segment of the tournament, advancing to the semil1nals with Talarico. marking the first time since 1994 that Notre Dame has advanced a doubles pairing to the semifinals of a grand slam event. 
The remainder of the Irish contingent will also look to advance in this weekend's tournament and Bayliss knows that his team has the talent to do so. 
"Luis Haddock has had an outstanding fall." Bayliss 

noted. "He's a verv talented freshman, one of the probably top two or three freshmen in the country. Casey Smi-th has made a big jump in his game, and Aaron Talarico has matured as a player. [Along wilh Taborgal those four guys have led us, and. Matt Scott has been a vrry strong impact freshman. And I feel like at six. between Laflin and Farrell, I think we have great chances to win there with either one of those guys." 
The ITA Midwest Champion9'hips offers the Irish an opportunity to qualify for the elite National Rolex Singles and Doublos Indoor Championships in rebruary.

Irish look to keep momentum going 
By KEVIN BERCH OU Sport.s Writer 
With the possibility of an appearance in a Bowl Championship Series game on the horizon, Notre Dame head football coach Uob Davie knows his team can­not afford a letdown against the 5-2 Air Force Falcons Saturday in Notre Dame Stadium.

The Irish have won their Iast 12 October tilts. with their last loss coming in 1997 at home against rival USC. Extending the streak, however, won't be easy against a Falcons team seeking a bowl appearance of its own.

The play of' B.J. Scott and Lance Legree at left and right tackle will be key in keeping the Falcons' wishbone offense under wraps. The Irish easily held off another wishbone team in the Navy Midshipmen, but Navy was winless when it faced Notre Dame, while Air Force stands at 5-2,

Falcons prepare to fly past Irish in repeat performance 
By KERRY SMITH 
Sports Editor 
Irish head r.oacb Bob Davie knows the potential threat Air Force poses. 
The then-defensive coordinator and the Irish learned that lesson first hand the last time the Falcons flew into Notre Dame Stadium in 1996. 
Clinching the one of the biggest upsets in Air Force's history, the unranked Palr.ons notched a 20-· 1 7 overtime victory over the No. 9 Irish. 
"We all rPmernber the last time Air Force came to Notre Dame Stadium," Davie said. "We all rrmember thf1 overtime game, kicking the field goal to beat us." 
Those memories will not be lost on the ralcons either as they pre­pare to soar to equal heights and knock off this year's No. 19 Irish in a repeat performance. 
"This is a great opportunity for us," Falcon head coach Fisher DeBcrry said in a press confer­ence earlif1r this week. "We've played well there before and we've won there before." 
Coming into Saturday's contest, the cards are stacked against the Falcons. The only ranked team on the Falcons' schedule, the Irish have countered a solid defrnsive corps with ~ recently­explosive and more diversified offensive attack to reach a 5-2 record with one of the toughest schedules in college football. 
Also boasting a 5-2 record, the Falcons have notched crushing defoats, scoring morG than 50 points in two games this season against Cal State -Northridge and Wyoming, but have also suf­fered losses to less than stellar teams in UNLV and New Mexico. 
The raleons' relatively easy schedule will not leave the Irish resting easy -they know the tal­ent Air Force will bring to the field. 
"When you look at Air Force there is no doubt they arc a tal­ented football team,'' Oavo said. "As always, they have the com­plicated foffensive] scheme they bring ... This is obviously a big football game -particul.arly for the defense." 
The Irish defense will have to be on top of its game to squrlch the Falcons' rushing game. 
With the fifth-best rushing game in the country, Air Force is a threat on the ground. Averaging 277.4 yards a game, the flalcons have looked to half­back Scotty McKay all season to carry the ball. 
The falcons also possess a potentially potent aerial attack. 
QuartPrback Mike Thiessen has completed 61-112 passes and thrown for nine touchdowns. The senior has thrown for more than 1.000 yards this season and is on track to break into the top spot in the Air Force record books. 
"Their quarterback has a little different style than they have had in 1he past," Dade said. "He cer­tainly can run, but he is also a really good passer. HP is vr,ry accurate." 
Thiessen finds his favorite tar­get in wide receiver Hyan fleming. 
With 27 recPptions for 548 yards, the junior is second in the Mountain West Conference in receiving. 
A strong performance on the other side of the ball will be key for the Falcons to stop the Irish. They have given up an average of 
21.9 points in seven games -the most in recent years. 
Despite the added pressure of playing in a tough arena, DeBerry is looking forward for the potential this game holds for his Falcons to soar. 
"Notre Dame Stadium is a saued plac~:. Some of the best players in the history of the game have played there. This is our players' chance to do that," he said.

GAME OF THE WEEK 

By PEYTON BERG 
Sports Writer 
When the Sooners and the Huskers last clashed in 1997, Nebraska gave Oklahoma its worst beat­ing in school history, a 54­7 pasting en route to its third national title in four years. 
Many felt that this game permanently ended the once glorious rivalry that annually determined the Big Eight Championship and a trip to the Orange Bowl. Once the final game of the season for both teams, the newly formed Big XII turned Colorado into Nebraska's big rival. 
The tables have officially turned. The first edition of the BCS rankings was released last Monday, with Nebraska and Oklahoma ranked one and two, respectively. The Sooners have all but sewn up the Big XII South division, meaning that there may be a rematch of Saturday's contest in the Big XII Championship game in December. 
Oklahoma has had a week off to prepare, and is coming off a huge win at then-undefeated Kansas State. Confidence and momentum are at levels not seen since the days of Barry Switzer and Brian Bosworth. These feelings are justified: quarterback Josh Heupel's completion rate is near 70 percent, and the Sooner offense 
OTHER TOP GAMES 
Ohio State at Purdue: For sale: one 2000 Rose Bowl berth. Drew Brees and Purdue defeated Wisconsin to enter this week tied with Michigan for first place in the Big Ten. The Boilermakers already disposed of the Wolverines and the Wildcats, securing a tiebreaker advan­tage. They remain a half game ahead of the Ohio State Buckeyes. so this game means the difference between an outright conference championship and a dogfight in late November.

has been able to scorn vir­tually at will. Nebraska enters the game with everything to lose. After Florida State lost to in­state rival Miami, the Huskers found themselves on top of every poll. Virginia Tech remains unbeaten, but must travel to Miami next month. The Huskers must stay unde­feated in order to avoid a BCS logjam of teams with one loss. 
Both teams sport potent offenses, but with vastly different styles. Nebraska's power running attack, led by Tim Crouch and Dan Alexander, put up 38 points against Baylor -in tlrn first quar­ter. Oklahoma atlacks from the air with equally 
Florida vs. Georgia: Ifs time again for the World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party, live from Jacksonville's Alltel Stadium. Georgia finally beat nemesis Tennessee earlier this year, but has one nemesis remaining in Florida. Because of the startling emergence of the South Carolina Gamecocks, this game has SEC East Championship implications. 
Gators quarterback Rex Grossman has thrown eight interceptions this season but zero in his last two games. Given coach Steve Spurrier's intolerance for inept quarterbacking, Grossman should be good for at least the first quarter. 
Georgia's quarterback position remains uncertain. Quincy Carter sat out of Saturday's victory against Kentucky to nurse a shoulder injury. In his absence, sophomore Cory Phillips stepped in and threw for 400 yards and four touchdowns.

devastating rnsults. Coach Bob Stoops brought with him an impressive, wide open offensive set from Florida and now has the talent to employ it effec­tively. 
As is true in all big games, defense will deter­mine the outcome. 
Oklahoma's defense has been overshadowed because of the offense's success, but Rocky Calmus and Co. can stop good teams. The Huskers suf­fered defensive growing pains early, but have since played up to a higher stan­d a rd. While the 2000 Black Shirts will not remind anyone of the 1997 unit, Nebraska still remains a juggernaut on both sides of the ball.
