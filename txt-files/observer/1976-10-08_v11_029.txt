Ford clarifies statements on Easte_rn European block 
By Howard Benedict Associated Press Writer 
LOS ANGELES (AP)-President Ford. seeking to quiet the political storm brewing over a statement lie made during his second debate with Jimmy Carter, said yesterday the United States will never con­cede the domination of Eastern European nations by the Soviet Union. 
America "firmly supports the aspirations for independence of the nations of Eastern Europe." Ford told a crowd of 15.000 at the University of Southern California. 
"The United States has never conceded and never will concede their domination by the Soviet Union." the President said. 
During his Wednesday night debate with Carter in San Fran­cisco, Ford said there was "no Soviet domination of Eastern Eur­ope and there never will be UQder a Ford administration." 
Speaking in answer to a ques­tion. Ford seemed to be categori­cally denying Soviet control over all of Eastern Europe, although he cited as examples Poland, Yugo­slavia and Romania, the three most independent of the Soviet Union. 
Ford spoke as USC following an inspection of a mockup of the controversial Bl bomber at the nearby Rockwell International plant where he criticized Carter's defense policies. saying Carter "wants to speak loudly and carry a fly swatter." Carter has turned upside down President Theodore Roosevelt's policy of "speak softly and carry a big stick." Ford said. 
Later. Ford arranged to join with Republican primary opponent Ronald Reagan at a GOP fund­raiser in Beverly Hills. 
A poll by The Associated Press showed Carter a paperthin winner over Ford in their second confron­tation. As with their first debate, in which a similar poll showed Ford a narrow winner, the margin was so slight that it could have resulted from normal statistical variances.

May leave downtown 
SB worried about Sear.s 
by Lindy Decio Staff Reporter 
A forthcoming decision by Sears. Roebuck and Company on whether to relocate their South Bend store in Mishawaka's new University Mall has generated considerable anxiety among officials interested in improving the downtown area.

to suspend morn,·ng exams the of Do~ntownchairman the
Development Commtttee. 
by Maureen Flynn Campus Editor 

The Faculty Senate last night drafted and unanimously approved a resolution that the Academic Council suspend the current con­troversial examination-scheduling policy and conduct a study of faculty and student reaction to the policy. 
The regulations, announced by University Provost Fr. James T. Burtchaeillast April. prohibit even­ing departmcntals and reserve the 8TT10 time period for the schedul­ing of such tests. 
The resolution calls for the suspension of. that policy until a "comprehensive, factual study" can be made of "affected faculty and student reactions." 
Members of the Senate termed the current policy "confusing," citing uncertainty over whether it refers to departmentals only, all evening tests, or all evening tests and classes. They said the policy has not yet been officially cir­culated in written form. 
Some senators objected to the current scheduling regulations be· cause they create overlapping of examinations with classes or other examinations. 
The policy was originally insti­tuted. according to Burtchaell. to free students' evenings for studies and campus activities. 
One professor termed the new policy "a sdlution to a small problem that creates a lot of larger problems.'' 
Senate Chairman James P. Dan­ehy said he has almost completed a survey of department chairmen concerning the number of evening tests given by their departments last year and the number of students affected. 
Evaluations evaluated 

In other business, Senate Treas­urer. Senate Treasurer Bobby J. Farrow announced that Notre Dame faculty and students will be surveyed this week to determine their attitudes towards the Teacher Evaluation forms. 
Both students and faculty will be asked to rate the validity of the current questionnaire items and to assess their own response to the Evaluation form. 
Students will be asked if they feel the forms are really an effective method of evaluation and if they take the evaluation process as a serious responsibility. 
The Faculty survey will seek to determine whether or not profes: 

Chairman James Danehy con­ducted a survey concerning depart­mental tests. The Academic Council passed a resolution against 
8:00 a.m. exams. 
sors respona to tne cnttques ana how much or little they value student judgment on particular items. 
Farrow noted that casual ques­tioning of a number of students revealed that they "didn't have much confidence in the impact" of student evaluations. 
Several Senate members voiced skepticism regarding students' ability to validly judge items such as "knowledge of subject matter." 
The survey results will be dis­cussed at the November meeting of the Faculty Senate. 
Members of the Senate Execu­tive Committee reported the results of a Sept. 28 meeting with Univer­sity administrators on "topics of mutual concern." The meeting was dominated by discussion of grade inflation and course and teacher evaluations, Danehy said. The Catholic charaCter of Notre Dame will be the subject of a future meeting between Senate and ad­ministration officials. 
Budget input sought 

The Executive committee also met this past month with members of the University Budget Priorities 
·Committee, reported Prof. Irin Press. Press said the committee is in its first year of operations and is "inundated" with figures and material. The exact role of the Budget Priorities Committee in University budgeting is unclear as yet, but it was recommended that the Senate address future reports on financial matters to the Commit­tee's attention. 
(continued on page 2) Brammer emphasized the impor­tance of Sears remaining in the downtown area. and asserted that the store has a "civic responsibility to help the city." 
"Once Sears goes. there will be no more retailing in the city of South Bend. and within five years the South Bend area will be a total service center. just offices. The city will be dead when work lets out." he declared. 
Students at Notre Dame and St. Mary's will also be affected by the move. according to Brammer, since there is currently no public trans· portation to the University Mall. and there will be few retail stores remaining in South Bend. In addi­tion. the new mall is approximately one mile farther from campus than the downtown area. 
"If Sears remains. the future of the city will be bright. for the Downtown Development Commit­tee has plans for a super block in the enclosed downtown area." stated Brammer. This "super block" and the surrounding area would contain Sears. Penny's. Carson Pirie and Scott. plus about 140 smaller shops. a threatre. and restaurants. 
Bobby Wade. the General Man­ager of Seals in South Bend. noted however that the project is still in the planning stage. "This down· town mall is still ·just an idea. whereas the University Mall is already being built, and it is going to be a fine mall." 

Wade explained _that much time has been spent by Sears in re­searching both areas. and that "the decision won't be made for some time yet.,'' 
''Five things come into consid­eration: the cost of the land. the construction and finances. the amount of property allotted for the building and for parking. the public transportation provided. and the growth of the trading area." He remarked that transportation would be "no problem" if Sears makes the move. and added that the University Mall "will make it whether Sears moves there or not." Wade declined to state a personal preference for either loca­tion. 
~ campaign consisting of peti­tion drives. letter writing and telephone calls is underway at the moment to try and convince Sears to leave its store in downtown South Bend. according to Bramme. Wade commented. however. that he had received letters from citi­zens in Mishawaka that said they wanted the store to move to the University Mall. 
Brammer cited a survey taken of 

1.310 persons, of which 76.6 per­cent indicated that thev wanted to see the downtown developed as a major shopping center. and 89.2 percent agree that an economically healthy downtown will benefit everyone. 
·'Perhaps if Sears looked at some of these figures they would remain in South Bend's downtown area." Brammer declared. "Sears isn't looking at any studies except their own."

SMC students arrested at Nickies

Three St. Mary's sophomores 
were arrested at 11 :30 p.m. last 
Thursday night in Nickie's when 
two plainclothed policemen began 
checking ages of. the bar's occu· 
pants. An underage male who was 
a friend of one of the students was 
also arrested. · 
The !.tudents were charged with being "minors in a tavern" and with the consumption of alcoholic beverages. "There was no bouncer at the door so we just walked in." said one of the students. "We didn't have any 21 J.D.'s so when the policemen asked us our ages. we told them the truth." The 
·students were not asked for I.D.':; 
until they arrived at the South Bend 
city jail, she added. 
According to the student, they were fingerprinted and had "mug shots'· taken before they were informed that they had been ar­rested or were read their rights. "They just told us to come with 

them." she said. "We didn't think to ask why." Although the students arrived at the city jail shortly after 11:30 
p.m.. they were not allowed to call anyone until I a.m. Stevie Wernig, assistant dean of Student Affairs. "got the call about I :30 a.m." and went to the jail to post bail, which was $50 for each student. "Stevie was the first one to tell us what the charges were." explained the stu· dent. indicating the police had not informed them of the charges. 
Right now the students are in the process of talking to Notre Dame's legal aid and an outside lawyer. The court hearing has been set for October 26. "We don't know anything concrete yet." she said. 
According to the police, if the students are convicted, they will probably be fined less than $50. The arrest will go on record only in . Indiana. and will be "completely erased" when they turn 21. "We / get the bail money back no matter 
what." the student said.

Archbishop Sheen to speak Sunday· 
 by Jack Pizzolato Staff Reporter 

Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen, prominent author, educator and religious figure, will speak at the 3Jrd Annual Eucharistic Holy Hour. this Sunday, Oct. 11. in Notre Dame's Athletic and Convo­
:'ltion Center. The event is sponsored by the local Deanery Council of Catholic Men, an as­sembly of organization and church leaders representing 23 parishes within the South Bend-Fort Wayne diocese. 
"This is not a mass," said George Scheuer, secretary of the Deanery Council. "It is a bene­diction, consisting of prayers, singing and exposition of the Blessed Sacrament.'' 
The Holy Hour will be preceded at 2:15 p.m. by a Sacred Concert performed by the St. Matthews Cathedral Choir under the direction 
of  Dr.  Edward  Kline,  associate  
professor  of  English  at  Notre  
Dame.  A  procession,  including  

members of the South Ben police and fire departments, local stu­dents and representatives of vilri­ous area church groups and soci­eties. will follow at 2:45 p.m. Sheen will deliver his homily shortly after the commencement of the ceremony at'3 p.m. 
Bishop Leo A. Pursley, D.D., head of the South Bend-Fort Wayne diocese, will perform the benediction. This will be Pursley's last public appearance before Bishop William McManus assumes the post next week. 
Representatives from Notre Dame and St. Mary's have been invited. "We hope students will attend too," said Scheuer. 
Sheen, 81, is author of 63 books. He has written numerous articles for such magazines as Common­wealth, America and New Scho­lasticism. Noted for his wit and good humor, he was a well-known TV and radio personality during the SO's and 60's. In 1965, he served on the Commission of the Missions for Vatican II and was appointed the Bishop of Rochester, N.Y. in 1966 by Pope Paul IV. Sheen is now retired.

Spaghetti shop in the making 
by Jack C. Silhavy Staff Reporter 
On Friday nights, starting after fall break Lewis and Stanford halls may open· up a "spaghetti shop" as a kind of extension to food sales. 
·The trial run is tonight with 25 men and 25 women from the sponsoring halls as the "guinea pigs."

"Both uf our halls are freshmen and sophomores mostly and since they're younger, we think this would be a good chance to meet some people and really get to know the," commented Stanford Hall President, Keefe Montgomery.

The menu, at least in the beginning, would include spa­ghetti, garlic and butter bread, and salad. Table cloths are red and

Assassinations prober to question Ford, Connally 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The chief investigator for a House probe into the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King indicated Thursday he intends to question President Ford, former Texas Gov. John Connally and Kennedy's widow, Jacqueline Onassis. 
Ut rord, ::,prague told reporters, ''I'm sure the investigation will include him." Of Connally and Mrs. Onassis, he said there is "no doubt that they will" be ques­tioned. 
Ford served as a member of the Warren Commission which con­cluded in 1964 that Lee Harvey Oswald was the sole assassin of the President. Connally was seriously wounded in the November 1963 tragedy. 
Rep. Thomas Downing, D-Va., chairman of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, cal­
. led Sprague a "hardnosed compe­tent prosecutor who has no precon­ceptions" about the rumors sur­rounding the Kennedy slaying and the April 1968 murder of King. 
Sprague is best known for suc­ce: ~fully prosecuting former United Mine Workers president 
W .A. "Tony" Boyle for the murder of union insurgent Joseph Yablon­ski. Sprague insisted he had no '"'reconceptions about either case. 
Conclusions that have been reached heretofore are not of any interest to me," he said. 
Sprague said his first step would be to arrange meetings with Atty. Gen. Edward Levi, FBI director

Carter goes international; woos 'Democrats Abroad' 
by Patrick Cole 
Political Writer 

In the past weeks, Democratic Presidential hopeful Jimmy Carter is seeking an international vote from American abroad and Asian­Americans at home. 
According to a story in The New York Times by William E. Farrell on Sept. 25, the Democratic Na­tional Committee "has gone inter­national in its quest for votes." 
In fact, one campaigner for Carter, Steven Cohen, a 35-year-old lawyer from Newton, Mass. , has been knocking on doors in se,·eral co_untries--Israel, Germany, Bel­gium, France, Italy and Britain-­encouraging Americans living a­

Bulla Shed: More than Friday Mass 
by Martha Fanning Senior Staff Reporter 

Since it's opening in the spring of 1973, the Bull Shed, the Campus Ministry Activity Center, has served the Notre Dame community in a variety of ways. 
Fr. William Toohey, Director of Campus Ministry. named a few of the numerous groups which have been scheduled in the past to use the house. "In a typical week you could find scheduled: a Freshmen colloquium class, CILA Mass, Col­legiate Seminar, a hall staff gather­ing, Hotline, Hunger Coalition or a dorm section dinner," noted Toohey. 
Toohey explained that when Bulla Shed was first opened, certain hours were set aside each evening for students to visit. "A student volunteer acted as a host­hostess each evening from about 
7:00 to midnight," remarked Toohev. "Students would come overt~ talk, st~dy and have coffee, if it was available." 
This arrangement continued un­til the fall of 1973, when the demand grew to such an extent that the use of Bulla Shed was primarily by campus groups on a reservation basis. 
When Campus Ministry assum­ed responsibility for the Bulla Shed in the fall of 1972, extensive renovations were undertaken in­cluding the removal of a wall, installing shag carpet, a stove, sink and other kitchen appliances, and painting the rooms. The work was undertaken by the Campus Minis­try staff and student volunteers. 
-The facility was opened in Feb­ruary of 1973, for the Notre Dame "Ommunity. Fr. Toohey expressed the''id?q behind the center. "We 



Over $8 million in aid granted 
by Mary Ann Layden Staff Reporter 

To meet tuition costs. 61.5 percent of current Notre Dame undergraduates are receiving $8,335.208 in financial aid. 
The preliminary financial aid report released Friday disclosed that 4.249 of the 6,914 under­graduates are receiving· aid,' inclu­ding scholarships, federal or state aid..student loans and employment. 
Last year's final financial aid report showed 62.3 percent of the 6,846 enrollment receivied $8,325,331, reflecting slight in­crease in the amount of aid per student from $1,951 last year to $1,960 this fall. 
According to Mrs. June McCau­slin. Director of Financial Aid and Scholarships at Notre Dame, re­quests for assistance traditionally increase as the academic year progresses, and she expects these preliminary figures to expand dur­ing the year. She explained that last year's figures reflect a nine month period of financial assis­tance, while this year's amount so far covers only a one month period. 
Chess Club wins match 

The Notre Dame Chess Club defeated the South Bend club by a score of 3-2 Wednesday night, with wins by Padraig Obriain, Dan Casto and Tim Wiegand. 
On Wednesday, Oct. 13, Obriain will play a simultaneous exhibition in the basement of the South Bend Public Library at 7 p.m. Entrance fee is one dollar for challengers and prizes will be awarded for winners. 
.The Notre Dame club will play the Gambiteer's Chess Club of the Michigan City Prison on Nov. 13. Anyone interested in playing can contact John Newcomer at 272­1913 or Jim Stevens at 8610 in advance. 
feel it is indispensible to have an alternative to the crowded, noisy campus situation -especially for students, so that they might gather with others to share conversation, reflection, good times, prayer and discussion," commented Toohey. 
The house is divided into two small rooms, a living room and a kitchen on the upper level. The basement has also been partially renovated. General maintenance of the center is done by members of Campus Ministry. This past sum­mer Toohey, Sister Jane Pitz and a student volunteer re-painted the main room and kitchen. Toohey expressed a desire to put up a volleyball net next spring for use by students, in the yard. 
One of the regular events at Bulla Shed is the Friday Mass and dinner at 5:15p.m. 
Toohey stated that the mass and dinner was to "provide an oppor­tunity for students from multiple communities on campus to meet with people that one doesn't nor­mally meet." 
The g<.thedng attracts students from all classes, and faculty mem­bers also attend. Toohey comment­ed that there can be a reluctance for student5. to come for the first time. He remarked, "Many stu­dents find it a bit hard to just come, if they have never been to Bulla before; bvt there is always a warm welcome, and always new people coming. 
''Again and again people say what one senior said last year: 'I just wish I hadn't waited so long to drop around; my involvement here 
these paM tew weeKs nas been one of the best things to happen to me during my four yea1s at Notre Dame", Toohey explained. 
Student volunteers prepare the 
The number of students needing money and the amount of money received have both increased in the same proportions as compared to last year. This has been the trend in the past few years, according to McCauslin. 
Scholarships granted by the uni­versity from endowed funds and ('Urre~t contributions went to 954 ~tudents and totaled $1,153,165 this year, compared to 949 students and $1.104,786 last year. Scholar­ships broughi to the university by students from state or private funding declined slightly, but the ROTC awards increased from $1.128,705 to $1,186,230. 
Federal assistance programs are aiding 1,489 students this year, an increase over last year's 1,346, with the average award rising from $1,622 to $1,716. The number of students receiving loan assistance 

Toledo Law School visits 
The University of Toledo's Col­lege of Law will host an open house for undergraduate students who are considering enrolling in law school next fall (1977) and for college and university faculty mem­bers who serve as pre-law advisors. 
It is scheduled for Oct. 15. from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the l)niversity's Law Center. 
Open house activities on Oct. 15 will include panel discussions of law school admissions standards, costs, available financial aid, job placement efforts made by the college on behalf of its graduates, on-campus and area housing facili­ties and the substance and tech­nique of legal education. 
Tours of the Law Center, the opportunity to attend a first-year class, question and answer ses­sions with college faculty and administrators and a luncheon with

More of a Debate 
The second "Great Debate" was much closer to being a real confrontation bet ween incumbent Ford and challenger Carter than was their first meeting. This was primarily due to the fact that each man, particularly Carter, evaded the glorified press conference format of the debates and went after his opponent. The result was a more decisive and revealing battle, with the edge going to Carter. 
Neither candidate has had much prev­ious experience in debate. Both apparently chose to play it safe in the negotiations over the format, agreeing to an uncomfor­table compromise between· a double "Meet the Press" and a head-on debate. They continued that cautious attitude in the first meeting, fearing to appear aggressive. The result was a disappointing draw characterized by masses of stock 
If the official format is scrupulously followed it does not allow much chance for the cut and thrust of face-to-face forensics. Each man is allowed only one brief rebuttal to the other's statement. Rebuttals must be left unanswered, no matter how inaccurate they might be. At the same time, the format does not allow enough follow-up questions from newsmen to make a revealing press conference possi­ble, especially considering the number of issues. 
Yet Carter and Ford did battle each other more this time by avoiding some of the questions and concerning fire on the opposition. Each directed more remarks to the other. Carter struck harder, declaring Kissinger president of foreign policy and scoring with debate points by implying Marx and Ford .both believe capitalism needs war. 
However, because of the question-and­answer format, each man had to avoid full answers to the questions to make time for confrontation. This probably lost them some support from those who wanted direct answers to direct questions. Carter, 
because  he  departed  further  from  the  
format,  left  himself  ore  open  to  such  
losses.  

Yet on the whole,' Carter came off considerably better than did the President who should have been talking about what he knows best: his day-to-day work. The debate itself better revealed the policy differences between the two candidates and the validity of the arguments they present. 
It is unfortunate that the format for the last "debates" will remain the same. But the candidates have shown that it is possible to work around that format and to approach real debate. Carter, by edging Ford, showed the political advantages of the direct attack. We hope that the next debates will provide an ~ven sharper and clearer clash between the candidates. Such a clash could puncture some of the empty campaign rhetoric on which they have too often relied.

Retracts 

Letter 
Dear Editor: · ­
Because of my stupidity for 
having written and having placed 
in the letters column my letter 
which appeared in the Tuesday, 
October 5, issue of The Observer, I 
have written this letter as a 
retraction. 
I would like the public to be 
aware of the following points: 
 
With my letter I made an unwarranted personal attack upon Andy Praschak. 

 
This personal attack was made in a forum where such an attack should never .be made --in a newspaper. When such an act is performed, it cannot be other than detrimental to the subject of the attack. 

 
In my former letter, I implied that I was speaking for other members of The Observer staff. This implication was false. I was speaking merely for myself. One should never, as I did, purport to speak for others without their consent. 

 
The apology I offer in this letter, however, comes from the entire editorial board as well as from myself. They have been consulted on this matter and concur than an apology is due. When any member of a representative group such as our editorial board addresses the public (as I did through my former letter), that member, by implica­tion, cannot help but speak for the entire group. 


Again, Mr. Praschak has my apologies and retraction for the insults containedwithinmy letter in the October 5 issue of The Observer. 
Chris Smith Asst. Managing Editor The Observer 
Editor's Note: The Editorial Editor deeply regrets the appearance of Mr. Smith's original letter on this page due to insufficient supervision on his part. 1 
Angers Article Unfair 
Dear Editor: 
For some reason, the article of September 30 entitled, "Angers

quite fair to me. Being. an 
X-" Angerine", (and, of course, 
biased), I don't feel that this article 
doe's justice to the Angers progam; 
at least it doesn't make Angers 
sound "impressive". Although the 
article is well-written and the facts 
well-presented, something is lack­
ing -enthusiasm. 
Many of us Angers grads would 
like. to speak up for the exciLg 
side of th~ Angers p:ogram. 
Although Angers is not "a swing­
ing town" and although the town 
retires by 10 p.m., the Angers 
Domers. have many opportunities 
to create their own excitement. 
True, Angers l"(as no Nickies and no 
McDonalds, but in addition to the 
cultural benefits mentioned in the 
article, Angers has numerous wine· 
caves (where one may sample 
French wines to his heart's con­
tent), a student union, (where 
French and American students can 
party together) and 10 trains daily 
to Paris! (Personally,I would prefer 
a day in Paris to a day in $_outh 
B..:nd!) 
The opportunity for travel was 
not mentioned in this article. M'lmy 
students join the Angers program 
more for this opportunity than 
anything else. Going to Spain for 
the weekend is almost as easy as is 
going to the Dunes for campus 
students. 
The language was a problem, but 
most of us went to France without · "knowing the lingo'' and thought 
the year worthwhile! Mastery of 
the language was nut a prerequisite 
of going to Angers. It would have 
helped, of coufse, but none of us 
fell that we had it! 
We did face "culture shock", 
anti-American feelings and a lan­
guage barrier. But, something 
about a year in Angers -perhaps 
it's sidewalk cafes -made us all 
want to go back someday. Another 
motor bike ride across the Anjou 
countryside would do anyone a lot 
of good!

letters to a lonely God 
neither elephant nor oak tree 
/ 
Once again, the September song is over. lt is the Birthday Week, and life grows mellow like a vintage wine, along with the ripedng apples and the pumpkins yellow­ing in the fields. One thinks: "If I survive for another fifty years, I will be celebrating a personal centennial; I shall be honored as a patriarch." Nations celebrate centen­nials and bicentennials, and institutions ha. e them too; but human expectaticos do not much exceed the Biblical aFe of threescore and ten. Elephants anc' oak trees live longer than men do. As one who is neither elephant nor oak, I envy the beast and the tree. For me, It seems there can never be too many autumns; there can never be sufficient Aprils to have immortal longings in. Even in bedroom slip,1ers, wrapped in flannel, after a hundred birthdays, I shall continue to want to see the' sunsets on a summer's ocean and the sight of lonely gulls riding the breakers of an incoming tide. I may not be the stuff from which patriarchs are made, but I hope that these eyes will not finally fail until they are an old man's eyes. I hope that when a final weariness at last overtakes me. I will have had a patriarch's share Qf 
>'atchings and blessings at weddings and christenings of the tribe. 
There is a dear little lady with Irish blue eyes whom I especially think of on l'irthdays. She lives in Maine near the sea m an ancient farmhouse with back pastures that are visited by deer every morning at daybreak. She is eighty-one years old, with grandchildren and great­grandchildren, a matriarch too gentle to claim the title. She and I have shared an interest in my birthdays since before I was born. Years ago. she gave away the substance of her wealth as a support to helpless people. and for a long time,, she 
 has lived on a fixed income received monthly. The other day she sent a check with the simple notation, "For my ex­penses.'' If you have ever wondered at the size or appearance of a widow's mite, you should see that check (it was for four hundred dollars). If you have ever needed a11 example of the restraint and dignity with which age accepts its mortality, you should think of the thoughtfulness accom­pao~ying that check, with its terse not?tion, "For my expenses." "For my expenses,·· inc:ced! As if to say, "We ¥ankees are practical people.\ Everything costs money. including death. As a simple business arrangement, I want to share the death tab with my survivors." Even among Yankee widows, there is sometimes a heart matching the beauty of Irish blue eyes: a heart that makes a mother anxious not to be a burden to her family; a heart that is fierce with the Yankee virtue of self­reliance; a heart that imposes a discipline in spending so that a widow's mite may be left over for the expenses of one's burial. The poet Keats, dead at twenty-six, wrote these lines: 
When I have fears' that I may cease to'be Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain, 
· 

Before high-piled books, in charact'ry, Hold like rich garners the full­ripened grain; When I behold, upon the night's starred fa'ce. Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance, And think that I may never live to trace Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance; And when I feel, fair creature of an hour! That I shall never look upon thee more, Never have relish in the faery power Of unreflecting Love!--then on the shore Of the wide world I stand alone, and think Till Love and Fame to nothingness do sink. 
Celebrants of birthdays, approaching or by-passing fifty, are halfway between the moods of young poets fearing they may cease to be, and the seeming detachment of Yankee widows sending checks for their expenses. But, one wonders, if Keats' pen had gleaned his teaming brain, and he had lived to be eighty-one or older, would he still have stood alone on the shore of the wide world, ar. thought, ''Till Love and 
Fame to nothingness do sink"? Having traced the shadows of the symbols of a high romance beheld on the 1 night's starred face; having written the high-piled books in charact'ry; could he then have sent off checks for his expenses, like a Yankee widow, without further fears that he might cease to be? 
I can only answer that for myself I have a fear of ceasing to have birthdays. I think I can· never be surfeited with birthdays. Birthdays, as celebrations of life, are the links joining ol).e year with another. Through them, I look on all my yesterdays, and hope for my tomorrows. To have a brithday remembers what it meant to be seven, when you were taken to the country and allowed to ride on a horse. To have a birthday remembers when you were seventeen, and if the war lasted another year you would be in the army. 
Always on birthdays there are people to be remembered: grandmothers who baked cookies, nuns who gave you holy cards, chums who were closer than brothers; young girls who brought you flowers. Birthdays brought you freedom; birthday brought you wrinkles; birthdays made you Jld enough to drink, old enough to vote, old enough to be married without the consent of pa-rents. All of it, and everything--every happiness, grief, and funeral; the dancing on high school afternoons, the walks in the rain on city streets, the graduation days, the mortal illnesses survived--every' second of a happy, not compl'etely painless, life, is recapitulated and made simultaneous on birthdays as you remember, and pray, and thank God, and bless the events that need a winter, spring, summer, and fall to spread themselves out over, so that life will

There is a portrait of the lady with Irish blue eyes that dates back to a long-ago summer when she was a young woman expecting a baby. Living that summer on one of the Bay islands off from Portland on the coast of Mai-ne, she had gone fishing as the men and children still go fishing from off the coastal rocks. Those rocks caJ be trir 1~y and dangerous of footing, especia _y, it would seem, for a womar clumsy with pregnancy; but the blue-eye Irish girl was as fearless as a Yanket. fisherman in her need for being intimately touched on the face and hair by the wind, the sun, the surf, and the sea. For two hours on an August afternoon, she stood there casting from a rocky point that only birds could reach with ease. Afterwards, the older women were angry at the risks she had taken. A local artist painted the scene; and it is a study in stillness of a love for life. 
J'here is another picture, too, this one a verbal picture, of the blue-eyed Irish woman at eighty-one. In the recent summer, she went to the back pasture at daybreak to watch the deer that-play by the sea; and finding strawberries, she stopped to pick them. The younger womer. she lives with were angry at the risks she had taken of falling, because eighty-one is not always steady on the feet. I am sure there was a smile in the Irish blue eves, as she submitted humbly, not really listening. to the scolding; remembering the beauty that blesses life, for a girl or a woman, in a New England landscape.

Irish mothers and romantic poets, view­ing their mortality, must stand alone on the shore of the world, having fears that they may cease to be, though the Irish mother has never spoken of fear. She doesn't speak much of love, either, though she is full of it. She certainly would be shocked at the Keatsian notion of brooding over death until love sinks into nothingness. As for losing beauty, I think she plans to take it with her. Keeping close to the things she has always enjoyed, as when she visits meadows and strawberry patches. she seems to be packing memories to take on a journey.

Mental patients' rights groups protest 

forced drug use 

Pacific News Service--When 30 year old Bay Area carpenter Don­ald Stein refused to take his medications at California's state mental hospital at Napa, a team of psychiatric technicians followed him to his bed, cornered him and forcibly injected him with a needle. 
Despite evidence that psycho­active drugs cause brain damage in a significant number of users, the nurses at Napa, where Stein was formerly a patient, round up the patients and pass out the drugs four times a day. Those like Stein who refuse to take them are th.~n forced to. 
Mental patients' rights groups across the country call that "chem­ical rape;" mental health author­ities call it chemotherapy. · Both agree that psychoactive drugs have become the standard treatment for more that 'six million Americans now involved in the mental health system. In California, for example, 90 percent of state mental hospital patients are on drugs, according to state hospitals director Don Z. Miller. 
California recently joined a hand­
ful of states with laws restricting 
involuntary treatment by electro­
shock and lobotomy--but no state 
allows involuntarily committed pat­
ients the right to refuse psycho­
active drugs. 
Donald Stein is going to court to 
try to change that. This fall, the 
case of Stein vs. Linn joins another 
in Massachusetts as the first 
lawsuits challenging the right of 
psychiatry and the state to violate 
the civil rights of persons labled 
''insane.'' 
Meanwhile, California mental 
patients' rights groups are taking · their case tc state health officials and legislators and running into 
solid opposition. 
After Network Against Psychiat­
ric Assault (NAPA), a San Francis­
co-based patient~· rights group, sat 
in at California Gov. Jerry Brown's 
office for one month this summer, 
state hospitals director Miller con­
ceded, "I think we use drugs too 
much." 
Since then a state Assembly research committee has launched an investigation into the use of drugs in state hospitals, but state ·health director Dr. Jerome Lackner 

says he remains opposed to NA­PA's demand for an end·to forced drugging. "I just don't think all patients are capable of deciding for themselves," Lackner says. 
Another patients' rights group, the Committee Against Forced Treatment, has been unsuccessful in enlisting a legislative sponsor for its right-to-refuse-medications pro­posals. And the psychiatric estab­lishment, organized health workers and the pharmaceuticals lobby have already indicated opposition to any legislation granting patients the absolute right to refuse dru&s. 
Attacking the use of psychotropic drugs is like attacking the found­ation of the modern mental health system. The U.S. now uses $570 million worth of psychoactive drugs annually--and usage is increasing by 11 percent a year, according to a Squibbs Corp. survey. 
"Drugs are the only break­through psychiatry has had in the last 20 years," says NANA state hospital Medical Director Abe Linn. "If I had to choose between medications and group therapy," Linn says, "I'd choose drugs. You can do psychodrama, Gestalt or scream all you want, but you're not going to get the results you get with drugs." 
Psychoactive drugs--mainly Pro­lixin, Thoraxene, Naldo! and Mel­Ieril--usually make patients calmer and more manageable. The drugs­which don't cure mental illness--do suppress hallucinations and mental confusion · and tone down the bizarre behavior that disturbs the rest of society. 
However, the possible side ef­

fects of psychoactive drugs run for 
two columns in most drug litera­
ture: drowsiness, blurred vision 
and speech, loss of libido, heart 
disease, fetal deformation and 
permanent brain damage in the 
form of tardive dyskinesia--uncon­
trollable muscle spasms that ap­
pear in from 30-50 percent of users, 
according to Dr. George C. Crane,· 
the nation's leading authority on 
the disease. 
Nevertheless, much of the psych­iatric establishment, represented by the American Psychiatric Assoc­iation, now supports the biological theory that mental illness is. caused by a chemical imbalance that may require life-long drug use. 

The Neighborhood Study Help Program is attempting to provide better training for its tutors this year. 
Study Help Program 


Tutors receiving preparation 

by Chris Datzman Staff Reporter 

Beginning its fourteenth year. the Neighborhood Study Help Pro­gram seeks to help South Bend schoolchildren both academically and socially. Volunteers from the Notre Dame-St. Mary's community spend an hour and a half twite a week tutoring gradeschoolers in math and reading. 
''We've added a new emphasis this year on quality rather than quantity,'' said student organizer Rick Van Buren. "In the past we let the tutors rely on their own resourcefulness for teaching tech­niques, but this year we hope to prepare the tutors for their ser­vice." 
The program's two hundred volunteers began instructing this week at twelve grade schools and neighborhood centers. For most it was their first experience at being both a teacher and a friend. 
A first-time participant, Melanie Jorgensen commented, "It was a beautiful experience. When we got off the bus at the center the little kids swarmed around us yelling hello and hugging us. It makes you feel you're doing some good." 
The Neighborhood Study Help Program began in 1963 with a small broup of students who wanted to tutor. By the late sixties member­ship had risen to 500 ·and federal funds were procured from the Office of Economic Opportunity. In 1973 the program lost its funding when it was mov~d down the

Scandinavian Seminar accepting applications 
Scancinavian Seminar, a study abroad program in Denmark, Fin­annd; Norw:ay and Sweden, is now accepting applications for the aca­demic year 1977-78. This living­and-learning experience is de­signed fm; college students, gradu­ates and other adults who want to become part of another culture while acquiring a second language. 
An initial 3 weeks language course, followed by a family stay whenever possible, will give the student opportunity to practice the language on a daily basis and to share in the life of the community. For the major part of the year he is separated from his fellow American students, living and studying among Scandinavians at a "Peo­ple's College" (residential school for continuing adult aducation) or some other specialized institution. 
All Seminar students participate in the introductory, midyeaf·~and final sessions, where matters re­lated to their studies, experiences and individual progress are re­viewed and discussed. Tht!t'ticus of 
che Scandinavian Sminar program is an Independent Study Project in the student's own field of interest. An increasing number of American colleges and universities are giving full or partial credit for the Seminar year. 
The fee, covering tuition, room, board, one-way group transpor­tation from New York and all course-connected travels in Scan­dinavia is $3,800. A limited number of scholarship loans are available.

Sheila Sm1th that was set up by a 49-yard pass from Sharon Lopez to Andy Hoffman. Kathy McCann ran the ball in for the extra points and the half ended 14-0. 
The second half was played in pouring rain. Farley mounted a drive early in the half aided by outstanding runs by Chris Datz­man. But on a fourth and 3 on the 9-yard line Farley was stopped. Two plays later Lyons scored on a reverse by Michelle O'Haren that went for 90 yards. Kathy McCann again ran in the extra point and Lyons won 22-0. 
Lewis 16 Farley 0 
Lewis maintained their winning streak and upped their record to 4-0 setting up their match with second place Walsh today. The Lewis defense was splendid especially Maureen Sullivan and Pat Meyer who intercepted passes. Meyer returned her interception to the Farley 4-yard line from where Erin Burns burst up the middle to score a touchdown. Robin Jenkins com­pleted a pass to Anne Burgess for the two point conversion. 
The next time Lewis gained possession of the ball, they moved down to the Farley 6-yard line, a 
drive that was highlighted by the 
running of Mary Ellen Pearce. However on fourth and four, Kathy Gannon broke up a Robin Jenkins pass. A long run by Debbie Bieber moved Farley out of danger as the half ended. 
On the second play of the second half Mary Wood caught a short pass from Robin Jenkins and went 72 yards . to score the second touchdown of the game for Lewis. Again a pass from Jenkins to Burgess was good for the two point conversion. So Lewis, who had been gl'Od on only 1 out of 9 extra point attempts going into the game was successful on both of their at-te·npts.

Tony Pace Merry-Go-Round 
Coaching 

In light of the recent hirings, firings. and interim appointments in the 
ranks of professional coaching, it is good to take a look at coaching 
functions. What is it that makes one coach superior to another? 
First of all. a coach or manager must have a thorough knowledge of the 
sport he is involved with. The strategic decisions of the game must be 
made by the head man. He must also devise a game plan and adjust it to 
the circumstances of the game. While some may 0ccasionally quibble 
with a managerial decision, one would have to admit that the vast majority 
of professional coaches are intelligent within their field. 
Secondly, coaches must be able to evaluate talent. They must know the 
strengths and weaknesses of their players; they must know who to play 
and when to play him. If the rightfielder can hit a ton but has a weak 
throwing arm, he should have a defensive replacement in order to 
preserve late inning leads. 
Thirdly, a coach must create and maintain a ''winning attitude.'' While 
sports people have mutilated this phrase, it is not rhetoric. Of the three 
managerial functions I have discussed, this is the most difficult to 
accomplish. The downfall of most coaches can be attributed to a poor 
team attitude. While some succeed in creating a good attitude, few can 
maintain it. 
Billy Martin and Red Schoendienst have illustrative coaching careers. 
Schoendienst's Cardinals won the World Series in 1967, but they have 
done little recently. As a result, the St. Louis club dismissed Schoendienst 
this past Tuesday. He had a "winning attitude," but he could not 
preserve it. Martin did well for a year in Detroit, Minnesota, and Texas, 
but he failed as the newness wore off. It will be interesting to see how the 
Yankees fare in the playoffs under Martin's tutelage. Maybe he will even 
see his contract come up for renewal. 
The career of Dick Williams has also had its ups and downs. With both 
the Boston Red Sox and the Oakland A's he was a winner. This past 
season, however. he had one of the worst teams in baseball. the California 
Angels. The players hated him and applauded his firing. He was just 
signed by the Montreal Expos. How will he do? I do not know; he has 
lost whatever coaching touch he had and regaining it may be a problem. 
What makes a good coach? The three skills I listed are important, but 
the element of luck has more than a normal bearing. The differences 
between those in the coaching population are not that great when one 
reaches the professional level. It is for that reason that owners will change 
coaches at a moment's notice. As long as this feeling is prevalent, and I 
do not think it will be altered, the merry-gQ-round notion of coaching will 
persist.

Notre Dame graduate. 
Aside from handling the kicking 
duties. Reeve played offensive 
guard at Bloomington South High 
School. Reeve relinquished the 
line chores due to severe shoulder 
burns which he received from an 
explosion while working over the 
summer. 
''The doctors told me I wouldn't 
be able to play football because I 
wouldn't be able to put on a pair of 
shoulder pads," Reeve remarked. 
·'I wouldn't take no for an answer, I 
wanted to play and make any 
contribution to the team that I 
possible could." 
The doctors believed Reeve

Austgen stars 
Dave Austgen led the Notre Dame soccer team to an 8-1 romp over Marian College yesterday. 
Austgen scored on a penalty kick in the second half. the first goal of his four-vear career. Bob Gildead and Tom" Crotty each added two goals for the Irish, but it was the inspired play of Austgen that proved to be the key to victory for Notre Dame. . . 

occurred. Within three weeks of 
the explosion the Bloomington 
native was back on the gridiron in 
time for the opening game. 

"It was really amazing; the 
doctors thought that I would have 
to have grafting for sure," he 
commented. "But the burns 
healed and didn't scar.'' 

Reeve played the entire season, 
earning his second varsity letter 
and setting the record for season 
and career conversions and field 
goals. He connected on 16-24 
three-pointers while notching 104­
114 extra points.

Then high school football ended 
and Reeve had to look to the future. 
Notre Dame was in need of a kicker 
and Reeve was just one of the 
numerous candidates vying for the 
position. Little by little the 
competitors were eliminated,

In February, he was invited to 
visit the campus. "Coach Par­
seghian asked me to show him how 
I kick,·· the Irish kicker stated. "I felt funny going through my kick­ing steps right in his office, but if it was worth a scholarship, I'd do anything." 
"Coach Parseghi.an then asked me if I'd like a scholarship and would like to play football here. It didn't take me very long to decide, because I signed my intent to 
attend Notre Dame the following morning," he related. 
Georgia Tech was the opening game in 1974, and Reeve's first chance to demonstrate his skills. "The field goal I kicked was only 22 yards but to me it was like 80," he 
recalled. "I was so nervous that even my first extra point seemed far." ·

Football Picks 
============================================================:===:=:============================================================================================================================================================================================================================·== 

The Irish Eye
. Things are starting to take shape in college football '76.-Michigan, 
Pitts_burg, Oklahoma and Georgia all look inpressive and appear to be the 
leadmg contenders for the mythical mational championship. Still, one 
can't count out Missouri, Southern Cal and UCLA. Other teams, such as 
Notre Dame and Maryland are also likely to make !.-;;~mds before the 
season ends. 

Miami of Ohio, Penn State and Alabama are all mysteries. Each was 
expected to field powerful teams, only Ito boast losing records. 
But the highlight of the season for many is the agony suffered by Woody 
Hayes at Ohio Stafe. After being beaten at home two weeks ago by 
Missoure, the "mild-mannered" Buckeye mentor was forced' to swallow 
his pride last week in Columbus, playing scared and running out the clock 
in settling for· a tie with UCLA. 
While t,lle Irish have Saturday off, there are .some big games on tap 
across the country. So with the help of this week's Guest Picker, Mary 
Reher, here are the Irish Eye's picks: · 

Swathmore at Franklin & Marshall: Quarterback Joe Coviello will have to be at top form in order to withstand the violent Swarthmore defense. While playing in relative obscurity, Swarthmore is a team on the move. After going eight years without a win, they actually went 1-10 last season--remarkable improvement. Still, Coviello has thrown 43 TD passes in his brillant career at F&M and has his entire offense in high gear. It'll be a battle of offense against defense and look for the offense to win. Franklin & Marshall by 20. Reher: F&M by 7. 
Boise State at Cal Poly Obispo: Cal Poly will have their hands full tomorrow as they battle heavily favored Boise State. Since Coach Tony Knap came to the Broncos, it's been bombs away on route to a 71-18-1 record. Look for Boise STate to continue on their way tomorrow. Boise State by 17. Reher: Boise by 14. 
Vale at Dartmouth: Greg Robinson and his mates on the defense line have been murdering opponents all season as the Big Green are on the move. Yale. unlike Dartmouth, is your typical Ivy League football team'-disgusting. Dartmouth by 6. Reher: Dartmouth by 17. 
Hofstra at New York Tech: Steve Verderosa, the George Sauer-type wide ·eceiver and all-American candidate, leads Tech into tomorrow's critical battle with Hofstra. These two powerhouses are an even match, but the ~dge has to go to Tech who will be playing in front of a partisan sellout :rowd at beautiful Tech Stadium (which, in reality, is C.W. Post's home iield). Tech, who is 3-0, should get their first win of the campaign this weekend. Tech by 6. Reher: Hofstra by 10. 
Southwest Louisiana at Lamar: Lamar is attempting to rebound from a >omewhat disappointing season last year (1-10), and morale is high. ;;ormer Notre Dame player Roy Henry leads the Ragin' Cajuns, and as !hose who remember know, he can throw the football. The SW program is -.m the move and they shouldn't have too much trouble with Lamar. Cajuns by 14. Reher: Cajuns by 7. 
·'iortheast Louisiana at McNeese: It just wouldn't be right to pick Southwest Louisiana without picking Northeast Louisiana. McNeese is ;oming off an excellent 7-4 season and will be all that NE \\ill be able to game, guys were kidding me 

saying, 'This is big stuff now.' 
Coach Blache noticed I was uptight 
and told me not to let the pressure 
bother me, telling me that I'm here 
and I'm good enough to play 
here," Reeve continued. 

In 1974, Parseghian's final year 
as head coach, Reeve was second in 
scoring, hitting 7-10 field goals and 
booting 38-40 extra points. Last 
season Reeve led the team in 
scoring with 57 points, notching 
ll-16 three-pointers and 24-26 
pat's. 

Although being consistent, Reeve has experienced times of difficulty. 
"Coach Kuhlman helps me if I'm in a slump," Reeve said. "He's good because he knows me as a person and he knows when I'm uptight.''
This season the Bloomington
native has connected on 3-5 field goals and 10-12 extra points. His next three-pointer will set an all-time Notre Dame record of 22.

Morgan by 24. 

· North Dakota State at Mankato State: This could be the best game of the weekend. Both sq·uads enter the tilt highly rated, Mankate being ranked number one in the country by the Czar Football Poll. Since the game is in Mankato (wherever that is), they have a definite advantage. Mankato by 
3. Reher: North Dakota by 3. 

lehigh at Bucknell: The Engineers tasted d"efeat last week for the first time. The brutal and ferocious John Matt didn't like it. Despite the loss, Lehigh is ranked seventh in the nation in Division II Lehigh may be the best team in Division 11. Bucknell is favored, but take the Engineers by 6. Reher: Bucknell by 7. 
Morningside at South Dakota: State has a rugged ball club, one that's just too tough for Morningside. It's a great name, but what's in a name? South Dakota State by 12. Reher:Morningside by 3. 
Trinity at McMurray: The Tigers went 6-4-1 last season behind a strong defense and a good air attack. This season they have 18 of last season's starters back, so they're tough. McMurray has a new coach and nothing but question marks. Trinity by 7. Reher: Trinity by 14. 
Tulane at Syracuse: The Orange got their first win of the season last week and are hopeful of turning their season around with another win tomorrow. Tulane is better than people think, but Syracuse needs this game too badly to let it slip away. After going 6-5 last season, a season that gave Orange fans high hopes for this year, Coach Frank Maloney is starting to feel some heat from their 1-3 start. Syracuse by 7. Reher: Tulane by 14. 
Saginaw Valley at Youngstown: Eight seniors will be starting for their fourth consecutive season for Youngstown. Quarterback Cliff Stoudt is a pro prospect and leads. the team. Saginaw Valley may be unknown, but don't be fooled, they are more than capable of producing the upset. Still, it's Youngstown by 9 .. , Reher: Youngstown by 7. · 
O'ReUey State at Stevenson Tech: Quarterback Joe leads a potent O'Reiley offense, but the ,Slim Waiters have their problems on defense. Stevenson relies on Sven Bjorklen, one of the few players still around that starts on both offense and defense. Believe it or not, Bjorkleri plays both ~uarterback and middle linebacker. Behind his play, Tech is hard to beat. Tech by 2. Reher: O'Reiley by 35 (they're small but mighty) 
UPSET OF THE WEEK: 

Oklahoma at Texas: The Sooners are playing good ball now, but so are the Longhorns, who have righted themselves since opening day. Just because it's in Pallas, Texas by 3. Reher: Sooners by 21.
