Associate News Editor 
Keeping in mind last year's debacle-when 1,500 students lined up for tickets, leading to confusion, long lines and out­rage -the Student Union Board said it is prepared to handle the rush of students expected to queue up for the Michigan State away game tick­et lottery today. 
The event, plagued in the past by fraud, organization and hundreds of irate students left with nothing after hours in line, is well in hand this year, said SUB president Jimmy Flaherty. 
Over 1,500 students lined up for tickets to the University of Michigan away game last September -the second largest crowd in the lottery's history.

Campus gambling affects ND community 
University adds section to health class for freshmen students 
By PAUL SPADAFORA 
News Writer 
The University has added a new segment on gambling to the health and fitness class, Contemporary Topics, which all freshmen must take. 
According to physical educa­tion instructor Diane Scherzer, this addition on gambling is designed to raise student awareness of the hazards of gambling. 
"A lot of students don't real­ize gambling can become addictive, and they also don't realize they can get help," Scherzer said. 
She said the program involves an in-class discussion about the consequences of gambling as well as a discus­sion of gambling's addictive nature. 
In addition, the program extends outside of the Contemporary Topics course. In the wellness planners given to this year's freshmen, informa­tion is provided on the social and professional risks of gam­bling. 
"The wellness planner is a good vehicle to disseminate the information," Scherzer said.

Transfers adjust to housing shortage 
By ASHLEY SANDERS 
News Writer 
For some Notre Dame trans­fer students, the usual adjust­ment to a new college has been more complicated than in past years due to the severe on­campus housing shortage at Notre Dame. 
To help alleviate the problem, the University and Saint Mary's allowed some female transfer students to live at the College's Regina Hall until rooms opened up in University residence halls. 
The fifth floor of Regina start­ed as a community of 20 but has dwindled to 13 as students moved to available Notre Dame rooms. 
Transfer student Alyse Kinchen welcomed the option to live on the fifth floor of Regina Hall. 
"It was all going to be trans­fers so we were all in the same boat," she said. 
Kinchen's roommate Michelle Shiriaev, who attended Saint Mary's her freshman year, said her floor is gradually adjusting

Not a good deal 
The average college kid gets most 
of his nutrients from two primary 
food groups -pizza and beer. 
Not only are these staples of the 
collegiate diet delicious, but they eas­

look, I see flyers 
and advertise­
ments for pizzas that seem to get big­
ger and bigger but somehow drop­
ping to record low prices, discounted 
for college kids. Pizza here is more 
common than grass. Even though 
they are virtually giving it away, 
Papa John's, Domino's and Sbarro 
still make a killing at Notre Dame. 
Sadly, they will not take one dollar 
of mine. My world crashed in around 
me on July 11, when my doctor told 
me I was a Celiac. Celiac Sprue is a 
genetic disorder that causes the 
patient to have an intolerance to 
gluten, a protein in grains such as 
wheat and barley. I come from a 
long, proud tradition of Celiacs. Both 
my mother and father have the gene. 
While some families produce world­
class athletes and others produce 
great thinkers, we generate people 
who can't eat bread. 
The worst part of Saturday evening 
didn't even involve football. It came 
at halftime. when my friends came 
back with two large pizzas and a 
case of beer. Though offered some~ I 
had to respectfully decline, seeing 
how my stale rice crackers and Coke 
more than filled me up, and then 
explain for the 4000th time why I 
couldn't eat normal person food any­
more. 
Overnight, I have become that kid, the one at the birthday party who never had cake and always brought his own snacks. No matter how pop­ular, that kid never seemed to have a good time, and now I know why. Every party I have every attended outside of the dorms has had a keg of beer. To my knowledge, not one per­son who's thrown a party has thought to stock up on something like hard apple cider, just in case. 
.The dining hall has become a repetitive nightmare as well. At what was once an overwhelming smorgasbord that could satisfy what­ever craving I could conjure up I now eat only stir fry, grilled chicken, and tater-tots. I still haven't even entered the pasta room at NOH, my old reli­able on "two-week-old ham" night. 
Not everything about my new life is all bad. Because I'm forced to eat healthy, my midsection is no longer as soft as a jelly donut, which I can't cat anyway. If you want to know what brands of rice pasta to buy, I'm your man. 
Still, some wounds may never heal. Every time I see a pizza deliveryman, it's like a slap in the face. Cans of beer laugh at me. Every day I'm painfully reminded of what used to be. 
My doctor says that they're devel­oping a drug that could reverse the effects of this disorder. She tells me it could be on the market in three years. Perfect. Just in time for full­priced pizza.

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Students consider adding tnetnbers 
By ELIZABETH CHEFFERS 
News Writer 
Members of the Council of Representatives met Monday to dis­cuss the possibility of adding three new non-voting members to the council. from RecSports, Campus Ministry and the Center for Social Concerns. 
Such a move would facilitate better communication between different interests in the student body, mem­bers said. 
Kate Dissler. a member of the CSC student advisory board Voice, spoke at the meeting about the CSC's possi­ble participation in COR. 
"The CSC plays such a major role in so many campus events and they do not have a voice on any of the major programming boards," she said. 
Student body president Adam Istvan said he would support the addition of a esc representative. 
"It would be a completely new, a completely outside voice," said Istvan. 
The council plans to vote on the proposition at next week's meeting. 
The RecSports representative would be chosen from the athletic advisory board, which includes dorm athletic commissioners and faculty members. 
"All three of these organizations do a lot of programming events on cam­pus, and so it makes a lot of sense to have them here to help us spitball ideas," Istvan said. 
The group also discussed the Rock the Vote project. Representative Dave Baron introduced Peter Quaranta, a member of the Rock the Vote steering committee, who gave a presentation on the overall goals and upcoming events he hoped student government would support. 

"We're fighting apathy every way we know how," Quaranta said. 
Quaranta said Rock the Vote was formed to combat the traditional apa­thy of Notre Dame students. It is a non-partisan group that includes rep­resentatives from various campus organizations such as College Republicans, College Democrats, the CSC, the political science, English and film, television and theater depart­ments. 
"We've had some trouble because some people are afraid we are going to disrupt 'business as usual' on cam­pus, but these are big times no mat­ter where you stand," Quaranta said.

Saint Mary's Board of Governance approved revisions to its constitution Monday. 
"I am very excited to approve the Constitution," student body president Sarah Catherine White said. "A lot of hard work went into this." 
Campus Clubs commissioner Becky Bosak presented seven new clubs to BOG, which the board had approved for club status. The new clubs are College Democrats, Dance Collectives, Feminists United, Friends with Sisters, History Oub, Super Sibs and Toastmasters I. 
White said she had recently talked with new College president Carol Mooney. BOG will host several "meet-and-greet" events with the stu­dent body, according to White. 
The first "Dessert with Dr. Mooney" will take place Sunday at 6:30 p.m. in Holy Cross Hall. Mooney will also be having dessert with stu­dents in McCandless Hall on Oct. 10, Regina Hall on Oct. 31 and LeMans Hall on Nov. 21. 
In other BOG news: 

+ Student Activity Board president Lauren Fabina reported an overwhelming success with last week's "Singled Out" game at Dalloway's. 
"We are really looking forward to our next MTV-themed game, Room Raiders," Fabina said. 
The SAB's annual Twilight Tailgate will be Thursday with a performance by the band Blessed Union of Souls. The tailgate will also consist of a barbeque and inflatables.

popular over the summer," 
Steele said. "With the numbers 
increasing like they are we're 
going to start to see people with 
gambling problems." 
Knott rector Brother Jerome 
Meyer also said poker playing 
was up among his residents, 
but disagreed with Steele's wor­
ries about addiction. 
"Right now I don't see it as a 
problem," Meyer said. "It's a 
social activity that pulls them 
together. If it got out of hand 
then we'd deal with it ... We're 
keeping on top of what's going 
on but right now we don't see it 
as a major problem." 
Gambling is low on the list of 
dorms' disciplinary priorities, 
said Father George Rozum, rec­
tor of Alumni. 
"It was a problem a long time 
ago, [but) there are concerns 
that are much bigger," he said. 
Among students who gamble, 
the consensus was one of harm­
less -not addictive -fun that 
rarely resulted in losing signifi­
cant amounts of money. 
"It's not a problem because 
I'm not out of control," sopho­
more Kevin Brennan said. "I 
don't gamble to the extreme." 
Senior Brian Hagan, whose 
worst loss was only $10, 
agreed. 
"The majority of the time stu­
dents control the habit and play 
until they break even, and then 
stop," he said. 
Though sophomore Jim 
Theiss reported a one-time loss 
of $45, he continues to gamble 
about three times a week. He 
said he spends between three 
and nine hours a week on gam­
ing, an amount he described as 
typical among his friends. 
Most students agreed the dif­ference between a gambling hobby and a gambling addiction involves the frequency of play and the amount of money lost. 
And because gambling is readily accessible -not requir­ing transportation, a large time commitment or anything more than a deck of cards -it has become a simple, habitual form of entertainment. 
Gambling "is good recreation­al fun as long as people don't get carried away with it," soph­omore Michael Pazirandeh said. 
Senior Brendan Bowes said gaming and gambling are posi­tive ways to socially interact with peers. 
"Poker with the guys, and sometimes girls, has almost entirely been a fun social activi­ty, and I've made friends doing it," he said. 
Social gambling at Notre Dame is not exclusive to males, said Elizabeth Tran, a resident assistant in Breen-Phillips. 
"I see a lot of participation in football and basketball pools, but I wouldn't consider it a problem," said Tran, who added that she often also observed students of both sexes gambling ofT-campus.

Nation mourns victims of siege 
BESLAN, Russia-Funeral processions filled the rainy streets of this southern Russian city Monday, carrying coffins large and small, as townspeople buried scores of victims of a carefully planned school siege that prosecutors linked to a Chechen rebel leader. 
Desperate families searched for those still missing from the siege at School No. 1, while others buried 120 victims during the first of two days of national mourning across Russia, which has seen more than 400 people killed in violence linked to terrorism in the past two weeks. 
Heports emerged that the attackers appar­ently planned the school seizure months ago, sneaking weapons into the building in advance. There also were signs that some of the militants did not know they were to take children hostage and may have been killed by their comrades when they objected.

Hurricane warnings were issued for Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Grenada. Martinique was place under a hurricane watch, while Trinidad and Tobago were under a tropical storm warning. 
Barbados' Prime Minister Owen Arthur convened an emergency session of the Cabinet Monday to plan a strategy against Hurricane Ivan.

SAN FRANCISCO -Firefighters were ham­pered by erratic wind and low humidity Monday as they made slow progress against a fire that had burned nearly 12,000 acres and four homes in the Northern California wine country. 
The fire, which started Friday northeast of Geyserville in Sonoma County, had been 20 percent contained and full containment was not expected until Wednesday, said Janet Marshall, spokeswoman for the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. 
The unpredictable wind and dry vegeta­tion, compounded by uneven and often steep terrain, made the situation extremely dan­gerous for the 1,875 firefighters, Marshall said.

Iraq overshadowed the traditional Labor Day kickoff of the fall campaign and its time-honored emphasis on jobs, as Kerry delivered some of his harshest rhetoric against Bush's handling of the war and highlighted its economic costs.

Associated Press 
FORT PIERCE, Fla. ­Weakened but persistent, Tropical Storm Frances took aim at the_Florida Panhandle on Monday after the former· hurri­cane caused flooding and ripped roofs off buildings throughout a wide swath of central and southern Florida. About 6 million people lost power and at least five people were killed. 
More than 13 inches of rain had fallen along Florida's central east coast, flooding some areas 4 feet deep, before Frances entered the Gulf of Mexico late Sunday. In its wake, boats and mobile homes were man­gled, trees and power lines were toppled. 
State officials urged people to stay where they were because of the possi­bility of flooding and the difficulty of finding serv­ice stations still in opera­tion.

Suicide bomb kills seven in Iraq 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD, Iraq -A suicide attacker sped up to a U.S. military convoy outside Fallujah and deto­nated an explosives-packed vehicle on Monday, killing seven Marines and three Iraqi soldiers, U.S. mili­tary officials said. It was the dead­liest day for American forces in four months. 
The force of the blast on a dusty stretch of wasteland nine miles north of Fallujah, a hotbed of Sunni insurgents, wrecked two Humvee vehicles and hurled the suicide car's engine far from the site, witnesses and military offi­cials said. 
The bombing underscored the challenges U.S. commanders face in securing Fallujah and surround­ing Anbar province, the heartland of a Sunni Muslim insurgency bent on driving coalition forces from the country. 
U.S. forces have not patrolled in Fallujah since ending a three-week siege of the city in April that had been aimed at rooting out militia­man. Insurgents have only strengthened their hold on Fallujah since then. 
Early Tuesday, residents reported strong explosions around Baghdad. But the U.S. command said it had no information. 
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry said medical tests confirmed that Iraqi authorities had once again mistakenly reported the capture of ousted dictator Saddam Hussein's deputy, Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, putting a stop to two days of con­flicting statements about his pur­ported arrest. 
Ministry spokesman Sabah Kadhim said unspecified tests had shown that a man being held in Iraqi custody was actually a rela­tive of al-Douri who played only a minor role in Saddam's regime but was nevertheless wanted by authorities.

Lottery 
continued from page 1 
At that lottery, SUB placed no limits on the number of IDs per student, producing long lines, and ended the lottery earlier than necessary because organiz­ers misinterpreted NCAA and Indiana state rules governing lot­teries. Prior to 2003, lotteries were plagued with fraud as indi­viduals who were not students and SUB staff members obtained tickets. Now, SUB uses a machine to check student Ids. 
However, changes in location and hours should prevent similar problems this year, Flaherty said. "Last year's issues with the ticket lottery occurred with the first one of the year when the lottery was held both at Reekers and the North Dining Hall," he said. "Last year's Executive Board recog­nized the issues and made great changes to the process by switching it to Legends and mak­ing the guidelines more explicit."

Western countie~ approach ghost town status 
Associated Press 
CONDON. Ore.-If Gilliam County loses much more popula­tion, its wide open spaces and col­lection of three tiny towns -with no stoplights and 1.6 square miles for every person -could soon become a veritable nowhere. 
Percentage-wise, it regularly tops the census list of Oregon counties that are losing popula­tion, a steady stream uf about 80 or 100 people every year. 
And Gilliam County is far from the only place in the rural West that's in danger of becoming a ghost county. In places like Clearwater County, Idaho; Niobrara County, Wyo.; and Treasure County, Mont., the loss of 100 or so people regularly translates to population declines of 5 or 7 percent, year after year. 
The drop is fueled primarily by two factors: old-timers who die. and young people who move away. 
"Our teens graduate and they leave, and why not?" said Jan Eason, an associate pastor at a Nazarene church in Gilliam 
County. "What is there to come 
back for?" 

In Niobrara County, Wyo., which has just 2,237 people left after a decline of 7.1 percent between 2000 and 2003, 18.7 percent of residents are over 65, compared with 11.7 percent statewide. 
And if the trends continue, in a decade or two, some such coun­ties may be virtually empty. 
"People either move to Billings, or, if they get really old, they go into assisted living or they die," Treasure County Commissioner Mack Cole said after a round of census figures last year showed that population there had dipped to 735 people. "The future is about what is now." 
Some places. though, don't want to give up, including once­prosperous Gilliam County, whose farmers supplied wheat and grain to a battered world after World War II. 
As other nations rebuilt, demand slipped. By 1984, many local farmers felt they had no choice but to take the buyout money offered by that year's

: 
Farm Bill, aimed at curbing over­production, and protecting eroded agricultural lands. 
By the early 1990s, the county's economic backbone was gone. County leaders were searching for any kind of moneymaker at all. All they really had to offer was plenty of vast, empty space. 
Fortunately, that was just what urban areas like Portland, 137 miles up Interstate 84, needed ­a vast, empty space to put tra'sh. Gilliam County became the site of an environmentally sound rural landfill, a distinction which now brings in $1 million a year to the county's tax rolls, and is a linch­pin of what remains of the econo­my. 

"At night, we sit in our porch swing, and count the garbage trucks that go by," said county resident Darlene Smythe, 70. 
Fueled by that success, the county placed an ad in The Los Angeles Times that touted the low cost of living, clean air, and non­existent traffic in Condon. National media parachuted into the story, and the responses poured in; when the dust cleared, 
there were some new faces on the 
street. But they were mostly 
retirees, who didn't come with 
new jobs in tow. 
Next, the county helped bankroll a nonprofit assisted liv­ing center, a move, Gilliam County Judge Laura Pryor said, to "stabi­lize, so generations can stay together." 
But perhaps the crown jewel in the county's attempt to save itself from extinction is the Hotel Condon, the anchor of Condon's downtown, and once abandoned and empty, save for the occasional bat. 
A motley group of investors ­the local newspaper editor, farm­ers. ranchers, the district attor­ney, the owner of alocal chemical company-decided they couldn't bear to see the grand old dame of a building waste away. 
They all chipped in. as did the county, and little by little, the hotel was restored to its former glory. with period light fixtures and velvet drapes, as well as modern conveniences not ·often found in small town hostelries, like wireless Internet access. ·

Floppy disk reaches old age 
ATLANTA-When Michael McCreary bought three new computers for his company, he had no need for one of the oldest and most com­mon computer technologies, the floppy drive. 
But like many computer customers. he ended up buying floppies anyway. After all, they're cheap and he still has a few of the 3.5­inch disks lying around. 
"As long as I need those files. I need a floppy drive around. Then I can toss them," said McCreary, the president of an eight-employee Atlanta-area real estate management compa­ny. "The next computers I buy probably won't even have a floppy." 
Long the most common way to store letters, homework and other computer files, the flop­py .is going the way of the horse upon the arrival of the car: it'll hang around but never hold the same relevance in everyday life. 
And good riddance, say some home comput­er users. The march of technology must go on. Like the penny, the floppy drive is hardly worth the trouble, computer makers say. 
Stocks lower on jobs picture 
NEW YORK -Stocks were modestly lower in Friday as investors sorted through an uninspiring employment report and Intel Corp.'s weak profit outlook hit technology shares hard. 
Investors were satisfied with -but not impressed by -the Labor Department's latest reading on unemployment, which fell to 5.4 per­cent from 5.5 percent in July, and the 144,000 jobs created in August was close to the 150,000 Wall Street had expected. 
"I think this continues the pattern of decent eco­nomic growth," said Ken Tower, chief market strategist for Schwab's CyberTrader. "It's not light­ing a fire under anyone, nor is it suggesting the economy is on the edge of a serious contraction. So the market can focus elsewhere, with oil prices likely the biggest hinge for the market right now." 
One day after a sharp drop in crude oil sparked a major stock rally, a ba1Tel of crude was quoted at $43.93, down 13 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
Meanwhile, Intel's profit warnings continued to weigh on the markets, casting a pall not only on technology shares but also raising concerns about third-quarter earnings in other sectors. 
Alitalia plans to cut 5,000 jobs 
To avoid collapse, Italian carrier will cut almost one-fourth of its workforce 
Associated Press ROME -Italy's flagship air carrier Alitalia plans to cut 5,000 jobs as part of restructuring efforts ­aimed at avoiding col­lapse, news reports and an industry source said Monday. The cuts are almost a fourth of Alitalia's 22,000­strong workforce. The Italian news agency ANSA and other reports cited union sources. An industry source confirmed the reports, but did not elaborate. Alitalia met with nine union leaders at the com­pany's headquarters in Rome to discuss the restructuring plan and persuade reluctant unions to go along with the efforts. The approval of the recovery plan is crucial to the company's survival as it would allow Alitalia to access a $488 million loan approved by the Italian government and the European Union. Without the loan, Alitalia says it has enough liquidity to pay salaries only until the end of this month.

Chickenpox shots save $100 million in hospitalization costs 
Vaccinations help prevent hospital stays 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Vaccinating chil­dren against chickenpox saves the U.S. health care system nearly $100 million a year in reduced hospitalizations for severe cases of the itchy dis­case, a study found. 
Though most people who get the usually mild disease can be treated at home. chickenpox can be serious, and complica­tions requiring hospitalization can include severe skin infec­tions, encephalitis and pneumo­nia. 

In 1993, two years before the government licensed the vac­cine for routine use in early childhood. nearly 14,000 Americans were hospitalized for chickenpox-related compli­cations at a cost of $161 mil­lion. compared with 3,729 hos­pitalizations and $66 million in 
related  costs  in  2001,  the  
researchers estimated.  
Routine  vaccination  has  

reduced cases in young children who get the shots and helped keep the disease from spread­ing to unvaccinated older chi!­
dren and adults. in whom the disease tends to be more severe. 
The reduction in the disease "is excellent news for the vac­cine program," said lead researcher Dr. Matthew Davis, a University of Michigan pediatri­cian who said he has no ties to the vaccine makers. The study was funded by the university. 
Dr. Ben Z. Katz. an infectious disease specialist at Chicago's Children's Memorial Hospital, said the numbers are believable and were not unexpected. 
"There's less complications. less hospitalizations. and you're saving money to boot. It's all good news." Katz said. 
The study appears in September's Pediatrics, pre­pared for release Tuesday. 
Davis and colleagues analyzed 1993-2001 data from a nation­ally representative annual com­pilation of patients discharged from hundreds of hospitals nationwide, including informa­tion on costs and diagnoses. 
Before 1995, 41 percent of patients hospitalized for chick­enpox were children from infancy through age 4, com­pared with 33 percent for peo­ple age 20 and older. That pat­tern reversed by 2001, when 28 percent of chickenpox-related hospitalizations were very young children and 46 percent were adults, the researchers found. 
Despite indirect protection from vaccinating young chil­dren. adults and teens who have not yet had chickenpox should consider getting the shots themselves, Davis said. This is especially important for those who work with young children and for women of childbearing age, because the disease can be dangerous for the developing fetus, and the shots are not advised during pregnancy. he said. 

Police say single person responsible for 6 killings 
Associated Press 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -Police said Monday they believe a single killer was responsible for the slayings of six people whose bodies were found within a blighted 18-block area fre­quented by drug addicts and prosti­tutes. 
Police Capt. Rich Lockhart would not say what led police to connect the killings to a single person; the crimes have not been linked forensi­cally. Authorities previously had said they thought the killings were related, though they had not theo­rized the slayings were the work of 

one person. Police were working with the FBI to develop a profile of the killer. 
One of those slain was found in July, but five others have been dis­covered since Thursday -including those found after someone calling 911 told police where to look. 
All the bodies were discovered on vacant lots or near vacant houses or apartments in an area east Of down­town where drug dealers and prosti­tutes were known to congregate. 
Lockhart said police were looking for similarities between the victims and the crime scenes. Police have not said how the victims died; autop­sies were under way Monday. 
Culinary institute unable to 
account for 111issing revenue 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -The James Beard Foundation, a nonprofit organization created to promote culinary excellence, cannot account for hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual revenue, according to one of its trustees. 
The accounting problem -the latest in a series of financial irregularities involving the foundation -was due to the organization's rapid growth, trustee George Sape told The New York Times for Monday editions. 
Sape would not comment on how much money was unaccounted for or how it might have been spent. 
Leonard Pickell Jr., the foundation's presi­dent, is expected to resign from the board of trustees. the Tunes reported. 
Pickell denied that funds had been misspent or misplaced, saying the accounting discrep­ancy was due instead to "bad record-keeping and insufficient resources," the Times said. 
The organization also is under investigation by the New York state attorney general's office for not filing tax returns for the past two years. 
Critics said the Beard Foundation's appar­ent financial irresponsibility undermined its charitable mission: to promote up-and-com­ing chefs. It arranges some 300 dinners and lunches each year at which guests pay up to $150 to sample dishes prepared by founda­tion-approved chefs. 
University of Notre Dame Annual Drinking Water Quality Report: Consumer Confidence Report 2003 
The amendments to the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act requires each public water supply to produce a water quality report titled the "Consumer Confidence Report" (CCR). Following is the University's annual report for the 2003 calendar year.  The University's water system is operated by Facilities Engineering. It is a privately owned public water supply. The University's system provides water to the University community, the nearby 
C.S.C. properties, and Holy Cross Community College. Questions regarding the system or sampling results can be directed to Paul Kempf, Director of Utilities, 102 Facilities Building, Notre Dame, IN, 46556, phone 574-631-6594 or Mike McCauslin, Assistant Director, Risk Management and Safety, 636 Grace Hall, Notre Dame, IN, 46556, phone 574-631-5037. 
There are currently five wells serving the water system. All are located on the campus proper. The water is drawn from deep aquifers that are adequately protected by substantial clay barriers that 
serve to protect the groundwater supply. We do not believe that our source is vulnerable to contamination. We are also taking steps to ensure that our water source does not become contaminated 
and are in the final stages of what is known as a Wellhead Protection Program. This program assists in defining where the water supply comes from and methods to protect the aquifers from future 
contamination. 

The sources of drinking water (both tap water and bottled) include rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs, and wells. As water travels over the surface of the land or through the ground, it 
dissolves naturally-occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material, and can pick up substances resulting from the presence of animals or from human activity. Drinking water, including 
bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of contaminants does not necessarily indicate the water poses a health risk. More 
information about contaminants and potential health affects can be obtained by calling the Environmental Protection Agency's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (1-800-426-4791) or at the EPA's website at 
www.epa.gov/safewater. Contaminants that might be expected to be in source water (untreated water) include: 
 
Microbial contaminants, such as viruses and bacteria, which may come from sewage treatment plants, septic systems, agricultural livestock operations, and wildlife. 

 
Inorganic contaminants, such as salts and metals, which can be naturallyoccurring or result from urban stormwater runoff, industrial or domestic wastewater discharges, oil and gas production, min­ing or framing. 

 
Pesticides and herbicides, which may come from a variety of sources such as agriculture, urban stormwater runoff, and residential uses. 

 
Organic chemical contaminants, including synthetic and volatile organic chemicals, which are by-products of industrial processes and petroleum production, and can also come from gas stations, urban stormwater runoff, and septic systems. 

 
Radioactive contaminants, which can be naturally-occurring or be the result of oil and gas production and mining activities. 


Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population. lmmuno-compromised persons such as persons with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, per­sons who have undergone organ transplants, people with HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders, some elderly, and infants can be particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their health care providers. EPA/CDC guidelines on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by Cryptosporidium and microbial contaminants are available 
from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline (1-800-426-4791) or website www.epa.gov/safewater. Infants and young children are typically more vulnerable to lead in drinking water than the general population. In general, if you flush your cold tap until the water gets as cold as it is going to get, you will have eliminated the potential metal concentration. Additional information is available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline (1-800-4264791) or website www.epa.gov/safewater. 
We have tested for over 150 parameters regulated by the EPA and the State of Indiana. Included in these tests were metals, volatile organics, pesticides, herbicides, SOC's and cyanide.

The vessel typically comes from elsewhere in the chest, although doctors sometimes take one from an arni, a leg or the stomach.

research has shown. 
1V thus "may create the illu­sion that sex is more central to daily life than it truly is and may promote sexual initiation as a result," the researchers said. 
"When they're watching it for three hours a day, it really does become their social world. Those characters are people they iden­tify with and pay attention to," said Collins, the lead researcher.

The study appears in September's Pediatrics, released Tuesday. 
The results are based on nationwide telephone surveys of 1, 792 adolescents queried in 2001 and again in 2002. Parental consent for participa­tion was obtained before the interviews.

But many say they wish they'd wait­ed longer to have sex, and televi­sion might be among factors influencing them to become sex­ually active too soon, the researchers said. 
Liliana Escobar-Chaves, a researcher at the University of Texas School of Public Health, said the findings illustrate the importance of parents viewing and discussing TV with their kids, and of encouraging TV writers to depict sex responsibly. 
The latter effort is a focus of 
other sexually transmitted dis­eases, she said.

then were asked how often they watched those 23 shows. They also were asked whether they engaged in various sexual activi­ties; results were compared from the two surveys. 
The number of teens who reported having had intercourse climbed from about 18 percent to 36 percent. The number who'd had sexual experiences other than intercourse climbed from 62 percent to 75 percent, Collins said. 
Factors that increased the like­lihood of having intercourse included being older, having older friends and getting poor grades. But even considering those factors, television still remained a strong influence, the researchers said. 
Many youngsters start having sex during their teen years, and sion with an educated eye," said Melissa Havard, the group's director. 
One example is an HIVIAIDS effort the group has collaborated on with media giant Viacom, whose properties include CBS and MTY. In the past year and a half, Viacom has produced 22 shows with positive HIV mes­sages, including a "Star Trek" episode in which Vulcans had to deal with the stigma of having an AIDS-like disease, said Viacom spokesman Carl Folta. 
But while acknowledging that television "eertainly can make an impact," Folta was skeptical of the study results. 
"I don't think television makes anybody do anything," Folta said. It's just one of many factors that influence young people's lives, he said.

WhatJohn Kerry will do for America 
Politics is a rather contentious topic at my house these days. My father has long espoused the view that Bill Clinton is the devil incarnate and that John Kerry and John Edwards are only days away from picking up pitch­Katie Boyle forks and branding the country with their own version of 
For lt1zat It's red-hot liberalism. Worth In contrast, I spent my summer in Washington D.C. work­ing for the Democratic National Committee. This decision caused not only raised eyebrows, but a few epithets as well. Even my 77 -year-old grandmother told me before I left, "Honey, it's never too late to change your mind. You could still vote for George Bush when you walk into that ballot box." Although not everyone in my family is Republican, as you can imagine. going against this grain has made for an interesting time. While at home, I find myself defending my views against an intelligent and well­informed debater, and while in D.C. I could always hear the ever-critical voice of my dad pointing out the vari­ous flaws in the liberal party line. In response to Republican criticism, it is relatively easy to deride President Bush's policies during his term. And indeed, his political record will be an important factor this November. Rather than simply point­ing out the flaws in Bush's record, however, it is vital that Kerry also provide voters with his own blueprint for the future of the United States. In addition, Kerry supporters, while retaining their right to criticize the President. need to focus on what John Kerry will do for America rather than on what George Bush has not. The problem is not that such infor­
mation is unavailable. One may look on either www.johnkerry.com or www.georgewbush.com to find a watered-down-for-the-general-public version of each candidate's proposals. Unfortunately, in an election many tout as the most important of our life­time, it appears that our next presi­dent will be chosen by the 10 percent or less who still remain undecided. Most of these will select either Kerry or Bush in the month or even the week before the election. 
While exceptions clearly exist, it is also more likely that these voters will not carefully research their choices. They will make up their minds based on 30 second commercials sand­wiched between shampoo ads and praises for McDonald's newest Value Meal. Many of these campaign spots will present skewed statistics which appear to condemn the opposing can­didate. 
To take advantage of the statistical dead heat in which our incumbent president finds himself, Kerry advo­cates need to counteract the current apathy of this section of the elec­torate. A virtual grassroots publicity blitz, backed by a thorough under­standing of the tenets of Kerry's cam­paign plan. is vital. 
With the unprecedented polariza­tion of the nation, it is only too easy to engage in vitriolic attacks on either candidate. It is a shame, how­ever, to reduce this election to such black and white statements. Neither man has an unsullied record and nei­ther platform is ideal. One candidate, however, clearly demonstrates the direction in which our country needs to be led. 
The Kerry-Edwards campaign slo­gan claims their team will make America "stronger at home [and] respected around the world." This approach is a plan for our nation. 
Look at George W. Bush's platform as well. The Bush-Cheney ticket's slogan is "Heart and soul. Moving America forward." This phrase exemplifies the exclusively internal focus champi­oned, rather arrogantly, by the cur­rent administration. It is, of course, imperative that our future president have the well-being of our nation as his top priority. In my opinion, how­ever, the only way to provide and plan for the strength and security of the United States lies in being cog­nizant of the larger world that sur­rounds us. John Kerry's vision includes that world. He recognizes the need for a firm yet respectful and collaborative attitude within foreign relations. He will be an advocate for our safety and security. He will help boost economic growth. He will pro­mote education and the environment. 
John Kerry and his platform are controversial. One would be hard pressed to find a worthwhile politi­cian who is not. America deserves the courage of Kerry's convictions and his platform's agenda over the next four years. John Kerry is not flaw­less. But neither is he the lesser of two evils as a sole focus on attacking Bush implies. At this point in time, the best way to support him is to explain why John Kerry instead of why not George Bush. 
I don't believe there is a perfect choice for America in the upcoming election. I do, however, strongly believe there is a clear choice and that our next president should be John Kerry.

Bryant case leaves both parties with stained reps 
The Kobe Bryant case has been on our TVs, radios and in our e-mails for a little more than a year, but the segment that had the public's attention -the trial -is now over. 
District Judge Terry Ruckriegle threw out the case Wednesday in a deal where no criminal charges can be filed. Apparently the woman who filed the complaint dropped the charges because A rica she didn't want to participate and be sub­Jefferson jected to more relentless media coverage. 
I cannot for a minute say that I under-The Houston stand what it's like to be sexually assault-Daily Cougar ed. but I can say that if I were and knew who the perpetrator was, I would want to see him brought to justice. 
The 20-year-old woman's credibility was put in jeopardy when the defense attorneys tried to get her mental health admitted as evidence to show her instability and desire for attention. The case breaker was when the judge said the defense could use her recent sexual history against it's client's accuser. By that time it seemed as though from the outside looking in, and apparently from the inside looking out, their case was deteriorating. On top of all of that, District Attorney Mark Hurlbert said the woman did not and was not going to testify .

Vote by 5 p.m. Thursday at www.ndsmcobserver.com 

Hurlbert told ESPN.com the decision to drop the case "is not based upon a lack of belief in the victim," but it's evi­dent that there was a lack of belief in something some­where. 
Bryant, 26, wasn't let off scot-free. Under the conditions that the case could never be filed again. he had to make a public apology to his accuser. She is quoted on FoxSports.com saying she "insisted on that statement as a price of freedom." Even though the criminal trial is over. a civil suit is still pending and the only thing won in civil suits are -surprise -money. 
I, for one, am glad the messy ordeal is over. It's sad that now both of them are going to have to spend quite a bit of time rebuilding their reputations. I hope the woman gets through this and lives a wonderful life. 
As for Kobe, I hope he has learned his lesson and that others have learned from him that everything that looks good isn't good for you.

War on terror needs candidates' creativity 
Whether local or national, let there be no mistake -Election Day 2004 is quickly approaching. For Americans, it is time to engage in some much needed decision making on the issues that matter most. Two months remain before voters choose which candidate will defend those issues best. 
The war on terror continues to be the issue Ryan that begs for creative answers by both candi­Stalnaker dates running for president. The Bush adminis­tration is the first in what will be a long line of Texas Tech presidents who must use innovation and creativi~ University ty to fight this lingering problem. Daily 
As Afghanistan and Iraq move toward free­dom, it is time to evaluate where we were and where we're headed. What is next with regard to the international fight against terrorism? What is next here at home for maintaining and increasing homeland security? 
The questions above should be the foremost concern of voters across the nation. Terrorism, being the unconventional war it is, will be fought with less power and more fmesse. Bush, in his three years as president, created the Department of Homeland Security, the 
U.S.A. Patriot Act and the TSA. Not a bad start, considering he has outlined further ideas for a second term. 
Kerry must match this by explaining a unique strategy for main­taining security aside from the clich, feel-good remedies he has pro­posed. The American people deserve much more than Kerry saying "ditto" to the 9/11 Commission or offering universally agreed-upon ideas. Adding troops and strengthening the military are wonderful, but where is the innovation? 
Kerry must explain what it means to "lead a coalition of the able," as it states on his Web site. Post 9/11, the world thrives on intelli­gence gathering. Kerry uses opponents ofthe war in Iraq (France, Germany, Russia, etc.) to be indicative of our opponents in the war on terror. We continue to share intelligence on a continual basis with countless nations, including those who failed to assist America in Operation: Iraqi Freedom. When free nations share the burden of intelligence, everyone benefits. So what is this new "coalition?" 
Kerry's inconsistent stance on the U.S.A. Patriot Act is also room for concern. In the aftermath of 9/11, Kerry gave his support to this cornerstone ofdomestic security, even writing portions of the bill. 
"I believe these serious threats to our security justify our passing this legislation swiftly," he stated in 2001. Now he wavers on how much or how little he supports the Patriot Act. 
The real issue at stake is whether Kerry has any unique ideas for making America safer. If stem cells and abortion prevented terror­ism, I guess Kerry has all the answers. Where are the efforts to bring business into the fight against terrorism? Where are the ideas for reforming intelligence gathering? 
Kerry has made the case that America is less safe due in part to the Bush administration. If that is true, then creative solutions should exist in abundance. Either Kerry has no ideas or wants to keep them a secret until his inauguration. Either way, it is bad for stability in troubling times. America does not need a Socratic talk from John Kerry; it needs clarity when it comes to protecting inno­cent lives. For voters, the choice has never been so obvious. It is cre­ativity versus ambiguity, and ambiguity is almost out of time.

No matter what happens on the field, we as 
students, have a repu­tation for creating the finest home field experi­ence in the 
nation. Before I was a stu­dent here, I was in awe when I watched on TV as the Notre Dame 
student body clapped to drum cadences, sang the fight song until they were blue in the face and did countless pushups after a Notre Dame touchdown. The third and most important reason for attending Saturday's game deals with our opponent. I attended the game last year in Ann Arbor and experienced a culture that was so distasteful and so arrogant that I thanked my lucky stars for 
Notre Dame and the class we exhibit in both victory and defeat. 
Whether we like it or not, Michigan fans will be here on Saturday, but we must do everything we can to keep them out of our house. The traditions we hold dear will be completely disregarded. We can't control what happens on the field, but we as students have an obligation to do our part. Our part is to show up, cheer loud, and support our classmates no matter what the outcome. So I urge all of you. Freshman this will be your first. Seniors this is the begin­ning of your final season. Give it everything you have, this is time you won't have back. And maybe, just maybe we can rekindle a little bit of the magic that drove the Four Horsemen, Knute Rockne and the 11 national championship teams that provide the foun­dation for the traditions we hold dear. Maybe, just maybe we can win this one.

DVD REVIEW 

Season 6 of ~sex and the City' delivers 
By MOLLY GRIFFIN Scene DVD Critic 
The final season of a television show usually goes one of two ways. More often than not, the final season reminds you why it's going off of the air in the first place with uninspired episodes and a feeling of obligation to wrap up all plot lines. The rarer end to a show is a season that makes you wish that the show would go on forev­er. "Sex and the City," Season 6 Part 1, while not the complete final season, manages to keep the show fresh while slowly and subtly wrapping up the loose ends in preparation for the final farewell. 
"Sex and the City" is a completely character-driven show as the entire premise is following the love lives of four single New York women. The four women are Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), the shoe-addicted sex-column writer; Charlotte (Kristen Davis). the WASP-y art gallery director; Miranda (Cynthia Nixon). the cynical lawyer; and Samantha (Kim Cattrall), the man­eating PR executive. Some episodes may be confusing to those who are jumping into the series cold, because they follow a story-arc built up over the past five seasons, but the series can still be enjoyed by just about any­one, even males. 


Season 6 opens with "Market to Market," a great episode comparing the volatility of the stock market with the instability and uncertainty of dat­ing. Carrie begins her relationship with Jack Berger (Ron Livingston of "Office Space" fame). another writer. Their union seems blissful, until both of them release books at the same time. While Carrie finds major success with her book, Berger is dropped by his publisher and the whole thing ends with Berger dumping her on a Post-it note, prompting one of the funniest episodes on the disc, "The Post-it Always Sticks Twice." 
While Carrie's love life takes a turn for the worse, her friends have their own personal adventures. Miranda is torn between her love for the bar­tender Steve (David Eigenberg). the father of her baby, and the perfect New York Knicks doctor (Blair Underwood) she's dat­ing. Charlotte finally finds true love with Harry (Evan Handler), but they face a dilemma when marriage becomes an issue because he's Jewish and she isn't. Samantha has a fling 

with a hot waiter/actor Smith Jarret (Jason Lewis), and it quickly becomes more serious than she ever wants a relationship to be. 
The DVD set, like all of the "Sex and the City" collections, does not have many extras. There are commentaries from producer Michael Patrick King for a few episodes, and this set also includes a discussion from the Museum of TV and Radio Seminar Series and previews for all of the episodes. 
The most unfortunate aspect of this set of DVDs was HBO's choice to divide the last season into two separate discs. There can be no good reason behind it except greed and a desire to extend the "Sex and the City" brand for as long as possible. 
It also leaves the set with something of an unfinished feeling, which I sup­pose is what they want viewers to feel so that they go out and buy the last half of the season; but it just doesn't seem like a fair thing to do to fans. "Sex and the City" Season 6 Part One is a great DVD set, marred only by the decision to divide the final season into two parts.

DVD REVIEW 

'Butterfly Effect' rises above shortcomings 
Even though Ashton Kutcher's role as the main character is a drawing point for interested viewers, the supporting roles are what drive the movie. Amy Smart, Elden Henson and Melora Walters all turn in memorable per­formances. Kutcher does suffer a little through his manipulations, but the sec­ondary characters make up for the main character's shortcomings. 
This is a good movie, but it is far from perfect. There are some obvious plot holes, and Kutcher may not have been the best young actor for the job. Another movie that follows the same idea, but with a better lead and execu­tion is "Donnie Darko," starring Jake Gyllenhaal. If you haven't seen that movie, check it out. If you have seen only one of these two movies, and liked it, I would recommend the seeing the other to see a different execution of similar story ideas. 
This is a very dark movie. If you are looking for the feel good movie of the .year, look elsewhere. Bodily and men­
tal harm come to almost every person in this movie, innocent or oth­erwise. While some may appreciate the grim nature of the movie and some of its inhabitants, others may not. 
The director's cut, included on the new DVD by New Line Cinema's Infinifilm, is even darker. Many of the things that were

Change one thing, change everything. 

That is the tagline to the semi-recent­ly released movie, "The Butterfly Effect." The butterfly effect, also known as Chaos Theory, was made widely known to the average moviegoer in the movie "Jurassic Park." As "Jurassic Park" explained, everything in the world is interconnected, and every action has the potential for many unforeseen consequences. The "butter­fly effect" stands for the idea that a butterfly flapping his wings in South Bend can create a hurricane in Florida. 
The 2003 film "The Butterfly Effect," however, one-ups "Jurassic Park" by doing more than just explaining the theory; it shows the results of one changed action through many different scenarios. While this is hardly the first movie to have followed such a princi­ple, it is one of the better ones. 


hinted at in the movie are actually dis­played in the directors cut, as well as an ending that will cause people to question what they just saw. The direc­tor's cut, as well as the theatrical one, are both packaged on the same DVD. The two versions are far enough apart, with completely different endings, that they both warrant a viewing. 
The audio and video are done quite well in this film. The video is crisp and clear. Viewers are able to see all of Ashton's dazed and confused looks with utmost clarity. All the dialogue and ambient noises have also been transcribed very clearly. 
The DVD comes packed with quite a few extras, just like previous lnfinifilm's DVD releases. There are two documentaries, one about time travel and the other dealing with chaos theory. Commentary from the directors and writers and some DVD-ROM con­tent is also included. 
Overall, this is a classy presentation for the film and one that would please any movie fan.

MOVIE REVIEW 
Foreign language film is a visual masterpiece 
By RAMA GOTTUMUKKALA Assistant Scene Editor 
At first it doesn't make sense. With no long-winded explanations or details, men and women soar into the open sky, engaged in a graceful ballet of martial arts. It's been seen before in Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." But the statue of limitations on this sort of entertainment seems to be timeless as this hybrid of art and action still feels like a breath of fresh air. While "Hero" does not capture the same heartfelt emotions as its artistic predecessor, it still succeeds -On its own as a simply beautiful, lavish piece of filmmaking. 
"Hero" tells the story of a distant war torn land when ancient China was divided into seven 
relate how he managed his single­handed victories. 
In many ways, "Hero" feels like an evolution of the same visual elements that made "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" such a wonder to behold. Watching the fight scenes is like watch­ing poetry in motion. Awash with color and lush settings, each battle seems to have been hand painted with a brush to produce breathtaking results. Two par­ticularly memorable conflicts included one set amongst a swirl of countless. red-tinted spring blossoms and another on the clear, serene surface of a remote lake. Painstakingly rehearsed and coor­dinated fight choreography just adds to the overall equation and produces moments within the film that rival, and sometimes surpass, those in "Crouching 
Tiger, Hidden

film stars. The performances in "Hero" certainly sup­port this claim. Jet Li gives a quietly reserved, tranquil performance that is unlike many of the big-budget action films that have catapulted him to fame. But the most memorable moments within the plot come from the requited love between Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung's characters. Instead of playing on the pair's passion, the actors give much more subtle performances that focus on their characters' search for a peaceful end together in a harsh, embattled world. 

The primary downfall for "Hero" is its length, or lack thereof. In order for the motivations of the characters and their ideals to really resonate, the themes of the film should have been explored for more than 90 minutes. The themes revolving around honor and a warrior's duty form the main focus for the film but there are times when these themes seem to be pushed to the rear in order in order to fast forward to another cap­tivating warrior clash. For this reason, the film does not resonate with the same raw emotion that "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" did. 

Instead, "Hero" will probably be remembered more for the beautiful images it conveys. If audience members take a step back and allow themselves to soak in all that the film's artful can­vas has to offer, they might really love the film. And that's certainly not a shabby way to be remembered in years to come.

DVD REVIEW 
Fourth time is a charm for 'The Simpsons' 
By MOLLY GRIFFIN 
Scene Critic 
All television shows manage to eek out a few good episodes. and some even manage a few great ones in their run, but the mark of a television classic is when you have an entire season of memorable shows. "The Simpsons" Season 4 is about as close as you can get to a perfect season of television. The fourth season established the show as a solid classic, and not just the fad it was thought to be when it first aired. There is not a bad episode to be found, and fortunately for fans, the DVD pack­age is worthy of such a flawless exam­ple of television programming. 
Classic episodes from the season deal with often seemingly tangential sub­jects, but they all tie up nicely at the end. "Marge vs. the Monorail" is a clas­sic written by Conan O'Brien that mocks "The Music Man" and mass transit. "Last Exit to Springfield," ranked as the best episode ever by Entertainment Weekly, finds Homer accidentally becoming a Union leader because Lisa needs braces and the nuclear power plant workers are ready to trade their dental plan for a keg. "I Love Lisa" establishes Ralph Wiggum as a character with the memorable "I Choo-choo-choose you!" valentine. "A Streetcar Named Marge" pokes fun at "A Streetcar Named Desire" with a musical version entitled "0, Streetcar!" and also manages to take shots at "The Great Escape" and Ayn Rand. "Krusty gets Kancelled" ends the season with celebrity guests including Hugh Hefner, Bette Midler, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Luke Perry and Elizabeth Taylor join­ing forces to save Krusty the Klown from cancellation. 
The DVDs are packed in a foldout container, and a helpful booklet that describes each episode as well as the special features that are included. Aside from the standard commentary tracks, the DVD set also includes some unusual extras. A segment entitled "A Cajun Controversy," detailing the brief debate that arose over a song in the episode "A Streetcar Named Marge," is included as well as another called "Bush vs. The Simpsons," which fol­lows the back-and-forth criticism that the show 

had with the then-cur­rent president. "Promotional Stuff' fea­tures "Simpsons" cre­ator Matt Groening dis­cussing the show in gen­Warner eral. Deleted scenes can be found for the episodes entitled "Homer's Triple Bypass"
llt-iit 
and "The Front," and they can be viewed sep­arately or inserted back into the episode while it is watched. Other fea­tures include animation featurettes, commercials that feature "The Simpsons," storyboards and a promo­tional syndication reel. 
One of the major benefits of watching the DVD versus syndicated episodes is the quality of the color and picture. The images are clear, the colors vivid and the sound quality is wonderful. About the only thing that isn't almost perfect in the set is the episode-selec­tion menu. Each disc has a different character on the menu, and when you select an episode, a short animation clip runs. This is fairly amusing at first, but upon subsequent viewings. it becomes somewhat tedious. 

"The Simpsons" Season 4 DVD set is a fitting package for the season that proved that the show was not just a cartoon, but a show that mixed the bite of social commentary deftly with come, dy.

MLB 
Journeytnan tninor leaguer Stnith leads Braves to w-in 
Associated Press 
About an hour before the game, Travis Smith found out he'd be starting. 
The journeyman didn't want to squander the chance. 
Filling in for the ailing Mike Hampton, Smith pitched five solid innings and earned his first major league win in more than two years, leading the Atlanta Braves past the Philadelphia Phillies 3-1 on Monday. 
"It seems like a long time," Smith said. ''I'm fortunate they gave me a shot today." 
Andruw Jones homered for the fourth time in six games and had two RBis. He also pre­vented a potential run by throwing out a runner at the plate. 
Smith (1-3). who has spent most of the season at Triple-A, got the start when Hampton couldn't go because of a stiff neck. The 31-year-old replace­ment allowed five hits and a run before giving way to the bullpen. 
It was enough for Smith's first win since July 25, 2002, when he pitched for St. Louis. 
"For him to pitch under these circumstances, really not knowing until the last minute, he gave .us a huge boost," said Braves closer John Smoltz, who got the final five outs for his 36th save. 
Smith has made four starts for the Braves this season, los­ing twice to the Phillies. Houston 11, Cincinnati 5 
The crowd was on its feet, beckoning the latest slugging surprise in the Houston Astros' vaunted offense to re-emerge from the dugout. 
Already seated and oblivious to the cheers, Brandon Backe didn't stir from his daze until his teammates nudged him back outside. 
"I was just excited thinking about the home run," said the 26-year-old pitcher, who was making only his fourth career start. "I was going to go down and sit in my little hole, but they told me to get out there." 
Backe hit his first career homer, a two-run shot, and allowed one run in seven innings to keep the Astros in the thick of the NL wild-card chase with an win over the .Cincinnati Reds on Monday ­their season-high lOth straight victory. 
Jeff Bagwell, Lance Berkman and Jeff Kent also homered for Houston, on its longest win streak in five years. The Astros have won 18 of 21 since Aug. 15, the best record in the majors during that stretch. 
The Astros closed within a game of NL wild-card leaders Chicago and San Francisco. Houston, a season-high 11 games over .500 at 74-63, has­n't been within striking range of the Cubs and Giants in more than three months. Milwaukee 9, Pittsburgh 5 
Geoff Jenkins is playing as if the Milwaukee Brewers are in a race for first place, rather than trying to exit in last place in the NL Central. 
Jenkins had another big day with three RBis, Brady Clark drove in four runs and Milwaukee used a six-run third inning to beat the Pittsburgh Pirates on Monday. 
Jenkins homered leading off the second, then followed Clark's two-run single in the pivotal third with a two-run double -his third extra-base hit against Pirates starter Ryan Vogelsong in four at-bats. San Diego 7, St. Louis 3 

Ryan Klesko singled in the go-ahead run with none out in the eighth inning and the San Diego Padres beat St. Louis Monday night to keep alive their slim playoff hopes and end the Cardinals' nine-game winning streak. 
The Padres won for just the second time in seven games, a stretch that included three losses at St. Louis last week. San Diego remained 2 1/2 games behind the Chicago Cubs in the tight wild-card race, 

with San Francisco and Houston also ahead of the Padres. 
The Cardinals, the best team in baseball, lead the Cubs by 16 1/2 games in the NL Central. 
With the score tied at 3 and the bases loaded in the eighth, Klesko hit a chopper over the head of first baseman Albert Pujols to score Ramon Vazquez. 
The Padres quickly blew it open against reliever Cal Eldred. Khalil Greene followed with a sacrifice fly, Terrence Long had a pinch-hit RBI single and another run scored on the play on a throwing error by Pujols. Chicago 9, Montreal 1 
Four days off suited Aramis Ramirez just fine. 
Ramirez hit a pair of two-run homers and Carlos Zambrano allowed four hits in eight innings to lead the Chicago Cubs to a victory over the Montreal Expos on Monday. 
Mark Grudzielanek, Derrek Lee and Michael Barrett also homered for the Cubs, who played their first game since Wednesday's 2-1 extra-inning victory at Montreal. The Cubs had their last three games against the Florida Marlins at Miami postponed because of Hurricane Frances. 
Ramirez took advantage off the long weekend to rest his sore left groin, which has been bothering him since July. 
"I feel a lot better. I'm not a 100 percent, but the four days off really helped my groin," Ramirez said. 
The Cubs took a half-game game lead over idle San Francisco in the NL wild-card race. Houston stayed 1 1/2 games back with a 11-5 win over Cincinnati. 
The Giants and the Astros moved closer in the standings, while the Cubs remained idle during the weekend. 
"It's kindl of frustrating, but we will still have to play those games, too," Ramirez said. "There is going to be a time when we are playing and they will be off and we have to take advantage of that, too." 
Chicago won without Sammy Sosa in the lineup. The seven­time All-Star has bursitis in his right hip and is listed as day to day. The injury is not related to a lower back injury Sosa suf­fered earlier in the season, which put him on the disabled list May 19 through June 18.

Yankees-Devil Rays game postponed 
Yankees ask for game to be declared aforfeit 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -The New York Yankees asked the commission­er's office to award them a for­feit over the Tampa Bay Devil Hays after they failed to arrive in time Monday because of travel problems due to Hurricane Frances. It was a request that had no chance of being granted. 

Originally scheduled as a dou­bleheader starting at 1 p.m., the start time was pushed back two hours on Sunday.· Because of the delay, the commissioner's office told the teams to play one game at 7 p.m. and said it would decide later on when to resched­ule the second game. 
The Devil Rays arrived at 6:05 p.m., and commissioner Bud Selig had no intention of order­ing a forfeit. 
"Given the stage of the season we are in, and the exciting pen­nant races, it is critical that we do everything to decide the championship on the field," he said in a statement. 
The Yankee Stadium gates opened at 11 a.m., and about 1,000 fans were on hand. They were given free hot dogs and sodas, and fans applauded loud­ly when the Yankees took bat­ting practice starting about 4:45 p.m. 
"This could keep the energy level up," Yankees manager Joe Torre said. "They're cheering batting practice." 

About 20,000 fans appeared to be on hand when Orlando Hernandez finally threw the first pitch to Julio Lugo at 7:02p.m. 
Before the game, Yankees president Randy Levine and gen­eral manager Brian Cashman held a news conference on the field, explaining why they want­ed a forfeit. Baseball rules say a forfeit may be called if a team isn't ready within five minutes of umpires calling "play" unless the delay is "unavoidable." 
"The rule states that if your team is here and ready to play, and the other team isn't here and not ready to play, there should be a forfeit, and we believe there should be a for­feit," Levine said. 
Tampa Bay's home games against Detroit on Saturday and Sunday were postponed, and the Tigers returned home after Friday night's games. Bob DuPuy, chief operating officer of the commissioner's office, said the Devil Rays were asked to investigate leaving Friday night or Saturday. 
"There were plenty of oppor­tunities to get out of Tampa on Saturday. The airports were open until 3 or 4 o'clock," Levine said after Yankees officials checked with airlines. 

COLLEGE fOOTBALL 
Frances still disrupting Florida State and Miami 
Associated Press MIAMI -Florida State and Miami were originally scheduled to play Monday. Instead, they spent the day trying to recover from Hurricane Frances. It wasn't easy, but it was nec­essary as the teams prepared for their postponed season opener Friday night at the Orange Bowl. Frances forced the fourth­ranked Seminoles to practice indoors while they mourned the loss of coach Bobby Bowden's 15-year-old grandson and for­mer son-in-law. John Allen Madden, a 45-year­old former Florida State lineman who played under Bowden, and his son, Bowden, were killed Sunday when their car was hit a by a utility truck that was help­ing restore power outages caused by Frances. "Most of us have been around all of the Bowden family a great deal, and it is a loss shared by all of us," Florida Statr athletic director Dave Hart sait: in a statement. "Words can't express the grieving I know the Bowdens are going through." The Seminoles closed practice to the media and had no player or coach availability Monday. Bowden and offensive coordina­tor Jeff Bowden attended the workout. The fifth-ranked Hurricanes practiced Monday for the first time in four days because of 
Frances. 
"Guys' minds were not on foot­ball," center Joel Rodriguez said. "Guys' minds were on their families, their houses, their property and their safety. It's understandable .... To have three days oiT where you're not even thinking about football, but about your house being blown away or whatever, it's a lot to come back from and get right into the flow." 
Several players' families and friends were still without power and water Monday. 
Miami defensive back Devin Hester, from Riviera Beach, said the roof on his parents' home collapsed, flooding every room, and a tree crushed his mother's car. 
"It didn't turn out too good," Hester said. "It's kind of bad knowing that I'm here and my mom, they're in Palm Beach struggling. I'm just trying to keep my focus and concentrate on football right now." 
Miami receiver Ryan Moore, from Orlando, said Hurricane Charley affected his family more than Frances. But having two hurricanes within three weeks left him with some troubling nights. 
''I've never seen anything back to back like that," Moore said. "All of us from Florida, we're as used to it as you can get. You've just got to go with the punches."

U.S. Open -wraps up fourth round, quarterfinals to start 

M'  
Lindsay Davenport reacts to a call in her match against Venus Williams Monday.  Davenport  
defeated Williams 7-5, 6-4 to advance to the quarterfinals.  

Associated Press 
NEW YORK Venus Williams was grunting loudly, Lindsay Davenport was mut­tering to herself, and the fans were jumping out of their seats after each point. 
The matchup was fit for a Grand Slam final, not the fourth round. So, too, was the riveting last game. 
Davenport and Williams, seven major titles ·and 49 weeks at No. 1 between them, swapped powerful strokes and anxious moments for 13 min­utes and 24 points Monday at the U.S. Open. Nine deuces. Five break points for 2000-01 Open champion Williams. Five match points for 1998 Open champ Davenport. In the end, Davenport was slightly stead­ier and stronger, pulling out a 7-5, 6-4 victory to get to the quarterfinals. 
It was a fittingly tight way to end the pair's 25th meeting; they came in 12-all. 
"A tough one to get through," said Davenport, who faces 62nd-ranked Shinobu Asagoe for a semifinal berth. "I wanted to win .so badly, and I played such a great, calm match until that point, and then let a few errors creep in." 
Not as many as Williams, who since playing her first Slam in 1997 never before went an. entire season without reaching at least one major semifinal. She hurt herself with 42 miscues, mostly off forehands and more· than dou­ble Davenport's count. 
"It was me. I made too many errors," Williams said. "The thing that hurt me the most was my inconsistency." 
That's been a problem for a while, leading to her slide to

No. 12 in the rankings _ why she was forced to play Davenport so early. Davenport, meanwhile, has won 21 straight matches since talking about retirement at Wimbledon. . 
Another big-name show­down is looming in the men's quarterfinals: Andre Agassi vs. Roger Federer. Agassi owns eight major titles, while the top-ranked Federer has won three of the past five. 
Agassi advanced Monday 
with a 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 victory 
over pal and occasional prac­
tice partner Sargis Sargsian, 
who was on court for nearly 
10 hours in his previous two 
outings. This one was so lop­·sided, it took just 90 minutes. 
Federer spent less time in 
action Monday, because his 
opponent, No. 16 Andrei 
Pavel, pulled out with a herni­
ated disc in his lower back. 
Federer is in the Open quar­
terfinals for the first time. He 
lost in the fourth round the 
last three years. 
"There's nothing more you 
ask for than to play a big 
event against the best player 
in this environment," said 
Agassi, the 1994 and 1999 
Open winner. 

"It's time to bring the best 
tennis." 

First-time Flushing Meadows 
quarterfinalists No. 5 Tim 
Henman and No. 22 Dominik 
Hrbaty will meet for another 
semifinal slot. Playing on his 
30th birthday, Henman got 
through when No. 19 Nicolas 
Kiefer quit with a right wrist 
injury while down 3-0 in the 
fifth set. Hrbaty came back to 
eliminate Olivier Rochus 2-6, 
3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-0. 
''I'm slowing up already," 
Henman said, smiling. 
Mary Pierce, a two-time major champion enjoying a bit of a renaissance at 29, lost in the fourth round to No. 9 Svetlana Kuznetsova 7-6 (5), 6-2. Kuznetsova plays No. 1 Justine Henin-Hardenne or No. 14 Nadia Petrova next. 
Asagoe upset No. 29 Eleni Daniilidou 7-6 (4), 4-6, 6-3, making her the lowest-ranked Open quarterfinalist since Williams was 66th in her 1997 debut. 
How long ago that seems. Now Williams needs to regroup and recapture the 

drive that carried her to the top ranking, four Slam titles, and six runner-up finishes. Already this year, she had ear­lier-than-usual exits at the Australian Open (third round), French Open (quarterfinals) and Wimbledon (second round). 
She missed the second half 
of last season, including the 
Open, with a torn abdominal 
muscle, and had to try to deal 
with the shooting death of 
half-sister Yetunde in 
September 2003. 
''I'm really disappointed (about) all this year's Grand Slams. But I've learned that the position that I'm in is not necessarily my fault," Williams said. "I can't be hard on myself. I have to take my time and realize that it's just a mat­ter of time before I'm playing 
my best." 
She brought her level up by 
a lot in that fantastic final 
game, with Davenport serving 
at 5-4. Williams also raised 
the volume, grunting louder 
and louder with each shot, a 
sharp contrast to Davenport's 
soft exhales.

which she opened by sailing a backhand long. 
And she broke Williams twice, for a 6-5 lead in the first set, and 3-2 in the sec­ond. 
In the final game, they went back and forth, with Williams swatting two winners to get her first break point, wasted with a forehand return long. On the first match point, a 12­stroke exchange ended with Williams striking a cross-court forehand winner. Davenport ceded her second match point by double-faulting, then turned her back to the net and chatted to herself. 
''I felt OK until I lost the sec­ond match point," Davenport said. "Then you get a little like: 'Oh, no. Don't do this."' 
There was more. including a forehand sailed long on match point No. 3, and Williams' bril­liant cross-court forehand passing winner to erase No. 4. Eventually. though, Williams succumbed, floating a fore­hand return long on No. 5. 
"Definitely had the buzz of a bigger match than a round-of­16 match. They were definite­ly into it there at the end," Davenport said, referring to the crowd. 
"I certainly don't want to have a letdown now."

NFL 
New faces, sam.e hopes for Eagles 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA -Terrell Owens and Jevon Kearse are here. Hugh Douglas and Jeremiah Trotter are back. Troy Vincent, Bobby Taylor and Duce Staley are gone. 
Despite some drastic changes, expectations remain the same for the Philadelphia Eagles: It's Super Bowl or bust -again. 
After three consecutive loss­es in the NFC championship game, the Eagles are out of excuses, especially after adding Owens and Kearse to fill their most glaring needs on offense and defense. 
The Eagles enter Sunday's season opener against the New York Giants as favorites to win their fourth straight NFC East title. But if they fall short of the Super Bowl again, the sea­son will be a failure. 
"We have the capabilities, we have the athletes, we have the coaching to win the Super Bowl," quarterback Donovan McNabb said. "All we have to do is go out and make it a reality." 
Led by McNabb and Owens, both four-time Pro Bowl selec­tions, the offense should be the Eagles' strength.. Speedy and elusive running back Brian Westbrook gives Philadelphia a balanced attack. 
But the Eagles have little depth behind Westbrook, who ran for 613 yards and totaled 13 touchdowns rushing, r~ceiving and returning punts last season. Staley went to Pittsburgh and Correll Buckhalter went down with a season-ending knee injury, leaving second-year pro Reno Mahe and rookie Thomas Tapeh as backups to the undersized and injury-prone Westbrook. 

Coach Andy Reid prefers the pass, however, using it almost 60 percent of the time. With Owens in the mix, receivers Todd Pinkston and former first-round pick Freddie Mitchell could thrive. Also. second-year tight end L.J. Smith and thrBe-time Pro Bowl tight end Chad Lewis give McNabb plenty of options. 
"The sky is the limit for this team," McNabb said. "We can do a lot of good things." 
Owens brings a lot of talent and some attitude. So far, though, the flambQyant star has fit into the offense and hasn't upset the chemistry in the locker room. He expects to raise McNabb's game to anoth­er level. 
"We're filling a void for each other," Owens said. "I think a lot of people have seen flashes of what we can do throughout the season. Obviously, it's everybody's goal here to get to the Super Bowl. Everybody keeps reflecting on the three losses in the championship game. We just have to take it one game at a time until we get to that point. I'm excited about the opportunities to get us over the hump. That's why I'm here.'' 
With five new starters, the defense might take longer to jell. But savvy defensive coor­dinator Jim Johnson has a knack for getting results from whichever players he puts on the field. 

Patriots look to Inake history this season

ASsoctated ·Press 
FOXBORO, Mass. -The New England Patriots can become only the second team to win three Super Bowls in four years. They also came very close to not winning any. 
So they'll start the NFL season knowing they can make history, but only if they make sure they take little for granted. 
The Patriots squeaked by St. Louis 20-17 in the 2002 Super Bowl on Adam Vinatieri's last­play field goal, then edged Carolina 32-29 in the 2004 title game on Vinatieri's field goal with 4 seconds left. Not exactly a rout in either game. 
"Once you get to the playoffs, every team that makes it to that level is a good team," Vinatieri said. "One or two plays a game makes a difference between winning and losing a game a lot of times." 
Coach Bill Belichick keeps his players focused on the next play. But if they open the season 4-0, they would break Miami's record with 19 consecutive wins, counting regular-season and playoff games. They could do that with a win over the Dolphins on Oct. 10. 
"It could make us 1-3, too," Belichick said. 
The Patriots were 2-2 last season before starting the streak that gives them a chance to join Dallas, which won the 1993, 1994 and 1996 Super Bowls, as the only teams to take three out of four. 
"Would I love to be in the his­tory books as being one of the best teams iri a snort era? Of course," defensive end Richard Seymour said. "I think we have the ability to do that, but it's not going to come easy. We still have to put in the work day by day." 
The Patriots know opponents will be extra eager to beat the champs, starting with Indianapolis in Thursday night's opener. They beat the Colts 24­14 in last sea~on's AFC champi­onship game. 
But they also have three top players who didn't contribute to last season's title run: running back Corey Dillon, punter Josh Miller and linebacker Rosevelt Colvin. 
"I've been playing this game for a long time, so I'm approaching like I approach every other game and that's just go out there and do whatever it takes to help the team win," said Dillon, who gained at least 1,100 yards in each of his first six seasons with Cincinnati before dropping to 541 last year. 
Miller, a free agent from Pittsburgh, is an upgrade over Ken Walter. while Colvin, a top pass rusher, didn't play after breaking his hip in the second game last season. 
'Tm physically prepared and able to do whatever they need me to do, Colvin said. 
He'll start the season as a backup on a team that has back 18 of its 22 offensive and defen­sive starters from the Super Bowl. New England doesn't have a particularly difficult schedule, with only seven games against teams that fin­ished above .500. 
With a dangerous back like Dillon, two-time Super Bowl MVP Tom Brady shouldn't have as much pressure to pass the Patriots toward the end zone. even though he has a deep corps of wide receivers. 
And he isn't caught up in the jinx of being on the cover of the current issue of Sports Illustrated. 
"It was kind of asurprise," he said. "It was kind of cool. I'm not too worried about any jinx­es or anything, knock on wood. That is another one of those extra things that you can get distracted by." 
The Patriots play in what could be a weaker AFC East with Buffalo, Miami and the New York Jets, and are deep at every positi<?n except one ­quarterback. 
If Brady gets hurt, they have only Rohan Davey and Jim Miller. Davey was offensive MVP in NFL Europe, but was incon­sistent in the Patriots' exhibi­tion season. ~iller, a 10-year veteran who missed last season because of a shoulder injury and had surgery on his right shoulder in February, didn't play in any exhibition games. 
The Patriots lost two solid defensive linemen, end Bobby Hamilton and. .nose tackle Ted Washingt()f1;· who both signe'd with Oakland. But Ty Warren, the 13th pick in last year's draft, had an outstanding off­season as Hamilton's replace­ment, and Keith Traylor and rookie Vince Wilfork give the Patriots depth in Washington's spot. 
The team's rankings last sea­son weren't anything special: 17th in the league in offense and seventh in defense. Seven of its wins were by seven points or less. And it needed a field goal by Vinatieri in the fourth quarter to win the divisional playoff game against Tennessee 17-14 before beating Indianapolis and Carolina.

NORTON, Mass. -Vijay Singh won a head-to-head matchup with Tiger Woods to end his record reign atop golfs ultimate leader­board. 
Singh shot a 69 to beat Woods and Adam Scott by three strokes in the Deutsche Bank Championship on Monday, clinching the No. 1 ranking in the world with his sixth victory of the year. Woods had been first for more than five years -a record 264 consecutive weeks. 
Singh took a three-stroke lead into ·the final round, but he and Woods were tied at 13 under after Singh bogeyed No. 13 at the par-71, 7,415-yard TPC of Boston. Woods bogeyed the next hole and Singh birdied 15 to pull ahead by two strokes before adding birdies on the final two holes to finish 16 under and win the $900,000 first prize. 
"It feels great," said Singh, who has won the last eight times he took a lead into the final round. "I can't wait to celebrate." 
Scott, the defending champion. started the day seven strokes behind Singh before making the turn with four consecutive birdies to get into con­tention. He birdied the 18th hole to finish 13 under, and Woods matched him; John Ro11ins and Daniel Chopra were anoth­er two strokes back at 
minus 10. 
Singh is the top winner on the tour this year with six victories. including the PGA Championship, and $7.889,566 in earnings. He needed only to finish ahead of Woods to take over 'the No. 1 ranking that he has been closing in on all year. 
The computer rankings factor in performance over the past two years, taking the strength of field into account; Woods held a 12.09-11.91 lead heading into this week. The new numbers were expected to · be released later Monday, but Singh's will be the ·first player other than Woods to hold the No. 1 ranking since Aug. 8, 1999. 
"That's not too bad, is it?" Woods asked·. "I've had a good run." 
Singh improved to 15 under with a birdie on the first hole; Woods left a 15­footer on the rim of the cup. 
On the· second hole, a par-5, 553-yard dogleg right, both players got into trouble. Singh couldn't find his ball and tQok a drop, hit to 14 feet of the pin and then two-putted for bogey; Woods found his among the rocks in front of the green, but when he swung at the ball he hit a rock instead, jamming his wrist, breaking his club and cost­ing himself a stroke. 

IN BRIEF Colts interested in adding
quarterback Couch 
INDIANAPOLIS -The Indianapolis Colts were still fine-tuning their ros­ter Monday, and one option is quar­terback Tim Couch. 
After announcing 12 player cuts Monday, one day after the NFL dead­line to trim rosters to 53, coach Tony Dungy acknowledged the Colts were interested in Couch, the No. 1 pick in 1999 who was cut Sunday by Green Bay. 
''I'm sure we'll take a look at Tim Couch," Dungy said. "He played in a similar system to what we have when he was in Cleveland. He was the first pick in the draft. He played well both times we played against him, and I think it's something we'll talk about." 
Dungy's comments came on the same day that the Colts made a sur­prise move by waiving guard Steve Sciullo, who started 13 games last season, so they could claim Ryan Lilja off waivers from Kansas City. 
Lilja, a 6-2, 285-pound guard, started 14 of 23 games in two sea­sons with Kansas City, which cut him Sunday.Giants' Shockey ready to 
start season 
EAST RUTHERFORD. N.J.-After sitting out training camp and all four preseason games with an injured foot and a hamstring prob­lem, New York Giants Pro Bowl tight end Jeremy Shockey declared him­self fit Monday. 
Shockey said he could have played in the Giants' final preseason game against Baltimore, but decided to rest until the season opener against NFC East rival Philadelphia on Sunday. He vowed to start. 
"I never doubted that I would be back," Shockey said Monday before an unscheduled light workout. 
"I feel pretty good right now, and I've felt better each day. I really could have played last week, but they didn't want me to try and I couldn't persuade them. I'm ready to get it going. It's an important game for us, and we have to start off on the right track." Davenport defeats Williams

NEW YORK -Venus Williams was grunting loudly, Lindsay Davenport was muttering to herself, and the fans were jumping out of their seats after each point.

Although Zbikowski did not play as a reserve safety in 2003, he performed well dur­ing the 2004 Blue-Gold game, picking off a pass and was named the Defensive Player of the Game. 
He went into the summer expecting to compete with Burrell for the starting free safety spot. When an injury sidelined Burrell for most of the practice season, Zbikowski began receiving the majority of repetitions. 
Zbikowski caused some controversy and speculation when he did not show up for two-a-day workouts on Aug. 20-21, citing non-football­related personal issues. Rumors swirled that Zbikowski was planning to transfer, but the sophomore put an end to that speculation when he returned to practice Aug. 22.

However, the team's much­improved goals against average of 1.4 in 2003 bodes well for this year's Saint Mary's back­field. 
The defense will be an impor­tant aspect under the game plan of new head coach Peter Haring, who will look to improve upon the success of last year's team. 
Haring hopes the defense can provide consistently strong play, which will allow the mid­fielders including Concannon, who along with Wendy Irvin scored 50 percent of the team's goals last year ­to play with possession and fire more open runs into the attack. 
He also hopes to get contribu­tions on offense this year from midfielders Carrie Orr and Emily Wagoner.

Valparaiso will present plenty of challenges to both the Irish offense and defense. 
The Crusaders are off to a good start this year after receiving a bid to the NCAA Tournament last year. Last weekend, the team defeated Southeast Missouri State, Albany and Ball State in three games each. 
What makes Valparaiso's team so successful, Stasiuk

the Irish believe they have identified their opponent's weaknesses and have adjusted their game plan accordingly. 
"Our hitters will really have to work their shots and vary them," Stasiuk said. "It will be really important to keep a high level of intensity and be aggressive." 
The Irish will take the court to face Valparaiso at 7

Getting a chance 
Zbikowski starts at strong safety against BYU 
ByJUSTIN SCHUVER 
Associate Sports Editor 
When Tom Zbikowski rushed onto the field with the rest of the starters during the first quarter of Notre Dame's 20-17 loss to BYU Saturday, it was a surprise to nearly everyone, except Zbikowski. 
"They told me earlier in the week to get ready, and we started going over some plays and by Thursday I was getting

--all the .reps in practice," Zbikowski said. Zbikowski, who was recruit­ed in 2003 as a quarterback out of Buffalo Grove (Ill.) High School and switched to defen­sive back upon his arrival with the Irish, was believed to be in competition with senior Quentin Burrell for the start­ing spot at free safety this sea­son. Burrell started at free safety in the Brigham Young game, but Zbikowski still saw the field as the starter at strong safety. Zbikowski played well, fin­ishing the game with five tack­les. Stepping on the field as a Notre Dame starter was the end of a long journey for Zbikowski, who threw for 

downs and rushed for 1,287 yards and 23 touchdowns his senior year as Buffalo Grove's starting quarterback. 
He was named the Chicago area player of the year as a senior by the Chicago Sun­Times, and named the Gatorade Player of the Year for the state of Illinois. 
However, Zbikowski's awards weren't just limited to local accolades. He was named 29th on an ESPN list of the 100 top recruits nationally in 2003, and named a USA Today first-team AU­American. 
The national spotlight also focused on Zbikowski as he documented his recruiting experience in a daily diary he wrote for ESPN.com. In the end, Zbikowski selected Notre Dame over Nebraska and Iowa, primarily because the Irish were willing to let Zbikowski change positions from quarterback to defense. 
As an avid boxer. Zbikowski was also allured by a unique facility on the campus. 
"But nothing was more impressive than the boxing gym under coach Willingham's office," Zbikowski wrote in his Dec. 19, 2002 article for Blue Chip Diaries -the series he

The Belles have certainly gained a lot of confidence since their impressive eighth-place finish at the Division-III NCAA championships last season. But the team will not be satisfied until it achieves its ultimate goal. 
"The coach from DePauw told us that we should have one goal for the season," Stefanic Simmerman said. "To win the national title." 
With seasoned veterans and an impressive opening week­end, Saint Mary's team has been making a name for them­selves. 
Last weekend, the Belles began their run at the national title by competing in the Ferris State Bulldog Invitational. Saint Mary's finished fourth with team score of 636, 41 shots behind Invitational champion Ferris State, who shot 595. 
The Belles had three mem­bers finish in the top-20. Chrissy Dunham finished eighth with a 1 0-over par 154 and reigning NCAA individual
