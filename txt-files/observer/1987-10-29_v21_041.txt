SMC endowment not affected by recent stock market plunge 
By KATIE KEARNEY 
Assistant Saint Mary's Editor 
Last week's stock market decline probably caused an in­crease in the Saint Mary's en­dowment fund because it is heavily weighted in debt securities, according to Jason Lindower, Saint Mary's con­troller and business manager. 
"We've got about 64 percent of our endowment fund in fixed­income securities which have gone the opposite way of the stock market," Lindower said. "Of the 34 percent of the en­dowment fund invested in com­mon stocks, one of our advisors had 14 percent of the portfolio in cash." 
Regarding the equity portion of the portfolio, Lindower said, "We're really not feeling any short-term effects of the downturn, other than we don't feel as well off as three weeks ago. 
"We're not planning on changing any policies at the present time," he added. 
In the long run, however, he said the market crash may af­fect the Saint Mary's stock portfolio. 
"In the future, a larger percentage of the endowment fund probably will be placed in common stocks," Lindower said. 
He said he believes if the stock market remains de­pressed, the Saint Mary's en­dowment fund could suffer. However, he said he believes the market would have to stay down for at least two years before creating a great impact on the Saint Mary's fund. 
Because of the affluent na­ture of the individuals and cor­porations who contribute to the endowment fund, Lindower said he believes the decline will not adversely affect future fund donations. 



Summit details still unclear 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Ronald Reagan on Wednesday renewed his offer to host the next superpower summit meeting in the United States, but administration officials said Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev might prefer an­other site. 
Gorbachev's reservations surfaced as the White House and the Kremlin announced that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze would fly to Washington for talks Friday with Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz. 
He was expected to deliver a message from Gorbachev to Reagan, who said in speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., that "it would be good for Mr. Gorbac­hev to see this country for him­self." 
But two U.S. officials, de­manding anonymity, told The Associated Press separately that the Soviet leader was reluctant to have the summit held in the United States. 
"He is concerned about being upstaged by the president on his own turf," one of the offi­cials said. "They also have said they are worried about secur­ity." 
The official said the Soviets had hinted that Dublin, Ireland, might be a suitable summit site. "But," he added, "I wouldn't be surprised ifthey agreed to meet here." 
The second official said Gor­bachev felt uncomfortable about having the summit in Washington, and that was one of the reasons for his hesitation in setting a date for his third meeting with Reagan. 
But another U.S. official said, "Gorbachev, himself, in discussing the summit last week with Shultz in Moscow 
talked  only  about  Washing­ 
ton."

Honor code to debut in spring 
By KENDRA LEE MOR­RILL 
Copy Editor 
Certain courses will be des­ignated as honor code courses in the preliminary course schedule booklets for the 1988 spring semester. These book­lets will be available after Oc­tober 30. 
Beginning in January of 1988, sixty percent of freshman courses and some upperclass courses will be conducted un­der the University's new honor code. 
Freshman entering Notre Dame for the 1987-1988 aca­demic year came to the Uni­versity with the understanding that they would be required to abide by the honor code, accor­ding to Associate Provost Fa­ther Oliver Williams. Each suc­cessive freshman class will be told they will be required to fol­low the honor code, Williams said. In this manner the honor code will be phased in over four years. 
To prepare the freshman for the honor code courses, two videotapes will be shown to them in their dorms, said Wil­liams. One tape will be on the notion of honor. The second tape will explain why the aca­demic council decided to imple­ment an honor code and will outline the procedures of the code. This will give all fresh-
ND grad Storin focuses on press, privacy conflict 
By LINDA BAILY 
News Staff 
Matthew Storin, former editor of the Chicago Sun­Times, said ''every story must be evaluated sepa­rately" when considering its impact on individuals' privacy during a lecture last 
night  in  the  library  
auditorium.  
Storin,  a  Notre Dame  

graduate, spoke about "The Press and Privacy: A Con­flict of Interest?" 
Storin pointed out that the press must open themselves up to a greater awareness of how the news is affecting the people it is written about. He stated that many reporters spend more time worrying about how they will obtain the information rather than what impact it will have upon the individuals they are reporting on. 
Regarding the victims who die from AIDS, Storin said people feel differently man a chance to hear the code explained, said Williams. 
The specific freshman courses designated as honor code courses will be listed and explained in a newsletter that will be sent out in a week or so, said Dr. Emil Hofman, dean of the Freshman Year of Studies. 
The list should be "rather lengthy," said Hofman. "We're choosing a large number of courses to give (the freshman) the widest possible experience of the honor code, and to give (the code) the best possible chance," he said. 
In addition to the freshman honor code courses, certain up­perclass courses will also be conducted under the honor code. These courses will be des­ignated as honor code courses in the preliminary course schedule booklet, and only those upperclass students will­ing to abide by the code should enroll in these courses, said Williams. 
The instructor of each course chose to teach his class under the honor code, and then received approval of the dean of the appropriate The number of courses is small, according to Williams, because the deans "didn't want to close anyone out" of taking a class because it was an honor code class.

school here. I admit it. Thousands can confirm it. 
From administration policy and the fairness of tests to long lunch lines and the cost of Double Huddleburgers with cheese, there isn't much around here that escapes my wrath. But I am not alone. 
An ungodly proportion of my total amount of conversation with other students each day is devoted to our slamming some facet of Notre Dame -the school we love to hate. 
You'd never guess that 92 percent of students who enter Notre Dame as freshmen stay here for all four years (98 percent before the Alcohol Policy). The amount of negative response that I hear leveled at just about every aspect of university life would seem to indicate an im­pending exodus from this barren abyss of lim­ited freedoms and even more limited promis­cuity. But it never happens. Why? 
Every year the story is the same: The lines are too long everywhere. The food's rotten. We should all be able to drink outside our rooms. Everyone's too competitive. Cops shouldn't bust us at bars or at off-campus parties. It's too hard to get grades. Sex should be legal. The girls are ugly anyway. Too many foreign TA's. Dillon sucks. Digger can't coach. The weather is ridiculous. The rooms are too small. Weekend fun is restrained at best. Bookstore prices are outrageous. The girls are ugly. That silly Proposition 48 thing kept Tony Rice out a year. A federal investigation is launched every time you try to drive on campus. No day off on na­tional holidays. Crunchberries in the dining hall only on select days. The beat goes on and on. But why? 
Let's count our blessings, shall we? Sure, we're ambitious and want to see every shortcoming of life at Notre Dame rectified in­stantly and to our specifications. But complain­ing has become the campus pastime, and it's not too fair, considering that Notre Dame serves a lot of pretty darn useful purposes. Not the least of these is as an airtight, four-year bubble shielding us from the real world. While we're being protected from going out on our own, we're increasing our potential for making megabucks. 
Only 40 percent of people in our age group (18-22) are in any college right now, and only half of that 40 percent will graduate. And a lot of that final 20 percent go to Podunk U. or an­other state school equivalent. So, when we get out, it's safe to say that we'll be pretty highly coveted by the powers-that-be in the American work force. Don't let that Don your government midterm wash away your dream of a starting 



salary in excess of $35,000. 
Many people on campus get their laundry done for a nominal fee by the University, the University Food Services have won national awards in two of the last three years. And if . you enter them with an open mind, 99 percent of the situations you encounter at Notre Dame 
can be made tolerable. 
Really, this school is Fantasyland compared 
to other situations you could be in. We've got 
a golf course in our backyard, a national sports 
reputation unlike almost any other, and as 
beautiful and scenic a campus as there is. And, 
when you think about it, the Alcohol Policy isn't 
that bad when you consider that the drinking 
age almost everywhere in the country 
(including Indiana) is 21. 
I guess complaining is just a natural tendency 
for aggressive, informed, cream-of-the-crop 
folks like us, but when it comes right down to 
it, Notre Dame offers quite a few more oppor­
tunities than headaches.

Kathleen Hessert described her first few months after graduating from Saint Mary's as "miserable. I thought that my life had peaked at Saint Mary's at age 22. Eventually I . realized that it was time for me to take my own talents and what Saint Mary's had taught me out into the real world." 
And that is exactly what the 1974 graduate did. Hessert, president of Communications Concepts in Charlotte, N.C., elaborated on her college years and her career in a speech last night at Haggar College Cen­ter.

"The thing that pleases the College most is that (the recognition) comes from peers of comparable institutions," said Brett McLaughlin, who handles public relations for Saint Mary's.

Hessert's speech was the first of the "Life After Saint Mary's" series sponsored by the student government and Saint Mary's Alumnae Rela­tions. 
While taking a full course lmid her senior year, Hessert worked thirty hours per week for the local WJVAIWRVR radio station. She moved to Syracuse, N.Y., following com­mencement and started as a general assignment reporter for CBS. She remained in tele­vision broadcasting for the next ten years, her career cul­minating in the hosting of her own talk show. 
After moving to South Carolina and taking time out of her career to have two children, Hessert decided that it was time to put her commu­nications skills to work in a pro­fessional business. 

"Communication is a compe­tition," she said. "Words are not the only thing involved, ap­pearance and actions count, too. The challenge is to make our good ideas matter to others.

Storin also referred to an in­cident involving a Saint Mary's student whose name was pub­lished by the South Bend Tribune after her stillborn baby was found in the trash. 
Storin said he was surprised that the authorities released the girl's name when no charges had been proven. He said he felt the minor's name should not have been used, par­ticularly because she had not been convicted of any crime. Storin said there probably was not enough discussion about whether to print her name. 
Reporters must keep practi­cal points in mind when dealing with the topic of restraint in matters of privacy, Storin said. 

One of the practical consid­erations an editor must make is how the public will react to a revelation, he said. People may resent the press for uncalled-for lack of restraint, and may be alienated by the press. He cited the Gary Hart case as reported by the Miami Herald as an example and said the Hart case shows the pain the press can inflict. Another factor a reporter must consider is whether the actions of a per­son will have any bearing on his future role in society. A guideline used when dealing with political candidates is whether they have consistent patterns of particular kinds of weaknesses, such as infidelity or emotional instability, that may affect their political per­formances. "Whether or not a person is a leading candidate is also taken into considera­tion," he said. 
Storin said that reporters do the same thing for mundane topics as they do for the big news -search for the truth. But he said there "must be some overriding reason to allow reporters to delve into the private lives of individuals."

U.S. airmen killed in Philippines 
Associated Press 
ANGELES CITY, Philip­pines -Suspected communist rebels shot and killed two U.S. airmen and two other people Wednesday in separate daylight attacks near the giant 
U.S. 
Clark Air Base. 

U.S. 
officials said the dead included two Air Force ser­geants, a Filipino retired from the U.S. Air Force and a Filipino businessman of U.S. ancestry. Assassins also fired on an Air Force captain. 


The attacks came within 15 minutes of each other and fol­lowed by several hours the slayings of two policemen and the wounding of an army colonel in Manila. Authorities also blamed those on the rebels. 
Names of the victims were not immediately available. Base spokesman Maj. Thomas Boyd said both airmen were in uniform. 
Maj. Gen. Donald Snyder, commander of the 13th Air Force, said the motive for the killings were unknown. But Col. Manuel Caranza, security officer of the Philippine mili­tary's Clark Air Base Com­mand, said he suspected com­munist rebels were responsible. 
He said the style of the at­tacks and the weapons used ­.45-caliber pistols -pointed to rebel assassination teams known as "sparrow units" for the swiftness of their assaults. 
Francisco Nepomuceno, mayor of Angeles City, also said he suspected communist assassination squads because of recent U.S. arms shipments and statements of support for President Corazon Aquino's government. 
A statement. by the Philip­pine military said the first at­tack came at about 3:45 p.m. when three assailants shot dead an Air Force sergeant in front of a McDonald's less than two miles from the base. 
Moments later, up to 15 gun­men ambushed the car of an­other Air Force sergeant, kil­ling him instantly. The Filipino businessman, who stopped to investigate, was also slain. 
The retired Air Force ser­geant was shot dead as he drove his station wagon near a military housing area, the statement said. 
The Air Force captain was attacked near another housing area at about the same time, the statement added. When the captain returned fire, the rebels fled. 
At the Pentagon, officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the attacks "were obviously coordinated." 
Threats, raids continue in Gulf 
Associated Press 
KUWAIT-Iraq said Wednes­day its warplanes raided three tankers off Iran and industrial targets on the mainland. Iran threatened to answer any West­ern economic embargo by sealing off the Persian Gulf. 
Iran also said three of its warplanes approached Ameri­can warships south of the gulf in defiance of U.S. Navy warn­ings. 
The 13th convoy of Navy ves­sels and reflagged Kuwaiti tankers arrived safely at the sheikdom, which has been hit by three Iranian missiles this month. 
Shipping sources in the gulf said they could not confirm the attacks on tankers reported by Iraq. The Iranians indirectly confirmed bombing sorties on the mainland by saying 18 people were killed and 70 wounded in Iraqi air raids on civilian areas.

only one section asked to con­duct his class under the honor code, the dean refused permis­sion. The courses which will be honor code courses are ones with a number of different sec­tions to allow students to have a choice between taking an honor code or a non-honor-code class. 
Any other course can be taught under the honor code if the students in the class vote unanimously to take the class under the terms of the code. If any decide they do not wish to take the class as an honor code class, the course must be con­ducted following the normal su­pervision procedures. 
The Academic Council of the University passed the resolu­tion implementing the new honor system on April28, 1987. This four-year experimental program will begin in January of 1988 and end in January of 1992. 
The proposed honor code con­tains: j a pledge signed by each student indicating willingness to abide by the code and a pledge signed by each student when submitting work indica­ting that the student has nei­ther given nor received unaut­horized aid j a requirement that civilians, as they have before in the 7-year-old war, to evacuate areas near industrial and economic installations. 
Marine executives reported a fire at Saudi Arabia's Safaniyeh field near Kuwait, the world's largest offshore oil operation. They said one drill­ing platform burned for hours and there might have been one casualty. 
The fire may have been ac­cidental, the sources said, but Saudi authorities were inves­tigating. Arabian American Oil Co., commonly known as Aramco, operates the field. 
President Ali Khamenei renewed the oft-expressed Iranian threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow gulf gateway whose shores belong to Iran and Oman. 
Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, said Khamenei's remarks were prompted by an embargo President Reagan imposed this week on nearly all trade between the United States and Iran.

"The Strait of Hormuz is a waterway for shipping and for the Persian Gulf countries," he said. "The day we feel no ship is coming to us through that waterway we will not allow any ship to enter the Persian Gulf. 
"We have been threatened by an economic blockade by the Western states. We are not afraid of such things. We have an appropriate reply to any measure." 
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said the Iranian warplanes challenged Navy ships last Friday in the Gulf of Oman, south of Hormuz. 
It said the pilots "ignored warnings and a threat of at­tack" transmitted by radio at distances of 20, 22 and 27 miles and replied that they would fly "within the range prescribed" by their command. 
IRNA said they approached to within 10 miles of the ships and returned to their bases without incident.

Cats wake family during fire 
Associated Press 
CHARLESTOWN, Ind. -A pair of cats named Maddie and Kitty are receiving credit for rescuing a Charleston woman and her two children from a nighttime fire in their home. 
Angie Webster, 24, and children Ashleigh, 5, and Jef­frey, 3, fled through a bedroom window and escaped from the smoke billowing through the brick, ranch-style home early Tuesday after the cats began pouncing on them and making strange sounds, Webster said. 
"The cats were up on the bed and making weird noises, not a meow, maybe a grunting noise," Webster said Wednes­day. 
Danny Grace of the Charles­town Volunteer Fire Depart­ment said ashes from a fireplace in the living room ig­nited a bucket of pine cones, and the flames spread to papers, blankets and pillows.

The home is equipped with a smoke detector, but Webster said she had disconnected it over the summer after burning some food in the kitchen and had forgotten to reconnect it. 
Webster said her husband, Jeff, 27, was at work, so the children were sleeping with her when the fire broke out about 2 a.m. 
The cats -Maddie, which is almost 2 years old, and her 1­year-old kitten, Kitty -came into the bedroom and jumped on the bed, Webster said. 
"The older one was up and walking up and down me, pacing almost. They were both very excited and agitated," she said. 
"They finally woke me and I became aware of what was going on," she added. "My eyes were stinging from the smoke. I looked down the hall and all I could see was smoke."

S. Korean diplomat released in Lebanon 
Associated Press 
BEIRUT, Lebanon-Kidnap­pers released a South Korean diplomat for a $1 million ran­som after holding him for 21 months, the leader of the main­stream Shiite Moslem militia said Wednesday. 
Do Chae-Sung was released Tuesday, and "not less than one million dollars have been paid," Nabih Berri, leader of the Shiite Amal militia, told reporters at his residence in Moslem West Beirut. 
"Amal did her job to protect him after his release into a safe voyage," Berri said in English. He did not disclose further details. 
No information was immedi­ately available about who pur­portedly provided the money and who was paid. 
Do, 45, the second secretary at the South Korean embassy in Beirut, was kidnapped in the city's Moslem western sector on Jan. 31, 1986. A group calling itself Revolutionary Cells claimed his abduction, but has made no public demands. 
A Lebanese employee at the South Korean embassy also said the diplomatic mission does not have information about Do being released. 
Do's release leaves 22 foreig­ners, including eight Americans, held hostage after kidnappings in Lebanon. Most are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groups. 
In addition, Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite has been missing since last January, when he disappeared during a mission to mediate with Is­lamic Jihad, which holds some of the hostages. No group has claimed kidnapping him. 
Berri's militia has been en­
gaged in efforts to free some 
foreign hostages, including an 
American and two Saudi 
Arabians. 
In June 1985, the pro-Syrian 
militia also negotiated with 
Shiite hijackers of the Ameri­
can TWA airliner in Beirut for 
freedom of the passengers. 
There have been several kid­
nappings for ransom of 
Lebanese in West Beirut in 
recent months. Press reports in 
Germany say that the Siemens 
electronic company paid a ran­
som for the release in Septem­
ber of an engineer held hostage 
in Lebanon. Siemens, of West 
Germany, denied the reports. 
Do:s reported released came 
one day after kidnapped Amer­
ican journalist Terry Ander­
son, the longest-held foreign 
hostage, turned 40 in captivity. 
Anderson, chief Middle East 
Correspondent of The Associ­
ated Press, was kidnapped in 
West Beirut March 16, 1985. 
One day later, the pro-Iranian 
Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy 
War, claimed his abduction. 

Brokerage gunman a former witness 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -The man who shot two stockbrokers and himself had testified against organized crime figures in a stock manipulation case before en­tering the federal witness protection program, officials said Wednesday. 
Arthur Kane, 53, killed the manager of a Merrill Lynch brokerage office Monday, seriously wounded his broker and then turned the gun on him­self. The longtime dabbler in the stock market had lost an estimated $10 million to $15 mil­lion when the market dropped in the last two weeks. 
The U.S. Justice Department said Kane was actually Arthur Katz, a disbarred Kansas City, Mo., attorney relocated to Miami in 1979 after testifying for federal authorities. 
Along with cooperating in a Kansas insurance fraud case in which he pleaded guilty in 1978, Kane testified in a 1977 organ­ized crime investigation in Philadelphia by the U.S. secur­ities and Exchange Commission, said Thomas Monahan, the agency's Philadelphia assistant regional administrator. 
"It was the first criminal case the SEC ever had involv­ing organized crime," Monahan said Wednesday. 
Kane was one of several people across the country who had acted as front men for a ring of outside investors that tried to manipulate stock in the Magic Marker Corp. of Philadelphia, said Monahan. Later convicted in the scheme was Harry Blumenfeld of Miami Beach, identified by the Philadelphia Organized Crime Strike Force as a close associ­ate of reputed crime figure Meyer Lansky. 
"They were using (Kane's) name to hide the principals," said Monahan. "His account was used for transactions." The ring bought 18 percent of the Magic Marker shares, then tried to boost its price by bribing market writers and others. 
Monahan said he believed Kane was introduced to the scheme through another man more closely related to the ring. 
Kane's testimony, although not crucial, helped lead to the convictions of 20 people.

USC band director displays lack of class 
Mter this weekend's USC game, a new definition of the word "classless" entered the dictionaries of all Domers. 
It reads: USC's band director. 
Eric M. Bergamo 
20 seconds into the future 
This individual hit a new high in low disregard for Notre Dame. Consider his . offenses. 
Exhibit one. This so-called "direc­tor" forced his charges to play that fight song of theirs over and over and over again. (I swear I heard it in my sleep that night, forcing me to wake up screaming "Enough, enough, go USC! Just stop playing that song!) Even after repeated crowd reactions to this end­less rendition, the band director contin­ued to make his band play their beloved fight song. Notice that the classy Notre Dame band does not play the fight song after every first down, unlike the USC band that plays it after their quarter­back is sacked. 
Don't you think that this band direc­tor was playing the song at the end of the game just to get us Domers angry? 
Exhibit two. USC's halftime show, which was very good, but was spoiled when Mr. USC Band Director decided to run after our gutsy leprechaun, Brian Stark, because he was making the halftime show a little more "in­teresting" for us. Now Mr. USC Band Director, did you think that we, consci­entious Notre Dame students, would be the least impressed by the psuedo­leprechaun of yours? No way, Jose. Maybe you could have asked our leprechaun, who is much better than your weak imposter, to be in your show. 
Boy, I think you would have gotten a lot more applause than you did. 
But the best offense is yet to come. 
Exhibit three. As the Notre Dame band was on the field, preparing to play "Notre Dame, Our Mother," Mr. USC Band Director thought it was just the right time to swing into the post-game show. I was quite surprised that a ram­paging group of Notre Dame students didn't tear across the field and stuff this idiot of a band director headfirst into a tuba. He surely deserved that kind of a fate. 
But, despite this glaring insult, the Notre Dame band lowered their instru­ments and did not play until the low­brow USC band stopped. Truly a class act, something Mr. USC Band Director should learn from. 
From the reaction of the students, I feel they wouldn't cry over the possi­bility that the USC band might never again travel to the friendly confines of Notre Dame Stadium. 
But more telling was the reaction of some band members. They were genuinely upset and insulted at the ac­tions of Mr. USC Band Director and they would also be glad to see the USC band go and never return. 
I don't feel that it has to come to that, but the director of the USC band should get a new attitude and take a few les­sons from their classy hosts.

Grace Hall debates: an intellectual forum 
Last year marked the inception of the Grace Hall Debates, an event to be con­ducted annually by its home dormitory. Great success for the competition a year ago was markedly proven, evidenced by both the debators' skills 
Chris Leopold 
guest column 
and the audiences' enthusiasm. Thanks to then Assistant Rector of Grace, now turned Rector of Sorin Hall, Joe McKen­na, for his laying the solid foundation for the competition, Grace Hall is en­thusiastically preparing to host the debates again, beginning October 29 and running through November. 
For those who may be unfamiliar to the debates, the teams of debators are representatives from each section in Grace, which boasts twenty sections in total. Single elimination will ultimately lead to the two top teams competing for the championship. For each debate, a controversial topic will be assigned by the debating committee, with the teams arguing either the affirmative or negative side. The debates last year were far from two sides passively stating obvious points. Heated battles often ensued, and the true art of debate clearly was evinced. Aside from ser­ving as pure entertainment for the crowd, dozens of interesting as well as important facts emerged throughout the debates. Often these points helped question or even change the viewers' own personal stand on issues. Some of

24-hour charity run needs your support 
Dear Editor: 
Once again it is time for the annual Grace Hall 24-hour run. This run is the largest of Grace Hall's many charitable fundraisers, the proceeds of which will benefit the Northeast Community Ser­vice Center in South Bend. The 24 hours are subdivided into smaller time inter­vals, all of which are run by Grace Hall residents. This year the run will com­mence on Friday, October 30, at 11:00 
Doonesbury 
a.m. with an appearance by guest run­ner Monk Malloy. 
Throughout the past, there has ex­isted some animosity between the South Bend community and the Notre Dame student body. By donating the proceeds of the run to the Northeast Community Service Center, Grace Hall hopes to im­prove relations between the two com­munities. Donations will be accepted throughout the run and the support of the Notre Dame student body would be appreciated.

Boss searches for light 
at end of ''Tunnel'' 
MATT SITZER accent assistant editor 
F 
or the last 15 years, the popularity of Bruce Springsteen has been largely due to his image as a voice for the masses. Whether this voice was reflected in the adolescent rebelliousness of 1975's Born to Run or the early-Reagan years pessimism of Nebraska, Springsteen's albums have all gone on to reach anthem-like status with the American blue collar. 

With his latest album, Tunnel of Love, Springsteen continues In this same tradition, except this time something seems to be missing. Absent from many of the songs on the album Is that cruical element which had made his earlier working class hymns so palpable--hope. 
Gone also, are many of the stirring rock and roll chartbusters which attracted Springsteen so many new "psuedo fans" following the release of I984's Born In the 
U.S.A. and his subsequent world tour. 
If these people are expecting a comparable follow-up album, 
Calvin and Hobbes 
Bruce Springsteen Tunnel of Love 
they will certainly be sorely dis­
appointed. Listening to Tunnel 
of Love does not leave one In a 
particularly festive mood. Yet, 
this may not be entirely bad. 
The album opens rather un­
pretentiously with the bluesy. 
Introspective "Ain't Got You," 
which features an unaccom­
panied Springsteen possibly 
reflecting upon his rise to su­
perstardom ("When I walk 
down the street people stop 
and stare I Well you'd think I 
might be thrilled but baby I 
don't care"). Springsteen 
clearly does not seem to be 
revelling in his fame. 
Many of the following songs echo the tone and tempo of the first. In fact, It Is not until the bayou flavored fourth track "Spare Parts" that we get any hint of the backbeat and rhythm which made Springsteen so famous. Even then, the tune epitomizes the hopeless, despairing theme Inherent throughout much of the album. The chorus conveys this Idea effectively, albeit quite pesslmistlciy ("Spare parts I And broken hearts I Keep the world turnln' around"). 
Although the most commer­cially successful song on the album will most likely be the already overplayed "Brilliant Disguise, " the true jewel of the album Is most certainly the title track. E Street Band member Roy Blttan's systheslzers and Nils Lofgren's guitar blend per­fectly with Springsteen's in­cisive lyrics to create the Coney Island atmosphere around which the song revolves. 
Springsteen uses the song to convey the fear and confusion felt by many In today's younger generation. He seems to be telling us that we must keep searching hard to flnd the goodness In the world ("But the house Is haunted and the ride gets rough I And you've got to live with what you can't rise above ..."). 
The bleak "One Step Up" picks up the bail where "Tunnel of Love" left off, further accen­tuating the idea that something Is definitely wrong In the world­-or, at least, in Springsteen's world (''I'm slttln' here In this bar tonight I But ail I'm thlnkln' is /I'm the same old story, same old act ..."). 
This is definitely not an al­bum for everybody. For those who have Identified with Springsteen over the years and have stuck with him through thick and thin, this album will simply be seen as a new direc­tion for "the Boss." However, for those expecting a carbon copy of Born In the U.S.A, Tunnel of Love may prove to be a great disappointment.

continued from page 16 
tion mark. 

The Large Dorm Division Champion played great foot­ball for four weeks and looked like a true powerhouse -until they ran into Flanner in the last week of the season. 
Flanner beat Dillon 6-0 in a game full of key turnovers, and now Dillon will have to face Flanner again in the first game of the playoffs. It's do-or-die time for the Big Red. 
Dillon's key weapon through­out the season has been fresh­man running back Tim Murphy. His ball carrying along with Steve Murphy's re­ceiving helped the Big Red to a 55-14 point advantage this season. 
Dillon's challenge will be to avenge that lone loss, but if it does, it will then be faced with a strong, but smaller, Pangborn team -Dillon's path to the trophy is a rocky one. 
Alumni (3-1) 

What a turnaround! 
The once-proud Dogs are back on their feet again. 
Alumni entered the season with something to prove. The 1986 version of the Alumni team went 0-5, and a repeat of that performance just wouldn't do. 
Well, the Dogs put together a team loaded with freshmen, coached by democracy, and full of spirit -the result was a 3-1 record and a spot in the playoffs. 
"The best part of our team," said player-coach Mike Brcik, "is that we have unity. We're all students and we all coach together.

very good -but they have also 
showed signs of mediocrity. 
In games like a 24-7 rout of Grace or the key 6-0 victory over Dillon, the Flannerites looked like the powerful squad they have the potential to be. At other times, though, -like in a 7-6 loss to Keenan -the Flan­ner seemed lackadaisical. 
One thing the Flanner team has plenty of is experience. This year marks the third season in a row that Flanner has made the playoffs. 
Flanner relies heavily on two people. On offense, running back Dave Kane is the key weapon. Kane handles the ball a large percentage of the time behind Flanner's huge offen­sive line. 
The integral part of Flan­ner's defense is linebacker Brian Freisen. The sophomore has only played in two games this season due to injury, but his return for the playoffs makes Kelly happy. 
"He's all over the field, and he really hits," said Kelly. "There's no way you can't notice him on the field." 
Despite the fact that the Flannerites have already beaten Dillon once, there's no way that they are taking their first-round playoff opponent lightly. 
The key for Flanner could be whether or not they show up ready to play. 
Fisher (3-0-1) 
Fisher is a team with an image problem. First, they come from the Small Dorm Division. On top of that -they weren't even the champions of the SDD. Teams may be taking the Green Wave too lightly. 
The Green Wave used an old­fashioned wishbone to pile up 48 points in four games. Two freshmen, Mick Greene and Pat Murphy (4 TD's), have led Fisher on offense. 
The powerful defense (only seven points allowed in four games) has been led by sopho­more Jim Turecek whose 'big plays and leadership' at linebacker have been an in­spiratiion. 
"We've got to take these games one at a time," said Fis­her coach Chris Carlson. "First, we've got to get past Alumni; then Stanford. We're just looking for the chance to play them -then we'll see what happens."

end, Pete Skiko and his 
wideout, Mike Cihak. 
In order to qualify for the playoffs, Alumni took a hard­fought, 8-0 victory over Cavanaugh. Brcik scored the lone touchdown of the game on a six yard run. 
Alumni's first playoff test in two years wil be against a team with even less playoff experi­ence-Fisher. The Green Wave with its stifling defense will be a tough challenge for the offen­~iye !!!ind~d Dogs. 
With the likes of Fisher and then the hallowed Stanford team in its way, Alumni's big­gest test may just be surviving the playoffs. 
Pangborn (3-0-1) 
Pangborn dominated the Small Dorm Division with a high powered offense and a very strong defense -but dominating the SDD is a bit dif­ferent than playoff competition against the likes of Dillon, Flanner, and Stanford. 
It just might be that this Small Dorm Division team is too small. Pangborn will face the winner of the Dillon-Flanner game, and Dillon and Flanner are two of the biggest teams in the entire interhall league. 
Despite scoring 77 points in the regular season, Pangborn's defense is its strongpoint. The Pangbornites have allowed only 13 points this season. 
Pangborn's running attack is keyed on two men -fullback Dan Bailey and tailback Greg Defilippo. Their running and the occassional 'keep 'em honest' pass by quarterback John Jacobs allowed Pangborn to tear through the Small Dorm Division. 
"I don't know if we've got the best team," said Sherman, "but in one game, anything can happen." 
Flanner (2-1-2) Flanner is the ~ost difficult playoff team to ftgure out.

But at the Naval Academy, 
just about everyone knows. 
Notre Dame is always a big 
game for the Midshipmen, who 
seem to have more rivalries 
than they know what to do with. 
Perhaps the Irish would pay 
more attention to the rivalry if the recent series was a little closer. Last year's 33-14 victory over Navy was the 23rd in a row for Notre Dame over the Middies. The last Navy quar­terback to beat the Irish was Roger Staubach in 1963.

Associated Press 
SAN ANTONIO, Texas -The money -all $3 million of it -is wonderful, said Greg Norman. 
But should it count? 
The Australian raised the question Wednesday on the eve of the Nabisco Championships of Golf, the richest tournament golf has ever seen. 
Norman is among the elite 30 golfers who are competing for $2 million, with $360,000 to the winner, in the Championships of Golf. 
In addition, the tournament that begins Thursday on the Oak Hills Country Club course serves as the culmination of the Nabisco Grand Prix of Golf, a season-long point list based on players' performances in regular-season events. 
Another $1 million, with $175,000 to the winner, will be distributed in the Grand Prix competition. 
And that money will be "of­ficial," meaning that it will count toward the season's money-winning lead. It is the first time so-called bonus money -anything other that ac­tual tournament prize money ­has been counted as official. 
"This offsets what happens on the golf course," said Nor­man, the "Great White Shark" who led the American and Australian tours in money­winnings last season. 

"It penalizes the guy like me -and there are only a few of us -who travel a lot and don't play the 25 to 28 tournaments a year in this country that you have to play to be competitive in the Grand Prix. 
"If they had this last year, I wouldn't have won the money title," Norman said. 
"I think they have to intro­duce something to be more fair to everyone," he said. Then he offered a disclaimer. 
"Of course, it's my decision to play abroad instead of playing here all the time," he said. 
Ben Crenshaw had a differ­ent view. 
"This tournament was meant to be a bonus, a reward for the fellows who have played the best all year. 
"It was meant to be an im­portant, season-ending tourna­ment. It's certainly that," Crenshaw said. 
Norman quickly agreed that "the bottom line is that it's great for all of us to be playing for this kind of money." 
In addition to the enormous prize money to be distributed, such important titles as Player of the Year and leading money­winner will be decided this week, along with the finals of the team charity competition, in which another $1.4 million in charitable contributions will be determined. 
Curtis Strange is a central figure in most of the races that end this week. 
He leads Paul Azinger in both the Player of the Year and money-winning races, and is in front in the Grand Prix stand­ings.

Senior sweeper 
Lowney provides 
By MOLLY MAHONEY Sports Writer 
Talent, quickness, experi­ence and leadership. 
These qualites are bound to get an opponent's attention. Add to that list an air of confi­dence and a tenacious style of play and now you have also earned his repect. 
For the past four years when the Notre Dame soccer team need a sufficient dose of these they simply turned to one player: senior co-captain Steve Lowney. 
As both a sweeper and a wingback, Lowney has had a significant impact on the team since he earned his starting po­sition his freshman year. 
"We would not be the same ball club without Steve Lowney," said Irish head coach Dennis Grace, "his lead­ership, attitude and work ethic are tremendous." 
Lowney has scored two goals this year, including the game­winner against Illinois State. He found the net for the first time since tallying three goals as a freshman. 
Yet his limited scoring is hardly an indication of his great importance to the team. 
It is defensively, when he is on the other side of the ball, that Lowney becomes danger­ous. Whether he is shouting his advice to the offense or frustrating his opponents with his aggressive marking, Lowney's leadership is one of the main reasons for the team's success. 
"I have to let the other team know that we've got someone in command," said Lowney, "and I'm very conscious of that. We become a lot more in­timidating if we talk a lot." 
Consistent defensive ability and the experience gained from playing 77 collegiate games has made Lowney a can­didate for all-Great Lakes Region honors as well as making him one of top players in the history of Notre Dame's program. 
"He has really learned to read the game," said Grace, "He is very quick and is a good athlete. On the field and off he is busy guiding and directing teammates." 
Lowney strives to improve his game, especially his heading and shooting, but focuses his efforts on his job as the team's co-captain for the second year in a row.

"My responsibility this year has been to make sure that the freshman are integrated into the team," said Lowney, "but I also have to take charge on the field and let the referee know if he's not doing his job."

SMC soccer splits over break 
By MOLLY MCNEILL Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's soccer team came out strong Saturday after a week off, combining consistent offensive pressure with unbreakable defense to shutout Wheaton College, 2-0. 
With the score tied 0-0 at the half, the Belles wasted no time in taking the lead. 
Three minutes into the second half, opportunity arose when the ball went out of bounds off a Wheaton player,

giving the Belles a corner kick. 
Sophomore Mollie Meehan booted the ball to the center of the goal box where Celeste Aquino got her foot on it and put it in the net, putting the Belles on top. 
The Belles controlled the majority of the game, keeping the ball in emeny territory and only allowing five shots on goal. 
The icing on the cake came with ten minutes left in the game when Gina Di Tinto stole the ball, dribbled down the field, and put the second point on the board for the Belles. 
"I was pleased with our team cohesiveness, especially after a week off," said coach Tom Van Meter, "the forwards worked together passing the ball well and our defense kept the ball out of our zone." 
The week vacation and only two days of preparation took its toll when the Belles faced Mic­higan State on Tuesday and fell 6-0. 
"The week off hurt us in our consistency of play," said Van Meter. "Michigan State is a very well coached team with a lot of talent," said Van Meter.

Fifth-year senior guard 
Freeman plays key role on offensive line 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 

Consider five to be Tom Freeman's lucky number. 
At his fifth position for the Irish -offensive left guard -and playing as a fifth-year senior, Freeman, wearing uniform number 65, is watching himself and his team enjoy the most success since he arrived on campus. 
"Tom has been steadily im­proving year in and year out since I've been here," says second-year offensive line coach Tony Yelovich. "He's given tremendous effort, he's a very dedicated young man who strives to improve and he has good work habits." 
It took Freeman all those work habits to survive his freshman year, where he was shuffled through various posi­tions on the defensive unit before finding a home on the offensive line. 
Freeman played both offen­sive tackle and defensive end at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City, but he earned his reputation at defensive end. He switched from defensive end to outside linebacker early in his freshman year. After suffering a groin injury, Freeman moved to middle linebacker in the spring of his freshman year. The game of musical positions finally ended with his arrival on the offensive line. 
"Gerry (former head coach Faust) decided I'd contribute more quickly as an offensive lineman," says Freeman. "I always thought I would be too small for the offensive line. When I graduated from high school, I was 220 pounds. 
The 6'4" guard from Shawnee Mission, Kan., has bulked up to 270 pounds since that time, and earned a start­ing position last year, in the first season of current Head Coach Lou Holtz. He joined classmates Chuck Lanza, Tom Rehder and Byron Spruell on what figured to be an inexper­ienced line. The line instead helped the Irish finish the season ranked 14th in the na­tion in total offense. 
"We had more experience than anyone thought," says Freeman. "During Gerry's last year the second team. We knew we just had to be aggres­sive and play the way we were capable." 

Hearns prepares for Roldan Hagler interested onlooker 
Associated Press 

LAS VEGAS, Nevada ­Thomas Hearns will try to be­come the first boxer to win titles in four weight classes when he fights Juan Domingo Roldan Thursday night. 
At stake will be the World Boxing Council middleweight championship, which became vacant when Sugar Ray Leonard retired after upsetting Marvelou's Marvin Hagler last April6. 
On hand for Hearns' bid to make history will be Sugar Ray Leonard, who stopped Hearns in the 14th round of a battle for the undisputed welterweight championship in 1981, and Mar­velous Marvin Hagler, who knocked out Hearns in the third round of an undisputed mid­dleweight title defense in 1985. 
Leonard will attend as a spectator, while Hagler will be a commentator on the closed­circuit and pay-per-view telecast of the scheduled 12­round bout at a 10,100-seat out­door stadium at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
"I'm evaluating the situa­tion,'' said Hagler, who is a pos­sible opponent for the winner. "I want to sit back, watch these guys and see what happens." 
"This fight will put me above everyone else out there," the 29-year-old Hearns said. "This fight definitely will make up for those two losses." 
Hearns, an 8-5 favorite, is one of 10 men to win at least pieces of three titles. Six of those 10 won their third titles in the 1980s when the number of weight classes doubled from the traditional eight and most championships have been been split. 
Only of two those six cham­pions held an undisputed title ­Roberto Duran, lightweight, and Leonard, welterweight.

Mter the season ended, Freeman decided to use his fifth year of eligibility upon graduation. Once again, he was joined by Lanza, Rehder and Spruell to form an offensive line that includes four fifth­year seniors. 
The four have played to­gether since they were on the second team as juniors during the 1985 season. 
"We all knew that we had a chance to come back and that 
For now, Freeman, having graduated as a history major with a 3.013 grade point avearage, is making sure he can make his final year in a Notre Dame uniform a special one for both himself and for the team. 
"We're not a great team yet, but we have the potential to be a great team," Freeman said. "We have to keep improving and eliminate our mistakes. The only thing that can stop us is ourselves. We can beat anyone in the country if we do all the little things right."

tial," says Freeman. "We all realized Lou Holtz was a great coach, great things could hap­pen and we wanted to make a contribution. We all love the game and playing for Notre Dame, and we wanted to make it last as long as possible." 
Freeman's experience on the line has helped both the starters and reserves on the line, according to Yelovich. 
"His experience has helped, and his work habits have helped because it shows the other young men how to develop, and how you have to work bards in practice to develop to your maximum abil­ity," says Yelovich.

Irish injuries do not stop at quarterback 
Irish head coach Lou Holtz often speaks of the importance of something called chemistry on a foot­ball team. 
When senior quarterback Terry Andrysiak's season ended because of a broken collarbone a few weeks ago at Pittsburgh, the Irish offense had to test a new chemistry under sophomore Tony Rice. Apparently it worked, and Notre Dame is now 5-1 after two big wins with Rice calling the signals. 
But perhaps more amazing than the ease with which Rice seems to be running the offense is the way Notre Dame's "No-Name Defense" has main­tained its poise in the face of adversity. Injuries have plagued Irish defensive coordinator Foge Fazio's defensive line and secondary, but the defense still has managed to keep non-Pittsburgh offenses out of the endzone on a consistent basis. 
"You've got to keep a consistent lineup in there," Fazio said. "That's important. But we really haven't had that luxury on the line and in the sec­ondary.'' 
This week, it's sophomore Bryan Flannery sitting out practices. Flannery stepped in at right tackle when Jeff Kunz was injured a few weeks ago, and played very well in Notre Dame's last two victories over Air Force and USC. Flannery suffered back spasms against the Trojans this past Saturday, and is questionable for this Saturday's game against Navy. 
"That injury hurts a lot because he played very well against the wishbone team -against the Air Force," Fazio noted, referring to the fact that Navy also runs the wishbone offense. "We're a decent defense when we have all of our people, but this is about the fifth week when a new face has been on the defensive line. You'll probably see (sophomore Ted) Fitzgerald start along with Kunz." 

Marty Strasen 

Assistant Sports Editor 
In flie secondary, Brandy Wells is doing it again. 
The senior, who has spent the last three years switching from cornerback to strong safety and back to corner, has been called on to try his hand at yet another position-free safety. Freshman Todd Lyght started the Air Force game after junior Corny Southall tore knee ligaments against Pittsburgh. 
But the Irish coaching staff decided it needed Wells' experience at the signal-calling slot on the defense, and Wells made 10 tackles at free safety against USC. 
"Todd will play, but Brandy will start," Fazio said. "Brandy is a heck of an athlete. His ability to play those different positions speaks well for his talent. Our free safety is the quarterback of the defense. He's got to call the signals and get us in the right formations. 
"Brandy has been adjusting very well in that role. 
We have a lot of confidence in him-as we do in all our players." 
The Notre Dame offense got a couple of pre­Halloween scares early this week when a couple of key players missed some practice time. 
Rice, who took a hit in the chin from USC's Marcus Cotton which resulted in 14 stitches and a mild concussion, missed practice Monday. 
Holtz said he would have to assume Rice might miss the Navy game at his weekly press conference Tuesday, but Rice has been back in the lineup and working with the first team in both Tuesday's and Wednesday's workouts. 
Senior flanker Tim Brown slipped while running a pass pattern Tuesday and landed on his shoulder. Brown was slow to get up and sat out after the incident, but was back in action Wednesday and feeling fine. 
Many Notre Dame fans and players might not realize that the Notre Dame-Navy series is the longest intersectional rivalry in the nation. Satur­day's game marks the 61st straight season the two teams have met.
