The road from hell

Iraqi refugees fear return 
SAFWAN, Iraq (AP)-Iraqi police will handle law and order in part of the demilitarized border zone with Kuwait, and refugees said Monday that is tantamount to sending them to prison or worse. 
Several serious problems re­main unresolved as U.S. troops pull out of southern Iraq and a 
U.N. peacekeeping mission pre­pares to move into the buffer zone straddling the Iraq-Kuwait border. 
About 300 worried refugees blocked a road Monday with a sit-in outside their dusty tent camp, chanting slogans in English such as "Save The People of Iraq," and "Saddam, Sad dam, Same As Hitler." 
The U.S. Army is caring for more than 11,000 refugees at an abandoned construction company in Safwan. About 6,000 displaced people, mostly Iraqis, are at a Red Crescent camp about a mile away on the Kuwaiti side of the border. 
They are among 40,000 Iraqi refugees in Iraq, Kuwait and 
Saudi Arabia, and some say they will try to prevent the Americans from leaving Safwan. 
"We will sleep in front of the American trucks," said Abu Nathal, a history teacher from Nassiriya. "Only the Americans can protect us from Saddam Hussein." 
The tens of thousands of U.S. troops still in southern Iraq are being withdrawn rapidly through the desert now that a formal Gulf War cease-fire is in place. 
Nearly half the 540,000 American troops have left the theater, the U.S. Central Command said, including the 17,000 troops of the 1st Infantry Division of the VII Corps, which this week began rolling from the Euphrates River south toward Saudi Arabia. 
Some U.S. soldiers will re­main temporarily with the refugees in the demilitarized zone until the U.N. Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission, a lightly armed 1,440-person peace­keeping contingent, is in place. 
The DMZ stretches six miles into Iraq, and three miles into Kuwait along 120 miles of bor­der. 
The head of the mission, Austrian Gen. Gunther Greindl, arrived Saturday in Kuwait, where he met with government officials be fore traveling to Baghdad, on Monday for similar discussions. 
But U.N. peacekeepers are not expected to arrive in Kuwait until later this week, and it would appear their deployment on the border is still one to two weeks away. U.N. officials have refused to give any timetable. 
Once in place, the peacekeep­ers have a strict and limited mandate to observe and "to in­terfere as little as possible" in the affairs of lraq and Kuwait, said Joachim Hutter, the U.N. delegation's acting spokesman.

Man arrested at Alumni 
By KELLEY TUTHILL 
Editor-in-Chief 
An incident in Alumni Hall Monday night led to the arrest of a man on charges of tres­passing and battery. said Chuck Hurley, assistant director of Security. 
The incident occurred at 
6:40 p.m. when two Alumni residents returned from dinner at South Dining Hall. One of the men went to the washroom, while his roommate returned to their room. When the student en­tered his room, he found a man he did not recognize there. 
Hurley said the man told the student he knew his roommate and was waiting for him to re­turn. The student then left the room to find his roommate and question him about the man. 
When the students returned to their room, they saw the man exiting the dorm. At this point they notice the man is carrying a bag so they follow him down an Alumni hallway to find out who is he and what he is carrying in the bag, Hurley said. 
The two students met up 
with the man at the southwest door of Alumni (closest to Dillon Hall). The man shoved the student and a scuffle resulted which caused the men to go outside of the dorm, said Hurley. 
Then the man threw a punch at one of the students which the student was able to duck. The man continued to try to punch the student. but he was able to avoid the hits. 
The student did not require medical help, Hurley said. 

The students were able to get a hold of the bag, said Hurley. They did not, however. see anything from their room inside the bag. 
At this point Security had been contacted and arrived on the scene to apprehend the suspect with the aid of the student. 
The man, a 29 year-old,·, white male, was arrested and charged with trespassing and battery, Hurley said. He is a: transient and is apparently traveling through the United States. 
The man is being held at the St. Joseph County jail, accord­ing to Hurley.

The evolution of interdepen­d!lnce and a common good is what has united the world for social justice, according to Agostino Cardinal Casaroli, former Secretary of State, Vat­ican. 
Casaroli provided the keynote address in the symposium "One llundred Years of Catholic So­cial Thought," being presented from April 14-17 at the Center for Continuing Education. 
The symposium, said Associ­ate Provost Oliver Williams, is meant to "commemorate the 
5H DIC.I( 
D(IV£ 

one-hundredth anniversary of Catholic social teaching." In 1891, the Catholic Church pub­lished its rirst encyclical "to shed the light of the Gospel on problems of social and eco­nomic life," said Casaroli. 
He then traced the parallel paths of the Church and world events leading to the recogni­tion of need for and the de­mand for an authority "capable of acting effectively on a worldwide level," he said. 
"The heart of Christian social teaching," Casaroli said, "is the human person...(with) the fam­ily ... who is prior in regard to the State and collectivity." The State, then, must "provide for the attainment of the 'common good' through the prohibition of abuses." 
World War II, and what Pope John XXIII said was the failure of individual national leaders, emphasized the interdepen­dence of individuals and States on others. The necessity of a universal public good, said the Pope, further displayed the

need for a unified international body, said Casaroli. Thus was the United Nations born, said Casaroli. 
"For the first time in its long history, mankind has set up a system... which is capable of confronting... all the problems associated with peace and de­velopment," Casaroli said. 
He also noted the correspon­dence between the UN's goals "and the responsibilities which Christian social doctrine at­tributes to the international community." 
Several of the UN's agencies, such as the United Nations Children's Fund, are instrumen­tal in achieving Christian social goals in the world, said Casaroli. For example, "the Church...(has) always sensed that the aims of the United Na­tions Organization for Educa­tion, Science, and Culture are congenial to her own," he said. 
However, according to Casaroli, in light of the Gulf War and what Pope John Paul II called "the widening of the gap between... (the) developed North and the developing South." 
Casaroli said the realization of the UN ideal "still seems far away." 
Other issues he listed as yet unresolved by the UN include economic tyranny by a few, world debt, and ecological problems. 
Casaroli wanted his "final word to be one of trust and hope," but warned that "institutions which claim to serve humanity should not for­get the real people involved." 
Agostino Cardinal Casaroli was born in 1914, has visited many nations to bring them to­gether with the Vatican, and was the Secretary of State, Vatican, from 1979-90, said Williams. 
Casaroli's speech, as is the four day symposium, was spon­sored by the University and the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Religious Values in Busi­ness. 
Copeland discusses changing social thought 
By FRANK RIVERA 
Assistant News Editor 

Catholic social thought is changing to meet "the intellec­tual, moral and religious chal­lenges" of the time, according to Sister M. Shawn Copeland, assistant professor of theology and black studies in the Yale Divinity School at Yale Univer­sity, in her lecture Monday. 
Copeland divided her lecture into three parts. 
The first part discussed the dilemmas which face Catholic social thought today, followed by a discussion on how the problems arise and finally, what functions Catholic social thought can perform in realiz­ing a "common good." 
Among the dilemmas faced, racism is not a "peculiar" problem in the United States, but has been a "pernicious and persistent" one, said Copeland. 
"Racism oversaw the Euro­pean discovery, colonization and destruction of North America," said Copeland. "It oversaw the American war for independence. It has been pre­sent and active in foreign and domestic policy." 
Secondly, problems can arise through a social contract thought, according to Copeland, in which some some people believe land is owed to them. Through this aggression arises some people believing they are inherently superior to another people, resulting in the "denial of truth, of dignity and of human being." 
Finally, added Copeland, modern Catholic thought could be changed to adapt to the cur­reot "social order" through "open-mindedness and open­heartedness," but, the main problem lies in defining the common good in most "contemporary thought." 
Copeland's lecture was part of the "100 Years of Catholic Social Thought" conference sponsored by the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Religious Values in Business.

Kurds relocated within Turkey 
ISIKVEREN, Turkey (AP) ­Turkey on Monday began mov­ing thousands of ill and starving Iraqi Kurds from this mountainous border settlement to camps farther inside Turkey where they will be easier to feed and shelter. 
At a squalid Iranian refugee camp, hundreds of Kurdish men said they were returning to Iraq to fight. 
But along Iraq's long borders with Iran and Turkey, thou­sands of uprooted people con­tinued to stream out of the troubled country. 
Turkish official said the number of refugees in their country stood at 500,000 and could soon reach 700,000. Close to one million have crossed into Iran or were en route. 
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said nearly 400,000 Iraqis have fled to Turkey and another 400,000 are reported to be across the border. 
She said from 400 to 1,000 refugees were dying each day in the Turkish border region, and the toll was increasing under the harsh conditions along the mountainous border. 
Dia Sindi, a 17 -year old Kurd in Isikveren, a tent city of 160,000 refugees, said she missed her homeland but would not return any time soon. 
"If they kill Saddam I will go back," she said. 
Sindi was among 2,100 refugees moved down from this 7,200-foot plateau to a new camp near the township of Silopi, 36 miles inside Turkey. The new camp will have water, electricity and medical supplies. The tent settlement will have a 400-bed hospital, 64 doctors and 129 medical personnel, Health Minister Halil Sivgin said. 
The order to move the refugees to new bases repre­sented a major policy shift for President Turgut Ozal's gov­ernment, which previously had kept the refugees in the moun­tains, saying it could not deal with the influx. 
Turkey has often suppressed its own sizeable Kurdish minor­ity, even banning public use of the Kurdish language, and bat­tled Kurdish rebels for years. At the same time, it has sheltered an estimated 60,000 Kurds since they fled Iraq in 1988. 
The Istanbul newspaper Hur­riyet said Turkey decided to al­low the refugees deeper into the country after President Bush assured Ozai the refugees would return to Iraq when Saddam Hussein's government collapsed. 
Turkish officials stressed that the resettlement was tem­porary.

or activity during your undergraduate years, and 64% of you attend church 
regularly. 
HOWEVER: Only 25% of you agree that to be a fully committed Christian, one must be involved in social justice work. The study also suggests that you are more interested in personal goals than in helping others in difficulty. If we were into berating ourselves, those of us you paid for your Catholic education would have to say we haven't really done our jobs. 
There are certain things we should have taught you, and made sure you learned. Included on the list would be such things as: Love God above all; love your neighbor as you love yourself; love your enemies; do good to those who persecute you; if someone slaps you on one cheek, let them slap the other, too; if anyone asks for your coat, give the rest of your clothing, too; sell everything you own and give the money to the poor. 
Didn't learn all that yet? It's not too late. Men and women who graduate from Notre Dame and other places of higher education with which the Congregation of Holy Cross is involved are invited to consider association with the Congregation, by becoming Holy Cross Associates. 
Such a postgraduate formation and volunteer program is not, at best, a time to fill doing good before embarking on a major career or further academic course, but can well be a time to continue an education and experience in making one's own faith commitment much more real and solid. 
The Holy Cross Associates program offers significant experience of service and communal living to men and women who have or are forming firm convictions about the integration of faith and their lives. Ideal candidates are willing and eager to enter a transforming experience, where they receive at least as much as they give. Associates spend one year living a common life with others in humble, but adequate circumstances and from that experience learn their place in the world at large, where they can continue to serve and minister as full members of the community Church, no matter what their circumstances. 
Seniors in the process of trying to figure out what to do for the next year need not apply. Those still trying to figure out what to do with the rest of their lives are most welcome to. Just drop by the CSC or the office at Moreau Seminary and turn in an application by Aprill7. 
And those of you who are not Seniors and cheated by reading this "Seniors Only'' column, feel free to keep thinking about it until you do qualify!

By SARAH VOIGT News Writer 
Three Notre Dame professors who read selections from their varied works revealed three different literary voices at the first annual Meet the Authors luncheon Monday. 
Professor of English Sonia Gernes recited poems colored by her female perspective and often inspired by her childhood in rural midwestern America. 
Gernes read from her two po­etry collections published by the University Press, "Brief Lives" and "Women at Forty." The subjects of her poetry varied from a Japanese 

immigrant  woman's  
homesickness  to  her  own  
grandmother's  stubborn  
unwillingness to die.  

Professor of Philosopher Ralph Mcinerny, creator of the characters in the Father Dowl­ing mystery series, read a funny excerpt from his new novel entitled "The Search Commit­tee." The humor stemmed from the conflict between a sarcastic old professor and a naive young student. 
Thomas Stritch, professor emeritus of American studies, shared passages from the book of his memoirs to be published by the University of Notre Dame Press this Fall. 
Stritch's autobiography begins with memories of his childhood in Nashville, Tennessee. The epilogue includes his opinions and reflections about the Notre Dame campus where he has lived and worked since he enrolled as a freshman in 1930. 
The Meet the Authors lun­cheon was sponsored by Notre Dame's Friends of the Library. James Carroll, President of the Friends of the Library, said that he would like to repeat the luncheon with readings from other University authors as well as from writers from the surrounding communities. 
When Gernes began teaching at Notre Dame in 1975, she

taught predominantly male classes as the coeducation pro­cess was in its early painful stages. 
Sixteen years later she is now editing a volume of women's poetry with James Walton in honor of The Year of Women. "I write about women's needs, joys, triumphs and strivings since women's stories are not recorded in the annals of wars and kingdoms," she said. 
Mcinerny, who Stritch re­ferred to as "the poor man's John Updike," has been a pro­lific faculty member since 1955. He said that the popular Father Dowling series based on his characters is now being tele­vised in England, Austria and Italy. 
His novel "The Search Com­mittee" ends a trilogy begun with his first novel in 1967. When the young student re­porter in his latest novel asks the professor what he teaches, he responds "Idiots, mostly." 
Stritch is the author of a wide range of scholarly articles and books, including "The Catholic Church in Tennessee." At the end of his autobiography he reflected on the majestic elms and maples that dot the cam­pus. Lest the audience be mis­lead, he added, "I am not a tree snob."

Mozart sonata to be presented 
Special to The Observer 
William Cerny, professor of music at the University of Notre Dame, will present a a commemorative all-Mozart sonata faculty piano recital at 8 
p.m. Thursday April 18 in the Annenberg Auditorium of the Snite Museum of Art. 
Prior to joining the Notre 
Dame faculty in 1972 as chair­
man of the department of mu­
sic, a post he left n 1981, Cerny 
served 13 years on the faculty 
of the Eastman School of Mu­
sic. 
As a young performer, he 
won the highest award given 
by the Music Education League 
of New York and the National 
Teachers Guild, appearing sev­
eral times as soloist with the 
Little Orchestra Society of New 
York, under the baton of 
Thomas Scherman. 
After completing his under­
graduate studies at Yale, where 
he was Phi Beta Kappa and 
graduated magna cum laude, 
he worked for five years be­
tween 1954 and 1959 as a pro­
fessional accompanist out of 
New York City, touring 
throughout the United States 
with such artists as cellist Aldo 
Parisot, international concert 
comedienne Anna Russell, pan­
tomimist Agna Enters, and the 
Columbia Artists' male concert 
quartet The Hevelers. His pro­
fessional work in New York City 
also included accompanying 
numerous artists in Town Hall 
recitals. 
At Eastman he taught several courses in history, in addition to teaching piano. During this time he remained active as a public performer. 
From 1963 on he held dual associate professors rank, one in humanities and one in music literature. In 1968, he devel­oped his "Explorations into Pi­ano Literature" for presenta­tion to college and university audiences throughout the country. 
An outgrowth of these con­certs was his series of weekly radio programs broadcast for years via the National Public Radio network. From 1968 to 1972, Cerny was the adminis­trative director of the master of music degree in performance and literature at the Eastman School. 
Through his extensive per­forming and teaching experi­ence, Cerny has developed an extensive chamber and solo repertoire, including the com­plete 62 Hayden sonatas, the 19 Mozart sonatas, and 36 of the standard works in the literature. Since his appoint­ment at Notre Dame, he has maintained an active performing schedule that has included performances as soloist and as chamber mu­sician both on campus and at other colleges and universities. 
He has made five separate guest appearances with the Chicago Symphony String Quartet. He also has made more than 65 recordings of the solo piano literature (more than 165 titles) and has now made them available for college and university libraries throughout the country. 
His series of radio programs continues to be broadcast weekly by stations around the country.

Congress urged to lift ban 
WASHINGTON {AP) -A sci­entist described for Congress on Monday the nation's first fetus­to-fetus transplant, but said future operations are jeopardized by the administra­tion's ban against federal sup­port of research using electively aborted tissue. 
Robert Slotnick, an obstetri­cian and geneticist at the Uni­versity of California at Davis, said it won't be known for weeks whether the surgery last May, involving the transplanta­tion of tissue from an aborted fetus, saved a child born in November from a fatal disease. 
"I wish I could tell you this was a success, but we don't know that yet," said Slotnick. "But I can tell you this work can't continue without the sup­port of the federal govern­ment," he testified to the House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee. 
Slotnick recounted for law­makers the still unpublished experiment in which tissue from a fetus aborted in an ec­topic, or tubal, pregnancy was transplanted into a fetus with a rare disease called Hurler syn­drome. The parents had two other children who died from the disease. 
The hope, said Slotnick, was for the transplanted tissue to produce blood cells that, in turn, would manufacture an enzyme that is missing in Hurler syndrome victims. He said it would be several weeks before he can determine whether that was the case. 
The privately financed work Slotnick did, as it turned out, would not have violated the federal financing moratorium because the tissue came from a medically necessary abortion in a woman who had a dangerous tubal pregnancy. The ban ap­plies to use of fetuses from elective abortions. 
But Slotnick said tissue from ectopic pregnancies is generally not a good source for trans­plant, partly because it is more prone to infection. He originally intended, he said, to use tissue from an elective abortion, and it was only by chance that that was not the case. 
The parents of the child, Guy and Terri Walden of Houston, testified that they are ardent opponents of abortion and "we want to see it become illegal." But, Guy Walden said, "we don't see this (fetal tissue transplants) as being markedly different from other trans­plants." 
Since abortion is legal in the United States, "stopping this tissue from being used isn't go­ing to bring (the aborted fetus) back," he said. "What about the moral question of if we can help a child but we don't?" 
Even if abortion were illegal, tissue from spontaneously aborted fetuses and others could be used, and cell lines from this tissue could possibly be grown in laboratories in large quantities, they said. But without the initial research, the possibilities would never be known, they added. 
Rep. Henry Waxman, 0-Calif., subcommittee chairman, as­sailed the administration for imposing the indefinite morato­rium on federally financed re­search using tissue from fetuses that were intentionally aborted.

Legal 'ethics' exist 
By JOSEPH ADAMS 
News Writer 

"Legal ethics is not an oxy­moron," said Professor John Robinson, director of the White Center on Law and Government. 
Robinson, who spoke to Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students last night in a lecture titled "Why Ethnics is not an Oxymoron," stated that legal ethics needs to be addressed because the profession of law is perceived as "morally corrupt­ing." 
Because lawyers invest so much of themselves in repre­senting morally questionable cases, it is necessary to show how law is not inherently cor­rupting, he said. 
Robinson derived inspiration for his first defense of law from the first letter of John in the Bible. The letter "tells the Christian community that we have one who pleads our case before the heavenly father." The advocate in this case is Je­sus, Robinson explained. 
He added that this biblical example suggests that there might be "a significant human good" in people placing them­selves between a powerful sys­tem and the individual. Such an unequal confrontation is "demeaning" and "even the guilty should confront authority on some level of equality." 
Robinson stated that lawyers are needed to "reestablish equilibrium" between an indi­vidual and the huge, impersonal judicial process. "This seems to be a very good thing," he said. 
The lecture also focused on "the fundamental need you and I have as citizens to be able to perceive the process as fair." The judicial process has to be totally free of prejudice, both in appearance and reality, accord­ing to Robinson. 
When a defense attorney "takes a case and makes it as vigilantly as it can be made" and "tests the state's case at every imaginable point," the system's fairness is more read­ily insured, he said. Such a process is the only way to guarantee a fair trial. 
Robinson added that two 
classes, "all those ever eon­
fronted by large, frightening, 
unrelenting systems" and "you 
and me in our eapacity as citi­
zens," need this proteetion. 
According to Bobinson, the general public has to have "confidence in the proeess" in order for the system to continue to funetion. By acting as mediators between the system and the individual, lawyers en­sure that society perceives the legal system as fair. 
What endangers lawyers is "smugness, complaceney, lazi­ness, and indifferenee." lie continued, "Clients rarely get what they expect," which is a "bright, zealous, knowledge­able" attorney. 
Because lawyers often are not able to devote enough of their time and effort to dients, tlHJ legal process suffers, explained Hobinson. 
Lawyers also frequently are unable to relate to their clients beeause attorneys "assume that clients have really thought through what they are asking lawyers to do." He added that lawyers ean combat this prob­lem by communicating more with their clients. 
Robinson concluded his lec­ture by calling law "a necessary profession, and potentially a non-corrupting one." He said he knew many lawyers who are both "good lawyers and good persons" and that their "goodness is not independent of what they do professionally." 
The lecture was part of the Professional Ethics Lecture Series and was sponsored by the Office of the Provost, the University Honor Committee, and the Student Academic Council Committee.

Mrs. Bush offers opinions 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Bar­bara Bush said Monday she hopes Saddam Hussein will be hanged for war crimes against Kuwait and his own people. 
"He certainly is right up there with the people they tried ... (after) World War II," said Mrs. Bush. ''I'd like to see him hanged if he were found guilty," by a war erimes tribunal, she said, adding that "we're talking about thousands and thousands" who were killed and tortured. 
She called the plight of the Kurdish refugees "heart­breaking," but defended Presi­dent Bush's response to the cri­sis, in which hundreds of thou­sands of Kurds have fled for their lives to the Turkish border and Iran. 
"He hasn't let them down," said Mrs. Bush, adding, "I don't think anyone envisioned what happened" after Saddam Hussein's army crushed a Kur­dish rebellion. 
"I think this is where the brave new world is going to come in. This is where the United Nations has to take over," said Mrs. Bush. 
She also revealed, in a 90­minute luncheon meeting with reporters, that former first lady Nancy Reagan called her to thank her for denouncing Kitty Kelley's gossipy biography as "trash and fiction." 
And she said her son Neil Bush is being "persecuted" by federal regulators in their probe of a failed Denver savings and loan. 
She said the entire Bush fam­ily has rallied around Neil, 36, but she sharply dismissed any comparison with the way the Kennedy clan has dosed ranks after a woman claimed she was raped at the Kennedy com­pound in Palm Beach, Fla., by a nephew of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. 
"If you don't mind my saying so, I'd rather you didn't men­tion their latest flap in the same breath wit.h my innocent son," said Mrs. Bush. 
Of Saddam Hussein, Mrs. Bush said, "I detest him. I just detest him." 
"What they did to the Kuwaitis was so outrageous.... I think everybody's shocked, though, at the turning on his own people like this," she said. 
"He broke many, many inter­national laws," she said, and a war crimes trial "would be only fair." 
On other issues, the first lady: 

Laughed off the possibility that any tell-tale books would be written about the Bush's private lives. "In our case, in all honesty, there's just not a whole bunch to tell." 

Scoffed 
at Kelley's report that Mrs. Reagan arranged pri­vate meetings in the White House with Frank Sinatra. "That's the biggest joke in the world. Would that you should be so lucky," said Mrs. Bush. "About 200 people can walk through this house.... Nobody can come up and not be seen." 

Allowed 
she "might be tempted" to fire aides who 


leaked information to the press. 
Dedined 
to give her opinion on the Brady bill mandating a seven-day waiting period for gun purehases, saying ''I'm not going to pass judgment on President Beagan" who recently endorsed it. 

Hevealed 
that "Millie's Book," about the family dog's life at the White House, has al­ready generatnd $625,000 in royalties for her literacy foun­dation. It's been on the best­seller lists for seven months. 

Said 
Lee Atwater, the later Republican party ehief, did not need to "apologize at all" for using escaped killer Willie llor­ton as an issue in the 1988 campaign against Democrat Michael Dukakis. 


The first lady agreed that it is a 98 percent certainty that Bush will seek re-election in 1992. But she added, "It is very tough to have your children suffer for a job you have." 
Mrs. Bush said Neil Bush is considering pursuing new busi­ness opportunities in Texas. He is facing possible sanctions for his role as an outside director of Silverado Savings and Loan, which went bankrupt at a cost to taxpayers of $1 billion. 
"It is terrible for him, an ab­solute outrage," said Mrs. Bush. "He's done nothing wrong. He's the most honest, caring, giving man I know and I think he's really been persecuted." 
Mrs. Bush said she was "in awe of" her husband's equa­nimity during the Gulf War.

Women participating in sports refute columnist's sexist slant 

LETTERS 
Charges of football illiteracy unjustly implicate female fans 
Dear Editor: 
Cheer, cheer for old Notre Dame. It is great to feel I am a part of this spirited family that revels in coming together on Saturday afternoons to hail a team that no matter what the 
A.P. poll says, is number one. (Yes, Mr. Snyder, I do under­stand what football rankings mean.) It really pained me to see that all of those days I spent cheering for a team that I thought represented both the men and the women of Notre Dame were wasted because I obviously cannot understand the game as well as my male counterparts. 
Apparently, the Notre Dame administration neglected to mention in Du Lac that women are incapable of achieving that state of near frenzy when play­ers such as Rod Smith pull off yet another Fighting Irish mir­acle. We poor, ignorant women­folk should only be present to caress the bruised egos of the menfolk when our offensive or defensive plays go amok, or to fetch them a beer when their palates so desire. Ah, the joys of being a woman. 
My daddy didn't raise a fool, and he most certainly didn't raise a football illiterate. Maybe Mr. Snyder had partaken of a bit too many "brew-has" when he foolishly composed his poignant piece of male chauvinist garbage. My experience of football at Notre Dame has been just as reward­ing as his beer-bellied, belching buffoons. Yes, I too participate in section pile-ons, hysterical shouting and the general Irish euphoria that can be found in the stadium and dorm rooms alike. And no, it really isn't nec­essary to provide women a room for watching animated fairy tales, powdering noses, or as an outlet to gossip about how lucky we are to be cheering for "their" team. 
The only fairy tale that I would like to see is for some of the men of Notre Dame to get off of their butts, open their minds and leave their ugly jokes about women behind them. While we are in the pro­cess of eliminating problems, why don't we start with that in­sipid, sexist quiz. 
All I can say to Mr. Snyder's "humorous" description of male/female football interaction is that he is going to find it really difficult to invite over any 
woman games.  for  future  football

Observer exhibits poor judgement 
Dear Editor: 
I should hope this is one of many letters The Observer re­ceives concerning Michael Snyder's article "Women and Football: Do They Mix?" (Nov. 
14) Just to be concise, allow me to name a few adjectives that come to mind: immature, of­fensive, creatively and stylisti­cally lacking, and magnificently unfunny. 
What really sickens me is that The Observer would print such an intellectually void and on­humorous article. Time and space, not to mention that I must "jump up to 'freshen up' in the powder room," do not permit me to completely rehash the offensive phrases and innu­endos in the article. I would not want to insult anyone's in­telligence by pointing out the obvious. I certainly would not want to print the key lines from the article more than once; that might be a little too much hu­mor for the campus to take. 
I understand The Observer may print articles not necessar­ily acceptable to everyone, but I should hope there could be a more entertaining, or even in­tellectually stimulating, use found for three-quarters of a page of journalism. I'm just so glad I'm one of the "girls" who . knows the game of football, so I'm "not that bad". Thanks so much for opening my eyes; now I need to go look at videotapes of football players' butts. 
Meg Taylor Pasquerilla West November 14, 1990 
By Chris Cooney 

"Women and Football: Do They Mix?" A better question might be "Freshmen and Newspaper Columns: Should They Be Allowed?" The answer, exhibited by at least one Observer article (Nov. 14), is a resounding "no." 
Not only does Michael Snyder insult every sports-loving woman on this campus, he also perpetuates the stereotypes and prejudices that exist at Notre Dame. Love of football does not depend on the presence of a Y chromosome in one's genes. Replace the word "girls" with "blacks" or "homosexuals" and what type of reaction do you think you will receive? This type of sexism should never be tolerated at. a university in the 1990's. 
I hope that most of Synder's comments are based on what I see as extreme ignorance and immaturity. I, too, sat in a room of both men and women (all seniors) to watch the Notre Dame-Tennessee game. 
However, any "yapping" was done by everyone, and both genders had insightful and in­teresting comments to make on the game. The men did not turn into "heathen animals." The women did not "gossip." We were more worried about the officiating and the lousy com­mentators than the "powder room." In fact, I'd bet that a couple of us "girls" could teach Snyder a thing or two about the sport of football. 
I hope as Snyder goes through his four years at Notre Dame he will realize that peo­ple do not always fall into easy gender stereotypes. Although he calls himself a journalist and insists that he listened to all sides of the issue, I'm sure that most of his quotes were fabri­cated -revealing his own atti­tudes at the expense of a num­ber of people. Although he tries to lighten the tone by suggest­ing that both men and women take his tongue-and-cheek quiz, the damage was already done. 
Women on this campus play interhall football. Women on this campus work for the sports department of The Observer (the sports editor last year, in fact, was a woman). Women on this campus work as managers and trainers for the football team (and not because they enjoy looking at 300-pound players). 
I'm sure the writer intended his column to be humorous. He'll probably be amused at the amount of angry mail he re­ceives. But chauvinism is not a laughing matter, especially in what is supposed to be the "Year of Women." 
I hope the next time someone with only. three months experience on this campus decides to write a column he will not resort to tired, overused subjects in his quest for an easy laugh. We female football fans would rather read something by someone who knows what he is talking about. 
Chris Cooney is an assistant sports editor for The Observer. 

LETTERS 

-Article stifles relations between sexes 
Dear Editor: 

I am writing in response to Michael Snyder's article (The Observer, Nov. 14). Mr. Snyder's views are his own and he has the right to hold them regardless of how sexist and ill­informed they are. I do not, however, feel that the Observer was right in printing the article. If this article were about blacks, Hispanics, or any other minority group, there is very little doubt in my mind that no editor would allow its publica­tion. 
I also would like to speak for many of the women on this campus who were equally of­fended. I know that others were angered by this article, because, walking across cam­pus today, I repeatedly heard complaints about it. 
First of all, why is knowledge of football a requirement for derstand and enjoy the game, and some of us want to learn enough to do so. Maybe some women don't want to learn about football, but I still have tremendous difficulty with the logic used in this article. 
If "men did not want any women to be in the same room with them during the game," then why was the solution "to not invite members of the op­posite sex" outvoted? 
"Grown, cultured, and civi­lized men" do not write and publish sexist and demeaning articles. 
And why should anyone imply that "all they're doing is looking at the players' butts?" What is attractive about a 300 pound man's butt? Mr. Synder should take the time out to listen to a few male comments about groups such as the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders. "Wow, then proceed to carry hair spray, powder, perfume, deodorant, lipstick, hairbrush, curling iron, nail polish, and other amenities with them to these "powder rooms?" These women must also lift weights, a "manly" sport, in order to carry a bag that would probably weigh twenty pounds. 
Lastly, I would like to thank Mr. Snyder from those of us who understand football and passed the quiz. We swear, yell, drink beer, and, when so inclined, belch right along with the rest of you. It's nice to know that we are "not that bad," even though being female appears to be an inherent evil. 
We are, however, taking votes on that Heisman Trophy win­ner. Remember girls, keep on watching those buns! And don't forget how to "give the Heisman" to all those so-called

Yale tradition suspended after women are invited 

NEW HAVEN, Conn. (API ­Skull and Bones, the all-male sAcret society at Yale whosA members include President Bush, was ordered closed for a year by its alumni directors after rebellious students invited women to join. 
The alumni directors have been d11bating whether to end the private club's 159-year-old tradition as a bastion of male­only bonding, but were having difficulty reaching a decision. 
The 1 5 seniors in the current class of Bonesmen, frustrated by thn lack of action, notified the board of dirnctors at an ernergnncy mneting Friday night that thny had invited snven womAn and eight men to join. 
In response, thA board over the w1wkend rnplaced the locks on the 'Tomb," the windowless, mausohmm-like building where the sodety meets. 
Sidney Lovett, the society's sncretary and assistant trea­surer, said Monday that the alumni directors had no choice but to suspend operations for a year. 
Skull and Bones is not an in­stitution that will allow its tra­ditions to be changed "arbitrarily or in an unautho­rized way," Lovett said. 
None of the juniors tapped by the class of 1991 will be recog­nized as membnrs, he said. 
The current Bonesmen said tlwy were seeking the help of some of the society's influential alumni in turning the board around. Even if they are unsuc­cessful, thlly said they would

"What they've done is a throwback to the 19th century," said a spokesman for the group. lie spoke on condition of anonymity because of the so­ciety's strict rules about secrecy. 
Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., a Bonesman from the class of 1963 who serves on the Yale Corporation, the university's board of trustees, issued a statement saying that the deci­sion by this year's club "should be respected and accepted." 
Yale began admitting women in 1969. Only one other senior society, Wolf's Head, remains all-male. At Princeton Univer­sity, the last holdout among five all-male eating clubs admitted women in February after more than a decade of legal battles to keep them out. 
While refusing to admit women, Skull and Bones has an otherwise diverse membership. Black, Hispanic and gay stu­dents are members of the cur­rent club. 
Lovett said it had never been the intention to change the all­male policy before 1992. He said there was no great urgency to resolve the matter this spring. 
The board had announced it intended to decide the issue this spring after soliciting the views of the more than 800 alumni members. 
Hey

PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP)-A supermarket tabloid published a photo and the name of the victim in the alleged assault at the Kennedy estate Monday de­spite a Florida law prohibiting the disclosure of rape victims' identities. 
Also Monday, the results of forensics tests were turned over to police, who said they have identified new witnesses. 
The Globe, headquartered in nearby Boca Raton, printed a photo of the woman who says she was sexually attacked at the Kennedy estate, along with a detailed story about her back­ground. 
Globe Managing Editor Robert Taylor said he might have a statement later. 
It was apparently the first time the woman's name had appeared in a U.S. publication, though it has been published in England. 
Under state law, publishing or broadcasting a rape victim's "name, address, or other identi­fying fact or information" is a second-degree misdemeanor punishable by a 60-day jail sentence and a $500 fine. 
William Kennedy Smith, 30, a medical student and a nephew of Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, has denied at­tacking the 29-year-old woman March 30. No charges have been filed. 
The analysis of evidence from the so-called rape kit prepared by doctors who examined the woman and of blood and hair samples taken from Smith was completed and turned over to police Monday, said Dr. Richard Tanton, director of the Palm Beach County crime lab. 
He said he knew what conclu­sions can be drawn from the test results, but was not at lib­erty to disclose them. 
Tanton said it may take six to eight weeks to complete more complex DNA testing. DNA pro­vides a genetic fingerprint that can be extremely accurate in identifying an attacker.

Craig Gunkel, spokesman for the Palm Beach police, said "the investigation is continuing at a very active pace. There are additional witnesses that have been identified that need to be interviewlld." 
He would not elaborate on the witnesses or on the lab results. 
Gunkel also said the Palm Beach police will not participate in a planned meeting by the state attorney's office with lawyers for the woman and for Smith. That meeting has drawn criticism from Police Chief Joseph Terlizzese as unneces­sary because prosecutors usu­ally prepare charges based on the police investigation. 
"That's the chief's decision," said Gunkel. "We'll present it all at one time to the state attor­ney's office." 
Jack Freese, a spokesman for the state attornlly's office, said the meeting with attorneys to discuss evidence has not been scheduled and may not be held this wllek.

Emphasis on research harms undergraduates 
Editor's note: The following is part one of a two part column. 
The most important con­struction project on campus this year is neither the peace center nor the classroom building. It is the two signs proclaiming Notre Dame as "A National Catholic Hesearch University." One first might ask whether "national" is descriptive of "Catholic" rather than "university" in light of the reality that Notre Dame is a "Catholic" university with a de facto orthodoxy of dissent. 
Twenty years of teaching Notre Dame graduates leads me to conclude that Notre Dame does not otTer its students a pre­dictable and reliable oppor­tunity to study the heritage of the Catholic faith, especially as seen in the documents of Vatican II and papal teachings. The student who takes "pot luck" in his courses will be at risk of studying those subjects through a distorting lens provided by a professor who more or less adheres to the new American Church. The ordinary NotrA Dame graduate, to my ob­servation, tends, through no fault of his own, to be a functional illiterate with respect to know!Adge of the actual teachings of the Catholic Church. 
Thn main significance of the signs, however, arises from their proclamation that Notre Dame is now a "research university." This might prompt a discussion of ways to achieve greatness in research and teaching at the same time. A more basic point is that Notre Dame's description of herself as a "research institution" confirms the displacement of her historic educational mission by the pursuit of a greatness measured by the politically correct norms of the secular academic: establishment. 
Hesearch is a valid part of the academic enterprise. But researrh itself is not education. Tht~ primary historical focus of Notre Dame had been the nducation of undergraduates in the Catholic tradition, with research and graduate studies playing a balanced and im­portant role in the overall mission of the University. Now, however, Notre Dame is submitting to politically domi­nant trends in the pursuit of prestige as a great "research university." 
While the official rhetoric emphasizes that teaching and research are equally important, the undergraduate students know better. 
And so do the faculty, espe­cially those who are untenured and who realistically conclude that the procurement of grants and the generation of publica­tions count more heavily for purposes than time spent with students. The Student Government report submitted to the Board of Trustees in May, 1989, noted that ".all of the pro­fessors we spoke to believe that research is considered to be much more important than teaching in the hiring, tenure and promotion processes" (p.6). (Emphasis in original) 
The education of under­graduates is moving toward the status of an afterthought at Notre Dame. The undergrads pay the price for the pursuit of research prestige in more frequent mega-sections, more reliance on teaching assistants, and increased difficulty in gaining entrance to courses they want and ought to be able to take. They see a building program that will, for the first time, move major university buildings to the very edge of the campus (as they do at big urban universities which have prestige and, besides, someone paid 33 million dollars for the project). 
The building program has already obliterated a very substantial part of the students' athletic fields (in a "research" university perhaps they will be more interested in spectator sports and coffee houses). We are a residential university with policies, apparently designed in part to avoid University liability, which tend to drive even non­drinking students off campus for social activities. 
Students have to park their vehicles in remote lots with an increase of danger. The security force has been expanded but, through no fault of its own, an increasing part of its job seems to be, not to protect the stu­dents but to enforce against them and others the more

complex and pervasive rules re­quired by the pursuit of greatness. Our family has had undergrad students continually at Notre Dame since 1977, and we know that, in these and other respects, there has been a marked deterioration in the academic quality and general tone of the undergraduate ex­perience. 
One thing that students and their families can rely upon is that they will pay an escalating tuition, beyond the rate of inflation, every year. In 1979­80, undergraduate tuition, room and board totalled $5,630. In 1990-91, the figure was $15,745. For 1991-92 the figure will be $17,080. Almost three­fourths of freshmen at Notre Dame in 1990-91 came from families earning $50,000 or more annually, compared with fewer than one-third in 1972. The figure for families earning $100,000 or more is not available. 
Notre Dame is making a very commendable effort to provide financial aid for needy students. The University's financial aid is understandably available, however, only if the student has first taken all the student loans for which he is eligible. But as the tuition increases, so will the number of families who will not be able to cover that cost through financial aid and the student and parent loans for which they are eligible. This is especially true for middle class families who do not qualify as needy. 
The University has chosen to pay for its pursuit of greatness by increasing both tuition and its own financial aid commitment, with the con­sequence that "non-needy" families from the traditional Notre Dame constituency may find themselves unable to bridge the gap from their own resources and borrowing power. The escalating tuition figure itself presumably also deters some such families from even considering enrollment at Notre Dame. 
The long-term trend points toward a Notre Dame where the only students from even middle class families will tend to be ROTC students, racial minorities, scholarship athletes, and faculty children. The University emphasizes that its tuition is in the lower range of the "leading" universities. However, the "leading" uni­versities' general practice of hiking tuition in pursuit of research greatness is itself unjust. 
There are worse offenders, but the question is whether Notre Dame ought to be riding even with the rear echelons of that pack of exploiters. In truth, it is deeply immoral to impose on students and their families the burden of paying for research prestige that bears only a marginal relation, if any, to the education of those students. 
Undergraduates who are not from wealthy families or_on special financial aid .enlerge from Notre Dame wfth a loan commitment so h.tlavy that it impedes a free choice of grad­uate study and career options. This distortion of.career choices occurs as well on the graduate level, especially with law stu­dents. The Law School tuition is set directly by the University. For 1991-92, Law School tuition will rise by $1,115 to $14,095, apart from expenses, compared with $13,505 for undergradu­ates. Law students of middle or lower economic means have to pile law school loans on top of their undergrad debts if they want the sort of legal education which Notre Dame uniquely otTers. 
We make an effort to en­courage students to see the law in light of faith and ethical principle and to use their legal education for the common good. Yet when those students are graduated, their loan burdens frequently oblige them to go to big firms where high pay too often comes at the price of in­sane working hours, marital stress and professional frus­tration. Needless to say, the loan burdens caused by the University's pursuit of research greatness make it difficult for young married alumni to main­tain in their marriages an openness to new life as required by the moral law. 
Advanced research is very expensive. And the focus on research tends toward a "bottom line" preoccupation with grants and money in gen­eral. Notre Dame's endowment reached $605.6 million on June 30, 1990, 15th highest among American institutions of higher learning. It would be helpful if someone in the Administration would explain how it is morally sound to raise tuition substantially beyond the inflation rate every year to pay for the "research" enterprise while the University continues to build a record endowment that is not used to reduce tuition. Of course, that is what the prestige universities do. And if we channel new donations away from endowment and into efforts to hold tuition in line, how can we ever become 14th highest? 
A preoccupation with "research" greatness is one symptom of a university's pursuit of "PC"-political cor­rectness. "PC" has taken on a specific content for the '90s . It is the program of a generation of campus radicals who grew up in the '60s and are now achieving positions of academic influence. If they no longer talk of taking to the streets, it is because they now are gaining access to the conventional weapons of campus politics: social pressure, academic perks (including tenure) and-when they have the administration on their side-outright coercion" ("Taking Offense," Newsweek, Dec. 24, 1990). 
Notre Dame is no latecomer to the pursuit of a generalized version of PC. For decades, the University has sought to be "great" as well as "Catholic," implying wrongly that there is a tension between the two con­cepts. Notre Dame has sought acceptance as a "great university" according to the standards of Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and other institutions which could be described in '90s terms as "politically correct. "

Tlw nxhibii will remain on display until December 14, in Moreau Gallery. 
The work of Lisa Lockhart, oil paintings, graphite drawings and rnixPd mndia sculpturn, are "pnrsonal abstract narra­tivns ... " and "fragments" of her past. The pair.tings range in size from 16x20" to 5x6' with nach containing a multitude of information achieved by lines both narrow and wide, straight and curvnd with the thickly paintnd surface both hiding and rnvnaling abstract shapes and forms. Eaeh color. in all of the paintings has an inttmsity of its own-from the fiery reds to the midnight blues-that work to nmphasize the abstract quality of each painting. 
The drawings arn mainly graphite that relies on the repetitive motion of the line that moves around in an organic motion to create an image. 
The sculptures are equally as intriguing as the rest of the nxhibit, partly due to the small sizn in comparison to the overwhelming amount of two­dimensional work. The size attracts the viewer's attention, and draws them in to further inspect the surface quality as well as the content of each piece that can be viewed from all sides. 



This exhibit will rflmain on display in Little Theatre Gallery un 
The third exhibit, by Warren Seelig, is titled, "Columns, Wings, and Up the Wall." These sculptures are constructed of thin metal rods and different colored meshed fibers that are suspended from the ceiling and hanging on the wall. The color of the fiber is individual to each piece that is stretched tightly over an entire section and creates a protective layer over the intricate inner structure of each piece. The forms have a stable look to them, yet because they are suspended from the ceiling they become precarious. This forces the viewer to become intensely aware of the space he or she is entering. 
This exhibit will also remain on display in Hammes Gallery until December 14. 

A self-portrait by Bart Kasten is an example of a Type-C print with a photo silkscreen. 
This exhibit by Warren Seelig represents his work with suspended columns.

-Flames break away from Canucks in third period 
VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -Tim Sweeney ~cored on a breakaway in the third period to trigger the Calgary Flames to a 6-4 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on Monday night. 
Sweeney broke a 4-4 tie with his third goal of the season at 
6:28 on a pass from Mark Hunter, helping Calgary (13-8­
2) end a four-game winless streak. 
Sergei Makarov clinched it when he added his second goal of the game at 11:10 and the Flames pulled within one point of the leading Los Angeles Kings in the Smythe Division. 
Sweeney's first NHL goal came on opening night when he 
scored in overtime  to  beat  
Vancouver 3-2.  
Robert  Reichel,  Joe  

Nieuwendyk and Theoren Fleury scored the other Calgary goals against Canuck goaltender Kirk McLean. 
The Canucks (10-11) got goals from Igor Larionov, Robert Kron, Jyrke Lumme and Garth Butcher on goaltender Mike Vernon. 
Calgary's power play clicked three times in four opportunities as special teams proved to be the difference. Vancouver was 2-5 with the man advantage. 
The Canucks the opened 
scoring after McLean's brilliant save on Fleury's rebound fol­lowing a point shot by AI Macinnis. Larionov beat Vernon with a 25-footer from the left circle at 2:24 of the first period after a drop pass by Greg Adams on the rush. 
Calgary tied the score with rookie Reichel's fourth goal of the season. He fired into an open net at 17 minutes after McLean accidentally poked the puck away from Lumme. 
The teams split six goals in the hectic second period domi­nated by power plays. Each team scored twice with the man advantage. 
Nieuwendyk got his 14th of the season and seventh on the power play before Kron tied the score at 2-2. Kron broke in on the short side to beat Vernon between the legs at 4:42. 
The Flames went ahead 4-2 on goals by Fleury and Makarov, the first on a power play and the second on a re­bound after a poor clearance by Canuck winger Steve Bozek. 
Vancouver rallied on power­play goals by Lumme and Butcher from the point as Vernon was beat on the stick side both times. Butcher's came with 18 seconds left in the sec­ond after he intercepted a clearing attempt by Doug Gilmour.

lgwebuike acquitted in smuggling case 
TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -Minnesota Vikings kicker Donald lgwebuike's acquittal in a seheme to smuggle heroin from his native Nigeria has put his football career back on track ­and he says he's ready. 
"I want to kick. I want to play next season ... and I want to get on with my life," lgwebuike said as he puffed on a victory cigar outside federal court following Monday's verdict. 
11-.rwebuike could have faced up to 120 years in a federal prison and $6 million in fines if con­victod of conspiracy and drug importation. 
The 32-year-old lgwebuike, known to his fans as "lggy," said he will return to Minneapolis to train for next season. 
The NFL declared lgwebuike exmnpt after he was indicted and he missed the last eight games of the 1990 season. He was left unprotected by the Vikings, but no NFL team claimed him and the Vikings re­tainnd his rights. 
Vikings vice president Jeff 
Diamond said lgwebuike will be welcomed back, but must fight for a starting spot. 
"The intent always was to give him time to get his situation re­solved," Diamond said. "Once it was resolved, we wanted him back." 
Jurors deliberated 5 1/2 hours over two days in a case that fo­cused on lgwebuike's relation­ship with two Nigerian friends who pleaded guilty to their roles in the scheme. 
Defense attorney Frank Winkles blasted the govern­ment's case for relying on tes­timony from one of the admit­ted heroin smugglers and se­cretly recorded phone conver­sations full of oblique refer­ences in which the player was alleged to be talking about drugs. 
"In the end, when everything was said and done, the gov­ernment's case was so full of contradictions," Winkles said. "The type of people they were relying on -nobody would rely on people like that." 
Authorities stumbled onto the 
smuggling attempt last October 
when Madawuba Ibekwe was arrested at Orlando International Airport with nearly half a pound of high­grade heroin packets he had wrapped in electrical tape and swallowed. 

Ibekwe led authorities to an­other friend of the football player's, lbezim Ofedu, who was arrested in Tampa after accepting a heroin shipment from a undercover agent. 
Ibekwe later pleaded guilty to heroin importation charges and faces a possible sentence of eight years in prison. Ofedu, who pleaded guilty to smug­gling conspiracy, faces up to 40 years in prison. 
Ofedu also agreed to cooper­ate with authorities, recording several phone conversations with Igwebuike that became the cornerstone of the government's case. 
Drugs are not specifically mentioned on the tapes, spoken mostly in the Nigerian language lbo, but they show Igwebuike referring to numbers that co­incided with the numbers of heroin packets seized in the case. 
Past Foreman opponents inspired by comeback 
ATlANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) ­The night club bouncer knew the preacher could do it. 
That the preacher succeeded is inspiration to the hotel bell­hop. 
Friday night, George Foreman, a former heavy­weight champion-turned-evan­gelist, will at age 42 challenge Evander Holyfield for the title. 
Rooting him on will be Don Waldhelm, a bouncer in a Brooklyn, N.Y.. night club who also works for the New York City Housing Authority, and Levi Forte, a bellhop at the Fountainbleu Hotel in Miami Beach, Fla. 
Waldhelm was knocked out in 
the third round when Foreman 
launched his first pro career in 
1969. In Foreman's 12th pro 
fight that same year, he scored 
a 10-round decision over Forte. 
When Waldhelm heard 
Foreman was coming out of 10 
years of retirement in 198 7, he 
told his brother, "If he doesn't 
lose, he'll get a title shot. The 
guy will get a title shot. The 
public loves a winner." 
"My brother laughed at me," he said. 
The 54-year-od Waldhelm quit boxing after Foreman, while Forte continued until 1978. 
Now Forte's competitive juices are flowing again. 
"If George can do it, I can do it," the 50-year-old Forte, who has 11 grandchildren, said in a telephone interview. 
"Actually, l never retired. I just stopped fighting." 
Forte hopes to fight in May if he can get a license from the Florida State Boxing Commission. 
Forte has no trouble recalling his fight with Foreman. 
"He caught me in the first round and broke three ribs," he said. "I went down. I didn't know the ribs were broken." 
When Muhammad Ali was 
preparing for his upset of 
Foreman for the title in 197 4, 
he sought out Forte at the 
Fountainbleu and asked him, 
"How did you do it?" 
"Stay away from him, just 
stay away or he'll kill you," 
Forte replied.

Penguins blank Devils 4-0; Blues, Flames fighting for survival 
(AP)-Jiri llrdina and Frank Pietrangelo spent most of the stretch drive watching as their tnammates led the Pittsburgh Penguins to their first-ever di­VISIOn championship. On Monday night, both got their chance in the spotlight. 
llrdina, a seldom-used for­ward, had two goals and Pietrangelo, a backup goal­tender, stopped 27 shots as Pittsburgh blanked the New Jersey Devils 4-0 in the seventh and deciding game of their Patrick Division semifinal series. 
The Penguins will meet the Washington Capitals, third­place finishers during the regu­lar season, in the division finals beginning Wednesday night at Pittsburgh. 
The Penguins got an emotional lift when All-Star defenseman Paul Coffey, expected to be out for the rest of the playoffs, was in the starting lineup wearing a special face guard to protect an injured eye. Coffey's goal early in the third period wrapped up the scoring as the Penguins won for only the second time in nine attempts in the deeisive game of a playoff series. 
"Having Coffey in the lineup gave them a big lift," Devils coach Tom McVie said. "He's one of the top two or three players in the world. His pres­ence certainly had a psycholog­ical advantage." 
"I wasn't even thinking about playing when I went to the doc­tors (Monday) morning," Coffey said. "They said there was no risk in playing and that any injury would be a new injury. I got a little nervous and scared about two hours (before game time), but I didn't think about it when I was playing." 
Hrdina and Mario Lemieux, who did not play the last two periods due to back spasms, gave Pittsburgh a 2-0 lead after one period. 
The Penguins made it 3-0 just 29 seconds into the second pe­riod when Phil Bourque skated down the left-wing boards and threaded a pass through the crease to Hrdina, who beat Chris Terreri to the glove side. Hrdina took only one shot in the first six games of the series and had just one two-goal game during the season. 

Pietrangelo, who started and won Game 6 when Tom Barrasso was unable to play due to a shoulder injury, had little to do in the first two peri­ods as the Devils managed only 13 shots. New Jersey appeared deflated and tentative after a questionable call by referee Bill McCreary late in the second pe­riod of its 4-3 loss in Game 6 disallowed Laurie Boschman's apparent tying goal. 
"Instead of kicking them when they were down, we let them get back into it when we let them win Game 6," Devils defenseman Ken Daneyko said. "We didn't get anything going all night and it didn't get any better." 
"When we came home after winning Game 5 (in Pittsburgh), I had no doubt that we would be playing in the second round," McVie said. "We lost the series Saturday in New

Jersey. We took home ice ad­vantage away from them twice and gave it back twice." 
Dr. Charles Burke, the Penguins' team physician, said Lemieux felt much better after icing his back during the final two periods and would probably play Wednesday. Lemieux's problem was related more to the playing every other day and the constant travel than his earlier problems, Burke said. 
"He has a greater risk (of spasms) because of his history, but he was 50 percent better after the game," Burke said. "He'll be better (Tuesday) and even better the next day." 
On Tuesday night, the St. Louis Blues and Calgary Flames will try to make NHL history. 
Both teams have rallied from 3-1 deficits to force deciding games in their best-of-7 series -St. Louis vs. Detroit and Calgary vs. Edmonton. The Blues and Flames will try to cap their comebacks at home and join seven other NHL teams that have won playoff series after trailing 3-1. 

"Both teams are on equal footing now," Detroit coach Bryan Murray said after St. Louis evened the Norris Division series with a 3-0 victory Sunday. "But they're in their building and that gives them an advantage." 
Theoren Fleury scored in overtime at Edmonton after in­tercepting a pass by Mark Messier, giving Calgary a 2-1 victory over the Oilers in Game 6 of the Smythe Division series. 
"We've got to forget about it now, regroup and go at it for Game 7," Messier said. "It should be a great game." 
The winner of the Calgary­Edmonton series will advance to the division final against the Los Angeles Kings, who elimi­nated Vancouver in six games. The St. Louis-Detroit winner will play the Minnesota North Stars, who upset the Chicago Blackhawks in six games. 
St. Louis star Brett Hull said the Blues didn't get discouraged after losing three of their first four games to Detroit. 
Magic surpasses Big 0 in assists 
INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) ­Magic Johnson surpassed Oscar Robertson as the NBA's all-time assist leader, getting 19 to lead the Los Angeles Lakers over the Dallas Mavericks. 
Johnson tied the record with 
6:46 left in the second quarter, setting up James Worthy for a short jump shot. He got his record-breaking ninth assist with 5:44 left in the period, lobbing a pass to Terry Teagle, who made a 15-foot jumper from the right basline. 
Worthy led the Lakers with 23 points and Teagle finished with 
21. Johnson scord only seven points and had nine rebounds and 11 turnovers. 
Derek Harper led the Mavericks with 29 points, 19 of them in the fourth quarter, while Herb Williams added 22 points and 11 rebounds. 
Rockets 97, Sonlcs 93 
SEATTLE -Otis Thorpe scored 28 points, including the go-ahead basket with 6:05 to play, and the Houston Rockets beat Seattle 97-93 to pull into a second-place tie with Utah, one game behind San Antonio in the Midwest Division title chase. 
The Rockets, 24-6 since the All-Star break, and Jazz are 51-27 overall to San Antonio's 52-26. Each team has four games remaining. 
Giant suspended 
NEW YORK (AP) -Kevin Mitchell of the San Francisco Giants was suspended for two games and fined an undisclosed amount by National League president Bill White on Monday for his role in a brawl on April 10 at San Diego. 
The suspension begins Tuesday, when the Giants play Los Angeles. 
Mitchell, whose five home runs leads both leagues, was brushed back by Padres pitcher Bruce Hurst in the fourth in­ning of last Wednesday's game after hitting a home run in his first at bat. Mitchell was re­strained from going after Hurst following the brushback pitch, but charged the mound when the next pitch bounced and hit him in the foot. 
Mitchell hit Hurst with a body block before being tackled by the Padres' Fred McGriff and was ejected from the game.

SPORlSSHORTS Foyt prepares for comeback at Yalvo!lne 200 
LONG BEACH, Calif. -A.J. Foyt's plan to begin his racing comeback next weekend in the Valvoline 200 at Phoenix lntHrnational Raceway may have run into a snag. 
The 56-year-old Foyt, a four-time Indianapolis 500 winner and the winningest driver in Indy-car history, was badly injured in a race crash last September at Elkhart Lake, Wis. He continues on a therapy program for badly mangled feet and legs and tested last week at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
But Foyt, who has been hoping to get back behind the wheel of his Lola-Chevrolet for some real competitive driving on the one­mile oval at Phoenix, said, "We're wanting to drive at Phoenix. but we don't know if we're going to be released by Dr. (Terry) Trammell to drive. 
"I'll be there (in Phoenix), but I don't know whether or not I'll drivo." Trammell is a notod orthopedic surgeon and the director of modical serviens for CART, the Indy-car sanctioning body. 
Foyt was in Long Beach on Sunday as a team owner, with BMnard Jourdain of Mexico driving his car in the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach on the downtown street drcuit. 
Asked If he still plans to drive in the May 26 Indianapolis 500­a record 34th consecutive start in that event-even if he can't raee in Phoonix, Foyt said simply: "Absolutely." 
Ibrahim Hussein wins second Boston Marathon 
BOSTON -Ibrahim Hussein kept his eye on the finish line and won tho Boston Marathon for the second time. Abebe Mekonnen made the mistake of kooplng his eye on the man who was supposed to win. 
By the time Mekonnen realized that Douglas Wakiihuri wouldn't live up to his billing as the favorite in a strong field, it was too late to catch up. 
llussein Hasily held ofT a latt~ surge and beat Mekonnen by 16 seeonds Monday. 
The Kenyan didn't particularly care that his time of 2 hours, 11 minutes. 6 seconds was slow. What mattered was simply crossing the finish line first one year after sutTering an injury he felt might ond his outstanding career. 
"I won. That was the most important thing," Hussein said. "I wanted to prove to myself that I am still competitive and can still win." 
American soccer player first of his kind In Soviet Union 
MOSCOW -American Dale Mulholland. the first foreigner to play professional soccer for a Soviet team, said he was surprised to see his teammates trading caviar and vodka for their Western opponents' cleats and warm-up clothes. 
But since joining the high-ranking Soviet team Lokomotiv Mosc~ow moro than a year ago, the former Orlando Lions forward has found everything unusual. 
"Every time we go abroad on tour, the players turn into businessmen," says the 26-year old native of Tacoma, Wash. "Thoy spend all their time trading with teams to accumulate Western goods." 
His favorite story is about one enterprising goalkeeper who bought three photocopiers while touring Singapore. 
Lacrosse faces road test vs. Wooster 
By DAVE McMAHON Associate Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame lacrosse team returns to the road today to face Division III power College of Wooster. The Fighting Scots, ranked 17th in the latest Division III poll, sport a 10-1 record and are in the midst of their best season ever. 
Wooster carried a 4-0 record into last season's matchup with the Irish (4-5), but Notre Dame outscored the Scots 7-3 in the second half en route to a 12-8 win. 
"They always give us a tough game," said third-year Irish coach Kevin Corrigan. "They're playing great right now, so we'll have to be ready to play from the outset." 
The Irish have had little time to ponder Saturday's 10-3 loss to Cornell, in which a sharp Irish defensive showing was sidetracked by a lackluster of­fensive performance. 
"A lot of our problems are mental. We start thinking about things too much offensively," said Irish senior defenseman Pete Gillin. "Hopefully against 0-Woo we'll put some of these things behind us and play the type of game that we're capable of playing." 
All-American attackman Steve Davidow, who tallied 51 goals and 33 assists last season, sparks the Scots offensively. Senior Andy Fox dished out 45 assists for the Scots in last year's campaign. 
At Wooster, the Irish begin a season-ending road trip that will send them to Lake Forest, Ill, Columbus, Ohio, and East Lansing, Michigan. 
Although a Division III team, Corrigan expects another un­wavering eiTort from the Scots. 
"We're in no position to go out and wait for them to play their game," said Corrigan. "We have to play aggrossively and keep them from scoring early." 
Irish sophomore midfielder Brian Mayglothling and junior attackman Brian Schirf con­tinue to put impressive num­bers on the board for Notre Dame. Attackman Mike Sullivan was held scoroless for the first time all season in the Cornell game. 
With a defensive performance similar to that of the Cornell game and an improved offen­sive attack, the Irish should re­turn from Wooster with a win that would put them back at the .500 mark heading into their final drive for an NCAA berth. 


Senior tri-captain Mike Sennet and the Irish lacrosse team take on Division Ill College of Wooster today in Ohio. A win will put the Irish back at the .500 mark with a 5-5 record. 

 Men's tennis dominates at MCC's 
Observer Staff Report 
The Notre Dame men's tennis team prepared itself for its fmal three matches of the season with a phenomenal showing at the Midwestern Collegiate Conference Tennis Championship held Sunday in St. Louis, Mo. 
Rain plagued the tournament, which was originally scheduled to take place Saturday and Sunday on outdoor courts. But after a gulley-washer Saturday and no relief in sight, tourney officials decided to complete the event in one day. 
The Irish started the day at 2 
p.m. with sophomore Chuck Coleman beginning the Notre Dame onslaught at number-one singles. Junior AU-American Dave DiLucia, who has been on a tear for most of the season, bypassed the tournament to rest his back. Fourteen hours later at 4 a.m., the Irish packed their bags and returned with six of the eight spots on the AII­MCCTeam. 
"We're probably a step better than most of those teams down there," said Notre Dame Coach Bob Bayliss. 
Following Coleman's 7-5, 6-1 win, junior Will Forsyth, in his first MCC Championship Tournament, cruised to a 6-0, 6-1 victory. 
Sophomore Mark Schmidt rolled to a 6-2, 6-2 win at num­ber-three singles, while Ron Rosas had little problem in his 6-2, 6-1 win at four-singles. 
Chris Wojtalik snagged an­other win for the Irish with a 6­3, 6-1 win for the number-five singles championship. Tommy North completed the singles sweep for Notre Dame, taking a 6-3, 6-3 win. 
With the downpours forcing action inside, courts were few and far between. Because of the unending rain, tournament officials moved the match sights to a variety of courts throughout St. Louis. 
"We played on four different court surfaces and we adjusted pretty well," said Bayliss. "We deserve credit for grinding it out." 
And a grind it was. Some players played in six different matches within the fourteen hour period, including semi-fi­nal rounds. 
"The whole tournament turned out to be a logistical nightmare," said Bayliss. "We were trying to take advantage of any indoor courts available." 
Because of the time con­straint, the doubles matches were played in a six or eight game pro-set format. 
At number-one doubles, Forsyth/Coleman rolled 8-4, followed by a 6-4 win by Schmidt/Wojtalik. The only loss for the Irish in the fmals came at third-doubles, where the freshman duo of Todd Wilson and Tad Eckert took third place. 
Joining Coleman on the All MCC squad are Forsyth, Schmidt, Rosas, Wojtalik, and North. 
With the two doubles titles, the Irish move into second on the all-time MCC list with nine. 
While the Irish faced a mini­mal amount of competition at the MCC Championships, their final three matches will be detrimental to their shot at an NCAA bid. 
"These next three matches are critical for us," said Bayliss. "We feel we need to win all three to get into the NCAAs." 

The Observer/Kenneth Osgood Junior transfer Will Forsyth was one ofsix players from the men's tennis team named to the AII-MCCteamSunday in St. Louis.

days as we did twice this past season during the second semester is very difficult for the student athlete. Yet, to play the television schedule and power games with the conference teams, you have to play on the dates available outside of the conference schedule. With the new NCAA rule, regarding the student-athlete's time, of 20 hours per week with a day off in a seven-day period, it might be even more difficult to schedule 27 games as an independent. 
Our home is South Bend. I love the community, the people, the lifestyle. About 10 years ago, I made a decision with my family to stay here and turned down a chance to coach the New York Knicks in the NBA. Terry had just earned her doc­torate in 1980 and was offered a teaching position in the law school. Our children were fi­nally settled with their friends and school activities. The four of them gave me a chance to get here. During the 1970-71 season, from an assistant coaching position at the University of Pennsylvania to the head coaching position at Fordham and finally the head coaching position at Notre Dame, we moved five times. Since that time, our family's roots have been at 122 Peashway. It's our base. It's our foundation, no matter what life's challenges bring any of us. 
It's time to move into the next decade for me.

I walk into the funeral not knowing quite where to sit. 
The vultures, the press, sit near the front, hoping to record that tear when it streams down the face of Digger Phelps. The mourners sit in the back, probably telling remember when stories and hoping this is some kind of cruel -------­joke. 
All are here to pay their last respects. I take a seat in the middle. 
It's the retirement announcement for Phelps, who just completed his 20th season as Notre Dame's head basketball coach. This isn't like Roger Smith stepping down at GM. No one is waiting in the wings with a cake. 
It's almost like a White House press conference when someone introduces Phelps and he appears from behind a magic curtain. (There's that darn reference to that Bush administration thing again.) 
He speaks slowly but confidently, reading from a prepared text. He answers every question. The rumors are history now. 
Twenty years is a long time, too long for some. Maybe the time was right for a change. Maybe the program needs some new blood pumped through it. 
Phelps said he always wanted to coach 20 years at Notre Dame and call it a career. He has said in the past it would be "very hard" to coach another college team. Notre Dame is the place where you want to end a career. 
He didn't get the farewell tour complete with rocking chairs and framed photos in his last season. Sometimes, when you're 12-20, they slam the door instead of throwing the party. 
Digger stressed that the decision was his and his alone. He denied any bad blood between himself and athletic director Richard Rosenthal, who issued a whopping four-line statement concerning the announcement. Rosenthal is probably not planning to hold the retirement party at his house. 
Now the speculation begins as to whom will 


Digger closes 20 years of Irish history; next in line has a class act to follow 
replace Phelps. Some of the names mentioned most often include Xavier coach Pete Gillen Southern Methodist coach John Shumate, and ~ handful of others ranging from stupid in Duke's Mike Krzyzewski to intriguing in Georgia Tech's Bobby Cremins. Take Gillen and give the points. 
It's safe to say that whomever the candidate is, he will never match the flamboyancy and class of Phelps. He will never match the green carnation. Or the fluorescent green jerseys for that matter. 
He always said give him three tapes and three days and he could beat anybody. Just ask top­ranked UCLA. Or San Francisco. Or Marquette. Or DePaul. Or Kentucky. Or Virginia. Or North Carolina. 
I can vaguely remember watching that game against UCLA when I was six, although when you see something that many times you just assume you were there. 
But that probably won't be my biggest memory of Phelps. This one is of a game I didn't even see in person. It was last year in Syracuse when Elmer Bennett hit that shot and Digger did that jig across the floor of the Carrier Dome. 
Was it really just last year? It seemed so distant as he stood there and read his memoirs. 
The questions end. He says he will go back 
to his office with his staff. Maybe someone will have a cake there. 
I wish him good luck. It seemed like the thing to do. 
I look briefly into the basketball arena. hoops here until October 15. No more Digger forever. 
Notre Dame doesn't retire uniforms, but maybe it should get a dark blue Armani suit, pin a green carnation on it and hang it from the rafters. They could do it on Digger Phelps Day when the season opens next fall. Twenty years deserves something. 
Phelps said Father Theodore Hesburgh had the most influence on him in the Notre Dame community. He said when it's said, done and historians have recorded it, people will realize how much Hesburgh really did for Notre Dame and the world. 
The same will probably be said when thos historians get together and rehash the Phel career.
