By JOSEPH McMAHON News Writer 
While many of their peers tail­gated or slept in before the Michigan State game Saturday, a number of Notre Dame students spent their pre-game hours set­ting up recycling stations around campus. 
The 65 volunteers handed out blue recycling bags and manned recycling stations to collect any recyclables from the tailgates and r,oncession stands that litter cam­pus. Their efforts, which involved working shifts from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., were part of the University "It's easy bein' green at ND" envi­ronmental campaign.

Energy events proinoted 
October week will address environment 
By BRIAN McKENZIE 
News Writer 
Responding to an advocacy group's report card that graded the University poorly for its sus­tainable policies, Notre Dame is aggressively promoting the upcoming Energy Week, which begins Oct. 7. 
In February, the Sustainable Environmental Institute gave Notre Dame a D-minus -the lowest grade of 100 schools meas­ured -for the University's green­ing and endowment policies. 
The Student Senate on Sept. 19 voted 24-0 to endorse a commit­ment to promote carbon neutrali­ty and reduce greenhouse gas emissions on campus. The meas­ure was a "strong gesture to work towards [those goals]," Stanford senator Ryan Brellenthin said. 
"The first step to improvement is to measure carbon emissions," he said. 
Doing so would be an "eye­opener" that would encourage students to take small steps to reduce their environmental impact, such as using more effi­cient light-bulbs and turning off electronic appliances when they are not in use, he said. Brellenthin also said that the University's off­campus efforts, such as planting trees in Uganda, would move Notre Dame towards carbon neu­trality. 
Frank Incropera, former dean of the College of Engineering, will promote ecological awareness by leading a discussion on Thursday.

Expert: Irish language 
on verge of extinction 
By PUJA PARIKH 
News Writer 
The Irish language is in danger of dying in part because no well-established body had led the fight to revive it, a historian said Friday. 
"[The Irish] language appears to be on the brink of extinction," said Gear6id 6 Tuathaigh, professor of histo­ry at the National University of Ireland, Galway. "No sus­tained organization has made a stand against the abandon­ment of the language until recent times." 
The talk, part of the annual "Why Irish?" lecture, was sponsored by the Department of Irish Language and Literature to discuss this "language problem" in Ireland the conflict between having both the Irish and English language as a large part of Irish culture. 
"English has become the language of power from the 17th century," 6 Tuathaigh said in his speech, which was titled "Language Change, the State and National Identity in Ireland Since the Great Famine." 
"In the 18th century, 45 percent of Ireland was Irish speaking. In the mid-19th century, that percentage dropped to 30. In the late 1800s, learning the Irish Ian-

Man beheads tame duck 
behind hotel 

ST. PAUL, Minn. -A man was in custody Sunday after police said he ripped the head off a tame duck that lived in a hotel lobby's orna­mental pond. 
Scott D. Clark, a guest at the Embassy Suites Hotel in St. Paul, cornered the duck early Saturday morning, grabbed the bird and ripped its head from its body while a hotel security guard and others watched, police said. 
Clark then turned to onlookers and said: ''I'm hungry. I'm gonna eat it," St. Paul police Sgt. John Wuorinen said. 
TODAY a:: 

"He was allegedly drunk," Wuorinen said. 
Clark, 26, of Denver, was detained by hotel security guards until police came to arrest him. 
He remained jailed Sunday on suspicion of felony animal cruelty and was scheduled to appear in court Monday to be charged. 
A phone message left for Clark at the jail was not returned Sunday.

Scholar studies immigrants 

Migration center director seeks to promote cultural understanding 
Special to the Observer 
Migration is a global econom­ic process, not a new problem, according to anthropologist Karen Richman, director of the year-old Center for Migration and Border Studies at Notre Dame's lnstitutfl for Latino Studies (ILS) and fellow of the Kellogg Institute. 
Migrants, a source of cheap labor. always will gravitate to areas where the cost of living is higher. It was true of Irish and Polish immigrants in the 19th century, just as it's true of Mexican, Haitian and Salvadoran immigrants today. 
"Mexico is not always going to be a migrant-sending coun­try," Richman said. "Another will take its place. It's a process that transcends national poli­cies." 
The challenge, she says, is to help people understand that, rather than making immigrants scapp,goats. 
U.S. workers, Richman points out, have not done well since the 1970s. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into effect in 1994, she said, many jobs have left the U.S., while American workers have stayed in place. 
"Combine that with migrants on the corner, and you get anti­immigrant sentiment," she said. 
But immigration has already fundamentally altered the face of America, Richman said. "The children of immigrants arc Americans," she noted. "They're here to stay." 

As a cultural anthropologist, Richman's expertise is in explaining the human experi­ence of migration. Her 2005 book, "Migration and Vodou," told the story of how and why Haitian peasants, descendents of the only successful slave rev­olution in the New World, were transformed into U.S. migrant workers. Her researeh detailed the ways the migrants main­tained religious traditions and family connections to loved ones in Haiti through the use of technology such as cassette tapes. Nowadays, she says, video and cell phones help fam­ilies stay in touch. 
Richman's current research project focuses on a woman named Elena, a member of a Mexiean trans-national migrant family. 
"In 1984, she crawled through rat-infested water pipes and ran through fields being shot at, and chased by dogs, to come to the United States," Richman said. 
A legal resident since 1986, Elena raised her family clean­ing houses -it's how the two met. "She cleaned my house," Richman says. 
Richman was drawn to Elena by her wit. "She.'s a tremendously elo­
quent woman," she said, adding that she attended the "University of Life." 
"What I've been doing over the past year and a half is interviewing her and writing her story." 
Elena has strong views on the subject of immigration reform. Richman says, quoting her: "We clean their floors, and take care of their children so they can do other jobs. Why are they picking on us?" 
Elena came to the U.S. as an undoeumented immigrant. Today she is a successful American citizen. The third annual Notre Dame Forum on Oct. 8 will examine the ques­tion: 12 million undoeumented workers reside in the U.S. Should the government ignore them, help them, or deport them ...or offer a pathway to citizenship? 
Richman's views are dear. "Offer a path to citizenship," she said. "The government poli­cies are a failure. There need to be sensible policies, based on a rational understanding of how migration fits into our economy, and our society." 
Current policies, Riehman argued, have the perverse effect of forcing migrants to stay in the U.S. longer than they intended, and forcing them to bring their families along, because of the difficul­ties of going back and forth to visit. 
ND Press publishes Latino poetry winner 
Special to the Observer 

The University of Notre Dame Press has published "The Outer Bands," a first book of poetry by Gabriel Gomez, winner of the 2006 Andres Montoya Poetry Prize awarded by Notre Dame's Institute for Latino Studies (ILS). 
An expansive examination of language and landscape, voice and memory, where experimentation and tradi­tion coexist, the book fea­tures poems that realize a dialogue between two worlds that employ an equally paradoxical imagery of the American Southwest and the marshes of southern Louisiana. 
"The Outer Bands" con­cludes with its namesake poem, a 28-day chronicle of the period of time between Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which together deci­mated the Gulf Coast region in 2005. It is a re-contex­tualization of images, news stories and political rheto­ric that Gomez completed during a two-month emer­gency residency at the Santa Fe (N.M.) Art Institute after his home in New Orleans was destroyed. 
Also a playwright and music journalist, Gomez, who now Jives in Santa Fe, has taught English at the University of New Orleans, Tulane University, College of Santa Fe and the Institute of American Indian Arts. 
The Montoya Poetry Prize, which is the first of its kind in the United States, recog­nizes a full-length manu­script by a Latino/a poet who has yet to publish a book. It honors the late Andres Montoya, the author of the award-winning col­lection "The Ice Worker Sings" and the son of the renowned Chicano artist Malaquias Montoya, who was one of the first ILS fel­lows.

Monks lead march for democracy 
YANGON, Myanmar -The Buddhist monks and nuns gathered at a golden hilltop pagoda to lead 20,000 people in Myanmar's biggest anti-government protest in two decades. Plainclothes police trailed behind without intervening. 
But when a small crowd of about 400 peo­ple split off and headed for the house of pro­democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, security forces deployed in force to block them. 
The march raised both expectations of pos­sible political change and fear that the mili­tary might try to crush the demonstrations with violence, as it did in 1988 when thou­sands of pro-democracy protesters were killed nationwide. 
On Saturday, more than 500 monks and sympathizers were allowed past barricades to walk to the house where Suu Kyi is detained. The Nobel Peace laureate greeted them from her gate in her first public appearance in more than four years -a meeting that symbolically linked the current protests to her struggle for democracy. 
Israel releases Palestinian prisoners 
JERUSALEM -The Israeli Cabinet voted overwhelmingly on Sunday to release 90 Palestinian prisoners in an effort to shore up the moderate Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, in his power struggle with Islamic Hamas militants. 
But the size of the release disappointed the Palestinians at a time when the two sides are feverishly trying to move peace talks into high gear. 
A government spokeswoman said the pris­oners could be freed by Tuesday evening. 
Israel holds roughly 11,000 Palestinian prisoners, many imprisoned in the past seven years of conflict.

Jewell-Gill, 72, said having the document in Little Rock during the 50th anniversary of the desegregation of Central High School pulls history together. 
"I think it coincides beautifully," she said. 
More than 10,000 people are expected to file past the proclamation during its four­day stay in the city, a rare trip outside the National Archive. 
AIDS vaccine fails international test 
TRENTON -In a disappointing setback, a promising experimental AIDS vaccine failed to work in a large international test, leading the developer to halt the study. 
Merck & Co. said Friday that it is ending enrollment and vaccination of volunteers in the study, which was partly funded by the National Institutes of Health. 
It was a high-profile failure in the daunting quest to develop a vaccine to prevent AIDS. Merck's vaccine was the farthest along, con­sidered the most promising and was closely watched by experts in the field.

Blackwater tensions mount at U.N. 
Rice, al-Maliki refuse to discuss security firm's shootout in Baghdad at meeting 
Associated Press 
UNITED NATIONS Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki kept a polite distance Saturday as they attended a group meeting and avoided dis­cussion of a deadly Baghdad shootout involv­ing guards from a U.S. company protecting American diplomats. 
The two greeted each other before the meeting, but in a brief exchange of pleasantries, the issue of the shootout didn't come up, deputy State Department spokesman Tom Casey said. 
With tensions soaring over the Sept. 16 incident, Rice and al-Maliki chose not to speak about it at a United Nations gathering at which they were among senior diplomats and officials from Iraq's neighbors, including Iran and Syria, weighing future assistance to Iraq. 
Earlier, the State Department's Iraq coordi­nator, David Satterfield, said the two did not have any one-on-one contact. Satterfield testily told reporters that the issue of the incident was not on the agenda. He told reporters after the meet­ing that Rice had already spoken by phone with al­Maliki about the matter. 
The U.N. meeting came as a senior Iraqi official in Baghdad said Iraqi inves­tigators have a videotape that shows employees of Blackwater USA opening fire against civilians with­out provocation on Sept. 16. 
At the same time, Iraq's Interior Ministry said it had expanded its investi­gation of the shooting to include six other incidents involving Blackwater guards over the past seven months . 
The developments added to rising U.S.-Iraqi tensions, which shot up following last Sunday's shooting that killed at least 11 Iraqis, including civilians. 

Despite that, al-Maliki said before the session that he believed security was improving in Iraq and urged the United Nations to boost its presence in his country. 
"The security situation ... has begun to develop tremendously, and the Baghdad of today is dif­ferent from the Baghdad of yesterday," he said after a solo meeting with Ban. 
The presence of Rice and al-Maliki at the same meeting here was the closest high-level encounter between the governments since the incident and since Rice on Friday announced a full review of State Department security in Iraq. 
They precede a meeting between al-Maliki and President Bush next week on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly. 
The security review that Rice announced will examine the rules of engagement followed by security contractors as well as rules and regula­tions that govern their operations. That includes the jurisdiction in which contractors should be cov­ered and the immunity from prosecution by Iraqi and U.S. military courts that they now enjoy. 
A joint U.S.-Iraqi com­mission is also beginning to look at widely conflict­ing accounts of last week­end's incident; the first session was planned for Sunday. 
American witnesses have said the security guards were responding to an attack. Many Iraqi witnesses have told inves­tigators the shooting was unprovoked. The prime minister has called the incident a "crime" and his government has suggest­ed that the U.S. no longer use Blackwater for securi­ty. 
But the State Department relies heavily on private contractors to protect U.S. diplomats and other civilian U.S. government personnel in Iraq because it lacks the means to do so itself. 

CUBA 

Photo of Castro released in youth paper 
Associated Press 
HAVANA -Cuba published a photo Sunday of a standing, smiling Fidel Castro looking heavier but still gaunt as he met with Angola's president, the first head of state to see the ailing 81-year-old since June. 
The picture, which appeared on the front page of Communist Party youth newspaper Juventud Rebelde, shows Castro in a track suit, athletic pants and tennis shoes. The Cuban leader appears to have gained weight and wears a warm half-smile as he shakes hands with Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos, who was in Cuba since Thursday on an official visit. 
The image was released two days after Castro gave a surprise hour­long interview on state television, during which he answered rumors about his death that have swirled recently in the United States by say­ing simply, "well, here I am." 
Sunday's photo was the first time Castro has been seen standing in months. He stayed seated during the interview, which aired Friday evening just hours after officials said it was taped. 
Held in an undisclosed location, the meeting between Castro and Dos Santos reportedly took place Saturday afternoon and lasted an hour and 45 minutes. 
"I could see him recuperating," Dos Santos told Cuba's state news agency, Prensa Latina. "He's strong, with good enthusiasm." 
Castro has not appeared in public since announcing on July 31, 2006, that emergency intestinal surgery was forcing him to step down in favor of a provisional government headed by his 76-year-old brother, Raul.

'Occasional crises' 
"You know, universities are not quiet places," said Father Theodore Ilesburgh, who served as University president for 3!i years. "Every so often, students get carried away, gen­erally due to too much drink­ing. And that causes a erisis when it happens."

through tonight's vote -and it's largely because Council members say student parties have grown louder and messier in recent years. 
Associate Vice President for Hesidence Life Bill Kirk said the University has "consistently enforced" Notre Dame's stu­dent handbook, duLac, when violations happen off campus. 
"What has changed is the frequency of it," he said. 
But while Residence Life has received ''more reports" of incidents involving students off campus during the past few years, "there is some behavior that may not amount to a viola­tion of the law," Kirk said. 
Those problems, he said, are "dillicult for us to address if no police action" was taken. 
Though Notre Dame asks its students to be good neighbors off campus, Jenkins said, the University is limited in its con­trol. 
"There are expectations for students' behavior, it's pretty clear. I don't think any of our students are unsure about that," Jenkins said. "We can­not, obviously, police their behavior 24 hours a day, wher­ever they go. But we can work with others in a cooperative effort to address this situation, and I'm optimistic this is an opportunity to do so." 
A relationship in progress 
Council members said they were also optimistic about the chance to develop a closer relationship with Notre Dame. But they said the city needs continued input from University administrators.

EnS!land fears food disease outbreak 
LONDON-A new case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Britain Friday, the sixth such case in recent weeks, environment officials said. 
As a precaution, authorities had already begun slaughtering around 40 cows on the farm, which was inside a 2-mile protection zone set up around the latest reported cases in Surrey, south of London, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said. 
"Positive test results for foot-and-mouth dis­ease have now been confirmed at the site where it was decided that cattle should be slaughtered on suspicion earlier this evening," a spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity in line with department policy. 
Two new cases were detected in Surrey last week and government vets confirmed the dis­ease was the same strain found at three other locations where a foot-and-mouth outbreak began Aug. 3. 
Deal to buyout Harman cancelled 
WASHINGTON -Two private equity firms on Friday backed out of their $8 billion buy­out of upscale audio equipment maker Harman International Industries Inc., mark­ing the latest such deal to sour amid tighten­ing global credit conditions. 
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s private equity unit told the company they are under no obligation to complete the merger because "a material adverse change" in its business had occurred, Harman said in a statement. 
Harman, whose audio equipment brands include Infinity, JBL and Harman Kardon, said it disagreed, but did not make clear what action, if any, it would take. 
Investors punished the stock all day long as word dripped out that KKR and GS Capital Partners were attempting to nullify the deal. By the end of the day, Harman shares had plummeted by more than 24 per­cent.

Students will also have the opportunity to win cash prizes in a video competition. Glen Water, the video contest coordinator, said the best 30 second and two-minute submissions that "motivate and inform viewers" about environ­mentalism will win at least $100, though he hopes to raise enough money to offer $500 prizes. 
Water said the main obstacles to environmental goals on campus are that students do not know what they could do to help the enviromnent -or even why they should. 
"I was inspired by a seminar offered by the Center for Social Concerns over spring break, Energy and the Enviromnent," he said. 
Water called the course, which had only 12 students, "life-chang­ing" and hoped that the video competition would offer the same experience to a campus-wide audience. 
Junior Jon Poelhuis said that he might be interested in watching some of the videos, particularly if they were funny. 
He said that An Inconvenient Truth, AI Gore's Oscar-winning documentary, "got people talking" about environmental issues. An Inconvenient Truth will be one of the enviromnentally themed films screened on campus during Energy Week.

lETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Hate is hate, 
no matter 




what color 

I was deeply disheartened to read that Liz Brown openly supports the Jena Six protests this Thursday. For our student government to openly support the brutal, racially-motivated beating of a high school student is inexcusable. Don't get me wrong. The three whitP students who hung threP nooses under the "white tree" at .Jena High School engaged in despicable and cowardly behavior, and ought to have been punished to the fullest extent of' the law. There is no excuse for racial hatred. especially when it is displayed in a threatening manner. Americans should be working to promote racial equality and fair treatment for all, both in the legal system and in society at large. 
But since when do African-Americans get a pass on promoting good race relations'! When six black students jump a white student and beat him so badly he ends up in the emergency room, isn't that crime also racially motivated and cowardly? If it went unpunished, wouldn't white students feel threatened? 
Whether racial violence is perpetrated by white people or by black people, it ought to be punished as harshly as possible. Hate is still hate, no matter what the color of your skin. The Jena Six deserve to go to prison for what they did, but I'm all for a protest to prosecute the noose-incident perpetra­tors.

Easy access to rncyding is needed at cam­pus-wide events and on game days as well. during which large numbers of people throw things away. 
Initiatives for dorms to recycle should also be considerod, due to the abundance of aluminum cans that end up in the garbago evory weekend. 
A serious efl'ort to take advantage of green archite<:tun on campus must also be made. Grm1n arehiteeturn is dostined to become a very prof­itable industry in the corning years. Why not savn the world and gnt rich at the same time? Not only should this field of study bn taknn seriously within our amazing ArchitneturP program. but every new structurP that is built on campus should b11 constructed using gronn architoeturn stan­dards. 
Plenty more action can and should be taken on this campus to get up to date with the changing world and tmact our moral obligations as rt~spon­sible Catholics. We need to start by changing our mindset as a university and by realizing that all of our actions have consequences within God's Kingdom.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Debate over role of University's Catholicism. continues 
Notre Dame more than just Catholic 
Lately there has been a lot of talk about just how Catholic Notre Dame is and what constitutes being OK in the realms of the mis­sion of Notre Dame (i.e. the debates over the CIA and Haytheon, and Greg Yatarola's arti­cle ["ND's Catholic-don't be surprised," Sept. 18)). I think that it's good to have differ­ing opinions about different things, but I also think that it's pretty clear what Notre Dame stands for. 
Notre Dame always has been and will be Catholic: From our founders to the recent goals of our current president, you can easily soe that the Catholic tradition will always be a part of Notre Dame. Notre Dame has grown from its days in 1842, and is now a great uni­versity filled with students from varying reli­gious and cultural backgrounds. 
Notre Dame isn't just Catholic. If you dido 't catch the word "varying" when I talked about the students here, let me reiterate: The religious and cultural diversity here is essen­tial for the university's growth. It helps open all our eyes to dill'erent ideas and perspec­tives. Therefore, you will find people who will bn for and against many different issues fac-
Use moral values to analyze society 
God, Country, Notre Dame. When Nic Ponzio ("Keep the career fair unrestricted," Sept. 20) writes of that phrase as an ideal "embedded into our minds," he fails to really consider its implications. Notre Dame is a university dedicated to the pursuit of knowl­edge and truth in the world. Notre Dame is a Catholic university and thus brings into this search a dimension of faith -faith in God, human dignity and justice. 
In his autobiography, 'God, Country, Notre Dame,' Father Ted Hesburgh, clearly shows that the purpose of this university is to criti­cally engage the great questions in society. In doing so, we are to apply our knowledge in service beyond Notre Dame. This sense of principle is behind that tripartite phrase, with the word "country" not meaning a blind support of U.S. policies, but rather a respon­sibility for the greater society, extending beyond our nation and across the world. 
ing the University. 
From Mr. Angulo to Mr. Ponzio and Mr. Clary about the CIA and Raytheon debate, there are pints of merit which each of them brings up. Then, between Mr. Yatarola and Miss Williams there are valid points about Catholicism at the University. But I don't think any singular idea is completely right. What they all do is bring more to the table of these debates, and ifthe University pays attention to these Viewpoint articles and let­ters, I think they would have to at least rethink some of the things that each person points out as there are many people passion­ate about these ideas. 
However, I think that the character here at Notre Dame goes beyond all of these extreme ideas. Yes, it is Catholic, but it's about being more than just Catholic or just conservative -it's about being a family and opening our eyes and arms to the different ideas each of us has and are a part of who each of us are. 
Amanda Bell junior McGlinn Hall Sept. 23 

We fail as students if we accept information without critically evaluating it in light of our values. We cannot, as Mr. Ponzio does, equate criticizing unjust government policies with failing to support our troops. To ques­tion whether actions of the CIA and Raytheon are morally objectionable enough to discon­tinue their presence at the career fair is exactly what students should do. We should question. If we fail to use our intellect and values to critically engage society's problems, we are not living the university's purpose. I have asked myself these difficult questions, and as a concerned student, I do think we should consider any university affiliation with agencies and corporations in light of their actions. 
Brennan Bollman junior Lewis Hall Sept. 20 

Understand, don't dismiss 
I must admit being a little puz­zled by Stacey Williams's Letter to the Editor ("Catholic character more complex," Sept. 20). She seemed to posit that Notre Dame's Catholicity is unknow­able, irrelevant and damaging all at the same time -quite an accomplishment for nothing more than the subject of a "tired debate." But the letter only demonstrates that its writer doesn't understand Catholicism, not that the rest of us can't or shouldn't. 
The Jetter's closing exhortation to "make Notre Dame a better place, Catholic or not," demon­strates a complete lack of under­standing not only of the Church, but of the dictates of reason. English author G.K. Chesterton once observed, "The difficulty of explaining why I am a Catholic, is that there are 10,000 reasons all amounting to one reason: That Catholicism is true." This is what Catholics have always believed about the Church, put into colloquial terms. Of course, you can accept or reject this assertion, or perhaps claim an inadequate basis for assessment, but it defies reason to say that you are ambivalent about it. If you work to improve something, you must as a matter of course do so in a manner that reflects and attempts to conform to the truth, to reality. Saying otherwise is akin to arguing that parents should help their children stay healthy by lacing their dinners with arsenic. The action simply doesn't comport with the reali­ties governing the situation. 
So maybe Catholicism is true, and maybe it is false -but does it have anything to do with a uni­versity? History and reason tend to suggest it does: The Church invented universities, and Catholicism has great impact on the way one seeks and utilizes knowledge. This last observation makes the question of Catholicism relevant regardless of whether you regard it as true or false. On the one hand, it rep­resents a necessary component to the work of education; on the other, it should be extirpated as an impediment to intellectual activity (unless it is somehow possible to improve academic endeavors by framing them with­in the context of a very big lie). 
It also does not suffice to argue that Catholicism is simply unknowable or amorphously unquantifiable. No, the magis­terium doesn't speak authorita­tively on how to structure a Board of Trustees. If you regard this silence as making Catholicism irrelevant, you're probably misconstruing Catholicism as an ideology rather than a way of life. Ideologies answer little problems; Catholicism answers big prob­lems in a way that allows us to reason through (and sometimes disagree over) many small ones. It is the stable that contains the entire universe. 
So if we are going to disagree, that's fine -this is a university. But let's first be honest about the nature and terms of the debate, because standing up to say that the whole question doesn't mat­ter boils down to little more than a thinly veiled attempt to stave off criticism of one's own posi­tion. And you don't have to be Catholic to recognize that as intellectually dishonest.

Growing up within a com.fortable reality 
My Monday morning began like most in my college career. I woke to my alarm, showered and sat down at my computer while waiting to eat breakfast. I opened up Gmail and noticed another pesky "Inside Clemson" e-mail cluttering my inbox. Deciding it couldn't hurt to read the thing for a change, I double­

believing what I was reading. A girl 
Tiger
had been kidnapped on campus, forced to drive to an ATM and with­draw hundreds of dollars and driven back to a location on campus where her assailer could find time to escape. The man ran and was eventually caught after CUPD had time to search the area. 
To me, this horrible event represents something that I'm finding more and more frequent as I grow older: That horrible kidnapping and strong-arm robbery rep­resent yet another brush with the uncomfortable reality of being an adult. Now, before you begin thinking that I spend most of my time hopped up on LSD in an alter­nate dimension, I'd like to clear up this concept of reali­ty. To be honest, I still view myself and my friends as a bunch of kids having a good time, and I still expect that my parents will be able to take care of the big problems I have in my life. However, it seems I somewhere made the passage to manhood without even noticing. 
In the grand scheme of things, I'd never really thought of myself as an adult. I figured when I became an adult, it would be marked with fanfare, celebration and a cake in my honor. Instead, I've discovered that the passage to adulthood is marked not with momentous events but instead little, itty-bitty reminders of your age. The steps are small. They begin with simple things, such as an allowance that you get as a 5-year-old for doing chores. You vacuum the living room and mop the kitchen floor, and your parents reward you with five dollars and a pat on the back. 
As you grow older, the steps grow larger. You get a cell phone, your driver's license, and you probably find yourself facing the daunting task of applying for college. Eventually you might find yourself in a serious relation­ship, talking about politics over coffee and wondering where the time went. Unfortunately, this passage to adulthood isn't marked with something that I think many people in this world could do with (myself includ­ed I'm sure). The passage into adulthood, in my opinion, should be marked with a maturity test. Personally, I think a lot of problems in this world could be fiXed with a simple test. In my mind, the test would be nothing more than a series of situations designed to determine whether you can handle living in the real world with the rest of us. 
The first, easiest and most important test of all would be designed to test patterns of abuse. In this test, you have a cute, fuzzy puppy placed before you. If you pet or play with the puppy, you pass the test. If you kick, eat, or in other ways mutilate the puppy, you don't. It's sim­ple. 
The second test would be designed to test morality. We set up a situation where an old lady drops twenty bucks and a pack of gum. Ifyou return the money and the gum, you're deemed relatively competent to subsist in normal society. If not, well, perhaps we can just stick you in prison for a few years and let you sort things out. 
The final test is a bit more complicated. The test is designed to measure your ability to act appropriately in social situations. A stand-in spouse steps before you. The spouse is told to make a mistake, and observers watch closely as you are forced to deal with the mis­take. If you scream at, beat, or in other ways abuse the stand-in spouse, you are not permitted back to society with the rest of us. 
OK. so in all honesty, the idea of a maturity test is as ridiculous as these problems seem. How could anyone in their right mind possibly abuse a spouse, hit a child or steal another person's money? Why do people feel such strong feelings of hate that they decide to kill another person? While we can't possibly give this test and hope for it to yield any real results, the simple fact that these problems exist is enough for us to search for a solution. While we can't possibly crack down on all of these problems, we as college students are still given a burden to bear. 
It is important to find new means of counseling that help these people turn from their abusive and destruc­tive ways. It is important to learn to recognize when problems are coming. Most importantly, however, we must realize that the comfortable reality we live on inside the campus dorms or apartments is something that the real world doesn't care about. We must grow up; we must become adults; we must find a way of deal­ing with this very real, very scary reality we have creat­ed.

Eric Hutchinson? 
Quite a lot, aetually. Earlier this month, Hilton posted a link and some fervent commentary on his site about Hutchinson's album, "Sounds Like This." It seems like Hilton's readers agree with his opinion -within days, Hutchinson had reached No. 5 on the iTunes best-sellers chart without even having a record label. Surprisingly, the instantaneous success was well deserved. 
"Sounds Like This," released a little under a month ago, boasts a great col­lection of well-learned music. While 
Hutchinson's sound is a new and modern mix of pop and soul, his musi­cal influences -the prime of pop's days gone by -are quite evident. The melodies are easy to pick up. sticking with listeners long past the end of each track. Hutchinson's lyrics catch you by surprise, though, at every changing line. 
The songs "Hock & Holl" and "Food Chain" are Hutchinson's best example of this. At first they seem innocent, in a 

guilty pleasure for teens. 
Drama swarms the lives of pristine prep-school teens on Upper East Side, and all of the inside dirt is revealed through the all-knowing narrator of the show. Gossip Girl (Kristen Bell). Gossip (;irl's identity is unknown, but she blogs thn latnst news on her Web site and texts vital information to the student body, keeping all the characters in the show connected. Gossiping, shopping and partying arn what the young heart­throbs do best, giving past "O.C." fans nxartly what tlwy've been longing for. 
Black l.ivdy plays tlw main character, Sernna van der Woodson. In the pre­miern, Sen~na returns to Manhattan from boarding school aftnr exiling hnr­
snlf from hnr fri<mds for unknown reasons -a movn that crnated chaos in thn otlwrwisn privi­lngnd hottins' livns. Snrnna's "best friend," Blair Waldorf ( Lnighton M<H'sterl. hates that Snrena has rnturnod, and tries everything shn can to keep lwr dis­tance. Part or her angnr comns from the faet that hnr studly longtime boyfriend, Natn (Chace Crawford I. has an obvi-Jason Mraz-type way, but the songs' meanings are much more pleasurable than banana pancakes His lyrics are well thought out and meticulously placed, and they are packed with Hutchinson's personal sarcasm and wit. Once his listeners realize this, they instantly feel a c'onnection to Hutchinson. More than just feeling his passion for music, they can get to know his personality and sense of humor. 

Though "soul" might best describe Hutchinson's style, "Sounds Like This" works for anyone, anywhere -it is a great on-the-go track list. This is a rare occurrence for any artist's first full­length album, but Hutchinson pulls it off with the strong emotion of his tracks. 
Even more than the emotion, though, Hutchinson is bringing something new to the scene. Not just another singer­songwriter in his twenties strumming his guitar and banking on his green eyes, Hutchinson shines because of his strong, soulful influences. "You Don't Have to Believe Me" particularly echoes classic 1970s soul music. Hutchinson's simple melodies and cleverly catchy lyrics, though, are what really make this album stand out among the multitude of other talented artists. 
Hutchinson mixes guitar, piano, other vocals and more to aehieve a diverse 
ous attraction for and a secret past with Serena. 
Adding to the complex circle is the "bad boy" of tho bunch, Nate's friend Chuck (Ed Westwick). who scams on girls with his wealth and power and pushes Nate to do the same. The softer characters of the show are Dan (Penn Badgleyl and his younger sister Jenny (Taylor sound. This makes the tracks layered and much more exdting to list because they don't get repetitive too quickly. Somfl describe Hutchinson's style as "intelligent pop," and while this is lov­able pop music, the instruments and vocals are layered and the music attains a certain depth that fnw pop artists achieve. 
The album starts off with thfl sugar­coated "Ok, It's Alright With Me," an instant pick-me-up tune filled with anec­dotes of silly Jove and everyday occur­renees. Just as Hutchinson gives listen­ers a taste of his humor within his lyrics, each of the tracks tells some personal story. 
While each song is unique and lovable, the last two traeks of tho album become a bit tedious. They slow the album's pace, causing listeners to start losing the interest that the liveliness of earlier traeks held. But, given that "Sounds Like This" is Hutchinson's first album, some blips and errors arfl almost expected.

Michigan State defeats Notre Dame 31-17; Irish fall to 0-4 for first time ever 
By FRAN TOLAN Sports Writer 
Notre Dame's anemic offense showed some signs of life, but its defense crumbled late, Michigan State won 31-14 and the Irish fell to 0-4 for the first time in program history. 
The Notre Dame running back tandem of sophomore James Aldridge and freshman Robert Hughes ran for a combined 144 yards, but Michigan State coun­tered with a more formidable two-headed rushing monster of its own and downed the Irish 31-14 at Notre Dame Stadium Saturday.

then when they did hit Spartan running 
backs Jehuu Caulerick or Javon 
Hinger, they were driven backwards for an extra three yards. 
"It wasn't so much their athletic ability as we didn't do our job," Irish nose guard Pat Kuntz said. 
Notre Dame managed 117 yards on the ground, a major improvement over previous games, but on multiple occasions the Irish had third or fourth-and-one and could not pick up the first down. On one possession, they had two plays to get less than a yard and couldn't do it. 
Why is this happening? Every member of the offensive line was a highly regarded recruit, and while the defensive linemen weren't quite as sought after, they still have talent. 
The problem doesn't seem to be the defenders. effort. The players are clearly going Similarly, the defense has been all-out on the field, and they seeni very efl'ective at stringing outside

the Irish defensive line is undersized and not quick enough on the outside to run the 3-4. 
But those schemes can both work and will work once the current play­ers get older and next year's recruit­ing class comes in -they can't be blamed for the lack of fundamental physicality. 
Notre Dame also has problems 
with technique. Tacklers hit too high and get driven back­wards. Blockers, 
push them, rather 
than engaging and 
driving them back­
wards. 
What really seems to be the under­lying issue is the lack of hitting in Irish practices. Weis has started to correct this in the past week, but the fact that the team didn't hit in fall camp has set Notre Dame back weeks -and possibly years. 
It's clear the Irish know their play­book well. Take for instance screen passes. Almost every time Notre Dame has run one this year, the defensive line has been fooled and a back -usually Armando Allen -has caught the ball with more blockers than tacklers in front of him. 
But those plays are rarely getting more than five yards because the blockers in front don't actually block Even special teams 
has been hurt by this lack of physicality. On returns, wedges set up beautifully, then col­lapse. On coverage, returners are hemmed in, then suddenly find a way upfield. 
The simple fact is that Irish players know who to block and know where they need to bn to make a tackle, but when they get there-they can't make the play. 
Fortunately, Weis knows the only way to fix this is to practice blocking and tackling. And basnd on the Michigan State game, there has been improvement since Notre Dame went "back to training camp." 
After the loss to the Spartans, ofl'ensive taekle Sam Young said the Irish were "on their way" to the proper bloeking and tackling. 
"We want to be thern as fast as possible," he said. 
The problem is that the Irish should have "been there" before Georgia Tech. But 0-4 is the reality they have to live with, and it's time to start hitting people like a Division l team should. 
Sometimes, football really isn't that complicated. Winning is all about blocking and tackling. 
Notre Dame isn't doing those things right now. And until they do, they won't start winning.

The only complaint with the presentation of the film is the animation. Something about the character models feels slightly off. but viewers can't expect everything in a direct-to-video film to be perfect. 

The main problem with this movie is its targeting strategy. 
It's rated PG-13 and has some very mature themes. Logic would lead one to believe that this movie would be targeted at a more mature audience -an audi­ence, like college students, that read the comics growing up. 
There are, however, too many discrep­ancies between the comic's original story­line and the film adaptation. It simply tries to accomplish too much in its 75 minute running time.

Associated Press 
CLEVELAND -From shoveling snow to spraying champagne. 
The Cleveland Indians, who slipped and slid around April's home open­er during a freakish spring storm, capped an unforget­table season at Jacobs Field on Sunday with a sun-soaked championship. 
Jake Westbrook struck out a career-high nine and Grady Sizemore had four hits as the Indians, fourth­place finishers a year ago, elinched their first AL Central title. since 2001 with a 6-2 win over the Oakland Athletics. 
The Indians became the second team in the majors to clinch. The Boston Red Sox assured themselves of at least the AL wild-card spot Saturday night. 
When reliever Rafael Betancourt struck out Oakland's Mark Ellis for the final out and his second save, the crowd of 40,250 erupted as one and the right-han·der jumped into catcher Victor Martinez's arms as the Indians poured onto the infield to cele­brate. 
Moments latnr, led by ace 
C.C. Sabathia, the club walked to center field and watched as a 2007 champi­onship banner was hoisted atop the center-field score­board. 
IN BRIEF 
Melee erupts over victory
celebration 
GREENSBORO, N.C. -Moments after North Carolina Central claimed victory over rival North Carolina A&T, the Eagle players decided on a celebra­tion that would lead to a bench-clear­ing, helmet-swinging brawl. 
The fight so enraged A&T athletics director DeLores "Dee" Todd that she said the two schools likely would take a "cooling-off period" from continuing the series. 
''I'm disgusted. It's very disgusting," Todd told The News & Observer of Raleigh after seeing the Eagles players jump on the Aggies' midfield logo. "It's a game, why do that?" 
The fight lasted several minutes and left dozens of players lying on the field. Police from both schools ran in after several minutes and broke up the fight using pepper spray. An NCCU player lay on the ground outside of the locker room vomiting after the fight as train­ers worked feverishly to wash his eyes. 
Overlooked as a con­tender in one of baseball's toughest divisions, the Indians overcame a strange start and recaptured a crown they won six times in seven years from 1995­2001. 
But for these Indians, lit­tle went as planned. 
Their first homestand in April was postponed by snow, forGing the club to play three "home" games in Milwaukee's Miller Park against the Los Angeles Angels. Three other games against Seattle were made up at the Jake. 
Technically, Cleveland still has one "home" game remaining on Wednesday, 2,000 miles 
Landis stripped of Tour de 
France title 
MONTREAL -Floyd Landis' defense that his drug tests weren't handled properly doesn't negatf) the findings, World Anti-Doping Agency chairman Dick Pound said Sunday. 
Pound said that despite Landis' contention that the test procedures were less than perfect, there was no escaping the fact that banned sub­stances were found. 
By a 2-1 decision Thursday, an arbitration panel upheld Landis' pos­itive doping test from the 2006 Tour de France. The decision means Landis is no longer the race champi­on and faces a two-year ban from cycling, retroactive to Jan. 30. 
In its 84-page decision, the majori­ty found the initial screening test to measure Landis' testosterone levels -the testosterone-to-epitestos­terone test -was not done accord­ing to World Anti-Doping Agency rules. 
away at Seattle's Safeco Field as part of a double­header with the Mariners. 
The Indians, who finished 18 games behind Detroit last year, began 2007 with question marks around the diamond. They moved into first place on Aug. 15, stayed there by going 27-9 and running away from the defending AL champion Tigers, and now have a chance to finish with the best record in the majors. 
And while much of their lineup looks as it did in April, the Indians made some major changes to snap them out of a midsea­son slump that threatened to spoil a season filled with thrilling comebacks. 
Roddick leads U.S. to Davis 
Cup finals 
GOTEBORG, Sweden -Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe couldn't beat Sweden in the Davis Cup in this city 23 years ago. Andy Roddick delivered this weekend. 
Behind a roaring serve, Roddick defeated Jonas Bjorkman 6-2, 7-6 (3), 6-4 Sunday in a clinching vic­tory over Sweden that carried the United States into the finals. 
The U.S. will play defending champion Russia for the title Nov. 30-Dec. 3, with the Americans hosting the finals for the first time since 1992. Russia defeated Germany 3-2 in the other semifi­nal in Moscow. 
Roddick didn't drop serve in two singles matches, winning both in straight sets as the Americans ended a three-match losing streak against the Swedes dating to 1984.

MLB 
Washington plays final game at RFK 
Associated Press 
WASJIINGTON -It was a day for a bit of nostalgia at the ol' ballpark. Well, for some people, anyway. 
The fans sure turned out Sunday to say goodbye for the season to the Washington Nationals and goodbye forever­when it comes to baseball, at least -to RFK Stadium, with an attendance of 40,519 making it the team's largest crowd of 2007. 
And when D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty, backed by a group of city council members, called for a pregame round of applause for the stadium, the spectators obliged, loudly. 
The players, however, did not. They're thrilled to be going from a leaking, creaking place that opened in 1961 to a new stadium slated to open in 2008. 
''I'm not going to say we're going to miss it, because we won't," third baseman Ryan Zimmerman said before Washington beat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-3 in the Nationals' last home game of the season. "But it's been a great place for baseball to come back to. They did a great job with what they had here to make it, I guess, as good as they could for three years." 
This was a day to say farewell to the park originally called D.C. Stadium, then renamed in 1969 to honor the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. A multipurpose stadium, it hosted baseball's Senators until 1971 and football's Hedskins until 1996. 
And it was the first home of the Nationals. who brought baseball back to Washington in 2005, sharing the place with Major League Soccer's D.C. United, which will continue to play at HFK. 
The Nationals went 122-121 at home the past three seasons, and lirst baseman Hobert Fiek called Sunday's victory "some kind of going away gift or something that Ifans] can take with them." 
Indeed, whatever complaints players or spectators might have

about the stadium, it was a site for sore eyes when the ex-Expos moved from Montreal. Nationals rookie manager Manny Acta, who was given a model replica of RFK by one of the team's owners, won't forget the place, either. 
"It's always going to be a spe­cial place for me," Acta said, "because regardless of whatever I do or how long I'm going to stay on this earth, this was my first big league managing home." 
He and players noticed and appreciated the larger-than­usual crowd. The Nationals aver­aged 24,217 fans this year, down from 33,728 in Year 1, and 26,581 in Year 2. 
"I really, really wanted to win bad today," Acta said. 
Did he sense that a farewell victory Sunday matters to the fans? 
"It does. I could tell," he said. "Because all these people didn't show up to every game. Today was a very special day for them." 
Seven former Senators took part in pregame festivities, walk­ing out on the field alongside Nationals. The loudest ovation was for Frank Howard, the face of the Senators, who walked out to third base alongside Zimmerman, the face of the Nationals. 
Standing on the infield dirt, Howard took a mock swing, drawing even bigger cheers. He was the slugger responsible for hitting balls so far that seats were painted white in the upper deck to mark where his homers landed. Zimmerman put one up in that section, too, and the stair his shot hit was recently painted red. 
The past and present of D.C. baseball talked shop for a bit. 
"He's a big guy. You don't really realize how big he is," Zimmerman said. "Now I can kind of believe those white seats a little bit more." 
Zimmerman knows what RFK meant to loeal baseball fans, and what it meant to players who were with the Expos when they played before sparse crowds in Montreal and were forced to travel to Puerto Hico for "home" games. 
He also is well aware what Nationals Park-or whatever it will be called once naming rights are sold -will mean. · 
"Not only is it going to be bet­ter for us, but it is going to be better for the fans. That's the bottom line. It's going to take our organization to the next level," said Zimmerman, who has visit­ed the still-in-progress new place. "Everything's so much nicer. So we're going from, well, l don't know if this is the worst in the majors, but it's pretty bad, to one of the best." 
On Sept. 30, 1971, when the Senators played their last game at RFK before leaving for Texas, spectators stormed the field dur­ing the ninth inning to rip out chunks of grass or bases. The game was declared a forfeit. 
No such problems this time, although Bob Short, the owner of those Senators, was not forgotten Sunday: Someone unfurled thrf)e long banners that read, "Short Still Stinks." And there was prop­erty removed again, although this time it was supposed to go: Acta helped Nationals owner Ted Lerner dig out home plate, which will be moved to the new ball­park.

MLB-AL EAST 

Joba saves Yankees win, New York 1.5 games back 
Wakefield struggles in loss to Tampa Bay 
Associated l'ress 
NEW YOHK -Joba Hules 
were made to be broken. 
Toronto was threatening in the 
eighth inning, pulling within two 
runs and putting two men on. 
Even though Yankees manager 
Jon Torre had said Joba 
Chamberlain was unavailable, 
the sellout crowd of 54,983 
started chanting "We Want 
.loba!" ' 
Chamberlain jogged in from 
the bullpen on his 22nd birth­
day, threw five nasty sliders to 
strike out Adam Lind, then fol­
lowed with a perfeet ninth 
inning. With his first major 
league save, the rookie sensa­
tion preserved New York's 7-5 
victory over the Blue Jays and 
Mike Mussina's 250th big league 
win. 
llarlan Chamberlain, the relieVf1r's polio-stricken father, watched from his motorized scooter and remembored back to his newborn son's bassinet at Saint Elizabeth Hegional Medical Center in Lincoln. Neb. 
"Twenty-two years ago today, I put a glow1 with a Velero ball in the palm of the glove," he said. "If that glove could have spelled out the futun1 and said 22 years from today, you'll be in Yankee Stadium, I would have thought that was the furthHst thing that could ever happen," he said. 

New York, close to clinching its 13th consecutive playoff appearance, pulled within 1.5 games of AL East-leading Boston with a week remaining in the regular season. The Yankees overcame a 3-0 deficit and reached 90 wins for the seventh straight year, the third-longest streak in major league history behind thf1 194 7-58 Yankees and 1904-12 Chicago Cubs, accord­ing to the Elias Sports Bureau. 
Mussina (11-10) won his thi'rd straight start since rejoining the rotation; backup catcher Jose Molina had three hits, three HBis, a key tag play and a big pickoff; and Melky Cabrera thww out a runner at the plate for the second straight day, rais­ing his assists total for the sea­son to 16 -including a major league-leading 14 as a center fielder. 
But the electricity was provid­ed by Chamberlain, who has allowed one earned run in 16 appearances since coming up from the minors in early August. 
With a 100 mph fastball and a 92 mph slider that drops at the plate like an Olympic diver, he's been unhittable most days. The Yankees have babied him -the Joba Hules stated he could only enter at tho start of innings, he could warm up only once and that he would get at least one day ol'f for every inning he threw. It was as if New York had an nlixir it didn't want to dis­pensn too frequently. 
lie had gone two innings and 30 pitches Friday night. But before Sunday's game, Torre spoke with general manager Brian Cashman and pitching instructor Nardi Contreras to clarify the amendments they all discussed during a conference call Friday. 
Devil Rays 5, Red Sox 4 

Tim Wakefield is still strug­gling, and the AL East race is up for grabs with a week remaining in the regular season. 
Wakefield gave up a two-run homer to Delmon Young and Boston lost to the Tampa Bay Devil Hays on Sunday, cutting its division lead to 1.5 games over the New York Yankees. 
"It couldn't have come at a worse time," Wakefield said about his first defeat at Tropicana Field. "We're in the postseason, but our main goal is try to win the division." 
The Bed Sox clinched at least the wild-card spot Saturday, but they're having a hard time hold­ing oil' New York despite build­ing a 14?-game cushion early in the season. The Yankees beat Toronto 7-5 on Sunday. 
Boston is off Monday before playing its final six games of the season at home, two against Oakland and four against Minnesota. 
New York hosts the Blue Jays again Monday before finishing up with six road games, three at Tampa Bay and three against Baltimore. 
The Yankees, who trail Boston by one in the loss column, are close to clinching at least the wild card as well. If the teams finish with the same record and both qualify for the playoffs, New York will win the division because it won the season series 10-8. 
The Hed Sox are looking for their first AL East title since 1995. The Yankees have won nine consecutive division crowns, beginning in 1998. 
Wakelield (16-12) entered 9-0 at Tropicana Field and 19-2 overall against the Devil Rays, but the knuc~leballer gave up four runs and seven hits in five innings. 
"I felt fine today," Wakefield said. "llad good movement on my pitches. l just made one mis­take to Delman Young. Other than that, they did a good job of scraping some hits together in the holes." 
In his past four starts, the right-hander has allowed 21 runs over 17 2-3 innings. The four outings have come after he missed a start with a sore back. 
"I thought his ball was bounc­ing, moving," Hed Sox manager Terry Francona said. "I thought he limited damage. A lot of pitches for live innings, but he pitched pretty good." 
Wakefield threw 95 pitches. 

Young put the Devil Hays up 2­0 with his horner in the second. The rookin right fielder, who had been 1-for-14 against Wakefield, has 13 homers and 93 HBis this season.

Brazil won its quarterfinal Sunday at the Women's World Cup, defeating Australia 3-2 on Cristiane's goal in the 75th minute, a rising drive from 20 yards off rapid-fire passes from Marta and Daniela. 
The Americans have ambi­tions for a third World Cup title, following ones in 1991 and '99. Brazil is in the semifi­nals for the second time, matching its run in 1999. 
"I believe finally we will add one more star on our jersey," Daniela said, a reference to the men's team, which has won a record five World Cups. "We will finally get the World Cup." 
The Americans. top-ranked and undefeated in 51 games, advanced Saturday by beating England 3-0 on goals by Abby Wambach, Shannon Boxx and captain Kristine Lilly. 
Germany defeated North Korea 3-0 that day, putting the defending champions into a Wednesday semifinal with Norway in Beijing's neighbor­ing city of Tianjin. Three for­mer champions will be playing in the final four. 
Norway defeated host China 1-0 on Sunday in Wuhan before a crowd of 52,000 that stayed until the end, waving flags and lighting flares as the Chinese made a last offensive push. 
Brazil figures to be quick and tricky Thursday when it meets the Americans in Hangzhou, the last step to the final Sunday in Shanghai. 
The U.S. defeated Brazil 2-0 three months ago in New York, a physical game played with­out Marta. The Americans also defeated Brazil in the 2004 Olympic final -2-1 in extra time -and 2-0 in a group game in the Olympics. 
"Brazil's primary tactic was fouling us to break our rhythm." Ryan said, referring to the game three months ago. "We had more of the ball, and their response to that was just to foul. Brazil has tried to break our rhythm by chopping our players down." 
"The last time we played Brazil, they didn't even try to play football -they just kicked us from behind," Ryan added. 
Still, Ryan is fully aware that Brazil can play. The women, in some respects, mirror the style of the famed men's teams led over the years by Rivaldo, Ronaldo and Ronaldinho. They also go by a single name, fash­ioning goals by duping defend­ers with backheel passes and start-and-stop fakes while hov­ering over the ball. 
'Tm going to do whatever I can to request that we get a referee who understands the difference between a reckless foul and a hard challenge," Ryan said, a former defender himself in the now-defunct NASL. 
Marta is the 2006 women's world player of the year, and the rest of the lineup isn't far behind with striker Cristiane and other up-front players like Daniela, Formiga and Maycon. 
"They are all very creative," said U.S. defender Stephanie Lopez, who played against Brazil in New York. "Sometimes it's not very tradi­tional, but it's very effective. Their offense is very special." 
The Americans' best result of the tournament came against an England team that might have been weaker than any of the other squads in the U.S. group -North Korea, Sweden and Nigeria. The game turned on three goals in 12 minutes early in the second half. 
"I think we've got another gear," Ryan said. "The concern isn't peaking; the concern is winning the next game. I think they can play even better but whether we see it or not just depends on the game, our opponent." 
The United States is unde­feated in 51 games, winning mostly in this tournament with defense, set plays and four goals from striker Abby Wambach. 
"Every game we've been ris­ing and rising," Boxx said. "We've defended so well in this tournament and now the pos­session part is coming."

"They're very athletic as a team," Waldrum said of Penn State. "But they're a good team, and they're the kind of team that c<~n puni~h you when you make mistakes. 
Despite the loss, Notre Dame played up to the level of its oppo­nents. Most of its passes were crisp and on-target, and the Irish had mom pati1mee when creating ollfmsive possessions. Waldrum saw improvement but was still unhappy with their perlorm<mce. 
"I thought today we had periods of being good, but it's the same things that caught up to us in the second half," he said. "It's the same mistakes that we've been making."

Stasiuk helps lead Irish to weekend series split 

Senior libero now fifth place in career digs in Notre Dame's history 
By PAT O'BRIEN Sports Writer 
Notre Dame lost its Big East opener Saturday against Pittsburgh in four tough games but rebounded to beat West Virginia the next day in Morgantown. 
The Irish forced every losing game against the Panthers into extra points in the 3-1 (33-31, 32-30, 23-30, 42-40) loss. 
The fourth game included 27 
ties and 15 lead changes ­ and  
82  points between the  two  
teams.  

Irish senior Adrianna Stasiuk, starting the game at the libero position, tied her season best with 21 digs to go along with 14 kills. Freshman middle blocker Kellie Sciacca and sophomore outside hitter Serinity Phillips also added 14 kills each. Senior setter Ashley Tarutis paced the Irish with 45 assists and sopho­more setter Jamel Nicholas added 21 helpers of her own. 
Junior outside hitter Kelly Campbell's 30 kills led the Panthers offense. Senior outside hitter Diana Andreyko also played a major role in Pittsburgh's win, with 21 kills and 19 digs. Junior setter Nicole Taurence paced the Panthers with 4 7 assists; she also added nine digs. 
The Irish (5-7, 1-1) beat West Virginia 3-1 (30-19, 23-30, 30­27, 30-27) Sunday. 
The game against the Mountaineers saw Stasiuk climb to fifth in career digs in Notre Dame history. She recorded 17 in another start at libero to put her total at 1 ,268. 
But Phillips and Tarutis were the stars in the match. Phillips recorded a career-high and 23 kills and 11 digs, while Tarutis aided the effort with 44 assists, 13 digs and six kills. Sophomore outside hitter Megan Fesl added seven kills and nine digs of her own. Junior middle blocker Justine Stremick and Sciacca notched 8 kills each while Stasiuk also had nine. 
West Virginia (9-4, 1-1) was led by the stellar play of senior outside hitter Abby Tevis who recorded 18 kills and 21 digs. Senior setter Kailee Goold also played well with 43 assists, 16 digs and 6 kills while freshman libero Bonnie West added 16 digs. 
Notre Dame continues its Big East schedule at home Sept. 29 versus Seton Hall and Sept. 30 against Villanova.

MilicH added a goal of his own 30 minutes later. lie rnceived a pass from senior forward Joseph Lapira on the right side, beat one of' the Scarlet Knight dei'Pnders, and then snuck a low shot into the far corner for his first strike of the season. 
"I le is one of' the best players in the country," Clark said. "lie has pace, he has ability, and he is dangerous." 
The entire Irish offense looked dangerous Friday night in Piscataway, N.J. Notre Dame outshot the Scarlet Knights 22­1 0 in the game and 12-1 in the first hall'. The tnam was able to keep constant pressure on Hutgers that led to a relatively easy night in net for Cahill. The senior had four saves in the game, whieh was shown on Fox Soccnr Channel. 
"I think we've built up a great reputation of being a very good team and everywhere we go we will play in front of a full house," Clark said. 
Notre Dame 1, VIllanova 0 
The Irish ended the Wildcats' six-game winning streak Sunday in Philadelphia. 
Notre Dame once again domi­nated the opening 45 minutes, holding a 14-3 advantage in shots on goal, but failed to score. 
"We totally dominated both teams in the first hall'," Clark said. "We didn't do quite as well in the second half. We have to sit down with the video and come up with some answers for that." 
The Irish scored their lone goal in the 51st minute when sophomore Jeb Brovsky took advantage of a chanee sparked by Lapira. 
Lapira pushed the ball for­ward to Donohue on the left side. Donohue passc~d up a shot of' his own and fed the open Brovsky on tho far side. The sophomore took his time then drilled a low shot past Wildcat keeper Jason Friel. 
Brovsky saw a lot of aetion in thc1 second half because senior forward Kurt Martin was nurs­ing an injury from the Hutgers game. The team's depth has becm clutch on many occasions so far this season. 
"Key guys are out but the great part is that the younger guys have all been prepared to step up," Clark said. 
Martin is expeeted to return to action next weekend when Notre Dame comes home to l'aee Cincinnati at Alumni Field Friday night. The Irish will also play Sunday against another Big East opponent, Louisville. 
T lw only two games Notre Dame has not won this snason have eome on Sundays after playing earlier in the weekend. Clark hopes that the Irish put an end to that eurse after Sunday's win over Villanova. 


"I think it might be psycho­logieal more than anything nlse," he said. "Now we have broken that barrier and hope­fully we should be fine from hnre on out."

"It was a bettor seeond half with some positive adjustments that holped get goaL.,," MacKenzie said. "There was some miscommunica­tion on the defbnse in the first hall', but Amy responded well, with huge, timely saves." 
Kalamazoo was physical and did their best to tire the Belles out in the seeond half, but they weren't able to get the ball pa.'it the Saint Mary's defense. 
"We had a solid defense," MacKenzie said. "It was a huge game. [Sophomore defensemanl Katy Durkin had a great second half." 
MaeKenize said Higgins, a def(mseman, played strong on both sides of the ball. 
"Justine plays defense for us, but she created all kinds of havoc for them, and they had no response for her," she said. "I am so proud that she had the game-winning goal."

Saint Mary's entered Saturday's MIAA Jamboree with dreams of making this season the best in school histo­ry. It left with its goal one­third accomplished. 
The fourth-place finish was the Belles' best in their nine years in the MIAA, and because the Jamboree deter­mines a third of the conference championship standings, the Belles are on the fast track to beating the program's best­ever fifth-plaee finish from a season ago. 
"[Saturday] was amazing," third-year coach Jackie Bauters said. "I think it was especially rewarding for our returners who understand how huge it was to see that jump in the rankings." 
Senior Megan Gray, an all­conference runner, paced the Belles and finished sixth over­all with a 20:00 time for the 5K course. She was the first runner not from Calvin -who swept the meet with the race's
