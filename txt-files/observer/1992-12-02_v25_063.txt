Petitions ask support for women's center 
By JASON WILLIAMS 
News Writer 
Several campus women's groups are planning to circulate petitions next week in an attempt to spur enough student and faculty interest to start a women's resource center at Notre Dame. 
The Women's Resource Committee is spear-heading the attempt to establish a center for women's activities on campus with the help of several other organizations including Campus Alliance for Rape Elimination (CARE) and Feminist Forum. 
Leaders of various groups met in the Library Pit yesterday to discuss objectives and stratagem for circulating the petitions around campus. 
"All we're asking for is a place to meet and coordinate events," said Linda Chalk of the Women's Resource Committee. "Look what were forced to do now-we're squished onto a lit­tle table in the basement of the library." 
Patty O'Donnell of the Com­mittee said their efforts to establish a resource center have been hit-and-miss. The Office of Student Activities has let the group set up petition signing stations in LaFortune Student Center, Hesburgh Library and both North and South Dining Halls, but but it took over a week to respond to O'Donnell's request, she said. 

O'Donnell said other Univer­sity offices have openly blocked the wishes of the Committee. 
"We asked the Office of De­velopment for a small office with a desk, a telephone and a filing cabinet," she said. "I came home from class one day and found a message from the Director of Development's sec­retary-I didn't even get a chance to talk to the director-on my answering machine that said 'There is no place for this matter at this time."' 
By circulating petitions, the group hopes to show University officials that there is student interest in a centrally located hub that coordinates speakers, literature and activiti{ls of women's groups on campus. 
"Petitions are the best way to get physical evidence and to make a point that students do want a women's resource cen­ter on campus," Chalk said. 
"This also allows us to feel out the administrations to see what their response will be," O'Donnell added. 
Funding for the resource center will come from national and regional women's groups. The committee already has

HPC: Library open 24 hours during exams 

By BEVIN KOVALIK

In an effort to better accom­modate students during finals week, the Hall Presidents' Council (HPC) will fund approx­imately $300 to pay the wages of the Hesburgh Library em­ployees so the entire library will remain open 24 hours from Dec. 13-17, according to Jason Coyle, HPC co-chair. 
"The Library seemed the most ideal place to increase the 24-hour study space available for students during finals," said Stanford Hall co-president Frank Flynn, who proposed the idea. 
"LaFortune Student Center would have been a much more expensive venture," he added. "The Library has more space and will require less funding."

Student card to encourage safe driving 
By EMILY HAGE 
News Writer 
Student Government and ND Safewalk has distributed Des­ignated Driver's Club cards to all Notre Dame students enti­tling them to complimentary soft drinks at five local bars in return for not consuming alco­hol and being the designated driver. 
The Alumni Senior Club, Coach's, C.J.'s, Commons and the Linebacker agreed to par­ticipate in the Designated Driver's Club on a permanent basis. Bridget's declined the offer. 
"The Designated Driver's Club Card is an option for peo­ple who do not want to drink and for safety," said R.G. Star­mann, director of ND Safewalk and Security Commissioner. "ND Safewalk is sponsoring the Designated Driver's Club Card because we are in the business of getting people home safely." 
Starmann added that he be­lieves students will not take advantage of the card. 
Student Body Vice-President Molly O'Neill said that it is ex­pected to create a good rela­tionship between the bars and the NO community. 
The card is primarily a "pro­active" step, according to O'Neill. "The more mainte­nance-type things we can do, the fewer problems we will face ahead." 
Though the card is not a re­actionary measure, it is just another incentive for students to prevent drunk driving, O'Neill added. 
"If this prevents one person from drinking and driving and killing someone, it is definitely worth the effort," she said. 
O'Neill said that although the statistics concerning drunk­see CARD I page 4

At his briefing, Williams also attempted to dampen specula­tion that up to 30,000 U.S. troops might be sent to Somalia should the U.N. Security Council authorize the use of troops. 
Williams termed the number, 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The United States prefers to retain total command of its forces should they go to Somalia, but 
U.S. military leaders will coop­erate with any plan the United Nations devises to alleviate the starvation, a Pentagon spokesman said Tuesday. 
"We'll work with the U.N. no matter what they come up with on it;" Pete Williams told re­porters at a Pentagon briefing. 
"It isn't a show-stopper," Williams added, indicating the command issue would not im­pede U.S. involvement in the relief effort. 
Williams spoke as diplomats at the United Nations met to discuss whether force should be used in Somalia and what role 
U.S. troops might play should a multinational effort be mounted. 
On Capitol Hill, congressional leaders voiced their support for the use of Americans. 
The Security Council began which surfaced in reports last week, "a little high," but he didn't offer a substitute figure. 
Pentagon sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said that the actual number would range between 12,000 to 20,000, depending upon the 
U.N. request and military assessments of the extent of the operation. 
The sources also said that a three-ship Marine amphibious unit will arrive off the coast of Somalia late Wednesday. 
After U.N. approval, the 1,800-man 15th Marine Expe­ditionary Unit would secure an airfield to land forces arriving later, the sources said. 
House Speaker Thomas Foley, 0-Wash., told reporters the United States is very close to sending ground troops and said he supported such a move.

INSIDE COLUMN 


Nuclear age brought peace, problems too 
Today either represents the anniversary of the greatest achievement in human history, or else it's most wicked. 
Fifty years ago, the United States was at war against Japan and Germany, and scientists Managing Editor 
were engaged in a global ________ race to make a weapon with destructive powers equal to the wrath of God. 
Fifty years ago today, Enrico Fermi and company finally split the atom. At the place o their achievement, just under two hours from Notre Dame, is a plaque which reads: "On December 2 1942, man achieved the first sel sustaining chain reaction and thereby initiated the controlled release of nuclear energy." 
The world has not been the same since. 
Within three years, J. Robert Oppenhiemer had figured out a way to harness the power o the atom into a bomb. One month later Japan realized the awesome power of the atom as two of their great cities were incinerated in the blink of an eye. 
The atom is a tricky thing. We haven't seen one yet, maybe never will, but can see its power everywhere. Atomic plants produce 75 percent of Chicago's energy and 17 percent of the world's. (AP Newsfeatures Report, Nov 16, 1992) 
Nuclear energy production doesn't emit those carbon dioxide baddies that coal does. Unfortunately, we have to bury nuclear waste in the ground for a couple of millenniums. 
Chernobyl? 
Nuclear capability may be too much responsibility for humans to handle. However, it is here and it will stay. It has to be kept out o the hands wacky terrorist groups and kept only for heating homes and producing products. 
As Ross Perot talked about during the recent election campaign, we have to make sure that the ICBMs are done away with-well all about them actually. 
Fortunately Reagan, Bush,Gorbechev and Yeltsin were and are aware and have been working to destroy these weapons. 
Nuclear morality is a hard thing to come to grips with. Maybe it would be better if we never figured the thing out in the first place. But we did, so we're stuck with it. 
After a long forty year cold war, some may argue that Einstein was full of it when he said that it's impossible to simultaneously prevent and prepare for war, but it looks as though the deterrent strength thing worked. (At least for the Unite States, which could afford to go into debt further than the Soviet Union.) 
Why then are we ridding ourselves of them? Because might does not make right and we have seen the error in nuclear weapons-the terror, the destruction. 
So Einstein was right, but only after he realized his wrong. Maybe someday, when we know for sure that the atom is a good thing, we will look back and thank Fermi. Or will we look back with disdain, like some do to Columbus, another explorer seeking to better the world o his time. 
It's funny, but after the famous Trinity test in July of 1945, where the first atomic bomb was detonated, one of the scientists working there muttered "Now we are all sons of bitches."

Crowe receives award from French foundation 
Special to The Observer 
Twenty-five years after writ­ing one of the defining books on the history of vector calcu­lus, Notre Dame professor Michael Crowe has been honored with a $4,000 excel­lence award from the Jean Scott Foundation of France. 
The Foundation honored Crowe, a professor in the pro­gram of liberal studies, Wednesday in Paris for his 1967 book "A History of Vector Analysis: The Evolution of the Idea of .,a Vectorial System." Crowe was represented at the award presentation by Father 
E. Gerard Carroll, director of Notre Dame's international studies program in Angers, France. 
Crowe is one of several scholars honored by the Jean Scott Foundation and La Maison des Sciences de l'Homme for research on the comparative history of imaginary, complex and hyper­complex numbers as well as the origins of vectorial calculus. 

Michael J. Crowe 
Crowe's book, first published by the University of Notre Dame Press, is based on Crowe's doctoral dissertation under Professor Erwin Niebert at the University of Wisconsin. It was reprinted in paperback in 1985 by Dover Publications. 
A member of the Notre Dame faculty since 1961, Crowe earned bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degrees from ND in 1958 and a doctorate in the history of science from Wisconsin in 1965. 


Americans mark world AI OS Day with protest~, commemorations 
ATLANTA (AP) -The United States must enlist people and businesses to defeat AIDS and reject bureaucratic solutions such as President-elect Clin­ton's plan for an AIDS czar, the secretary of Health and Human Services said Tuesday. 
Dr. Louis Sullivan marked World AIDS Day by launching a new program to help compa­nies keep employees infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, working as long as pos­sible. 
Elsewhere, vandals painted an AIDS message on the state Capitol in Denver, museums removed paintings to remem­ber stricken artists and flags flew at half staff along Fifth Av­enue in New York City. 
Thirty-five cable TV compa­nies planned to go off the air for a minute Tuesday night to emphasize the loss caused by AIDS deaths in the industry. 
Sullivan said such efforts in­crease AIDS awareness in ways a national AIDS official couldn't. 
"The AIDS czar in this country is the secretary of Health and Human Services," Sullivan said. "The one way to inhibit innovation and flexibility needed to fight AIDS is a larger bureaucracy." 
He called on Congress and Clinton to adopt laws prohibit­ing companies from revoking AIDS patients' insurance, which the U.S. Supreme Court has said is legal. 
Clinton urged the world to work together in fighting AIDS. 
"For too long, America and the world have faced this epi­demic divided and frightened," he said from Little Rock, Ark. "Today we must all pledge to work together on the research and prevention programs that will make the AIDS epidemic a part of our past." 
Sullivan and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched a program to help corporate America establish

Actress Estelle Getty endorsed "Business Responds to AIDS" in a national teleconference, urging Americans to help HIV patients like her nephew. 
"He thought if he left it alone it would go away, he would get better," Getty said from Los Angeles. "If you love somebody with AIDS ... you will feel better about yourself." 
About 1 million Americans are infected with HIV. The majority are ages 25-44, the group that makes up most of the nation's workforce. There are 242,146

WASHINGTON (AP) -The Hubble Space Telescope has captured views of what may be the most distant cluster of galaxies ever sighted, a group of objects seven billion to 10 billion light years away, an as­tronomer said Tuesday. 
Alan Dressler of the Carnegie Institution in Washington said views of the distant objects were found in the background of a study of galaxies about 4 billion light years away. 
Dressler said that to a ground­based telescope the objects would be "just a bunch of fuzzy blobs" but that the Hubble, sighting from above the distorting influence of the Earth's atmosphere, can re­solve the points of light into distinct features.

A light year is the distance that light will travel in a vac­uum in one year, about 6 tril­lion miles. Since it takes such a long time for the light to travel from its source to Earth, what is sighted is actually a view of the moment that the light was created and not as things are now. As a result, light that has traveled for 10 billion years shows the conditions of 10 bil­lion years ago. This means the galaxies sighted are seen as they were near the beginning of the universe, thought to be some 12 to 15 billion years ago. 
The grouping consists of 30 to 40 bright points that Dressler said could be light streaming from the star-forming violence within the galaxies.

In one corner of the group, he said, is a quasar that is known from other studies to be about 10 billion light years away. Quasars, or quasi-stellar objects, are thought to be bright, active cores of primitive galaxies and most are found at points 10 billion light years away. 
"Though the superposition of the cluster objects and the quasar could be a coincidence, both are so unusual that there is good reason to believe they are all members of the same cluster," said Dressler. 
The objects do not appear to be in the elliptical, spiral or round shapes most common among nearby galaxies, he said.

Countrg 
MIAMI (AP) -Researchers said Tuesday they have identi­fied a chemical in the brain that is the likely culprit for the insa­tiable appetite and obesity plaguing diabetics. 
The research team tested laboratory rats, zeroing in on abnormal levels of the neu­ropeptide Y, called NPY, ac­cording to their study published in the December issue of En­docrinology. 
"The overproduction of NPY may be an underlying cause of some of the severe complica­tions of diabetes," said Dr. Satya Kalra, a study leader and professor of obstetrics and gy­necology at the University of Florida's medical school in Gainesville. 
"Overstimulation of NPY in diabe.tics may cause the in­creased prevalence of appetite and obesity, high blood pres­sure and impaired reproductive function," he said. 
The rats provide an animal model for insulin-dependent diabetes, Kalra said. More than 1 million Americans require daily doses of insulin to survive. The disease, which usually strikes during childhood or adolescence, can lead to blind­ness, kidney failure, heart at­tacks and circulatory problems. It also reduces average life ex­pectancy by about one-third. 
NPY stimulates the appetite, and diabetes appears to cause overproduction of the chemical, said the research team, made up of doctors from the Univer­sity of Florida Brain Center, the Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the University of South Florida in Tampa. 
Dr. Xavier Pi-Sunyer, presi­dent of the American Diabetes Association, was cautious about the findings. 
"I think these are interesting results," he said. "They confirm studies by other investigators in animals, but there are no data to date in humans." 
He said more studies will be necessary to deterrii'ine the significance of the NPY discov­ery. 
Kalra said the research also could produce benefits in non­diabetics. 
Other scientists have previ­ously cited abnormal levels of the chemical in disorders such as obesity and anorexia ner­vosa, and in impaired secretion of sex hormones required for ovulation and reproduction. 
Now that the researchers have located the brain sites where abnormal NPY secretion occurs, Kalra said, new thera­peutic approaches can be de­signed for alleviating those dis­orders. 
The brain peptide represents a potential new area for exper­imental therapies designed to reverse diabetes-related obesity as well as other complications of the ravaging disease, brain researchers say.

Los Angeles' pollution ranks with world's worst EPA aims 
GENEVA (AP) -New York, London and Tokyo have the cleanest air of the world's largest cities, and Mexico City the dirtiest, a U.N. study said Tuesday. Los Angeles' ozone pollution is among the world's worst. 
Air in many developing coun­tries is getting more dangerous, with heavy metals like mercury and cancer-causing chemicals increasingly entering the mix, it said. 
The study by the World Health Organization and U.N. Environment Program was presented to reporters by Dr. Michael Gwinn of the environ­ment agency. 
It warned that air pollution will increasingly cause health problems as more people move to cities, including damage to the heart, lungs and brain. A 
U.N. prediction reckons 47 percent of the world's popula­tion will live in urban areas by the year 2000. 
Cities in developed countries have done much to improve air quality, but poorer lands lack the money to tackle the prob­lem, the report's authors said. 
The two agencies examined the air quality of 20 "megacities," which they said already had populations of at least 10 million or were ex­pected to reach that number by 2000. 
They said it was the first comprehensive overview of world air pollution. 
The problems of Mexico City, which is ringed by mountains. 

are made worse because of the thin air at its 7 ,349-foot eleva­tion. 
It was the only city with as many as four pollutants at twice the highest levels recommended by WHO -~ulfur dioxide, dust, carbon monoxide and ozone. 
But all the major pollutants ­which also include lead and nitrogen oxides -were present in each of the cities, the report said. 
Some problems cited: 
-Dust storms frequently foul the air of Beijing; Cairo, Egypt; New Delhi, India; Karachi, Pakistan, and Mexico City. 
Motor vehicles are the main source of pollution in most of the cities, especially in Los An­geles. Its 8 million registered vehicles were double the num­her in second-place Sao Paulo, Brazil. 
Los Angeles was one of four cities reporting ozone levels at more than twice the WHO limit. 
Ozone is particularly a prob­lem in sunny cities with lots of cars. It is formed when sunlight works on chemicals in auto exhaust once they are in the atmosphere. 
Seoul, South Korea; Karachi; Cairo; and Beijing each re­ported two pollutants at levels of more than double the WHO limits, and nine cities ­Bangkok, Thailand; Bombay, Calcutta and New Delhi, India; Jakarta, Indonesia; Los Ange­les; Manila, the Philippines; Sao Paulo; Shanghai, China, and Tokyo were each double the WHO limits for one pollutant. 
at reducing dumping 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Environmental Protection Agency announced new regu­lations Tuesday for treating sewage, hoping that revised federal standards will lead to wider recycling of the waste, instead of dumping it into landfills. 
"Almost all sewage sludge can be used safely on our farms, gardens, golf courses, lawns and forests," said Martha Prothro, the EPA's deputy assistant administrator for water programs. 
The federal standards are to ensure that sludge is ade­quately processed to reduce

Airlift to Bosnia stopped after struck by gunfire 
U.S. Plane Struck by Gunfire On Landing Approach, Airlift Suspended 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herze­govina (AP) -The humanitar­ian airlift to Bosnia was sus­pended Tuesday after small­arms fire struck part of the steering system of a U.S. Air Force transport plane on its landing approach to Sarajevo. 
Bosnia's president meanwhile urged "decisive stands" by Islamic states to aid his country, whose Muslims and Croats voted for independence in February and then disinte­grated into civil war against the republic's Serbs. 
The C-130 Hercules that was shot in the rudder while ap­proaching the Bosnian capital was able to land safely, unload its relief supplies and return to Zagreb, Croatia, said Peter Kessler, a spokesman for the 
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
Kessler said the airlift to the Bosnian capital, encircled by Serb forces, was likely to re­main suspended at least through Wednesday while U.N. liaison officers investigate the source of the shooting. 
Twenty flights carrying food, medicine and other relief sup­plies were scheduled to land Tuesday in Sarajevo, but only 10 arrived before the airlift was suspended. 
Earlier, Bosnia's army command had accused the Serbs of shelling the airport runway overnight "with the intention of destroying the radar system and thus stopping the humanitarian flights." 
Serb forces, backed by Serb­dominated Yugoslavia, have captured more than 70 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croat forces hold most of the rest. 
More than 17,000 people have been killed in the fighting, the Bosnian Health Ministry reported Monday. 
Bosnia's Muslim President, Alija Izetbegovic, appealed for Islamic solidarity and action at a conference of the 4 7-member Organization of Islamic Confer­ence in Saudi Arabia. 
"International resolutions have remained empty words and the time has come for deci­sive stands," Izetbegovic told foreign ministers in Jiddah. 
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd called for an end to a U.N. arms embargo on Bosnia that has crippled Sarajevo's defenders, who are hopelessly outgunned by Serbs. 
The Bosnian army comman­der said in a newspaper inter­view that his forces were "preparing intensively" for an offensive to break the Serbian siege on Sarajevo, site of the 1984 Winter Games. 
In an interview in Monday's edition of the Oslobodjenje newspaper, Bosnian army chief Gen. Mustafa Hajrulahovic said his forces lacked materiel but were "now capable of some offensive movement." 
He refused to say when the offensive would be launched, but that it would be "a battle of many days in which nothing can be left to chance." 
Several previous attempts to break the Serbian artillery vise around Sarajevo have failed. 
Oslobodjenje, the only Sara­jevo newspaper still publishing, has had to drastically reduce production. It is often difficult to obtain copies on the day of issue due to popular demand and distribution problems.

BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -Two bombs that ex­ploded within hours of each other in a busy downtown shopping center left 27 people injured, police said Tuesday. 
The Irish Republican Army in a telephone call to a Belfast organization said it planted the device that exploded in a stair­well of an office building in the Ann Street pedestrian mall, causing injuries and damaging shops. 
A second bomb went off six hours later in the afternoon at an electrical components shop on nearby Ormeau Avenue but caused no injuries. There was no immediate claim of respon­sibility. Police said two youths left a package on the counter of the Edgar Lowe store and fled.

Three of the bomb victims were seriously injured. City Hospital and Royal Victor Hos­pital were treating the victims, a Royal Ulster Constabulary spokesman said. 
Security around Belfast had been tight in recent weeks amid police warnings that the IRA, which is fighting British rule in Northern Ireland, planned a pre-Christmas bombing campaign. 
Rev. Peter Barrett, who went to the scene of the first explo­sion to comfort the injured, said the bombing was an unwel­come start to the Christmas season. 
"It is not the sort of thing one thinks one should start the month of December off with," he said. 
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Bri­tish Cabinet minister responsi­ble for Northern Ireland, con­demned the Ann Street bomb­ing and the "callous disregard that the IRA have for ordinary human beings." 
The manager of the Standard Supply Co., an office supplies company based in the Ann Street building, said his company got a warning call "less than 10 minutes before the blast." 
"It wasn't enough time (to evacuate)." David Walker said. 
Walker said several members of his staff were injured, including one suffering from burns and another from eye injuries. 
Helen Oakes, manager of the Pricewise clothing shop across the street, said she heard "a big explosion. I knew it was near. Everybody was panicking. Outside there was smoke and glass everywhere and people were throwing chairs out windows of upper floors. They were trapped up there." 
Standard Supply Co. is down the street from a police station and the Belfast High Court.

Designated Driver program gets underway at local bars 
Dear Editor: 
Imagine you're at a local South Bend tavern. You've been drinking (big shock). Heavily or lightly, the fact remains that you've been drinking and should not be driving. 
You turn to Joe Buddy and wonder if he's in any shape to give you a ride back to campus. You watch your friend pull a card out of his back pocket and present it to the bartender. To your amazement he takes his drink and walks away without paying!! 
Welcome to the Designated Driver Club. Finally a system has been established to pro­mote designated drivers in a bar atmosphere. 
To kick off Health and Safety Awareness Week, Student Gov­ernment will be sending every Notre Dame student a Desig­nated Driver Card. Put it in your pocket, your wallet, what­ever. 
If appointed designated driver for the night, present this card to your friendly bartender, under the agreement that you have not and will not drink alcohol that evening, and receive free soft drinks! 
Five bars in the Notre Dame area have agreed to participate in this program on a permanent basis. They are as follows: Senior Bar, The Linebacker, Coach's The Commons, and CJ's. Hopefully your favorite tavern is on the list. 
The bars have been hos­pitable enough to promote this program so please do not abuse the privilege. The goal here is a sober driver and a safe way home. 
The Designated Driver Club is sponsored by Student Govern­ment and ND Safewalk. Even­tually we hope to expand the program by convincing more bars to provide free soft drinks. Until that time, take advantage of being a designated driver and use your card at the five participating bars.

Students apathetic about AIDS 
Dear Editor: 
The Student Government, with University support and approval, recently invited Beth Kellogg, St. Joseph County Health Department, and me (Susan Kraska, RN, CIC, Infec­tion Control Practitioner, Memorial Hospital of South Bend) on campus. The purpose of our presence was to provide HIV/AIDS education and infor­mation. 
The format was simple; brochures and poster displays, ongoing video presentations, and one-on-one discussions to answer questions, convey in­formation, and present a gen­eral sense of what going through HIV testing is like, through no actual testing was offered. 
The Student Government is to be applauded for their efforts in raising AIDS awareness. The student body is to be chided for their apathy. Four students (that's right 4 students) out of an estimate 10,000 found their way to LaFortune Student Center between 10 a.m. and 3 the century, eclipsing the in­

What if the Queen said 'No' to women? 
Dear Editor: 
"A second Reformation sweeps Christianity," proclaims Time magazine in its cover story highlighting the decision of the Church of England to or­dain women priests. 
This "women's reformation," as Time styles it, touches on more than the legitimacy of women priests (or is it priestesses?). It implicates a whole range of issues associ­ated with the rise of feminism, such as the insistence upon so­called inclusive language. For example, is it proper to address God as "father"? 
Should Jesus' words be changed to "Our Father and Mother who art in heaven"? The following revision has been proposed for Matthew 28:19: "Go therefore and make disci­ples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of God the Father and Mother and of Jesus Christ the beloved Child and of the Holy Spirit." 
Clearly, the issues raised are of such importance as to justify Time calling it a Second Refor­mation. But as with so many deviations from Catholic ortho­doxy, many of the dissenters often find themselves at odds with one another. One can imagine how such conflict might emerge here. 
The press accounts of the Anglican controversy in Eng­land note in passing that the decision by the Church of Eng­land must be approved by Par­liament and the Queen, but ap­proval by each is regarded as a mere formality, which, of course, it is. 
But that was not always the case, for a pillar of the Refor­mation in England was the primacy of the King (then Henry VIII) over both State and Church. King Henry was indeed in charge, and the church leaders knew it. 
Now suppose that Henry's successor, Queen Elizabeth II, were to exercise the authority which formally is still hers. 
Suppose she determined to ad­here to 458 years of tradition in the Church of England and de­clare that women are not eligi­ble for the sacrament of priestly orders. 
The resulting furor could hardly be constrained. A key tenet of Reformation One and Reformation Two would con­flict. Which is to prevail? And the irony of a woman monarch upholding the tradition against the ordination of women priests would add an unforeseen spin to the ongoing debate. 
We are not, alas, likely to see Queen Elizabeth II act like a real queen. She will approve whatever sense or nonsense emanates from either the Par­liament or the Church of Eng­land. One can only imagine what Henry VIII might have done were he in her position!

The Catholic Church should be next 

Dear Editor: 
I have often wondered whether a kindly bishop would help me with an experiment. I would ask him to sit down, I would tie one hand, one foot, plug one ear and place a light gag over his mouth. This would dramatically symbolize the church as she is handicapped by present ruling on the ordi­nation of women and married men. 
Tonight we have the privilege of a presentation by the Rev. Tina Velthuizen (three students will give responses). Rev. Velthuizen is a woman priest of the church of the Holy Trinity Episcopal Church (Library Lounge, 7:30p.m.). 
Hers is a timely presentation for this month the Anglican church both in Great Britain and in Australia voted for the ordination of women to the priesthood. Thus the Roman Catholic communion now stands as the only historic Western church to deny ordi­nation to women. 
Notre Dame University has not been silent on this issue. Faculty and students have been working on it for a quarter of a century. The Committee on Notre Dame's Position on the Ordination of Women was formed three years ago. After many consultations with stu­dents, faculty and staff the board formally presented a statement to the Catholic bish­ops when they met in confer­ence at Notre Dame from June 18-21, 1992. 
It remains with us then to re­joice with our sister churches who have made a mature and service-orientated decision but also to do everything in our power to enable our own com­munity to remove all impedi­ments to the spread of the Kingdom of Christ.

Things, life, whatnot 
Just how I REALLY feel 
D 
ear Mom and Dad: I think I've finally found my call­
ing-I've determined my future. I'm 
not going to work at the McDonald's 
drive-thru. 
I'm going to write greeting cards. 
Now, I'm not talking about cheesy thank 
you cards, sappy birthday cards or graduation 
cards. No-I envision a whole new dimension of 
greeting cards: cards that deal with real life and 
real life people. 
As a whole, the card industry has 
attempted to do this. While they still make your 
ordinary birthday cards and congratulations 
cards, a new trend has started-personalized 
cards. 
There's the "Just How I Feel" brand. 
There's the "Between You and Me" genre. 
They've even started to market an entire 
division of cards with the option of personalizing 
them by computer. 
They've mass-produced greeting cards for 
what they consider to be ALL dimensions of life. 
And shoppers now expect to find cards that 
perfectly fit each and every situation they may 
encounter. 
Instead of generic card headings such as 
"Birthday," "Anniversary," or "Thank you," 
we're now treated to such specifics as "Mom, 
I've always been so proud of you," "You 
supported our family by yourself," and "My 
grandfather: my special friend." 
There's also the "I want to say 'I'm sorry'" 
card (Why spend $2? Just SAY you're sorry). 
And one of my particular favorites is a 
card with the heading "I heard about your dad" 
(What exactly did you hear about him, 
anyway?). 
But this is where Hallmark and friends 
have failed the American consumer. 
They've missed a huge chunk of the 
population. 
Real life people. People who get angry and 
pissed off. People who cheat on their taxes. 
People who watch "American Gladiators." 
So what I propose is an entirely new kind 
of greeting card. People would love them-l'd 
make them attractive and easy to find-with 
categories for every REAL situation under the 
sun. And I'd call them"Just how I REALLY feel." 
I can see it now: 
 A card entitled "To my roommate the thief-" So you thought you could get away with borrowing my favorite white sweater, wearing it to The Commons, and spilling beer all over it, huh? Think again. 
 Or what about "So she dumped you-" 
She's slime. She screwed you over. But stop acting like a fool. get on with your life and stop talking to me about it. 
 "I saw you cheat on a test-" It was you. You know it and I know it. Gimme $50 or Professor Smith hears about it in the morning. 
 "I heard about the loss of your I.D.-" 
I'm sorry. I know it was a part of you. In fact, it WAS you-at least on the weekends. My deepest condolences. 
 "I know you heard about my dad-" Just keep it to yourself and no one will get hurt. 
 "I need money. NOW-" (Blank on the inside. What more can you say?) 
 "I think you've got an amazing body-" 
Wanna hook up? 
You get the general idea. 
Anyway, whaddya tbink? My future is 
golden. Could I be a self-made millionaire or 
what? 
Love, your disillusioned daughter.

'Ordinary People' 
All student-run production gives insightful performance about family trials 
: ·. ·'··. ' 

By MATTHEW MOHS 
Accent Writer 
With the end of the semester approaching, the demands on everyone's time to complete course work forces each person to limit the time spent on leisure and entertainment. "Ordinary People," produced by Notre Dame Student Players, is well worth the expenditure for one of its two-hour performances, especially for anyone who loves theatre or good drama. 
The play, adapted from Judith Guest's novel by Nancy Gilsenan, will be performed Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in the LaFortune Ballroom. This story resembles the 1980 film of the same title which won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. 
"Ordinary People" depicts the problems that the Jarrett family has dealing with the death of Buck, the older son, in a boating accident. "The play revolves around the picking up of the pieces of this shattered family," says Director Cara Conway. As the plot develops, it becomes apparent that this task is not going to be easy. 
The stage adaptation focuses on Conrad, the younger son, and his struggle to recover from a recent suicide attempt in addition to coping with the loss of his brother. The story of his family is told mainly from his point of view, and the audience soon learns that the Jarrett family is anything but the happy, All-American family. On the outside, the family seems to be a pillar of strength, weathering tough times with courage, but the interaction among family members reveals that this is a facade. 
Conrad has a number of prob­lems which are resolved over the course of the play. At the beginning of the play, he is a teenager on the brink of another breakdown. "He finds it impossible to deal with the guilt of his surviving and Buck dying," said junior Pete Dillard, the actor portraying Conrad. "He wants to be ordinary-a regular person. He just can't get into 
. 
the groove." 
Over the course of the play, Conrad finds his groove and is able to work out some the problems. Part of this progress is made because of numerous sessions with Dr. Berger, his psychiatrist. The scenes between Conrad and Dr. Berger are the most revealing and some of the most powerful. Although many of the problems Conrad has to resolve are emotional and somewhat depressing, the character has been developed in such a way as to make the audience feel sympathy for him. "We should enjoy seeing Conrad progress during the course of the show," stated Conway. 
The story of the Jarrett family does not exclusively deal with Conrad. Cal, the loving father and husband, is a wishy-washy character who desperately tries to hold his family together. At times, he becomes the narrator in order to reveal more about him and his wife Beth. 
Beth, on the surface, is a demanding and selfish matriarch. She is, however, too much of a perfectionist and a control freak to deal with all the problems. "She's controlled and controlling-very cautious," said junior Patricia Nolan, the actress playing Beth. "She presents the illusion of strength but she is not strong." 
By the end of the play, the au­dience has a deeper sense of un­derstanding and sympathy for both Cal and Beth. "I wanted to make it clear that she wasn't a monster," states Nolan. Conrad, however, steals the audience with his story as he is on stage for almost the entire show. 
As the name of the company suggests, this production of "Ordinary People" is completely student run, including the directing and technical aspects. This show does not, however, suffer from a lack of experience; it rivals, if not surpasses, many of the Mainstage productions from the past two years. Many of the aesthetic problems with the pro­duction result from having to use the LaFortune Ballroom instead of a theatre like Washington Hall. 
The strength of this production is the acting and character inter-

action. Pete Dillard gives a great interpretation of Conrad. His emotional outbursts and facial expressions add another dimension to the dialogue and really strike a chord with the audience. The emotional rollercoaster Dillard has to ride to give a realistic portrayal of Conrad demonstrates the range of his talent and is even more impressive because he is on stage for almost the whole play. 
Joe Wilson plays the atypical psychiatrist Dr. Berger with a sarcastic twist which provides the best comic relief in the play. Dillard and Wilson are a pleasure to see on stage together, as their chemistry takes the numerous office scenes to another level. 
Patricia Nolan does a wonderful job with the role of Beth. It would have been very easy for Nolan to keep the interpretation of her on one level, but she goes beyond the cold selfishness that is readily apparent. She helps the audience accept Beth as a flawed character, not a monster. 
The surprises of the show are the scenes between Conrad and his girlfriend Jeannine. Megan Thomas gives a charming performance as Jeannine and her chemistry with Dillard make the scenes believable and enjoyable. She does a nice job bringing out the awkwardness associated with teen relationships. 
Greg Murphy's portrayal of Cal shows the audience the struggle that Cal endures as he tries to maintain his family's stability. His performance illustrates how torn Cal is in the conflict between Conrad and Beth. Murphy encourages a sympathy for· his character that is necessary to understand Cal. 
The script has its faults. The numerous, short scenes are somewhat distracting and makes the chronology of the play hard to follow. But, the play is not about events, it's about people, and the actors more than compensate for the script's faults. 
"Ordinary People" is a com­pelling drama that captures the audience from scene one. The attempt should be made to see this production. Tickets are $5 at the LaFortune Information Desk.

Marge Schott faces the firing squad 
Civil rights leaders fire back 
CINCINNATI (AP)-Pete Rose said Tuesday he has never known Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott to show any ani­mosity toward blacks or Jews. 
"I don't think she hates black people or Jewish people," Rose said. 
Rose, who managed the Reds for Schott before he was banned from baseball in August 1989 for gambling, agreed with the decision of baseball's executive council to investigate whether Schott made deroga­tory statements about blacks and Jews. 
"You have to take it a little bit at a time and get both sides of the story," Rose said from his Boca Raton, Fla., restaurant. 
Rose, who has a nightly syn­dicated radio talk show, said he would have the Rev. Jesse Jackson on his program Tues­day night. Jackson has sched­uled a rally against Schott dur­ing the winter meetings next week at Louisville, Ky. 
Schott declined comment, a secretary at her office said. Schott apologized to black and Jewish leaders in Cincinnati last month for any offense her remarks may have caused. Those leaders plan to meet with her again Dec. 22 to push for her to hire more minorities. Only one of the Reds' 45 front­office employees, a woman, is black. 
Civil rights activists, including the Rev. AI Sharpton and Ben­jamin L. Hooks, and baseball home run leader Hank Aaron have demanded that Schott get out of baseball. 

The lawyer for Tim Sabo, a former Reds controller whose lawsuit against Schott made public the allegations against her, said baseball's investiga­tion is prudent. 
"I think that's a good sign. The best thing that could come out of this is for a full-fledged investigation to take place in which the charges are aired and the allegations are put to the test," Stephen Imm said. 
Imm represents Sabo in a lawsuit in which Sabo contends he was illegally fired, in part, for opposing Schott's alleged racial discrimination in team hiring. Sabo, who was fired in August 1991, asks for $2.5 mil­lion in damages. · 

Schott countersued, contend­ing Sabo was fired because he wrote himself checks that she had not approved. 
Former Reds employees gave depositions alleging that Schott had referred to former Reds players Dave Parker and Eric Davis as her "million-dollar niggers." Schott denied that. 
Schott also was accused in de­positions of talking about "money-grubbing Jews." 
Committee to respond to allegations

Top-ranked teams tip-off colleg_e basketball season 
No. 4 Kansas holds off Georgia 
LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP)-Darrin Hancock had 14 points and eight rebounds in his regular season Kansas debut and the No. 4 Jayhawks survived a sloppy second half Tuesday night for an uninspired 76-65 victory over Georgia. 
Hancock, a highly touted junior college transfer, hit a thunderous dunk to give the Jayhawks a 68-53 lead with 6:56 left, then got back on defense to block a shot by Georgia, which outshot and outrebounded the favored Jayhawks after trailing by 20 points at halftime of the season opener for both teams. 
The Bulldogs, 15-14 a year ago, got as close as 10 points in their second-half surge as Kansas, 27-5 last season, went 
7:08 without scoring and Georgia unleashed an 11-0 run, with five different players contributing points. The visitors outrebounded Kansas 30-16 in the second half. 
At halftime, Georgia had been outrebounded 25-14 and the Bulldogs, one of the Southeastern Conference's worst free­throw shooting teams last year, hit only 9 of 19 at the line. 
The Jayhawks outscored Georgia 14-6 in the final minutes of the first half and seized a 50-30 lead at intermission, which was devoted to retiring the jersey of Danny Manning, the hero of Kansas' 1988 NCAA championship. 
In the first-ever meeting between the two schools, they swapped baskets in the early going until Kansas used an 11-2 run to vault to a 32-17 lead. 
Kansas used a 12-3 run in the first half to go up 48-28 and win its 20th straight season opener. Richard Scott led the Jayhawks with 18 and Adonis Jordan had 10. For Georgia, Carlos Strong and Dathon Brown had 11 points each. 
Kansas shot 41 percent and Georgia 42 percent. 
Hill leads Duke over Canisius 

DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -Grant Hill put on an opening-night show, scoring a career-high 28 points as third-ranked Duke began its bid for a third straight national title with a 110-62 victory over Canisius Tuesday night. 
Hill, who missed only one of 13 field goal attempts, led five Duke players in double figures. Thomas Hill scored 15 of his 22 points in the second half, Bobby Hurley added 17, Cherokee Parks 16 and reserve Marty Clark 10 for the Blue Devils, who won their 11th straight opening-night game. 
The victory was also the 49th in the last 50 games in Cameron Indoor Stadium, and extended Duke's winning streak at home against non-Atlantic Coast Conference teams to 73 games. 
Hill had the less-than-capacity crowd roaring with a variety of power dunks and inside moves against the Golden Griffms. One of his showtimejams staked Duke to an early 29-16 edge. 
And, what Hill's offense started, the Blue Devil defense finished. 
Canisius had closed to 32-24 after a four-point play by Craig Wise at 8:44. It would be the last time the visitors would score until two free throws by Mickey Frazier at 2:49. Meanwhile, Duke scored 21 straight points, forced three turnovers and sent Canisius into an 0-for-8 shooting tailspin. 
When Eric Meek finished the stretch with a 12-foot jumper at 3:05, Duke was in command 53-24. The Blue Devils led 60­28 at halftime. 
Canisius endured another cold spell at the start of the second half, allowing the Blue Devils to extend the lead to 7 4-33 after the second of successive baskets by Parks at 15:01. The Griffs

SPORTS BRIEFS Giants fire Roger Craig, hire Bob Quinn 

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) ­Roger Craig was fired as manager of the San Francisco Giants today and Bob Quinn was hired as general manager. 
Peter Magowan, head of the group that has agreed to buy the team from Bob Lurie, an­nounced the moves, along with the hiring of CBS executive Larry Baer as executive vice president. 
Craig, 62, took over as Giants manager on Sept. 18, 1985, and had one season remaining on his contract. Magowan said he will be offered another job in the organization. Craig man­aged the Giants to an 807-804 record and the 1989 National League pennant. 
"He was extremely gracious," Magowan said. "You couldn't have asked for a batter re­sponse for someone who has been in a difficult position, not knowing what his future would be." 
Craig was hired by AI Rosen, who quit as general manager on Nov. 20 after seven years. Giants coach Dusty Baker is thought to be the leading con­tender to replace Craig. 

Two sources said Magowan first offered the general manager's job to former Detroit Tigers general manager Bill Lajoie, who turned it down. Lajoie, who resigned from the Tigers in January 1991, refused an offer last summer to return as Detroit's general manager.· 
Also under consideration were Sandy Johnson, the Texas Rangers' scouting director, and one-time Giants pitcher Bill Stoneman, director of baseball operations for the Montreal Expos. 
"Bob Quinn has a proven track record as a baseball ex­ecutive and has been a part of a number of successful opera­tions in over 25 years of base­ball," Magowan said. 
After joining the Reds in Oc­tober 1989, Quinn engineered trades that brought reliever

Randy Myers, infielders Hal Morris and Bill Doran and' out­fielders Billy Hatcher and Glenn Braggs to the Reds, help­ing them win the 1990 World Series. 
Cincinnati finished 90-7 2 last season, eight games behind Atlanta, and got a lift when Quinn dealt for Tim Belcher, Bip Roberts and Greg Swindell. 
Quinn also served as the New York Yankees general manager after working for several minor league teams. 
Although the sale of the Giants won't be final until baseball owners approve it, the reorganization of the front of­fice already has begun, starting with the departure of executive vice president Corey Busch. 
Baseball owners were ex­pected to vote on the $100 mil­lion sale of the Giants next week during the winter meet­ings at Louisville, Ky. 
Baer helped negotiate the deal that stopped the team's proposed move to St. Petersburg, Fla.

Will Seminoles pick Cotton? 
vveanesaay, uecemoer .::., 1::1::1.::. 


The Florida State-Texas A&M controversy probably will be settled on the field. 
The third-ranked, once-beaten Seminoles apparently are headed for a Cotton Bowl matchup with the unbeaten, No. 4 Aggies if Alabama beats Florida in the Southeastern Conference championship game Saturday. 
Although all parties deny that a deal has been struck, several sources strongly indicated that an Alabama win would send Florida State to the Cotton Bowl and No. 5 Notre Dame to the Orange Bowl against the Big Eight champion, probably No. 11 Nebraska. 
''I'd be surprised if it doesn't happen," said a bowl official, who asked not to be identified. 
A Florida State-Texas A&M game would give the Aggies a chance to show that voters were wrong to move the Semi­noles ahead of them in The As­sociated Press media poll. The Aggies were upset by the switch because it ended any chance of them playing top-ranked Miami for the national championship in the Cotton Bowl. 
If No. 2 Alabama defeats No. 12 Florida, the Tide will play Miami in the Sugar Bowl. Under the new bowl coalition, the Cotton Bowl would then get to take Florida State or Notre Dame as an opponent for A&M, which gets an automatic berth as Southwest Conference champion. 
The Cotton would love to have Notre Dame because the Irish traditionally draw the largest television ratings. And Florida State would love to go to the Orange because it pays $1.2 million more than the Cotton, keeps the Seminoles in their homestate, and gives them a recruiting boost in talent-laden South Florida. 

So why is Florida State proba­bly going to Dallas, and Notre Dame apparently headed for Miami? 
 
In its first year, the bowl coalition has a chance for a No. 1 vs. No. 2 game in the Sugar Bowl and a No. 3 vs. No. 4 pairing in the Cotton. If co ali­tion members don't give the public those games (assuming Alabama beats Florida). they will be breaking their pledge to get the best possible Jan. 1 matchups. 

 
A&M has a lot of influence with the Cotton Bowl, and the Aggies want a grudge rematch against Florida State. Besides being ranked above the Aggies, the Seminoles beat A&M 10-2 in the Cotton Bowl last season. 

 
Florida State would get more attention playing 12-0 A&M in the Cotton than it would playing in the Orange against 9-2 Ne­braska (assuming the Corn­huskers win the Big Eight by beating Kansas State in Tokyo on Saturday). The Sugar and Orange bowls go head-to-head on prime-time television, and Miami-Alabama would over­whelm Florida State-Nebraska. On the other hand, a Florida State-A&M Cotton Bowl would

be the showcase afternoon 'game. 
 Although it's a reallongshot, the Florida State-A&M winner could make a case for the na­tional championship if Miami tied Alabama in a poorly played Sugar Bowl. 
"We want to put our team in the best position to win the na­tional championship," said Florida State athletic director Bob Goin. 
Under coalition rules, Florida State can turn down a Cotton invitation to get more money in the Orange. But coalition offi­cials want to avoid that possibility in their inaugural season because it would bring back memories of the old bowl system, which was ruled by bid­ding wars and backroom deals. 
"We're not waving money 
around; we're putting the 
coalition first," said Steve 
Hatchell, the Orange Bowl's 
executive director. 

"We're trying to be team 
players," Goin said. "We're part 
of the coalition, and we want 
what's best for the coalition." 
Of course, the entire bowl 
picture will change if Florida 
upsets Alabama. 

Miami would then play Florida 
State in the Fiesta Bowl. The 
other matchups would likely be 
A&M-Notre Dame (Cotton). 
Florida-Syracuse (Sugar), and 
Nebraska-Stanford (Orange). 
The bowl pairings will be an­
nounced Sunday morning after 
the AP releases its final regular­
season poll.
