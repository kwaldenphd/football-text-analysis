ND reaches goal, plans new dorm 
by Mike Shields News Editor 
Committments to the Cam­paign for Notre Dame have pushed the University's fund raising drive over its $130 million target and paved the way for the construction of a new undergraduate dorm. The drive benefitted greatly by an anonymous donor's $7 million committment, which will finance the new dorm, and by a $10 million grant from the ] ohn and Helen Kel­logg Foundation of Chicago. The latter will endow the Uni­versity's Institute for interna­tional Studies. Vice-President for Public Re­lations and Development James 

W. Frinkwould not release any mtormation about the donor, but said he is not an alum­nus. 
The new dorm will allow the 
University to admit 500 more 
women, but it has not yet 
been decided whether the new 
dorm will house women or men. 
The new admissions will boost 
the undergraduate student 
body from 6,800 to 7 ,300. 
Notre Dame now has 1,585 
women undergraduate stu­
dents. 
The $10 million Kellogg 
grant, the largest single grant 
ever made to the University, 
will help the newly-named 
Helen Kellogg Institute for 
International Studies examine 
the role of non-governmental 
forces in international relations. 
according to Michael Francis, 
director of the Institute. He 
stressed the growing role of 
economic developments, tech­
nology and such agencies as 
the Catholic Church and multi­
national corporations in interna­
tional relations. 
Francis said that half the grant will endow the five pro­fessorships in the fields of developmental economics; the philisophical and theological ~s­pects of government and In­ternational relation; science or technology and society; socio­logy-anthropology; and inter­national law and human ri~hts. 
The balance of the endow­ment, which will be paid over a three-year period, will be earmarked according to these priorities: research and publi­cations, $1.5 million; visiting scholars, fellows, and student assistance, $1.5 million; libra­ry and resources,$1 million, ' and institute operating exren­ses, $1 millton. The Institute's faculty will include three existing chairs-­the C.R. Smith Professorship in Business Administration, the Joseph and Elizabeth Robbie Professorshii? in Goverlll!!ent and International Studies, and 
the William and Dorothy 
O'Niell Professorship in Edu­
cation for Justice. 

The five new chairs' have not yet been filled, Francis said. ''Recruiting is a several year process. We won't speed It up and sacrifice quality." He said a governing board composed of the eight endowed

State Departtnent suggests Hesburgh 
Notre Dame President Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh is one of five candidates the State Department has recommended to replace U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young, according to a report by The New York Times. 
The article quoted administra­tion officials who said. that they expect President Carter to quickly name Young's succes­sor. The officials said that, since the U.N. General Assem­bly reconvenes next month, it is important to name a replace­ment so Senate confirmation could . take place soon after Labor Day. 
Hesburgh has previously turn­ed down permanent posts in the administration. He has turned down similar appointments in other administrations includ­ing the directorship of NASA under President Lyndon John­son and head of the Office of Economic Opportunity under President Richard Nixon. 
The Times said that the State Department sent its reccomen­dations to the White House. Included with Hesburgh were: Donald F. McHenry, the num­Clark, former Iowa senator who now coordinates refugee affairs for the White House; Barbara Jordan, former Texas congress­woman and now a professor in the University of Texas Law School; and Sol Linowitz, one of the negotiators of the Pana­ma Canal treaties. 
ber  two  man  in  the  U.S.  
delegation  to  the  U.N.;  Dick  
'  

Hesburgh is in Vienna as co-chairman of the U.S. delega­tion to the U.N. Conference on Science and Technology for Development. He was out of his hotel room last night, and could not be reached for comment. He is the first Catholic priest to hold the rank of American ambassador. 
The goal of the 12-dar confer­ence is to find £ractica ways to transfer scientific and technical know-how from developed to lesser developed countries. 
Specifically, the delegates will examine ways to strengthen the scientific and technological cap­acities of the developing na­tions, restructure access to scientific knowledge and tech­nical expertise and improve financial support for and coordi­nation of current scientific and technological activities within the United Nations.

To economize 

University cuts maid services 
by Mark Rust News Editor 
A cutback in University housekeepin~ services results from an Administrative decision made last January to save money and increase the wages of housekeepers. That decision reflects what could become a growing trend in depart­ments across campus, according to Donald Dedrick, director of Physical Plant. 
Maids who once cleaned a student's room every day will now provide the same service twice a week. The service consists of basin cleaning and trash can emptying. 
No housekeepers will be layed off as a result of the decision, according to Junior Daley, Interior Mainenance supervisor. The University decided last January to forgo the replacement of those housekeeping employees who die or retire, thereby saving wages which can later be added to the paychecks of the other employees. 
"We want our worker's wages to be commen­surate with those of other workers in the area, '' Dedirck said yesterday. He added that although he did not have the figures readily available, he believes that the wages will now be commen­surate. 
Dedrick observed that inflation is creating havoc within administrative budgets all across the country, and most institutions are seeking to avoid raising already high. room and board costs. 
"Cutbacks in services are bound to be the trend and it is either that or increase fees. That is something we want to avoid at Notre Dame, " Dedrick said. 
Many housekeepers, according to Daley, did not understand why the services were being curtailed. "At first they thought they were getting more work to do. I've had two or three meetings with them to explain that they were actually going to do less work.'' 
The maids will, in fact, have 20 percent less work under their new cleaning schedule. Using Flanner Hall as an example, Daley explained that the maids, each of whom previously had cleaned one and a half floors five days a week, will now clean three floors twice a week. This represents a decrease of one and a half floors cleaned per week per maid. 
Attrition among the housekeeping staff has proceeded so rapidly since the administrative decision in January that the Interior Mainten­ance Department has already reached its target of 58 employees, down from 80 in January. 
Although talk about unionization among the housekeeping staff was rampant last semester, both Dedrick and Daley agreed that the move to decrease services and mcrease wages had nothing to do with the unionization issue. Four south quad housekeepers, interviewed yester­day and prefferring to remain anonymous, share this view. 
The housekeepers all mentioned that they had heard ''grumbling'' among the students after the services cutback announcement. According . to Daley, this is "natural." 
"I'm quite sure the students are not going to be happy about it, but I understand that we are one of the few universities left that still have maid services," he said 

I. 
Texas at Austin. 
Heppen's appointment follows a decision made by the admini­stration this spring to return the Office of'l-lousing to jurisdiction of the Office of-Student Affairs. During Price's one-year term of office, the Housing Office had been placed under the Office of Business Affairs. 
Price had been the object of considerable controversy earli­er this year after the possibility of a housing lottery to ease the overcrowding situation on cam­pus existed. 
Although he termed his new assignment very challenging, Heppen said he anticipates no maJor problems with the hous­ing situation. He pointed to less crowded conditions this year and the proposed construction of additional dorm space as evi­dence of his optimistic outlook. 
"I'm open to any system they (students) want,'' Heppen said, ''but I really think the system that Housing came up with last year was good." 
Although he explained that he had not been fully briefed on the housing situation yet, Hep­pen credited the Ho!lsing Office under Price with easing some of the difficulties the University experienced last year in regards to housing. 
"I think things are better this year because of the improved procedures the Housing Off1ee developed last year, particular­ly the way they went through the reservation lists early," Heppen said. "At any rate, last year at this time, I remember people were lined up down the

'Mein Kampf' sells slowly in Germany 
BONN WEST GERMANY (AP)-West Germans can btly "Mein Kampf' for the ftrst time in 34 years, but they have shown little interest in the book in which Adolf Hitler outlined his Nazi philosophy. Sales of copies of Hitler's book primed be pore 1945 are legal under a recent Supreme Court ruling, but no new ediuons may be printed or sold in West Germany with the exception of stores operated exclusively for U.S. and other foriegn armed forces.

Funeral services for Joseph 
W. Evans, philosophy professor and founder and former direct­or of Notre Dame's'Jacques Maritain Center, were held Monday in Sacred Heart Church. 
Evans, 57, was found dead in his apartment Friday evening. Dr. Louis Grwinski, deputy coroner, estimated that Evans had been dead for about 10 days. He added that the professor, a diabetic, had died C1 natural causes. 
Evans joined the Notre Dame faculty in 1950. He founded the Maritain Center in 1958 to encourage study and research on manuscripts of Maritain, a French neo-Thomist who was considered by many to be the Omrch's foremost thinker at the time of his death in 1973. 
Over the years Evans edited and translated a number of Maritain's works, and in 1969 ~ edited and contributed to "Jacques Maritain, The Man and His Achievement,'' an evaluation by thirteen scholars p.1blished by Sheed and Ward.

A statement published by the Soviet news agency Tass quoted Miss Vlasova as saying her ordeal was ''an act of brutality'' organized by people wanting "to worsen Soviet­american relations.'' 
The Soviet media failed to report that her husband, Bol­shoi star dancer· Alexander Godunov, had defected last Wednesday, setting off the chain of events that ended wih her arrival home.

Features 
a R€m€ms~anc€: 
Dr. Joseph Evans passed away two weeks ago. He was a professor of phzlosophy at Notre Dame and has been at the lfniversity since 1950. This piece is offered in respect and admiration ((lr tbe man and his work. 
It had been one month since I met Dr. Joseph Evans, but when I saw him again, he remembered ·my name. For many and many a friend and acquain­tance this was one of the joyful suprises that Joe shared-with us. To ask him how he was would be to receive an occasional quick response, but always a quick "No, no, how are you!" He had a great concern for the person as the person was. His recollec­tion of people he encountered, friends and their family and friends, was his heart-felt testimony as to how impor­tant that person was to him. 
To greet him with "It'!\ good to see you" would be met with a hearty "It's good to see you!" in a manner ~f emphasis that cultures such as tradi­tional Ireland and Japan have pre­served in their etiquette of greetings. His salutation was marked by a sincere opening and reaching out with the heart which sometimes may have seemed like a battle of politeness but was more a bonding in friendship. 
Joe said that he really had to work at remembering names (he once remem­bered over 150 members in a class by name and face, and many people he met only once he remembered a month or more after first being introduced). 
Joe, I believe, truly recognized the Christ in us all, making everyone most memorable! ' 
That recognition involved a keen and attentive way of looking at {>eople and at the world. He delighted m what he saw because he saw God in all. Antoine de Saint Exupery --.author of The Little Pnnce --one of Joe's favoute works--capsulized this "God­seeing" in the familiar saying: "It is only with the heart that one sees rightly.'' 
The following are excerpts from articles written by } oseph Evans The excerpts from Walk Through Campus I and II were provided courtesy of the Scholastic. Excerpts from Winter Wonderland are repn'nt­ed from The Observer. 
On auws, ethics and patriotism: 
Before moving, I often thank God and my lucky stars that I long ago de~i~ed to 'takt the bus and leave the dnvmg to us', and to have nothing at all to do with ca "S except to collect dividends every .hr~e months from a few piddli"!, automobile stocks that I . bought many years ago in a moment of weakness (weakness of myself, not the stock) and that I can't bring my Milque toastian self to dispose of (is this 'of dangling?) lest someone accuse me of not being interested in 'what's good 
for the country.' 
On survival in South Bend: 

Enjoy--dear reader--our Winter Won­derlands. Rut I hear you asking: What about the big snow--the Big Blizzard-­of]anuary 25-29, 1978? How can you call that a Wonderland? Well, It's a wonder we survived it,--isn 'tit? 
Another of his favorite quotes is taken from Pascal's Pensees (I hope to do it justice): "The mind knows things that the eyes may never see, and the heart sees thin~s that the mind may never know. '' I mclude these quotes in my remembrance of him because they were so important to him, because he lived them and practiced them in his life. 
Yet many people I talked with about Joe say they didn't know him in a private or intimate manner. He was not one to spend much time speaking of himself and he seemed to value his privacy --but that is misleading because I don't think he hid himself. He shared himself quite wholly. His wholeness as a person was his gift to his friends. When friends went to see him he made them feel important and that they were doing him a favor by visiting him. 
th€ po€t can only 
€XPR€SS hiS own 
susstanc€ 1n a 
WORk I~ thJnqS 
R€SOUnb In him ... 
Dr. Evan's mentor Jacques Maritain wrote of what Joe lived in Education at the Crossroads: ''Man is a person who holds himself in hand by his intelli­gence and his will. He does not mere!)! exist as a physical being. There is in him a richer existence; he has spiritual super-existence through knowledge and love. He is thus, in some way, a whole, not merely a part." 
Concerning education, Maritain also says: ''With regard to the human mind, neither the richest material facilities not the richest equipment in methods, information and erudition are the main point. The great thing is the awakening of the iqner resources and creativity." 
On fences: 
I don't like those steel poses there and the restraining wire--'Don't fence me' in'; I don't want to be cribbed, cabined and confined. Grass is beautiful, but 
persons are beautiful-er. 
On Coeducation: 
What a boon to Notre Dame that it 
went coedfive years ago. How nght I 
was to damn as ' excrable' the couplet: 
"You can lead a horse to water, but 
you can't make him drink, 
You can lead a girl to Vassar, but 
you can't make her think. '' 
On perspective: 
Did you not know--did it never dawn · (or twtltght) on you that autumn (as is indeed everythmg in this world) is 
ambivalent--i.e. 'glad/sad'? 
On The Crossroads Park between classes: 
I pick my way slow~y through the flow--no jostling, no competing with anyone--and choose my direction.

R. hayn€s 


This approach to people and to students in and out of class made him live constantly as a whole person. There was no sharp divide between body and spirit, teaching and listen­ing, studying and resting. He took his work with him as he conversed, walked, ate. 
It IS only With th€ h€aRt that On€ S€€S Rlqhtly. 
His personal work was of greatest importance to him for this was his way of searching for Truth. Joe was deeply religious and was a student of Mari­tain. Both men, in turn, admired St . Thomas Aquinas. This Aquin common ground between their philosophies was not accidental and helps account for the great dedication both men had to the furthering of the teachings of Aquinas. Such was the fervor of Dr. Evans that he founded and directed the Maritain Institute at Notre Dame. 
In The Ran15e of Reason, Maritain explains the tmportance of work to a man like Joe: "The substance of man is obscure to himself; it is only by receiving an1 suffering things, by awakening to the world, that our substance awakens to itself. The poet can only express his own substance in a work if thmgs resound in him, and if, in him, at the same awakening, they and he merge together from sleep.'' 
With the joyJoe showed for.his work, it is significant to recogmze ·that Maritain' s last book showed that at the end of his life he was bitter and frustrated. He felt that he was not being taken seriously, while younger, more 'modern' philosophers . sur­passed him in recogni~ion. He ~elteved that his colleagues v1ewed htm as a 
peasant. . 
Ironically, not long before h1s death, ] oe was asked to step d?v.:n fro~ the directorship of the Mar1tam Institute and the Institute was transferred to the Medieval Institute. This was a tragic event for him and hurt him deep~y. B~:~t he was still able to find good m th1s event.He was hurt, but I don't believe he was bitter. In this way, perhaps, he truly learned from his mentor, in that he more fully lived what they both 
taught. . . He intended to keep workmg and d1d. He regretted not bemg able to visit his family and attend a number of weddin~s, but he had a great sense of dedication to his work. The Jove of living that Dr. Joe Evans 
felt was also felt by all sho knew him. Those who came to share their love at his funeral included his family from 
Canada, friends from the University, from town, from New Jersey, Florida, Illinois and Nebraska. I too loved him. My hope is that his work is remem­bered. Most of all, I hope that his love is remembered for it was the force behind his work. Joe Evans was human, and his was the gift of ~race in the realization of this fact and tn livin~ fully his humanity. Adieu, mon am1. Requiem in pacem.

St. Cecilia Award 
The University's St. Cecilia Award will be presented this year to Robert Hoe, Jr. , of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., a nation­ally recognized historian and author of several articles on early march music. The award includes honorary membership in the Notre Dame Band. 
Named after the patroness of music, the St. Cecilia Award is presented annually to an out­standing contributor to the Catholtc band movement throu~h his or her career as a musician, conductor, writer or member of the music industry. 
A performer on the euphon­ium and the owner of several recreation centers in upstate New York, Hoe spends spare time documenting the heritage of hundreds of musical pioneers whose careers and composi­tions form the foundation for 
•he music of the bands today. 
He has preserved much of the musical group's early literature on recordings and has distrib­uted more than 150,000 long­play recordings to libraries, music schools and to conserva­tories. 
An open air concert provtded the entertainment last night. It was one ofseveral events scheduled for the Student Union sponsored Welcome Week. [Photo by Mike Btgley).

OBSERVER NEWSROOM TONIGHT FOR A 7 PM MEETING 
Trouble continues in Iran 
Deleg~tes seek cease-fire 
TEHRAN, Iran (AP)-Kurdish peace delegates met with gov­ernment representatives seek­ing a negouated cease-fire and the recall of Ayatollah Sadeo Khalkali, who Kurds say has ordered dozens of rebels exe­cuted. despite the peace overture, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini dispatched Moslem cleric Hos­seini Kermani to Kurdistan on a fact-finding mission yesterday with instructions to "crush the outlaws if need be," the state radio reported. 
The announced executions in Kurdistan of 11 rebels and nine army deserters appeared to jeopardize chances of a lasting cease-fire between Kurds and forces loyal to the Khomeini. 
Khomemi apparently views the Kurdish rebellion, led by the banned Kurdish Democratic party, as a threat to the revolutionary Islamic regime he established with the ouster of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in February. 
Kurdish rebels raided fuel depots and armories for sup­plies yesterday, the third day of a cease-fire, and gover~ment forces remained poised tor an attack 19 miles from the Kur­dish stronghold · of Mahabad, the official Pars news agency reported. 
Pars said 20 people were executed in the Kurdish town of Saqqez yesterday, including 11 rebels and nine government soldiers accused of "deser­tion." 
More than 50 Kurdish rebels have been put to death since the latest struggle for Kurdish autonomy began two weeks a~o. Nearly 1,000 people have dted in fighting in Kurdistan, northwest Iran, since March.

ND receives grant from Lilly foundation 
The Lilly Endowment, Inc., of Indianapolis has annouhced a $100,000 award to Notre Dame to assist in the continued opera­tion of the Center for Constitu­tional Studies in the Law School Primary purposes of the cen­ter, directed by Philip R.Moots, are to provide basic legal scholarship and selected advo­cacy activities in support of independent, church-related institutions. An advisory board of nationally noted leaders in the fields of law, government and education establishes poli­cy and selects issues of concen­tration. 

Earlier this year, the Center was asked by the Sloan Comis­sion on Government and Higher Education to analyze and pre­pare a report about umque problems ofrelisiously affiiated colleges and umversities. Are­quest trom Senators Daniel Moynihan and Robert Pack­wood to assess the constitution­ality of tuition tax credits resulted in another study that established apparent legality for higher education, but con­cluded there were serious ques­tions in regard to a credit for primary and secondary institu­tions. 
Chern dept. names head 
Dr. Roger K. Brethauer, pro­fessor of chemistry at Notre Dame, has been named chair­man of the Department of Chemistry by Umversity Pro­vost Tim<;>thy O'Meara. 
Effective Sep. 1, Bretthauer will succeed Dr. ] eremiah P. Freeman, who will return to full time teaching and research. 
Bretthauer has done extensive research on glycoproteins, large lolecules containing pro­teins and su~ars whose function in the body tncludes controlling the interaction of cells and recognition of other substances by the cells. 

He received the bachelor's and master's desrees from rhe University of Illmois, Urbana, and a PhD degree from Michi­gan State University. He joined the Notre Dame faculty in 1964 after two and a half years of post-doctoral work at the Uni­versity of Wisc:onsin, Madison. 

Local authon'ties are growing continually concerned about the recent weather situation in the Michiana area. With the recent accumulation ofheavy rains, back-up andflooding loom as definite possibilities for the near future.

Carlisle, Pa.-Once upon a time, nor too long ago, it was all bur impossible for a rookie to find a spot on the roster of the Washington Redskins. George Allen's band of merry old men, commonly known as the Over the Hill Gang, returned year after year to sneak into the playoffs as the NFC's wild card ream. 
That has all changed now. First and second-year men are bearing our seasoned .veterans for spots on both sides of the line of scrimmage. Allen is now criticizing his successor, Jack Pardee, from the broadcast booth. And the Redskins have not seen post-season acuon since 1976. 
So with a much depleted stock of draft choices, the 'Skins have set out to rebuild. The 1979 draft was made up of a paultry five picks, three in the first ten rounds and their first being number 103 overall. 
In the ninth round the Red­skins chose a well-known name in Notre Dame circles. He was wide receiver Kris Haines, best remembered for his diving touchdown grab with just rwo seconds left in the 1979 Cotton Bowl to give the Irish a stun­ning 35-34 victory. 
Wnh four veteran receivers on the roster and three pass catch­ers among the five men drafted, Haines' chances seemed slim. 
So Haines set out with just one goal in mind-playing for the Washington Redskins. The roster was cut to 60 and Haines was still around. But the rookie receiver tried to keep all of that out of his mind. 
'Tm not even thinking about getting cut," he said confident­ly. "Bobby (Betthard, General Manager) told me that they had had their eye on me for a while. Getting cut would be a big disappointment, but I know I can play ball in the NFL, if not here someplace else. But I 

really want to stay in ~'ashing­
ton." 

The next day the roster was 
cut to SO. Haines was still 
around. By now the receiving 
corps had been trimmed to 
four. Veteran starters Danny 
Buggs and Ricky Thompson 
and rookie back-ups Haines and 
Willie McGee remained. Five 
more players were still to be 
cut. 

In the pre-season games, 
Haines had looked ununpress­
ive. He caught just one pass for 
nine yards, curling back a yard 
short of a first down. But he 
was doing great things in 
practice, continually impress­
mg the coaching staff. 
"I've been playing agamst the best secondary in football," he claimed. ''Joe Lavender is fantastic, and Ken Houston and Lamar Parrish are great too. These are the guys I go up against in practice and they are the best. 
On Tuesday, the roster was trimmed for the final time. The biggest name to go was All-Pro kick returner Tony Green, a talented tailback as well. Kris Haines was not among the final five cuts. 
Pardee may take criticism tor some of his decisions, and the Redskins may not return to the playoff scene, but one goal vvas reached during the grueling summer camp m Carlisle, Pa. Rookie Kris Haines is playing for the Washington Redskins.
