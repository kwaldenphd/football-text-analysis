The space shuttle Buran was successfully launched by the Soviet Union on its first, unmanned voyage early Tuesday, official Radio Moscow said. The radio made the announcement just minutes after the scheduled 6 a.m. launch Tuesday (10 p.m. EST Monday) from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia. It gave no details of the launch, but the timing indicated the countdown had gone smoothly despite fears that rising wind and ice would halt the launch for a second time. U.S. officials won't launch their space shuttle if there is ice on the booster rocket or orbiter, and cold temperatures contributed to the failure of booster rocket seals that led to the Challenger disaster in 1986. -Associated Press

INSIDE COLUMN 


Secret admirer ads work wonders for social life 



The focus of this article is a true Notre Dame 
institution: The Observer personal ads. Every 
day at lunch, the great majority of students 
read through these ads. Although there are a 
wide variety, certain ones stand out: the 
"secret admirer" ads. 

In the essence of true equality, the secret admirer personals do not discriminate against either sex. As you've read, the recipients range from "the guy who works the salad bar at South on Monday nights" to the "gorgeous redhead in a green dress who was buying shampoo at the bookstore yesterday.'' 
The requests following these descriptive in­troductions vary as well. While some proclaim passionate love, others simply offer compli­ments or attempt to arrange a future rendez­vous. The primary goal, however, is to receive some form of response from the object of your attention. 
Of course, personals which read "Will the beautiful brunette in Dr. Freeman's8a.m. Orgo class, who wore spandex pants and a blue sweater to class Monday, meet me for an un­forgettable night of passion?" tend to go un­answered. While some personals are entered jokingly, others are placed by people with a genuine interest in meeting a specific someone. 
I recently tried this method myself. While studying on the 12th floor of the library last Sunday, I noticed an extremely attractive girl with golden blonde hair sitting only a few tables away. Now, most guys will probably say, "Big deal, there's plenty of great-looking girls in the 'brare every day!" It wasn't just her looks though--she had this smile that could knock you out of your Nikes. 
Not being one to make an idiot of myself if I can help it, I quickly rejected the idea of walking up to her and saying, "Wow, you look great! Let's take a walk and get to know each other.'' I could only picture two responses to this approach: being ignored or being laughed at as everyone in the area looked on. 
So I placed a personal to her the next day with the small hope of a response and with much kidding from friends. 
I did receive a reply, though, and after a little asking around found out her name and number. At this point, I decided to go all out and call her, which was not the easiest of decisions. It's difficult to be confident calling someone when the first words out of your mouth are: "Hi! Is this Purple Sweater? I'm Curious from Flan­ner." 
I guess the stars were in the right alignment or something, because when I asked if she'd be interested in going out sometime, her answer was yes.

We ended up seeing a movie, one of the most reliable forms of entertainment around. Need­less to say, I had a great time and I think she enjoyed herself, too, but that's not the point of this story. Regardless of whether I ever "go out" with her again, she'll have my respect and admiration. Think about it for a second. This girl was willing to go out with someone she had never met in person, someone who first ap­proached her through a personal ad. 
For any girls out there who don't think that's so tough, how many of you "screen" prospec­tive SYR dates in the dogbook before answering "yes" or "Sorry, but I'm taking a road trip to Iowa State that weekend." In all fairness, though, guys often do the same thing. The key is to be open-minded and maybe even a little adventurous. 
Granted, walking up to someone on the quad or sending a personal are not "sure things," but they can work. In my case, while I was initially impressed by this girl's looks and smile, I was even more impressed with her per­sonality and character--and this is someone I had never met in my previous two years here. At the very worst, I made a great new friend--an accomplishment I'd be proud of any day. 
Take a chance! There's almost always that special someone you've wanted to meet, but never have. Take a small risk. The pay off can be great!

Catholic bishops to speak out on issues 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The nation's Roman Catholic bishops on Monday recommitted them­selves to speaking out fear­lessly on public issues in the new Bush administration while grudgingly bowing to Vatican intervention on a church mat­ter. 
The President of the National Conference of Catholic Bis­hops, Archbishop John May of St. Louis, opened the group's annual meeting by con­gratulating President-elect George Bush on last week's vic­tory. 
But he quickly added that the bishops, convinced despite criticism that there's no such thing as "too much social con­sciousness," would continue to tackle heated public issues as

"Our voices will not be heard only in praise and apprecia­tion," he said. 
May and other leaders of the bishops' conference played down talk of new controversy between them and the Vatican, but most of the discussion at Monday's session revolved around two issues: 
-A last-minute intervention by the Vatican that will keep the group from voting this week on guidelines for resolving dis­putes with theologians, a docu­ment several years in prepara­tion. 
-The bishops' own proposed rejection of a draft Vatican document that seems to greatly limit the theological authority of conferences such as the American bishops'.

Quayle to resign Senate seat early 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-Viee President-elect Dan Quayle an­nounced Monday he intends to resign his Senate seat in time to give his successor a jump in seniority over the new class of lawmakers being sworn in Jan. 3. 
Quayle said he had "no recommendations" to make on a successor when he met privately with Indiana Gov. Robert Orr, who will make the appointment. "I evaluated everyone from top to bottom," he told reporters afterward. 

Orr, a Republican, stressed that the decision would be his to make, and said he and Quayle "talked about a whole lot of people. That's confiden­tial." 
The list of possible succes­sors includes Rep. Dan Coats, a former aide to Quayle who holds the House seat once oc­cupied by Quayle; Indiana House Speaker Paul Man­nweiler and Mitchell Daniels, a former White House political director with close ties to Sen. Richard Lugar. 
Other names mentioned in­clude Marion County Prosecu­tor Steve Goldsmith; Lt. Gov. John Mutz, who was defeated 
in the election for governor last 
week, and Indianapolis Mayor William Hudnut. 
Others whose names have cropped up include former In­diana Secretary of State Edwin Simcox, one-time Environmen­tal Protection Administration chief William Ruckelshaus and Rep. Dan Burton. 
Quayle's wife, Marilyn, has passed up several opportuni­ties to say whether reports of her interest in the seat are true, although the vice president­elect told reporters that she in­tends to issue a statement shortly. 
Speculation on a new Indiana senator picked up Monday as President-elect George Bush said in Florida that he had "no specifics yet" on the duties Quayle will hold in the new ad­ministration. 
Bush said his campaign pledge that Quayle will head a space council stands. 
Officials also announced that Quayle would sit on on Tuesday when Bush meets with visiting West German Chancellor Hel­mut Kohl. ·

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-Dan Quayle 
is likely to be a "man on the 
outside" in George Bush's 
White House following a vice 
presidential candidacy that 
began in a furor but settled into 
obscurity, experts say. 
Encumbered by his image as 
a political novice who needed 
a bevy of professional handlers 
to survive early campaign con­
troversies, Quayle enters a 
Bush administration in which 
he has few intimates or allies. 
Relegated in the campaign to small towns and safe GOP areas, Quayle as vice president is likely to be given a tradi­tional ceremonial role-going to political gatherings and state funerals-rather than the advi­sory role that Walter Mondale and even Bush had, some scholars feel. 
"Dan Quayle is going to set the vice presidency back about a decade or more. One thing that political scientists have been talking about is just how much the vice presidency has grown . . . With Quayle, it's just going to retreat to the old days of politics and funerals," said Ryan Barilleaux, a profes­sor of political science at Miami University in Oxford, 


Detectives search for more bodies in California 
Associated Press 
SACRAMENTO, Calif.­Detectives armed with steel probes found a sixth body Mon­day in the yard of a Victorian rooming house run by a mis­sing landlady who had told a social worker she took in el­derly boarders as a way to repay society. 
The sixth corpse-uniden­tified like the others-was dis­covered shortly after digging resumed Monday morning. It was "wrapped in some type of clothing," and buried in a shal­low grave under a shed, said police Sgt. Bob Burns. The cause of death was not imme­diately known. 
On Monday, 200 spectators watched from behind police Ohio, who studies the Ameri­can presidency. 
Bush rarely mentioned his 41-year-old running mate during the campaign. When asked, Bush employed the stock lines that Quayle would "make an outstanding vice president" and had been "tem­pered by steel" as he weat­hered the early furor over his military service, academic record and personal life. 
The president-elect told reporters Quayle would have access to the same papers, in­formation and intelligence that is available to the president. But he would go no further· in describing what assignments he would give Quayle. 
Quayle says Bush has talked to him about heading a space council, and that he assumes he'll have a role in the admin­istration's anti-drug efforts. "I will be a very close adviser to the president," Quayle said. 
But that's not the way every­one sees it. 
Both Bush and Mondale came to their vice presidential campaigns with substantial reputations and were able to place key staffers in important positions in the respective presidential campaigns, Baril­leaux notes. 
"Dan Quayle has contributed nothing in the way of staff to the Bush campaign. He doesn't have his own big reputation on Capitol Hill . . . Dan Quayle has no friends in a Bush White House except George Bush," Barilleaux says. 

"They're going to give him a lot of window dressing, a space council, drug task force, but he's going to be a man on the outside ... not a man who's going to be consulted in a crisis, except on a pro forma basis." ~ i

"Vindication demands that. Both of them will want to prove how right the decision was," Mahe says. 
Democrats portrayed Quayle during the campaign as a lightweight, a man with little or no legislative accomplish­ments, untested and un­qualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Even some members of Quayle's own party were dis­mayed at Bush's choice. 
Quayle didn't help his case by making a number of cele­brated gaffes during the cam­paign.

Burns said police are still searching for the landlady, Dorothea Montalvo Puente, 59. 
burns said invesugators were told she ran a board and care home eight or nine years ago about eight blocks away, and authorities were interview­ing tenants and neighbors there. There were no immedi­ate plans to dig at that prop­erty, Burns added. 
Authorities issued an all­points bulletin for Puente, who disappeared Friday after detectives interviewed her for several hours and released her for lack of evidence. 
Authorities believe the vic­tims, apparently all low­income elderly people and all residents of the eight-room Vic­torian home downtown, were killed for their Social Security checks.

where are we going to?" she said. 
About 20 students in UCAM taped the dots to walks around campus between midnight and 
2:30 a.m. Monday and picked them up at 4 p.m., Herold said. 
UCAM is a national organi­zation with about 80 chapters at colleges and universities across the nation. The organi­zation's main branch is in Washington, D.C. 
Krier said he decided to form a chapter at Notre Dame after reading a pamphlet at Vander­bilt University, where his bro­ther was a UCAM officer. 

Herold and Krier formed the group at Notre Dame this fall with the help of Mike Affleck, coordinator of peace program­ming and education at the Cen­ter for Social Concerns. The group's 20 members range from freshmen to graduate stu­dents, Krier said. 
"UCAM has no one, set poli­tical opinion. It has mixed members who are highly motivated," Herold said, add­ing that most people are inter­ested in the group "once they find out it's not ultra-liberal."

Last night Goldrick stressed the need for students to get to know their professors on a more casual basis outside the classroom because, he said, it is often difficult for professors to interact with every student in a class of hundreds. 
The univeristy has had a dif­ficult time developing the extra-curricular academic life on campus, Malloy said. 
"Since much of our day is devoted to the classroom ...we opportunity to be involved." 
The interaction of students and faculty on a casual basis allows for the "the looseness of exchange of ideas that you don't get in the classroom," said Morris, an associate pro­fessor of philosophy. 
"My idea of classroom teach­ing is that the disease in the classroom ought to be con­tagious. You want to take it back with you to the dorm." 
Morris said he especially en­joyed a viewing of clips from Woody Allen films and a dis­cussion of the philosophical and religious questions of the films with Flanner and Pasquerilla

P.O. Box Q 
Students should be open to honor code 
Dear Editor: 
Gregory Volan in his column of Nov. 2, makes the point that the Honor Code works at other schools because students respect it. Respect is precisely what is needed for the Notre Dame Honor Code at this time. Respect means giving the Code a fair chance and accepting the responsibility of educating oneself about it. Volan insists that most stu­dents are "simply against the idea of an honor code." We cannot agree with this statement, for the idea of an honor code is simply the upholding of an in­dividual's personal integrity. What many students are not in support of is probably Volan's second point, the way in which it was implemented. 
The Code is continuing to evolve, and it is our hope that it will become some­thing that will help, not hinder, the Notre Dame academic community. If, at the end of this experimental period, students do not feel that it is a benefit,

they will decide upon its fate. So they 
do have the final say. 
We fully recognize the importance of 
student educations about the Code. This 
experimental period is one of educa­
tion. In the Academic Council meeting 
in April 1987, an unopposed voice vote 
approved this experimental period, 
which "will serve to publicize and 
cause awareness of the Honor Code. It 
will be a catalyst for discussion and will 
educate the campus community about 
the positive and negative aspects." 
We recognize that more education is needed, not just for students, but for the entire community. The University Honor Code Committee is currently compiling a handbook explaining the Code, and it will be distributed in the spring semester. Any suggestions and comments are welcomed by this com­mittee. Assessment letters will also be distributed to some participants in Honor Code sections. 
In reference to Mr. Volan's insistence that the Code is inconsistent with the social life at the University, our response is simply that the Honor Code had to start somewhere. Obviously, since it has encountered resistance already, thrusting it upon students in every aspect of their lives would have been a mistake. The codes at Haver­ford, Brigham Young University, Washington and Lee, and the military academies which govern all aspects of student life are based upon established traditions. We do not have the neces­sary foundation of tradition. We have to try an honor code and give it a chance before a tradition can possibly be es­
tablished. 

During the next few years, students will be educated about the Code so that they can responsibly decide for them­selves. We urge students to try to keep an open mind about the Honor Code and not to be prejudiced one way or the other until they understand it. Obvious­ly, Gregory Volan has tried to come to terms with the Honor Code and has made an educated decision about it. We thank him and respect him for it.

EXPANSION PROJECTS NEVER MATERIALIZED 
LAURA LINDNER accent writer 
T 
he Notre Dame campus is re­garded as one of the most beauti­ful and hallowed college campuses in the nation, in terms of its architec­ture, its landscape, and its many statues. Its character is largely the product of a comprehensive plan for campus development published by Professor Francis W. Kervick in 1920 under the direction of University President James Burns. 
Kervick's conception of an appro­priate campus architectural style and land use influenced the physical de­velopment of Notre Dame for 35 years after his projections. Since his ideas became reality, several other plans for the physical and academic development of campus have been proposed, one of which had the poten­tial to change the nature of the uni­versity entirely. 
In the 1950s the Queen of Scholars Graduate Campus was proposed to enhance the post-graduate dimension of the university. Each school was designed in a different architectural style, from Greek and Roman to Medieval and contemporary. 
It was to be located immediately north of St. Joe's Lake and included a 100-foot-high white marble column, surmounted by a statue of Our Lady Queen of Scholars, and surrounded by three concentric marble colonnades encompassing statues of past and future great world educators. 
The Queen of Scholars Graduate Campus was also to include a graduate administration building, a theater and gymnasium, a church, a women's dormitory, a visiting Bac­helor faculty living quarters building including transient hotel accommoda­tions for 100 people, a sports area, and a faculty housing and club area. 
The proposal provided more than an architectural design for six co­educational graduate schools; it had

The Queen of Scholars Graduate Campus was completely abandoned as being too ambitious. Each of the six graduate schools was to have its own distinct architectural scheme and the entire 
the potential to revolutionize the graduate program at Notre Dame. This potential was embodied in the International Queen of Scholars Com: mission. 
The Commission was set up to en­hance the relationship of Notre Dame to the entire academic world through a variety of programs. It was to an­nually award ten monetary grants of $5,000 each (not adjusted for infla­tion) to selected scholars or educators throughout the world who contributed most during the year to the fields of scholarship and educa­tion. 
The selection of a scholar or educa­tor to receive one of these awards entitled the recipient, upon his death, to burial in the crypt beneath the scholar's shrine. The most distin­guished of the recipients was also to be honored by having a statue of the individual placed in one of the niches of the depressed concentric marble colonnades upon his death. 

The Queen of Scholars proposal provided for the consolidation of all of the Order of Holy Cross Commu­nity activities in a new group of buildings to be located to the north and west of St. Mary's Lake. 
These three buildings and campus areas --the undergraduate campus, the Queen of Scholars Graduate Campus, and the Holy Cross Commu­nity area --were to be entirely auton­omous in their own settings and ad­ministration. Each was designed to have the potential to expand in future years. 
It seems fairly obvious why the Queen of Scholars Graduate Campus never became a reality. The Lady Queen of Scholars shrine would have competed with "Our Lady of the Golden Dome," and a Midwest graduate program would have tran­scended anything offered by Harvard. 
Given the goals of this project, it is 
ground, Grace and Flanner, were the only buildings to see reality.

evident that a graduate campus of this magnitude would have been financially unfeasible as well as too idealistic in terms of its international aspirations and architectural design. The solidarity of each graduate school caused by its unitary design would also have undermined interac­tion between the students and faculty. 
It is also very possible that the university would have evolved into two very distinct campuses and that the graduate program would render the undergraduate program insig­nificant, given the former's ties to the international intellectual community. This development would definitely clash with Notre Dame's traditions and values. 
The construction of the "Mod Quad" was the product of a $52 mil­lion development program from 1967 to 1972 called "SUMMA: Notre Dame's Greatest Challenge." Aimed at bringing new distinction to the university, one of the objectives of this comprehensive fund-raising ef­fort was to allocate $9 million for the development of residence and dining facilities. 
The committment to residentiality and the need for new dorms cul­minated in a series of architectural proposals, one of which was the 1967 Ellerbe Projection. Ellerbe As­sociates designed an architectural scale model for a new quadrangle to be created north of the Memorial Library. 
Five new high-rise student residence halls were tentatively projected to form a semicircle around a church of contemporary motif de­signed to meet the growing liturgical needs and to serve a Catholic col­legiate community. Only two of the 11-storey skyscraper dormitories were built, Flanner and Grace Tow­ers. 
The failure to construct the addi­
tional three high-rise residence halls 
and the proposed Cardinal O'Hara 
Memorial Chapel was probably due to 
the failure of the SUMMA campaign. 
Nonetheless, the "Mod Quad" retains 
some of the character of the Ellerbe 
projection, and the same architects 
later went on to design the Joyce 
Athletic and Convocation Center. 
It is evident that parts of the Notre Dame campus may have been very different if these plans had been im­plemented. Our world-renowned campus may have featured a second church and an incredible graduate program.

Aim could excel at more sports than just football 
By FRANK PASTOR Sports Writer 
Combine the size and strength of a weightlifter with the height and agility of a bas­ketball player, and you've got some idea of the threat Jeff Aim poses to opposing quarter­backs. 
The 6-7, 248-pound junior de­fensive tackle has been a dis­ruptive force in opposing back­fields this season, stuffing ballcarriers, leaping to bat down passes, and occasionally coming down with the ball as well. 
"I may not be the most effec­tive pass rusher," said Aim, "but I can get my hands up. A lot of the time, because of the way our defensive backs are covering their receivers, their (opposing quarterbacks) only option is to do a kind of dump pass where the tight end will come around and the ball is just lofted over the line. 
"If there's nobody up there (on the line), the quarterback's just gonna throw it. Right when he throws it, you have a chance to jump up, and that's how I've made both of my intercep­tions." 
Both of Aim's interceptions have directly contributed to Irish scores this season. He picked off a late third-quarter pass against Miami to set up Reggie Ho's 27-yard field goal and give Notre Dame a 31-21 lead over the Hurricanes. He also pulled down a pass against Rice to set up a Tony Brooks touchdown run. 
Aim has tallied 44 tackles on the year, including 22 unassis­ted. He also has recovered a fumble, which is not surprising considering his knack for being at the right place at the right time. 
"I'll tell you what he does probably better than any player that I've ever coached," said Irish defensive tackles co­ach John Palermo. "He chases the football better than anyone I've been around. For the most part, he's at the right place at the right time." 
Aim is an integral part of a defensive line which features three first-year starters. He complements George Williams and Chris Zorich in fending off opposing blockers and apply­ing pressure on quarterbacks. 
"George, Chris and I have to put pressure on the quarter­back and try to get a hand up in his face," said Aim. "If we can, we sack him. But I think the most important thing is just to let the quarterback know that we're out there and we're trying to get at him. 
"I think we've been slowly proving we can do it. I think people know we're some kind of force to be reckoned with, and they're gonna have to do something to stop us." 
Aim credits Palermo for revamping the defensive line, considered something of a question mark prior to the season. 
"It's a new defensive line," said the Orland Park, Ill. na­tive. "We've changed the way we're hitting this year. We tend to hit people in the face this year. You know, we hit our head to their head, and it seems that it stops an offensive lineman. He (Palermo) just taught us how to hit this year, and it seems to be very effec­tive." 
Equally effective was Aim's switch from outside linebacker to defensive tackle. Recruited as a linebacker out of Carl Sandburg High School in Or­land Park, Aim was moved to the line three games into his freshman season. Palermo believes the switch was neces­sary to maximize Aim's defen­sive output. 
"Jeff is a very good technique 

Jeff Aim has made his presence felt on the Notre Dame defensive line this season. Aim has re­corded two key interceptions in wins over Miami

"I think he under­recruiting weekend, they read stands the game fairly well. me my arrival time in South With his size and development, Bend as my departure time in the best way for him to show Chicago.

"When I was supposed to come Alm has been plagued by a series of injuries in the three years since he enrolled at Notre Dame, but everything seems to have come together in 1988. He is enjoying his finest season to date, and has earned the · respect of his coaches to boot. 
"Going into spring football last spring, Jeff had a history 
, of being injured and basically not performing up to his abili­ties," said Palermo. "I think what he did was to make a com­mitment in the springtime that he was going to be the best player he could be. I think he really wants to help this foot­ball team."

Rader's dream comes true 
Sailing Club qualifies 
Associated Press 
ANAHEIM, Calif. -Doug 
Rader, calling his new job a 
"dream opportunity," was 
named manager of the Califor-· 
nia Angels Monday. 
Rader, 44, a former Texas Rangers manager and Gold Glove-winning third baseman for the Houston Astros, worked as a scout for the Angels during the 1988 season. He replace Cookie Rojas, who was fired late in the season. 
Rader is the 12th manager in the club's 28-year history. 
"There are not many people who love baseball who wouldn't be ecstatic, not only to be a part of this organization, but to get the job I have been given," Rader said during a news con­ference to announce his hiring. 
Rader, who will work with "not excellent talent, but good enough to get us headed in the right direction," said his top priority was getting the players to realize their potential. 
"The Dodgers are a perfect example," Rader said of the team up the freeway that won the National League playoffs and the World Series this 

season by upsetting the New 
York Mets and Oakland Ath­
letics. 

"They (the Dodgers) didn't play over their heads," Rader said. "They played to their abilities and other clubs did not." 
Rader said his contract with the Angels was for one year, and he was retaining the club's coaching staff. 
Angels owner Gene Autry said several people were inter­ested in the managerial job. 
"We interviewed quite a few men who wanted to manage here and I can truthfully say they were all qualified," Autry said. "We got it down to one guy and I think we made a very good choice." 
"The selection process went on longer than we had hoped," General Manager Mike Port said. "There were a lot of good baseball people interested. We have the man we want." 

Rader was appointed Rang­ers' manager in the winter of 1982. He had a 77-85 record and finished third in the American League West in 1983. He was fired by the Rangers in 1985 
after the team started the 
season 9-23. 
He has a major league managing record of 156-201, in­cluding a 1-1 record while ser­ving as interim manager for the Chicago White Sox in 1986. 
Rader played 10 seasons with three r:najor league clubs-­Houston, San Diego and Toronto. He was with the Astros for more than eight seasons. 
He won five consecutive Gold Gloves from 1970-74, and hit 20 or more homers three times. 
The Angels fired Rojas with eight games· remaining in the 1988 season and replaced him on an interim basis with third base coach Moose Stubing. The Angels lost all eight games un­der Stubing and finished the season with a 12-game losing 
streak and a 75-87 record, for fourth place in the AL west, 29 games behind Oakland. 
Others considered for the job included former Angels' manager Jim Fregosi and former Cleveland manager Pat Corrales. 


for National Regatta 
The Sailing Club qualified for the Collegiate National Regatta two weekends ago when it placed third out of five teams in the Regional qualifying meet. The top three teams were invited to compete in the National meet.

Two boats participated for the Irish. In the "A" Division, Pete Wall and Chris Blum sailed behind some strong winds to capture third place. 
In the "B" Division, Tom Seffions and Patti Losinske made a run for the championship, but came up short and settled for third place. 
"Overall, we sailed really well considering the compe­tition," said Losinske. "We hope to do even better in the Collegiate National." 
The Collegiate National Regatta is one of the biggest in the country. Besides Notre Dame, 18 other teams will be in action, all of whom qualified in other meets. Some teams who have qualified are Stanford and the Naval Academy. The Regatta will be held near Chicago on Thanksgiving weekend. 
The Men's Volleyball Club had a slight change in plans recently. The Irish will not travel to Canada over Thanks­giving break due to a lack of funds. In place, the money will be used to fund a trip to San Diego later in the year.

Buffalo routs Miami 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -Ronnie Harmon ran for one touchdown and caught a 16-yard pass from Jim Kelly for another and Robb Riddick had two 1­yard scoring runs as the Buf­falo Bills maintained the NFL's best record by beating Miami 31-6 Monday night. 
It was the sixth straight win for the Bills, 10-1, who maintained their lead of four games over New England and Indianapolis in the AFC East with five games to go. 
The Bills, who intercepted Dan Marino three times, scored on their first posses­sion of the game. They led 10-6 at halftime and, relying mainly on a defense led by Bruce Smith, Cornelius Ben­nett and Art Still that held Miami to just 33 yards rush­ing, the Bills handed the Dol­phins their worst defeat since 1970. 
Then they put the game away with two touchdowns 2% minutes apart in the third quarter. 
The first score, with 5:33 left in the period, came on Riddick's 1-yard plunge at the end of an 80-yard drive aided by two Miami penalties. The second was a 6-yard run by Harmon set up by Bennett's interception and 30-yard return of a Marino pass on Miami's first olav after the kickoff. 
The Bills' 10-1 record represents their best start since 1964 and the six-game winning streak is their longest since 1974.

Duke, a Final Four team two of the last three seasons, was named the No. 1 team Monday in The Associated Press' preseason college basketball poll. 
The Blue Devils, who finished fifth in the final regular-season poll last season and went on to the Final Four and a semifinal loss to eventual champion Kansas, received 33 first-place votes and easily out­distanced No. 2 Georgetown, which had eight first-place votes.

and Xavier, Ohio--did not even receive a vote in the preseason balloting and another, Kansas State, got just one. 
Kansas, which wasn't ex­pected to fare that well follow­ing the graduation of Danny Manning, the NBA's No. 1draft choice and the player most re­sponsible for the Jayhawks' title. However, a three-year probation for recruiting viola­tions was handed down to Kansas and the Jayhawks will not defend their title in the NCAA tournament. 
Nine of the teams in the preseason poll, including Geor­getown, were unranked in the final poll of last season. 
Eight teams received first­place votes and 51 of the 293 Division I teams eligible for re­ceiving votes did. 
Michigan received four first­place votes and 1,090 points, 74 more than Louisville, which got. seven No. 1 votes. Oklahoma 
had nine first-place votes and 1,001 points. 
North Carolina was sixth with three No. 1 selections and 915 points, just four more than Iowa, which had two first-place votes. One point separated No. 8 Syracuse, 852 points, and Il­linois, while Nevada-Las Vegas, the final team to receive a No. 1 vote, rounded out the Top Ten with 851 points. 
Arizona--the final member of last year's Final Four--led the Second Ten with 605 points and was followed by Villanova, Georgia Tech, Missouri, Florida, Florida State, Ohio State, North Carolina State, 
Temple and Stanford. 
Temple was the top team in the final poll of last season, but the Owls, who lost to Duke in the regional finals, lost three starters from the 32-2 team that brought the school its first No. 1 ranking. 
Georgetown and Louisville are the only members of the Top Ten not to have finished in the final Top Twenty of last season but Villanova, Georgia Tech, Missouri, Florida, Florida State, Ohio State and Stanford were not in that voting. In fact, Stanford and Florida State were not ranked at any time last season. 
In addition to those men­tioned above, Pittsburgh, Loyola Marymount, and Brig­ham Young did not return to the Top Twenty. 




ND, Trojans retain top spots 
Associated Press 
Notre Dame and Southern California are within one step of a showdown between the na­tion's No. 1 and No. 2 college football teams while Arkansas made the Top Ten for the first time this season and Houston cracked the Top Twenty after an eight-year absence. 
Houston, which last ap­peared in the Associated Press poll in September 1980, upped its record to 7-2 by defeating previously unbeaten Wyoming 34-10 Saturday night and drop­ping the Cowboys from lOth place to 16th. Colorado, No. 19 last week, fell out of the rankings by losing to No.7 Ne­braska 7-{). 
In addition, Auburn and Oklahoma swapped places, Auburn rising from ninth to eighth and Oklahoma slipping from eighth to ninth. 
Notre Dame, idle last weekend, received 40 of 59 first­place votes and 1,156 of a pos­sible 1,180 points from a nation­wide panel of sports writers

Basketball--the one that thought Jamere Jackson was too young to run for president­-will jump from his seat and loudly dispute one of Digger's coaching decisions. 
Later in the season, after one of the five talented freshmen misses a shot late in a crucial contest, he will jump up again, this time yelling "Mark Steven­son would have nailed that shot." 
But before we pass judge­ment so quickly, let's look a little deeper into the situation. 
Digger may not win NCAA championships, but he does win games, at least 20 of them the last five seasons. He's been in the NCAA tourney the past four years, and the 1977-78 Fighting Irish made it to the Final Four. Digger's teams have defeated the No. 1 team in the nation seven times. 
Yet students complain that this is Notre Dame, and they deserve more than simply a winning season. Bear in mind that no one wants to win a championship more than Dig­ger, but he will not do it at any cost. He will win it the right and sportscasters. The 9-{)-{) Irish, who play Penn State on Saturday, are No. 1 for the 
third consecutive week. 
Southern Cal, a 50-{) winner over Arizona State, received 18 first-place votes and 1,131 points. The Trojans, also 9-{)-0, are No. 2 for the third week in a row. They face No. 6 UCLA on Saturday and Notre Dame on Nov. 26. 

Last week, also with 59 voters participating, Notre Dame led USC 42-15 in first-place votes and 1,160-1,122 in points. In the last three weeks, Notre Dame's lead has decreased from 47 points to 38 to 25. 
The other first-place ballot went to defending national champion Miami, which was idle. The Hurricanes, 7-1-0, received 1,06() points. 
Unbeaten West Virginia, 10­0-{), remained No. 4 with 977 points following a 35-25 triumph over Rutgers. For the first time in three weeks, however, the Mountaineers failed to receive a first-place vote. 
way, his way, the Notre Dame way or not at all. 

Digger will be the first to ad­mit that Stevenson could have played and made a difference in losses to Duke and Kentucky last year. Digger says the Duke students would have greeted Stevenson with shopping bags in one hand and beer cans in the other. Maybe Kentucky and Kansas would opt for the cham­pionships and accept a little embarrassment, but Notre Dame and Digger never have and never will. 
"It cost us three big games," Digger said of the Stevenson or­deal. "But do we sacrifice what we are as a University to be No. 1 at any cost? We refuse to do that at Notre Dame and refuse to bend academically because the kids want a career that means something after school. We will not put our­selves in a position where the athlete is bigger than the Uni­versity." 
In terms of the things that supposedly count, like gradua­tion and preparation for the real world, Digger has the top program in the country. In 
terms of the marks under the 

wfin column tDh~t students hand ans count, 1gger some ow comes up short. That could 
change soon, especially as

Florida State beat Virginia Tech 41-14 and held onto fifth place with 937 points, UCLA's 27-17 victory over Stanford en­abled the Bruins to remain No. 6 with 866 points and Nebraska is again No. 7 with 805 points after edging Colorado. 
Auburn's 20-10 victory over Georgia lifted the Tigers into eighth place with 769 points while Oklahoma received 750 points and fell one spot after struggling past Missouri 16-7. 

Arkansas, 10-0-{) and one of four teams with perfect records, rose from 11th place to lOth by downing Texas A&M 25-20. The Razorbacks received 657 points. 
The Second Ten consists of LSU, Michigan, Oklahoma State, Syracuse, (:lemson, Wyoming, Houston, Alabama, Washington State and Georgia. 
Last week, it was Arkansas, LSU, michigan, Oklahoma State, Syracuse, Clemson, Georgia, Alabama, Colorado and Washington State. 

Proposition 48 begins to take 
full effect. 
Before Proposition 48, ath­

letes could get an 'A' in P.E. 
and an 'F' in science and still 
play. Notre Dame couldn't 
recruit those players, but it did 
have to play against them. Now 
the Irish can be competitive 
again, both on the court and in 
recruiting. 
"Now we're looking beyond just getting into the tourna­ment," Digger says. "We're now getting competitive with · the type of athlete we have. It's starting to swing back for usY 
With a team that will be in­
tact for two years and a 

talented freshman class, Dig­
ger could get that elusive title 
soon. If not, I doubt that he will 
lose much sleep over it because 
he knows that the Notre Dame 
program is doing things the 
right way. He looks at the big 
picture, the one that exists 
beyond the NCAA tournament. 
Never mind the titles, Digger will take the victories off the court, the wins that educate people and teach them about life after basketball, the les­sons gained not only in the classroom but also in the real world.

Digger deserves better from Irish student body 
At Duke, students stand in line all night--sometimes all
