SLC interviewed 
Trustees' decision disappointing 
by W. Dennis Duggan 
Four members of the Student Life Council last night expressed mixed feelings about the Trustee's latest rulings <?n student life, but a fifth, South Quad representative Buz Imhoff, called the move "a slap iri the face." 
All five expressed confidence that the Trustees would not take further en­forcement action and that, in the words of one of the members, "the status quo would be maintained." Four out of the five members were members of the Hall Life Committee, which wrote a report which advocated that halls be allowed to determine their own parietals. 
Student Body President John Barkett, the only man interviewed who was not a 
by Daniel Rock 

If the question of parietals is still alive as an important issue, it appears that a sense of im­patience, disgust and just plain frustration are the dominating reactions to the issue of parietals. 
Opinion ranged from complete contempt of the parietal regulations to the rare belief that parietal 
violations  are  decreasing---or  at  least  less  
noticeable at Notre Dame.  
John  Knicien,  President  of  Morrissey  Hall,  

commented that there has been too much wasted time and print on this issue and it has accomplished almost nothing. Rev. Maurice Amen, Flanner Hall rector, said that he is just "sick and tired" of the whole discussion. He considers it a "lousy situation with p<>ople trying to struggle out." 
"Forget it," said Amen, "get something else .... go for the throat... Why isn't this place co-ed'! I'm sick of it. L<>t 's get into some real issues." 
Choosing not to discuss parietals enforcement, Amen's reaction was not unique. A sense of futility was the most common reaction to any discussion of parietals. 
"I don't believe it is a question of parietals en­forcement and any series of subsequent sanctions for violations," said Kwicien. "I think it is a matter of <>stablishing concern in the community---concern at all lt>vels. I believe we have to begin to question the whole area of the quality of student life-­Pducational, psychological, emotional." 
!<,ritz Hoefer, a Morrissey Hall resident assistant said that he disliked the word 'enforcement.' ' 
"It is ludicrous to think that I could make sure that every girl is out of the hall by 2 AM. If I see a violation, I'll tell the guy that the girl has to get out and I have done so twice this year. I don't go around snooping for violations but I feel I can walk around the hall like anyone else." 
~errr Nagle, a Morrissey Hall senator, ep1tom1zed the pr~valent opinion, sayi~g, "Many guys have been d1screet. There seems to exist an unofficial policy to be discreet about the presence of female visitors." 
According to Bob Long, Senator from Flanner have spent discussing and arguing the whole damn thing the last three years, because there are much more worthwbile endeavors to spend my time on." 
According to Barkett, however, the statement did not exclusively bode ill for the student body. 
"The letter (Father Hesburgh's to Professor Eagan, which commented on the Trustee's action) "pointed out that the Board reacted favorably on the facilities and survey questions." 
Barkett's Vice-president, Orlando Rodriguez, was also encouraged by statements about Hall improvement and the proposed renovation of LaFortune Student Center. 
"I was impressed by the amount of time and effort the trustees devoted to 
Hall, parietals enforcement seems to be in a state of cooperation. 
"We live under parietals but they aren't strictly enforced here, but we work within the system to beat the system. There aren't any problems but they're not being observed either." 
Flanner Hall president, Bob Welly, said, ''Bee a use this thing is kind of up in the air, you can't have a cut and dried answer. Good order has been maintained in Flanner and vandalism has been decreased tremendously." 
"It has become a healthier atmosphere---not just a party center every Saturday night. People are using more imagination and creativity in their weekend activities and we're not getting all the on and off-campus traffic. People don't come here unless they're invited," Welly added. 
Observer Insight 
Rev. Thomas Chambers, rector of Morrissey Hall, said that the spirit of responsibility has now been placed on the students. He believes that "We're still working out some mature leadership and further signs of growth and maturity can possibly change the minds of the Trustees, possibly next year." He emphasized the need for Judicial Boards on the hall level to become more active more efficient, then p ople will take the boar~ more seriously. 
"If Judicial Boards become effective then parietals will become effective also," Ch~mbers said. "Parietal policy is decided year from year. Our key is our Judicial Boards so that our evaluations and recommendations will be taken seriously. The decision is final for the year." 
"Parietals is only one aspect---one which has seemed immediate and controversial---but I wish the University---students and administration-­would begin to realize that images and cliches are not the concern of education," added Kwicien. "We are here to be educated in preparation for normal and healthy lives as social beings and we must remind our superiors that something is lacking."

Adverse reaction to Barkett letter 
by Jodi Cambell 
Student Body President John Barkett has sent a letter to the hall presidents requesting that they make all further decisions regarding parietal issues. 
In the text of his letter Barkett asked, "Are you willing to live under the system de facto until the proposal is re-submitted? I say 'you' instead of 'we' because frankly I am", adding that, "I think next spring and summer will be the time to resolve the issue. If enforcement continues as discretely as it's been I plan to table the issue." 
Barkett suggested that "all 20 halls must unite in a show of solidarity to force the thing through," if this is the hall's decision. 
Reactions from hall presidents questioned indicated that this plan for letting the issue ride did not meet with approval from these involved. 
Ed Motto, president of Sorin Hall and chairman of the hall president's council said "I agree that we are all tired of the issue but we can't take it upon our­selves to drop the issue if the students don't want it dropped." 
Motto feels that the hall president is both a leader and representative of his hall and that action like dropping an issue without determining student feeling could cause the president to lose contact with his hall. 
The residents of Sorin are satisfied with the discreet en­forcement as it stands at present. 
"There is an overall wait and see what happens attitude," ac­cording to Motto. 
Phil Michaels, president of Dillon Hall, said that the parietal issue hasn't been discussed at any Dillon hall council meetings this year but the issue will be brought up at the next meeting. 
"Even as a senior I can't see letting the issue slide for another year," Michaels said. He also disagreed with Barkett on the point that all 20 halls must unite to get action, saying that he felt that a large group of halls, not necessarily a majority, could get results. 
"Some Hall Presidents have been toying with the idea of going back to the individual halls and passing 24 hour parietals as a gesture of defiance to the Trustees' actions," Michaels stated. The success of this plan would depend on the number of halls that passed the resolution, he stressed. as a small .number would have a negative effect. 
A contrasting view came from Keenan president Dave Lering. 
"I'd like to see the 20 halls 
united for action." Lering said, 
adding that "the SLC should run 


FUTURE CPA'S 

the University." 
Stating that he was against letting the issue ride, Lering ealled for "an end to the double standard business." 
Keenan is becoming like it was in the past. He stated, "people do what they can get away with." 
Breen Phillip's president Steve .Jeselnick declined to comment. 
Later in his letter Barkett said, "Regarding 'autonomy', please stop using the word. We are not talking about autonomy. We are talking a bout hall responsibility, specifically in two fields: 1) to name its own hours; 2) to handle parietal and drinking violations in the hall." 
Motto and Lering both agreed with this portion of the letter. 
Ll'ring added that the problems have arisen due to conflicting definitions of the word. "We don't define it as autonomy from the University; that's ridiculous. The halls want autonomv from each other. Each hall is dif­ferent: the list of differences is endless." 
Motto agreed wilh Lering's statement and reported that a meeting between hall presidents and rectors was held October 26 to discuss a new word for autonomt. 
ND directories due Wednesday 
The Notre-Dame-St. Mary's student directory will be available this Wednesday, Assistant Student Services Commissioner Walter Szwarc announced yesterday. 
Szwarc noted that the hall presidents will receive the directories for their respective halls at tomorrow night's HPC meeting, and will be in charge of distribution. 
Off-Campus students will be able to pick up their directories Wednesday at the Off-Campus Office in the LaFortune Student Center. 
Szwarc was rather displeased with the publishing company's handling of the directories. 
Szwarc noted that among the 
many mistakes made were the 
failure to print a number of the 
students' local phone numbers.

Weekend crime report 
Security Director Arthur Pears reported a theft of fifteen dollars from Flanner Tower last weekend, by two boys about age thirteen. The boys had been going around saying they were collecting for Pakistani relief. "If students see kids in the hall who have no business there, they should notify their R.A. to get them out of there," Pears commented. 
Security patrolmen do check soliciters, if they catch them, to see if they have the proper papers, Pears said. However, their task is handicappedsince the men in the halls do not report to duty until ll P.M. 
The department also was plagued by three false fire alarms from the Old Fieldhouse, Badin Hall, and Le Mans Hall over the weekend. 
Pears noted that no new leads have been turned up in the armed robbery in Grace Hall. 
The installation of lights in the new section of the D-1 parking lot bas been completed.

SLC reaction 
(continued from page 1) 
South quad representative Buz Imhoff did not share Thornton's view of the decision's effect on the SLC. Terming the decision "a slap in the face," he suggested the SLC had been denigrated by the Trustees, which had, in his words, allowed the SLC to deal with only "twiddly matters." According to Imhoff, the SLC had become a "token group." 
ND Housing Director Rev. Thomas Chambers contended that Father Hesburgh was under "pressure from all sides." Chambers said that Hesburgh's approach indicated "great concern and fairness." 
According to Chambers, the 
future merger of SMC and ND 
might have inhibited the Trustees 
from giving an affirmitive an­
swer. Chambers said that "a 
possible question in Hesburgh's 
mind was, 'It is a big step for 
Notre Dame to take; are we 
ready at this time'?" 
Under the decision, the 
University Court will try all of­
fenders of the Trustee-created 
rules.
