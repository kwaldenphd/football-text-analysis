Parking tickets surprise students

Limited campus parking means many students inevitably rack up parking tickets and violations., and Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) Associate Director Phil Johnson said NDSP works to enforce fair parking policies. 
Parking violations account­ed for 12.2 percent of discipli­nary incidents handled by the Office of Residence Life and Housing during the 2004-0.5 academic year -second only to intoxication in the overall number of reported discipli­nary incidents, according to a Nov. 17. 2005 Observer arti­cle.

From late nights at The Linebacker to residence hall luncheons, more than 1,200 l'amilins of Notre Dame jun­iors spent this weekend at Notre Damn to take part in the events and eelebrations of the 54th annual Junior Parents Wenkend (JPW). 
The tradition of JPW began in I 952 as a way to expose a student's family to life at the University, and this wenknnd was packed with activities that high­lighted spiritual. academic and social aspects of stu­dent life on campus. 
"I thought it was a very 
well-run event, especially considering the number of people," junior Sarah Benoit said. "It was really nice for my parents to be able to meet and visit with my friends. The events allowed us to relax and get to know one another -something you don't always get to do during the hectic atmos­phere of football week­ends." 
The weekend began with an Opening Gala on Friday evening in the Joyce Center, where families socialized and enjoyed hors d'oeuvres and a cash bar. 
Junior Hoseanne DePaoli said she enjoyed the week­end's events, despite a snowstorm that nearly stranded her mother in her hometown of Sheboygan, Wise. 
"It was a very well-organ­ized event that kept us entertained all weekend," she said. "[We] had a great weekend and my parents made it back home safely." 
Wintery weather in New England proved to be a problem for junior Laura Kelly, whose parents' flight was rerouted to Detroit. 
"They ended up having to drive to South Bend from Detroit," she said. "We had a really fun weekend though. JPW is a great event."

The other day, two of my buddies were going back-and-forth about politics with­out really addressing the issues the other brought up. 
"How can you support abortion and euthanasia?" was the obvious answer Ken Fowler to "How can you support drastic cuts

education?" Babble met bab­ble, and babble was winning. 
Neither of the two made an inch of inroads with the other, but they were in luck. A third friend walked into the room, and they redirected the propagan­da persuasion towards him. 
"Dave, what do you think about this stuff-Imean, it's abortion!" Dave wasn't a flamer or a neo-con, but he had his opinions. "Look, it ain't right." 
"And euthanasia?" 
"To be honest, it kind of bothers me." 
But like I said, Dave wasn't an ideo­lo)..,rue. And his other friend tried to prove that point. 
"Now hold your horses, buddy. You guys aren't off the hook that easily. You're cutting Medicare and education funding by billions while racking up insane debts." 
Dave's slight nod of the head made it clear how he felt. "Doesn't sound too good, Dave, now does it?" "Not at all. Shouldn't we be taking care of our kids and the needy?" 
"But Dave, it's worse than that-what they're doing is going to make us techno­logically inferior when we need to com­pete with the integrating EU." 
Dave wasn't all that impressed with the fUrther explanation. 
"Yeah, but even ifit didn't, it's wrong." 
"Well that's the besides the point, because that's what they're leading us to." The other friend now thought he had his chance. 
"I know what you mean, Dave. Things are wrong because they're wrong­case closed." 
Dave agreed, and then the battle ensued. 
"No matter what the effect on GOP per capita or tax rates, I'm saying we shouldn't do some things because they're just wrong." 
Dave nodded his head once again but would soon hear the other side. 
"Medicare and education cuts aren't right, either, Dave. Don't fall into that trap. They hurt our country and they hurt our economy." 
Dave agreed on the premise, but not its reasoning. "You guys, what both of you are saying resonates with me." A double response followed: "Then who's right?" 
"Neither one of you." 
Another double response: "But ifyou had to vote for one of us?" 
Dave was tom. Half of him was on each side, so he had to figure out anoth­er way to decide. 
''I'm split on the issues but not on how you get there. IfI've got to choose between a pragmatist and an idealist on moral issues, I'll side with the idealist. At least he's got a solid foundation for moral choices."

Search for missing show dog called off 
NEW YORK -The search for a missing show dog that got loose at Kennedy Airport was called off Thursday, but officers in the area will con­tinue to "keep their eyes open" for the wayward whippet, officials said. 
In the past 24 hours, "the searchers covered the entire airport property of nearly 5,000 acres but did not spot the dog," said Alan Hicks, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

said. 
Thfl sometimes-controver­sial play "The Vagina Monologues" has not been performed on the campus sinee 2004, but has not banned by the administra­tion, Pittman said. 
Pittman said many mem­bers of the College faculty and administration -induct­ing College President Carol Mooney and Viee President of Student Affairs Linda Timm -attended the weekend per­formances. 
"I think it is a good educa­tional experience for them,· and it is good for them to hear Ithe Monologues I." she said. 
Both Mooney and Timm were audience members at the 2 p.m. SMC Monologues performance on Sunday. 
"This is an especially pow­erful performance because it is the stories of our women," Mooney told The Observer following the Monologues. 
She declined further com­ment Sunday. 
Timm said the Monologues' internal focus on the College community reflects the "courage and great deal of faith" of Saint Mary's stu­dents, faculty and Sisters. 
"I think it is important that we have a variety of pro­grams that present informa­tion on topics of sexuality, personal safety, health and wellness for women, violence 

· against women, et cetera," 
Timm said. "No one approach 
speaks to everyone. Not 
everyone will feel comfort­
able at the SMC Monologues, 
and not everyone will attend 
other programs that we pres­
ent on campus." 
SMC Monologues producer 
Ginger Francis said she was 
very pleased with the event's 
outcome. 
"When !audience members! 
walk out after the SMC 
Monologues, [they! will be 
changed forever," she said. 
"These monologues don't 
represent !everyone!. but 
many people ... I hope they 
will see diversity and break 
the image of there being a 
sole stereotypical Saint 
Mary's woman ... and they 
will suddenly realize they are 
not alone." · 
Junior Becky Susner said 
the SMC Monologues present­
ed an effective message to 
the College community. 
"I thought that it was a 
wonderful experience," she 
said. "It was interesting to see how issues at Saint Mary's are viewed in society." 
Junior Grace Guebnrt said the SMC Monologues were "empowering, memorable and moving." 
"They bring a stronger sense of sisterhood and sup­port to Saint Mary's," she said. 
Center for Women's lntereultural Leadership research analyst and mono­logues actress Joy Evans said the SMC Monologues serve as a "very powerful process for personal, as well as commu­nity healing and growth." 
"I hope people walk away realizing how amazing and complex SMC women ... arn and how important it is for every man and woman to make a personal commitment to end sexual violence in their communitins," Evans said.

Johnson said despite limited resources, NDSP attempts to monitor all parking zones, pay­ing particular attention to handicapped parking, reserved parking and fire lanes. 
"We tow cars after the fourth violation," Johnson said. 
The towing is meant to deter students from continuously paying fines and to open up parking spaces for authorized vehicles, Johnson said. Students who have cars regis­tered with the parking office receive a letter after their fourth violation to inform them their car will be towed on the next offense. 
Johnson said cars are towed immediately when parked in fire lanes or blocking traffic. 
"For some, having to pay a parking fine if cited for parking in the wrong place isn't enough incentive to make good parking decisions," he said. 
In the event a student feels he or she does not d·eserve a park­ing fine, the student can appeal the ticket twice. All appeals and fines for parking citations are addressed at the parking office in Hammes Mowbray Hall by the parking appeals committee,­which consists of students, fac­ulty and staff. 

NDSP is not involved in the appeals process, but does com­municate the decision of the committee back to the student. 
NDSP also receives feedback from the ad hoc parking com­mittee, made up of graduate and undergraduate students, to determine if any potential rule changes should take place regarding campus-parking reg­ulations. 
"Parking rules and fines are established to maintain order and safety on campus," Johnson said. "We hope that people will make good deci­sions when parking and driv­ing."

India fears outbreak of bird flu 
Poultry killed by thousands as officials work to prevent further spread of disease 
Associated Press 
NAVAPUH -Health offi­
eials and l'arm workers in 
protective clothing began 
slaughtering hundreds of 
thousands of chiekens in 
western India on Sunday, 
hoping to prevent the 
spread of tho deadly ll5N1 
bird nu virus. 
Europe stopped up its bat­lin against bird 11u as the European Union's top poul­try producer,. France, grap­pled with its lirst rnportod case of the lethal virus. 
Europnan poultry farmers said consumption has l~tllen and eausnd hundrnds of mil­lions of dollars in losses. Germany ordered somn birds killed on the Baltie Sea island of Hw~gen. The num­bnr of deadly flu eases in Italy rosn to 16. 
Indian ollkials rnported a 27-year-old poultry farm owner had died of' bird-llu­like symptoms. though tests had yet to detnrminn what killnd him. 
"At this juncture we can only suspnet that the cause of his death eould be bird l'lu,'' Sural district officer Vatsala Vasudov told the Press Trust of India news ageney. 
Workers in Navapur, a major poultry farming region in western Maharashtra state, dumped bird carcasses and gloves, goggles and blue gowns used by health teams into deep pits at poultry farms. 
Bird flu has devastated poultry stoeks and killed at least 91 people, mostly in Asia, since 2003, according to the World Health Organization. Most human eases of the disease have been linked to contact with infected birds. 
Scientists fear that the virus could mutate into a form that is easily transmit­ted among humans, spark­ing a pandemic. 
Since early Sunday, more than 200,000 chickens had been killed in Navapur of about 500,000 expected to be slaughtered within a 1.5­mile radius, said Anees Ahmed, the Maharashtra . state minister for animal husbandry. 


Poultry farms were dosod to everyone but health ofli­eials and workers in protec­tive gear. Chicken shops were shuttered. 
The government has banned the sale or transport of ehickens from the area, and checkpoints have been set up to inspect trucks. 
India exports some $84.4 million worth of poultry products a year to Europe, Japan and the Middle East, and has seen a rise in over­seas orders in the past year as countries such as Indonesia struggled to con­trol bird flu outbreaks. 
"Now countries will shut us out," said Ajit Hanade of the Bombay Veterinary College. 
Neighboring Nepal on Sunday said it was banning imports of all poultry and poultry products from India, while Bangladesh said it would step up surveillance along its border with India to prevent smuggling of birds into the country. 
In Egypt, authorities dosed the Cairo zoo after six of 83 birds that died there recently tested positive for the 115Nl strain. Health authorities said tests still had not found the disease in humans. 
Egyptian oflicials, mean­while, pleaded with citizens not to dispose of dead chick­ens, turkeys or other birds by throwing them in the roads, irrigation canals or thn Nile Hivin·. 
"More than <J() percent of the easns so far have bnen found in poultry kept in cages on roof.'i or balconies of apartment buildings. We ask the pnople to cooperat11 and not to dump anything into the Nile, please," llealth Minister I!atom Mustafa ol­Gabaly said.

Protests against cartoons escalate 
Associated Press 
ISLAMABAD -Pakistani security forces arrested hundreds of Islamic hard-liners, virtually sealed off the capital and used gunfire and tear gas Sunday to quell protests against caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. 
Pakistan had banned protests al'ter riots killed live people in two eitics last week. 
Elsewhere in tho Muslim world on 

Sunday, demonstrators with wooden staves and stones tried unsuccess­fully to storm the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia, while tens of thousands rallied in the Turkish city of Istanbul and complained about negative Western perceptions of Islam. 
Troops patrolled the deserted streets of the northnrn Nigerian town of Maiduguri, where thousands of Muslims attacked Christians and burned churches Saturday, killing at least 15 people during a protest over the cartoons. Most of the vie­Urns wern beaten to death by riot­ers. 
In Saudi Arabia, newspapers ran full-page apologins by .Jyllands­Postnn, the Danish newspaper that first ran tlw carieatures in September.

Yale 1 Sex Week' sparks debate 
Provocative annual events shock students, promote sexual awareness 
Associated Press NEW HAVEN, Conn. -In a lecture hall on Yale's storied Old Campus, not long after an after­noon astronomy class has cleared out, a middle-aged sex toy saleswoman demonstrates her technique and hands out free products to an eager crowd. "I want you to close your eyes," Patty Brisbon playfully instructs a young man as she rubs scented lotion into his forearm and, to raucous laugh­ter, reaches for an electric toy and a glove. "Fantasize about having an all-over body mas­sage." Welcome to Sex Week at Yale, a biennial celebration that has become one of the most provocative campus events in the country. Organizers say Sex Week gets students talking about sex in a way that's more relevant than middle-school film strips, more honest than movies and televi­sion, and more fun than requi­site college health lectures. "To get people's attention, we do have to do things a little risque and a little different than other sex education programs," said junior Dain Lewis, who was inspired to direct Sex Week 2006 after attending the 2004 event. Yale's event, which ends Saturday, includes lectures from dating specialists, a sex thera­pist and a discussion of homo­sexuality with a former Roman Catholic priest. More provoca­tive sessions include a panel of porn stars and stripping lessons from a Playboy Channel hostess. Critics say Sex Week is just the latest act of debauchery at colleges in recent years: Students started sex columns. Vassar and others created eroti­ca journals. Harvard launched H-Bomb, a magazine featuring suggestive pictures of under­graduates. Washington Univer­sity in St. Louis offered a sex­themed week with orgasm sem­inars and condom telegrams. "I don't see how bringing a Playboy stripper to campus is helping anything," said Travis Kavulla, editor of the Harvard 


Salient, which joined other con­servative newspapers in giving Sex Week the Collegiant Network 2004 Outrage Award. "How are universities trying to educate students in sponsoring activities like this?" 
Sex Week is a recognized stu­dent organization but Brisben's company, PureRomance.com, sponsors the events, not Yale. Advertising helps pay for mar­keting and for Sex Week at Yale, the Magazine. 
The magazine contains sex advice for men, help for select­ing the right condom and sug­gestions for women trying to satisfy themselves. 
Editors say they're promoting sexual awareness, not sex. The magazine includes an articie encouraging abstinence until marriage, a guide to healthy relationships and an essay on unrequited love. 
The interview with the porn star, organizers said, was just for fun. 
"It would seem like we were trying to intellectualize sex if we didn't have something on the other end of the spectrum," said Whitney Seibel, a senior psy­chology major who posed for the cover wearing only red panties and a strategically placed arm. 
About 25,000 copies were dis­tributed at Yale and on other campuses nationwide. The edi­tors are considering a second printing. 
While Yale may be giving off a flirty vibe this week, Brisben said she was surprised at how reserved the students were at her seminar. And for all their good grades, Brisbon said Yale students seemed less clued in about sex than students else­where. 

"I have a lot of inhibitions and fears that I'm not sure where they come from. And I don't know how common," saip Kaja · Wilmanska, a 20-year-old soph­omore from Poland. "It opens up the ground to talk about issues people aren't comfortable talking about otherwise. Basical-ly, I want to see what other people are saying." 
Students complain that the dating scene is notoriously com­plicated at Yale, where every grade matters, every extracur­ricular is essential and every­one is in competition. Last year, author Natalie Krinsky made that awkward scene the star of her novel "Chloe Does Yale." 
That's why Lewis says lec­tures such as Dating 101 are valuable. Lewis wants Yale to help other schools host their own versions. 
"In planning it, I'm saying, 'Could I justify the educational value of this to my mom?' If we can, we're in good shape," Lewis said. 

E-textbooks do not fulfill expectations 
Associated Press 
Brown University junior Stuart Thompson jumped at the chance to save $30 and become a digital pioneer when his school book­store offered a discounted, elec­tronic version of an American history textbook. 
But after making the purchase, he noticed a few things amiss: He couldn't run a highlight marker over key points or jot notes in the margins, nor could he curl up with the tome without printing out the pages. 
He won't rule out another e­book, but he's not completely sold, either. 
So much for the belief that this generation of youths is comfort­able with every­

Por the most part, e-books are merely electronic representa­tions of the printed pages. 
"It's like taking a book and ... trying to turn it into a movie just by trying to read pages," said Alexander Pereira, chief operat­ing officer of' Xplana Learning Inc., an education software com­pany that delivers e-books. "It's a different medium."

-I don't think a lot of people would find that a better way to read," Thompson said. 
Of the 100 or so students enrolled in the course where Houghton Milllin Co.'s "A People and a Nation" is assigned, Thompson was the only student to buy the electronic version. 
Brown is offering two other e­textbooks this semester, but none of the 150 students in those classes have bought one, even at 35 percent off the price of a new printed copy. 
Students are going to have to see more value in e-textbooks before they take off, said Larry Carr, Brown's director of book­store and services. 
For now, it is mostly a curiosity. 
"Students are pretty conserva­tive when it comes to their grades," said David Serbun, director of partnerships for Houghton Miffiin's college divi­sion. "Our research has indicat­ed they don't want to do any­thing that's a lot different than their peers."

How cane-books be more than print? 
Imagine a biology e-book showing video of DNA's double helix coming to life, rather than the two-dimensional illustration typically found in printed books. 
Or think of a math book with a built-in calculator or spreadsheet so students can try out formulas as they read. Waterloo Maple Inc.'s Maplesoft, for instance, is now making completely digital an advanced mathematical text­book that used to come with a CD. 
Publishers say that demand for digital-only editions and features isn't strong. 
More importantly, professors are demanding consistency with the printed versions so page numbers match and readings are easier to assign, said Sandi Kirshner, chief marketing officer for Pearson PLC's higher educa­tion group. 

More U.S. colleges offer Chinese 
Associated Press 
MUNCIE, Ind. -The hottest new export out of China these days? Its language. 
Nationwide, experts say there's been an unprecedented increase in the number of students study­ing Chinese at the college level. 
As China morphs into an eco­nomic world leader, more American schools are offering courses in the Mandarin lan­guage as a way to adapt to the future global economy, said Mindy Zhang, a Chinese instruc­tor for the Indiana Academy for Science, Mathematics and Humanities. Zhang also teaches Chinese courses as an adjunct professor at Ball State University, where interest in the foreign lan­guage is at a high. 
"For years I think Chinese has been looked upon as an 'exotic language,"' said Zhang, a native of Wuhan, China. "Now I think we are starting to see that per­ception change." 
In the past, Zhang typically welcomed about 15 or 16 stu­dents each semester to her intro­ductory Chinese course at Ball State. Last August, 28 students enrolled. 

Next fall, she anticipates Ball State will need a second-year Chinese course, the first time demand would fill a required class roster of at least 10 stu­dents. Previously, her second­and third-year Ball State stu­dents have taken classes with her students at the academy. 
Professors say the demand for Chinese courses has left their language departments scram­bling to keep up. 
Between 1998 and 2002, the Modern Language Association reports student enrollment in Chinese jumped 20 percent, to about 34,000 students. Studying in China is also on the rise, up 90 percent, to 5,000 students, between 2003 and 2004, accord­ing to the Institute of International Education. 
To keep up with demand, uni­versities may soon hire more language professors courtesy of the federal government's new National Security Language Initiative, launched by President Bush in January. 
The major goal of the initiative is to increase the number of Americans mastering what the government has defined "critical need foreign languages," which include Arabic, Russian, Hindi, Farsi and Chinese. Bush has requested $114 million to fund the efl'ort at the K -12 and colle­giate levels.

Courts question port takeover 
Involvement of Arab company in deal raises concerns about national security 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A com­pany at the Port of Miami has sued to block the takeover of shipping oper­ations there by a state­owned business in the United Arab Emirates. It is tho first American court­room effort to capsize a $6.8 billion sale already embroiled in a national debate over security risks at six major U . S. ports affected by the deal. 
The Miami company, a subsidiary of Eller & Company lnc., presently is a business partner with London-based Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co., which Dubai Ports World pur­chased last week. In a lawsuit in Florida circuit court, the Miami sub­sidiary said that under the sale it will become an "involuntary partner" with Dubai's government and it may seek more than $10 million in damages. 

The Miami subsidiary, Continental Stevedoring & Terminals Inc., said the sale to Dubai was prohibit­ed under its partnership agreement with the British l'irm and "may endanger the national security of the United States."

The American presidency has never been a truly open and honest institu­tion. It's a sad but accurate fact that needs changing at a time when nearly complete transparency is demanded of just about everyone else -including the media, major corpo­rations, Olympic ath­letes, private citizens engaged in overseas telephone calls and most other elected officials -for the preservation of a safe and equitable society. 
Franklin D. Hoosevelt, for instance, had an infamous relation­ship with the press in which, of the 140,000 photos taken of him during his presidency, only a handful showed him in leg braces or a wheelchair. As a result, much of the world was unaware that its most powerful resident was paralyzed from the waist down. John f. Kennedy, as well, managed to keep the media from revealing his legendary sexual exploits to the world thanks to an understanding that the president's private life was of no concern to the general public. 

Times have changed, however, and the day of the clandestine presidency is dead. Hichard Nixon's deviant behavior behind closed doors proved that the doors to the Oval Office must remain open to the oversight of the Fourth Estate. Bill Clinton, of course, found this out the hard way. 
Strangely enough, the George W. Bush White House seems to be under the impression that they can turn back the clock to a time in which public accountability and media transparency simply did not apply to the highest office in the land, to a time, as Richard Nixon famously argued in.a 1977 inter­view with television personality David Frost, when the President of the United States was above the laws of our democracy. 
LETTER TO THE EDITOR 


Joey 
Falco 
Forty Ounces 
In a speech on Friday to the Council on Foreign Relations, Donald Humsfeld accused the media of undermining U.S. foreign policy by focusing on negative aspects of the Iraq War instead of engaging in the propaganda battles being fought by a! Qaeda. "While al Qaeda and extremist movements have utilized this forum [the free-market mass media] for many years," he lamented, "We in the government have barely even begun to compete in reach­ing their audiences." 
Yes, the Secretary of Defense actually looked at the propaganda machines of our enemies (who operate in societies where an independent media is all but nonexistent) in lustful admiration. "For the most part," he said, "the U.S. gov­ernment still functions as a five-and­dime store in an eBay world." 
This is certainly an interesting posi­tion to take for a country that once put members of the Nazi propaganda machine on trial in Nuremberg on the grounds that "the results of propagan­da as a weapon of the Nazi conspira­tors reaches into every aspect of this conspiracy, including the atrocities and ruthless exploitation in occupied coun­tries. It is likely that many ordinary Germans would never have participat­ed in or tolerated the atrocities com­mitted throughout Europe had they not been conditioned and goaded by the constant Nazi propaganda," according to the prosecution at the Nuremberg trials. 
Apparently, based on Rumsfeld's remarks, propaganda in the American media would be exempt from this criti­cism, though, because encouraging "exploitation in occupied countries" is good as long as it is Bush-approved exploitation. 

Perhaps the most entertaining moment of Humsfeld's speech came when he complained that the press "seems to demand perfection from the government" on issues like Iraq and the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. (Is this guy for real?) Maybe in the world according to Humsfeld, the headline in the Washington Post on the day after 30 U.S. Marines were killed in a helicopter crash would have read "No Worries: 129,970 Soldiers Still Alive in Iraq." 
Like the Queen of Hearts in "Alice in Wonderland," Bush and Rumsfeld are faced with a reality of white roses in Iraq in which death and insurrection are everyday occurrences, yet they expect the media to do the "patriotic" thing and gloss over the truth with propaganda by painting the roses red. 
These expectations of a government­supportive media (something that will never again exist for Democratic administrations either, regardless of what Hush Limbaugh says about a lib­eral media bias) have also resulted in the most opaque presidency in modern history. Press Secretary Scott McClellan's frequent spats with NBC's David Gregory have generated lots of attention, but few people point out that Gregory's hostility would be the natural reaction for anyone who is unable to do their job properly because of the "loose lips sink ships" mentality of the Bush White House. 
The last straw, in the minds of most reporters, came last week after a man was shot by the Vice President of the United States for the first time in 202 years. One would have thought that a monumental event like this would have resulted in an immediate White House announcement followed by a rapid pub­lic apology and revelation of the seem­ingly innocent facts of the case. Dick Cheney had other plans in mind, though, and America was kept in the dark for nearly 18 hours while the gears of the White House spin machine were set in motion. 
Welcome to the new era of govern­ment propaganda: Why bother painting the roses red when you can pretend they never existed in the first place?

Is there another way? 
Many of us, whether we're for or against the war in Iraq, are aware that 2,268 Americans and roughly 30,000 civilians have already been killed in Iraq since March of 2003 ... but have we ever stopped to ask ourselves if there is another way? 

It is this question that drives the hearts of many who are involved in peace activism at Notre Dame. As we study Catholic social teaching and its implica­tions in our modern world, many of us have come to believe that war is incom­patible with human dignity and the com­mon good. War does not happen in a vacuum -it breeds a culture of death that intimately affects each member of society, tearing apart communities and indiscriminately killing, injuring or scar­ring all who cross its path.

just, eiTective solution to social problems, war strips all sides of their human digni­ty and greatly lessens a community's potential for co-existing in peace and resolving future conflicts. 

Thus, even in the face of grave human rights atrocities -we don't need war­we need an active, nonviolent engage­ment of the conflict, which includes dia­logue, disarmament, humanitarian aid and prayer, as a means to help us return to right relations with our neighbor. Some might scoff at these supposedly "unrealistic" suggestions, but Christ Himself set love as the measure for human dignity. Throughout the Gospels it is clear that He asks for nothing less. "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I say to you, love your ene-

mies, and pray for those who persecute you." (Matthew 5:44-45) 
If love is the answer, it is clear that war cannot adequately address the wounds of our time. While it might make us feel like we are "at least doing something," war is an ineffective remedy, a Band-Aid that will soon fall off, requiring even more violence to secure it. As we gather together this week to pray for peace and remember those who have been killed, I challenge you to let yourself be made uncomfortable when confronted with the consequences of war and to take the question seriously -is there another way?

Uncontroversial plays just as u.northodox 
1\l:eording to the text of' Univnrsity Prnsident Father .John .Jenkins' liu:ulty addrnss on tlw eontrovorsy over "The Vagina Monologlll~s" and the Queer Film Fnstival. he is c:onenrnod with possible eon­llkL'i bntwmm Notro Damn's role as a major research institution and its "Catholic ehar­aetnr." In order to mndiatn this tension, .lnnkins said, "Wn sonk, above all, the deep­er prindples that takn account of academie lh~ndom and our Catholie character." I think, then, it would bn usnful to probn the prindplns that would bn suggestod in the nlirnination offundraising or pnrlimning "The Vagina Monologuos" and amnnding or abolishing tho {lm1er Film Festival. Thoso opposnd to these event<.; opino that they conllid with Catholic moral tnac:hing and arn thus inappropriatn at a Catholic institu­tion. Ynt from Chaucer to Camus, nearly all of the major literary, philosophical and artistic works eneounternd at Notm Dame c:halllmge orthodoxy without nlidting seri­ous ol~jm:tion. 
I )ram a at Notrn Dame is no exception. Plays pnrli>rnwd at University faeilities and l'undod partially by ticket salos usually do not. advocatn Catholic thnology. Probing Jmkins's dich11 invocation of a play att.end­Pd by IIitier. the significance of a play by an unknown prinst turn1~d playwright in Bavaria is possibly questionable in iL<> artis­tic morit. Yet productions that can bn inter­prntnd as anti-Semitic arn routinely pnr­lilfmnd without being viewnd as against Catholic "valuns." Shaknspeare's "The Merchant ofVnnice," whil:h will bn present­c~d at Notre Dame this month, has not bmm rnjndml bncause it<> portrayal of Shylock 

eould be viewed as not in keeping with a Catholie ethos. Similarly, it is doubtful that Marlowe's "Jew of Malta" would be refused, despite it<> anti-Semitic overtones. 
Indeed, a brief review of upcoming the­atrieal performanees on eampus reveals a wide range of treatment<> that conniet with Catholicism. Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" suggest<> homosexual attraction and gender ambiguity. Osear Wilde's "Salome" tells the story of the young dancer who, after being sexually rejeeted by John the Baptist, asks 
.her infatuated stepfather, llerod, f(>r his head. After he is beheaded and his head brought out on a plate, Salome kisses his dead lips. This play, written by a homosexu­al, portrays themes of incest, sexual attrac­tion to a ehild and sexual desire trans­f(>rmed into violence. Similarly, I remember another production at Washington Hall a few years ago that featurnd a comie plot that violates Catholie sexual morals. Machiavelli's "The Mandrake" is the tale of an unmarried young man who desires to have sex with an unmarried virgin, although she wishes to remain a viq..,rin until marriage. Despite her rejection, he con­met<> an elaborate seheme involving the drug mandrake to triek her into sleeping with him. I recall no controversy over the presentation of this work, although its sex­ual content, though not as overtly explicit, is far less delimsible than the Monologues. 
Simply arguing that these works are eanoni"cal or historically signilieant is not justification enough to distinguish them from Eve Ensler's play. First, if we are indeed attempting to define "deeper princi­ples," then the stature of a writer like 
Questions to discuss 
Univ1rsity Prnsidtmt Father John Jenkins' rncnnt addrnssns on the subjeet of aeademic frnndom and Catholic cha.raetnr have rightly promptnd m1 intnnse discussion among nwmbnrs of our eommunity about what aca­dnmic rn~ndom is generally and, morn specif­ir.ally, about whether Notn~ Damn would infringn upon academk frendom by rnfusing to sponsor -or by IL'iking acadnmk unit.., not to sponsor -event<.; that are "n!..,>Tngious­ly contrary to or inconsistnnt with the funda­mnntal valuns of a Catholil: univnrsity." Such a dnbau~ is a hoalthy onn, nspneially at an institution that bdievns that iL<> aeademie and religious missions are inextrkably inter­twinc~d (or pnrhaps tlmt they are onn and tho samn). But Jenkins' invitation U> bn!..,rin such a discussion also snrves <L'i an opportunity to ronsidPr thn importlmcn of institutional idnn­tity mtd autonomy in the~ aeadnmy. A<> we 1H1gag1~ in thi'i dnbatn, wn shi)Uid not losn sight of thn important faet Uutt uniqtw aea­dPmil' institutions-dnfirwd by thnir mis­sions and tim dndsions that rnllnet those missions -snrvn a critical role in thn mar­kntplacn of idmL'i. lnstitutionai!L'>Sertions of identity nnhancn academic frnodom-they do not dntraet from it.

Considnr an nxampln: snvnral ynars ago, Yall~ Law School (my alma mau1r) announced that it would no longnr permit the Christian Lngal Society to interview on campus. Yale adoptnd this policy because the Christian IA~gal Sor.inty rnsnrves cnrtain high-levd positions li>r Christians. At thn tinw, I wrotn tlw dnan of thn law school to o~jnet. I argund that a lull eommitment U> n~li!..,rious lib1~rty n~quirnd Yale U> rnspnct the ( :hristian I ,ngal Society's institutional autono­my and noted that tlw Society's hiring prac­ticns wnrn in keeping with li1doral anti-dis-Machiavelli should not excuse a play that makes a joke out of coercing a woman into 

an unwanted sexual relationship. Moreover, since. "The Vagina Monologues" is a con­temporary work. we do not have the bonelit of distaneo in order to assess its signifi­cance and value. Thus, we must rely on the judgment of viewers and those involved in 
the theatrical and academic profession to assess il<> possible worth. It should be noted that "The Vaf..,rina Monologues" is consid­ered mainstream theater. It is widely known and performed internationally, and 
it is an influential force in current eultum. Based on the play's presence and renown, it has intrinsic signi(icance as an element of the present artistic landseape. Similarly, tho Queer Film Fostival is not only an acknowl­odgment of a very real community in our world, but it is also an aspeet of main­stream eultural research, what is known as queer theory. Beyond their indisputable eul­tural presenee, we must rely on the judg­ment of those that see these events (diOieult to do il"they are reduced or eliminated) and those prof{Jssionals who routinely study the art<>. Notre Dame has outstanding literature and theater faculties, and it i<> their profes­sional judgment that both evenl<> have aca­demic and artistic merit. To substitute an inartieulato prineiple (one that, as I have argued, Notre Dame really does not con­form to) for the assessment of trained scholars is insulting and short-sighted, par­ticularly in light of eurrent trends in tho field of evolutionary biology. 
What, then, is the real objection to "The Vagina Monologues" and the Queer Film Festival, an objection that ean be reason­ably implmnentod in the future'? Tho dis­tinetion between censorship and sponsor­ship is not porsuasive. Firstly, I would argue that Ensler incorporates fund raising into her artistic oxpression, adVI)(:ating a typo of sodally-aetive theatnr. Thus, to eliminato that would bn to eensor a major aspect of the play's message. Evon barring that, there is no discernable diflimmee betwmm the type of sponsorship shown to the Film Festival and that ofSalonu1. lndnnd tim only noticeable difference is that both disputnd prnsentations have provocative words in the titln, something that could hardly bn sustained as a guideline for tho futuro. 
Ultimatnly, the guiding prindple of rnject­ing those works that arn "dnarly and egrn­giously at odds with Catholie valuns" is not and never has been upheld at Notrn Damn -and for good reason. The role of litera­turn and art is to challnnw~ our value sys­tems. It is thn ability to dPstabilizn our bnlinfs that distinguishes so many groat eul­tural expressions. We are left to condude that Jnnkins is not advocating a dnarly­defined and supported prindple, but rather allowing a hypocritical self-righteousness to propagatn based on nothing more than reaetionary philistinism. And li>r those who are concerned with Christian morality, I would recommend looking up .Jnsus's corn­mnnl'i li>r the hypoeritieal Pharisnos. Some might eonsider that a fairly clnar prindplo for our futuro.

On Wednesday, Feb. 16, 2006, the Student Senate unanimously passed two resolutions -"Expressing the Will of the Student Body for the Implementation of a Living Wage" and "Supporting the Creation of a Living Wage Joint Task Force." While their titles may be lengthy, these resolu­tions seek one thing-justice for campus workers. 
A living wage would help workers to stop living from paycheck to pay­check. As the Senate resolution states, "The typieal starting wage for full­time employment as a Notre Dame staff member is $6.45 to $10.17 an hour." With wages this low, far too many workers are forced to work multiple jobs and even qualify for food stamps. A Jiving wage of $12.10 an hour would elevate eampus workers above the federal poverty line. 
One goal of Notre Dame, as outlined by the mission statement, is to culti­vate students with "a disciplined sen­sibility to the poverty, injustice and oppression that burden the lives of so many." Students of the Senate and Campus Labor Action Project have 
answered that call with vigor. University President Father John Jenkins now has a unique opportunity. 
Jenkins ean maintain Notrn Dame's role as a moral leader by forming a task force of workers, students and faeulty to implement a campus living wage. Since 1842, the University has not usnd the status quo or morn mar­ket forces to dictate its aetions. Thn course of this University has bonn guided by one thing-Catholic val­ues. Popn John XXIII wrote that work­ers have the "right to a wagn dntnr­mined by the criterion ofjustiee." As a Catholic institution committed to Catholic charaeter, we are required to uphold the values of Catholie sodal teaching. With the implmnentation of a living wage, Jenkins can assure that every worker is treated as a member of the Notre Dame family. We cannot allow Our Lady's University to be a place where injustiee and poverty can thrive.

This sense of global appreciation was .clearly felt in the choir's performance on Saturday, and the "world music" label commonly slapped onto groups of this type or origin, in this case did the choir's multicultural identity and international audience a subtle justice.

The concert fully lived up to this mission by putting it into joyfully contagious spirit and action. The choir performed beauti­fully, with a tangible sense of elation and praise that undoubtedly spread to the audience.

MOVIE REVIEW 
Predictable, irreverent 'Waiting ...' still humorous 
By MARK BEMENDERFER A.sistant Scene Ediwr 
Hyan Heynolds is quickly becoming the aetor of choke for collegn students everywhore. Through his starring role in "Van Wildnr" and cameo appeat­ancn in "llarold and Kumar Go To White Castle," Hnynolds has devclopod an on-screen persona that is oasily idnntif"iable and often hilarious for viewers. 
In "Waiting... ," Reynolds' latest movin releasnd on DVD, he plays his trademark charactor. Sarcastic, witty and sonwtimes insightful, Heynolds ads as tho odgy quasi-jerk character namod Monty. Promiscuous and self­<:entnrnd. it is the ro!P that Heynolds has masternd to a seienee and makes for an <mjoyable vi11wing. 
Monty, along with a cast of colorful eharaetnrs, works in a family restau­rant called Shenanigans. Loosely based on snvnral wnll-known chains, Slwnanigans manages to look instant­ly familiar despitn boing completely fietitious. Handom kniek-knaeks hang on the walls, and the atmosphere will lw rm:ognizablo to most viewers. 
Tho title of thn r11staurant is surpris­ingly appropriate for the movie, as cheeky shenanigans rule the film. Irreverent and entertaining, "Waiting... " doesn't try to pass itself ofT as high-art. It plays out more like Heynolds' previous movies, although at moments it does get slightly seri­ous. 
It's structured like one would expect, with the aforementioned col­orful east. 
Each of the expected stereotypes is present, but they remain interesting despite their predictable nature. Justin Long plays Dean, one of Monty's friends who isn't exactly sure what he wants from life. Meandering through a community college, his lack of solid direction may mirror many students-making him an identifiable character. 
The manager of Shenanigans is the old guy who tries too hard to be eool and yet is simply too far removed from his employees to really understand thnm. There is also the waitress who openly hates her job, but manages to hide her distaste from the customers. 
The rest of the characters also fill out rather one-dimensional roles, but this shallowness doesn't necessarily hinder thn movie. They are the char­
acters that one finds in any teen or college com­edy, and they are more likable because of their familiarity. 
The movie takes place over a single day, show­ing a full 24 hours in the lives of the members of the restaurant. What happens after the day isn't explained and may leave some viewers with questions, but this lack of explanation is excusable, as it doesn't detract f'rom the humor. 


The special features for "Waiting... " are fairly diverse as well. The DVD comes in a two-dise unrated deluxe edition. In the special features are the usual extras, such as outtakes, deleted scenes, alternate takes and commen­taries. Some of them are entertaining, but most were not used in the film for obvious reasons. 
Two features, sueh as "Sending it back: The Real Dish on Waiting 
Tables" and "That-Little Extra docu­mentary" help round out the packago by elaborating on some of tho seenns ­in the movie, adding some helpful background material. 
"Waiting... " is meant to bo a rathor predictable, cheesy movie. Taken in that light, it's very entertaining and fills the role well. But those looking for a deep, meaningful film should explore other venues.

Luck runs out in Las Vegas 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 
The Irish got off to a slow start this weekend by dropping three out of five games in the UNLV Desert Classic. The team played doubleheaders on Friday and Saturday and finished the trip with an early game Sunday morning against Cal State Fullerton. 
"The trip did not go exactly as planned, because we walk into every contest expecting to win," senior pitcher Heather Booth said. "However, we did learn a lot about ourselves as a team." 
Friday's first game was a 5-4 loss to Colorado State. 
Rams' pitcher Kim Klabough was only three outs away from throwing a no-hitter until the

-
Irish bats woke up in the sev­enth inning. Freshman Liiida Kohen brought the Irish within one with a three-run home run in her first career game. The shot was the frrst of three that she hit while in Vegas. Despite coming up short, Notre Dame was able to take momentum and a little more 
confidence into the second game of the day against BYU. Mallorie Lenn had the big hit for the Irish in the contest with a grand slam in the sixth inning that gave them an 8-3 win. 
Brittney Bargar· earned the win in her pitching debut, going 4 1/3 innings and giving up only two runs on three hits. 
"I think that Bargar did a great job handling her first weekend out as a freshman," Booth said. "She is a fighter and worked hard out there." 
Bargar did not wait long for an encore performance against the host Rebels of UNLV. The win came only a few hours after being shut out by a strong Oregon State team, 5-0. 
Just like the day before, the Irish were able to bounce back, beating UNLV 6-4. Notre Dame jumped out to an early lead with a five-run third inning. Kohen (2-for-3) added another with a homer down the right field line in the fourth, and Booth came in to close the door as the Irish evened their record at 2-2. 
The seesaw weekend con­cluded with a 9-3 loss to Cal State Fullerton. The Titans used the long ball -eight of their nine runs came on home runs -to pull away early, as well as fight off any comeback from the Irish. Ashlee Van Boxmeer hit two of the shots, while Jenna Wheeler added a third to seal the Titan victory in the fifth inning. 
The one bright spot for Notre Dame in the game was Kenya Fuemmeler, who gave up only one run after coming in to pitch the final three innings. 
Team members were in rela­tively good spirits following the tough stretch, focusing on their potential for a successful year. The Irish will try to make a few changes before heading to Miami next weekend for a simi­lar tournament hosted by Florida International. 
"We have a lot to improve on but are by no means deflated after the weekend. We realize it's not about where we start, but where we finish," Booth said.

Midwest povverhouses await tea111 in Florida

Notre Dame begins its fall sea­son today at the Central District Classic in Parrish, Fla. The tour­nament is hosted by Michigan State and will be played today and tomorrow at the River Wilderness Golf Club. 
The Irish are looking to improve on last year's perform­ance, which saw them finish 13th out of 15 teams. This year, the team traveled to Florida a few days early to sharpen its game before its spring debut by prac­ticing on the par 72, 6,099-yard course. 
This year, the sixth-seeded Irish will face off against a field of 14 other teams, most of which are from the Midwest region ­Baylor, Illinois State, Kansas, Kansas State, LSU, Michigan, Michigan State, Missouri, Nebraska, Northwestern, Ohio State, SMU and Texas Tech. 
"All except for three teams are within 1 0 spot<; of us in the rank­ings. We're thirty-fifth overall, and most of the other teams are within 25 to 45." 
The Irish will go with a lineup of Noriko Nakazaki, Usa Maunu, Katie Brophy, Lauren Gebauer and Suzie Hayes. 
"Nakazaki consistently plays really well and finishes at the top of every tournament that she enters," Brophy said. "I usually play pretty well. Everyone's games are coming on right now. Everyone has been working real­ly hard to play well, in this tour­nament and the rest." 
The Irish also have clear cut goals for the tournament. 
"[We hope to 1 break 300 for all three rounds, break 295 for one round and remain patient and persistent," Brophy said. 
After the Classic, the squad has a few weeks off until it plays in the 'Mo' Moria! in Bryan, Texas March 10-12.

DAYTONA BEACII, Fla. -Maybe Jimmie Johnson didn't need to clwat to win his first Daytona 500. 
Johnson won a two-lap shootout Sunday to claim tho victory, capping a roller-coaster week that saw NASCAH kiek his crew r.hief out of competition for dwating. 
Johnson had a strong car when he arrived at Daytona International Spomlway 10 days ago, and posted the fifth-fastest time in time trials. But when NASCAH gave his Chevrolnt a caref'ul oncP--over, inspec· tors discovered that Chad Knaus had made an illegal modilication. 

Knaus was sent home, seemingly spoiling Johnson's shot to win The Gmat Amnrican Hace. 
Not on this Sunday. 

"I know deep down inside my heart that this team could still win this race," Johnson said in Victory Lann. "There's no doubt that not having Chad here was a hugo ha11dieap, but evorybody stepped up. I am just so proud of this team." 
Johnson stay1~d calm and avoided trouble in a wild racP. that saw Tony Stewart oliminatn thnw contenders: Jeff Gordon, Matt Knnseth and himself. Then Johnson worked his way to the front. staying in line and waiting for his chance to pounce.

Hot doubles pairings give team two top 25 wins 
By DAN TAPETILLO Sports Writer 
In order to be the best, you have to compete with the best. 
The Irish held themselves to this maxim this weekend in wins over No. 9 Harvard and No. 22 Tennessee at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. Notre Dame remained undefeated and improved its record to 7-0 this year -its best start since the 1985-86 season. Also, the upset over Harvard marks the team's second win against a top-10 foe in 2006, fol­lowing the victory over then-No. 9 North Carolina on Feb. 12. 
In their match against the Crimson, the Irish began the con­test by sweeping the doubles matches, including a win from the No. 1 pairing of Catrina and Christian Thompson. The twins topped Harvard's No. 6 duo of Melissa Anderson and Elsa O'Riain 9-8 (7-5) to earn the dou­bles point. 
The Thompsons needed to overcome a 6-5 deficit and an eventual tiebreaker to top Anderson and O'Riain. 
"They were down most of the match," Irish sophomore Brook Buck said. "They really fought back and played big on the big points." 
In addition to the Thompsons' victory, Notre Dame's No. 35 pair­ing of Buck and freshman Kelcy Tefft downed Harvard's Stephanie Schnitter and Eva Wang, 8-1. Notre Dame's No. 45 duo of seniors Kiki Stastny and captain Lauren Connelly also won by an 8-1 decision over Harvard's Cindy Chu and Preethi Mulmndan. 
In singles, No. 24 Catrina Thompson led the team with her come-from-behind win over Harvard's Eva Wang 6-4, 3-6, 1-0 (10-1) at No.1. 
Following at No. 2 was Christian Thompson, who suf­fered a 7-5, 7-5 loss to O'Riain. 

Buck played at No. 3 for the Irish with a 7-6 (7 -4), 6-0 win over Anderson. During the con­test, Anderson suffered a code violation during the first set after hitting a ball into another court ­granting Buck a point. Following the call, Anderson appeared to have lost her sense of momentum. 
"The first set was very intense, and we were both on our serves." Buck said. "But then she got a code violation and mentally just broke down and stopped fighting ... I've never played a match like that before." 
Following Buck's contest against Anderson, Tefft topped the Crimson's No. 67 Mukundan and clinched the victory for the Irish at No.4. 
Stastny, playing at No. 5 for Notre Dame, lost her first dual match in singles this season. Stastny dropped the contest to Schnitter 7-6 (7-5), 3-6, 1-0 (10­5). 
Competing at the No. 6 position for the Irish, freshman Katie Potts downed Chu 6-1, 6-2. 
No. 15 Notre Dame 7 No. 22 Tennessee 0 
The Irish defeated the Lady Vols 7-0 to earn their second shutout ofthe season. 
Notre Dame began the contest sweeping the doubles matches for the fifth time in sixth matches. 
The Thompsons, playing at No. 1 for the team, finished first as they topped Tennessee's Melissa Schaub and Ghizela Schutte 8-1. 
"This win defmitely helped our confidence," Christian Thompson said. "But knowing we have two other great doubles teams relieves a lot of the pressure." 
Following at No. 2 were Buck and Tefft, who defeated the Lady Vols' Blakeley Griffith and Victoria Jones, 8-3. Last off the court were Connelly and Stastny, who downed Tennessee's Stephanie Harris and Samantha Orlin, 8-3. 
In singles, Stastny was first off the court as she cruised to her 15th victory of the season with a win over Harris 6-3, 6-1 at No. 5. 
Playing at No. 2 was Catrina Thompson, who fmished second for the team as she topped Jones 6-1,6-2. 
Buck followed Thompson with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Schutte as she clinched the victory for the Irish at the No. 3 position. 
Tefft and Potts defeated Schutte 6-3, 6-4 and Orlin 7-5, 5-7 1-0 (12-10) at Nos. 4 and 6, respec­tively. 
No. 44 Christian Thompson closed out the victory with a long match against Griffith. Thompson came out with the 5-7, 7-6 (7-3), 1-0 (10-3) win.

Win pushes Irish past Wolverines in all-tim_e victories 
By KATE GALES Associate Sports Editor 
After struggling earlier this sea­son, Notre Dame extended its win­ning streak to five matches this weekend, improving to 7-4 with a win at Michigan. 
The Irish topped the Wolverines 5-2 in a closely-fought match Saturday night between two of college tennis' most winning pro­grams. Notre Dame is No. 7 in all­time wins with 1,020 after Saturday's victory, while Michigan is No. 8 with 1,012. 
"It was a very tough, tense match," Irish coach Bobby Bayliss said. "[Michigan] played extremely hard, they competed well -our guys, to their credit, took Michigan's best shots and had a little more left at the end." 
The Irish were upset by a lower­ranked team in the doubles point for the first time this season, as they struggled to get on the boards and ended up losing two of the three matches. 
"They were all over us," Bayliss said. "They were approaching a lot -they're very active at the net, and they were returning aggressively." 
Ryan Keckley and Barry King fell at No. 1 to Brian Hung and Matko Maravic, 8-6, and Scott Brockmann and Steve Peretz clinched the point at No. 3 with an 8-6 win over Brett Helgeson and Andrew Roth. 
"Michigan came out with early breaks in all three matches and really put us back on our heels ... we got down in all three matches and never really caught up," Bayliss said. 
But Eric Langenkamp and Sheeva Parbhu pulled out a close win at No. 2, defeating Ryan Heller and Andrew Mazlin 9-8 (7­
3) to avoid the sweep. 
The Irish were down 1-0 going into the singles portion of the match and were soon down 2-0 after Parbhu lost to Maravic 6-3, 6-4 at No.2.

However, Stephen Bass rallied to top Hung 7-5, 6-2 at No. 1 to put the Irish back on the boards. The team never looked back, reel­ing off four more singles victories for the win. 
"Stephen deserves a ton of cred­it for fighting off Hung, who had beaten him in the semifinals of the regional championships a year ago [in 2004]," Bayliss said. Helgeson dropped his second set, but won 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 at No. 3 to tie the match at 2-2. 
Captain Patrick Buchanan, play­ing at the No. 6 spot after King left with an ~jury, won 1-6, 6-3, 6-1 to put the Irish one match away from the win. 
"I think [Patrick] started off slow," Bayliss said. "I think [Bruckmann] put Patrick back on his heels but Patrick was able to step up in the court and begin to dictate." 
Keckley clinched the match at No. 4 with a 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 win over Heller. 
"Ryan has been so good for us this year," Bayliss said. "He has become our strongest point. He broke serve to win the match at 5­3 in the third -he was actually

Three-point weekend puts home ice in reach 
Hy CHRIS KHOREY 
Sports Writer 
In a w1wknnd snrins crucial in tlwir quost to narn homo ic:e advantagn for lhn f'irst round of' tho eonf'nrt~nee playoff's, the Irish nolclwd a 7-4 win and a 1-1 tin Friday and Saturday, rnspnctivnly, in gamos at Bowling Grnnn. 

Tlw eon lnsts boostnd Notrn Dame thrnn points in the standings and left tlw Irish in a thn~n-way tin with Alaska­Fairbanks and Ferris Statn for eighth in thn CCIIA and the l'inal homn ien spot. Thn Irish (12-16-4. 10-12-4 CCIIAI will takn on thn Nanooks in two games, thnir last of tho regular snason, at the Joycn Centnr this wneknnd. The Bulldogs f'at:n No. R Michigan. 
"Everybody that's vying for anywhnre from fifth to 1Oth will son thnir situation chango with nvnry gamn next wonk," Notrn Damn c:oach JolT Jaekson said of tlw CCI lA's linal wonk­end. 
Friday's contnst betwnnn tho Fa!eons and Irish featured 11 goals, 14 penalties and a wildly bouncing puck. 
"It's likn playing pinball, with pueks bouneing all over the plaen,'' Jackson said of' Bowling Green's home arena. "Thny have partitions in the glass and the eorners are kind of square. The boards are pretty lively, too." 
Jaeks<in crt~dited the wild play to two emotional t11ams playing a very important game. 
"Friday's gamo was really emotional, really high intensi­ty," hn said. "Somntimes their emotion got them in trouble, and sometimes our nmotion got us in trouble." 
The Irish won Friday's wild shootout thanks to three goals from forward Mark Van (;uilder who, after a position switch, lit the lamp for the sixth, seventh and eighth time this year. 
"We moved him to center, whnre he's handling the puck more," Jackson said. "He was generating chances of'f' the rush and taking advantage of' 
it." 
The seven goals scored by the Irish were the most since Nov. 10. when they scored nine in a home gamn against Bowling Grnnn. 
"!The Falcons] worn really wide open and we took advan­tage," Jackson said of' Friday's contest. "Thny put their goal keeper into an awkward posi­tion with their penalty killing and some of' the odd man rush­es we had." 
Notrn Dame junior goalie DavP. Brown did not play Friday al'ter suffering an ill­ness for most of the week. lie was replaced by freshman Jordan Pearee, who started his first game since Dee. 2 and made 34 saves. 
"[Brown! missed Monday and Tuesday, and he practiced Wednesday but not very effec­tively," Jackson said. "It worked out OK, though, because I wanted to give Jordan a game, anyway. Playing all those games in a row, David's not going to be as fresh when we need him to 

be." 
Brown, who had started the last 22 contests l'or the Irish, was baek in net Saturday, where he made 34 saves and allowed just ono goal. 
Jackson said Saturday's game was mueh more subdued than Friday's, which led to the lower score. 
"There was more discipline in the game Saturday," he said. "I also think BowI i ng GI'IH~ n played a much better defensive game Saturday night. I thought their goaltendnr !Jimmy Spattl settled down and played much better."

The Irish waited almost two periods to answer before del'enseman Wes O'Neill led a breakaway, passing to forward Matt Amado. Amado's shot was deflected, but forward Josh Sciba pushed in the rebound to even the game up.

Hope led 50-27 at halftime and widened its lead to as many as 41 points during the second period. 
"Their offense was almost impossible to stop," Belles head coach Steve Bender said. "We put up a lot or points, but they are a great team." 
For Saint Mary's, Bridget Boyce reached another mile­stone just one game after becoming the sixth Belle to scorn 1,000 career points. Against Hope, Boyce hit her 129th career three-pointer to set a school record. She scored 16 points in a losing effort.

On Tuesday, the Belles will host an MIAA playoff game for the lirst time in school history. They will take on Alma College, a team they defeated twice during the regular sea­son. 
Alma finished the snason with a 7-9 eonferenco record. 
Bendnr is very optimistic as his team prepares for the post­season tournament. 
"We did a lot of things well today so we're vnry excited about this game," hn said.

-nearly every event saw an Irish athlete add to the point total, which was eventually enough to come away with the win. The Irish women finished as runners-up in the confer­ence championships the past three seasons after winning in 2002. 
"I feel good. I'm really happy about the team and the way everyone pushing everyone else," Erigha said. "I feel like we really bonded this weekend. It was really a collective effort -everyone made a difference in how it all turned out." 
"I think we're all really excit­ed -we went in with the expectation of winning, and we met it," Madia said. "It's a great feeling, and a big relief." 
The Irish men finished in third place with 94.5 points, trailing first-and second-place finishers Connecticut (135) and Hutgers (124). 
Junior Thomas Chamney did his part in the team's top-three finish, winning the 800-meter run (1 :49.88) and anchoring the Irish to victory in the 4x800 meter relay (7:28.84). 
The Irish now look ahead to the Alex Wilson Invitational, slated to take place at the Loftus Sports Center March 3­4. 
That will be the last meet before the NCAA Indoor Championships are held at Fayetville, Ark. during the weekend of March 10-11. 
The Alex Wilson Invitational will also be the last opportunity for members of both teams to qualify for the NCAA meet. 
However, after an impressive showing ·at the Big· East Championship, the team is looking to spend some time resting during the next few days and· working to perfect certain detailed aspects of events in time for the next meet. 
"This week, we'll probably take a step back, rest, and work on a few technical things, fine tuning before the Alex Wilson meet," Erigha said. 
"We'll just make sure we're recovered, get to work, and go and get ready to have a lot of NCAA qualifying runs at the Alex Wilson."

total of the snason in a 102-91 vietory over Snton IIall (16-H, 7­
5) in l:ast Huthnrford, N.J. 
"Thorn's nothing likn winning," Notre Dame coach Mike Brey said Sunday bnforn practice. 
Notrn Dame point guard Chris Quinn led all scorers with 34 poinl'i, and shooting guard Colin Falls scored a career-high 32 points on I 0-of-17 shooting (H­of-15 from :~-point range). The players eombirwd for morn than half of their tmun 's total. 
"J~spedally when [Colin [ is hit­ting shots. it makes us a much tougher team to guard," Quinn said Sunday. " ... We've got a rhance to still be a pretty good team." 
Tho Pirates ontornd the game frnsh oil' a 71-64 defeat of West Virginia Fnb. 14 but led only twkn in tho first fnw minutes bPii1re Notre Damn took eontrol of tlw pacn. Seton llall struggled to dofnnd iL'i opponent filr tlw full 40 minutes. 
The Irish wnre able to protect their lead by shooting H6.H pnr­<~nnt (:B-of-:~Hl from tho free throw linn, led by Quinn's pnrfilct 14-of-14 from the stripe. The team led H0-(J7 with 3:05 rnmaining after Falls sank one of his night 3-pointers. Then Pirates guard Jamar Nutter answered from deep to eut the lead to 10. 
The Irish converted just one field goal the remainder of the game on a dunk at 1:32 by for­ward Hiek Cornett. who made the frne throw to complete his seven-point. eight-rnbound per­formance. 
But Notre Damn made 20 of its 21 fme throws li1llowing Nuttnr's thrn<l, and Snton llall rwvnr got clos«l enough to joopardizn the Irish winning llulir third straight. 
"Wp'rn going to make plays and fight to the end in every ganw," Falls said. "If we get a lead, I think we can protect it because we can shoot free throws." 
Seton llall fell despite having four scorers in double l'igures and roceiving 28 points from guard Donald Copeland, who at points was the only scoring option on the floor for the strug­gling Pirates. 
Nuttor exploded at the end of the first half for seven points in the linal two minutes to cut a 12­point Notre Dame lead to eight at half, with the Irish up 44-36. But Notm Dame forced Pirates coach Louis Orr to use a timeout less than two minutes into the second half. 
Irish guard Hussell Carter (17 points, eight rebounds) and Falls each hit threes, and Falls sank a two-point bucket as well to score the hairs first eight points before Seton Hall had gottnn off morn than one lield goal attempt. 
"Thoy gave us a pretty good punch at the end of the half," Brey said. " ... We had playP.d so well up until that point. I thought we did a good job and show some maturity to respond and open up the half with a punch right back." 
Pirates forward Kelly Whitney scored the game's first points and gave his team one of its two total loads in the game at 2-0. Alter the teams exchanged leads, Whitney tied the game at 9-9 with 15:04 remaining. 
But Irish li>rward Hob Kurz (11 points. 9-of-1 0 free throws) fol­lownd a Torin Francis miss at the 
14:00 mark to take tho lead for good. 
"Winning a big one like that on the road givns you a little added conlidencn," Quinn said. "After what this team has been through, it does feel good to get on a little streak here. Three games in a row might not be much. hut it does !eel good." 
Notrn Dame's season-high pre­vious to Saturday's outburst came in a 100-97 double-over­time loss to Pittsburgh Jan. 4. 
Saturday's win means Notre Dame has the same B"ig East record as Louisville and Providence (4-8), but the Irish would qualify if the Big East Tournament began tomorrow. 
The Irish would lose a tiebreaker to Louisville but would earn the 12th and l'inal spot in the tournament, having defeated Providence 92-77 on Jan. 14. 
Seton Hall is seventh in the conference and less than a game ahead of Cincinnati (7 -6). 
Notes: 
+ Francis scored just one point Saturday to add to Cornett's soven points. but the Notre Dame frontcourt had a much larger impact than the box score indi­cated. 
The seniors collected 18 rebounds combined and neutral­ized Seton Hall's leading scorer, Kelly Whitney. 
Whitney l'inished with 14 points but scored the majority down the stretch. when the Irish were trying not to foul and were avoiding the contact Whitney normally creates. 
Pirates coach Louis Orr also played starting center Grant Billmeier just 15 minutes. Billmeier was ineffective early and finished with two turnovers. two rebounds and no points. 
"Our big guys-if we're gonna make a run at New York -are going to have to be really good the rest of the way," Brey said. 
+ Back in black? 
Notre Dame's offensive out­burst oecurred in its first game wearing the new black jerseys with grnen trim. So will the team wnar the uniforms again? 
"We needed to change some­thing up," Falls said. "We didn't even know until Friday, and they look sharp. It was pretty cool, and I think wn'll stick with them."

In that span; the lluskies were able to repeatndly take advantage of open jumpors set up ofl' the drive. 
"The guards did a poor job of finding the shooters," McGraw said. 
But the Irish wero able to reeov­er [rom the deficit. and by half­time had cut the load to 37-33. In the second half. tho Irish came out strong, erasing tho gap ;md taking a one-point load twice in tho first six minutes. 
Notre Dame was never able to nxtend its lead. however. as Connecticut always count.Prnd any Irish threat -generally with a 3­pointnr. The Huskies, who worn 1 0-of-19 from bnyond tlm are, had thrnn players shoot over 50 per­cent from 3-point range, induding St.rotlmr, who was 5-oi~H. 
"Thny just had too many wmtpons lbr us," McGraw said. 
As the dP.fieit began to grow, Notre Dmne comebaek attmnpl'> were stymied in part by Connecticut's relnntless elli1rl'i to shut down snnior point guard Megan Dully. the team's loading offensive weapon. DuiTy. who scored 11 points on just 2-of-7 shooting and playnd all 40 min­utes. appeared to hrrow fittigund as the game wont on and got more physical. 
Dully's shooting troubles also extended to the free-throw line. where she shot just 6-9, well bPlow hor season average of 91 porcnnt. 
"I thought that I should have given Megan a rest during tho gam<l," MeGraw said. "She was just dnli~ndnd so wnll. and they played her so hard." 
In light of the delimsive ell'ort against Duffy, guard Brnona Gray steppnd up hnr gamn, seoring 12 points behind 5-of-6 lield goal shooting, making her one of fi1ur Irish players to seon1 in doubln fig­urns. 
"I thought Brnona had just. a great game," McGraw said. "I thought she looked to att.aek tlw basket oUlmsivnly."

Drowning the competition 
Men win back-to-back Big East crowns, women take record tenth straight 
By JACK THORNTON Sports Writer 
The Irish blew the competi­tion out of the water this weekend in East Meadow, N.Y., as the men's team captured its second consecutive Big East Championship. 
The Irish won by 224.5 points (809-584.5) over second place Pittsburgh, a smaller margin of victory than last year's surprising 275-point spread. Nonetheless, the Irish left no doubt about it in domi­nating the other 10 Big East opponents. 
"We won by a lot last year and that surprised a lot of peo­ple, but we're better this year," sophomore Jay Vanden Berg said. "The training is better, the attitude is better and the confidence was better, because we were returning champions, and I had a feeling that we were going to kind of run away with it." 
The squad jumped out to a 12-point lead after the first day, stretching that into a 77­point lead after day two and producing a comfortable 127.5-point margin heading into the final day. Despite the lead, junior Ted Brown wasn't about to coast to the podium.

Although it had to hold off a determined Rutgers team, Notre Dame returned to South Bend victorious this weekend after capturing its 1Oth straight Big East title Saturday night in East Meadow, N.Y. 
Notre Dame's victory gives it a place in history, as the Irish have tied the record for the most consecutive Big East titles in any sport. 
The Irish women now share that honor with the Pittsburgh men's swimming and diving team, which won every year from 1983-92. 
The Irish and Scarlet Knights went back and forth over the course of the four-day meet. 
Rutgers led for the first two days, as the Irish trailed by 12 points at the end of day one and only six points at the end of day two. 
Notre Dame surged ahead on day three, but it held only a slim five-point edge heading into the final session Saturday night. 
That tight margin was erased as Rutgers came back to tie the meet -both teams having accumulated 587.5 points with only three events

Men finish in top three for t~e 11th consecutive season 
By JASON GALVAN Sports Writer 
The Irish track and field team came up big in Akron, Ohio this weekend, with the women's team taking home the Big East Conference Indoor Championship and the men finishing third for their 11th straight finish among the top three at this meet. 
The women ended their dramatic Sunday run with 
109.5 points, surging past second-place Georgetown 
(86) and erasing a late 18­point deficit. 
"Everyone did a great job," senior distance runner Stephanie Madia said. "It just shows our ability to work together as a team." 
Though the Irish finished with only one individual win on the day -junior Maryann Erigha's 200­meter dash victory (23.96)

New look sparks victory 
Irish throttle rival Pirates on the road in uncommon attire 
By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 

Seton Hall fought the inevitable Saturday at Continental Airlines Arena, but a new-look Notre Dame team (13-10, 4-8 Big East) would not relinquish the lead on its way to a third consecu­tive win. 
Motivated by their new black jerseys or their desper­ate need for conference wins -or both -the Irish scored their highest single-game
