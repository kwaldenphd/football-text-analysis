Judge rules against Danehy in lawrsuit 
by Mike Shields News Editor 

Ruling that Notre Dame ''has a uniform policy for ending its contracts but has no uniform policy regarding retirement,'' Starke County Circuit Court Judge Marvin McLaughlin has upheld the Universiry's right to retire professors as they reach the age of 65. 
James P. Danehy, professor emeritus of Chemistry, filed suit after the University forced him to retire from teaching when he turned 6 5 in 1977. He charged that the University's retirement policl is "arbitrary" because severa faculty mem­bers continued in full-ume em­ployment of the Universiry after reaching the age of 65. 
McLaughlin based his decision on the contract between profes­sors and the University, the terms of which are outlined in the Faculty Handbook. Section 10 of the handbook reads, "A member of the faculty ordinari­ly retires and becomes emeritus on the first day of July following his sixty-fifth birthday .... When a member is permitted to continue in active service be­yond the date prescribed for retirement, service beyond that date will be on the basis of a year-to-year appointment, and a member will retire at the end of any service year unless he is re-appointed for another year.'' McLaughlin ruled in James 
P. Danehy vs University of Notre Dame du Lac that ''this contract of tenure expired on July 1, 1977." He also held that ''after expiration of a tenure contract the Defendant {Notre Dame) may again con­tract with the previously ten­ured employee or it may con­tract with anyone else. No state or Federal Constitutional Rights of Plaintiff (Danehy) was violated by Defendant." 
McLaughlin also charged court costs to Danehy. 
Danehy said yesterday that he was not very disappointed "because I've been expecting this for a long time and I' vt· accomplished what-I set out to do.'' He said he would decide whether to appeal the decision after consulting his attorne. Paul Kusbach. 
He said he has spent $4,000 on his suit so far, money "out of pocket because there is nothing coming in." He added that ~ppeals are much more expen­Sive, and can cost tens of thousands of dollars. He said that the hopes for support from an organization such as the American Civil Liberties Union or the American Association of Retired Persons should he de­cide to appeal the decision. 
University Counsel Phillip Faccenda expressed satisfac­tion with the decision. He said the decision "could not be more final. He gave the plaintiff nothing and made him pay the court costs." 



Steelhauling Teamsters end strike 
PITTSBURGH (AP) -Steel­hauling Teamsters voted yes­terday to end a month-long strike only two days after shouting down union officials who ordered a return to work. 
Strike leaders said the shut­down probably would end early this week throughout the East· ern states, where the strike forced the layoff of some 6,000 mill workers because steel ship­ments were bottled up. 
"They really don't want to go back to work,'' said Mel Pack­er, organizer for the dissident Teamsters for a Democratic Union. 
But, he said, the members of Local 800 voted 175-149 to end the strike because of eroding unity among the strikers. 
''They realize they could no longer hold down a significant portion of the industry,'' said Packer. 
"Call it realiry," he added. 
After Teamstersfreight haul­ers ended a 10-day walkout on April 10, steel haulers defied a back-to-work order, demandin~ a separate vote on their provi­sions in the proposed master freight agreement. 
They also complained that key points of the proposed contract msut be approved by the Interstate Commerce Com­mJssJon. 
But support for the shutdown dwindled as more individual contract settlements were reached with the SO members of teh National Steel Carriers As­sociation, lone holdout among four major employer bargaining groups. 
"We've won a lot of things. But we haven't won the sep­arate vote,'' said union member Frank Stewart. 
The drivers were encouraged not to abandon their fight for separate voting rights, but to apply pressure within the union for a change in balloting rules. 
Last Friday, officials of the Teamsters international union were booed and shouted down at a meeting in Pittsburgh after urging a halt to the strike. But resistance ebbed over the weekend. 
Members ofsteel-hauling Lo­cal 92 in Canton, Ohio, voted Sunday to end the strike if holdout companies signed the agreement and agreed to give them six days' retroactive sick pay. 
Charles Carelli, secretary­treasurer of Pittsburgh-based Local 800, said work would not resume immediately with about 10 Pittsburgh-area National full operation today. In De­

Additional spaces made 

in five halls 
by Tom Hay 
In an effort to furnish more on-campus housing next fall, five residence· halls are provid­ing space for approximately 60 additional students, according to Edmund Price, director of University Housing. Although the move will allow more stu­dents to live on-campus, the extra students will contribute to the already crowded conditions in four of the five dorms affected. 
In Lewis Hall, plans are being made to convert the kitchenettes on each floor to double or triple-occupancy rooms. This will add eleven extra girls to the population of Lewis. 
Carroll, Holy Cross, Walsh, and Farley halls must house the balance of the extra students in existing room space. These dorms have been forced to ''temporarily'' accommodate overflow students during the past year. Price said that these "temporary" spaces would be included in the regular room picks this year to provide the needed extra beds for next fall. 
In Holy Cross Hall, double rooms were made into triples in order to absorb the additional students. "We took in about 30 more people than we should normally take," said Holy Cross Rector Fr. George Wiskirchen. ''I was told before that these were temporarily­enforced triples to be reverted back to doubles. It's onethingif it's on a temporary basis, but :mother if it's going to be permanent," he added. Fr. Wiskirchen said that he was out of town most of last week, and didn't know exactly how many extra students would be housed in Holy Cross next year. 
Sr. Jean Lenz, rector of Farley Hall, was upset with the overcrowding in her building, but she did not see the situation as permanent. ''My under­standing is that all this is

Bomb blast injures three children 
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -A bomb blast injured three children waiting for a school bus near here yesterday as the Israeli Cabinet met in Jerusalem and voted to reinstate the death penalty for terrorists convicted of "acts of mhuman cruelty." 
The three children were reported not seriously injured. One was treated for shock and the two others for minor shrapnel wounds, authorities said. 
In Beirut, Lebanon, the Palestine Liberation Organization said its guerrillas were responsible for the attack and contended that several Israeli soldiers were killed in the explosion. 
The bombing in Kfar Sava, eight miles northeast ofTel Aviv, was the latest in a wave of terror attacks against Israel aimed at disrupting the Israeli-Egyptian peace. 
Police are warning Israelis to be especially alert for attacks with the approach of Israel's 31st independence day celebrations Wednesday. 
In the Sinai Desert, meanwhile, Israeli and Egyptian generals met at Tassa, a United Nations post, for their first detailed discussion of the return of Sinai territory to 'Egyptian rule. The military leaders said they would use "good will and understanding'' to solve future prob­lems. 
The Israeli Cabinet's order that prosecutors s~oul~ again seek the death penalry for terrorist crrmes was a response to a bloody pre-dawn attack by seaborne PLO guerillas April 22. Four Israelis were killed, including a father and his daughter who were taken hostage.. Another girl in the same family was smothered to death by her mother as they hid in a closet. Two raiders were killed and two were captured. 
Israel last used the death penalry when it hanged Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in 1962.

"When we put people into lounges in the towers and the Farley basement, some of them didn't want to leave," he said. Price said that there were no plans at this time to house students in the lounges of Grace or Flanner Halls. Thomas Mason, Vice Presi­dent of Business Affairs, said that the present situation is much better than it could have been if enough students had not decided to move off-campus. ''The system this year allowed the -problem to be identified early," he said. "We've avoided having a crisis, but that doesn't mean that we won't be crowded a little bit.'' 
Unseasonably cold w-eather, rain fail to datnpen An Tostal spirit 
by Beth Minarovich 
Unseasonably cold weather and rain failed to dampen spirits on campus as students at. both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's celebrated An Tostal. The four-day spring festival attracted record crowds for some events, although others were poorly attended. 
One of the highlights of the weekend came yesterday after­noon when "Chumps" edged the "Butchers" to win this year's Bookstore Basketball tournament. Chumps, led by Tom Sudkamp and Rusty Lisch, survived a field of 320 teams in the single elimination tourna­ment, beating the Bruce Flowers-led Butchers 19-21. A moderate crowd braved a cold rain to witness the game behind the ACC. 
Tim Tinker was crowned Mr. Campus Thursday night at Saint Mary's, overcoming runner-up Mike Natale for the title. The freshman from Carroll Hall demonstrated 41 different ways of whistling and performed the William Tell Overture on his cheeks in the campus talent contest.' Jim Brogan, a former An Tostal illuminary, returned to campus to serve as emcee for the event. 
Winning An Tostal's other ''glamour'' contest, Dom Yocius was named Ugly Man On Campus Saturday mght at the Irish Wake. The junior business major waged a cam­paign ou~ of Dillon and raised over I, 100 to eclipse the field of nearly 150 contenders. 
The penny-a-vote contest raised $2,363.64, all of which will be donated to Sr. Marita's Day School in South Bend. Alpha Phi Omega sponsored the contest this year. 
In an interesting sidelight, Fr. Daniel J enky, rector of Dillon, promised to shave his beard on the South Quad on Wednesday because of Yocius' victory. Jenky had promised that he would shave his beard if Yocius raised over $1,000. Members of Dillon Hall made door-to-door collections in the effort to push Y ocius over the top. 
Particularly hurt by the weather was the carnival held on the Stepan Center parking lot. The few people who braved the elements said the rides were "rickety but fun," but attendance was down so much Saturday night that the carnival closed for the night. Carnival Co-Chairman Bob Morin said, "Unfortunately, the weather ruined the carnival and that's where we counted on making the money.'' There were specu­lations the carnival may not return next year. 
Gentle Thursday was well­attended. The Frisbee demo was popular, and the daisy sale went off well. Fifty teams competed in the canoe races on Saint Mary's Lake Marion, with Humper and Y eows finally tri­umphing over Tom Schuler and Mike Donegan. 
According to Donna Noonan, chairman of Frivolous Friday, many events attracted ''a lot more paricipants than ever before." Popular events in­cluded carstuffing, which set a new record of 36 smashed bodies. In the keg toss, Lynn Stephens, an assistant profes­sor of philosophy, beat Bob Golic, last year's winner. The Treasure Hunt was won by Mark Sherry, who d~duced that the location was in a bush at the graveyard on the road to St. Mary's. 
John Callaway, co-chairman for Saturday, was very pleased with the day's events. He was extremely impressed by Mike Sexton, who won the obstacle course, only 15 minutes after a good showing in the 6-mile Road Run. Tom Soma won the 3-mile event with a time of 17:36. 
Badin kept up the Notre Dame tradiuon of winning the interhall 'football game, while North Quad won earthball for the third year in a row. 
Another popular event was Mud VoIIeybaII , won by the team captained by Martin Mai. Bill Katzenberger's team fin-­ished second. In the Chariot Race, Sorin outpaced St. Ed's for a victory. Spectators en­joyed watching the event until many of them became partici­pants by being thrown into the mud. 
Recess 101 was well attended as students relived their child­hood days with games of jump­rope, finger (and friend) paint­ing, and dodgeball. 
Due to the weather, Satur­day's "picnic" was hastily re­scheduled to North and South Dining Halls, but was a success nevertheless. Frisbees and the Blue: Grass band were allowed inside the North Dining Hall. 
Another returning success was the Irish Wake held Satur­day night in Stepan. During the band's breaks, the "audience" was impressed by the profes­sional frisbee freestylers who had showed their skills Thurs-
d s · M 
ay at atnt ary s. 
The weeke~1d ended Sunday with a final night at the Irish Pub. Paul Callahan, chairman of the An Tostal Committee, commented, "An Tostal went extremely well, even with the cold and the rain--people were enjoying themselves, and that's what An Tostal is all about."

Newly freed Ginzburg, family to live at Solzhenitsyn hom.e 

NEW YORK (AP)-Newly freed Soviet dissident Alexander Ginzburg said yes­terday that he and his family will go to live with exiled Soviet novelist Alexander Solzhenitsyn at the writer· s secluded 51-acre estate in the hills of southern Vermont. 
The move, confirmed by Solzhenitsyn' s secretary, will reunite two close associates who have been prominent leaders of the Soviet dissident movement. Solzhenitsyn, a Nobel Laureate, has been in exile himself since 1974. 
An interpreter translating for Ginzburg during a 70-minute interview with the Associated Press said the dissident would travel to Vermont tomorrow, and that Solzhenitsyn had in­vited Ginzburg and his family to ''live there, as if they were coming home.'' 
"I am a little tired of seeing four walls after prison--and now this. room," Ginzburg said laughingly. 
He was referring to his accomodations on the 37th floor of the United Nations Plaza Hotel, where he has stayed since being flown toNe\\< York Friday in an exchange of five Soviet dissidents for two Soviet spies convicted here. 
Two of the other dissidents, Mark Dymshits and Eduard Kuznetsov, were attending a rally on behalf of Soviet Jewry before_ flying to l~rael, where they wdl m·ake their homes. 
Georgi Vins, a Baptist pastor, attended morning church ser­vices in Washington with Pres­ident Carter. 
-The fifth dissident, Valentin Moroz of the Ukraine, was back here after attending a rally in his honor in Philadelphia late Saturday. 
Ginzburg, whose latest trial last summer drew international attention, is the most cele­brated of the freed dissidents. His conviction of "anti-Soviet agitation and propagnada'' was connected with his work mon­itoring human rights" provisions in the Helsinki accords. 
The leader of the Moscow group that monitored the accord, Yuri Orlov, is in prison in the Soviet Union. 
Ginzburg, 42, who has done three separate stints in Soviet prisort camps, was in an expan­sive mood as he sat overlooking Manhattan's skyline and talked about past struggles in the Soviet Union and a still uncharted future here. 
He appeared more robust than the day before, when, during a news conference, his fac~ appeared ghostly white. However, he dedined to dis­cuss his health other than to say he was suffering from an ulcer that had been "aggravated extremely'' during his latest confinement. 
He talked at length and in detail about his prison life, gesturing often, pomting, even drawing a picture of his work

Talk about his prison exper­ience did not se·em to dampen his spirits, though he said he, like other prisoners, began each day by dumping his excretions from a bucket kept in his cell. After breakfast, he said, he spent eight hours polishing · glass for chandeliers. 
He said he was not allowed to read anything written outside the Soviet Union or anything containing religious references. 
What kept him going? 
''Faith,'' he said. 
Religious faith? 
"Yes." 
Ginzburg practices the 

Russian Orthodox faith, but has taken the Jewish family name of his mother as a protest against Soviet anti-Semitism.

Vietnam: 
EDITOR'S NOTE: Four years ago today, Vietnam's commun­ists won their long war to unite North and South. Here is an appraisal of the path that battered nation has followed since then, andits prospects for: the future. 
An AP News Analysis by Denis D. Gra_y Associated Press Tr7nter 

BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) ­Vietnamese Premier Pham Van Dong promised to "constantly : 'llprove the life of the people" when he outlined a blueprint for his nation's future at a Com­munist Party congress in 1976. The next five years, he said, would pave the way for prosper­ity and bring "a civilized and happy life. '' 
At the time, many veteran observers of Vietnamese poli­tics, including some American diplomats who were decidedly not pro-Hanoi, believed post­war reconstruction would take precedence over military muscle-flexing. Vietnamese pragmatism, the observers pre­dicted, would keep Hanoi from leaning toward Moscow or Pe­king and perhaps, with an eye turned to the West, it would become the Yugoslavia of Asia. 
Today, four years after North Vietnam overpowered the South, the Hanoi regime is again at war. It has also become solidly lodged in the Kremlin fold. And only the most optimistic can say that, by the usual measures, its 50 million people have a better life. 
Vietnamese troops are lead­ing a costly, 4-month-old war in Cambodia and a sizable garri­son is based in Laos to help that nation fight diehard insurgents. At home, Vietnam is under a general mobilization pro­claimed during the month-long border war with China that broke out Feb. 17. 
Vietnam today has an esti­mated 1 million men under arms, the sixth-largest armed forced in the world. The fighting is bleeding resources from economic development in a nation that has one of the 


Today & Tomorrow 
world's lowest per-capita In­comes and where about 3 million people are believed unemployed. 
Its economic bible, the four­year plan due to end in 1980, has been all but scrapped, its final year goals having been cut sharply. 
Although the claims of refu­gees must be regarded with some skepticism, the recent crop of "boat people" express greater despatr about condi­tions in Vietnam than those who fled earlier. . 
"When some Saigon families are down to their last dong (the local currenc.y) t-hey buy poi-­son,'' said one recent escapee who fled to Thailand. 
Four years after Saigon-now Ho Chi Minh City -fell to the communists April 30, 1975, compromise with the new order seem~ impossible for many in the south. 
Ric~ rations were cut by abouti half when Vietnam laun­ched hs invasion of Cambodia last (41ristmas Day. Diplomats and refugees say black market priceS. for basic commodities have soared in Ho Chi Minh City. A former .nurse at the city's Nhan Dan Hospital said more and more children are suffering from malnutrition. She also said the lines of people waiting to sell blood, a tradi­tional practice among the poor, have been growing longer. 
Western diplomats based in Hanoi say there have been few dramatic changes_ in prices there. But they report a growing shortage of everyday Items, such as rice: bowls and other utensils, as well as of medicines which once were imported fn ,m China. 
Vietnan; ·:; policy-m<lkers can­not be totally blamed for the nation's economic woes. A widespread drought in 1977 was followed last year by one of the worst periods of flooding in recent history. Official statis­tics say about 3 million tons of rice were lost and some ana­lysts predict a deficit of 3 million to 4 million tons in food grains this year. 
It is also difficult to assign blame in the conflicts with China and Cambodia. 
Analysts say the anti-Soviet Chinese have reasons for trying to disrupt the development of their pro-Soviet neighbor. They also note that for more than a year before the Vietnamese mvasion of Cambodia, Cam­bodian troops had staged bloody raids into Vietnam. Vietnam also has been bur­dened with almost 200,000 ref­ugees who fled the repressive regime of ousted Cambodian Premier Pol Pot. 
Whatever the cause, Viet­nam's aging leadership of vet­eran revolutionaries has cho­sen, at least. for now, a policy of guns-over-nee. 
In 1977, Hanoi gave up its gradual approach to socialist transition tn southern Vietnam, speeding up its timetable by almost three years with the elimination of free enterprise. The move shattered the highly commercial Chinese community in southern Vietnam, leading to a large-scale exodus of ethnic Chinese. 
About half a million ethnic Chinese and Vietnamese have fled since 1975, stripping south­ern Vietnam of badly needed managers, technical experts, doctors and other highly trained individuals. 
Last year's border feud with China, which broke into open warfare two months ago, hafted about 70 Chinese-sponsored projects and cut off an esti­mated $300 million a year in aid from Peking. 
Still, reports from several international organizations in­dicate Vietnam has an abun­dance of resources and enough disciplined, educated people to give a. the potentia} for becoming a maJor economtc power u, Southeast Asia. 
''They 'have tremendous problems but its very difficult to say_ just where their breaking point lies," said one Western diplomat in Bangkok, who like others interviewed asked not to be identified. A second veteran Hanoi-watcher said, ''Too many rimes I've counted the Vietnamese down and out, only to see them come up again.''

[AP]About 280 anti-nuclear acti­
vists were arrested· yesterday 
when they marched on the 
gates of a Colorado nuclear 
weapons plant. Elsewhere, the 
legacy ofThree Mile Island was 
dramatized with soaring bal­
loons, frightening figures and 
folk songs. 
Some 230 Colorado protes­
ters had trained for weeks in a 
plan to blockade three en­
trances to the Rocky Flats plant 
about 16 miles northwest of 
Denver, the nation's only pro­
ducer of plutonium "triggers" 
for nuclear weapons. 
About two dozen armed fed­
eral marshals and security 
guards from Rockwell Inter­
national greeted them and 70 
other protesters at the plant's 
east and west gate and at a 
railroad spur leading into the 
facility. 

Former Pentagon analyst 
Daniel Ellsberg was among 
those arrested at the railroad 
tracks -the same spot where he 
and 27 others were arre-;ted 
exactly a year ago yesterday . 
More than 200 persons were 
arrested at Rocky Flats last 
SJ?ring, and most were con­
victed and given suspended 
sentences. This year, officials 
said trespassers would be pros­
ecuted on federal charges. 
To the cheers of other dem­
onstrators across the road, the 
arrested protesters were loaded 
into a blue bus from the Denver 
County sheriff's department 
and taken to a makeshift book­
ing station at the U.S. Geologi­
cal Survey headquarters in

concert 
The Notre Dame Brass Ensemble will present a concert tomorrow at 7:30p.m. in Sacred Heart Church. Highlights of Lakewood, a Denver suburb, where magistrates were stand­ing by. 
The protesters, who split into three groups as they marched toward the plant following a prayer meetmg, were accom­panied by six attorneys who had volunteered their services. 
The confrontation was a mili­tant follow-up to a mass rally at the weapons plant the day before. 
On Saturday more than 10,000 demonstrators -three times as many as the organizers exP.ected -assembled in damp, chtlly weather to sing, hear speeches, and demand that the plant be shut down or converted to non-military use. 
Other anti-nuclear demon­strations over the weekend, given impetus by last month's near-catastrophe at the Three Mile Island reactor in Pennsyl­vania, were staged at a ski slope in Vermont and a farm in Arkansas, on the banks of the Hudson River in New York and on a Navajo reservation in New Mexico. 
As all this was going on, tour­ists were streaming by the Three Mile Island plant on the Susquehanna River, snapping pictures of the facility, now safely shut down.

The Danehy case; legality v.s. ethics 
Last Wednesday, the Starke County Circuit Court handed down its decision in the case of Professor James Danehy vs. the University of Notre Dame. Ruling in favor of the University, Judge Marvin McLaughlin stated that Notre Dame "has a uniform policy for ending its contracts," and thus, ''no state or federal constitutional rights of the plaintiff were violated by the defendant.'' However, McLaughlin also noted that the University presently lacks a uniform policy regarding the rehiring of professors whose contracts have been terminated. In our opinion, the University must adopt uniform standards for reh1ring professors over age 65. 
Under present University pohcy, the contract of a tenured professor automatically expires the first day of July, following his sixty-fifth birthday. After expiration ofa tenure contract, the University has the option of rehiring the previously tenured employee on a year-to-year basis. 
However, according to the court record, Notre Dame "has a sketchy procedure for rehiring after a~e 65," and "has no standards, requirements or prerequisites for determining who will be rehired." 
Of 81 persons reaching the age of 65 durin~ the period covered by the evidence presented in the tnal, 27 were rehired under one-year contracts for full-time service. No uniform standards were applied in determining who would be allowed to continue full-time teaching. 
Professor Danehy' s tenure contract expired on July 1, 1977. The University chose to terminate his employment, although mental or physical, nor any 'cause' was an element in the ending of Plaintiff's contract." 
While the University's present policy may stand upin a court oflaw, in our opinion, it is neither ethical nor equitable. Professors like Danehy have devoted many years of their lives to teaching at this University. Upon termination of their employment, they deserve a better explanation the questionable standard that they are simply too old to continue teaching effectively. The University may find this excuse convenient; we constder it illogical and unjust. 
Professor Danehy has spent thousands of dollars fighting the University's rettrement policy. Although his efforts have not won him personal victory, they have not been totally in vain, for they have exposed an arbitrary and discriminatory policy. 
We believe the University must examine its present retirement and rehiring practices, and replace them with more ethical and equitable policies. Professors over the age of 65 should have their contracts renewed or terminated on the grounds of their teaching ability, as evaluated by students and faculty members of their department. A, professor's age is not a valid standard by which to judge his effectiveness as a teacher, nor is it a legitimate or reasonable explanation for terminating his employment.

Christianity and the oppressed 
People should not stand alone 
We are happy to be members of the committee supporting Midwest farmworkers. We were asked to speak about the connection berween struggling in solidarity with those who touch the earth for us and being a Christian/ CatholicI believer.. 
We recalled this creation of a folksingerI poet friend: WHY DOES THE CHURCH HAVE A STBEPIE 
Why does the church have a steeple, Mommy? Why does the church have a steeple? 
So the people will know there's a church there, Christians live there. 
Is that the only way they know there's a church there, Mommy, That they see steeples? 
No, child, If people are kind and just and good others will know there's a church there, 
-

Christians live there.  
Then, Mommy, why does steeple?  th e church have a Juniper  

How great it would be if, by our lives, we really were a clear sign to all. How great if we gave unmistabkable witness to the ideals of Jesus. Happily there is much at Notre Dame-Saint Mary's ofwhich to be proud. There are certain "rumors of angels." For example, many students reach out in service and love to local people who are hurting: the retarded, the sick, the blind, minority group members, and at times classmates in various needs and difficul­ties. Some students touch distant lands by foregoing Wednesday night dinner and donating to the World Hunger Coalition. Nestles has been boycotted for their unconscionable baby bottle campaign in Third World nations. Many students and alumnae or alumni are far away in Peru or Chile and on other missions trying to learn "and to serve. A grouP. of alumni staff a school for undocumented children in Houston. Many graduates faithfully try to face their daily responsibilities in a Christian way. For this and more, we can rejoice. 
Yet, we have miles i:o go before we sleep. The Christian always needs to keep asking hard officials speak of winning against them? Why won't Notre Daq~.e publish the investment portfolio, as other colleges have under pressure of "idealistic" students? Are African students here unreasonable in their distress over Univer­sity investments in their continent? Finally, why are there so few minority group members of the student body, faculty, coaching staffs, and other staff? 
On balance, Notre Dame seems to rate somewhat mixed reviews, which is not so bad when there's willingness to change for the better with God's help. We have benefited greatly from Notre Dame and are not ungrateful. This study experience has, in fact, taught us more dearly to ask hard questions. 
The Sunday after Easter at the Spanish Mission of Our J.ady of Guadalupe in Milford, Indiana, (near Nappanee), the small group of parishioners shared their thoughts about the readings of the day. One Mexican-American factory worker said: 
Sometimes I'm like doubting Thomas. I worry. I don't trust God enough. A few days ago I was talking to a man who belongs to the Amish religion. I told him that 1 am worried about the economy these days. He asked me, "What are you wom"ed about? WE'RE NOT ALONE. Don't they teach that in your religion too? Don't you count on each other?'' He made me think about how we should act. 
Of course that factory worker was right. We are supposed to help one another. We. should live like a family. We should be able to count on one another. It is Bible teaching that the Church passes on to us, The Old Testament prophet Isaiah (58:6-8) calls us "to let the oppressed go free ... share your bread with the hungry, and shelter the homeless poor.'' Also the First Letter of St. John in the New Testament says: 
Christ gave his lzfe for us. We too, then, ought to give our lives for the brothers and sisters. Ifa rich person sees his brother or sister in need, and yet doses his heart against them, how can he claim that he loves God? My chzldren, our love should not be just words and talk: it must be true love, which shows itself in action. 
(l)n3:16-18) Because you are a Christian, you help your brothers and sisters in need. Because you are a Christian, you care about 

questions of herself/himself. The questions the struggling farmworkers. may have the positive effect of constructive Because you are a Christian, you want triticism. Some hard questions: Why have the farmworkers to know they are nor alone. groundskeepers and other staff workers been · unsuccessful in their efforts to organize for Jack Martin collective bargaining, and why would University Jack O'Malley

N.D.-M.B.A. Program in London by Joel 
The Notre Dame London MBA 
program may be the best international 
studies program in the country. After 
rwo years of experience and 29 
students completing the program, 
many employers and others are find­
ing out about this experience in 
international business studies. 
This past fall, I was a member of the 
second class of 19 students to go over 
to the land of Queen Elizabeth and 
Margaret Thatcher. The purpose of 
~his article is to describe that exper­
Ience. 
The three people who had the most 
to do with the success of the London 
program are Dr. John Malone, Dr. 
Thomas T. Murphy, both former 
Dean, and Brother Leo Ryan C.S. V., 
the current Dean. With foresight into 
the development of international busi­
ness and the value of exposure to other 
cultures, Malone and Murphy toyed 
with ideas of an international program 
for the ND graduate business school 
several years ago. They investigated a 
number of countries and options. 
Great Britain had an edge because its 
people speak nearly the same lan­
guage. However, all of us on the 
London program would probably attest 
that it might be easier to understand 
French or Norwegian· than English 
Cockney. 
After firming up their objectives, Brother Ryan, our Dean since 1975, approached the London Business School (LBS) director, David Norburn, and presented a proposal to run a separate program for Notre Dame MBA students. An agreement was made and Norburn personally took charge of selecting three other profes­sors to take part for at least the first year. Because of the first year success, the same professors repeated the second year. Except for one professor who is returning to business, all will teach another year in 1979. 
The Notre Dame MBA 
Notre Dame's MBA program is 11 years old. This year the graduating class is 97. The thrust of the MBA school is to provide a structured program with fundamentals in the quantitive area in the first year. In the second year, those principles are applied through a case orientation. 
There are several basic reasons for someone to choose Notre Dame's MBA school over another MBA school. 
Notre Dame itself has a lot of attraction--the physical layout, the athletic tradition, the tradition ofNotre 
Dame as a school of excellence. its religious environment and its strong alumni nerwork are good reasons to select Notre Dame. The academic program is solid and is improving yc;ar by year. The placement program wtth efforts by the Placement Bureau and the MBA students is very strong. This year, our class has done extremely well in securing job offers. The London Program 
The London program is unique in a number of ways. A few of the top American business schools have affil­iated programs with the London Business School, i.e., Harvard, Wharton, Chicago, Stanford and NYU. 
Our main advantage is that those schools send rwo students and this year we sent 19. It is also necessary for students to attend classes with the other British students. At first glance, that may seem favorable but we received more personal attention with the smaller class and it provided an atmosphere to enjoy the entire cultural and educational experience. The Thunderbird Business School in Glendale, Arizona has an international program but they do not have a formalized program with a foreign business school. 
Because of our independent pro­gram, Notre Dame has much more flexibility in selecting professors from the London Business School. After the great success of the first rwo years, the LBS professors have been pleased to sign on for another year. 
Purpose
The purpose of the London program is to develop a perspective on the world of business from a foreign viewpoint. another objective is com­paring business in Britain, another mdustrial country, with the U.S .. 
In addition to our business education, the cultural and social learning experience was significant. Having the opportunity to study another nation and its reople was an experience all of us wil appreciate. 
Structure 
The structure of the semester was different from the regular semesters at ND. Instead of havmg two classes a week per subject, we had one class to fit the busy schedules of rhe British professors. Three hours with one professor went by faster than you could imagine. It was more intense and required that everyone prepare for class. We also had the pleasure of ­taking a midmorning coffee break with Mrs. Bernadean Murphy, Professor Murphy's wife, serving the coffee and Engfish 9iscuits. 
Living inLondon 

Arriving in London in late August 
and finding an apartment or flat for 
four months is something every 
American should be required to do at 
least once. That experience was one of 
the most significant we had. Flats that 
are within a student's budget and 
close to our school at 552 King's Road 
in Chelsea are hard to find. Inciden­
tally, King's Road is the center in 
London for fashion and punk rockers 
(orange hair and all). 
I found a flat for Tom Costas,· 
Eduardo de Lascurain and myself 
through an estate agent. Because I 
wanted to leave for Norway three days 
later, I was in a rush. I saw a sign 
advertising an estate agent and made 
a call inquiring about flats for about 
$150 to 200 month. The reply was, 
how about S150 to $200 a week! We 
settled on a flat for $600 a month. The 
flat was a 20 minute bus ride to our 
school and about a five minute walk 
from Victoria train station. 
One of the interesting and different 
aspects of living in London was 
grocery shopr,ing. Every Monday 
morning my ' flatmates" and I would 
walk to our neighborhood shooping 
area. We would stop at the butcher 
shop and pick out chicken and possibly 
some New Zealand lambchops. Then 
we would head for a smaller sized 
supermarket for basic staples. The 
next stop would be the bakery and the 
last stop would be the vegetable stand 
where we would buy fresh vegetables 
which came from southern Europe. 
Expectations 

My own expectations of the London 
program were high. I wanted to have 
extensive exposure to international 
business and by living in another 
country gain a deep appreciation for 
the life styles and concerns of another 
country's peoples. 

My expectations were exceeded. The,professors were outstanding, the city of London was exciting and the other ND students were enjoyable. 
In terms of real benefit to me and 
the rest of the class, the short term 
outlook of getting a satisfying job 
when we graduate in May is bnght. 
Although the outlook is good for the 
MBA class, the London experience has 
turned out to be a major asset in the 
job seeking process. In the interviews, 
it is not uncommon to spend 5-10 
minutes talking about the time in 
London. The main advantage that I 
see is that I can bring a unique 
academic and personal background 
that will improve my contribution to a 
firm. 
In addition to the duties of director of the London program, Professor Mu_rphy t<Hight one of t_he fivt; class.~s enttrled ·'Social issues 10 Bus10ess. Although Murphy's expertise is in finance, the class was effective in identifying important issues that affect us all, i.e., discrimination, nuclear energy, false advertising, and world hunge. 
For example, a classmate of mine, Paul Wood, and I did a study of World Hunger and Multinational Business." We led a 3 hour discussion of some of the major issues facing all of us and presented some alternative solutions to the problems faced by businesses involveo in food production and dis­tribution. 
David Norburn, the LBS director, taught a course entitled ~'British Practicum in Industry." It gave us a great deal of experience in analyzing a business through financial analysis and identifying critical variables in developing corporate strategy. His qualifications are excellent with a background as a consultant with an American firm and as a top manager in a British firm. 
Stuart Slatter taught a class in International Business. He also worked in the United States and was the president or managing director ofa Brinsh firm at the age of 27. He trained us to use a framework in analyzing cases in international busi­ness. 
John Drew was the professor for a course on the Common Market or the European Economic Community (EEC). Drew was writing a book on the EEC as we were taking the coiurse. He personified British gentry and we learned the value of understanding various actions affecting the EEC. He was also an advisor to the House of Lords on the Common Market. 
Our fifth professor, John McGee, taught Macroeconomics. His approach was theoretical and very comprehensive. He received his Master's degree from the London School of Economics and his Doctorate from Stanford in California.

A Talking Head Look At N.D. S Proportions 
Dan Bell Ron Havne.r fud Weiksner Mike Busk 
The weekly features column, The Talking Head, was nearly decapitated in a recent journalistic Snafu. Having tred where brave men dare not go, The Talking Heads--Mid~. Busk, Rone Haynes, and Jud 1¥'eiksner--were in­formed oftheir trespass. 
Since mercy flows like' honey at du Lac, they were spared the Observer guzllotine and allowed to continue publication. 
Therefore, the Features god resur­rects the comatose Talk10g Head column. Carry on wayward sons, and Sin no more. Amen. 
The Notre Dame community has been thrown into a frenzy over the passage of HEW's Title IX. This diabolical plot could spell the end of big-time!! college athletics for Notre Dame by shifting thousands of dollars from the men's athletic program to the women's. 
Once again, with the providential assistance of confidant and marathon runner Deep Ear, The Talking Head sticks its head out and into Umversity loopholes only to return with this amazing revelation: while Title IX 
requires proportionately equal 
amounts to be spent on both sexes, tt 
never says what that proportion must 
be. 
In a desperate attempt to solve the 
Tirle IX quagmire, Fr. Edmund P. 
O'Thori~ makes a pleading call to St. 
Mary's President Dr. John Dig-in.. 
"Doc, we've had a change 10 
enrollmen_r plans over here at du Lac. 
Do you thtok you could make room for 
some of our women as transfer stud­
dents?" 
"How many?" "About 1,700. They're very ador­able, but unfortunately they're very intelligent .'' 
"Yes, yes, we've read all about 
them in Notre Dame Magazine. I think 
they should be able to handle our 
curriculum. Why do you want to get 
rid of them anyway?....-There must be 
easier ways to solve the cheerleader 
quota problem.'' 
''Thts is serious. The university--! 
mean the football program--is in 
danger, unless we make drastic 
cutdowns on Notre Dame women." 
"Don't Notre Dame guys cut down

Tracksters take fifth at state meet 
by Beth Huffman Women 's Sports Editor 
Notre Dame's women track­sters proved that the men on the campus aren't the only ones that can excel in running and field events. The squad placed fifth on Saturday in the Indiana State Small College Champion­ships out of thirteen teams. Manchester dominated the meet, tallying 131 points, fol­lowed by Marion with · 107, Taylor with 85.5, and Indiana Central, who edged Notre Dame for fourth place by a scant one and a half points, with 49.5. 
The 3200 meter relay team of Jane Ahern, Kathy Gutherie, Helen Weber, 'and Eunie Sulli­van joined for a second place with a time of 11:20. Jackie and Bernie Bollas, Weber and Sulli­van teamed for another second place, this time with a 4:26 clock in the 1600 meter relay. 
Mary Hums collected second place honors in the javelin with a throw of 109'6 '12 ". Eunie Sullivan dashed to a second in the 1500 meters with a 5:27.1, just edging teammate Helen Weber, who finished fourth at 5:27.2. 
Notre Dame picked up a fourth place finish in the 5000 meters with Jane Ahern cros­sing the line at 20:49. Liz Berry also took a fourth, but in the 300 meters with a 12:31 run. 
The Irish also took two sixth places, one in the 3000 meter run when Adelia Malvezzi crossed the line at 12:54. The second sixth place was turned in by Sheryl Kerns, who putted the shot 31 '2 V2 ". _ 
The women will face South­western Michigan in a home meet on Wednesday. Field events are scheduled to begin at 4:00p.m. and running events at 4:30 r..m. Highlighting the meet wtll be the 5000 meter race which is scheduled to begin at 4:30p.m. The race will be opened to any woman on either the Notre Dame or Saint Mary's campus that wishes to compete for exhibition. All o[her events will be open, but the 5000 meter race ts being stressed as the main exhibition event.
