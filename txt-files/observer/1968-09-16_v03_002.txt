One hall unusual in both the nature and number of its new prefects is Cavanaugh, in which Rev. Matthew Miceli has engaged four juniors to act as freshman counselors. Miceli stated yesterday "My idea is that they be primarily counselors and especially freshman counselors. Of co'urse, discipline is part of it, too. There will be no patrol of the corridors, but the prefects will keep an eye on things. If something comes up they're responsible." 
Fr. Miceli expressed satisfaction with the new system, saying "It spreads out the obligations and helps out the students who are prefects."

Library 7th Floor Theology Collection Moved; Only 5th, II th, 14th Floors Now Closed 
I I 
r 

Rev. James W. Simonson, CSC, Director of the Libraries, announced Friday that the theology collection of the Notre Dame Memorial Library has been moved from the seventh to the eighth floors of the library. The floor has previously been empty; it will now serve the same capacity in the stacks as the other floors do, although the study carrels have not yet been completed. 
Now only the fifth and eleventh floors (and, of course, the proverbial presidential 
fourteenth) are not part of the library proper; the fifth floor houses the offices of the University of Notre Dame,Press and some of the research workers in the behavioral sciences, while the eleventh is an office complex including the Institute for the Study of Man in Contemporary Society and related work, the Philosophic Institute for the Study of Artificial Intelligence, and the 
Institute for Advanced Religious Studies. 
Father Simonson stated, 
however, that the University 
Press and other facilities are 
strictly "tenants" and eventually 
will evacuate as other space 
becomes available and the 
library collection grows. 
Simonson also said that a 
large space immediately adjacent 
to the Audio Center on the 
second floor has been 
partitioned off to serve as a 
Microfilm Reading Room. It will 
be used to consolidate all the 
library's equipment for reading 
microfilms and reproducing 
enlargements of individual 
microfilm pages, as well as the 
College Library Microfilm 
Collection. The latter includes a 
complete run of the New York 
Times and government 
documents deposited at Notre 
Dame.

Joyce Orients Frosh Religiously Services 
Sunday evening in Sacred Heart Church, it was time for the religious phase of the grueling freshman orientation. Rev. Edmund P. Joyce, Executive Vice President, who gave the address, began with a charming reminiscence of a similar evening "35 years ago, when I sat on the other side of the pew for the Freshmen Mission." He then warmly welcomed the newcomers into the "devoted and tightly knit spiritual family," the members of which have "one thing in common, the treasure beyond price, the Catholic faith." 
But the more precise purpose of the meeting, Joyce continued, was "to help you get started here on the right foot, to make sure you start off your college career in the state of sanctifying grace?" Joyce urged the students to take a few moments "to concentrate on some of the truly basic questions about hum­an existance. e.g. "who am I? ... where shall I be 100 years from now?" He emphasied the in­evitability of death. "What if the angel of death came to­ni~ht?" Riches and political po­wer are ashes at the mome1_1t of death. He then recounted the old tale of Francis Borgia, a Spanish courtier in the days of Charles V and Isabella. One day he saw the week-old corpse of a beautiful princess. The vanity of the flesh shook him profoundly. "Never again will I serve a master who can die," said he. And he didn't. 
"Nothing is so precious as life....and we tend to put aside the somber thoughts that it must come to an end." But to avoid the thought of death "is to be an ostrich". Indeed, "what we are at the moment of out death, we will be for all eternity". Yes, death "can come sooner than you think, maybe tonight". 
Joyce urged all the freshmen to "live like the saints", with a "constant awareness of of eternity". 
"The thought of dying outside the state of sanctifying grace", he noted, " is not a pleasant one for it confronts us with hell." Father assured his audience that hell was "not a mythical place the Church has conjured up to frighten peo­ple." He· eschewed a comment on the torments, but pointed out that one thing was for sure: "it is easier to sit here and talk about hell than it is to sit in hell and talk about Notre Dame."

Then c a me the classical 
freshman orientation chestnut 
about three boys in the car 
accident. Two were killed and the thire, seriously injured, was trapped in the mangled wreckage screaming for a priest. "Tonight is bargain night," said Father Joyce, "it is your chance to get some help if you are upside down morally. Our Lord knew· that man could be drawn into sin". The story of the prodigal son shows his sentiments. "God's mercy is infinite". No doubt about it. "These boxes in this church are the signs of . mercy....ten priests will be here tonight in these boxes ... Here is the challenge we are setting before you this evening. If you don't walk out of here in the 'state of sanctifying grace, you are 
missing a great opportunity." 
Tomorrow morning, Joyce 
continued, "we would like all of 
you to come to this altar like we 
were handing out $1000 
bills--but actually we are giving 
something far more valuable, the 
body and blood of Christ." 
He ended his address with 
some encouragement for tl1e 
pusillanimous. We realize many 
of the men have problems, some 
large, some small, and some " 
having to do with sex". In the 
boxes tonight, said he, are 
"experienced confessors", who 
will "help solve 'your problems 
in just a few minutes". They will 
stay in the confessionals as long 
as men keep coming. Thus, 
Christ offers the opportunity for 
all freshmen to start off their 
"university career as true and 
loyal sons of his mother Notre 
Dame.".

Announces Program 
Student Services 
Commissioner AI Knappenberger 
revealed today the Commission's 
present activities and some plans 
for the year. 
Currently, the Commission is 
holding a discount furniture sale 
in the Rathskellar of La Fortune 
Student Center from 1 to 4 pm 
on weekdays. Glidden's 
Furniture Store of South Bend 
sells the furniture to the 
Commission at cost, as they did 
last year. The Commission adds 
6% to cost and the savings total 
8% to 10% for the students. 
Knappenberger explained that 
the savings made available last 
year were not well advertised 
and he expects a substantial 
increase over last year's sales of 
$1600. 
Another service available from 
the Commission is the Freshman 
Photo Directory, which was 
expanded this year to include 
most of the freshmen at Notre 
Dame and St. Mary's. 
The new student directory for 
Notre Dame and St. Mary's will 
include all students, faculty, and 
administration from both 
colleges. It will· be available by 
Novermber 1, a month earlier 
than last year. Knappenberger 
attributed the earlier date of 
issuance to the efficiency of 
Dave Breen, who heads the 
directory committee. 
A major contribution to The 
Obersver was made by the 
Commission in the form of an 
IBM Composer System. The 
System justifies copy into the 
exquisitely formed and ' proportioned lines you are now 
reading. 
The Commission pays $625 
per month to rent the machine 
but Knappenberger expects that 
it will be self-financing because 
of the revenue it can potentially 
accrue from outside jobs. 
Campus Press has a new darkroom complex this year and will be reorganized. It will also rent better Mimeo and Xerox machines. Plans for an expensive letter press arc still tentative. Right now, according to Knappenberger, it is a question of "how we can hack it fin a nciail y."

The Prefect Dilemma 
We support the action of Student Body President Richard Rossie in calling a meeting of the Hall President's Council to consider the prefect situation. The action of the Administration in appointing 63 new student prefects is open to question and, quite possibly, deserves condemnation. 
Notre Dame is moving slowly but surely toward student self­government with special progress having been made in the area of a student judiciary. To supercede that judiciary just as it is getting off the ground is entirely wrong. The placing of additional prefects in halls without consultation of either student leaders or the hall government is an absurd act bound to arouse much justified student indignation. 
The Observer's objections, however, go beyond the act of imposition to the more significant question of the value of the new prefects. It would seem to us that the objectives of counselling and disciplining are 
entirely incompatible. Much has been said over the past two years of the so-called pastoral gap, caused partially by priests in the halls being forced to both advise and punish. Rectors have been unable to function effectively as counselors because of disciplinary responsibility. 
We maintain that for this reason the prefect experiment is doomed from the very start. The discipline angle has received special emphasis even as groups are being set up with Father Simons to discuss counselling. Prefects have signed contracts and been placed under the office of the Dean of Students. Thus the enforcer role is embedded in the mind of the pretect and apparent to the student. Would a student seek counselling from one who enforces such inane rules as those on parietal hours and liquor. We think not. The whole training in counselling will be negated by the very dual role given the prefects. 
Having seen the inconsistencies in the roles of the prefects, let us turn to the discrepancy of "discretion of circumstances." The prefects are being given leeway in enforcement, but unspecified leeway. This, in 
our opinion, will lead to the prefect having to make a most agonizing 
choice. Unable to be both conselor and disciplinarian, the prefect will 
be forced to choose between the roles. If he does not enforce university 
rules and emphasizes his counselling he is liable to dismissal. Can such a 
dismissal be justified? Is this right? The other choice is for the prefect 
to serve as disciplinarian and igaore his role as advisor. Thus he protects 
his job but negates the human effectiveness, which should be the heart and soul of his job. Either way, his choice is a m~nstrous one. Thus we oppose the callous means used in the prefect implementa­tions but also condemn the incompatible dual emphasis of the prefect as both enforcer and symbol ot enlightement. The new system ts not well thought out and in its present form is doomed to failure. We hope 
Wednesday's meeting will be a springboard (or constructive action, 
action which will be concerned with not only the means but also the ends as well.

TheYearof the Heroic Guerrilla 

BY DAVID KAHN 
"The guerrilla," explains !lucy Newton, Black Panther Defense 
"is a military commander and political theoretician all in one." The 
Cuban calendar has declared 1968, the Year of the Heroic Gue"illa. 
In the Year of the Heroic Gue"illa, the white liberal and his peace 
bird fly no more, America the beautiful becomes America the 
intolerable, and revolutionary force is recognized as the only 
;alternative to legality. The Year of the Heroic Gue"illa marks the. 
union of the black militant and the white radical; the Peace and 
Freedom Partv locks arms with the Black Panthers. It is in the Year 
of the Jleroi~ Guerilla that the University Student strikes with the 
black worker; the Chicago bus drivers invited students last summer 
into their picket lines. In the year of the Heroic Guerilla, broad shouldered Chicago quivers and bends before a march of placid demonstrators, and braces its spine with 7500 National Guards and a fully activated 12,000 man police force. 
We are coming to Chicago to vomit on the 'politics of joy,' to

With Mayor Daley's much vaunted "an-ounce-of-prevention-is-worth­
a-pound-of-cure" philosophy, the superabundance of blue bonnets was not a surprise. Stationed on every viaduct, street corner a. park entrance way, the policemen stood inactive sometimes relieving boredom by directing traffic. The hardline ranks of Chicago police did nothing to discourage the demonstrators, but rather their toothless grimaces and billy club fidgeting became a source of righteousness. Dick Gregory commented, "you look around you and 
you see that from the amount of police and the amount of battle soldiers, you must be right." And the podium echoed over and over the same rheto~ical questions: What kind of democracy is this which represses a cleavage of opinion? Of what value is a political system which must protect its structure from its pwn people? 
Suppose we, the dissenters, are the future. And when the past looks at the future, the past sees eJJerything wrong. Everything that is dying looks at everything that is young and new and says it shall not be. Carl Oglesby, speaking at Grant Park

Bongos, flutes, boxed broken glass combining n Afro-Indian harmonics inspired pelvic happenings, black flag waving and general levity. Bodies bathed in the lagoon. Police encircled the park and at night in small clusters would make timid entrances with flashlights and swinging clubs. Curfew was to be enforced at eleven o'clock. Concerned yippy leaders suggested crash pads, and encouraged early departure to avoid a devastating confrontation. And when eleventh hour came, there were bleeding heads, broken backs, and an empty Lincoln Park.

Y.I.P. char.ts A rally was scheduled for Grant Park, Wednesday. From there Alan Ginsberg, Jean Genet, Phil Ochs, and Carl Oglesby would lead a march to the amphitheatre. I was entering the park through the police lines which were located behind the band shell. One sweating cop squinted, tilted his head upwards, and shrieked, "Goddamn, they're taking down the flag." His whole body was shivering with hate. "Goddamn, they're taking down the flag. Gatta stop them." Another simultaneously radioed the event to headquarters. "Those damn yips are molesting the flag, and we're going in to stop them." Six police donned their helmets as they charged toward the flag pole. They dragged the daredevil student to the ground, and performed their billy club ritual. The whole rally advanced toward the interfering cops who became then more erratic with their blows in the face of an antagonized crowd. The podium shouts, "Remain seated. The pigs are attempting to disrupt our rally." Meanwhile, 
more heads bashed, and exchange of smoke bombs and finally the action subsides.

How to react to the hardwood slam and the smarting gases? Who to blame for the uniformed display of hatred and brutality? The isolated pig, most felt, was not to be damned. Demonstrators expressed open sympathy, exchanged peace signs with the cops, even clamored for a police-force raise-in-pay. The leaders defined the policeman as an appendage of the policy-maker, an agent of his white rascist neighborhood, a paid protector of the status quo ...

South )~end  after  the  Chicago  convention  seemed  somewhat  

inauspicious to its student population. Upon entering ths South Shore station one evening, a black cabbie, eyes glazed, bellowed, "Are you a Yippie?" 
"Well, not quite. I participated in last week's demonstration if that's what you mean." "Well, I want to congratulate you. It was a horrible thing those 
cops had done. You know, I once organized labor for Studebaker .. I know what it is to stand up fur what you believe ... You know, if you ever need a cabbie, call Mr. Peterson, cab number twenty-two." 
I shook his hand, discussed Mayor Daley, and departed. 
Everybody has got to study this oncoming revolution in their own way and contribute to it in their own secret, subtle, creative fashion. Norman Mailer, speaking at Grant Park 
No more Miss America! What is so ignored as last year's Miss America? This only reflects the gospel of our society, according to Saint Male: women must be young, juicy, malleable -hence age discrimination and the cult of yuuth. To win approval we must be both sexv and wholesome, delicate but able to cope, demure yet tintill~tingly bitchy. Deviation ofany sort brings, we are told, disaster: "You won't get a man. " 
The New York Women's Liberation League statement Yes, the New York Women's Liberation League was mustering forces for the pageant protest (women only) in the fall. Peace and freedom Party circulated brochures and Free Huey placards. Chicago Film Co-op and Newsreel cameraman teams were shooting stock foot­age for free, national public screenings. Progressive Labor Party sold their periodicals on the streets. No bureaucratic compulsion, no commercial slickness -people came each with individual skills and dissents. And the consolidated protest of young and old, Puerto Rican, Black, white upper middle class seemed to underscore the universality of dissatisfaction. Jean Genet pledged international support. And the press coverage made the revolutionary vernacular household idiom Chicago mothers once controlled their children with goblins and roving fairies, resorted to a "You'll be the first to go when the revolution comes." And here at the house that Knute built, with its subterfuged prefects and inflated ROTC contingent, perhaps the dutiful "Up For the Kick-off' may be mingled this year with a vehement "Up with the Revolution."

A board of tutors is currently being selected, with a repre­sentative from each hall to contact any freshmen requiring assistance. Tutors arc urgently needed to insure the success of the program. Those willing to donate two hours a week should contact either Scott Kral" (8448) in 21 Sorin or Sweeney (8440) in 31 Sorin. 
Future Plans 

ll1e University will develop 5,500 acres of primitive woodland it owns along the Michigan-Wisconsin border as both a conference and recreation site and as a research area. 
The property was bequeathed in 1943 to Notre Dame by Martin Gillen, a native of Wisconsin. A complex of buildings built by Gillen on Tenderfoot Lake's Killarney Point has been used in recent years by the University as a remote conference site. 
Dr. Frederick J. Crosson, 
former Chairman of the General 
Program of Liberal Studies here, 
has been appointed Dean of the 
College of Arts and Letters. The 
appointment was made June 17 
and took effect last week. The 
final selection of Dr. Crosso11 as 
Dean was made by Father 
Hesburgh and was based on the 
recommendations of the faculty 
of the College; it was announced 
by Rev. John Walsh, C.S.C., Vice 
President for Academic Affairs. 
Crosson succeeds Rev. Charles 
E. Sheedy, C. S. C., who was appointed last April 21 to the newly-created post of Dean of Theological Studies and Institutes. Father Sheedy had been Dean of Arts and Letters for sixteen years, previous to which he was a member of the Theology faculty here. 
Dean Crosson commented yesterday on his appointment: "Having myself enjoyed teaching in the college. for 15 years, I hope I will be able to bring some sense of the role of the teacher and of the necessity for personal encounter with the student to the deanship." Dean Crosson has been a member of the faculty of the General Program since 1953 and served as its chairman from 1964 until last year, when he took a sabbatical leave. He devoted the year to lecturing at the University of Chicago and continuing his researches in phenomenology. 
In addition to teaching at Notre Dame, Crosson was a FrenchGovernment Fellow at the University of Paris during 1951-52 and held a Belgian-American Foundation Fellowship at Louvain 1957-58. 
Dr. Crosson is one of the most 
ardent and articulate defenders of the seminar method as it is used in the General Program; he once suggested that "the student l!:arns best by developing his own view and being forced to defend it. He must master the steps to a conclusion," rather than mouth glib generalities. The seminar, he contends, makes 
education "a highly personal 
affair, an intersubjective 
process." Crosson received his training 
in philosophy at the Catholic University of America and at Notre Dame. He wrote his doctoral dissertation here under lJr. A. Robert Caponigri of the Philosophy Department. 
Dr. Crosson also said yesterday that he was. 
"delighted" that he was "the
first dean of the College chosen by the faculty of the College." The procedure used to chose the new dean was prescribed in the 
new Faculty Manual. The College Council first appointed a five man board to review recommendations from individual faculty members and to then submit its joint recomme1Hhltion to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. 
Rev. Walsh submitted his own recommendations along with the committee's to the President. The President made the final selection. The members of the College's committee were Matthew A. Fitzsimons and Bernard Norling, members of.the History Department, Robert

Nu ne r, Chairman of the 
Department of Classical .and 
Modern Languages, and Rev. 
Ernan McMullin and John J. 
Fitzgerald, Chairman and 
Professor, respectively, in the 
Philosophy Department. 
In addition to his work in the 
GP, Crosson heads up, with Prof. 
Kenneth Sayre, the 
Philosophical Institute for 
Artificial Intelligence. His work 
at the Institute has been largely 
directed toward phenomenol­
ogy. The purpose of the 
Institute, as Sayre and Crosson 
define it, is "to study, 
constructively and without 
polemic, the interaction between 
computer technology and 
varioUf philosophic conceptions 
of the nature of man." It is

Great Exp~ctation~ .for Irish Offense 
BY JOHN HEINRICH 
One of the traditional games coaches play about this time of year is bemoaning the loss of veteran players and complaining of their squads' lack of talent and/or experience. Notre Dame Head Coach Ara Parseghian has been forced to search for other pessimistic platitudes in describing this year's Irish offense. With seven starters and numerous top reserves returning, the offensive unit will be strong and deep at virtually every position. The principal question will be whether or not the Irish veterans, in particular those in the backfield, can repeat their 

strong performances of last

"Sports reporting lacked completeness, especially in football. Sometimes only a few plays were in the Irish Eye column. Statistics were usually missing in reports of both football and basketball games. And in the midst of the best basketball season in a decade, an away game against Air Force and the next home game against Detroit, both victories, were mentioned only in the News in Brief. No report whatsoever appeared on the away Craighton game. Though both picture and copy coverage of basketball increased later in the year, this almost total lapse in sports reporting was inexcusable for the greatest part of the student body which usually considered sports more important than the latest student senate report."---1968 Dome. 
That evaluation of our 1967 performance is false. In fact, this department is considering a libel suit against the yearbook. We weren't that bad last year and our readers know it. 
We were worse. Yes, we were 0-1 0. The Scholastic scored on us, Joe Doyle and his South Bend Tribune scored on us, the Juggler scored on us. High point of the year was beating the River City Review on an inside look at the athletic prowess of Lenny Joyce. Now, Joyce is gone and, consequently, we must go straight We will ... and with quality, no less. This fall, United Press International brings a national angle to these pages and that fact alone will improve them 500 per cent. 
UPI columnist Milt Richman, a former minor league baseball player with 30 years of writing experience, will appear occasionally. 
Irish quarterback Terry Hanratty returns with his weekly column. His first effort is scheduled in Saturday's NO-Oklahoma football special, the first of six such issues. 
Innovation time from editor Bill Luking: This year's football specials will be distributed free of charge to students and other fans. They will include complete lineups, statistics and features on the day's game. 
Add to that, a daily page which combines national and NO news. We can't be any worse than 8-2 this year and that might be good enough to win the South Bend area sports journalism championship. 
All-America rating at the other tackle spot. Kunz is big, fast, and violent when he wants to be and should make a lasting impression on opposing defensive ends. Soph Mike Martin is his replacement. 
Senior Jim Winegardner is set at tight end. He is a good receiver and a powerful blocker. Dewey Poskon will back him up. 
Superb split end Jim Seymour returns to pursue those receiver records he does not hold already. He should have better luck getting open this year with a solid complement of running backs to balance the offense. He need only worry about keeping his fingers from being shattered by one of Hanratty's bullets. Tom Eaton may get to play if Seymour tires of scoring touchdowns. 
Last year the Irish waited until midseason to develop a credible running attack. Most of the principals return this year and, hopeful!, will obviate the need for last year's aerial circus. Fullback Jeff Zimmerman is a c·onsistent powerful runner and a sound blocker. he gained 591 yards last year while starting only seven games and, barring injury, could turn into one of the country's top fullbacks this year if the Irish choose to use him enough. Senior Ron Dushney will push Zimmerman for the starting spot. 
Little Frank Criniti has cracked the starting lineup after a fine performance last Saturday and will be hard to displace. Versatile Coley O'Brien, now an offensive halfback, will be his replacement and needs only experience to complement the running talent he has shown at quarterback. 
Two-year letterman Bob Gladieux will be the other halfback. He is a smooth runner and an exceptional pass receiver, ranking second on the team last year. He will play flanker when Parseghian chooses to go with

Defensive tackle Bob Jockish, a probable starter, was hit with a shoulder separation the same day. His status is as doubtful as Olson's. 
In last Saturday's scrimmage, Joe Freeberry and Mike Kondrla two wide receivers and his presence there should help take some of the pressure off Seymour. Junior Ed Ziegler will back him up. 
Of course, Terry Hanratty is back, presumably still having a bazooka concealed in his right sleeve. The difficulties he had early last year are history now. He has matured well, learning to spot second and third receiers and even eating the ball occasionally. He should be the premier quarterback in college football this year and a prime candidate for the Heisman Trophy. 
The Irish should be both more exciting and more consistent than they were last year. With a good offensive line and competent running backs to relieve the pressure on them, Hanratty and Seymour should rediscover the effectiveness that 
made them cover stories in 1966. The Irish will score often-as often as the defense can get them the ball.
