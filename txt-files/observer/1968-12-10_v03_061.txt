At least one person was ar­rested in the latest confronta­tion. 
Some 300 officers swept across the strike torn campus after the militants staged their smallest noontime rally since striking early last month. Only about 400 persons turned out for the rally. 
With Negro community lead­ers again in attendance, the demonstrators marched twice around the commons on the heart of the campus-dampened with rocks and bricks, a squad of 40 officers quickly moved be­tween the demonstrators and the building. This was followed by a march toward the administration building office of Acting Presi­dent S. I. Hayakawa. The other police joined the first squad of officers to sweep the dissidents from the campus. 
For the start of classes in the second week of a get tough policy of Hayakawa, the campus was relatively quiet. 
For the first time, leaflets were distributed on the campus opposing the strike.

Black power is a frustrating thing at Notre Dame. It is the ncar inevitable result of the increasing consciousness of the black community as it searches for its proper identity in our society. In that alone there is nothing wrong with it, but problems emerge when it is considered in the context of a University. 
Black students arc looking for power to compel the University to grant them certain "rights". Whether what they seck arc "rights" is another question. Is it a right of black students, for instance, that they make up I0% of the students body because I 0% of the U.S. is black? The answer has to be no, because coming to Notre Dame is a right for no one, a privilege for all. 
The question is better put if one asks if it is reasonable for black enrollment to be increased, the change being similar to the difference between "demand" and "request". To this question the answer seems to be that that the best solution is to increase black enrollment gradually, without any mandatory level to be achieved. This would have the advantages of making Notre Dame part of an effort to educate those who need the opportunity greatly, while avoiding the necessity of wholesale discrimination against white applicants in a race to bring about too sudden an influx of large numbers of black students, a sudden influx which could lead to racial tension. 
A very real question though is whether anything short of their demands will reduce militancy among black students. First, compromises may be used as merely an occasion to agitate for their full demands. Second, even if demands for changes within the University arc met, it is very possible that blacks will then usc Notre Dame as a "base" for protesting conditions throughout our society. 
Regardless of the validity of the protests, the problem is whether militancy is proper to a University community. The real question is whether any "Power" is proper in a University, which is (theoretically anyway) a community of scholars, searching for the truth about things. The answer is yes-if one conceiVes of University education as a thing gained primarily, or even in great part, by experience and action. But a University education is not that. 
People who desire experience and action can find it in many places outside the University -Vista, the Peace Corps, one's hometown slum, or even the army for that matter. The thing which . is peculiar to a University education is that it provides a time and place to stop, study, and reflect on the issues for men of all ages, together with other people searching for the answers to those great problems, and with the help of men dedicated to the search for the truth about these matters. This is the type of education which Notre Dame should be providing, and in that context militancy of any type can only be harmful to a University. 
Black Power then can be desirable at Notre Dame if it involves a calm evaluation of problems, and moderate ideas and proposals. When the tunc becomes an angry "demand for rights", then black power has no place in our University.
