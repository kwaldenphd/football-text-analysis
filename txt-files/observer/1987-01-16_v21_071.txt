Off-campus students victims of fire, burglary 
By REGIS COCCIA Assistant News Editor 
A fire gutted the Turtle Creek apart­ment of a Notre Dame student Thursday morning, causing $35,000 damage. 
"It took 45 minutes to get (the fire) under control. I'd say it happened at 
10:30 (Thursday morning)," said South Bend Fire Chief George Giory. "Other apartments sustained water and smoke damage. 
"The fire report said the fire was caused by paper products on the stove," said Giory. Fire Inspector John Nelson said "The burners were in the 'on' position." 
Turtle Creek Apartments Manager Pat Hutchings said neither of the apart­ment's residents, Joseph Sullivan, a Notre Dame sophomore, and his bro­ther Martin, was in the apartment at the time the fire occurred. 
Hutchings said the apartment is "completely gutted," adding, "Everything is under control. There's no major problems other than I feel bad for the boys." 
Hutchings said both residents will be placed in another Turtle Creek apart­ment. The residents could not be con­tacted for comment. 
In other off-campus incidents, four burglaries were reported by Notre Dame students, according to Sergeant John McCullum, east sector coordina­tor for the South Bend Police Depart­ment. 
McCullum said stereo and camera equipment was stolen in the burglaries, which occurred at four different off­campus locations. "It's hard to say when the burglaries occurred," McCul­lum said. "The students were gone for two weeks and the burglaries weren't reported until the students returned. 
"There were a couple that got hit with a big loss, but not like five months ago when the students first came to school," McCullum said. "I was surprised at the amount of burglaries this year, it's way down. At the begin­ning of the year is when most (burglaries) occur, that's the trend of the past," said McCullum. 
According to McCullum, the South Bend Police Department advises stu­dents living off-campus to put away valuables during extended vacations. 
The Off-Campus Housing Office said security and safety information is given to all off-campus residents. The office said more than 3,000 undergraduate and graduate students live off-campus. 
Director of Notre Dame Security Rex Rakow said one on-campus room was entered during the Christmas break. According to Rakow, Security is inves­tigating the incident. 
5 halls extend parietals hours 
By CINDY RAUCKHORST and LISA DAVISON Staff Reporters 
Five residence hall rectors have opted to extend Sunday parietals to 
12:30 a.m., expressing approval for the Student Senate effort to increase the time available for socializing after late hall masses. 
Students in Dillon, Morrissey, Pasquerilla West, St. Edward, and Zahm halls will begin extending their hours this Sunday, while 15 other dorms 
Curran decides not to try to teach his classes 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Suspended theologian Charles Curran said Thursday he had "blinked" in his face-off with Roman Cath­olic leaders, dropping his ef­forts to teach this spring at Catholic University of America out of fear further pushing could hurt his students and Catholic education in general. 
Curran, a priest under Vatican fire for his dissenting views on sexual ethics, said earlier this week he would show up to teach his classes at the start of the school's new term Thursday despite his suspen­sion Monday. 
However, he said, he decided against that action after the university's chancellor, Wash­ington Archbishop James Hick­ey, threatened to invoke a church-law provision that Cur­ran said might have spread the controversy to other Catholic universities. 
"If there is a story today, it is that Curran blinked," the theology professor told reporters. About 200 students also attended the campus news conference, interrupting occa­sionally with applause for the popular professor. 
Curran said he would not give up his longer-term efforts to win reinstatement, and he said those efforts might well end up in civil court. 
But he said he would "not make my students hostages in this ongoing controversy" by teaching them in classes that were officially canceled by the university on Wednesday and therefore might well provide no official credit. 

In addition, he said he wanted to avoid provoking Hickey into invoking the church's "canon 812," a provi­sion that states: 
"It is necessary that those who teach theological disci­plines in any institute of higher studies have a mandate from the competent ecclesiastical authority.'' 
Curran's suspension was not based on that canon but on a declaration by the Vatican last summer that he was unfit to teach as a Catholic theologian because of what Pope John Paul II and other church leaders believe are too liberal views on birth control, homosexuality, divorce and other sexual issues. 
The Vatican declaration is important in Curran's case be­
cause Catholic University, the only Vatican-chartered college 
in  this  country,  requires  a  
church-sponsored  "canonical  
mission"  -or  theologian's  

license -for teachers in certain programs. 
Similar requirements do not exist at independent Catholic universities, such as Notre Dame, Georgetown and others. And the broader church author­ity over professors spelled out in canon 812 has not been in­voked at any U.S. catholic school since it was issued as part of a general revision of church law four years ago. 
Leaders of many U.S. catho­lic colleges are vigorously op­posing Vatican efforts to ex­pand on the brief canon in more elaborate regulations. 
await decisions by their hall staffs. 
The rectors of Alumni, Pangborn and Sorin halls said they have chosen not to approve the extension, a decision which was left open to rectors after ap­proval by both the Campus Life Council and Father David Tyson, vice president for student affairs. 
Father George Rozum, Alumni Hall rector, whose dorm holds one of the two 11 p.m. Sunday masses, said the parie­tals extension is unnecessary.

Mating season was over weeks ago but a wild moose in Shrewsbury, Vt. is still making cow eyes at a brown and white Hereford named Jessica. When farm owner Larry Carrara spreads grain for his cows, the moose stands up and nudges a few cows aside to let Jessica eat. "He always watches out for Jessica," Carrara said. "He's acting like he likes it here. He's playing like a big shot," game warden Donald Gallus said Tuesday, 40 days after the love-struck moose wandered in to civilization. -Associated Press

"I don't know what I'm going to do with my life. At this point, I don't feel like I can do anything right," said a friend of mine from back Kevin home during a conversation over break.

My friend and I attended high school together and became the best of friends towards the end of our senior year. During the following sum­mer we were out almost every night partying, enjoying a seemingly pressureless period before college. Then, I went off to Notre Dame and he went to LSU.

Notre Dame Communication and Theatre Film Series 
Th1s week at the Snite, the spring film series begins with three great films: 
Monday, January 19 at 7:00 and 9:00pm Casablanca (1942) BW, 102 min. Directed by Michael Curtiz, USA 

Everything is right in this WWII classic of war-torn Casablanca with elusive nightclub owner Humphrey Bogart finding old flame Ingrid Bergman and her husband, underground leader Paul Henreid, among skeletons in his closel Claude Rains is marvelous as the dapper police chief, and nobody sings "As Time Goes By" like Dooley Wilson. See it in preparation for Woody Allen's tribute, Play It Again, Sam, scheduled to show Friday, Jan. 30. As a special introduction to the spring film series, the first 300 patrons will be admitted to Casablanca free for both the 7:00 and 9:00 show. Come and pick up a film calendar. 
Tuesday, January 20 at 7:30 pm Carefree (1938) BW, 80 min. Directed by March Sandrich, USA 

Madcap Ginger Rodgers goes to psychiatrist Fred Astaire in this wacky musical comedy with outstanding Irvin Berlin numbers in which the cure is true love. Here the Astair&Rodgers series is inflected by the screwball comedy to produce a musical that is funnier than ever. 
Friday, January 23 at 7:30 and 9:30pm Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) Color, 100 min. Directed by Woody Allen 

By all accounts, one of Woody Allen's greatest films and the best film of 1986, this is one of the film's last college showings before it is pulled from distribution to wait for the academy awards and theatrical re-release. Both a drama about three sisters and their romantic entanglements and a satirical comedy about 1V producer Allen's fears that he may have a fatal disease, Hannah is Allen's first real audience film since Annie Hall. With Michael Caine, Mia Farrow, Carrie Fischer, and Barbara Hershey. 
All shown at the Annenberg Auditorium, Snite Museum. Individual admission $1.50. Series tickets also available. Film calendars will be coming in the first issue of Scholastic Magazine. Or pick up a copy in 320 O'Shaughnessy or at the door at the Snite.

New Soviet negotiator meets with American delegation 
Associated Press 
GENEVA -Superpower nu­clear arms talks resumed Thursday with a luncheon meeting between U.S. delega­tion head Max Kampelman and his new Soviet counterpart, Yuli Vorontsov. 
The two delegation leaders met privately at Soviet re­quest, instead of heading a meeting of all three top negotiators from each side, which normally marks the beginning of a round. 
The talks have been bogged down from the start by dis­agreement, among other things, over U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative research for a space-based defense against nuclear attack, popularly called "Star Wars." 
U.S. spokesman Terry Shroeder said he had no infor­mation on when the next ses­sion in the seventh round of arms talks would be. "I have nothing for the news media on this as yet," he said. 
Asked about the results of Thursday's session, which was the two men's first meeting, he said, "it went fine." He declined further comment.

Church  and  society,"  said  
Hehir.  
Hehir  addressed  how  the  

Church can practically inter­act with society. "The question that needs to be answered is what role do religious institu­tions play in society? And I think what needs to be drawn upon are histories from West­ern and American political dis­courses. Voluntary associa­tions are groups that are not organized by the state," he said. 
"Voluntary associations are organized from below in soci­ety. The forces in Voluntary or­ganizations must define what role it plays in society." 
Hehir discussed the role of the Church concerning the United States' abortion policy, nuclear policy, the military policy in Central America and the equity of the economy in Central America. 
"It is virtually impossible to find another organization that joins the position on abortion and nuclear war in a distinctive way. The Church cuts across these issues in a distinctive way." 
Hehir said there is a two­factored moral equation in re­lation to abortion. The question of the state and the individual leads to the question of expand­ing the role to invade individual freedom. 
Hehir cited the abortion issue as an on-going struggle in soci­ety. "It is a remarkable factor that 13 years after the decision concerning abortion was made, it is still regarded as not accep­table," Hehir said.

Planes collide over Salt Lake valley, debris hits houses 
Associated Press 
SALT LAKE CITY -A com­muter airplane about to land and a private plane that had just taken off collided over the Salt Lake Valley on Thursday, killing at least 12 people and showering debris over a resi­dential area, authorities said. 
Falling wreckage damaged three houses, but there were no fires and apparently no one on the ground was hurt, said Salt Lake County Fire Marshal Frank Brown, who confirmed the death toll. 
Dozens of police, sheriff's deputies and firefighters rushed to the snowy crash site about 15 miles southwest of

"Our staff has decided we're going to keep the hours the same as they've been. We don't feel we need to change the pres­ent policy," Rozum said. 
Most rectors of undecided dorms said the extension prob­ably would be passed at staff meetings early next week. 
"The extension seems to be 
a reasonable request on the 
part of the students," noted 
Grace Hall's Father Gerald 
Lardner. 
Sister Marietta Murphy of Badin concurred with Lardner. 
"We haven't had a need to change Sunday night parietals in Badin because our mass is at 10:30. But if other dorms do need this change, we're open to the idea," she said. 
The decision in most dorms will be a group effort by the rector, assistant rector and resident assistants, whose duty hours would be extended to en­force the new hours. In Badin Hall, however, each student will cast her own vote. 
"We're going to let the wo­men in the dorm direct us on our decision," rector Murphy said. 
Brian Holst, chairman of the Student Senate committee on parietals, presented the idea last semester as a way to facilitate "co-ed receptions" after hall masses. 
The Campus Life Council passed the proposal to extend Sunday parietal hours at a Nov. 20 meeting. 
Tyson approved the proposal one week later, giving hall rec­tors "discretion to withhold this extension," as explained in his letter to Student Body Pres­ident Mike Switek.

p.m. MST while flying at 7,000 
feet about eight miles south­west of the main Salt Lake City airport over Kearns. 
Tom Doyle, the airport's as­sistant air traffic manager, said the plane was about to turn into its final approach when the collision occurred. 
Visibility at the time was 30 miles with a cloud ceiling of 7,000 feet, according to FAA spokesman Fred Farrar in Washington. Winds up to 60 mph were whipping through the area shortly afterward. Several inches of snow lay on the ground. 
A temporary morgue and command post were set up at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church, where parts of bodies fell in the parking lot and on the steps of a nearby church­run school, said sheriff's Lt. Bill van Wagenen.

Compassion was not shown in Howard decision 
P.O.BoxQ 
Writer's behavior does not demonstrate insight 
Dear Editor: 
We were once more treated to Adolfo Calero's "inside story" on Nicaragua in Viewpoint (December 2). I cannot forget his disruptive "interventions" when Edgar Chamorro spoke here last year, and if his antics were similar during Vice President Ramirez' talk last semester, he should have been told to "sit down and shut up." Civility is a precondition for the free interchange of a university and those who abuse it only show that they need to be reminded of that fact. Moreover, Calero's breezy libel of liberation theology (in his December 2 letter) should alert stu­dents to the reliability of this particular "insider's" view of matters in Central America. I can only hope his work as

New policy could solve drunk driving problem 
Dear Editor: 
In the final Tuesday '86 The Obser­ver, Bacchus club President John Sheehy declared: "We want to create an awareness . and educate people to what drinking and driving can do." This statement simply represents an­other useless effort to curb the problem of drunk driving. Awareness is not the problem, drunk driving is. We no longer need to increase awareness, we need to find a solution to drunk driving. We believe that the alcohol policy is the root of this problem. Because of the policy, students go off to campus to so­cialize and to drink, which leads to drunk driving. 

The solution is not to ban alcohol from the Notre Dame campus. Alcohol has always been, and always will be, a so­cial catylyst. While some may contend that alcohol is not necessary for effec­tive socialization, the fact remains that people find it to be effective and useful for the promotion of necessary social intercourse. People will find ways to consume alcohol, regardless of any im­posed restrictions. The alcohol policy is one such restriction, and students have circumvented this restriction by drinking off campus, for which driving is often necessary. 
The solution is not tighter restrictions on alcohol, but rather, removal of the alcohol policy to allow open alcohol con­
sumption on campus. This would en-......-__________.:..F..:..la:.:..n..:..n..:..e:....r_H..:...:...a.:..:,ll

courage people to stay on campus rather than leaving the campus to drink, which endangers lives. 
In order to prevent students from driving off campus while intoxicated under the open alcohol policy, security could monitor the students as they left the parking lots. Gates could be erected and manned on Friday and Saturday nights at the parking lot exits. To avoid inconvenience for those who have not indulged in alcohol, the exits should be manned only during those hours in which alcohol consumption is most likely to occur. 
Drunk driving obviously leads to tragic consequences. We are already aware of the problem, which is en­hanced by the alcohol policy, so let's find a solution.

My last c·olumn was entitled, "Caring People Make Notre Dame Special" Being a responsible, mature journalist I now must admit that I was wrong, very wrong. 
Tom Varnum Third and Long 
I am (or was) a resident of Howard Hall. Exactly one week before my finals began, I was ruthlessly informed that I was being thrown out of my hall next year. Will somebody please pull the knife out of my back? It was a lovely thought to contemplate while studying for finals. Now, I understand the Uni­versity would like to improve the male­female ratio, but the way they went about it was vicious and cruel. As angry and bitter as I am right now, I will try to analyze this decision in as rational a manner as possible. 
The first mistake the administration made was the time between announce­ment and implementation. They in­formed us one semester before we are to be moved. All of a sudden, Howard is a women's dorm. Ideally, they should have given us at least a year's notice. Even the residents of Holy Cross Hall were informed of their eviction more than a year before the actual action. People could have moved to other dorms after the semester in order to improve chances for an R.A. or hall government position. As it stands now, juniors and sophomores have little to no chance of becoming an R.A. in their new "home away from home". Al­though these positions are theoretically open to all juniors across campus, the juniors and sophomores from Howard will have virtually no chance at them. The juniors and sophomores will be complete strangers in their new halls. They will be as new to the hall as the freshmen! The lack of time between announcement and implementation of the conversion of Howard did a terrible injustice to the residents. 
Another mistake concerns room ana hall picks for next year. The informa­tion given to us is quite vague. Will the upperclassmen of Howard get stuck with traditionally freshman rooms in other dorms? It doesn't seem fair to the original residents of the hall to be bumped down the lottery list because of newcomers from other halls. How this dilemma will be solved is not. known. Another problem centers around the tremendous amount of single rooms in Howard. Most Howard residents have lived in singles for most of their time here and were expecting to continue living in singles. Many are used to the single life and will find it hard to live with a roommate. Don't laugh. Remember what it was like living with a stranger freshman year after hving with your family for a long time? For Howard residents, it is the same situation. They have lived with the same guys for their years at Notre Dame and now they will be thrown in with strangers, again. 

Why Howard? Sure, it's the smallest dorm, but is that the best choice? St. Ed's and Carroll are about the same size, why not them? First of all, Howard is not in a good location for a girls' dorm. Badin, Walsh and Lyons are all a stone's throw from Howard. It really doesn't make much sense to add an­other girls' dorm in that area. St. Ed's is more centrally located and further away from girls' dorms. Also Howard is mostly singles. Since most of the female Howard residents will be fresh­men, there will be freshmen living in singles. I think singles would tend to isolate shy, immature freshman un­necessarily. Also Howard was just renovated. The bathrooms were all done over. What are they going to do with all the new urinals? I suppose tney figured that by changing the smallest dorm, they would inconvenience the least amount of people. Well, I don't buy that. Because Howard is so small, most of the residents know every other resident. How many residents of the bigger halls can say that? How many 
can say they even know most people on their floor? The small size of Howard should have been a consideration against conversion instead of for it. 
The final and most cold-hearted ploy used by the administration was the form and timing of the announcement. A frigid, impersonal letter was sent to all residents one week before finals! Thank you very much. I really needed some more pressure put on me that week. It is easy to see why the admin­istration decided to put this little pres­ent under our tree at that time. They surmised that with finals coming up, we wouldn't have much time to com­plain or protest. Apparently they in­formed our rector the evening before the letters were placed in the mailbox. He even interviewed some prospective R.A.'s. I am sure he appreciated all the advance notice about losing his job. 
Well, I for one have had enough rationality for one column. The way the administration informed us of this great change in our lives showed a tre­mendous lack of compassion and un­derstanding. It is hard to believe reli­gious people were involved with this decision, but it is true.

Break helps Irish men's swim team 
By THERESA KELLY Sports Writer 
Although the scoreboard did not show it, the Notre Dame men's swim team had a very successful training trip over Christmas Break. The team trained for two weeks at Vil­lanova, but lost to LaSalle, 166­100, on Jan. 9 and was beaten by Villanova the next day, 132­86. 
Coach Tim Welsh called the trip successful in spite of the losses. 
"We made good, steady prog­ress," said Welsh, who was pleased with the way the team grew together as a group during the trip. 
"The swimmers got to know each other better, and they im­proved their swimming greatly, even if they didn't win the meets." 
Both the men's and women's teams took the trip, and both enjoyed the city of Philadel­phia and the hospitality of the families of Philadelphia-area swimmers. As with the wo­men's team, Welsh noted im­provements in team unity, spirit and enthusiasm on the part of the men's squad. 
The results of the training trip may become apparent this weekend, as the Irish take on Northern Illinois (today) and Western Ontario (Saturday) at home before travelling to Northwestern Sunday. 
"We expect to be tested and pushed to our limit this weekend," said Welsh. 
Welsh said the Northern Illi­nois meet will be a toss-up, with a slight edge to Notre Dame be­cause they won last year's meet, 78-62. The men may also have a small anvantage over Western Ontario, but Welsh gives the "home-pool" advan­tage to the Wildcats on Sunday. 

Welsh praised his team's hard work in Philadelphia and said that sooner or later a team gets credit for its efforts. He said he did not know if it would show up this weekend, but that the work always pays off.

back very valiantly. And one 
Denver predicts close game; New York thinks differently 
Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. ­The word out of Denver is that Super Bowl XXI will be a close game because the Broncos weren't blown out in their visit to New York during the season. 
Well, the Giants have heard the word and the message heading West Thursday is; "We're a lot better team now." 
And it's being said by a lot of 
players. 
"We were in a little bit of a down cycle offensively when we played them the first time,'' Giants guard Chris Godfrey. "It was a struggle for us. I think they are an excellent club, but we're playing better now." 
Fellow guard Billy Ard said the Giants were a team in transformation in November. 
"We're not the same," he said. "We were going through change then. We were develop­ing into a fine team. We're an excellent team now." 
There is no doubt the Giants struggled on offense in posting a 19-16 victory over the Broncos Nov. 23. New York was out­gained on offense 405-262 and failed to score a touchdown, with defensive end George Martin returning an intercep­tion 78 yards for the Giants' only TD. 
"They didn't let us move the ball on the ground," said Giants Coach Bill Parcells, whose team gained 143 yards on 36 carries. "We got down close, but we didn't score TDs." 
One of the major weapons missing from the Giants' of­fense in November was wide receiver Lionel Manuel, who was reactivated for the San Francisco playoff game after recovering from a knee injury. 
"He definitely opens things for me," said wide receiver Bobby Johnson. "He runs routes like nobody in the NFL. his speed is back and he's cut­ting on a dime. My ankles would break the way he cuts." 
Giants tackle Carl Nelson said neither the Giants nor the Broncos came close to playing a perfect game earlier this year. 
"I know there were a lot of things that we could have gone better," said Nelson. "The same can be said for them. It should be a good game." 
"They've been tested in a lot of ways. We've just got to make that work to our advantage now. I expect we're going to bounce back just fine. A little adversity is going to be good for their souls." 
DePaul comes to town, as the Irish look to pick up a win and improve their 3-9 record.

Women's swim team drops meets, but improves times over Christmas 

By THERESA KELLY Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's swim team took a training trip to Philadelphia over Christmas break, and even though the team was beaten in its two meets, Coach Tim Welsh was very pleased with the trip. 
The swimmers trained at Vil­lanova from Dec. 28 through Jan. 11. On Jan. 9 they lost to LaSalle, 140-126, in a tough meet that was not decided until the last event, and the next day the Irish were beaten by Vil­lanova. 135-81. 
Despite the losses, Welsh said the trip was a success. 
"We were beaten on the scoreboard," he said, "but we made great improvements over our past times." 
The intense training in Philadelphia made the team as fast or faster than before Christmas, when it trained lightly during exams. Welsh said the long period of concen­trated training without the bur­den of tests and homework was very beneficial to the team. 

"A trip like this is also very positive because the team be­came closer as a group," added Welsh. "Their greater unity, spirit and enthusiasm was ap­parent." 
The trip was not all hard work for the Irish women. The men's team also trained at Vil­lanova, and the swimmers visited historic Philadelphia, attended the Notre Dame­Pennsylvania basketball game and spent time with the families of four swimmers from the Philadelphia area. 
The Irish will be tested in a three-day challenge this weekend, hosting Northern Il­linois today, Western Ontario Saturday, and then travelling to Northwestern. Sunday. A goal of the team is to have a winning record in dual meets this year, and Welsh said this weekend could be the deciding factor. 
"The Northern Illinois meet is too close to call," said Welsh, noting that the Irish lost last year, 82-58. "We should have a slight advantage over Western Ontario, but will probably be at a disadvantage at Northwes­tern. 
"Each meet will be decided in the water. The team can make its own destiny." 
The Northern Illinois meet starts tonight at 6 and Western Ontario visits Rolfs Aquatic Center at 2:00 Saturday.

In the backcourt are a pair of speedsters who both can han­dle the ball, in 6-1 senior J .J. Crawl (6.5 pts.) and 6-2 sopho­more Herbie Brooks (7.8 points). Sophomore forward Darryl Prue, at 6-7, is the team's top substitute, averag­ing 10.8 points and 5.7 rebounds per contest. 
But Notre Dame is coming 
on. 

"Even though our guards, (David) Rivers and (Scott) Hicks, have been our scoring leaders so far," Phelps said, "our front line is starting to come on. I like some of the things Gary Voce and Scott Paddock have done lately, es­pecially as far as defense and rebounding are concerned." 
The Irish head into what Phelps calls the toughest part of the schedule in the next two weeks. After tomorrow's game, Notre Dame has a week to prepare for a game at UCLA, before returning home for four consecutive contests--against Dayton, Marquette, North Carolina and LaSalle. 
IRISH ITEMS-David Rivers and Scott Hicks have been slowed because of minor injur­ies this week. Rivers injured his right ankle and Hicks suf­fered a thigh bruise, and each was being held from practice as of Wednesday. Both are ex­pected to play tomorrow.
