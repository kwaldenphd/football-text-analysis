Weathers, ofHarwood Heights, Ill., says men have an advantage ofheight and reach over women, but that doesn't stop her from winning mixed tournaments.

The greatest show on Earth 
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the greatest show on Earth. It is not all fun and games -actually it is pretty serious. It is not put on by Barnum and Bailey, it is not Sweeney Todd and it is not Notre Dame football. It is the United States elections-presidential style. 
The current showing began approximately two years ago. Act I 
In this act the presidential hopefuls strive for their party's nomination. It starts with the candidate coming oil stage and saying that he or she wants to be the next president. It is never a surprise because the media are informed well in advance to assure good coverage for the candidate. 
In the next scene the candidates go out and try to convince the audience that, although they have the same ideals as the other candidates from their party, they are the better choice. They cut each others ideas down. This is where George Bush called Ronald

talking about them for a while. 
In another scene the candidates face each other in front ofhuge television audiences in great debates. Tili.s where the people backstage get their credit, as the can­didates are judged on such things as makeup, clothing and posture. It has become less and less what the can­didate says and more and more how he says it that is important. 
One important role in this act is that ofthe pollsters. Everyday someone tells you that if the election were

reconciled and party unity is strong. One candidate is put forward and what he will stand for is decided upon. Earlier in the century the conventions were where it was all decided and it might take more than 50 ballots to decide on a candidate, but now it takes just one. The person who has mustered enough support goes on to Act II. 
Act II 
This is where the now clearly established lead char­acters, fresh from victory at the conventions, go head to head with each other. They stop in every city they can, with the goal of getting some votes and getting on the evening news to get some more. 
The vice presidential candidates come into the picture in this scene. They are there for a humorus aside. It is dearly established that they have had parking tickets and other crimes against humanity or use terms picked up in the world ofsport. In the end it turns out that they are really not that bad but everyone had fun and decide which one has done a better job throughout the show. Four years ago people were enraged when television networks picked winners berfore the voting was done. For the last two years the pollsters have showed an aged elephant well ahead of the donkey which may explain why only approximately half of the audience takes the initiative to go out and critique the show, even though the outcome affects everyone. 
The show lasts a long time and does have some draw­backs. It is time consuming and not always thrilling. Ad­mission is free, although it is expensive to play a lead role. Despite the drawbacks the show has made the change ofleadership in America a non-violent workable transgression. The lead role is the most difficult to per­form. It requires experience, skill and charisma. Taking this all into account it is no wonder we are about to elect an actor, again.

Suspected larcenies in past month raise questions of building security 
By CINDY RAUCKHORST 
NewsSUlff 
Two suspected larcenies in the past month have raised questions about the present security systems in the Architecture Building. 
The first suspected larceny oc­curred in late September, when an unknown number of suspects al­legedly entered the open building and walked away with approxi­mately 5800 worth of equipment and personal goods. 
A second suspected larceny oc­curred on the morning of Oct. 21. The building was left open during midsemester break for use by stu­dents who remained on campus, as it has been done in the past. 
Architecture student Ed Garagan, who was working in the building on Sunday morning, foiled the at­tempted larceny. 
He heard unfamiliar voices, traced them to three suspects carrying a bag ofitems belonging to various ar­chitecture students, and then pursued dtem as they left the build­ing and headed across campus. 
The suspects then attempted to enter the Art Building and the Cus­hing Hall of Engineering. 
It seemed the campus was "one big candy box," for the suspects, said Garagan. 
Garagan apprehended the three suspects and summoned Notre Dame Security. Before security 
~m.c. 
arrived, one ofthe suspects escaped. 
The other two were taken into custody by security officers. The third suspect is currently being sought in the South Bend area. 
The two alleged thefts have caused an examination of the de­partment's entire security system. 
In past years, several architecture students have been victimized by isolated incidents of theft, but not to a serious extent, according to Bob Amico, chairman of the School ofAr­chitecture. 
Because of the high value of equipment stolen in the September incident as well as the foiled second attempt, students and faculty decided to confront the problem more seriously than in the past, he said. 
Following the first conflict, stu­dents wrote a letter to Amico, asking for immediate action " to ensure the safety of students, their equipment, and facilities." 
Installation of a combination push-button lock system similar to the type used in the Art Building was proposed. 
Both students and faculty agree that communication has been a vital aspect of their success in confront· ing the problem. Margaret Derwent, architecture student, said "If you don't care for the needs of the stu­dents, a department cannot work successfully. The faculty are responsive to our needs." 

Following the first alleged lar­ceny, Amico asked the students for recommendations. He investigated possible security solutions, such as a Detex system or a push-button com­bination lock system. 
After input from the students, he ordered installation of a combina­tion lock system. 
It is not yet known when the sys­tem will be installed. Amico is optimistic about the new system. 
"The combination lock will not completely solve the problem, but it will help to discourage thieves," he said. "Students are also becoming more aware of the importance of using personal security methods, such as taking care to lock up per­sonal belongings when not working at the building. This is also an impor­tant aspect of our new security awareness," Amico said. 
Derwent expressed optimism also, saying that continuing commu­nication between students and fac­ulty will help ensure the success of the new security system. 
Glen Terry, director of Notre Dame Security, emphasized the im­portance of students' personal se­curity responsiblities. He said the problem is the students' lack of responsiblity in locking up their own items ofvalue. 
Another part of the problem is that students are too trusting ofeach other, Terry said. ·

they gain their independence," he said. 
Regarding the United States, Pul­lapilly said "the United States should see this as a new beginning for rela­tions with India. Indira Gandhi leaned to the left of the political spectrum, and was more ofan ally of the Soviet Union." 
The United States supplies money , and armaments to Pakistan, and "we should use our influence over the Pakistanis to attempt to diffuse the Sikh problem," he said. "Pakistan radio is exciting tensions by broad­casting propaganda for the Sikh separation movement. 
"And we should try to achieve a long-term peace between India and Pakistan," because these nations have had two military conflicts since India's independence from Great Britain in 1948, said Pullapilly. 
As the world's largest democracy, India has much in common with the United States and "better relations between the two nations makes sense," he said.

Students explore world of ex-cons 
By KATIIRYN HUMM 
News Staff 
Many of the stereotypes about ex­convicts are not true, according to a Saint Mary's senior who spent fall break at a halfway house for ex­convicts. 
"There are many stereotypes about ex-convicts and this was a chance to find out that these stereotypes just aren't true," said Vivian Ostrowski. "It was an oppor­tunity to find out about people in less affluent posistions." 
Notre Dame students Carol Gales and Sue Berry accompanied Ostrowski on the visit. 
They stayed at Dismas House in Nashville, Tenn., a place where ex­convicts can stay after leaving prison andbefore entering society. 
One of three such homes located in Tennessee, Dismas House is run by the United Religious Community of Nashville. According to Ostrowski, it is a "Christian commu­nity where everyone helps one an­other. 
"Dismas House is a home, not a hotel. Each person has their own thing to do but they come together for community activities -dinner being the major daily activity and house meetings the required weekly activity," she said. 
Ostrowski became interested in Dismas House through Gales, who spent a summer doing a service proj­ect there. Ostrowski, Gales and Berry spent their week meeting the people at Dismas House and explor­ing Nashville. 
Dismas House is home to many types of ex-convicts: men and wo­men, young and old (the ages ranged from 20 to 80) and black and white, Ostrowski said. 
She believes one of the reasons why she learned so much was that she entered into the spirit of Dismas House. It was important for her to not be an outsider, she said. 
Within three hours, she felt at home. She said, "The spirit between the ex-convicts and the students was one of camaraderie rather than in­timidation." 
"It was a lot of fun, I would definidy do it again," Ostrowski said. "It opened up a new culture and made a whole different group of Americans seem real to me. I would encourage other students to become informed about criminal justice." 

New concentration focuses on Middle East 
By DIANNE MCBRIEN 
News Staff 
AMediterranean/Middle East area studies concentration will be of­fered at Notre Dame for the first time this year. 
Created early this semester, the program is open for registration for the spring, and students may sign up in the Anthropology Office. 
Dircct~d by Prof~ssor Kenneth 
Moore, chairman of Notre Dame's 
anthropology dq>artm~nt. the con­
centration is designed to provide 
each student with th~ best possible 
selection of courses in line with· 
career and academic interests. 
lb~ curriculum includes course offerings &om six Arts and Lettus departm~nts &om which a student, with the help ofan adviser, selects a five-course sequence. 
Advisers will be responsive to spe­cific stud~nt interests, (such as literature, language, politics, or eco­nomics) and will ensure that inter­ests d~velop in a context of a historical and cultural understand­ing of the region. 
The concentration has two types of required courses, one covering the Islamic Mediterranean and an­other the judeo-Christian culture in the area.

Before approval as a concentra­tion, Mediterranean/Middle East studies activities were organized around a nine-member faculty com­mittee formed in 1981. Since then it has augmented library holdings in the Middle Eastern area and ar­ranged a Fulbright Award which brought a visiting professor from the University of Damascus to the campus for a year.

The world is more than the evening news 
The 1984 presidential election has told us a lot about the role of the press in deciding public opinion. Reagan's tremendous lead has largely been the result of favorable press, while the name Mondale has become synonymous with "wimp." The tremendous illusion which had established itself during 
David Kroeger 
Wednesday's child 
the first few months of the campaign largely 
evaporated with the Louisville debate. The 
American people were at last able to see both 
candidates as who they were, and who they 
were not. 
Columnist james Reston has ruefully des­cribed the Reagan campaign crew as "the best public relations team ever to enter the White House." Reagan has held the fewest press con­ferences in ten years, and each public appear­ance ends with a planned quip and a quick run to a helicopter or airplane to avoid any embar­rassing questions. It is no wonder that pollster Lou Harris said,"Mondale cannot beat Reagan, only Reagan can beat Reagan." 
This situation should bring some disturbing questions to mind. Granted, we certainly need the press as a check against the evils, real or imagined, of society. Yet, just how far can we trust the press, when it is obvious that they are subject to bias as well? 
During the course of my short lifetime I have encountered a shockingly large number of people who believe everything that they read in the newspaper. This includes the stan­dard journals which one finds at the checkout counters in supermarkets. Each and every day they read the paper and are totally brain­washed by the information which they find within. They have no concept about which 
ones should be totally belie;ed and which 
ones can only be counted on in pan, ifat all 
Surprisingly, we are all of that group.  
Basically, we all rely upon the press for 
news and information, but it is necessary to 
realize that the mass media are capable of er­
rors and incomplete research in the same fas­
hion that we are. In many cases, we are seeing 
what someone has determined that we want

tant. We see clips that are wittingly or unwit­
tingly edited. We see a world through a ball 
point pen or a camera lens, a world in which 
there is no place fqr the dull and ordinary 
There is nothing wro.1g with this, but it is nec­
essary to realize that the true world is not all 
that we see on the evening news or our mor­
ning paper. In a civilization in which an aging 
president can appear as a deity, we can all be 
losers. 
The role ofthe press is vital for our society For those who deny that, recall the Watergate scandal. We are just beginning to recuperate from the implications of the Nixon adminis­tration. Think of how the world would have changed if the plan had been successful Nevertheless, it is apparent that the media has in many cases abused the first amendment in an attempt to make a profit. We can all name basically worthless publications, where the facts are sensationalized or even fabricated Yet, such incidents occur in our most respected publications as well. Recall the journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize for a story which was later found to be entirely fictitious. 
Do not be so foolish as to believe every: thing that you read. Do not be so foolish as to believe nothing that you read. Rather, take everything with a grain of salt, for we are all human: subject to human desires and human frailties. That is the real news.

Policy 


The Observer endorses Ronald Reagan 
Students at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's will have the opportunity to vote to­
morrow in not just a presidential election, but a referendum. By casting a vote for 
Ronald Reagan, one votes for a continuation of the policies of the past four years, 
namely a form of supply-side economics combined with more ambitious defense 
goals both at home and elsewhere. By voting for Walter Mondale, one votes for a 
more direct effort by the federal government to solve the nation's ills, combined 
with a shift in the focus ofdefense spending to conventional forces. 
The distinction is clear; however, the choice is not obvious. Both candidates' 
positions contain serious drawbacks, sufficient enough for one entrepreneur to 
market "Nobody for President in '84" bumper stickers. But a choice should be 
made for the candidate whose ideas and ability most matches that vision we as 
students share of the future. That candidate is President Reagan. 
The future did not appear bright four years ago. Humbled byinternational failure 
and domestic economic chaos, Americans resoundingly defeated a president who 
seemed to have few answers to the questions of the day. They elected a man who 
made many promises-some ofthem outlandish· but who would deliver on many of 
those promises by 1984. 
Four years ago, candidate Reagan promised to control the rate ofinflation, which 
in 1980 approached 13 percent. Inflation now stands at approximately five per­
cent. Real wages have increased consecutively since 1982. And the general busi­
ness climate seems to be one of innovation, productivity and growth, rather than 
retreat. More than 600,000 new businesses started operating in 1983. That innovat­
ive spirit should not be doused. 
Nor should the United States withdraw from international markets by imposing 
inordinate restrictions on trade. Protectionist import and export policies only 
serve to make prices higher for consumers, inflating wage rates and leading to 
non-progressive, technologically backwards industries. Reagan has taken a 
stronger stand against such protection, such as opposing domestic content legisla­
tion and favoring deregulation. 
On other domestic issues, Reagan has displayed courage by attempting to solve 
the financing problems of the Social Security program without jeopardizing the 
income of recipients. He favors merit pay and competency testing for teachers in 
public schools and tax credits for parents with children in private schools: both 
effons to improve the quality of education. Mondale opposes both measures. 
Reagan has taken a much stronger stand on the abortion issue, opposing federal 
funding ofabortions and supporting a Constitutional ban ofthe operation. Mondale 
does not consider the matter to be a governmental question. 
On international matters, the most crucial question of our time is nuclear 
proliferation and the threat to humanity which it implies. Reagan does not believe 
in meeting with the Soviets just for the sake of meeting. His plan calls for negotia­
tion and the production of an equitable, verifiable agreement which stabilizes or 
lowers nuclear forces. Though the failure to produce such a document during the 
last four years may lead some to question the president's sincerity, the president 
seems to understand the risk at hand. It seems that even Mondale, in spite of his 
desire to negotiate with the Soviets, has struggled with the problem ofverification, 
as evidenced in the second debate. An agreement must be reached, but the best 
interests of the ·country would be served by one negotiated by Reagan, not by 
Mondale. 
In Central America, Reagan has supported a strong military presence in the area 
to assist leaders such as Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador. Yet the attempt to subvert 
governments such as the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua is counter-productive. 
The United States has a responsibility to assist allies and to support human rights. 
Reagan understands this responsibility; he is correct in supporting Duarte. Yet it 
seems that some of the president's methods may not lead to the desired goal. 
There are other stands Reagan has taken that appear, at best, short-sighted. The environmental problems of acid rain and chemical waste cry out for immediate, expensive solutions in order to prevent catastrophe years from now. The presi­dent's programs Sf> far have been hesitant and underfunded. The same can be said about education and energy. Reducing grants to colleges and college students means that excellence will be obtained by fewer people in a time when such knowledge is needed by more and more. And the energy crisis has not gone away; it just has been hidden by the short-term glut. The world's supply of fossil fuels diminishes more each day, and the United States should not let day-to-day market conditions determine its energy policy. 
No one expects perfection in a candidate; one must accept a little bad with the good and then attempt to change the bad. Right now, President Reagan clearly offers more good than bad. He instills confidence and pride, and he has shown the ability to lead, not to languish in ineptitude. And finally, he has a qualified vice presidential candidate in George Bush, whose experience in international affairs is substantial. There are drawbacks. But for a majority of The Observer's editorial board, those drawbacks should not prevent the re-election of the president. By a five to three vote, with one abstention, this board endorses Ronald Reagan.

r 
i stand this concept. It will be a I major part ofthe upcoming exam."
r 
Your eyes dart to the clock-8:20! But it seems like you just got to class. Surely you couldn't have slept for 15 minutes! 
Perhaps your calculus class is so boring that you can't keep your eyes open. Try as you might, your head drops an inch each minute until your chin hits your chest and boom!-you're awake again. This process is repeated 3 or 4 times as you struggle to stay awake, until you finally give in and lean against the wall for a snooze. 
You're not alone. You realize this as you look around the room. More than likely you see someone drift­ing off to dreamland -or already there. Statistics show that two thirds ofall students fall asleep in class at least once a week. So, ifyou stay awake, chances are the people on your right and left are going to ask to borrow your notes. 
As you review your notes for the big test, you recognize the days on which you were sneaking some extra z's. All words consist of two letters and a long, squiggly tail. Proofs have a hypothesis and a conclusion, but the evidence is illegible. A calc problem with only three steps? That's when you hope the guy next to you was on No-Doz! 
As we all know, falling asleep in class can bring about a lot oftrou­ble. Stories were flying a few weeks ago about students sleeping in Dean Hofman's Chemistry lecture. Hof­man has a strict policy about this matter. He notes, "Not only is the student missing valuable informa­tion, someone else suffers a loss -the tuition payer." Most likely that means Mom and Dad, but it could also come from a scholarship, grant, or other contributor. Hofman usually handles a problem by having his teaching assistants note the sleeping student. Ifit happens more than once, he has a confer­ence with the student to see ifthere is an underlying problem. 
Professor Holly Martin, Assistant Professor of the Freshman Writing Program, says, " I don't find stu­dents falling asleep to be a big prob-· lem, because the classes I teach are small, discussion classes." She adds that she will usually have one stu­dent a week fall asleep. Unless it becomes a habit, she will usually

not confront the student. She does 
suggest, however, that ifyou are sleepy, to sit in the front ofthe 
class. It forces you to pay attention and you're less likely to fall asleep. 
Maybe you've tried everything to stay awake-a Pepsi before class, doodling, writing letters, even paying attention(!), but somehow those eyelids are just too heavy. Let's face it--8 o'clock is just too early to have a class, and come to think ofit, so is 9:05! By 10:10, you're thinking of all the game shows you're missing. Since you can't stop thinking about lunch during your 11:15, you decide a snappy nap will help shorten the wait. 
Although the dining hall didn't quite cooperate with your dream lunch, you arrive at your 1: 15 con­tent and ready for a few ZZZ's. At 2:20, you remember that you're missing General Hospital, so you console yourself by allowing a few minutes ofshuteye. Any class after 3:25 is definitely competing with some heavy duty afternoon slum­bering so you don't bother talking yourselfinto staying awake. Ifyou somehow have an evening class­forget it! Once the sun goes down, it's only natural instinct that puts you away. 
According to Dorm Magazine, there are a few things to try (besides the obvious tip ofgoing to bed before 4 a.m.) to make sleeping outside ofclass a more satisfying, sufficient restoration so that in class sleeping can be eliminated. 
Take naps when you need them. 

Don't overindulge in caffeinated beverages. 

Be moderate with alcohol. 

Find 
a comfortable room tem­perature for sleeping.

explored South Bend in . 
search ofsomething new and excit· 
ing? Although this doesn't sound 
like one of the most productive 
ways in which you could spend an 
afternoon, you may be surprised at 
what you find. 
Recently some friends and myself decided to take some time off from our weekly rituals and engage our­selves in a quest for novelty. Driving down South Bend Avenue, destination unknown, we spotted a portable billboard with a message requesting us to CREATE A MAS­TERPIECE! Enticed by such an invitation, we took a sharp turn into the parking lot of Chris' Ice Cream Parlor. 
Not knowing what to expect, we ventured into this establishment with our curiousity peaked. Once inside, we were greeted by a young man and woman who were more than willing to help us "Create our master-piece." Amateurs of this new form of art, we listened closely. 
First of all, Chris' is no ordinary ice cream parlor, perhaps this is due to its mix-in style. 'This mode ofice cream consumption allows one to choose a favorite flavor ofice cream and have candy or a favorite snack ground up and mixed in for an entire symphony ofgreat tastes. For example, if you you were suffering from an orco cookie ice cream attack yet you had to have M&M's and a Heath Bar or just die, Chris's offers the perfect medicine: a dose of the first delicacy topped with bits and pieces ofthe latter two. 
Although this may sound rather simple to do, as a customer at Chris's you'll find that choosing your medicine (or poison as the case may be) requires a crash course in basic decision making 
101. On the wall is a list of the twelve flavors that are being served on that day: Mint Oreo, Coffee Oreo, Peanut Puff, Malted Choco­late, Cup o'Cream, and Cherries­banana to mention a few. Stated to the left of this list are all of the possible ingredients which you can have mixed-in; such as, crushed Reeses, mixed nuts, crushed Heath, 
When we created our master­pieces, it took us several minutes of deliberation before each one ofus could decide. During this time, we learned that all of the ice cream is home-made by the owner himself, Chris ofcourse (the same man standing behind the counter). In addition, he informed us that his sundaes are made with home-made hot fudge or butterscotch topping and only fresh fruit. Ifthat's not enough, even the whipped cream and ice cream cones are home­made. 
Overwhelmed by the number of possibilities we finally made our selections and chose a table which allowed for maximum viewing capacity. Looking around we noticed the interesting artwork on the walls. With further inquisition, Chris gave us a briefhistory ofhow this place came to be. 
Having worked at a "mix-in" in Florida, Chris decided to return to his home state and open hi~ own place. Aided by his father Robert Miller and his wife Lyzerte, he was able to open the dQ.9rs to his first mix-in on October 6, 1984. Most of the preliminary work was accom· plished only with family coopera­tion. As for the art-work, Chris disclosed that it was the work of Notre Dame students. 
While listening to his story and enjoying the masterpiece which I had created, I became curious as to Chris's reason for selecting South Bend as home for his ice-cream· hound heaven He answered my curiousity by pointing out that mix-ins are quite popular around college campuses; and to this date his place is the first and only one of its kind near Saint Mary's and Notre Dame. 1\.s for choosing this area in the first place, he comments, "It's up and coming." 
Having obtained our fill ofice cream we thanked Chris for his help and information and pledged our support and loyalty to our newly found escape. 
As for our next quest, we still have many more masterpieces to create!

ell, seein' as how the pro basketball season has begun, I had wanted to do an entire basketball preview, but the editor says to me,"Look, son, maybe about three whole percent ofthe people on this here campus care about pro basketball, so you're gonna have to narrow your scope and make it interesting." "Well, then, can I do a conference preview, Mr. Editor?" "No. You're not even a sports writer. Narrow it down." "A division, maybe?" "Way down." "A little ol' team?" "You go\ it, scoop." Well, naturally my feathers were a trifle ruftled, because I make it ahabit to follow the NBA. Yeah, you heard me right, the National Basketball Association. The one where 23 teams play 82 games to pick 16 teams to go to the playoffs, the one that made a rule that tells teams how much they can pay a whole team, and the one that no one except me ever watches on 1V. That NBA. Because it's all I got. 
So now I have to talk about one team, and since·Mr. Editor has put me into a very wicked mood, I do not feel like talkin' about my very favorite team, the Phoenix Suns. Instead, I feel like rippin' something to shreds. 
And so, since I do not have a five-by-seven gloSsy photo ofMr. Reagan handy at this particular moment, I will focus my wrath on the sorriest team in the NBA, the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
Now havin' lived out in the middle ofnowhere all my life, and havin' never been to the city ofCleveland, well, maybe I ain't really qualified to say anythin', but when I hear the word 'Cleveland,' I start laughin' so hard my insides are about ready to fall out. 
Think about it, sports &.ns. Football? They got the Browns. One-and-eight, last time I looked. Ifthey won this weekend it was because they were playin' BuJfalo, who was 0-9. Baseball? They got the Indians. I don't rightly recall their final record last season, but I do know they were next to last in their division. And what kind of basketball team do you figure would be in Cleveland? Well, here's whatSportslllustrated, which my cousin Leroy reads to me every week., said about Cleveland's last season: 
You take 302 more shots than your opponent. You make 11 fewer. You are the Cleveland Cavaliers. Sorta makes sense, don't it? Now here's a basketball team who's 
got two guys that are 29, one guy who's gonna be 31 in December, and another who's 32, but whose 33-year-old coach says they're buildin' for the future. Here's a team that, last time I looked, has rebuilt to a record so far of0-4, losin' their last one atbome to, ofall teams, theIndiana Pacers. And here's a team who tried out 23 different players on its 12-man roster in 1981. 
Yeah, we're talkin' sorry. Last place. Doormat. Basement. Patsy. The list goes on. 
But don't y'all get the impression that the Cavaliers have always been losers. Why, as recent as '77 or '78 they even made the playoffs. But then somethin' happened. Don't ask me what, but strange things followed. 
And Cleveland started gettin' scary. 
How scary? Well, jest imagine that you are an NBA star playin' for some team out West in the early 80s, and suddenly you start havin' an off-season. Hey, your coaches and general managers say to you, you'd better start producin', or somethin' unfortunate might happen to you. In fact, we might even get nasty and trade you to 
Cleveland. 

And when you get traded to or are picked up by Cleveland, it's about the end ofthe road for you, Buster. Your career is over. You are a lamb who has been led to the slaughter. And the only way out is to get traded again, because once Cleveland puts you out on waivers, there ain't nobody in this land ofours who is gonna pick you up again 
Remember some great names that just sort ofvanished? Do you find yourselfaskin', "Hey, whatever happened to so-and-so? He just kind of... vanished." Nope, he's alive, and playin' for Cleveland. Lonnie Shelton. World Free. johnny Davis. Campy Russell. It's painful to con~ider. I have a mind to send them donations. 
With its brightest spot, second-year forward Roy Hinson, injured, Cleveland now has the capability ofstarting the world's heaviest front-line: 270-pound Lonnie Shelton, 319-pound Geff Crompton, and 270-pound Mel Turpin, a big ol' fat rookie out of Kentucky. 
-And Cleveland surprised no one by goin' way out ofits way to get Turpin. from Kentucky. Yeah, you remember Kentucky. joe B. Hall? The coach who gets the very least out ofhis players that he possibly can? So they call up that ol' center Mel when the NCAA season is just over, and they say, Mel, how would you like to try out for the Olympic team? Nope, says Mel, I'm outta shape. Might get hurt, you know. But Mel! they say. The college season just ended! You just finished playin' in the tournament! What -what -what happened, Mel? Why are you so doggone fat? But that didn't stop the Cavs. They traded away their top scorer just to get Turpin. The list goes on. Well, as you may have reckoned by now, I am not pickin' the Cavs to finish anywhere near first in their division, which happens to be the Central Division, which the Detroit Pistons are gonna run away with ifI may say so, Mr. Editor, followed by Chicago, Milwaukee, Atlanta, and Indiana. That leaves Cleveland for the cellar. As usual. It's tradition, like the harvest moon.

Budget Deficits 
Walter Mondale has a plan to reduce the staggering budget deficits which threaten to cripple our economy. This year's deficit of 263 billion dollars is by far the highest in U.S. history. Deficits add to our already enormous national debt, hun businesses and foreign trade, and cause interest rates to remain high. They must be dealt with, and Mondale will work immediately to restore fiscal responsi­bility to our federal government. He will reduce the deficit by; saving 25 billion dollars in defense spending, implementing measures to contain medicare and farm support costs, and restoring revenues by introducing a fair tax program. 
Walter Mondale feels that a balanced budget is an admirable goal which should be strived for, however, experience has shown him that it is nearly impossible for either party to balance the budget. For this and other reasons, he does not support the Balanced Budget Amendment. 
Taxes 
Walter Mondale will raise taxes, and so will Ronald Reagan. The fact is that revenues must be raised, and Mondale is simply being straight-forward and honest by presenting his tax plan prior to the election. 
Some important points of the Mondale­Ferraro tax plan include: partially deferring in­dexation, capping the third year ofthe tax cut for incomes above S60,000, imposing a 10 percent tax surcharge on incomes above sI00,000, enacting a 15 percent corporate minimum tax, and shutting down loopholes and accounting abuse. 
The Mondale tax plan will raise much needed revenue and thus reduce the deficit. It is a fair tax plan which has been put before the public for all to see. 
Tuidon Tax Credits, Student Aid 
Education is vital to our country's strength, and it is one area of national policy on which our future is built. Walter Mondale will work to restore the Reagan cuts in education, while continuingtopromote policies which address the futures ofour students and teachers. 
Walter Mondale is against tuition tax credits, as are most educators, for he feels that 
Below are ltsted the political positions of Walter Mondale on some ofthe major issues in the 1984 Presidential Election. These reponses have been compiled by the NDI$MCStudentsfor Mondale/ferraro. 
their implementation would hurt our public school system. Tuition tax credits encourage families who can afford it to send their kids to private rather than public school. Public schools are the backbone of American educa­tion, and they must be protected and strengthened. Tuition tax credits achieve nei­ther of these goals. 
With regard to student aid, the difference between the present administration and the Mondale-Ferraro outlook is clear. Mondale will work ·hard to ensure that all American families can afford to send their children to college by increasing the level ofPell grants to low and moderate income students, expand­ing the Guaranteed Student Loan program, and increasing campus based work study pro­grams. 
Middle East 
Walter Mondale has had Middle East foreign policy experience like no other candidate has. As vice president, he was instrumental in the tedious negotiation process which resulted in the Camp David Peace Accords. It is in that spirit that Mondale will approach the middle east and its problems. 
Mondale will work for stability, yet he will do so through a coherent policy of dialogue rather than one of weapons spending and troop deployments. In Lebanon, Mondale would not have placed troops in a vulnerable position with no clear mission. As president, he will insure that the United States maintains its strong friendship with Israel. In the spirit of Camp David, Mondale will seek to renew the progress towards lasting peace in the middle east. 
Latin America 
Walter Mondale will insure that America maintains its moral authority in the vital Latin­American region. He will do so not by initiat­ing illegal mining ofNicaraguan harbors or by distributing a CIA manual which encourages terrorism, but instead will seek negotiation between the leaders and rebels of this war­torn region. 
Mondale feels that we should encourage and support democracies, and thus favors eco­nomic incentives and aid. He supports jose Napoleon Duarte, and he would seek active participation with the friendly Contadora group. Mondale, does not however, support our aid to the contra efforts in Nicaragua. He

On the Left ................................................ . 
views them as self-defeating, and would stress negotiated agreement for non-intervention by outside powers. His policy proposals in Latin America are intelligent and workable. Most importantly, they represent foreign policy ideas which do not compromise our moral au­thority. 
Women's Rights 
Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro will seek a guarantee that women fully participate in our society and our government, by leading the fight to pass the Equal Rights Amendment and appointing women to positions ofrespon­sibility at every level ofgovernment. 
Mondale was an original co-sponsor of the Equal Rights Amendment and remains un­wavering in his support for it. He realizes that like Civil Rights legislation, the ERA, with the power and prestige of law, will act as both a symbolic and practical measure which seeks to insure equality and fairness in our society. Women should no longer have to settle for 59 cents for every dollar a man makes, and in the spirit of equal rights, Walter Mondale favors a bill which would guarantee women the same pay as men ifthey perform work of compara­ble value. 
Abortion 
Perhaps no other issue raises emotion and rhetoric as much as the abortion question. Walter Mondale believes that abortion is a deeply serious occurrence, yet must remain the personal choice of individual women. Walter Mondale does not believe that govern­ment and society today possess the insight, cohesion and agreement necessary to decide which if any anti-abortion laws should be passed. Walter Mondale does respect life, and is certainly no "baby killer". Such language and insinuation only stifles serious debate on this important issue, and is unfair to both the pro-choice and anti-abortion position. 
Environment 
Walter Mondale once said that he believes 
"that each generation of Americans has the 
profound obligation to hand over to the next 
generation a country at least as rich, as clean, 
and as beautiful as it was when we received it 
from our parents." It is this vital obligation 
which is being ignored today. Less than I per­

Mondale deserves your vote 
By Mike Brogioli 
The most disturbing thing about this year's election is the fact that so few of us sup­posedly intelligent, reflective students are taking the time to seriously look at all the is­sues, records and real leadership qualities which the candidates do or do not possess. Last week's Mock Election underscores my point: huge majorities voted for some type of nuclear weapons freeze and restrictions on acid rain, yet 61 percent said they support Ronald Reagan, although he favors neither. lbis indicates that major, critical issues are not having the impact they deserve upon our voting decisions. 
Certainly, we want a strong leader in whom we can trust. Intelligence, courage, wisdom, compassion and vision are the marks of a true leader, and under these guidelines, Walter Mondale scores far ahead of Ronald Reagan. Yet our generation, although acknowledging its sharp dlsagreement with Reagan on such profound issues as civil rights, foreign policy and arms control, continues to support the president by a wide margin. In a nutshell, I would argue that in 1984 image and percep­tion are winning out over fact and reality. To ignore the many great issues of our time and simply vote for Reagan because he seems more "presidential" is simplistic and irrespon­sible. I urge all of you to thinklong and hard ­to examine your consciences -prior to making your decisions tomorrow. 
I do realize that some students are not 
simply swept by Ronald Reagan's aura and im­
pressive imagery. Many of these students will 
choose Mondale-Ferraro, while others will 
continue to support the president. It is this 
latter segment whose attitudes are most dis­
heartening. While some claim (with varying degrees ofsincerity and rationality) that they must support Reagan because of his anti­abortion stand, I strongly suspect that the bot­tom line to their voting decision comes down to "pocket book" economics. The "I'm better off so therefore I'll vote for Reagan" attitude may seem sensible at first, but upon reflection, it boils down to a vaguely covered greed and selfishness in the American electorate. 
We should vote on the basis of who will do better for all Americans, particularly the most disadvantaged members of our society. We should never be completely satisfied with the way things are. It seems easy for us, li.ving upper-middle class and upper class lives to proclaim how wonderful Ronald Reagan and his policies are. However, it is not so easy for the unemployed steelworker, the frightened elderly woman or the discouraged minority student to make such a proclamation. 
In the United States, such people do exist, and not in small numbers. The sad, harsh reality of 1984 tells us that 7. 5 million remained unemployed, and 15.2 percent of our population is under the poverty line. Sad reality presents a nuclear arms race which rages on and now threatens to be taken into space. Sad reality shows a president who favors tax credits to segregated universities and tries to repeal the Voting Rights Act. Sad reality is a president who has failed to master the vital components of foreign policy and arms control. Many refuse to acknowledge these and other realities of the Reagan presidency. Others acknowledge them yet shrug their shoulders. It is this group which clearly has failed to examine their con­sciences, which has a misguided and self­interested view ofgovernment. 
Surely, we should encourage: and applaud efforts which lead to equal opportunity and justice, yet some in society and at Notre Dame simply choose to ignore the shameful Reagan record on social, economic, environmental, and war and peace issues. Apparently to them tax breaks and temporary relieffrom inflation are more important than civil rights and sin­cere arms control efforts. 
We learn about the importance of family and community values here at Notre Dame. We learn that we are called to help one an­other · to take care of those who can't make it on their own. It is called compassion, and it is a quality we should not be afraid to display in our national policies. Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro have shown compassion · in themselves and in their policies, and their administration will seek to form a society which can honestly describe its government with that word. 
Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro combine the traits necessary to lead this na­tion towards the goals of equal opportunity, prosperity, peace and justice. Mondale has remained faithful to the causes he know:,; are right, yet has been able to make the necessary modifications in specific fields which time and technology dictate. Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro possess the best leadership qualities -intelligence, honesty and wisdom. They are prepared and willing to take on the problems facing our country, and most impor­tantly they realize that problems and injus­tices do exist, and must be solved. Mondale and Ferraro have made this vital realization, and now I call upon each ofyou to do the same by giving them your vote on November 6.

been cleaned up, and slashes in funding have cut that agency's research in half. Mondale will restore the budgets of environmental agencies. He will enforce the laws we've enacted to protect ourselves, our air, our water and our land. He will treat acid rain as a serious national problem that demands a na­tional solution, and he will put true profes­sionals back in charge of environmental protection. 
Arms Control 

Walter Mondale truly believes in arms con­trol. As president, he wants to meet with the Soviet leadership personally on an annual basis. Although he realizes that the Soviets are tough to negotiate with, Walter Mondale wants to continue a tradition of producing arms control agreements started by Eisenhower--a tradition carried on by every president since, except for Ronald Reagan. Walter Mondale would propose a mutually verifiable plan to stop the testing, production and deployment of nuclear arms. He would not initiate an arms race in the heavens as the Star Wars system proposed by Reagan will do. Finally, Mondale would work towards there­duction of nuclear arms with the Soviets on a mutually verifiable basis. We live in a world of 50,000 nuclear warheads. We build 3 more each day, with no end in sight. The madness must stop, and Walter Mondale will seek an end to the arms race nightmare. 
National Defense 

Walter Mondale believes in a strong na­tional defense. His proposed budget plan in­cludes a 3 percent increase in defense spending. However, he wants to shift spend­ing away from unnecessary and dangerous nu­clear weapons systems towards conventional forces, where we lag considerably behind our principle adversary. Until he can negotiate reductions with the Russians, Walter Mondale appreciates the need for survivable nuclear forces such as the Stealth bomber and the Midgetman ICBM. He would cancel the vul­nerable MX missile and the already obsolete B-1 bomber S\lpported by President Reagan. As president, Walter Mondale would assume a role ofleadership by making sure that the na­tion gets the seturity that it pays for. Mondale wants to build strong, rational defense which enhances rather than reduces United States security, world stability, and peace.

tial Election Decision 
' ................................................. On the Right 
Budget Deficits 
The President feels that the deficits he in­herited are slowing our recovery. Although some claim that the deficits will stop the eco­nomic recovery, studies have shown that raising taxes would widen the deficit by crip­pling growth. Reagan is lowering deficits to continue economic growth with a three year down-payment proposal to cut defense and non-defense spending by S50 billion each, and by cutting out tax loopholes. The Deficit Down-Payment, increased growth, and making government more economically effi­cient will eliminate the deficit problem. Sup­ports balanced budget amendment. 
Taxes 
The Reagan Administration has already cut taxes to stimulate the recovery and seeks to assure that taxes do not overwhelm the people. Thus, Reagan supports measures such as tax indexing to make sure inflation does not push workers into higher tax brackets, (for every Ipercent rise in inflation, taxes go up I.7 percent.); elimination ofinheritance taxes un­der a certain amount to protect farms and small business; by increasing child-care credits and easing the marriage penalty tax. 
Tuidon Tax Credits, Student Aid 
During the past 3 years, the President has raised educational spending to its highest levels, (up 9 percent per pupil in 1983) and plans to increase gro\\--th to state and local educational agencies by 50 percent next year. Reagan has increased Pell Grants for needy college students. Student loan expenditures increased $600 million in 1984 and Reagan plans to extend $300 million to the GSL capi­tal fund in February of 1985. The Administra­tion is leading the fight to establish tuition tax creditrs for families with incomes under $40,000 so that the burden of sending children to the school of their choice will be reduced. This will effect over 60 percent of 
the families  who send children  to  private  
schools.  
Middle East  

The peace, security and well-being of the nations of the Middle East are critical to a broad range of American interests. These in­terests include: checking the spread ofSoviet influence in this strategic region; assuring the 
security and welfare oflsrael and other impor­tant friendly nations _in the region; preserving and fostering our critical interest in access to the region's oil. In Lebanon, the Regan Admin­istration's goals are: the restoration ofa sover­eign, independent and united Lebanon; the withdrawal ofall foreign forces; and the secur­ity of Israel's northern border. In Iran/Iraq, the United States is committed to: strict neutrality in the Iran-Iraq War; freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf sea lanes, a mat­ter of vital importance to the international 
community; avoiding direct United States mil­itary involvement in the ·war; diplomatic ef­forts of the Gulf States and' other parties such as the United Nations in seeking a peaceful resolution to the conflict; security of these Gulf States -by providing military equipment to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, we have begun to achieve this. 
Latin America 
President Reagan has outlined four basic goals to prevent a Communist victory in Central America by fighting poverty and dic­tatorship there. The U.S. seeks to: Bolster dem­ocratic systems where they already exist and help countries in the process to reach demo­cratic goals quickly. The administration will continue to work at human rights problems and requires that elections in the region must be fair, safe and open to all. Support economic development (seventy-seven cents of every dollar we spend in the area currently goes to essentials for economic growth). Continua­tion ofthe Caribbean Basin Initiative. Support the security of the region's threatened countries. Security assistance is a shield for democratization, economic development and diplomacy. Support dialogue and negotiations among the countries of the region and within each country and work towards political solu­tions in Central America that we'll serve the interests of the democratic process (including the Contadora Process). 
Women's Rights 
President Reagan is the first Ptesident in history to appoint a female judge to the United States Supreme Court and he is the first presi­dent to have three women on his cabinet at the same time. The President's goals for wo­men are based upon a stress on legal and eco­nomic equity for women. He has reduced the marriage penalty tax, virtually eliminated the "widow's tax", doubled the child care tax

credit for working mothers and proposes the "Pension Equity Act" to reduce pension practices which have proven unfair to wo­men. Equal Pay for equal work is the law ofthe land and President Reagan vigorously sup­ports this (through the U.S. Equal Employ­ment Opportunity Commission). 
Abortion 
President Reagan believes abortion is the taking ofhuman life and that the unborn child deserves the constitutional right to life. The President believes that even ifit is impossible to judge exactly "when life begins" and doubt exists, we still should opt on the side of life (ghre the child the benefit of the doubt). The president opposes federal funding for abor­tions except in those cases where the mother's life is in danger. He supported a Con­stitutional Amendment on the Senate Floor which would have overruled the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade abortion decision. The President supports funding agencies which encourage adoption of unwanted children. The administration is strongly against allow­ing disabled children (Baby jane Doe cases) to die from lack of medical treatment. By Presidential Proclamation, the President reminded all doctors that the process is im­moral and unethical (as well as illegal). 
Environment 
The President has started a wide reaching revitalizaiton and expansion of the E.P.A. More specifically he supports: a 56 percent in­crease in spending for the "Superfund" pro­gram for the cleanup of hazardous wastes. A priorities list of 546 sites has already' been published and action has begun on alleviating problems in the order ofpriority; a 27 percent increase in enforcement programs. The presi­dent feels you must strictly enforce all of the current regulations for them to be effective; a 124 percent increase in Acid Rain Research and procurement of remedies; an increase of S7.3 million for development ofcost-effective regulations to expand and strengthen existing toxic waste enforcement programs. In 1983, the President, through the Department of In­terior has added more park and wildlife land to the federal estate than any other adminis­tration has in a single year since the purchase of Alaska. The President is working toward dean air, clean water and the restoration of our national parks. 
Arms Control 
The Reagan Administration has proposed that the United States move from a doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) to a posture of Mutual Assured Survival (MAS). MAS is a theory that holds that the most funda­mental duty ofthe government is to to protect the people from attack and that this can be best accomplished by physically defending them against nuclear attack. Emphasis is 
placed on saving Americans rather than killing Soviets. The President does not support a nu­clear freeze because it is simplistic, un­verifiable and a utopian approach to arms control that has no chance of being success­fully negotiated with the Russians. The Presi­dent began the START and INF Negotiations and is ready to resume them whenever the Soviets return to the tables in good faith. U.S. News and World Report states "Negotiations to reduce nuclear-arms levels not just freeze or limit their expansion will be resumed whenever the Soviets wish.") NATO re­quested in 1979 that the United States deploy 108 Pershing II missiles and 464 ground launched cruise missiles in Europe. Deploy­ment began in late1984. As ofMay 1984, NATO has deployed 9 Pershing II missiles in Europe~ By contrast, the Soviet Union has more more than 600 intermediate-range nuclear missiles, of which 378 are SS-20's. The Pershing II's and the ground-launched cruise missiles will al­low NATO to respond in-kind to an attack by Soviet iqtermediate-range missiles. 
Nadonal Defense 
The Administration has asked for 30 per­cent of the 1985 budget for defense spending, 15 percent less than 1960, while 42 percent of the budget goes for direct payments to indi­viduals, (Social Security, welfare programs, etc.) Reagan wishes to keep the defense budget at 7 percent of our GNP while the USSR spends about 20 percent of its GNP on defense. Of the defense budget, about half goes to manpower costs while only 14 percent is for strategic weapons. Our defense spend­ing will keep up with the slow rise in inflation and increasing GNP over the next term. Reagan also favors forcing the Pentagon, along with all other agencies, to implement the effi­cient business practices recommended by the Grace Commission to cut waste and increase efficiency.

Irish freshmen stepped smoothly into collegiate hockey as four of the team's six rookies scored their first career goals in the series. Center Mike McNeill tallied a goal and an as­sist on Friday. Then on Saturday, defensemen Frank O'Brien and Pat Foley along with center Tom Mooney made the scoring sheet for the first time. 
"All of the freshmen played fan­tastically," said Chapman. "Without them we can't win. They stepped right in and played like upperdas­smen." 
Both Notre Dame goaltenders turned in sound performances. Sophomore Tim Lukenda made 30 saves on Friday and senior A1 Haverkamp turned away 35 Penn State shots in Saturday's victory. 
The Irish got off to slow starts both nights, but once they got going, they never looked back. 
The Lions struck first on Friday, but by the end of the season's opening period, Notre Dame held a 2-1 lead. Lynn Sipe got Penn State on the board at the nine-minute mark, but SO seconds later Chapman banged home his first goal to tie the score at 1-1 with a blistering drive from the right side. Thebeau then gave the Irish their 2-1 lead with just

two seconds remaining in the period as his shot from the right point deflected off Penn State defender Jeff Speece and past goale Gerri Hourihan. 
Four goals in the second stanza in­creased the Notre Dame lead to 6-2. Chapman, Tim Reilly, Jeff Badalich and Greg Duncan accounted for the scores: Sipe's second goal of the game was the lone Penn State tally of the period. 
The Irish lead increased to five goals when McNeill tapped home his first goal after finding himself and the puck alone in the crease behind Hourihan. Chapman completed his hat trick at the 8:56 mark as he made some nice moves to elude a Penn State defender and bank the puck off ofa surprised Hourihan's skate. 
just as in Friday''~ game, Penn State jumped out to a quick 1-0 lead on Saturday on a goal by Nick Pappas just 1:18 into the game. O'Brien's slapshot from the left wing pulled the Irish even at 8:35. But by the end of the period, Penn State went on top 2-1 when Pat McQuillan slid the puck past Haverkamp from a crowd in front of the net. 
Jim Yoblecki put the Lions on top 3-1 within the first two minutes of the second period with his wrist shot from inside the left face-off circle, and it looked as though Penn State had found the momentum it needed to avenge the previous night's defeat. 
The Irish, however, weren't happy with the turn of events and promptly decided to make things miserable for their guests. Tallies by McNeill, Reilly and Steve Ely gave Notre Dame a 4-3 lead at the end of the second period. 
"lbe crowd had a lot to do with our performance," said Reilly. "We had been waiting to play for a while. And after the slow start, they really helped to get us going." 
In the third period Notre Dame showed no mercy as it capitalized six more times to bring the score to its final margin. Mooney started the Irish barrage just 25 seconds into the period. Thebeau then fired home three straight goals for his hat trick. Foley's wrist shot from the top of the left circle and an Ely breakaway goal rounded out the scoring for the victorious Irish. 
The rough and tumble play utilized by both teams accounted for its share of casualties. Badalich suf­fered a chest injury on Friday and did not play Saturday. Rob Ricci was also absent from the Irish lineup with a thigh contusion. Tom Parent left Saturday's game and was later diagnosed to have a separated shoulder. Four Penn State players did not dress Saturday including Sipe, the Lions' leading scorer. 
Notre Dame's next action is Friday and Saturday when the Irish travel to the University of Michigan­Dearborn.

Chicago punishes Raiders 
CHICAGO-Walter Payton rushed for 111 yards and two touchdowns yesterday and the Chicago Bears, in­timidating the intimidators, defeated the Los Angeles Raiders, 1 7-6, in a bruising National Football League contest. 
The Bears registered nine sacks 
for losses of 58 yards and sidelined 
quarterbacks Marc Wilson and 
David Humm at various times while 
Bear quarterback jim McMahon did 
not come back in the second half be­
cause ofa back injury. 
Payton, rushing for 100 yards for 
an 18-yard run in the first quarter 
and on an 8-yard dash in the second 
quarter to stake the Bears to a 14-0 
lead. 
The Super Bowl champions, 
hounded by the Bear defense, never 
recovered and had to settle for a pair 
of field goals. 
Chris Bahr booted a 44-yard field 
goal on Los Angeles' last possession 
in the first halfand connected with a 
40-yarder on its first possession in 
the second h.tlf. 
Midway in the first quarter the 
Bears drov '6 yards for a touch­
down with cMahon hitting Willie 
Gault with 0-yard pass to the Los 
Angeles 2<, rd line. Payton gained 
eight and tl went 18 for the score. 
The Be then recovered a 
Humm fun and couldn't cash in. 
But on the ' Los Angeles posses­
sion, Leslie azier intercepted a 
Wilson pass i returned 33 yard~ 
to the Raide l 1. Two plays later 
Payton went 10nd left end for th( 
score. 1 
Late in tht .ourth quarter, th 
Raiders marched from their own sb 
yard line to the Chicago 16 wit: 
Marcus Allen biting Todd Christen 
sen with a 38-yard pass. But Richaw 
Dent's third offour sacks ofthe gamL 
caused Wilson to fumble and Dent

Takes second at NAIA Tournament 
SMC volleyball finishes season 
By KELLY PORTOLESE 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's volleyball team completed its 1984 campaign with a sparkling 18-7 record after an im­pressive showing at this weekend's NAIA District 21 tournament. 
The Belles advanced to the cham­pionship game by downing Marion College, 2-1 5, 1 S-7, 16-14, 4-1 S, 15­11, and Goshen College, 3-1 5, 15­11, 1 5·8, 1 5-13, before bowing to Franklin College, the eighth-ranked team in the nation in NAIA, 1 S-8, 1 5­7, 1S-1. 
Second-year coach Brian Goralski was very pleased with his team's per­formance. 
"We accomplished a lot this weekend," he said. "Franklin was a really good team and we should be at their level next year." 
Franklin featured two players over six-feet tall and, because of its height advantage, frequently was able to place corner shots over the blocks of the Saint Mary's defenders. In addition, Franklin ran a S-1 of­fense with a very good setter execut­ing the plays. As a result, its offense had many different options -more options than the Belles had been exposed to this year. 
In the first game ofthe title match, the Belles built up an 8-4 lead. But the momentum changed hands and Franklin rallied for 11 unanswered points and a 1 5-8 triumph.

Franklin's quick sets to the outside often allowed only one Saint Mary's blocker to attempt a block and, thus, limited the Belles' defen­sive efforts at the net in the second game. The Belles stayed with the host team most ofthe way, however, but could not hang on and fell, 15-7. 
The long match with Goshen in the morning's semi-final round, along with a three-hour layover, seemed to take its toll on the Belles in the third game as they dropped a 15-1 decision to give Franklin the championship. 
In Friday night's op«ning-round action, Saint Mary's met up with the Lady Titans of Marion which had defeated the Belles in a thrilling five­game match less than a week ago. Marion, which runs a stacked of­fense, is always full of surprises on the court, but, in this rematch, it featured two starters who were not present last Monday night. The Belles, however, were not in­timidated. 
"We were ready for everything they threw at us," said Goralski. "The whole team played well and everybody did their job. The setters did a good job and we were well­prepared. We played awesome." 
At 11 :00 a.m. on Saturday, the Belles were ready for another grudge match -this time against Gos­hen which had handed the Belles a mid-season loss. 
Initially the Belles came out a little cold and eventually dropped the first game, 1 5-3. But they quickly turned things around and began put­ting everything together, taking the next three games for the victory. 
Senior Ann Boutton, who was 
named to the all-district honorable­
mention team, led the offensive at­
tack along with sophomore Mary 
Reidy and freshman Mary Carole 
Feldman. The Belles' serving also 
proved to be very effective as Gos­
hen's backcourt was unable to get 
off many good passes. 

For senior co-captains Molly Baker and Boutton, the tournament marked their last performances in Saint Mary's uniforms. Goralski noted that their leadership and playing abilities will be missed by next year's squad. 
Because they are the only seniors on this year's squad, though, Goralski has much to look forward to next season. 
"I think everyone (at the tourna­ment) was astonished as to how well we did. I was really happy," said the coach. 
With this year's talent, youth and enthusiasm, along with a couple of promising prospects in line for next season, Goralski has every reason to be excited about the future of Saint Mary's volleyball.

overtime victory. 
In the other game, Howard ousted Zahm from the playoffs by a score of 7-0. The game's only points came in the third quarter on a one-yard plunge by tailback Don Antrobus. 
This game was the tale of two halves as Zahm almost put the game away in the first half yet failed to score a point. On its first possession ofthe second quarter, Zahm running back Steve Dombrowski cut back behind Howard's pursuit and raced 60 yards to the end zone. Unfortun­ately for Zahm, the fine run was called back for a blocking-below­the-waist penalty. Howard defensive back Tim Kottak intercepted an en­suing Zahm pass to end the threat. 
After the teams exchanged punts,

Howard lined up at the its own 47­yard line. On the first play, Zahm cornerback Tom Hynes ripped the ball out of the hands of the Howard 
receiver  and  took  off down  the  
sideline.  A  Zahm  touchdown  
seemed  inevitable  when,  at  the  

three-yard line, a hustling Howard player dove at Hynes and knocked the ball out of his hands. The ball flew out of bounds in the end zone for a touchback, giving Howard the ball on the 20. Despite much action, Zahm had no points to show for its efforts. 
Early in the second half, Kottak recovered a Zahm fumble onZahm's 
45. Antrobus ranfor 15 yards and Pat Clark carried the ball seven more yards to the 23-yard line. After gaining only two yards in the next two plays, Howard attempted a 3 7­yard field goal, but it was wide right and the game remained scoreless. 
Three plays later Howard threatened again when Clark inter­cepted a wobbly Zahm pass and returned it all the way to the Zahm 15-yard line. Howard quarterback Matt Kelty picked up 12 yards on a bootleg to set up Antrobus' touch­down. 
Zahm, which had been shut down by the Howard defense in the second half, finally showed signs of life. In the fourth quarter, Zahm quarterback Mark Palas.ld hooked up twice with end Tim Golonka, first for 20 yards, then for 30 more, to give Zahm a first down at the Howard 25-yard line. A face-mask penalty on Howard gave Zahm an­other first down at the 15. 
On the next play, Palaski rolled right andspotted an open receiver at the five-yard line. However, Clark was the hero again a5 he reached in front of the receiver for his second interception and returned the ball all the way to the Zahm 36 to sew up the victory. 

Next Sunday, Howard will try to become the first team to score on top-seeded Sorin, let alone beat them. Sorin defeated Howard, 8-0, on the last week of the regular season to clinch the Rockne divi­sion. 
In the other game, Morrissey tries to avoid a letdown following its big win over Dillon as it squares off against No. 2-seeded Stanford.

ran into him on the follow through. With Colby laying on the ground in pain, Tranquill was screaming for a penalty but no flag was thrown. Had the penalty been called, Navy would have had the ball back with an auto­matic first down and the Irish unable to stop the clock. With exactly a minute left, the Midshipmen could have simply run out the clock. 
"I kicked it and I was looking up at the ball when all of a sudden I was hit," said Colby, who suffered a badly sprained ankle on the play and had to be carried off the field by his teammates. 
Referee Bill McDonald explained the call to Tranquill on the sidelines, but the Navy coach continued to protest. 
After the game, the officials allowed a pool reporter to interview McDonald, something that is rarely done in college football. 
"He (Tranquill) wanted an expla­nation and I told him it was a judge­ment call," said McDonald in a release issued to the media. "The punter ~as back on the ground when he was hit. It was a freak play. A kicker is no longer a kicker when his foot has returned to the ground. He was back on the ground when he was hit." 
Although television replays seemed to confirm McDonald's view of the play, Tranquill would not ac­cept the referee's explanation. 
"If his foot has just touched the ground after the punt, it's still rough­
ing the kicker," argued the Navy coach. 
The Irish, meanwhile, started their final possession in a less-than­impressive manner, as Howard's punt return to the Notre Dame 33 was negated by an Irish personal foul which moved them back to the 18. With one minute left, the Irish needed a field goal to win and were out of timeouts. 
But Beuerlein still had the hot hand, completing three straight passes, including a 29-yard screen pass to Pinkett to set up the winning field goal. On the play, Pinkett took the pass in the left flat, was sprung by dashed up the sideline as tackle Mike Perrino slammed Navy's Fudge, who was the last defender to have a shot at the tailback near the line of scrimmage. 
The pass-and-run play gave Notre Dame a first down at the Navy 26, and Beuerlein threw his next pass out of bounds to stop the clock. With 18 seconds remaining, the Irish were not about to take any chances, as Head Coach Gerry Faust brought in Carney to kick the game-winner. 
"I was really expecting to have to kick a longer one," said Carney. "Everything happened so quick -I didn't have much time to think

about it. I knew (holder) Mike (Viracola) would be calling the count quick. As soon as I got out there, they snapped it and I kicked it. I kicked it almost on instinct." 
Faust had plenty of confidence in Carney, because of the consistency which the sophomore placekicker had displayed all season long. 
"As soon as Carney hit the field goal, I knew it was solid," said Faust. "You could hear it. There was no question on the distance, he really got into it. And he's been pretty ac· curate this year for us." 
Carney's field goal was a second 
source of controversy between 
Tranquill and the officials. The Navy 
coach claimed that the 25-second 
clock had expired before the ball clock had expired. To most obser­vers, however, the snap appeared to have occured after the clock showed zero. 

"The field judge is responsible for the 25-second clock," said McDonald. "His back was to the dock -he was watching the clock at the one end ofthe field. He lost sight for a few seconds because the defense was jumping up and down. In his opinion, the clock did not exceed 25 seconds." 
It was a tough defeat for Tranquill, . even more so because of the injury situation. In addition to Byrne and Colby, the Midshipmen lost senior tight end Mark Stevens, one of their captains, to a kneecap injury. They had come into the game with two of their top players -tailback Napolean McCallum and defensive back Eric Wallace -already sidelined. 
Notre Dame also lost some key performers to injuries. Tight endo; Mark Bavaro and Joel Willaims, guard Larry Williams, and linebacker Mike Larkin all were hampered by injuries suffered during the course of the game. 
But the Irish managed to overcome the injuries, as well as their own mistakes, to raise thier record to S-4. 
"It would have been a terrible loss. That's obvious," said Beuerlein. "It would have brought a very tough situation on us. Fortunately, we saved ourselves." 
At least for the time being. 

was snapped. If a delay of game penalty had been called, Carney would have had to attempt a 49· yarder. Earlier in the game, the soph· omore had missed a 50-yarder.
