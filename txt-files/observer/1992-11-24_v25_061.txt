BOG talks on campus diversity 
By NICOLE MCGRATH Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
The Saint Mary's Board of Governance (BOG) discussed bringing a higher level of cul­tural diversity to the campus during Monday's meeting. 
The new Minorities, Interna­tional, and Non-Traditional Student Life (MINT) director, Marciela Ramirez, will intro­duce herself to the board at next Tuesday's meeting. Ramirez replaced Professor Patricia Washington at the be­ginning of the semester. 
The Board also spoke on preparing for the upcoming National Association of Students at Catholic Colleges and Universities (NASCCU) conference. The conference will be held on February 4-7 at Notre Dame. 
"The conference will be cen­tered around the issue of cul­tural diversity," said Saint Mary's student body president, Tina Carrara. 
BOG has been asked to make a $500 contribution to the keynote speaker's fee of $2,500. The speaker will be Roy Inez, Commissioner of Ra­cial Inequality in Washington D.C. 
Because BOG has a tight bud­get, board members suggested that Joe Cataldo and Mike Schmiedeler, NASSCU coordi­nators at Notre Dame, be in­vited to explain how the money will be beneficial to the confer­ence. 
"We are hoping to send at least six women to the confer­ence," said Carrara. Saint Mary students wishing to attend must pay a $50 registration fee per person. 
In old business, BOG and the Saint Mary's Observer staff held a meeting last Thursday to discuss concerns and positions between their staffs. According

Tornadoes rip across North Carolina, killing two 
By PANCHO LOZANO Business Editor 
Recent economic troubles along with the soaring cost of education have left parents and prospective college students with the burden of trying to find some way to lift the weight of education costs. 
One way to ease the burden is to qualify for a scholarship, and with that comes the arduous task of researching and filling out scholarship applications. 
Because of all the work in­volved, students often turn to­wards scholarship-finding businesses, independent com­panies that match college stu­dents to scholarships listed in

student turn to an independent company in search of scholar­ships, Russo said. 
"Go through the routine, exhaust all the standard ap­proaches, and then if you still don't fmd anything you can turn towards these," added Russo. 
Critics of scholarship search companies have stated that these services are a fraud and offer nothing for the fee they charge. 
But Russo is hesitant to stereotype all these services as illegitimate. 
"Most of these places are right on the margin in terms of advertising with logos, so you

ND receives record level contributions 
Special to The Observer 

Cash contributions to the University of Notre Dame ex­ceeded $47 million in fiscal year 1992, an increase of al­most $1 million from the previ­ous year, according to the an­nual report of the University's Department of Development. 
The total, which does not take into account pledges of future gifts, included record levels in foundation and corporate support, the Annual Fund and the Sorin Society. 
"We're pleased with what we raised, especially in light of the sluggish economy, but we know that an institution of our size and quality will need even more in the future," said Daniel Reagan, director of develop­ment. 
Foundation and corporate support totaled $22 million, a 15 percent increase over 1991 and $1.2 million more than the previous best year of 1988. Among U.S. colleges and uni­versities, Notre Dame continues to rank behind only Harvard and Yale Universities in matching gifts, generating $2.4 million in 1992. 
In its 49th year, the Annual Fund raised $11.8 million, an increase of 6 percent over 1991 and the ninth consecutive record-breaking year. The fund received $52,217 gifts, an 8.5 percent increase over the previous year and also a record. 
The Sorin Society raised a record $5.4 million, $600,000 more than last year. The Sorin Society includes contributors of a minimum of $1,000 annually in unrestricted gifts as well as

computerized databases. 
For a fee, students can hire one of the companies to search for scholarship opportunities. The students fill out a questionnaire, and the company's database matches the information with scholarship opportunities. 
Many college counselors ob­ject to these services because students turn to scholarship search companies too hastily and do not scrutinize their op­tions thoroughly. 

Joseph Russo, director of the Office of Financial Aid for the University, said that students should stick to the norm in terms of applying for scholar­ships. 
"Ninety-five percent of the resources to help students come through the standard routine," Russo said. 
Russo said the resources that students need to find scholar­ships are publicly available, such as public libraries, gov­ernment agencies, and high school and college counselors.

(AP) Tornadoes ripped across North Carolina early Monday, smashing houses and tossing a school bus full of kids off a road before a deadly storm system headed out to sea. 
Two people were killed in North Carolina, boosting the death toll to 25 from the bar­rage of tornadoes through 11 states. 
"Several mobile homes are just frames laying in the middle of the road.... It's pretty exten­sive," said rescue squad mem­ber Ray DeFriess of the damage in Hillsborough, N.C., 30 miles northwest of Raleigh. He estimated 40 to 50 homes were destroyed. 
And in the wake of that weather system, a new storm built in strength Monday in the Rockies. A blizzard closed schools and highways in Col­orado and Wyoming, and avalanches closed canyon roads in Utah, where one ski resort got 35 inches of snow. Wyoming state government offices closed in Cheyenne. 
Other deaths from the unusual November thunderstorm system included 15 in Mississippi; five in Georgia; and one each in Tennessee, Kentucky and South Carolina. 
The first tornadoes had hit Louisiana and Texas on Satur­day, damaging about 300 homes in Houston but causing only minor injuries. A northern extension of the storm system set off tornadoes in Indiana and Ohio. Alabama also was struck. 
Hundreds of people were in­jured. 
More than a dozen North Carolina counties reported damage or injuries Monday. Tornadoes caused extensive power outages, snapped trees, blocked roads and delayed the start of school and work for thousands. 
In Pasquotank County in the state's northeastern corner, a tornado picked up a school bus and carried it 20 to 25 feet, said Sheriff D.M. Sawyer. Twenty-seven children and the driver were treated at a hospital. All injuries treated by late morning were serious, said hospital spokeswoman Diana Gardner. 
Near Wilson's Mills, about 20 miles southeast of Raleigh, Sandra Ward saw a twister pick up a neighbor's mobile home and smash it into a field across the road, throwing a couple and their baby outside. 
"It just lifted it up, rolled it in the air and slammed it down," Ms. Ward said. The baby, found in a field, and its mother were hospitalized, she said. 
Federal and state damage assessment teams moved into Mississippi on Monday. 
"It was absolute total devas­tation," Gov. Kirk Fordice said after touring hard-hit Rankin County, where 10 people died. 
Georgia Gov. Zell Miller toured hard-hit areas Monday and said damage caused Sunday was very severe. The town of White Plains "looks like a war zone," he said. 

Miller said it appeared that one tornado touched down in Putnam County "and just hugged the ground for about 10 or 15 miles, just cutting a path of destruction all along the way." 
"It just got real black and there was a continuous roar like thunder for about 30 min­utes," said Putnam County resident Evalyn Maddox. 
The unseasonable weather was caused by a southern flow of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico sliding under much colder westerly wind higher in the atmosphere, said Henry Steigerwaldt, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Indianapolis. 
In the West, a blizzard warning was in effect for parts of Colorado thrpugh Tuesday morning.

INSIDE COLUMN 



Give thanks for turkey, stuffing and learning 
Since this week's Inside Column sarcasm quota has been filled, this column is for those of you who, like me, are "stuck" here for Thanksgiving. 

For the fourth year in a row, I will be spending the Thanksgiving holiday Paul Pearson on the Notre Dame Associate News Editor 
campus. Am I depressed? No, and I'll explain why. 

At the beginning of my freshman year, I knew that I would not be going home for Thanksgiving. Since Tampa is quite a long distance away from South Bend, I could not afford to go home for both October break and Thanksgiving. Therefore, my parents and I agreed that it would be better for me to come home in October and spend November on campus. 
At first, I had a few mixed feelings about this. I was glad to see my family in October, but the thought of missing the family turkey dinner and eating at South Dining Hall did not leave me feeling very thankful. 

My roommate, Joseph, was also stuck here for Thanksgiving, and that cheered me a little. What I didn't know was that Joseph's mother had sent us the makings of a traditional Thanksgiving dinner, including seasonings for the stuffing and after-dinner mints. She also sent us complete instructions for cooking our own dinner. 
That cheered me a lot. 

Now that we were armed with this stuff, we decided to forget the dining hall and have our own Thanksgiving dinner in our dorm. That Wednesday night, after inviting some guests over for the dinner, we bought a large turkey breast and some mixed nuts to serve to guests while the dinner was being prepared. 
The next day, beginning very early in the morning, we prepared our own family-style Thanksgiving. We turned our room into a dining room, complete with a long table (made from a wardrobe door), set four full dinner places (with real plates and silverware) and served a dinner for four: turkey, stuffing, rolls, honey-glazed carrots, cranberry sauce, green beans, white wine, mixed nuts, and apple pie and coffee for dessert. 
Our guests were impressed. We also impressed ourselves. Not only did we avoid burning the turkey, but we put out a feast that got rave reviews. We even had enough leftovers to last us through the rest of the weekend (which would have been even better had it not been for the Miami game and the "3rd-and-34" play). 
That's how Joseph and I have done Thanksgiving dinner ever since. By now, we are experts at the turkey dinner. 
However, due to various circumstances (like the fact that our dorm no longer has ovens), we will have to settle for after-dinner coffee and apple pie. 
By spending Thanksgiving at Notre Dame, we learned how to fend for ourselves (and that pie tins are NOT suitable for microwave use). More importantly, we've learned that Thanksgiving is not as much about a meal as it is about cooperation, friendship and togetherness. 
Things worth giving thanks for.

CAPE 
CANAVERAL, Fla. -On its third try, the Air Force launched a rocket carrying a $6S million navigation satellite. The threat of lightning Sunday al­most forced another delay, but conditions improved and the 12 1/2-story Delta rocket blasted off about six minutes late. The Navstar Global Positioning System satellite is the 16th in a series of advanced navigation spacecraft. The Air Force wants to eventually have 24 orbiting 12,SOO miles above Earth. A Nov. 6 attempt was aborted when the engine failed to ignite. A launch planned for Saturday was thwarted by clouds and pos­sible lightning. 

SOUTH 
BE D, lnd.-The city of South Bend has no plans to annex the University of Notre Dame or Saint Mary's College, Mayor Joseph Kernan told the South Bend Tribune Thursday. Although the city is currently researching the possibility of annexing 




several areas north of South Bend, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's "are not part of any annexation plan today, tomorrow, or at any time in the future," Kernan said. Notre Dame officials said Monday that the University is not involved in any way with the city's annexation plans.

The largest fundraiser came from the $316 generated from the sales of 300 cups during Senior Bar's ND for the Homeless Night, he said. "We owe a lot of the fundraising success to the Alumni/Senior Club," he added. The T-shirts supporting ND for the Homeless are still available for $10 in the office of student government.

Reviewing second to second detail of the Kennedy assassi­nation, Jack Gordon concluded that there is no definitive an­swer to the case in a lecture Monday night. 
Gordon, who has studied the Kennedy assassination for over 12 years, went over slides, pic­ture, sketches, and amateur video footage of the day of the assassination in Dallas, Texas. 
"In my opinion there are three parts to the case: con­spiracy, the CIA and the Cuban factor," said Gordon. 
In 1993 some of the Warren reports may be released to the public. Gordon said that even then the media will have head­lines stating that no conspiracy 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign probably did not strike a hostage deal with Iran but was on "the outer limits of propri­ety" in its dealings on the issue, congressional investigators concluded Monday. 
The investigators said there was insufficient credible evi­dence to suggest that the cam­paign negotiated a delay in the release of 52 American hostages to ensure Ronald Reagan's election, as some have alleged. 
"The great weight of the evi­dence is that there was no such deal," concluded the report, is­sued by the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on the Near East after a seven-month investigation. 
But the panel also found that the Republican campaign team, headed by William Casey was intensely interested in the hostage issue and came dan­gerously close to improper in­terference in U.S. foreign policy was involved. 
In displaying the evidence of pictures, he pointsed out where the Warren commission con­tradicts what witnesses and doctors said. Gordon urged stu­dents to look into this detail be­cause it will help them to better understand the whole picture. 
Doctors and interns in the emergency room that day said that the hole in the back of the head was large and possibly an exit wound, said Gordon. The Warren reports contradict the witnesses by showing that the bullet hole was small and was an entrance wound. 
Gordon said the film, "J. F. K.," done by Oliver Stone has many flaws. "It is dangerous to accept the film as the gospel when talking about the case ... students need to do other re­
in its monitoring of the situa­tion. 
"In so doing, they were op­erating on the outer limits of propriety, considering their status as private citizens with­out authority to interfere in the conduct of the foreign relations of the United States," the report said. 
The subcommittee's ranking Republican, Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont, said the report was completed Oct. 15, but there wasn't enough time to review and release it before the Nov. 3 presidential election. 
"No matter when we released it, there would be questions about the timing," Jeffords said. "We didn't think it would make a difference" in the election's outcome. 
The subcommittee said nu­merous questions remain unanswered, including the ex­tent of hostage dealings by Reagan operatives between the election and his inauguration. Reagan himself still has not co-

search." 
Since the assassination oc­curred 29 years ago, the trail is cold, said Gordon. 
"It is almost a myth by now. This is a gold mine for stu­dents, he said. "The third gen­eration needs to seed out what happen and be meticulous in their work." 
The public will never know what Lee Harvey Oswald said, according to Gordon. No audio tapes or short hand were taken on his two days of testimony, said Gordon. 
Many people had questions concerning the single bullet theory, but Gordon shot down this idea. "I become very an­gered at the single bullet the­ory. There is no way that I be­lieve it was possible," he said. 
operated fully with the investi­gation and key documents of Casey, who later became the director of central intelligence and died in 1987, remain unac­counted for, it said. 
Washington attorney Reid Weingarten, hired by the sub­committee to look into the mat­ter, said his $75,000 budget was inadequate for the kind of in-depth probe he would have liked. 
The subcommittee chairman, Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C., said he hoped a House task force, scheduled to release its own report by year's end, will get to the bottom of those and other questions. 
The Senate panel found many of the story's central witnesses "wholly unreliable," and many events and meetings they recounted either were disproved or were riddled with holes. 
Documents from Casey, in­cluding his passport, have not been found. 

MACON, Ga. (AP) -Presi­dent-elect Clinton put his politi­cal capital on the line Monday against a cavalcade of Republi­can heavyweights in Georgia's Senate runoff, saying he needs Democrat Wyche Fowler "to break this gridlock in Washing­ton." 
"You know what they're saying about this race?" Clin­ton said of the Republicans. "If you beat Wyche Fowler it will be easier for us to block every­thing President-elect Clinton wants to do." 
A victory by Fowler would likely give the Democrats a net gain of one seat in the next Se­nate, for a 58-42 advantage. 
GOP challenger Paul Coverdell, a former director of the Peace Corps, brought in big-name Republicans on his side, including Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, Edu­cation Secretary Lamar Alexander, Labor Secretary Lynn Martin and others. 
More than 2,000 people turned out for Fowler and Clin­ton at a city hall rally in Macon. It had all the trappings of a presidential visit, with Secret Service sharpshooters on rooftops and a requirement that the audience pass through metal detectors. 
Clinton delighted the audi­ence by borrowing a saxo­phone after his speech to sit in with the Central High School band. As he played the tune of "Hey, Baby," the people sang, "Hey, Bill, will you be my prez?" instead of "Hey, baby will you be my girl." 
In his speech, Clinton resur­rected his familiar campaign pledges for health insurance, campaign reform, and an end to "trickle-down economics." 
"There are better things for him to be doing today," Fowler said of Clinton, referring to the task of building his administra­tion.

Women urge Senate to study sex charges 
WASHINGTON (AP) Women's groups urged the Se­nate on Monday to investigate allegations by 10 women that they were targets of unwel­come sexual advances from Sen. Bob Packwood. Several activists on women's issues said Packwood should resign, but an aide said he would not. 
"There's no way he can re­gain our trust," said Mary Nolan, an abortion rights ac­tivist in Oregon who called for his resignation. 
Two Oregon members of Congress, both Democrats, said the Senate Ethics Committee should review the allegations. So did leaders of women's groups, several of whom said the allegations caught them by surprise given Packwood's reputation as an advocate of women's rights. 
"Obviously they ought to look at this. Otherwise it is a farce to have such a committee," said Harriett Woods, head of the National Women's Political Caucus. 
"It is very disturbing that someone who has been a leader on these issues would not have translated them into personal dealings," added Loretta Ucelli, a spokeswoman for the National Abortion Rights Action League. 
Packwood remained on vaca­tion Monday, his whereabouts kept secret. 
Aides issued a statement in his name Saturday night saying he was sorry if any women felt pressured by his conduct, but they said Monday he would not respond to the specific allegations, which first appeared in The Washington Post. 
"There are some partisan Democrats who would love him to resign, but he is not consid­ering that," said Josie Martin, his top aide on the Senate Fi­nance Committee.

Kevorkian involved in another suicide 
SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP) ­Dr. Jack Kevorkian attended the suicide of the cancer patient on Monday. It was his sixth assisted suicide. 
Catherine Andreyev, 46, of Coraopolis, Pa., turned on a device that allowed her to in­hale carbon monoxide gas through a mask, police said. 
"I consider this a well-tested, well-controlled, well-thought out medical procedure," Kevorkian said. 
"The aim of suicide is to end a life," he said. "The aim of this is to terminate unbearable suffering. I've made progress because for one more human being, suffering is ended." 
Kevorkian was charged with murder after the first three deaths, but each time the cases were dismissed because Michi­gan has no law against assisted suicide. 
His Michigan medical license has been suspended, but he remains licensed in California. 
Andreyev had suffered from cancer for six years, said Kevorkian's attorney Michael Schwartz. 
"This is a case of medicide," Schwartz said. "It is a situation where the object was to allevi­ate the pain and suffering for patients who wish to have that pain and suffering put to an end." 
Schwartz said Andreyev's condition was one "where she had no hope of a normal life, where her every day was wracked by pain, where she could not sleep because of her condition." 
"Each additional day was a day of horror and dread," he said. 
Andreyev died in a Waterford Township house owned by a Kevorkian supporter. The same house was used the last time Kevorkian assisted in a suicide, said police Officer William Himmelspach. 
Kevorkian and four friends of the woman were present at the death, the attorney said. Also present were Kevorkian's sister and the homeowner. 
No one in the bouse was de­tained by police, Himmelspach said. 
Andreyev was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1986, when her cancerous right breast was removed, Schwartz said. Despite chemotherapy, the cancer spread to her left lung, which was removed. By 1991. her other lung was infected, and cancer had spread to her breast bone, he said. 
She was single and had no children, Schwartz said. Her parents are dead, and she had no siblings. One family member -a cousin from Scotland ­was aware of her suicide plans. 
Andreyev had approached Kevorkian through letters and received counseling over the telephone, Schwartz said. 
Kevorkian had met with An­dreyev's oncologist about her condition and had seen her medical reports, Schwartz said.

Doctors should ask old if they're abused 
NEW YORK (AP) -Doctors should routinely ask elderly patients if they are being abused or neglected, a problem affecting perhaps 2 million Americans every year, the American Medical Association said Monday. 
Mistreatment occurs in men and women of all racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups, and most physicians will encounter some in their patients, the AMA said. 
The document by the nation's largest organization for doctors recommends such questions as: 
Has anyone at home ever hurt you? 

Has 
anyone ever scolded or threatened you? 

Have 
you ever signed any documents that you didn't un­derstand? 

Are 
you alone a lot? 

Are 
you afraid of anyone at home? 


"If you don't ask, you won't find out," Dr. Mark Lachs, co­author of the guidelines, told reporters. 
The interview and a thorough physical examination should be done apart from the patient's caregiver or any suspected abuser, the guidelines say. 
Doctors should ask how and when any mistreatment occurs, who does it and how the patient feels about it and copes with it. Doctor who suspect abuse should report it to authorities. 
If the patient appears in im­mediate danger, the doctor also should consider putting the pa­tient in a hospital or getting a court order for protection. 
The AMA also said doctors can play a crucial role in identi­fying and preventing abuse in nursing homes and other insti­tutions. Residents have the right to be free of physical re­straints or mind-altering drugs given for discipline or conve­nience, the guidelines say. 

Soup kitchens prepare to set many places for Thanksgiving dinner 
(AP) It's not official like a gov­ernment statistic, but you don't need an economist to see that what might be called the Hunger Pain Rate is rising across America. 
Food pantries and soup kitchens from Hawaii to Florida are prepared to set many more places at Thanksgiving tables for entire families. 
"You see, here's the thing," said Rev. Hezekiah Stewart, head of the Watershed Human and Community Development Agency in Little Rock, Ark. "There are a lot of people out here with jobs who also need assistance. They're living right at the poverty line."

As Little Rock goes this Thanksgiving Day, so goes much of the nation, where an estimated 30 million people now go hungry on a daily basis. 
"We are seeing an increase in the number of families coming into our dining rooms," said Laura Knox, spokeswoman for St. Vincent de Paul in Phoenix, which expects more than 4,000 people Thursday. 
"In the past, it mostly was the individual male," said Knox. "The environment in our dining halls have really changed with all these kids." 
The Census Bureau reported that poverty reached a 27 -year high in 1991 while household incomes fell. Requests for emergency food aid increased 26 percent in major American cities last year, according to the 

U.S. Conference of Mayors. 
The estimate of more than 30 million Americans going hungry came from the Tufts University Center on Hunger, Poverty and Nutrition. 
A line began forming before 6 
a.m. Monday at the Northwest Harvest's food bank in downtown Seattle. By the time it opened at 9 a.m., several hundred people were waiting. Each received a turkey hindquarter and small sack of rice. They also could take noo­dles, navy beans, bread, onions, potatoes, cabbage and canned goods. 
Salvation Army major Chris Buchanan in San Francisco, where three dining rooms plan to serve 5,000 people, observed with alarm "the absolute panic of people expecting to be in se­rious trouble." Some people are already asking about Christmas meals. 

On Hawaii's hurricane-rav­aged Kauai Island, the Salvation Army, hotels and the county will be host of a Thanksgiving Day meal, with free toys for children. 
Hard as hunger and loneliness can be, admitting it can cause the deepest ache. 
"There's a stigma about ask­ing for help," said Bill Carey, director of the Missoula Food Bank in Montana. "There's a frontier spirit here. Sometimes people will come and ask for a friend or a family member: 'Can we have some food to take?' because they won't come in."

U.N. to escort relief convoys 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herze­govina (AP)--U.N. officials, angered by disruptions of their relief efforts, said Monday they will send armored vehicles to escort food convoys to two of the most food-starved cities in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Fighting at Sarajevo's airport forced U.N. officials to suspend operations Monday afternoon and cancel the day's last two re­lief flights. 
"Every week we are attacked, shelled, turned back, diverted," said Jose Maria Mendiluce, the 
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' special envoy to Bosnia. "We have assumed a very important responsibility ­to keep alive the victims of this conflict during the winter. We will do it." 
Western warships enforcing a naval blockade of Serbia and Montenegro stopped and searched two ships in the Adri­atic on Monday, following a U.N. Security Council vote last week to tighten the sanctions. 
Both vessels -one from Ecuador, one from Syria ­were allowed to continue when no contraband was found. 
The Security Council imposed the embargo in May to punish Serbia for fomenting the Bosnian war. More than 14,000 people have been killed in fighting which broke out after the republic's majority Muslims and Croats voted in February for independence from Yugoslavia. 
Serb rebels have captured more than 70 percent of the republic, and Croat forces hold much of the rest. The Muslims hold Sarajevo and little else. 
In New York, Elie Wiesel, who won the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize for his writings on surviving Nazi death camps, said in a telephone interview Monday he will travel to Bosnia-Herzegov­ina this week to visit prison camps there. He did not want his arrival date publicized for security reasons. 
All three warring groups have been accused of purging areas they control of other ethnic groups, but the international community has blamed the Serbs most for creating concentration camps and committing atrocities. 
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said in Geneva that Yugoslav Premier Milan Panic will go to Geneva on Wednesday to meet with Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, co-chairmen of the peace talks sponsored jointly by the United Nations and the Eu­ropean Community. Eckhard said the talks were likely to be general. 
U.N. officials said relief con­voys will leave Wednesday for Gorazde and Srebrenica, where Serb forces have cut off the mainly Muslim populations from the outside world. 
They said the convoys would test new commitments by commanders on all sides to let 
U.N. relief workers go where needed, and the control the commanders exert over their forces. 
Only two earlier convoys reached the 100,000 people still in Gorazde, under siege for much of the war. Srebrenica has not been reached at all. 
The 80,000 people in Sre­brenica "are at the very limit of their survival capacity," Mendiluce told reporters. Ear­lier this month, a relief convoy headed for Srebrenica was turned back by Serb militia commanders. 
.. Mendiluce said his agency was intent on getting through this time and would seek world denunciation if Serb leaders reneged on a new promise to allow access.

Marietta purchases GM Aerospace 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Martin Marietta Corp. said Monday that it will purchase General Electric Co.'s aerospace business for more than $3 billion to create the world's largest aerospace electronics company. 
"The defense budget is clearly declining, and the industry must consolidate," said Martin Marietta chief executive and chairman Norman Augustine. "The companies that do consolidate early will be the survivors. 
"There is room for strong survivors," Augustine said. "There is no room for weak companies." 
General Electric will receive cash and $1 billion in convert­ible preferred stock in Martin Marietta. The Bethesda, Md.­based company will expand its board of directors by two members to be nominated by GE and supported by Martin Marietta's management. 
George Podrasky, a securities analyst at Duff & Phelps in Chicago, said each major de­fense company is developing its own strategy to deal with the decline in the defense budget. 
"Martin Marietta has been interested in acquisitions and has tried to get LTV Aerospace (earlier this year) and did not succeed," Podrasky said. "I think if your sole or dominant focus is defense, then acquisi­tion can make sense for you." 
The two companies, however, characterized the deal as a merger. 
"This will be the largest aerospace electronics company in the world with unmatchable reach, reputation and resources of no other," said John Welch Jr., president and chief executive officer of GE. "While GE Aerospace is a world-leader in technology, it is one of sev­eral. So we looked for a busi­ness combination that could make us unique ... not just survive but to boldly move in the direction of global growth." 
The executives said a task force will recommend in no more than six months whether jobs need to be eliminated. 
However, Welch said he was certain that the Burlington, Vt., facility, which designs and manufacturers aircraft arma­ment and mobile air defense systems, would remain intact because it is so unique. 
With the addition of the GE operations, Martin Marietta's annual revenues will nearly double, approaching $11 bil­lion, including about $3 billion in sales from commercial and civil government customers. 
GE's aerospace division had revenue last year of $5.3 bil­lion, nearly as large as Martin Marietta's total 1991 revenue of $6.1 billion. 
Profit on GE's aerospace di­vision was $655 million last year, more than twice Martin Marietta's corporate profit of $313.2 million. 

Financial ministers discuss currency devaluations 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) ­European Community finance ministers met today to consider ways of propping up their faltering economies in the face of a third currency realignment in 10 weeks. 
The EC's Monetary Commit­tee on Sunday announced that the Spanish and Portuguese currencies would be devalued 6 percent today. 
The move demonstrated the fragility of the EC's system for keeping all its currency values closely linked. The trading bloc's economic turmoil has weakened hopes that the community will be able to meet its ambitious goal of economic and monetary union by century's end. 
The devaluations were made necessary by the continuing strength of the German mark, which is bolstered by interest rates that are being kept high to finance the country's unifi­cation. 
The mark's strength has left other economies comparatively weak. Devaluation makes a country's exports cheaper and tends to boost its economy -but imports become more ex­pensive and can fuel inflation. 
"We will be turning our minds to growth and the prospects for the European economy," said Norman Lam­ont, Briton's chancellor of the exchequer. He was chairing the daylong meeting at EC headquarters. 
The meeting could include discussion of a proposed initiative to boost EC members' economies by increasing spending on public works -similar to President­elect Clinton's proposal for stimulating the U.S. economy.

QUOTES, P.O. Box Q, ND, IN 46556 
Dear Editor: 

I have appreciated the many letters to the editor who argue biblically that acts of abortion and homosexuality are wrong. 
I offer a perspective on abor­tion that I hope will be accepted even by those who do not ac­cept the Holy Scriptures. It is my hope that through logical thinking, even if one is not a Christian, that abortion will be exposed for what it truly is. 
I pose two questions. I answer the first (only after providing the reader with three hints), but leave the reader to answer for himself the second question. 
Question #1: What do you call one who volunteers the most 
Dear Editor: 

In my previous letter, the assertion was made that sin is committed when voting for a pro-choice candidate because of the serious nature of the activ­ity. 
It was also declared that when the voter possesses "sufficient knowledge" of the candidate's pro-abortion posi­tion, mortal sin is committed, as the voter becomes an ac­complice. 
This declaration may seem extreme to a large portion of Catholic religious including the modernist experts. But as Cardinal Hans Von Balthasar observed, many Catholic ex­perts are apostates, i.e., heretics. 
weak and vulnerable members 
of society to be stripped of any 
government protection? 
Hint #1: You will never find this person volunteering himself to be stripped of any and all government protection and thereby allowing others to de­termine his fate. 
He is vehemently opposed to receiving the very hardship that he insists be imposed upon others. The very right he enjoys and tenaciously clings to, is the very right he insists be stripped from others. 
Hint #2: This stripping of rights is done in order to pro­tect one's own liabilities from the biological consequences 
There is absolute culpability when voting for a pro-abortion candidate as millions of Catholics did in this past elec­tion. The American Catholic population, as Pope John Paul II suggested, has lost the sense of sin. 
Catholics can no longer differentiate between right and wrong. The American clergy's legitimizing contraception and divorce through annulment ig­nited the decline into moral blindness. 
The lack of specific moral counsel by American priests including those in academia was appalling. Never before in the history of civilization did the leadership of the Church have a more profound responsibility to he/she (and not the condemned party) has already set in mo­tion. 
Hint #3: This individual is so bent on accommodating sensual pleasure that he/she would not allow another's right to life to interfere with this hedonistic lifestyle. 
Answer: Pro-choice 

Question #2: Why have we al­lowed the adage "one's rights ends when another's nose be­gins" to be selectively absent from out public policy on abor­tion? What breach of reason attempts to justify this? 
Pieder Beeli Graduate Student Nov. 19, 1992 
speak prophetically concerning the monumental issue of abortion. A thunderous silence was heard from the American prelates. 
Because multitudes of Catholics supported pro-abor­tion candidates such as William Clinton, surely God will be compelled to chastise prelates and people. 
If the Father did not correct his faithless children, He would contradict his nature, which is perfect justice as well as perfect 
love. He can never do this.

Reds' owner accused of racial slurs toward players 

CINCINNATI (AP) -Cincin­nati Reds owner Marge Schott's racial remarks about two former black players hit a nerve in this city. 
A former employee's lawsuit that brought the issue to light has made it a topic on Cincin­nati's call-in radio talk shows. 
Mike McMurray, host of a daily radio talk show on radio station WCKY-AM, said Monday he received at least 30 phone calls during two days last week when the topic heated up. 
"They were either for or against, there was no in-be­tween. She was either guilty of it or not," McMurray said. "I got a lot of calls from people saying, 'She couldn't mean it.' ... There were more defending her." 
Former Reds employees have alleged in depositions taken in a lawsuit filed by former controller Tim Sabo that Schott made derogatory references to blacks and Jews, and kept a Nazi swastika arm band at home. The lawsuit involved Sabo's challenge of his firing in 1991. 
The depositions alleged that Schott referred to two former 
black Reds players  - Dave  
Parker and Eric Davis ­ as her  
"million-dollar niggers."  

Schott denied making those comments. But in a statement taken from her under oath for the lawsuit, she admitted using the word "nigger." 
A message seeking comment was left for Schott on Monday. 
After a meeting with black leaders on Friday, Schott said in a written statement: "While I maintain that these allegations are untrue, if I have said any­thing to offend anyone, it was never my intention and I apol­ogize for any hurt it may have caused. 
"I want to make it clear to everyone and especially to our young people that prejudice and bigotry are hurtful, hateful, unacceptable and demeaning to all people. They have no place in Cincinnati or anywhere. I don't care what color, sex or re­ligion a person is. I judge peo­ple on the job they can do." 
The accusations were made public just two weeks after Schott hired Tony Perez, a Cuban, to manage. Perez said he's never had a problem with Schott. 
Parker said Monday that he has talked to national black leaders to take the matter to the major-league team owners and league president. 
But he said Schott never never made any racial slurs to him. "I would have retaliated immediately," he said.

Volleyball club loses more than match ..­
By KEVIN DOLAN Sports Writer 
The men's volleyball tourna­ment at the J.A.C.C. on Sunday was a mix of good and bad for the volleyball team, but the bad was extremely bad. 
The Irish defeated Michigan 15-7, 15-12, 14-16, 8-15. 16-14, and lost to Michigan State 4-15, 13-15, 15-13, 11-15, but the biggest loss of the day was middle hitter P.J. Stettin, who suffered a broken lower leg and dislocated ankle early in the fourth game of the Michigan match. 
Stettin was going up to block a Michigan spike when he landed with his foot at a very ugly angle, holding up the game for nearly twenty minutes. 
Stettin's injury came just be­fore the Michigan State game, and drastically affected the out­come of that match. 
"When you lose a starter, you have to change your rotations to accommodate the injury, and that usually affects team play," said club president Pat Madden.

Williams: A ray of hope for Irish 


By JASON KELLY Sports Writer 
There is good news and bad news for the Notre Dame men's basketball team. 
The good news is that Monty Williams is back after sitting out two years because of a heart ailment. 
The bad news is that the Irish need about three more Monties. In Monday's exhibition loss to 
U.S.A. Verich, Williams led the Irish with 17 points and 15 re­bounds. He seemed to be ev­erywhere in the first half, driving to the basket, scoring from outside and pulling down rebounds to keep the Irish within striking distance. But Williams appears to be the team's only weapon and that doesn't bode well for Notre Dame's chances this season. 
He cannot single-handedly carry the weight of a schedule that includes five of the nation's top seven teams, and he is feel­ing the pressure. 
"I was really nervous all day," the senior captain said. "I try not to put too much pressure on myself, but I want to prove to Coach (John) McLeod that I can contribute." 
McLeod knows he can con­

Game 4 saw a good general performance by the Irish, but most scoring opportunities were stifled by the Spartans. The Irish managed to tie the score 8-8, but from then on MSU controlled the game, winning when a Marin shot failed to clear the net. 
Ceponis said, "There were plenty of positives (in the MSU match). We didn't give up, and we were right in it most of the time." 
Madden added, "I'm happy with the games we won, but we've played a lot better. It was just tough having P.J. out of there." 
With a look of determination bred by frustration, Ceponis vowed, "We will beat Michigan State this year." 
Much of that will depend on the recovery of Stettin, who faces surgery today and a long recovery, but the Irish demon­strated enough balance and talent on Sunday to bring Ce­ponis' goal into reality when the regular season begins.

Monty Williams 
tribute, the only question is his conditioning. 
"Tonight was a good condi­tioner in itself just to go for thirty minutes working hard, huffing and puffing," MacLeod said. "His effort is good, but he still needs to go through the practices and training to get where we want him." 
Where the Irish want him is on the court, and as much as possible. He wasn't as strong a force in the second half, scoring only three points, but his stamina will come in time and consistent play will follow. 
But the Irish cannot live on Monty alone, and it showed Monday night. 
Russell and Taylor are the team's only other proven per­formers. Juniors Carl Cozen and Brooks Boyer saw only lim­ited action, and Joe and Jon Ross are seeing the first ex­tended action of their careers 

and without their support, Williams efforts could be wasted. 
And he won't be satisfied until the team is successful. 
"We didn't do the little things we need to do to win," Williams said of Monday night's loss. "But every game is a learning experience and we need to re­group and come back stronger." 
Williams is an expert on comebacks. Doctors said he would never play again when they discovered his rare heart problem after his freshman season. That kind of strenuous activity, they said, could ulti­mately kill him. 
He satisfied his itch to play with two years of pick-up games, but it was never enough. He needed to return to the competition of the college game and this year the doctors finally gave him the green light. 
If he can comeback from those odds, he is the perfect man to lead the Irish against the towering odds that they face this season. He may not be the team's savior, but he does provide a ray of hope for a sea­son that otherwise looks bleak. 
"We did have a few bright spots tonight," McLeod said. "I was pleased with the way Williams competed." 
And Williams is just pleased to be competing. "I just thank God that I am able to play again," he says. He's not the only one. 
The roads are dangerous this Holiday weekend. 
Please drive carefully.

KEEP YOUR EVES ON ... 
By GEORGE DOHRMANN 
Sports Writer 
"It's Notre Dame versus USC. It's THE game." 
Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz's comments at his weekly press conference, showed the significance of Saturday's matchup between the fifth­ranked Irish and the 19th-ranked Trojans. 
USC, sporting a 6-3-1 record and two losses in the last three games, doesn't appear to be the powerhouse which over the course of a 63-game series has handed Notre Dame more losses than any other school. But this season has seen coach Larry Smith's team rise from a 3-9 record in 1991 to respectability. 
Six straight loses to end last season, gave way to 5-1-1 record after seven games this year. Wins over Oklahoma, Washington State and Arizona have highlighted a year lacking in consistency, but loaded with promise. 
And as Notre Dame prepares for the Men of Troy, it is the potential, not the inconsistency which scares coach Lou Holtz and the Irish. 
"From top to bottom USC is the fastest team I've ever seen on film, bar-none," commented Holtz. 
The team speed Holtz emphasized is evident on both sides of the ball. The Trojans defense ranks sixth in rush de­fense, allowing just under 100 yards a game. A big reason for the lack of ground success can be accredited to USC's standout quartet of linebackers. Sophomores Brian Williams and Jeff Kopp roam the inside, while bookends 
Rivalry continues with Trojans 
Smith hopes to prevent a decade of NO dominance 
Willie McGinest and David Webb contain 
the outside. 
"McGinest and Williams are 
outstanding football players," said Holtz. 
"We will need to neutralize them to be 
effective." The 6'6" 240 lb McGinest has 
teamed with the 6'4" 225 lb Webb to 
give USC a credible pass rush this 
season. The duo has totaled nineteen 
sacks on the year, and ranks one-two in 
tackles for a loss. 
Notre Dame will not shy away from the ·strength of the Trojan defense. The "Killer B's" backfield composed of Reggie Brooks, Jerome Bettis, and Lee Becton is clearly the strength of the offense, and in recent weeks Holtz has illustrated his desire to make the ground game the focus of the offense. 
"He's a great fullback," Smith said of Bettis after last season's 24-20 Notre Dame win. "The best I've ever seen. He's the core of the Notre Dame offense." 
With McGinest and Webb supplying the pressure, Irish quarterback Rick Mirer may not have much time to pass. In addition, the Trojan secondary is loaded with speed and experience. All but one slot is filled by an returning starter and safeties Stephon Pace and Jason Sehorn have five of Southern Cal's nine interceptions on the year. 
The Irish defense enters the game with more confidence then it has had all season. Impressive performances in back-to back wins against Boston College and Penn State leave Holtz with few complaints. 
"We needed to develop a defensive temperament, an attitude is very important," said Holtz. "And we have and we are staying with fundamentals. (defensive coordinator) Rick Minter has done a tremendous job, and we have gotten better and better. 
"This defense has become very aggressive, even a little bit nasty. They'll hit you when they don't have to." 
USC will put the iiiiproving Irish defense to the test. Sophomore quarterback Rob Johnson started slow, but has improved vastly in the past weeks. At Johnson's disposal is a host of swift, athletic wideouts. Flanker Curtis Conway may be the best of the bunch averaging 16.5 yards a reception. The 6'2" junior ranks seventh in the country in all-purpose yardage (161 per game) and heads the Trojan special teams, ranking fifth in the nation in kickoff returns. Split end Johnnie Morton ranks second behind Conway in receptions and boasts similar breakaway speed. 
"Tailback U." has lacked a sole standout in recent years with Smith preferring a tailback by committee. This year's staff is headed by Estrus Crayton and Dwight McFadden. The two speedsters each average about fifty yards per game, with Crayton receiving slightly more of the carries and is a more potent receiving threat out of the backfield. 
Smith is winless against Notre Dame in five tries as coach of the Trojans, and USC has lost nine consecutive games, dating back to 1983. Other than the battle of unbeatens that took place in 1988, this year appears to be the best opportunity for Smith and the Trojans to end the drought. a feeling shared by Holtz. 

ROB JOHNSON  WILLIE McGINEST  JOHNNIE MORTON  STEPHON PACE  CURTIS CONWAY  
The sophomore quarterback has been impressive this year. Johnson is 13th in the nation in passing efficiency and moving up on the USC passing list.  Junior outside linebacker is an impact player on the Trojan defense and an All-American candidate. McGinest leads USC in tackles for loss.  Junior split end is the Trojan's top receiver this year. Prior to the UCLA game, Morton had 98 catches and nine for touchdowns.  Senior safety was second on the team in tackles last year with 73. Pace is an All-Pac-10 candidate this year and leading USC in interceptions.  Junior flanker is the quicker member of the Trojan team. Conway has scored eight touchdowns this year including one on a kickoff return.

Nine years an eternity for Smith, Trojan fans 
Nine years. 

In the real world that mark carries no real significance. One short of a decade, one too many for a well-liked president, but in the world of college football nine years is an eternity for a coach and a program. 
And as fifth-ranked Notre Dame and 19th-ranked USC round out their regular season, college football's version of eternity comes to the surface in one of football's most famous rivalries. 
The nine years lingers like a curse for Trojan's coach Larry Smith. Now entering his sixth season, the former Arizona State coach has failed to beat the Irish at USC and has managed only a 3-2-1 record against cross-town rival UCLA. After a 38-37 loss to the Bruins last weekend, Smith needs a win against the Irish to secure a bowl birth, but more importantly, to keep his job. 
USC alumni began the call for a changing of the guard after last season's less-than comprehensible 3-9 finish. but a quick start this season quieted the whispers. But if Notre Dame is able to win its ninth game of the year, USC would finish at 6-4-1 and Smith could be dusting off the resume sooner than he expected. 
Trojan faithful have searched for years to find a replacement for John Robinson, who in six years of coaching, compiled a .819 winning percentage (the highest career percentage among USC coaches). He was also the last to win a national championship, and in 1982 coached the last team to beat Notre Dame. 
Since Robinson's departure the Trojans have fallen from the ranks of the elite, with the drought against Notre Dame glaring as a constant reminder. First, Ted Tollner and now, Smith have attempted to curb the losing ways but have found little success. USC's record since 1982 stands at 70-43-5. 
An inability to win against your biggest rivals isn't the best way to find job security (ask Ohio State's John Cooper). If Smith would have gone 2-9 this year, with both wins coming against Notre Dame and UCLA. odds are he would have more backing from alumni then if he were to go 6-4-1. 
Boosters seemed to lose faith in Smith near the end of the 1988 season when the Irish-Trojan clash mirrored the classics of old. Both teams were unbeaten, led by a Heisman trophy candidate, and staking claim to the national title. Unfortunately for Smith and the Trojans, Tony Rice, sporting the number nine on his jersey, led Notre Dame to a 27-10 win. 
USC has not rolled over in recent years. Since the 1988 game, The Trojans have lost by four points in the last three games. And during USC's nine year winless streak, Notre Dame's average margin of victory is a not so surprising, nine.

ND cross country sixth McWilliams paces NCAA charge 
By SEAN SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's cross country team finished sixth in the nation in the NCAA national meet yesterday in Bloomington, Ind. and Irish harrier Mike McWilliams earned All-America honors for the third consecutive year. 
The junior from Grove City, Penn. placed 24th in the meet with a time of 
31:34.1 over the lOK course. McWilliams is the first person in the history of Notre Dame cross country to win All-America honors in his first three years and is one of only two three-peat Notre Dame All-Americans in the sport of cross country. 
The Notre Dame team ran a strong race, but the performance was far from the team expectation of placing fourth. "We came up a little short," admitted senior team captain John Coyle. 
Notre Dame's less than golden performance was due to a slow start. 
"In the beginning we didn't get out fast enough," said Coyle. After the first two miles, the Irish pack was too spread out and too far back to contend for fourth place. However, the Fighting Irish did run a strong second half of the race. The sophomore combination of Nate Ruder and J.R. Meloro picked up the pace in the final miles to capture the sixth place finish. 
Although Coyle was dis-appointed with the results of the meet, he had only praise for the young team and the way they handled the pressure of this big meet. "They handled this race well, and they didn't back down. I'm optimistic about the future of this team and this

Inexperience, defense doom Irish, 76-68 

By MIKE SCRUDATO 
Sports Editor 
The biggest news last night's men's basketball exhibition opener produced was the insertion of Malik Russell into the starting lineup at small forward, as the Irish fell to USA Verich, 76-68. 
The move pushed Billy Taylor into the backcourt and co-captain Brooks Boyer to the bench. But, head coach John MacLeod insisted that the move was not permanent. 
"We made the move because of their shooting guard (Johnny McDole)," MacLeod explained. "We matched up better with Billy on him." 
MacLeod hinted that the starting 
lineup could change throughout the season depending on the opposition. "I think our players are flexible enough to handle it," he commented. 
Last night's starting five was a relatively new unit, and at times it was evident. 
"It is a very active and quick lineup, but we have not spent a lot of time on it," MacLeod said. "It was a typical first game. We were in sync at times and out of whack a lot." 
Both Taylor and Russell responded well to the move, scoring 15 and 10 points respectively. 
"I wasn't surprised by the move because coach (MacLeod) told me that I'd probably be starting;~ Russell said. 
"It's no different. If I'm starting or coming off the bench, I'm just trying to contribute." 
"This lineup makes us better defensively, but tonight we didn't execute very well defensively," Taylor added. 
As the Irish did early last season, they struggled in the man-to-man, as the Verich Reps had a lot of easy and second-chance baskets. 
"Defensively we didn't do what we had been drilling, and they tattooed us on the boards," MacLeod said. "If we want to run, we have to have the ball. We have to block people off the boards." 
Notre Dame, which played everyone, including walk-ons Sean Ryan and Patrick Keaney, in the first ten minutes of the game, was lead by Monty Williams' 17 points and 15 rebounds, and freshman Ryan Hoover had an solid first outing playing 14 minutes and com­mitting only one turnover at the point. 
While MacLeod was shuffling the lineup early in the game, Verich opened up a 27-18 lead and the traveling squad took a 41-35 edge into the locker room at the half. 
Though the Irish settled into a substitution pattern in the second half, they could draw no closer than 53-50 at the 12:28 mark on a Jon Ross' follow. Over the next five minutes, Verich went on a 13-4 streak led by former Ohio State player Ron Stokes, who scored eight of his 15 points in the run. 
Boyer ended the run with a trey, but it was too late for the Irish, as Verich cruised to the win. 
"We have to grow up quickly," MacLeod said of the team's condition. "We're behind schedule. We have to make a move soon because we're running out of time.':
