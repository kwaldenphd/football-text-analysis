Activism methods evolve with time 
Campus hosts prospects 
Event meant to attract talented minorities 
By ROHAN ANAND 
News Writer 
In its ongoing effort to attract a higher number of incoming stu­dents from diverse ethnic back­grounds, the Office of Admissions is hosting a select group of appli­cants from underrepresented groups for the annual Spring Visitation Weekend, commonly known as "Spring VIz." 
The Admissions office invited 150 high school seniors of Asian, African, Latino and Native American descent to visit from Thursday through Sunday as part of the event. 
A program -and recruitment tool-for attracting more under­represented minority students to Notre Dame, Spring Visitation has been held for almost 20 years and is directed by a team within the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. 
"We bring in ... the best and brightest minority students from all over the country to show them what Notre Dame is all about," Assistant Director of Admissions Son Nguyen said. "They stay with student hosts, see the dorm life, attend classes and explore all of the various clubs and organiza­tions avaiJable on campus." 
In addition to Nguyen, a stu­dent-led team of five members ­including junior Jesse Carrillo, senior Krystal Hardy, senior Covington Doan, sophomore Jaime Luna and sophomore Kellen Lewis -have helped coordinate the recruitment process, which began in September. The team has been contacting high school seniors

Shappell, Andrichik end term 
Student government leaders deem administration a success 
By KAITLYNN RIELY 
Assistant News Editor 
Student body president Lizzi Shappell and vice president Bill Andrichik are willing to contest anyone who claims student govern­ment doesn't do anything. 
But their accomplish­ments, they said, speak for themselves. 
"Over the past four years I've heard -I can't even count how many times ­that student government doesn't do anything," Andrichik said. "After this year, I would challenge someone to look at what we've done and still be able to say that."

OIT tests design for more group work 
By KAITLYNN RIELY 
Assistant News Editor 
With the goal of creating 
more flexible work space, the 
Office of Information 
Technologies {OIT) has 
removed half the computers 
from the cluster in the base­
ment of the Mendoza College 
of Business and plans to sub­
stantially reduce the number 
of computers in the Hesburgh 
Library computing lab over the 
summer. 
James Cope, OIT organiza­
tional communications analyst, 
said OIT is trying to find "the 
right configuration for stu­
dents today." 
Cope said research conduct­
ed by the OIT indicated that 
students want "the flexibility 
of more space." And creating 
that space, he said, sometimes 
means removing some com­
puters. 
Before spring break, the lab 
in rooms L004 of Mendoza 
contained 30 computers for 
student use. Fifteen of these 
computers were removed, so 
half remain. 
In the Library's computing 
cluster, there are currently 63 
computers. The Library and 
OIT plan to move the cluster to 
the first floor near the refer­
ence desk in the early summer. 
In this planned cluster, there 
will be 13 personal computers,

Editor's Note: This is the third article in a three-part series examining activism at Notre Dame: its current role on campus, how that role has changed and what those changes mean for the future. 
From the 1960s -when students took those first tentative steps out on the quad, pickets in hand -to now, when activism has cemented its role at Notre Dame, the list of issues has­n't changed much: 
War, international human­itarian crises, women's rights, gay rights, racism, abortion, the death penalty and workers' rights have continually tugged at the consciences of Notre Dame students over the years. What has changed, however, is the method of protest. 
Rare are the students who want to sit cross-legged defiantly in front of admin­istrators' offices or torch buildings. 
"The students of the 1960s tended to believe that almost anything and any structure could be changed,

On Peeps and eggs 
So you may not be a fan of pari­etals, single-sex dorms, or any of the other conservative policies enforced by a traditional Catholic university ­but I certainly hope you don't forget the benefits when they come. Aaron Steiner 
That is, in 
example, an News Production actual Easter Editor break. That extra Friday and Monday right in the midst of tests, projects and papers-it's a well-valued break. 
OK, you may think two extra days off doesn't make up for the some of the restrictions of a Catholic commu­nity you take issue with. But I have been celebrating the opportunity by rubbing it in all my friends' faces back home. Those friends at state schools who constantly remind me of the freedoms they enjoy outside Notre Dame have been getting a little taste of their own medicine. (You should have heard the responses. "What? Are you serious? Two days off?") 
Admittedly, I don't have any special plans for the weekend other than sleeping and, naturally, participating in the annual Easter Mass-brunch­family egg hunt extravaganza. 
I still participate in the Easter egg hunt? Absolutely. The bunny better find some good spots, however, because as the years have gone by I've learned where all the good hiding spots are. 
Let's talk about the food. Thanksgiving is turkey, Christmas is usually steak at our house, and Easter is ham. And who are we kid­ding, Easter ham by far and away wins. Plus it comes with Grandma's famous "hashbrown supreme." You haven't lived until you've tasted some of that. 
Of course, I'll also have my share of Peeps and spring colored M&M's, whether or not they come in plastic eggs. 
Speaking of Peeps, I will probably take the opportunity to blow a few up in the microwave, another regular custom, thanks to the ever-fascinated little brother. They never cease to amaze. 
Also included with the weekend will probably be the mandatory watching of "It's the Easter Bunny, Charlie Brown" and "Here Comes Peter Cottontail." 

Easter egg painting died out for me several years ago. Painting, drawing, whatever you want to call it was never my strength, and trying to do that on a fragile spherical surface is something I'll leave up to more talent­ed (and patient) people. 
So, yes, I enjoy Easter. It's a holiday with free candy, good food and relax­ation -not to mention the fact that most Christians can celebrate their salvation. 
I think you're supposed to feel blessed on Easter. And you better believe I'll be feeling blessed next Thursday on my way home when I think of my friends who are sitting back at school and getting ready for another day of classes and another weekend hanging around the dorm.

"So there might be periods of time when all those computers were in use, but there certainly were long periods of time when most of those computers were going unused," Burchett said. 
But Delphine Risto, a junior who is a cluster consultant for the Mendoza and DeBartolo clusters, said during the eight hours a week she works the Mendoza lab is always busy. 
"Ever since they took out the computers, it's been crazy," Risto said. "Computers are always full and people are coming in and complaining because there aren't enough computers. They show no sup­port of the change." 
Burchett said he is not sur­prised that a cluster worker observes the cluster is busy when she is working. 
"We try to staff the clusters when they are busy.... So it wouldn't surprise me that a student on duty would see these numbers," Burchett said. 
Risto estimated that the lab is at about 75 percent capacity or higher during the times that she works. Students have com­plained about the lower num­ber of computers available, she said. 
Burchett said OIT is trying out the new configurations to see if they better serve student needs. But, he said, if students are unhappy with the new setups or the lower number of computers, they can "absolute­ly" complain. 
"The configurations for the labs and the number of com­puters are always going to be adjusted for student need," Burchett said. 
He said OIT's primary goal is not to reduce the number of computers available, but to find the right ratio for students who use the computer clusters for multiple reasons. 
"If we find that students want to have more [comput­ers], we can order more and have them installed in a couple of weeks," he said. 
New trends in laptop owner­ship and cluster use 
The trend OIT has observed, Burchett said, is that students more and more have their own laptops. A recent survey showed that 93 percent of freshmen said they owned their own laptop. 
Risto said not everyone has a laptop and not all students want to carry them around to do work away from their rooms. 
"It was not thought out prop­erly," she said.

Burchett said the decision was not motivated by cost con­siderations. 
"That might be a side effect, but it's not really the primary motivation," he said. 
Burchett said the University adequately funds OIT to replace computers. 
"I don't think this is about reducing the amount of money we spend on the computing labs," he said. "I think it's about spending it in different ways because the configuration is changing." 
And with the cost of the new configuration of the Hesburgh Library computer cluster, there may be few overall savings, he said. Burchett estimated the project of moving the cluster to the first floor and the cost of the new furniture could total $200,000. 
The decision to change the location and look of the Library cluster was a "meeting of minds" between OIT and the Library, who thought the clus­ter was in a "tucked-away position," said Associate Director for User Services at the Hesburgh Library Nigel Butterwick. 
With the new location on the first floor, the cluster becomes "a more obvious environment," Butterwick said. 
"It also allows us to offer 

PPE 
basically from the same spot," Butterwick said. 
The Library has not yet determined what it will use the current cluster space for. 
Burchett called the new library cluster configuration a "pilot" program to see how stu­dents respond. 
The new furniture for the cluster, according to current blueprints, will accommodate 76 people. The current cluster can seat 67. 
The new space will also con­tain a self-contained presenta­tion area to allow students to practice with group members, Butterwick said. 
If the 10 laptops available for students to borrow from the Library prove to be inade­quate, Butterwick said, OIT can order more to fit the demonstrated student need. 
OIT intends to survey stu­dents to see how they like the new Library cluster, Burchett said. 
But Cope said OIT has not removed computers from any other OIT-supported computer clusters beside Mendoza and soon Hesburgh, and it will not make any changes to them until it gets student feedback from the two changed labs.

Suicide bombers hit marketplaces 
BAGHDAD -Five suicide bombers struck Shiite marketplaces in northeast Baghdad and a town north of the capital at nightfall Thursday, killing at least 122 people and wounding more than 150 in one oflraq's deadliest days in years. 
At least 178 people were killed or found dead Thursday, which marked the end of the seventh week of the latest U.S.-lraqi military drive to curtail violence in Baghdad and surrounding regions. 
The suicide bombers hit markets in the Shiite town of Khalis and the Shaab neighborhood in Baghdad during the busiest time of the day, tim­ing that has become a trademark of what are believed to be Sunni insurgent or al-Qaida sui­cide attackers. 
Three suicide vehicle bombs, including an explosives-packed ambulance, detonated in a market in Khalis, 50 miles north of the capital, which was especially crowded because govern­ment flour rations had just arrived for the first time in six months, local television stations reported. 
At least 43 people were killed and 86 wound­ed, police said. 
Police attack high school protesters 
SANTIAGO. Chile-Police on Thursday used tear gas and water cannons to disperse hun­dreds of rock-throwing high school students who repeatedly blocked traffic on Santiago's main avenue. 
The government said 159 students had been detained. 
The demonstrations came on a date often marked by violence by far-left groups commem­orating what they call "The Day of the Young Combatant," honoring two young brothers killed by police in a 1985 protest of the 1973-90 dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.

HOLLY, Colo. -A massive spring storm spawned dozens of tornadoes from the Rockies to the Plains, killing at least four peo­ple in three states, including a woman who was flung into a tree by a twister as wide as two football fields. 
Sixty-five tornadoes were reported late Wednesday in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Colorado and Nebraska, the National Weather Service said. By early Thursday, the storm system stretched from South Dakota to Texas.

NEW ORLEANS -The leader of the city's effort to recover from Hurricane Katrina unveiled a $1.1 billion plan Thursday aimed at jump-starting the sluggish revitalization work. 
The plan focuses on 17 zones throughout the city, from busy Canal Street to the hard­hit Lower 9th Ward, city recovery director Ed Blakely said. 
Mayor Ray Nagin called it part of "Phase One" of the city's recovery from Katrina, which devastated the city 19 months ago. 
The money would be used to give develop­ers loans and incentives for building in areas that the city has identified as key to its recov­ery.

House Democrats pass budget plan 
Republicans argue that plan would lead to unprecedented tax increases in 2012 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -House Democrats pushed their budget blueprint to passage Thursday, promising a big surplus in five years by allowing tax cuts passed in President Bush's first term to expire. 
The plan would award spending increases next year to both the Pentagon and domestic programs, but defers difficult deci­sions about unsustainable growth in federal benefit programs such as Medicare. 
The 216-210 vote sets up negotiations with the Senate, which last week passed a budget blueprint with spending increases similar to the House plan. The Senate plan would not generate surpluses since it assumes lawmakers will renew the most popular of the tax cuts due to expire at the end of 2010. 
Twelve Democrats, most­ly from GOP-leaning states such as Indiana, opposed the budget plan. 

Democrats said the $2.9 trillion plan for next year would point the way to a surplus after years of red ink under Bush and a GOP­controlled Congress. Republicans countered that that time. Republicans said subsequent bills affecting to $389 billion after a $153 billion surplus in increased spending now taxes and benefit programs accounting for extending 2012 would appear only if would put renewal of the such as Medicare, as well other tax cuts and adjust­tax cuts passed in 2001 and tax cuts at a disadvantage as the annual appropria­ing the alternative mini­2003 expire in four years when they are considered. tions bills. mum tax so it does not

Kaneb Center technology fair to showcase options 
BySONIARAO 
News Writer 
A new version of WebCT VIsta will be unveiled today at the John A. Kaneb Center for Teaching and Learning's "Technology in the Classroom" fair in the Jordan Hall of Science. 
Faculty members and teaching assistants who attend the exhibition will see examples of using technology in the classroom, with displays rang­ing from traditional PowerPoints to the more vanguard blogs and "Wilds." 
"The idea is to help faculty under­stand what kinds of technologies are available to help improve learning in the classroom," Assistant Director of the Kaneb Center Chris Clark said. "It's a showcase of the different tech­nologies that people might use." 
Though some professors and teach­ing assistants remain loyal to the tra­ditional chalkboard instead of a lap­top, Clark said the event is to promote technology only when it is relevant to the class. 
"Our purpose is not to use technolo­gy for the sake of technology," he said. "It's to integrate objectives.... If it would be useful for [faculty] to use a PowerPoint with images and videos and they're not doing that, then we would suggest it to them." 
He also noted that faculty members dealing with a visual subject matter could benefit greatly from the use of technology. 
"Taking slides and putting them on a computer makes things more effective for someone teaching something like Art History," he said. "It's the idea of having 100,000 slides on a laptop ver­sus 80 on a slide tray." 

Though visually inclined subjects could benefit from technology for obvi­ous reasons, Clark said there is not any one subject that benefits from the use of technology more than others. 
On the other hand, large classes tend to find WebCT useful for distrib­uting grades, which "helps students get feedback quickly," he said. 
Faculty members responsible for those large classes will notice that WebCT has had a makeover. Course Management Systems Administrator Laura Gekeler said the course man­agement system is getting an upgrade. 
"Pretty much the look and feel is changing," she said. "That includes navigations, so things are easier to use." 
Gekeler said faculty members will probably notice more changes than students, but everyone can notice that the system name will be changed from "WebCT" to "Concourse" on May 17. 
"We wanted to brand our course management system as being Notre Dame's course management system so the name won't be tied to the vendor as much," she said. Currently, Notre Dame's course management system reflects the vendor, WebCT. A demon­stration of Concourse will be part of the "Technology in the Classroom" event. 
The technology fair will take place at the north end of Jordan Hall's main atrium from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

Students walk for Darfur 
Dozens march toward Main Building to say prayers, sing 
By JENNIFER METZ 
News Writer 
About 60 students silently marched to the Main Building as the sun set Thursday night to raise awareness about the genocide occurring in Darfur. 
The march, coordinated by the Student Senate Social Concerns committee as part of Darfur Week, included prayers and readings led by anthropology professor Father Patrick Gaffney and songs sung by members of the Glee Club. 
The students were somber in their walk and struggled against the wind to keep their candles lit to serve as symbols of their effort and solidarity. 
Chris Meister, a freshman involved with the Social Concerns committee, was one of the organizers of the event. After he took a seminar on religious violence last semes­ter, Meister said he felt com­pelled to somehow get involved in ending genocide. He said a film shown in his seminar, "Hotel Rwanda," inspired him to participate in these efforts. 
'Til never forget ... in the movie they said, 'Once the Americans see the tragedy, they'll be sure to act.' And they didn't," Meister said. "The genocide is now in its f.tfth year and there's nothing being done. Something needs 

to get started ... this week · can help get things going 
here." 

The United Nations estimat­
ed March 13 that "200,000 
people have been killed and 
at least 2 million others 
forced from their homes since 
2003." 

The goal of the march, 
Meister said, was to raise 
awareness by incorporating 
what he called an important 
element in the stoppage of 
genocide -prayer. 
"We need to pray for these 
people to have the strength to 
go on," he said. "[Prayer] is a 
powerful message of aware­
ness." 

The participants held can­
dles and marched the straight 
path from Main Circle to the 
Main Building, where they 
formed a circle in front of the 
statue of Jesus. Meister said 
the candles were a visible 
symbol of the effort to stop 
the genocide in Darfur. 
Freshman Mary Daly 
marched for Darfur to sup­
port Meister, but also because 
of her involvement in Notre 
Dame Right to Life. 
"It is important to take into 
account all aspects of life ... 
to recognize the sanctity of 
life in all forms and places," 
Daly said. 

Gaflhey began the ceremo­
ny, calling the gathering "a 
gesture of solidarity" meant 
to recognize the suffering and 
mourning experienced daily by the millions affected by the Darfur genocide. 
"We need to try to stop this intractable problem and we express our solidarity by join­ing our minds and hearts together," Gaflhey said. 
Gaffney read aloud from Bible readings and also read a prayer from a Darfuri woman and a reading from Isaiah, which he said should remind listeners to think of the messages of Holy Week, which commences Sunday. 
Gaffney joined in the serv­ice because he said he has personally experienced these "sadly familiar problems" after living and working in Africa. 
"We hope to make others aware and give others the opportunity to help ... to show their concern, their anxiety about the situation and to show their hope for the future," Gaffney said. 
The circle of prayer gained members as the sun contin­ued to set and the voices grew louder in song. The Glee Club led participants in "Make Me a Channel of Your Peace" and "We Are Called." The club sang the closing song, "Prayer for the Children," which was fol­lowed by a recitation of the Lord's Prayer, during which participants held hands.

IN BRIEF 
U.S. awards largest telecom contract 
WASHINGTON -Dealing a significant blow to Sprint Nextel, the government on Thursday awarded the largest-ever federal telecommunica­tions contract-a 10-year deal worth up to $48 billion -to its rivals AT&T, Qwest Communications and Verizon. 
The three contract winners will split $525 mil­lion, but beyond that they will have to compete with each other for the business of dozens of fed­eral agencies needing to enhance the quality and security of voice, video and data technologies, the General Services Administration announced. 
Among the products federal agencies will choose from are Internet-based voice and video systems, wireless and satellite communications services and updated network infrastructure. 
Several major departments, including Homeland Security and Treasury, have already signed onto the contract, though no specific deals are anticipated before summer. 
While AT&T Inc., Qwest Communications International Inc. and Verizon Inc. gained an important and deep-pocketed client, the announcement was a serious loss to Sprint Nextel Corp., analysts said, not least because the Reston, Va.-based company has been providing telecom services to the federal government for nearly 20 years. 
Economy expected to remain slow 
WASHINGTON -After ending 2006 lethargi­cally, the economy is expected to remain sluggish most of this year as businesses and consumers cope with fallout from the painful housing slump. 
The broadest barometer of the country's eco­nomic health, gross domestic product, grew at a 
2.5 percent annual rate in the final three months of last year, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. 
It was a small improvement from the 2.2 per­cent pace previously estimated for the fourth quarter and a 2 percent growth rate logged in the third quarter. However, the new reading still marked a lackluster showing that reinforced economists' predictions for similarly listless activ­ity in the coming quarters. 
According to various projections, GDP growth will remain mediocre, hovering at around the 2 percent to 2.5 percent pace in the first haJJ of this year. In contrast, the economy's average, or trend, growth rate is closer to 3.25 percent.

NEW  YORK  - Stocks  
ended higher in volatile

This offset the Commerce

the two described how they have pushed for tangible results this year for the student body -results that they said disprove the stereotype of a do­nothing government. 
Shappell and Andrichik told The Observer in August they felt they came into the school year with a momentum that helped them start achieving goals immediately, including initiatives like adding more choices to Grab and Go and starting the College Readership Program to give students access to three major newspa­pers. 
And Shappell said that momentum -jumpstarted by their combined experience in student government -contin­ued throughout the school year. Of the 35 items on their platform, their administration achieved 32, Shappell said. 
"We've joked about it being a checklist," she said. "For us, that's really what it was." 
Their most important accom­plishment, they said, was the Student Union endowment they helped to create, which Shappell announced to the Senate Wednesday. The endow­ment -a fund composed of money from The Shirt project royalty fund and from student government's carry-forward account -will provide funding for future student bodies, Shappell said. She estimated more than $600,000 would be returned to the overall Student Union budget every year through the endowment fund. 
"We think this is the most fis­cally responsible thing to do 
administration the "golden year" of student government, a remark made at the Board's Student Affairs committee meeting in February. 
Last year, the Baron-Shappell platform sometimes had to "take a backseat" to emerging problems like the controversial ordinance amendment and the academic freedom-Catholic character debate. This year, Shappell said, she and Andrichik were fortunate that they could devote most of their time to achieving their plat­form's goals. 
But Shappell and Andrichik don't attribute their successes just to the lack of controversy. Everyone in the administration worked hard, Shappell said. 
For Shappell and Andrichik, that workload will be greatly diminished once president­elect Liz Brown and vice presi­dent-elect Maris Braun take over on Sunday. 
Forging strong relationships 
Shappell said the experience of leading the Student Union has been both "challenging and rewarding." 
"It's a very demanding posi­tion and it can be very chal­lenging at times ... but at the same time, I think you realize that's what you're signing up for and I wouldn't trade it," she said. 
One part of the job both lead­ers said they have enjoyed is the relationships they have forged with administrators like University President Father John Jenkins and Vice President for Student Affairs Father Mark Poorman. 
"It's really welcoming that it's more of a collegial relationship rather than students and administrators and sort of an assumed tension," Andrichik said. "I don't think there is an assumed tension in a lot of our interactions." 
Shappell and Andrichik, for­mer co-ree football teammates, said their relationship has grown during their tenure. Andrichik said his friendship with Shappell is the strongest bond he has made with some­one during his four years in student government. Shappell had similar sentiments. 
"It's been a pleasure to work with Bill and a lot of fun," Shappell said. "We've worked very hard, but it's been a great time." 
Shappell's and Andrichik's leadership duties won't end completely on Sunday. They will help Brown and Braun with transition and continue to lead the Campus Life Council until the end of the academic year, as well as present their spring report to the Board of Trustees. 
They won't be in the student government offices in LaFortune nearly as much, however. 
"The concept of free time, with no formal position, has been something alien to me in the last two or three years," Shappell said. "It's going to be nice to just relax and enjoy my few weeks before graduation." 
After graduation, Shappell is undecided about whether she will do service in Africa or take a job in Washington, D.C. Andrichik is confident his next step is law school and is still choosing where to go, with his 
top  three  choices  being  
Michigan,  Duke  or  Notre  
Dame.

with prom1smg academic achievements and encouraging them to take a look at the oppor­tunities Notre Dame has to offer them. 
"Of course, we're known for our Catholic identity, top tier aca­demics and athletics," Hardy said. "But Spring Viz -rather than show just the academic side of our University -gives these stu­dents a roundabout portrayal of the life here." 
This year's Spring VIsitation has brought promising students from across the country. And their backgrounds add an interesting dimension the Admissions com­mittee said could be a positive addition to the student body here. 
"Many are ... first-generation college students who ordinarily could not have the opportunity to travel to visit Notre Dame on their own," Carrillo said. "They come from all sorts of socioeconomic, multicultural and religious set­tings." 
As a result, the Undergraduate Admissions Committee sponsors with the money," Shappell said.

The first occurs in late February, which is much smaller and designated pri­marily for minority students admitted under the University's non-binding Early Action pro­gram. 
This weekend's event not only is much larger but also features many prospects who have not received official acceptance let­ters to the University yet. 
"We merely congratulate them on their academic qualifications in the invitation letters they receive to attend Spring Viz," Carrillo said. 
After arriving on campus Thursday, the prospects attended a brief introduction session and meet their student hosts. They will be greeted today by Dan Saracino, assistant provost for enrollment, to congratulate them on their qualifications within the highly competitive applicant pool for admissions. 
Afterwards, Hugh Page, dean of the First Year of Studies, will pro­vide information about the aca-

them superior health care and stock options, even for those who well less than 40 hours a week. 
Schultz said his dedication to his company's employees grew out of his early childhood expe­riences. 
While Schultz was growing up in a housing project in Brooklyn, New York, his family suffered when his father was injured on the job and received no benefits or workers' com­pensation. Schultz said these memories made him committed to providing health care to his employees. 
He encouraged the audience to take an active role in trying to change government policy, saying the nation's status with 47 million Americans unin­sured is "fracturing the humanity of America." 
He also reminded future entrepreneurs of what he believes to be the most impor­tant discipline in any business 
"The corresponding part of that is by continuing to listen to students and trying to serve their interests and represent them." 
Andrichik said he felt a 
"sense of accomplishment" from the initia­tives they start­
demic environment at Notre Dame. Students will then have the opportunity to attend a facul­ty-staff luncheon to acquaint themselves with representatives from the academic departments that interest them. 
A false impression of diversity? 
Weekend activities will also be abundant for the prospects, with the opening of La Alianza's Latin Expressions today and the Fashion Show from the Black Cultural Arts Council (BCAC) Saturday. 
The variety of on-campus events will provide a packed weekend for these prospects. But some have criticized Spring VIsitation recently for displaying a false impression of diversity at Notre Dame by hosting these stu­dents on a weekend when there simply happens to be cultural events on campus. 
In a column that appeared in the Viewpoint section of The Observer Feb. 26, senior Will McAuliffe, an Observer columnist, expressed this view regarding his impressions after leaving a Voices of Faith concert when he was a prospect. 
"Once the doors opened, the reality of Notre Dame set back in," McAuliffe wrote. "Despite the genuine efforts of the administra­tion, this University is not diverse." 
In response to this allegation, the Admissions team -though they acknowledged that multicul­tural events like Latin Expressions don't occur every weekend -said they are not using these shows to deceive prospects. 
"Rather, they are showcases ­not just for our prospects but for our community as a whole," Carrillo said. "Part of the hosting process is honest, and the stu­dents will experience for them­selves what Notre Dame is really about-good or bad." 
The undergraduate Admissions committee neither sponsors nor produces these shows, but simply encourages the prospects to attend. 
"This weekend is no different from any other weekend," Hardy said. "We're aware that the BCAC Fashion Show is not every week­end, just like the Keenan Revue isn't every weekend, either. And students who apply here are aware that we are a predomi­nantly white institution, but we're not trying to hide that." 
First impressions 

The prospects, who arrived Thursday, said they were impressed by other factors that they hadn't considered. For Tsz Wong, a senior from Brooklyn, New York, the chance to escape the city was "incredible." 
"The first thing I noticed was the Golden Dome, which wasn't surrounded by clusters of apart­ment complexes," she said. "The campus is so beautiful." 
The opportunity to visit the campus may make Notre Dame a higher contender on the prospect's list of college choices. Since it is a free ride, some sen­iors choose to capitalize on this opportunity to learn more about the institution. 
"My family and I were so excit­ed about the visitation and now Notre Dame has definitely become one of my top choices," said Brandi Rodriguez, a senior from San Antonio. "Still, it's all up to financial aid, but I can't wait to see what else to explore here."

-huma,n resources. While human resources is usually the last division of a company to be funded, it is important that "people feel as if they are a part of something larger than themselves," Schultz said, adding that human resources is the easiest way to connect them. 
The second most important discipline after human resources, Schultz said, is cor­porate social responsibility ­and not simply making charita­ble donations as a marketing gimmick, but also having an entire program devoted to a company's ethical practices. 
More and more consumers are asking serious questions of companies about how they treat the people overseas who manufacture goods or sell com­panies raw materials, Schultz said. He said Starbucks is com­mitted to improving the quality of life of the farmers from whom they buy their coffee beans. 
He said Starbucks purchases more Fair Trade coffee than any other company and consis­tently pays above market value for their beans. Schultz admit­ted that doing the right thing for the company's employees has been difficult at times. But he said he would rather see a slight loss in the short-term and maintain Starbucks' ethi­cal commitment to its partners. 
He finished his speech with a reminder to young entrepre­neurs never to forsake their dreams, saying his own success could not have been predicted based on his early life.

Summit promotes peace 
Kroc conference to encourage diplomatic negotiations, dialogue 
By KATIE PERALTA News Writer 

The goal of this week­end's 15th annual Student Peace Conference is to reach peace through understanding, the event co-organizers said. 
Senior Claire McArdle, a peace studies major who co-organized the event with fellow senior peace studies major Katie Mounts, said the goal of this conference is to "focus on the other." 
"We create our identi­ties by saying what we are not," she said. 
This abstract concept centralizes around the idea of understanding, which McArdle and Mounts said they believe leads directly to conflict resolution. 
The conference, spon­sored and funded by the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies and organized by undergraduate peace studies students, hopes to attract not only peace studies majors but also undergraduate students from other areas of study as well as members of the South Bend community to focus on conflict resolu­tion and understanding. 
In a world filled with conflict and disagree­ment, McArdle and Mounts said they believe peaceful negotiation often gets pushed to the back burner and that nations turn to war as a means of solving problems. The goal of this conference and others like it, they said, is to explore the con­cept of understanding, a more peaceful and rea­sonable means of resolv­ing issues. 
Organizers said that societies around the world are divided socially, politi­cally, geographically and religiously, and people tend to define themselves by what they're not. 
For example, the differ­ences between Muslim and Christian religions are further accentuated by the lack of knowledge and understanding of members of each respec­tive group. These differ­ences, McArdle said, are not necessarily caused by racism, but more by a lack of understanding, so that bridging the cultural gap is a lot harder. 
"Understanding leads to dialogue," McArdle said. Dialogue is conducive to peace, she said, which is key in conflict resolution. 
Organizers of the con­ference have put together a variety of presentations and activities for the weekend. Tonight, confer­ence participants can experience an African dinner, a traditional Kenyan storytelling and a performance by the Notre Dame Irish Dance troupe. 
On Saturday, keynote speaker Jill Sternberg will discuss her work in con­flict resolution and nonvi­olence. Sternberg, a mem­ber of one of the first classes to earn a Masters in peace studies from the Kroc Institute, has been facilitating the election process in East Timor and will speak of her experi­ence there as well. 
Several panel discus­sions and peace-building workshops will follow Sternberg's speech. 
Both Mounts and McArdle were involved in the in conference previous years, and Mounts said she was excited to be an organizer. 
"It is a great way to get involved with the work of the Kroc Institute, which has recently risen nation­ally and internationally," she said. "It's also a great way to interact with facul­ty outside of the class­room." 
McArdle echoed this enthusiasm, calling the conference "a great way to get to know other peace studies majors and share with our peers things going on outside of the classroom." 
Mounts and McArdle expect around 150 partic­ipants this year, which includes both internation­al and Notre Dame stu­dents. Although registra­tion for meals closed March 23, anyone inter­ested in the conference can still show up for activities tonight and Saturday night.

this Saturday to benefit Young Life, a local non­denominational youth organization. 
Members of Young Life will also be participating in the walk, said organiz­er Rocky Krivda. 
Krivda, a Saint Mary's junior, has been involved in Young Life since her freshman year. 
"Young Life is so unique because we go into public high schools and we talk to kids who really need help -kids who don't necessarily get the opportunity to hear about ministry," Krivda said. 
The organization has clubs at nine high schools in the South 
Bend area including Adams, Clay, Penn and Riley High Schools, she said. 
The walk is being organized to send inner city South Bend teens, mostly members of the "Westside Club," to the summer camp coordinated by Young Life. 
"We basically become their big brother or big sister," Krivda said. "We meet their needs. And right now we're trying to send them to camp."

"Even showing up and buying a T-shirt will make a world of differ­ence in these kids lives," she said. 
Krivda is the main organizer but said Notre Dame sophomore Robbie Bernardin has also played a large part. 
"Rocky did most of the work,'' Bernadin said. ''I'm just keeping time." 
Bernardin, who has been involved with Young Life for a year, will be at the finish line 
taking down the times of the runners and walkers. He won't be able to attend summer camp this year, but hopes to go next summer. For him, Young Life is about hanging out with the high school students and being a friend. 
"It's a great thing," he said.

and that individuals made a difference in those changes," said professor George Lopez of the Notre Dame Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, pointing out that the world, from Second Vatican Council to the Civil Rights Movement, was in con­stant flux -Notre Dame stu­dents included. 
Those fervent protests and strikes in America even attracted the attention of stu­dents across the ocean, most notably French ones, in 1968. 
"The American protests were really a point of refer­ence for many student move­ments in France, especially for the anti-racism, anti-femi­nist movements," said Olivier Morel, an adjunct French instructor who was born in France and lived there until 18 months ago. 
Despite the influence of young Americans in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Lopez thinks they were a bit "big­headed." 
"The truth is," he said, "that individuals probably made less of a difference than they thought they did. I think this current generation has a more balanced and maybe realistic view of how much change individuals can bring." 
For Notre Dame students now, he said, the war in Iraq seems like an inaccessible conflict. Far fewer Notre Dame students have connec­tions to those serving in Iraq 
than at other local institu­tions like Ball State University and Indiana University, he said, where many students join the National Guard and serve time in order to finance their educations. 
"The days of turning 600,000 people out for marches on Washington and campuses that are protesting -that doesn't go anymore. Those days are gone," he said. "I have some friends who think you can recreate that, or that the war will end once we recreate that. But I don't think that's the direc­tion among college students." 
Rather, Lopez said, students are turning to local charity efforts in a "think globally, act locally" mindset. 
"They look for a strategic situation where they can actually have an effect," he said. 
But Michael Shaughnessy, who graduated from Notre Dame in 1971 and was active in the Vietnam War protests on campus, thinks older methods can still be effective for the war in Iraq. Shaughnessy, a high school theology teacher in San Francisco, participates in marches, sit-ins and letter­writing campaigns in town. He's worried about Notre Dame students. 
"Oftentimes working for jus­tice is controversial," he said, "and I think many students at Notre Dame [in the late '60s and early '70s], and from what I read, now, too, are more concerned about job resumes than changing the world." 
Aaron Kreider agrees that Notre Dame students can do 
more when it comes to activism. He felt so strongly about that as a graduate stu­dent here in 1998 that he founded the Progressive Student Alliance (PSA), which earned official club status from the University that same year. Since earning his mas­ter's degree in sociology in 2002, he has founded a Web site called campusactivism.org -a mas­sive networking site for activists that he compared to myspace.com and friendster.com. 
While Shaughnessy laments the lack of student action in international issues, Kreider identifies problems right on campus that Notre Dame stu­
dents  should  address.  He  
wrote  a  handbook entitled  
"The  Notre  Dame  

Disorientation Manual: A Guide to What's Really Going On," targeting issues from heterosexism to militarism to the heavy influence corpora­tions hold over Notre Dame, especially its Board of Trustees. The manual is linked to eampusactivism.org. 
"Activism should be strong on a college campus because it's a community. It's impor­tant for all communities to have people who believe in progressive soeial change, in making their community a better place, a place that is more just and more loving," Kreider said. "At Notre Dame, activism is weaker than at your typical nationally ranked top university." 
But groups like Students for Environmental Action, Circle K, PSA, Amnesty International, CLAP, the Africa Faith and Justice

Chikai Ohazama, a Google Inc. product manager for satellite imagery, said the maps now avail­able are the best the company can offer. Numerous factors decide what goes into the databases, "everything from resolution, to quality, to when the actual imagery was acquired." 
He said he was not sure when the current images replaced views of the city taken after Katrina struck Aug. 29, 2005, flooding an estimated 80 percent of New Orleans.

speak for themselves? 

"I don't see [today's stu­dents] as any less active than prior generations of Notre Dame students, or students who mobilized protests in the last big war, like the Vietnam War," Lopez said. "People are more levelheaded, and may be more judicious about the use of their own time."

Former state senator accused of ·corruption 
Associated Press 
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -A former state senator and three other people were charged with corruption Thursday in a highly politi­cized case that a former fed­eral prosecutor told Congress he believes led to his firing. 
A federal grand jury accused former New Mexico Senate President Pro Tern Manny Aragon and the others of conspiring to skim $4.2 million in public funds meant for construction of a county courthouse. 
David Iglesias, one of eight 

U.S. attorneys fired late last year, told Congress this month that he rejected what he believed to be pressure from U.S. Sen. Pete Domenici and U.S. Rep. Heather Wilson, New Mexico Republicans, to rush the indictments, which would have hurt Democrats in the November elections. 
Spokesmen for Domenici and Wilson, who was in a hotly contested race at the time, said Thursday they would have no comment on the indictments. 
The firing of Iglesias and the other prosecutors has blown up into a scandal that has spawned calls for the res­ignation of U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathon Gerson in Albuquerque said the 26­count indictment handed up Thursday stemmed from an investigation that has lasted more than a year. 
"We handled this as we would have handled any other case," Gerson said. "We han­died this matter professional­ly without attention being paid to outside influence." 
Charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and money laun­dering Thursday were Aragon; former metro court administrator Toby Martinez; Raul Parra, a partner in Albuquerque engineering firm P2RS; and software con­sultant Sandra Mata Martinez, Toby Martinez's wife. 
Architect Marc Schiff; for­mer Albuquerque Mayor Ken Schultz, who was a lobbyist for Schiff's firm; and subcon­tractor Manuel Guara have pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of mail fraud. Their plea agree­
ments were  unsealed  
Thursday.  
Aragon,  Parra and  the  

Martinezes conspired to sub­mit and approve false invoic­es for payment and to make excessive requests for pay­ment, the grand jury alleged. The Martinezes received about $2 million and Aragon $700,000 from the fraud, the indictment said. 
Aragon did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Messages also were left for attorneys representing Parra and the Martinezes. 
Prosecutors allege Schultz took cash payments from Schiff and passed some of the money to Toby Martinez, who approved inflated invoices. Schultz's attorney, Peter Schoenburg, noted that his client has cooperated with investigators. 
"I think he regrets his actions very much," Schoenburg said. 



PETA calls for food recall 
Animal rights organization says dry food causes pet illn~sses 
Associated Press 

RICHMOND, Va. -Animal rights advocates are calling on federal food safety regulators and pet food companies to expand a nationwide recall of dog and cat food to include dry varieties, claiming it makes pets sick. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Thursday it had no plans to suggest a wider recall to pet food compa­nies, and veterinarians said they have not seen a trend of animals becoming ill after eat­ing dry pet food. 
The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals plans to make the appeal Friday in Washington after it said it received complaints from pet owners who claim their ani­mals suffered kidney failure after eating dry pet food. 
Norfolk, Va.-based PETA wants the FDA and the compa­nies to extend the recall to foods that have received com­plaints, chemically test it and perform necropsies on the ani­mals involved. It also wants companies prosecuted if the FDA's probe turns up wrongdo­ing. 
FDA spokeswoman Julie Zawisza said she did not know how many of the more than 7,000 complaints the agency has received have concerned dry pet food. The FDA plans to release preliminary results from its investigation into the recall Friday. 
Officials at Ontario, Canada­based Menu Foods, which made the recalled pet food, did not immediately return a call seeking comment. 
Nearly 100 brands of pet food were recalled after ani­mals suffered kidney failure. The recall involved "cuts and gravy" style dog and cat food. The recall covered products carrying names of major brands including lams, Nutro and Eukanuba. 
New York state's food labora­tory last week identified aminopterin as the likely cul­prit in the recall. Aminopterin is a derivative of folic acid that was once used to induce abor­tions and is now banned as a rodent poison in the United States. It can cause kidney damage in dogs and cats. 
Veterinarians aren't seeing a trend of pets getting sick off dry food, said Paul Pion, founder of the Veterinarian Information Network. He said since so many people use dry food, you would expect to see many more ill pets if the food was tainted.

With nearly 1 million Catholics and holdings throughout San Diego County, the diocese here is by far the largest and, by all accounts, the wealthiest of the five U.S. dioceses to have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy under the shadow of civil claims over sexual abuse.

The life of Catholic culture 
Any hack may write of the death of Catholic culture in a newspaper col­umn, because it is in the papers that obituaries appear. It is more difficult and embarrassing to speak of the life of something still liv­ing. Death is for the James broadsheets, life for Matthew the narrow intimacy Wilson of the confessional. 
The Treasonous

In our climate, 
Clerk

people confess end­lessly, but nobody goes to Confession. We divulge our sor­did affairs in public, conforming our­selves to the form of spectacle, whereas the only justinable reason to recount one's history is if one can form it into a story, giving it a structure that leads to edification and change. With some reluctance, I wish to recount part of my own life in the tentative twilight of a Catholic culture and then offer a few lessons derived from it. 
Like many children born into a Catholic family during the last decades, I was raised in a prosperous suburb and attended Catholic elementary school. Before school each morning, all students attended Mass. The statue of the Virgin Mary, trampling the serpent under her bare foot, stood in every classroom. She arrested my imagina­tion, because she seemed the most beautiful woman in the world, and because the crushing of the serpent seemed such a dramatic symbol of the conflict of Good against Evil. 
The moral dilemmas of privileged children run -or at least ran -along fairly simple lines, and I had no difficul­ty interpreting the world through the basic catechesis we received in religion class. Everyone I knew was Catholic, except for the kids in my neighborhood; I recall being puzzled by my best friend and neighbor's Lutheranism. Once, after learning about the Reformation 
and the anti-Catholicism pervasive in American history, I sat in Mass day­dreaming of becoming a Crusader to protect St. Thomas Aquinas Parish from the invasions of the ... Puritans? 
My parents were active in the Parish and exemplified the practices of devo­tion to the Church in myriad ways, from my dad's visiting the inmates of a nurs­ing home every Sunday, to my mom's running the inevitable "religious goods" shop in the coffee bar at Church. So long as I was in Catholic school, their actions reinforced what I learned in the classroom, and what I studied in school articulated -often in awe-striking for­mulae -the atmosphere through which I moved. 
After the fifth-grade, I transferred to public school. There, the behavior of the students shocked my sensibility, and at first I had no difficulty critiquing their acts and language in light of the moral formation I had already received. My parents' examples of devotion and charity did not necessarily wane, but since they did not actively explain the meaning of their actions, they became in a sense unintelligible to me. In the meantime, the deeds of my classmates became perfectly comprehensible, and I was soon fluent in the vocabulary of juvenile venery and of that adolescent concept of rights, freedom, and indul­gence taught not in schools, but during the afternoon hours of 3 to 6 in the latch-key world of broken homes. 
Near the end of my high school years, I recall walking home past St. Thomas one autumn afternoon. I thought, "What I do and what is right is between me and God, and it's not for anyone to judge." Desire for a God in which I had once believed lingered, though I more or less believed the world a chaos of objects and options that I might choose without consequence. I had reconfig­ured that desire so it would not stand in 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Catholic Workers' protest justified 
Many ask if the Catholic Worker movement have the right to speak out against the injustices of our world? The movement is more than an organization that "does good work with the poor and oppressed" but participates in "needless and unproductive protests," such as the prayerful demonstration that occurred Monday. 
The Catholic Worker movement was founded by Dorothy Day, who spent portions of her life impris­oned for her radical call for love in the world. Can we claim the Catholic Workers violated their "appropriate place within the Church" when Day, the most influ­ential person for the Catholic Workers, protested and even criti­cized the Church at times? 
Notre Dame has an influential voice for the Church in America. It is important that Notre Dame's stat­ed Catholic values agree with the programs they support. The pres­ence of an ROTC program on cam­pus, although may not directly sup­port "any war that the United States enters into," does support war by providing the military with well-trained leaders. 
John Kenneth Galbraith claims, "There remains the need to counter the presumption by the military power that war is an inevitable aspect of human existence." Simply because war is the easiest solution does not mean it is innate to human existence. Peace takes courage and love of enemies, both ideals Notre Dame upholds. 
The Catholic Workers have a right and duty to protest at Notre Dame. Unlike many, they care about others whether or not "they are affected at all by there being an ROTC program here." The Workers' concern for others implies a radical love about issues that do not directly affect them because their radical mission is to love their enemies. 
The Catholic Workers, although not always favored by the Church, have been a voice of Jesus' mes­sage to love our enemies. The Catholic Workers have every right to remind Notre Dame of their duty to not support ROTC, which sup­ports war. 
Was the Catholic Workers' demonstration "needless and unproductive?" We may say that their prayer and demonstration may never change anything, but when has anything but a small group of committed individuals ever changed anything?

the way of those choices. 
Nothing contested that configuration until I encountered two things in col­lege. First, I intuited that the student culture in Ann Arbor was at once liber­tine and careerist, an amoral desire for success confirming an amoral hedonis­tic nocturne. Second, for some reason, I signed up for a class on Dante. Reading the "Divine Comedy" brought me into a world at once familiar and foreign. More importantly, what was "foreign" about the poem seemed as if it should be native to me, as if it were not just another world, but a worldview to which I belonged. 
I loved the Catholic world of Dante but could not believe in it at the expense of the college world of hedo­nism. One Sunday, suspecting at last I had become an atheist, I decided to test the hypothesis by going to Mass at St. Thomas the Apostle (Doubting Thomas) Church. At Communion, I approached the altar, prepared to receive my unbe­lief like a seal. When the bread and wine touched my tongue, I received rather my belief as a sacrament. 
From that moment, I was once again a Catholic in mind and heart, but also in isolation. My life in the Church entailed solitude at Mass and the pri­vate devouring of theology and devo­tional books in my bedroom. It was life in the "upper room" not "on the mount." 
What conclusions have I drawn from experience? Mostly obvious ones, I am afraid. We must reverse at whatever cost the waning of Catholic schools. Every priest at the pulpit and every half-devoted Catholic should feel obliged to exhort parents to enroll their children in a school where they will learn the meaning of the sacraments. 
There is much bad theology in the Church and it flows more easily into the lives of relatively unschooled Christians than the good, because it resembles more closely the pagan culture in which we live. The pious and the intellectual should feel obliged not only to support Catholics schools financially and to enroll their children, but also to work or volunteer there. Even if one has no children, one has at present this responsibility. 
Following John Paul II, parents must learn to make intelligible the meaning of Catholic doctrine and practice to children whose everyday lives may not have a vocabulary to express the divine, or any self-transcendence save that of consumer gluttony. We all must do this -without bowdlerizing that .practice into the alternative consumerism of "spirituality." 
Catholicism is an inherently commu­nal religion, meant to extend as wide as civilization itself. And so Catholics will always struggle when they constitute a minority religion in a pagan society. And yet struggle we must, for the time being, to be a mark of contradiction. Even those of us consigned to the sub­urbs must strive against the individual­ist insularity they encourage. On this score, we will perhaps have succeeded when Saints' feast day festivals fill our suburban streets as they once did the ethnic neighborhoods of our cities, and when we once more chart our calendar not in terms of wage-slave weekdays and weekends, but in terms of the feasts of those martyrs who suffered that our everyday lives might be as filled with symbol and meaning as their own deaths.

Greater complexity to 1 honorable' Moses 
After reading the response to "First Down Moses underlies negative attitudes about other religions" by Xavier Lebac ("Moses was an honorable man," March 29) by Nick Bloom, it seems to me that Bloom did a fan­tastic job of proving Lebac's point that per­haps the roots of the Judea-Christian tradi­tion are not as peaceful and understanding as many claim. 
I believe that the stories of conquest and genocide in the Bible are deeply troubling for modern readers. Any narrative in which every man, woman, and child of a population is systematically exterminated, such as the account of the "sacred ban" in Jericho, can­not be anything but disturbing to contempo­rary readers who have no other knowledge about the Bible. These stories also may seem confusing and contradictory to modern read­ers who have read the Decalogue, where it clearly states that killing is forbidden. 
Still, even with the historical background and knowledge of the authors' purpose for writing their narratives, the fact that mass killing is praised and glorified appears to be counterintuitive to a just and forgiving God and highly reflective of a "jealous" deity. 
In addition, Bloom's assertion that it would be "incredibly foolish" to assume that any god would condone the worship of other gods is completely misguided and indeed ethno­centric. Primarily his strong doubt that the "god" of Buddhism would condone the wor­ship of Jesus is incredibly ludicrous consider­ing the fact that Buddhism is a non-theistic religion, meaning it does not have a deity. This indictment shows the lack of under­standing and ignorance that perpetuates such violent acts "in the name of God." Also, I can think of several religions including Taoism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and yes-even mod­ern-day Catholicism that do not condemn the worship by other religions. In the Second Vatican Council, it was written that "the Catholic Church rejects nothing of what is true and holy in [other] religions. She has a high regard for the manner of life and con­duct, the precepts and doctrines which, although differing in many ways from her own teaching, nevertheless often reflect a ray of that truth which enlightens all men." 
In light of this holy new way of thought, why do we have on the Notre Dame campus a testament to the abolishment of other reli­gions? How can we not draw parallels between the Crusades and modern Islamic Jihad? Those religions that are founded in Old Testament scripture (Judaism, Islam, Christianity) all believe in some form of "just violence." Our ideals are founded in the same literature of those who attack us. I believe what Lebec was trying to assert was the fact that even though we pride ourselves on being "civilized" and "reasonable," our religion too at one time has shed innocent blood in the name of the Almighty. Even though the Church has shifted to a new way of thinking (Vatican Two), many are stuck in the dark ages.

DVD REVIEWS 

Italian Stallion back for final round on DVD 
By BRIAN DOXTADER Senior Scene Writer 

"Rocky Balboa" is supposed to be the end of the line for the Italian Stallion, but it's easy to get the sense that the movie gives writer-director Sylvester Stallone a new beginning -after all, he can now follow it up with "Rocky Balboa II," which sounds a lot less geriatric than "Rocky VII." 
Actually. though, critical reception to 
. "Rocky Balboa" was surprisingly warm, but that's probably because the film isn't a complete disaster. Shot with lip service to the grittiness and charm of the original, "Rocky Balboa" is a superfluous sequel. While it does get things back on track after the proverbial train wreck that was "Rocky V," it doesn't really stand on its own as a film. 
Stallone's latest is essentially a glorified "thank you" to the legions of Rocky fans who stood by the Italian Stallion as he got married, became the heavyweight champ, had a kid, fought Mr. T, lost Mickey, trained with Apollo, lost Apollo, went to Russia, got brain damage and trained Tommy Gunn. At least half these things are thrown by the 
Rocky Balboa 
MGM 



wayside in "Rocky Balboa," a film that revisits several old set pieces, including the skating rink from the first picture. 
The film is about Rocky Balboa, former heavyweight champion turned restaurant owner, who comes out of retirement to engage in an exhibition match against cur­rent champ Mason "The line" Dixon. While this might sound like the stuff of parody, Stallone reaches deep into his sentimental pockets and pulls out a picture that isn't nearly as cloying or coldly calculating as it could be -in fact, there are scenes of gen­uine warmth, even without the presence of girlfriend/wife Adrian, who was often the convenient emotional anchor for previous "Rocky" pies. 
"Rocky Balboa" is well shot and well directed, though Stallone chews a lot of scenery. Balboa was always talkative, but he was never this loquacious. "Rocky Balboa" might have more words than any other "Rocky" film, but never before have they added up to less, and all of the long­winded monologues are enough to make audiences long for the days of, "Adrian, I never asked you to stop being a woman. Don't ask me to stop being a man." 
The DVD is passable, though not nearly the quality of MGM's two-disc special edi­tion for the original film. It includes an audio commentary by Stallone, who is always intelligent and well spoken (he did, after all, write all of the "Rocky" films). There are also deleted scenes that include an alternate ending, though the ending that was ultimately ehosen seems to be the most appropriate. 


finally. there are three documentaries ­"Skill vs. Will: The Making of Rocky Balboa," "Heality in the Ring: Filming Hocky's Final Fight" and "Virtual Champion: Creating the Computer Fight." Of these, only the first is really substantial, and the third, which talks about an in-film computer fight depicting an ESPN special featuring Balboa vs. Dixon, is rather fluffy. 
There was never a need for "Rocky Balboa," but if Stallone was intent on mak­ing it, he could've done a lot worse. There is quite a bit to admire, and. for "Rocky" enthusiasts, a lot to love. Comparing "Rocky Balboa" to the original "Hocky" shows just how far the franchise has strayed from its humble beginnings; but this latest (and hopefully last} sequel brings back some of the 1976 Best Picture Winner's charm. 
Best of all, it's enough to make viewers forget about "Rocky V," which is itself a minor miracle and something to be thank­ful for.

Animated musical a spectacle of light and sound 
time sentiment. If you listen carefully, you can catch snippets of songs both old and new from a slew different genres. All the jumping, jiving and wailing of the tuxedo­clad penguins milling around brings to mind the chaotic choreography of a Broadway musical. 
The vocal cast of "Happy Feet" is just awesome. Old pro Robin Williams is hilari­ous in his three narrator roles. He's also hilarious as Ramon, the leader of a pack of smaller (and apparently Mexican} tail-chas­ing penguins who befriend young Mumble. He also excels as Lovelace, a wisened pen­guin guru who doubles as a minister of soul and a penguin pimp, replete with his own brothel of lovely flippered ladies. 
Hugh Jackman stars as Memphis, Mumble's somewhat-less-than proud papa. Much like Donner, the reindeer father of Rudolph, Memphis is ashamed of his son's unique talents and wants him to blend into the status quo. Delivering his lines with an Elvis drawl, Jackman is perfect at adding flavor to his character. 
It should also be mentioned that Brittany Murphy scintillates as Gloria, Mumble's love interest. At times sexy and sweet, Murphy brings a lot to the role and show­cases some genuine pipes during the film's frequent and endearing musical numbers.

By TAE ANDREWS Scene Editor 

This emperor penguin marches to his own tune. "Happy Feet" follows the story of Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood}, a tap­happy tike in a tuxedo suit. After his father Memphis (Hugh Jackman} drops him as an egg, Mumble emerges from his shell as a bouncing baby penguin with a snazzy spring to his step. 
Bitten by the jitterbug at birth, Mumble can dance circles around the other baby penguins. Unfortunately for Mumble, all that fancy footwork is of no use as he searches to find his own Heartsong to express himself and vie for the affections of the lovely Gloria (Brittany Murphy}. Not only can young Mumble not carry a tune ­his voice sounds like the noise of a dying giraffe. His off-key crooning makes it hard for Mumble to harmonize with the rest of the Emperor penguin clan. As a result, Mumble strikes out on his own in order to make his voice heard. 
Basically, "Happy Feet" is a jazzed-up version of "March of the Penguins," or maybe "March of the Penguins: The Musical." The film's many rimsical num­bers combine a modern flair with a show-cut the plastic linings of six-packs so you don't choke any harmless penguins. 


Like the best animated films, "Happy Feet" has something for everyone. As fun family fare, the film pairs kid gags with jokes designed to sail clear over the heads of the children in the audience and land squarely on the adults' sense of humor, such as a series of thinly veiled mating ref­erences. 
If you haven't seen "Happy Feet" yet, know this: imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. In fact, the film's popularity spawned a popular YouTube video of "Happy Feet," in which the penguins boogey down and "walk it out" to the bumping beats of OJ Unk's hip-hop beat by the same name. 
Splendidly rendered, the animation of "Happy Feet" is nothing short of breathtak­ing as the camera leaps, zooms and soars over the gorgeous CCI landscape of Antarctica. The musical numbers and med­leys are also some of the best animated pieces done in a while. 
"Happy Feet" is a spectacle of light, sound and, most importantly, story. With great characters, comedy and a whole lot of penguins, the movie is a resounding hit. That's no small feat.

DVD REVIEW 
'Green Mile' shines in deluxe special edition 
Michael Clarke Duncan (center) stars with Tom Hank (left) in Frank Darabont's "The Green Mile," which has been released in a special edition. 
By RAMA GOTTUMUKKALA 
Senior Staff Writer 
Director Frank Darabont has made not one, but two great Stephen King prison dra­mas. His first, "The Shawshank Redemption," was the proverbial little movie that could. The novella that inspired the 1994 film was far more slender than King's usual work -one that was light on pages but big on heart. 
When the film adaptation was released, it opened softly and exited the Oscars without a peep, failing to win on any of its seven nomi­nations, including Best Picture. Today, it ranks as one of our fondest memories of 1990s cinema, a wonderfully humanistic film with a legend that has grown from its grass­roots beginnings to epic proportions. 
Darabont's second effort, "The Green Mile," debuted six years later with far greater fanfare and a stellar cast anchored by Tom Hanks. This time, Darabont, who wrote the screenplay for both films, whittled King's mammoth 400-page tome down until he ended with a 188-minute picture. It seemed tailor-made for Oscar gold, and again it was nominated for Best Picture. 

movie looks and sounds great, while leaving more room for the won­derful collection of spe­cial features. 
The movie is accom­panied by an audio commentary from Darabont, an essential feature absent from the previous DVD. On the Once more, it failed to win. To some, this may be a disappointment. But more than seven years after its Dec. 10, 1999 release, it remains an instant classic. 

Set in 1935, the film drops us down at the Cold Mountain Correctional Facility. We spend much of the film indoors with the prison guards and their wards, all inmates on death row for vicious, often murderous, crimes. The guards are led by Paul Edgecomb (Hanks). He is a kind but firm man who treats the inmates with respect, and expects the same in return. But the arrival of John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a seemingly gentle giant accused of a heinous crime, irrevocably changes the lives of Edgecomb and the other convicts. 
Warner Bros. has done the film a great service with the recent release of a bountiful two-disc special edition. It comes on the heels of a similarly expansive two-disc edi­tion of "The Shawshank Redemption." Both DVDs far outstrip the bare one-disc editions that sat on store shelves for far too long. 
The wisest choice made by the DVD pro­ducers was splitting the film over two discs. By not squishing more than three hours of film onto one disc, this DVD improves upon the first release's solid but unspectacular

track, Darabont gingerly admits his reluc­tance to record commentaries for his films, saying it keeps the "magic of the movies" intact with such discretion. Fortunately, he doesn't hold back here and delivers a won­derful commentary that touches upon all aspects of the film's production. Tidbits include how the crew made Duncan appear a foot taller than anyone else in the film and the special effects used to aid Mr. Jingles in his efforts. 
Additionally, the second disc houses an excellent six-part documentary called "Miracles and Mystery: Creating The Green Mile." Clocking in at over 90 minutes, it digs even deeper into the film's cinematography, casting, sets, costumes and virtually every part of its production. 
Alive with deep, soulful characters, "The Green Mile" ambles through its considerable runtime with care and grace. Warm, affec­tionate, poignant and moving, it is a worthy spiritual sequel to "Shawshank." Like a younger sibling, it seems content to live in the shadow of the earlier film. But "Green Mile" once again proved that Darabont is one of the few filmmakers with the patience, com­petence and vision to bring King's richly detailed worlds to life.

I'm not afraid to admit it -I like Disney movies. I mean, really like Disney movies. In fact, not just Disney, but animated movies in general appeal to me more than any live-action movies I have seen in years. Pixar, Dreamworks and even Warner Bros. ventures such as "Happy Feet" tick­le me in a way that has me saying, "Oh yeah, that's nice." 
It's not really that I dislike seeing real people acting on camera. I liked "The Departed" as much as the next guy. That one scene where Leo totally works that guy over in the convenience store is just awesome, but I digress. The truth of the matter is that animated films out. Plus, the hidden "adult" jokes in these primarily children's flicks strikes me as particularly funny. 


However, it isn't really a recent devel­opment that has drawn me into being an animation aficionado. I was raised on a steady diet of "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," 7 a.m. cartoon network vie wings and Disney's "Peter Pan." Perhaps my affection for these cartoon­ish creations extends further than just a personal preference, but maybe it is something that has been ingrained in me during my childhood. In the debate over nature versus nurture, I have a sneaking suspicion my propensity toward animated flicks is from being a product of my environment.

won three of four to begin the night two points out of the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. 
Losers of five straight on the road, the Maple Leafs still earned their 85th point, one better than the New York Islanders and Carolina Hurricanes. 
John Pohl tied it at 1-1 in the first with his 12th goal. 
Kozlov, who scored two goals for a career-high 75 points in a 3­2 overtime loss at Florida on Wednesday night, was in the bot­tom of the left circle when he swept the puck past the right side of goaltender Andrew Raycroft for his 27th goal. 
Nik Antropov's hooking penalty led to Atlanta's man advantage in OT and helped the Thrashers improve to 7-1 in their last eight home games. 
Johan Hedberg improved to 8­4-2, winning his second straight start as coach Bob Hartley gave Kari Lehtonen the night off. Despite stopping 27 of 29 shots, Hedberg was leaning far to his left when Gill beat him with a wide-open shot from the left cir­cle. 
Hedberg was so focused on the crowd in front of him that he apparently failed to see Antropov control a rebound and make a backhanded pass across the slot to Gill. 
Pohl's wrister from the left cir­cle beat Hedberg under the pads. 
In their last seven road games, the Maple Leafs have earned just two points. 
I-Iossa, who had scored just one goal in the last seven games, was skating down the right side of the slut when Keith Tkachuk's back­handed pass from the bottom of the left circle hit him in stride. Bossa lifted a wrister over Raycroft's glove side 3:24 into the first. 
Kozlov had four goals and flve assists in the season series against Toronto, which Atlanta won 3-1. 
Ducks 5, Blue Jackets 2 
COLUMBUS, Ohio -Teemu Selanne scored a goal and assist­ed on three third-period power­play goals, and the Anaheim Ducks beat the Columbus Blue Jackets Thursday night to set a franchise record for road wins with 20. 
Chris Pronger had two goals and an assist for Anaheim, who are chasing their first division title since entering the league in 1993 and the President's Trophy for the most regular season points. 
Ryan Getzlaf and Francois Beauchemin each added a goal and an assist. 
The Ducks, who won 3-1 in Chicago on Wednesday, entered with a four-point edge over Dallas in the Pacific Division. They won their 46th game and now have 104 points, extending their fran­chise records. 
Aaron Johnson and Sergei Fedorov scored for Columbus, which had a 2-1 lead early in the third period but had its four-game winning streak snapped. 
Down in the third period, the Ducks scored four goals, includ­ing two on the power player 3:50 apart to take the lead. 
Moments after the Ducks had a goal waived off, Selanne fed for­mer Blue Jackets defenseman Beauchemin at the back post to make it 2-2 at 3:48. 
Selanne then sent a pass to Getzlaf, who stepped from the left end line and let go a shot at 7:38 that hit off the leg of Columbus defenseman Ron Hainsey and past goaltender Fredrick Norrena, who was stellar the first two periods. 
Pronger scored his 13th with a slap shot from the right circle at 
14:53 to make it 4-2 with another power play goal. Selanne scored into an empty net with 2 seconds remaining. 
During a scoreless first period, Norrena made two superb saves during the second half of the peri­od on point blank chances by Anaheim's Andy McDonald and Chris Kunitz on odd-man rushes. Norrena finished with 26 saves. 
Ducks goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere then stood strong, flash­ing his glove to stop David Vyborny's snap shot minutes into the second period. He made 23 stops. 
Columbus broke through on a fluky goal at 6:40 to make it 1-0. 
Jody Shelley smacked a slap shot from the left circle that Giguere kicked aside into traffic. Johnson was credited with the rebound goal, which withstood video review after it appeared to hit the skate of defenseman Kent Huskins and quickly bounce off the net. 
With Ole-Kristian Tollefsen and Kunitz in the penalty box for roughing late in the period, Pronger's shot from the left boards deflected off Columbus defenseman Anders Eriksson and past Norrena at 19:20 to tie it.

American Michael Phelps swims during his record-breaking 200-meter Individual Medley final at the World Swimming Championships in Melbourne, Thursday. It marked Phelps' third world record of the day and fourth gold medal. 
Phelps gets four golds, three records 
Associated Press medley at Rod Laver Arena. with four golds to his name. in a really strong racing 
MELBOURNE, Australia -Six weeks ago, Michael Phelps showed up for a swim meet in America's heartland, sporting a goatee and unkempt hair that barely fit under his skincap. 
Then, he went out and set a world record. Hmmm, this might be good. 
"Right then and there, I thought something special could happen this year," Phelps said Thursday. 
Boy, was he on the mark. Phelps set his third world record in many days at the world swimming champi­onships, wiping out the field in the 200-meter individual 

Phelps came home in 1 minute, 54.98 seconds, easi­ly bettering his own mark of 
1:55.84 set last August at the Pan Pacific champi­onships. Just as he did in the other record-breaking swims, he jumped out to a quick lead and snuffed out all hope for those who dove in the pool with him. 
"Why stop something that works?" Phelps said, not requiring an answer. 
The 21-year-old phenom­enon -or "mutant," as teammate Tara Kirk referred to him -is still on course to go eight-for-eight at these championships, reaching the midway point of his grueling schedule 
IN BRIEF 
Tigers' Rogers to miss first 
start of regutar season 
LAKELAND, Fla. -Kenny Rogers was placed on the 15-day disabled list Thursday with a tired arm, a move that makes Chad Durbin the Detroit Tigers' fifth starter. 
The move, retroactive to Sunday, sends Rogers to the DL for the first time since 2001. Manager Jim Leyland said Rogers will miss only one start. 
"Number one, you're concerned about Kenny Rogers and make sure he's OK. The other part will take care of itself. We'll march on and hopefully this won't be a very long period of time," Leyland said before Detroit's 3-1 win over the Houston Astros. 
"This is part of it. I don't want to downplay the significance of his contributions and how good he is. At the same time, we have to go on. Our concern is about Kenny's wel­fare." 
"There is nobody out there like him," said Jon Urbanchek, a longtime American coach. "Right now, Michael stands by him­self." 
C'mon, surely he com­pares with another athlete of this era. Tiger Woods surely comes to mind. Or maybe Roger Federer. 
"He's more like Michael Jordan," Urbanchek said. "He's way out there." 
Phelps' personal coach, Bob Bowman, began to sense last month that his star pupil was on the verge of a landmark accomplish­ment Down Under. 
At an off-the-radar meet in Missouri, Phelps was "not state" for the 200 fly. This was a warmup, pure and simple, a chance to hone some techniques for Melbourne. Heck, he didn't even bother shaving down in true swimmer fashion. 

And still, he broke his own world record. 
"That was unexpected. That wasn't part of the script," Urbanchek said. "When he put that swim in, everyone knew the big one was coming here." 
Did it ever. 
Phelps led off a gold­medal showing the 400 free relay with a time that would have been good enough to win individually in the 100 free Thursday night. 
Ochoa close to claiming No. 1 
spotoverSorensbun 
RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif.-Lorena Ochoa took the first step toward over­taking Annika Sorenstam at No. 1 in the world. 
Even though her putting wasn't up to her standards, Ochoa hit it close enough Thursday at the Kraft Nabisco Championship to make five birdies and open with a 3-under 69 in tough conditions, leaving her one shot behind Shi Hyun Ahn in the first major of the year. 
"I feel good. I'm ready to go," said Ochoa, who can move to No. 1 with a victory. 
Tough conditions at Mission Hills kept Ochoa and everyone else from going anywhere too quick. Unlike a year ago, when Ochoa tied an LPGA major record with a 62, the greens were too firm and the rough too thick to allow for that kind of scoring. 
Karrie Webb couldn't repeat her 18th hole magic. 
Urbina sentenced to 14 years 
for attempted murder 
CARACAS, Venezuela-Former Major League baseball pitcher Ugueth Urbina was sentenced to 14 years in prison for the attempted murder of five workers on his fami­ly's ranch, the Attorney General's Office announced Wednesday. 
Urbina, a former pitcher with the Montreal Expos, Boston Red Sox, Texas Rangers, Florida Marlins, Detroit Tigers and Philadelphia Phillies, was also found guilty of ille­gal deprivation of liberty and violat­ing a prohibition against taking jus­tice into his own hands during a dis­pute over a gun on Oct. 16, 2005, according to a statement from the Attorney General's Office. 
The .32-year-old free agent was accused of joining a group of men in attacking and injuring workers with machetes and pouring gasoline on them at his family's ranch, located about 25 miles south of Caracas.

All-American sophomore Jordan Hook and sophomore Brittney Dunn-and an undefeated dou­bles duo of Dunn and junior Shannon Hale. Still, Stevenson expects his team to perform well and plans to approach the match with a positive disposition. 
"You can never go into any­thing with a negative attitude because then you are always beat before you start," he said. 
Olivet Nazarene also owns a strong fall record of 10-1. Entering the spring season ranked No. 21 in the National Association of Intercollegiate Atheletics Poll, the team has yet to play because of weather con­ditions postponing its matches. 
Stevenson plans to play his normal lineup with senior cap­tain Kelly McDavitt in the No. 1 singles spot and freshman Camille Gebert playing in the No. 2 spot. Together the unde­feated duo will compete in No. 1 doubles position. 
"It should be good match-play experience," McDavitt said of the Wheaton Invitational. "We are going to learn a lot because they are both good teams. We are planning to work on our skills this weekend and get ready for our next conference match."

Along with lsban, the Irish will send senior co-captain Adam Gifford, junior Eddie Peckels, sophomore Josh end's field but have gone just 4­12-1 in those match ups. 
"We faced a pretty good field at Sawgrass [Country Club in the John Hayt Invitational) but this might be the best one we've seen," Isban said. 
Isban emphasized his team's efficiency on the greens this weekend. 
"It's going to come down to whether we can make our putts," he said. 
This year marks the fourth in a row in which the Irish have competed in the Administaff Invitational, which was held at Forest Hills Golf Club until 2006. The teams expect near­optimal conditions for the weekend. 
"It's a little bit cooler than we expected but we have no com­plaints," Isban said.

Irish coach Tracy Coyne said she wasn't surprised by the Huskies' success this season. 
"We scrimmaged them in the fall, and knew they had the talent and ability," Coyne said. "Last season things just didn't go their way, and this year they've started strong."

NCAA champion Northwestern. Since that loss the sophomore is 5-1 with an 8.33 goals against average and a .550 save percentage. 
"The defense is playing with a lot of confidence right now," Coyne said. "We've put up defen­sive pressure and forced oppo­nents to take low percentage shots, and when they've gotten good shots off Erin has been amazing." 
After the Big East showdown on Friday, the Irish will host another match Sunday at 1 against non-conference foe Duquesne~ The Dukes (4-3) bring a high powered offense that comes into thn game averaging 
13.3 goals pnr oontest.

"I think Duquesne will come out aggressively and try to chal­lenge us -they're on the road and looking to make a state­ment," Coyne said. 
While Notre Dame has put up impressive showings on both oll"ense and defense this season, Coyne said she is still waiting for the team to dominate on both ends. 
"We've had dominant ollfmsive games and really good defensive games, but we're still waiting to put everything together and have the perfect game," she said.

another two games. 
The Irish are currently undefeated in Big East play. After a sluggish start with the bats earlier on in the month, Notre Dame has turned it on, and as a result, the victories are pouring in. 
Pittsburgh is currently in fourth place in the Big East with a 2-1 confnronce record, tallying a 14-19 mark overall. Syracuse is right below the Irish in the Big East standings at third with a 3-1 record. Overall. Syracuse's record is sufTnring due to a 10-20 mark. 
The Irish pitching has benn impeccable during the team's impressive streak. Bargar has led the way with a 10-7 n~cord, posting a stifling 2.23 EHA along with 14 complete games and 116 strikeouts. 
Senior Kenya Fuemmeler will also need to be on her game to find success this 
weekend -and so far this season, she has. The Irish pitcher has a 5-5 record with a solid 2.90 ERA and 49 strikeouts. 
While its pitchers have enjoyed excellent production during the streak, Notre Dame's bats have also deliv­ered. Senior Stephanie Brown has accumulated a .408 batting average, giving the Irish many chances to score by getting on base. 
The HBI production has come mainly from freshman Ileather Jackson, who has taken advantage of her opportunities with 18 RBis. Sophomore Linda Kohan and Laing have put in 13 and 11 runs, respectively. 
If the Irish keep winning this weekend, they will con­tinue to dominate Big East play. This will only help headed into the champi­onships later on in May with the higher goal of the College World Series waiting after that.

Notre Dame's opponent, No. 28 Wichita State, has an impressive 15-1 overall and will be riding a four match­winning streak when the teams meet today. 
Louderback realizes that this matchup will probably not be easy. 
"It should be good," he said. "Wichita State has only lost one match. They've got mostly international kids and they've got a lot of young kids that have just come in, so it's hard to tell how good they are. They lost 4-3 to Ohio State and that's

both teams on March 20. 
Despite the solid result against Bellarmine, consis­tency has been a problem for Notre Dame so far this sea­son. After winning their first two games -including a 9-7 
victory over then No. 11 Loyola ­the Irish dropped three of four with close losses to Cornell, North Carolina, and Dartmouth sandwiched around a 16-5 drubbing of Drexel. 
"We know what team we want to play like, 
but it's just been a matter of what team shows up for us," junior goalie Joey Kemp said. "We played great against Drexel and lackadaisical against teams like Dartmouth 
and North Carolina. I think it's something we've overcome, and it's just something we need to show on the field now."

The meeting Saturday will be the second all-time between the two schools, with the Irish winning the only other contest 11-5 last season at Moose-Krause Stadium. But this Brown team will be different than the one Notre Dame defeated last season. The Bears have already more than doubled last year's win really been the only tight match they've had." 
The Irish, who will be com­peting for the first time in over a week, have slightly shifted their focus during practice this week as they continue their stretch of outdoor matches. 
"We had the weekend off so 
the kids had a little 
bit of rest and we 
been indoors so we 

were able to get outside Monday and Tuesday, which is key for us right now." 
In addition to playing Wichita State today, Notre Dame will wrap up the weekend when it battles No. 37 Tulsa in Oklahoma Sunday. With his team on a roll, Louderback likes his chances over the weekend. 
"All of our kids have been playing really well, playing with a lot of confidence, so I feel pretty good about it," he said.

total of two. 
"They're playing with a new attitude this season," Kemp said. "They have a new coach, and they basically had open tryouts before the sea­son. A lot of old guys were cut, and a lot of the new guys are still trying to prove them­selves." 
Beyond the new attitude, a big reason for Brown's turn­
around has been 
the play of senior 
sophomore goalie Jordan Burke. Burke leads the 

Ivy League with 12.40 saves per game and is ranked. fourth nationally with a save percentage of .683. 
"He's been a very large part 
of their success," Kemp said. "Teams always play better when your goalie is hot, 
by Inside Lacrosse. Kemp was named the GWLL Player of the Week for the second time this season for his nine save performance in Notre Dame's win over Bellarmine last week. Kemp enters Saturday's game carrying a

[the improvement] will con­tinue." 
Schrage said earlier this week that he expects the bullpen issues to correct themselves. Notre Dame's relief pitchers had been a strength until the South Florida series. Even given the rough stretch over the past week, relief pitchers junior Joey Williamson and fresh­man Eric Maust have ERAs under 3.2. 
As for the lack of clutch hit­ting, shortstop Brett Lilley said he is optimistic that it will improve. 
"Sometimes it's bad luck," Lilley said. "A lot of our guys have hit the ball hard with runners on base. We just haven't gotten that lucky. Hitting is contagious. Once one person gets a clutch hit, they just keep on rolling." 
As Notre Dame's leadoff hit­ter, Lilley and his .505 on­base percentage have been the main victim of runner­stranding. But he said that he is guilty of poor clutch hitting as well. 
"I get frustrated when I'm up [with runners on base] and I don't get the hit," Lilley said. "I also get out when runners are on base." 
Schrage said Trees Field in Pittsburgh, home of an Astroturf infield which does­n't slow down ground balls as much as grass, may help Notre Dame's timely hitting. 
"Pittsburgh's ballpark is a hitter's ball park, so hopeful­ly we can continue to hit well out there," Schrage said. 
Pittsburgh comes into the three-game series 9-12 and 3-3 in the Big East. It took two of three from Cincinnati last weekend but, like the Irish, dropped two out of its three games against South Florida. 
The Panthers' best hitters are Gary Bucuren, who is hit­ting .333 this year with three home runs and 16 RBis, and Jordan Herr, who is hitting .327 with three more homers and 11 RBis. 
Tonight's game will begin at 6, Saturday's game will begin at 3, and Sunday's game will begin at noon.

25 Bryan Koniecko, No. 34 Devin Mullings and No. 75 Chris Klingemann in singles play. 
"[Moneke] has terrific ground strokes," Bayliss said. "He's very consistent, and he just never beats himself. He gets stronger the longer the point goes on and you have to hurt him to beat him." 
But singles action is not the Buckeyes' only strength on the courts. The No. 7 Irish duo of Sheeva Parbhu and Ryan Keckley are likely to face off against No. 16 Mullings and Klingemann. No. 82 Koniecko and Moneke will challenge Irish sophomore Brett Helgeson and senior Barry King at the No. 2 position. 
"The Ohio State match is cer­tainly one that's been on both teams' calendars the whole year," Bayliss said. 
There is a long history between the two teams. They last faced off last February when then-No. 26 Notre Dame defeated the previ­ously undefeated Buckeyes 5-2. Bass knocked off Mullings at No.1 singles and Parbhu clinched the upset for the Irish with a win over Koniecko. 
"We know their people well and there is a lot of mutual respect between both programs," Bayliss said. 
Both the Irish and the Buckeyes enter the match after blanking their most recent opponents. Notre Dame cruised past Michigan State Wednesday and Ohio State polished off No. 23 Minnesota Sunday. 
Notre Dame heads back to South Bend after tonight's match to take on Illinois. 
Notre Dame understands the challenges Illinois, the 2003 NCAA Champions, will present. Bayliss noted that the top five players for the Fighting Illini are all strong and powerful servers. No. 6 Kevin Anderson will likely challenge Bass at the No. 1 position. 
"[Anderson] is a big strong guy with a huge serve and big groundstrokes," Bayliss said. "He doesn't have a lot of weaknesses." 
Despite the challenges ahead, Bayliss said the team plans on sticking to the game it has been playing all season long en route to 17-3 record.

Notre Dame ended its three-game losing streak Wednesday against struggling Chicago State, but the real test of whether the Irish have corrected the problems that led to the skid will come this weekend when they travel to Pittsburgh to play the Panthers in a three-game Big East series. 
Over the last four games ­which include two losses to South Florida, a defeat to Central Michigan and the win over the Cougars -the Irish have stranded 49 runners per contest, and their bullpen has given up a total of 22 runs. 
Irish coach Dave Schrage said he hoped the problems were fixed after the Chicago State victory, but he will not know for sure until the con­ference series against Pittsburgh. 
"With one game its tough to tell," he said. "But hopefully [the improvement] will con-

"Yeah we're still struggling [with injuries]," Louderback said. "We'll probably have two out. The same two, [Brook] Buck and [Colleen] Rielley, will probably miss this weekend and we're hoping they're going to be back next week."

Tough task on tap for weekend

Notre Dame has its plate full this weekend. 
The Irish are slated to take on No. 2 Ohio State today in Columbus and No. 8 Illinois at home Sunday. 
Notre Dame travels to Columbus well aware of the com­petition that awaits, Irish coach Bobby Bayliss said. 
Ohio State's strength is in num­bers. Four of the siX singles play­ers for Ohio State are ranked in the top 7 5 nationally, and the team boasts two ranked doubles teams, as well. 
Irish senior Stephen Bass likely will take on national No. 10 Steven Moneke.

University bans vaginas; men rejoice 
Zahm applauds ND's decision to eliminate women from campus 
By I-LEAN BACK 
and TIMMY DOUGHBOY 
News Writers 
Under a banner reading "X­pel the X Chromosome," University President Father Jim Junkins announced in a press conference at the football stadi­um Thursday that all vaginas are to be removed from campus within the next week. Notre Dame is also revoking all acceptance letters it issued to vagina-bearing applicants for the class of 2011. 
The dictum is the latest event in Junkins' "X-pel the X Chromosome" campaign, which forced "The Vagina Monologues" to a classroom last year and to an off-campus location this year. 
"It was the next logical step," Junkins said. "First we got rid of the 'Vagina Monologues.' But then I realized my folly -vagi­na dialogues are twice the vagi­nas! We just couldn't risk our holy men of faith succumbing to the temptation to converse with -or, worse yet, ejaculate in the presence of -vaginas. I mean, it's in the good book.'' 
Junkins later clarified that by ''good book" he meant

Junkins adopts Ugandan 
By JEREMY PORTERHOUSE 
Griffin 

After a recent trip to Uganda, University President Father Jim Junkins returned with more than just memories. 
Upon his arrival at South Bend regional airport, an ador­ing crowd saw Junkins de­plane with the newest member of the campus community -a young Ugandan orphan boy. 
"He's adorable, isn't he?" Junkins asked, gazing at the yet-unnamed child. 
Most of the crowd, however, couldn't see much more than the boy's scalp, as Junkins' spe­cial order orphan-protective Coach carrying bag did not meet the president's exacting specifications. 
Junkins said he and his part­ner on the trip, Ben Affleck­Maves, chose the boy, who is between 4 and 7 years old, as a symbolic humanitarian gesture. 
"It is a way to show our soli­darity with our host nation and friends," Junkins said. 
Junkins and Affleck-Maves selected the child after a rigor­ous "American Idol"-style search process. 
Hundreds of young contest­ants sang pop classics for the pair, and Junkins was delighted with the boy's rendition of Lionel Richie's "Hello," which the University president said "enraptured him." The boy later cemented Junkins' affec­

INSIDE COLUMN 
This one goes out to  

I know at least one person who has whined multiple times about not get­ting an inside column. So okay, here you go Erin, but to keep my pride it's going in The Absurder. 
But it seemed creepy to write 500 words about one of my room­mates, April Fool's or not. So I start­ed to consider all the other people who I did not write an inside column about. So far, I've written about lazy people, beer (and non­beer) drinkers, Eagles fans, Cavanaugh foot­ball players, my dad and townies, among other topics. Ironically, Erin fits into at least three of the above categories. But she still complains about never getting the 500 words of fame that are an inside column. 
So Erin, this one's for you. But there are some other issues which have never made it into print. Here are a few of the things that I feel strongly about, because this is The Absurder and you care. A lot. 
Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the really good omelet guy at North Dining Hall. He is middle-aged, has white hair and makes significantly better omelets than anyone else in the entire world. Seriously, I have had omelets at really nice places, and I would take this wonderful NDH culi­nary creation anytime. I will wait in any length of line to get this man to make me an omelet. Seriously, no matter what else is going on in my life, this brings more joy to me than is socially acceptable. 
Secondly, what is with taking away the $1 Long Islands at Finnys? The $6 pitchers do not even remotely com­pare. This was by far the best deal in town. I could spend the change in the cupholder in my car and have a truly excellent time. Now, everytime I order a drink I feel cheated. I know that's not fair. But giving me a $1 Long Island and then taking it away, with no warning? I'm not okay with that. 
Thirdly, Jeff Bergstrand, finance professor. This man is on a postcard, which automatically makes him important. I would take graduate level finance classes in order to get a seat in this man's class. Obviously I can't do that, but I definitely would. 
Fourth, Club 23. Where did all the tacos go? Although it's practically next door, I don't really count myself as a huge Club 23 fan. This is because, in the early 90's, Club 23 used to have all-you-can-eat tacos for $1. I realize that Mondays at 23 also coincides with Fajita Rita Monday (in itself an excellent idea), but I am real­ly intrigued by the idea of food at a bar. I think I would be a much bigger fan of 23 if the tacos came back. 
To conclude this article, I apparent­ly feel strongly about my roommate complaining about a lack of coverage in campus journalism, an NDH employee, two bars and a finance professor. Sounds like senior year to me. 
The views expressed in the Inside Column are those of The Absurder, and have nothing to do with logic or coherent thought.

"Sure, it's not always easy to deal with these chicks," said Jimmy John, a sophomore from Keough. "They're always leaning over and being like, 'what was that whistle for? Why is he allowed to smash that guy against the wall?' And during the good parts, like the fights, they scream. · It's really loud and girly." 
But isn't fan support a good thing? 
"It's always a good thing, yeah," John said. "The main problem is, the really good­looking girls aren't interested in the guys in the stands. It's the jerseys all the way." 
One player, speaking on condition of anonymity, called it a chicken-and-the-egg situ­ation. 
"I play better when there's beauties watching, eh?" he said. "And they like to come watch when we're No. 1. I don't know if we got good 'cause they're hot or if they're hot 'cause we're good. But I'll take it, eh?"

Success has long been a way for Olympic sports to gain attention from top-tier women in the greater South Bend area. While dating a fencing champion still doesn't have the social cachet of casually hooking up with a second-string football player, sports like hockey, soccer and lacrosse can become more credible in the eyes of legiti­mately hot women by docu­mented on-the-field suecess. 
Baseball coach Shave Drage called the hockey team's suc­cess "inspiring." 
"This just goes to show what a determined group of guys can accomplish," he said. ''I'm definitely going to have the baseball team doing inspirational sprints past the hockey house in the off-sea­son."

"Don't place all the blame on me," Cheis retorted. "When I recruited Timmy, he was always on the field wearing his helmet. I never saw his face." 
But according to sources close to The Absurder, Cheis attended one of Paulson's high school games last fall when his face was allegedly exposed. With his team leading 72-3 in the first quarter, Paulson was pulled and he spent the rest of the game on the sidelines with­out a helmet. 
Several thousand fans glimpsed Paulson sans helmet, but Cheis was not around. 
"I was down the road at the Golden Corral," Cheis said. "It was $2.99 rib night." 
With Paulson relegated to a role as backup hockey goalie, the search for Greg Brady's successor continues. Rubbersoul has contacted sev­eral modeling agencies, and has scouted American Idol.

Gooney, however, said her short-term decision wasn't in place then. 
"He was a man," she said. "This is a women's campus and, obviously, men are pigs. Don't be ridiculous." 
As part of her plan to restore the integrity of Saint Mary's athletics and cripple what she calls the "athlete mentality," Saint Mary's will feature a new guest head coach each month beginning next season. Tryouts are free and open to the pub-

"We are providing a unique opportunity to those with a passion for basketball," Gooney said. 
Sources indicated that, as a symbol of her new policy, Gooney herself would coach the first month, but talks staled after Gooney decided she was "too busy for that crap." 
Those close to the program have also speculated that in order to increase game atten­dance, Saint Mary's will give one lucky fan at select home games the opportunity to become the head coach, begin­ning at halftime of that very game. Still, Gooney was non­committal. 
"This is a serious plan," she said. "We don't want to turn the position into a joke."

What are these football fans coming to? Last Saturday some anarchist in front of me had the audacity to ... gasp ... stand up during the game. Not only that, but he also kept yelling when the other team had the ball ­like he was some kind of cheerleader with a personal interest in the outcome of the game. I pay good money to sit in those yellow cushy seats right on the 50 yard line-a criti­cal place where one's voice can be heard from end zone to end zone (how obnoxious!)-and I have the right to rest my pampered patoot whenever I want. 
When I kindly asked the whippersnapper to please sit down. he ignored me. "Sorry I'm just trying to cheer on my Irish defense .... oh, you're rooting for Notre Dame too? Maybe you should join me." 
To think I would stoop to that level! I already financed the buildings these players study in, and now they want me to yell and stand, too?

As an 18-year-old young woman, I thought I had made a wise decision. This decision was to spend the next four years of my life in a testos­terone free environment. Free from the hassles of classroom flirtation, the worry of brushing my hair or even wearing real pants for a whole week. 
Aside from my occasional Star bucks run to LaFun or a weekend dorm party romp, my life has generally been male-free ... until recently. 
My estrogen driven world has been turned upside-down by the egotistically driven males who think they have the right to work out in Angela Athletic Facility-the clown-like gym with three functioning treadmills that SMC women have come to call our workout haven. 
No, men of Notre Dame and Holy Cross (and, by the looks of things, St. Joe High School), you cannot impress us with your cut-off t-shirts as you do sets of pull-ups, bust a sweat by racing around the indoor track of our over-heated facil­ity or by handing us a gym-wipe after our work­out. 
Your immature (and amateur) workout regime has not only put a damper on our sacred single­sex environment, but it has also made it manda­tory to display three forms of I.D. when entering the facility -making it more difficult for a stu­dent to access Angela than it is for a minor to enter Feve. 
If you think the gym is the right place to scope us out, let alone attempt to pick us up, you are wrong. We don't appreciate men who unexpect­edly show up in our strictly female environment. 
We see you from the time you walk in the door -always in at least a pack of five. You approach the equipment area, looking for short­short<; and sports bras, before you choose your workout zone. 
Gyms might be prime zones for co-ed interac­tion in the real world, but in this gender­strained environment your machismo might be more appreciated during alcohol induced inter­action. 
So, gentlemen, take your athletic (and sexual) urges elsewhere, and stay out of our gym.

Paulson not as hot as Brady 
Facing pressure from NBC execs, Cheis cuts homely frosh 
By BLACKJACK HEISMAN 
One Lucky Guy 

The Timmy Paulson era is over before it ever started. 
Earlier today, Irish head coach Barley Cheis announced that Paulson -the blue chip freshman signal-caller -will not be allowed to play for Notre Dame. 
"Greg Brady left a legacy of Abercrombie style and chiseled good looks at this school," Cheis said. "Sadly, I don't think Timmy has the jaw line to live up to it." 
Cheis acknowledged that Paulson has all the athletic tools to lead the Irish to at least six national champi­onships. But, after consulting with NBC producers and University marketing execu­tives, the decision to take Hummer out of the quarter­back race was made. 
"We just can't envision Timmy playing a leading role for us," said Richard Rubbersoul, producer of NBC's The Notre Dame Saturday Afternoon Football Extravaganza Presented by AFLAC. "The funny thing is, I

Phish? Harrybody not swimming in laughter 
ByJOHN DALY Pissed Off 

Notre Dame basketball play­er Duke Harrybody was sus­pended for the remainder of the spring semester Wednesday and is currently on his way home to Bloomington, Ind., the freshman said in a phone interview with The Absurder. 
Harrybody -a freshman who was found with three Phish CDs in his car on Feb. 2 -said he was not dismissed from the University. 
But the news of a suspension surprised him given that lis­tening to Phish CDs isn't a felony or misdemeanor in St. Joseph's County. 
"Honestly, this is ridiculous," Harrybody said. "I have friends at colleges all over the country who listen to Phish regularly. When I first heard 
about the suspension, thought they were joking." 
Senior Associate Athletics Director Jack Meisler told The Absurder Tuesday he was unable to comment. Notre Dame sports information director Barney Catenelli said she could not comment due to privacy laws. 
Notre Dame basketball coach Fred Frey cannot com­ment on the situation either, Catenelli said, before adding that he was currently on a plane to Lexington, Ky . to meet with the University of Kentucky's athletic office. 
Harrybody, who was pulled over during a routine traffic stop near campus early in the morning on Feb. 2, is the sec­ond Notre Dame basketball player to be suspended this year.

Dozenis better than 1for Belles 
By WHOO NEEDSHAIR

In what has become a stan­dard move, Saint Mary's dis­missed basketball coach Jane Manly at the end of the sea­son. Manly guided the Belles to a 12-13 record last season, a record that Saint Mary's president Merrill Gooney called "unacceptable." 
Gooney later clarified that the firing had nothing to with Manly's performance, noting that the coach was "good at what she does," but more of a cultural decision that she has made for the College. 
"It is unacceptable that any coach should be tenured for basketball for that long at Saint Mary's," she said. "It is absolutely unconscionable." 
Gooney expressed fears that, with a good, long-term coach. Saint Mary's would go from being a community of women with a focus on academic excellence to a powerhouse athletic program with a repu­tation for academic abuses in the name of winning. 
"It's a question of priorities," she said. "Would you rather the daughters of Saint Mary's

It can have a big effect on how athletes play the field ­the dating field, that is. 
After ascending to the No. 1 ranking, the hockey team's groupies "became significantly more attractive," said coach Jack Jeffson. "The correlation between on-ice success and what the guys call 'smoking hottness' in the stands is proven yet again." 
Others around campus have noticed that hockey games not only draw more fans, but that the female fans are significant­ly better looking than in years past.
