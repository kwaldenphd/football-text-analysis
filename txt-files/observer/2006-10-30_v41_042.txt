Business school earns top-30 national ranking 
By KATIE PERRY 
News Writer 
For the third straight time, Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business ranked among the top 30 in BusinessWeek maga­zine's biennial survey of MBA programs nationwide. 
The rankings feature -which spotlighted Notre Dame at No. 26 -is in the Oct. 23 edition on newsstands now. BusinessWeek placed the program at 24th in its 2002 survey and 29th in its 2004 survey. 

Finance department chair Robert Huang said Notre Dame is consistently recognized by such rankings because the MBA program is "never satisfied." 
"We never stop improving our­selves," he said. "Both the facul­ty and the staff are united in making our students their top priority." 
The magazine also named Notre Dame to its list of the top 10 schools for fastest return on

Irish fans pleased with road victory 
Historic competition entices loyal crowds despite lengthy traveling distance 
By PATRICK CASSIDY 
News Writer 
The last time Navy beat Notre Dame in a football game, John F. Kennedy was still President and man had not yet stepped foot on the moon. The Irish dominance over that span has remained unaltered as Notre Dame improved to 7-1 with a 38-14 victory over Midshipmen. 
Freshman Brendan McQueeney attended the game and said M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, Md. was "mostly in favor of the Irish." 
"However there were obvi­ously pockets of Navy sup­port," he said. "The atmos­phere was unbelievable and was well worth the ten-hour drive." 
Notre Dame's consecutive win streak over Navy -43 games -is the longest such streak in not only division-one college football, but any sport. "It's not even a challenge any­more," freshman Jeremiah Herman said. "I enjoy the tra­dition the game brings, but we should play a team that will help us morn in the rankings." 
Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn had an efficient day, passing for nearly 300 yards and scampering for a 19-yard touchdown. 
"I didn't know he could run that fast!" freshman Brock Hagerman said. "If Quinn con­tinues to take over games like he has the past couple weeks, his chances for the ... Heisman Trophy will only con­tinue to increase." 
After giving up over 200 yards in the first half to the Midshipmen's option offense, the defense made adjustments and helped the Irish cruise to a lopsided victory. 
"Navy's offense became too predictable and it was just a

ND democrats try to rally supporters 
By AMANDA MICHAELS Assistant News Editor 
With less than two weeks until Election Day, the Notre Dame College Democrats (NDCD) staged a "Campus Invasion" this weekend, bring­ing together Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Ball State University students to canvass the St. Joseph County area for the Joe Donnelly for Congress campaign. 
The event united approxi­mately 25 students -three of which came from Ball State in Muncie, Ind. -and while organizers had initially expected participants from other schools in the region, like Indiana University South Bend and Indiana State, they were still satisfied with the turnout. 

"Even though we expected more schools to come, it ended up being a very successful event with very good turnout," said Caitlin Conway, member of the NDCD and intern for the Donnelly campaign. "We cov­ered a lot of precincts, and the students from Ball State really helped out." 
Canvassers were spread throughout St. Joseph County on Saturday and Sunday, with groups of five per neighbor­hood. Each individual approached 40 or more hous­

Sale of basketball season tickets begins 
By STEVE KERINS 
News Writer 
Hundreds of students waited in the rain Thursday evening out­side the Joyce Center to attend the opening event for this year's men's basketball season and to receive a voucher that would allow them to purchase season tickets. 
Irish coach Mike Brey kicked off the event by introducing the evening's keynote guest -for­mer Notre Dame basketball play­er and NBA great John Paxson, currently General Manager of the Chicago Bulls. 
"I always enjoy the chance to come back to campus," Paxson said. 
Paxson spoke briefly about the responsibility of Notre Dame's students to support the players throughout the season, and said that students' enthusiasm at games is a strong factor in the team's success. 
"I can see what impact student bodies have on games and on their team," Paxson said. "It's nice when students are behind the guys that work so hard." 
Brey agreed, saying that the quality of the support from stu­dents and the full integration of student athletes into the University community allows Notre Dame to stand out among its peers.

I'm sure you saw it. And in case you didn't, I'm sure someone in your dorm taped it. 
"60 Minutes" essentially advertised their piece last night on Charlie Weis as "Weis Uninhibited" and starting out,

trayal changed. It was still "Weis Uninhibited", but it had a very different kind of frankness. 
There are many complicated people in the world, but Charlie Weis will never be one of them. His behavior focuses on two simple goals: 1) Complete, utter and undisputed victory and 2) Family. 
Sometimes you have to prove a point. One way to make your case is to reason with someone. Example: "Hey, I need you guys to work hard in practice because ifyou do you can get stronger and win more games, so pretty please, could you run a littler faster today?" 
Ok, I'll step back a bit. Appeals to rea­son are not necessarily that wimpy and ineffective. After all, Weis has been known to use simple math to encourage recruits. Example: four Super Bowl rings X you = you + NFL. But everyone, by their human nature, will have peri­ods in their life where they are tired, lazy, or just a little too comfortable when they shouldn't be. So, how does one solve a simple problem of human nature? Using very loud, but yet very basic methods! 
Jimmy Johnson, former coach of the Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins, once criticized head coaches who say they rank God and family ahead of coaching. He said something to the effect that many, ifnot most, coaches spend an hour a week in church, two hours with family and the other 165 hours in a week doing something related to coaching. It even seemed that he him­self was conceding the fact that he was living an upside down life. 
Weis said he was a brutally honest man in the "60 Minutes" piece and by the frank tone of his voice, I believed every word he said. Many coaches live personal tragedies obscured by false public glory. But while they might feel hopeless in dealing with family, Weis lacks that major flaw. Just as he'll use any words necessary to win a football game, he also said he'd do anything nec­essary to remain a faithful husband and a dedicated father. And though he might be vulgar on the field, he's certainly not one to bring hi<> work home with him. 
"I don't do anything for just me. I don't play golf. I don't go fishing. I don't even go to a ball game," is a witty Weis crack, but it speaks volumes about his priori­ties. The priests at Notre Dame might have been offended by Weis' language last night, but they should take much greater solace in the fact he is a symbol for the whole world to see the impor­tance of the bedrock institution of family. 
Are Weis' means pretty? Not always. But is he an honest man living towards the ends of a noble life? You better (insert your favorite Charliesm here) believe it.

Black cat adoptions banned on Halloween 
BOfSE, Idaho -No black cat will cross your path this Halloween, not if a northern Idaho animal shelter can help it. Like many shelters around the country, the Kootenai Humane Society in Coeur d'Alene is prohibiting black cat adoptions from now to Nov. 2, fearing the animals could be mistreated in Halloween pranks -or worse, sacrificed in some satanic ritual. 
The risk may be remote, said the shelter's executive director, Phil Morgan. 
"It's kind of an urban leg­end. But in the humane industry it's pretty typical that shelters don't do adop­tions of black eats or white bunnies because of the whole satanic sacrificial thing," Morgan said. "If we prevent one animal from getting hurt, then it serves its purposn." 

Vampyre club seeking new members 
LONDON -Vampyres are prowling for new rncruits in London as llalloween approachns to partake in wild parties, trips to Transylvania and bat spot­ting nights-but coffin­dwelling, blood drinkers need not apply. 
With a penchant for cus­tom-made fangs, striking make-up and gothic clothes, members of the London Vampyre Group (LVG) say it's their fasdnation with the romantic notion of vampires, rather than any darker intent, that draws them together. 
"People who think they're un-dead, hundreds of years old, or that you have to drink blood if you're inter­ested in the dark side of things, we can put them right on that," LVG's Mick Smith, 57, told Heuters.

New-law-s restrict trick-or-treating 
Associated Press 
NASHVILLE. Tenn. -Sex offenders on probation or parole in Tennessee are banned from Halloween costume parties this year and aren't even allowed to put up decorations like jack-o­lanterns that might attract youngsters. 
The new state guidelines are meant to clarify policies that prevent offenders from interact­ing with children, said Board of Probation and Parole spokesman Jack Elder, and were not enacted in response to any specific problems the board has seen during the Halloween season. 
Tennessee isn't the only state keeping close watch on sex offenders during Halloween. New York issued similar Halloween restrictions for sex offenders this year and imposed a 3 p.m. to 6 a.m. Halloween curfew on them. Sex offenders in Lima, Ohio, and Gaston County, N.C., were ordered to attend meetings with authorities that coincide with the prime hours for trick-or-treating. 
Maryland has even told sex offenders on parole or probation to keep their porch lights turned off Tuesday night. In addition, Baltimore County wiU pay about 20 plainclothes officers overtime to work the streets and look for sex offenders who have contact with children other than their own, said county police Cpl. Michael Hill. 

The Tennessee restrictions prohibit sex offenders from attending special Halloween events like corn field mazes and haunted houses, handing out treats, displaying Halloween decorations, accompanying trick-or-treating children or wearing costumes. 
They apply to all sex offenders on probation or parole -about 2,000 of the 8,100 registered offenders living in the state ­and not specifically to those offenders whose crimes involved minors. 
"No matter what their sex offense might have been, they must adhere to the same rules," Elder said. "Any sex offender is not supposed to have contact with minors. They all sign the same directives." 
That even means that offend­ers with children must find someone else to accompany them on trick-or-treating walks, he said. And if other children knock on their doors on Halloween, the offenders must not answer.

President fired at leading school 
Students, faculty celebrate trustees' decision 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON The board of trustees of the nation's premier school for the deaf voted Sunday to terminate the appointment of the incoming president, who had been the subject of protests, the board announced. 
The vote at Gallaudet University came after a day­long closed-door meeting that followed a month of protests by students and faculty members. Jane Fernandes, the school's for­mer provost, had been selected in May to take office in January. 
"Although undoubtedly there will be some members of the community who have differing views on the mean­ing of this decision, we believe that it is a necessity at this point," the board said in a written statement. 
Fernandes did not imme­diately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. 
Protesters had said 
Fernandes, 50, was a divi­sive and ineffective leader as provost. They said the board ignored surveys by students and faculty during the presidential search that called her "unacceptable." The faculty voted this month, 82 percent to 18 percent, for Fernandes to resign or be removed. 
Fernandes had refused to resign, saying it would hurt the university to allow protests to determine the school's leadership. She said she had become a lightning rod for those frustrated about changes in deaf cul­ture because she hadn't learned to use American Sign Language until she was in her 20s. 
Celebrations broke out on campus when the decision was announced. Professor Diane Morton, who joined protesters for a rally at the university gymnasium, said students were "elated" when protest leaders received the e-mailed announcement.

McGlinn's multi-cultural commis­sioner. 
"We gave patrons the opportu­nity to enjoy dishes ranging from Malawi Chicken from the ASA to Hal Pio from the Hawaii Club," she said. "There were also dance presentations from the Hawaiian and Filipino groups." 
The purpose carries additional significance for McGlinn Hall because its rector, Sister Mary Lynch, SSJ, visited Our Lady of Fatima a few years ago and saw it as a huge anchor for a poverty­stricken community in a third­world country. 
"The Parish [at Our Lady of Fatima] offers services that the Dominican government doesn't offer or charges more than the people can afford," she said. "Twenty-thousand people are part of the parish, and they're divided into small groups called, 'campos,' each of which contain a spiritual leader." 
Posters in the 24-hour lounge of McGlinn contained pictures and descriptions of the Church's outreach program. A wide range of services are available to them, including involvement in the sacramental life, discovering new water sources, education and community farming. 
Lynch is also a friend of Sister Jean Reilly, CSJ, of the St. Joseph Parish in Philadelphia, who is organizing a pharmacy and gro­cery store in Hondo Valle. The store, also a part of the Church's outreach, will receive the pro­ceeds from the Meal of Nations. 
"The store will only charge its customers three percent of the costs," Lynch said. "So that pno­ple can afford to buy any grocery items whenever they need ii. Many grocers in the Dominican Republic only sell certain prod­ucts when they exist in excess."

Militants kill 23 Iraqi policemen 
BAGHDAD-Suspected Sunni Arab gun­men killed 23 policemen Sunday, including 17 in one attack in the predominantly Shiite southern city of Basra, signaling the p.ossible start of an intensified insurgent campaign against Iraq's predominantly Shiite Muslim security forces. 
Political tension deepened in Baghdad when Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi, the coun­try's highest-ranking Sunni politician, threat­ened to resign if Prime Minister Nouri al­Maliki did not act quickly to eradicate two feared Shiite militias. 
Al-Maliki, a Shiite, depends heavily on the backing of the two Shiite political parties that run the militias and has resisted American pressure to eradicate the private armies ­the Mahdi Army of radical cleric Muqtada al­Sadr and the Badr Brigade, the military wing of Iraq's biggest Shiite political bloc, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq. 
Serbia resolves to reclaim Kosovo 
BELGRADE-Serbian voters have approved a new constitution reasserting Serbia's claim over the breakaway Kosovo province, inde­pendent observers and Serbia's prime minister said Sunday. 
The Belgrade-based Center for Free Elections and Democracy said their sample count after polls closed in the two-day vote indicated that 96 percent of those who partici­pated in the referendum supported the draft charter. 
At least 50 percent of the country's 6.6 mil­lion voters had to participate for the results to be valid and the group estimated turnout at 
53.3 percent. The final result is expected on Monday.

A second report found "significant challenges remain that put at risk" the U.S. military's goal ·of strengthening Iraqi security forces by trans­ferring all logistics operations to the defense ministry by the end of 2007. 
A third report concerned the Provincial Reconstruction Team program, in which U.S. government experts help Iraqis develop regional governmental institutions. "The unstable securi­ty environment in Iraq touches every aspect of the PRT program," the report said.

Parties set for upcoming election 
Democrats claim momentum, Republicans hope to mobilize base before Nov. 7 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Repub­licans on Sunday said a major voter turnout effort would help them stay in power after the Nov. 7 elec­tions, while Democrats claimed momentum as they seek to tap into voter unhap­piness over Iraq. 
Both sides agreed that the war in Iraq was a leading, if not central, issue in the con­tests to decide control of the House and Senate. 
"This election is becoming more and more a referen­dum on George Bush, his failed policies both overseas and at home with a rubber stamp Congress," said Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, head of the Senate Democratic campaign com­mittee. 
His Republican counter­part, Sen. Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina, said Iraq 
and  the  broader  fight  
against  terrorism  were  
important  issues,  but  

"President Bush's name is not on the ballot." Dem­ocrats, she said, were trying "to make it a national refer­endum." 
Schumer and Dole were among the politicians and party leaders who sparred on the Sunday talk shows just nine days before the elections. 
Democrats need a gain of 15 seats to win control of the 435-member House and six seats to claim the 100-mem­ber Senate. 
With approval slumping for both the war and the president, recent polls show Democrats have their best chance to reclaim the House since the GOP swept them from power in 1994, and a shot at capturing the Senate as well. 
As the candidates entered their final full week of cam­paigning, House Democrats worked to emphasize the GOP role in the Iraq war. The party's campaign com­mittee said it would air tele­vision commercials criticiz­ing Republicans for support­ing the war in about a dozen competitive races in the coming days. 


"Despite a war gone wrong and no plan for victo­ry, politicians like (Rep.) Rob Simmons keep voting to stay the course again and again," says one commercial, airing in Connecticut. 
Democrats have increased the number of races where they are advertising in recent days, a sign of confi­dence as the election approaches. In addition to new offensives in Kansas, Kentucky and New Hamp­shire, officials disclosed plans to run commercials against Republican Rep. Jim Walsh this week in the area around Syracuse, N.Y. 
House Majority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said polls showing a Democratic advantage, especially in the House, "don't mean any­thing, because what we have are 435 individual races all around the country, local candidates running on local issues." 
"If we mobilize all our vot­ers, we'll do well on Election Day," Boehner said. 
Ken Mehlman, chairman of the Republican National Committee, sounded a com­mon Republican theme ­that a Democratic-led Congress would mean high­er taxes. Democrats accused him of scare tactics. 
Mehlman suggested "across-the-board tax increases affecting millions of Americans" if Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel became chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. The New York lawmaker is now the panel's senior Democrat. 
Last week, Vice President Dick Cheney contended Rangel wanted to undo pop­ular tax cuts enacted during Bush's first term. Cheney's claim was based in part on Rangel's own remark that he could not think of one of Bush's tax cuts that merited renewal. 
"Once again the vice presi­dent hasn't the slightest clue about what he's talking about. He's never talked with me and neither has anyone in the administration about taxes," Rangel said Sunday. Rangel said his own remarks referred to broad­based tax overhaul efforts.

Nearly 100 dead in plane crash 
Associated Press 
ABUJA -A Nigerian airliner with 104 people on board slammed into the ground moments after takeoff on Sunday -the third deadly crash of a passenger plane in less than a year in this West African nation known for its notoriously unsafe air industry. Six people survived, and the rest were believed dead. 
Among those killed was the man regarded as the spiritual leader of Nigeria's Muslims, and thousands of people gathered at a regional airport to receive his body. 
The Boeing 7 3 7 crashed one 

minute after taking off from Ahuja airport, said Sam Adurogboye, an Aviation Ministry spokesman. President Ol use gun Ob asanj o ordered an immediate investiga­tion into the cause of the crash, his spokeswoman Remi Oyo said. 
Rescue workers found debris from the smashed plane, body parts and luggage strewn over an area the size of a football field. The plane went down inside the sprawling airport compound about two miles from the runway. Smoke rose from the aircraft's mangled and smoldering fuselage. Its tail hung from a tree. 
Emergency workers pulled 
blackened corpses from the wreckage, then covered the bodies with white sheets and hauled them away in stretchers. An Associated Press reporter counted at least 50 cadavers, though other bodies had been transported earli­er to local morgues. 
Through the day, airport securi­ty officials kept back anxious peo­ple seeking information about friends or loved ones. 
Adurogboye said 104 passengers and crew had been aboard the doomed flight, and he knew of six survivors who had been taken to a hospital. "Obviously the rest are feared dead," he said.

Conway explained that the focus of the canvassing was pri­marily to encourage Donnelly supporters to vote, rather than informing them of the 2nd District candidate's platform. 
"Over the last two years, we've been trying to get the word out about [Donnelly's] platform," she said. "But at this point, so close to the election, we figure a lot of people have made up their mind already. Now, we're just trying to get them to the polls."

According to the MBA program Web site, 93 percent of 2005 graduates seeking employment accepted offers within three months of graduation.

"[The early voting system] is important for us to mention, because some people might not realize it's available," Conway said. "I know I talked to a lot of Donnelly supporters who didn't know about the early voting, but thought it sounded really con­venient and said they would look into it." 
To kick-off the event, partici­pants went to Donnelly's cam­paign headquarters, where the candidate gave them words of thanks and encouragement.

The University of Chicago topped the list, followed by the MBA programs at the University of Pennsylvania and Northwestern University. The complete list can be viewed at the BusinessWeek Web site. 
The BusinessWeek rankings were based on a three-part methodology: student surveys (45 percent of the ranking), corpo­rate recruiter surveys (45 per­cent) and the analysis of "intellec­tual capital," as based on journal articles written by faculty mem­bers (10 percent). For the 2006 edition, the magazine used sur­veys results from 9,000 gradu­ates and more than 200 recruiters. 
Notre Dame was also ranked 32nd among the world's top 100 full-time MBA programs by the Economist Intelligence Unit in results released Oct. 12. Mendoza was 20th on the list of American schools and singled out as the top program with "Potential to Network."

Over the next nine days lead­ing up to the national election, Conway said the College Democrats will not have any more events like "Campus Invasion" planned, but many club members will be working the phones for Donnelly's cam­paign. 
The NDCD is also planning to stick to home base, rather than reciprocate the journey to the Ball State area.

Josh Berlo, direetor of ticket operations, said that this year's the routine from last year. 

"We did streamline it a bit by doing away with wristbands and making tickets available immediately following the event or on subsequent days to better accommodate student schedules," he said. 
Berlo also said fans can look forward to a great season with a full Joyce Center. 
"It is a bit early to know how ticket sales will be for this year," he said. "However, thus far they appear strong and similar to previous seasons." 
Students' opinions of Thursday's event were mixed, but most agreed that this year's price for season tickets was a bargain. 
Freshman Joseph Nachio was pleased with the process for purehasing tickets overall. 
"It seems really easy, well structured, [and] pretty con­venient," he said. "[And the price] is really good-sixty bucks and you're getting a full season."

IN BRIEF 
Bans could derail Great Lakes fishing 
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. -A government crack­down on live fish shipments from the Great Lakes states is intended to check the spread of a deadly aquatic virus, but critics say it could devastate the region's fishing industry. 
In an emergency order last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service banned interstate transport of 37 species of live fish from the eight states adjacent to the Great Lakes. Importing those species from the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec also was prohibited. 
The agency's target is viral hemorrhagic sep­ticemia, which poses no risk to humans but caus­es internal bleeding in fish. VHS was discovered in the region last year and is blamed for fish kills in lakes Erie, Ontario and St. Clair and the St. Lawrence River. 
Among species susceptible to the virus are pop­ular sport fish such as chinook and coho salmon, rainbow trout, walleye and yellow perch. 
Federal officials do not know how the virus, long a problem in Europe, reached the Great Lakes. But state fishery managers believe it came in ballast tanks of oceangoing cargo ships, con­sidered a leading source of exotic species such as zebra mussels that are damaging the lakes' ecol­ogy. 
Scientists resign to avoid crackdown 
WASHINGTON-Nearly 40 percent of the sci­entists conducting hands-on research at the National Institutes of Health say they are look­ing for other jobs or are considering doing so to escape new ethics rules that have curtailed their opportunity to earn outside income. 
Most scientists say the ethics crackdown is too severe, and nearly three-quarters of them believe it will hinder the government's ability to attract and keep medical researchers, accord­ing to a survey commissioned by the govern­ment's premier medical research agency. 
The tightened rules were put in place last year after NIH found dozens of scientists had ran afoul of existing restrictions on private consult­ing deals that had enriched them with money from drug and biotechnology compa­nies. 
Outside income from such companies is now banned. NIH also is placing greater restrictions on employees' financial holdings.

Board of Health vveighs potential benefits of trans-fat ban 

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -There are plenty of things in Kentucky Fried Chicken that are bad for your health -cholesterol, sat­urated fat and salt, to name a few. But only one has the potential to get the colonel's recipe banned in New York City. 
That ingredient is artificial trans fatty acids, which are so common that the average American eats 4. 7 pounds a year, according to the Food and Drug Administration. City health officials say these so­called trans fats are so unhealthy they belong in the same category as food spoiled by rodent droppings. 
On Monday, the Board of Health will hold its first public hearing on a proposal to make New York the first U.S. city to ban restaurants from serving food containing artificial trans fats. 
Eateries are scrambling for ways to get trans fats out of their food. 
KFC Corp. said it was plan­ning a "major announcement" in New York on Monday about a change coming to all 5,500 of its U.S. restaurants. Franchise owners told several newspa­pers and magazines that KFC would stop using partially hydrogenated vegetable oil ­the primary source of artificial trans fats. 
Representatives of the com­pany and its parent, Louisville, Ky.-based Yum Brands Inc., declined to comment, but the possible switch was applauded by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which sued KFC in June over the trans fat content of its chicken. 
"Assuming KFC goes through with it, it would be a tremen­dous improvement for the nutritional quality of their foods," said the center's execu­tive director, Mike Jacobson. 
Invented in the early 1900s, partially hydrogenated veg­etable oil was initially believed to be a healthy substitute for natural fats like butter or lard. It was also cheaper, performed better under high heat and had a longer shelf life. Today, it is used for deep frying and as a shortening in baked goods like cookies and crackers. 
Ironically, many fast food companies became dependent on hydrogenated oil about 15 years ago when they were pressured by health groups to do something about saturated fat. McDonald's emptied its fry­ers of beef tallow in 1990 and filled them with what was then thought to be "heart healthy" partially hydrogenated veg­etable oil. 

Virus attacks Midwest fish

TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. -A government crackdown on live fish shipments from the Great Lakes states is intended to check the spread of a deadly aquatic virus, but critics say it could devastate the region's fishing industry.

Federal officials do not know how the virus, long a problem in Europe, reached the Great Lakes. But state fishery man­agers believe it came in ballast tanks of oceangoing cargo ships, considered a leading source of exotic species such as zebra mussels that are dam­aging the lakes' ecology. 
The federal agency has scheduled a meeting with state and industry representatives for Tuesday in Washington, D.C., to discuss regulations aimed at containing the virus. 
The emergency order "just puts everything on hold until we can figure out what we're going to do," spokesman Jim Rogers said. 
But some in the region said they were blindsided by the order, which could be especial­ly hard on commercial fish farms and live bait vendors. It also could hamper stocking programs essential to the region's $4.5 billion fishery, critics said. 
"This order will completely eliminate long-established trades of sport fish between state agencies that are crucial to the maintenance, restora­tion and enhancement of sport

Teens main target of addictive beverages 
Energy drinks create dangerous tendencies 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -More than 500 new energy drinks launched worldwide this year, and cof­fee fans are probably too old to understand why. 
Energy drinks aren't merely popular with young people. They attract fan mail on their own MySpace pages. They spawn urban legends. They get reviewed by bloggers. And they taste like carbonated cough syrup. 
Vying for the dollars of teenagers with promises of weight loss, increased endurance and legal highs, the new products join top­sellers Red Bull, Monster and Rockstar to make up a $3.4 billion-a-year industry that grew by 80 percent last year. 
Thirty-one percent of U.S. teenagers say they drink energy drinks, according to Simmons Research. That rep­resents 7.6 million teens, a jump of almost 3 million in three years. 
Nutritionists warn that the drinks, laden with caffeine and sugar, can hook kids on an unhealthy jolt-and-crash cycle. The caffeine comes from multiple sources, mak­ing it hard to tell how much the drinks contain. Some have B vitamins, which when taken in megadoses can cause rapid heartbeat, and numbness and tingling in the hands and feet. 
But the biggest worry is how some teens use the drinks. Some report downing several cans in a row to get a buzz, and a new study found a surprising number of poi­son-center calls from young people getting sick from too much caffeine. 
E. coli outbreak to ere ate future benefits 
New packaging will prevent contamination 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO -Like lab technicians on a crime­scene television drama, investigators have tracked a strain of bacteria over thou­sands of miles -from bagged spinach in Midwestern refrigerators to the guts of a wild pig in the hills of California's central coast. 
While they may never pin­point the exact source of the strain of E. coli blamed for killing three people and sick­ening more than 200, they have come closer than ever before. And experts say the investigation has yielded valuable clues for preventing future outbreaks. 
"We've completely over­hauled the way we test and 
package greens," said Samantha Cabaluna, a spokeswoman for Natural Selection Foods LLC, the company that packaged the tainted spinach. "Regardless of the source or method of contamination, we're better prepared to catch it." 
That's little solace to vic­tims and their families. 
"This was a long, convolut­ed story that took a long time to unfold," said Ken Costello, whose elderly mother-in-law was among those who died. 
The case started with scat­tered reports of people falling sick. A 6-year-old boy in Wisconsin had bad cramps. A 12-year-old girl in Kentucky was hospitalized with vomiting. An elderly woman died in Wisconsin. 

fish programs" in the region, Sam Flood, acting director of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, wrote in a letter to the federal agency. 
Dan Vogler, who raises rain­bow trout in Harrietta, about 30 miles south of Traverse City, said the order had taken away 70 percent of his customers. He sends live fish to other states for sale in restaurants and markets, and for stocking lakes and rivers. 
The virus hasn't been detect­ed on any fish farm in the Great Lakes region, Vogler said. Michigan has 4 7 fish farms, with combined sales of $2.4 million in 2005, according to the USDA. 
Greg Oswald, president of the Minnesota Aquaculture Association, sells his fathead minnows for sport fishing bait across the nation. He estimat­ed his business could lose $600,000 this year and more in 2007 if the interstate ban continues. 
Industry spokesmen said the ban could mean live bait short­ages and higher prices. 
Dealers who supply bait shops in Ohio buy about half their stock from other states, said Fred Snyder, an Ohio State University extension agent. Ohio's trout farmers get young fish to raise from other states. 
Meanwhile, trout farmers in Minnesota and Wisconsin have millions of pounds ready for stocking lakes elsewhere. 
"All of a sudden they can't move these fish," Snyder said. "These people are going to be financially devastated." 
The National Aquaculture Association, a fish farming trade group, asked the govern­ment for regulations to help prevent the virus from spread­ing, said its president, Randy MacMillan. He said the associ­ation didn't request the emer­gency order but understands the need. 
It could take the federal agency two or three months just to write interim rules, MacMillan said. "In the mean­time, the movement of poten­tially infected live fish would continue," he said. 

Trans fats significantly raise the level of so-called "bad" cholesterol in the blood, clog­ging arteries and causing heart disease. Researchers at Harvard's School of Public Health estimated that trans fats contribute to 30,000 U.S. deaths a year. 
"This is something we'd like to dismiss from our food sup­ply," said Dr. Robert H. Eckel, immediate past president of the American Heart Association. 
Wendy's, the national burger chain, has already switched to a zero-trans fat oil. McDonald's announced in 2003 that it intended to do so, but has yet to follow through. 
If approved, New York's ban would only affect restaurants, not grocery stores, and would­n't extend beyond the city lim­its. But experts said the city's food service industry, with 24,600 establishments, is so large that any rule change is likely to ripple nationwide. 
"It's going to be the trendset­ter for the entire country," said Suzanne Vieira, director of the culinary nutrition program at Johnson & Wales University in Providence, R.I. 
Richard Lipsky, a spokesman for the Neighborhood Retail Alliance, said many New York eatery owners rely on ingredi­ents prepared elsewhere, and aren't always aware whether the foods they sell contain trans fats. 
Consumer reaction remains to be seen. 
New Jersey state Sen. Ellen Karcher said her office was flooded with threatening phone calls after she proposed a simi­lar trans fat ban in early October. A proposed ban in Chicago was ridiculed by some as government paternalism run amok.

This past week White House Press Secretary Tony Snow announced that the Bush administration will no longer be using the phrase "stay the course" in regards to our Iraqi War strategy. This is clearly an interesting turn of events as "stay the course" has been hammered into our psyche for months and months, often in response to a recently released casualty or intelligence report which would seem to indicate that our cur­rent strategy is not working. This is par­ticularly interesting as "stay the course" was the Bush Administration's and also Bush supporters' means of contrasting their strategy to that of the Dmnocrats: the cowardly "cut and run" tactic. However, this reevaluation of strategy and semantics speaks to a larger phenomenon of tying complicated nuanced issues to as few words as possible and then repnating that phrase over and over until America believes that the issue is that simple. 
However, no issue facing America is simple enough to be reduced to a three or four word credo. The utter failure of the government to control the situation in Iraq and to come up with a feasible strat­egy for both Iraqi and American success deserves more than three words and obstinate, stubborn rhetoric whieh insists that ifwe simply keep doing what we're doing, we will win. This simplistic fa~ade that has repeatedly been presented to the American public is additionally reflected in a grossly insulting way through the midterm election campaign commercials that have begun to dominate television screens across the country. 
The ad campaigns have taken simpli(y­ing a message to a new low, simplifying the opponent's platform to a few mislead-ing words and atrocious analyses of posi­tions. For example, any stance which attempts to determine if there is a way to integrate already present illegal immi­grants into our society is automatically considered "amnesty." Any politician who agrees with President Bush the majority of the time is made out to be a puppet of the eurrent administration. Anyone who has evnr shaken the hand, as would bo the responsible thing to do when meeting someone of any kind of objectionable fig­urn, will undoubtedly have that picture induded in their opponent's campaign ad as if all opinions, issue stances and agen­das are magically transported from the questionable party to a eandidate through a simple handshake. 


Personally I'm sick of it. And even worso than my porsonal disdain for the lack or othies in political semanties these days is that thosn who are perpetrating these damaging, misleading, and ulti­mately usP!nss mnssagos are those who wo are lim:od to choose between. Each day we hear tho dirtiest and grossest mis­representations or candidatos' character and policies and ultimatnly one of them will win. What is being perpetuated is a cydo of distrust and loss of faith in politi­cians and while there certainly is no laek of seandals, ehnating, lying and incompe­tent roprosnntation in Congress, neither party should have to spend tens of mil­lions or dollars to point out their potential fi1r failuro as opposed to their own candi­dates' reasons fi>r inevitable success. 
What I propose is a contraet which obli­gates the m;~jority of a candidate's approvod ads to be positive. Call it the "Integrity in Campaigning Agreement." Essentially it would eurtail negative cam­paigning oflkially sponsored by candi­dates, by fim:ing them to spend more money and minutes of airtime on positive campaign ads than on negative cam­paigning. Such an agreement could be signed by the major candidates in any elm:tion and quite frankly would put the spotlight back on the candidate, their achievements and why they would be a good public oflicial. 
In addition, I hope that one day both the Hepublican and Democratic National Committees will collaborate and form a campaign oversight eommittee whose sole purpose is to analyze the daims of candi­dates and to diligently fact-eheck and explain the sources and details of each claim. Perhaps if there were a central non-partisan authority whose sole pur­pose is to bring truth back into politics, more Amerieans would have a better understanding of the politieal process, those who take part in it and what they a1:hieve. Maybe then more Americans would turn out to vote. 
Suc:h a committee will never be formed. But, hey, I ean dream. 
What it eomes down to is this: Americans deserve bettor than to have their vote courted by sound bites and catch phrases. Americans deserve better than gross misinterpretation of crucial stances on serious issues. Americans deserve better than the barrage of nega­tive eampaign eommerdals that flood their living rooms with doubt and anxiety over whether any eandidate is acceptable. It's time to bring truth and ethics back to the fornfront of political campaigns. It's time for Americans to demand something better. This midterm eleetion season, vote based on the faets -not based upon the distortions and oversimplilieations of issues inherently found in negative cam­paigning.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Support for 'Bras Around the Bend' display 
Bras for a cause 
In response to Lauren Galgano's "Downtown display inappropriate," I find her statements like a bra with no wire ­lacking support. 
She should really "push up" her opinion with some facts. One in eight women in the United States will be diagnosed with some form of breast cancer sometime in their life (American Cancer Association). This translates into about 212,920 women who will be found to have breast cancer this year, and about 40,970 of those women will have died from it. 
How can you bash a display that is intended to bring awareness and raise funds for research that can reduce the number of women dying every single year from breast cancer? 
This disease will even affect many of the women on the Notre Dame campus in one way or another. I am one of them. My mother is still in remission after being diagnosed with breast cancer three years ago. She is a women who all her life stressed about being a conservative, upstanding woman. After being diag­nosed, she quickly realized that there is no shame for her body. This is coming from a woman who was afraid to take her bra off for mammograms in front of a female nurse! After surgery, chemothera­py, radiation, hundreds of check ups, needing the help of her daughter to bathe, she is not ashamed -not ashamed of her bra or her breasts. 
Even more so, my family and I used humor to help her forget about the pain, about the sickness that came with chemotherapy, about the loss of her hair, about the trouble getting in and out of bed, about the struggle to get healthy so she can enjoy her life once again with her family. 
The "Bras Around the Bend" display does not have an underlying innuendo about sexuality. It is meant to raise awareness through something that helps thousands of individuals forget about their pain-through humor. And Lauren Galgano, if you cannot be mature enough to see beyond this display, then you are marginalizing the pain, the struggle, the love and the support of what that display means to hundreds of thousands of peo­ple.

Deep in the drink 
Last year, I attended a small, private col­lege in a middle-sized Iowa town. Students at this college drank, but the drinking was rarely out of control. When I transferred to Iowa State University, I was fully aware that the alcohol con­
Stephanie Eifler
sumption would increase, but I was completely oblivious Iowa State to its level of severity. University 
I don't drink. I Iowa State Daily never have and most likely never will. Although I don't under­stand or agree with the obsessive need for college students to drink in excess, I don't have a problem with students who choose to do so. That is, however, until I am disre­spected by intoxicated individuals who have lost control of themselves. Unfortunately at Iowa State, this happens more often than not. 
Although I may not drink, I am no stranger to parties. I don't mind making an appearance at a house or apartment burst­ing with friends who are consuming alco­hol because I can leave the party the moment I feel uncomfortable or annoyed. The problem begins when drunken individ­uals find their way into my residence hall. 
My residence hall is my home. I shouldn't have to want to escape my own home because drinkers lose control, but I do. On the weekends, it is normal for the hallways to be exceedingly loud at three or four in the morning when I am trying to sleep. 
When I finally ignore the noise long enough to drift away into my dreams, I am usually angrily woken up by an irritating fire alarm pulled by someone under the influence who thinks the stunt is absolutely hilarious. After descending down and climbing up nine flights of stairs in the wee hours of the morning, it becomes clear why I don't appreciate drinking in excess. 
On Saturday and Sunday mornings, I'm afraid to see or smell the interior of the elevators. Multiple times this semester, the elevator floors have been disgustingly caked with beer, vomit and garbage. After I try desperately not to touch anything in the elevator, the doors open to a main floor covered with ripped newspaper and more beer and garbage. 
By Sunday, my home is completely trashed by out-of-control drinking. I did nothing to contribute to the destruction, yet I suffer from the consequences. 
At my small, private college, the rules regarding drinking were strictly enforced. Because the rules were enforced, I was able to go to my own residence hall -my home -to escape the rowdy students. At Iowa State, little is done in the residence halls to prevent the destruction from drinkers. Instead, people seem to turn their heads and ignore the damage as if it's normal, acceptable behavior for 18-, 19­and 20-year-old underage drinkers. People act as if nothing ever happened. 
Something destructive does happen, however, every single weekend. For some, it may be entertaining to see their drunken accomplishments from the previous night's adventure. 
For me, it's not only frustrating but sick­ening as well. Obviously my choice to not drink makes me a minority among stu­dents at Iowa State, but I shouldn't be forced to suffer because of that choice. My choice is the legal choice, yet my home is destroyed. 
I understand underage drinking will hap­pen. After all, we are in college. I don't support drinking, but to an extent, I can accept its presence in my life. 
When my home and comforts are violat­ed, however, the line is crossed. Since I've arrived at Iowa State, I have constantly felt violated. I know I am not alone, but the only way the problem will be fixed is if it can no longer be ignored.

Sexual innuendo not goal in display 
I would like to respectfully dis­agree with a letter by fellow gradu­ate student Lauren Galgano in which she suggests that the "Bras Around the Bend" display in downtown South Bend is a wrong-headed and provocative attempt to use sex appeal to publicize a good cause. While I am not a big fan of much of the music played on U93 and think that many current pop and R&B hits objectify women and sex, I simply don't think that the radio station was implying a similar message with the "Bras Around the Bend" campaign (which is also cosponsored by LaSalle Bank and Unity Surgical Arts). 
Neither the advertisements I heard on the station nor the advertisement on its website carry any sort of sexu­al connotation. They simply say, donate a bra, and for each bra donated, monetary contributions will be made to RiverBend Cancer Services. They don't say bring your laciest, raciest bra so we can spice up the downtown scene (for a good cause). 
The website graphics include a simple pink ribbon, not a scantily clad lingerie model. As for Lauren's idea that bras themselves are a sex symbol and therefore make the dis­play inappropriate, I would have to reply that I think most anything can become a sex symbol if the viewer intends for it to be one. 
By stringing bras around trees and lightpoles, I don't think U93 or the town of South Bend is attempting to conjure up images of cleavage-bar­ing Victoria's Secret models. Instead, I think that the bra display intends and should bring to mind the mil­lions of women who are affected with breast cancer, many of whom have to deal with the physical and emotional side effects of having a mastectomy.

Exhausting Navy's options 
Irish score on five offirst six drives to overpower the Midshipmen rushing attack 

By ERIC RETTER 
Associate Sports Editor 
BALTIMORE -Notre Dame scored on five of its first six possessions, but that wasn't good enough for quarterback Brady Quinn. 
"[We wanted to go] six of six and make them all touch­downs," Quinn said after Notre Dame's 38-14 victory over Navy Saturday in Baltimore ­its 43rd straight over the Midshipmen. "That's our goal every time, especially when we're in the red zone." 
In the seven Irish possessions with Quinn in the game, Notre Dame scored six times -five touchdowns and one field goal. Notre Dame's only non-scoring drive during the stretch occurred when running back Darius Walker was stopped on a fourth-and-goal from the three-yard line at the start of the fourth quarter. 
"I think you see a lot of frus­tration on some guys when we don't score a touchdown when we're in the red zone," Quinn said. 
Notre Dame finished with 471 total yards on offense, and Quinn had another standout day for the Irish, completing 18-of-25 passes for 295 yards and three touchdowns. He also added a 19-yard rushing 
touchdown midway through the third quarter. 
"I thought [Quinn] played pretty darn well," Irish coach Charlie Weis said. "He's not [just] one of the best quarter­backs in college football, he's one of the best players in col­lege football." 
Notre Dame opened the game with a seven-play, 40-yard drive that resulted in a career­long 40-yard field goal by Carl Gioia. The possession -which stalled on the Navy 23 yard line -was the only Quinn­engineered drive that didn't advance into the red zone. 
It didn't take long for the Irish to fix that problem. 
Notre Dame pushed the score to 10-0 with on the following drive, as David Grimes capped off the possession with a 36­yard touchdown reception ­his first career score. Weis said the play was especially impor­tant because the Irish faced third and 18 at the time. 
"That early touchdown was a really big play in the game, because it was third and forev­er," Weis said. "I was hoping to just get some of it back so we could kick a field goal, but Brady stepped over to the left and saw him over there. 
000 
This is a couple games in a row now that [Grimes] is making some plays for us." 
Navy broke onto the score­

board on its second drive, marching 80 yards on nine plays using its patented triple­option attack. Quarterback Kaipo-Noa Kaheaku-Enhada finished the drive with a one­yard sneak. 
But Notre Dame responded with its own nine-play, 80-yard drive, when Travis Thomas ­who starts at linebacker ­scampered into the end zone from 16 yards out to make the score 17-7. 
The touchdown run was his first carry since a one-yard score against Penn State on Sept. 9. 
Notre Dame established its running game -which has been inconsistent for much of the season early on Saturday. The Irish ran the ball 37 times for 176 yards, com­pared with just 41 yards on 35 carries last week against UCLA. Quinn was sacked only once on Saturday, while UCLA got to him five times. 
Darius Walker led all rushers with 20 carries for 106 yards, his third 1 00-yard game of the season and the 11th of his career. 
"I was much more pleased with how things went in the running game," Weis said. "I think that across the board we were more physical at the line of scrimmage I had a lot
000 

more hardball runs where you go smash them in the mouth." 
Navy again replied to a Notre Dame score with a sustained drive, covering 65 yards in 13 plays. Kaheaku-Enhada fin­ished Navy's scoring drive with another one-yard touchdown run to make the score 17-14 with 2:43 left to play in the half. 
Notre Dame scored the final points of the half on its last possession. The Irish covered 80 yards in just 1:24 playing mostly out of the no-huddle, with a 33-yard touchdown pass from Quinn to receiver Rhema McKnight with 1:19 to go in the half giving the Irish a 24-14 advantage. 
It was the sixth time in eight games this season that Quinn has led the Irish to a score on their last possession of the first half. 
"Our entire offense is pretty comfortable with [the hurry-up offense]." Quinn said. "We've been used to coach Weis's style and philosophy for the past couple years now. I don't want to say it's a backbone for us, but we definitely feel comfort­able in the two minute [offense]." 
While effective offensively in the first half, Notre Dame struggled to stop Navy's option attack early in the game. The midshipmen picked up 211 of their 271 rushing yards in the first half, and they had a run­ning play of ten or more yards on nine separate occasions before the half. 
"You just got to get caught up with the speed of the game, how fast they're pitching that ball [and] getting outside," Irish safety Tom Zbikowski said. 
Notre Dame made adjust­ments at half time, limiting Navy's production in the sec­ond half and not allowing a score. Meanwhile, the Irish offense kept moving. 
Notre Dame put together a nine-play, 69 yard drive on its first second-half possession. capped off by Quinn's touch­down run. 
And after Walker failed to punch it in on fourth and goal from the two-yard line, Quinn responded with a six yard touchdown strike to McKnight to make the game 38-14 on the next possession. 
''I'm really happy to be leav­ing here the way things played out today," he said. "I was happy the way our defense sucked it up in the second half and played well. I thought the offense played pretty good most of the day and we're

A B+ A­B+ A­8­
B B 
B+ 
quarterbacks: Quinn was sharp all day, leading six long scoring drives in the eight possessions he was in the game. He threw three touchdown passes and ran for another. 
running backs: Walker bounced back from 
a bad game against UCLA with over 1 00 yards against Navy's undersized front. Aldridge ran out the dock, but found 
little garbage-time running room. 
receivers: Grimes had another 
impressive game, including a nice 
diving touchdown catch. McKnight 
and Carlson continued their 
productive seasons. 

offensive line: Notre Dame outmanned Navy at every position in the trenches, and it showed, but the line was not as dominant as it could have been against the smaller Midshipmen. 
defensive line: Tllis unit struggled early, but recovered and blew up several option plays before they got started, especially in the second half. They also recorded four sacks in only 11 Navy pass attempt<>. 
linebackers: This unit looked lost early, often leaving the pitch man wide open on the option. But like the rest ofthe defense, they recovered to shut out Navy in the second half. 
defensive backs: The secondary tackled 
well, especially Zbikowski and his 
team-high 14 stops. But it didn't step 
up to the line and stuff the option 
enough, especially when Navy ran it 
wide. 

special teams: Notre Dame's kick returns were solid and Gioia made hi<> only field goal attempt, but punt returns were com­pletely ineffective. The Irish also never punted. 
coaching: The offense was ruthlessly effi­cient, but the defense looked unprepared to stop the option, especially early. Second half adjustments worked, but not before Navy had two long TO drives. 

3.37 
overall: The Irish allowed a lot of yardage on the ground, but dominated offensively and adjusted defensively for the win.

Straight wins for the Irish over the Midshipmen. 
BAlTIMORE-If the 38-14 Irish vie­tory over Navy Saturday rna.llirmnd three things, they were as follows: quarterback Brady Quinn is pretty good, the Midshipmen ollense is pretty exciting and, most importantly, the Notre Dame fami­ly extends far beyond students and alumni. 
Let's start with the first point. Quinn put<; the Irish on his shoul­ders when it mat­ters most game after game. The quarterback wa<> poised against UClA when his team needed a late-game score, sur­prising nobody when he delivered under pressure. 
And Saturday, amidst questions regarding Notre Dame's offensive inconsistencies and lack ofa big play ability, he led the team to scoring drives on 5-of-6 possessions to start thn game. Two of his touchdown passes came on throws of 30 or more yards-:n yards to Rhema McKnight and 36 yards to David Grimes. 
"Sometimes you don't realize he is that good, but he continues to imprnss us each and every game," McKnight said ofQuinn after tlw game.

Thomas scores TD on only carry 
Running back-turned-linebacker shows he still loves the offensive side of the ball 

By BOB GRIFFIN Sports Writer 
BALTIMORE -If a statistic for red-zone rushing efficiency among linebackers exist­ed, Notre Dame senior Travis Thomas would be at the top ofthe list. 
Actually, he would be the only one on the list given his unique situation as a dual­threat running back-linebacker. The last two times Thomas, Notre Dame's starting strong side linebacker, has touched the ball as a running back-he has scored. 
"It's a return to what I do," Thomas said after the game Saturday. 'That's what I've done from the start, and it just feels natural tome." 
Thomas scored on a 16-yard off tackle run in the second quarter against Navy Saturday, his first carry since a two-yard score against Penn State Sept. 16. 
The senior linebacker -who still consid­ers himself a running back at heart -was limited to playing defense after suffering a rib injury against Michigan State. 
Irish coach Charlie Weis wanted Thomas to get healthy before giving him reps at run­rung back. Weis was more concerned about Thomas regaining speed and strength on the defensive side of the ball than getting him involved offensively. 
"He never really lost his spot, he was back into it this week because last week was his game to get back full time on defense," Weis said. "Thic; week I was able to flip it back over and practice him some on offense." 
And when Thomas' number was called to Notre Dame established the run early Dame's 14:29.

"He has certain plays he would be in in Notre Dame's 20-17 win over UCLA, not many reads they have as opposed to a for, that happened to be one of them."

Abiamiri, Wooden return to Baltimore 
Grimes scores first career touchdown; Aldridge gets late-game action; Vernaglia suffers injury 
By ERIC RETTER Associate Sports Editor 
BALTIMORE -Senior defen­sive end Vietor Abiamiri and senior cornerback Ambrose Wooden had the opportunity to play in front of their hometown crowd in Baltimore for the first time since joining the Irish Saturday. 
"It means a lot, especially being able to come home sen­ior year and play in front of the home crowd," Abiamiri said. "I had all my family and friends and extended family there in the crowd. I was only able to come up with 12 or 13 [extra tickets] but I had a lot more friends in the stands." 
Weis described Abiamiri ­who had four solo tackles and two sacks -as being especially "geeked up" the entire week leading up to the game. 
"Sometimes we forget, because we're sitting in South Bend, Ind., how special it is for guys to have games in their area in their country," Weis said. "He had adrenaline flow­ing all week long." 
+Saturday's sellout crowd of 71,851 at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore marked the 61st time in the previous 66 road games Notre Dame has played in front of a capacity atten­dance. 
"I think there's a strong fol­lowing [of Notre Dame on the East Coast]." Irish coach Charlie Weis said. "I think half of them might have been my family. 
+Quarterback Brady Quinn has not thrown an interception in his last four games -his last coming with 9:04 left in the first half of Notre Dame's 40-37 win at Michigan State Sept. 23. 
He now has 168 consecutive passes without an interception. He has four interceptions ­three of them coming on Sept. 11 against Michigan-com­pared with 21 touchdowns on the season. 
Weis jokingly knocked the wooden podium at his post­game press conference when asked about the recent streak. 
"He's a really good player, [and] we really haven't had a bad game since the one game [against Michigan] earlier in the year," Weis said. "There's a little-bit of luck sometimes involved. I don't think there were any balls that were close to being picked today, but we've had some balls that were close to being picked off [in the last few games.]" 
+Freshman running back James Aldridge had 10-plus carries for the first time in his career. He rushed for 33 yards on 12 fourth quarter carries. Aldridge -who missed much of the first half of the season with a knee injury -had four carries for 26 yards against Stanford Oct. 7. 
Coming into the game, Weis had hoped Aldridge would have opportunity to carry the ball between 10 and 15 times. 
"[We wanted] to start build­ing his stamina," he said. "Fortunately we got him in there and got him hit a little bit too, which is a good thing for him ... Now he's been hit a lit­tle bit, [and] it means that he'll physically and mentally keep on gaining some confidence." 
+ Sophomore wide receiver David Grimes' 36-yard touch­down reception in the first quarter was his first career touchdown. The reception was also the longest of his career. Grimes finished with three catches for 72 yards, and he now has 16 receptions for 206 yards this season. 

Weis said he is pleased with Grimes' progression over the last few weeks. 
"This is a couple games in a row now that he's making some plays for us," he said. 
+Freshman running back Munir Prince did not travel with the team to Baltimore. Weis would not give the specifics pertaining to Prince's absence. 
"Munir [Prince] didn't make the trip because he didn't deserve to be on the trip," Weis said. 
Prince has 12 carries for 21 yards this season. 
+Linebacker Anthony Vernaglia was injured on the kickoff return following Navy's first touchdown early in the second quarter, and did not return. Weis was not sure of the specifics of his injury imme­diately following the game. 
"He did something with his knee," Weis said. "I saw him wrapped with an ice bag at halftime."

SAILING AWAY 
A fired up Brigade marched on the field and made noise as Navy's crisp option attack kept the game close for a half. 
But Notre Dame's resurgent running game and efficient passing by Brady Quinn, who tossed three touchdowns and ran for another, allowed the Irish to score at will. Effective defensive adjustments shut down the option in the second half and Notre Dame pulled away for its 43rd consecutive victory over the Midshipmen -its fifth straight win since losing to Michigan Sept. 23.

The Fountain (Nov. 22, 2006) 
Fresh off "Hequiem for a Dream," a harrowing look at the shattered dreams of four drug addicts, Darren Aronofsky set out on a mission to film a science-fiction epic for Warner Bros. With Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett and a $75 million budget in tow, the talented young director was six to eight months away from creating his first mainstream masterpiece. 
That was in 2001. 
Five years later, the latest iteration of Aronofsky's undying passion project -"The Fountain" -is barely recognizable from the film it once was. But it still holds all the same promise. 
An imaginative tale of one man's thousand­year quest to find the Tree of Life and save the life of his beloved, "The Fountain" has been recast with enchanting leads Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. Although the budget was cut to $35 million -meager by the bloated standards of current Hollywood fare -Aronofsky put his burgeoning career on hold for years just to see this film through. 
Now that "The Fountain" is on the cusp of its final unveiling, a very simple question remains for Aronofsky. After his exhausting odyssey, will it have been worth it? The answer to that query lies with the lilm's ability to do more than just astonish the senses. It needs to resonate within hearts and minds. 
Blood Diamond (Dec. 15, 2006) 
Following yet another acclaimed turn in a Martin Scorsese picture, Leonardo DiCaprio will take on a more popcorn role in December's "Blood Diamond." He teams up with Jennifer Connelly and Djimon Hounsou ("The Island") in a story where DiCaprio, a greedy South African mercenary, enters into an unlikely alliance with Hounsou, a fisherman who has lost his family because of diamond mining, to obtain control of a rare diamond. 
The setting of civil war in Sierra Leone in the 1990s provides a social and political backdrop against which this action thriller will try to deliv­er a message. Early reviews of the film call it anywhere from award-winning material to another standard Hollywood blockbuster. Director Ed Zwick ("The Last Samurai," "Glory") has a penchant for creating movies that audi­ences either love or hate, and it appears this will be no different. It is almost certain, however, that the star power of DiCaprio will make "Blood Diamond" a highly watched and commercially popular movie, regardless of its critical success. 
Dreamgirls (Dec. 22, 2006) 
Academy Award-winner Bill Condon directs this film adaptation of the eponymous Broadway musical. "Dream Girls" follows three talented soul singers, forming "The Dreamettes," on their rise to success in the 1960s and 70s music indus­try. The trio, consisting of Deena {Beyonee Knowles), Lorrel (Anika Noni Hose) and lead singer Effie (Jennifer Hudson), receives its big break when the singers are discovered by talent manager Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx). 
As "The Dreamettes" start to gain in notoriety, Curtis Taylor Jr. exercises increasing power over the group's musical direction. The girls struggle with the changes made in exchange for success, eventually jeopardizing the group's survival. 
"Dreamgirls" promises to be an intriguing film, full of spectacular music, a talented east and the feel-good ideal that dreams do live forever. 
Rocky Balboa (Dec. 22, 2006) 
Sixteen years after "Rocky V," the Italian Stallion steps back into the ring for what's been billed as "one final round." "Rocky Balboa" fol­lows the titular character (Sylvester Stallone), who challenges young fighter Mason "The Line" Dixon (Antonio Tarver) in an exhibition round. With Adrian dead, the heart and soul of the series may have gone out of Stallone's beloved franchise, and it may be hard for "Hoeky Balboa" to recreate the financial and critical success of the initial 1977 release. 
Sylvester Stallone wrote this 111m along with "Rocky," and he is also returning to the director's chair. However, his creative capacity may have gone the way of the dodo as he gets on in years. Unless he can find the next inspirational song to pair up with great cinematics (''The Eye of the Tiger" with the now famous steps scene), this one will not stand up to the greats of this fran­chise. Nonntheless, an early Christmas present may in the works from one of America's most beloved stars and hearing that familiar Bill Conti theme in the trailer is enough to get any Rocky enthusiast pumped to cheer one last time for the ultimate underdog. 
Children of Men (Dec. 25, 2006) 
The eagerly anticipated futuristic drama by director Alfonso Cuar6n ("Y Tu Mama Tambien," "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban") has already garnered early award buzz. Based on the novel by P.O. James, "Children of Men" stars Clive Owen as Theodore Faron and envisions a future in which women are no longer able to bear children. When Faron discovers a pregnant woman, he tries to help her escape to a sanctu­ary at sea that may preserve humanity. 
The obvious Christian allegory may generate some controversy as this film is set to debut on Christmas Day. However, "Children of Men" comes just in time for this year's Oscar nomina­tions, something the producers surely had in mind. Cuar6n may be looking for his break into the inner circles of Hollywood and Owen is assuredly hunting for the Best Actor statuette. Supported by Julianne Moore and Michael Caine, "Children of Men" promises to be one of the more interesting films released this winter.

NFL 

New England at Minnesota 
8:30 p.m., ESPN 


Associated Press 
WALTHAM, Mass. ­Boston Celtics coach Doc Rivers called his players together before practice to talk to them about Red Auerbach. It was too late to get to know him, but important that the players understood what he meant to the team, the city, the game. 
Older players had seen Auerbach's fire for them­selves-both the competi­tive one and the flame at the end of his ever-present cigar -but didn't know how he defined the game early on, then continued to dominate as his players became coaches and gen­eral managers running teams of their own. For the rookies, who never got a chance to meet him, it was a lesson about the franchise icon who trav­eled across New England to preach about the young NBA and build a mystique that would come to be known as Celtic pride. 

"I wanted our young guys to hear those sto­ries," Rivers said following practice Sunday, a day after Auerbach's heart failed him at the age of 89. "I don't think they knew a lot about him." 
A young team with an average age under 25, several of the current players were infants when the Celtics won the last of their NBA-record 16 championships in 1986. None of them was born yet in Auerbach's heyday, when as coach and then general manager he led Boston to eight consecu­tive titles. 
But what Rivers wanted to talk about wasn't what the Celtics did but what they looked like doing it; more precisely, it was the fact that Auerbach didn't care what they looked like. He drafted the NBA's first black player, hired its first black coach and fielded its first all-black starting five, and he did it in racially combustible Boston. 
"Red did all that, but he wasn't doing that because he was trying to break ground," Rivers said. "His response was always: 'I'm trying to win a game and that's who I think gives us the best chance.' I think his example spread throughout the league." 
The message got through, Celtics captain Paul Pierce said. 
"I don't think a lot of these guys even knew that before Doc said it today," he said. "I think these guys really have to under­stand the history of the game. And Red is a big part of the history of the whole NBA -not just the Celtics, but the whole NBA." 
IN BRIEF 
Man arrested for murder 
of former boxing champ 
KINGSTON, Jamaica-A 20-year­old man was arrested in connection with the killing of former heavy­weight champion Trevor Berbick, who was bludgeoned and left to die in a church courtyard next to his family's home in a rural hamlet. 
Several residents of the remote farming community in Norwich dis­trict said the suspect was involved in a land dispute with the troubled boxer. 
Les Green, a Scottish detective who this year was appointed assis­tant police commissioner of the vio­lence-wracked nation, refused to identify the man before his arraign­ment, which has not been sched­uled. 
"We have some very good infor­mation from witnesses, and we have recovered a weapon we believe was used in the assault," he said Sunday. 

A's to interview internal 
candidates, Hershiser 
OAKLAND, Calif. -The Oakland Athletics have scheduled interviews with their two internal candidates about the club's managerial opening. 
Bench coach Bob Geren is set to meet with general manager Billy Beane and other team officials Monday, then third-base coach Ron Washington will follow Tuesday. 
Beane also has an interview set up with Orel Hershiser, currently an ESPN baseball analyst, in Phoenix for sometime the following week. 
Beane fired fourth-year manager Ken Macha on Oct. 16, two days after Oakland's season ended in a sweep by the wild-card Detroit Tigers in the AL championship series. The A's won a playoff series for the first time since 1990, ending a string of four straight first-round exits from 2000­03. 
Beane has other business aside from finding Oakland's next manager. 
Federer wins fourth in a 
row at Swiss Indoors 
BASEL, Switzerland -Roger Federer beat Fernando Gonzalez 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (3) Sunday to win his fourth straight title and 11th of the year at the Swiss Indoors. 
The top-ranked Federer hit a fore­hand return for a winner on the first point of the third-set tiebreaker and cruised from there to win his home­town tournament for the first time in seven attempts. 
Federer overpowered the defending champion, hitting 14 aces and break­ing Gonzalez's serve three times. 
"It is indeed magnificent," Federer said the event he used to work as a ball boy. "Different countries, differ­ent titles, they all have a different meaning. Winning Basel, my home tournament, it's one of those moments I'll never forget." 
The final was a rematch of last week's Madrid Masters final, also won by Federer in three sets.

Belles knocked out of playoffs by Kalamazoo 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 
The season came to a dramat­ic end for the Belles Saturday afternoon as they lost 4-3 in a shootout in the first round of the MIAA playoffs. 
Fifth-seed Kalamazoo came in to the game as an underdog to the fourth-seed Saint Mary's club. After 110 minutes of score­less play, the Hornets buried four of their five penalty kicks to advance to the semi-final against the Calvin Knights. 
"We were obviously disap­pointed because we all played so hard," senior captain Colleen Courtney said. "But we were happy with how well we played." 
Senior defender Kari Brodsky scored the final goal to break a 3-3 tie and end the Belles' sea­son. 
Kalamazoo jumped out to a 2­0 lead in the shootout when shots from Ashley and Laura Hinton both missed wide right. 
Kelly Lepper, Jenn Russart and Paige Howell rounded out the scoring for the Hornets in the first three rounds. Senior goalkeeper Laura Heline made a diving save on the fourth shot, 
giving the Belles a  chance to  
stay in the game.  
Courtney  and  freshman  

Bridget Ronayne had scored for Saint Mary's at that point, giving Heline an opportunity to tie the game as she came out of the goal to take the team's final attempt. 
"I wanted to be in that spot and I knew I was going to score because we deserved to win," Courtney said. 
She converted but was unable to make the final save to send the contest into sudden death. 
1-Ieline, who started all but two games in her four-year career, finished the game with eight saves for the Belles. She is one of six seniors who played their final game at Saint Mary's Saturday. 
1-Ieline, along with fellow tri­captains Courtney and senior Ashley Hinton, end the year with a 5-8-2 record because the loss was technically considered a tie. Caroline Stancukas, Nicole Leach and Sarah Budd round out the senior class. 
"We had a lot of freshman this year and I think that we showed them how important team unity is. I hope that they can continue that next season and in the future, " Courtney said. 
She had one of the teams five shots on net during regulation. Ashley Hinton -who had 24 shots on goal during the regular season -led the team with two on Saturday. Freshmen Colleen Ferguson and Micki Bedinger had the other two shots but opposing goalkeeper Kassandra Johnston was true to the task on all five shots. 
Head coach Caryn Mackenzie had her first losing season with the Belles in her third year with the program. The team went 10­6-1 in 2004 and 11-7-1 last year.

Adrian narrowly manages to hold off host Saint Mary's 
By MICHAEL BRYAN Sports Writer 
The Belles fell just short of a stunning comeback Saturday, los­ing to visiting Adrian 3-2 at the Angela Athletic Center. 
The win improved third-place Adrian's MIAA record to 12-4 (17­8 overall). Saint Mary's dropped to 9-7 in conference play (16-9 over­all). The Belles finished the regu­lar season in fourth place in the MIAA. 
The Bulldogs took control of the beginning of the match and won the first two games 30-22 and 30­
28. But when it looked like Adrian would cruise to victory, Saint Mary's stormed back, taking the third game 30-26. 
The Belles then fought off match point in the fourth game to win 32-30 and send the match to a fifth and deciding game. 
After chipping away at an early Bulldog lead in the fifth game, Saint Mary's closed to within a point before falling 15-13 in the clincher. 
The match was the Belles' sec­ond five-set match in a row -the first came with a 3-2 win Tuesday over Tri-State. 
"We were definitely disappoint­ed by the final result," Belles coach Julie Schroeder-Biek said. "But even though we lost the match, we cannot let the outcome overshadow all of the positives. We fought hard with incredible spirit and talent." 
Junior Lindsay Eshelman led Adrian with a match-high 24 kills and nine digs. Senior Abby Sikora also turned in a strong perform­ance with 28 digs and 66 assists.

The Bulldogs will face off against Tri-State in the first round of the MIAA tournament Tuesday. 
For the Belles, Kristen Playko posted her 19th double-double of the season with 23 kills and 20 digs. Libera Anne Cusack led the way defensively with a match-high 32 digs. 
"The comeback and intensity we showed was just the beginning," Schroeder-Biek said. "We need to carry over that same determina­tion into the conference tourna­ment." 


St. Mary's will begin play Tuesday in the MIAA Tournament against fifth-seeded Alma. The Belles split the regular season match-up, winning 3-0 at home Oct. 8 and falling 3-1 at Alma. 
Coach Schroeder-Biek said the team is looking forward to the match. 
"We are definitely excited to be hosting the first round," she said. "This will be a tough match, but we have to have teamwork and desire to win, and we are ready to compete."

Hope, Carthage down Belles in dual meets 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Editor 

Saint Mary's lost two dual meets this weekend -a close conference contest to Hope and a lopsided away match with Carthage. 
The Flying Dutch swam past the Belles at the Rolfs Aquatic Center 132-112 Friday, and the Lady Reds kicked their way to an easy 121-79 victory over the Belles at the Koenitzer Aquatic Center in Kenosha, Wise. Saturday. 
In the first of Saint Mary's two contests, Hope won nine of the meet's 11 events. Flying Dutch freshman Kate Williams led the way, capturing two titles -the 50-yard freestyle (26.15) and the 1 00-yard butterfly (1 :01.46). 
But there were a few bright spots for the Belles. Saint Mary's won both 200-yard freestyle relays over the weekend. 

The combination of freshmen Sara Niemann and Lindsey Nelis, sophomore Melissa Gerbeth and junior Kelly Tighe captured 18 points, finishing in 1:48.89. 
The following day, the group won their event again over Carthage. 
Saint Mary's also captured indi­vidual breaststroke events both days. Tighe took first in the 100 breaststroke against llopn with a time or 1:16.69, and sophomore Katie Carroll won the 200-yard discipline against Carthage in 2:46.48. 
The Belles had two other win­ners against Carthage. Sophomore Mellissa Gerbeth won the 1,000-yard freestyle in 11:16:49, and Nelis took the 200­yd freestyle in 2:06.92.

Irish leave 


A&M In 
their vvake 
By GREG ARBOGAST Sports Writer 

No. 17 Notre Dame made a big splash in its first dual meet of the season, beating Texas A&M 169­129 Saturday at the Student Recreation Natatorium in College Station. 
The Irish won nine of the 16 events, and took three of the five scoring spots in 12 of the 14 non­relay events. 
Sophomores Jeff Wood and Sam Pendergast, who each picked up two wins in their first dual meet performances for Notre Dame, led the Irish. 
Wood, a transfer from Indiana, won the 100 and 200-meter back­stroke. Pendergast, who didn't compete in a meet during his fresh­man season, finished first in the 100 and 200-meter breaststroke. 
Irish assistant head coach Matt Tallman was not surprised at the breakout performances of his two sophomores. 
"It was the reason they were brought here," Tallman said. "It was expected, and we hope to see a lot more ofit." 
Wood and Pendergast were also part of the victorious 200 medley­relay team that included seniors Tim Kegelman and Louis Cavadini. Kegelman also tallied a victory in the 100-meter butterfly. 
Junior Jay Vanden Berg (1000­meter freestyle), senior Ted Brown (200-meter freestyle) and freshman John Lytle (100-meter freestyle) also picked up first-place finishes. 
Lytle's performance offered a preview of what Tallman hopes to be strong performances from the freshman class this season. 
"Our freshman class is -top to bottom -one of the best classes we've ever had, and it's the best class we've ever had on paper," Tallman said. 
"We're just glad they dove in and turned what they do in practice into racing." 
Tallman also credited the team's hard work in training as a contri­bution to Notre Dame's perform­ance on Saturday. 
"The guys have worked real hard since they got on campus at the end of August, especially since we started official practice in September," Tallman said. "They've been waiting for this day, and they put it all together." 
The Irish will return home Friday to face Purdue in their next dual meet at the Rolfs Aquatic Center.

Irish extend losing streak 
Team falls to Big East's Louisville, Cincinnati 
By DEVIN PRESTON 
Sports Writer 
The Irish couldn't halt their downward spiral weekend this weekend. 
Two conference losses rounded out the team's longest losing streak since Sept. 2004. Falling to Cincinnati (17-5, 7-3 Big East) and Louisville (16-6, 9-1 Big East), the Irish (13-10) are now one of three teams in the Big East with a record of 7-3. 
Notre Dame has lost its last nine games, and was swept on three consecutive occasions. Previously Notre Dame had not lost three games of a con­ference match since Nov. 2004. 
Cincinnati 3, Notre Dame 0 
Freshman Christina Kaelin led the effort against the Bearcats with 13 kills in the 
20-30, 22-30, 28-30 loss. 
Cincinnati won the final game in the same fashion that they won the first. Putting six unanswered points up right from the start, Cincinnati would not lose its lead for the entire game. 
Notre Dame attempted to gain control late in the game with a 7-2 run, coming within four points of Cincinnati. This was not enough to fend the Bearcats off, and in the end, a kill from sophomore Jessie Nevitt sealed the match. 
Sophomore Mallorie Croal tallied six blocks and 10 kills at a hitting percentage of .261 for Notre Dame. She was also second on the team with 13 digs. Senior Danielle Herndon led the Irish with 22 digs. 
Freshman Jaime Frey led the Cincinnati defense with 33 digs. 
Louisville 3, Notre Dame 0 
Mallorie Croal and sopho­more Justine Stremick each recorded ten kills in the 30-14, 30-22, 30-19 loss to Louisville. 

The Irish worked well to keep up with the Cardinals in the third match, but a kill from freshman Tatyana Kolesnikova kicked off an 8-2 run for Louisville that Notre Dame was unable to recover from. 
A final kill from senior Stephanie Marsh ended Louisville's sweep of Notre Dame. 
Croalled the team with eight digs. The Notre Dame defense, which averages 17.5 digs per game only averaged 11.3 digs per game in their match against the Cardinals. This effort was not nearly enough to contain Kolesnikova's 19 kills, which she hit at a per­centage of .692. Louisville as a team out hit Notre Dame .476 to .169. 
Co-captain Adrianna Stasiuk, who is the team points leader at 4.06 points per game did not play in either match this weekend.

since 1998, when they won their first six games. 
Christian Hanson, who was named the tournament MVP, scored the game-winner three minutes into the sec­ond period when he tapped in a rebound off of a Jason Paige shot. 
Paige increased the lead to 2-0 less than 10 minutes later when he beat Air Force 
goalie Ian Harper with a wrist shot on an Irish power play. 
Harper finished with 23 saves on the night. Opposing him in net, Brown was able to stop all 28 of the Falcons' shots. 
The senior netminder suf­fered an ankle injury in a CCHA playoff game with Alaska-Fairbanks last March, but he has had no troubles this season after a summer of rehab. 
"He's playing extremely well and I want to make sure 

he continues to do so, Jackson said. "I need to give him a break once in a while." 
Brown had the night off on Friday night when Notre Dame blanked Army 3-0 to reach the tournament cham­pionship. Sophomore Jordan Pearce was between the pipes for the Irish and had seven saves in his first start in 2006. 
Freshman Ryan Thang started off the scoring at

in a por­tion of an interview that CBS made available on Yahoo.com. "And when people don't meet that criteria, they're in my door ... and that's an unpleasant situa­tion.... And when it comes to practice, I do my best to try to humiliate them in front of their teammates that they don't go to class." 
Kroft called Weis an "offen­sive genius" and an exception­al motivator who was brought into a program that had suf­fered two consecutive "miser­able seasons." 
"At 6-foot-1, 300-pounds, his girth is exceeded only by his super-size personality that seems out of place at a univer­sity run by the Holy Cross Fathers," Kroft said. 
When Kroft quoted 
Philadelphia Eagles eoaeh Andy Heid saying that Weis must spend a lot of time in confession, University President Father John Jenkins offered his opinion from the roof of the Hesburgh Library. 
"I've heard foul language in football locker rooms before," 
Jenkins

On Oet. 3, Wnis said he would talk about the segment only during Notre Dame's bye week. Wlwn Weis did talk, one week later, he kept his com­ments to a minimum. 
"What happened was they did a special on Tommy Brady last year," Weis said. "Steve (Kroft! became intrigued by me. As the year went on, he deeided he wanted to do something. We started about eight months ago doing little parts of this." 
CBS promoted the segment with a series of commercials that aired over the weekend during NCAA and NFL football games and included the clips

Although it didn't all'oct Hollas' shot, the wind would turn out to be a big factor all evening for both teams. 
It was a difficult night to play, Irish coach Bobby Clark said. 
"We played superbly with the wind in our faee in the first half, but we didn't really eapitalize with the wind at our backs in the second half," he said. 
Notre Dame outshot Hutgers 9­4 in the first half and would take their one goal lead into the lock­er room at halftime. 
But the Irish weren't able to hold that lead. 
The Scarlet Knights found their equalizer in the 80th minute on the first of Sternberger's two goals. Rutgers' midlielder Kyle Grato sent a free kick through the Irish wall, and although Notre Dame keeper Chris Cahill made the save, Sternberger was there to put the rebound into the net. 
"1\venty-six minutes and almost two overtimes later, Sternberger scored again to book the Scarlet Knights ticket to the semi-finals. Another dead ball proved to be the lri"sh 's undoing as Sternberger got onto the end of a Zach Simi corner kick firing home at the back post. 
Although Notre Dame held a slim 13-12 advantage in shots on the evening, the Searlet Knights out-shot the Irish 8-4 in the see­ond half and overtime periods. Notre Dame didn't register a shot in either of the overtime periods. 
"We played very well in the first half, but we felt we should have been able to put the game away in the second half," Clark said. "We played well without generating a lot of chances in the overtimes. It wasn't like they were handling us in the overtime periods." 
Saturday evening was the sec­ond time in the last four games that the Irish were unable to hold an early one-goal lead. Notre Dame was also ahead of No. 4 West Virginia 1-0 at half­time on Oct. 18, but the Mountaineers scored two-second half goals to seal the victory. 
The Irish will return home with nearly two weeks to pre­pare for the first round of the NCAA tournament which begins on Friday, Nov. 10. Clark sees this break as an advantage for his team. 
"[Losing to Rutgers] might prove to be a blessing in dis­guise," Clark said. "We've played a game every 3.3 days since Aug. 17, and that's a lot of games. I think the break will give us an opportunity to recharge our bat­teries, and hopefully the boys will take advantage of that."

EUGENIA LAST
HOROSCOPE 
CELEBRITIES BORN ON THIS DAY: Amit Paul, 23; Ben Foster, 26; Kate Jackson, 58; Richard Dreyfuss, 59 
Happy Birthday: You have to go the distance if you want to get results. Don't stop halfway or give up because of the obstacles you've faced. The past year has been a learning experience. Your numbers are 6, 24, 25, 29, 33, 41 
ARIES (March 21-April19): You can utilize everything you've learned in the past and impress everyone you deal with today. Your kindness and generosity will bring you good returns. Your intuition will not let you down. 4 stars 
TAURUS (Aprii20-May 20): It's not the best day to face the music or to try to get someone's attention. You are better off working on your ideas a little longer and avoiding conflict with the ones you love. 2 stars 
GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Take a serious look at your past, present and future and decide what it will take to reach a lifelong goal. It's never too late to learn something new or to make a move that will benefit you. Be honest with yourself. 5 stars 
CANCER (June 21-July 22): This is the perfect day to bond--but remember, you don't have to go into debt to do so. Simplicity will be the key. Take the time to find out what everyone you care about is up to before you start. 3 stars 
LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Be careful --someone you live with may try to bait you into an argument. Honesty will be the most important factor when it comes to relationships. Like it or not, the truth must be told if you want to move on to better times. 3 stars 
VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Everything should be about your home and family today. Try to make alterations that will free up your time and allow you to make your place more comfortable and user-friendly. Love is looking very good. 5 stars 
LIBRA (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): You may want to avoid emotional issues by throwing yourself into your work. Take a look at your past goals and consider if you have come close to meeting them. 2 stars 
SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Don't let anyone tell you what you can and can't do. If someone is putting restrictions on you, consider if this relationship is really to your benefit. At some point you have to rely on yourself and go it alone. 2 stars 
SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): A little pleasure trip will take you a million miles away mentally. You need a bit of a change to set your mind free. Distance yourself from everyone who is trying to push you one way or another. 4 stars 
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Don't trust what others tell you, especially if it has to do with the way you earn money. You have to judge for yourself. Now is not the time to trust anyone with your future. 3 stars 
AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): You won't be able to make a good decision, so don't bother trying. Travel and communications will end in delays and disasters. 3 stars 
PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): If you come into something special like a winning, gift or other means of fast cash, keep it to yourself. A problem with someone older is likely to spoil your day if you let it. Don't give in to the demands of others. 3 stars 
Birthday Baby: You are captivating, charismatic and, above all, compassionate. You show an interest in everything but know how to focus on what's important.

CBS features Weis in Sunday's '60 Minutes'

Irish coach profiled by Kroft on news program 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Editor 

Charlie Weis often says he's a straight talker and "brutally honest" -and he furthered that image in a CBS "60 Minutes" feature that aired Sunday Night. 
In a segment by longtime reporter Steve Kroft, Notre Dame's second-year coach said he does not care what people out-See Also side his fami­

nor believe 
Irish Insider 
that any coach will do a better job for his team than he does. 

"You only feol the pressure if you really care what everyone else thinks," Weis said. "And I don't eare what anyone thinks." 
The 15-minute segment, which aired on CBS affiliate WSHT-TV (Comcast channel 12) and began at 7:57 p.m., high­lighted Weis' use ol' foul lan­guage on the tield and in prac­tice, including a clip of Weis screaming at Irish special teams coach Brian Polian to "get the I expletive) off the field" and complaining about a "buil­l oxpletive I eall." 
At one point, Weis complains to an assistant coach about a blown blocking assignment. 
"We've got a defensive end and we've got two tight ends and we don't touch the mother­lexpletivel," Wnis said. 
Irish quarterback Brady Quinn said Weis can be a jerk at times, a comment the senior said he would never repeat to Weis' face.

By TIM DOUGHERTY Sports Writer 

While the rest of America was falling back Sunday, sophomore forward Brittany Bock sprung forward ­knocking in two headers to lead Notre Dame over St. John's 3-0 in the Big East quarterfinals at Alumni Field. 
Bock netted her two scores within the first few minutes of the match on set pieces that found her in the box. 
In the seventh minute, Michele Weissenhofer's flip throw-in landed softly on Bock's head before the for­ward touched it over the
