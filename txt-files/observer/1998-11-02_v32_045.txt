Push-ups 
Prohibited­

ball game in person  Scott Hardy

unique experience that  

simply cannot be duplicated by watching at 
home. 
I was especially entreated this weekend, having attended the Notre Dame versus Baylor game. From my vantage point, I was in for a show. I refer to the curious behavior of students and ushers, as they battled for expression and order, respectively. 
I was not sitting in the student section. I was in the first row of section 108 (upper sec­tion, 35-yard-line), and, as always, those around me were engaging in push-ups to cel­ebrate each of Notre Dame's points whenever the Irish added to their total. Apparently, an usher had asked us to stop, but only a couple of us heard her, and we "forgot" to tell the others. ­
During the second half, when Notre Dame totaled its score to 27, the urge to have one of us undertake this many push-ups was too much to resist. The urge, coupled with the effective pleading of an elementary school student standing behind us "Can I please do push-ups next?" easily overturned the usher's earlier ruling, which was n·ot even heard by those who were to engage in the push-up assistance for this young man. Having begun the push-ups, the usher who had told us to stop came running from two sections down to put an end to our celebra­tion. 
We watched in amazement as the usher did this; for we could see our mostly undergradu­ate_ counterparts across the stadium finishing their 27 push-ups. Next, we watched as the leprechaun completed his push-ups, with the assistance of the cheerleaders. Someone from high above cried out "Go yell at the lep­rechaun!" Laughter ensued. 
Why, when there were hundreds of stu­dents similarly engaged across the stadium, and when we have ocupied ourselves with these post-scoring push-ups unthwarted in all home games past, did this usher feel the need to impede our fun, when nobody was in danger, and no harm was being done? I am not sure. Probably for the same unknown reason which caused many ushers to line up in a human chain across the bottom of the student section at game's end, preventing an inevitable rush of the field by a majority of the student body. 
I cannot fathom a reason for these restric­tions, and they do not seem justified, as they hinder the students' ability to express fully their deep love and support of the Notre Dame football team, along with their joy resulting from a Notre Dame victory. To be sure, these actions are not without any safety hazard. However, one must consider that every time you cross the street, you are tak­ing your life in your hands. The actions of the ushers in games past were far more reason­able, when the ushers assisted those who decided.to rush the field as they descended from the stands. When the authority acts unserisibly, as I feel the ushers did in this instaI)ce, they can expect their actions to be requited only with disobedience. Therefore, I suggestyou stop, look, and listen. Then rush the field.

STANFORD, Calif. 
On Jan. 6, Hua Di, a Chinese mis­sile expert and senior research asso­ciate at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford, was arrested in Beijing for allegedly revealing state secrets. 
Information on the arrest was not made public until this week. 
A permanent resident of the United States, Hua went to Beijing to attend memorial services for his mother, father, and brother-in-law, all of whom died during Hua's nine-year stay in the United States. 
Hua had been at Stanford working with the center since 1989. The cen­ter is a consortium of scholars and former policy makers from the United States and many foreign countries who conduct unclassified research on current global security problems. 
Emeritus Professor John Lewis of the Institute for International Studies said in a statement that Hua "went to China with full assurances from the Ministry of State Security that he would be OK. He was well aware of the possibility of charges being lev­eled against him while he was in the United States, so he went to Hong Kong in September last year and was given a thorough clearance by the Ministry of State Security." 

Hua has authored several articles on Chinese security policy regarding such topics as-China's ballistic mis­sile program. He also worked with Lewis, head of the center's Project on Peace and Cooperation in the Asian­Pacific Region, on a history of China's missile program, which was pub­lished in1992. 
Many of Hua's colleagues have written the Chinese government requesting his immediate release and arguing Hua's innocence. 
According to a statement released by Provost Condoleezza Rice, "Professor Lewis has provided evi­dence of the fact that the source materials for publications written by him and Mr. Hua all either were pro­vided by approved Chinese authori­ties or already were available through the Stanford University library." 
Scott Sagan, the co-director of the center, expressed his view that Hua's research has, in fact, increased international security and coopera­tion. 

Ill HARVARD UN!VERST!Y Computerized GMAT produces error 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 
Upon finishing the computerized version of the Graduate Management Assessment Test (GMAT) between October 12 and 21, 400 test takers received an unexpected error message instead of their scores. Despite the surprising message, the tests were not affected. "This turned out to be a display error, not a data collection error," said Educational Testing Service (ETS) spokesperson Kevin Gonzalez. A total of 10,000 peqple took the computer adaptive test (CAT) version of the GMAT, which is taken by business school applicants, during the two-week peri­od. Gonzalez said scores were not affected by the error, and test-takers had the option of manually canceling their scores. The test takers received a hard copy" of their scores_ within 10 days. Previously, a software glitch occurred with the GMAT on a December 1997 test. "A small percentage of test takers [were affected]," Gonzalez said.

__ MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. 
Three student services fees.'."funded groups will attempt for a third time to join the University's side in a fawsuit against the fees system in a hearing before a U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals three-.iudge panel. Lawyers on both sides say the outcome of the Nov. 20 hearing could have a significant impact on the case. In February, five students filed suit against the University, claiming their First Amendment rights are violated ·because student services fees funct groups who engage in political and ideological activities. The La Raza Student Cultural Center, the Queer Student Cultural Center and University YW student groups were specifically named in the law­suit. The groups have since tried to join the University's side of the suit to protect what they say are their First Amendment rights to free speech. Jordan Lorence, the plaintiffs' attorney, said the student groups have a signif­icant free speech argument. 
ti MICHIGAN STATE UN!VERS!TY Fraternities investigate Rohypnol use 
EAST LANSING, Mich. 

As two MSU fraternities are conducting internal investi­

Rohypnol, the MSU and greek communities are on guard 
against further incidents. East Lansing police are investi­
gating at least one case of a woman being slipped some

DeKorte said. One case may have involved sexual assault, 
WXYZ (Channel 7) in Detroit reported Thursday on its 11

·these allegations are found to be true, the police will intervene and the individuals will be sent through the judicial process." Both fraternities are conducting their own investigations. 
l\i AMERlCAN U!\HVEHSITY ACLU recognized as a student club 
WASHINGTON, D.C. 

The AU chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union 
experienced some problems with registering as an official 
club recently because of university regulations regarding 
lobbying, said Jarrett Perlow, the president of the AU 
ACLU. On Oct. 8, after a month of delay and a modifica­
tion of its charter, the organization was finally recognized 
as an AU student club, said Perlow, a junior in the College 
of Arts and Sciences. The delay was caused when the 
Office of Student Activities' Recognition Committee, which 
is in charge of reviewing club charters, questioned a 
clause in the group's original charter. As a result of that 
inspection, the AU ACLU found out that it cannot lobby, he 
said. Perlow said he was contacted by Johnette Ruffner, 
coordinator for student clubs and organizations, and 
asked to clarify a certain phrase in their charter. The 
dubious sentence was included in the "purpose" section of 
the· charter.

Additionally, graduates of women's colleges are twice as likely to earn their doctoral degrees or enter medical school. Another draw for prospective students considering a women's college is that women who gradu­ate from all-female colleges earn median salaries $8,000 higher than those earned by women who graduate from coed institu­tions. 
The challenge for the College now is seeking out the two per­cent of high school students who are initially interested in attend­ing a women's college, Briggs said. ·

Ads anger hog farmers 
RALEIGH, N.C. 
The state Democratic Party pulled a televi­
sion adcritical of Republican Sen. Lauch 
Faircloth after hog farmers complained that 
it sullied their reputation. The ad reminded 
voters of a 1996 liquid sweet potato spill at 
Faircloth's cattle farm in which thousands of 
fish died. Said the announcer: "Lauch 
Faircloth ... polluting our rivers ... voting to 
protect the polluters." Although the spill 
involved Faircloth's cattle operation, the ad 
featured pictures of pigs. Barbara Allen, the 
state Democratic chairwoman, confirmed 
Saturday that the party had pulled the ad 
after being contacted by several hog produc­
ers who were also Democratic Party contrib­
utors. "We have such loyal supporters who 
arc farmers who are doing the right thing in 
protecting the environment," Allen said. "So 
we pulled it." 
Glenn feeling "comfortable" 
SPACE CENTER, Houston 
John Glenn is amazing not only his doctors 
but himself: He's suffering no queasiness 
whatsoever or any other discomforts in 
space and feeling so energetic that he's tried 
out the shuttle commander's seat. "I've 
snuck up there and sat down a couple of 
times to see what it feels like, I must admit," 
the 77 -year-old former test pilot said with a 
laugh. In his first news conference since 
rocketing into orbit last week aboard 
Discovery, the world's oldest space traveler 
said Sunday that he expected to be nauseous 
the first day or two considering that two­
thirds of all astronauts wind up with "stom­
ach awareness ... or worse. I haven't had 
any of that so far. It's been great and I've 
been quite comfortable," he said. 
Wales welcomes maggots 
SWANSEA 
Amid the gentle, green hills of south Wales, 
maggots and bloodsucking leeches are 
breeding at a shocking rate, multiplying by 
the thousands. And that -believe it or not 
-is a good thing. The squiggly creatures, 
being bred in labs here, not only are helping 
doctors save lives and limbs worldwide, 
they're drawing attention to a region quietly 
developing in to one of Britain's leading 
biotechnology centers. Once doctors and 
their patients overcome the squeamishness 
of using fly larvae and bloodsucking worms 
to treat serious wounds, they find maggots 
and leeches contribute to cleaning and heal­
ing better than anything produced by man, 
distributors say. "More and 'more people are 
coming around," said Dr. Stephen Thomas, a 
wound-therapy expert who heads the mag­
got-producing Biosurgical Research Unit at 
the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend.

The Clinton administration appeared ready to let the Security Council take the lead, and there seemed little chance of an immediate military response. France and Russia, council members that have taken more lenient positions on relaxing the sanctions in the past, firmly rebuked Iraq and called for compliance with the 
U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM. 
"I personally am very pleased that the U.N. Security Council, including some people I thought had been a little tolerant with him in the past, strongly con­demned what he did," President Clinton said in an interview with American Urban Radio Network.

Cohen, Albright, George Tenet, director of the CIA, and the president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, were meeting late Sunday at the White House "to review the situ­ation and appropriate action," spokesman David Leavy said.

"The Security Council made clear last night that the latest actions by Baghdad. ai·e an affront to the Security Council and the international communi­ty," Leavy said. "That kind of behavior cannot be tolerated.... UNSCOM must have (unblocked) access to the sites." 
Under an agreement reached with Iraq at the end of the 1991 Gulf War, the UNSCOM teams must certify that Baghdad has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction before the Security Council can lift econom­ic sanctions.

College campus evacuated 
Associated Press 
CONCORD, N.H. 
Part of a college campus was· evacuated Sunday because of a bomb threat, the latest in a series of incidents that started with two fire bombs placed in Concord libraries last week. 
An a.nonymous call Sunday morning warned that three bombs had been placed on the campus of the New Hampshire Technical Institute, said Mike Moffett, the school's public information officer. 
About a dozen buildings were evacuated, including a state police training building and the Christa McAuliffe Planetarium. A police bomb squad gave the all-clear after about 2 1/2 hours of searching turned up no evidence of a bomb. 
"You'd have to antic.ipate things like this," state police Lt. John Stevens said. "You have to take it seriously. It's very disruptive to the operation of these places, but you can't just dismiss them." 
Two children's shows had been scheduled during the morning at the planetarium. The college also had planned an open house Sunday, but Moffett said it was canceled. 
Two pipes bombs were found Tuesday at the city and state libraries. One bomb started a fire on a bookshelf at the city library, but no one was injured. 
FBI agents have said the bomber threatened to place two more bombs at undisclosed locations Saturday.

Big Ten, Big Name, 
Why not join the Big Ten? You proba­bly didn't see the front page article on last Sunday's South Bend Tribune_ It was all about Notre Dame joining the Big Ten. How convenient for the powers that be that such articles come out when most students are away. It's a nice way of making things public without making them known. But there's no need to sneak us into the Big Ten. There's no need to be hush hush about this deci­sion. It's a big issue. (By the way, where are the crack reporters at The Observer, eager to get the scoop on a big story? Or has the Observer become a one-story paper?). 
Needless to say, there should be a big debate about it. But people around here are strangely silent. Nobody on the administration wants to talk about it. They don't return reporters' phone calls. They cancel interviews. The public rela­tions office has no comment. Why the secrecy? Or has the decision already been made, and some people are fretting over how to break the news to a recalci­trant student body and angry alumni. Or are they quietly approaching alumni to ensure their continued support? 
But there's nothing to hide. When the dust clears, the administration can be sure, if.it has not already been decided, that joining the Big Ten, is not a Big Mistake. This move can only be a big help for those who are here for reputa­tion, research and money. For example, it will probably make it easier for me to find a job when I graduate. But that's not all. 
Just look at the advantages. The Big Ten offers opportunities for student exchanges. Students could go to Northwestern to learn Swahili, or Wisconsin to learn Polish. They could take classes on Beatleology (history of the Beatles, no joke) offered by profes­sors of Beatleology. Of course, Notre Dame does not have the resources to hire a professor who studies the Beatles and only the Beatles. 
The article from last Sunday's South Bene! Tribune claims joining the Big Ten will increase our purchasing power, introduce us to new technology, give us access to high performance computers, allow us to buy in bulk (kind of like Sam's Warehouse). It even says that once we join the Big Ten we will be able to compare our­selves with Big Ten schools. An administra­tor at Penn State said 
before Penn State joined the Big Ten, he was never able to com­pare his school with Big Ten schools, but now he does it all the time. According to another Big Ten official, joining the Big Ten will allow us to "be part of something larger," so that we can "be larger" ourselves. These are terrific goals, become a big consumer that can lise a lot of money to buy a lot of stuff. Who could argue with that?

in the Big Ten? To 

save you some time, the 
answer is ELEVEN. What do the high 
performance computers have to say 
about that? Have the officials of the Big 
Ten figured this out yet? What does that 
say about the quality of a Big Ten educa­
tion? If Notre Dame joins, that will make 
twelve. But the Big Twelve has already 
been taken, so we might have to move 
away from the numbers game and come 
up with a more.creative title for the con­·ference. On that score, there is nothing like 
calling a spade a spade. We could steal an acronym from a notorious group and call ourselves the NRA for short, National Research Academies. Looking at the information of these other univer­sities, however, this would be a problem. Now, several of the other universities are calling themselves World Class Universities. And I thought the debate was just about being national or region­al. 
Besides the problem of naming the conference, there will also be the prob­lem of what adjectives to put before our own name. In the Article in the South Bend Tribune, a theology professor says that Notre Dame is an "Independent National University." A philosophy pro­fessor questions, "Do we want to be a regional University?" It took an econom­ics professor to ask the question "What about our status as a Catholic University?" One Big Ten ofiicial admit­ted that joining the Big Ten might involve the loss of some autonomy. 
Finally, will it enable us to remain true to our founding principles? Will it allow this University to remain committed to the goals Father Sorin sought? Next to the architecture building you can find a reproduction of a letter that Father Sorin wrote to Father Moreau back in the 1850's. It's worth reading. It con­tains Fr. Sorin's hopes that this universi­ty would one day be of great service both to the Catholic Church and to this country. By adopting the goal of becom­ing "larger," of becoming a "national" university, or of becoming a "research" university, do we run the risk of serving neither the Church nor this country? Or has this institution already lost those concerns?

Ahmad Off the Mark in Affirmative Action Dialogue 
Nakasha Ahmad's Thursday editorial is awash in weak reason. Too many people willingly reduce the issue of repealing affirmative action to liberal vs. conservative, bad vs. good, sensitive vs. insensi­tive, Republican vs. Democrat, etc., etc., ad nause­um. Too many seem content with "My side no mat­ter what" -without listening, without considering, without reason, 'by whatever means necessary.' Among acceptable means, apparently, are mis­leading logic and sensational accusations. 
The purpose of affirmative action is NOT to guarantee equal opportunity. Equal opportunity is already guaranteed under the law. Affirmative action is intentional unequal, preferential treat­ment extended to 'historically-disadvantaged' groups in an attempt to 'right past wrongs' and, m.ore importantly, to try to break the cycle of inequality (the so-called 'good old boy network'). This is a laudable aim (that means GOOD). This is an attempt to 'broaden the economic franchise.' This is also a finite program. 
Affirmative action, by its very nature, is designed to phase itself out, to make itself obsolete. The question is not "Should affirmative action be repealed?"but "When should affirmative action be repealed?". In other words, when has this pro­gram helped achieve as much parity as can be reasonably expected? That, obviously, is not an easy diagnosis to make. That is up to scholars and politicians to debate and local voters to decide. 
Ahmad bemoans the fact that UC Berkeley turned away 800 black and latino applicants with exceptional credentials as if they were not treated fairly. The simple fact is that they did not make the cut oIT -their race had nothing to do with it, and yet she responds as ifit did. I'm sure UC Berkeley turned away thousands of identically-qualified whites. That's life. California's repeal of affirma­tive action simply stated that race could no longer be considered a criterion for acceptance -a poor­er-performing black could not be favored over a white, a poorer-performing white could not be favored over a latino. That is equal opportunity. Ahmad states that "qualified minorities are being turned away.'' Nothing could be further from the truth. While highly-qualified, these 800 students were obviously UNDER-qualified for admission to UC Berkeley. Ifthat is not true, then UC Berkeley 

Coppolella 
I have a great deal of respect for the hard work all of you put into our school's daily publication, but I have become a bit frustrated with the extreme lack of writing skill displayed by your sports columnist, John Coppolella. 
In the past I have been very dismayed with the with foundationless argument of sports that Coppolella proposes. For instance in one of his past columns he was all but sure Florence Griffith­Joyner used performance-enhancing drugs -there is no factual base behind this statement. It is the equivalent to me writing that Joyner died as a result of heart failure she suffered while having a nightmare about incompetent writers covering her personal life. In the same, weak writing style, bul­let form article, Coppolella states that Cal Ripken Jr.'s consecutive games played streak should have ended long ago. It seems as though Coppolella is abusing his privilege of having a colurrin by simply ranting against the norm. He does this without any true knowledge of sports and he never supports his points with any facts. 
This now brings us to the most recent abuse of the God-given ability to communicate through writing. Last Wednesday, Coppolella wrote about the New York Yankees, obviously his favorite team. The main source of his rant concerns a poll by the ESPN SportsZone -an opinion poll, is pret­ty much the bastion of sports facts and history. The truth is Coppolella wanted to venerate his Yankees, but could not take the time to research his own set of historically dominant baseball teams. His pot shots at Red Sox fans are complete­ly unnecessary. The Observer is not a New York paper and Mr. Coppolella is certainly not Mike Lupica (somebody needs to let him know his "shots from the lip" are far om. 
Coppolella then defines the modern era by stat­ing that it is after World War II, after the first $100,000 contract, etc. He never clearly explains his idea of baseball as business and how it was not as much of a business before World War II. The glaring mistake in his definition of the modern era is the failure to recognize the fact that the color has broken the law. Affirmative action doesn't enter into it. Ahmad goes on to argue that, since the college-educated are less likely to be on wel­fare (only four percent), the rejecting of these 800 students amounts to increasing welfare rolls. Wow, that's some twisted logic! I'm sure a good number of those 4.0 GPA, 1200-or-more-on-their­SAT college applicants, when turned down by UC Berkeley, immediately gave up on life and enrolled on welfare. 
I have a great idea: let's grant college degrees to everyone on welfare. Apparently it will make 96 percent of them self-sufficient! (notice the water­tight logic). The truth is, UC Berkeley is the most competitive school in the University of California system. Most people do not meet the school's stan­dards. If they don't meet those standards and they're not admitted, it's no great travesty of jus­tice. 
Ahmad goes on to say that "it would be nice if there was [sic] no need for affirmative action -if we lived in a colorblind society, where everyone was treated fairly." They ARE being treated fairly! Their rejection by UC Berkeley was not an injus­tice. Affirmative action does not treat them 'fairly,' it treats them specially; it does not seek equal opportunity, but extra opportunity. Ahmad cries out that "women and minorities still need equal opportunity, equal education, equal pay.'' Amen. That's guaranteed under the law. But that has lit­tle to do with affirmative action. One must not defend the 'cruel' repealing of affirmative action, one must prove that it continues to be necessary. The onus, the burden of proof, is upon those advo­cating affirmative action. 
This is not to say that affirmative action should be struck dowrl. But while we debate its continu­ance we need to keep in mind exactly what it real­ly is, Affirmative action has done great good. It has enabled thousands (if not millions) to achieve what they would not have done otherwise. At what point does its continuance propagate more inequality than it remedies? I don't know. I surely don't know for California.

eeds Help 
barriers were broken in 1947.by Jackie Robinson. I guess that is a too obscure fact to research for this gifted columnist. Furthermore, what do luxury boxes have to do with ~he 1998 Yankees being the best ever? 
Coppolella does use statistics in this article, but they are as weak as his writing. Paul O'Neill, a member of the 20-20 club -that must be the first time a baseball player has ever hit 20 HRs and had 20 SBs in a season, right John? The left fielders of the Yankees put up some of the best numbers in baseball. What were they? Compared to who? The ludicrous idea that Shane Spencer would have been a competitor in this year's home run race is both an insult to Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa and anyone who writes a column. 
I was not going to write this letter, but Coppolella's statements about Cincinnati Reds Hall of Famers Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan· and Pete Rose are an outrage. He writes about Morgan being more known as a sportscaster; that is a real­ly good point. The fact is, young John does not know about Morgan because he does not know about sports. Morgan is second to Ryne Sandberg for most home runs by a second baseman. His comments about Bench and Rose are equally dis­respectful and unwarranted to the handling of the issue he claims to be addressing. Whatever these baseball greats do now has nothing to do with the Yankee team of1998. Let's be honest, Coppolella's writing prowess could not do a story about the athletic supporters of Bench or Rose. Simply put, this kid does not deserve to have a col­umn.

Gavin de Becker and 
The Gift ofFear 

On Wednesday, Gavin de Becker will present a 7 p.m. talk, "The Gift of Fear -Survival Signals," in the Annenberg Auditorium of the Snite Museum. 
Cappy 






Gagnon 
Members of the Notre Dame 

community who watch the Larry 
King and Oprah Winfrey shows 
will be quite familiar with de 
Becker, who is widely considered 
to be the country's leading 
authority on stalking and predict­
ing violent behavior. He is a fre­
quent talk show guest on the top­
ics of stalking and dom.estic and 
workplace violence. 
Oprah began her June 17, 1997, show by advising her audi­ence, "I don't say this very often, but this show could save your life. If you are a woman, or you know a woman, or if you have a daugh­ter, nieces, cousins, aunts -this book could save their life.'' She devoted the entire show to an interview with de Becker and a discussion about his work in threat assessment, stalking and domestic violence. 
In the past year, The Gift of Fear rose to The New York Times bestseller list, where it remained for four months. The recently­released paperback edition became a national bestseller in its first week. 
Gavin de Becker was used as a consultant in both the criminal and civil cases against 0.J. Simpson. He is a three-time Presidential Appointee. He has designed artificial intuition sys­tems for predicting violence that are currently in use by the United State Supreme Court, the Central Intelligence Agency, the U.S. Capitol Police and the United States Marshal's Service. 
Although de Becker states, "There is more fear in the United States than there is risk," this presentation could have a great impact on students who attend. According to recent studies, one woman in twenty will be stalked. De Becker will present case stud­ies in stalking and domestic vio­lence and advise persons on steps to take to prevent and respond to problems with unwanted pur­suers. The program will feature interviews with stalkers who car­ried out their threats. 
One of the most useful parts of de Becker's talk will be a list of behaviors used by persons up to no good. Students will learn quickly to recognize "forced teaming," "typecasting," "loan 
sharking" and other strategies. 
For more than two decades, 
Gavin de Becker, Inc. has provid­
ed life safety services to celebri­
ties, CEO's, and the enteiiain­
ment industry. The Los Angeles 
Times called Gavin's company 
"The Hollywood Secret Service." 
The New York Times wrote, "If 
James Bond needed a bodyguard, 
he would hire Gavin de Becker." 
Because of his work protecting media figures, de Becker recog­nized some common threads and patterns which linked obsessive fans with other unwanted pur­suers. He created a "Threat Management Division" within his company and invested large amounts of time and money to the study of Threat Assessment and Management. He convened a Threat Assessment and Management Meeting (TAi\1M), in Honolulu in 1983, bringing together a small group of multi­disciplinary experts to explore ways to provide better services in stalking-type cases. 
Gavin de Becker, Inc., now 
houses the second largest collec­
tion of threat materials (the 
Secret Service has the largest). De 
Becker created a computer soft­
ware program (MOSAIC) for 
assessing this material. Several 
later refinements of this software 
have been tailored to domestic 
violence, threats against judges, 
threats against corporate entities, 
etc. His company has provided 
threat management services on 
more than 18,000 cases. 
Gavin de Becker wrote the California Stalking Law. When asked what legislation or societal change he would favor, he unequivocally answers that he would like to see a required class to teach young women how to recognize and avoid threats. Gavin is the founder and co-chair (With actress Victoria Principal) of "Victory Over Violence." His firm is the principal funding source for the Los Angeles County Domestic Violence Hotline.

Why do people do what they do? How 
much is genetic and how much is depen­
dent on environment? How often must a 
person perform an act before it becomes a 
habit which cannot be erased; an instinct, 
realized or unrealized, that cannot be ·controlled? 
Detached from the mundane melodra­
ma typical of teenage life, Todd Bowden, 
the central character of "Apt Pupil," dares 
to ask these questions. 
The answers he receives forever alter 
his view of the surrounding world and 
even his own personality. 
Adopted from a short story by Steven 
King and produced by the director of "The 
Usual Suspects," "Apt Pupil" is the tale of 
Todd (Brad Renfro,) a high school student 
possessing a morbid fascination with the 
Holocaust. 
Unsatisfied by the information taught in 
his history class, Todd frequents the 
library every day after the 3 o'clock bell 
and delves into the past, seeking an 
of blackmail unfolds. 
After extensive stalking and data col­lecting, Todd convinces Dussander that the power to turn the criminal into the Israeli police lies only a phone call away. 
But Todd agrees to keep silent in exchange for an unorthodox history les­son. Todd wants to know everything. He wants to know all the grisly details of the atrocities Dussander committed during the war. He wants to know "everything they're afraid to show [him] in school." 
Of course, true to Steven King, this rela­tionship between Todd and Dussander produces terrifying consequences. But this film is not as far-fetched as "The Shining," "The Stand" or "Tommy Knockers." Instead of showcasing supernatural phe­nomenon, "Apt Pupil" deJves into the human psyche by addressing the reality of brainwashing and exploring subconscious motivations and murderous instincts. 
In nearly all of Steven King's works lies the tried and .true, yet ever-present battle of good and evil, usually depicted by two distinct characters or two groups· of' char­acters.

"Why do people do what they do?" 
In the midst of his research, Todd uncovers a deadly sErcret. Kurt Dussander (Ian McKellan), a Nazi war criminal, had been living incognito in Todd's town for over 20 years. Sometime after this discovery, specified by a title card as "One month later," Todd summons his courage and confronts Dussander.

This time, in this story, the answer is yes. The Holocaust really occurred. Thousands upon thousands of people were executed at the hands of such men as represented by Dussander. And while World War II ended more than 50 years key elements which 
push viewers to the ends of their seats, biting their nails expectantly. 
The purely instrumental soundtrack heightens the drama and propels the film to a level above tlrn typical horror ilick. 
The suspense is spread out beautifully and the end is well-crafted. It ha<; intellec­tual depth and historical foundations. But most importantly, it can definitely cause a few sleepless nights. 
"Pleasantville" is Gary Ross' inspired attack on the phenomenon of gilded nos­talgia in which the reality of the past is seen through a sugar-coated lens.

A skirmish over the magical remote propels Dave and Jen directly into the cast of the "Pleasantville" program as Bud and Mary Sue Parker, the children of George (William Macy) and Betty (Joan Allen). They sport 50s style clothing and haircuts and appear in black-and-white as everything else in the town. · 
While David is content to role-play the character he already knows so well, Jennifer is livid about being deprived of the glamorous popularity she enjoyed back in the real world. 
Soon, Pleasantville's firemen are going to be required for more than just rescu­ing cats from trees, as Jennifer's incendi­ary intentions begin to inflame this wholesome town. Her seduction of the basketball team captain leads to the dis­covery of hidden passions that gradually unweave the moral fabric of this perfect boss, Bill (Jeff Daniels), and his mother, Betty, a rose appears in bright red. Reality is indeed blooming in Pleasantville. 
Soon, the majority of the town's citi­zens are "colored," as passions for romance, beauty and knowledge take possession of their souls. This prepares the stage for a final showdown between the "coloreds" and those in the town who resist change, remaining black-and­white. 
"Pleasantville" is entertaining and sat­isfying movie-going fare. It transports the moviegoer into a nostalgic utopia and then shows why such a utopia is illusory. 
As the town is painted in a variety of shades of color, it becomes more nuanced. Moral ambiguity and uncer­tainty arise, and the tranquil paradise. of a cut-and-dried world is replaced with 
the more miscible melting

This past Halloween, many students at midwestern colleges feared for their lives in some recess of their minds. Rather than wrapping themselves in some plastic or rubber concoction and following their friends out, they succumbed to adolescent paranoia and stayed indoors, wary of the tale that had spread across the region. 
Humor had it that a psychic, possibly from tlrn "Oprah V\linf'rey Show," predict­ed that the slaying of 10 to 20 female stu­dents habitating a dorm shaped like an eight or an "!-!" at a midwestern college, would take place at the hands of a slasher dressed as Little Bo Peep. 
I am not female. nor do I live in a !ig­ure-eight shaped building, but for some sick reason I find the Little Bo Peep char­acter absolutely horrifying. So instead of engaging in "drink-or­
town with $40,000 worth "Psycho." of stolen money and one hell of a guilty conscience. She stops for the night at the Bates Motel, where soft-spoken proprietor Norman (Anthony Perkins) befriends Ms. Crane and engages in small talk about life, love and taxidermy. 
This upsets Mother Bates, who comes down from the towering black house behind the motel and introduces Marion to her 12-inch kitchen blade in the now famous shower scene. Poor Marion never even gets a whiff of her complimentary continental breakfast. 
Norman discovers how mommy made a new li"iend and, like any good son would do, carefully discards the body at the bot­tom of a muddy reservoir. Enter Marion's lover and sister, who retrace her steps after she comes up missing. They ulti­mately end up back at the Bates Motel. 
A few stuffed animals and bloody mur­ders later, the film reveals the truth about the brutal slayings and the Bates family, a psychotic oedipal-twisted tale which makes the Hamlet story look like "The Donna Reed Show." 
No'body' is better at combining visual and thematic elements of horror than Alfred Hitchcock. He is able to establish the perf'ect backdrop for this movie through expert use of high-contrast light­ing, staccato editing and a camera-style which is careful not to reveal the whole story but gives you enough to keep your hands bloody.

Vikings see unbeaten streak crumble against Bucs 
Associated Press 
TAMPA, Fla. 

So much for Tampa Bay's shaky offense being a liability against the explosive Minnesota Vikings. When the Buccaneers are at home, they're on solid ground. 
Moving the ball and scoring almost at will, the Bucs broke out of an offensive funk with a team-record 246 yards rushing Sunday and beat the NFC's last unbeaten team 27-24 on Mike Alstott's 6-yard touchdown run with 5:48 to go. 
Alstott ran for a career-high 128 yards on 19 carries and Warrick Dunn gained 115 on 18 attempts, giving Tampa Bay (4-4) a pair of 100-yard run­ners in a game for the first time in franchise history. 
"I couldn't feel any better than I feel right now," Alstott said. "We knew what we could do. It was frustrating those first seven weeks, because we kept hurting ourselves through penalties and missed opportu­nities. 
"A lot of people were saying we needed a new quarterback or we needed some offensive linemen. All we had to do was go out there and execute." 
Randall Cunningham was outstanding for Minnesota (7­1), completing 21 of 25 passes for 291 yards and two touch­downs. But his only intercep­tion led to a second-half field goal, and the Vikings' last three possessions didn't produce points. 
Meanwhile, the Bucs rolled 
up a season-high 378 yards 
total offense to remain unbeat­
en (4-0) at Raymond James 
Stadium, their new $168 mil­
lion home. 
In its four victories, Tampa 
Bay averaged 194 yards per 
game rushing. In four road 
losses, the Bucs averaged just 
under 58 yards on the ground. 
"In this league, you have to 
be able to stop the run first. 
And, you have to be able to run the ball yourself. That's really the only way you get your rhythm," Vikings coach Dennis Green said. 
"Even though we had 24 points, it was clear we didn't have the rhythm. We made some big plays, but we didn't have the rhythm." 
Trent Dilfer had one of the best days of his five-year career for Tampa Bay. Although his passing numbers -11-of-22 for 132 yards and one TD ­paled in comparison to Cunnigham's, he avoided costly mistakes and delivered his share of key plays. 
Dunn scored on a 10-yard run, Dilfer threw a 12-yard TD pass to Reidel Anthony and Michael Husted kicked a 29­yard field goal on Tampa Bay's three first-half possessions. The TDs were the first scored by the Bucs offense in the opening half this season. 
"I made enough plays to help us win, but I really felt like our offense came out with an atti­tude to dominate the game," Dilfer said. "We didn't make many mistakes ... and when we did make one, no one pan­icked." 
Cunningham threw TD passes of 44 and 1 yards to Jake Reed, while Robert Smith scored on a 9-yard run and Gary Anderson kicked a 44-yard field goal for Minnesota that made it 17-17 at the half. 
"It was one of those games where you have a shootout and whoever has the ball at the end of the game wins," Cunningham said. "They got the best of us today, but we humbly accept this loss and we'll just keep on going. It's not going to knock us down. It's not going to knock us out." 
Dilfer and offensive coordina­
tor Mike Shula have been 
under fire because of Tampa 
Bay's lack of production, par­
ticularly during last week's 9-3 
loss to New Orleans. 
After gaining just 236 yards against the Saints, the Bucs controlled the ball for more than 18 minutes of the first half and scored on all three of their possessions. 
However, Cunningham kept pace by making the most of the limited time the Vikings offense was on the field. He was 4-of-4 for 52 yards on the drive that produced Smith's touchdown, then threw his 44-yarder to Reed and set up Anderson's field goal with a 41-yard com­pletion to Randy Moss. 
In the second half, it was Tampa Bay's turn to keep up. 
The Vikings scored on their fourth straight possession, tak­ing a 24-17 lead on Cunningham's second TD pass to Reed just over five minutes into the third quarter. 
Dilfer moved his team from its 32 to the Minnesota 5 before the Bucs were stopped on downs, eschewing a short field goal. The gamble wasn't as costly as it appeared at the time. 
Derrick Brooks intercepted Cunningham's pass on Minnesota's next possession to set up Husted's 38-yard field goal, which trimmed the Vikings' lead to 24-20. 
The Bucs forced the first punt of the game with 10 minutes remaining and marched 43 yards to go ahead for good on Alstott's TD run. 
The Vikings, off to their best start in 23 years, tried to keep the loss in perspective. 
"I think we'll take it just like anyone else -be disappoint­ed," Green said. "After 24 hours, we'll say: 'It happened yesterday,' and look forward to the next ball game." 
Green Bay 36, San Francisco 22 

Brett Favre and Antonio Freeman overshadowed the top scoring duo in NFL history and saved the Green Bay Packers' season on Sunday. 
The two connected for touch­down pass plays of 80 and 62 yards as the blitz-happy Packers beat the San Francisco 49ers 36-22 at frenzied Lambeau Field. 
The Packers' nine sacks of Steve Young were the team's most since Oct. 24, 1965, against Dallas. 
Freeman caught seven passes for a career-best 193 yards as the Packers and 49ers both went home 6-2, one game behind Minnesota for the NFC's best mark. 
Young set two more NFL records: most TD runs by a quarterback and most TD toss­es to one receiver -Jerry Rice. But in the end, Young was bat­tered and beaten -and win­less in eight career starts against his No. 1 nemesis, the Packers. 
After blowing a 16-0 lead, Green Bay regrouped in the second half by blitzing Young and returning to the quick­strike offense that sent them to the last two Super Bowls. 
With the score tied at 22, Favre hit Freeman for a 62­yard TD toss with 11 minutes left in the game. Freeman beat Marquez Pope and Merton Hanks, the same two he burned on the first play from scrim­mage for an 80-yard score. 
Reggie White had three sacks, giving him 11 for the season, the12th time he's reached double digits. 
Five of Green Bay's sacks came in the first six minutes of the fourth quarter after Favre's three-interception performance was threatening to send them to 5-3 with a three-game road trip coming up. 
Sack No. 7 resulted in a fum­ble at the San Francisco 11 that Santana Dotson recovered for Green Bay. 
Travis Jervey rumbled in from there for his first NFL touchdown, bouncing off R.W. McQuarters at the 5 and plow­ing into the end zone for a 36­22 lead with 9:30 left. 
The 49ers, who lost to the Packers in the NFC champi­onship last season, extended their losing skid to Green Bay to five, including playoff losses the last three seasons. 
San Francisco overcame an early 16-0 hole and trailed 19­13 at halftime after linebacker Lee Woodall intercepted Favre in the end zone with 28 seconds left, beginning a string in which three of six passes would be picked off. 
Safety Zach Bronson's inter­ception on Green Bay's first possession of the second half set up Garrison Hearst's 30­yard TD romp that tied it at 19. 
Holder Ty Detmer dropped the snap on the extra point, continuing a long day by the kicking team. In the first half, Keith McKenzie blocked Wade Richey's extra point, and punter Reggie Roby let a snap go through his hands for a safe­ty. 
Safety Tim McDonald's inter­ception at the Green Bay 48 set up Richey's 20-yard field goal that gave San Francisco its only lead, 22-19 with 4:45 left in the third quarter. 
After Richey's 47-yarder hit an upright, Ryan Longwell tied it at 22 with a 45-yarder at 
13:14 of the fourth quarter. 
Young turned to an old favorite to get the 49ers back into it after Robert Brooks' 30­yard TD catch made it 16-0 in the first quarter. 
Young and Rice became the NFL's top quarterback-wide receiver duo when they con­nected for a 12-yard scoring toss in the first quarter, break­ing Dan Marino and Mark Clayton's record of 79 TDs. That made it 16-6. 
Young's 1-yard touchdown run in the second quarter was his4lst TD rushing, surpassing the NFL mark for quarterbacks held by Jack Kemp, and pulling San Francisco to 19-13.

fl NEW YORK CITY MARATHON 
Kagwe repeats as champion 
Associated Press thought of withdrawing. 
"At five kilometers I started NEW YORK to feel my stomach," she said. John Kagwe did not have to "At 20K I wanted to pull out. worry about loose shoelaces ·Then I decided to slow it 
this time. 
Instead, he had to contend with Kenyan countryman Joseph Chebet and Tanzania's Zebedayo Bayo. 
For the second straight year, Kagwe proved the best, win­ning the New York City Marathon on Sunday in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 45 seconds -three seconds ahead of Chebet in the second-closest finish in the race's 29-year history. 
"Last year, I felt it was my race to win," Kagwe said. "This year, I was not that sure. Chebet was tough." 
Kagwe disproved the theory that a runner had to perform well in shorter races leading to the marathon. 
Last year, he finished second in the Philadelphia Distance Run Half-Marathon in his final preparation for New York. This year, he was eighth. 
While Kagwe was pressed by Chebet and Bayo, who was third at 2:08:51, the women's race turned into a runaway for Franca Fiacconi. 
She became the first Italian 
to win the women's division, 
setting a personal best by 
nearly three minutes. 
She was timed in 2:25:17, 
beating runner-up Adriana 
Fernandez of Mexico (a 
national record of 2:26:33) by 
more than a minute and world 
record-holder Tegla Loroupe 
of Kenya by more than five 
minutes. 
This was the second-fastest 
NYC Marathon by a woman, 
behind only Australia's Lisa 
Ondieki, who ran 2:24:40 in 
1992. 
Loroupe, who set the world 
record of 2:20:47 at 
Rotterdam in April and won 
the New York City Marathon 
in 1994 and 1995, couldn't 
overcome severe stomach 
cramps and finished third at 
2:30:28.  
"I wanted to break 2:28," 
said Fiacconi, who had fin­
ished second at New York in, 
1996 and third last year. 
"That was my goal. If I did, I 
thought I would win. 
"I was not afraid of Tegla. I 
was not intimidated by her or 
anyone else." 
At one point, Loroupe

down." 
Defending champion Franziska Moser-Rochat of Switzerland, who has been hampered by two stress frac­tures this year, finished fifth at 2:32:37. 
Perhaps the most heart­warming story was that of Joan Benoit Samuelson. 
Winner of the first women's Olympic marathon in 1984, the 4·1-year-old was attempt­ing to qualify for the 2000 U.S. Olympic trials. 
Samuelson reached her goal, breaking 2:50. Her time of 
2:41:06 made her the second American finisher -12th overall -behind Libbie Hickman of Fort Collins, Colo., who was sixth aT 2:33:06, a career best. 
The leading American man 
was  Alfredo  Vigueras  of  
Woodland,  Calif.,  18th  at  
2:16:14.  

Last year, Kagwe, wearing new running shoes, had to stop twice to tie his laces and ran the final three miles with loose laces flapping against his legs. 
But he had a huge lead over Chebet and the shoelaces made no difference in the out­come, only that he possibly could have broken the course record. 
His time in 1997 was 
2:08:12 -11 seconds off the course mark of 2:08:01 by Tanzania's Juma Ikangaa in 1989. 
On Sunday, he dueled with Chebet and Bayo. Bayo dropped out of contention shortly after they entered Central Park for the final stretch, leaving the two Kenyans to duel. 
The closest finish in the his­tory of the race was two sec­onds, in 1994 when Mexico's German Silva rallied after making a wrong turn and beat countryman Benjamin Paredes. 
"I decided to push the pace, especially in the last 400 meters," Kagwe said. "I decid­ed to go and see if Chebet would stay with me." 
It was another frustrating second-place finish for Chebet, who also was the Boston Marathon runner-up in April. 
"I may have to change my tactics and train differently for a close, tough finish," Chebet said. 
"I lost in the last 100 meters. I'll sit down with my ·coach and plan something. It's hard to take second-place fin­
ishes so often," he said. 

The jubilant Fiacconi, whose 
time was an Italian record, 
gave the thumbs-up sign twice 
shortly before the end. She 
then bent and kissed the 
ground after crossing the fin­
ish line. 

Before her last two New 
York races, Fiacconi had run 
marathons within close prox­
imity. 

This time, she refrained, and 
was much fresher. 

"I understood at 30 kilome­
ters [18.6 miles] that I could 
win," Fiacconi said after win­
ning her eighth marathon in 
20 tries. "I decided to pull 
away then." 

Two of the biggest names 
failed to finish. 

Spain's Abel Anton, the 1997 
world champion, dropped out 
before 17 miles. 

And South African Josia 
Thugwane, the 1996 Olympic 
gold medalist, quit before mile 
19. 

It was the second time 
Thugwane had dropped out of 
New York. 

In 1995, he went out after 
22 miles with leg injuries. , 
The weather at the start of 
the 26.2-mile race was perfect 
for marathoners 50 
degrees, 61 percent humidity, 
6 mph wind -as well as spec­
tators, with an estimated 2 
million lining the streets of the 
city's five boroughs. 

Kagwe and Fiacconi each 
collected $50,000 plus bonus 
money for their winning fin­
ishing times. 


~NBA 

Drexler set for work as Cougars coach 
Associated Press 

CHICAGO 
While NBA players are sidelined by a messy labor dispute, Clyde Drexler is happily at work. 
"I've been informed on everything that has occurred, and I wish them well. I certainly picked a good year in terms of tim­ing," Drexler said Sunday at a preseason Conference USA gathering of coaches and players. 
Drexler said he decided two years ago when he would retire. Then last March, before his NBA sea­son with the Houston Rockets was over, he made a surprise announcement ­he was leaving as a player to coach the University of Houston, his alma mater. 
"I think you have to make decisions and make them quick. I don't think· you nec­essarily wait until the time comes. I think they should be made at least a year ahead of time so you can make the transition and be mentally prepared," Drexler said. 
''I've actually been thinking about what I would do the last 15 years. So it's been an easy transition." 
Of course, Drexler hasn't coached a game yet. And the Cougars were picked for sixth and last place in the National Division of the con­ference in a preseason poll, even if their rookie coach was chosen one of the NBA's 50 greatest players. 
'Tm trying it because it's something I want to do, and so far it's been great," said Drexler, whose roster includes the sons of former NBA stars Moses Malone and George Gervin. 
"It's like you want to give something back and experi­ence the game from all angles, and coaching is the last hurdle for me."

Senior Monica Gerardo struck next when she volleyed in a cross from Anne Makinen for the game-winner at 14:16. 
The Badgers closed the gap when Jennifer Wright scored off her own rebound at 49:56, but Jenny Streiffer and Heft both scored in a 20-second span and the Irish pulled away. Streiffer's left-footed shot deflected in off the crossbar at 65:07 and Heft beat the goalkeeper to through ball and scored at 65:27. 
Heft completed her hat trick at 
80:04 when she scored off a cross from Lindsey Jones and Iris Laneaster closed out the Irish scoring with her first goal of the season just 45 seconds later. 
Shannon Boxx, Jones and Makinen each had two assists in the win.On Sunday, Makinen stole the show, adding a hat trick of her own. 
"Anne proved again that she is as good as anybody," Petrucelli said. "She played a great game. We've asked her recently to step up and take over and I think she's done that." 
She scored on a free kick from 30 yards out at 27:55 and then had another first half goal when she headed in a Jen Grubb cor­ner kick at 37:03. 
She scored her third goal just 40 seconds into the second half when she sprinted down the right sideline, dribbled toward the goal and scored into the upper left corner of the net. 
Heft scored her 25th goal of the season, tying Cindy Daws' single-season record. 
"I didn't even really think about it until everyone started talking about it," Heft said. "It's a great accomplishment to be with Cindy Daws." 
Heft volleyed in a cross from Kara Brown at 87:08. 
"She's had a great season," Petrucelli said. "Everything she has touched has been gold. It's been that kind of season for her. She deserves it. She's done everything right." 
Gerardo scored the game-win­ner less than four minutes into the contest when she headed in a Makinen cross. 
Meotis Erikson had two goals for the Irish, including a blast into the upper left part of the net. 
Practice seems to have paid off for the Irish. 
"We worked a lot individually this week at practice," Heft said. "We did a lot of work on shoot­ing and finishing and I think that got our confidence up in practice and then it was there for the game."

APPLICATION DEADLINE--FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 6 
Belles~ frosh provide promise in first loss 
By M. SHANNON RYAN 
Saint Mary's Editor 
The Belles learned Saturday that Danielle Clayton may be a freshman, but she's ready to put on a show. 
In Saint Mary's 147-78 loss to NAIA Division I power­house Transylvania University in its first match of the sea­son, Clayton led the Belles. 
In the 400-meter medley relay, Clayton anchored the crew including Wendy Neumann, Alicia Lesnewskie and Olivia Smith in the come-from-behind win. 
"The last relay was the best race," she said. "I could see ber ahead of me and just pushed ahead." 
Clayton surged ahead in other races as well. She post­ed wins in the 100-meter freestyle and finished second in the 50-meter race, just missing the school record. 
"It was amazing," said Clayton, who hails from Michigan. "It was probably the best meet I've had in a long time." 
Gillespie. 
"It was a strong start for the meet. It provided a lot of momentum for the team. One of the main goals we were trying to work on was team spirit, and there was deiinite­ly a lot of that in the relay ­for the people in the water and out." 
"I was very pleased with the intensity and heart with which we swam," head coach Jini Cook said. 
The intensity and heart may be there, but inexperience may be a problem for the Belles this season. 
Saint Mary's has only one diver, who has not yet com­~-­peted for Saint Mary's. Against Transylvania the absence cost the Belles an automatic 40-point deduction. 
The butterfly position is also one which needs fine-tuning because of swimmers who lack experience. 
"A lot of freshmen are still trying to figure out what's going on, but if you look at the meet, it was not a prob­lem. Some of our key swims 
Clayton was not the only·. came from freshmen," first young one who fared well for the team. 
Alicia Lesneskie, also a member of the 400-meter relay winning team, finished first in the 500-meter freestyle and second in the 1,000-meter freestyle. 
Still, Lesneskie is driven to improve as the season pro­gresses. 
"For this point in time, my times are not bad," she said. ''I'd like to improve." 
Junior co-captain Michelle Samreta chipped in by taking the 200-meter breaststroke. 
The 400-meter medley relay of Samreta, Noreen Gillespie, Ann Yanda and Wendy Neumann finished second behind their teammates. 
"Our relay was a good way to start off the meet," said 
See tomorrow's Obseruer for eHtensiue cross­country couerage. 
year student Gillespie said. 
The Belles' hopes are not dashed, however, as they realize the team is in its early stages. 
"Everyone is becoming more comfortable with com­peting," Lesneskie said. 
Depth has improved as the Belles team has almost dou­bled from the eight who com­posed the team last year. This may be the key to improve last season's losing record. 
"One of the things Jini emphasized a lot [Saturday] was that we were setting the foundation for the rest of the season," Gillespie said. 
"We weren't looking for best times or record-setting swims. We were looking for 100 percent effort. We have until February to produce those record-setting swims." 
Head coach Jini Cook said she foresees a good showing against the tri-meet against the University of Chicago and Lake Forest this weekend and for the rest of the season. 
"We are setting ourselves up for a very fast, record­breaking season," she said.

~MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Murphy shines in Blue=Gold scrimmage 


By BILL HART Assistam Sports Editor 
Fighting Irish basketball fans have been waiting since February to find out how the team will carry on without for­ward Pat Garrity, and Friday night those fans got their chance. 
In its first official appearance of the season, shortly after the football team's pep rally, the Notre Dame men's basketball team started off the year with the annual Blue-Gold scrim­mage in the Joyce Center. 
"We've had some break­downs, but they've been decreasing," head coach John MacLeod said about the scrim­mage. "We're making progress. We're moving in the right direction." 
Although the game was limit­ed to two 15-minute halves with no stopping the clock, this year's scrimmage gave the crowd a glimpse of what the upcoming basketball season will hold. The evenness in the two squads was evident by the final score: a 35-35 tie. 
Despite the "oohs" and "aahs" coming from the crowd, coach MacLeod said he thought there were some negatives in the scrimmage. 
"There were a lot of break­downs on offense," he said. "We were real aggressive in the pit and going after one another in the workouts and then we came upstairs and [to the court] and we stopped working so much. We weren't nearly as aggressive, but we did do some good things." 
As in previous years, all eyes were on the new recruits mak­ing their first public appear­ance on the squad. As it turned out, they did not disappoint. 
The scoring leader for both squads this year was highly 
touted freshman recruit Troy Murphy. The 6-foot-10 forward from Morristown, N.J., had 10 points and eight rebounds for the game, leading both teams in the two categories. 
"I think we played pretty well," Murphy said. "We were really taking to it on defense, doing what we could to get open and work together as a team." 
Overall, MacLeod was pleased with the performance of the incoming players. 
"Troy showed some flashes, Harold [Swanagan] and David [Graves] were real aggressive. That's a good sign," he said. 
A pair of returning members rounded out the top scorers for both sides. Senior center Phil Hickey contributed six points and two rebounds while junior forward Todd Palmer scored six points. 
Still, the team was unable to complete the game unscathed. Guards Martin Ingelsby and Jimmy Dillon each went down with leg injuries shortly before the end of the game. 
Ingelsby suffered a bruised knee while Dillon had a sprained ankle. 
"[Inglesby] banged his knee with about three minutes to go in practice," MacLeod said. "It's not a structural thing like a cartilage or ligament tear ... it's just a real sore knee situa­tion." 
Despite the injuries, both players should be healed in time for the start of the team's official preseason, which begins tonight at the Joyce Center. 
"It really felt good to go out there [and] to play in front of the people and get out on the floor," Murphy said. "We've been practicing so long, though, that I think we're real­ly ready to go with the start of the season. "

half we were in the game and had plenty of opportunities." 
The second half began as a dense fog set upon Alumni Field and the Irish attack covered the Mountaineer goal. A change in game plan at the half put the Irish back on track and on the board. Pridmore scored less than 10 minutes into the half on a play that coach Berticelli could not have scripted bet­ter. 
Senior co-captain Matt Johnson set a pass out to the right side for a breaking Pridmore who dribbled to the net and crossed one to the left for the first goal at 36:21 in the second. 
"The first half we knew we were in the middle too much, and we knew we needed to spread the ball out \·vide. We focused on that in the second half. Pridmore gets the ball out wide, shoots and scores in the first ten minutes -it could not have been better," said Johnson. 
The second-half surge also 
particular certainly made a difference in the game." 
Aris followed suit just 15 minutes later when he also sent a ball wide right, this 
time  to  forward  Shane  
Walton.  
Walton  outdribbled  the  

Mountaineer defense en route to the box where he sent one to Ryan Cox who planted one left of Iga for the 2-0 score. 
Though the offense needed a half to work into its game-plan, the defense was on tar­get all night. 
Senior Greg Velho left Alumni Field for the last time with his 26th career shutout on five saves. 
The difference in halves was the Irish came out with a tighter press on the Mountaineers, allowing just three shots and guaranteeing the shutout. 
"The team splayed a great defensive role and we were able to capitalize on a few of our chances," said Velho. 
"There was a good combi~ nation between defense and offense. Our defense had to step up, which we did, and just give our offense enough time to put a few goals on the board," she said. 
For a team that's strength lied in its defense, allowing an average of less than a goal a game, stopping the attack posed less of a problem, especially when the Irish controlled most of the mid­field play throughout the game. 
"The only real attack they had was a counterattack where we would give the ball away in the middle and they'd get a quick counterat­tack," said co-captain Phil Murphy. · 
With thoughts of going out with a bang and what West Virginia attacked with, the Irish wanted nothing more than a shutout. 
"We have three seniors back there [Velho, Murphy and David Cutler]," said Murphy. 
"Before the game we were talking about how nice it 
·would be to go out on a shutout in our last game at home. Everyone stepped it up tonight, we wanted this game badly," he said.

The fifth-ranked Notre Dame women's soccer team closed out the regular season with a four­game winning streak. defeating Wisconsin and conference oppo­nent Svracuse this 'veekend. 
"\l\'e. played very well," said head coach Chris Petrucelli, whose team finished with a 16­2-1 overall record and a 9-1-1 conference mark. "We played as well as we have all year long." 
The Irish posted an impres­sive 6-1 victory over the Badgers on Friday and followed it up with a 7-0 shutout of the Orangewomen on Sunday. 
"It's not just winning the games, it's the way we won," Petrucelli said. "It was huge for our confidence. There have been times over the last few weeks when vve have ques­tioned ourselves a little bit and I think we feel a lot better about ourselves right now, even more than we did heading into the game on Friday."

"It's really not significant to me," said Brown of the mile­stone victory. "It's significant for me for this team that we won that match tonight."

The Irish looked solid in game one, as the·y hit .385 with only three errors to win 15-8.

Notre Dame claims weekend victories 
By ANTHONY BIANCO 
Assistant Sports Editor 

The seventh-place Irish ended their regular season :ijlatched up against a West Virginia squad that is just one place below them in the Big East. 
But coach Mike Berticelli's team convinced them all that it is playing at a much higher level. 
"We know that we can come out here and play calmly, play simply, and play our game and win," said sophomore Dustin Pridmore after the 2-0 shutout against the Mountaineers. "When we come out and play our game, we're -doing to dominate everyone." 
Pridmore, starting the last 10 games this season, picked up his first collegiate goal in the win as the Irish ended the season at 9-5-3 and 5-4-2 in the Big East. 
The Irish could not have climbed the mountain and peaked at a better time. Last Saturday's 3-0 win at Boston College and this win against the Mountaineers guarantees Notre Dame's seventh place finish in the conference and a quarterfinal pairing with No. 2 St. John's. 
"You always want to go into the Big East tournament coming off of a win," said Berticelli. "Certainly you don't tjoubt yourself then, you go in with confidence as we should. We've been play­
ing pretty well the last cou­
ple of weeks of the season." 
For a team that's just hit­
ting its stride, the Irish start­
ed Friday night's contest at 
less than full speed. They 
recorded just six scoring 
attempts to West Virginia's 
eight in the first half in what 
was clearly a defensive bat­
tle. 
Carlos Iga didn't face much pressure in goal from the Irish attack in that half as West Virginia stopped much of the Irish play that pene­trated the front-line. Few of the chances that Notre Dame did manage in the first stan­za were on quality passing drives. ­
"I think in the first half we played very very well, we just didn't create real good quali­ty scoring chances and I think we were a little impa­tient," said Berticelli. 
Much of the Irish play in that half relied on working the ball quickly up the mid­dle to the net, a tactic the Mountaineer defense responded to with ease. The half ended with the Irish unsuccessful at forcing quick goals. 
"We were just trying to play a little too direct," said Pridmore. "We weren't play­ing simple. Then in the sec­ond half we calmed down and started playing more to our game and it showed. For the majority of the second

the Irish and the two wins serve as a confidence boost heading into tomorrow night's Big East championship quarterfinal game with West Virginia. 
"We played really well as a team and I think these games were really big for our confi­dence," junior forward Jenny Heft said. "We haven't been scoring goals and we had a lot of goals this weekend. We had a great week of practice and this weekend, I think we really peaked. It's a good time for it with the tournament starting this week." 
Heft was spectacular this weekend, as she has been all season for the Irish.Against "Wisconsin, Heft recorded her fifth career hat trick, tying for­mer Irish forward Rosella Gurerro's record. She also matched Cindy Daws' mark of three hat tricks in a single sea­son.

By KATHLEEN LOPEZ Sports Editor 
For Baylor head coach Dave Roberts, Saturday's game was a measuring stick. 
It was a chance to see his accomplish­ments from the past and his current project go head-to-head. 
Unfortunately, he didn't like the results he saw. 
All"Roberts could do was watch his former offense dominate Baylor, 27-3. The Irish gained 462 yards on offense compared to a measly 172 for the Bears. 
"We had very few opportunities," Roberts said. "We didn't run the ball well and when you can't run, you are not going to win." 
Notre Dame had no problems with its ground attack, amassing 329 yards on 50 carries. Baylor gained 33 yards rush­ing for the entire contest on 38 carries. 
Autry Denson, who Roberts enticed to come here, ran away with a new per­sonal best. His 189 yards bettered his mark of 162 which he set against Michigan in the season opener. By the end of the first quarter alone, he had already chalked up 7 4 yards on seven carries. 
''I'm happy for them," Roberts said. "You want guys to do well. You just want your guys to do better. It was just a matter of being able to execute, and we weren't able to do that today." 
The first quarter remained rather quiet for the Irish with kicker Jim Sanson nailing a 32-yard field goal to give Notre Dame its first points of the game. 
The secoi:id quarter provided a whole different story as Denson capped a drive with a two-yard dive for the end zone. 
Not to be outdone by Denson and the ground attack, Jarious Jackson got heat­ed up in the second. He capped a drive by lofting a high pass in the right corner of the endzone to wide receiver Malcolm Johnson. The 6-foot-5 Johnson used his height and reach advantage to give Notre Dame its second touchdown of the quarter, boosting the lead to 14. 
"I thought that might have been the drive of the game," Davie said of the drive ieading to Johnson's touchdown. "We had squandered way some o'ppor­tunities in the first half, yet we came back at the end of the first half and got that big score. And so we were able to stay on rythmn at halftime and that was critical." 
Bobby Brown's 66-yard touchdown reception added an exclamation mark to Notre Dame's lead. 
"I think this was a good win for us," Davie said. "I think we all agree that we didn't play as well as we could but we played well enough to win which seems to be a trademark of this team." 
Davie and his coaching staff get kudos for the game. At the midpoint in the sea­son, they could have fallen into a mid­season slump and stayed with the same calls. Instead the Irish came out with new formations and showed they aren't going to rely on the same calls game­after-game. Lining up Mike Gandy at fullback and bringing in Tony Fisher early in the game show that Davie and Co. are trying their best to find the win­ning combination. 
The Irish only registered a fevv mis­takes in Saturday's win. Denson's fum­ble of the option pitch on the opening 
drive was the third fumble of his career on 738 carries. 
Denson's interception on a botched play call perhaps could be considered a key play of the game. In the second quarter, Denson took the pitch from Jackson and turned to throw back to him. Baylor's Baxter intercepted and returned it 59 yards before Denson made the touchdown saving tackle. The defense went on to hold the Bears to a field goal. 
Another concern for the Irish is spe­cial teams could not get anything start­ed. The longest return of the day was Tony Driver's kickoff returri in the sec­ond quarter for 16 yards. 
"At some point, we need a big return from our special teams," Davie said. "We can't keep asking our offense to score on long drives. For the amount of time we spend on the return.game, vve are not getting the productivity we expect." 
The greatest concern for the Irish right now rests with the status of back­up quarterback Arnez Battle. Battle

Autry Denson once again takes the prize with his 189-yard career best perfor­mance against the Bears. Not to mention he cleans up his own mess by chasing  "Those wristbands drive me nuts because I can't figure out what number it is.. We've never had that many numbers and I don't see very well."

It 'vVas the stuff of whicli. leg­ends are made -a blue, gray October sky and the echoes of the great Knute Rockne filling the Halloween night air. As they had 73 years ago, the Bears and their raucous Waco following stormed into South Bend. 
The hungry Bears, driven to the brink of despair by the recent poundings from Longhorns and Aggies, sought redemption. 
And they managed to stay with the Fighting Irish through the first 20 minutes of play, scratching and cla\ving on offense behind Derek Lagway, Jermaine Alfred and Odell James, ;vhile relying heavily on the strength of punter Mike Atteberry to pin Notre Dame deep in its own territory. 
But what these Bears forgot was that the entire Stadium is Notre Dame territory.

Denson sends Bears into hibernation, fans to jubliation 
ByJOEY CAVATO 
Associate Sports Editor 
Autry Denson 's best maneu­vering came after the game as he danced around the horde of television cameras, bright lights and reporters that surrounded him. 
After Notre Dame's destruc­tion of Baylor, 27-3, Denson found his way through the post­game celebration and media cir­cus until he reached the Notre Dame student section, where fans chanted his name. Denson poised for a picture in the first row of the student section with a friend who was celebrating her birthday. 
"Because I'm a senior, every game is meaningful," Denson said downplaying the signifi­cance of his 189 yards on the ground. "It's just a matter of going out and savoring every­thing that I have." 
The student section seemed to be savoring every Denson moment as well, as the cheers grew louder until he scrambled into the locker room to join his teammates, who are now 6-1. 
"It makes you l'eel good," Denson said in the post-game press conference. "But people love you when you're doing well and they don't when you're not. You try to keep it all in perspec­tive." 
Defenses have placed a target on No. 23 in recent weeks as he had to earn every one of his yards in wins over Stanford, Arizona State, and Army. But Denson exploded behind great offensive line play Saturday and averaged nearly eight yards a carry. 
"I think the credit should go to the offensive line and my full­backs," Denson said. "They did a great job all day. My job was easy I just had to run." 
"Everybody knows Autry is a great running back," Jarious Jackson said. "He is a big part of the offense and makes the offense go." 
The Baylor defense must have 
thought they were in the Old 
West as the draw killed them all 
afternoon. The Irish took advan­
tage of the Bears attacking 
defense by running draws to 
Denson, his specialty. 
"Autry Denson is really a good 
draw runner," head coach Bob 
Davie said. "That's really 
Autry's game." 
After Denson tromped all over 
the Bears in the first half with 
168 yards, Baylor head coach 
Dave Roberts probably wished 
he could have suited up NFL 
Hall of Fame linebacker and 
Baylor alum Mike Singletary to 
Mark Denson. 
But Baylor safeties Nikia Codie 
and Rodney Smith had to do the 
unenviable job of tracking down 
and tackling the elusive Denson. 
"I-le picks his holes and uses 
his blocks from his line," Codie 
said. "Once in the open field he's 
hard to tackle." 
Roberts also probably wished 
he hadn't recruited Denson to 
come to Notre Dame as Roberts 
saw Denson streak into the Bear 
secondary and he saw his team 
fall to 2-6. 
"You always want to see peo­
ple you recruited do well," 
Roberts said. "You just want to 
see your team do better." 
On Saturday no one was better 
than Denson, as he came within 
17 4 yards of Allen Pinke ti's all­
time Irish mark of4,131. But 
don't tell Denson that. 
"If I let things like that enter into my focus right now it will affect my game," Denson said. "I don't go out and run against numbers I have a hard time competing against numbers. I just wanted to go out and do whatever I could do to help the team." 
Although Denson appeared to 
be Superman shrugging off tack­
lers and always striving to gain 
that extra inch, he proved that 
he was human as he had two 
fumbles and even threw an 
interception. · 
Denson 'also flashed his grit as . he tracked down Baylor's Gary Baxter inside the 10-yard line 

. . . 
Tailback Autry Denson rushed for 189 yards, beating his personal best set earlier against Michigan. 
giving his defense a chance to hold the Bears to a field goal. 
"Anytime you can make them put the ball down again there'.s a chance you can play sudden change defense," Davie said. "That's why I wanted to keep him on defense four years ago." 
'Tm sure he knew he would have gotten chewed out if he wouldn't have made that tack­le," Jackson said. "But you can't blame Autry. I take all the blame for that because I called the wrong play." 
"I think our team is happy I'm not a quarterback," Denson said, referring to his ill-advised throw on a halfback pass in the second quarter. 'Tm glad they switched me when I was in high

Irish fans are certainly pleased they switched Denson to tailback and there isn't much doubt about what his calling is. 
"I think he'll have a great career after Notre Dame and I'm happy for him," Roberts said. 
Said Codie, "He is going to make it a long way." 
But just like Allen Pinkett and 4,132, Denson isn't thinking about anything except what's directly ahead of him and his team. 
"Right now we have four more games and I'm trying to win those games first," Denson said. "A lot of making it is a lot of luck. You have to stay healthy and get picked up by someone. I'm a senior and I'm just enjoy­ing every bit of this." 
Denson seemed to be more concerned with his fumbles. 
"I was always taught that it's a lack of courage the reason you fumble so I guess it was a lack of courage that I let the ball go," Denson said. 
But perhaps Sergeant Tim McCarthy of the Indiana State police said it best. with his Halloween message warning about the dangers of drunk dri­ving. 
"You don't have a ghost of a chance if you don't have the right spirit," he said . 
The right spirit is certainly instilled in No. 23.
