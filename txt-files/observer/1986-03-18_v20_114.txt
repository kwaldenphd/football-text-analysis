Honesty panelists present final report on cheating at ND 
By CLIFF STEVENS 
News Staff 
The University Honesty Com­mittee found "more cheating at Notre Dame than any of us wants," and recommended clearer and ''well-publicized" policies regarding academic dishonesty, more atten­tion to factors which contribute to cheating, and promotion of "hones­ty as a value," according to the committee's final report presented to the Academic Council yesterday. 
The report will now be submitted to student government and the col­lege councils for discussion in preparation for a formal decision by the Academic Council, accor­ding to Director of Public Rela­
tions  and  Information  Richard  
Conklin.  
"We  are  desirous of getting  as  

much feedback as we can· from students, faculty, and anyone else," said Associate Provost Father Ed­ward Malloy, chairman of the Honesty Committee. 
Recommending against in­stituting an honor code, the report held that student reportage of in­cidents of dishonesty is "essential" to ' an honor code while most students fail to report such in­cidents. 
Student government Academic Commissioner Earl Baker said this failure was part of the reason for removing Notre Dame's former honor code in the early 1970;;. 
The report section on the honor code also said academic honesty at Notre Dame is "not overwhelming or rampant" and "does not warrant a radical change, which may work no better than the present system .. 
The first recommendation of the "modified" policy on academic dishonesty in the report includes the preamble of the present policy on academic honesty in the faculty handbook. This preamble defines academic dishonesty as "presenting work not one's own" and states taht "serious injustice" is done by such dishonesty. 
The second recommendation calls for clearer policies and "primary responsibility for defin­ing standards of honesty" to be given to individual professors. The report states that professors should clarify their policies on "problematic" areas such as cooperative work on outside class assignments through oral and writ­ten statements made at the beginn­ing of courses. 
New  faculty  and  first-year  
students  should  especially  be  in­ 
formed  of  policies  regarding  

academic dishonesty, states the report. 
The third recommendation re­quests a pledge of honesty to be submitted by students with all work.

In Brief 
Ferdinand Marcos, former Philippines president, lost a bid yesterday to prevent his financial records from being turned over to the new Manilla government when a federal judge refused to intervene in the case. The new administration of President Corazon Aquino is eager to see the records as it attempts to piece together the story of what is said to be an estimated wealth of $5 billion, mostl amassed during a presidency when his salary was about $5,000. 
A statue of a black stable boy in front of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity house at the University of Florida prompted complaints to the student affairs office from students, staff and faculty. Althought the chapter president defended the statue as traditional, and not indicative of any racial bias, he said it elicits mixed feelings from the fraternity members. The student affairs office is investigating the complaints. -The Observer

Saint Mary's quick response averted worsening of tragedy 
The true test of an individual or of an institution often does not come until that person or institution faces a crisis situation. The recent discovery of a stillborn baby found at Saint Mary's, in a LeMans hall trash can, has shown the character of the Col­lege. 
Most larger colleges or universities might consider such a situation a tragedy, but not one that would af­fect the entire community. 
At a small institution such as Saint Mary's, however, such an incident did affect the entire com­munity, including administrators, faculty and students. 
Rumors were rampant at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's after the baby was discovered the morning of Feb. 28, the same morning William hickey was an­nounced as Saint Mary's new president. 
first reports were exaggerated of course; the birth was immediately deemed an abortion by the rumor mill. Stories grew worse from there. 
Such a situation had the potential to harm the stu­dent involved even further. The College, however, acted quickly to quell rumors and aid other students who had the misfortune of being nearby when the baby was discovered by a cleaning woman. 
Not only students in the woman's section of the dorm were deeply affected by the incident. The thought of a fellow student goving through such a troubled time, alone and hopeless, produced com­passion, shock and a sense of fear and vulnerability. 
Saint mary's administrators acted on this im­mediately, by first arranging counseling for members of the woman's section in LeMans, and later for the rest of the campus. A prayer service was held Sunday night after the incident. Resident assistants all over campus were instructed to meet with students and answer questions they still might have had about the incident. 
The following Sunday, small groups of faculty and staff traveled from section to section in each residence hall. These groups held informal discus­sion groups which answered questions such as the condition of the woman, the health and size of the baby, and whether it was baptized. 
Not only were members of the community shock­ed by the discovery of the baby's body. Since the in­cident had originally been under police investiga­tion, court documents were open to the media. The story began appearing on the Associated Press wire, in USA Today and other newspapers around the country. The report of an apparently unknown pregnancy in a small, affluent Catholic school had great news potential, and the media jumped on it. 
Subsequent letters from administrators followed during the next week: from Mary Feeley, director of Campus Ministry, inviting students and faculty to a special liturgy; William Hickey, College president; and Mary Anne O'Donnell, acting dean of student affairs; assuring students the woman was in good condition and helped to clear the air of any remain­ing rumors. 
Some students were quick to criticize what they saw as an unhealthy atmosphere about sexuality at the College, and pointed to it as a cause for the stu­dent's situation deteriorating to that point. 
Thenesa A. Gua1rino 
Saint Mmy's Executive Editor 

Saint Mary's, however, has made a point this year to try and provide an open-minded atmosphere on campus about sexuality, as shown in their Sexuality Education Series, sponsored in February by the Sex­uality Education Council. 
The student involved was a freshman who perhaps was not aware of the services available to her, or un­willing to reveal her situation to anyone. No in­stitution or individual can be blamed for what hap­pened. Students should be more concerned with aiding the woman in her return to the College com­munity, if she chooses to return, than pointing fingers. 
Most talk about the incident has now passed, and by the end of the year nearly all will be forgotten for those not directly involved in the incident. Quick response, squelching of rumors, prayer and counseling, were necessary and the College provided them. What could have been an even more harmful incident was tempered. 
Individual members of the college and the in­stitution itself rose to the occasion and alleviated a tragic situation.

BIBLICAL JOURNEY V 
WITH FATHER JAMES T. BURTCHAELL, C.S.C. Professor of Theology, The University of Notre Dame 
This journey is intended for people who do not want a tour dis­guised as a pilgrimage. It will be a serious journey to the land of holy places-Canaan/Palestine/Israel & Judah-the land of Jesus. the home of His Hebrew forebears, and the shrine for His Christian and Moslem believers. 


We shall visit quite a few places, but shall take the time to read appropriate scripture passages in situ and to meditate. We shall not be staying at luxury hote;s, but at clean, comfortable places chosen for their proximity to the holy sites, where we will be well fed. Our guides, our invited lecturers and I shall offer background information-history, ar­shaeology, exegesis-but we take it that your main interest is a more immediate religiou;:; and theological understanding of the biblical faith. Therre is also the ancient beauty of the stones which has its own power beyond explanation. 
I am hoping that we form a friendly fellowship on this journey and enjoy some worship together. Fr. James T. Burtchaell, C.S.C.

Reagan surprised at St. Pat's lunch 
Associated press 
WASHINGTON -As President Reagan sat down for a St. Patrick's Day lunch of corned beef and cab­bage, a leprechaun jumped on the chair next to him in the Cabinet Room and quickly twisted a long green balloon into a shamrock. 
Aides whispered the shenanigan was the work of another Irish­American in the White House, Chief of Staff Donald Regan. 
The president, taking note of a roomful of reporters and camera crews not usually permitted at his weekly policy lunch with senior ad­visers, looked around as he entered the room and said, "Guess who's coming to lunch." 
He already had marked the feast day of Ireland's patron saint at a White House Rose Garden ceremony with Prime Minister Gar­rett FitzGerald of Ireland. Wearing a large green shamrock lapel pin, the president, who is of Irish des­cent, reminisced with FitzGerald about his trip to Ireland two years ago and pledged support for a $250-million U.S. aid package to help Ireland implement its historic accord with Britain on the future of Northern Ireland. 
So Reagan hardly seemed prepared for the pranks that came later. But his Irish eyes were smil­ing when, just as he took his seat for lunch, the door opened, and abagpiper in full regalia marched in

followed by a young lady who danced a high-stepping jig behind the president's chair. 
Reagan kept smiling through a solo of "Oh Ronnie Boy," sung by Daniel Sugrue to the tune of "Dan­ny Boy." 
But he looked genuinely taken aback when Alfedo Comignani, a 4-foot, 2-inch clown in green top hat and tails, rushed into the room, identified himself as "the under secretary" and climbed onto the chair next to Reagan's to blow up a balloon. The ersatz leprechaun quickly twisted the green balloon into a shamrock and presented it to the president "on behalf of Irish Americans all over." 
In the Rose Garden earlier, Fit­zgerald presented Reagan with a large Waterford crystal bowl filled to the brim with fresh shamrocks and a two-foot crystal replica of the Statue of Liberty. 
In a statement issued in honor of the holiday, Reagan said the day recognized "the many achievements sung and unsung, of the Irish men and women who have made this a better and happier world." 
HOW TO AVOID THE DANGERS 
OF COUNTERFEIT AUTO PARTS 
INFERIOR ::>ARTS COULD THREATEN YOUR SAFETY 
Today, a counterfeiter no longer has to print phony twenty-dollar bills. Selling imitation automotive replace­ment parts-packaged to resemble products fmm legit­imate manufacturers-is big business. 
For people who buy and use counterfeit auto parts, though, the conse­quences can be costly. For example, body panels may require expensive labor to bring their finish quality up to the rest of the car. Bogus oil filters have failed after 200 miles, causing unpro­tected engines to seize up, requiring their complete replacement. 
Inferior transmission fluid has solidified at 0° Fahrenheit. ruining trans­missions. And counterfeit antifreeze has eaten right through aluminum parts. 
The failure can be safety-related. A fatal 1985 bus accident in Britain was attributed to the installation of counte1feit brake parts. Ill­fitting counterfeit gas caps can fall off. increasing the risk of a fire in a roll-over accident. 
Here's how to make sure you receive parts that are made to work best in your GM car. Your most reliable source is your GM dealer. He can supply any part for your GM car or truck. Buying popular brand parts from reputable stores or garages is another way to improv~ your chances of getting the right part. But ,_,, herever you buy, be sus­picious of discounts that seem too good to be true. 
Some tip-offs that a 
part might be ~ounterfeit: 
Flimsy packaging. 
Lack of name-brand 
identification such as 
AC-Delco. 
"Look-alike" graphics or a change in the spelling of a recognized trade name. In this way counterfeiters can avoid prosecution under the 1984 Trademark Counter· feiting Law. So examine the package carefully. 
If a replacement part doesn't fit easily, you should probably return it. A repu­table distributor will almost certainly give you a refund or credit. 
General Motors is tak­ing strong measures in the 
U.S. and overseas to put a stop to parts counter­feiting. GM is trying to stop the problem at its source. 
So far we've helped U.S. marshals confiscate parts in raids on 29 counterfeiting operations. Another eight operations have been un­covered and prosecuted in foreign countries. 
GM is also developing a hologram identification device, much like those be­coming popular on credit cards, to improve security in our parts distribution. 
After all, General Motors has a tremendous investment in GM parts that work together to give our customers safe. reliable cars and trucks. We want our cus­tomers to be confident they can maintain their GM vehi· cles at the same level of high quality we build them.

The creation of these College

"Practical Mysticism" is about developing the human capacity to see and celebrate the mystery of God in ordinary life events. Accor­ding to Leckey, Underhill places mysticism within the context of reality, and therein lies the appeal of mystical development for the secular Christian. 
According to Leckey, the in­fluence of this particular work on her life was felt many years ago when it, along with other pieces by Underhill, helped her to believe that she, too, could live in intimacy with the Divine Reality. "Underhill identified for me the deepest long­ing of my soul and pointed to the

University Honesty Committee member Professor Robert Wegs said the Academic Council discuss­ed modifying the report recommen­dation that leaves to the individual professor the decision whether or not to report an infraction to a dean with "something sterner." 
He said the possibility of in­cluding a requirement that pro­fessors report infractions was discussed. 
Citing the different attitudes of faculty on reporting cheating, Wegs said the procedure suggested by the report "could lead to ine­quities." 
Committee member Professor Stephen Batill said that while the present policy requires faculty to report infractions to departmental ·honesty committees, the procedure is rarely followed. 
"I believe that if you have a rigid and formalized set of procedures, that doesn't allow for individuals with experience to make value judgments," Batill said. 
Wegs said the issue should prove a "big debating point" in the up­coming campus discussions of the report.

Process of making Christians impoverished at ND 
------------~---­
The March 4 edition of The Observer car­ried an article by Lester Flemons concerning the making of converts to Catholicism at Notre Dame. It should be said at the outset that this letter is not intended as a critique of Flemons' reporting. His unfamiliarity with the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults is quite apparent, and a greater attention to detail generally would have improved the ar­ticle. 
Michael X. Ball 
guest column 
But on the main issue of how the process of preparation for baptism is understood by University Ministry, it is my suspicion that Flemons has reported accurately. More is the pity. 
The Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults was promulgated by Pope Paul VI in January, 1972. The rite is really several things: it is a ritual which in stages, prepares unchurched individuals for initiation into the Church, sacramentalizing the process of con­version to the faith in Jesus Christ; it is, at another level, a philosophy of Church life, emphasizing as it does, the active role to be played by all members of the baptized com­munity in the making of new Christians (parishes often engage as many as 50 to 100 individu-als in DIRECT contact with even a small group of candidates for baptism); it is, in this connection, a sort of blueprint for building up the Christian Church. 
What it is not, alas, is everything the arti­cle depicts it to be. It is not "an organiza­tion;" it is not primarily concerned with the transmission of Roman Catholic doctrine; more basically (and more importantly), it is not preparation for "Catholic" baptism -it is Christian initiation (including baptism, con­firmation, and eucharist) for which the catechumens are preapred. 
The clearest indication of the importance of this distinction is seen in the fact that Christians baptized in communions other than Roman Catholic are not rebaptized when they join the Roman Church. "Conver­sion" was the term in common use prior to Vatican II for describing the shifting of membership from one Christian denomina­tion to another. It did not carry, at that time, doctrinal overtones. 
To "convert" meant to accept the confes­sional beliefs and practices of the body one sought to join. In the aftermath of Vatican II the rite understands conversion very dif­ferently, as a process by which "hearts (are) 
Doonesbury 
opened by the Holy Spirit ... " so that the catechumens might "adhere to him who is in the way, the truth, and the life," being "call­ed away from sin and drawn toward the mystery of God's love," (nos. 9, 10). 
The rite envisions this as an open-ended process which may last several years, and the emphasis is on the spiritual development of the whole person. The approach apparently being taken by University Ministry, under Father Andre Leveille, is fundamentally out­moded. The rite understands, and clearly states, that conversion to Jesus Christ cannot be accompli-shed by two semesters of classroom instruction. 
If the Flemons article accurately describes the process of making Christians here at Notre Dame, that process is profoundly im­poverished. The teaching of doctrine is only one of four main aspects of the preparation for baptism. The rite speaks of the role of the sponsor, in helping the candidate to learn to pray more easily, to witness the faith, to trust in the Lord and to exercise Christian charity (no. 19). 
This is accomplished, in part, by an inten­sive relationship between sponsor and catechumen, by trust growing from Chris­tian charity, by the sharing of life stories to teach the Christian life in a concrete way. If the article is correct, Leveille's "sponsors" are limited to reading a catechism with the candidate, one hour per week. 
Finally, the catechumenate involves the preparation of the candidates for the "apostolic" life. This is accomplished by their insertion into what we hope is the active life of the community in spreading the Gospel and building up the Church (no. 19). 
Whatever the local church is doing in the larger surrounding community, the catechumens should be included, helped gradually to take part in the apostolic work of the Church. At Notre Dame this might mean a planned involvement in some of the many pastoral activities of the Center for Social Concerns. If the article is accurate, Leveille's program seems to neglect this dimension, as well. 
Many people feel that the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults is the "jewel" of the con­ciliar renewal. It understands Christian faith and the life of the Church in dynamic terms. I have personally seen it bring new life to a parish which had practically ceased to exist. In our day, we need committed Christians, people who follow Jesus and live the Chris­tian Gospel with their whole being. 
The rite takes Christian baptism seriously; it knows the woundedness of our world can be healed by people who are willing to give deeply of themselves. This is why it places its emphasis on the conversion of the whole per­son. 
University Ministry, by this account and others, is doing its student catechumens a great disservice. Leveille appears obsessed with the teaching of a catechism and with denominational distinctions which cause him to make such unfortunate statements as: "We are preparing them for Catholic bap­tism." 
Significantly, the rite-the official Roman ritual -does not use the term "Catholic." There is really no "Catholic" baptism. We are baptized into Christ, not into a body of doctrine. 
Under the present conditions, it is the stu­dent catechumens who are deprived, depriv­ed! of the full riches of Church life. But it is also the Church which is deprived, deprived of the breadth and richness of these new per­sonalities, deprived of the full spirit of these 
ne:w Christians. 
Come the time of their baptisms, they may be: able to pass a test on "Church teachings," but will we know them, and will they know us? And if we fail to know each other, how, pray tell, shall we know the Lord?

Switek and Montanaro led a revolution at ND 
It may have been the first election won with crayons. 
But it is not; it was a statement by 2,112 students that they are fed up with student government and elections. Mike Switek and Don Montanaro led a revolution of sorts this past week, a revolution against traditonal stu· dent politics. From the way some people talk, it seems that anarchy will sweep over Notre Dame because Switek, not Jim Domagalski, was elected to lead us. 
Eric M. Bergamo here's to future days 
52 percent of those who voted favored the Switek ticket. Switek did not offer to trans· form social life at Notre Dame into a paradise overnight. Switek did not promise that the ad­ministration would suddenly start to listen to student demands once they were in office. Switek did not have the gleaming credentials of his opponent. What Switek did offer was a fresh break from the drudgery of"I can do the job better because ... " of past student elec­tions. Switek gave us a campaign that was fun and out of the ordinary. Their comical cam­paign posters were a pleasing respite from posters that droned on and on about can· didates' qualifications and platforms that of· fered everything except the moon. Let's face it, Switek and Montanaro bucked the tradi­tional student political system. And they won. 
After the unintentionally funny administra­tion of Bill Healy, Switek will be a well-deserved change. Instead ofhaving a stu·

dent body president who is preoccupied with matters of political nature and ambitions, we m21y have a president that truly cares about the: welfare of the students and their lives at Notre Dame. We have a president who promises to make living at Notre Dame fun, to put the smiles back on our faces, to make stu­dent government accesible to the students of Notre Dame. 
It is time for those who voted for Domagalski to concede that their man was dt:feated and that the opponent has been ekcted president. It is time to put aside these fedings and unite behind Switek, for dissen· sion will only harm student government more than help it. We have the chance to truly change student government, but only if we act together as a community. 
Switek may not have promised the stars to us or blinded us with gleaming credentials and endless experience. But he does have en­thusiasm and a willingness to learn more about his new position. We cannot question that he deserved to be elected. He was ekcted, period. And now it is our respon· sibility to give him a chance to prove himself. 
There was a revolution here at Notre Dame, spearheaded by crayons and wit. Hopefully, this is the revolution, based in comedy and wit, that makes student government a joke no longer.

Providence, an unlikely survivor among the six Big East teams that qualified for post-season basketball tournaments, avoided further em­harassment for the conference last night with a 90-71 victory over George Mason in the second round of the National Invitational Tour­nament. 
Providence, with Harold Starks and Steve Wright igniting a power­ful inside game that all but decided the issue early in the second half, was one of seven teams to advance last night to the NIT quarterfinals. ­
In other NIT games, it was Clem­son 77, Georgia 65; Florida 77, TCU 75; Southwest Missouri 83, Marquette 69; Louisiana Tech 77, McNeese State 66; Ohio State 71, Texas 65; and Wyoming 99, Loyola Calif. 90.

Three of top four seeds advance 
Longshots move on in NCAAs 
Soviet skaters dominate at Worlds 
Associated Press 
Down to the Sweet Sixteen, the NCAA basketball tournament still has an interesting mix of favorites and longshots as the road to Dallas weaves through four more regional sites this weekend. 
Three of the four top seeds sur­vived the sub-regional rounds, with only St. John's, assigned the No. 1 slot in the West, knocked out of the tournament. The other top seeds, Duke in the East, Kentucky in the Southeast and Kansas in the Midwest, all remain in business and are favored in their next games. 
Also still alive are longshots like DePaul and Cleveland State, No. 12 and No. 14, respectively, in the East region, Louisiana State, No. 11 in the Souteast, Michigan State, North Carolina State and Iowa State, who were Nos. 5-6-7 in the Midwest, and Auburn, which went as the No.8 in the West. 
The tournament resumes Thursday with West Regional games matching Auburn against Nevada-Las Vegas and North

GENEVA, Switzerland Soviets Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov stole the show and an early lead over the defending champions yesterday in pairs com­petition at the World Figure Stak­ing Championships with a sassy, skillful routine to a ragtime beat. 
A 1-2-3 showing in the short pro­gram of pairs topped a good open­ing day for the Soviets. Defending world champion Alexander Fadeev gained an early edge with the low scorein the men's complusory figures. The top American, Brian Boitano, was fourth. 
The 4-foot-11, 14-year-old Gordeeva and the 19-year-old Grinkov, tallied mostly 5.8s and 5.9s from the judges. 
Five of nine judges awarded them first place in the two-minute compulsory short program, while defending titlists Elena Valova and Oleg Vasiliev won the top scores from the other four judges and were in second place. 
In third place were last year's runners-up, Larisa Selezneva and Oleg Makarov, appearing in their first international competition since being injured. 
Medals in pairs will be awarded today after the free-skating pro­gram. 
Fadeev, 22, of Moscow, skated clean figures to clear the top fac­tored place with a score of 0.6 in the men's event that kicked off six days of competition at Vernets Sports Center. 
Last night's strong start for Gordeeva and Grinkov continued a string of winning performances for the young pair from Moscow. They were last year's Junior World Champions and finished second at last month's European Champion­ships in their senior debut. 
To the strains of Scott Joplin and 
buoyed by the enthusiasm of the 
crowd, Gordeeva and Grinkov 
flawlessly finished all seven re­
quired moves. But it was their style 
-sometimes strutting down the ice 
arm in arm -that won the au­
dience. 
In fourth place were Canadian 
champions Cynthia Coull and 
Mark Rowson, while the U.S. 
champions Gillian Wachsman and 
Todd Waggoner were fifth. 
In second place in the men's com­
pulsory figures, which count 30 
percent toward the final score, was 
22-year-old Jozef Sabovcik of 
Czechoslovakia, with 1.2, while 
Heiko Fischer, 26, of West Ger­

Carolina against Louisville at Houston. Kentucky plays Alabama and LSU faces Georgia Tech at Atlanta in· the Southeast matchups. 
Friday, the East Regional at East Rutherford, N.J. has Duke against DePaul and Cleveland State play­ing Navy. At Kansas City that night, the Midwest pairings are Kansas vs. Michigan State and 
N.C. State against Iowa State. 
The betting line runs from Duke as a comfortable 9 1/2-point choice over DePaul, to Auburn and Nevada-Las Vegas, listed as pick 'em. In between those extremes, Georgia Tech is favored by 8, Kan­sas by 7, Kentucky and Navy each by 3, N.C. State by 25 and North Carolina by 1. 
Kevin Mackey, Cleveland State's young coach, never had met In­diana coach Bobby Knight before the tournament. When they shook hands, Mackey said, "Go easy on us." Even though Knight knew bet­ter than to be sweet-talked into complacency, it didn't help the Hoosiers to avoid the upset.

When Cleveland State beat St. Joseph's, Pa., in the second round, 20-year-old freshman Mouse McFadden, the team's high scorer, exulted, "That's for all you doubters, all you people who give everybody else the pub (publicity)." 
DePaul's publicity had been mostly bad during a 12-loss season. But the Blue Demons sprung con­secutive surprises on virginia and Oklahoma. 
Had the West seed held form, Nevada-Las Vegas would have played St. John's next. Instead, the Runnin' Regels will get a physical Auburn team, which eliminated the Redmen. Coach Jerry Tarkanian wasn't complaining though. "I'm just glad we're playing," he said. 
In the Southeast, LSU, which benefited playing the sub-regional round at home in Baton Rouge, faces a role reversal against Georgia Tech. Its next round is in the Omni at Atlanta, about 15 minutes from the Tech campus and where the Engineers have played a half dozen games this season.

PGA Tour finds itself involved in controversy 
Associated Press 
ORLANDO, Fla. -The PGA 
tour is in turmoil. 
Mac O'Grady is threatening a 
court suit. Seve Ballesteros of 
Spain is muttering darkly of a per­
sonal vendetta. Dean Beman has 
proposed disciplinary action that is 
the most severe in the 12 years he 
has been commissioner. 
Bernhard Langer of West Ger­many is wrestling with complex tax problems that have a bearing on his part on the American tour. 
About 40-50 players held an im­promptu, closed door meeting last weekend "to discuss current pro­blems and possible solutions." 
Another meeting is scheduled tomorrow at New Orleans. That meeting precedes by one day Ballesteros' scheduled start in the only tour event in which he is eligi­ble this year and will follow im­mediately the first head-to-head session between the commissioner and O'Grady's attorney, Steve Novak. 
At the center of the complex situation -the partial banishment of Ballesteros, a proposed suspen­sion of O'Grady, the target of O'Grady's scathing comments -is the beleaguered Beman. 
He's under attack by O'Grady. He's under attack by Ballesteros. And he's being questioned by other players who support the positions of those two players. 
The tax situation facing Langer, winner of the Masters tournament, is the least controversial. 
Simply, the West German resi­dent and native is taxed on his worldwide earnings by his home country. To retain his non-resident alien status in the United States ­and thus avoid another tax on his worldwide earnings -he is limited in the number of days he can play in this country. That limitation prohibits him from playing the 15 American tournaments required by PGA tour regulations. 
Beman has indicated that an ac­commodation probably will be made. 
The flambouyant Ballesteros, perhaps the finest player in the world, was stripped of his member­ship on the American tour after failing to appear in 15 U.S. tour­naments in 1985, as he had agreed to do. He played in nine. 
Following tournament regula­tions in this case -which Ballesteros helped draft -the Tour Policy Board revoked his membership for a year and made him ineligible for PGA tour events. Exceptions were made for the Masters, U.S. Open and PGA (which are not PGA tour events) and this week's USF&G classic at New Orleans, in which Ballesteros is the defending cham­pion. 
O'Grady, in his fourth season on the tour, has made a series of bitter personal attacks on Beman this year, apparently as a result of a $500 fine Beman imposed for an in­cident at New Orleans in 1984. 
When O'Grady was quoted as saying he would not pay the fine, the money was withheld from the player's check from winnings in a subsequent tournament. 
O'Grady's response: "Deane Beman is a thief with a capital T .. . our problem is we happen to have a commissioner who runs the PGA tour as if it is his totalitarian, authoritarian system. It's his dic­tatorship and his regime, with ar­bitrary rules." 
At first, Beman disassociated himself from any action, referring the matter to PGA tour Tourna­ment Director Jack Tuthill for in­vestigation and recommendation. Tuthill served O'Grady with two notices of proposed intermediate penalties, which call for up to $1,000 in fines and three weeks suspension on each count. 
When O'Grady's remarks con­tinued to appear in print, Beman stepped in. Last week he proposed a major penalty against O'Grady, $5,000 to $10,000 in fines and up to six weeks suspension -in addition to the early actions. 
O'Grady has 30 days to respond. He's given the matter to his at­torney.

Williams leads Pacers over Knicks 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS Herb Williams scored a career-high 40
) points in the Indiana Pacers' 112-92 win over the New York Knicks yesterday, but he had some help from the bench: Coach George Ir­vine. ''We were told he had 33 points so we left him in for a couple extra shots so he could get his career high," Irvine said. 
"I'm glad he did it," responded Williams, whose previous NBA high was 37 points on a couple of different occasions, including a 107-83 win over the Knicks Dec. 6. 
Associated Press 
The once-mighty Pacific-10 con­ference, championed through the years by UCLA in NCAA basket­ball tournament play, may be developing an inferiority complex. 
And it would seem justified. 

The conference ego was on the line last Friday when Arizona, the Pac-10 champions, took on Auburn in the first round of the NCAA West Regional at the Long Beach Arena. 
But the Wildcats couldn't keep up with Auburn in the final minutes and lost 73-63, giving the Pac-10 an 0-6 record in NCAA first-round games the past two years. 
Southern Cal, Arizona, Washington and Oregon State were the victims in 1985. Washington preceded Arizona in defeat this year, falling to Michigan State on Thursday night. 
"It's another slap at the Pac-10, 1­guess," Arizona Coach Lute Olson said after the Wildcats' loss. "I don't know. But it's not a slap at 
Irish 
continued from page 12 
Three team members played in­

jured yesterday. Steve Skupien was 
slightly ill with the flu, Mike 
Rogers had a pulled hamstring, and 
Ken Soos played on an injured 
ankle. 
Coach Gallo has been impressed 

with the offensive output of the 
Irish. 
''We've been hitting with more 

consistency," said Gallo. "With Ti­
m Hutson and Rich Vanthournout 
hitting over 10 RBis in the last four 
games, we're really coming 
through. We're playing longball 
and driving the ball." 
Coach Gallo attributed the heavy 

hitting to preseason workouts with 
wooden bats. 
"Aluminum bats give you a false 

sense of security," he said. "I hate 
aluminum bats. But when it comes 
to actually hitting in a game with 
them, it's like a difference between 
a knife and a gun." 
Although Tom Shields is doubt­

ful for the rest of the season, Coach 
Gallo likes what he is doing a great 
job," he said. "He gets tremendous 
power in his short compact swing. 
Nobody works harder than he does."

"You don't have nights like this very often. And it's a good feeling to accomplish something at the end the way people were starting to yell. I knew I had a lot of points but I don't count as I'm playing," the 6­ll forward said. 
Williams, who also grabbed 14 rebounds, had scored Indiana's last nine points in the first half and scored 21 of the Pacers' 25 points in one stint. 
He started his spurt with a layup that gave Indiana a 53-41 advan­tage with 1:41 remaining in the opening half. His two free throws gave Indiana a 60-43 halftime ad­vantage and the Knicks never drew

''Williams should want to play against us all the time," said Knicks Coach Hubie Brown. "He had an easy time of it tonight. He was posting up and playing against our small forwards. His size and strength overwhelmed us. 
"Williams put together a real nice game. That man has a lot of talent. He ought to play like that all the time," Brown added. 
The Knicks, losing their eighth straight game and their 12th in 13, shot only 33 percent from the field in the first half and fell behind by as many as 25 in the third quarter when they shot just 31 percent. 
our guys; I'm proud of what we've done this year." 
The Pac-10 didn't have any better luck in the National Invitation Tournament this time around. 
UCLA, the NCAA champion 10 times under John Wooden in the 1960s and 70s and defending NIT champion, was upset 80-74 by Cal­Irvine of the Pacific Coast Athletic Association in a first-round NIT game Thursday night. 
"It wasn't like playing the UCLA of old," said Irvine forward Johnny Rogers, who scored 29 points in the victory at Pauley Pavilion, where the Bruins once were practically in­vincible. "But getting UCLA at their place is great for· a program that gets no respect." 
The same night, Cal lost an NIT game to Loyola Marymount of the West Coast Athletic Conference, giving the Pac-10 its third tourna­ment loss of the evening. 
"It was a bad night for the Pac­10," UCLA coach Walt Hazzard said afterward.

Volleyball Club gains revenge over Calvin 
Revenge was the word for the Volleyball Club as it par­ticipated in several matches last week. On Monday the Irish avenged an earlier loss by beating Calvin College, 15-7,16-14,6-15, 10-15, 15-9. The grudge factor was also present as the team took on Wisconsin in Madison. The Irish seemed prepared to pay back the Badgers, taking the first game 15-13. But the roof caved in as the team lost the next three games, 2-15,8-15,6-15. 
"We won the first game, and the momentum was going our way," said Head Coach Bill Anderson. "But I put in a new server the second game. If that's what caused the momentum swing, then I'll take responsibility. 
"We also broke down in the middle. They ran a middle attack, and we weren't able to block." 
The loss cost the club the regular season championship in the club division of the Midwest Intercollegiate Volleyball Association. But while the Irish may have lost the battle, they still have a chance to win the war as the MIV A postseason tournament is coming up in April. 
The Irish also took on the ninth-ranked Cardinals of Ball State in a home match Wednesday. Despite playing extremely well, they dropped the shortened match, 15-8 10-15, 10-15. 
"We just broke down in spurts," noted Anderson. "We

Toniight the team travels to West Lafayette to take on Purdue, then will return home to play Western Michigan on Wednesday. Then, after break, the team will have one more match against 12th-ranked IUPU-Fort Wayne. There is a chance this game will be moved from the Pit to the main arena of the ACC in the hope of breaking the MIV A regular season attendance record. Look for details of this AprilS contest after break.

The Gymnastics Club's men's team wrapped up its 
season over the weekend in a triangular meet against Eastern Michigan and Lacrosse (Wis.). 
The final score shows the Irish edgingLacrosse by two points, whil.e scoring about half as many points as Eastern Michigan. And in the all-around competition, Matt Sennetlt of Notre Dame placed second to Mike Sher­man of Eastern Michigan by 21 points. 
But before you jump to conclusions, it should be noted that this meet was hosted by Eastern Michigan, an ex­perienced varsity squad, to help the Notre Dame and Lacrosse teams gain experience against varsity competi­tion. 
"Eastern Michigan holds this meet basically just to help out the club teams," said Club President Jim Ciesil. "Actually \Ye did very well in this meet. It's just the dif­ference between the varsity and the club teams." 
Ciesil again was the top Irish performer in the floor ex­ercise, placing sixth with an 8.3. He also tied with Sennett for fifth in the parallel bars, as both scored a 5.4 Rob Lee also did well., scoring an 8.05 in the vault. 
The club ~~ill now hold practices three times a week for the underclassmen to work on new maneuvers for next season.
