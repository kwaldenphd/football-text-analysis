ND, SMC elect class representatives in seven races 

Alumni Association honors students 
Class Elections Results 
By NICK SWEEDO 
News Writer 
Notre Dame undergrad­uate student Brett Perkins and graduate stu­dent April Langley were recently chosen as the recipients of the 2001 Alumni Association Distinguished Student awards. 
The Alumni Association annually awards two stu­dents who best exemplify the spirit of Notre Dame through community ser­vice and academic excel­lence. 
"We are blessed to have two people who exemplify many students at Notre Dame in what they do for the community, in the classroom and for fellow Notre Dame students," said Chuck Lennon, the Executive Director of the Alumni Association. "They are truly great rep­resentatives of what the Alumni Association tries to do with this award, that is, honoring two great young people." 
Perkins is a senior finance major and theolo­gy minor. In addition to his studies, he is presi­dent of the handbell choir, vice-president of Beta Gamma Sigma. a resident assistant of Keough Hall and a stu­dent coordinator of the NDE retreats. He also actively participates in the Knights of Columbus chapter, Celebration Choir and the RCIA (Right of Christian Initiation of Adults). 
Perkins said time man­agement was the key to balancing his many activi­ties. 
"I remember what my freshman chemistry teacher. Dr. Rudy Bottei, told our class. He told us to make use of 'prime­time' hours from nine to five. so I try to take advantage of that. That usually leaves the evenings open for extra­curricular activities," he said. "Throughout my hectic schedule, I always try to keep the focus on God, always remembering that there's a greater meaning in everything I do and that everything I do helps strengthen the kingdom of God." 
After  graduation,  
Perkins  will  work  in  
Chicago  for  Arthur  

Andersen as a business consultant. 
Langley is currently working on her doctoral thesis in English and has a 4.0 GPA. She has taught freshman composition at Notre Dame and has been

ByJASON McFARLEY Assistanr News Editor 
Winning tickets from the classes of 2002 and 2003 notched big victories in Wednesday's class council primary while the election set up a runoff between two tickets on the 2004 ballot. 
The Peter Rossmann ticket captured 63 percent of the 2002 vote to comfortably defeat the Becky Hagelin ticket 461-252. In the 2003 race, Matt Smith's ticket carried more than 66 percent of votes on its way to an easy 629­297 win over the Son Nguyen ticket. 
In the 2004 contest, which featured seven tickets, the Keri Oxley ticket emerged the clear favorite -leading its nearest challenger by nearly 300 votes -but failed to receive a majority of the 1,140 cast ballots. The Oxley ticket's 469 votes asserted it as the top con-

Bookstore costs committee created 
By I.AURA ROMPF As.isrant News Ediror 
Communication between facul­ty, students and the bookstore is essential for positive changes to be made, Knott Hall senator Michael Pfaff told the senate Wednesday night. 
Pfaff. along with the Academic Affairs committee, presented a resolution regarding the forma­tion of the bookstore academic committee. 
"We want to investigate how the bookstore is run and how the bookstore can better serve the student body," Pfaff said. "Right now. there is no formal forum between the student body and the bookstore. This resolu­tion will create a forum." 
Pfaff said the new committee will be comprised of two sena­tors, a Student Union Board {SUB) member. a member of Flipside, an office of the presi­dent representative, a faculty senate member and a member 
of the bookstore's managerial staff. 
"The goal of this committee will be to serve student interests as well as the bookstore's inter­ests," Pfaff said. "We want the bookstore to be a more integral part of student academic life and student social life." 
Praff said members of SUB and Flipside were included on the committee because suggestions have been made to use the

INSIDE COLUMN 



Hanging Up 
I had a two-mi nut~ phone conversation 

tonight. Actually. when I really sit down and think about it, I've probablv had a two-minute phone conversation every day this week. Admittedly, it's hardly ample time to "reach out and I.ouch someone" -in fact. it's not even adequate time for a healthy hello and goodbye. I could justify it if my phone were broken or my bill was too high, but sadly, the reason my con­versations are so short is 
me. 
A two-minute phone con­versation is not a mortal sin; in fact, most of us have one every day. We use them to call up to friends· dorm rooms to let them know we're waiting out­side, we use them to set up times to meet in the dining hall. We use them to make appoinlmenl.5; we use them to confirm plans for Heartland and Senior Bar. 
But when that two-minute phone conversation consists of your entire relationship, it can start to feel like a mortal sin. 
Last October, the military sent my boyfriend packing to llichmond. VA-a grand total of 
708.3 miles from South Bend (driving time approximately 12 hours barring any traffic delays.) The typical US Airways flight can get me there in about five hours, at the average cost of $255.50, granted I book at least 14 days in advance. With the crippling disabilities of few free weekends and a distressed bank account, the telephone onds up making up the bulk of our communication -and our relationship. 
Essentially. our relationship has ended up completely dependent on a third party -it's not just Noreen and Mark, it's Noreen, Mark and the telephone. While l'rn gratefully endebted to this third party that keeps our relationship going, I'm beginning to resent its constraints. With two dif­ferent schedulos -his lasting during the peak day hours and mine pumping through the night -neither of us end up near the telephone often enough to make a connection. 
It usually goes something like this: I glance at the clock and realize that once my shift is over, he'sjustgetting up. 'I could call,' I think to myself, and pick up the phone as he's running out the door. As we say goodbye. there's this awkward moment where we don't know whether to say 'good morning' or 'good night' ­after all, it's different for each of us. 
Hence the two minute conversation. 
As much as I resent it. I am grateful for lhe two-minute conversation. I could write letters or pour my soul out over email, but the phone lets me hear his voice. And when you're 708.3 miles, $255.50 and 12 hours apart. every minute counts. 
They say when you get into a long-distance relationship, it's not going to be easy. They say to avoid it at all costs, that it's going to fail. I imagine the reason they warn you is because of the two-minute conversation: the frustration, the guilt and the sadness you feel when you get off the phone. 
But I'll take my two minutes any day of the week over nothing. I'd take two seconds. And I know when I have time during the day on Saturday. when neither of us are working, I'll pick up the phone and call. 
And I'll talk for two hours.

Penn State president defends Sex Faire events 
HARRISBURG 

Several state representatives joined the crusade against sexually explicit student events Tuesday at Pennsylvania State University's House Appropriations Committee hearing. 
As promised, state Rep. John Lawless played a five-minute video excerpted from one made at the stu­dent-run Sex Faire earlier this month. He repeated his statements that Penn State should be punished for failing to be "moral" leaders. 
Lawmakers grilled Penn State President Graham Spanier in a four­hour session, broken only by breaks for the stenographer. Most discussion was about the appropriateness of the sexually provocative events sponsored by Womyn's Concerns.

'They feel powerful and they feel like rebelling right now. It's the only way they feel like they can get it out.'' At game's end, the roar began all over the campus as students poured from their dorms. Before the festivities began, "Bring out the riot gear" sounded over police radios.

Boys only suspects in murders 
Authorities are not searching for any additional sus­pects in the murders of Dartmouth College professors Susanne and Half Zantop. according to sources that spoke with the Associated Press. A source familiar with the investigation told the AP yesterday that the evidence has not indicated anyone other than Hobert Tulloch, 17, and James Parker. 16, was involved in the murder. The source said although the investiga­tion continues while authorities have already arrested the two teenagers. additional arrests are not expect­ed. Authorities have released little information about the murders, but more details were expected today when a New Hampshire judge had planned to unseal portions of affidavits and search warrants. Ilowever, the Valley News reported yesterday that additional forensic evidence was strengthening the investigators' case for keeping court records sealed. The state filed an appeal Tuesday to block the unsealing. Lebanon District Court Judge Albert J. Cirone Jr. is expected to examine the state's appeal today.

Body Image Week continues with anorexia discussion 
1.o.

By BIRGIT HEINISCH 
News Wri1er 
Offering support to those suffering and those helping their friends through the dis­order, counselors and students joined together Wednesday evening to speak out on anorexia. The discussion is a continuation of Body Awareness Week. 
"Bottom line is that there are different ways to cope with problems. Anorexia is one maladaptive way," said Susan Albers, a counselor at the University Counseling Center. 
Anorexia is "like an ice­berg.'' said Albers, "You can see the physical binging and purging but there are many underlying symptoms that you cannot see." Physical and behavioral symptoms such as frenetic exercising and mood swings are visible, but there are many psychological symp­toms beneath. 
"Control is a big thing with eating disorders. There was a correlation between stress and eating for me." said Darcy McLaughlin. a former anorex­ic. 
Anorexia is a serious eating disorder. Every year, "10 per­cent to 20 percent of people who have anorexia will die," said Albers. 
For this reason. Albers 
stresses the importance for 
friends to step into the situa­
tion. As a friend, it is neces­
sary to be sympathetic. One 
must know "how much shame, how much pain goes along with the disorder," said Albers. 
It is important to approach your friend as soon as possi­ble. "Stop being silent," said Jessica Johnstone. a student 
There are several steps to take and certain techniques to apply. First, "structure an intervention," said Albers. 
Decide who should talk with the friend and plan for an appropriate time to meet. Also prepare by practicing how to confront your friend. This allows you to "identify rough spots and to notice how you're coming across,'' said Albers. 
When trying to address this issue with a friend, the most important thing is to not com­ment on physical appearance. Comments about being healthy or about being too thin are usually interpreted as some­thing different, Sufferers of anorexia "manipulate any­thing about appearance [as a reason] to continue the disor­der," said McLaughlin. 
"One may inadvertently rein­force the disruptive behavior [through commenting on phys­ical appearance]." said Albers. 
Instead, focus the discussion on progress in mood. A person suffering from anorexia can relate the better emotional feeling with true health and feeling good rather than with physical health and appear­ance. 
Putting the focus on positive 
traits improves self-esteem, 
which will lead to more sue­
cess with the disorder, pan­elists said. Other strategies include using "I statements." 
When discussing anorexia with a friend. it is important to list behaviors which are caus­ing concerns to those friends. 
Having resources and addi­tional help, such a counselor, a rector or parents are key elements as well. 
Commenting on an anorex­ic's_ food con~umption can lead to them becoming less open. The opposite effect is being achieved; their behavior is more secretive, panelists said. 
One should "let them eat as much as they cat," said McLaughlin. "Avoid the hover and smother method," said Albers. 
As a friend, it is good to pre­pare for many responses and to be patient. A person suffer­ing from the anorexia could admit having the disorder or become defensive and ashamed. 
It is important not to argue and instead be comforting. 
One approach is to say, 'TH approach you again because I'm concerned," said Albers. 
There is always the chance that one's suspicions are wrong, yet voicing concerns are still significant. 
"Yes, I was angry at first [at being confronted by my teacher and friends]. but now I 
appreciate  that  they  
approached  me,"  said  
McLaughlin.

29.7 percent. 
Forty-one percent of the freshmen class voted Wednesday, 8 percent less than on Monday. 
"I was surprised at the lower numbers because the class was super excit­ed about the elections," said Nicole Prezioso, elec­tions commissioner. "At the same time, I think a lower turnout could be typical in run-off elec­tions."

"After covering student government for two years, I'm very excited now to go from a student government outsider to an insider and to serve the Class of 2002," said Laura Rompf. class vice president-elect and an Observer reporter. 
Rompf's running mates include president Rossmann, secretary Lisa Scstile and treasurer Chris McConnell. 
Rompf said her ticket plans to sponsor a confer­ence to help seniors prepare for life after graduating from Notre Dame and to next fall organize a "Senior 
0. Weekend," with activities similar to those at Freshman Orientation. 
She said in light of the 
recent deaths of three mem­
bers of the Class of 2002 to 
leukemia, the ticket is also 
planning fund-raising efforts 
for cancer charities and a 
bone marrow drive in mem­
ory of the students. 
Smith, president of the 
winning 2003 ticket, said his 
administration's top priority 
will be keeping abroad stu­
dents informed of activities 
at home. He said establish­
ing an abroad chairperson 
and a monthly newsletter 
would aid in that goal. 
"In the past, students may 

have been uninformed and 
left out of a lot of things sim­
ply because they were 
studying abroad." Smith 
said. "We want to let them 
know what's going on and 
keep them involved." 
Smith's running mates 

include vice president Karen 
Lysaght, secretary Josh 
Gentine and treasurer Nick 
Mastronardi. 
In the 2003 election, four tickets carried about 80 per­cent of the vote in the seven­way primary. The Ben Gilfillan and Brian Thomas tickets placed behind Oxley and Adams, collecting 142 and 121 voLes. respectively. Chris Iloldernir received 99 votes. Josh O'Farrcll won 83 and Dan Sushinsky earned 
Meghan Meyer and Michelle Houser took 53 percent of the vote in the run-off class of 2002 elec­tion against Erin Weldon and Mary Crawford who received 41 percent of Wednesday's vote. 
Six percent of the voters abstained. Brigid Buhrfiend and Lori Sichtermann are the newly elected senior class secretary and treasurer. 
"We plan to gel the ball rolling this year," said Meyer. "We are hoping to get events that seniors will want to be a part of; we definitely want the senior class, input." 
"We hope to have the senior board elected two weeks after spring break," said Houser. "We want to increase fun activities for the class, we have a lot of spirit." 
48 to round out the field. 
Oxley and Adams will compete in a run-off election Friday that also matches two tickets for off-campus co-presidents. Wednesday's primary resulted in a tight contest between the Liz Efta/Kelly Stocker and George Remus/Amy Sellers tickets. 
Efta and Stocker's 165 nods gave them a narrow 11-vote lead over Remus and Sellers. The slim margin prompted a recount by judi­cial council officials, who are required to recount in an election that yields less than a 25-vote margin between top vote-getting candidates. The third ticket of Sarah Schwartz and Kim Fenzl got 90 votes. 
Also on Wednesday the off-campus senator election saw Steve Reddy defeat Noel Conneely 185-130. 
Tony Wagner, judicial council president, said elec­tion turnout was decidedly mixed. 
"Turnout varied from 
dorm to dorm. We expected 
it to be up in some areas 
and down in some," Wagner 
said. 

That's despite a referen­
dum that student govern­
ment representatives were 
optimistic would spur high 
turnout. 

The Student Senate-spon­
sored referendum was a 
parietals survey that 
appeared on election ballots 
Wednesday. The ballot issue 
asked students if they were 
in favor of extending pari­
etals past midnight on week­
days and ending them 
before 10 a.m. every day. 
'Tm sure there were peo­
ple who turned out for [the 
rcferenduml. but there were 
many people who wanted to 
vote for the different 
ol1ices," Wagner said. 
The judicial council divid­
ed referendum responses by 
gender Wednesday night but 
did not tally results, Wagner 
said. 

lfe said the council would 
turn the ballots over to the 
Student Senate. 

The surveys will likely go 
to the senate's Hesidence

ed the ballot issue.

BRITAIN 
Law seeks to ban terrorism groups 
Associated Press 
LONDON 

Acting under a tough new anti-ter­rorism law, Britain on Wednesday announced plans to ban 21 radical groups, including the organization of Saudi exile Osama bin Laden. 
Many of the groups have no orga­nized presence in Britain. 
The new anti-terror measure, which took effect Feb. 19, empowers Britain to ban groups that commit violence abroad and to crack down on support­ers who channel funds and recruits to terrorist organizations. Authorities had been expected to quickly make use of the new provisions. 
The bans still need the approval of lawmakers. 
The government's proposed list includes Greece's November 17, which has killed 22 people since 1975, target­ing intelligence officials and diplomats; bin Laden's organization. al-Qaeda, which has been linked to a range of terror attacks including the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in east Africa; and Abu Nida!, a group blamed for killing more than 300 people since 1973. 
It also lists several groups seeking independent homelands, including ETA, which has killed 800 people in its 32-year quest for a Basque homeland independent from Spain; the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam of Sri Lanka; and the Kurdistan Workers' Party in Turkey. 
Also on the list are the Mujahedeen Khalq, which seeks to overthrow Iran's Islamic government.

Notre Dame set to host two student bioethics conferences 
By HIIARY BURNS 
News Writer 
Notre Dame has the opportunity to place itself on the bioethical map this weekend by hosting two international events the third National Undergraduate Bioethics Conference and the inaugural meeting of the International Student Bioethics Initiative. 
"I hope this weekend is a unique opportunity for students from within ND and visitors to interact and discuss con­temporary bioethical issues that will be affecting our futures." said Heather Kuhlenschmidt. Kuhlenschmidt, a Notre Dame junior, is executive co-chair of the conference along with fellow classmate Mike Mann. 
There are approximately 200 people registered to participate in the confer­ence. Their home countries range from Ghana and Australia, to the United Kingdom and Canada, according to Mann. 
"We open up our campus to [all partic­ipantsj as a place for open and respectful dialogue where ideas from different cul­tures, disciplines, nationalities and reli­gions are encouraged," said Mann. 
The objectives of the conference are to 
consider the purpose of bioethics and its role in the world; to give more cohesion to a topic which is often fragmented into individual issues; to emphasize the importance of increased interdisciplinary dialogue and to raise a sense of social responsibility within students towards these issues. 
"I [also] hope this weekend will create awareness about discrimination issues and the need for equal representation, which are bioethics issues that do not normally fall under the traditional defin­ition of bioethics," said Mann 
The coordinators of this year's confer­ence were among the 300 or so. students from around the world who attended the second annual conference last year at the University of Virginia. 
Last year's experience was twofold in purpose for Kuhlenschmidt. 
"[It gave] me the opportunity to discuss the contemporary issues with students who have a broad range of educational and religious affiliations, [but it] was also a bonding experience for many of the people involved in the planning of this year's conference," said Kuhlenschmidt. 
The Second National Undergraduate Bioethics Conference was also where Mike Mann and Anne Cooper of Notre Dame, Jayme Dowdall from Boston University and Adrian Viens from the University of Toronto met and became motivated to found ISBI. 
"At the conference, it was exciting to see the enthusiasm of the students in attendance," said Cooper. "It seemed a shame to go back to our campuses and lose the enthusiasm until the next con­ference. 
"So, we began to think of a way to maintain the momentum and came up with plans to form this organization," she added. 
ISBI's intent is to be an international student organization that is unaffiliated with individual colleges and universities. It will serve to connect students across the globe in order to encourage educa­tion, communication, activism and lead­ership in the field of bioethics. 
Further information about ISBI will be revealed at its inaugural meeting follow­ing the conference's closing banquet, said Mann. 
The ISBl meeting is independent of the conference, hut it is being held at Notre Dame this weekend because it was an opportunity where students interested in bioethics would already be together, said Kuhlenschmidt. 
Many students, including the founders of ISBI, will be participating in both events. 
"I expect to participate in a great dia­logue of future leaders. Undergraduates have a lot to c.ontribute to bioethical dis­course," said Viens. "As the future physi­cians, lawyers, bioethicists and public policy makers of the first half of the 21st century, initiatives such as the Annual Undergraduate Bioethics Conference and ISBI are great opportunities for these individuals to sharpen their interest and expand their knowledge." 
This year's conference is divided into four half-day sessions -the nature of bioethics, the human genome project, care for the dying and international bioethics. 
Each of these sessions will include keynote presentations followed by break­out discussion groups where participants will choose from a variety of topics. 
The Notre Dame faculty members giv­ing keynote addresses are Father Theodore Hesburgh, University President Father Edward Malloy and John Robinson, associate professor of Law. 
Other keynote speakers include profes­sors from across the United States, Dr. Solomon Benatar from the University of Cape Town, South Africa, and Dr. C. Thomas Caskey from Merck Laboratories. 
Sources from within the University are providing the funding for the conference, according to Kuhlenschmidt. 
Space station faces budget overruns; plans less elaborate 
tion management from Johnson Space Center in Houston to NASA headquarters in Washington, and for a sustained rate of six space shuttle flights a year. NASA had been planning an annual flight rate of seven or eight, primarily to support the space station. 
"It's a call for us to be fiscally responsible," Hawes said. "But this is a far cry from any kind of a space station redesign." 
The international space sta­tion, called Alpha, is already the result of years and even decades of redesign. The first piece finally was launched in 1998 and the latest component, the U.S. Destiny laboratory, just last month. 
Astronaut James Wetherbee, commander of space shuttle Discovery's upcoming flight to the space station, said the bud­get problems are not putting a damper on the mission. But he noted how much NASA has learned -and still needs to learn -from the Russians. 
"The first time I went up and flew next to Mir, I was struck by a couple things. No. 1, how brilliant and white and perfect it looked," he said. "But more than that I thought to myself, well, here's a country that was in race with us, they didn't get to the moon ... they have much more budget problems than we have and yet they took the next step." 
Discovery is scheduled to lift off March 8 with a replacement crew for the three men who have been living on the space station since November.

planned and with fewer people 
on board, said space station 
chief Michael Hawes. To address "this unprecedent­ed cost growth," President Bush is calling in his new budget plan 
for completing the U.S. core of the station in 2003, three years earlier than planned. 
Among the likely casualties: a propulsion module, habita­tion module and crew rescue vehicle. Both the habitation module and a crew rescue vehicle are needed in order for the space station crew to increase in size from three to seven. 
NASA is looking at various options for eventually hous­ing seven astronauts and cos­monauts, and for providing a safe escape for all seven, Hawes said Wednesday. The options, he said, must be "within the bounds of the budget dollars that we have to work with." 

The European and Japanese laboratory modules would remain on schedule for launch in 2004, Hawes said. Any fur­ther U.S. additions after that will be considered enhance­ments, and it's difficult to know when they might be made, he said. 
Hawes said the cost overruns occurred over time and, in part, were the result of equipment problems, the need to fly so many spare parts and the recent surge in trips to the space station. 
"Part of it is just the reality of moving into a flying program that's holding its schedule and is not being able to decrease staffing at the rate that was assumed in some of the budget numbers," Hawes said. 
Altogether, Bush is seeking

Another toddler found in snow 
FBI: Suspect Odeh

EAU CLAIRE, Wis. 

A 2-ycar-old boy found lying in a snowbank and not breathing remained in critical condi­tion Wednesday, while a 13-month-old Canadian girl who nearly froze to death in a similar incident over the weekend is expected to make a virtually full recovery, doctors said. 
~~s _Hynek was ho~pita!ized at the Mayo Chmc m Rochester. Mmn. He had slipped out­side in sub-zero temperatures for up to four hours Tuesday clad only in a diaper, pajamas and a sweat shirt. 
"He's better. He's awake. I wasn't too late when I found him," the boy's father Mark Hynek said. "I just keep on praying for him and hoping for the best." 
The boy wandered from his home on his par­ents' dairy farm sometime after 3 a.m. Tuesday. His father found him unconscious almost four hours later about 50 feet from the house, Eau Claire County Sheriffs Sgt. John Vogler said. 
The National Weather Service said the tem­perature that night in Eau Claire fell to 4 below zero. Vogler said he had heard that the boy's body temperature was about 65 degrees soon after he was found, but there was no immediate confirmation. 
The child had wanted to watch a video and his father told investigators he must have fall­en asleep in a chair after he started the video­tape. He awoke at 6:40 a.m., realized his son was missing and found him outside Vogler

In Canada, 13-month-old Erika Nordby, whose body was partially frozen and whose heart had stopped during a night outside in the col~ at Edmonton, Alberta, was playful and talkmg and had been moved out of intensive care, hospital officials said.

"It looks like her heel pad will survive and a good part of her foot and maybe all of it," he said. "She should be able to walk with maybe some, maybe no. or maybe minimal disability, but at least she will be able to walk on her feet."

A man bypassed a security checkpoint and barged through an emergency door at Los Angeles International Airport on Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of three United Airlines terminals for nearly two hours. 
United spokesman Alan Wayne estimated about 1,800 travelers were affected, with 20 or more flights delayed. The airline said 10 other flights were canceled either because of the security breach or the earthquake in the Northwest. 
The passenger. identified as Albert Joseph Bryla, 22, of St. Augustine, Fla., was arrested for misdemeanor trespassing when he reached his depar­ture gate. He posted $500 bail late Wednesday. 
Bryla couldn't immediately be located for comment Wednesday, but his father said from Florida that his son told him the incident was a misunderstanding. 
"He took a wrong turn in the airport," Bryla's father, Albert Bryla Sr.. said from his St. Augustine, Fla., home. "It's a misunderstanding that got way out of hand. I think some­one out there really overreact­ed."

"We're expecting a retaliation by the U.S. Army. We're expect­ing their warplanes to start hit­ting us and missile attacks," the agent said Odeh recalled the man saying without elabora­tion. 
Odeh said the men had ordered him to flee the country in the first week of August and had given him a razor to shave his beard so that he would not seem Muslim when he traveled.

In his cross-examination of Anticev, Odeh's attorney Anthony Ricco questioned the agent about whether Odeh had admitted to being directly involved. 
"He never said to you that he was responsible because this was something that he did, isn't that correct?" he asked. 
"Correct," Anticev said. 
"He felt morally responsible because he was associated with and a member of al-Qaeda, isn't that correct?" Ricco added.

If your plane arrived late last December, you had plen­ty of company. More flights than ever before were delayed or canceled that month, the government says.

Although flights in the win­ter are prone to delays because of poor weather, never before had.so many flights failed to arrive on time in any month in the 13 years for which figures are available, the report said.

Florida drops wiretap charge versus teen 
Associated Press 
PENSACO!A, Fla. 

Wiretapping charges were dropped Wednesday against a high school student who taped a chemistry lecture without the teacher's consent. 
Prosecutor John Molchan said the wiretapping law applies only when the person being tape-recorded has a reasonable expectation of pri­vacy -and that was not the case in a classroom of 30 stu­dents. 
"The young lady was record­ing a lecture, trying to assist her in learning at that particu­lar time. I'm not sure that's an appropriate forum for prose­cution," the prosecutor said. 
Asher Zaslaw, 17, a varsity weightlifter, said she recorded the October lecture at Navarre High School because she was having difficulty in the class and wanted to maintain her 
3.89 grade-point average. Teacher Shelaine Goss filed a 
complaint. and the state brought charges Feb. 5. 
Calls to the teacher's home were not immediately returned on Wednesday. 
Principal Louise Driggers said taping in the classroom is against school policy. She said the rule is intended to prevent students from listening to tapes or CDs in class. 
Zaslaw would have faced penalties including community service if convicted. 
"The toll it's taken on her up to this point is a shame," said Asher's father, Jay Zaslaw. "That's not the kind of thing that kids on the right track should be subjected to." 
Barbara Peterson, executive director of' the rirst Amendment Foundation in Tallahassee, said the wiretap law was never intended for classroom lectures. 
"There's no expectation of privacy in a classroom," Peterson said. "It kind of stuns me."

Investigators review library donor list 
. Clinton's pardons called 'accident waiting to happen'by former pardon attorney 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

Congressional investigators hunting for evi­dence of a pardons-for-dollars scheme at the Clinton White House got their first look on Wednesday at a list of 150 top donors to his presidential library project. 
They looked at the list for about 45 minutes, but lawyers for the House Government Reform Committee would not disclose information about the contributors, or say how many of the names would prompt further investigation. All 150 people and organizations on the list contributed more than $5,000. 
The William J. Clinton Foundation, which is raising money for the library to be built in Little Rock, Ark., initially resisted giving the donor list to the committee. The commission chairman, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., then threatened to find foundation director Skip Rutherford in contempt of Congress. 
But after several days of ne.gotiations, the foundation and committee agreed on a way for top members of the committee to review the donor list, while protecting the privacy of donors not relevant to the probe. 
"We have worked out an agreement, and Mr. Rutherford will not be required to testify" on Thursday, Burton said. "We think we'll have all the information we want by Friday, specific contributors. the amount and the dates. We've excused some of them because we don't think the information is necessary at this time." 
Among other things, the committee wants to know whether Clinton's decision to pardon fugitive Marc Rich was influenced by contribu­tions to the library. Rich, a billionaire. has lived in Switzerland since just before he was indicted in 1983 on charges of tax evasion, fraud and making illegal oil deals with Iran. 
His ex-wife, songwriter Denise Rich, con­tributed $450,000 to the foundation, $1.1 mil­lion to the Democratic Party and at least $109,000 to Hillary Rodham Clinton's bid for the Senate. Denise Rich and her friend, Beth Dozoretz, a former finance chairman for the Democratic National Committee who pledged to raise $1 million for the library project, have both refused to testify before the committee. 
The committee was forcing Dozoretz to attend Thursday's hearing to publicly refuse to testify. 
While Rutherford is no longer required to testify, the committee expected to hear from other witnesses, including John Podesta, Clinton's former chief of staff; Beth Nolan, for­mer White House counsel: Bruce Lindsey, for­mer aide and longtime Clinton confidant; and Lewis Libby, a lawyer who is chief of staff for Vice President Dick Cheney and once repre­sented Rich. 
On Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the pardon pow­ers of the president and whether the clemency process needs to be improved. 
Margaret Colgate Love, who served as par­don attorney at the Justice Department from 1990 to 1997, told the committee that from the beginning of his presidency, Clinton moved to take away the agency's traditional role of being the first to review pardon requests. 
"The final Clinton pardons were an accident waiting to happen," she said. 
Traditionally, presidents let the Justice Department take the first look at clemency requests. but Clinton's White House answered pardon inquiries, and made it known that Justice officials would be among many people who would advise Clinton on the requests, she said. 
"The Clinton administration's shortsighted and ill-advised decision to abandon the long­standing regular system of Justice Department review led directly to the reported free-for-all at the end of his term and the resultant appearance of cronyism and influence-ped­
dling," Love asserted.

House Republicans expand Bush tax cuts 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

House Republicans said Tuesday they will expand President Bush's proposed across-the-board tax cuts and speed the bill to passage by tho end of next week. 
A day after Bush outlined his plans before Congress, Rep. Bill Thomas, the chief House tax writer, offered legislation that would accelerate a cut in the lowest tax rate ahead of the president's timetable and make it retroactive to Jan. 1. 
Thomas, R-Calif., said the Ways and Means Committee that he leads would meet Thursday to approve the bill, setting the stage for an early triumph for Bush -and a quick clash with Democrats who oppose GOP proposals as too costly. Thomas said the measure would cost $960 bil­lion over the next decade, and other elements of Bush's $1.6 trillion tax cut would come later. 
In unusually sharp com­ments, Speaker Dennis Hastert accused Democrats of trying to thwart swift action to boost the economy, in hopes of a reces­sion that would damage Republicans politically. Hastert, R-lll., said the bill would be on the House floor next week. 
"Obviously there are some on the other side of the aisle that don't want us to have success; they would like to see us go into recession," he said. 
Responding soon after, Democratic leader Dick Gephardt said, "I hope he dido't mean that, because how could anyone want to visit on the American people, especial­ly poor people, what a reces­sion and what a slowdown really means?" 
Gephardt, D-Mo., said that with his tax cuts, Bush was "gambling our healthy econo­my, the future of Medicare and Social Security and our chil­dren's education on budget predictions that are no more reliable than a weather fore­cast." 
While Hastert and Thomas cited the weakening economy for their decision to move quickly, Republicans acknowl­edged that no legislation is likely to reach Bush's desk for weeks if not months. Democrats can delay action in the Senate until Congress has approved an overall budget ­unlikely until April at the earli­est 
The maneuvering unfolded as the White House released fresh details of Bush's overall budget, including his recom­mended $1.6 trillion in tax cuts over the next decade. 
The costliest portion is the rate cuts, which would cost more than $810 billion. Phasing out the estate tax would cost $266 billion; an increase in the child tax credit $192 billion and a reduction in the so-called marriage penalty another $112 billion.

GUEST COLUMN 

Agent must pay for greediness 
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. 
The term "double agent" is crucial to almost every spy movie. Such a free­roaming character can implement the story's twists and turns and keep the audience on the edge of their seats. They also guarantee slower people, such Chris Schafer as myself, will be completely lost once the picture is more Minnesota than 15 minutes Dailyold. 
While James Bond and Austin Powers are entertaining and even funny to watch, there is nothing amusing about the idea of a real-life dou­ble agent effectively working to jeopar­dize world security. Double agents are individuals who work for government intelligence in their native country while selling secrets to foreign countries. Persons of the aforementioned descrip­tion are like David Arquette films: You do your best to prevent them from appear­ing, but somehow they still turn up. 
Such is the case with FBI agent Robert Hanssen, arrested last week on counts of espionage and treason. Mr. Hanssen is accused of selling government secrets to the Russians for the past 15 years. Well, on second thought, when authorities are able to obtain past phone messages and confiscate a garbage bag full of U.S. secrets bound for the East, the term accused is really just a formality, isn't it? 
Over the past 15 years, Hanssen doled out numerous tidbits of information involving American secrets and policies to the Russians. Included in this overseas swap meet were dozens of classified doc­uments and electronic surveillance and monitoring techniques that included "an entire technical program of enormous value, expense and importance." Naturally the feds won't go into great detail as to the specifics of the damage. It's safe to say more eyes have seen the documents in question than were sup­posed to anyway. But it is known Robert Hanssen was integral in supplying Russians certain information pertaining 
to those who play on both sides ofthe 
secret agent fence. 
Hanssen's busy lips are believed to be the key factor in the crumpled 1989 espi­onage investigation of State Department employee Felix Bloch. Law enforcement officials say Hanssen informed the Russians of his own government's devel­oping knowledge of the dealings of Bloch. The Russians were able to warn Bloch and Justice Department prosecutors were never able to find sufficient evi­dence he had passed secret documents to the KGB. 
Hanssen also informed the Russians of three of his Soviet counterparts -Boris Yuzhin, Sergey Motorin and Valeriy Martynov -three KGB agents selling preciously attained Russian information to the Americans. On Hanssen's tip, the Russians swooped in, caught and convict­ed the three. Yuzhin spent time in prison and fled to America after his release. Motorin and Martynov were convicted of espionage and executed. It was Hanssen who gave these men away and as such, is just as responsible for their deaths as the Russians are. 
This incident provides a reality check to all people about one of'thc world's necessary evils. This isn't the glamour of James Bond or "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." These people are thieves, traitors, stool pigeons and opportunists, living on the outer fringe while thousands of heroes and patriots can and do die at the leaking of their lips. But as distasteful as this entire process is, spies have been invaluable in the past, including both world wars. They are revered and reviled, depending only on which side of the fence they serve. Even in a unified world, spies would probably still exist. Right or wrong, it is human nature to harbor a certain level of distrust toward our fellow man. 
So how much does it cost to buy a man's integrity or his neighbor's securi­ty? According to sources, Hanssen received $1.4 million over 15 years for being such a great little snitch. The vast majority of this ill-gotten bounty, some $800,000, was stored for him in an over­seas account; but he also took payments, $650,000 dollars, in the form of cash and diamonds. The money was split because Hanssen feared large cash intakes would make him look like a drug dealer. 
This money is little more than icing on the cake for an individual who garnered more than $100,000 a year in base salary and lived in a $300,000 house in Vienna. Thus, we arc left to question thc motivation of an individual to sell out his country for a little more money on the pile and enough inventory to open his own Pawn America. 
Hanssen appears to have a particular disdain for America. In written messages to his cohorts across the ocean. Hanssen referred to the United States as, "a pow­erfully built but retarded child, potential­ly dangerous, but young, immature and easily manipulated." ViewpoinL,; such as the aforementioned are disturbing no matter who utters them. but especially when they come from an individual in a position such as Hanssen 's, who has the capacity to do great damage to the coun­try itself. 
In politically correct terminology. Hanssen's loose lips have jeopardized American security, which translates into your and my security. Captured traitors such as llanssen deserve to be dealt with in the harshest manner possible. In a let­ter to his Russian cohorts. Hanssen said, "One might propose that I am either insanely brave or quite insane. I'd answer neither. I'd say, insanely loyal." Hanssen is loyal only to himself and the almighty dollar. It is my hope the American government sees him as insanely expendable.

The reason behind being unable to represent a pig on 

to embrace the campus-wide joke of Breen-Phillips as a fat dorm. Although this joke may not be politically correct, every­one knows it is a joke and noth­ing more. To deny us the repre­sentation of our mascot on our dorm shirts with such a reason as this, seems to me to be mak­ing too much of the situation. It seems to me the equivalent would be something like Carroll Hall being forbidden to depict mice or other vermin on any­thing for their dorm because mice are viewed in a negative light. Or that Lewis can't put chickens on their shirts because it could possibly be construed to mean the women of Lewis are cowardly. 
Though there are residents in Breen-Phillips who do not like the Babe mascot, I have noticed it's more for reasons such as not liking pigs, thinking Babe the Pig an unfit mascot, or simply having an affinity for the old Banshees (ahem, Breen-Phillips football). If there are residents of Breen-Phillips who are uncomfortable with the inter­pretation that pigs convey a neg­ative body image, why do we have this mascot? 
Of course dorm T-shirts are trivial, but many 1nore impor­tant things at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's arc also subject to the atmosphere of extreme political correctness. As Joe Muto pointed out in his Feb. 27 letter, the Vagina Monologues were silenced, but let us not for­get the controversy over the Keenan Revue, which might argµably be the biggest dorm­sponsored event at Notre Dame.

Memorial gives support, not condemnation 
I would like to offer an alternate perspective in the discussion of the memorial to victims of abortion. Regardless of where one stands on the issue of legal­ized abortion, memorials such as this one ought to be seen not as a judgement upon women, but a sup­port to women experiencing the artcrmath of what Jocelyn Szczepaniak-Gillece calls a "violating and shattering experience." 
I became acutely aware of the truth of her description while working in crisis pregnancy and post-abortion counseling for a secular non-profit organization. A young woman who was having diffi­culty coping with her abortion contacted me. Her family and her church were pro-choice; they had supported her decision, yet she suffered tremendous­ly. 
After talking at some length with her, we decided to go together to visit a memorial similar to the one on this campus. She wept. She prayed. She grieved the loss of her child. She was grateful for the gift of the memorial placed by people whom she would never meet. They gave her what no one in her pro­choice circle had been able to give: a recognition of her pain. 
If it is true that there are, "many, many women 
on campus who have had abortions," then it is equal­
ly as likely that there are many. many women on 
campus who suffer. Szczepaniak-Gillece pleads, "If 
you have any humanity whatsoever, stop victimizing 
them." 
I agree; we know that many women experience 
abortion as a violating and shattering experience; let 
us not force them to suffer alone by our silence. Let 
us welcome them to grieve openly for the loss of 
their children.

MEN'S BASKETBALL 
North Carolina earns ACC regular-season title with win 
Associated Press 
CHAPEL HILL. N.C. 

No. 4 North Carolina was worrying about making the NCAA Tournament at this time a year ago, not-ruling it. 
What a difference a year makes. 

Joseph Forte scored 27 points and Matt Doherty became the first coach to win or share an ACC regular-season title in his first season as the Tar Heels beat 
N.C. State 76-63 Wednesday night. 
"I would rather be on top than at the bottom," senior center Brendan llaywol>d said. "Last year at this time we were struggling. Now. we're just trying to see if we're going to be a No. 1 or a No. 2 seed. That's definitely a better feeling." 
The Tar Heels (23-4. 13-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) captured the No. 1 seed in next week's ACC tournament in Atlanta with the win, shooting 57 per­cent to rebound from a 20-point loss to Virginia (No. 9 ESPN/USA Today, No. 7 AP) over the weekend. 
No coach in the storied league -noL Dean Smith, Mike Krzyzewski, Jim Valvano, Lefty Driesell, Norm Sloan nor Everett Case -ever had as successful first season as the 39-ycar-old Doherty. 
"He's not going tl> say anything about it because he wants us to get the credit," llaywood said. "A lot of stuff this year has been about him. I know he doesn't like that because he knows without play­ers he can't do anything. Hut I feel he should get a lot of credit." 
Duke could tie North Carolina in the league standings with a victory at the Smith Center on Sunday, but North Carolina would win the tie-breaker because of its season sweep of Maryland. 
"You don't want to share anything and you especially don't want to share it with Duke," Haywood said of the ACC regular-season title. "If we win that game we'll have a lot of momentum heading into the ACC tournament." 
Forte had 19 points in the second half, while Ronald Curry added a career-high 14 as the Tar !-!eels have now won or shared 23 ACC regular-season crowns in the league's 48 years. 
"I was patient and Jet the game come to me in the first half, then I attacked in the second half," Forte said. 
The Wolfpack (13-14, 5-10) played the Tar Heels even for most of the first half 
and trailed by seven at the break, but 
poor shooting once again did in N.C. 
State, which hasn't won consecutive 
games since late December. 
North Carolina led 46-38 with 15:08 
left. N.C. State then hit just one of its 
next 13 shots as the Tar Heels took con­
trol with a 12-4 run to go up by 14 
points. 
"There were some shots that were questionable, some that were pretty good and probably a third category of shots that looked pretty good, but it's hard to estimate the impact of Brendan Haywood around the basket," said Wolfpack coach Herb Sendek. who fell to 1-1 l against the Tar Heels. 
Forte had a three-point play and hit a baseline noater during the end of the spurt. 
N.C. State never got it under double digits the rest of the way in losing for the seventh straight time to North Carolina -the longest streak by the Tar Heels against the Wolfpack since 1981­83. 
Ron Kelley, plagued with knee prob­lems for much of the last two seasons. had his best game of the year for N.C. State. scoring 10 points and grabbing 12 rebounds. 
The loss means the Wolfpack will be the seventh seed in the ACC tournament and play second-seeded Duke. 
The teams combined for 26 turnovers in the opening 20 minutes of their 197th meeting. It was similar to the first one a month ago in Raleigh in which each club posted season-low point totals in a 60­52 North Carolina victory. 
The Tar Heels took more than 12 min­utes to recover offensively from a miser­able 24-point second half against the Cavaliers on Sunday, turning it over 10 times in 10 1/2 minutes and scoring just 12 points to fall behind by five. 
"I think our heads were right," Doherty said. "I know people were try­ing to make some things out of different comments (after the Virginia Joss). but our team was together. If you didn't see that tonight then you weren't watching." 
But the Wolfpack had turnover prob­lems of its own over the last 6:08 of the half. coughing it up seven times as the Tar Heels used a 16-3 run to grab the halftime lead. 
Curry's 11 first-half points matched his season high as he hit all three shots from the field and his five free throws. 
Duke loses more than just game to Maryland 
. Boozer will miss UNC game, ACC Tournament 
Associated rress 
DURHAM, N.C. 

Mike Krzyzewski tried to look convincing Tuesday night when he said No. 2 Duke had to regroup fol­lowing its worst loss of the season. 
But the coach of the Blue Devils knew he had lost more than a game to 16th-ranked Maryland. Center Carlos Boozer, a former Juneau resident, went down in the second half with a fractured third metatarsal in his right foot. 
"We've just got to circle the wag­ons and get tougher,"Krzyzewski said. "We're optimistic that Carlos can return for the NCAA Tournament." 
The 6-foot-9-inch Boozer, Duke's main inside threat, hurt his foot early in the second half, tried to return, then left for good with more than 10 minutes left in the 91-80 loss. 
The Blue Devils (25-4, 12-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) shot 24 percent in the second half without Boozer. who averages 13.9 points and 6.5 rebounds. 
Boozer will miss Sunday's rematch with No. 4 North Carolina. the ACC tournament in Atlanta next week -and maybe beyond. 
The Juneau, Alaska, native is averaging 14.0 points and 6.5 rebounds this season. Boozer, who broke his left foot in the summer of 1999, currently leads Duke and the ACC with a .602 field goal percent­age and is tied for the team lead in rebounding. He is also shooting .729 from the free throw line this season. 
As for the game. Maryland wasn't about to let this win slip away. The Terps blew a IO-point lead in the final minute a month ago at home, but got revenge in Cameron Indoor Stadium. 
Juan Dixon was the offensive and defensive hero for the Terrapins (19-9, 9-6 Atlantic Coast Conference). scoring 28 points and getting five steals. 
Lonny Baxter added 15 points and 10 rebounds, while Terence Morris had 13 points and 12. rebounds as the Terrapins domi­nated the boards in winning at Duke for the second straight sea­son. 
Shane Battier led Duke with 31 
points in his last game in Cameron. 
getting 19 in the first half. 
Duke led 60-51 with 15:20 left. but missed 25 of its first 31 shots of the final half. going more than eight minutes without a basket as Maryland took over.

The Terrapins, who shot 53 per­cent in the second half, sealed it from the foul line. making 10 of' 11 over the final 1:34. 
Duke's second half was its worst of' the season. going 9-l'or-37 from the field, including 3-f'or-19 from 3­point range. 
Maryland lost four of' l'ivc after the Duke loss on Jan. 27, but have rebounded to win four in a row, including over ranked teams Wake Forest, Oklahoma and the Blue Devils, who had beaten the Terrapins eight of nine coming in. 
Maryland controlled a majority of the first half as Duke started 6-for­17 from the field. 
The Terrapins were up by nine, but Duke's press began to bother Maryland as the Blue Devils closed with a 23-7 run l>Ver the final 4:50. 
Battier was the main offensive weapon in the spurt, scoring nine points in a span of 1 :02 as the Blue Devils made five 3-pointers in four minutes to go up by seven at the break. 
Battier's second 3-pointer in the run was from 25 feet as Duke was 7-for-14 from beyond the arc in the opening 20 minutes -four coming from Battier.

Going into his semifinal bout, Brian "Nightmare" Hobbins expected Justin "The ResLife Regular" Meyers to come at him charging, and he came pre­pared. Early on, it looked as if Meyers could back Hobbins into the ropes and fight toe to toe, but Hobbins used an array of effec­tive combinations to expose Meyors and earn the unanimous decision. 
"The best way to deal with a charger is to keep your move­ment going, moving backwards and then to the side, and keeping your punches straight as you can," Hobbins said. "It worked pretty well for me." 
One straight punch sent Meyers to the canvas at the start of the second round. Meyers charged and Hobbins landed a shot that more surprised a frus­trated Meyers than anything. By midway through the third round, both fighters were exhausted from playing cat and mouse, and they stood at the center of the ring, slugging it out as the crowd roared" 
"At the end when we got caught up in that kind of wrestling match, it was because I couldn't move backwards as fast as he can move forwards," Hobbins said. "I felt tired, I just tried channeling power, and just think about all the people who ar"e behind me in my corner, my friends and family rooting for me, and it gives me the strength to keep throwing because I know they want to see a good show." 
Hobbins will face 31-year-old grad student Thomas "Boom­Boom" Macias who won a sloppy fight over Chris "Can't We All Just" Kitalong. Sloppy would actually be a gross understate­ment. The first round started out with fast somewhat controlled exchanges, and ended with Macias being knocked down by a Kitalong hook right at the bell. 
The remainder of the fight was something like a cross between a wrestling match and a pillow fight. Both fighters were throw­ing wild hooks and opening themselves to hard shots to the face. There was plenty of push­ing, lunging and even head butting. In the third round espe­cially, Macias simply landed more haymakers than Kitalong and despite being knocked down in round one, won a unanimous decision.

Joyce's focus now turns to the clash with his fellow captain. 
"We talked about it all tourna­ment," he said. "We're both so happy we each won, but when once it gets time for the ring we're both gonna be down to business. I know Mark's a great fighter and I'm just looking for­ward to fighting him."

Flutie, Leaf beco01e free agents 
Associated Press 

Quarterbacks Ryan Leaf and Doug Flutie became free agents and three-time Super Bowl champion Ken Norton Jr. was released Wednesday as NFL teams sliced their payrolls as a salary cap dead­line approached. 
More players will be released as teams get down to the $67 .4 million salary cap before free agency begins Friday. 
"We are preparing for free agency and the draft and this allows these players to catch on with another team," Chargers general manager John Butler said, after get­ting rid of Leaf and four oth­ers. 
In other salary-driven moves, the Pittsburgh Steelers released center Derrnontti Dawson and the Carolina Panthers released three players who were with George Seifert when he won a Super Bowl with the 49ers in 1995. 
Several more prominent players could be released on Thursday. Even teams under the salary cap were looking for ways to trim the payroll to get more flexibility. 
"There are only so many slices to the pie," Miami Dolphins coach Dave Wannstedt said. "We're going to lose a couple of key guys. 
There's no way around that." 
The Kansas City Chiefs. 
who ended last season almost 
$30 million over the cap, 
were trying to see whether 
they could restructure Elvis 
Grbac's contract. The quar­
terback's contract calls for a 
$10 million bonus if he's still 
on the roster Friday. 

Six-time Pro Bowl defensive 
lineman John Handle expect­
ed to be released by the 
Minnesota Vikings because 
he wouldn't agree to restruc­
ture his contract. 

The Chargers began 
reshaping the NFL's worst 
team of 2000 by waiving 
Leaf, who had been in con­
stant trouble during his three 
seasons. 

Leaf was the second pick in 
the 1998 draft, taken right 
after Peyton Manning, but 
played poorly and became a 
distraction with his boorish 
behavior. 

Leaf missed all of the 1999 
season with a shoulder injury 
and won the starting job last 
summer, but was benched 
after throwing five intercep­
tions and .one touchdown in 
the first two games. He also 
started the final six games. 
The Bills ended months of speculation by announcing that R·ob Johnson will be the quarterback next season, -making Flutie expendable. The Bills had to cut almost $8 million off their payroll and saved $3 million by cutting 
Flu tie. 
Flutie, who went 21-9 as a starter with the Bills, turns 38 in October, another factor working against him. 
Norton spent six years with Dallas before joining the 49ers as a free agent in 1994. Norton is the only player in NFL history to win three con­secutive Super bowls -two with the Cowboys, one with the 49ers. 
The Steelers also released a player who had ties to their past. Dawson. 36, is the last Steeler to play for both Chuck Noll and Bill Cowher and is the only player other than Mike Webster to play center for the team over the last 25 years. 
The seven-time Pro Bowler was due a $1 million bonus if he was still on the roster on March 9. The Steelers are trying to figure a way to keep running back Jerome Bettis. 
"In order for us to sign some of our other free agents, we are forced to make some very difficult decisions," vice president Art Rooney II said. 
Record-setting running back Corey Dillon will be the most accomplished free­agent available, but the Cincinnati Bengals used their transition tag on him, giving them the right to match any offer. Given the sorry state of the Bengals offense, they' re determined not to lose him.

Wake up! It's Lent. 
by Fr. Gary Chamberland,c.s.c. 
Seasons come and seasons go -spring following winter, summer following spring. As stu­dents, September means new school clothes and sharpened pencils. December brings Christ­mas vacation and March comes with Spring Break. The Church year has its own cycle: Advent, Christmas, Lent, Easter and ordinary time, each season following the other in a lulling rhythm. We can get caught up in the rhythm and lose sight of the purpose; we can walk through the Church year as many people walk through their lives -aimlessly and unaware. 
Yesterday, we celebrated the beginning of Lent. We signed ourselves with ashes as an acknowledgement of our humanity and our utter reliance on God's mercy. Yesterday, we began to prepare our hearts for the reality of Easter. Yesterday, we shook up our static lives in an 
attempt to become more aware of During Lent, the earth is awakening from the reality of the resurrection and more responsive to its life-giving

ashes on our foreheads because new life may spring forth. they were there, because that's 
what you do on the Wednesday after Fat Tuesday? Did we simply join the procession because the line was moving and it didn't even cross our minds to stop? Have we already begun to float through Lent as we float through much of life, riding the surface of whim and fancy, unaware of deeper currents and the direc­tion we are headed? Yesterday, did we heed the warning of the church and meditate on our human finiteness? Did we embrace the call to turn away from sin and be faithful to the Gos­pel? Or will Easter come along unnoticed with jellybeans and chocolate rabbits and turn our attention next to the Fourth ofJuly, fireworks and the pleasures of the outdoor grill? 
Lent, as its name implies, calls Christians to the work of springtime. All over the northern world, the earth is awakening from its winter slumber and the rites of spring are starting. Brown leaves are cleared and dead limbs pruned. Fields hardened by winter and lack of care are tilled, hard clumps of soil broken open and turned over; the earth is prepared for new planting. So, too, we Christians are called to clear away the dead wood of our lives and to scrape away our self-centeredness, our apathy and our sinful ways. We are called to turn over the hardness of our hearts and to break open the soil of our souls so that new life may spring forth. 
These images ofspring are the stuff of metaphors, but they are not just so many pretty pic­
tures. Living spring -living Lent -is work. The Christian life is a life of work, honest reflec­
tion on who we are and what we have become. This stark honesty leads us to repent of our 
sinful ways and to walk the way of peace. That walk is work. That Lenten walk means embrac­
ing prayer, fasting and almsgiving. We till the soil of our hardened hearts when we attempt to 
pray more earnestly and often, turning our thoughts to God and inviting him ever more fully 
into our lives. That prayer can be a commitment to more formal communal prayer: attending 
Sunday night vespers at the Basilica or making the Stations of the Cross every Friday. It may 
mean a pledge to pray more in private: a nightly visit to the grotto or fifteen minutes every 
morning before the Blessed Sacrament. 
We prepare the ground for planting with fasting. Heed the call to communal fasting and take 
seriously the obligation to abstain from meat on Fridays. These small mortifications prick our 
conscience, expose our weaknesses and help us turn to Christ. Along with these, find some 
personal form of fasting, be it refraining from watching professional wrestling on Monday 
night or giving up Swedish fish, and offer up these little hardships for the needs of others. 
Give alms to those in need: thousands suffer from the effects of earthquakes in Central 
America and Asia, children starve, women are abused. Give a little to others. No, give a lot. 
Give 'til it hurts. Give from your own need and experience the freedom of the resurrection. 
Prayer, fasting and almsgiving are the marks of the season of Lent. They open our hearts and refocus our vision. These works of spring prepare the ground so that when the Father sends the gentle rains of forgiveness, the seeds of faith will grow. We can do the work ofspring or we can simply go through the motions. We can tiil the soil or simply admire the plow. It is a choice. So is faith. Take advantage of the season. Choose wisely.

Miller scores 24 points in Pacers' victory 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS Reggie Miller got the Indiana Pacers back on track. 
Miller scored 24 points as the Pacers found their shooting touch in a 99-86 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night. 
The Pacers, who hit just 34 percent in Monday's loss at Charlotte, sank 40 of 71 field goals (56.3 percent) to build leads as large as 25 points in the third quarter. 
"You always want to try to keep the momentum going," Miller said. "We somewhat fell off the carriage in Charlotte. It was good to get back up on the horse." 
Despite hitting 8 of 16 3­pointers. the Pacers had to overcome a shooting barrage by Bucks backup guard Lindsey Hunter, who hit five 3-pointers in the fourth quarter. He hit four in consecutive possessions that cut the deficit to 91-81 with 6:23 to play. Hunter led the Bucks with 21 points. 
Indiana has won five of its last six games to climb back into playoff contention in the Eastern Conference. 
Miller hit 10 of 18 field goals and four of nine 3-pointers. Five Pacers scored in double figures. 
Jalen Rose added 16 points and a career high-tying 12 assists for the Pacers. Jermaine O'Neal and Austin Croshere scored 17 points each, and Zan Tabak had 13. 
Hornets 91, Nets 88 
Jamal Mashburn overcame a horrendous shooting night by scoring 10 of his 23 points over the final 1 :51 to lift the Charlotte Hornets to a victory over the New Jersey Nets. 
It was the Hornets' fifth straight victory and seventh in eight games. 
Masburn shot just 5-for-20 for the game and had only 10 points at the start of the fourth quarter when Charlotte trailed 70-69. 
He continued to miss early in 

the period as the Nets opened 
up an 85-73 lead with 6:58 to 
play. But New Jersey went cold 
from there, scoring just three 
points the rest of the game. 
Mashburn, meanwhile, final­

ly started to hit some shots to 
pull Charlotte back into the 
game. He hit two free throws

"I knew this would be more difficult than when they came to Detroit," Smith said. "This has been very emotional ­that's my old team and my buddies." 
In the meantime, Minnesota focused on the game. The Wolves had lost five of six games and trailed 55-53 at halftime. 
But Detroit went without a field goal for the first 9:11 of the third quarter, as the Wolves went on a 19-2 run to lead 72-57. Garnett and Brandon each scored six points during the run, as the Pistons missed 13 shots in a row. 
"(Coach) Flip (Saunders) tried to get KG (Garnett) and I to pick up the defensive pressure at halftime," Brandon said. "Then we hit some shots and that opened things up." 
Jerry Stackhouse scored 28 points for Detroit, 18 in the fourth quarter.· and Corliss Williamson added 21. 
Magic 97, Suns 91. 

The Orlando Magic are more than just Tracy McGrady. The Phoenix Suns learned that Wednesday night. 
McGrady was held to less than 30 points for just the sec­ond time in seven games, but he nearly had his first career triple-double as the Magic snapped the Suns' four-game winning streak. 
"It's all about trust," McGrady said. "That's what I've been learning throughout this season, being able to trust my teammates and create for others. That's what I was try­ing to do tonight." 
McGrady had 25 points on 10-for-28 shooting with 12 rebounds and eight assists. 
"This is a big win for us because it wasn't a great game by McGrady," Orlando coach Doc Rivers said. "He didn't have his shot early. He hit some big shots at the end. He just stayed in there and was a great decoy at times." 
Mike Miller had 16 points for the Magic. Darrell Armstrong, who had 13 points and 11 assists, scored four crucial points in the final 1 :21 as Orlando won its second consec­utive to finish its four-game road trip 2-2. 
"Back to back wins on the road are very big for us," Rivers said. "We basically come back the same way we left, and that's really impressive." 
Rockets 95, Bulls 78 
Rudy Tomjanovich's fear of the hapless Chicago Bulls was warranted for a little more than a quarter. 
Steve Francis scored 21 points and Hakeem Olajuwon added 17 as the Houston Hockets overcame an early 12­point deficit to beat Chicago. 
"This is one of those games that you're really concerned about as a coach." Tomjanovich said. 
Reserve Kenny Thomas had 14 points and 11 rebounds for the Rockets, who have won five of six and finished February 9­4. 
Elton Brand scored 21 points to lead the Bulls. who have lost five of six. 
Bryce Drew hit three 3-point­ers and dished out four assists in the first quarter as the Bulls broke out to a 29-19 lead. 
"We started out badly, but sometimes that's good," Tomjanovich said. "It got our attention." 
Chicago led by as many 12 before Houston rallied. The Rockets went on a 15-2 run. aided by six quick points from Thomas and a 3-pointer by Walt Williams to grab a 34-33 lead midway through the sec­ond quarter. 
with 26 points, including 13 in the third quarter when Charlotte climbed out of a 14­point deficit. Mashburn added nine assists and eight rebounds. 
Marbury led the Nets with 19 points on 8-of-22 shooting. Van Horn and Johnny Newman scored 15 each, while Martin, Lucious Barris and Aaron Williams added 10 each. 
Raptors 95, Hawks 88 
Vince Carter scored 32 points and Antonio Davis added 18 points and 15 rebounds as the Toronto Raptors beat the Atlanta Hawks. 
The Raptors, who never trailed, won their third straight as Carter topped 30 points for the fifth time in six games. 
One night after his 32 points led Toronto past Cleveland, Carter hit a 12-foot turnaround jumper at the end of the third quarter to keep the Hawks down 75-70. 
Atlanta, which lost its fifth straight, got a pair of free throws from Brevin Knight to close within one point before Carter's lay-in made it 85-82 · with 4:59 remaining. 
The Hawks, who lost for the 12th time in 14 games, trimmed the lead to 90-88 on Jason Terry's 20-foot jumper from the top of the key with 
2:01 remaining. 

Terry led Atlanta with 22 points, and Knight finished with 20. 
76ers 79, Heat 69 
Dikembe Mutombo grabbed 18 rebounds, blocked five shots and altered countless others, more than making up for another poor shooting night from Allen Iverson as the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Miami Heat. 
The tense, defensive-minded game ended with the fans taunting Miami coach Pat Riley, who questioned the Sixers' loyalty a day earlier for their trade of Theo Ratliff for Mutombo. 
The Sixers beat the Heat for the third time this season, and Riley and his big men got a close-up look at what a differ­ence Mutombo can make. Mutombo's presence forced Miami center Brian Grant to shoot 1-for-13 and forward Anthony Mason to go 1-for-8. 
Iverson attempted 27 shots and missed 21 but still finished with 27 points as he went 14­for-18 from the line. Rodney Buford added 16 points and Mutombo had 10. 
Eddie Jones led Miami with 22 points and Tim Hardaway had 20. The rest of the Heat shot a combined 8-for-42. 
Philadelphia snapped a two­game losing streak and avoided its first three-game slide of the season. 
Tlmberwolves 1.11, 
Pistons 100 

The Minnesota Timberwolves might miss Joe Smith. but Wednesday night he was just another opposing player. 
Terrell Brandon scored 23 points and Wally Szczerbiak added 22 as the Timberwolves beat the Detroit Pistons 111­
100. Kevin Garnett had a triple-double with 18 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. 

Smith signed with Detroit on Nov. 20 after NBA commission­er David Stern voided his con­tract with the Wolves, for whom he played the past two seasons. Stern ruled Minnesota had circumvented the salary cap by signing Smith to a secret long-term contract before the 1999 season. He has expressed a desire to return to the Timberwolves next season. 
"You always have to have some kind of competitive edge when you play." Garnett said. "But once the game is over, he's the same guy I play against in the summer. I'm just happy he's gotten an opportu­nity somewhere." 
On this night. Smith struggled with a 3-for-15 shooting night and scored only eight points in his first game in Minnesota since leaving the team early in the season.

continued from page 28 
'Tm deathly afraid of heights," Hobbins said, "but I think the mental and physical training from boxing helped me. It was a total rush. but it was a challenge to make myselr do it." 
Hobbins credits boxing with boosting his confidence in other areas, from job searches to social situations. 
Of course. it's paid off physi­cally. too, for the fighter who made it all the way to the cham­pionship round a year ago where he faced his toughest foe. He lost to junior captain Rob Joyce, a finalist at 175 pounds this year, in last year's finals. 
"Rob had just been pounding people. and he proceeded to pound me," Hobbins said. "I had a feeling it wasn't going to go my way, and it was a matter of making myself keep going and surviving the fight instead of winning it." 
This year, Bobbins, who lost in the semifinals in each of his first two Bengal Bouts, hopes to come out a champion for the first time. Down to 165 pounds. he made his way to the finals Wednesday night with a unani­mous decision over Justin "The ResLifo Regular" Myers. 
Hobbins started out quick and kept delivering punishment to Myers every time Myers came at him. Hobbins stayed patient and let Myers come to him, but made Myers pay when he did move in close. Although Hobbins, who goes by the nickname "Nightmare," tired at the end, he held a clear advantage over his opponent throughout the three rounds. 
To win his first title, Hobbins 
will have to get past Thomas 
"Boom-Boom" Macias, who won 
a unanimous decision over 
Christopher "Can't We All Just Get Along?" Kitalong that saw more flung fists than a bqrroom brawl. Macias' "brawler" style may force Hobbins to change his style. 
'Tm kind of a counter type boxer," Hobbins said. "They come to me instead of me going to them. They step to me, and I just punch them and I leave, and that's the best case scenario. I'm 

going  to  have  to  readjust  
myself."  
Boxing  became a part of  

Hobbins' life by chance. The Minnesota native played soccer all through high school and tried out for his dorm's soccer team freshman year. But after miss­ing a couple practices early on. Hobbins got cut from the team and found himself searching for something to do. 
He found a time-filler in Bengal Bouts after attending club activity night. At first he signed up for the physical work­out boxing would give him, but the club soon meant more than just something to keep him in shape. 
Boxing meant close friend­ships with his teammates, ser­vice to the community through the thousands of dollars Bengal Routs raise for the poor in Bangladesh and a chance to challenge himself on a daily basis. 
Hobbins even turned down an opportunity to study in Italy when former captain Tommy Will called him with the chance to be a team captain. Will's phone call came late in Hobbins' sophomore year, giving him a tough decision to make. 
"I thought, 'This is such a great honor and it's something I'm really starting to like. It's something that's just really starting to take hold of my exis­tence at Notre Dame,'" Hobbins said of his choice. "Italy, not withstanding a natural disaster, will probably be there a couple of years down the road. The dis­cipline and time it takes to be a boxing captain and boxer won't be there as long." 
The American Studies major. who hopes to work with Alliance for Catholic Education next year, passed on the semester abroad in favor of Bengal Bouts. While he'd still like to travel the world, he doesn't regret his decision for a moment. 
"The friendships I've made in Bengal Bouts I think are just as enriching," Hobbins said. 
Just as a title would nicely adorn his boxing career.

McGwire extends contract with Cards 
Associated Press 
Mark McGwire and the St. Louis Cardinals have agreed to a two-year extension worth about $30 million. 
The new deal runs through 2003, the season McGwire could be approaching Hank Aaron's home-run record of 755. 
The Cardinals have called a news conference for Thursday at 9 a.m. ET at the club's spring training complex. 
McGwire. 37, missed most of the second half of last season with a knAe injury and had surgery during the offseason, but has been healthy this spring. 
McGwire and the Cardinals were talking about an extension that would pay him $14 million in 2002 and $16 million the fol­lowing year. according to two baseball officials familiar with the negotiations who spoke on the condition they not be identi­lied. 

McGwire negotiated the exten­sion himself with the Cardinals and did not go through his agent, Bob Cohen. 
He is seventh on the career home-run list with 554, just 201 behind Aaron, and would have to average 67 homers in the next three seasons to tie the mark. 
McGwire set the single-season record with 70 homers in 1998, then hit 65 the following year. He hit 32 last se~on in just 236 at-bats. 
With an average salary of about $15 million, McGwire will rank about eighth in baseball. 
He could command far more money if he became a free agent after this season, perhaps even top the average salary record of $25.2 million set by Alex Rodriguez in his $252 million, 10-year contract with Texas, but McGwire has never been inter­ested in obtaining top dollar.

Irish face professional Devil Rays in exhibition game 

By NOAH AMSTADTER Assistant Sports Editor 
Torry Newton, Jr.. is a 12­year-old boy with a Notre Dame connection. 
His uncle, Steve Newton, is the former Sorin Hall Rector. In fact, the first mass Steve celebrated after being ordained was Terry's bap­tism. 
As the young boy grew up in St. Petersburg, Fla., he developed a love for the game of baseball -while still maintaining a dream of some­day returning to his bap­tismal roots in South Bend. 
Little Terry's dreams will come true when he serves as batboy in Notre Dame's con­test today against the major league Tampa Bay Devil Rays in an exhibition game. 
"He only wanted to go to the game," said Terry's father, Terry, Sr. "I surprised him with the batboy situa­tion." 
Both teams plan to use the 
game as a developmental 
tool. The Irish will start 
sophomore righthander 
Peter Ogilve on the mound. 
Ogilve missed his final two 
high school seasons and all of 
last year recovering from a 
back injury. The sophomore 
was rated one of the top 
pitchers in the state of Illinois 
prior to being injured. 
Ogilve will likely only throw 
the first few innings, then giv­
ing way to other second-tier 
pitchers on the Irish roster. 
The Devil Rays likely will 
start such stars as Fred 
McGriff, Vinny Castilla and Gerald Williams. But most of' these players will exit by the third inning, giving way to some of the prospects in the Tampa Bay camp. 
The game marks a preview of the three-day, four.team Devil Ray College Invitational. Florida Atlantic, Western Michigan and South Florida join host Notre Dame in the tournament. 
"This four-game stretch poses a tremendous challenge to our team and we are look ing to build on our solid start the past two weeks," said Irish head coach Paul Mainieri in a press release. 
Mainieri, who is originally from Florida, .looks forward to playing three quality teams. 
"We appreciate the Devil 
Rays arranging for this exhi­
bition and helping to organize 
what should be an exciting 
college baseball tournament," 
Mainieri said. "Fans who 
come to the games will not be 
disappointed by the competi 
tiveness and level of play and 
you could see several of these 
kids in the big leagues some 
day."

Atlantic on Friday at 1 p.m., 
with All-American 
righthander Aaron Heilman 
starting.

"It was great," said senior Kimberly Guy about the two days without losing a set. "The first day we struggled but we improved after that. We got bet­ter as the weekend went on." 
As the sixth-ranked team in the country, every team is look­ing to knock off the Irish. The Irish experienced their first taste of a team playing above their potential when they narrowly

"It's going to be a great match," coach Jay Louderback said. "They are very strong at the top of their lineup but they are also very deep." 
Said Guy: "We play Northwestern every year and they're very good and this year is one of their stronger years. It will be a good match."

Belles 
continued from page 28 
With a long history of part-time coaches and losing records, getting successful players to look into the program has been a challenge. Hecruiting needs to be improved. 
For right now, Smith will have to stay focused on the South Bend and Chicago areas. 
"I am from here locally, so I knew the area very well," Smith said. "So we've gotten out the information in the area around the South Bend area. That should help us out." 
As a Division III coach, Smith plans to focus mainly on Midwest states surrounding Indiana, such as Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio, for recruiting. Nationally, she will have to rely on other coaches or alumni contacting her about women wanting to play at Saint Mary's. 
"The best way for Division Ill, I'll hit the Midwest," Smith said. "As far as outside of that [I'll rely on outside contacts!. That's how you get outside." 
In addition to recruiting, Smith will be looking at facili­ties, coaching, and preparation for varsity basketball. 
Saint Mary's has a history that lacks a junior varsity team. With no junior varsity team, students do not have the opportunity to be introduced gradually to playing at a colle­giate level. They're thrown in with the sharks before they get to swim with the guppies. 
Smith hopes to begin a junior varsity program to Saint Mary's next year to eliminate that problem and get students more experience playing col­lege ball. 

Smith is also hoping to have a "more concrete coaching staIT." What that will mean is still unclear, however. 
The athletic department has been looking into finding money in order to hire full time coaches, and this may or may not affect the basketball pro­gram. Regardless. with a junior varsity program in the works, the basketball program will need to have a larger coaching stafT. 
The actual court in Angela is excellent to playing on, accord­ing to Smith. However, locker facilities and training facilities will eventually need to be improved. Again, specifics are unclear and money will play an important role in those needed improvements. 
With a team looking to move along the road to success, Smith is counting on fans to do their part as well. 
"We need to keep improving fans here and the excitement," Smith said. 
Crowds were less than capacity this season. 
Aiming high may require a lot of work, but the work is ready to be done. The journey to success will not be short for the Belles basketball team. but Smith is ready to embark on that journey.

Hobbins emphasizes mental aspects of boxing 
By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN Associate Sports Editor 
For Brian Hobbins, physical strength has little to do with boxing. 
The senior boxing club captain and team president contends that winning a bout depends on te'chnique -who has the best strategy for luring his opponent in, whose tactics can outmaneu­ver the other fighter. 
"It's almost more like chess than boxing for me." said Hobbins, a 165-pounder. 
Stepping into the ring also lets Hobbins know he passed the gut check, the one that tested his mental resolve to fight. 
"It's totally mental," Hobbins said. "Facing your fears and your doubts." 
Four years in the Notre Dame Boxing Club have helped Hobbins stare down his fears. The physical beating Hobbins has been taking in six-day-a­week Boxing Club practices and spars prepared him to do more than just fight tough opponents. It also prepared him for life. 
Hobbins used his Bengal Bouts experiences to battle through a fear of heights last spring. He, fellow captain Peter Ryan and several other friends traveled to West Virginia following Senior Week to go cliff climbing and white water rafting. Without his in-the-ring tests to steel his courage, Hobbins doubts he would have had the nerve to go through with the climb.

Smith sets 
goals for 
next year 

The season is over. The team finished with a record of 8-18. Now what? 
With one s·Hason under her belt, Saint Mary's head basket­ball coach Suzanne Smith has some deci­sions to make. She needs to move hr.r team. 
Doubling the number of wins the team had last season seems to be one step in the right direction. 
But what is the next step? Where is this team going and what is the next mile marker on that path? 
So. what is the destination? Well, better MIM play for one. The Belles won only two con­ference games this season after starting oIT the season with six victories in nine games. Staying focused and unified seemed to be a problem for Saint Mary's following a break at Christmas. Smith is hoping to fix that prob­lem next year. 
"I think we can do very well in our conference," Smith said. "What do we need to do is com­pete in the conference -be prepared for the long season." 
Step one to better play is working with this year's team. Smith called a meeting to dis­cuss this past season and next season with her team. 
"We just graduated one senior !Julie Norman]." Smith said. "If things go right every­one should come back." 
With most of her team returning next soason, Smith should have a step-up on this year's start. Smitl_1 didn't meet her team until August of this year. 
"It's so nice right now," she said. "We can get together in the post season and throughout the summer and have a better idea of what we're doing ­have some consistency." 
That seems to be good for the short term. But what about the long term? What is Saint Mary's doing to improve the team for the long haul? 
There arc several things that the team has been lacking.
