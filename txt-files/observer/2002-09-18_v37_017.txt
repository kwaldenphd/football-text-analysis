Lopez, Cortright discuss Iraqi weapons inspections 
By TERESA FRALISH 
News Writer 
Disarmament issues and the presence of weapons inspec­tors will continue to influence 
U.S. policy on possible action in Iraq, said lecturers from the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, at Tuesday's lecture "The Coming War with Iraq." 
George Lopez, senior fellow and director of policy studies at the Kroc Institute, and David Cortright. visiting research fel­low at the Institute, spoke to students and faculty about the Iraqi situation at the Hesburgh Center for International Studies. Scott Appleby, director of the Kroc Institute, moderat­ed the panel. 
Both lecturers stressed how the recent events of the past two days regarding weapons inspections in Iraq had impact­ed policy makers in the United States and the world communi­ty. "Much of the discourse has now focused ... on disarming Iraq," said Cortright. 
Cortright also discussed how different groups such as the United Nations and the Arab League may have influenced Iraq's decision to uncondition­ally allow U.N. inspectors back into the country. Despite the announcement by the United Nations, Cortright said the Bush administration might incorrectly see Iraq's agree­ment as ploy to further deceive the international community. "I think they have seriously misread [the situation]." said Cortright. 
At best Cortright thought 
U.N. officials would probably be able to enter Iraq within two to three weeks. "I believe that [they] can achieve consid­erable progress," said Cortright. 
Once in Iraq, inspectors would begin to create a weapons monitoring system and resolve remaining disar­mament tasks. 
Although inspectors had not been in Iraq for several years, Cortright felt that previous inspectors had strongly helped to reduce Iraq's stockpile of certain weapons and its ability to produce them. He explained how officials had helped to control the development of nuclear, chemical and biologi­cal weapons as well as ballistic missiles and missile engines. 
"By December of 1998, it was concluded that Iraq's capacity to build nuclear weapons had been eliminated," said Cortright. 
While previous inspections in Iraq were relatively successful, some degree of risk still exists, according to Cortright. "Much of Iraq's ability to produce

Neighborhood angered by parking 
By JAMES GAFFEY 
News Writer 
Controversy over parking for Notre Dame football games has erupted in the Wooded Estates neighbor­hood, which is a residential area just off campus near the intersection of South Bend Avenue and Edison Road. 
Residents' practice of rent­ing out their lawns for foot­ball parking has drawn a number of complaints from neighbors. 
They argue that the pres­ence of large numbers of vehicles in the area has com­promised the safety and peace of the neighborhood. 
Homeowners who rent out their lawns, however, enjoy the extra income. 
The conflict has attracted the attention of the South Bend police and the mayor's office. 
Concerned residents have witnessed visitors, many of whom tailgate prior to the games, exhibiting drunken behavior, littering and dump­ing hot coals on their lawns, said Lynn Coleman, assistant to Mayor Stephen Luecke. 
Although homeowners rent­ing out their lawns for foot­ball parking is not a new trend, a barrage of increas­ingly vehement grievances to the mayor's office is, Coleman said. 
According to an official let­ter from the mayor's office to Wooded Estates residents, hand-delivered just in time for the last weekend's game against Michigan, there are three violations police have primarily noticed: 
1) Local ordinances dictate that residential areas cannot compromise pedestrian safety and impede the access of emergency vehicles to the houses if such emergency access should be required. 
This year, the South Bend police tried to alleviate the problem by painting street curbs near intersections and restricting parking to only one side of the street during game weekends. But com­

may not be parked on lawns, according to city law. 
2) In residential zones, it is not permissible to charge peo­ple to park on your property. "As soon as you start charg­ing people, then you have a business," said Coleman. 
3) During football week­ends, many vehicles are found in no-parking zones. either those clearly marked by signs or unmarked zones, such as in front of a fire hydrant or too close to an intersection. 
The mayor's office is wor­ried that the large number of vehicles parked in front of the houses will cause traffic jams,

T h e 
police have responded to current prob­lems by issuing more citations to homeowners, the first of which results in a fine of $50, with $100 fines being issued for any citation after the first. The city is also considering pursuing litigation against repeat offenders, according to Coleman. 
Some currently pending cases may reach the court­room before the Oct. 5 home game versus Stanford.

Robbery investigated 
By HELENA PAYNE 
News Editor 
Notre Dame Security/Police said two recent attempted rob­beries under investigation could be linked. 
NDSP has posted crime bul­letins around campus to alert students of the incidents which occurred near South Dining Hall and the Rockne Building on South Quad. 
The first robbery occurred on Sept. 6 around 10:30 p.m. between Fisher Hall and South Dining Hall, said assistant director of NDSP Chuck Hurley. 
A Stanford Hall resident told campus police that the suspect grabbed him from behind, demanded money and ran in an unknown direction, Hurley said. 
The suspect was described as a 6-foot, black male of thin build, age 19 or 20, who wore an orange T-shirt. 
A similar description was given for the suspect in the sec­ond case that occurred Sept. 12 at 11:20 p.m. by the Rockne Building. There, the alleged victim said the suspect, age 17 to 19, was a black male and 6 feet tall with a slender build and short black hair. He was also accompanied by a white male who was 17 to 19 years old, about 135 lbs. and between 5-foot-5 and 5-foot-6. The second suspect was said to have short blondish-red hair. 
"The method of operation was the same in both of the cases and the description was very similar," Hurley said. 
According to the alleged vic­tim, a student, the first suspect demanded money from him in the attempted robbery at the Rockne Building. The student reacted by handing the money in his wallet over to the second suspect. The two suspects then ran off in the southeast direc­tion of campus. 
Because the alleged victim immediately reported the inci­dent to NDSP, Hurley said secu­rity officers on duty were able to spot two people by the Morris Inn that fit the descrip­tions of the second attempted robbery. 
Hurley said suspects ran into the field behind Keough Hall and eventually ran south and jumped the fence by the Notre Dame Cemetery. 
In both cases, Hurley said no students were injured and "no weapon was ever implied or seen." 
Hurley said NDSP encourages students to utilize Safe Walk and practice regular safety pre­cautions. 
"Students ought to walk with each other and watch out for each other," Hurley said.

INSIDE COLUMN 

What did you say? 
As mandated by the unwritten 
nightlife society rules, you can only ask 
people to repeat themselves so many 
times. 

Then it becomes ridiculous, as we 
have all learned at bars, parties and 
clubs, and you have 
to respond, despite 

the fact that you Shella Flynn 
have no idea what­
soever about what 

the person is say­News 
ing. Hence comes Production 
the interesting part 

Editor 
of the conversation, 
when you must 

invent a non-committal reply which 
could theoretically relate to the topic at 
hand a.nd hopefully conceal your 
absolute cluelessness. 

I became quite adept at this conversa­tional art over the summer, which I spent living with relatives in Ireland. My father is Irish-born and I've spent my entire life around Irish families, so I usu­ally have no problem understanding brogues. 
But one night out I found myself chat­ting with an inebriated Irish electrician from the country and his equally intoxi­cated Australian cousin. 
The music blared and their accents 
blurred and I was hopelessly, horribly 
lost. When the Irishman first addressed 
me, it was fabulous. 

"What?" 1asked, leaning toward him and indicating that the music was impairing my hearing. He repeated him­self. I smiled and waved at the speakers again. 
"What?" 

He leaned down and said the same thing -I'm guessing -again. To this day, I have no idea as to what he was trying to communicate. 
But I figured that two "What?"s were enough, so I stood back thoughtfully and moved my head a little -not a shake and not a nod, just an indecipherable movement -and answered. 
"Hmrnmm, right," I said. 

This response seemed satisfactory, and the conversation continued. The Australian joined in and we chatted away, and I hadn't the foggiest notion about what was going on. Ijust spouted out ambiguous lines and made vague hand gestures, and if the pair of them had consumed two or three fewer pints they probably would have questioned my mental capacity. Fortunately for me, the pints kept flowing, they kept drink­ing and I could continue with my evasive and inane discl1Ssion about something. "Right," "interesting," "maybe," "some­times" and "Do you think?" became my words and phrases of choice. 
So the moral of thls column is that it is very possible to spend an entire night talking while saying nothing at all to people you don't understand. Giving them alcohol helps, but even if it's not available you simply have to be original. Our language is full of ambiguous words and indistinct pointless sentences. As long as you present them right and accompany them with the appropriate movements and facial expressions, you'll be fine. 
Don't you agree? 

Hmmm... interesting.

Saint Mary's prayer team has opened itself to students for the first time this school year. 
Instituted in August 2000, the prayer team originally served as a response to faculty and staff suffering from then-senior Kristi Morris' death in spring 2000. 
It also served as a support for people facing other difficulties in life. A new concept on cam­pus, it grew in popularity and was seen as an effective way to generate prayer and help grieving people. 
"Submitting a prayer request really serves two functions. It States. 
"A majority of professors at Korean Universities have American Ph.Os and more and more Koreans remain in the 
U.S.." said Kim. 
Obtaining legal status to work in the United States was an ordeal for Kim. 
''I almost became a terrorist in INS legal terms," Kim said. 
His visa did not come through until the day before classes were scheduled to begin. 
While Kim currently lectures in comparative politics and Russian politics, he supports the idea of developing a class or a major specifically in East Asian politics. 
"Students reaJJy should learn about Asia, particularly China [which] is on its way to becom­ing an economic powerhouse," said Kim. 
Overall, Kim is disappointed by the Asian studies programs in American universities. Those in the Midwest and East are particularly lacking. Kim said. Students' knowledge of the East is also deficient. 
Even China is Greek to American students, Kim said. 
He hopes that as the East grows in international impor­tance, students both at Saint Mary's and Notre Dame will develop interest in the region.

Since its creation, the prayer team has handled requests on behalf of students, but has not taken direct requests from stu­dents. In response to the over­whelming request for student prayer, the team has decided to allow direct student submis­sions.

City gives away pot in protest 
Associated Press 
SANTA CRUZ 
Calling Santa Cruz a sanc­tuary from federal authori­ties, medical marijuana advocates -joined by city leaders -passed out pot to about a dozen sick people at City Hall. 
"Santa Cruz is a special place, and today we're let­ting the world know how compassionate we can be," Mayor Christopher Krohn said. "We're taking a stand." 
More than 1,000 communi­ty members jammed into the garden-like courtyard for a supportive demonstration during the giveaway. Some held signs reading, "DEA Go 
Away"  and  "U.S.  Out  Of  
Santa Cruz."  
Several  people  in  the  

crowd lit marijuana ciga­rettes, but it was mostly an alcohol and drug-free gath­ering, which was what orga­nizers requested. 
Marijuana is illegal as a medicine or as a recreation­al drug under federal law. But state law, and county and city ordinances, say it's legal if recommended by a doctor. 
Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Richard Meyer said he was appalled by Tuesday's event, and feared the community is sending a dangerous mes­sage to its children. 
"Marijuana is an illegal drug in this country," he said. 
But Mike Corral, who helped distribute the mari­juana. said the only message sent was that "marijuana is medicine." 
In Santa Cruz and many California communities, local law enforcement works closely with growers and distributors who help sick people obtain marijuana. 
Krohn a.nd his colleagues didn't handle the marijuana Tuesdav, but stood in soli­darity with the clinic work­ers and users. 
Police Chief Steve Belcher said his officers didn't plan to arrest registered, legiti­mate members picking up their medicine. However, he said, "This is not going to be a smoke-out at City Hall." 
People who showed up to smoke marijuana without a doctor's recommendation could face arrest, he said. 
The City Hall pot distribu­tion comes less than two weeks after DEA agents arrested the owners of a local pot farm and confiscat­ed 130 plants that had been grown for use as medicine. 
There was no official city sponsorship of the event. Council members and med­ical marijuana advocates simply acted on their own in a public space, said City Attorney John Barisone. 
Hal Margolin, who said he suffers chronic back pain, said he was relieved to receive his weekly marijua­na dose. 
"We don't buy it, we don't sell it, we don't ship it in interstate commerce and we don't give it to children," he said.

United Nations and Iraq plan inspectors return 
fusociated Press 
WASHINGTON 

As U.N. weapons inspectors moved ahead with plans to return to Iraq, the United States and Russia clashed on Tuesday over whether to take Baghdad at its word or impose a new ultimatum. "We have seen this game before," said a skeptical Colin Powell. 
The secretary of state reaf­firmed Washington's call for a tough anti-Iraq resolution by the U.N. Security Council, despite Iraq's sudden about­face on inspections. 
But Russia's foreign minister said he saw no immediate need for new U.N. demands if the inspectors are quickly dis­patr.hed. He was backed up by Arab leaders, Moscow's tradi­tional allies. The "logic of war" may now be replaced by "the logic of peace," said one. 
The 15-member Security Council majority decided, despite a U.S. request for more time, to quickly schedule a meeting, possibly Wednesday, with chief weapons inspector Hans Blix to discuss renewed inspections. The Americans, supported by Britain and Colombia, wanted first to pre­pare a new resolution, diplo­mats said. · 
Blix then met with Iraqi rep­resentatives, after which the Iraqis announced talks were sel for Sept. 27 to make final plans. 
In the Middle East, the busi­ness of preparing for war went on, as American warplanes flew under aggressive new rules over Iraq, and U.S. com­manders considered basing heavy bombers closer by. 
At a U.N. news conference at which Powell and Russia's Igor Ivanov laid out conflicting views, Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed for them to stick together on Iraq. 
This is "the beginning, not an end," he said. "We should try to maintain the unity of purpose that has emerged.'' 
The Security Council then went into closed-door consul­tations on a timetable for deal­ing with the fast-changing Iraq issue. 
The council sent weapons inspectors into Iraq after the 1990-91 Gulf War, to ensure that President Saddam Hussein's regime destroyed any chemical or biological weapons it possessed, and any capacity to produce those or nuclear weapons. 
The inspectors left in 1998, ahead of U.S. airstrikes, amid Iraqi allegations that some were spying for the United States and countercharges that Baghdad wasn't cooperat­ing with the inspection teams. fully called for the Security

Afghan foreign minister Abdullah made the rounds in the nation's capital Tuesday, telling Congress and the Bush administration that Afghan President Hamid Karzai faces a severe test: Making good on promises of security and economic recovery. That test will be made more difficult, Abdullah said, if U.S. support for Karzai's regime fal­ters because official attention is divert­ed elsewhere. 
In an interview with The Associated Press. Abdullah said Karzai expressed his concerns to Bush when they met at the United Nations last week. Abdullah said he planned to raise the issue with 
U.S. officials again during this visit, even though Bush "assured us and reassured us" that Afghanistan will remain a priority. 
"While there are other major con­cerns for the United States like the Middle East, like Iraq, the focus from the campaign against terror shouldn't be shifted, because that campaign is far from being over," Abdullah said. "Our point, at this stage, is that Afghanistan is a test for the interna­tional community, for the United States. Success or failure will be judged by the whole world, and will have its implications." 
As for Iraq, Abdullah said he viewed Saddam Hussein's surprise offer to allow weapons inspections as just another stalling tactic that ignores the need to fully comply with U.N. resolu­tions. 
"In the past, they have played with time," Abdullah said. "I wonder if they

U.S. pushes for Iraq disarmament: 
The Bush administration stepped up pressure Tuesday for a new U.N. Security Council disarma­ment resolution for Iraq and disclosed plans for moving B-2 bombers closer to Baghdad, prepar­ing for possible war to remove President Saddam Hussein. President Bush, speaking in Nashville, Tenn., said the United Nations must show that it is more than an "ineffective debating society". 
Bishops questions U.S.'s Iraq plans: 
America's Roman Catholic bishops have told President Bush they have grave reservations about a unilateral U.S. strike against Iraq and urged him to use the United Nations to pressure Saddam Hussein for change. Bishop Wilton Gregory, presi­dent of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, acknowledged in a statement Tuesday that Iraq posed a threat, but said it would be diffi­cult to justify a pre-emptive attack.

The foreign minister came to the United States to give an update on Afghan reconstruction and a looming humanitarian crisis as 1.6 million Afghans who were displaced by war return home. He described a series of challenges that could undermine Karzai's hold on power if Karzai does not meet them successfully.

I am hereby challenging you, and/or anyone else in the Department ofTheology, to a public debate on the Doctrine of the "resurrection ofthe dead" taught by Jesus, Isa-iah and Mohammed; which, as I explain on my web page at http://www.dead­seanaghammadiresearch.com, is not the doctrine of a physical 'resurrection' of a dead body from the grave; but, rather, similar to the Buddhist Doctrine of'Rebirth'. 
Elucidating Christian theology's fundamental contradictions ofthe Teaching ofJesus is not, by any means, a trivial matter; espe­cially in the context of a threatened war between the United States and Iraq [and Iran] and the continuing threats of interna­
tional terrorism originating in the corresponding lies and errors oflslamic theology. 
On the contrary, it is the contradiction of this Truth by all of the monotheistic religions--and the censorship and suppression of 
this Truth by the religious and media officials in, especially, the United States and Israel--which is at the foundation of the theo­logical conflicts between Judaism, Christianity and Islam; and, thus, the political conflicts between Israelis and Palestinians 
especially over Jerusalem. 
Moreover, no genuine or long-lasting success will ever be achieved in what has been referred to the 'war against terrorism' with­out forcefully striking at the theological foundations ofthis 'conflict between civilizations'. 
Thus, the ultimate goal of this debate is to begin to resolve these theological conflicts; thereby diminishing the potential for a 
massive military confrontation between these civilizations, and the incalculable--and unnecessary--suffering, bloodshed and 
death that would result from such a confrontation. 
The critical question, then, is whether you will agree to such a public debate, in an effort to achieve genuine Peace between 
Judaeo-Christian civilization and Islamic civilization; or whether, succumbing to "wishful thinking" or "willful blindness", you 
will choose, instead, to place the economic interests of Notre Dame and Christianity, Inc. ahead of not only the personal, commu­
nity, and national security interests ofthe people ofthe United States; but, also, the very future of human civilization itself. 
While I await a timely response to this challenge to debate, I must also emphasize that time is not on the side ofthose who sin­cerely desire both a genuine Peace in the Middle East and a definitive end to any and all violence, terrorism and warfare origi­nating in theological error... 
Whether it be Jewish, Christian, Muslim, or Hindu. 
Sincerely, 
Michael Cecil

McDonald's stocks hits 7-year low 
McDonald's Corp. warned of lower sales and profits Tuesday following a summer of disappointing results, and its top executive said a series of moves aimed at turning around its slumping U.S. business will take time to pay off. 
The announcement sent McDonald's ailing stock diving another 13 percent, hitting a seven-year low for the second time in a week. 
The hamburger giant said it will slow its rapid expansion pace abroad, where it has been opening an average of three new restau­rants a day, as it invests in a U.S. initiative focused on $1 menu items, restaurant renova­tions and faster, friendlier service. 

Iraq offer may ease OPEC pressure 
With OPEC ministers under pressure to boost oil output and presumably give importers a break from prices driven higher by war fears, Iraq shook things up on Tuesday by offering to readmit U.N. weapons inspectors. 
The news sent oil futures prices down about 
4.4 percent initially on London's International Petroleum Exchange but prices regained some lost ground later to shave the decline to about 2 percent for the day. 
Lower prices could bolster the arguments of those OPEC members who say the oil supply has boen adequate but crude has been inflat­ed by a "war premium" of $2 to $4 per barrel on perceptions that the United States might soon invade Iraq in an attempt to topple President Saddam Hussein. 

GM of Canada agrees to labor deal 
General Motors of Canada and the Canadian Auto Workers reached a tentative agreement Tuesday on a new three-year contract to avoid a strike scheduled to begin at midnight. The agreement had been expected, with both sides expressing optimism throughout the day that a deal was in reach, though it still requires ratification by the CAW workers. 
. Illegal pay­ments approach tens of millions 
Asoclated Press 
CONCORD, N.H. 
Tyco International Ltd. on Tuesday disclosed tens of millions in unauthorized payments to dozens of employees under the com­pany's indicted former chief executive. 
The conglomerate also alleged that the former leader, Dennis Kozlowski, tried to thwart an investiga­tion of the payments and induced former general counsel Mark Belnick to go along for the ride with a hefty, secret compensation package. 
The filing Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission fol­lowed a four-month internal investigation and was the first time Tyco outlined details of a loan forgiveness program. Eleven executives are named as among the 51 Tyco employees who -at Kozlowski's direction and without board approval ­received $56 million in bonuses that effectively canceled out loans they had taken from the company's relocation program. 
The forgiveness program included not only relocation loans, but extra money to reimburse employees for the tax consequences of the loans. 
Another $50 million was paid to Kozlowski and for­mer chief financial officer Mark Swartz, both of whom were indicted last week on charges of looting the com­pany. Belnick also was indicted for falsifying docu­ments to cover up a loan he'd taken. 
Tyco also detailed tens of thousands of dollars in per­sonal expenditures Kozlowski made with com­pany money, including $15,000 for an umbrella stand, $97,000 for flowers and $2,900 for coat hang­ers. 
Paul Lapides, a corporate governance expert at Kennesaw State University in Georgia, said the unau­thorized spending should have been caught by board members years ago and he expects the company's management shake-up to continue. 
"Here's a big company that is being run like a monarchy, and I think what the report is saying is the reign of King Kozlowski is over," Lapides said. "The king is gone and it's time for full and fair disclosure and getting hack to the basics." 
In a lawsuit Tyco filed last week against Kozlowski, the company alleges some of the money was used to buy employees' silence about his misdeeds . 
Tyco spokesman Gary Holmes said the lawsuit was referring just to Belnick and Swartz. The other employ­ees were "misled by Mr. Kozlowski to believe these programs were authorized and proper." He declined to elaborate. 
Tyco, which makes every­thing from security systems to undersea fiber optic cable and had $36 billion in revenue last year, said the forgiven loans were not dis­closed to the board. 
The lawsuit seeks repay­ment from Kozlowski for the loans he approved. 
State securities regulators said Tuesday afternoon there was enough evidence for them to take regulatory action against Tyco and they would decide how to proceed in the next few days. They declined to elab­orate. 
Kozlowski asserted in a September 2000 memo to a human resources officer that more than $95 million in forgiven loans had been approved by the board, even though it hadn't, the company said in the filing. 
Kozlowski told Patricia Prue, Tyco's senior vice president of human resources, the payments were bonuses for good work. Prue received a for­given loan of about $1.3 million, the filing said. 
Mark Foley, a vice presi­dent of finance, prepared a memo signed by Swartz that showed the company would include the expense as part of other charges, rather than account for the loans individually as employee compensation, the filing said. 

The filing also said Kozlowski and Belnick secretly agreed to tie Belnick's compensation to Kozlowski's, "thereby giving Belnick an undisclosed incentive to aid and facili­tate Kozlowski's improper diversion of company funds to Kozlowski's personal benefit." 
The terms of Belnick's compensation were not dis­closed to the board, but Belnick kept a copy of a let­ter from Kozlowski in his office that said Belnick's bonuses would be no small­er than one-third of Kozlowski's. 
Tyco released only the names of senior executives who benefited from the loan forgiveness program in its filing. Holmes said the names of lower-level employees would not be released. 
Those beneficiaries named for the first time are: Jerry R. Boggess, president of Tyco's fire and securities services division; Stephen B. McDonough, former presi­dent of Tyco's plastics divi­sion; Neil R. Garvey, former president and chief execu­tive of Tyco subsidiary TyCom Ltd.; former general counsel Irving Gutin; execu­tive vice president Brad McGee; Prue; Jeffrey Mattfolk; Michael Robinson; and Scott Stevenson. 



Charles Schwab to cut 1,880 jobs 
Associated Press 
SAN JOSE, Calif. 
Charles Schwab Corp. announced Tuesday it will cut about 10 percent of its work force -roughly 1.880 jobs -as the discount and online brokerage continues to struggle with weak trading volumes. 
In August. the San Francisco­based company hinted it would be making cuts but provided no num­bers. At that time, the company had about 18,800 employees. 
It was not immediately known what business units would be tar­geted by the layoffs, which are expected to be completed by the 
end of November, said Greg Gable, a Schwab spokesman. 
The layoffs will represent Schwab's second major payroll purge in two years as the broker­age continues to adjust to a bear market that has spooked investors and pinched the company's profits. 
Schwab disclosed Tuesday that it expects to earn 7 cents to 8 cents per share in the third quarter. Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call were expecting an average of 8 cents per share. 
With the latest job cuts, Schwab will have cut its work force by about 35 percent, jettisoning more than 9,000 employees, in less than two years. 
Management says it can't afford to retain so many workers with cus­tomers continuing to eschew the stock market. 
Schwab reported that clients made an average of 117,500 daily trades in August, which is up 3 per­cent from 2001 but down 25 per­cent from last month. The figure excludes mutual fund trades. 
The company also said new assets brought by new and existing clients in August totaled $4.4 billion. "While trading volume is down ... we're still seeing positive flows of assets into the company," Gable said.

34 new shows will debut this fall 
Associated Press 
NEWYORK Ride a new wave of familiarity as another 1V season begins. 
More precocious kids. Tell-tale corpses. People moving in with people who don't want them. Snarky sparring between mates. Attitude. Irony. Hugs. Even an old-fashioned Western -set in the intergalactic future. 
With 34 new fall series, televi­sion remains part "lights and wires in a box" as newsman Edward R. Murrow declared a half-century ago and part echo chamber. 
What's echoing loudest of all are expressions of comfort. 
On this, the first fall lineup to respond to the trauma of 9-11, you can take dramatic comfort from cops-and lawyers-dis­pensed justice, doctors' healing and cozy family life. Plus comfort as recalled from bygone erac;. 
Television, like most of its view­ers, idealizes the past. Just think of the sitcom "Happy Days," which, set in the halcyon '50s, aired from 1974 well into the '80s. 
Now the 1980s provides the nostalgic setting for a pair of new series: the ABC dramedy "That Was Then" and the WB's half­hour comedy "Do Over," which dehut.s Thursday at 8:30 p.m. EDT. Playing to an audience that would love to scrap the past year for a global do-over, each show zaps its adult hero back to high school, where life's mistakes can be nipped in the bud. 
With six major broadcast net­works and dozens of cable outlets vying for your attention, competi­tion this fall is fierce. Thls means how each network crafts its schedule has never had more impact on the fate ofits shows. 
In other words: location, loca­l.ion, location! 
"Scheduling isn't so important that content doesn't matter," says media analyst Steve Sternberg, "but a good show isn't going to succeed just because it's a good show." 
Old viewing habits die hard. So any new series that Lm't blessed with a strong lead-in and soft competition (and few are so lucky) demands a hearty promo­tional push to get it noticed. Otherwise, the viewer may not even know that show exists in the hurly-burly of fall premieres ­and roughly two-thirds of them will be history by May. 
But in some cases, the message is getting through loud and clear. 
Consider ABC's "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter," which handicappers have picked as a likely success ­and which, for months before its Tuesday premiere, had been heavily promoted. 
John Ritter, the sitcom's long­familiar star, recalls how he was recently approached on the street by a well-wisher. _ 
"He said, 'Hey man, I really like your new show -that teenage girl thing.' rsaid, 'Thanks.'" Ritter rolls his eyes. "The show wasn't even on yet, but after so many promos, this guy thought he'd seen it." 
Never easy, building viewer awareness is even harder for the networks when, thanks to their pack mentality, their new shows seem interchangeable with shows launched by their rivals. 
How much promotional muscle must ABC and CBS apply before a viewer gets the difference between CBS' medical drama "Presidio Med'' and "MDs," ABC's competing medical drama in the Wednesday-at-10-p.m. time slot? 
And what about the remarkably look-alike "Do Over" and "That Was Then" (which premieres on ABC Friday, Sept. 27)? 
On both of these shows, a thir­tyish single guy who feels like a failure is jolted back to his high school years in the 1980s. 
There he has a wisecracking best friend (the only person he entrusts with his time-travel secret), an inattentive father, an unhappy mother and a longing for a beautiful blond classmate, who is introduced to the viewer in dreamy slow motion. 
And he has a chance to correct a life-defining screw-up: Facing the student body to make a speech, he froze in panic the first time around. 
Despite these similarities, there are also differences between the two series. For starters, "Do Over" is a wry comedy, while 'That Was Then" is a bittersweet romance. 

Woodstock holds 'artsy' film fest 
Associated Press 
WOODSTOCK, N.Y. Woodstock is ready for its close-up, again. 
The third annual Woodstock Film Festival kicks off Wednesday. Like the town· hosting it, the five-day festival figures to be artsy and left-of­center with a distinct New York City accent. 
If the Sundance Film Festival conjures up an image of founder Robert Redford, the Woodstock festival's image is closer to one on its Web site showing board member Ethan Hawke in a black T-shirt. 

Woodstock is a regional festi­val, not as big and powerful as showcases like Sundance and Toronto. But Matthew Ross, senior editor at indie WIRE, said the festival is raising its profile and status. Woodstock has a leg up on other regional festi­vals, Ross noted, because it caters to the film community in New York City, about 90 miles south. 
"It will always be a bit higher on the radar than some of the other good regional festivals simply because of the people it can attract," Ross said. 
Actor/director Tim Robbins and Parker Posey -called an Indie Queen for playing so many idiosyncratic characters in independent films -are among big names slated to

show up. And since it's Woodstock, a guy from Phish and Arlo Guthrie are on the schedule, too. 
The festival, which runs through Sunday, landed two films that created a buzz in top­rung festivals: "Personal Velocity," which took top dra­matic honors at Sundance, and "Far From Heaven," which earned Julianne Moore best­actress honors this month at the Venice Film Festival. 
Many movie people have full­time or weekend homes near Woodstock in the Hudson Valley. Ismail Merchant of the Merchant-Ivory moviemaking partnership needs only to drive across the Hudson River, orga­nizers say. Festival director Meira Blaustein said an adviso­ry board member with a house in the area helped land Robbins, who is receiving the festival's Maverick Award. 
'There's much less than six degrees of separation. That has a lot to do with a lot of pro­gramming in the festival," she said. 
The Woodstock festival drew about 5,000 people last year, though there were a lot of no­shows because it started the week after the Sept. 11 attacks. Blaustein expects at least that many people this year. 
She said she is trying to build on what this venerable arts colony already has -a.n artis­tic sensibility and a lot of resi­dents involved in music and the media. 
Woodstock became an arts colony a century ago and its countercultural credentials were revived with the 1969 Woodstock festival, which was actually held 50 miles away in Bethel. Blaustein said she tries to pick "movies that make a dif­ference, movies that make you think." 
That sort of sensibility is reflected in festival fare like Gus Van Sant's feature "Gerry," and "The Agronomist," a docu­mentary in progress by Jonathan Demme about a slain Haitian journalist and human rights activist. 
Ram.one's death was overdose 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES 
A heroin overdose killed Dee Dee Ramone in June, the coro­ner's office said Tuesday. 
A toxicological examination of blood samples taken during an autopsy found that Ramone had a lethal amount in his body, coroner's office spokesman David Campbell said. 
Ramone, a founding member of the punk rock Ramones, was found dead June 5 on the couch of his home by his wife. An overdose was suspected because drug paraphernalia including a syringe was found nearby. 
His death, at age 50, came 11 weeks after the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and 14 months after the group's 49-year-old lead singer Joey Ramone died of cancer. 
Dee Dee Ramone was one of the band's major songwriters and its bassist, bringing a fast­paced sound to an era dominat­ed by disco and corporate rock. The first album, "Ramones," was released in 1976. 
The Ramones' best-known songs were "Beat on the Brat," "I Wanna Be Sedated," "Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue," "Teenage Lobotomy" and "Sheena Is a Punk Rocker." 
In his autobiography, "Lobotomy: Surviving the Ramones," Dee Dee Ramone, whose real name was Douglas Glenn Colvin, wrote of his struggle with drug and alcohol abuse.

never been to Fire Island. 
In a letter to the editor in 
this week's issue of New York 
magazine, the actor took gos­
sip columnist Marc Malkin to 
task for reporting that Spacey 
was renting a palatial house on 
the island off Long Island's 
southern coast, complete with 
a private boat. 
Spacey called the item, titled 
"Spacey out in Fire Island," a 
"total inaccuracy." 
Spacey wrote that he'd never 
been to Fire Island and 
quipped that he couldn't possi­
bly have visited the island 
because he had spent the sum­
mer at an amusement park in 
Boise, Idaho. 
"While I understand that 
most of your reporting is done 
in good fun and that this par­
ticular story does not appear to 
have been written with mali­
cious intent," Spacey wrote, "it 
is so completely untrue that it 
seems to warrant a reexami­
nation by New York of the 
freedom it gives to reporters 
who write anything they want 
without concern for the facts."

Cotntnunity college nutnbers rise 
Associated Pre.ss 
RED BANK, N.J. 
When Jennifer Buono decid­ed where to enroll after high school, she chose little-known Brookdale Community College in central New Jersey over Rutgers University. 
The bottom line, Buono said, was the bottom line. 
"Brookdale is cheaper and you're getting the same edu­cation for less," said the 18­year-old education major. "And when I get out of school, I won't have all those student loans to pay off." 
Across the country, many students have made similar decisions this semester. 
Though official figures aren't available, community college administrators say enrollment is way up, a prod­uct of the sour economy and rising tuition rates at four­year schools, including state universities such as Rutgers. 
Norma Kent, a spokes­woman for the American Association of Community Colleges, said many schools are reporting percentage increases in the double digits for enrollment. 
This comes at a time when community college costs also are creeping up and education budgets nearly everywhere are being squeezed by declin­ing state revenues. 
Barbara Grano, of Lakeland Community College outside Cleveland, said that with a 10 percent increase in students in the past year, classroom capacity is being pushed beyond its limits. Grano recently visited an algebra class where 34 students were squeezed in a room intended to hold 30 maximum. 
"Students are begging their way into classes," Grano said. "They're saying, "Please, let me take this class. I have to get in." 
Such overcrowding troubles Kent. "We are all about access," she said, "And the idea that we might have to turn people away is appalling." 
Recessions tend to inflate college enrollment. But this time is different because the increases are primarily at the community college level, said Barmak Nassirian, a policy analyst with the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. 
With many large, public uni­versities hiking tuition, Nassirian said it is not sur­prising that students are turn­ing to commuter schools. 
"For most families, the eco­nomic downturn doesn't man­ifest itself in depleted portfo­lios but instead forces them to make different choices," Nassirian said. "And for those people, community colleges present a safety net." 
Renee Brock, a freshman at Brookdale Community College, says community col­leges are even more attractive for students who must pay their own tuition. 
"I would say that a lot of people whose parents are paying are going to the four­year colleges," she said. "But for those who are paying their own way, this is a good place to go." 
In cities and towns hard-hit 
by the economic downturn, 
community colleges also have 
become a magnet for dis­
placed workers. 
On the six campuses of the Moberly Arca Community College in northeast Missouri -a region with several plant closings -many of the 2,600 students are repositioning themselves for rccession­prouf jobs. 
The typical Moberly student is female, 29 years old and shows up for computer-orient­ed classes that meet after 5 p.m. 
Moberly has seen credit­hour registration increase by 7 percent this semester. 
"We work with companies to retrain them and bring them to different skill levels. A lot of these folks, with limited skills, need to work on their math and developmental skills to get back in the work force," said Ben Taylor. the dean of technical and career pro­grams at Moberly. 
Community colleges also are increasingly attractive because they are developing ways students can stay beyond the two years of coursework it takes to receive an associate's degree. 
Brookdale has an operating agreement with several col­leges and universities that allows students enrolled in a "communiversity" program to use the Internet and other means to get a bachelor's degree without transferring. 


Public hearings draw fire from. judges 
Associated Press 
PHH.ADELPHIA 
Federal judges considering the legality of secret immigra­tion hearings for terrorism sus­pects expressed concern Tuesday that making the pro­ceedings public could help ter­rorists stage more attacks. 
"We could make a decision here ... and people could die. Lots of people," said 3rd U.S. Circuit Court or Appeals Judge Morton Greenberg. 
The appeals court is consid­ering a Justice Department request to overturn a lower­court ruling that rejected the government's practice of hold­ing secret immigration hear­ings related to the terrorism investigation as unconstitution­al. 
Justice Department lawyer Gregory Katsas told the three­judge panel that opening the hearings could cause "poten­tially catastrophic" harm. For instance, he said, revealing how suspects were caught would give terrorists clues about how to enter the country undetected. 
Media organizations and civil rights groups have sued to make the hearings public, or allow them to be closed only in cases where the government has persuaded a judge that secrecy was necessary to pro­tect national security. 
Hundreds of foreigners were secretly detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service after the Sept. 11 attacks. Critics have charged that many of them weren't ter­rorists and were detained for long periods without cause. 
"Society has an overwhelm­ing interest to know when its government is detaining people for months and months and months," American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt said. 
Unlike criminal or civil trials, immigration hearings aren't always open to the public. Katsas argued that a 40-year­old federal law allows judges to exclude the public from INS detention hearings if doing so is in the public's best interest. 
Detention hearings were open for decades until shortly after Sept. 11, when the chief immigration judge ordered them closed for detainees the FBI though of special interest in the terrorism investigation. 
The judges said they expect­ed to make a decision soon in the case, which the ACLU is arguing on behalf of the New Jersey Law Journal, a weekly publication, and North Jersey Media Group, publisher of the Herald News of West Paterson, a daily newspaper. 
U.S. District Judge John Bissell in Newark, N.J., ruled against the government in May, finding that it could close hear­in gs only on a case-by-case basis. The U.S. Supreme Court in June issued an order staying the decision while the case was appealed to the 3rd Circuit.

5 hurt in bombing of Palestinian school 
Associated Press 
HEBRON 

Israeli police and Palestinian officials in the West Bank said they believe extremist Jewish settlers planted two bombs in a Palestinian school yard Tuesday. 
One device exploded, injur­ing five children. 
Yehoshua Mor-Yosef, spokesman for the Jewish Settlers' Council, said the bombing was an "immoral and illegal act." 
Israeli military officials said the explosion occurred near a water cooler in the courtyard of the Ziff junction secondary school south of Hebron. The second bomb was found and safely detonated. The Israeli military controls the junction, a remote region populated mainly by Bedouins. 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres' office, mean­while. said the government had rejected a Palestinian cease-fire proposal during a meeting at United Nations headquarters in New York. 
The proposal by Palestinian Cabinet Minister Nabil Shaath called for an end to Palestinian attacks against Israeli civilians in a first phase and an end to all attacks in the second. 
Peres' office said the plan was unacceptable because it would allow attacks on those not classified as civilians dur­ing its first phase.

Random hookups. These beer­soaked, hormone-induced incidents have become as much a part of campus life as pep rallies and freshman semi­nars. And lately, on a campus that demands conve­nience and simplici­ty, it's as if a ran­dom hookup has become the ulti­mate form of Grab 'n' Go. 
Much like our favorite bagged version of lunch on the run, a ran­dom hookup is simple, easy and always an option. The appeal of Grab 'n' Go is in its convenience. There's no com­mitment to the dining hall, no cumber­some trays -there's no need to even sit down. 
We often get our Grab 'n' Go in between lunch and dinner. just as we often have our hookups in between relationships. Sometimes, we even for­get the names of the items we've cho­sen. And the fact that athletes enjoy unlimited Grab 'n' Go only furthers the point. 
After all, isn't the literal definition of a random hookup to grab ... and go? 
It seems that the dimly lit, window­less bars we frequent at night are replaced by dimly lit, windowless din­ing hall side rooms during the day and the ease in which we choose our veg­etable trays and leftover chocolate brownies follows us into our evening activities. We choose what we want fairly easily, bag it and leave as quickly as possible. The same can be said for many of our random hookups. 

Notre Dame is a community that always seems to be on a deadline. We allow a certain amount of time to sleep, study, party and eat. We priori­tize our time and often look for a way to get things done as quickly and effi­ciently as possible. We're very focused. Any added restraints on our time are met with a great deal of anxiety. Whatever it is, we just don't have the time. That's why we get Grab 'n' Go. That's why we have our hookups. 
Yes, there is an enormous difference between getting some lunch and simply getting some. However, both seem to function on the simple basis that they are frequent, convenient and ultimate­ly unsatisfying. 
We complain every day that what we are offered at Grab 'n' Go simply isn't enough. That we require more to be satisfied. That it's not a valid substitute for what we can get in the dining hall, if only we invested the time. 
Just as it's difficult to find satisfac­tion in the shallow depths of a paper Grab 'n' Go bag, it's not easy to find love after a random hookup. Both should be taken for what they are ­convenient, easy ways to get a little something when you need a little something. 
However, similar to the dining halls, there are non-negotiable rules to be enforced when embarking on an adventure such as a random hookup. 
For example, if you've never before laid eyes on your new object of affec­tion, take note: This person will show up on every corner you pass for the rest of your collegiate career. It's a known fact. 
Also. just as waiting until the end of the day can limit your choices greatly when getting Grab 'n' Go, waiting until the end of the night to choose your new love interest can lead to choices similar

to the leftover, soggy turkey-on-rye 
option. It's always best to make these 
choices as early as possible for this 
reason, as no one likes to leave with a 
soggy sandwich. 
And please, don't make it a habit. When we forgo the dining hall alto­gether and only get Grab 'n' Go, it's simply not healthy. Eventually we become as limited in life as we are in our Grab 'n' Go choices. 
Most importantly, we can never let our emotions run high. We must recog­nize that the circumstances of a ran­dom hookup are accompanied by the consequences of one. Chalk it up to the atmosphere, the attraction or the Amstel Light, but it is important to realize that when the hooking up is over, it's not as simple to forget as a discarded Grab 'n' Go bag. lt can be ignored and disregarded, but when it comes down to it, the grabbing is easy. It's the going that can be the hard part. 
Whether it's hormone-or hunger­driven, we love the ease and conve­nience of Grab 'n' Go just as we enjoy our random hookups. Both are almost entirely non-committal. Both are almost always an option and there are always several choices. However, we may have our choice of tuna on a bun or three cheese on wheat, but in the end, do we really want either? 
After all, too much Grab 'n' Go can give you indigestion. Too many random hookups can give you quite a heartache.

porch is my libera­tion from this mun­dane life I am sup­posed to live. I am resisting the world that we are told to live in and creating my own existence: leisure. contemplation and almost a spirituality that cannot be found on a bench on campus. 
The people that I live with have discov­ered how to slow down, take time out of the day to contemplate and take in every­thing that has been happening. We sit around. relaxing, clearing our heads and joking around about everything and any­thing, talking about poverty, education and Chinese tea. We look out into the street and wave to "strangers'' who walk or ride by as we listen to music from our living room and have a good time. 
So many of us hurry about our lives, going to school for that education that will bring us financial success and there­fore happiness in our lives. 
Thinking like a busy businessperson causes us to forget about art, literature, poetry and music. We are made to think, "If it doesn't make us money, what's the use or point?" Thus, art sucks, poetry sucks, exploring essential questions about faith and the meaning of work suck. At an 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Cooperation is needed to resolve gender issues 
I can see that not much has changed since I left Notre Dame. 
Some guys still hold the stereotype that the Notre Dame women are ugly. I'm will­ing to bet there are still a lot of nasty rumors out there concerning the "virtue" of Saint Macy's girls. 
Surely. there are still cheers of "BP fat" at pep rallies. Clearly, there is a funda­mental problem with gender relations at Notre Dame. 
Simply put, the boys and girls just don't know how to play nice together. 
What are the reasons for this problem? I wish I had a simple answer. I think a big part of the problem is the forced separa­tion of the two sexes into single sex dorms, in conjunction with parietals. While I understand the University's stated reason for this is to keep the dorms from being unruly and to quiet them down so people can study and sleep, the simple fact of the matter is that it also limits the amount of interaction that occurs between the two genders. 
Not to mention that the girls' dorms are like a cell block on lockdown most of the time. IL isn't all that easy to just pop over to a girl's dorm to say hi or hang out. In most. or maybe all by now, you have to be let in and then sign in, and then sign out. I understand that this is mainly for security reasons but it also sometimes makes the girls' dorms a little oppressive to be in. 
Another problem may be the lack of true social space. While it has gotten better with the addition of Reeker's and the expansion of the Huddle, I still don't think early age, we quit seeking answers to questions about life. We settle for a quick "because," and begin to believe that we have no power over life. Poetry, art and other forms of expression disappear or are turned into lucrative gears in the 
money-making machine that runs life, "Just because ... that's how it is." 
Self-exploration ceases. Relationships with our neighbors either do not exist or are superficial. We've stopped living life to submit our­selves to various kinds of authori­tarian order of some type, and forget the simple art of sitting around and shooting the breeze.

it is enough. The University is very isolated behind its expansive grounds and gate­houses. It isn't all that easy to get off cam­pus ifyou don't have a car. Moreover, South Bend isn't the quintessential college town. 
Thus, this need for social space must be met by the University, as I think it is beyond even Notre Dame's ability to level South Bend and build the classic "college town." 
The problem could also stem from the University's strong reliance on a strict "in loco parentis" strategy of dealing with stu­dents that I felt was a little repressive dur­ing my years there. 
After all, people go to college to get away from their parents, not to inherit an administration building full of them. If you treat people like children, that's how they'll act and there seem to be a lot of children at Notre Dame right now. 
Whatever the cause, there is a big prob­lem between the genders at Notre Dame. They insult each other, they don't date (honestly, how many colleges have you heard of that have a date week?), they don't seem Lo respect one another and they don't interact in they way that people their age should interact socially. The University and the students need to put their heads together to come up with a solution to this problem. 
It's gone on for far too long already.

Birth control is not the answer 
The Notre Dame sex policy has no need for revision, whether it be in the form suggested by Ben Le Roy or not. This policy upholds an elementary Christian truth: sex is "wonderful and spiritual," as Le Roy states in his Sept. 12 letter, and it should only be undertaken within the context of marriage. 
As incredible as it may seem to some of us, the Notre Dame administration is neither stupid nor blind. They know full well their policy cannot stop stu­dents from having sex and, as such, have programs to accommodate women who do become pregnant. 
However, the solution Le Roy proposes would only aggravate the problem. Any form of birth control. condoms or pills, would actually increase the preg­nancy rate. It is the atmosphere of "safe sex" that causes people to equate "safe" with "failsafe," something birth control is not. In fact, three out of 10 condoms fail to perform correctly and pills work only 86 percent of the time. With the idea of "safe sex" in mind, more people would have sex, leading to more pregnancies, which, if one follows Le Roy, would lead to more con­doms. 
Furthermore. one might ask what happens to the 14 percent of women whose pills fail. At this point, the majority of pills (all but two or three brands) turn abortifacicnt. In other words, the pill kills the unborn child days or even hours after conception. An outright abortion seems contrary to Le Roy's "wonder and joy at the miracle of life." Chances are the woman will never even know she was pregnant. 
Finally, Notre Dame is a Catholic university, and being such should and must abide by Catholic teaching. The Catholic Church has always taught that artificial birth control is immoral. This is not a new idea, as some claim, but originated with the Apostles themselves in the Didache, circa 70 AD. Moreover, birth control is directly contrary to God's first command to mankind, "Be fruitful and multiply" (Genesis 1:28). 
Instead of hypocritical. I would call Notre Dame's sex policy Catholic: it pro­fesses a universal moral law while accepting our fallen human state. If, how­ever. Notre Dame were to follow Le Roy's proposal, the policy would be not only hypocritical, but also immoral, anti-Catholic, and anything but "safe."

looking for work. He always offers to sweep and clean our porch, cut our grass or do anything else for money, but we are always broke and can only offer a banana or an apple. We have developed a friend ship with him. We know his story and he knows ours. We are constantly meeting people, learning about their lives and their stories and in the process, building relationships. 
Being off-campus does leave us more vulnerable than living on-campus. but that is something that we want to risk. We want to open ourselves up to the neighborhood and South Bend, a city with 200,000 people -a mix of blacks. whites, Latinos, Vietnamese, Bosnians and more. Students cannot discover life from a dorm, but only from a porch, where rent is due, you owe your housemates money from the utilities last month and real stress can begin to shape you. 
Life is only a front porch away.

Arissa is about fun, but remains practical and con­cerned about her finances. Having lived in the Boston projects all of her life, Arissa hopes that "The real World" will be her ticket out of a type of life she detests. Strong-willed and deeply compas­sionate, she sens­es a deep bond with fellow cast member Irulan. 
The streetwise lrulan initially seems to be the quiet one of the bunch, but is, in fact, not afraid of asserting her place in the house. She maintains an open relationship with her boyfriend, which seems to indicate a future dilemma. She also reaches out to Arissa for friendship and the

To accommodate the cast and crew, six Palms hotel rooms were combined into one massive suite featuring three bedrooms, a communal shower with separate stalls, a bathroom and wash area, a kitchen and dining area, living area and game area. 
And, of course, there is the confessional: the isolated small room with the fixed cam­era where cast members can record their thoughts in secret ... at least, until the series airs and the confessions are brought to light. 
MTV has kept a tight lid on the plot and even the names and descriptions of the cast members and understandably so. Executives at MTV want the show's twists and turns to remain a surprise. 
But, if Tuesday's premiere episode is an indication, viewers are in for sex, partying and drama as only "The Real World" can provide it. Welcome to Sin City, USA.

NFL 
Broncos consult NFL after communication failure 
Associa.ted Press 
DENVER 

The Denver Broncos contacted the NFL on Monday about using alternative means of communication in future games after their headsets failed to work against the San Francisco 49ers. 
The Broncos usually give the plays to quarterback Brian Griese through a radio transmitter in his helmet, but the signal was crossed with one being used by emergency personnel and ushers at 49ers Stadium in San Francisco on Sunday. 
Denver had to shuttle players into the game to get the plays to Griese, and he even called a few plays of his own when tho calls didn't come in quick enough. 
Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said league officials told the team before the game that there was a problem with the frequency, but they couldn't do anything about it. San Francisco had no problems with its headsets. 
"We're going to check into it and see what type of alternatives we do have, what type of backup systems we can have," Shanahan said. "Can we change the frequency, so we can at least be able to communicate? We're working on that hard today. and hopefully we can come up a solution in the next couple of days." 
NFL spokesman Michael Signora said the officials were correct in letting the 49ers continue to use their headsets. 
-
Under rules in the NFL Operations Manual. if one team has trouble commu­nicating from the coaches' booth down to the field, the other team must not use its system. 
But the rule only applies to coaches try­ing to talk to other coaches, Signora said. 
"The coach-to-quarterback is not sub­ject to the equity rule," Signora said. "If one team experiences difficulty with the coach-to-quarterback communication, the other club does not have to shut down." 
Teams use encryption to keep their communications from being tapped into, but somehow the Broncos were getting interference on their frequency, Signora said. Denver's coaches had no trouble communicating between the booth and the field. 
Signora said officials in San Francisco are trying to determine exactly what happened and assured the league it wouldn't happen again.

NCAA FOOTBALL 
Alabama, Kentucky lose sanction appeals 
 Both schools banned from bowl appearances due to 'numerous, egregious violations' 
Associated Press 
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. 
The NCAA rejected Alabama's request that it ease sanctions against the football program on Tuesday. 
Kentucky, off to a 3-0 start this season, also lost its appeal to the NCAA. T h e Wildcats were hop­ing a bowl ban would be lifted. 
Alabama sought restoration of six scholarships and its bowl eligibility but the appeals committee upheld all the penalties imposed after the program was cited for illegal

"Through this adversity, we will move forward and become stronger than ever," athletic director Mal Moore said. 
The NCAA placed Alabama on five years' probation on Feb. 1, tacking on six scholar­ship cuts to the university's self-imposed reduction of 15, and banning the team from participating in a bowl game for two years. 
The infractions committee cited Alabama for illegal recruiting practices by boost­ers, with chairman Thomas Yeager saying the panel con­sidered the so-called "death penalty" which would shut down the program for at least one season. 
The university also contend­ed that the committee wrongly used the testimony of a secret witness in punishing "a blame­less, indeed exemplary, insti­tution."

Monday night's game between the Washington Redskins and Philadelphia Eagles was stopped briefly in the fourth quarter after police used pepper spray to break up a fight in

"Whenever you see your teammates coming out on the field and pretty much grabbing their throats or covering their nose, it's a pretty tough situa­tion," Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb said. "I've never been a part of anything like that. It's a first for me, it's probably a first for Monday night. Hopefully, it doesn't hap­pen again." 
Redskins spokesman Karl Swanson said there was a dis­turbance in the fan area a few rows up behind the Philadelphia bench. Swanson said a Prince George's County police officer intervened and that a "small amount of pep­per spray" was

Swanson initially said the offi­cer was injured, but the Redskins later released a state­ment saying that the officer was not hurt. No arrests were made. 
The smell soon dissipated. After a delay of about eight min­utes, McElwee announced that it was safe to resume the game, and the Eagles players returned to their bench. 
Philadelphia won 3 7 -7.

Associated Press 
BALTIMORE 

With the wall of bagpipes fill­ing the cathedral and his coffin covered ln white lilies and rnses, Johnny 
Unitas was remembered as "the greatest," a quarterback who made the impossible possi­ble. Before more than 2,000 relatives, fans and friends, the Hall of Farner was honored Tuesday as a leader who forev­er changed the NFL and made everyone around him better. Unitas died Wednesday of a heart attack at 69. 
Former Baltimore Colts receiver Raymond Berry, Unitas' most frequent target, told the crowd his teammate was a "once-in-a-lifetime quar­terback."

Matthews looking to play 
Associated Press 
ASHBURN, Va. 

Quarterback Shane Matthews, whose non-throw­ing shoulder was injured in the Washington Redskins' loss to Philadelphia, said Tuesday he expects he'll be able to play Sunday against San Francisco. 
Matthews bruised his left shoulder Monday night when he was hit on the final Redskins drive of the first half in the 37-7 loss. Matthews fin­ished the series, but Danny Wuerffel replaced him at the start of the second half. 
An exam Tuesday revealed nothing more serious than a bruise. 
"I plan on playing," Matthews said. "I felt like I could play the second half." 
Coach Steve Spurrier said Matthews will remain his starter if he is healthy. The coach said Matthews "may be a little limited in practice"this week. 
"We'll check his shoulder 
situation and so forth, and if he's 100 percent, Shane will still be the starter,"Spurrier I said. 
Matthews struggled against the Eagles, completing just 10 ' of 22 passes for 62 yards and one interception. The Redskins only score came on a punt return, making it the first game in which a Spurrier-coached team hasn't scored a touchdown in l 0 years. 
Wuerffel would start if Matthews can't play. Spurrier said he will give first-round draft pick Patrick Ramsey more work in practice in case the rookie has to suit up as the No. 2 quarterback. 
were in the stands or on the field," Berry said. 
Berry was joined at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen by N-FL commissioner Paul Tagllabue, Baltimore Ravens coach Brian Billick and players Ray Lewis, Peter Boulware and Michael McCrary. Also attend­ing were former Baltimore Colts teammates Art Donovan and Tom Matte, and Mayor Martin O'Malley. 
"He was mythic," Tagliabue said. "He symbolizes football, and, more importantly, he sym­bolizes leadership." 
Outside the cathedral, a small plane flew overhead with a banner that said, "Unitas We Stand" in blg red letters. Near the coffin stood a painting of Unitas walking into the distance in his No. 19 blue Colts jersey. 
Unltas' six sons were the pall­bearers. Chad Unitas choked back tears as they prepared to take the coffin out of the hearse and a bagpiper played "Edelweiss." 
"We remember the cheers 
that rang out from 33rd Street, celebrating a man in black hightop shoes," said Cardinal William Keeler, the archbishop of Baltimore, recalling Unitas' glory days at Memorial Stadium. 
"He humbly and generously dealt with everyone, whether a grandson beginning to play football or a fan seeking an autograph. He Jed and he touched others by his integrity and loyalty." 
The memorial service and funeral Mass were open to the public. The cathedral, which seats about 2,200, was filled by the time Mass began. The coffin was closed, and the body will be cremated. 
Unitas played for the Colts from 1956-72, and for the San Diego Chargers in 1973. He set 22 NFL passing records, was named MVP of the NFL three times and was selected for the Pro Bowl 10 times. He won three championships, including the overtime victory against the Giants in the 1958 NFL title game. 
"You made the impossible possible," Berry said. "Those images of your performances still haven't faded." 
Donovan added: "He was the greatest. He should get this kind of respect. He's the guy who put Baltimore on the map." 
Outside the cathedral, Ravens president David Modell said Unitas supported the new team when it came to Baltimore from Cleveland before the 1996-sea­son. 
"Johnny U. was the father of modern football, so all of us, including my father, who enjoyed participating, owe that to Johnny," Model! said. Modell's father, Art Modell, is the Ravens· owner. 
Frank Gitschier, a former coach at the University of Louisville, was the first speak­er. 
"The world has lost one of its greatest legends and all of you have lost a friend," Gitschier said. He recalled how he met

Unitas 52 years ago, when he was recruiting as an assistant coach. 
Gitschler said he was told, "This kid is tough as nails and he could really throw the ball." After he promised Unitas' mother that he would go to Mass every Sunday and would graduate, she agreed he could attend Louisville. 
"It was no great recruiting coup -we got Johnny U. because no one else wanted him," Gitschier said. 
Several of Unitas' children also spoke. Janice Unitas DeNittis said she remembered sitting on her father's lap as a little girl as they watched game film over and over. She said that after practice, her father and Berry would often run pass plays in their yard until they perfected them. 
His son Joe recalled his dad's reputation as a straightforward man, including his traditional pregame speech to his team­mates:

Wolverines don't blame Navarre for loss 
By J. BRADY McCULLOUGH 
Michigan Daily 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. 

Overthrows. batted balls and passes thrown behind receivers. These are the things most Michigan fans will remember about John Navarre's performance in the Wolverines· 25-23 loss at Notre Dame. 
But Navarre, who completed just 19-of-42 passes for 230 yards, could have completed many more with a little help from his receivers. 
In Michigan's final drive with less than two minutes to play, both Navarre and the Michigan receivers failed to make a play to win the game. 
After a nine-yard completion to fullback B. J. Askew, Navarre overthrew a wide-open Ronald Bellamy. The junior quarterback then ran for a first down to keep the drive alive. 
On the ensuing play, receiver Tyrece Butler found a hole in the Notre Dame zone, and Navarre put it right on the numbers at the Irish 35-yard line. But Butler couldn't hold onto the football, keeping the Wolverines out of field goal range. 
"As a receiver, I'm supposed to make big plays, and I didn't make big plays," Butler said. "That's what I'm here to do." 
Players were adamant that cism, receiver Braylon Navarre shouldn't receive the Edwards said. "He's played lion's share of the blame for the well this year, and even loss. (Saturday) he played pretty

Part of Willingham's desire to enter coaching came from his realization that he wasn't going to make it as a football player. He entered Michigan State in 1972 as a diminutive 5-foot-6 walk-on quarterback and never stepped on the playing field, although he earned a scholar­ship for his dedication.

he wouldn't go along with us. He never slacked off." 
Willingham also distinguished himself as a baseball player ­earning all-Big Ten honors as an outfielder in 1977 -but it was no secret to anyone that football was his favorite sport. Every Saturday, Willingham roused his roommates out of bed at 7 a.m. for early morning workouts. While his teammates shook off hangovers, Willingham -who didn't drink -ran at the front of the pack. 
"He would do anything to help us win," Rogers said. "The play­ers respected him because he wasn't kidding and he wasn't jacking around. What he was saying was solid and sound." 
Willingham can still reel off the name of the running back

converted to a wide receiver during final year with the Spartans. 
Willingham doesn't shy away from admitting his shortcomings as a football player. When asked Tuesday to describe what kind of player he was, he answered, "Terrible." Asked why he was terrible, he stoically responded, "I wasn't any good." 
But what Willingham lacked in football ability. he more than made up for in discipline, hard work and mental toughness. He carried a businesslike approach into practice, never pulling pranks, never letting his grades drop, never frustrating his coaches. 
He never backed down, either. In practice, when the Spartans ran sprints, there was an unwritten rule that players weren't supposed to run them full speed. Willingham took great pleasure in breaking that rule. 
"He expected the best," said Baggett, who was also Willingham's best friend and roommate. "He wasn't the fastest guy in the world, but he used to beat us in wind sprints. We wanted to run them at 50 percent, but he wouldn't do it, Michigan State 
game, as well. 
"I think the coaches in my time knew this was one of the big teams in the country and they always urged our team to play its best football," Willingham said. "If you didn't play it any other week, you played your best football against Notre Dame and against Michigan and against Ohio State.n 
Even after he left Michigan State, Willingham kept close tabs on his alma mater. And he is used to the barrage of ques­tions that comes with playing his former school, having coached Stanford against Michigan State in the 1996 Sun Bowl. 
Although Willingham coached against the Spartans with Stanford in the 1996 Sun Bowl, Saturday will be his first game at Spartan Stadium on the opposing sidelines. While he isn't focused on the fact that he is coaching against his alma mater, he said one thing is obvi­ous entering Saturday's game. 
"No Michigan State T-shirt this week."

In the annual polls. Notre Dame was picked to finish sev­enth by both the coaches and the media. In fact. the both polls were identical from top to bottom as both groups selected defending champion Michigan to defend its title. 
In the coaches poll, Michigan received eight of 12 first-place votes with Michigan State get­ting two and Northern Michigan and Ohio State each getting one. 
The media's poll (with 72 members of the media voting) saw Michigan get 39 first-place votes, Michigan State 22, Northern Michigan 7 and Ohio State 3. The results of both polls: 
The league also announced that it is moving the CCHA Super Six to a Thursday­Saturday format instead of the weekend. 
The CCHA also announced that the goal creases would conform to the dimensions used by the National Hockey League. 
This will ensure consistency in dimensions for all regular season, CCHA tournament and NCAA tournament games. 
The CCHA will also adopt the 15-second faceoff rule that was popularized during the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
The procedure will be in effect for all games except games with television timeouts. 
Irish head coach Dave Poulin and his staff will take to the ice at the Joyce Center for the first official practice on Thur., Sept. 26. 
Notre Dame will play its annual Blue-Gold Intrasquad game on Sunday, Sept. 29 at 4:00p.m.

FOOTBALL 
Irish avoid Holiday touchdown debate 
By KATIE McVOY Associate Spores Editor 
The replay has hit every major sports recap in the country. Quarterback Carlyle Holiday crossed the goal line in Saturday's game against Michigan and there lay the ball -on the ground. The referees signaled a touchdown. 
So the debate rages on during Spo::-ts Center and on news 
-shows, but the call was made and Notre Dame earned six points. "I took a pretty solid hit on that play," Holiday said. "I mean. we haven't really gone over it; we just watched it on film. If it wasn't a touchdown, the team sure showed emotion like it was. There was no reac­tion on the Michigan side." Irish coach Tyrone Willingham isn't dwelling on the play either. "I think you could probably go the other way and say that Ryan Grant was a touchdown," Willingham said. " ... I don't spend much time on either one of those." With the NFL adopting an instant replay, effective officiat­ing has come into the spotlight. Rehashing penalties and fumble calls is as common an after­game activity as reliving the game-winning touchdown. A possible missed calls always bring up the idea of instant replay in college football. "I think it's prohibitive because of the cost to all of the teams around the country," Willingham said. " ... At the same time, I'm a fan of the human fac­tor, okay. I think that's what makes autumn so interesting." 
Shane's Fame 
Senior cornerback Shane Walton was named the Bronko Nagurski National Defensive Player of the week following the Irish victory against Michigan. Walton, who had the game-end­ing interception, had a career­high eight tackles, forced a fum­ble and recovered another. 
Walton made a key play with less than three minutes to go in the third quarter when he broke up Michigan quarterback John Navarre's pass for an attempted two-point conversion.

Walton's interception on Saturday raised his season total to four. He intercepted Maryland three times in the Kickoff Classic on Aug. 30, tying an Irish record for interceptions in a single game. His average of 1.33 inter­ceptions per game leads the nation. And teams keep throw­ing at rum. 
"I think people want to chal­lenge [Walton]," defensive coor­dinator Kent Baer said. "They look at his size and they don't believe he's really as good as he is. And that's all right. They go after the best part of our defense, him and Vontez Duff, and if they want to continue to do that they can go right ahead." 
Closing the gate on the defense 
During Nicholas Setta's point after attempt against Michigan, Willingham swung the gate on the Wolverine defense. The Irish defense lined up on one hash mark and, right before the kick occurred.shifted. 
"The whole process is really two things," Willingham said. "Hopefully you would like to get an easy score from a two-point play, hopefully they fall asleep ... Then the other one is that if you have a team that is very adept at rushing your kicks, that move­ment may be a little unsettling." 
Color-blind? 
When Tyrone Willingham faces off against Bobby Williams on Saturday, it will be the first time the first African-American coach in Notre Dame history faces another African-American coach on the opposing team. Although Willingham refused to let his race be the focus of his hiring at Notre Dame, he recog­nizes the importance of Saturday's game. 
"I think I've put it in the per­spective of what I view it, which may be less than others look at it," he said. "But I think I consis­tently said that my situation here at Notre Dame, the fact that two coaches of African-American decent will go against each other is significant. But it also points to a shortcoming in our system, and that is disappointing."
