Professor explains return of indulgenCES 
By ROBERT SINGER News Writer 
Notre Dame is no stranger to Catholic tradition, but the renewed focus on the age-old practice of indulgences has eluded or confused many on campus. · 
A recent article in The New York Times said dioceses around the world are bringing back the tradition of offering indulgences, which lessen the time one spends in purgatory before entering heaven, according to Church doctrine. 
Theology professor Richard McBrien said was practiced at its peak from the Middle Ages to just before the Second Vatican Council. 
"An indulgence is the par­tial or full remission of spiri­tual penalties, or punish­ments, which still apply to sins that have already been forgiven," he said. 
Even though these sins have been forgiven, they still stand to be punished in tl'lH afterlife and acquiring an indulgence would provide some level of pardon from the conse­quences, according to McBrien. 
"A partial indulgence would remit some of those penalties; a plenary indulgence would remit all of those penalties ­at least until the person on earth committed another sin before death," he said. "Then

Support the Stache 
You may have noticed recently an influx of facial hair among some of your more outstanding classmates. 
And by outstanding, I mean the wonderful men of Dillon Hall, because next weekend marks the one of a kind Stache Bash. 
For those of you who don't know, the Stache Bash serves two purpos­es, the first of which is to show off the diverse and plentiful types of facial hair. So for those ladies lucky enough to be 
Jay Fitzpatrick
invited to this dance to end all dances, I present Managing the Moustaches of Editor the World. 
+ 
The Walrus (goo-goo-ga-joob): Most well-known as .the stache of Josef Stalin choice of former Notre Dame offensive line coach John Latina, the Walrus is most distin­guishable by it's sheer, unabashed bushiness. Providing a thick layer of fur to the upper lip, this stache demonstrates pure strength. 

+ 
The Fu Man Chu: This stache is most popular in the Far East, and is commonly seen on modern depic­tions of the Chinese philosopher Confucius. It takes great skill and concentration (not to mention amaz­ing connectors) to pull off this look, as the purest state of this stache hangs a good inch ofT of your face. 

+ 
The Classic Handlebar: An American variation of the Fu Manchu, this stache is best worn on bikers and Hulk Hogan. Promising onlookers doom for messing with the wearer of this stache, the Handlebar announces its presence with authori­ty at even the slightest glance. 


+The Chester Alan Arthur: Named for the 21st President, the CAA com­bines two great facial hair tradi­tions, the Walrus and the Mutton Chop. With seamless chin-connec­tions between the sideburn and the upper lip, this should only be attempted by the most brazen of men. 
+ The Common Crustache: Likely the most common type of facial hair on campus, this is the stache of choice for those who forgot to stop shaving weeks ago or freshmen who can't grow moustaches yet (Maybe one day, Tony}. Either way it's the thought that counts, and there's no such thing as a bad stache. 
But the second -and most impor­tant -purpose of the Stache Bash is to support the Center for the Homeless here in South Bend. The incredibly cold winter has sapped the operating budget of the Cent_er, and in fact it is over $45,000 over budget for this year. 
Each man of Dillon has a pledge sheet for their moustache, and we are asking for donations to support the Center. Dillon has already col­lected $900 on our own and we are asking for your help. 
Donations can be either in a lump sum or a certain amount per day (like a fun run, but more fun because it is with facial hair). 
And if you don't give, in the fight against homelessness, you are on the side of homelessness.

Pulte, Kimberly compete for top spots in Class of 2011 

By MADELINE BUCKLEY and LIZ O'DONNELL News Writers 
Putte-ShineStayoi&Castellini 
Junior class council presidential candidate Caitlin Pulte said her ticket presents feasible and well­researched platform ideas that will benefit the junior class. 
Pulte is running with Henry Shine, candidate for vice president, Luke Stavole, for secretary and Tim Castellini, for treasurer. 
The ticket promises a CEO lec­ture series, a class trip to see a Cubs game, a poker tournament at Legends, a class rosary and a weekly raffie, Pulte said. 
"Our platform is completely fea­sible," she said. "We have talked to all the sources we need to make sure all the ideas are possible." 
Pulte said the CEO lecture series will have the biggest impact on stu­dents. 
"A., we become juniors, we will be looking tor jobs," she said. "Not everyone's sure what they want to do, so different CEOs talking about difl'erent professions will really help us figure out what to do with our lives." 
Pulte said the ticket's biggest strength is experience and dedica­tion. She added that she will give up studying abroad next year to lead the cla'i..'i. 
Currently, Pulte is the sophomore class social chair. Shine is a Student International Business Council (SIBC) consultant, and 
Stavole and Castellini are members 
of the Sophomore Oass Council. 
Kimberly-Doyle-Fernandez­
Roseberry 

Junior class council presidential candidate Kevin Kimberly said he and his running mates decided to run to make class council more interactive. 
Their campajgn is focused around four large initiatives, including a Community Service Database -which would allow service to be done in South Bend on a regular basi., -and a Study Abroad Transition Program. 
The transition program would offer a series of send-otis and re­orientations to help student., accli­mate to their surroundings abroad. 
Other ideas include a class retreat and a clas..s bracket to pre­dict March Madness winners in the NCAA basketball tournament. 
Kimberly said the team also hopes to start Cla'is Masses at the Grotto as well as "The Environmental Initiative" which would provide for the Class of 2011 to become more involved with campus efforts to go green. 
"We are very excited to have this opportunity to run to make next · year's class council truly one that serves our class and not our­selves," Kimberly said.

candidate for sophomore class 
council (SCC), said the ticket, 
comprised of four members of 
the current freshman class 
council, is running on the plat­
form of "experience and inno­

"For us, the big one is experi­

process works and knowing

Presidential candidate 
Catherine Soler said she wants 
to plan events like class trips to 
a water park trip or Cedar 
Point, a class tailgate and a 
poker tournament. 

Other ideas include using the class Web site to form studying groups and class yoga and pilate sessions to help ease stu­dents' stress. 
The ticket also plans to have town-hall style meetings once or twice a month in which stu­dents can give feedback on what is and isn't working, Soler said. 
Responding to criticism that the current freshman class council is an exclusive clique, Soler said it is a "misconcep­tion" and that her ticket wants 
to ··connect with a wider range ofpeople than this year."

Seniors have choice of three calllpaigns 
By SARAH MERVOSH and LIZ O'DONNELL-News Writers 
Harmon-Kinsey-Bell-Hamill 
Christina Harmon, senior class presidential candidate, said her ticket has an innova­tive and unique platform. 
"We believe our platform differentiates us from our competition from being the first ticket to think of a Senior Class Ball to the Class of 2010 Bar Crawl to the necessitv of increased com­munication and accessibility of class officers," she said. 
The Senior Ball, one of the campaign's top initiatives, would take place in Chicago. Other activities included in their platform are a revamped senior day at a home football game, office hours for the president in the class office, a Speakers' Forum Series and a revival of the 2010 website. 
"It is our hope that people are excited about what we intend to plan if elected," said Harmon. 
In addition to these plat­
forms, the team said it will also try to have a class of 2010 market place at the end of the school year for stu­dents to sell excess furniture and goods that they have bought to furnish their dorms and apartments. 
Harmon said the team is ready to assume the respon­sibility for serving a sixth term after graduation in order to plan the fifth year reunion and other activities. 
"We know our basic obliga­tions as class officers and we want to go above and beyond to give our class the best and most memorable senior year," Harmon said. 
TIllett-Hwang-Molloy­Trousdale 
The 2010 ticket of Chris Tillett, Joy Hwang, Elli Trousdale, and Matt Molloy has broken their campaign platforms down into three phases: tradition, transition, and innovation. 
"What this translates to is that we want to accomplish the t h in g_~ t h at the s e n i o r class has always done." said Tillett, the ticket's presiden­
tial candidate. "We want to put our own spin on next year as well." 
The campaign plans to con­tinue the annual senior year activities includiqg Senior Week, Margaritaville, and

wants to focus on preparing the class of 2010 to enter the real world. They will provide instruction on taking care of everyday issues such as filing taxes, taking out loans, keep­ing track of personal finances and learning to cook. 

The final section of the campaign, the innovative phase, "revolves around the distinct opportunities that we hope to provide to make our senior year particularly memorably," Tillett said. 
These activities include a "One Hundred Days Dinner", Barbeque Tailgate Cook-off,

Bishop ordered out of Argentina 
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -The tradi­
tionalist bishop whose denials of the 
Holocaust embarrassed the Vatican was 
ordered Thursday to leave Argentina with­
in 10 days. 
The Interior Ministry said it had ordered Richard Williamson out of Argentina because he'had failed to declare his true job as director of a seminary on immigra­tion forms and because his comments on the Holocaust "profoundly insult Argentine society, the Jewish community and all of humanity by denying a historic truth." 
Williamson's views created an uproar last month when Pope Benedict XVI lifted his excommunication and that of three other bishops consecrated by the late Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre as part of a process meant to heal a rift with ultracon­servatives.

Khalid Al-Jawary, 63, was released from the Supermax maximum-security prison in Florence, Colo., said Carl Rusnok, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman. Rusnok said a federal immi­gration judge had signed a de-portation order for Al-Jawary.

The decisive 60-39 vote was in the House of Delegates, dominated by Republicans who have battled tobacco restrictions for years. The Senate earlier voted 27-13 for the bill, which now heads to Gov. Timothy

Nine-year-old accepts plea bargain

ST. JOHNS, Ariz. -A 9­
year-old boy accused of 
methodically shooting his 
father and his father's 
roommate to death last 
fall pleaded guilty 
Thursday to one count of 
negligent homicide, set­
tling the case that shocked 
and mystified the nation. 
Under a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty in the death of the roommate and charges of premedi­tated murder for both deaths were dropped. Police said the boy used a .22-caliber rifle to shoot the men as they returned home from work Nov. 5. 
The boy's plea spares the rural community of about 4,000 from what would have been an emo­tional trial and prevents the boy from serving time in the state juvenile cor­rections system or being tried as an adult. 
He was polite in court and was never asked about to explain any motive for the killings.

Burrisloses support ofblack ministers 
Ill. junior senator face~ requests for resignation after accusations of questionable finances 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -A group of black ministers who support­ed U.S. Sen. Roland Burris as he fought to get his job now plan to ask for his resigna­tion following revelations that he tried to raise money for the disgraced governor who appointed him, one of the ministers told The 
--Associated Press on Thursday. Many of the city's influen­tial black pastors supported Burris because of his scan­dal-free reputation -even though he was appointed by then-Gov. Rod Blagojevich three weeks after the gover­nor was arrested for alleged­ly trying to sell the Senate seat. 
Now some of those pastors will ask Burris to resign, according to the minister, who spoke on condition of anonymity because a meeting with Burris had not yet been scheduled. 
Clergy Speaks Interdenominational, an umbrella group that includes hundreds of Chic_ago's black churches, will meet Friday to discuss its support for Burris, spokeswoman Stephanie Gadlin said. For now, the group still supports_ him and its. leaders are unaware of discussions about asking him to resign, she said.

O'Connor would not say whether the senator would meet with ministers and referred to a statement from Burris asking that leaders "stop the rush to judgment." 
Burris testified before the Illinois House committee that recommended Blagojevich's impeachment in January that he hadn't had contact with key Blagojevich staffers or offered anything in return for the Senate seat vacated by President Barack Obama. 
Last weekend, however, Burris released an affidavit saying he had spoken to sev­eral Blagojevich advisers, including Robert Blagojevich, the former governor's broth­er and finance chairman, who Burris said called three times last fall asking for fundraising help. Burris, a former state attorney gener­al, changed his story again this week when he admitted trying, unsuccessfully, to raise money for Blagojevich. 
Illinois lawmakers have asked local prosecutors to look into perjury charges, and a preliminary U.S. Senate Ethics Committee inquiry is under way. Burris denies lying under oath and has resisted a growing cho­rus of calls for his resigna­tion, including from within his own party. 
Burris is, like Obama was, the only black U.S. senator. 
Current sentiment in the 
-black community is not unan­
imous, but the clergy's 
silence as the maelstrom of 
criticism swells around 
Burris "speaks volumes," 
said another minister, Ira 
Acree, of the Greater St. 
John Bible Church. 
''I'm a little disturbed, but 
because of his track record, 
don't want to rush to judg­
ment," Acree said Thursday. 
"But neither will I attempt to 
defend his actions." 
Blagojevich publicly turned 
to black ministers in times of 
trouble, welcoming a group 
that included Acree to his 
home for private prayer 
shortly after his Dec. 9 arrest 
on federal corruption 
charges. 
Even before the U.S. Senate 
appointment became 
embroiled in controversy, 
Burris trumpeted clergy sup­
port, telling the AP on Nov. 5 
that a half-dozen black min­
isters from Chicago had 
approached him to see if he 
was interested in the job. 
After Blagojevich named 
him to the -seat, Burris 
appeared at a New Covenant 
Church service, where sup­
porters including U.S. Rep. 
Bobby Rush and about 60 
ministers condemned Senate 
Democratic leaders for ini­
tially rejecting Burris. , Burris' latest revelations 
are "making the black com­
munity just as suspicious of 
him as anyone else," said the Rev. Leonard Barr of Fellowship Missionary Baptist Church. 
But Burris deserves a chance to defend himself and should not step down, he said. 
"I think he can do the job," Barr sa'id. "He would be a good senator and a conscien­tious senator." 
People who have supported Burris are torn between feel­ings of anger and betrayal and a desire to keep the only black senator in the country, said Laura S. Washington, a politics professor at DePaul University and columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times. 
"They're disappointed, embarrassed and worried that the seat will be in jeop­ardy," Washington said. 
Edward Bogan, a 58-year­old printer from Chicago, said he doesn't buy Burris' explanation for not telling the House impeachment com­mittee about all his contacts with the Blagojevich adminis­tration. 
"If your memory is that bad, why do we need you in there?" ·said Bogan, who is black. " ... If you're only going to remember the part that benefits you, what good are you?" 
But Chicago resident and real estate counselor Danyelle Hall, 37, says plenty of African-Americans still support Burris.

IN BRIEF 
FBI tracks down wanted financier 
WASHINGTON -Texas financier R. Allen Stanford was tracked down Thursday in Virginia, where FBI agents served him with legal papers in a multibillion-dollar fraud case. 
FBI agents, acting at the request of the Securities and Exchange Commission. served Stanford court orders and other documenl'i, the FBI and the SEC said. 
Stanford is not under arrest and is not in cus­
tody. 
In a civil complaint Tuesday, the SEC accused Stanford, two other executives and three of his companies with committing an $8 billion fraud that lured investors with promises of improbable and unsubstantiated high returns on certificates of deposit and other investments. It's not clear how much of the $8 billion was lost and how much investors might recover. · 
Lawsuit seeks identities of tax cheats 
WASHINGTON -A government lawsuit Thursday seeks the identities of tens of thousands of possible U.S. tax cheats who hid billions of dollars in assets at the Swiss­based bank UBS AG. A defiant Swiss presi­dent pledged to maintain his country's bank secrecy laws. 
In the suit filed in Miami, the Obama 
administration wants UBS to turn over 
information on as many as 52,000 U.S. cus­
tomers who concealed their accounts from 
the U.S. government in violation of tax 
laws. 
"At a time when millions of Americans are 
losing their jobs, their homes, and their 
health care, it is appalling that more than 
50,000 of the wealthiest among us have 
actively sought to evade their civil and legal 
duty to pay taxes," the acting assistant 
attorney general, John DiCicco, said in a 
statement. 
A deal announced Wednesday provides 
access to about 250 to 300 UBS customers 
who used Swiss bank secrecy laws to hide 
assets. 
To avoid prosecution, UBS agreed to pay 
$780 million, which Justice Department 
officials said was the largest ever in a crim­
inal tax case.

Mexico: Exodus of migrants decreases 

Associated Press 
MEXICO CITY -Migration from Mexico, mainly to the United States, has fallen dra­matically as fewer Mexicans leave their country to look for work abroad amid a global economic downturn, the gov­ernment said Thursday. 
The net outflow of Mexicans -both legal and illegal ­declined by over 50 percent in the 12 months ending in August 2008, compared the same period a year earlier, said the Eduardo Sojo, presi­dent of the board of Mexico's National Statistics, Geography and Information Institute. 
Sojo attributed the net drop in migration to tough econom­ic conditions abroad motivat­ing Mexicans to stay at home, rather than Mexicans in other countries returning to their homeland. 
"There is declining tendency of people going abroad, but we have not detected, up to now, any increase in people returning to the country," Sojo said. 
Sojo also said a recent sur­vey of "leading indicators" suggests that the number of Mexicans planning to emigrate in the future is also dropping. lie did not provide details of that survey · 
He said the net outflow of Mexicans -those leaving the country minus those returning from abroad -dropped to 204,000 people between August 2007 and August 2008. That was down from 455,000 for the year ending in August 2007. 
The number of returning Mexicans was roughly the same over the two periods, declining slightly to 450,000 by late 2008, from 478,000 in the 2007 period. 

But the number leaving Mexico fell sharply to 654,000 from 933,000. 
The government has said in past years that a majority who leave are undocumented migrants. Its figures are esti­mates based on quarterly sur­veys of Mexican households carried out by the institute. 
A government survey also shows the number of house­holds in Mexico that receive remittances -the money sent home by Mexicans working abroad, the vast majority in the United States -has also fallen to 1.16 million in 2008 from 1.41 million in 2005, Sojo said. 
Remittances, Mexico's sec­ond-largest source of foreign income after oil, plunged 3.6 percent to $25 billion in 2008 compared to $26 billion for the previous year, according to the country's central bank. 
Despite anecdotal reports of migrants returning to Mexico because of the downturn in the U.S. economy and con­struction sector, experts say the new statistics confirm there has been no large-scale homecoming in Mexico. An estimated 11.8 million Mexicans now live in the U.S. 
"The majority of those who are there are in a family unit, they have relatives there. We know some have children who are in school, some of whom are U.S. citizens," said Agustin Escobar, an analyst with the Center for Investigations and Superior Studies in Social Anthropology. "There are a lot of reasons for them not to leave." 
"They are going to look for other more temporary or more precarious jobs, or rely on their relatives ... rather than just disappear from the UnitPd States," he said. 


Anti-Arab leader endorses Israeli premier candidate 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM -Benjamin Netanyahu won the endorse­ment Thursday of an anti­Arab politician who emerged from Israel's election as a kingmaker, virtually ensur­ing t]lat the hawkish, U.S.­educated politician will once again become prime minis­ter. 
The big question is whether Netanyahu will be able to build the broad co ali­tion he will likely need to stay in power and avoid clashing with the Obama administration and much of the world. 
With his top rival, centrist Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, signaling that she would enter the opposition, Netanyahu 's prospects for such a coalition do not look good. He will probably have little choice but to forge a coalition with nationalist and religious parties opposed to peacemaking with the Palestinians and Israel's other Arab neighbors. 
One major Orthodox Jewish party, Shas, also threw its support to Netanyahu, joining a group of similar movements that did the same. 
"Today the foundations were laid for an extremist right-wing government under the leadership of Netanyahu," Livni said in a text message to 80,000 members of her Kadima Party. "That is not our way and there is nothing for us in such a government. .. We must be an alternative of hope and go into opposi­tion." 
If Livni stays out of Netanyahu's government, it would almost surely hurt Netanyahu's credibility with the United States and Europe. And his hold on power would be more tenu­ous in a narrow coalition of rightists, with hard-line allies threatening to bring down his government in the face of any concession for peace. 
Livni seeks a negotiated settlement with the Palestinians, a position sup­ported by the Obama admin­istration, while Netanyahu's partner on the right, Avigdor Lieberman, has drawn opprobrium with his call for Israel's 1 million Arabs to swear allegiance to the Jewish state or lose their cit­izenship. 
Israel's ceremonial presi­dent, Shimon Peres, held talks with political parties before choosing a candidate to form a government. Peres is scheduled to meet sepa­rately Friday with Netanyahu and Livni, and is likely to make his choice over the weekend, the daily newspaper Haaretz report­
ed. If he names Netanyahu, as seems likely, then Netanyahu will have six weeks to create a coalition. 
Israeli Army Radio report­ed Thursday night that if tasked by Peres, Netanyahu would immediately invite Livni and Labor leader Ehud Barak to join him in govern­ment. 
"In light of the great chal­lenges which Israel faces ­Iran, terrorism, the econom­ic crisis and job losses -a national unity government is the order of the hour," the station's Web site quoted him as saying. 
Netanyahu aides could not be reached for comment. 
Barak, himself a former premier, has already said he will take the center-left Labor Party into opposition. 
Livni has said she will not join Netanyahu unless she can be an equal partner, presumably through the sort of "rotation" agreement Israel has tried in the past in which an election's top two winners each get to be prime minister for two years. 
One reason that a rightist government could be unsta­ble is that Lieberman's secu­lar agenda puts him squarely at odds with religious par­ties, such as Shas, clouding 
. prospects. Also Thursday, Sen. John 
Kerry, 0-Mass., traveled to the Gaza Strip, the highest­level visit by a U.S. official since the Hamas militant group seized power in the territory nearly two years ago. He did not meet with anyone from Hamas, which the U.S. shuns as a terrorist group, and used the visit to urge the group to end its vio­lence against Israel. 
Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu (Israel is Our Home) Party finished third in the Feb. 10 eleetion, after Kadima and Netanyahu's Likud Party. That essentially allowed him to determine whether Nctanyahu or Livni would be able to muster the backing of a majority in the 120-seat Knesset, or parlia­ment. 
Lieberman's stance toward Arabs has exposed him to charges of racism, and many see him as a far-right extremist. However, he is opposed to the Orthodox Jewish establishment's con­trol over key aspects of pub­lic life in Israel, one of sev­eral positions that has enabled him to find common ground with moderates. 
While announcing support for Netanyahu, Lieberman said he preferred a national unity government that included Livni over a narrow coalition of right wingers.

Lawmakers pass large tax increase 
Associated Press 
SACRAMENTO -California lawmakers passed a massive tax increase Thursday along with making billions in spend­ing cuts, ending a grueling week of negotiations over clos­ing the state's $42 billion budget deficit. 
The package of bills was sent to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger after the early-morning votes in the Assembly and Senate, and the Republican governor was scheduled to sign it Friday. 
Schwarzenegger called the Legislature's work courageous, noting that Democrats com­promised on their opposition to deep spending cuts and some Republican lawmakers set aside their opposition to tax increases. 
"Now, instead of worrying every day only about IOUs and about red ink, we can start moving California forward once again," he said. "This action to solve our $42 billion deficit was difficult but coura­geous and just what California needs." 
Both houses of the Legislature got the bare mtm­m urn of votes to reach the two-thirds requirement need­ed to pass the package, which _ includes $12.8 billion in tax hikes, $15.1 billion in cuts, bil­lions in borrowing and meas­ures intended to stimulate the state's economy. 
·If the economy doesn't wors­en considerably, the plan is intended to balance the state's budget through June 2010. The Senate began debating before dawn Thursday after a moderate Republican, Sen. Abel Maldonado of Santa Maria, agreed to provide the final vote. 
In exchange, he won major concessions from Democrats and the governor. Maldonado was able to strip out a 12 cent­a-gallon gas tax from an earli­er version of the package and have two measures placed on a future ballot: One seeks fully open primary elections and another would freeze lawmak­ers' pay when the state runs a deficit. He also got $1 million for office furniture in the con­troller's office deleted. 

RUSSIA 
Juryacquits for journalist's murder 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -· A jury in Moscow voted unanimously Thursday to acquit three men in the killing ofjournalist Anna Politkovskaya, dimming hopes for justice in a case that has mocked Russia's claims to be a modern democratic nation. 
The brazen 2006 slaying of the crusading investigative reporter sent a grim signal to other dissenters in Russia, proving that even the most prominent of Kremlin critics could be murdered with impunity. 
And it provoked internation­al outrage, raising suspicions that her death was ordered by prominent public officials. 
A jury acquitted two Chechen brothers and a morose ex-cop following a trial that defense attorneys and Politkovskaya' s supporters said was marred by prosecu­tion errors and oversights. 
All three were suspected of playing minor roles in the killing. A suspected trigger­man, a third brother, has not been found. 
Politkovskaya was shot five times in the elevator of her central Moscow apartment building on Oct. 7, 2006, after a trip to the supermarket. 
In her articles, Politkovskaya had attacked some of Russia's most powerful political lead­ers. She was a ferocious critic of former president and cur­rent Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, on whose birthday the 48-year-old journalist was slain. In one book, she ac(.~used him of crushing dissent and leading a "failing democracy." 
She had also accused the regime of Ramzan Kadyrov, a 
former militia leader and now 
president of the Russian region 
of Chechnya, of torture and 
corruption, charges that he 
has denied. 
During the trial, 
Politkovskaya's colleagues and 
family said, prosecutors put 
together a feeble case -never 
bothering to offer a formal the­
ory of who might have paid for 
the suspected contract slaying, 
or why. 
Now those close to 
Politkovskaya fear they will 
never see justice done. 
Sergei Sokolov, one of Politkovskaya's editors at the opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta, said the verdicts could make it harder to pressure low-level plotters to testify against organizers. 
Now, he said, he feared authorities would "catch the first few homeless people they see, label them guilty and dose · the cas~." 
Politkovskaya's two adult children absorbed the verdict with sadness and resignation. 
"To say I'm disappointed -I can't really say that, because I was ready for such a verdict," said Ilya Politkovsky, th~ jour­nalist's son. 
Karinna Moskalenko, a prominent lawyer who repre­sented Politkovskaya's family during proceedings. sought to keep the pressure on authori­ties to continue pursuing the case. 
"Everything is still ahead ­the investigators now have to start a proper investigation," 
she said. "The more time goes by, thn harder it gets." . She said the Chechen presi-· dent Kadyrov should have tes­tified during the trial, because his name came up frequently 
in case reports and interviews 
with witnesses. But she said he 
was never questioned by inves­
tigators. 
Prosecutor Vera 
Pashkovskaya vowed to 
appeal, saying the judge had 
committed numerous proce­
dural violations. 
Not guilty verdicts are often reversed by Russia's higher courts. But it is hard to predict what will happen in this politi­cally explosive case. 
In the ensuing investigation, prosecutors and investigators appeared to stumble on sever­al occasions. Authorities made unusually detailed statements about the case in the press last year -statements that may have prompted the alleged triggerman to flee. 
The defendants included two brothers, Dzhabrail and Ibragim Makhmudov, both eth­nic Chechens, as well as for­mer Moscow police officer Sergei Khadzhikurbanov. 
Relatives of the Makhmudovs clapped and cheered when the forewoman announced the verdicts. 
"Thank God, thank the jury," said Dzhabrail Makhmudov, while still confined to a metal courtroom cage. "There was no other possible outcome." 
After the judge said the defendants were free to go, they burst out of the cage and embraced relatives. 
"We're glad," said defense lawyer Murad Musayev. "This is something that happens rarely in Russia. This is what I call j ustiee." 
In final arguments Tuesday. Musayev accused the prosecu­tion of fabricating evidence and dismissed their case as 
"dust, fluff and ash."

The one-to-two page itineraries offer tips on transportation options, where to eat and sleep for cheap and where to find the best nightlife destina­tions. Most of the itineraries are· geared for weekend trips. 
Want to spend a few days in Dublin? Steves recommends taking discount airlines RyanAir or AerLingus. Stay at Paddy's Palace hostel and take advantage of their free airport shuttle service. 
Steves wasn't impressed with Irish food: "FYI, black pudding is fried blood. Just a heads up," he writes on the itinerary. Walk 20 minutes from the city center to the Guinness Brewery, and "have a pint of the black stuff' in its Gravity Bar. The Irish Museum of Modern Art is worth seeing too, he writes. 
And if students are in search of enjoyment, they should head to the Temple Bar area. 
Steves said the site is meant to be a collaborative effort. He wants students who have spent time in European cities to e-mail him with tips on places to grab lunch or hostels at which students can stay. 
Growing up as the son of a well-known European travel guide writer, Steves spent every summer touring the con­tinent. But when he was younger, he didn't enjoy the experience.

"We've also added a Rosary blessing in disguise." 
"J didn't realize how unique it was," he said. "It was just something (did very summer." 
He went to Europe without his parents for ihe first time after he graduated from high school. Along with his best friend, he traveled the conti­nent, stopping in cities like Amsterdam, Paris, Madrid, Barcelona, Nice, Switzerland, Rome, Sicily and Florence. 
It was an experience that turned him into an enthusias­tic world traveler. 
"It just opened up a com­pletely new continent to me, because you could do what you want, you could see what you wanted when you wanted to do it," he said. 
During the spring semester of his junior year, Steves, an industrial design and Italian major, went to Rome. He book­ended his semester with 10 days in Prague, followed by a week on a 40-foot sailboat with five friends in Greece, a week in Istanbul and trips to Switzerland and Dublin. 
During his semester in Rome, he realized there was not much advice available for college students about how to find food and lodging to fit a college budget. 
"I realized at least half [the Notre Dame students in Rome] had brand new passports, never once used, so it was their first time abroad, let alone out of the country in sev­eral instances, so they would come to me and ask advice about how to get to different places," he said. "I saw a huge void where there's no informa­tion geared specifically to the college student abroad." 
Steves has posted itineraries, blog entries and photos for 
cities including Rome, Paris, Stockholm, Milan and London. He's working on creating a forum for visitors to discuss their travel experiences and trade questions and advice. He

On Saturday, workshops and receptions will take place in the dif­ferent colleges to give parents a chance to meet professors, Hendricks said. 
"I know that the College of Science is doing interactive labs and [parent<>] can see the faeilities and · such," Hendricks said. 
Additionally, each hall will host a luncheon on Saturday for juniors and parents on Saturday, Hendricks said. 
Parents can enjoy some enter­tainment from Harmonia, The Undertones and Unchained Melodies in the Hospitality Room of LaFortune on Saturday from 2:00 
p.m. to 3:00p.m., Hendricks said. 
The Student Union Board [SUB] has also planned entertainment for students and parents during the weekend. 
Second City, the Chicago-based improv comedy group, will perform in Washington Hall at 6:30 p.m. and 
9:30 p.m. tonight, SUB Manager Pat Gartland said. Students and parents can purchase tickets and attend.

also has a Facebook group to 
draw attention to the site. 
When students study abroad, 
they have a limited number of 
weekends in which to visit 
other places in Europe, Steves 
said. 
"Every weekend is an oppor­
tunity, but also there is a lot of 
pressure to make the most of 
your time everywhere," he 
said. 
The pictures and descrip­
tions of activities to do and 
sights to see should help col­
lege students decide which 
destinations to visit while in . Europe. 
The site won the Colombo Award, which is granted to "outstanding person in the tourist sector" by an Italian tourism association earlier this year. Steves has been in con­tact with Notre Dame's International Studies office, as well as programs at colleges around the country, to pro­mote his site. 
Everything on the site is free, but Steves is exploring business opportunities to expand the itineraries into tour packages for college stu­dents. 
Traveling is something that has been a part of Steves' life from the start, he said, and his philosophy is that traveling opens people up to accepting and respecting other cultures and beliefs. 
"With understanding, you decrease the fear of other cul­tures and other people and other countries," he said. "Traveling, not just in Europe, but traveling all ·over the world, is important to under­standing these people, and with an understanding that me, a 21-year-old in Iran, a 21-year-old in Japan, and one in Argentina, are all just chil­dren of God, people of the earth."

Indulgences have long been available and their return doesn't represent a change in policy so much as a shift in 
focus. One theo­ry states that more bishops are promoting indulgences as more lay people seek them because of a growing hunger to understand the meaning of sin and repen­tance in modern society. 
On the surface, this trend also appears to con­firm what many view as Pope Benedict XVI 's

"The Pope generally wants to remind Catholics that some devotional elements and prac­tices of the pre-Vatican II Church are still with us and that Catholics who wish to do so can still avail themselves of the spiritual benefits accruing from these devotions and practices," McBrien said. "The rest of the Church, however, is free to ignore them." 
Although the Pope's motiva­tions are unclear, McBrien said that the bishops who are pushing the indulgences could have a specific goal in mind. 
"In my opinion -and it is only that -those bishops who wish to. emphasize indulgences once more are concerned with the diminishing of clerical authority in recent years," he said. "This may be an attempt on their part to reassert cleri­cal. and especially episcopal,

When asked if he thought the renewed tradition would distract people from the church's ministry, McBrien said, "no, because most Catholics will pay no attention to them, and those Catholics who are involved in social jus­tice ministries will continue to be involved, without reference to the renewed attention to indulgences."

The city has funded the con­
struction of Ignition Park, 
which spans about 85 acres 
and would complement the 
work of Innovation Park by tak­
ing the research when it grows 
too large for the original Park. 
"I think the next phase in our city's growth will be to be a ris­ing center of creativity, innova­tion and commercialization," Luecke said. "Innovation and Ignition Park will show people how to take ideas and make

the community and create jobs 
and investments here."

Food gripes 
Notre Dame's dining options, while a step ahead of other schools, leave something to be desired. 
The fixes require only effort, not a massive overhaul of the system. The dining halls present plenty of options for stu­dents to choose from, but they often lump them on the same nights and go weeks without bringing them back. Students have a multitude of choices outside of the dining hall, such as Subway, but the lack of participa"tion in nationwide sales events detracts from the experience. Finally, some of the blame falls on students: they gum up the works in the dining hall and prolong the dining experience. 
We believe simple steps will solve these problems. Not a Chipotle on campus or brand­new food in the dining halls, but small TilE

First, the dining hall: it's not hard to see which foods attract the most students. The lines for peppered flank steak and General Tso's chicken demonstrate the level of demand. And more often than not, when the dining hall introduces a new option, it gets a good response. Same with the cookies at lunch and cinnamon rolls. 
So why serve some of these items on the same night? Asking someone to choose between the General and shrimp poppers just isn't fair. Serving six-cheese sachattini and chicken fingers also asks for too much of a decision. 
Once the great items have been served, they disappear for weeks, and we're left with roast top round of beef for six days straight and the rest of the dining hall food that's there every day. 
Spacing out the good stuff makes sense. If it was offered every day, it wouldn't be special. But space out the good meals between themselves as well, so there are solid options

Comments

with the calm of Easter Saturday. 
Imagine that Easter was behind us, Lent has just begun, but Fat Tuesday is still more than six weeks away. Would our mental preparation and attempts to purge our weaknesses be less intense? It seems unlikely that a reverse timeline could spawn such a Mardi Gras atmosphere when Ash Wednesday eventually arrived. In fact, the process could become more introspective and less celebratory. 
If Lent were to be reversed, today, at its conclusion, I would think of the Bengal Bouts. My reflections would naturally remind me of Father James L. Riehle, C.S.C., '49, '78 MSA, who passed away in October. Riehle's iconic campus personality evolved while fighting as a boxer during his youth. Maybe his magic came from his seminary training, or maybe it was the fact that he entered the priesthood at the age of 43 after living a life in the real world. But Riehle's uniquely masculine yet tender persona dominated his tenure as dean of students, as Pangborn Hall rector for a dozen years, as the Monogram Club's executive director for two decades and as athletic chaplain presiding over the Notre Dame football team's game-day mass for more than a quarter of a century. 


Riehle successfully managed an impossi­ble task while dean ofstudents during the height of the Vietnam war from 1967 to 1973. He was the sheriff of Campus Mayberry -an insulated Catholic educa­tional enclave whose residents knew too well roommates lost overseas. The harsh reality became starkly visual one day when someone planted more than 200 white crosses on the South Quad, each representing a lost Notre Dame graduate. In the end, a pair ofstokes moved Riehle from a cane to a golf cart. Yet, the frail shadow of this man never lost his meas­ured temperament, sense ofjustice nor his legendary whit. 
Lent focuses us on death, hope and life. It teaches us that the good in our loved ones is never gone. So each winter bits of Fr. Riehle come back to those who shared 
a moment with him during the Bengal 
Bouts or at a Monogram Club function. When trekking back to campus for a foot­ball game, his old office in the Main Building conjures ghosts oftimes many of us were summoned for disciplinary rea­sons. On any evening at home, we whose lives were touched by Riehle can still thumb through a year book for a tangible snapshot of his image. 
As dean of students, Riehle ruled autonomously in a time that University president emeritus Fr. Theodore Hesburgh calls the student "revolution." As presi­dent, Hesburgh established his famous 15­minute rule whereby disruptive students hindering another's rights were given 15 minutes to meditate, then desist or face expulsion. Page 336 of the 1970 year book, "Dome," includes a photograph of Riehle in the Main Building looking at his watch to time a warning to more than 100 stu­dents protesting against the CIA and Dow Chemical, manufacturer of napalm, on campus to recruit students. Riehle expelled five students and suspended five others. Yet, all but one returned to earn a degree. 
My favorite photograph of Riehle lives on page 280 of the 1976 "Dome." It exhibits the hwnan side of Riehle who, as Dean of Students, mingled with students and shared mutual respect. The photograph shows Riehle at the Senior Bar with his signature cigar in hand while grasping a plastic cup of beer and speaking with a student who held a beer as well. It reveals how Riehle lived a measured Sheriff Andy Taylor existence during the height of the Vietnam war's upheaval years. 
During Riehle's tenure as dean, this columnist installed a ten-button telephone as a switchboard for rooms in a Lyons Hall wing. The phone company removed it and notified Riehle. He asked if it was stolen. Yes was the reply. "Well, the phone compa­ny took the phone and does not recom­mend anything, so don't do it again," Riehle ordered. 
Lent is forgiving regardless of the approach or degree of sacrifice. For those who depend on Fat Weekend in prepara­tion, Lent can actually be the best of times. Lent calls out Riehle's oftentimes pro­nounced verdict and signature comment, "Don't do that again."

LETIERS TO THE EDITOR 

'Reefer madness' is insalubrious 

In Ben Linskey's "Reefer Madness" (Feb. 19), he argues that weed is not addictive, does.not cause serious health problems, does not adversely affect the population and is a far less dangerous drug than alcohol. 
I come from San Diego, one of the most pot-infested cities on the map. I have numerous friends who have battled their drug addic­tions, and oftentimes they'll tell me that their Dad still hasn't kicked the habit ofsmoking pot. The most unsafe I've ever felt in a car was when I was a passenger in a car where the driver was getting stoned. For all of Linskey's noble opposition to drinking and driving, I would go further and say that smoking pot and driving is just ac; bad -impaired reaction time and altered perception being chief con­cerns. 
Linskey's assertion that weed is harmless is incorrect. One needs only to Google-search "harmful effects of marijuana" to fmd the medical consensus on its adverse effects. There's also a concept I taught when I was an anti-drug counselor back in San Diego for three years: amotivational syndrome -that a pothead loses his or her motivation to participate in everyday activities: sports, classes, relationships. 
Some people say that smoking pot is natural because it is of the Earth, but should we be breathing in the fumes of a bonfire, if that is also "of the Earth?" Anytime a person inhales smoke, they are doing damage to their body -on both a microscopic level an<1 a holistic level. 
When I evaluate a person's argwnent, I look for areas where a per­son uses hyperbole, or conversely, euphemisms. Linskey tells of how the government is holding it's war on drugs because marijuana is deemed "insalubrious." Please! Call the drug was it is; and don't downplay the harmful effects of pot. 
Linskey's ideal of drug users keeping it in the home does not often occur in actuality. One of my former good friends back home in San Diego keeps on getting arrested, not for smoking, but for repeatedly trying to brea.l( into liquor stores-a very half-baked idea. 
Furthermore, Linskey is wrong in his belief that "you have no right to dictate to your neighbor what he may do within the confines of his home." Obviously the government has the right to intercede in cases of slavery, rape, abuse, etc., and all these cases occur in the confmes of a home. · 
I'll agree that the governmental war on drugs isn't going well­but how much worse off would we be without it? There are untold 
· and unknown numbers of how many more people would do drugs if we weren't as educated about the subject as we are today. We are the product of an education system that really showed us how bad drugs are. 
For all the readers out there that had considered trying weed but ultimately decided against it, you are the reason why the War on Drugs is, on some level, effective.

Promoting vs. support 
I would like to thank Tomn1y Maranges ("A clear misunderstanding," Feb. 19) for bringing some sense and reason to the debate about homosexuali­ty, which has recently featured far too much rhetoric and far too little logic. I fail to see why the refusal to promote an idea is seen to be tantamount to reject­ing, denying, or even hating that idea. 
Bridget Flores, Mary Dewey and Jackie Emmanuel ("Catholic teachings," Feb. 19) would have you believe that anyone who does not own an "Ally" or "Gay? Fine With me" T-shirt dislikes or dis­criminates against homosexuals. While this is ludi­crous to the average reader, many find it acceptable to believe that the University is discriminatory against gays, just because the mission statement does not explicitly denounce it. 
The problem with the Queer Film Festival is that it does nothing. to eliminate the isolation described by Flores and Co. Instead, organizations and events tai­lored specifically towards homosexuals only serve to highlight our differences and create the very isola­tion that Flores so gravely dreads. If a gay movie was banned or censored during a sexuality-neutral film festival, an outcry against discrimination and isolation would certainly be appropriate, but using a gay-only fibn festival to fight isolation is the equiva­lent of using a male-only film festival to improve gender relations. If a demographic wishes to sepa­

rate themselves from the population with specific 

events just for them, they lose the right to blame the l majority for the divide that will inevitably arise. In conclusion, a refusal to promote gay-specific

activities is not anti-gay. Rather, it is the University

acting on a religious foundation to not to promote a lifestyle deemed to be morally disordered. "Pro-gay" and "anti-gay" are not the only options. Supportive of homosexuals but not actively promoting the lifestyle, the University is fulfilling its duty as a Catholic institution of higher learning.

Footlongs worthy of fight 
Dear Michelle Byrne and Lauren Cmpmings ("That's bologna," Feb. 19), 
I would like to thank you for expressing your pro­found sentiments concerning John Traub's five-dol­lar footlong campaign ("Five-dollar footlongs," Feb. 13). You truly are an inspiration·to us all. 
I completely agree that the speed at which the Facebook group gathered 1550 students to support the cause is truly an accomplishment. Perhaps it's a sign that Notre Dame students do actually have a pulse and care about some sort of justice, that stu­dents will not stand for price gouging (something that just happens to be illegal in many other indus­tries) and are at least nominally willing to break the stereotype of the rich spoiled brat that surrounds the Notre Dame student body, trying to be at least a little more fiscally responsible. 
And I couldn't agree more with your classification of recycling and sexual ao;;sault as "trivial issues." Meriam Webster's online Dictionary defines trivial as being "commonplace or ordinary." Five-dollar footlongs have occupied the front cover of The Observer for all of one day, whereas stories about sexual assault and recycling seem to be a daily occurrence. 
Finally. I would like to applaud your classification of the different types of Notre Dame Students. Indeed only that one percent of us who are "vegans and wear tie-dye" care about the rest of the world, the other 99 percent of us selfish, diversity-hating fascists could care less. It's not as if the majority of students are involved in various service initiates across the greater Michiana area, or that the stu­dent government, directly elected by the students, is actively trying to make a diflE~rence in the communi­ty and in the environment ... 
Give me a break! Just because you couldn't care less about a blatantly unfa'ir economic situation at your own school doesn't mean that you have to attack this idea. People do genuinely care about conflkts in Africa and sustainability, recycling and Sexual Assault, but are sick of hearing a small and vocal minority consistently badger the greater Notre Dame community about what they think is right. We want to take care of an issue that affects each and every red-blooded person at this campus and, as John Traub's research shows, really may make a significant impact, lest we forget that money, in fact, does not grown on trees (especially for college stu­dents). 
Get it?

BEST PICTURE: SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE 
"Slumdog Millionaire" has been racking up awards from every which way this awards season. And barring any upset:it will probably receive the season's highest honor, Best Picture at the Oscars. What was originally a film intended to go straight to DVD has 
. truly become the Cinderella story of 2008. Only, .in the process, it has bec?~e Goli~th, leaving every other film to inhabit the role of DaVId. However, the Academy s mfatuatwn .with biopics may very well prove the wild card factor here, and may land "Milk" .the · honor. "Milk" has been scoring best picture wins in film critics' circles across the natiOn, but has yet to receive the coveted grand prize at any of the nation's big-audience awards shows ("Crash," anyone?). So, if the Academy feels in a maverick sort of mood, and the moment is ripe for an upset, "Milk" may very well pull it ofT. However, put your money on "Slumdog Millionaire," capping otT its dream run with the Best Picture award.

BEST ACTOR: SEAN PENN 
This year's Best Actor race is probably the tightest of all the major categories. The list of nominees all d~liver~d powe~ful perfo~p}anc~s thisyear; the competition is ~.~;iff_\?.at vets LeQnoardq D1C~pno _rmd Clmt Ea~f..w()od .were lqft. out Qf thc_<,:atogory~ ·.. .  .. ~·> ,~ . 
Sean Penn's turn as Harvey Mnk-shoW'Sliis VersatilitY: lle iinmerses"himself so com­pletely into Milk's character and delivers an utterly transformative performance that is nothing short of remarkable. For this, Penn will probably garner the Oscar; it may be Gus Van Sant's film's only major award. 
The only real competitor standing in the way of Penn's setond Academy Award in five nominations is this year's comeback kid -Mick~y Rourke. Rourke's triumphant return in "The Wrestler" has already won him a Golden Globe. His own story, which so closely par­allels that of struggling has-been Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, has struck a chord with audiences and criiics alike. His authentic and sensitive performance might be strong enough to kick Penn out of the ring. · 
The Oscar, though, will go to Penn, whose acting tour de force will recruit the members of the Academy to vote for Harvey Milk over "The Wrestler" for Best Actor.

Ah, what a year to be a supporting actor. 
This often lower-profile category is hosting five powerhouses this year, all of whom are deserv­ing of their nominations. Josh Brolin ("Milk") has proven himself to be more than the pretty-boy son of another pretty-boy actor, bringing gravitas and power to throwaway roles. Michael Shannon, the lone actor from "Revolutionary Road" to garner a nomination, is arguably that film's emotional and moral anchor, a feat for a man portraying an institutionalized black sheep. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is always a legitimate threat when he's nominated, and his portrayal of Father Brendan in "Doubt" is as solid as ever. And Robert Downey Jr.'s performance in "Tropic Thunder" is nothing short of outrageous-it's a risk-taking move for an actor who rarely settles for the ordinary. 
But despite the sentimentality· that rrll,ght come along with this decision, the Academy should choose Heath Ledger on Sunday night. Ledger's performance as the Joker in "The Dark Knight" a transformative, revolutionary approach to a role that audiences have already seen on the big and small screen. Ledger tormentc;; his predecessors, become darker, funnier and more disturb­than most actors dare to let themselves. Ledger would become only the second actor to 
win a golden statue, a real testament to his performance.

SHANE STEINBERG Scene Writer 
1. 
"The Wrestler:" An awe-inspiring tour de force of a film, Darren Aronofsky's masterpiece is so deeply pene­trating that it becomes a sort of beautiful requiem. Mickey Rourke's performance as an over-the-hill wrestler trying to hold onto the false hope that he can mount a comeback is iconic at the least and deserves placement alongside the great screen perf-ormances of all time. 

2. 
"4 Months. 3 Weeks, 2 Days:" This isn't a movie about illegal abortion in the communist bloc. No, it's a surreal, downright horrifying freefall into the confines of human suffering and isolation so washed in unbearable 


rawness, that at its end, a part of you will wish that you hadn't seen it because of how scarred it leaves you. 
3. 
"Wall-E:" Very little dialogue and a robot with feel­ings as the main character? No problem. This searing love poem straight from the masterminds at Pixar stu­dios is so heartfelt that its title character has probably become the studio's most beloved, which is saying a lot. This is one of those rare films that even the coldest of hearts can't keep from cheering for. 

4. 
"Waltz With Bashir:" A paradox of a film, this ani­mated documentary about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the 1980's is a marvel in -every sense of the word. It will at once tug and tear at your insides forcing you to want to look away in anguish, only to fail because the animation draws you in and doesn't let you escape its

5. "Revolutionary Road:" This is the most underrated film of 2008. Sam Mendes directs Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in this emotionally wrought, brutally honest drama about the struggle to hold onto one's individual­ism when its seems as though life is resigning itself only to leave behind a numb existence. There isn't an ounce of happiness in this film, but it works because of how well it's put together and how poignant the end result is.

BEST DIRECTOR: DANNY BOYLE 
This year's nominees for achievement in directing are David Fincher for "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button;" Danny Boyle for "Slumdog Millionaire;" Ron Howard for "Frost/Nixon;" Gus Van Sant for "Milk;" and Stephen Daldry for "The Reader." Despite the presence of previous winners in the mix, and Daldry's unique place in Academy Award his­tory (he's been nominated for each of the three films he's directed), the Oscar will go to Boyle. "Slumdog Millionaire" owes its creative, Bollywood-infused style of filmmaking to Boyle, along with the relentless sense of energy that pervades the entire film. In a lesser director's hands, "Slumdog': could have easily fallen into cliches, but Boyle managed to craft a film that does not shy away from harsh realities and yet retains a joyful, uplifting spirit. This movie represents a new style of international filmmaking. completely different from any of the other films nominated in this category in this and in past years, and its director should be recognized for .his remarkable achievement. For those who didn't see "Slum dog" and can't understand what the fuss is about, just look at-the indications from other award shows so far this year. Boyle has won a Golden Globe, a BAFTA, and an award from the Director's Guild of America. On Sunday night, he will win an Academy Award as well.

Leonardo DiCaprio. 
The dark horse for this category is Anne Hathaway. Long gone are the days of frizzy hair and Disney princess endings. She's nominated for hnr role as a recovering adclict in "Rachel Getting Married," a performance that turned heads and revealed to the world this girl really does have acting chops. 
But ifWmslet doesn'twin, it will most certainly go to Meryl Streep. Always a safe bet. Angelina Jo!ie, like her co-pilot Brad Pitt, is just a novelty nomination, and Melissa Leo is the Academy's way of proving it tries not to play favorites. Nice try, but this one belongs to Hollywood's proven goddess. Winslet. 
Please Contact Stephanie DePrez at sdeprez@nd.edu. 
BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS: PELNELOPE CRUZ 
Penelope Cruz will take home the Oscar her role in "Vicky Cristina Barcelona." With Kate Winslet out of the way (for most awards, she was nominated in this category for "The Reader," but at Academy Awards, this role earned her a Best Actress nomination), Cruz looks like she will be the winner. She has received eight nominations from the major awards circuit and has won five of them for her role as the unstable ex-wife of Javier Bardem's artist. vvtnslet was easily her main competition. Amy Adams and Taraji 
P. Henson, although deserving of their nominations, don't seem to be serious contenders for the award. The most likely to keep Cruz from the award are Viola Davis for her brief role in "Doubt" and Maris a Tomei for "The Wrestler". People just love Davis as the mother of a potentially abused boy, and Tomei easily wins Mickey Rourke's heart, and the audience's, as a caring stripper. However, the odds are still in Cruz's favor. She will likely walk away \vith her first statue for her second nomination. She was previously nominated Best Actress in 2007 for the Spanish-language film "Volver."

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Duke was in rare territory for one of college basketball's premier programs over the last few decades. So the ninth-ranked Blue Devils went back to basics to right things for at least one game, a 76-69 victory over St. John's on Thursday night. 
"We stopped playing with an e'tlge on defense and that hap­pens and it doesn't take much for it to happen," Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said after the Blue Devils snapped a two­game losing streak that was part of them losing four of six. "We just have to find that edge and tonight we were closer to it and Elliott helped in that regard. It was a collective response on the defensive end." 
Freshman Elliott Williams, who Krzyzewski said added some "verve" in recent prac­tices, made just his second start of the season and he was the early spark Duke needed on the defensive end, pressuring the ball and improving the team's speed."I found out I was start­ing two days ago after a couple of good practices," said Williams, who had a career­high 11 points on 5-for-6 shoot-

I, 
~ 
ing at Madison Square Garden. "I tried to be a. spark for the veteran guys. I tried to think of it as just a game but it was pretty exciting." 
Gerald Henderson scored 19 points for the Blue Dev:ils as the starters scored all but four points. 
The Blue Devils (21-5) looked more like the team that has spent the entire season in the top 10, including one week at No. 1, hitting 3-pointers and converting turnovers into points. 
Jon Scheyer had 18 points, Kyle Singler scored 15 and Lance Thomas added nine for Duke. 
"This has been a tough time for us, the last couple of weeks but that's what the Atlantic Coast Conference and the Big East does to its members," Krzyzewski said. "We were knocked back a little bit and we have to recover. This was a big step in the right direction." 
The Blue Devils finished 7 -for­
15 on 3s (46.7 percent), the first 
time since Jan. 24 they shot 
better than 33 percent from 
beyond the arc. They were 3­
for-16 in the loss to Boston 
College on Sunday. 
"We weren't in a slump, it's a 

game of percentages and they 
come around," Singler said, 
. sounding like the shooter he is. "We got good shots tonight and we made good shots." 
D.J. Kennedy had 20 points for the Red Storm (12-14), who have lost five straight overall and six in a row to Duke. The Blue Devils have won 13 of the last 15 meetings and this win improves their record at Madison Square Garden in the series to 5-1. 
With Singler and Scheyer both going 2-for-3 on 3s in the first half and St. John's matching its season average for a game with 14 turnovers, Duke was able to take a lead as big as 32-18 with 
4:48 left and the Blue Devils led 37-26 at halftime. 
They led by as many as 16 points in the second half, the last time at 60-44 on a jumper by Thomas with 10:09 to play. St. John's closed to 74-69 on two free throws by Malik Boothe with 15.6 seconds to play, but Scheyer made two free throws to seal it. 
"We just didn't get some shots down," said St. John's coach Norm Roberts whose team shot 54 percent (27 -for-50), its sec­ond-best mark of the season. He did explain the turnovers. "Youth and inexperience and trying to make something hap­pen when it's not there." 
Henderson said the Blue Devils did take the game as a must-win. 
"Absolutely we did. We had lost four of six," he said. "We got a win and that's part of how we want to play. This was a big win for us." 
Charlotte 65, No. 16 Xavier 
60 

No. 16 Xavier's latest loss in its puzzling slide left coach Sean Miller fuming and Charlotte celebrating like old times. 
Able to corral its young but raw talent and finally getting top scorer Lamont Mack hot late in the game, the 49ers stunned No. 16 X a vier on Thursday, dropping the strug­gling Musketeers to second place in the Atlantic 10. 
On a night the 49ers retired the jersey of 2005 Conference .. USA player of the year Eddie Basden, the 49ers {10-15, 4-7) played like the teams that used to contend in that competitive league before realignment, leaving their suffering fans 
pouring onto the court for a confetti-dropping party. 
"This team, I've said it all year, has never quit and never stopped believing~ despite all the injuries and adversity that we've had," coach Bobby Lutz said. "It's amazing how hard they work and how much they believe that we can beat any­body we play. 
"We' also know that we've got a fine margin for error." It's why they needed the five 
3-pointers and 16 points from Ian Andersen and why the tide turned when Mack got out of his funk, scoring all 12 points in the final 8 minutes, including a 3-pointer with 31 seconds left to put Charlotte ahead 62-58. 
C.J. Anderson had 13 points and seven rebounds for the Musketeers (21-5, 9-3), who got only nine points from senior 
B.J. Raymond in their third straight road loss. 
Upset with confusion over who should go first in the postgame news conference, Miller declined to come to the podium and released a brief statement after his team slipped a half-game behind Dayton in the A-10. 
"They're playing their best basketball of the season right now," Miller said of Charlotte. "We are not playing well right now. We need to fix some things and it needs to start with prac­tice tomorrow." 
Xavier, which has had two stints in the top 10, may fall out of the rankings as it continued its funk that's included losses to Dayton and Duquesne. 
In a back-and-forth game with 24 lead changes and 17 ties, Mack scored six consecu­tive points to put Charlotte ahead 56-53. A minute later Andersen hit an off-balance 3 from the right wing to give Charlotte a 59-55 lead with 2:21left. 
Xavier got within 59-58 on Ande-rson's driving layup with 49 seconds left before Mack's 3 sent the Halton Are·ria crowd into a frenzy. 
An'Juan Wilderness, whq scored 15 points, iced it by going 3-for-4 from the foul line in the final 11 seconds. 
"It was great. I love the atmosphere," Wilderness said. ''I can't even put it into words right now." 
Xavier cruised to a 22-point home win over Charlotte last month behind a 20-rebound advantage. But..Jhe 49ers were without Wilderness, who was since returned from a stress fracture in his foot. 
Despite its poor record, the athletic if not polished 49ers entered having won four of their past five home games, including a win over now-No. 25 Dayton just before the Flyers knocked off Xavier. 
And while Xavier controlled the inside, it struggled to keep up with Charlotte's frenzied pace behind point guard DiJuan Harris .

"He was ready to go weeks ago," Stuart Appleby said at Hiviera. "I don't think he needs to do a couple of laps around the track. He'll be on that horse and he'll be whip­ping it." 
The timing for Woods to end his 254-day break from competition could not be bet­ter for the PGA Tour, which has seen television ratings plunge after the world's No. 1 player had to miss the sec­ond half of the season, including two majors, the Hyder Cup and the FedEx Cup playoffs. 
"We are delighted that Tiger Ls returning to compe­tition and look forward to watching him compete next week," commissioner Tim Finchem said in a statement. 
The last shot Wood-; hit for real was a short par putt on the 9lst hole of the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines, where he defeated Rocco Mediate in a playoff to capture his 14th major, which Woods described as "probably the best ever" under the circum­stances. 
He had surgery after the Masters last year to repair cartilage damage in his left knee, and suffered a double stress fracture in his left leg while preparing for his return. 
He limped badly over the final few days of the U.S. Open, later saying the swelling wa. so bad at night that he couldn't see his knee cap. A week after winning, he had reconstructive sur­gery, the third operation on his left knee in five years. 
What to expect? 
"He's human," swing coach I lank Haney said. "He has played one tournament in 10 months. I vvould think he would be a little rtL'>ty, but I really don't know what to expect. Nothing with Tiger ever surprises me." 
Woods began hitting short irons toward the end of December, and friends such as Mark O'Meara and John Cook said he had been play­ing plenty of golf over the last few weeks at his home course in Florida. 
Spurs Ginobili out 2-3 
weeks with ankle injury 
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. -Manu Ginobili started the season dealing with an injury to one ankle. Now the San Antonio Spurs super-sub is sidelined because of the other one. 
Coach Gregg Popovich said Thursday before the Spurs played in Detroit that Ginobili is -expected to be sidelined for 2-3 weeks. 
"It's a stress reaction, not a stress fracture, which is impor­tant," Popovich said. "If it had been a stress fracture, there's no way he could have been playing, and certainly not as well as he has been." 
Ginobili had X-rays, an MRI and a CT scan, and Popovich said the results were encouraging. 
"The new bone is already start­ing to lay down, which means the healing process is underway," he said. ''We're thinking that it will be 2-3 more weeks from tonight." 

Rodriguez refuses to speak
further on steroid claims 
TAMPA, Fla. -Alex Rodriguez ducked follow-up questions about his drug use, refusing to address a report identifYing the cousin the Yankees star claims injected him with a banned sub­stance. 
''I'm not talking about it anymore," Rodriguez said Thursday. 
The slugger also wouldn't discuss Major League Baseball's attempt to interview him about his tainted past. 
''I'd rather not get into that," he said. 
The three-time AL MVP met with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and workeri out on the main field at New York's spring training camp. Fans applauded and shouted encourage­ment, and critical shouts were at a min­imum. 
"The relief was just putting the uni­form back on and running out there with my teammates,:· Hodriguez said. "No matter what happens and what has occurred in my life, the baseball field is where I feel most comfortable." 
Guard Alston traded from 
Rockets to Magic at deadline 
HOUSTON -The Houston Rockets traded point guard Hafer Alston to Orlando and acquired Magic forward Brian Cook and Memphis guard Kyle Lowry on Thursday, two people with knowl­
edge  of  the  deal  told  The  
Associated Press.  
Memphis  also  received  the  

Magic's first-round draft pick as part of the deal, said the people, who requested anonymity because the trade had not been announced by any of the teams. 
The three-team swap eame one day after Rockets star· Tracy McGrady announced on his Web site that he'll have season-ending microfracture surgery on his trou­blesome left knee. 
The Magic, meanwhile, needed an experienced point guard after Jameer Nelson suffered a poten­tially season-ending shoulder injury Feb. 2.

No. 11 Irish face off against No.1 Wildcats 
By MEAGHAN VESELIK Sports Writer 
Notre Dame's campaign for a championship continues as it opens its home season this weekend as it hosts the No.1 Northwestern Wildcats Friday and the Ohio State Buckeyes Sunday. 
The No. 11 Irish have met with the Wildcats nine times in their 13 seasons-the Wildcats hold a 7-2 edge in the series. Last year, Northwestern ended Notre Dame's season with a 15­7 win in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. 
Against the Buckeyes, the Irish hold a 7-6 edge in the two teams' history, going 3-4 at home. In their last meeting, Notre Dame took the game 14­11. 
Notre Dame is coming into this game 1-0 after a 22-7 win last weekend at Duquesne in its season opener. Ten different Irish players scored in the game, led by junior Gina Scioscia and sophomore Shaylyn Blaney, each with four goals. 
All 13 of Notre Dame's sea­sons have been coached by head coach Tracy Coyne, who is in her 22nd season of coaching after two at Denison, where she was 23-5, and seven at Roanoke with a 91-21 record. Coyne led Denison and Roanoke to a eombined six Div. III NCAA 
tournament appearanees. In the past seven years. Notre Dame has advanced to the NCAA tournament four times, including a first-time appear­
ance in the finals in 2006. 
Leading the Irish this season are senior captains Shannon Burke and Jillian Byers, both preseason all-Big East selec­tions. Burke is key to Notre Dame's defense, coming out of last season with eight goals and three assists, second on the team for ground balls (33) and draw controls (51), and led the team in caused turnovers (52). 
Byers has been a unanimous selection on the all-Big East team her last three seasons, and a three-time second team All-American. Last season, she led the Irish with 67 goals, 14 assists for 81 points, and a school record of 52 draw con­trols. She holds the Notre Dame record as the all-time leader in goals with 182, is seventh in assists, and third in points. 
Both the Wildcats and Buckeyes will have to be wary of another Irish senior this sea­son, goalkeeper Erin Goodman. Goodman has made 3 7 consec­utive starts since the beginning of the 2007 season, and has a career 24 wins, the most recent being at Duquesne. Last season she had single-season records of 172 saves and played over 1,100 minutes. She is third for the Irish with career saves of 
316. Thought you would enjoy this one. 
Notre Dame goes up against Northwestern Friday at 7 p.m. in the Loftus Sports Center, and 
Ohio State Sunday, 1 p.m. also at home.

NFL 

Panthers sign All-Pro Gross 
Associated Press 

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -The Carolina Panthers placed the franchise tag on Julius Peppers Thursday, setting up a potential nasty showdown with their four-time Pro Bowl defensive end who wants to play elsewhere next season. 
The move came moments after the Panthers signed All­Pro left tackle Jordan Gross to a six-year deal worth more than $30 million in the first three seasons. Having locked up Gross, the Panthers then placed the non-exclusive tag on Peppers, who had said he would request a trade under that scenario. 
"Julius was expecting to be franchised," Peppers' agent, Carl Carey, wrote in a text message. "We will continue to work toward a resolution that is in line with his professional goals." 
Under the non-exclusive franchise tag rules, Carolina offered Peppers a one-year guaranteed deal worth $16.7 million that will immediately count against the salary cap. While Peppers can still solieit offers from other teams, any club signing Peppers would have to surrender two first­round draft picks to Carolina. 
Placing the tag on Peppers theoretically allows the Panthers to trade him for something less than two first­rounders and get some com­pensation instead of letting the cornerstone of their 
defense walk away in free 
agency. But Peppers has 
power because no team would 
likely trade for him without 
first securing a long-term con­tract agreement. 
A person close to Peppers on Wednesday said he would agree to be traded to only four teams, including the Dallas Cowboys, who do not hold a first-round pick. So the Panthers face the prospect of not being able to work out {1. trade and then having Peppers either hold out or be disgrun­tled while eating up a giant portion of the salary cap. 
But while Peppers has been adamant that he won't sign a long-term deal with Carolina, general manager Marty Hurney wouldn't rule out Peppers returning and said the team will not immediately seek a trade. 
"We've said many times how many times we value Julius," Hurney said. "We would like him to play here." 
NFL teams can place the franchise tag on just one play­er, so the Panthers were scrambling to come to terms with Gross before the Thursday afternoon deadline. 
Carolina's first-round pick in 2003 played last season under the franchise tag in a one­year, $7.45 million deal. His . new contract makes him one of the NFL's highest-paid offensive lineman. 
"Jordan is one of the top left tackles in our league and our offensive line was one of our strong points of our team last year," Hurney said. "Jordan's a very big part of that. ... We're so glad we were able to come to an agreement and be 
able to have Jordan here for 
another six years." 

Gross, who made his t=irst 
Pro Bowl and was voted a 
first-team All-Pro last season, had said he wanted to stay in Carolina and was the key cog in an impwved offensive line that helped running backs DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart have break­out seasons. 
The moves mean that all five starters on the line are locked up in long-term deals. The defensive line, meanwhile, is in flux -and Gross' contract allowed the Panthers to play hardball with Peppers. 
"He actually texted me con­gratulations after I signed and said you deserve it," Gross said of Peppers in a brief phone interview Thursday night. "I think it was much easier on the team dealing with him." 
Peppers, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2002 draft, is a freakish athlete and Carolina's career sacks leader. But Peppers has also been criti­cized for inconsistent play ­he had a career--high 141f2 sacks this past season, but a career-low 2112 the year before. 
Even in 2008, Peppers didn't record a single tackle against Denver and was shut down in Carolina's upset . loss to Arizona in the playoffs. 
Peppers, who turned down a lucrative contract extension before the start of last season, has said he would like to play outside linebacker in a 3-4 defense instead of staying in Carolina's 4-3 alignment. 
There is precr.dent to slap­ping the franchise tag on a player and then dealing him. Kansas City traded defensive end Jared Allen to Minnesota last year for a first-round pick and two third-round choices.

Freshman Zeller returns from injury for North Carolina 
Associated Press 
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -Tyler Zeller couldn't pass up a chance to play a meaningful role in North Carolina's run at another national championship. 
The 7 -foot freshman broke his wrist two games into the sea­son, but instead sitting out and picking up another year of eligi­bility, 26 games into the Tar Heels' season Zeller played in his third college contes~ Wednesday. 
The 2008 Indiana Mr. Basketball from Washington High School grabbed 8 minutes in North Carolina's 89-80 victo­ry over instate rival North Carolina State. 
"It is one of those things where I am losing half a season, but I know at the same time, these are my teammates," Zeller said. "I've got to help support them if I can help them in any way.... I feel like I'm obli'gated, just because they have been great to me the whole time I have been injured. 
"As I come back ... if there's anything I can do to help them out, to help them get to their goal of winning a national championship, then I will help." 
It wasn't long ago that North Carolina took another hit when two other players were ruled out for the remainder of the season. The Tar Heels (24-2, 10-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) regained a measure of their once unrivaled depth with the earlier-than-expected return of Zeller. 

Zeller started the season· as the emergency replacement for then-injured star Tyler Hansbrough. but he broke his left wrist late in the second game of the year. 
Team officials said at the time his season was likely over because the injury had a nor­mal recovery period of 12-to-16 weeks.

MLB 
Glavine agrees to one year deal with Braves 
Associated Press 
KISSIMMEE, Fla. -Tom Glavine has returned to the Atlanta Braves for one more sea­son, reaching a preliminary agreement on a $1 million, one­year contract. 
The deal is likely to be announced Friday, a person familiar with the negotiations said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the Braves had not yet confirmed it. It will contain $3.5 million in bonuses based on roster time. 
"It's very close," Braves spokesman Brad Hainje said Thursday night. "They're going to talk again in the morning." 
The left-bander, who turns 43 next month, was 2-4 with a 5.54 ERA in 13 starts last season, cut short by an elbow injury. Glavine's partially torn elbow tendon was repaired on Aug. 21 by Dr. James Andrews, who also cleaned up Glavine's shoulder. 
A 305-game winner, Glavine spent his first 16 major league seasons with the Braves, win­ning the NL Cy Young Award in 1991 and 1998. 
The 10-time All-Star pitched for the Mets from 2003-07 and earned his 300th win with New York in 2007 before returning to Atlanta for the 2008 season, when he made $8 million. 
Glavine would earn a $1 mil­lion bonus when he is placed on the active roster and $1.25 mil­lion each for 30 and 90 days on the active roster. The Braves have the ability to defer the $2.5 million from the final two levels. 
He is not expected to report to spring training until about March 1, instead continuing his rehab program in the Atlanta area. 
The deal with Glavine will be a welcome bit of news in the Braves' camp, still reeling from Ken Griffey Jr.'s decision to sign with the Seattle Mariners. 
The 39-year-old Griffey had approached the Braves last week, expressing a desire to fin­ish his career in Atlanta, but apparently had a change of heart. He informed the Braves late Wednesday he was return­ing to the city where he played his first 11 big league seasons. 
Glavine will likely serve as Atlanta's fifth starter behind Derek Lowe, Jair Jurrjens, Javier Vazquez and Kenshin Kawakami. The lefty will have some extra time to rehab his elbow and shoulder, since the BraVflS won't need a fifth starter until April 19 because of days off. 
"It would be great to get Tommy back," manager Bobby Cox said. "It's alwavs better to have one more optio~." 
Glavine's return will likely ensure that top prospect Tommy Hanson gets a little more sea­soning in the minors. The 22­year-old right-hander has never pitched above Double-A, and the Braves would like him to get at least a half-season at their top farm club. 
"There's no question he will benefit from more time in the minor leagues," general manag­er Frank Wren said. "He will continue to develop and grow from his experiences."

Irish net fifth straight win 
By CHRIS MICHALSKI Sports Writer 
With a come-from-behind singles victory by freshman Niall Fitzgerald, No..25 Notre Dame knocked off previously undefeated Northwestern University yesterday with a hard-fought 4-3 victory. The win marks the fifth straight Irish victory, bringing their overall record to 6-4. 
The match began with Steven Havens and Casey Watt falling to Northwestern's Alex Sanborn and Joshua Graves 8­2 in second doubles. The 13th­ranked doubles team of Brett Helgeson and Tyler Davis then won first doubles followed by a third doubles win by Niall Fitzgerald and Matt Johnson. The win gave Notre Dame a 1­0 lead early in the meet. 

Freshman Casey Watt tacked on a second point with a win at fourth singles. Northwestern's Joshua Graves kept it close, winning No. 6 singles over Notre Dame's freshman Samuel Keeton. 
The teams went back and forth once more with No. 122 Daniel Stahl winning at third singles followed by a three-set Northwestern win at second singles. No. 18 Brett Helgeson then ended his personal three­match singles win streak by dropping a three-set match to the Wildcats' Marc Dwyer. 
With the score deadlocked at three, Niall Fitzgerald pulled through and ensured the victo­ry for the Irish. After dropping the first set 1-6, Fitzgerald came back to win the second 
and third sets 6-2 and 7-5, respectively. The win is his third straight at singles. 
The schedule does not get any easier for the Irish as they next to travel to Columbus to face Ohio State. The No. 3 Buckeyes are currently 9-1 and coming off a victory over UCLA. The Buckeyes have a number of skilled tennis players. Their top-three have all been ranked in the top-five in the country at some point in their careers. It will be a major challenge for the Irish, as coach Bobby Bayliss considers them the "odds-on favorite to win this year's NCAA tournament." 
First serve is noon on Sunday.

Irish set to take on BYU, Utah 
By ALEX BARKER 
Sports Writer 
Fresh off a 7-0 thrashing of in-state rival Purdue Wednesday, the Irish will travel cross-country to take on Brigham Young and Utah in a dual-match road trip this weekend in Provo, Utah. 
No. 14 Notre Dame is cur­rently 7-1 on the season, including six victories over ranked opponents. The Irish's only loss came against top­ranked Northwestern in the 

semifinals of last weekend's ITA Indoor National champi­onships. 
Freshman Shannon Mathews has led the Irish so far this season notching a 6-0 record at the No. 6 singles spot. Mathews' 3-0 record at the Indoor National champi­onship tournament resulted in her being named to the All-Tournament team. She 
becomes the first Irish player to receive this honor. "Shannon has come up with big wins for us this season," Irish coach Jay Louderback said. "She's really been able to build on her success as the season has progressed." Louderback has been very pleased with his team's per­formance so far. "I feel really good about where we are right now," he said. "At this point, I believe we can compete with any team in the country." Even with two early victo­ries over top-five teams Baylor and Stanford, Louderback is still looking for 
The 
his team to continue improv­ing with every match. 
"We have plenty of tough matches in the next few weeks and winning some close ones against top-five teams has definitely helped our confidence," he said. "But we have some things that we have to improve on to do well at the end of the year."
As for this stretch of match­es that will give the Irish a bit of a break after facing three top-five teams in a row, Louderback won't be taking the weaker opponents any lighter. "Doing well last weekend puts a bigger target on your back," he acknowledged. "So we really have to be ready for every team we play." After this weekend's long road trip, the Irish will return home for a three­game stretch at the Eck Tennis Pavilion starting with ,

Tourney finishes Saturday 

·Lytle and Hoffman set records on Thursday 
heat later in the event final with a time of 20.05. Lytle's performance was good enough for fifth place in the event, as Cincinnati's Josh Schneider held onto first place after breaking the Big East record in the morning session with a time of 19.17. 
Lytle and Hoffman later teamed up to form the front half of Notre Dame's 200-yard freestyle relay team to further cement their status in the Irish record books. The Irish sprinters teamed with sopho­more Joshua Nosal and senior Danny Lutkus to break the Irish record with a time of 1:19.42, which was good for second place and an NCAA B­cut time. 
Arguably, the most impres­sive Irish performance of the day came in the 500-yard freestyle, as a dominant per­formance in the preliminaries put six Notre Dame.swimmers into the event finals. Sophomore Steven Brus won his first career conference title in the event with a time of 4:23.99, which earned him an NCAA B-cut time. Fellow sophomore Michael Sullivan finished in second place to garner all-conference honors while senior Jeff Wood fin­ished fourth. Juniors Jeff Wood and Andrew Deters fin­ished fifth and sixth, respec­tively, while Lutkus scored for the Irish in the eighth spot. In the consolation final, Nosal led the event for the first 400 yards but was overtaken by Connecticut's John Hogan in the final 100 to finish in sec­ond place. 
In other action, senior Bill Bauman finished third in the consolation finals of the 200­yard individual medley after a strong surge in a time of 1:50.63, the team's best of the season. 
Heading into the final two days of competition, Notre Dame leads Louisville by 25 points. The Irish will look to extend that lead on Friday, when the Big East Championships resume at the Indiana University Natatorium in Indianapolis at 10 a.m.

Miller sets school record in 50-yard freestyle

Sports Writer 
Coming into the second day of competition of their Big East Championship title defense, Notre Dame was in good shape. 
The No. 25 Irish were in led the field with 80 points, 12 ahead of second-place No. 23 Louisville. 
Shaking off the jitters from the first day, Notre Dame con­tinued to increase its lead over the Cardinals and the rest of the field Thursday with 209 points to bring its overall score to 289. Louisville held onto second with 242.5 points. 
Irish sophomore Amywren Miller had a record-breaking performance in the 50-meter freestyle. Her time of 22.37 made her the fastest swimmer in Notre Dame history, but couldn't e&rn her a win. She was out-touched by one one­hundredth of a second by Louisville junior Whitney Campbell. · 
Sophomore Lauren Sylvester started the day off well for the Irish with a third place finish in the first race of day -the 500 freestyle. She finished with a time of 4:50.32. 
Junior Megan Farrell and 
freshman Emily Barton placed next for the Notre Dame in the 200 individual medley. Farrell came in second and Barton finished less than a second behind her for third. The Cardinals once again took first place in the race. Notre Dame's Ashlee Edgell finished just outside of the top three with a time of 2:01.77. 
The Irish divers dominated the 1-meter springboard, with junior Natalie Stitt and sopho­more Heidi Grossman grab­bing the top two spots with scores of 290.15 and 268.05, respectively. 
In the final race of the day, the 200 freestyle relay team snagged second in 1:31.01, just shy of Louisville's winning mark. 
Under the direction of first­year head coach Brian Barnes, the young Irish squad will continue their quest for a record-extending 13th consec­utive Big East Championship. Barnes is used to winning after spending three seasons as an assistant at perennial 
powerhouse  Auburn  
University.  
The  meet  will  conclude

At the halfway point of the 2009 Big East Conference Championships, Notre Dame finds itself in a familiar posi­tion, leading the field with 296 points after two days of com­petition. 
The Irish followed up their strong performance on Wednesday as .two Notre Dame records fell on the day. In the consolation round of the 50-yard freestyle, Irish junior Andrew Hoffman recorded a time of 20.39, besting 2005 Notre Dame graduate Frank Krakowski's record by' .06 · seconds. Krakowski had originally set the record during the 2002-03 season, making it Notre Dame's longest standing record. 
However, Hoffman's record wouldn't last, as junior John Lytle bested his classmate one

a virtual play-in game for the Big Dance, the Wildcats won, and played on in March, while Syracuse was rel­egated to the NIT for the sec­ond straight season. 
But this scenario would likely require Notre Dame to over­come its road woes and beat the Friars Saturday. 
Providence, who sits in sixth place has done what Notre 
·Dame has failed to do this sea­son -beat the middle of the pack teams in the Big East. Its biggest win came against Syracuse, and it has a record of 8-2 against teams below it in the standings. Providence returns many players from last season, when it took Notre Dame into overtime at the Joyce Center before falling 81­
74. Guard Weyinmi Efejuku, who averages, 13.7 points per game, is its leading scorer. But if Notre Dame wants to remedy its rebounding problems from Wednesday, when West Virginia out-hustled Notre Dame to a 44-32 victory on the boards, it year numbers, 
averaging 24.4 

points per game and 12.7 rebounds. But down the stretch Wednesday, the rest of Notre Dame's offense disap­peared. Notre Dame had 28 points in the second half against West Virginia -Harangody had 16 of them. 
Notre Dame will also need to play the defense that it played in home wins over Louisville and South Florida last week, when it allowed just 57 points in each contest. But a require­ment for good defense is good rebounding, something that Notre Dame needs to improve for Saturday, or it could end up disappointed on selection Sunday. 
The game will start at 12 
p.m. and will be broadcast on ESPN Full Court.

against the 
Huskies they 
can't afford to make those mistakes. So McGraw said if the Irish will strive for one thing against the Huskies it's a boost in their defensive game. 
"Because we have times where we don't shoot the ball particularly well, we have times where we will go four or five minutes without a field goal. We've had those kind of droughts, so we really need to pick it up on the defensive end," McGraw said. 
The Irish will look to put a dent defensively in Moore and the Huskies Sunday at 2 p.m.

Two Irish football players will also help lead the base­ball team this season. Senior Evan Sharpley led the team in home runs with 13 last year, and he is expected to start at first base. Sophomore Golden Tate started only nine games last year but is expect­ed to start in left field. 
Junior outfielder A.J. Pollock was named to the preseason honor roll by Baseball America. Pollock started all 55 games last sea­son and hit .352 with four home runs and 42 RBis. 
Sophomore catcher Matt Sciascia, son of former major leaguer and current manager of the L.A.. Angels of Anaheim Mike Sciascia, is expected to split time this spring with sophomore Cam McConnell. Both will have to fill the gap left by Sean Gaston, the fifth-year senior and tri-captain who graduated this spring. Gaston batted .301 and com­
mitted just nine errors in his 
four-year playing career. 
Baseball America also pre­dieted that Notre Dame would make the NCAA Tournament as a No. 4. seed and finish second in the Big East. The Big East coaches picked the Irish to finish third in the conference. Notre Dame went 16-10 in the Big East last season. The Irish lost three straight games to South Florida to end the reg­ular season, then lost another to USF and one to West Virginia to exit the tourna­ment. 
Notre Dame lost six players to the MLB draft last year: Kyle Weiland, David Phelps, Wade Korpi, Brent Graffy, Sam Elam and Brett Lilley. 
Eight freshmen joined the Irish this season, five of them pitchers. Dustin Ipsas, a right-hander from Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., went 3-0 with two saves and an ·o.77 ERA in conference action in high school. Steve Sabatino, a lefty from Lockport, Ill., had a 1. 79 ERA his junior season at Lockport Township High School. He had 57 strikeouts in 47 innings., an average of 
10.9 strikeouts per nine innings, and also hit .327.

Condra echoed his coach on the importance of controlling the pace of play away from home. 
"We play more of a simple g~me on the road," the senior center said. "We . don't

Last weekend against Northern Michigan, Notre Dame took leads of 3-0 and 4­0, but allowed the Wildcats to cut the scores to 3-3 and 4-2. Though the Irish won both games, Jackson acknowledged that they struggled to put the game out of reach. Condra was confident the same would not 
happen this weekend. "I think it's all mental," he said. "And we realized that and we talked about it. Once we get on teams we need to stay on them." If the Irish do stay on the Mavericks this weekend, it's possible that fans could see a new banner hanging in the Joyce Center soon. Condra, though, said that the team wouldn't rely on the RedHawks faltering to get their league title. "We know we need five points to win the league," he said. "And we'll just take care of it ourselves."

Team gets 
beat on 
the boards 
By CHRIS HINE Editor-in-Chief 
Early in the second halfof Notre Dame's '79-68loss to West Virginia Wednesday, Mountaineers guard Darryl Bryant missed a 3-pointer. 
It seemed like a good defen­sive stop for Notre Dame until West Virginia grabbed the offen­sive rebound. And then another. And then another. And then another.

Coming of a huge 86-79 win over South Florida Tuesday, the Irish know they can play with teams at the top of' the Big Ea:st. But Connectieut is a dif­ferent story. The Huskies nicked off' South Florida 83-37 in January and defeated Louisville 93-65 later that month.
