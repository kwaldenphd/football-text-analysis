ND, SMC students react to Iraq conflict 
By ANDREW THAGARD News Writer 
Just a day after the United States began preliminary air strikes in Iraq, Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students had mixed reactions about military action in the Middle East nation. 
On Wednesday. hours after President Bush's 48-hour ulti­matum to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein expired, the United States launched air strikes. By Thursday, Iraqi sol­diers set oil fields ablaze and British and American forces began moving across the border from Kuwait in preparation for a out into the open," said Melody large-scale coalition invasion.

Lynn Busse, a Saint Mary's junior and education major, agreed. 
"My brother's in the Marines so I really don't like it, but they have to do what they have to do," she said. 
Many students said that hav­ing family and friends in the armed forces and knowing that many people their age were sta­tioned in the Middle East has helped to shape their perspec­tive on the conflict. 
"There are many young peo­ple over there my age and you see them on TV," said Notre Dame freshman Erin Costanzo. 
"It's one of the biggest things that makes me upset. I know people in the military and they're going over there." 
Many others know students who could be called to action if the conflict persists, due to Notre Dame's high participation in Air Force, Army and Navy ROTC programs. 
"One of my best friends is in ROTC," said Hagan. "It definitely gives a different perspective when you have friends who could very easily get involved."

Officials discuss alcohol planning 
By MEGHANNE DOWNES News Editor 
Following a year of protests, petitions, resolutions, dia­logues and reports, some stu­dent government leaders and the Student Affairs Office con­tinue to differ about what course of action should be taken regarding the alcohol policy introduced last March. 
Student government leaders and administrators both said they would welcome further discussion on the policy. This is where they stop agreeing as some stu-See Also dent leaders

trators insist the changes with be upheld. 
"I will be honest: we are not going to revisit the changes," Father Mark Poorman, vice president of Student Affairs, said. "We did not decide the policy changes lightly. It was a two year process where we consulted widely and the changes were unanimously approved by both the University officers and trustees." 
Poorman added that the Board of Trustees in February confirmed the new policy and hoped positive steps would be taken by Student Affairs and student government. He said he welcomed the discussions he has had with students and is willing to entertain sugges­tions for improvements within the framework of the existing policy. 
The Board of Trustees' February resolution has already made such modifica­tions, including an instruction that the Student Affairs Office continue funding hall dances. 
Poorman said his office is 
happy to provide each resi~ 
dence hall with additional 
funding of up to $1,000 for an 
additional year as a part of the 
transitional process. 
The Board also suggested 
that additional funding for hall 
dances he provided for dorms

responsibility with their hall 
tax money. Poorman wel­
comed these audits, and said 
that halls must he held 
accountable for their finances. 
Some student government leaders do not find these modi­fications to be significant enough and are calling for the return of hall dances for a pro­bationary period. In February, the Office of the President and the Student Senate were divid­ed on how Student Body President Libby Bishop should address the alcohol policy in her report to the Board of Trustees. This division also led to the resignation of Bishop's chief of staff, Pat Hallahan. 
Bishop chose to inform the trustees of the current social climate and hall dance situa­tion. Though Bishop said she was pleased with the decision. the Senate and Hallahan, stu­dent body president-elect, con­curred that further change was necessary. 
Hallahan, who campaigned on a platform to bring back in­hall dances, said he wants to see options and programming that would keep students on campus, and would like to see the return of dances to cam­pus, if only for a probationary period. 
"It's good that there is dis­cussion but there needs to be more -there needs to be a joint effort with regard to the policy and to providing alter­natives to abusive drinking," Hallahan said.

IRISH MARCHING ON

News Writer 
An excise police comman­der said Thursday that his officers raided a St. Patrick's Day party at the College Park apartment complex after receiving information from a private citizen the previous week that a large party would take place. 
Lt. Greg Deitchley, Commander of the Michigan City office of the Indiana State Excise Police, said that his officers tried to con­firm last week that there would be a large party, but were unsuccessful because no students were on campus due to spring break. He said his office did not have any contact with the University until after the party, when they provided officials with a list of students who were arrested or cited for under­age drinking.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Let's play
Taboo 
I'm not really sure how to write a sup­posedly funny column that doesn't use the words "war," "Iraq," "bombing," "Bush," or "seven-foot gorilla." Then again, I'm not really sure how to 
write anything at all without these price­1ess staples of American comedy. 
That said, I've still got a whole lot of column left to write, and I can't fill it all whining about what­


ever it is I usually WIii Puckett whine atxmt. 
So, has anyone else noticed that Production there is absolutely no news about any­thing happening anywhere else in the world than That Place Over There? If you wat.ch CNN, FOX, CBS, NBC, ABC, MSNBC, PBS. BBC America or just about any other news channel, you might be led to believe that absolutely nothing is happening worldwide, while every human being on the planet hangs breathlessly on every word of the late-late newscasters. 
Obviously, this is the height ofAmerican arrogance and stupidity -oh, wait, I've been listening to those ultra-liberal ex-hip­pie protesters too much again. Not to say I think all protesters are this way, just the ultra-liberal ex-hippie ones. I suspect you have to be one to make any sense out of that sentence. actually. 
At any rate, never fear, The Observer is here (at least, one staffer) to remedy this grave issue. Recently in Rome, an unlucky "traveling missionary" (a.k.a. spring­breaking student) decided to ignore the big red circle and dash blaring DO NOT ENTER in 38 different languages, none of which was apparently English, and pro­ceeded to race up an escalator going down. 
Atop the escalator, the hapless student was fortunate enough to literally crawl off, hands on the platform and legs madly try­ing to join the hands. Of course, this attracted the attention of a nearby Big Mean Italian Guy, who proceeded to berate the student in 45 different lan­guages, apparently failing to recognize the big red shirt she was wearing saying "I AM AMERICAN," and so also failing to include English. By this time, the poor girl broke down in tears and asked ifshe couldn't just wrestle one of those really large hairy ani­mals that I'm not supposed to talk about. 
Now, you may ask what the moral ofthis story is, but really, it doesn't have one. Pore over it all you like and try to find the anti-w -oops, almost slipped -anti-con­flict logic that must surely be somewhere. let me know if you find any, since I'm too busy counting my oil company stock shares. 
But I digress. If I hadn't put all my money down on the NCAA Tournament, I'd bet you that no other newspaper in the world carried this story today. So, I'm your only source for the refreshing news that's oh-so-devoid of any and all comment about any and all conflicts that may or may not be going on in the world. 
It's a good thing everyone reads the paper at lunch, because those knives may be needed to cut yourself off a steaming pile of sarcasm. Hey, it sure beats Blazin' Sea Nuggets!

Campus leaders debate policy IRAQ 
By HELENA PAYNE 
Senior Staff Writer 
After the March 18, 2002 announcement that the administration had instituted a new alcohol policy, many students derided the decision, charg­ing that it would negatively alter residential hall life in a drastic way. 
Today, current and future resident assistants see the alcohol policy as "just another rule." 
In Dillon Hall, second-year RA Yogeld Andre said he has noticed fewer parties and a general willing­ness among residents to obey the new rules. 
"I thought I was going to have more trouble," Andre said, describing his original thoughts about enforcing the policy, which restricted tailgating, eliminated hard alcohol in the dorms and moved hall dances to outside venues. "It has caused us to be more alert, more vigilant and we have enforced it. But has it been hectic? Not really."

Despite some predictions that there would be a 
mass exodus by students to local apartment com­plexes, the Office of Residence Life and Housing showed a 1.7 percent increase in housing con­'tracts this year, indicating that many students plan 
to remain on campus. 
In addition, Residence Life received more RA 
applications than last year, up 12 percent at 320 
applications compared with last year's 286. 
"I think it's encouraging to know that students 
see a real value to living on campus," said assis­
tant vice president of Residence Life Bill Kirk."I 
don't think there's that much cause and effect with 
the housing numbers because of the alcohol poli­
cy," Kirk said. 
As for the roughly 20 percent of students that 
live off campus, Kirk said the University antici­
pates that percentage each year. 
"We need students to [move off campus]. We 
don't have enough housing on campus," Kfrk said.

mortars were spread over a large area. 
Elsewhere, U.S. troops met resistance from Iraqi units. The 7th Marine Infantry's 3rd Batallion apparently had to delay its foray into Iraq after -according to military radios -a large number of previous­ly unknown tanks was sighted on the Iraqi side of the border. 
The unit took small arms and artillery fire Thursday 

night, and at one point a U.S. 
Cobra helicopter accidentally 
fired a missile at a U.S. Ml 
Abrams tank, injuring one sol­
dier and forcing abandonment 
of the smoldering tank. Friday 
morning, the unit opened a 
massive artillery barrage 
across the border. 
In Iraq, Marines in the 1st 
Division opened fire with 
machine guns on an Iraqi T-55 
tank and destroyed it with a 
Javelin, a portable anti-tank 
missile. Troops from the 
Army's 3rd Infantry Division 
came into contact with several 
Iraqi armored personnel carri­
ers. destroying at least three of 
them, front line troops report­
ed by radio. 
There were no reports of 
U.S. casualties in the engage­ments. In northern Kuwait, a helicopter crashed Thursday, killing the four American crewmembers and 12 British troops on board. 
By taking southern Iraq, the allies would command access to the Gulf and set the stage for the first major conquest on the way to Baghdad -Basra, Iraq's second largest city, just 20 miles from the Kuwait bor­der. 
The move on the area between Basra and the Persian Gulf suggested that the allied strategy on the ground calls for a two-pronged attack -one to clear Iraqi resistance in the southern oil region while the other charges north toward Baghdad. 
The start of the advance into Iraq was signalled Thursday night by a thunderous artillery barrage by allied forces in northern Kuwait across the border. Infantrymen on the move, their weeks of waiting at an end, cheered as shells screamed overhead. 
The armored vehicles of the 1st Marine Division rolled across the border at around 9 
p.m. local time (1 p.m. EST). As they moved through the desert, burning oil wells were visible, spewing black smoke into skies lit by a nearly full moon .

Deitchley said that his office would have been liable if it had not responded to the tip about the party and a stu­dent was injured. 
"If we wouldn't have responded and a student had been hurt, we would have had a responsibility ... it is not that we are trying to bust a legitimate and legal party. That party was nowhere close to being legal. More people could have gotten hurt," Deitchley said. 
Bill Kirk, assistant vice president for Residence Life at the University, said that his office did not contact Excise Police before the party, but would be contact­ing students arrested and cited at the party and others involved in planning the party. 
"When parties come to our attention as obviously and publicly as someone falling off a balcony or a party with 7 5 kegs [we will respond]." said Kirk. 
Kirk said that when his office hears rumors of such a large party, its first step is to contact students organizing the party, rather than police. 
"We try to contact students and tell them of the signifi­cant liability they have with such a large party. When we hear a rumor of a party with 75 kegs, it is appropriate to respond," Kirk said. 
Deitchley said his office is still investigating the party and more arrests could be made. 
"If there is anyone else involved that needs to be charged, we will pursue them," he said. Deitchley encouraged students plan­ning to host such a party in the future to obtain the nec­essary permits through the Alcohol and Tobacco Commission. 
"In the future, it would be better for everyone involved, if there are going to be par­ties. that organizers take steps to ensure that they are legal. My office is glad to assist anyone with getting the right information," Deitchley said.

Hall senators said flaws still existed in the policy and have been communicating with rectors on the Campus Life Council in order to draft a resolution to bring back in­hall dances.

IRAQ 
U.S. chopper crashes on invasion day, 16 killed 
Associated Press 
SOUTHERN IRAQ 

American and British combat units rumbled across the desert into Iraq from the south Thursday and bombed limited targets in Baghdad. But military commanders withheld the mas­sive onslaught that would signal all-out war as U.S. officials tried to talk the Iraqi regime into giv­ing up. 
Coalition forces suffered their first casualties in a helicopter crash that left 12 Britons and four Americans dead. 
"The days of the Saddam Hussein regime are numbered," Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld predicted, although he also said there was "no need for a broader conflict" if Iraqi leaders surrender. 
On the second day of Operation Iraqi Freedom, American officials held out the tantalizing possibility that Saddam had been killed in the initial Wednesday night bomb­ing of Baghdad. 
State-run Iraqi television said Saddam survived, and met with his top aides to counter the U.S.-led attack. 
"We are resolved to teach the criminal invaders hard lessons and make them taste painful punishment," declared the Iraqi military. 
The onset of war sparked anti-war demonstrations across the country -more than 1,000 were arrested in San Francisco -and at U.S. embassies around the world. The State Department warned U.S. citi­zens abroad of an increased danger of terrorism. 
Rumsfeld hinted that talks with Iraqi military elements, including some in the elite Republican Guard, may have been behind a delayed start to a planned massive aerial assault. 
"We still hope" the Iraqi lead­ership can be replaced "without the full force and fury of a war," Rumsfeld said after meet­ing with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. 
Rep. Robert Andrews, D-N.J., said following a House briefing with Rumsfeld that "the behavior of those who've not surrendered would suggest that they might." 
In southern Iraq, white light glowed in the desert sky, and the sound of explosions could be heard from across the Kuwait-Iraq frontier as the 3rd Infantry Division unleashed an artillery barrage. Troops eager to cross the border into Iraq cheered -and units were soon on their way.

Iraq sent missiles toward Protecting the oil-rich Basra Kuwait in retaliation for the region was one of the American pre-dawn attack against military's goals as Marines and Saddam, and American officials Army special forces headed into said the Iraqis had set fire to Iraq. 
The Iraqi missiles landed harmlessly in the Kuwaiti desert. Officials said none of the Iraqi missiles caused injuries, and one was intercepted by a Patriot missile. 
Hundreds arrested in rowdy anti-war demonstrations 
Associated Press 
Galvanized by the American attack on Iraq, anti-war activists around the coun­try set off their own barrage of street protests. chaining themselves together, blocking workers and traffic, walking out of classes and parading in mock chemical suits. Hundreds were arrested from San Francisco to Washington. D.C. 
But the anti-war groundswell brought out thousands of counterdemonstrators. One in Mississippi carried a sign saying, "Support the U.S. or keep your mouth shut." 
Thursday was one of the heaviest days of anti-government protesting in years. "This is no ordinary day," said Jason 
Mark, a San Francisco activist. "America is different today: We've just launched an unprovoked, unjust war." 
One protester in a rope and harness committed suicide by letting himself fall from Golden Gate Bridge as police tried to coax him to safety. 
San Francisco had some of the largest anti-war activity, hobbling the morning commute. Thousands in roving bands temporarily took control of some down­town streets and closed several exits from the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Smaller splinter groups broke windows, heaved debris into streets and occasionally scuffied with police. Some protesters hurled rocks at trains, briefly halting service at a station in nearby Oakland. 
Police wearing helmets and carrying nightsticks made more than 500 arrests. 
"We don't want to alienate people. I hope people realize that political murder merits action that inconveniences them," said protester Quinn Miller, who took the day off from his job for a bank­ing company. 
Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca encouraged protesters to forgo civil dis­obedience, saying it might sap police resources needed to keep watch for ter­rorism. 
In Washington, dozens of activists temporarily shut down inbound lanes of a Potomac River crossing, holding up the morning commute. Outside the White House, about 50 stood in chilly rain and shouted, "No blood for oil!" 

About 300 protesters rallied in the evening. 
Anti-war activists in Philadelphia. blocked entrances to the downtown fed­eral building, forcing police to detour motorists away from the area. 
Police arrested 107 protesters. 
In New York, about 350 rallied at Union Square and 300 later at Times Square under a steady drizzle. 
About a dozen students lay down in black garbage bags. "We're expressing how the Iraqis are being killed for no reason," said Rachel Klepner, 14, who left class at Beacon High School for the protest. 
In Massachusetts, students and profes­sors walked out of college classes around the state in protest of war. 
WORLD NEWS BRIEF 
Crash causes first U.S.-British casualties 
A U.S. Marine helicopter crashed in Kuwait Thursday, killing all 16 American and British soldiers aboard, military officials said. 
The crash of the CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter kiUed 12 British and four U.S. soldiers, officials said. The helicopter was assigned to the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force. 
The helicopter crashed at 7:37 p.m. EST -Friday morning in Kuwait -about nine miles away from the border with Iraq, military officials said. The cause of the crash is under investigation, the officials said, adding that hostile fire had not been reported in the area. 
The Marines use the Sea Knight, a bus-like heli­copter with two large rotors, to fly troops from ships at sea or base camps to forward positions. 
The Navy and Marines grounded all 291 CH-46 heli­copters in August after an inspection of one helicopter in North Carolina found a crack in a rotor assembly. 
A Marine Corps CH-46 crashed in 2001, killing three Marines and injuring two.

Twisters rip through rural Ga., 6 dead 
Tornadoes killed six people and injured about 200 Thursday in rural southwestern Georgia, destroying dozens of homes. overturning farm equipment and ripping out trees like grass. 
"It looked like a big lawnmower went through there," said Sheriff Freddie Tompkins of Worth County, where a twister cut a 10-mile-long, 300­foot-wide swath. 
Officer recommends no courts-martial 
A military hearing officer Thursday recom­mended against court-martialing two U.S. pilots who killed four Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan last year in a friendly-fire bombing one of the men blamed on the "fog of war." 
Although Col. Patrick Rosenow said there was enough evidence to court-martial both pilots, he said "non-judicial or administrative punishment" would maintain "the interests of good order and discipline." 

Lawmakers condemn "under God" ban 
The House voted Thursday to condemn a federal appeals court's rulings that reciting the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools is unconstitutional because of its reference to God. 
The nonbinding resolution, passed 400-7 with 15 members voting present, states that the phrase "one nation under God" in the pledge reflects the reli­gious faith central to the founding of the nation and that its recitation is a patriotic act, not a statement of religious faith. 
Former NRA lawyer to testify for NAACP 
A former gun lobbyist has agreed to testify for the NAACP in a lawsuit alleging negligent marketing practices by gun manufacturers and distributors fuels street violence that victimizes minorities.

and Iraq over allegations of pos­session of weapons of mass destruction, many Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students have taken a proactive stance on the issue. Students attended lec­tures and panel discussions held on both campuses over the past few weeks and others organized protests against military action. 
The University announced Thursday a special prayer ser­vice and rosary that will take place Friday at 9 p.m. in the Basilica with Notre Dame President Edward Malloy pre­siding. Each Friday at 5:15 p.m. a Mass for peace will be hosted at the Basilica, and as long as the military action continues, a prayer service and rosary will be held in a different dorm each weekday. 
Many students could be seen wearing white armbands meant to symbolize their opinion against military action Thursday. The arm bands are available at the Center for Social Concerns under a project orga­nized by freshman Pete Quaranto and the Peace Coalition. Many of the students wearing the bands had decorat­ed them with peace signs or other messages. Gonzalez was wearing a band with the phrase "paz y justicia" -"peace and justice" in Spanish -inscribed on it. 
Despite differences in opinion, many students said that it was important to be supportive of the U.S. armed forces. 
"I definitely think our troops still need our support and our prayers," Gonzalez said.

European bank ready to intervene 
The European Central Bank said Thursday it was prepared to intervene to support European financial markets if war in Iraq threatens stability, hinting at a possible rate cut or money infusion into the banking sys­tem. 
The bank ..stands ready to act if neces­sary," according to a three-paragraph state­ment issued after a meeting of its governing council in Frankfurt. 
"Financial markets can rely on the provi­sion of sufficient liquidity even under excep­tional circumstances, as was demonstrated in the past," the statement said. 
Insurers to cancel Mideast policies 
As they seek financial shelter from war in Iraq, insurers are expected to cancel their riskiest policies in the Middle East shortly after the bombing begins. 
By taking that step, insurers will be able to limit their exposure to losses caused by the war's destruction. In other instances, the cancellations open the door for insurers to offer customers a new policy at a significantly higher price to reflect the perils posed by the war. 
"High-risk policies like this have to be indi­vidually negotiated," said Craig Berrington, general counsel for the American Insurance Association, a major trade group represent­ing property and casualty carriers.

ALCove holds open house for students 
By NICOIA BUNICK News Writer 
The AL.Cove, the College of Arts and Letters' experimental gather­ing place for students and faculty in 0'Shaughnessy Hall, held an open house Thursday in an attempt to familiarize more students with its services. 
The lounge provides space for students to study or meet with fac­ulty in an informal setting. Assistant Professor of Psychology and Arts and Letters Undergraduate Adviser Kathleen Kolberg, whose office is located in the ALCove, described the facility as "an experiment." 
"It's a temporary use of space where students can sit down and do work. There is also space for [teaching assistants or professors] to hold discussion sections, review sessions and office hours," she said. 
The AL.Cove also provides many resource materials to undergradu­ate students such as GRE, LSAT and MCAT study guides. 
"Now there is space for students to actually spread out and look at these materials," Kolberg said. "We also plan to use the ALCove to highlight the Arts and Letters expe­rience." 
The center is currently displaying student artwork and posters applauding the achievements of the University's Pre-Law mock trial team. 
The idea of providing a space such as the ALCove was originally suggested by Assistant Dean Jennifer Nemecek. 
"There is a lack ofspace on cam­pus for people to just be." Nemececk said. 
The rooms of 102 and 105 O'Shaughnessy Hall, where the ALCove is now located, originally housed the college's Office of Undergraduate Studies, which moved to a renovated space early in the semester. Although the ALCove officially opened in January, students have only recently begun to utilize the facility. 
"It has been sparsely used, but in the last few weeks [use] has picked up," said Kolberg. Students who know about the ALCove are gener­ally enthusiastic about the facility. But it appears that many are unaware that it exists. 
"Now that I know about it, I would consider using it," freshman Gena Robinson said. 
Robinson had seen advertise­ments for the ALCove, but until Thursday did not realize its pur­pose. 
Thursday's open house was part of the Department of Arts and Letters' attempt to make students more aware that ALCove is there for their use. Both Nemecek and Kolberg said that the department advertised on campus with posters and newspaper ads in hopes that more students and faculty will make use ofthe new space.

Chamber music festival at SMC 
By lAUREN O'BRIEN 
News Writer 
The Department of Music at Saint Mary's College will host its inaugural Leighton Festival of Chamber music this weekend, featuring per­formances by two local and one international chamber ensembles, '­
The local ensembles, Fleur de Lys and the South Bend Chamber Singers, will join the Cavani String Quartet from the Cleveland Institute of Music to round out the fes­tival schedule. 
The world-renowned Quartet, which was awarded the prestigious Naumburg Chamber Music Award in 1989 and has performed at venues such as Carnegie Hall, will be in residence at the College from March 21 through March 2 5, during which time they will rehearse and present a concert with Saint Mary's music students. 
"This level of exposure to such gifted and experienced performers raises the bar," said Nancy Menk, chair of the College's Department of Music, in a press release. "It illustrates how far you can go with potential and hard work, and offers a model of professionalism at its best." 
Festival organizers said that they hope that the resi­dency of a chamber music ensemble will provide a unique opportunity for stu­dents and faculty in Saint Mary's music department,

300th execution carried out in Texas 
Associated Press 
HUNTSVILLE, Texas 

An apologetic killer 
Thursday became the 300th 
inmate put to death in Texas 
since the state resumed the 
death penalty 20 years ago. 
Keith Clay, 35, who gunned 
down a convenience store 
clerk during a 1994 robbery, 
prayed softly to himself as he 
was executed by injection. He 
was pronounced dead at 6:23 
p.m. 
Clay asked for forgiveness 
from three members of his 
victim's family, who watched 
through a nearby window. 
"I know you have suffered a great loss and I am truly, truly sorry," he told the fami­ly of Melathethil Tom Varughese. 
Clay also asked God to "for­give me of every single soli­tary sin I have committed." 
Turning to his mother, he said, "Let everyone know that I love them. This is not good­bye. I will see you later." 
Cynthia Smith smiled and flashed two thumbs up to him. 
Clay was the 11th inmate executed this year in Texas, which is on a pace to surpass the record 40 lethal injec­tions it carried out in 2000. Another execution is sched­uled for next week. 
It took nearly 13 years for Texas to reach 100 exP.r.11­
tions, four years to get to No. 
200 and now just over three 
to reach the 300th. 
The state accounts for more 
than one-third of the 838 
executions in the United 
States since 1976, when the 
death penalty resumed under 
a Supreme Court ruling. 
Virginia is second with 87. 
Clay was convicted of 
killing Varughese during a 
robbery in Baytown. near 
Houston. Varughese had 
come to the United States 
from India a year earlier. 
Clay had said he was out­
side the store in a car when 
Varughese was killed, but a 
witness identified Clay as the 
gunman and evidence showed 
his gun was one of the two 
used in the shooting. 
'Tm not happy to see some­one put to death, but I know that the trial was a fair trial," said Marie Munier, who pros­ecuted Clay. "I think it's jus­tice." 
Prosecutors also linked Clay to the fatal shootings of three people, including two chil­dren, on Christmas Eve in 1993. He denied any role in the killings and was not tried, but a companion was sent to death row for the crime. 
The Supreme Court refused to review Clay's case last week. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles refused to consider a clemency request because it was filed late.

QUOTE OF THE DAY 
..Never in the field ofhuman conflict was so much owed by so many to so few ... 
Sir Winston Churchill British prime minister 
I am writing in response to Joe Muto's Wednesday column. As we all know by now, the war in Iraq has begun, and we are now in a time of heightened tension both abroad and on our own soil. In his column Muto states that should the draft be reinstated, he would be "in 
draft dodger." 
He then goes on to say that he expresses con­cern for his friends in ROTC and equates going to the Boat Oub and female donns to being on the front lines. Personally, I am appalled at his comparisons, even if he meant it to be taken as a joke. I am currently a senior in ROTC, and ifI were to do it all over again, I would sign up without question. In taking my ROTC scholarship, my goal was not merely to get a "free education" as he said, but to attend an outstanding university and then have the privilege ofserving my country upon grad­uation. 
The tuition payments and stipends came as an added benefit for me and were not the sole motivating factors, as many think. I joined the military out ofa love for my country, a sense ofduty to upholding the values on which it was established and so that others who do not want to fight do not have to. Muto will be happy to know that he will probably not have to dodge the draft because there are many people will­ing to make the supreme sacrifice. 
Our volunteer military is strong enough to be able to combat many different cir­cumstances without the need to reinstitute the draft. He might also be pleased to know that ifthere were a draft, he would 
probably not be drafted since 18­
one else. I am sure he is sigh­ing in relief upon reading this. Yet while he is get­ting dollar bills pulled from his open fly, there 
will be many 18-year­old kids on the front­lines. 
The conditions in which they live in are something he cannot even fathom. Their 
lives are void ofshow­
ers and plush accom­modations. They have rations that many of us 
would consider to be far worse than anything we 
on a daily basis, most ofus would not do to our household pets. These are kids, some of whom have to live on food stamps because they get paid less and work more than anyone you probably know. 
Some ofthese kids don't even have a high school education; yet they are willing to make the supreme sacrifice in defense oftheir country and its values. 
Don't get me \\Tong -I personally wel­come any and all criticisms. The freedom of speech and assembly guarantee that Americans can express their beliefs, and I fully support anyone to do so whatever it may be. However, do not presume, even in jest, to begin to understand what it is like 

to be one of those kids on the frontlines. I personally have never experienced it myself, but many who have served have managed to give me the smallest idea of what it is like. To question the bravery of those who are there at this present time is utterly appalling. 
Those brave Iraqi troops Muto talked about are surrendering left and right at this moment, and the last sight of the vaunted Iraqi Republican Guard by our troops was when they were running away from American forces in the first GulfWar. Feel free to criticize the decisions to go to war and the way in which leaders conduct the war as it is your right to do, but do not insult those men and women who are cur­rently staring down a situation which you will never even come close to experienc­ing. 
The sacrifice they make on a daily basis is more than you may ever make in your life. So when you see your ROTC friends next, tell them that you are praying for them and their families, and give them support that they probably need right now. At this point, I am going to listen to my Commander-in-Chief address the nation. I am prepared to follow the decision that he and the leadership he represents make in regards to my role in the conflict. I ask that we all pray for everyone involved and pray for a swift conclusion in order to minimize the cost to everyone involved.

Taking the "French'' out ·of our fries 
Diplomacy has had its day, at least for now. As this column is being written in the early hours of the morning, Saddam Hussein is speaking live in response to the United States' opening strike against him, one of the "targets of opportunity." What has happened to our diplomatic efforts at the United Nations which have spawned some conservative 
U.S. congressmen to change the name of French toast and French fries to "Freedom·~ toast and fries? 
The globalization of economies and communications may have shrunk the Earth, but the nations of the world are as divergent as the political divide in the United States. Our nation is composed of two ways of life, best evident as the blue and red states depicted during the 2000 presidential elec­tion. In general, the east and west coasts, along with several traditionally industrial states believe that diplomacy should con­tinue. The heartland and south believe that the Bush doctrine of preemptive action is one that justifies war with Iraq. 
Internationally, most of the larger nations of the world, especially those located closer to Iraq, fall in the diplomacy column. Follo\\>ing the United States attack on Iraq, several criticized the president's actions. German Chancellor Gerhard 

Gary Caruso 
Capitol Comments 

Schroeder said that the U.N. Security 
Council has not failed to act. that U.N. 
Resolution 1441, passed unanimously last fall, did not specifically authorize military action and that a war with Iraq is illegal. 
French President Jacques Chirac said that France has unfairly been singled out as the cause of a U.S. failure to muster a majority of votes to pass a second U.N. res­olution authorizing military action, espe­cially in light of Russia and China's opposi­tion. Russia and China both strongly con­demned the U.S. strikes on Iraq. 
Some contend that a full scale military assault on Iraq is not necessary, especially in light of the "target of opportunity" preci­sion during the first U.S. attack. They say that the president could have zeroed in on Hussein during the past few months and removed him without much collateral damage in a surgical manner made famous by the Israelis. They also believe that an impatient, diplomatically uninter­ested president became frustrated at the United Nations and simply took his ball and went home. 
European-bashing in the United States has focused on France more than other nations who also \-\ield veto power in the 
U.N. Security Council. Americans remind the French that the United States saved them twice in two world wars and that the French should be appreciative. American conservative commentators belittle France by saying that the French can only feel important by using their veto power because they are no longer a major power in the world. 
The diplomatic stalemate at the United Nations arose because President George 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Hope for a fresh 
start for the 
Iraqi people 
The day has finally arrived that the debate has ended and war in Iraq is upon us. I am not a sup­porter of war, but at the same time I support deci­sive action by President George W. Bush. I am not happy what this may do to our international rela­tions, and I do not rejoice in violence. 
However, since the debate about the war is over, I believe the issue now lies with our responsibility to rebuild this country. Although the clouds of war seem to encompass almost everything at this time, we must look to the future of what can be done. A few weeks of bombing will be nothing compared to 12 years of sanctions the Iraqis have lived through under the current regime. Yes, war is never a cake walk, but imagine the fresh start Iraq will gain from this war. 
France and Germany would not be able to com­plain about the freedoms they enjoy today without 
U.S. aid and military influence. Just imagine the potential this new regime would be able to offer its people having the second largest oil reserves in the world. They will not have to worry about a regime that would rather play games with the international community than benefit its people. Once a broadly representative government of the people is estab­lished with U.S. assistance, there will be hope for future generations of Iraqis whether they be Kurd, Shiite or Sunni.

Bush and the international community play by two diametrically opposed styles of politics. Bush is a self-described "instinct player." He decides on a course of action, moves forward without vacillation, dis­misses those who oppose him and feels obliged to enforce his decisions. He views changes in policy as a sign of weakness and is not interested in what he calls ..small talk in big rooms." As a result, he is labeled a "cowboy." The reference is not only a play on his Texas roots but symbolic of the way he will confront his political adversaries with "high noon" drama. 
Rather than use traditional diplomatic protocol procedures to work out disputes with France, Germany, China and Russia behind closed doors at the United Nations, Bush challenged them publicly. Then Bush challenged the United Nations to prove its relevance by endorsing an Iraqi war, but in the final week before abandoning his efforts he attempted to use diplomatic pro­tocol. Bush also made public the terms of many of his foreign aid offers, Turkey most notably. which caused that govern­ment much domestic embarrassment. 
Ronald Reagan stood firm on his tax reduction proposal of the early '80s, but appeared larger than life when he admit­ted two years later that he needed to "adjust" them to achieve his goals. Richard Nixon, the fiercest American opponent of Communism, displayed diplomatic finesse when he opened Communist China to western markets and the international community. 
To the international community, Bush seems to be unwilling to engage in issues of interest to others while demanding adherence to his agenda. During Bush's 

first year in office, he irritated nations 
around the world when he withdrew from 
the Kyoto Protocol agreement to slow 
global warming, abandoned the Anti­
Ballistic Missile nuclear test ban treaty, 
walked away from involvement in the 
Israeli-Palestinian talks and refused to at 
least acknowledge matters of great rele­
vance to other nations . 
American isolation has been slowly self­inflicted. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer complained that alliance partners are not satellites of the United States. He explained that allies should not be viewed as an option, "being with us or against us," but should be nurtured through dialogue. Had the president found time for such small talk in the large U .N. Security room, even the most difficult of countries like France, which was willing to compromise on a final 30-day benchmark process for inspectors, may have abstained rather than vetoed his propos­als. 
It is anyone's guess how U.S. military power will be received overseas. But for the record, French toast is an American invention from upstate New York by a man named French. Maybe his middle name was Freedom.

War 'protects U.S. oil interests 
As Operation Persian Gulf War II becomes official, I am becoming more and more disturbed by the speed at which those misguided individuals in sup­port of this war are labeling those in protest against it "unpatriotic." This country was founded on the principles of freedom of expression, opinion and thought. I find upholding my First Amendment rights as an American citizen to be decidedly patri­otic. 
The Bush Administration has further destroyed foreign relations by ignoring our allies in the United Nations. This reckless disregard is only going to strengthen the world's view of the United States as a tyrant country eager for power -sentiments that played heavily in the tragic attacks on Sept. 11. I have no desire to have my name used in any con­junction with this battle based upon oil, money and greed and therefore vocally protest it because I want to let it be known that I in no way support this war. 
I cried along with every other American citizen on Sept. 11; however it is the nature of terrorists to be without country. Though few Iraqis shed tears the day the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were brutally attacked by a handful of vicious cowards. this does not change the fact that Iraq as a country cannot be held directly responsible. This war is not about getting justice. And it is most certainly not about liberating the Iraqi people, as the Bush Administration continues to claim. 
With war, poverty, death and destruction rampant worldwide, it seems an unusual coincidence that Bush has suddenly turned his attentions to the suf­ferings of those living in oil-rich Iraq. Why there­fore, is he intent on liberating people who have no wish to be liberated? As bombs rain down on the five million people living in Baghdad, it seems unlikely that the innocent civilians caught in the crossfire are dying praising the United States for its help. No, this war is about boosting flagging popu­larity and hiding a struggling economy while finish­ing off the hunt for oil that George H. W. Bush start­ed a decade ago. And I am interested to see how Bush will pay the billions of dollars this war will and has already cost, especially in light of his inten­tions to further cut taxes for all his rich friends. 

No one has attempted to deny that Saddam Hussein is an evil dictator, but Bush has yet to make any worthwhile claim as to why it is imperative to the American people that he be removed from power. The United States has more nuclear weapons than any other country in the world. Hussein has been in power long enough to realize that any direct attack he makes on the United States or our allies would be tantamount to suicide. Furthermore, not being able to prove that Iraq does not have weapons of mass destruction is not proof that it does. 
Bush and the media hide behind terms such as "collateral damage" and "friendly fire," relying on the American people's ignorance to hide the truth of war. Though I do not support this war I most cer­tainly support the men and women who are fighting it. These are people years younger than I am, in a strange land far away from home, clutching assault rifles and gas masks as they prepare to battle for a president sitting thousands of miles away from the battlefields. 
War is about blood and sweat and pain and mis­ery, and we as Americans wave our flags and beam with pride as we sing the Star Spangled Banner. completely oblivious to what is happening outside of our tightly constructed bubbles. Yet we continue to drive our SUVs to our climate-controlled homes, where we sit down in front of big screen TVs and watch this war unfold, scoffing at the foolishness of those who still believe in peace. 
You may call me un-American, but I stand firm to my belief that peace is more patriotic than blind submission to an inept president. Bush goes on national television and mispropounces Baghdad while people who could not find Iraq on a map to save their lives mumble about killing them all and letting God do the counting. Get a smaller car ­maybe then we can stop killing Middle Easterners for their oil.

The Humor Artists, or HA, are known for their stand-up comedy and improv. So when they put on a show, you know that you're going to be leaving with a stomach sore from laughing so hard. An independent play, written by Molly McShane and Mike Davin, is called "Black beard, For Instance," but Molly is afraid that title could be misleading. 
"I worry people will think its about pirates when it's clearly not," she says with a huge smile on her face. 
It may not be about pirates, but the show is able to take a number of every­day things and add a sense of comedy and craziness to it that just lets you find everything funny. 
The show opens as three couples and two guys who are "just friends" prepare at their respective homes to get ready for a dinner party. Immediately the audience is able to pick up on the quirks and foibles that make each character larger than life and drenched in laugh potential. The characters develop almost like a stand-up comedians routine, each presenting themes and ideas, like a mortal wound inflicted by a contact lens. With an engagement to celebrate and a friend's dead dog to hide under the excuse that it was "dog-napped". it makes the dinner conversation a little strained as the guests begin to realize that their host's new fiance has some­thing to hide. One suggestion for solving the dog-napping case? A re-enactment of the whole thing, complete with props, villains, the dog played by one of the guests and theme music provided by another. Because the dog was killed and not dog-napped, the whole thing doesn't yield much answers, but it is ridiculous to watch as they trip over themselves trying to figure out what happened to the dog.

Humor Artists painfully funny 
The Notre Dame Humor Artists perform an original play, "Black beard, For Instance" 

It does come to light that the dog was accidentally killed, and subsequently stored in the freezer, and the engage­ment is broken with the fiance ostra­cized by the rest of the group. Prior to intermission, the fiance seems to be the only island in an ocean of craziness and the audience is able to appreciate his standpoint as an outsider looking in on a group of pretty zany characters. He, too, dives in to the madness after intermis­sion as he writes his own re-enactment of the dinner that night and tries to express himself to the rest of the guests. The show isn't more than an hour and a half, but that time is filled vyith more laughs per minute than any sitcom or stand-up act. 
The comedic themes in the show are broad and diverse, with a sample of top­ics from many different realms. Just a few of the ideas brought to light are online dating, the peril of wearing con­tact lenses, a real live ambiguously gay duo, the horrors of marriage and more. At times it is almost like watching a comedian like Jerry Seinfeld comment­ing on a slew of different things that are really funny if you think about them. But this show takes it a step further. Rather than just tell you why these ideas are funny, they blow them up, distort them and put them in the spotlight you can see an up close and personal look at how funny life really is. Truly, this show is able to show a really complete idea of what a classic comedy is, not dwelling on any one f pisode or problem, but a number of different ones for each char­acter, allowing there to never be a dull moment. 
How do you cast a show that imple­ments so many methods of approaching comedy? Simple. Get some of the best and the brightest performers on campus that are able to boast excellent comedic timing and a sense of character develop­ment that makes you wonder if this is how these people act in real life. The 
comedic archetypes are standard, but developed and displayed with a fresh air that makes the jokes and lines funny and new. As one character comments during the show, "Everyone is a little crazy." Watching these performers, one has to wonder if they got more than their share. Trish Gilbert and Mike Frederico play a married couple, Jacqueline and Richard, brought togeth­er by a mix-up between mistaken preg­nancy and gastrointestinal problems. Frederico's classic style makes him seem refined and developed as an actor, but putting a drink in his hand and letting him constantly bash his wife offers a contrast that is at times more one liners than character development but it's always fun to see what rude comment he'll make next. Gilbert seems to jump back and forth between socialite and resident at an asylum, but does so com­fortably enough that both seem natural­ly a part of the same character. Michael Bradt and Mary Beth Assumen are also married, though their relationship is not as focused as Frederico and Gilbert. Their parts, Michael and Allison respec­tively, are much more focused on the whereabouts of their dog and getting some "who-ha." Michael is a great meathead; with his dim attitude and love of the gym, he adds an element of awkwardness that is entertaining to watch. One of the running gags is the unclear relationship between Tim and Jim, played by Tom Conner and Jeff Eyerman, who don't seem to know their own sexual orientation better than any­one else. But with physical humor and emotional responses to accusations, they are the perfect odd couple. Cheryl Turski is very emotional as the hostess of the party, but her enthusiasm for her fiance and putting on a good dinner party gives her lots of opportunity to make the crowd laugh -an opportunity she likes to take advantage of. Rick Herbst, as the fiance, gives the audience a character to relate to, but when he sinks into the insanity himself later in the show, it is almost disappointing that 

we didn't get to see him have the chance to be just as zany before. He holds noth­ing back and is hilarious to watch. 
The show is well written, full of the best kind of situational humor and one­liners. \'\Then not killing someone's dog is a compliment, you know that you're in for something pretty off the wall. Add a cast with comedic timing that rivals Must See TV and you know you're in for a night of fun and, above all, laughing until it hurts. 
The Humor Artists will perform "Black beard, For Instance," an independent play written by Molly McShane and Mike Davin, Saturday night at 7:30 p.m. in the LaFortune Ballroom. Tickets are $5 at the door.

Award. Those interested in attending a master class given by the group should stop by the Band Building this Saturday, at 3:30 pm. 
Ma, of the Shanghai Traditional Chinese Music Orchestra, is considered one of the finest erhu performers in the world. She has showcased her pure and sweet tone, technical virtuosity and nuanced playing in the United States, Canada, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao and elsewhere. Her prolific output includes appearances on over 30 CD's, and somehow she has still managed to give over a hundred recitals, while even making time for the occasional lecture concert. Alongside famed cellist Yo-yo Ma, she was also featured in the score for the romantic comedy and martial arts film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. 
But what, in the name of all that is good and sacred, is an erhu? The erhu is a stringed instrument evolved from the huqin family of fiddle-like instruments, and dates back to 11th-century China, during the Sung dynasty. Since the early 20th century, thanks largely to Liu Tanhua, the erhu has seen much innova­tion: its silk strings swapped for steel, its one-and-a-half octave range nearly dou­bled. 
So by now it should be supremely clear both shows promise a novel, colorful and rewarding musical experience. I)) other words, there had better be more than Crowley regulars filling seats. The first show, Ma's recital, will be held Saturday at 6 p.m. in the Jordan Auditorium. Tickets will be sold at the entrance: $3 for students, $4 for adults, and $6 for families. NEXUS will hold their concert Sunday at 2 p.m. in the Annenberg Auditorium. Tickets are already available at the LaFortune Box Office, priced between $3 and $10.

Musical acts brighten weekend 
Ma Xiahui and NEXUS to perform world-renowned compositions

Spring break, along with its shenani­gans, is behind us and tense times for the United States lies ahead. Yes, it is high time to buoy spirits, and through what better way than music? 
Luckily, this weekend boasts two 
unique performances: Saturday, world­

comprising "the high priests of the per­cussion world." Their eclectic repertoire runs the gamut, rang­ing from ragtime and world music to contemporary pieces, along with group improv and their own composi­tions. Perhaps more eclectic is their choice of instruments, which includes not only xylo­phones, marim­bas, and, of course, drums, but also com­mon household items. They've toured the world, played with several orchestras, appeared on TV and garnered a bevy of awards, including the Toronto Arts 

Taildaters under the Dorne 
NMCP sponsors an interracial dating forum at Notre Dame 
By CHRISTIE BOLSEN 
Assistant Scene Editor 
As magical as Notre Dame is, there are two big thorns in the side of Our Lady. One of them is the prickly problem of diversity, or lack thereof, and how to address the homogenous appearance of campus. The second pervasive issue and source of many students' lamentations is gender relations. or lack thereof, and how to force healthy relationships on the two sexes. 
These issues spark discussion on touchy subjects such as affirmative action, parietals and coed housing, but one look around campus shows that none of these solutions, right or wrong, will solve the two problems. 
I lowever, an experiment in interracial dating has fun with what can be strained interactions between races or sexes on campus. Sponsored by the NAACP, which sponsors a dating forum every year, this year's organizers set up participants on dates and then moni­
i..Jor~d them a la reality shows such as Blind Date. The daters were paired up based on information provided in ques­tionnaires, responses in interviews, whether they had been on an interracial date before and then on race. 
"When talking about diversity in the world it seems like interracial dating is still extremely taboo in some places," Charee Holloway, one of the organizers of the event, said. ''\,Ve wanted to do something to spark some discussion among students about the issue of inter­racial dating." 
While those behind the event were unsure how much interest would be generated for the forum, the response was excellent. About 80 applicants filled out surveys to participate, and the reac­tion was very positive. 
After people were given dates, they were informed of where they were going. Most of the lucky couples went on classic first dates like dinner or a movie, with the not as conventional addition of a camera capturing their date on film. The participants were taped before, during and after their dates, and it is this footage that will be viewed by the daters and the audience at the Forum. 
"Hopefully, we'll have a good audience and we can have a really great discus­sion about issues related to interracial dating on campus and elsewhere," Holloway said. 
Last year's forum focused on a per­spective all students identified with ­the effects of music on relationships. This year's president, Teresa \Vyatt, wanted to keep with the tradition of finding a familiar topic to bring students together, but had an idea for a new twist. 
"I wanted to challenge the Notre Dame student body to break out of their com­fort zones and scrutinize their own social and familial relationships. My desire is for students to walk away from this event and learn something valu­able," Wyatt said. 
While there are plenty of complaints about gender relations or lack of diversi­ty, as well as speculation on the most appropriate and effective cures for these problems. Wyatt thinks this is. a unique approach because it exposes students to an opportunity to actually experience the topics of discussion. 

"The philosophy of learning which I subscribe to is Haggard's approach. He says learning is a change in behavior as a result of experience. What better way to learn about another race, ethnicity or culture than to share the experience of dating?" Wyatt said. 
While those who attend the forum will be entertained in the way that only real­ity television can entertain, there is a deeper message in this than in "Joe Millionaire" or "The Bachelorette." It is not only fun, but serves a more educa­tional purpose as well. 
"I hope that those involved and who attend this forum realize that discrimi­nation does not solely harm one group, but inadvertently, it affects all of us,'' Wyatt said. "Starting with each one of us, a great change can occur on this campus, as well as the world."

Washington officials pre­sented research that a team in the nation's capital would not hurt the Baltimore Orioles, who play at Camden Yards, about 40 miles away.

MENS LACROSSE 
No. 11 Irish hit the road 
Special to The Observer 
The mens lacrosse team will look to snap a two-game losing streak with two games this weekend in Hempstead, 
N.Y. The Irish, currently 3-2 on the season, are ranked 11th in both the USILA and Warrior/Inside Lacrosse polls this week. 
Notre Dame will be facing its sixth straight ranked opponent when the Irish meet the Pride Friday. Notre Dame has played one of the nation's toughest schedules as the Irish have played five ranked opponents to date. 
Hofstra enters Friday's contest with a 2-2 record and is ranked, while Harford is 2-1. Both the Pride and Hawks are members of the America East Conference. 
After starting the season 3-0, Notre Dame has dropped its last two contests. Notre Dame;s most recent setback was a 9-8 loss at home to Loyola. Notre Dame has posted two road wins this season -at Penn State 10-9 and at North Carolina 10-8. 
The Irish are led in scoring by junior Matt Howell's 11 goals and 11 assists. Howell has become an offensive threat for Notre Dame every time he handles the ball. He played in just three games last season because of an injury. Freshman Patrick Walsh stands second in the scoring colum with seven goals and seven assists, while last season's top scorer, junior Dan Berger has scored 11 goals. 
Another rookie, Matt Karweck is also among the team's scoring leaders with six goals and one assist. 
Notre Dame's defensive unit has been solid this season with a 9.00 goals against average. The Irish boast great experience with two-year starter Eric Simon and Mickey Blum. 
Stewart Crosland has started all five games in goal for the Irish. He has played all but two of a possible 300 minutes and owns a 9.06 goals against average and .609 save percentage. 
Hostra is 2-2 on the season and is coming off of an 18-5 loss to Princeton. The Pride is tied for 15th in this week's USILA poll and is ranked 14th in the Warrior/Inside Lacrosse ranking. Hofstra opened up the season with a 10-4 loss against Loyola in the season opener and then came back to post wins over Binghamton 15-5 and Cornell 13-5. 

Hartford owns a 2-1 record following its most recent outing as it posted a 15­9 victory over Holy Cross. The Hawks earned a 6-5 win against Marist in their season opener and dropped a 9-3 deci­sion on the road at Harvard. 
The Irish will face off against the Pride Friday at 7:30 p.m. and then will meet the Hartford Hawks on Sunday at noon.

IN BRIEF 
Artest suspended again for 
flagrant foul 
Another flagrant foul, another sus­pension for Ron Artest. 
The Indiana Pacers' swingman was banned for two games Thursday, raising the total of games he's missed because of NBA punishment this season to 10. 
This time, the league upheld a fla­grant foul call on Artest just five sec­onds into Wednesday night's game against Boston, calling for an auto­matic two-game suspension for exceeding the limit on flagrant-foul points. 
Boston's Paul Pierce went up for a layup after the opening tip and was slapped hard on the head from behind by Artest. As the referees sig­naled a flagrant foul, Artest stood impassively with his arm raised above his head. 
It was the eighth flagrant foul called against Artest this season. He has been suspended twice already for exceeding the five-point limit on flagrant-foul points. Artest will be suspended two games for every fla­grant foul for the rest of the season. 
He also was suspended by the Pacers for one game this season for smashing a framed picture of himself after a home loss. 
Artest loses about $21,000 in salary every game he's forced to sit out. 
In early January, Artest was sus­pended for three games without pay and fined $35,000 for hurling a tele­vision monitor and smashing a cam­era after a loss in New York. 
Later that month, he was suspend­ed for four games without pay for a run-in with Heat coach Pat Riley and for flashing an obscene gesture toward the crowd in Miami. 
One of the league's best defenders, and averaging 15.2 points and 2.17 steals, Artest is testing the patience of his teammates with his suspen­sions. 

Defendents sentenced in 
betting scandal 
The mastermind behind the betting scam that nearly produced a $3 mil­lion payoff at the Breeders' Cup ended up with the least amount of jail time possible -a year and a day. 
Computer programmer Chris Harn, who worked for a company that processes horse racing bets, could have received more than seven years in prison if he had not helped authorities, Judge Charles Brieant said. 
Co-defendant Glen DaSilva was sentenced to two years in prison and Derrick Davis received three years. 
The former fraternity brothers tried to pull off the Pick Six betting coup during the Breeders' Cup last October. The three men, all 29, have been out on bail since pleading guilty. They were members of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity at Drexel in Philadelphia in the 1990s.

WOMENS ROWING 
Ann Arbor lake conditions move races to South Bend 
Special to the Observer 
The Notre Dame womens row­ing team will continue the spring season Saturday at home against Michigan. The races will take place in South Bend on the St. Joseph's River instead of at the University of Michigan as origi­nally scheduled due to poor lake conditions in Ann Arbor, Mich. 
Irish head coach Martin Stone is still working on his crews for Saturday as they will be race­time decisions. 
Notre Dame is looking to build upon its success during the 2002 season in which the varsity eight qualified for the NCAA Championships, hoping the whole team will be invited to the 2003 regatta. 
Notre Dame took advantage of the fall season by trying some new boating combinations and getting the younger rowers some experience in preparation for the spring season. 
The Irish opened the fall sea­son by taking two of the top four positions in the varsity eight race at the Milwaukee River Challenge in Milwaukee, Wis. 
Notre Dame then returned 

home for a two-day regatta ver­sus Kansas where the Irish took two of the top three positions in the varsity four race and finished 1-2-3 in the varsity eight. The Irish continued their successful fall season at the Head of the Ohio as they won two races, including the open four and the club four. The Irish also were fourth in the open eight and took third through sixth places in the pairs race. 
The Irish varsity team closed out its fall season by taking third, fifth and seventh in the open eight race, while the fours were first and third at the Head of the Rock Regatta in Rockford, Ill. 
The next week, Notre Dame's varsity four and varsity pair placed third, while the novice eight was fourth at the Head of the Grand in East Lansing, Mich. 
ND SOFTBALL 
Irish enter second half of season, prepare for Big East 

. Western Michigan hosts Notre Dame in doubleheader 
Special to the Observer 

The Irish softball team returns to the Midwest this weekend to begin the second part of its season. The Irish have completed their presea­son tournament schedule with an 8-9 record and will now focus on regional matchups and the Big East Conference schedule. Notre Dame will take on Western Michigan Sunday in Kalamazoo with a doubleheader at noon and 2 p.m. 
Notre Dame and Western Michigan will be meeting for the 16th and 17th time on Sunday. The Irish lead the all­time series 11-4 and have won four in a row over the Broncos. The last meeting occurred in 2001, an 8-0 vic­tory by the Irish at Ivy Field. 
Western Michigan is also 8­9 this season and boasts wins over Illinois and Virginia Tech. The Broncos are hitting a solid .302 as a team, led by Kelly Barnett's .413 average and Mario McCarthy's .320 average and 13 RBIs. The Broncos' pitching staff is led by Leah Seffernick who owns a 6-2 record and 2.58 ERA, but five different pitchers have seen action this season. 
The Irish are hoping to fol­low the pattern of play estab­lished last season. Notre Dame returned from Spring Break last year with an 8-12 record, but rebounded to win 36 of its final 41 games and finish one game away from the Womens College World Series. 
The Irish also won 14 games in a row after coming back to the Midwest after break in 2002. 
This season, Notre Dame brings an 8-9 record into the second part of its season. 
The Irish begin Big East Conference competition on Saturday, March 29, against Pittsburgh. 
Not only did the weather play havoc with last week­end's Kia Klassic, cancelling the last two days of competi­tion, but the team was struck by a strep throat virus last week as well. 
At one time, six Irish play­ers were affected by the ill­ness, forcing first-team all-Big East honorees Andrea Loman, Steffany Stenglein and Megan Ciolli out of the line up at dif­ferent times. 
The cancellation of the Kia Klassic tournament games allowed the team to get back early from the West Coast and get in a full week of rest before taking on Western Michigan this Sunday: 
The Irish square off with the Broncos for a twin bill Sunday starting at noon at Western Michigan's Fran Ebert Field in Kalamazoo, Mich.

ND WOMENS TENNIS 
Irish commence 4-match homestand as season nears end 

By JOE LINDSLEY 
Sports Writer 
With the end of the regular season approaching, the Irish begin a four-match homestand today that is full of tough compe­tition. 
Today's match against Iowa will likely be the easiest of the next four for the Irish, but Notre Dame, 5-2, will then host No. 13 William & Mary Sunday. No. 28 Michigan Tuesday and No. 54 Purdue Wednesday. 
After their spring break loss to No. 7 Arizona State in their first outdoor match of the season, the Irish dropped from 15th to 27th in the rankings. The Irish began the week with a 4-3 win over No. 49 Brigham Young. 
Notre Dame is the next stop on a tough schedule for Iowa. The Hawkeyes have already seen a good amount of tough competi­tion -competition that it has not been able to handle. 
Currently 3-7 on the season and 1-2 in the Big Ten, the Hawkeyes have seen defeat at the hands of No. 11 Vanderbilt, No. 15 South Alabama, No. 19 Illinois and No. 26 Georgia Tech. Iowa's three wins have come against non-ranked teams Purdue, Marquette and most recently, New Orleans last Sunday. 

Sunday's competition is likely to be more formidable for the Irish as they face William & Mary, 12-4 overall and undefeat­ed in the Colonial Athletic Conference. Before meeting the Irish, the Tribe will face off against the Hawkeyes Saturday. 
While Notre Dame's schedule has not been easy. William & Mary's has been even more chal­lenging. 
Each of William & Mary's loss­es came to teams ranked among the top eight nationally: No. 2 Stanford, No. 3 California, No. 7 Arizona State and No. 8 North Carolina.

team," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "A few times, we were back on our heels, but we stepped up and made big plays." 
Irish center Torin Francis had a phe­nomenal game by scoring a career-high 23 points on 7-for-11 shooting and pul­ing down 14 rebounds. He also hit 9-of­10 free throws for the Irish. 
But it was Thomas, who played high school at Pike in Indianapolis that made the biggest plays when his Irish needed it the most. The 6-foot-1 guard became the floor general for the Irish against the Panthers, especially after Carroll went down with a turned ankle. 
"Fortunately, for us I had a good game and I made some good plays down there near the end and put us in a position to win," Thomas said. "I felt that the leadership needed to be picked up, and I was out there talking to guys, and that's what it took for us to win the game." 
After the game, Brey was very pleased with his point guard's play, especially his aggressiveness. 
"That was a great example, in the second

foul trouble. Notre Dame had 20 turnovers against the Panther's press, and the teams also combined for 44 fouls in the game. 
The Panthers jumped out to a 12-7 lead before the Irish tied it at 12-12 at the 9:26 mark of the first half. Notre Dame began to distance themselves from Wisconsin-Milwaukee by taking a 29-22 lead on a Thomas jumper with 
1:00 remaining in the half. 

But the Panthers' tied the game at half when Page hit a jumper, Ronnie Jones knocked down a 3-pointer and Justin Lettenberger made a layup at the buzzer to make the score 29-29. 
The lead changed several times in the

away, using a 10-0 run to take a 50-48 lead with 10:07 left in the game. 
Notre Dame then went on their own 7-0 run, aided by a Thomas 3-pointer, and regained a 55-50 edge. 
Irish forward Dan Miller hit a jumper with 4:48 remaining to give Notre Dame a 64-61 lead. Jones came back with a layup to cut the lead to one, before Notre Dame's Jordan Cornette knocked down a clutch 3-pointer from the left corner to give the Irish a 67-63 lead with 3:31 left. 
With the Pathers down two, guard Jason Federick drilled a 3-pointer to give Wisconsin-Milwaukee a 69-68 lead. 
The Panthers had a chance to put Notre Dame away late, but Page missed a jumper with two minutes left and a 1­foot layup a minute later. 
Notre Dame made the Panthers pay when Francis put back a Cornette miss to give Notre Dame a 70-69 lead with 33 seconds to play. 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee had one last chance when Clay Tucker drove to the basket, drew a triple team then dished the ball to Page who couldn't convert the lay-up. 
The Irish, who had struggled with their defense late in the season, held the Panthers to only 
34.4 percent shoot­
their star Carroll. 

His ankle sprain leaves him questionable for Saturday's game. 
"He was just running off a screen offensively. but he just rolled his ankle pretty good," Brey said. "Thank God we don't play tomorrow so we have a chance to get him ready. We're work­ing around the clock to get him ready for Saturday." 
For now, Brey just wanted to focus on his teams play, especially down the stretch. 
"We did things and believed we were going to find a way to get it done and that's what our team has been most of the year," Brey said.

the court in jubilation, and the Irish kept danc­ing in March. 
Forget about dodging a bullet. The Irish escaped the whole clip. 
They did so because, when their star was sad­dled first by foul trouble and then by an injury, every other Irish player elevated their game. 
Forward Jordan Cornette drilled a key 3­pointer -just his sixth of the season -at a cru­cial juncture in the sec­ond half. Thomas virtu­ally carried the Irish in latter stages of the game by burying unbelievable shots. Dan under the glare of a tournament spotlight, while the freshman took over early. 

So Francis started the game by scoring his team's first seven points. He finished it by ripping the ball out of Cornette's hands and scoring the game-winning layup with 33 seconds left. 
"I didn't do it inten­tionally, I was just going after the ball" the soft­spoken freshman grinned, adding later. "Sometimes things just happen. I just wanted to win." 
In between his first three baskets and his season-saving final one, Francis played 37 min­utes. grabbed 14 rebounds, made 9-of-10

mance. Torrian Jones helped shut down the Panthers despite playing most of the second half with four fouls. 
"When you do that without your star," Thomas said, "it says a lot about the guys on your team." 
As good as everyone else on Notre Dame's team played, the Irish wouldn't be playing Saturday were it not for the efforts of Torin Francis. 
Normally, freshmen enter their first NCAA Tournament game with a deer-in-the-headlights look. Instead it was the rest of the Irish who appeared to wither early ing his 

head in the 
post-game interview room, thinking back to what he told his team before the game. 
"I told the team before the game he was the key, and we did not do a good job guarding him," Pearl said. "He was a huge factor in their vic­tory." 
Normally, opposing coaches walk into inter­view rooms saying Carroll or Thomas made the difference, not Notre Dame's relatively raw freshman. 
But with long-range shots not falling and his team needing him the most, .Francis stepped up his game to make sure the Irish kept stepping through the tournament. 
The ironic thing was that the Irish entered the game saying they needed to focus playing the same way they had all season. Against the Panthers, the Irish couldn't have played any more different. 
Carroll spent what could have been the final game of his career on the bench. The Irish held an opponent to under 30 points in the first half for the first time since the Ice Age. Notre Dame's victory was truly a team victory. 
"It wasn't our stereo­typical win," Jones said. ·Tm not going to argue 
tnd break it down because we won the game. Guys had the desire and will to win the game." 
Then again, maybe the signs of Notre Dame's success were obvious when the team walked on the court. The players had their heads shaved. they wore brand-new sneakers, and they wore gold uniforms for the first time all season. 
"Everybody said we couldn't win because everything was so new, we should stick to what we were doing," Thomas said. "But since we got away from the Big East. we have a new mindset. It's a new season." 
Thanks to Notre Dame's heroics without Carroll, that season con­tinues.

A Brey-coached Notre Dame team has never made it to the second weekend of the tournament, but that isn't necessarily a knock on the third­year Irish coach who has lots of tourney experience. ::::::::::::::::::::::: :In three years with the Illini, Bill Self has led his teams to a 77­23 record, including an Elite Eight and Sweet Sixteen appear­ance.

All season long, the perimeter has carried Notre Dame, and there's no reason that won't continue.

Francis picked a good time of the year to start playing his best basketball. He had two solid games in the Big East Tournament and Thursday night and. is quickly establishing himself as Notre Dame's most reliable post player. : Cook, the Big Ten Player of the Year, is a force to be reckoned with in the paint. He averages 20.1 points and 7 .2 rebounds a game and is often the Illini's first scoring option. Powell is also reliable inside.  Carroll and Thomas form arguably one of the best backcourts in the nation. If he's healthy, Carroll plays his best basketball in the postseason. Miller gives the Irish a reli­able defensive pres­ence.  The Irish simply lack the depth they've had in previous seasons, but that doesn't mean they don't have options. Jones and Quinn have been reli­able all season long, and the Irish will badly need them come Saturday.  Nobody on the Irish save Miller has advanced to the Sweet Sixteen. and the Irish are eager to snap that streak. Also, the Irish haven't gotten much respect, and that's made them a little unhappy.  
Brown, the fresh­man point guard, has unbelievable quick­ness that helped earn him second-team All­Big Ten honors. Harrington is the team's best 3-point shooter.  One of the deepest teams the Irish have faced all year, the Illini have 10 people who started at one time or the other dur­ing the year. They can generate points, too.  The Illini start two freshmen and two sophomores, but the team has a horde of reliable veterans off the bench. And if Thursday night is any indication, Illinois might have more fans than the Irish.

STYLE OF PLAY 
The Irish will rely on their inside game of Borton, LaVere and Flecky to keep them in the game, while hop­ing Ratay can knock down some 3-pointers from the outside. If they get down early, the Irish may have trouble coming back. 
Arizona can score from the inside and from the perimeter. which will pose prob­lems for Notre Dame. The Wildcats cart find ways to score when they struggle offen­sively. while the Irish have not been able to. 
POST PLAYERS  PERIMETER PLAYERS  BENCH  
The Irish need great defensive efforts out of Borton, Lavere and Flecky. Batteast will also need to provide some help inside when Polk gets the ball. The Irish need their best games from their big­ger players to win.  The Irish need Ratay to find ways to get open and take more shots. If she can knock down some 3-pointers, Notre Dame will have a decent chance of winning. Notre Dame's guard play has been suspect at times this season.  Notre Dame is eight-deep and relies on all eight for scoring and contributions. The Irish should be able to keep fresh legs the whole game, while Arizona may not. This could be an advantage in a close game.  

INTANGIBLES 
Notre Dame has nothing to lose against Arizona, and the Wildcats could be looking ahead to a matchup with Kansas State in the second round. The Irish are battle-tested from a difficult regular sea­son. 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::=:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::= 
Polk ripped apart the PAC-10 this sea­son, and she will give the Irish all they can handle. If Polk can control the paint and boards, the Irish will be in trouble. Look for Arizona to feed her the ball all day.

Staying alive, hanging tough 
. Thomas takes team on shoulders as Irish eek out first-round win 
By JOE HETTLER Sports Writer 
INDIANAPOLIS 
With senior guard Matt Carroll on the bench for most of the game with a sore ankle and foul trouble, Irish point guard Chris Thomas carried Notre Dame on his shoulders and made key plays all game against Wisconsin-Milwaukee. 
A little luck didn't hurt him or the Irish, either. 
Playing in his hometown for the first time in his college career, Thomas scored 27 points. grabbed eight rebounds and added three assists. 
With the game on the line, Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Dylan Page missed a layup with two seconds remaining to help the Irish hang on to a 70-69 victory in the first round of the NCM Tournament Thursday night. The fifth-seeded Irish face four seed Illinois in the second round of the tournament Saturday. The Illini defeated Western Kentucky earlier in the day. 
"We're thrilled to come away with a heartfelt win over a very good team. I'm proud of our

Quiet Ratay lets her shooting do the talking 

By KATIE McVOY Senior Staff Wrirer 
A basketball makes very little sound as it is released into the air. It makes almost no noise as it swishes through the net. But any athlete can tell you the importance that nearly noise­less ball can make if it hits its mark. It can spell victory or it can spell defeat. 
That kind of silence is not only found on a basketball court. 
Sometimes it's found in the players. 
One of Notre Dame's most potent weapons makes very lit­tle noise when she steps on the court. She has little use for words before or after the

game. 
But on the basketball court, Notre Dame guard Alicia Ratay's shot does all the talk­ing for her. 
"She's just the best shooter in the country," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "She's the best pure shooter out there, and she's somebody teams have to focus on." 
Ratay, who leads the Irish in 3-point shots and is in the top five all-time scorers at Notre Dame, has one final chance to make those silent statements on the court. 
"[I'm] really excited," Ratay said. "We think of the NCAA Tournament as a new season -a time to make a fresh start -and we want to come out strong and with a lot of confi­dence." 
The end of Ratay's final regu­lar season should give her the confidence she needs to make a mark in the final games of her college career. 
With Notre Dame's newly instituted triangle offense, Ratay didn't get as many looks as she had in years past this season. The focus on getting the ball inside the paint to the post players did not highlight Ratay's strength -the trey ­and she struggled early on in the season. 
"We had some young guards and we just weren't as good getting her the ball," McGraw said. "I think it was a combina­tion of a lot of things, but we

Viviani has never finished lower than fifth and the three-time All­American is more driven than ever. Sobieraj started horribly in 2002 but recovered to earn All-American honors. Bednarski has said Sobieraj can win the national title but he needs to be totally focused. 
Gross finished 15th last year and Jones was 16th. The Buckeyes epee squad defeated the Irish squad at the conference championships in what turned out to be the deciding match for the conference title. Ohio State has the confidence, but the Irish, especially Viviani, take it to another level at NCAAs. 
Wiercioch finished fourth at the NCAA Championships last year as a sophomore and second as a fresh­man. A Poland teammate of Sobieraj, Wiercioch will challenge Viviani and possibly Sobieraj for a first-team All­American spot. Ethan Muri didn't qualify for the national champi­onships and is the field alternate. 
The Irish had the top three finishers at the regionals, but Forest Walton is the team alternate. Debic is a three­time All-American and will finish very high. Snyder recovered from ill­ness to finish seventh last year and he is in better health than in 2002. This weapon is where Notre Dame separates itself from Ohio State. 
If the Buckeyes want a chance of winning the title, they need a good performance from their weakest weapon. Weir finished 15th as a sophomore last year and Carbone is a freshman who came in with very few accolades. The Irish are highly superior and should have no prob­lem with these two. 
Panchan surprisingly claimed the individual title as a sophomore. He didn't fence with Penn State until the spring semester as he trained to earn a spot with the Thailand Olympic team. Panchan won the Mid-Atlantic regional title. Miller is 10th on the U.S. Junior rankings and finished fifth at regionals. 
Szelle returns to the NCAAs after not competing as a junior apd sitting out last season. He finished second as a freshman and first as a sophomore. Fabricant had a rough NCAA Championships debut as a junior la..'it year. St. John's Ivan Lee is ranked No. 1 in the world and will be tough even for Szelle to beat. 
Crompton, who won the regional title, is the younger brother of for­mer Notre Dame All-American Andre Crompton. Rogers was a first-team All-American as a fresh­man in 2002. Crompton is first in the U.S. junior rankings and Rogers is third. This weapon is easily Ohio State's strongest. 
Weber is a junior from Germany and was a first-time All-American as a sophomore. He has been a part of the German national team that won bronze medals at the 2000 Olympics and 2003 World Championships. Zagunis is 10th in the U.S. Junior rankings.

ByMATTLOZAR 
Associate Sports Editor 
The numbers say the race for the national title should be between Notre Dame and Ohio State, but the Irish know who their real competition is. 
"I don't think Ohio State is going to be a problem. They are not as strong all around," senior foilist Ozren Debic said. "Penn State has 11 top guys. It will be an advantage for us, but we need to do well." 
At this weekend's NCAA Fencing Championships, Notre Dame and Ohio State are the only schools in the country to qualify the maximum 12 fencers. Defending national champion Penn State qualified one less with 11. From past experience, however, it's the quality and not necessarily the quantity that matters. 
"It is definitely an advantage, but Penn State has a solid group of 11. All of their 11 fencers are going to win a good number of bouts," senior epee captain Jan Viviani said. "They always manage to over­achieve, that is something we are going to 
achieve.  They  are  stronger  all-around.  
Having the 12 doesn't  mean  anything if  
the 12 aren't strong."  

"It's helpful mentally, but they do have 11 fencers. Usually the weakest link can break down meaning with 12 fencers on the field, only 11 are giving points," Notre Dame coach Janusz Bednarski added. "There team, despite having three different mem­bers, has zero first-time fencers. That experience factor can do nothing but help. 

"In my opinion, it helps when you have competed already. This is a very unusual competition -two days, 24 bouts, huge round-robin," Bednarski said. "It is fenc­ing 10 hours, so your mental side is under a huge stress. Sometimes, excellent fencers can't fence well for a long time. 
"It is so emotional, it is hard to control." 
Along with the leadership of the five sen­iors, the talent level of the underclassmen gives the Irish a good combination. 
"I think we have a really good makeup of quality and experience," Debic said. "If everything goes right, and we stay healthy, then we should be ready. Everybody is ready to win it." 
A key to having a shot at the title is tak­ing control early. Last year, the Irish held the lead after the womens competition, but the mens team wasn't able to take advantage, and the Irish finished third. Coming in with 12 fencers, grabbing the first day lead and taking control of the competition is a key to battling Penn State for the title. 
"Ifwe are going to have a chance to win, we need to be controlling things the entire time from the beginning to the end," Viviani said. "The first day, they have more bouts than the second day, so it is harder to make things up the second."

stars. They qualified only 10, so it will be really hard for them to make it, but they have excellent fencers," Bednarski said. "Penn State is the [defendingl nation­al champion with many names including the bronze medallist Alex Weber in sabre. Ohio State is very strong since they quali­fied 12." 
At last year's NCAA Championships, Penn State reclaimed the title from St. John's after winning the title from 1995 to 2000. The Red Storm has had previous success fencing with fewer people. They took second place last year with only 11 fencers while the Irish finished third with 12. 
With last year's Notre Dame team hav­ing six first-time participants, inexperi­ence was an issue. However, this year's Monday afternoon,

Bednarski is trying 

to bring his team together in such an individual sport. 
"The team is working more as a group this year than last year," Debic said. "I think Janusz has been trying hard to get some camaraderie going from the first day of practice. It is much better than last year." 
"I think he has done a good job of trying to keep us working hard the whole year and keeping us focused on our final goal," Viviani said.

Womens Preview 
A squad-by-squad breakdown of the top three contenders. 
The womens competition is Saturday and Sunday. 
Epee 



















-. 
Walton won the national title last year in her first NCAA Championships. She knows how to improve her fencing when the com­petition is tough. Call surprisingly earned the second berth by winning the regional title. She didn't compete at nationals last year but finished fifth as a sophomore. 
Gearhart and Shklar finished fourth and fifth at the regionals. Shklar was eighth last year at the national championships and seems to be able to defeat the lesser­skilled fencers but has a problem with world-class fencers like Walton. Gearhart is a freshman from San Antonio. 
Burke finished a disappointing fifth after winning the national title as a freshman. She will be on a mission to reclaim her title after 2002's per­formance. Trzopek is a freshman but won the 2001 World Cup at the junior level. Her international expe­rience may have her ready for the national championships. 
The "A-Team" dominated the com­petition at last year's NCAA Championships in winning every bout possible. Kryczalo didn't lose to anybody and defeated Ament in the championship match 15-6. Last year's results will be extremely diffi­cult to repeat with the top eight fencers returning. 
The talented Thompson twins took home All-American honors as freshmen. Hannah lost to Kryczalo in the semifinals 15-5, while Metta finished fifth. Hoth are ranked in the top 10 in the U.S. junior rank­ings and give Ohio State's its best weapon on the womens side. 
As a freshman, Chin finished 12th after winning the 2002 regional title. This year, Chin was fourth at regionals while Donath was sec­ond. Donath is a freshman from Germany. With the depth of the foil field, the Nittany Lions seem to be at a disadvantage and need these two to step up. 
Bednarski admits this weapon is his "biggest area of concern." Milo has not fenced well in her previous . two appearances, finishing 17th and 18th. Jordan used to fence foil and competed at the national championships at that weapon as a freshman. She made the transition to sabre in a time of need. 
Bond-Williams won the national title as a freshman and will probably dominate the competition. The England native won the conference and regional titles as well this year. Plekhanov is a freshman and is another one of those fencers the Irish feel has qualified, but really won't be a major contributor. ­
Last year, Brosnan finished as a second-team All-American for the second straight year. She really doesn't have a lot of international experience and has fenced mainly out of her club in Oregon. O'Neill was redshirted last year with her only All-American coming as a sophomore.

Hoping fourth titne's a chartn 
Senior captains Ozren Debic andJan Viviani strive to become four-time All-Americans even as they search for their first national title 
ByMATTLOZAR 
Associate Spores Editor 
On the strip, seniors Ozren Debic and Jan Viviani fence in different styles. 
Debic is likely to charge his opponent and try to score a point, while jumping in the air to surprise his opponent or reaching behind his head for the strike with a counterat­tack. 
Viviani patiently waits for an opening, bouncing on his calves and conventionally attacking with a straight-on strike. 
But what drives these third­year captains and three-time All-Americans is something very basic -winning. 
Getting it done 
Since Debic and Viviani fence different weapons -foil and epee -naturally, their styles will vary. Despite the differences in style and weapon, the results are simi­lar. 
"They are different and they are very similar," Notre Dame coach Janusz Bednarski said. "The similarity is their ambi­tion to win. They aren't happy when they are losing." 
The way Debic and Viviani win is different as well. 
"The difference is in the style. Jan needs to think. He likes danger. He performs bet­ter in the situation when he is losing," Bednarski said. "Then he is getting a shot of adrena­line, which helps him to fence with better reaction. He likes to be at the end of the strip where one more step costs you a point. He is able to fence in a very stressful situation. 
"Ozren is like poetry. He wants to win from the begin­ning and not create the danger try to keep a happy tone all the and win immediately." way, sometimes it's music or

reasons for that. is that when you run into those situations, you don't have a choice, but you have to be aggressive," Viviani said. "It forces me to be more aggressive and that helps me be successful." 
Meanwhile, Debic doesn't have a flair for the dramatic, but a flair for liveliness. He'll talk to himself in his native Croatian tongue, use uncon­ventional tactics and let the judges know when he isn't sat­isfied with their decision. 
But it's all in good fun. 
"I try to keep a happy mood all the time. On the strip, it can get really crazy and stressful with hard opponents and bad directors," Debic said. ''I have had some problems with injuries which adds stress. I 

 Photo courtesy of Notre Dame Sports Information Senior epee captain Jan Viviani competes at the Notre Dame Duals Feb. 1. Viviani can become a four-time All-American this weekend at the Air Force Academy. 
Aside from 
the stat book, Debic is the only fencer in Notre Dame history to win four Midwest Conference Championships. 
Viviani is first in career win­ning percentage at epee, third on the epee career wins list and eighth on the all-time wins list. He owns three of the top 10 epee campaigns in winning percentage. Viviani won an individual conference title as a junior. 
All of the success can be attributed to a mastery of technique, and a little talent. 
"Both are excellent techni­cally. It is a pleasure from someone who can observe them," Bednarski said. "Their actions are technical, correct and quick. Both are very tal­ented." 
Viviani and Debic have placed in the top five at the NCAA Championships in each of their first three seasons. However, the one thing neither of them has been able to do is win a national title -either individually or as a team. 
Unfinished business 
At the NCAA Championships, the team with the most points claims the overall title. A school earns a point from a win by individual fencers. In essence, a fencer is alone on the strip but is really compet­ing for the team. 
"It's something you need to experience and go through to learn how to approach it. It's kind of hard when you aren't fencing well, and then every­one's like, 'You gotta do it for the team.' Then you lose again, you think, 'I [let down] the team, I [let down] every­body,'" Debic said. "It's a very stressful tournament because your results affect the team's results." 
"That's the reason why, and I bet everyone agrees, this is one of the most stressful com­petitions they have competed in," Viviani said. "We have all competed in world events, but this is different." 
Around the world in other competitions, fencers general­ly go for individual awards first and team results second .

"As a fencer, I had to learn how to compet~ as a part of the team. At home, it is basi­cally three guys on the foil national team. We were mostly going for individual results. The team thing wasn't as important," Debic said. "Being captain made me more aware of the input everyone has on the team, even the walk-ons." 
Debic and Viviani are three­time All-Americans and look to become the 10th and 11th fencers in Notre Dame history to win that honor for the fourth time. In each of their three years, the Irish have come in as a favorite and have yet to win the team title. 
But the talented duo will use their unique styles in trying to win their first individual title, and more importantly, their first team title. 
"I want to win it. I have wanted to win it every year,'' Debic said. "This year I am going for it again. It is going to be really hard, because there is a certain level which all the guys are at above other years. We are going to have to work at it to reach the top four." 
"It definitely would be nice to have both. It is something I have been working for this year, trying to focus on," Viviani said. "I think it would be nice to win as a team final­ly. That could mean some­thing."
