Iraq outlines goals in Iran conflict 
IRAQ (AP) --The Iraqi government of President Sad­dam Hussein has not said what its immediate military objec­tives are in the fighung with Iran which started last week. But it has said its overall goals are the recovery of small par­cels of disputed border terri­tory, full Iraqi jurisdictiQn over a 60-mile stretch of the Shatt al-Arab waterway separating the two nations, and restoration of''Arab sovereignty over three islands of the southern end of the Persian Gulf.

Robinson lectures on inflation

second in a two-part program
entitled "Inflation and the Cri­sis in Economic Theory." The presentation was sponsored by 
the economics department. 
Robinson told a crown in Galvin Auditorium that the

added that the government must spend money to revitalize the economy and it chooses to 
purchase arms.
In academic terms, the sup­
ply of arms increases propor­tionately with the demand for arms. 
Robinson supported her claims by quoting a report that revealed that world military 

expenditures increased at a I will be asked to contribute $2, 1 f;reater pace than the rate of , while the faculty and staff are

The economic ramifications of the arms race notwithstand­ing, Robinson called the current weapons competition "the most serious problem of the present time " She urged the Notre Dam~ faculty and student to study the arms race. "Don't give yourselves too optimistic a pi.crure of how the United States ts helping the Third World countnes by trading weapons," Robinson said. 
Robinson also cited other reasons for rapidly rising prices, one of them being that wages and prices "chase each-other." "Workers must request higher wages to sustain their livelihoods This causes prices to rise. This is a link that shouldn't be forgotten " Robin­

The three islands, which control the Strait of Horm~z entranceway to the Gulf, were seized by Iran from the United Arab Emirates in 1971. 
Iraqi intentions toward the Iranian oil region of Khuzestan, a major target of the invasion, were unclear. The southwest­ern Iranian province is largely Arab-populated, and the Iran­ians have long claimed that Iraq was assisting Arab dissidents there in an attempt to wrest the area from non-Arab Iran. 
Virtually all the battle reports came from the official news media of the two sides. No Western reporters were at the front. 
A leader of the paramilitary reserves in Baghdad exhorted all Iraqis to do their part in the 
"jihad," or holy war against the Iranians. In Iran, Moslem clergymen also declared their readiness to fight a "jihad," and arrangements were being made to send clergy men to the front, the state-run Iranian radio said. 
In Baghdad Radio reports, the Iraq military command 
claimed lts greatest successes on the ground in the central
border area some 100 miles east 
of Ba~hdad andat the northern end 0 the 300-mile long front. It said armor-led troops com­
pleted the capture of the major border-town of Qasr-e-Shirin

NDscientistfinds cancer_cure 
by Mary Fran Callahan Senior StaffReporter 

Advancing the quest for a cure for cancer, Notre Dame's Dr. Morris Pollard has discoverd that the drug Indomethacin can cure intestinal tumors in rats. 
The results of Pollard's research could eventually lead to clinical use of the drug to treat humans afflicted with cancer. 
"It works under experimental conditions. That's the first step," Pollard explained. 
In the University's Lobund Laboratory, Pol­lard, a professor of microbiology, and his colleagues established a "model system" using rats as the basis for their research. 
The began their work by introducing dimeth­ylhydrazine (DMH) into a strain of rats equally susceptible to the drug, which induces intestinal cancer. After 20 weeks, the drug caused cancer in the rats' intestines. 
and chased fleeing Iranian troops down the Tehran road to the town of Sar-e-Pol-e-Zahab, some 20 miles inside the bor­der. 
The foothills area is 3 50 miles 
southwest of Tehran, across the 
12 ,000-foot high Zagros Moun­
tains. 
''The fall of Sar-e-Pol-e-Za­
hab is imminent,'' the Iraqi 
comminque said. 
The Iranians acknowledged that their troops had retreated in the Mehran area. Tehran Radio said the Iraqis had seized nearby Salehabad, and its de­fenders had withdrawn to near­by hills. 
The Iranian rel?on said there were "many" civilian casual­ties in Qasr-e-Shirin and Meh­
ran. The Iraqis claimed to have captrued hundreds of Iranian pnsoners. 
In Iran's oil-rick southwest corner, just across the Shatt al-Arab from Iraq, Iranian de­fenders of Abadan and the major port city of Khorramshar apparantly continued to hold out against the invaders, who reported laying seige to the two centers Tuesday. 

Some indications of heavy casualties in the area were 
appeals by the local Abadan 

radio for blood donors, for all medical personnel to report to duty, and for automobile own­
ers to volunteer to deliver wounded to hospitals.

The researchers then divided the rats into two grou.Ps. To one group, the fed Indomethacin by injecttn~ the drug in the rats' drinking water. The remaming half of the rats drank plain drinking water. 
After waiting an additional 20 weeks, the scientists then killed all the rats and performed extensive autopsies on the animals. They discovered over half of the rats treated with Indomethacin showed no signs of cancer. 
''In over 50 percent of the animals, we couldn't find any tumors. One hundred percent of the untreated rats all had tumors, though " Pollard said. ' 
.''This work gives support to optimism that science is on its way to a cure for this particular type of cancer," he commented. 
Though scientists still need to learn more about Indomethacin, Pollard's discovery could well lead to clinical treatment in humans,

Political contests shape up 
A couple of very interesting political races are shaping up locally, and of the several thousand of you who are registered in this state, we fear many are uninformed on exactly is going down in the final weeks before election day. For those who are truly ignorant, the races match up the following combatants: 
US House-Rep. John Brademas (D) vs. John Hiler (R). US Senate--,--Sen. Birch Bayh (D) vs. Rep. Dan Quayle (R). ' Governor~ John Hillenbrand (D) vs. Lt. Gov. Bob Orr (R). 
The race for the Third District seat in the House is probably the closest, if not the most heated, of the three. Brademas, who was first elected in 1958, is facing a tough fight from political rookie John Hiler. 
Brademas, as House Majority Whip, is the third most powerful man in the house, and he can get things done for this area in the wink of an eye. Most recently, he lined up funds for a gasoho~ plar;tt and a radar weather statiOn m South Bend. On the surface, it would not seem intelligent to vote against the man. 

However, unemployment is high in thes~ parts, the recession is hitting the Midwest particularly hard and Brademas' very visible ties with JimmyCart~r aren't helping him any. As a result, his approval rating ·has declined steadily among his constituents and an independent poll done for Hiler showed the 27-year-old challenger leading the 
incumbent. But in an Observer "Q & A" to be published Monday, Brademas refutes that poll, saying "they polled only 106 people.··· We sur~ey more people than that when we want to dee1de whether to serve hot dogs or hamburgers at a picnic. I cannot take a poll seriously that is taken from such a small sample." 
Another factor that has always hindered the Majority Whip in this fairly conservative area is his strictly liberal voting record-he has voted against GOP standards such as the Kemp-Roth bill, the B-1 bomber, deregulation of natural gas, increased defense spending, and the Hyde Amendment, which would prohibit federal funding ofabortions. As such, Brademas has been given close contests by candidates whom he outspent 2-1, and whose campaigns have not been as well organized as John Hiler's. 
Justas1972wasnotagoodyearforRepublicans,t9so is not a good year for Democrats. ~ut as Brademas' campaign chugs into high ge_ar, hts poll 

-ratings will undoubtedly shoot up agam. Expect him to weather the storm. In the race between Birch Bayh and Dan Quayle, circumstances are surprisingly similar. Bayh is the

News Editor 


Quayle the young (33) conservative selected to go after him. But there's more to it than that. 
Ronald Reagan and other Republican bigs have named Bayh specifically as one liberal they absolutely must get out of Congress. To accom­plish this, the National Conservative Political Action Committee has stepped in to campaign for Quayle against Bayh, and a Bayh spokesman claims that "in the late days ofthis campaign, there will be a monumental slur campaign against Birch Bayh." 
Bayh is fighting back. He has already filed a 
complaint with the Federal Elec­
tion Commission, and will take 
the NCPAC to court if the FEC 
doesn't take action. Bayh says, 
' 1 it's an effort to try to defeat a 
number of incumbent senators in 
this consiracy between young 
men with the right-leaning philo­
sophies working in conjunction 
with this ~ight-wing hate group.'' 
complaint with the !•ecteral hlectlon L.ommission, 
and will take the NCPAC to court it the FEC 
doesn't take action. Bayh says "it's an effort to try 
to defeat a number of incumbent senators in this 
conspiracy between young men with right-leaning 
philosophies working in conjunction with this 
right-wing hate group." 
The Senator's voting record is diametrically 
opposed to that of Rep. Quayle, a fact best 
evidenced in their 1976 ratings by the conservative 
Americans for Constitutional Action-Bayh 
received a o, Quayle a 96. Bayh spent over a 
million dollars in his last campaign, and reports say 
he has amassed more than $1.5 million for this 
race. Quayleiswell-backedalso(theNCPACcan't 
hurt, though he denies any affiliation with it), and 
he won his last election to the House by a 
landslide. 
Additionally, Bayh is running for a fourth term, 
and Indiana voters have dumped popular 
incumbents reaching for that goal before, such as 
Homer Capehart in 1962 and Vance Hartke in 
1976. Barring incident, we'll pick the upset­
Quayle in a close one. 
The gubernatorial contest doesn't seem to be as 
close. Popular Gov. Otis Bowen's lieutenant governor, Bob Orr, is going against Democrat John Hillenbrand. Hillenbrand had a tough scrape getting past Ray Townsend in the May primary, and his ad campaign is barely underway, while Orr's has been rolling for weeks now. In this strong year for Republicans, look for Orr to win easily.

plans for public opening 

By Sheila Shunick 

Notre Dame's $3.7 million Snite Museum of Art will open it's doors to the public from I to 5 p.m., Sunday, Novemebr 
9. The new museum will have six times the capacity of the old one, enablin~ it to exibit all of the Universtty's I2,000-piece, $15 willion permanent collec­tion. 
The museum is named for Colonel Fred B. Snite of Chica­go. Snite, the major benefactor of the museum, gave the University $2 million the year before his death in 1977 and also donated 41 Old Mastr paintings over the years. Snite's daughter, Mary ~retto Dillon and her husband wdl be chief among those being honor­ed during the dedica~ion activi­ties in the week pnor to the public opening. 
Six other substantial dona­tions will also be recognized in the dedication ceremony of the 
the dedication ceremonies of the new museum. The Knott­Beckman Galleves of High Renaissance and Baroque Art are a gift of Frederick and Marion Knott Beckman of Granger, Ind. A gift from Walter R. Beardly of Elkhart, Ind., will support the Gallery of Twentieth Century Art. 
The Victor Higgins GaHery of Western Art is the product of a gift from John and Margarette Higgins of Bir­mingham, Mich. The Ivan Me­strovik Gallery is a donation of Fritz and Mddred Kaeser of Tuson, Ariz. The building's 304-seat auditorium is the gift of Walter H.Annenberg, the former U.S. ambassador to Great Britain. Alice Tully of New York City has underwrit­ten an endowment for the fine arts at Notre Dame. 
In addition to the dedication of the museum and the inaug­uration of the major benefact­ors the events of the week pre~eeding the opening will tnclude such events as a l?anel discussion by a distingutshed group of art critics, an acade: mic convocation to award SIX honorary degrees, a dedication mass with a blessing of the building and a special preview of the museum for charter members of the Friends of the Snite Museum. 
A 16th century Madonna and· Child by Italian s~ulptor J ac?po s~nsovtno occuptes a promi­nent position in the museum's atrium as a memorial to the

Snite's son, Frederick B. Snite Jr., a polio victim who died. in 1954 after living 18 years wtth an iron lung. 
During his life, the younger Snite, a 1933 graduate of Notre Dame, inspired millions as the nation's news media nick­named him ''The Boiler Kid'' and chronicled his courageous fight against the crippling dis­ease. 
Other special exhibits include: Notre bame Alumni and Fac­ulty Art exhibition; a selection of sculptures, Fr. Anthony ) . Lauck; and Christian Imagery in African Art, the Britt Family Collection. 
The regular hours of the museum after Nov. 9 will be Tuesday-Friday 10 a.m. to 4

everyone. With the leadership 
that Mike Sexton and his committee have shown, we ar~ now able to achieve that." 
Describing their process as a "developed, workable model," McTaggart stresses his hope that this event might soon become a project run by stu­dents alone. "I'm confident that this can now be anchored as a true student activity,'' he says. 
As in previous years, a chart postin~ the daily progress of the dnve wiH be on display in the Administration Building. This chart will also show the rate of participation in the campaign from each dorm, as 
well. "We hope, as in other years, to instill friendly compe­tition between the halls by comparing them this way," Sexton explains. Other forms of advertisement to be used include posters, newsp~_per ads, and slogans emphastztng that • 'Two Heads are Better 
than One." 

The United Way is affiliated with many programs here at Notre Dame, as well as with its worl-wide interests to help the poor, sick and disabled. Some of the organizations from South Bend to which the proceeds of the drive will benefit are the Big BrothersI Big Sisters pro­gram, the Logan Center, Alco­holics Anonymous, and the · Red Cross. There are, how­ever, a great many more which could be added to this list. 
McTaggart feels that there is great Catholic educational value to be found in a student's involvement in the drive. "This campaign, really, is a Gospel project," he says. "We are a city responding to the needs of the city, and I am convinced the student body will respond to the help we are calling for. They always have and they always will." 
These words of encourage­ment are indicative of those expressed by everyone in­volved with the drive. As shown by one of the many posters displayed throughout the campus, they feel that "We're All in this Together."

Poco draws a 'poco' crowd 
Jay Traverse 

At the outset of Friday night's Homecoming concert featuring 
Poco, one might suspect that the band would employ a"get in andget 
out" attitude towards this show at the ACC, and who could really 
blame them. Only some 3000 fans showed up, and their enthusiasm 
throughout the evening left a great deal to be desired. 
However, none of these difficulties seemed to faze Poco, for the 
provided the wise few who showed up with a great concert. Led by 
pedal steel virtuoso Rusty Young and guitarist Paul Cotton, the last 
remnants of the original band played a well-mixed set of20 songs with 
enough old material to please even vintage Poco enthusiasts. 
The show began on an immediate up-beat note, as the band went 
into newer material, mostly from their newly released, electric Under 
tht Gun LP. Songs such as "Reputation," "Made of Stone," and 
"Boomerang" highlighted Paul Cotton's guitar improvisations. 
Cotton's work was complemented nicely by bass player Charlie 
Harrison and Rusty Young, who divided time between the electric 
and lap steel guitars. It was apparent that Young was much more 
comfortable with the latter. 

Young's anxieties soon disappeared as he and Paul Cotton picked 
up acoustic 12-strings and recreated the band's distinct, older sound 
from the days when they played with the likes of]im Messina, Richie 
Furay and Timmy Schmidt. They began with Young's hit single of 
two years ago, "Crazy Love," sung to perfection by Young. From 
there, they delved further into the past, playing tunes like "Bad 
Weather" from From the In.rrde, and" Fool's Gold" from the Crazy Eye.r 
album. 

"Bad Weather" provided convincing evidence that Rusty Young is 
the hands down kind of the pedal steel. He was almost in a trance 
thoughout the song, playing magnificently yet still able to adjust his 
amp a dozen times in search for the perfect response from his 
instrument. 

The instrumental "Fool's Gold" highlighted a very clean acoustic 
set by Young and Cotton, featuring Young on the banjo 
accompanying Cotton's 12-string guitar. After playing "Indian 
Summer," which included an autumn visual background setting, 
Poco picked up the beat, and their electric guitars, and cranked out 
tunes from their last two albums, including favorites like "Heart of 
the Night," highlighted again by Young on pedal steel, "Down to the 
Wire," and "Legend" before they left the stage. 
After moderate cheering from the crowd, which could have been 
interpreted as a call for an encore, Poco returned and played "Going 
to a Hoedown," which left most everyone on their feet as the show 
ended. 

The opening act for Poco featured]ohn Hall, who attended school 
here in the early '70s and later joined the pop group "Orleans." His 
small selection of songs included familiar tunes "Still the One" and 
"Danct: With Me," dont: well despitt: the fact that Hall had no band 
behind him for support. Hall will return to NUfor the Country Rock 
.Jam in early November.

Dump Bayh group m.isses budget 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) ··A conservative group that has targeted U.S. Senator Birch Bayh for defeat hasn't been able to raise as much money for the effort as it had hoped, the coordinator of the Indiana campaign said yesterday. 
William Grier, a Lafayette advertising man who is head­ing the state effort of the National Conservative Political Action Committee, said the group originally had planned to spend $140,000 on its anti­Bayh campaign. 
"We find we can't get our full budget, just like every other politician,'' he told reporters at a Statehouse news conference. 
"This isn't particularly.a gold-encrusted year for fund raising.'' Grier said the NCPAC has spent $94,000 so far in their Indiana effort against Bayh, a three-term Democrat who is facing Republican Dan Quayle. From now until Nov. 4, the group will spend about $10,000 more. 
"We have another horse to ride in this situation," said Grier. "If we push extremely hard for the money in · this state, really push hard, we're going to take money away from Dan Quayle." 
Grier said the NCPAC is concerned about getting only enough money to do its job and not hurt Quayle's own effort. 
"We don't have a candidate and we must be aware of that continually," he said. 
Earlier in the day, David Bochnowski, manager of the Birch Bayh for Senator Com­mittee, released a report listing Bayh's sources of campaign contributions. He said it was an attempt to counter charges from Quayle that Bayh gets most o(his money from out-of­state sources. 
"For whatever reason, Con­gressman Quayle has lied about where our money comes from, " Bochnowski said. ' T m trying to set the record straight.'' 
According to a summary prep­ared by Bayh's committee, the campaign organization has raised $815,514 from individu­als in Indiana as of Sept. 15. Contributions from outside of Indiana have amounted to $345,575 and direct mail ap­peals produced $262,224. 
Combined with other contri­butions, Bayh has amassed $1.8 million so far in his bid for a fourth term --something no other senator from Indiana has ever been able to achieve. 
Bochnowski said Quayle has implied that Bayh's campaign is being financed by organized labor. But rhe committee man­ager said labor contributions represent only 9 percent of the total raised so far. 
Bayh has raised 70 percent of his money from individuals and groups inside Indiana, Bochn­owski said. 
"It is difficult to break down contributions from political ac­tion committees into in-state and out-of-state groups,'' said Bochnowski. He added the Steelworkers union in Indiana has made contributions to Bayh, but because their polit­ical action committee is organ­ized in Pittsburgh, the contri­bution is listed as coming from out of state. 
"It's false and misleading to say that all PAC money comes from out of state, simply because the check comes from the place where the political action committee is organ­ized," he said. 
[continued from page 5] 

fine, but convictions are few and rare. 
A woman sometimes ''is tortured in every possible way and even deprived of marital rights'' if she does not bring sufficient dowry to her in-laws, said the government report. 
The report cited numerous cases of harassment and, in some cases, even murder by husbands or in-laws if women fail to provide sufficient dowr­ies at the time of their wedd­mgs. 
Dowry takes several forms, 
. .. Crime 
ranging from cash payments to household goods such as furn­
iture,  refrigerators,  air  con­ 
ditioners and sometimes  even  
motorcycles and cars.  

Police statistics show 69 women were burned to death in New Delhi last year because of low dowries. Few of the cases have been successfully prose­cuted. 
Already this year, between January and July, 67 dowry deaths have been reproted. Social workers and women's leaders say the ·real figure is far higher because many cases go unreported.

And all he did was set a high school record for shutouts in a season. He visited Notre Dame when he was a senior and decided he wanted to continue his soccer career for the Irish. 
"I went out for the freshman team and I worked pretty hard," he points out. "I really enjoy soccer here. They guys on the team are great and so is Rich (Hunter). I'm glad I dec­ided to keep playing when I came here.'' 
An electrical engineering major Milligan would like to get a job on the east coast after gradua­tion. But that's still a few years down the road. Right now he'd like to contribute to the growth of die Notre Dame soccer

"I  think  the  best  way  to

Randy Ellis is a product 
of 
Texas football. 
''All I hear about is how powerful Cincinnati football is, what with Moeller and all the players that they have sent here. I get pretty tired of it." 
Ellis says that high school football in Texas is extremely competitive, and that there are plenty of schools back home that could play well against Moeller or in Chicago's Catho­lic League. 
Back home for Ellis is Pear­land, Texas. "It's just outside of Houston, and folks down there don't like Notre Dame too much." Obviously, the feeling never rubbed off on the 6-5 offensive lineman.

Maybe we don't get the recognition from the press or the fans, but we get the respect of our tea~m3;tes and opponents, and that Is what counts. There is a tremendous amount of satisfaction to be gained from knowing that .Yo~ did your job and that you did It ·well.'' . Ellis says that his footb3;ll career is not at the top of h1s list of priorities. He has his ego well under control.

Randy Eilts has ht's eyes on med school after Notre Dame. 
''I was thrilled that Notre Dame even wanted to talk to me. As a kid, when you thought of college football, you always thought of Notre Dame. I mean even in Texas!" Ellis says that he :figured that he would go to college in Texas somewhere, but when the chance to come to Notre Dame came along, he jumped at it. 
"My high school didn't have the best football program, s.o I dido' t even think about gettmg a scholarship. When Notre Dame said that they were interested, I couldn't believe it." There are always problems when a big high school star, especially one from. an area with the football hentage that Texas has, goes on to play major college ball. Suddenly,

Mterthoughts of a miracle 
Random thoughts while savoring Saturday's "miracle": 
Not too long ago, Notre Dame's foot~all.tea~ was much-maligned for a lack of imagi~ation In its play selection. Now, it seems, the Insh ba~d has claimed that distinction. Gospel musiC? Come on now. There is no quarrel here.wit~ the band's technical excellence, or the dedication of its members. But just because it's the nation'.s oldest collegiate marching band doesn't mean lt has to have a repetoire to match. 
Even worse, when Michigan s~ored to take its 27-26lead with less than one minute to play, 

the  band  struck  up  Michigan's fight  song,  
"Victors."  
Now that's incredibl e.  
The  season's  first  nomination  for  bush­ 

leaguer of the year goes to Wolverine quarterback John Wangler, who didn't .even attempt to call the signals before requestmg .a timeout when the Irish fans began to whoop .It up in the fourth quarter. And of course, the Big Ten officials were quick to come to Wangler's rescue. 
Tony Hunter's 31-yard pass to Pete Holohan, which set up Notre Dame's final touchdown, was the best-thrown pass ofthe season. Is there 

. anything Hunter can't do? 
Give credit to Notre Dame's offense. After a sparkling first half, the Irish didn't manage a first down during the entire third quarter. But when it appeared that the Irish had to score or lose, the offense pushed the ball down the field for the go-ahead touchdown. 
Irish coach Dan Devine said that he used Blair Kiel in the shotgun formation late in the game because he was the only. quarterba~k t~ prac~ice from the spread formation. Why dido t Tim Koegel, who may be the best pure. passer on the sguad, get a chance to practice the 
shotgun during the week? . 
The main complaint against Koegel Is that he can't avoid the rush, but with less than a minute to play and just one timeout remaining, scramblinp: ability is rather unimportant. Even if the qu ... terback were able to escape a h~avy rush and pick up 10 or 15 yards, so m~ch time would elapse that it would be irilmatenal where the ball was spotted.

Milligan keeps Notre Dame defense on the ball 
by Frank LaGrotta Sports Writer 
Riddle: What is eight feet high, 24 feet wide and stands at both ends of a soccer field. 
Of course the answer must be a soccer goal. (Unless of course the Russians have started giv­ing steroids to their soccer players.( And soccer goals are something very familiar to John Milligan. A 6-1 junior from 
Palatine, Ill., Milligan spends a lot of time jumping around in front of one as sparsely clad players try to kick a ball over, around, even through him and into the net. 
"Well, first of all, you have to be quick," points out Milligan, the Notre Dame's soccer team's first-string goaltender. "And you have to be able to react almost immediately and cover 
the open area. You also have to help your defense because most 
of the time they play facing 
away from the action. "And you have to keep your mind in the game. Sometimes you can go a long time without ever seeing a shot on goal. The hard thing to do is to stay in the game and not go flat." 
Milligan's stats from a year ago indicate that he seldom went flat. He started 19 of 24 games

because Bob Crable was shaken up during Michigan's scoring drive, doesn't much water. 
The Notre Dame timeout came right on the 
heels of one called by Michigan. And as Devine 
has stated in the past, when a player is shaken 
up, he should get an official timeout and c~me 
to the sideline for one J?lay as the rules reqmre. 
That was a very cntical timeout, ~specially 
with Michigan on the verge ?f sconng. ~ob 
Crable is a great player, but I d hate to thmk 
that our defense is helpless without him . 
Now that it appears that WNDU-TV will be able to telecast all the Notre Dame games not shown by ABC, all is well in So~th Bend. Isn't it funny how students can be kmfed, assualted and pistol-whipped off-campus, and Mayor Roger 0. Parent can't be bothere_d to atten~ a meeting with police department representatives and Umversity officials in his own office? 
But when the NCAA nearly pulls the plug on football telecasts, they're trying to deprive South Bend of its rights to watch its football team. 
As far as I'm concerned, Roger 0., you can keep your city. Nobody else wants it. 
In years l?ast, there were _frequen~ ~mblings that the Big Ten would hke to nd Itself of perennial laughing-stock ~orthweste~n. If ~om­missioner Wayne Duke ts worth his weight, he'll ~ive Illinois the heave-ho, instead. The Illini IS making a mockery of the conference with its repeated court challenges of conference rulings. 
If you don't like the rules of the game, take your ball and go home. Nobody will miss you. 
· The euphoria of Saturday's conquest of Michigan has everyone pointing to the Nov. 15 showdown with Alabama in Birmingham. Everybody, of course, expects the Irish to be undefeated, which they probably should be. But beware of Miami. The Hurricanes have 20 of 22 starters back. And they were humiliated by Notre Dame in last year's Mirage Bowl. 
registered shutouts in nine of them (a Notre Dame single-sea­son record). He made 125 saves and allowed only 17 goals for a 
most  impressive  .791  goals  
against average.  
''John is  just  an  outstanding  

goalkeeper,': points out Hun,­
ter. "His qmckness and flexi­

bility give him the potential to 
become the top keeper in the 
midwest.'' 

After eight games this season, Milligan's skills have shown little sign of decline. He's got three shutouts and is playing as well as ever. He credits a lot of his success to goalkeeper coach Hank Hofman. But Hofman gives most of the praise right back to Milligan. 
"John works very hard," com­ments Hofman, an assistant to Hunter who spent some time in his Holland homeland as a goalie for a semi-professional soccer team. "Sometimes John . looks very e~perienced out there.'' 
But, intere~tingly enough, ~il­ligan never thought of playmg soccer until this senior year in high school. 
''Well a few ofmy friends were playing and I thought it looked like a good game," he recalls. "So I went out for the team."
