Chinese writers'group makes first U.S. visit 
ByKELLI FLINT 
ExecutiveNews Editor 
Americans seem "frank, outspoken, and friendly ...with a sense of humor" to the first delegation of Chinese writers ever to visit the United States. 
Originating from the People's Republic of China, the group stopped at Notre Dame this week to tour the campus and meet with University officials.

! America in September. 
Yuan Henian acts as interpreterfor the group. An Associate Profi:s­sor of English with Beijing Institute of Foreign Languages, Henian is the only member who can speak English. 
Henian considers the conference the beginning ofa mutual under­standing between Chinese and American writers, countries and peoples. 
"We understand each other," he said. "We've been cut off, but now we're beginning to reach each other ...something that is very good." 
The events of the 1950's were a major cause for the "cut oft" Henian described. "It was very difficult for writers to get in touch then," he said. "Before this trip, writers visited Europe individually." 
The Chinese government did not sponsor the delegation. "We are not from the government, but from a popular association -writers themselves," Henian said. 
The group's Notre Dame visit was suggested by editor Norman Cousins, who, together with UCLA, sponsored the Los Angeles con­ference. 
"Cousins is a friend of Father Hesbunzh's. " Henian noted. The Chinese writers are headed by literary critic Feng Mu and 
includes novelist Wu Qiang, novelist U Zhun, poet U Ying, novelist Zhang Jie, shon story writer Jiang Zilong, and Fan Baoci, the secretary ofthe delegation. 
The group is scheduleu to return to China Oct. 20, after visiting U'1iversities in Washington D.C., NewYork City, Boston and Salt Lake City.

A dam burstat an iron ore mine in Liberia early yesterday; sending tons of debris down a hillside into a miners' camp. The Liberian Ministry of Information said 34 people were killed and 38 injured Western diplomats in the West African nation said earlier they had been told between 200 and 300 people were killed Rescue workers were still searching the debris for victims, Liberian Director of Public Affairs Jeff Mutada said in a telephone call from Monrovia The dam, which held back water and waste materials from process­ing iron ore, burst after three days of torrential rains, Mutada said. The miners' camp beneath the dam housed between 300 and 400 people but Mutada said part of it escaped being hit by debris. The U.S.-based Republic Steel Co. has a 60 percent interest in the mine.

Libya's official news agency today claimed anti-aircraft batteries last month shot down a pilotless American spy plane from the U.S. Sixth Fleet over Benghazi, Libya. The report from the agency]ANA, monitored in Rabat, said the plane was downed Sept. 2, but the announcement was delayed to permit "expert ex­amination and identification of the wreckage." Benghazi is Libya's second city, 500 miles east ofthe capital, Tripoli.]ANA said the plane was shot down while flying through an international air traffic lane "in the hope ofescaping the surveillance of Libyan radar." -AP 
A sperm bank has been opened by a California feminist health center to help thousands of infertile couples, single women and lesbians who want children. It's very threatening to some people," said Laura Brown, director of the Oakland Feminist Women's Health Center, which formally opened the bank on Tues­day. "Women are not only going to control their bodies an~( reproduction through abortions, but they will also be able to control when they have children." The sperm bank is the first in northern California and the first nationwide to be run by women, its director says. The bank, which stemmed from an informal sperm donor­insemination program at the 10-year-old center, is expected to an­tagonize abortion foes because it "represents another form of freedom and choice for women," said assistant director Barbara Raboy. The center, which also provides abortion, vasectomy and birth control services, already has screened more than 200 men who 
want to donate sperm. -AP 

A Florida man has been charged with motesting a 14­
year-old boy found dead in a ditch in neighboring Hamilton County. 
Indianapolis police charged Duncan V. Patterson, 47, with child 
molesting Tuesday in connection with the disappearance of Del­
voyd Lee Baker of Indianapolis. His body was found Sunday. Inves­
tigators said Patters ton admitted he paid Baker for a homosexual act 
but denied nied any involvement in his death. They quoted Patter­
son as saying he picked up the eighth-grade student on a downtown 
street Saturday, took him to a motel, later drove the youth back 
downtown and dropped him off at University Square. Police said 
they are treating the death as a homicide although an autopsy failed 
to determine the cause of death. Police say they also are trying to 
determine whether there is any connection between Baker's death 
and the deaths ofthree other young men whose corpses were found 
in ditches in Hamilton County and northern Marion County since June 1980. -AP 
An Indianpolis woman who bore a child out of wedlock six years ago has filed a federal court suit seeking Social Security benefits from the account of the 70-year-old man she says was the child's father. The 23-year-old mother, whose name was not released, is trying to overturn a Social Security Administration denial of benefits from the account of Overton L. White. White, a retiree who had a part-time job, died in 1980 at age 70. The woman con­tends she "dated" White from April I976 until June 11, 1978. Her suit alleges the Social Security Administration erred and that the youngster should be granted surviving child's insurance benefits. The woman charges that the father "was contributing to the support (of the child) at the time of his death." "Evidence in the record shows without any contradiction" that White fathered the child, the suit states. -AP 
Jerome King Criswell, the white-haired television "propheteer," has died following a stroke. He was 75. Criswell, a native of Princeton, Ind., had been admitted to St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, Calif, on Aug. 30, hospital officials said Tuesday. He died Monday. The self-styled psychic, who went only by his last name, claimed he first realized he could predict the future when he would tell his parents, morticians in Indiana, when people were about to die. He went to Hollywood and appeared regularly on the Tonight show and on a local Los Angeles station. Calling himself a "20th century Nostradamus," he claimed 87 percent accuracy for his forecasts on subjects from natural disasters to politics. But in a 1973 Orange County appearance, one of his last, he predicted that Queen Elizabeth II would fall ill and Prince Charles would assume the throne, that Richard Nixon would serve a third presidential term and that within three years all nine members of the U.S. Supreme Court would be women. -AP

Another alcohol story 
Yes folks, here is yet another commentary to go along 
with the recent bombardment of alcohol-related 
stories. But before you hurriedly turn the page in ex­
pectation of the latest Aspirinman installment, I urge 
you to take a few minutes to read on. 

Since the contents ofa letter Dean of StudentsJames Roemer sent to Campus View residents appeared in last Friday's Obseroer, the campus has been buzzing with jokes and jabs regarding his requests of prudence and temperance in alcohol use. The request receiving the most attention from the campus comedians is the sug­gestion that plenty offood be served at parties, especial­ly chips and vegetables. The vegetable jokes have been 
running rampant ever since, and I can't say that I blame the jokesters. Summer squash and Budweiser never has appealed to me as a favorable combination, especially if one ofthem is to be consumed in mass quantities. 
At one party this past weekend, the hosts facetiously carried out Roemer's requests to the letter by making available cans ofcorn along with the cans of beer. 
But if we can stop with the belly laughs for awhile and a lend a more serious ear to Roemer's requests, I think you will find some very positive and sensible elements which should be given serious consideration. 

and sensible and an attempt should be made to follow them. Limiting the size of parties, serving food and soft drinks and avoiding the large keg party are suggestions that can be easily followed. In fact, we all have a respon­sibility to implement some control measures at our parties to ensure the welfare of those who attend. 
Unfortunately, though, the requests made by Roemer will probably be ignored by most of the Campus View residents merely because they were just that; requests. Because they were not issued as a direct command, they will be laughed at and forgotten. 
Indiana Univers t ity's Dean ofStudents, Michael Gor­don, was not so lenient. He claims that alcohol abuse at 
I.U. is directly related to problems of vandalism, academic failures and sex-related assaults. To enforce

break out, vandalism erupts l 11 and general chaos becomes 
the norm. 

In one recent incident, two on-campus residents were arrested by South Bend police after breaking a window at a service station near Campus View. They had just left a·party at Cat mpus View and, with asense of irresponsibility that often accompanies the over con­sumption of beer, committed an act which could have gotten them into a lot oftrouble. 
Most people can get drunk and have a good time in the process. It is the people who are affected by too much alcohol that their sense ofresponsiblity and good judgement abandons them. When this happens, they become dangerous to themselves and others. The problem is magnified at off-campus parties because many students drive to them. After filling up at the party, they then proceed to get in their cars and drive home or to the bars, all the while endangering their lives and the lives ofothers on the road. 
Will it have to take more alcohol-related deaths 
before students finally realize the seriousness of the 
problem? 

The requests made by Roemer are e11tirely practical 
 , which has gotten out ofcon­
trol  and  have  to  be  met  
head-on  with  radical  
measures.  

For once it appears that the Notre Dame administra­tion is placing its faith in the intelligence and common sense of the students. Roemer could just as easily in­itiate Gestapo tactics similar to the ones practiced at 
I.U. The drinking age is still 21 north of Bloomington, 
and most of the students attending off-campus parties are under age. In effect, Roemer is throwing the ball into the students' court. We can run recklessly and hap­hazardly with it or we can attack the situation with a 
well thought and intelligent game plan. We all have to take the responsiblity upon ourselves to be more care­ful of our own actions and those of our friends. Unless we approach the grand weekend parties with more cau­
tion and restraint, a serious problem, perhaps even a death, could very easily result from our recklessness. If the situation worsens, then the administration will take the ball back and be forced to take actions similar to those at I.U. And none of us want that.

Fire fighters revtse tacttcs inmine blaze 
MORGANFIELD, Ky. (AP) ­Workers battling a fire inside an Is­land Creek Coal Co. mine near here changed tactics early yesterday after two days ofunsuccessful attempts to douse the flames. 
Information about the fire was sketchy, bur state officials have been at the scene "around the clock" since the fire's discovery Sunday, said James Thorp, a mining inspec­tor supervisor with the state Mines and Minerals Department. 
Thorp said his agency was notified 

of the fire shortly after 6 p.m. Sun­
day, when it was discovered by Is­
land Creek workers. 
John Gray. a spokesman for Island Creek's western Kentucky division, issued a short statement on the fire, stating only that workers were trying to extinguish the fire from the surface yesterday. 
Thorp said he did not believe the fire would "endanger anybody in the surrounding area." 
A company official who did not want to be identified said yesterday that workers tried for about 48 hours to extinguish the fire by fight· ing it on the inside of the Hamilton No.1 mine. 
That strategy was halted about midnight Tuesday, and workers planned to seal the mine to keep the fire from igniting gas, the official said. Under the new plan, holes would be drilled from the surface 
and the affected areas of the mine would be flooded with water. 
The fire began after a slate fall, ap­parently when the chunk of rock struck trolley wires and ignited tim­ber inside the mine, the company of­ficial said.

Roaring through the narrow streets at high speed. they headed north along the Rhine. A photog­rapher said at least I 0 police cars gave chase. and a helicopter over­head tracked them.

After about 1 5 miles. the gunmen hegan shooting at their pursuers. police said. The driver ofone police car lost control and crashed into a lamppost. But the chase went on. 

In Bad Godesberg, a southern sub­urb of Bonn, the gunmen seized a hattered ford from a couple. trans­ferred their hostages and the money to it. and fled back up the Rhine. 
Pausing in Remagen. they seized a parked police car, but in a shootout with the police a bullet grazed the woman hostage's shoulder. The gun­men drove offwith her and the bank director but later returned to Remagen, freed the woman and went on with only one captive. 
The police then apparently lost track ofthem.

recovered, told reporters Tuesday that he bought the Tylenol at a local drug store two weeks before taking the capsule -well in advance of reports ofthe Chicago-area deaths. 
Police Sgt. Jack Lee in Oroville said the account of the purchase Blagg gave to authorities has not been confirm~d." Blagg was ques­tioned for two hours Tuesday by FBI agents. 
The U.S. Food ·and Drug Ad­ministration said strychnine was found in two other bottles obtained from the Longs Drug Store where Blagg said he purchased his. 
"It's highly suspected at this point 
n time that it was a copycat crime," 
Lee said. 
That assessment was disputed by Illinois Attorney General Tyrone Fahner, who is heading a task force 
of more than 100 investigatm:s from federal, county and state agencies in­vestigating the cyanide deaths of seven people. 
"The strychnine case does not seem to have been inspired by what happened in Chicago," he said. "We see no link. The FBI here is working 
with the FBI in California." 

Fahner said task force inves­tigators will continue to operate on the premise they have followed  from the first day -that a single per· son striking at random loaded Tylenol capsules with cyanide and placed them on the shelves of five 
Chicago-area stores last week. 
"We have not ruled out the pos­sibility ofmore than one person," he said, but added, "it looks less and less that it's more than one." 
Cook County Medical Examiner Albert Stein said yesterday that lab tests indicate cyanide could have remained in the adulterated capsules "for at least 48 hours" with· out revealing tell-tale" signs of their content. 
Fahner said more than I,OOO per· sons had been interviewed since the task force was established and that investigators have narrowed down that list to "eight or nine" potential suspects, all local residents. 
"They were all in the Chicago area at the relevant time," said Fahner. "We're not concerned about their leaving the jurisdiction."

World mourns Sadat's death 
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -Wiping a tear from her eye, the widow of President Anwar Sadat placed a wreath on his grave yesterday -the first anniversary of his assassination by Moslem fanatics. 
Relatives and friends, including the widow of the shah ofIran, stood by Jihan Sadat beneath a brilliant desert sky as an honor guard placed the flowers on Sadat's white marble tomb, 300 yards from the site where he was gunned down. 
Some ofthe women, all dressed in mourning black, wept during the brief, low-key ceremony. Farah Diba, widow of thelranian monarch whom Sadat sheltered in his final months, stood gaunt-faced beneath a black lace shawl. 
The shah's son and self· proclaimed heir, Reza, was among the mourners for Sadat, architect of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. 
Mrs. Sadat, wearing dark glasses and a black dressed buttoned to the neck, was also accompanied by her son Gamal and President Hosni Mubarak's wife Suzan, who rarely ap· pears in public. They listened as a Moslem sheik read from the Koran, and then Mrs. Sadat shook hands with other mourners, who wept

Audience applauds 
Reagan tells republican to 'shQt up' 
WASHINGTON (AP)-President 

Reagan, flushed with anger, told a 
Republican congressional candidate 
to "shut up" yesterday after being 
repeatedly interrupted with the ac­
cusation that he had abandoned con­
servative causes. 
"I don't know who the two ofyou 
are, but you haven't said a word 
that's true yet," Reagan told the can­
didate, Gary Richard Arnold ofSanta 
Cruz, Calif., and an unidentified man 
who applauded Arnold's remarks. 
For more than five minutes, Reagan defended himself against Ar­nold's charges as they stood 25 feet apart in the ornate East Room of the White House. Arnold was among about 90 GOP candidates invited in for a series ofpolitical briefings and a presidential pep talk. 
After Arnold interrupted him more than a half-dozen times and refused to let him finish an answer, Reagan lost his patience and shouted, "Shut up. Look." 
Arnold sat down shortly after­wards as the president was ap­plauded by the audience. 
The incident began as Arnold, a 
businessman challenging Rep. Leon 
Swedes attack unidentified submarine 
BERGA NAVAL BASE, Sweden (AP) -Forty Swedish vessels and a fleet of helicopters ,yesterday tightened their net around a sub­marine believed to be a Soviet-bloc vessel lurking near a top secret naval base. 
The navy dropped seven depth charges and threatened to sink the sub if it tries to break out of the Swedish trap. 
Naval officials speculated the uni­dentified vessel -believed to be hiding in a narrow, 12-mile-long channel in waters south of Stock­holm -might be a small, new spy sub, possibly remote-controlled and without a crew. 
Sweden has refused to speculate on the nationality of the intruder, but newspapers have said the vessel wa.'i believed to belong to a Warsaw Pact nation. perhaps the Soviet Uni­on or Poland. 
The Kremlin, in its first comment on the incident. said the sub saga may be a hoa..x designed to disrupt Scandinavian-Soviet ties. 
The dramatic sub hunt near the :vlusko naval ba.<>c 18 miles south of Stockholm is the most serious naval incident since October 1981, when a Soviet submarine U-137 ran aground close to the main southern navy base at Karlskrona. 
Yesterday the navy deployed coa.<;t guard commandos and army troops near the search zone to bolster the fleet of hunters, includ­ing a submarine salvage vessel and 10 helicopters. 
"If the suspected submarine tried to break out. we might resort to more drastic methods including sinking it," Navy Capt. Cay Holmberg said. 
"Our goal is to force the sub­marine to surface undamaged," said Holmberg, a veteran anti-submarine warfare specialist. 
"We mean business now. The ves­sel will be identified and then turned away. Our policy not to harm the crew must not be interr>reted as a weakness," he added. 
Since the sub "'as ·~t spotted Friday, 25 depth ch.1rp ·lave been dropped. 
He did not say how sub might 

try to escape, but it was presumed 
he meant the vessel might try to ram 
through nets and wires that have 
been dropped into Holms Bay, 
which is 6'; feet to 14' feet deep. 
Panetta, D-Calif.. rose from his back­row chair as Reagan spoke and said, ":vir. President, you have given us the largest tax increase ...in the United States history ..." 
Two or three members of the audience tried to shove him down into his seat, but Arnold persisted. 
"We do not have the president supporting the presidential program. The Soviets have a higher increase in trade. The Soviets get the wheat and Americans get the shaft. We have a Tylenol taxation situation here, and we have a Reagan-mortis setting into the nation's body politic." 
He complained that Republicans 
such as himselfwho opposed the tax 
increase have been denied GOP 
campaign funds. 
Reagan tried to rebut the charges 
with arguments, and at one point he 
tried humor. "I thought this was for 
Republican candidates." 
The president said the tax in­
crease "that we reluctantly sup­
ported in order to get continued 
reductions in spending was not the 
largest tax increase in history. A 
third of it was our promise to start 
trying to collect money that is owed 
by taxpayers who are ducking their 
taxes and that we're trying to get."

The audience whistled and roared applause. 
"I don't know what you've been reading," he told Arnold, "but you don't know what you're talking about ..." 
The incident overshadowed 
Reagan's speech, in which he said, "I 
believe ...that today, America is 
stronger than it wa.<> two years ago, 
stronger economically, militarily, 
and yes, even morally." 
Arnold told reporters outside the White House that "Reagan has lost touch with Reaganomics. Reagan is not Reagan....Somebody has to say that the emperor has no clothes." 
White House deputy press secretary Larry Speakes said after­ward that Reagan asked the name of the man who interrupted him. "It seemed a bit out of the ordinary," Speakes said of the incident. "The president responded with his usual eloquence."

Domestic automakers'September car sales fell 
5.8 per cent from the same month a year earlier, industry officials reported in Detroit They also reported that the 1982 model year turned out to be the poorest for U.S. companies in 21 years. The five major U.S. producers said they sold 488,452 new cars last month down from 518,522 a year earlier. Sales ofimported cars showed an increase over the same period but were down to their lowest level for a model year in four years. Importers reported 182,248 cars sold in September, up 9.2 percent from 168,845 in September, 1982. Imports' market share for this month also fell to 27.2 from the August record of32.7percent. However, they had held only a 24.3 percent share in September oflast year. -AP 
all Street Update 
The stock marketran up its second biggest gain ever Wednesday in a new outburst of buying by investing institutions expecting lower interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 in­dustrials jumped 37.07 to a 14 month high of944.26. The gain was surpassed in Wall Street annals only by a 38.81-point rise on Aug. 17. In the last eight weeks, the DowJones industrials have climbed 167 points, seemingly foreshadowing an economic recovery even as most other evidence has pointed toward a deepening recession. Analysts said a drop in some money-market interest rates helped touch offthe buying spree. When the rate on federal funds -short· term loans between banks -dropped as low as 8 percent, invest­ment professionals evidently took it as a sign that the Federal Reserve had decided to encourage further declines in rates. .

Foreign internships 
AIESEC offers experience 
By ALEX SZIL VAS 
B&TEdttor 
Ifyou are interested in developing your leadership abilities while gaining some practical business ex­perience, you may want to explore AlESEC. 
AIESEC (a French acronym for the 
Association oflnternational Science, 
Economics, and Business Students) 
is a student-run non-profit organiza­
tion seeking to promote internation­
al awareness and cooperation. Its 
specific goals are to identify and 
train a select group ofstudents with 
outstanding leadership potential in 
business and related fields. 
AIESEC operations involve over 30,000 students at 400 universities in 59 countries. In the United States, AIESEC committees are located at over 60 academic institutions. 
Foremost among AIESEC's Inter­national development programs is the trainee exchange. Each year AIESEC-U.S. places over 300 foreign students in American companies for internships lasting from two to 18 months. An equal number of 
American students are placed abroad. 
The AIESEC local committee at Notre Dame managed to place nine foreign students in South Bend last year with such firms as Uniroyal, Crowe Chizek and Co., and Memorial and Saint Joseph's Hospi­
'The aft-encompassing

tals. Meanwhile four Notre Dame students spent from eight to twelve weeks in Italy, West Germany, Iceland and Finland. 
The national organization awards credits to local committees on the basis of performance and achieve· ment. Each credit allows the local committee to place one student

abroad. Aside from these credits, the number of students which a local committee can place overseas is based on the number of interships the committee finds for foreign stu­dents. In order to get a company to employ a foreign intern, "We have to sell AIESEC to them," Julie Glasgow, public relations director for AIESEC­Notre Dame said. "We have to familiarize them with our organiza­tion and with the quality of people which they would be hiring." 
The procedure for being placed in a foreign internship is highly com­petitive. Each local committee ranks its members based upon the opinion ofits Board ofAdvisors. The profiles of these members are then for­warded to the central organization. It is here that members are matched up with available internships on the basis of their ranking by the local committee and the number ofinter­nships the local committee has won. 
But there is more to AIESEC than the foreign trainee exchange program, Glasgow explained. "The all-encompassing purpose ofAIESEC is experience," she stressed. "and you gain that whether you get a traineeship or not." 
"You don't have to be a business major to join," she continued. "You just have to identity a part ofAIESEC that you want to work for. Everyone involved contributes something to a committee and in the same way they gain from their involvement." 

Southpaws prone to disorders 
From Discover News Seroice 
Left-handed people are more prone to learning disorders than the right -handed. 
The reason, scientists believe, is that left-handedness is sometimes the result of prenatal damage to the brain's left hemisphere, which con· trois the right side of the body; be­cause the left hemisphere is the center of language function in most people, learning disabilities as well as left-handedness may result from its impairment. 
Two neurologists now report that left-handed people are also likelier to suffer from various immune­system disorders of the gut ­Crohn's disease (a form ofileitis), ul· cerative colitis and celiac disease ­as well as migraine headaches and a kind of hypotheroidism called Has­himoto's disease. 
Writing in a recent issue of the 
Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences, Dr. Norman 
Geschwind of Boston's Beth Israel 
Hospital and Dr. Peter Behan ofGlas­
gow University suggest that left­
handedness and immune diseases 
are linked by a shared biological fac­
tor: the male hormone testosterone. 
Geschwind says there is strong experimental evidence for the no­tion that an abnormally high level of testosterone in a fetus causes left­handedness by delaying the migra­tion of nerve cells to the left hemisphere during brain formation. Testosterone also suppresses the thymus, the gland that activates the body's defense system. 
But Geschwind offers some com­fort to the world's southpaws: The great majority ofleft-handers do not have these diseases.

types ofaudiences as possible. 
"In the old days, network radio dominated," Chanin recalls. "They provided entertainment and personalities. But TV took the per­sonalities away. Radio became more locally­oriented. Then music began to move over to the FM band, and AM stations needed new kinds ofprogramming." 
The problem arose in that local stations could not afford to fill large segments oftime. That's where Mutual has made its comeback. 
They have been covering Notre Dame foot­ball for 15 years, and just signed an agreement to broadcast the Irish games for five more years. They provide NFL games, bowl games, ~olf. and basketball ~ames as well. The news 

department offers two newscasts an hour, as 
well as ·a number of other special programs. 
Mutual is the home of the king of night-time 
talk shows, Larry King. 
"We're not. done yet, either," says Chanin. "We are almost ready to put an uplink here at Notre Dame. We could have had it this year, but we just weren't satisfied with the equip­ment. Itwill be perfected in 1983, and we'll be able to send football, basketball -even some Midwest news stories -directly onto the satellite from here." 
Radio is far from dead, despite the excite­ment and innovation in the other media. And Mutual's resurgence is proof. 
HEY, are you THINKING out there? It is very discouraging to walk across campus and catch glimpses of Macho Man, Chic Woman and Snobby Intellectual. I feel like stopping dead in my tracks and screaming out, "Hey you guys, are you Chic Woman, joe Cool, and Snobby Intellectual? Are you thinking for yourselves?" 
David M. Schorp 

Chautauqua in Faith 
Fraternities and sororities of most big schools are dominated by "Preppy Materialist", who is a supermutant of Macho Man or Chic Woman, with Snobby Intellec· tual. Instead ofexemplifying brotherhood and fostering true comradarie, very often "fraternities" are the epitome of material mis­guidance. If refusing to think for themselves, members might hide their insecurities in numbers, assume the "correct" appearance and mannerisms, and then begin looking down upon those not oftheir social elite. Frats are a· good example of the trap our need for attention and security will lull us into. How great is the amount of potential wasted on so· cia! status, money, sex, and other misguided "manners ofbeing." 
There is both an easy and a hard way of seeking happiness. Faith is the hard way. To quote a priest, "...our world is struggling to believe only in the power of man. The greatest duping of people today is the idolatry that we can build a tower ofBabel that will save usfrom all evil. Ourfaith is in romanticism (in a bad sense of the word) wherein one believes that all suffering is 

meaningless. Man's basic search is for meaning -the emptiness of meaning is an 'eternal death.' jesus taught us, on fbe con­trary, that there is meaning (life) even in suffering." 
Faith calls us to become aware ofourselves in relation to the others around us, and in doing so, to become open and vulnerable to our own insecurities, and conscious of the mistakes we make. This is a frightening responsibility to assume! And this respon­sibility, this hardship never stops, as we are challenged each and every day, minute-by· 
minute, to admit our imperfections and become more humble, serving, but happy persons. The upward spiral of faith requires effort in the climbing. 
At about this particular time ofour lives we 

students are confronted with the notion, "I am 
about to learn the tools I will need the rest of 
my life to serve society. Which vocation shall! 
choose?" Isn't it inevitable that we go through 
a period ofintense consternation as we try to 
figure out for ourselves, amid all possible, 
wide open alternatives, how to "love the 
world"? The sooner we find an answer, the 
better. For if we do not know, might we have 
to cope with a mid·life "identity crisis"? (Or 
else, spend the rest of our lives in "quiet 
desperation?") Can you imagine God saying, 
"You can pay me now, or you can pay me 
later"? 
When my ways are fixed, it is a very hard, 

lengthy process for me to change. To abandon 
the thoughts and actions I am used to, and to 
assume new ones, requires in itself security, 
strength, faith, and God's grace. As any ac­
complishment is only as fulfilling as the effort 
necessary in its achievement, the road to 
happiness is a rocky one.

The Purdue Boilermaker~ had their backs to the wall, 
and were faced with almost inescapable victory. But 
Quarterback Scott Campbell put on an incredible per­
formance. wtth ~ome help from the Purdue special
