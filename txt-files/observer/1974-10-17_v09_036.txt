Staff Reporter 
John T. Conway, president of Common Cause, said yesterday that the Watergate affair had a significant impact on recent congressional passage of the new campaign Finance Bill. Conway cited the passage of the bill as a success for his citizen's lobby. 
"Watergate has uncovered the corruption that exists in the system," Conway said, with the result of an increaseddemandfor legislation for reform. 
Conway regards Common Cause as "probably the singular Jy · most effective organization in dealing with the House of Representatives, the last bastion of support for the war-making operation." 
Common Cause was formed· in 1970 by John Gardner, former Cabinet member in the Johnson administration. According to Conway, Gardner "felt that what was needed in this country, was an independent organized citizen's lobby, that could go to work on all the elements of the political process to open them up and make them more accessible to the people." 
Speaking in Grace Hall, Conway focused on the provisions of the bill which prohibits the use of cash. set a limit of $1000 for individual contributions and a limit on the amount of money a candidate can spend, and require campaign treasuerers to run the campaign on one book account. 
In addition, the bill provides for public funding by 
matching private contributions for every candidate 
that demonstrates that he has wide-spread grass­
root support, Conway explained. 


Jaworski says evidence will prove Nixon's guilt 
WASHINGTON <UPI) -Spe­cial Prosecutor Leon Jaworski said Wednesday that evidence in the Watergate cover-up trial will establish the guilt of Richard M. Nixon in the conspiracy just as though he had entered a guilty plea. 
Jaworski's former top assis­tant, Philip A. Lacovara, agreed with that assessment and also voiced another strong objection to President Ford's pardon of his predecessor. 
Jaworski, who is leaving the post of special Watergate prosecutor next week to resume law practice in Houston, said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal: 
"The evidence will show he's guilty, just as much as a guilty plea." 
While indicating he had no quarrel with Ford's decision to clear Nixon in advance of any Watergate-connected crimes, Jaworski said acceptance of the pardon was another indication of the former president's guilt. 
"A pardon isn't just a beautiful document to frame and hang on the wall," he said. "You are offered a pardon only because it is believed you can be charged and convicted. You accept it only if you want to be cleared." 
Lacovara, who resigned from the Watergate prosecution team five weeks ago, said on the NBC-TV Today program that the pardon decision was "fun­damentally erroneous and in­consistent with the values that I, at least, had been working to 
achieve  in  the  American  
judicial system."  
And  commenting  on  the  

cover-up trial of five former aides to Nixon, Lacovara said: "If you take at face value the representations by the prosecu­tors at the opening of the trial . . . you can fairly well assume that substantial evidence of Mr. Nixon's criminal involvement will be presented to the jury ... 
"We went to the Supreme Court in July of this year to 
Conway also stressed Common Cause in­vovlement in the successful passage of two con­stitutional amendments-which lowered the voting age to 18 and the proposed Equal Rights Amen­dments. 
Presently, the group is concerned with Congressional reform, specifically the elimination of the seniority system which will end the Senate's use of the filbuster and leave more room for the Senate committees and conference committees. 
Common Cause also hopes to enlist Congess as an ally in reforming the executive branch, specifically in the 1CIA, the Justice Department, the use of the IRS and the accountability of White House staff members. 
The group, boasting over 325,000 members in all 50 states and in every congressional district, is funded by the contributions of its members. For the past four years, the group has been "putting together what is now generally considered to be the most effective citizen's lobby in Washington," stated Conway. 
The membership is oranized by Congressional districts, so that the members can tie directly into the lobbying process. The group was originally concentrated on lobbying at the federal level only, but it is now in the process of organizing com­parable efforts at the state level. 
Conway concluded saying that "a solid wave of concern is building nationwide, among citizens. They're getting ready to straighten things out. I think we're going to see some really intersting things in the upcoming elections." 
obtain enforcement of the subpoena to President Nixon for an additional 55 or 60 tapes beyond those that were availa­ble to the House Judiciary Committee. And I think that you can fairly infer from that that there will be additional items of information that will come out of this trial about Mr. Nixon's role." 
Jaworski, who was special prosecutor for 11 months after Nixon had Archibald Cox fired from the job, said of the the former president's pardon: 
"It's a mistake to believe there would have been more evidence for the public if he had been tried. If he had been pardoned after indictment, the public would have had no new information. 
"If he had gone to trial, he could have invoked his Fifth Amendment guarantees against self-incrimination, pleaded guilty, and we wouldn't have learned any new details."

Chicano injustices denounced in lecture 
by John Corrao 
Staff Reporter 

Professor Horward Glickstein 
director of the Center for Civii 
Rights at the Notre Dame Law 
School, denounced injustices being 
committed against the Chicano 
population in the U.S. in a lecture 
last night in the Library lounge. 
Professor Glickstein traced the 
plight of the Mexican-American 
throughout the history of the 
United States. He stated Chicanos 
were at a disadvantage from the 
beginning because of the way they 
became American citizens, being 
absorbed into the U.S. against 
their will after the Mexican War. 
Denied Political Power 
Glickstein emphasized that in the early years of our country Mexican-Americans were denied any form of political power. Despite the majority of Chicanos living in the annexed area, government of newly-conquered territory remained in white con­trol. 
"In fact not until the populations of Arizona and New Mexico were over 50 per cent white were the territories admitted to the union, although they had met the necessary population requirements years before," said Glickstein. 
Turning to the present day situation of the Chicanos Glickstein stated that the media~ income for a Chicano family today is about $7500, two-thirds that of the average white family. He added that over 7 million Chicanos live below the subsistence level unemployment among Chicanos i~ twice that of whites and union discrimination against Chicanos is greater than that of any other minority group. 
Education Needed 
Glickstein emphasized education as one major step in the remedy of Chicano problems. He noted that today's schools are totally "anglo­oriented," --geared only to the needs of the white upper middle class. 
"Chicanos for years have had a great problem with the language barrier," he stated. "Most Spanish-speaking children are forced to use English in school, which in many cases is the reason for their difficulties." He noted that only 60 per cent of all Mexican American children complete high school, and that three-fifths of these have deficiencies.

"Another factor working against Chicano students is the nature of the textbooks used," said Glickstein. "The books tend to disparage the achievements of Mexican-Americans and to minimize the roles they have played in society." 
Glickstein said U.S. schools in general suppress the culture of the Chicano andnignore the needs of Spanish-speaking students. He cited the poor counseling facilities for Mexican-American students as an example. "There are very few Chicano counselers in our schools in camparison with the percentage of Chicano students," he said. 
Standardized Tests Discriminate 
Glickstein also critized the system of standardized tests used to evaluate Mexican-American students, stating that they are based on white upper class norms. He noted that "many bright

Auto repairs can be nightmares, particularly since most car owners don't understand the workings of the motor and don't know if they are being told the truth about repairs. The consumer should understand and adopt the following general guidelines to automobile repair: 
i. Compare labor charges by phoning several service stations and auto repair garages. Labor charges do differ. 
2. 
When you take your car to be repaired', ask for the cost of repair. After receiving this information, set a dollar limit for yourself. Insist that you should be called if the amount will be more than this limit. 

3. 
When an estimll.te is given, be sure to clarify whether the estimated cost of repair includes . 


both parts and labor charges. 

4. 
Ask if new or used parts will be put in the car. Often used parts will be placed in the car and the consumer charged for new parts. 

5. 
A few service stations charge storage fees for overnight repairs. Ask if coverage fees are charged. 

6. 
Insist that you get back any old parts that were replaced. Make this clear when you take 


your car in to be repaired. 

7. Ask if repairs are guaranteed. 
If so, ask to have the guarantee in writing. Note that automobile dealers are more apt to give written guarantees for major repairs than service stations. 
8. 
Plan ahead when tires and batteries are to be replaced. These are frequently sale items and substantial sums of money can be saved if these items are purchased on sale.

St. Mary's stu dents transformed their campus into the world of German Oktobe rfest yesterday as decorations were painted in dorms and dinner included sauerkraut and music from the Veiner­schnitzle Six band. 
Activities yesterday included the hayride shuttle, a pick-up truck filled with hay and p.~mpkins offering free rides between St. Mary's and Notre Dame. 
The German dinner, enacted by Saga food service and third floor McCandless residents, made stepping in line like stepping into a cabaret. Skits led by Sue Rauen, social commission representative from Mccandless, and friends,

Complainers about the ND-SMC 
social situation will be given their 
big chance beginning 9 p.m. 
Friday at the Sadie Hawkins 
Dance. Students will not be 
allowed to enter the Stepan Center 
Dance if they are accompanied by 
a member of the opposite sex and 
they will only be allowed to leave 
after finding a date from the 
unattached people inside, ac­
cording to Mary Draper, dance 
coordinator. 
"Since no one will be coming to the dance with a date, there will be none of the usua I pressures on the students of Notre Dame to find a mate," said Draper. "We have publicized the dance at both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's and both sexes will be expected to find their dates on the inside." 
Plans for the event include a 
kissing booth monitored by both 
male and female kissees, a hit­
ching post where one may be 
initiated into the rights of 
matrimony and refreshments of all 
kinds, including cider and donuts. 
Entertainment will be provided by 
the musical group WIND. 
The event is sponsored by the 
Breen-Phillips Hall Government. 
Further questions will be an­
swered by Mary Draper 1341 and 
Kathy Grace 1298. The price of 
admission to this event is one

Thus far, only 103 tickets have 
been turned in to the football ex­

550 tickets must be turned in for 
the exchange program to work. 
"I'm terribly dissappointed in 
the results up to this point," Dan 
Novak, head of the program, 
commented. "I thought the

Donate Your Ticket 
THE OBSERVER. 
If you can, try to remember back to the thrill ofyour first college football game. Now, think of what it would mean to give someone less fortunate than yourself the chance to experience that same thrill. 
This weekend, Notre Dame students are again being asked to donate their football tickets so that underprivileged children from the South Bend area can see the Irish olay. 
The ticket program benefits the Neigh­borhood Study Help Program, the South Bend Big Brothers, and the Logan Center project. For the past four years, the plea for ticket donation has been met with amazing response. Last year, over seven hundred tickets were donated. This year, a goal of eight hundred has been set. 
These kids will most likely be getting their first chance to see a college football game. Moreover, it is a Notre Dame game; a factor which to a child means more than we may realize. 
It looks as though the Irish will, as the sports writers say, romp over Army this weekend. So the sacrifice is not too much to ask. And there are three more home games in the future: Pitt, Miami, and Air Force. 
Aside from the practical con­siderations, the chance to help someone less fortunate has become rare in the Notre Dame community. Now is a good time to trY a gesture of charity.

Grad Apathy and 
Elton John 
...., ....lllllilllliil...•~•huqh ·ftarftlan 
1 

Not having enowgh coherent thoughts this week to make one coherent column, I }ust strung together a column from two or three of my thoughts that w.ould cohere. Be forewarned. 
Grad Apathy 

Graduate students are apathetic. I didn't realize how apathetic until the two 'Grad' columns appeared and appealed for letters. No one wrote, although quite a few grads mentioned the columns privately and a few suggested I was too soft and about the only people who didn't especially like the columns were the MBAs who 
resent being considered jocks and I can't hwlp what they're considered. Even the Grad Student Union hasn't sent a letter to the Observer defending their honor. Either 1) they don't care what grads think of them, 2) I'm not worth the trouble of bothering with, or 3·) they're illiterate. Most likely a combination of the three. <Incidentally·, the president of the GSU is MBA Ann Darin). 
An interesting theory concerning the causes of grad apathy was given by a 2nd year grad student not too long ago. According to him, grads are apathetic as the only possible a reaction to the Notre Dame community. 
Most ND graduate students did not attend du Lac as an un­dergraduate and consequently must have gone to some other in­stitutuon much more likely to be rationally operated and, while necessarily liberal, certainly could not have had the ridiculous rules we find foisted upon the hapless students here at Notre Dame. 
By and large their undergraduate schools probably had such shocking (and not doubt immoral) fixtures as co-ed dorms, 24 hour open visitation,and lack of a rule suspending students who stay the night together. 
Such grads, no doubt, have trouble adjusting to an Ad­ministration which suddenly realizes that, after years of operating to the contrary, it is not right and even illegal to allow students under 21 to drink liquor. 
What can a grad do but be bewildered at the hysteria of a football weekend when alumni flood the bookstore and the quad and win­ning a football game becomes the be-ali and end-all? 
How else could a grad who attended some other institution for the previous four years react to Administrators the likes of Don Bouffard and Fr. Burtchaell who state that Notre Dame basketball games are not necessarily intended for students and it might be best for all if the students didn't buy any tickets? 
On how many other campus to which the grads have been ex­posed to can we find such endearing Notre Dame fixtures as panty raids and a co-ed student body sharply split into vicious male and female factions? 
Therefore, according to the theory, the only way to become in­tegrated into ND would be to spend four years here as an undergrad and only then (maybe) would the campus make some sense For those who didn't and are accustomed to some other form of reality, apathy is !h~ only rational and sane a~ternative. 
Elton John 

Elton John tickets go on sale in less than a week and one is lead to wonder whether it would be worthwhile trying to get tickets or not. How long can the lines be? The situation isn't helped any by the ACC, the promoter of the event. Afew questions arise in a situation of this sort, the primary one being why ND and SMC students aren't given preference to the tickets. It would surely benefit the students if either 1) ticket slaes wre limited to ND and SMC students, 2 l students were given first choice or 3) students were given a discount. Besides vague references to moral obligations to South Bend, there appears no reason that such a policy should not be in force. 
Besides not giving preference to ND and SMC students, the promoters are also courting disaster by an asinine pricing policy. For those of you who don't know, all tickets in front of Elton sell for $7.50 while those behind him·sell for $6.50. Consequently, the front row rickets will cost the student as much as back row bleacher seats, on the first come. As it is, five South Bend cops will be stationed at each ticket outlet (so says the Ombudsman) to handle the crowds. A little wiser policy might have the tickets · range from $10.50 to $5.50 depending, like most concert tickets do, on seating position. Better yet would be a range from $12.50 to $7.50 with a $3.00 discount for students. No doubt the concert would sell out just as quickly, but perhaps without the 91>r 10 hours of waiting and with SMC and ND students a wee bit happier.
