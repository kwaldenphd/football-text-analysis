day February 22, in the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's dining halls. 
The exchange will consist of 500 ND students going to the St. Mary's dining hall, and 500 SMC students attending dinner at the two ND dining halls. 
Sign-ups at ND, which will be on a "first-come, first-served" basis, will be held during the dinner hours of February 18, in the North and South dining halls. It was asked, however, that only students who had never eaten at the opposite campus' dining Halls and who were Will­ing to experiment volunteer for the dinner. Students of SMC will have the opportunity to sign up at their dining hall on Wednes­day and Thursday, February 17 and 18. 
Bob Ohlemiller, chariman of Research and Development said that the students taking part in the exchange would receive their admission tickets when they signed up. 
Working with Ohlemiller are Di~ne Shahade and Mary Ann Wnght. 
A number of positive aspects 
were outlined which everyone 
agreed to unconditionally ac­
cept. Among these were the 
complete coordination of aca­
demic affairs, development, ad­
missions, dining hall facilities 
fund raising, and an exchange of 
dormitory residence. Miss Hen­
ninger cited a number of propos­
als which included opoeing the 
Rockne Memorial and parts of 
the Athletic and Convocation 
Center to girls, and also better 
utilization of SMC facilities 
(such as opening the clubhouse 
to seminars, etc.). 
SMC students were also found 
to be in favor of more women 
on the Notre Dame faculty, and 
encouraged more mixed social 
activities between the two 
schools. Finally, Miss Hennin­
ger's survey called for an end to 
course overlaps and biased coun­
seling, in which SMC students 
were discouraged from taking 
courses at NO and vice versa. 
The second part of the forum was devoted to a question and answer period and an informal discussion session. Miss Tracey fielded questions concerning co­education and merger, aided by members of various committees working on the student report. 
Questions for the most part centered around merger, what the structure of SMC would be if ti merged with the University, 
how the faculty would be affect­
ed by merger and if and how

admissions requirements would be changed. The majority of those in attendance felt that SMC. should not be a strictly all-female institution, and that more efforts toward education should be made than have been already effected. 
The general feeling was that it would be beneficial to both St. Mary's and Notre Dame if they both went coed, and the most logical move would be for them to do it together. 
One student cited results from a survey taken among SMC stu­dents. In response to the quest­ion, "Would you return to St. 

Mary's if Notre Dame went coed independently?" approximately 90% of the students said no. The student therefore stated that it was not a question of whether SMC could afford to go coed with Notre Dame, but rather whether it could afford not to. 
MiSs Tracey pointed out that the final decision rests with the Board of Trustees, and the ques­tion involves a number of securi­ty, disciplinary, and parietal problems. A decision on coedu­cation will probably be forth­coming after the SMC Board of Trustees meeting on March 21 . 
Imhoff retains presidency 

in Badin Hall elections 
Incumbent Buz Imhoff de­molished the challenge of Tom Farmer's write-in candidacy to recapture the Badin Hall Presi­dency in an election held yester­day. 
Imhoff, a Chicago, Illinois, Government major, collected ninety votes to twenty for fellow-Junior Farmer. There were seven scattered votes and one "no" vote. 
Vice-President Bob Higgins easily won re-election by turning back Freshman Joe Griffin and the write-in campaign of Junior Dave Barry. Higgins, a Sopho­more, received seventy-five votes to eighteen for Barry and sixteen for Griffin. Farmer collected four in that contest. 
In the most tightly-contested race of the evening, Pat "Red­man" Tyrrell beat Freshman Steve Mayer to assume the post of Hall Secretary. Tyrrell suc­ceeds Frank Chartier of Detroit. 
Incumbent treasurer Dan Ryan, who ran unopposed, laughed his way through the election as he collected one hun­dred-four of the one hundred­eighteen votes cast. 
The vote:

Sham! 
The letter of censure written by the St. Mary's Chapter of the AAUP should finally bring to light the "unChristian" dealings of the present administration, and cause some serious rethinking on the part of all factions of this college community. 
The activities on the part of the present administration in the past few months have been passingly commented on by those involved and generally ignored by the rest of the so-called community. Consider the firing of certain individuals in the college, with no clear cut reasons. Consider the appointment of new members of the administration with out regard to the community government held so dearly by the college. And even more recent, consider the alteration of jobs and the elimination of jobs without Sr. Alma's and the administration's regard of Christian attitudes expressed so well by them in the memos of first semester. All these actions have created a distrust and apathy among the members of the college, and the resignation of one of the high officials in protest. 
St. Mary's College has ceased to be a "Christian community". It has ceased to be a community of any sort. This censure represents the true extent to which the decay has gone. It is now time for the administration to stop evading the ideals for which it proports to stand. When the faculty protests in disgust, and a high official resigns because of the methods used by this administration, then it is dear that it is time to stop lying to everyone about the Christian .atmosphere at this college. 
Call St. Mary's what it is, what it has become. A sham.

AAUP Statement 

WHEREAS Saint Mary's College as an institution of higher education has formally endorsed and supports the provisions of proper procedures, parti­cipation, and responsibility set forth in the 1966 American Association of University Professors "Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities" and also the national "Statement on Student Rights and Responsibilities" (adopted by the college, 1968), 
AND WHEREAS Saint Mary's as a Catholic college has a commitment to human dignity and individual rights even more explicit than that of secular instHutions, an obligation, moreover, which has this-fall been reemphasized by the Acting President, 

AND WHEREAS the reorganizational changes of January, 1971, have been init,iated and implemented without regard to these principles and com­:mitments, 
THEREFORE, the Saint Mary's College Chapter of the American Associ· ation of University Professors at its meeting, February 4, 1971, voted unanimously to censure Sister M. Alma Peter, Acting President, and Dr. Jack 
J. Detzler, Vice President, and the members of the administration, for their appalling lack of concern for community government and for their lack of Christian awareness of the human beings involved; and also to censure the Board of Trustees of Saint Mary's College for acquiescing in such actions; most 
specifically 
The appointment of a Vice President for Student Affairs and the reorganization of related areas, in arbitrary violation of the Student Government participation; 
The disregard of proper procedures in the appointment of a Freshman Dean and Assistant Dean; 
The alteration of the office of Dean of Students, and the elimination of the offices of Housing Director and of Student Aid without recognition of extensive contribution to the college; 
Alterations in other areas, all of which have created a clim ate of distrust. SAINT MARY'S COLLEGE CHAPTER, AAUP

The Chief 

~:::::::::::~:::::::::::;:::::;::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::;:;:;:;::::::::::::: 
Large droplets of sweat gathered on the upper lip of the clean~haven young man in the Brooks Brothers suit as he put his hand on the doorknob of the Director's office. What he had to say wouldn't go over too well with the Chief, but all that he had been taught at the academy compelled him to do so. 
l-Ie swung open the door to the massive office and stepped in on 

the deep pile rug. He felt a sinking sensation as he walked across the 
room .to the square mahagoney desk that sat in the center of the 
room. A shaft of sunlight beamed out of the window behind the 
desk illuminating it with a golden light. The Chief's chair was turned 
towards the window and it turned only when the young man 
reached the eduge of the desk. 
The young man felt his heart stop in mid-beat as he caught sight of the Chief's face as the chair slowly swiveled around. He studied the face carefully, the receding hairline, the craggy eyebrows, the penetrating eyes, the Roman nose, the tight hard mouth, and the granite jaw, for some sign of what he was thinking. As usual there was none. The young man cleared his throat hesitantly and the bushy brows shot up a fraction of an inch, as the Chief continued to glare at him. 
"Ah-h, Chief, I have some bad news on the case." 
"Which case is that Williams," the Chief said his jaw muscles 

tightening and his eyes growing rounder. 
The young man squeezed his hands together and shuffled his feet 

slightly before replying. 
"The case concerning those rotten Commie, pinko, leftist, Roman 

clerics, sir." 
"What is the bad news, Williams?" the Chief said tla tly. 
"Well, sir, after conducting a most intensive investigation in which 

we tapped two hundred and fifty phones, thirty-two hundred rooms, inc! uding seventeen chapels and forty-five rest rooms and emptied one hundred and seventy-seven wastepaper baskets, forty-nine Kleenex boxes and five shaving kits and steamed open one thousand forty-two letters and searched ninety-two rooms and fifty-two cars all without warrants, we were unable to come up with any evidence to convict those two pinko clerics." 
The Chief's mouth twisted into a snarl, a low animal-like sound emitted from his throat. 
"Williams," he said standing up suddenly, "do you mean to tell me' that you couldn't get some kind of evidence on those lousy, spineless, faggot commie clerics who have guilt written all over their faces?" · 
"No sir, we weren't. Honest, sir, we tried everything. We worked over several nuns with broomsticks to get them to confess, we stubbed out cigarette butts on the backs of several hippies and we threw college students into gladiator cages with drunken hardhats who were armed with lead pipes to get them to tell the truth, but they wouldn't." 
"Did you threaten to take them out and shoot them?" 
"Of course we did, sir." 

The Chief got up and began to pac~ the room. The young man felt his knees begin to knock together and twisted uncomfortably as his shirt, damp with perspiration stuck to his back. 
"We've got to get them, Williams, before they get us. I almost caught two of them under my bed last night, but they got away in the dark." 
The Chief stopped suddenly and began to sniff loudly. 

"Williams, .did you ever notice something funny about the air in this place?" the Chief asked, his eyes gleaming. "No sir, no I never did." "Sit down, Williams," the Chief said motioning the young man to 
a seat in front of the desk. "I think that I have an idea about those two pinko, commie, faggot clerics. Yes sir," the Chief said with a very wide smile," I think I have an idea..."

Dick Tomasoni does what counts 
by Jim DJi1Lildso11 Observer sportswnter 
Notre Dame was leading Den­ver 3-1 last Saturday night early in the third period when a Pio­neer skater, coming in alone on 
Irish goalie Dick Tomasoni, was hooked from behind by a Notre Dame defenseman. The o f ficials awarded the Denver player a penalty shot. 
The capacity crowd of 4222 was on its feet as the Denver player began to skate toward the Irish net. This was a crucial play in the game -a goal might give the Pioneers the momentum they needed to come back and record their 13th straight game without a loss; a save by Toma­soni would be a blow to Den­ver's hopes and would fire up the Irish in their upset attempt. 
The Denver skater tried to fake Tomasoni out of position but the Irish netminder wasn't fooled. When the shot came, Tomasoni made the stop and the fans in the arena went wild. The Irish went on to beat Denver 4-2 and Tomasoni finished the game with 42 saves, 20 in the last period. 
Tomasoni, a junior from Chis­holm, Minn., who has been the top Irish goalie since coming to Notre Dame, has made many fine saves while tending goal for the Irish this season, although none were as dramatic as that stop against Denver. Goalie is a rather unenviable position to play because when the net­minder makes a mistake he's out in the open and everyone can see it. He's the last man with a chance to stop the puck from going into the goal and that puts a lot of pressure on the goalie, but Tomasoni seems to thrive on pressure. 
"I enjoy games where there is a lot at stake or games where I have to stop a good number of shots," Tomasoni said."You feel more a part of the game and it's easier to stay alert when you have to make 30-some saves." 
Tomasoni began to play goalie when he was ten years old. "Mv older brother had been playing for a few years and one day they dragged mo down to the rink to play with them," he recalled. "In pick-up games like that, the worst skater ends up playing goalie and that's what happened to me. It was different, and fun, so I stuck with it." 


Dick has the quick reflexes so necessary for a goalie but finds that reflexes won't help if the goalie doesn't concentrate. "It's important to keep thinking all the time you're on the ice," he explained. "You really have to watch the puck." 
This season has been impor­tant for the Irish icers, as they have held their own against top-flight competition. Notre Dame has made the extremely rapid jump from club play to WCHA competition in just four years -a remarkable effort. 
"We've come a long way since my freshman year," Tomasoni said. "We were beaten by some small college teams (like Gus­tavus Adolphus) and really got belted by Wisconsin (of the WCHA) that year. Last year, we hi;lndled the smaller teams but were still losing to clubs such as Boston College and Wisconsin. This season, we've beaten both BC and Wisconsin and have held our own with everyone we've played against." 
The Irish have a 9-11-1 record t'ws far and stand a good chance 
of  finishing  with  a  better  
than .5 00 per centage  -the goal  
that  Coach  Smith  hoped  to  

attain at the outset of the sea­son. 
''We've improved tremen­dously this year," Tomasoni said when asked how he thought the season had gone so far. "We've made mistakes and sometimes we're not very consistent but it's been a good season." 
"Some of our inconsistency is related to emotion. The teams are so even in the WCHA that mental attitude plays an im­portant part in the outcome of 


Voices from the Crowd 
Dear Sir: 
I have been exposed to an ever-growing undercurrent of complete dissatisfaction with coach Johnny Dee on the part of many Irish basketball fans and I feel it should be brought out in the open. 
I believe that Notre Dame possesses the talent to be the best team in the nation and that it has submitted am!)le evidence of that fact. That it is not, is due principally to the presence of Mr. Dee as head coach. To an educated observer, Mr. Dee's de­ficiencies as a coach became painfully obvious in the Illinois game. A simple move, such as switching the positions of Colis Jones and John P!eik, would have won the game for us. It is generally conceeded that the Irish are a running team; yet Mr. Dee ordered a stall with over nine minutes remaining while we possessed a precarious three point lead. Why? Enough is enough. 
It will be argued that Mr. Dee is an expert recruiter. This is true, and perhaps he could be retained in that capacity. How­ever, what he has done with his ballplayers during their terms here has amounted to nothing. Any improvement by any player on the tearn over the past three years has been due largely to his own efforts, not to Mr. Dee's. Anyone who has ever been to a practice session will testify to bia, the Irish wouldn't have to that. The team's accomplish­play the roll of a spoiler. ments have been its own and its If the Irish loose two more failures have been due to Mr. games (to Fordham and Villa­Dee.

PHOENIX -One of the great lacks in American society today, some psycho\ )gists tell us, is the absence of a true titled class, an aristocracy, authentic living folk heroes. 
Even primitive cultures have their great chiefs and a hegemony of the warrior class. The ancients had mythology and gods and goddesses aplenty -in statuary if not actuality. 
America has had flamboyant military leaders, but every schoolboy now knows wars are won by bulldozers not bullets, factories not fighters. 
Mere money once created a glamor cast for awhile and the peasantry would line up outside the opera house for a glimpse of the plutocrats and their tiara-ed dowager wives, but this palled when even labor leaders achieved equal status. 
The movies filled the void for a time and the goings and comings of these gods and goddesses occasioned police lines outside premieres and mob scenes at small-town hotels whenever they showed up, but when realism came along, the public looked the other way. There were enough antiheroes in the neighborhood without paying a dollar-eighty to see one on the screen. 
It is the sportsman who is American royalty today. Dave Meggysey to the contrary notwithstanding, you got to be a football hero --or a baseball one, or golf, boxing or basketball, to get along with the American public. 
Which is what prompted American Airlines' marketing vice president, F. Jack Mullins, to come up his unique Astrojet golf tournament here at Litchfield Park. He well realized the public wants to see Willie Mays someplace besides center field or the batter's box. They want to see Deacon Jones wearing something besides No. 75 or a quarterback. They want to see Merlin Olsen, who has to be tripli-teamed on a gridiron, helpless before a little ball an inch and a half in diameter. 
Other airlines, notably United and National, sponsor tournaments for real PGA golfers at greater expense. But Mullins knows the public appetite to know "What is Mickey Mantle REALLY like?" Or that its curiosity to know if Henry Aaron could hit a ball that wasn't coming at him 90 m.p h. and curving would pique, and that the sight of Johnny Bench standing in a puddle of water trying to salvage par would bring photographers on the double and decorate sports pages all over the country. 
He also knew the airlines' best customers, corporation presidents, would fly in for the opportunity to trade strokes with reigning athletic heroes. There are 64 corporate executives and 68 baseball and football players -and not a second-stringer among them ­abroad on the fairways daily. 
American Airlines pays the athletes a flat fee expense money, then posts $10,000, and arranges lavish gifts, all with the airline's logo prominently stamped. 
A player hung up on golf as a recreation may elect to waive the prize money since ·acceptance stamps him as a pro, disqualifies him from_ the p_ro-ams like the Crosby and the Hope and, technically, requires him to play at scratch even at his home course. Twenty-sev_en is the maximum allowable handicap at the Astrojet, and Bob G1bson showed up one year with a record of never having had a golf club in his hands. He shot a creditable 118. 
Occasionally, a grown-up athlete may revert to his college frat house days under the pressure of camaraderie and/or beer, and bogey the 19th hole and begin to pull the furniture down or the ­chandeliers apart. He is never invited back. But the airline will say only that, in the five years of the tournament, there have been "less than five" such instances. Which would be a fair record for a church picnic. 
It is said the Crosby must pick its field from I 0,000 applicants. But Mullins has a starting list of 1 ,500 baseball and football players 
.. 

who, almost to a man, even lobby for invites. Crowds far outdrew the satellite tournament at Ontario over the weekend, and the crowds are so rarely golf fans they walk up on the green while the athletes are lining up putts to ask for autographs. 
Is it worth it? Says Mullins, a student of America's royalty: "If these guys were suited up and playing their own game, it would cost me more for a one-minute commercial on Monday night."  
very important in hockey to get to know where your linemates are going to be and this has been a factor that has hurt our play at times. Against Denver, though, we played our best game of the year. Everyone played well." 
Tomasoni's style of play is not really picture-book and this fact was mentioned, with a smile, by Coach Lefty Smith. 
"Dick can drive a coach crazy. 
He does things wrong; he doesn't like to warm up and he doesn't like practice. But he does what counts, he stops the puck." 
That he does, coach, that he does.

VP appointment viewed 
by John Gallagly The appointment of vice­president to oversee and co­ordinate the present Law, Busi­ness Administration and Graduate Schools is, in the eyes of William Lorimer, Graduate Student Union President, a cru­cial step in the further develop­ment of Notre Dame's post­
graduate schools. 
It will be the first time that these are directly represented in the administration of Notre Dam'e as a whole. Just as im­portant in determining the direc­tion in which these departments 
travel,  however,  is  the  man  
whom  the  Trustee  sub­

Lorimer sees the University in 
a position to support its gradu­
ate departments by picking a 
dynamic leader, one who will 
"lead us from our present 
mediocrity." The financial sup­
port that the new Vice President 
receives from the University for 
any programs he might institute 
will indicate how deeply the 
University is willing to commit 
itself to renovation. 
The GSU President also ex­
pressed the view that the new 
vice-president should come from 
outside the present University 
structure to, in his words, "bring 
in some new blood." 
His personal choice for vice­
president are either Fredson 
Bowers, chairman of English at 
the University of Virginia, or 
William Arrowsmith, distin­
guished classicist who spoke at 
Notre Dame last semester. Both 
men have proven themselves 
scholastic, administrative and 
what is more important in Lori~ 
mer's mind, dynamic leaders. 
Lorimer expressed concern at not having a voting member of the graduate students on the Search Committee, which closes for applications on February 28. The Graduate Student Council passed a formal resolution to move that the Academic Council appoint two voting graduate stu­dents to the committee, but the motion was not brought up by Gather Breachner, the Graduate associate dean. 
Lorimer, however, empha­
sized that there had been a 
Graduate consultant appointed 
to the committee in the person 
of Miss Marie McGuire, an elec­
trical engineer. 
Lorimer summed up his feel­ings on the subject with these words: "It is time for the Uni­versity to make good its claim of supporting Graduate level educa­.tion. The decision to appoint a vice-president, and the coming selection of a man for the post could be the most important things to happen to Notre Dame's graduate school in the
