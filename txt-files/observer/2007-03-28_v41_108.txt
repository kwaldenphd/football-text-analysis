Editor's Note: This is the first article in a three-part series examining activism at Notre Dame: its current role on campus, how that role has. changed and what those changes mean for the future. 
With the war in Iraq poten­tially stretching on longer than the one in Vietnam over 30 years ago, last week's fourth anniversary of the United States' invasion shone a spotlight on college cam­puses -once the sites of passionate anti-war activism. 
At Notre Dame, the only protest that took place last week was organized by mem­hers of the Catholic Worker movement -a group from outside the University. While students were involved, the lack of major student organi­zation for the event seemed to reinforce the stereotype that Notre Dame lacks activism. 
To many, the question remains whether or not Notre Dame students are making their voices heard when it comes to human rights, the war in Iraq, the genocide in Darfur and other pressing concerns of today's genera­tion of college students. 
But to some students like junior Stuart Mora, a mem­ber of Campus Labor Action Project (CLAP) who is also active with the South Bend Center for the Homeless, loud arrest-focused protests are

When junior Molly Rivard was six years old, she was diagnosed with dyspraxia, a motor skills disability that can make movements and ges­tures associated with coordination -such as writing -difficult. 
"Yes, I do have a disability," said Rivard, a history and Irish studies major who hopes to continue her education after graduating from Notre Dame. "But that does not make me different. I just have to do things differently."

Students report two sexual assault cri111es 
Incidents affect ND and SMC campuses 
By KATIE KOHLER Sainr Mary's Ediror 
Police are investigating two separate incidents of reported sex offenses -one involving a Notre Dame stu­dent and the other involving a Saint Mary's student. 
The incidents, a fondling sex offense and sexual assault, both were reported Sunday night to Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP). 
In the case of the sexual assault, a Notre Dame stu­dent reported an acquain­tance committed the crime, according to an e-mail to students Monday. The e-mail said the assault occurred on campus Saturday. 
The Observer was not able to reach NDSP officials Tuesday. 
In the second case, a Saint Mary's student notified NDSP at 8:15 p.m. Sunday after a man approached her and a friend at State Road 933 en route to the Grotto. The man, who was on roller blades, inappropriately touched the student, who was not injured, as he passed by, the e-mail said.

Kelley part of attorney removals 
ND law professor serves as deputy to White House counsel 
By MADDIE HANNA News Writer 
As controversy continues to brew around Attorney General Alberto Gonzales' handling of the recent U.S. attorney firings, a Notre Dame 
law professor has quietly found his way to the center of the investi­gation. 
"Late in the afternoon on Dec. 4, a 


deputy to Kelley Harriet E. Miers, then the White House counsel and one of President Bush's most trusted aides, sent a two-line e-mail message to a top Justice Department aide," begins a March 14 article in The New York Times. '"We're a go,' it said, approving a long­brewing plan to remove seven federal prosecutors considered weak or not team players." 
That deputy is William K. Kelley, who left the Law School in the spring of 2005 to take a presidential appointment. Since then, he has served as White House deputy counsel in what Notre Dame law professor Richard Garnett called "a posi­tion of great responsibility." 
"We're good friends," Garnett, who is at the University of Chicago this semester as a visit­ing professor, said Tuesday. "He

After a nearly two-year-long legal battle, The Copy Shop in LaFortune will permanently close its doors Friday, marking the end of 18 years of operations. 
"This letter is one that I never anticipated having to write,'' Tim Wright, president of Copy Wright, Inc. and owner of The Copy Shop in LaFortune, wrote in a letter available to any visitor to the LaFortune shop. 
The letter, dated Monday, details the reasons for the business' clos­ing -namely the cost of the law­suit between The Copy Shop and the University.

Love is in the air 

Before I arrived at Notre Dame, I thought nothing would excite me more than passing by Brady Quinn on campus or doing the jig at a home football game. Then again, I had never experi­enced winter in Eva Binda Northern Indiana before (schools

chance of snow in Washington DC). Therefore, seeing the sun again and experiencing temperatures above 60 degrees could not have been more exciting or welcome this week. 
I noticed how campus suddenly came to life. Students were playing lacrosse, frisbee and even bad­minton out on North Quad. Grills were broken out by a couple of dorms. Music was blasting from dorm room windows. A couple of female students got very excited and even broke out the bikini tops for some sunbathing. 
One of my friends remarked that campus really felt like college now with the large number of students hanging around outside, instead of hiding in their dorm rooms to keep warm. It looked like the pictures you see in the brochures sent to prospective student. 
Another thing I've noticed in addi­tion to the quick transition into shorts and skirts is the romance. Sure, there are those slightly awk­ward SDH dates and completely awkward good-byes outside girls' dorms at parietals all year-round, but suddenly, it seems people are just more affectionate. 
Walking around campus today, I couldn't help noticing the rise in couples holding hands on the way to class or sitting on benches showing PDA. I mean it's not quite "The Notebook" or anything, but it's still kind of sweet. Everyone just looks a little happier. 
I've even noticed this new phe­nomenon among people I know ... the person who never admits to lik­ing anyone, suddenly blushing and participating in PDA with someone. Or, on the other end of the spec­trum, the person who goes through potential love interests like profile pictures on Facebook, actually talk­ing about having found that special someone and maybe, just maybe, settling down soon. It's all quite amusing and it's okay to make a lit­tle fun of them, but at the same time, it's also kind of sweet and makes me smile. 
Whatever the case or wherever you fall between the two, I've come to believe that there's more in the air than just warmth. There might be some love in the air. 
And so, Notre Dame, forget (just for a moment or you may fail out) about trying to solve integrals that seem impossible, writing papers that you don't feel like writing and reading course packets and chap­ters that never seem to end. In the words of the Beatles, "Nothing you can do but learn how to be in time. It's easy. All you need is love."

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Appointees approved for leadership roles 
BySONIARAO 
News Writer 
· Several student government appointees were approved for the 2007-08 term during the final meeting of 2006-07 Council of Representatives (COlO members Tuesday. 
Michelle Byrne, Phil Boss, Ashley Weiss, Christopher Tillett. Eva Binda, Sheena Plamoottil, Michelle Zaldana and Emily Cooperstein wnre all approved to assume lead­ership roles of various student government organizations that arn represented within COH. Each was prnsented to COH members along with a letter of rncommendation. 
.Junior class president-elect Bob Reish presented Michelle Byrne as the class of 2009 sec­rntary. Byrne tahs the posi­tion, which is one of four posi­tions on the class voting ticket, as secretary-elect Callie Pogge "will be unable to fulfill her duties becausn of other inter­ests within Notrn Dame stu­dent government," Reish said. 
Rnish said Byrnn is "quali­11nd, dedicated and hardwork­ing," and he noted she has had various leadership roles ineluding those as Cavanaugh's IIall representa­tive, spiritual committee chair and Cavanaugh Hall president. 
Current Student Union 
Board (SUB) manager Patrick 
Vassel presented junior Phil Ross as his nominee to contin­ue leading SUB next year. 
"Phil is far and away t,he best candidate for the posi­tion," Vassel wrote in his let­ter of recommendation. "He has demonstrated tremendous time-management skills as well as innovative creativity and constant professionalism. His past leadership experi­ences exemplify the combina­tion of hard work and fun that are central to the mission of SUB." 
Current Judicial Council president Liz Kozlow nominat­ed junior Ashley Weiss as her successor. 
"Over the past year, she showed enthusiasm and dedi­cation for Student Government by working as the Chair of the Student Senate Committee on Gender Issues where she over­saw and coordinated both the Eating Disorders Conference and Sexual Assault Awareness week," Kozlow wrote. 
Kozlow also noted that Weiss ran for the elected position of student body vice president earlier in the year, which would serve as valuable back­ground. 
Kadcja Gaines, chairwoman of the Financial Management Board, announced her nomi­nation of freshmen Christopher Tillet and Eva Binda to the Assistant Student Union Treasurer positions. 

Gaines said she interviewed eight people for the position and Tillet and Binda were the most qualified. 
Binda is a news writer for The Observer. 
Student body president-elect Liz Brown pn~sented her nom­inations of Sheena Plamoottil, Michelle Zaldana and Emily Cooperstein as next year's chief executive assistant, stu­dent body secretary and aca­demic delegate, respectively. 
All three have extensive background in student govern­ment and have excelled in 
leadership positions, Brown said.

Activis01

not the only effective ways to 
show activism. 
For Mora, student partici­pation in "concrete things" ­such as service projects at home and abroad through the Center for Social Concerns· and the high number of hours Notre Dame students spend volunteering -is proof that activism is "still here [on campus] and maybe stronger than ever" in a dif­ferent form. 
"I think activism has changed," he said. "I don't think we have the marching around with placards any­more ... I think people are looking to do more concrete things." 
But just before spring break, it was that "marching around" activism that was seen on Notre Dame's cam­pus. 
Soulforce, a national gay rights group, stopped at Notre Dame as part of its cross-country Equality Ride, a 32-stop bus tour intended to protest the intolerance of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people that it believes occurs at Christian colleges. 
After University administra­tors denied the group's request to visit in the fall, cit­ing a policy that reserves such demonstrations for members of the campus com­munity, Soulforce members notified Notre Dame that they would nonetheless arrive March 8 -and they did. 
The 25 riders marched into LaFortune and were soon met with Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) offi­cers who, when Soulforce members refused to cease and desist, issued trespass notices to six group members for restricting foot traffic, speaking in loud voices and interfering and disrupting normal business activity. Trespass notices, said Assistant Vice President of News and Information Dennis Brown, carry with them a request never to return to campus, 
The next morning, March 9, six group members attempted to walk down Notre Dame Avenue with a wreath, intending to deliver it to the statue of Tom Dooley, a gay military hero and Notre Dame graduate. Near the vicinity of the old post office, the mem­bers were again stopped by NDSP and this time issued arrest citations, with a likely request to appear in court. Brown said policemen then gave the group a ride back to their bus. 
"We checked with other universities where Soulforce had conducted its activities. We're aware of what [the group's] objectives are," Brown said. "Now they're able to publicize that they were arrested at Notre Dame, which is sort of their goal." 
Soulforce -which counts many college students among its members -has continued to face resistance and arrest at subsequent stops on its Equality Ride. A handful of Notre Dame students took part in the Soulforce event, but many campus activist groups seem to favor talking, if not yelling, about their causes -and many are lis­tening. 
CLAP has staged protests and written reports in sup­

port of a "living wage" of $12.10 an hour for every employee at Notre Dame. 
The Progressive Student Alliance (PSA)'s "Week of Action" brought Liam Madden, an honorably dis­charged marine and leader in the anti-war movement, to DeBartolo Hall -and 170 people flocked to hear him. Another of the week's events, a talk on the correlation between biology and homo­sexuality, drew a standing­room only crowd. 
Sophomore Michael Angulo, vice president of the PSA, said he received good feed­back from students and facul­ty regarding the "Eyes Wide Open" exhibit displayed on South Quad to raise aware­ness about the Iraq War. 
The display was brought to campus by the PSA through the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), which organized the traveling exhibit and supplied the pub­lic display of boots honoring each U.S. military casualty. The exhibit featured a field of shoes, a multimedia display exploring the "history, cost and consequences of the war" and a Wall of Remembrance to memorialize the Iraqi citi­zens killed in conflict, accord­ing to the AFSC Web site. 
"It's really important to have an attitude of reaching out," senior Katie Rose Hoover said of promoting awareness and education about issues on campus. "Rather than being exclusive to people who share the same ideas, values and mindset." 
Hoover, an active member of the Notre Dame Peace Fellowship, Amnesty International and CLAP, said that such groups are making an impact. She also said cam­pus activists have changed her own attitudes about many issues. 
While Notre Dame has his­torically been identified as a campus lacking activism, jun­ior Katie McHugh -a mem­ber of both PSA and CLAP ­thinks the University is underrated in terms of activism. 
"We have many politically­minded people on this cam­pus, as political science is the most popular major in Arts and Letters, as well as a peace studies program that may be the most well­respected in the nation," she said, adding that Notre Dame has one of the best collegiate social concerns centers. "There is a deep-seeded obli­gation [among Notre Dame students] to help those in need around the world and in the South Bend community." 
Still, that obligation doesn't inhabit a large portion of Notre Dame students. 
Angulo said he thinks Notre Dame students are not neces­sarily apathetic, but that oftentimes they "don't have a forum" to express their con­cerns and discuss issues of social justice in constructive ways. 
The bureaucracy of Notre Dame and the University's history of not being an activist campus, he said, are two big hurdles for students involved in efforts such as the ones the PSA advances. McHugh said she questioned whether "the real problem isn't apathy, but bodies of administrators that silence the beginnings of discussion or controversy on campus." 
Both PSA and CLAP some­times feel "hushed" by Student Activities, which takes measures to prevent 
controversy, she said.

Rice pushes Israeli-Palestinian talks 
JERUSALEM -The Israeli and Palestinian leaders will meet every two weeks for discus­sions aimed at paving the way for a final set­tlement to the Middle East conflict, officials said Tuesday, a small sign of momentum for the latest U.S. push to restart peace efforts. 
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced the planned meetings at the end of a swing through the region, her fourth in as many months. Although the talks will begin with day-to-day issues, they signaled a deeper U.S. commitment to bringing the sides together after a six-year lull in peace efforts. 
"The Israelis and Palestinians are taking the initial step on the path to peace, and the American role will include helping them to overcome obstacles, develop new ideas and rally international support for their efforts," she said. 
Italian troops to stay in Afghanistan 
ROME -Premier Homano Prodi's govern­ment won a Senate vote Tuesday to keep Italy's troops in Afghanistan, despite increas­ing concerns over the worsening security sit­uation in the country. 
The 180-2 vote -with 132 abstentions, which in the Senate count as "no" votes ­gave final approval to a government decree that provides funding for all Italian missions abroad. The lower house of parliament approved it earlier this month. 
Italy has about 2,000 troops in Afghanistan, deployed between Kabul and Herat, far from the more restive south of the country. But a series of small incidents involving the Italians and heavy fighting elsewhere in the country are heightening concerns in Italy over the troops security.

ABOARD THE USS JOHN C. STENNIS ­American warplanes screamed off two aircraft carriers Tuesday as the U.S. Navy staged its largest show of force in the Persian Gulf since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, launching a mammoth exercise meant as a message to the Iranians. 
The maneuvers with 15 warships and more than 100 aircraft were sure to heighten tensions with Iran, which has frequently condemned the U.S. military presence off its coast and is in a faceoff with the West over its nuclear program and-its capture of a British naval team.

"There was never anything out of the ordinary. There was never an issue of the two planes getting too close. There was never an issue of it being a near miss. It was just some regular, normal procedures," she said.

Senate sets Iraq withdrawal timeline 
Democrats' plan draws ire ofCongressional Republicans, White House, Lieberman 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Defying a veto threat, the Democratic-controlled Senate narrowly signaled support Tuesday for the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq by next March. 
Republican attempts to scuttle the non-binding timeline failed on a vote of 50-48, largely along party lines. The roll call marked the Senate's most forceful challenge to date of the administration's handling of a war that has claimed the lives of more than 3,200 
U.S. troops. 
Three months after Democrats took power in Congress, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the moment was at band to "send a message to President Bush that the time has come to find a new way forward in this intractable war." 
But Hepublicans -and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, an independent Democrat ­argued otherwise. 
John McCain, R-Ariz., a presidential hopeful, said that "we are starting to turn things around" in the Iraq war and that a timeline for withdrawal would embold­en the terrorists in Iraq and elsewhere. 
The effect of the timeline would be to "snatch defeat from the jaws of progress in Iraq," agreed Lieberman, who won a new term last fall in a three-way race after losing the Democratic nomination to an anti-war insurgent. 
Bush had previously said he would veto any bill con­taining the timeline, and the White House freshened the threat a few hours before the vote on Tuesday. "This and other provisions would place freedom and democ­racy in Iraq at grave risk, embolden our enemies and undercut the administra­tion's plan to develop the Iraqi economy," it said in a statement. 
Similar legislation drew only 48 votes in the Senate earlier this month, but Democratic leaders made a change that persuaded Nebraska's Democratic Sen. Ben Nelson to swing behind the measure. 


Additionally, Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a vocal critic of the war, sided with the Democrats, assuring them of the majority they needed to turn back a chal­lenge led by Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss. 
The debate came on legis­lation that provides $122 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as domestic priorities such relief to hurricane vic­tims and payments to farm­ers. 
Separately, supporters of an increase in the minimum wage readied an effort to attach the measure to the spending bill, along with companion tax cuts that Republicans have demand­ed. The House and Senate have passed different ver­sions of the bill but have yet to reach a compromise. 
The House has already passed legislation requiring troops to be withdrawn by Sept. 1, 2008. The Senate vote assured that the Dem ocr a tic-controlled Congress would send Bush legislation later this spring that calls for a change in war policy. A veto is a cer­tainty, presuming the presi­dent follows through. 
That would put the onus back on the Democrats, who would have to decide how long they wanted to extend the test of wills in the face of what are likely to be increasingly urgent statements from the admin­istration that the money is needed for troops in the war zone. 
"Frankly, I think we'd like to reach out to the president . . . and say, 'Mr. President, this is not a unilateral gov­ernment. It is a separation of powers, and the Congress of the United States is assuming review,"' House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland told reporters as the Senate debated the war. 

Reid also referred to the president at a news confer­ence. "I would hope that he would be willing to work with us in coming up with some language that both (houses of Congress) could accept. At this stage, he has been very non-negotiable. So we'll see what happens," he said. 
As drafted, the legislation called for troop withdrawal to begin within 120 days, with a non-binding goal that calls for the combat troops to be gone within a year. 

Americans die in Green Zone attack 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD -Two truck bombs shat­tered markets in Tal Afar on Tuesday, killing at least 63 people and wounding dozens in the second assault in four days on a predominantly Shiite Muslim city hit by a resurgence in violence a year after it was held up as a symbol of 
U.S. success. 
After the bombings, suspected Sunni insurgents tried to ambush ambulances carrying the injured out of the north­western city but were driven off by police gunfire, Iraqi authorities said. 
The carnage was the worst bloodshed in a day that saw attacks across Iraq. 
A major Sunni Arab insurgent group reported its military leader was slain outside Baghdad, an assault likely to deepen an increasingly bloody rift between al-Qaida in Iraq and opponents of the terror group in Sunni communi­ties west of the capital. 
In Baghdad, a U.S. soldier and an American working as a U.S. govern­ment contractor were killed by a rocket attack on the heavily guarded Green Zone, U.S. officials said. Another con­tract worker suffered serious wounds and three were slightly wounded. A sol­dier also was wounded. 
The last known U.S. death in the Green Zone, site of the U.S. Embassy and Iraqi government and parliamen­tary headquarters, was in February when an American contractor was killed in a checkpoint shooting in the Green Zone. 
It was the second rocket attack on the zone in less than a week. A Katyusha rocket exploded just 50 yards from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as he spoke with reporters there Thursday during an unannounced visit to the city. 
U.S. soldiers, meanwhile, foiled two suicide truck bombers trying to attack their base in a small town 50 miles west of Baghdad and killed as many as 15 attackers, the military said. It said eight soldiers suffered wounds, all but one of them slight, during the firefight in Karmah.

a problem with the neural com­munication between her brain and motor muscles -something that her mother noticed when Rivard had trouble crawling as a baby -that leads to difficulty writing. 
But Rivard is not left alone at the University to deal with her disability. She is one of the more than 200 students who receive services at the Office of Disability Services. 
Approximately 140 of the 200­plus students are learning dis­abled or suffer from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Coordinator of Disability Services Scott Howland said. 
Saint Mary's Disabilities Specialist Iris Giamo said the Disabilities Resource Office at the college serves approximately 75 students both for learning disabil­ities and for ADHD. 
Students come to the College and University with an array of learning disabilities, including dyslexia and other disorders, Howland said. 
"It's a variety," Howland said. 

students with dyslexia -there are some [disabilities] that are more related to spatial issues." 
Howland said the disabilities primarily involve the time it takes to process information. 
"It might take [students] longer than their peers to complete their homework, or get their reading assignments done," he said. "That's always a challenge, bal­ancing that ... with everything else that's going on." 
But those are the issues associ­ated with just studying, he said. 
"In the classroom, probably the biggest challenge they have relates to exams," Howland said. "We have a lot of students that do need accommodations." 
When she applied to Notre Dame, Rivard included a note about her disability. 
"I did notify them in that section [of the undergraduate applica­tion], 'If there's anything else you'd like to tell us,' that I [was diagnosed with a disability]," Rivard said. 
And though Rivard is not alone in acknowledging a physical or learning disability, the number is low, hovering at about one per­cent of the applicant pool, Senior 
That percent constituted 206 of more than 12,000 applicants dur­ing the 2005 to 2006 admission year, Fisher said. 
Fisher, who also serves as the liaison between the Office of Disability Services and the admis~ sions office, said there has been a slight increase year-to-year of stu­dents who apply and disclose they have a learning disability, as more people feel comfortable doing so. 
"If they want to tell us, we encourage that," Fisher said. "The more information we have about your academic perform­ance, the better we can under­stand if you struggled with some grades." 
Fisher said that while the University does not discriminate on basis of disability, it will take such a disclosure into account when reading an application. 
When looking at a student's record "from the point from when [the disability] was discovered to getting some help," a visible improvement in the student's per­formance is often seen, she said. 
Since being admitted, Rivard has utilized functions the Disabilities Services office offers including having a note taker and nate location. 
"For me, it's about becoming ·more independent. I have to be an advocate for myself," Rivard said. "I have to go to my teachers to ask for accommodations, and I have to let Scott [Howland] know ifl need a note taker." 
Howland said most of the stu­

dents with learning disabilities he 
serves utilize test-taking accom­
modations and note taking servic­
es/classroom assistance. 
In addition to providing services 

similar to those of Howland's 
office, Saint Mary's offers services 
including instruction on study 
skills and technical skills tailored 
to needs of the learning disabled, 
Giamo said. 
In the 11 years Howland has 

been at Notre Dame, only "a few" 
students have not graduated as a 
result of a learning disability and 
other related issues, he said. 
Giamo said that in her two and 

a half years at Saint Mary's, she 
hasn't seen any students drop out 
-and has seen plenty succeed. 
"I think with a lot of support 

from professors, administrators, 
this office and their parents, they 
are successful," Giamo said. 
'They have to be extremely hard­
rience at Notre Dame has been relatively normal and successful, given her disability. The environ­ment -especially with profes­sors, she said -is typically an understanding one. 
But Rivard said there is one response she often receives from friends and peers when she tells them she has a disability. 
"They say,-'But you're so smart,"' Rivard said. 
Such a comment, she said, can be disappointing since her disabil­ity has nothing to do with intelli­gence. 
"Lots of people who have dis­abilities have been very smart," she said. 
Giamo agreed that there is a stigma associated with learning disabilities -which leads some to feel "a little embarrassed" or "inferior" -even though intelli­gence is not related. 
Still, Giamo said she feels there is a "growing awareness" of the issue and credits events like Tuesday's keynote address for providing a more personal look at learning disabilities.

the litigation, the costs of the process have drained the com­pany's cash flow to "the point where the business can no longer support itself," the letter said. 
University spokesman Don Wycliff said the University could not comment because the case "is in litigation." 

The dispute between Wright and the University revolves around the "option to renew" clause in the lease for The Copy Shop's space. 
Originally added to the store's lease in 1989 by former owner Dan Foley, the option gives the owner an explicit option to renew the lease until the owner decides he or she does not want the space anymore or until a rule of the lease is violated, Wright said in a Nov. 21, 2005 article in The Observer. 
But in early 2005, Wright was notified that the University "did not accept our offer to renew." 
"I sent them a letter and I said this was not an offer. It was the exercise of an option. That's the basic dispute that the University was involved in with us when they filed their com­plaint," he said at the time. "They said it was an offer, we said it wasn't." 
In August 2005, the University filed a suit in the St. Joseph Circuit Court in Mishawaka against Copy Services Inc. ask­ing the court for immediate pos­session of the property in the basement of the student center. Copy Services Inc. operates under the name The Copy Shop. 
The issue was brought to the Indiana Court of Appeals, which ruled against the Copy Shop. 
"We are in the process of moving the dispute to the next level, the Indiana Supreme Court," Wright said in the letter. 
Wright has operated The Copy Shop, an independent business not affiliated with the University, since 2001. 
In his letter, Wright said that the University intends to "termi­nate our campus lease and, in effect, sell our business to Kinko's."

IN BRIEF 
Atlantic City card dealers form union 
ATLANTIC CITY -The parent company of Caesars Atlantic City has decided not to chal­lenge a vote by workers to form a union, granti­ng casino dealers in Atlantic City their first union in 25 years. 
The deadline for Harrah's Entertainment Inc. to challenge the March 17 unionization vote was Monday, according to the company and the United Auto Workers, which is representing nearly 900 Caesars dealers, keno and simulcast employees. 
The workers voted 572 to 128 to become part of the UAW. 
The union said it was notified by the National Labor Relations Board on Tuesday that the board had certified the results of the election, clearing the way for collective bargaining at Caesars. 
"This is another important step in winning a strong voice for casino workers in Atlantic City," said Elizabeth Bunn, the .union's national secretary-treasurer. "We're proud to assist workers at Caesars, Trump and all Atlantic City casinos in this historic citywide organizing effort." 
Caesars workers will elect a bargaining com­mittee in the next several weeks. · 

Stocks fall as pessimistic data released 
NEW YORK -Stocks stumbled Tuesday as investors grew wary when new data raised the possibility that the nation's weak housing mar­ket would seep into the broader economy and crimp consumer spending. 
A housing index released Tuesday by Standard & Poor's showed that prices of single­family U.S. homes fell in January compared to a year ago, in their worst showing since January 2004. Also, Lennar Corp., one of the nation's largest homebuilders, said its first-quarter profit plummeted 73 percent and warned that it prob­ably won't meet its 2007 earnings guidance. 
Wall Street has been nervous lately that a drop in housing values will further weaken sub­prime mortgage lenders, who make loans to people with poor credit, and make consumers feel less wealthy and rein in spending. Consumer spending makes up about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
The Conference Board said Tuesday that its March consumer confidence index fell to 107.2, the lowest level since November and a

Associated Press  
NEW YORK  
Consumers sent up a warn­ 
ing signal in March that  
rising gas prices, falling  
home values and a volatile  
stock market could hurt  
spending in the coming  
months, a widely watched  
index showed on Tuesday.  
The New York-based  
Conference Board said that  
its Consumer Confidence  
Index fell to 107.2, down  
from the revised 111.2 in  
February. Analysts had  
expected a reading of 109.  
The March index was the  
lowest since November  
2006 when the reading  
was 105._3.

has not, as you can imagine, said a word to me about this stuff." 
This "stuff' is the escalating Congressional investigation of Gonzales, who is accused of covering up his role in last year's dismissal of eight U.S. attorneys. Criminal charges haven't come into play, since "the U.S. attorneys are appoint­ed by the president. They serve at the will of the president," Notre Dame law professor Jay Tidmarsh said Tuesday. 
That means "it's not a mys­tery" that when a president comes into power, he replaces the attorneys as he chooses, Tidmarsh said -it's legal, and expected. But while political considerations may play into the initial appointments, the recent firings have raised ques­tions. 
"There's potential taint involved in someone replaced for political, rather than per­formance considerations," said Tidmarsh, who explained that Gonzales' denial of involvement in the situation has generated concern. "This is always true: It's the cover-up, not the actions, that get someone in trouble." 
Last week, a House Judiciary subcommittee authorized sub­poenas for several Bush aides, including White House political adviser Karl Rove, Miers and Kelley. Tidmarsh said his under­standing was that the subpoena was issued, but not yet served. Bush has denied Congressional requests for formal testimony from the aides. 
Garnett said he could not ana­lyze the situation or Kelley's chances of being called to testi­fy, because he did not want any­one to mistakenly believe Kelley had spoken to him about the investigation. 
Kelley's executive assistant in the White House counsel's office did not return Observer phone calls Tuesday. 
While Kelley's role in the con­troversy is still hazy -. "Years as a lawyer lead me to be very skeptical of one e-mail," Tidmarsh said -that may be due partly to the nature of his job. 
"The counsel's office in the White House has a really broad portfolio," Garnett said. "They're not the personal lawyers for people in the White House." 
Instead, the counsel advises the president on a wide range of legal issues. The deputy coun­sel's job entails "advising the Counsel and the President on decisions to sign or veto legisla­tion, ethical and conflicts ques­tions, executive appointments and judicial selection, Presidential pardons, and law­suits against the President in his official capacity," according to the fall 2005 issue of Notre Dame Lawyer magazine. 
''I'm sure there are a thou­sand things that pass across Professor Kelley's desk on a 
of a Congressional investigation, both Tidmarsh and Garnett said there were clear reasons ­besides prestige -that a law professor would take this job. 
"It is certainly an important position in government -l think many lawyers feel a call to public service," Tidmarsh said. "For Professor Kelley, I think that certainly is true." 
Garnett said Kelley was "hon­ored and pleased" to take the job, given the importance of the appointment. 
Kelley, a tenured member of the Notre Dame faculty who has been at the University since 1995, clerked from 1987 to 1988 for former federal judge Ken Starr on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The next year, he clerked for Chief Justice Warren 
E. Burger and Associate Justice Antonin Scalia. 
From 1991 to 1994, he served as assistant to the solicitor gen­
eral  at  the  Department  of  
Justice in Washington, D.C.  
Kelley's  appointment  to  

deputy counsel "was kind of natural," Garnett said. "It prob­ably wasn't all that surprising. ... He would have been on everybody's list." 
Kelley is the second Notre Dame law professor to serve in President George W. Bush's administration. Professor Jimmy Gurule worked as the Treasury Departm·(mt's under­secretary for enforcement from 2001 to 2003. 
Those kind of appointments, said Associate Vice President for News and Information Don Wyclifl', make professors "more valuable faculty members." And that's why the University was willing to grant Kelley a leave. 
"In cases where a faculty member is invited to do some­thing special that adds to his or her credentials ... essentially what they can do is go to their dean and request a leave of absence, an unpaid leave, and negotiate the terms," Wycliff said Tuesday. 
When Kelley received the appointment, "his first concern was fulfilling his obligations to the class he was then teaching," Dean of the Law School Patricia O'Hara said in an e-mail Tuesday. 
"I encouraged him to accept the appointment, and l recom­mended approval of a leave of absence from the University," O'Hara said. "With my permis­sion he made arrangements to complete the course by teaching the class sessions on an acceler­ated calendar." 
O'Hara said the Law School would benefit from Kelley's return. 
"Professor Kelley is an out­standing teacher and scholar in the areas of constitutional law, administrative law and federal courts, as well as a valued col­league," she said. "I am hopeful that he will choose to return to the Law School for the start of the 2007-2008 academic year."

Abeel's mother, Betsy, also spoke about the struggles of raising a child with a learning disability and how to creatively face these challenges. 
Dyscalculia makes under­standing numbers nearly impossible for Abeel, a struggle that has affected both her aca­demic life and her everyday life.

"My sense of time is some­thing that I struggle with," Abeel said. "Often times, I can't tell the difference between ten minutes and an hour." 
Dealing with money, following cooking recipes and keeping score while playing games have also been difficult, Abeel said. 
She explained that she can write the number ten and she can name the number ten, but she has no concept of how much ten is. 
Both Abeel and her mother 
stressed the importance of cre­ativity in developing coping skills for learning disabilities. 
Abeel, who wrote Reach for the Moon at age fifteen and has also published My Thirteenth Winter, said she has always succeeded in English and cre­ative writing courses. 
The gap between her verbal capabilities and her mathemati­cal capabilities made it difficult for elementary school teachers to pinpoint her disability. It was not until she reached sec­ond grade that Samantha was tested for disabilities, but her parents were told not to worry and that her math and verbal ski~}s would eventually "even out . 
However, her learning dis­ability began to take an emo­tional and psychological toll on Abeel. 
"By the time I was in fourth grade, I was extremely with­drawn socially," she said. "I looked like I belonged . . . but I didn't feel like I belonged." 
The transition from elemen­tary school to middle school in seventh grade was even worse. 
"Seventh grade was the worst year of my life," she said, describing how she could no longer rely on the coping skills that she used in elementary school to get through her daily life. Those skills included fol­lowing the rest of her peers to know when to switch classes. 
"I was in a regular algebra class, and I could barely add," she said. 
In eighth grade, Abeel was placed in some special educa­tion classes. 
"Special education changed my life," Abeel said. "It was the best thing that ever happened to me, because for the first time in my life, I could raise my hand and say I didn't get it and nobody else did either." 
It was around this time that Abeel began to realize that her disability was out of her hands. 
"What a relief to know that it wasn't my fault," she said. 
Abeel went on to Mount Holyoke College, but found her­self doing homework constantly and having panic attacks. At that point, Abeel began to see a counselor. 
"It helped me to start a dia­logue with somebody who was not a part of my life," she said. "I was not allowing myself to be learning disabled ... I was expecting myself to reach or attain these perfect goals." 
She now realizes that accept­ance is a continuous, ever evolving project. 
"Acceptance is such a huge part of it, but it's a process too," she said.

I spent my spring break as a partici­pant in the Center for Social Concerns' Washington Seminar. I, like most of you, watched School House Hock in middle school and took government class in high schoo~. I zach even. re';lember a ht-Einterz 
tle b1t ol James Madison's Federalist BulletproofPaper No. 10. But I ideas didn't truly under­stand the American political system, until I spent a week in Washington, D.C. I wish I could convey to you the intrica­cies of our system, but I know my explanation will be far from sufTicient. I can only suggest that you visit our nation's capital. Washington, D.C. should be America's Mecca. Every adult of voting age has an obligation to visit it at least once in their lifetime. Sit in on a hearing, visit your congressman's office or drop in on one of the myriad of pub­lic policy lectures that occur every week. 
Unlike the Muslim who returns from Mecca with a renewed faith and greater devotion to God, I found myself leaving 
D.C. with a sense of despair in the American political system. My idealistic vision of intelligent, well-meaning diplomats was quickly supplanted in my mind by a conglomerate of special­interest groups, lobbyists and politi­cians scrambling for their own piece of the pie. As I traveled around D.C., I began to realize that most people in politics care about one thing -advanc­ing their own personal agendas. or course, they never frame their argu­ment as such. They always state their personal agenda in a way that aligns with the common good. For example, if you ask a certain Senator from 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 
Oklahoma how he can claim to be a small-government conservative when he continuously supports subsidies for the oil and gas industry, he'll reply by stating that strong domestic production is essential for "national security" rea­sons. It has nothing to do with the fact that his constituents benefit immensely from federal subsidies. It's all about national security, a public good. 
Perhaps more appalling than the self­interestedness of politicians was the way they advanced their agenda. I don't think any of the people we met with ever outright lied to us, but a sly dis­honesty permeated from many of the conference rooms. They only told one side of the story, or they cited a non-sci­entific report put out by a biased inter­est group, or they responded with the Potomac Shuffle; that is, talking around a question without ever giving a direct answer. It wasn't sufTicient for everyone to just sell themselves. They also had to shoot down conflicting ideas, hold per­sonal vendettas against opponents and turn what was already menial debate into ad hominem attacks. The fight to obtain influence and politieal stardom makes for great drama. As one of my fellow Seminar participants put it, "Washington is just like Hollywood, except the people are uglier." 
Once I understood how Washington works, the Abram off scandal, the Libby indictment and the Gonzalez hearings didn't seem so anomalous. By the end of the week, I began to wonder why our political system is a haven for such ugli­ness. None of the people we met are inherently bad, and I think many of them probably came to Washington as idealistic, principled persons. But at some point in their careers, they began to sacrifice their principles for self­interest. They wavered to keep their job, to appease their constituents or to secure more funding. Little by little, their integrity eroded away until they are now at the point where they no' longer realize how far they have strayed from their principles. They've begun to believe whole-heartedly in their mission, even if it is based on dis­honesty. 
Don't take my cynicism to mean that everyone in Washington is narrow­minded and self-serving. We had the chance to meet with several nonparti­san groups and a few honest congress­men. Unfortunately, they seemed to be the exception rather than the norm. 
One night we had dinner with a Notre Dame grad who works in the Pentagon. He told us that he had at one time considered the priesthood, until one of his friends convinced him other­wise. "We have enough ethical people in the priesthood," his friend told him. "What we need are ethical people in government." If you get a chance to embark on a Haij to D.C., walk around the Washington Monument seven times and pray for more ethical government leaders. Or at least pray that we may have the good sense to elect them.

Examining Fair Trade on campus 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Protest questioned, reaction praised 
I write to support the University's decision to dis­perse the Catholic Worker protesters on Monday. Their coming to Notre Dame and their accusations are truly troubling to me, and I think should raise questions as to the Catholic Worker movement's appropriate place within the Ch,urch. 
Clearly, the protesters are extraordinarily misled as to the implications the presence of the ROTC at Notre Dame has for our University. It is absurd to presume that simply because an ROTC program exists on our campus that the University also sup­ports any war that the United States enters into. Were it the case that the University officially sup­ported every position of every program on campus, it would have many conflicting views. The Catholic Workers conveniently did not mention the University's strong Peace Studies program, nor did they mention the work the well-funded Kroc Institute does. 
Further, who are they to protest a program at Notre Dame? They have no ties to the University, except for a shared faith, and they are not affected 

Nothing wrong with our 'Reputation' 
Twenty. Eight. Zero. Twenty is the number of dollars I will pay Megan Rybarczyk ("Our reputation: a sober reality," March 
23) to transfer to a different school. Eight is the num­ber of times I vomited over spring break. Zero is the number of times I regret vomiting during spring break. 
Ulysses S. Grant was able to win the Civil War and serve as the 18th President of the United States of America all while being a world renowned booze hound. The most important thing Notre Dame students have to worry about is what time to go to the dinning hall. I think we can handle a little moonshine every now and then without killing ourselves. 
If God did not want us to partake in the miraculous golden goodness that is beer, then Jesus would not have turned gallons of water into wine at Cana. It is a little known fact that most of the apostles started hanging out with Jesus because of His ability to con­jure happiness out of thin air in the form of crunk juice. 
Trying to convince college students not to drink makes less sense than the Church of Scientology. As at all by there being an ROTC program here. The University's policy regarding protests is a sound one -if we were to let every group wishing to protest come to Notre Dame, we would be bombarded by all sides with fringe groups like the Catholic Workers. Such a scenario would produce chaotic results and · severely impact the capacity of our University to function. 
All that said, the protest should never have occurred in the first place. The Catholic Worker movement does good work with the poor and the oppressed in our country, even in South Bend. I think that should be the need that the Catholic Workers fulfill within our Church. I encourage those involved with this movement to continue to do the good work it does in these areas, and to end such needless and unproductive protests.

you may or may not know, the term "townie" is nqt unique to Notre Dame. It has been used by millions of collegians for decades as a way to describe the dis­gruntled local citizens. They are only disgruntled because they see the fun we are having and.arejeal­ous that they cannot partake. Anyone who has visited a friend at a state school can testify to the fact that the party scene at any one of them makes Notre Dame look like a 16th century monastery. If the NCAA decid­ed to make drinking a Division I sport, they would bar Notre Dame from competition on the grounds of lame­ness. It is therefore imperative that everyone takes the exact opposite advice of Rybarczyk's prohibition remi­niscent letter. We must work diligently to rebuild our reputation in the eyes of our fellow undergrads across the nation and attempt to put the "Fighting" back in the Fighting Irish.

'Moses' needs further analysis 
Most students, faculty, and visitors to campus shuffle by the large statue ofMoses near the library without giv­ing much thought to Moses, his story, or what the statue means for Notre Dame and the broader community. Thus, I commend Xavier Lebec for reflecting upon this and sharing his conclusions with us ("'First Down Moses' underlies negative attitudes toward other religions," March 27). Yet, I am not as quick to agree him, because I feel he unfairly analyzes the story of Moses, unduly attacking Judaism and Christianity. 
One must read the book of Exodus as a whole to gain a good understanding ofthe events contained within its chapters. To the modern ear, God's actions may seem rather cruel and unmerciful. Chapters 7-12 recall the ten plagues God sends upon the Egyptians, the last being the death of the first born son of every household. It seems unjust that innocent Egyptian citizens were subjected to these horrendous afflictions simply because Pharaoh would not free the Israelites. Again, in Chapter 14, we read ofhow God drowns the pursuing Egyptian army in the Red Sea, so that the Israelites may escape. Do not these actions seem incongruous with the later command­ment God gives in Chapter 20, "Thou shall not kill?" 
However, closer inspection reveals that these accounts cannot, in fact, be equated with acts of modern day ter­rorist groups. The Israelites were a people unjustly enslaved by the Egyptians, and God, through Moses, commanded them to be freed. After increasingly severe plagues did not persuade the Pharaoh, God urged Moses to lead the Israelites to freedom and aided in their escape. The violence brought upon the Egyptians is root­ed in the stubborn tyrannicism oftheir leader, just as the violence brought upon the Israelites is rooted in their idolatry of a man-made golden calf. 
Likewise, Moses was not squelching another religion when he destroyed the golden calf: he could served that end more effectively by destroying the religious artifacts of the Egyptians. Rather, he was calling his people back to their God, from whom they had strayed. Moses was not a terrorist, nor a wager ofjihad, nor a religious bigot who sought to violently destroy other religions. He was a simple man, with a speech impediment, whom God called to do great things for the Israelites. And, at the very least, he did a good job of signaling a first down.

modities located most­ly in the global south. 
Coffee is the first commodity to receive fair trade labeling. Fair Trade certification stipulates that coffee producers will receive a premium that exceeds market levels. These prices ($1.21 for a pound of arabica coffee, additional15 cents for organic cof­fee, and a social premium of 5 cents) have enabled farmers to remain on their land, improve sanitation and water supply in their homes, build bridges and roads, establish medical clinics and build schools for their children. 
Beyond coffee, other Fair Trade certified commodities include tea, cocoa, banana, rice, sugar, honey, fruits, nuts, juice, vanil­la, olive oil and others. Recently I received an e-mail on Fair Trade sporting goods. The Europeans are further along in the Fair Trade movement, distributing 60% of the global output. In the United Kingdom alone, 2,500 product lines are certified Fair Trade. The U.S. is growing faster at rates of about 40% per year. Fair Trade coffee is served in 80 million U.S. house­holds and available on 400 campuses. 
Fair Trade, despite its good intentions, has critics. These cite over-supply of coffee beans as the cause of low market prices. By artificially raising the price, Fair Trade prevents necessary adjustments and diver­sification into other crops. The higher price would entice other producers, thus exacer­bating the surplus problem. Critics see such price protection as providing little incentive for improvement. Fair Trade may breed dependence of small producers on the charitable instincts of consumers who may be fickle. Others have argued that the stipulated prices are too low to make a big difference. Some critics point out the dis­proportionate positive publicity large cor­porations gain when they make seemingly token commitments. Others caution that the gains to Fair Trade products may not accrue to producers but to retailers who use this as a marker for price-insensitive consumers. Most are concerned that inter­ventions to the free market are inefficient and nonproductive. 
Fair Trade certification is structured for the potential to achieve long-term gains in the form of enhanced competitiveness of producers and environmentally sustainable approaches to agriculture. To qualify, pro­ducers must be small family farms organ­ized into politically independent demo­graphic associations and committed to eco­logical goals. Certified distributors· must buy directly from Fair Trade certified growers at stipulated prices and contract for periods longer than one growing cycle. In addition, the distributors also provide pre-financing equal to 60 percent of the contract value. . 
These arrangements provide funds for cooperatives to invest in better facilities for storage, processing, quality control, trans­portation and so on. Some cooperatives hire technical experts to improve their crops, develop new products, get market information, and provide leadership train­ing. The producers, through more stable and higher cash receipts, gain access to credit and increase their bargaining lever­age with government, development agen­cies and NGOs. Divine Chocolate, distrib­uted by Catholic Relief Services and the first farmer-owned Fair Trade chocolate brand, offers a model of empowerment and a vision of what is possible. The farm­ers from the Kuapa Kokoo cooperative in Ghana supply the cocoa, serve on the board of Divine Chocolate, participate in decision-making and share in the profits of the company. The other focus of Fair Trade is environmental sustainability. Dangerous chemicals listed by the International Standards Organization cannot be used in Fair Trade products. Transfair (a Fair Trade labeling organization) reports that approximately 85 percent ofthe Fair Trade coffee in the U.S. is certified organic. 
With respect to concerns about free mar­ket interventions, Fair Trade is not as dis­connected from current market practices as some have worried. No market is com­pletely "free," as evidenced by the tax credit for the Prius, minimum wage stipu­lations, tariffs on certain imported prod­ucts, subsidies for various commodities, regulations on·product safety, environmen­tal standards, ingredients that are banned, employee benefits, etc. Fair Trade options go up against regular products and are not exempt from competition even within their own class. For coffee alone, there are approximately 200 grower associations from 24 countries listed on the Fair Trade registry. Fair Trade products also vie for market distinction through prestigious awards from Food and Wme magazine and other food and beverage reviews. 
Moreover, in Economic Justice for All, the U.S. Catholic Bishops state that "the economy should work for people, and not the other way around." Catholic Social Teaching reminds us that where we stand with God depends on how we stand with each other. As consumers, we are moral agents, not just economic agents. Fair Trade offers a non-violent, non-political option to level the playing field for produc­ers in the global South and to give a hand, not a handout. 
This essay would not be complete with­out passing on a recommendation for my favorite coffee, Green Mountain Island Coconut-Fair Trade certified.

'TMNT' REBOOTS POPULAR FRANCHISE 
By RAMA GOTTUMUKKALA 
Senior Staff Writer 
"TMNT" is a reunion only the movies could arrange. Like so many treasured gems from the '80s, "TMNT" takes a laughably delightful premise and reminds us why we fell in love with it in the first place. 
Or not. If these heroes in a half-shell failed to endear themselves to you a decade ago, there's a good chance "TMNT" can't redeem them now. Fortunately, writer/director Kevin Munroe and his creative team never confuse their film for high art. This latest movie, like all three that preceded it, caters exclusively to the fans. And it's better oif for it. 
"TMNT" plays out like a run-in with four dear childhood friends. Like most pleasant memories, they're just like we remember them. Mostly. 
After defeating Shredder and saving feudal Japan, our heroes have grown apart as a family. Leonardo no longer leads, instead traveling the world to hone his leaving plenty of angst to drive the story forward. Plus, it's nice to know how these turtles get the bank to fund their pizza habit. 
Aided by perennial favorites Casey Jones and April O'Neil, the turtles need to wrangle 13 mythi­cally ugly beasties and thwart four stone villains in their attempt to achieve -surprise, surprise ­immortality. 
Like its predecessors, "TMNT" never flexes a muscular plot. It's more like what turtle stew tastes like, I imagine. Thin and sloppy, the plot is completely in service of its characters. The best moments in the movie come when the tur­ties act like a family. They relax, joke, squabble and roughhouse together just like they did 15 years ago. 
In a long-running franchise, fans develop expectations for their heroes. A giant turtle nut himself, Munroe wisely takes all these moments, splashes them into a blender and whips up a green pot­pourri that borders on recycling, but without the boredom that sets in from having seen it all before. He never crosses that line because

His alter ego, Cowabunga Carl, is a popular but abused MC at birthday parties for kids. Meanwhile, Master Splinter waits for the inevitable reconciliation between his four sons.

For the first time, a turtles movie succeeds in putting the "N" in "TMNT." Jim Henson and his puppeteering posse did an admirable job dropping the turtles into the New York of the '90s. "TMNT" shows us that they shouldn't have been realistic in the first place.

VINTAGE 'NINJA TURTLES' FILMS IN PERSPECTIVE 
By MARTY SCHROEDER Assistant Scene Editor 
With a love of pizza and cries of "Cowabunga!" the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are icons of a generation. With the film release of the newest addition to the· Turtles universe, it's important to remember the earlier films that made our younger eyes glow in wonder at the heroes in a half shell. 
Released in 1990, "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" promised our Renaissance-named heroes as "lean, green and on the screen," and it cer­tainly impressed every six-to-10 year old in the country. With the Turtles fighting their archrivals, the Foot Clan, they hid in the sewers of New York and delivered their own brand of justice all the while being led by the sagacious Splinter. With the aid of the cocksure Casey Jones and beautiful reporter April O'Neil, the vigilante Turtles bat­tled the evil Shredder. 
Starring Elias Koteas and Judith Hoag as Casey and April respectively, this film was panned by critics but loved by a generation. The suits the turtle actors wore left something to be desired in terms of matching lip move­ment and voices but they did their job well enough for a fan base raised on 


TURTLE TOYS THROUGH THE YEARS 
By NATE HOGAN Scene Writer 
The perhaps unfamiliar names Groundchuck, Walkabout and Dirtbag all have one thing in common. They are all the names of obscure charac­ters from the original line of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures. When the TMNT cartoon came out in 198 7, it captured the hearts of American youth and simply screamed merchandising. In the following year, Playmates Toys released the first line of a long chain of action figures for the TMNT cartoon and beyond. This release featured the classic characters anyone of our generation associates with the Ninja Turtles. This would be the classic four -Leonardo, Donatello, Michaelangelo and Raphael -plus their master, Splinter. Their compadre and confidant April O'Neil was also included. The Shredder, a Foot Soldier, Bebop and Rocksteady rounded out the line by providing a basis of villainous characters to pit against the gnarly four. 
These figures possessed great detail for the time and came with numerous accessories that added to their playa­bility. Shredder and Splinter even fea­tured cotton capes, which one could take the liberty of removing and giving to more worthy characters if one so chose. (The fashion trend in "The the cartoon version. 
Following the success of the first film, "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze" was released the following year. The sequel delved into the origins of the Turtles, introducing the radioactive material that trans­formed them from mere house pets to the league of headband-wearing crime fighters they were to become. The introduction of two new villains, Tokka and Rahzar, added to the fantastic nature of this film. 
More light-hearted than the first film, "Turtles II" features the famous "Go Ninja, Go!" sequences performed by the inimitable Vanilla Ice. A rather unneed­ed and out of context scene, this nonetheless became the unofficial tag line of the film. With ninjas a-go-going and animals and men alike finding new power in the "ooze," this movie was, like its predecessor, panned by critics but loved by fans. With its bouncing music and light-hearted tone, this was the children's film producers had been looking for. Unfortunately, with the third film, they went a little too far . 
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III" saw the Turtles travel back in time to feudal Japan with the aid of a magic scepter found by April. With poor pro­duction values, "TMNT III" saw the franchise take a nose-dive into the 
Incredibles" of not wearing capes does not apply to action figures, as a cape makes any figure infinitely better.) 
As the cartoon gained popularity, Playmates capitalized by continuing to release new figures. Characters from the show earned their immortality in plastic, such as the Cajun-accented Leatherhead, the Rat King and vigi­lante sports enthusiast Casey Jones. Jones featured what were arguably the greatest accessories ever: a golf bag which could go over his shoulder, complete with a golf club and two baseball bats for beating criminals into submission as he attempted to rid the world of bad sports. 
At this point, Playmates decided to branch out a little and began provid­ing their young market with a plethora of creative stimuli. In addition to sell­ing characters from the show, they released the original four with out­landish outfits as well as completely new characters who never even saw screen time. This opened the doors for imagination, allowing the owner to create the back story and personality of the figure, since no one actually paid attention to the canned history on the back of the figure's card. 
As mentioned before, Playmates released variants of the original turtles in every costume imaginable. To put this in perspective, from 1988 to 1995 Playmates released more than 30 fig­ure variants of Leonardo alone. These ridiculous. The Turtles had to battle weapons dealer Walker and the Japanese Lord Norinaga in order to prevent a war from breaking out. Granted, it is a children's film, but by 1993, fans of the Turtles were only get­ting older and yet the third film pan­dered to a younger audience than the second. While adding some memorable scenes to the canon, the third install­ment couldn't match the dark mis-en­scene of the first film, nor the happy­go-lucky innocence of the second. 

... ,, 
In the end, the early '90s Ninja Turtles trilogy represents only a small fraction of what the Ninja Turtles are. With the release of the original comic books, the franchise was born, and, fol­lowing those, the cartoons, toys and video games garnered a legion of chil­dren all over the world. Thankfully, the film tradition that began almost two decades ago is still alive and well.

included such greats as T.D. Tossin' Leo, lieutenant Leo and the ever-pop­ular Classic Rocker Leo. As interest began to wane, Playmates toned their production down, yet continued to steadily release figures based on the 1987 cartoon through 1997. 
The TMNT property was reinvigo­rated with the release of a new car­toon in 2003, after a failed revamp in 1997 known as· the next mutation. Of course a new line of figures was released to accompany the 2003 car­toon. These new figures were the same old characters, but with a much edgier look. The increased articula­tion, superior paint jobs on characters and weapons and increased detail in both the accessories and expressions hooked kids of a new generation on the characters. Not only was the car­toon better looking than ever, but the figures looked as if they were lifted straight from the television and put in the arms of the imaginative viewers. 
Fans of the original cartoon can appreciate the updated representation of their favorite classics in plastic, while recalling a time when figures opened their playtime up to tjle whims of the imagination. Cowabunga, dude!

BAY'S 'TRANSFORMERS' MORPHS INTO SUMMER BLOCKBUSTI!R 
By SEAN SWEANY Assistant Scene Editor 

The "robots in disguise" are back. The iconic, shape-shifting robot char­acters of the "Transformers" world return to the big screen this summer in an epi.c film creators hope will reinvig­orate and re-launch the franchise. 
Launched in 1984 as a combination toy line/comic book series that quickly spawned a popular animated series, Transformers earned a spot in the minds of youths around the world as a fun, action-packed story about the basic premise of good versus evil. The unusual and imaginative "wow factor" of Transformers rests in the fact that the characters can transform into objects such as cars, planes or animals, lending the "Robots in disguise" and "More than meets the eye" taglines. 
The basic premise of Transformers pits the intrinsically good Autobots ­led by the benevolent Optimus Prime ­against the evil Decepticons -ruled by the tyrant Megatron -in a search for new sources of energy on Earth, as resources on their planet Cybertron have run out. This basic plot, which has survived many years and changes to the Transformers universe, has always been the main focus of the series, especially on the big screen. 
The first film adaptation of the show -"Transformers: The Movie" ­debuted in 1986 as an animated pic­ture that fit into the storyline of the animated television show that aired from 1984 to 1987. The film and TV series maintained the comic book look of the Transformers and remained pop­ular throughout the 1990s. While often over-the-top and unrealistic, the ani­mated programs were popular enough to sell millions of toys to fans, thus ensuring their popularity and longevity. 
By 1996, however, the Transformers world was in need of a facelift and cre­ators devised a new line of toys and tel­evision shows called "Beast Wars." This took the traditional characters and gave them completely animal forms. Whereas the original Optimus Prime morphed into a semi-trailer truck, his Beast Wars counterpart was an ape named Optimus Primal. 
The Beast Wars line also eventually died out and Transformers faded fr-om the public consciousness until a state­ment in 2005 announced that a live­action film would roll into theaters in 2007. When Michael Bay was attached as director, Transformers fans experi­enced both delight and anguish. 
There was no doubt that thrilling, epic action scenes would be present, but the big question was whether "Transformers" would follow the likes of Bay's critical flops such as "Pearl Harbor" and "Armageddon" or if it would become at worst a decent film such as "The Island." 
As the release date draws near and more production photos and stories become available, it seems that "Transformers" will be more like "The Island" -combining an effects extrav­aganza with a compelling storyline. A strong cast of supporting actors includ­ing Jon Voight, John Turturro and Bernie Mac join up-and-coming lead actor Shia LeBeouf ("Holes") in per-forming what has been rated an intelli­gent script. 

As with previous rehashes of the Transformers franchise, the new film will bring a new look to the robots. Gone is the boxy, old-fashioned look of the 1980s, replaced with a sleek, smooth style more befitting the 21st century. 
Bay insisted that every mechanical part of the machines and their trans­forming motions be as realistic as pos­sible so as to lend a credibility to his film that was sometimes lacking in the cartoons. The CGI will also have a level of detail never before seen, as Bay has boasted that it takes 38 hours to ren­der a single frame of animation. 
These stringent standards for the "Transformers" movie accompany high expectations held by a caring and loyal fanbase. These fans will subject the film to intense scrutiny and criticism not out of cynicism, but from a desire for the material to hold up to its beloved predecessors. 
Only when the film is released July 4 will we know if Bay's movie is more than meets the eye.

Orson Welles hated his final role. He thought so little of it he couldn't even recall the name of the character he voiced. "I play a big toy who attacks a bunch of smaller toys," Welles said cryptically of the movie. 
For the record, he was mostly right. His character, Unicron, is an insatiable, planet­devouring robot that threatens the whole galaxy in "Transformers: The Movie," an animated classic from 1986. Like the proj­ect as a whole, Unicron was dreamed up for the sole purpose of selling more Transformers toys, the white-hot phenome­non of the '80s. Whether he wanted to or not, Welles helped fulfill that goal admirably. 
More surprising, though, is the film's cur­rent cult status among children of the '80s. When it was released, it was marketed so poorly that it was out of theaters before kids even knew it was made. Critics reamed it for its dark and violent tone. No Transformers had died on the kid-friendly ani­mated show, yet they were dying by the dozens in the movie. The most egregious violation of all, according to naysayers, was the gutsy choice to kill off the noble Optimus Prime, heart and soul of the series, midway through the film. His death was short-lived, but its impact was not. 
Twenty years later, hindsight has been much kinder to the film. In many ways, the movie was ahead of its time. In the '90s, shows like "Batman: The Animated Series" won Emmys for their grim, gritty approach to superheroics. But never before had ani­mated fare, especially one with the enor­mous fan following that the Transformers enjoyed, gone this dark. 

As a movie, "Transformers" worked per­fectly well for what it was: an intergalactic adventure that juggled its sizable cast of characters with ease. The first act of the film is one of the strongest of any animated movie outside of the Disney banner. The evil Megatron launches a devastating attack on the Autobots, only to be halted by the arrival of Optimus Prime. 
Robots on both sides suffer grievous injuries and die. The Autobots are left with­out a leader after Prime's death. Hope is tenuous. And Unicron looms in the dis­tance, ready to devour all. The second and third acts suffer in comparison, but charac­ters change, mature and are redeemed. Heroes rise to the occasion, and robots on both sides live to disguise themselves and fight another day. 
On the cusp of Michael Bay's $150 mil­
lion live-action film, 
Sony BMG has dug deep 
into the Transformers 
archives and has 

released a two-disc spe­cial edition DVD to coincide with the ani­mated film's 20th anniversary. 
Prior to this release, the widescreen ver­sion of the original theatrical release had never been available on home video. This release contains both widescreen and fullscreen versions, the latter of which has been available on video tape for years.

Associated Press 
MELBOURNE, Australia -Michael Phelps stood on deck with 50 Cent blaring in one ear, a steely deter­mination in both eyes. When his name was announced to the crowd at Rod Laver Arena, the young American did noth­ing more than stare down the strip of water at his feet. 
Next door at the warmup pool, Phelps' teammates stopped what they were doing -even those who had races of their own coming up at the world championships. They had to see this one for them­selves, so they paused to watch it on a big screen. 

"I had a thought in my head," Aaron Peirsol would say later, "that this was going to be one of those legendary races." 
With four laps of the pool Thursday night, Michael Phelps wiped out Boogie and took down the ghost of Thorpedo, leaving little doubt that we're all getting the privilege of watching the greatest swimmer ever to hit the pool. 
"You just can't count him out of any race that he's in," said Mark Schubert, head coach of the U.S. team. "He's obviously on a mission. He's going to be real special here -and 
IN BRIEF 

Kerry argues ~ainst DireclV Extra Inn1ngs deal in Senate 
WASHINGTON -Sen. John Kerry urged Major League Baseball on Tuesday to hold off on a deal to put the sport's "Extra Innings" package of out-of-market games exclusively on DirecTV Group Inc. A top base­ball official declined to agree, with opening day less than a week away. 
Kerry, D-Mass., made the push at a Senate Commerce Committee hear­ing on behalf of subscribers to cable TV and EchoStar Communications Corp.'s Dish Network who had received the package previously. 
The dispute concerns which homes will receive baseball's new television network in 2009. DirecTV, a satellite service, has agreed to carry that package as part of its deal. The com­pany would also receive an equity stake in the channel. 
"What's the matter with that?" Kerry asked Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer.

Phelps already is special, of course, his legacy cemented by performances such as his six-gold, two­bronze medal haul at the 2004 Athens Olympics, or his five world records ­two of them in different events on the same day ­at the 2003 world champi­onships in Barcelona.

rary pool. 
"I will say," Phelps allowed, "everything was pretty close to perfect in that race." 
On a night when four world records fell, three of them to the powerful U.S. team, no one stood out more than the 21-year-old who loves hip-hop music, video games and a pet 
bulldog that he had  to  
leave  back  home  in  
Michigan.  

The 200-meter freestyle record was one of swim­ming's hallowed marks, the time of 1 minute, 
44.06 seconds set six years ago by Australia's Ian Thorpe, the iconic "Thorpedo." 
NFL owners vote to make 
replay rule permanent 
PHOENIX -Replay is here to stay in the NFL. 
League owners voted 30-2 on Tuesday to make the video replay system to aid officiating a permanent tool. All but three stadiums will be equipped with high-definition equip­ment and will be recabled before the upcoming season. The stadiums being replaced in Irving, Texas, Indianapolis and East Rutherford, N.J., will not get the updates. 
"It's a long time coming," said Atlanta Falcons general manager Rich McKay, co-chairman of the competition committee that recom­mended the change. "It made sense to us this year to do it. Instant replay is an accepted part of the game. It's what we are. There was not really much discussion about it." 
Cincinnati and Arizona voted against the proposal, as they nearly always do on replay issues. 

Williams U.Pends Sharapova
in Sony Encsson Open 
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. -Serena Williams bounced the ball at the baseline, eager to serve. Maria Sharapova stood with her back to the court, frowning at her racket and in no hurry to continue. Sharapova finally took her posi­tion, and the rout resumed. 
There was no slowing Williams on Tuesday. In a result reminis­cent of the Australian Open final, she beat the top~seeded Sharapova 6-1, 6-1 to reach the quarterfinals of the Sony Ericsson Open. 
"Once she gets up in the set or in the match, she seems to steam­roll," Sharapova said. 
The match was only the third for Williamf:l since she defeated Sharapova 6-1, 6-2 in Melbourne two months ago. Williams bristled when asked if she expected such an easy rematch.

ND looks to extend streak against MSU 
Irish, winners of ten straight matches, to face rival Spartans 
ByJAMES WADE 
Spcirrs Writer 

No. 5 Notre Dame will try to extend its longest winning streak in five years against rival Michigan State in East Lansing today at 2:30p.m. 
The Irish, who are fresh off a dominant 7-0 victory over Purdue this weekend, have 
not  lost  in  their  last  10  
matches.  
But Michigan State is  no  

slouch. The Spartans are coming off a recent double­
forced to play indoors again after starting their outdoor circuit. The indoor game has a faster pace with a different rhythm than the outdoor matches for which the Irish have been preparing. 
"I think the biggest thing is where the match will be played -will it be inside or outside," Irish coach Bob Bayliss said. 
There are also a few of interesting matchups within the contest -Notre Dame's No. 1 singles player, national No. 8 Stephen Bass, barely won in a closely contested tiebreaker last year against Michigan State's Nick Rinks. Rinks has continued to play well this season as well. He is the reigning Big Ten player of the

W h i I e Michigan State's record is not quite up to par with Notre Dame's 16-2 mark, the Irish have strug­gled against the Spartans in the past. Two years ago, an Irish team ranked in the top 25 barely escaped East Lansing, having to win four three-setters to claim a victo­ry. 
But the outcome of today's match may depend on factors other than normal tennis skills. The weather report in East Lansing is forecasting rain with a high of 50 degrees. If the weather is as predicted, the Irish will be

"They serve big and are very aggressive around the net, and they have beaten us more than we have beaten them in the past," Bayliss ·said of the matchup. 
Bayliss said he feels there is no added pressure on the Irish because of their current win streak, and his main focus in on leaving East Lansing with a win.

record. 
Offensively, senior center­fielder Stephanie Brown should cause trouble for Toledo. Leading the Big East in on-base percentage at .487, Brown has come up big for the Irish in the leadoff spot. Brown is second in the conference in batting aver­age at .412. 
The Rockets have struggled to start the season and head into South Bend on a three­game skid. Pitching woes have been the main source of Toledo's struggles -the Rockets have given up an aver­age of 6.8 runs per game. 
One of the few bright spots The junior has batted .370 on the season, including four homers and 11 RBI. Aside from Strong, however, the Rockets have also struggled to produce on the offensive end -no other batter is hitting over .250. 

The game against Toledo is an out-of-conference break for the Irish, who will return to Big East play this weekend with doubleheaders at home against Pittsburgh and Syracuse. The Rockets begin Mid-American Conference pl11y Saturday against Buffalo. 
No Irish players were avail­able for comment prior to the game.

six different players knocking in a run. The game marked Stewart's first start for the Irish since a March 9, 2005 loss to Coastal Carolina. 
Senior first baseman Mike Dury got the Irish on the board in the bottom half of the first, hitting a two-run home run to left field after freshman third baseman A.J. Pollock drew a walk. The homer was Dury's team-leading sixth and gave him 16 RBis on the season. 
Stewart retired Central Michigan in order in the sec­ond before Joey Williamson pitched three scoreless innings in relief.

Schrage said. "I thought it was his best outing of the season." 
But the Irish couldn't claw back into the game and scored only twice more. They mount­ed rallies in the sixth and sev­enth innings, but in both cases their efforts were squashed before they could inflict enough damage to even the score. 
"We were hitting into some hard luck today," Schrage said. 
With one out and the bases full in the sixth, Central Michigan third baseman Noah Lankford dived to stop a hard grounder off the bat of Irish left fielder Ryan Connolly, before stepping on third and firing to first to complete an inning-ending double play. 
"Ryan couldn't have hit that ball any harder," Schrage said. "Things just weren't falling for us." 
In the seventh, the Irish took advantage of two walks and two wild pitches to scratch out a pair of runs, but pinch hitter Ryan Smith grounded out with the bases loaded to end the threat. 
"We're still waiting for the two-out clutch hit," Schrage said. 
The Irish left 11 runners on base in the game after strand­ing 14 against South Florida Sunday. 
"We're getting enough guys on base, enough opportuni­ties," Schrage said. "Hopefully, things will even out for us." 
Senior right-hander Kurt Lauscher got the win for the Chippewas, working six-plus innings and surrendering four earned runs while striking out four. 
Senior James Ricchio worked 2 1-3 scoreless innings to record the save. Central Michigan shortstop Jeff Helps went 2-for-4, including a two­run single in the eighth that sealed a win for the Chippewas after the Irish had cut the deficit to two in the seventh.

"More than the players them­selves, it's just how they run the operation," he said. "The first part of being a quarterback is being able to take the playcall, call it in the huddle, get to the line of scrimmage and just run the operation." 
Of the four, only Sharpley has taken a snap during a contest, playing in parts of eight games. Sharpley mostly handed off dur­ipg those times, completing 1-of­2 passes for seven yards in his Irish career -not exactly sig­nificant experience. 
But even though his playing time is extremely limited, Sharpley still has one more year in Weis' system than any of the other quarterbacks. 
"If there's anyone that has an obvious, slight advantage through experience it would be [Sharpley]," Weis said. "Not nec­essarily playing time, but the fact that he was around me a lot when I was talking to [former Irish quarterback] Brady [Quinn]." 
Despite Sharpley's experience within the program, Weis said he is giving equal attention and "exactly the same" coaching to all four quarterbacks. One of the ways Weis has kept the coach­ing so equal is by teaching the system from the very beginning. 
The equal coaching is espe­cially beneficial for Clausen, the only quarterback to have spent no time in the system so far. 
"I think he's made some progress and we've seen some encouraging signs, but it's way too early for me to be jumping on anyone's bandwagon," Weis said of the freshman. "He's done some encouraging things in the first four days." 
Weis also explained how Clausen is at no disadvantage because he is a freshman. 
"We're kind of starting from scratch, so he's not really behind on that end because I'm installing everything as if they're hearing it for the first time," Weis said. "But he doesn't have the luxury of having heard the terminology or running the whole operation before in this Players cannot sign binding prospect in the fieldl," Frank said.

During the spring practices, Weis has been at the lead in coaching the quarterbacks, along with quarterbacks coach Ron Powlus and ofl'ensive coor­dinator Mike Haywood. 
But after looking at the four for a week, Weis still hasn't seen. "it" -an intangible to separate one quarterback from the rest. 
"Let's let them get through shell shock first," he said. "They're getting a lot of coach­ing, they're getting scrutinized. They know that this is a compe­tition and everything they do is part of the evaluation." 
Adding to the pressure for the quarterbacks is their general inexperience at the college level 
something especially 
poignant at a school with the media attention and tradition of Notre Damn. 
"There's a lot of pressure on these guys right now," Weis said. "Throw on top of that the fact that nveryone in thn free world knows who's going to be the new quarterback at Notre Dame." 
Weis remains optimistie about his team's quarterback, even if right now isn't the right time to find answers. 
"I think we'll lind out early on if somebody has that something whnn the time comes," lw said. "But right now I think it's really early in the evaluation."

Weis sees no standout in four-way battle to replace Brady Quinn 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Associate Sports Editor 
One week into the spring sea­son, Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis has given no indication that he's ready to say-or if he even knows -if any of the four Irish quarterbacks vying for the starting job have separated themselves from the pack. 
The four competitors to be Notre Dame's lead signal-caller next year are early-entry fresh­man Jimmy Clausen, rising sophomores Zack Frazer and Demetrius Jones and rising jun­ior Evan Sharpley. 
One of the main traits Weis said he is looking for in his quarterbacks is their ability to lead the offense.

Cincinnati tight end expected to add name to list of2008 recruits 
By CHRIS KHOREY Sports Editor 

Kyle Rudolph, a 6-foot-7, 235-pound junior tight end from Elder High School in Cincinnati is expected to announce his verbal commit­ment to Notre Dame today. 
Rudolph would become the fifth verbal commitment for Irish coach Charlie Weis' 2008 recruiting class, joining defen­sive tackle Sean Cwynar, wide receiver John Goodman and offensive linemen Braxton Cave and Mike Golic, Jr. 
Mike Frank, who covers Notre Dame recruiting for Irisheyes.com, compared Rudolph to current Notre Dame tight end John Carlson.

Bargar and Co. look to stay unbeaten at home 
By MICHAEL BRYAN Sports Writer 

Notre Dame will look to con­tinue its winning ways at home tonight at 6 p.m., facing off against Toledo at Ivy Field. 
After winning five in a row at home last weekend, the Irish (14-12) attempt to stay unbeat­en on their own turf against the Rockets (4-14). The red-hot Notre Dame pitching staff, which has led the way during their win streak, should chal­lenge the slumping Toledo club. 
In their five home wins, Irish hurlers have posted an earned­run average of 0.66. Leading the way for the Irish has been sophomore Brittney Bargar, who was named Big East pitch­er of the week Tuesday. 
Bargar went 3-0 with wins over IUPUI, St. John's and Seton Hall. The righty allowed only two runs in her three starts, shutting out St. John's and pitching complete games in all three contests. Bargar also struck out 20 batters in 20 innings on the weekend, bring­ing her season total to a team­leading 109. 
Freshman Heather Johnson, one of Notre Dame's offensive leaders during the streak, was also named to the Big East honor roll for the week. ln the five Irish wins, Johnson batted .538 with five doubles and six HBI. The infielder posted a pair of three-hit games -including three doubles against Seton Hall, matching a Notre Dame
