With the space shuttle moving effortlessly through space, astronauts Jack R Lousma and C. Gordon Fullerton exercised Columbia's arm yesterday and wrestled with a long day's flurry of discomforts and frustrations. Day two in space: there was tile damage across the bridge ofColumbia's nose; mist on the cock­pit windows; cabin temperatures too warm, then too cool, then just right; a video camera on the blink; two others out. "The systems problems you normally expect to find were extremely light," said Flight Director Harold Draughon. There was no suggestion of any­thing to shorten the flight, which is to end Monday. The cameras caused the toughest problems. Fullerton needed the electronic eyes to help him grapple a package with the "end effectuator" -hand ­on Columbia's robot arm. An elbow camera was needed to scan Columbia's body for tile damage. Mission Control said the damaged tiles were not located in a critical area. The tiles protect the ship from the heat of reentry. The most heat forms on the ship's un­derside. -AP 
Despite reported White House opposition, evangelist Billy Graham announced yesterday he will visit the Soviet Union in May to attend an international conference on nuclear war and to preach at two Moscow churches. Graham said he was accept­ing an invitation from Patriarch Pimen to speak at a Russian Or­thodox cathedral, and he also plans to speak at a Baptist church. Newsweek magazine reported earlier this month that the Reagan administration was pressuring Graham not to make the trip, fearing the Soviets would use him for propaganda purposes. "I'm sure there has been discussion with our government, especially in that it refers to the country of Russia," said Donald L. Bailey, a spokesman for Graham. Asked ifanyone at the White House had tried to discourage Graham from going, Bailey said, "I cannot speak to that because I don't have that information." -AP 
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger 
told Allied defense ministers yesterday that the United States "is in the final stages" of preparing strategic arms reduction proposals, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday. However, this official indicated to reporters that the United States would move into a new round of strategic arms control talks only ifthe Soviets refrained from causing trouble in the world. "We are looking for a positive amosphere in which to initiate the talks," said the official, who briefed reporters after the opening round ofa two-day meeting of13 defense ministers 
from North Atlantic Treaty Organizaton nations. 
The strategy session, held behind closed doors, is a semi-annual review ofalliance nuclear planning. The official, who spoke with the understanding his name would not be used, indicated under questioning that a worsening of the situation in Poland might delay the opening ofthe strategic arms talks. -AP 
President Reagan, conceding that he is bothered by questions about his compassion, said yesterday he is trying to save, not destroy, "what is best in our system of humane, free govern­ment." At the same time, the president said his request for $22 bil­lion in defense spending for 1983, an 18 percent buildup, "represents an historically reasonable share ofour resources and is far less than the potential disaster a weakened America could face at the hands of a ruthless, powerful foe." Reagan's remarks were prepared for delivery to the National Conference ofChristians and Jews, which bestowed its Charles Evans Hughes Gold Medal upon 
the president. That award, for "courageous leadership in govern­ment, civic and humanitarian affitirs," caused some controversy within the interreligious, interracial group even before it was given at the black-tie dinner. Reagan is the first incumbent president to receive the award. -AP 
The five Pangborn students expelled from their dorm on Wednesday, March 10 have all found off-campus housing, according to one of the five. Joe Carreiro, a resident in Pangborn, said they asked him to throw down blankets the Sunday night after break, because they were planning to sleep in their cars. After a few hours, however, they contacted a friend in Notre Dame Apartments who took four ofthem in until Monday night. The other was staying with his girl friend. All five have since found permanent . housing. Although Notre Dame Housing director, Fr. Michael Hep­
pen, refused to comment on this particular case, he did note that a student's room and board fee is generally pro-rated in such cases. ­

Hesburgh trip raises opposition 
--~--­

University President Theodore Hesburgh's up­comimg trip to El Salvador has drawn strong opposition from a campus-based Solidarity group. 
Hesburgh belongs to the United States' observation 
group, one of five national groups which accepted El 
Salvador's invitation to oversee the Salvadoran elec­
tions. El Sal~ador asked sixty countries to participate. 
In an open letter to Hesburgh, the Solidarity group 
urged him to cancel his participation in the State 
Department's mission of observing the March 28 elec­
tions. The group maintains that the elections are non­
representative of the Salvadoran people because 
"opposition candidates and supporters are threatened with death upon public appearance in the country." 
The Solidarity group added that a truly democratic process is "currently impossible" because El Salvador is in a state of civil war. A recent U.S. News and World Report article noted that no matter what the outcome of the elections, Washington's prospects for achieving democracy in the war-torn Central American republic "look slim at best." 
The article adds that "few observers (in El Salvador) expect the balloting to open the way for settlement ofa guerilla war that already has claimed more than 32,000 lives since fighting erupted two years ago between left­ist rebels and a shaky American-backed junta" 
A letter presented Congress last Thursday Representative Don). stated that the elections are "unlikely bring the conflict closer to solution. Although fair and open elections would desirable, such elections are not presently possible." 
The letter emphasized 
that the United States has 
situation," most 
resulting in increasing quan­
tities of military assistance 
and perhaps American com­

bat troops in order for the junta to survive. 
In a recent interview with the South Bend Tribune. 
Hesburgh described the current atmosphere in El Sal­
vador as "a witch's broth," claiming "the right says if 
you don't vote, we're going to shoot you. The left says if 
you do vote, we're going to shoot you." 
The Solidarity group said it believes the political reality ofEI Salvador will be misrepresented to U.S. ob­servers, citing that blatant violations will probably not be visible to observers on election day since the politi­cal coercion is taking place now. 
Any fraudulent activity will most likely take place in 
the countryside and behind the scenes, according to 
the Solidarity group. Hesburgh said in the Tribune in­
terview that whether foreign observers will be allowed 
to visit polls in the countryside has not been 
determined yet. 

The left has refused to participate in the elections, 
and the Solidarity group noted that the present regime 
has refused any negotiations with the Democratic 
Revolutionary Front (FDR). 

Congressman Gerry Studds stated that "a list of 138 'psychopaths', 'traitors', and 'terrorists' which the military declared its intention to 'relentlessly pursue'" was compiled by the Army last spring. He noted that this list included every significant memher of the FOR's leadership. 
The Solidarity group claims Heshurgh's personal safety in El Salvador is a major concern. Following a meeting with Hesburgh yesterday, a Solidarity group member noted that "Hesburgh implied several times that he was risking his life in making this trip." 
"Hesburgh listened to our point of view during the meeting, but said he had made his decision and we weren't going to change that decision. He admits that this is a near-impossible situation, but explained that he 
is trying to help bring about a peaceful solution, the member said. 
"( Hesburgh's) rationale is that power is needed in or­der negotiate, and he believes that Duarte is our answer. Hesburgh thinks 
that  the  vote  will  give  
Duarte power."  
Right-wing  challenger  

Roberto D'Aubuisson, a cas­hiered army major allegedly involved in the 1980 assas­sination of Archbishop Os­car Arnulfo Romero, is showing strength in the final days of the campaign. D'Aubuisson has pledged to exterminate the leftist rebels if he becomes presi-
With the many ambiguities surrounding the upcom­ing Salvadoran elections and with Congressmen and Notre Dame's own El Salvador Solidarity group citing doubts concerning the voting process, there is dis­agreement over what the election will accomplish, and what Hesburgh's participation implicates. 
The Solidarity group claims Hesburgh's presence will legitimize a "fraudulent" election process. Congress­men criticize U.S. policy toward El Salvador. Maybe, as Tribune reporter Gail Hinchion implied, the problem is a lack ofcommunication. 
Hesburgh said in that interview that of all the State Department-selected observation team members, he thought he was the only one who spoke their (El Sal­vador's) language. Maybe the communication gap be­tween the observers and the Salvadoran people extends far beyond this peculiarity.

In search of a type of writing 

Whew! What I had to do to get to this typewriter! You see, at this very moment, I am here at school on break and have decided that it would be a good idea to get this column done ~d Q!!!_ ofth~. 
Michael Molinelli 
This column has been given to me by the new Obseroer editorials editor who figured I might actually have something to say that wouldn't fit in a four panel "Molarity." Since I'm graduating in May, if I didn't have anything to say, no one would have to listen to it for very long anyway. 
Back to the subject ...I've been trying to get to a typewriter but they all seem to be either locked up or in exile. I would use mine, but two years ago I returned the carriage and it kept going. Most of my friends with typewriters are either at home relaxing, in Florida sunning or in Colorado seeing 


El Salvador's whole picture 
In this, the second ofa two-part series on El Salvador, Venezuelan student Edgardo Tenreiro ex­amines the accomplishments of the Duarte government and the responses of the leftist guerrillas to Duarte's social and political reforms. 
Amajor factor in the faulty views concerning the El Salvadoran situa­tion stem from the unclear in­formation about the present junta's policies toward political, economic and social reform. 
Despite all the difficult times and misinformation, Duarte's government has fulfilled three very important goals. 
By gradually gaining control over the conservative military sec­tors, it has prevented a rightist coup, which would bring the country back to the old structure. Through this control, it has also diminished many of the crimes committed by the conservative military against El Salvador's citizens. 
Duarte does not excuse these brutal injustices, but he explains: "One would have to think about what it means to count on armed forces who were told for over fifty years, 'Power that is not used loses prestige.' These people have dominated the country with ter­ror, and we are forced to govern 
the country with those same 
policemen." 
To help remedy that situation, the young military commanders have ordered the armed forces to respect civilians. More than five hundred members of the armed forces have been dismissed for this abuse. Also, rightist military leaders have been removed. Rota­tions of soldiers in provinces has been instituted to break old loyalty to oligarchs who used them to in­timidate and kill peasants. 
The second goal, the land 
reform, has been the most com­
plete ever accommplished in the 
Americas. More that 350,000 land­
less peasants are now landowners. 
Reports show that, even in civil war, the new cooperatives are producing more and better crops thari the old land structure. 
Lastly, an electoral commission was named, and hopefully, elec­tions will take place this coming March 28th. However, the leftists guerrillas are not going to par­ticipate in these elections, though Duarte insisted that a political solution can be obtained by leaving the weapons behind and joining the elections. 
Guerrillas do not want a free election, but a new government. The junta answers that the leftists want to win by negotiation the power they cannot obtain by force. This negotiation would lead to the installation of a government similar to the firsts juntas. 
Experience has shown that when the Marxists joined the government, the violent guerrillas actions did not stop. 
While the media has failed to recognize the positive effort ofthe Duarte government, the press has overlooked the guerrillas' destructive activities. In the begin­ning, the military actions of the leftists were centered on kidnap­ping, bombings, intimidation of peasants, and the assassination of government sympathizers. Then, they focused attacks on economic objectives: bridges, roads, electri­cal installations, banks and businesses. 
Currently, guerrillas are obstructing the electoral process by direct violence against towns and by intimidating possible voters. Another strategy used is the penetration of the international press. 
For example, leftists gained major public attention when they destroyed the most important air force base, giving the impression that they can attack anywhere in El Salvador and that they are winning the war. 
Five weeks ago, members of the guerrillas guided reporters from The New York Times and The Washington Post among others through the Morazan province and obtained a front page information that described the guerrillas as noble· savages and the armed forces as cruel savages. 
Ifthe Marxists guerrillas were as popular as some Americans, Europeans and Latin Americans think, they would make an effort to participate in the elections instead of boycotting them and threaten­ing the voters. 
Scholastic recently published pictures of "military labor" with­out a clear explanation of El Sal­vador's military structure. Aposter used to advertise a lecture about El Salvador, pictured a soldier killing a peasant. This misinformation has made us anxious to be sympathetic with the falsely named "popular 
supported guerrillas," and 
opposed to the Duarte govern­
ment which is making a great effort 
to seek and apply the proper solu­
tions to the bloody crisis in El Sal­
vador. 

what more snow looks like. 
The only time I got off campus was with Joe to feast at a local McDonald's. There some teenage girls gawked at my ratty tie and at his collar bar. It's not exactly an 
orgy  on  Daytona  Beach  but  it  
broke up the week.  
Anyway,  about  eight  locked  

doors and a sword-carrying eunuch stood between me and the typewriters at the Obseroer offices so I was completely out of luck. I took out my frustration at the Rockne pool, sat on the steps ofthe Architecture building and began wondering if there was an Olivetti in my future. Writing isso difficult. 
Three things a columnist needs (after the typewriter) are Space, Subject, and Style. The editors have given me these precious column inches, so I suppose I have my space ("Oh wow, man"). So far, I've managed pretty well to digress at every turn so I suppose I can do without a subject. 
What occurs to me, is that I'll need some sort ofwriting style. 
Should I emulate other colum­nists that I have read? Should I be aother Jimmy "Life's tough as bul­lets, so spit it in the eye" Breslin or another Andy "It's little things in life that I find amusing" Rooney? 
I could get political and try to prove I'm an intelligent con­servative like William "Bill" Buck­ley, but we've already seen that isn't possible. I could ignore politics, get domestic and try to write like Erma It's the little things in life that bug me Bombeck. 
I could emulate some ofthe Ob­seroer's own outstanding colum­nists ...like Tony Walton, only he 
actually  believes  the  things  he  
writes.  
I  could  try  to  be  like  Paul  

Kosidowski, but he can actually write. 
How about Fr. Griffin? No, what he writes comes from the heart and I haven't been able to find mine for years. (I lost it when I broke my typewriter). 
I could just make it appear as if I don't care what I put down on paper, likeJohn Macor. 
Whatever kind of columnist become I hope I'll be brief.

Make it your own -sundae night 
E
gads. Here it is again, Sunday night at the right-right side of South Dining hall. Eating those meat· balls reminded me of the time in Daytona when this big hulk kicked sand at my boyfriend, Mike's, face and it landed in my mouth. The bread was crisp and the salad was soft and moist -they always seem to mix those two up. This has been one of the most repulsive meals of my life. Can this evening be salvaged? Hark, hark! I see the ice cream line! 
Endee Cieri 
No, wait. I can't do that -I'll be abu.~ed, especially by Mike. It just isn't fair t(Jr girb up here. Why can't I wah a nice littlefour-scoops-of­tcmilia· two-ofstrawben-y­uhipped-cream-nuts-strauberries­c:ben-ies-chocolate-sauce-and­pineapple sundae and be left in peace to gracefully pig out? 
Oh no, never! 
I swear I should buy a shirt that says, "I skipped the other two meals, ran seven miles, jumped rope for an hour and swam I00 laps at the Rock -so just LEAVE ME ALONE, okay?" Unfortunately, the letters for that would cost me more than the loan Reagan gave me this year -al­though that doesn't say much. 
I've got to get a grip. Let's evaluate this situation: I pay room and board like any ofthe guys up here and this includes ice cream privileges. I am 
an adult, capable of making my own 
decisions, without being affected by 
that adolescent stage called peer 
pressure. 
I am woman, hear me roar! 
I'm also starving to death! 
Okay, let's do it! I'm standing 
up .. .I'm pushing out my chair ... "Look at that chick in sweats. I'll bet she's not going to thesalad bar." 
I'm sitting down .. .I'm not defeated, however. I lost the battle, but the war is far from over. It's time to usc a little strategy. Think, think of the war movies. Young soldier trudges on his belly, through the enemy lines. He can't be seen lest he be shot on sight. Will he be a hero? Carefully, carefully he slides forward on the soggy, shell-parched earth. Just watch out for the mines. Just watch out for ... 
"Endcc, what in the heck are you doing crawling under the table like that? You aren't headed for the SUNDAE line, are you?" 
"No, Mikt~. I was just looking for my contact lens." 
Foiled again. Boy, is this a bum­mer! I can just t<L~tc that icc cream now. I will neter surrender. 
Strategy 2: The l'm-only·gctting­it·for-my-anon·xic-friend routine. Up I go and here I am. Mmm, vanilla icc cream. Did I say four scoops -I meantsix. Strawberries, whipped cream, yummy, yummy nuts! Oh, wow! Chocolate ... 
"That's a pretty big sundae, Endee. You gonna kill that all offby your­self?" 
"Oh, no, Mike. I have this anorexic friend, see, and she's at my table. And as a true friend, I feel it is my duty ... 
"Endee, you're eating alone." 
"I am?" 
"You are." 
"Oh." 
Substrategy 2.5: Drop your bowl and retreat. Let's think this out. It's 
6: I 5 and Mike will be leaving soon. If I can just-I know! Strategy 3: The Digger strategy. Only 15 minutes left. I'll stall! (Time lapse). 
Ah. 6:30 is finally here and Mike's gone to the 'brar'. Sundae line, here I come! Oh, no. It's those foodservice ladies. I gotta get there before they ...before they ...oh, no! They're putting it away. I'm going to cry. No, I can't. I have one plan left. Strategy 4: ROAD TRIP. just a little jaunt to D-2 and I'll be at Bonnie Doon's in no time! 
"Yes, ma'am, I'll have your 'dozen­super-double-scooper-lotsa-nuts· and-other-stuff' special." 
"That will be 54.50." 
Mmm. Heavenly! This is great! I don't care iftownies see me pork out. (Time lapse). 
I almost feel sick. I can't believe I ate the whole thing. Oh, but it wasso good! That'll show those N.D. chauvinists. I just gotta get this last little spoonful ... 
"Endee?" 
"Oh. Hi, Mike." 
Strategy 5: Exile. When's the next 
plane to Siberia?

is half-tro.e. The names have been changed to protect the half-guilty.

Presidents go to camp to write history 
'('m not at all satisfied with history the way it's beingwritten. We've .lau taken history courses in school and most ofus were skepticalof some ofthe information given to us as historical fact. 
There's a lot more history piling up on us every day but we ought to be gaining on it because, with pictures and sound recording, it's easier to preserve original documents than it was I00or 1,000 years ago. Everyone 500 years from now ought to know everything about us. They won't, though, because too many of the things being saved as historywon't present an accurate picture ofwhat was going on in 1982. 
I propose we establish a National Academy ofHistory. It would be this group's job to pass on to the future exactly what happened and what we were like in our years here on earth. I even have some specific suggestions for how the National Academy ofHistory (NAH) would go about the job. 
Forexample,itwouldinsist 





flndy Rooney
that President Reagan, Carter, Ford and Nixon get together for a long weekend at Camp David, with no one else around, and let their hair down. (In Gerald Ford's case, I'm speaking figuratively about hair.) They'd promise that nothing they said would be released for 50 years. 
The three ex-presidents and Reagan would begiven anything they wanted to eat ordrink but they'd also be given an occasional shot of sodium pentothal, the drug that makes people blab the truth. 
There arc, currently living, seven wives ofpresidents: Bess,Jackie, lady Bird, Pat, Betty, Rosalyn and Nancy. These women have a view ofhistory that is different and more accurate in many specific details than any historian will ever get. The girls ought to get together while the boys are at Camp David. Ifthey'd relax, they'd probably like each other. Ifthey'd talk, we'd have some real history. 
This newly established NAH of mine would organize all kinds of groups to get at and preserve the details ofhistory that are being lost now. It wouldn't be simply the historyofpower.lt would be the his­tory of Us. 
We study the day before yesterday looking for clues about how to behave so we'll be happier tomorrow. That's what history is for and we haven't been keeping it accurately enough. There are dozens of reasons why history doesn't ring true to us. 
Too many historians aren't just reporters looking for facts; they're theoreticians. They have some idea about the grand sweepofhistory and they write their books with too few facts and too many theories. 
Historians like to promote the idea that there's a rhythm to history and that events follow a pattern. They're often more interested in the pattern they think they see than the facts. They can't stand the thought that there might not be a pattern and that a lot ofimportant things happened in history, not by the design ofa king, a president or a dictator. But because ofsome dumb little unrecorded incident or accident that started things going one way instead ofanother. 
It's difficult to make people from one century intelligible to the people ofanother, and ifhistorians can't find out what's going on right now in our own country, how can we expect the historians of 10, 50 or 100 years from now to know anything at all that's true about us? 
If Reagan, Carter, Ford and Nixon get together, I'd sure love to submit a couple ofquestions.

Ruth, people didn't scare him. Fer­nando kind ofliked them. Ratings rose, sponsors got into the act. So, ofcourse, did agents. 
It all came to a shuttering stop. They put the guitars away, and the fiesta was over when it was contract time. But Fernando was coming to the table with no cards and a few chips. He was sitting there staring in­to a hand behind a stack ofchips and a player with a .45 in his belt and a strap ofcartridges across his chest. 
It had all come too soon to Fer­nando. He had none of the defenses so painstakingly won by the un­signed ballplayers over the last-

decade. He was not yet eligible for free agentry, he was not even eligible for arbitration. He had two choices Mexico or the big leagues. 
He had one ace -public support. The public loved Fernando, didn't they?· The Dodgers would be betray­ing every Latino fon on the con­tinent ifthey didn't sighn him, right? 
Well, as recently as two years ago, that might have been so. After all, the public watched with contented tolerance as slightly above-average ballplayers signed contracts for $23 million for I 0 years, and as teams like the Dodgers paid millions for 
failed ·pitchers they had to turn loose.

But, times were different, then. The assembly plants were open, 
mortages were available. Even the support of the barrios was not forthcoming this time. The media 
fell strangely silent, those tradition­ally anti-owner and those tradition­ally pro-owner uneasy about this one. Fernando will doubtless sign. 
But, even if it's for half of what he asks, in a year when Ford loses a bil­lion dollars, the man thinks he

lliyle sets school record in F1orida decathalon 
By EARLRIX 
Sfmrts lf'rlter 
The Irish Jailed to get to the tlnals of any event at tho: !'JCAA champion­ships in Detroit, hut Paul Doyle erased some of the disappointment la.~t weekend when he handily won the decathalon and placed third in the pole vault at the Domino Pizza Relay~ in Florida. 
Doyle accumulated 7,774 points in the ten-event decathalon. In doin~ so he exceeded his previous personal best, heat Don Esler's 19 32 lri1>h record by more than 1,000 points, a.nd easily qualified for the NCAA outdoor national champion­ships. 
Doyle: bested a tlcld of 24 decat­haletes that included Frank Harrison a.nd Greg Bastine, among others. Head Coach Joe Piane called it a "superb performance" and said that the 7,774 point total put Doyle in the "top ten if not in the top five in the country at this point." 
The senior tri-captain covered the 100 meters in I0.8 seconds, long­jumped 23-4, put the shot 44 feet, high-jumped 6-l, and ran the 400 meters in 49.6 on tht· first day ofthe two-day event. On the second day he ran the I l 0-meter high hurdles in l S.9, threw the discus 142 feet, pole vaulted 15-8, tO~sed the javelin 197

North Carolina coach 

Smithhopes to endlongdryspell 
By The Associated Press 
Pardon North Carolina basketball 
Coach Dean Smith if he's starting to 
get the Minnesota Vikings 
syndrome. 
Like the Vikings, who have gone 
to four Super Bowls and lost every 
one, Smith's Tar Heels have been to 
the NCAA Final Four six times and 
have yet to win the national cham­
pionship. just la.st year they got to 
the la.st game before losing to In­
diana 63-50. 
Will seven be a lucky number for Smith, whose team goes to New Or­leans with a 30-2 record and the No.I ranking? His players certainly hope so. 
"1 think he's the greatest coach in college basketball, despite not having won the national champion­ship," said james Worthy, who scored 14 points in helping the Tar Heels win the Eastern Regional final, 70-60 over Villanova. 
"Everybody says Coach Smith is a great coach," said Tar Heel Jimmy Black. "But then they say he chokes in the Final Four. 1 know he's tired of hearing it and I know I'm tired of hearing it. And we're going to change it." 
Center Sam Perkins said he'd like to win it all "just so people would stop asking that question." 
Smith, whose team will fuce darkhorsc Houston in the semifinals 
vault the following day with an Irish outdoor record vault of 16-6. Doyle will get a chance to improve on his decathalon reord twice more this year, at the Drake relays and again at the NCAA's. In the meantime, be­tween Piane says that he will keep Doyle busy competing in the vault, long jump, high-hurdles, and weight events.

Saturday, takes a more philosophical approach. 
"I'll settle for this every year," he said of making the Final Four. "I feel like we deserve to be there." 
If North Carolina gets by ~· :dwest Region winner Houston, iS ex­pected, the going will get much tougher in the championslup game next Monday night, when · he op­ponent will be the winner of Satur­day's other semifinal !:·tween Louisville and Georgetown 
Louisville, with four star off its 1980 NCAA championship n, ha.' won 11 of its la.st 12 game~ ..nclud-. ing a 75-68 victory over Alabama-Birmingham in the Mideast tlnal. 
The 20th-ranked Cardinals were only 12-8 at one point in the season, when Coach Denny Crum was ex­perimenting with a lot of players. But there was method in his action as he built up the depth of his team to championship levels. 
"We were developing our bench while playing one of the toughest schedules in the country," he said. "We decided we had to get ex­perience from our bench. Our seniors were a.sked to sacrifice so the younger players could get that experience. 
"Many seniors might resent that, 
.,.

but our players are for the team," said Crum. "This is a team and has to win that way without an All­American." 
The Cardinals are now 23-9, and their depth wa.s apparent la.st Satur­day, when reserve center Charles )ones came offthe bench to score 19 points, including seven free throws in the last 2:31. 
Sixth-ranked Georgetown goes to the four-way showdown after demolishing No.4 Oregon State 69­54 to win the"West Regional. The Hoyas, 29-6, broke the NCAA tour­ney record for shooting accuracy with an incredible 76.3 percent from the floor.

Valenzuela reports to Florida Dodger camp 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -Fernando Valenzuela, the 21-year old Mexican-born left-bander who won the National League's Cy Young Award last season, has ended the holdout he staged against the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
The pitcher announced yesterday that he will report today to the Dodgers' spring training camp in Vera Beach, Fla. But Valenzuela says he won't sign a contract. He even turned down a last-minute offer of more money through an incentive clause. 
"Yes, we made them a new offer," Dodger owner Peter O'Malley told reporters at a Vero Beach, Fla. press 
· conference. "Why they turned it down, I don't know. The last offer was significant. It had substantial in· centive clauses. "We made several calls. We made every attempt possible to resolve the matter;" O'Malley said. "I'm as puzzled today as I was a week ago, a month ago, two weeks ago. There is no bitterness or bad feelings on our part." Valenzuela's attorney, however, said that the offer was nothing big. Dick Moss described it as "a little bone, a couple of little performance clauses." The club, however, says it has not closed the door to the possibility of later raising Valenzuela's salary. Even without his signature on a contract, Valenzuela will collect the reported S350,000 offered by the Dodgers compared with his S42,500 salary of last year when he won the National League's Cy Young Award as its best pitcher and the Rookie of the Year Award. He was the first player to win both in the same year.

"I have decided to report to the Los Angeles Dodgers in Vero Beach," Valenzuela said through an interpreter. "I will be doing so be­cause ofwhat I believe to be my duty to my family, to my teammates, to my friends and to myself. I am not reporting to sign a contract." 
Valenzuela added that he did not believe his teammates would criticize him for the holdout. But he came under severe criticism from the Mexican-Americans in Los An· geles for his demands of S 1 million and later ,S850,000 for the season. 
"My representatives and I have never had any real negotiations with the Dodgers," Valenzuela's prepared statement said. "There have been meetings but the only negotiations have come from us." 
The Dodgers have maintained that no second-year player has earned more than the figure they of­fered Valenzuela. ·
