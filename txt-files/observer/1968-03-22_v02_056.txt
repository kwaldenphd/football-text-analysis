Mock Minority Plank Bid Fails, ByfO~,~vention Sees NLF As Separate 
The anticipated battle between the moderates and the anti-war liberals crys­tallized unexpectedly early in a floor fight over a Rules Committee proposal in the second session of the Mock Political Convention Wed. night. The rule in ques­tion required that 667 votes be cast, a majority of the 1333 delegates, to nomi­nate both the Presidential and Vice Presi­dential candidates, regardless of the total number of delegates present. 
The controversy arose when Garrett Olney, Chairman of the Rules Committee, submitted the rules agreed upon by his committee to the convention. Potentially explosive rules included among them were provisions permitting a delegate from any delegation to call for a polling of any other delegation during a roll call vote and that debate may be limited only by a two-thirds vote of the convention. 
After Colorado delegate Jay Lowery's · amendment permitting "friendly" amend­ments was approved, Bob Heineman of grounds that it limits the number of candidateS-who can run on it. He said, "It violates American ideals and Repub­

lican policies." Dan Lungren of Califor­nia added that the minority report was more flexible, enabling more to run. 
Colorado's Jay Lowery opposed the amendment claiming that the NLF in fact had different goals than the North Vietnamese government since it desires two Vietnams. Five other minor amend­ments were considered, three passing and two failing. 
Governor John A. Volpe ofMassachu­
setts told the convention that young 
people should become involved with their 
country and not "drop out." Speaking 
of changing the horse in midstream, Volpe 
said, ''The sorry steed we ride now is bog­
ged down and may never make it to the 
other side."

Now It's As Uptight As It Can Be 


By DENNIS GALLAGHER 
This is the third in a three part series on Detroit six months after. 
The sky is cold and lifeless. The sun is shining, a 
dead yellow reflecting the rubble that the snows have behind. Winter is almost over and soon spring come to Detroit. The brown grass gives that 
promise as it takes on a pale greenish color. And after spring, there will be summer. Why did black Detroit riot last summer? "A lot of it was sheerest accident," says Bill Standing, "There was no rain for the last seven or eight days of July.

WCO, but Standing says he simply lost interest in teaching about urban problems once he began to be directly involved in trying to solve them. 
In an upper middle class Negro bar in the midst of a black neighborhood, a very good jazz combo is playing. One of the patrons is a well-dressed man of about thirty who works as a serviceman for the elec­tric company. "Sure, there's segregation in Detroit," he says, "You don't feel it so much when you're growing up. I went to an all-black high scliool, ran track, played basketball and I never felt it. But the people feel it when they try to get jobs. They either get no job or a bad job. Then they get mad." 
"The riot last summer never really stopped," says Bill Standing, "There's a fire bombing every two or three days. Negroes are shot down on the streets. Meanwhile, there's no police commissioner and no papers (Detroit's newspapers have been shut down by a Teamsters' strike for several months), and this lets the cops go wild." 
Detroit's white radicals fear that another riot in Detroit may lead to massive retaliation from the white Establishment. Frank Joyce, head of PAR (People Against Racism) notes that the state legis­lature has passed close to I 00 anti-riot bills. He doesn't foresee any peaceful solutions. "I'm just fighting for time," Joyce says. The whites will organ­ize tor genocide, but the blacks won't go as easily as the Jews in Germany. We;ve got to convince the white community that the price they'll have to pay is too high." 
Bill Standing is more optimistic, less committed the middle of the riot areas. Now, the good burghers have their own weapons, their own gun clubs, and wait and watch as the rumors about 'them' sweep up from the heart of the citv. 
In the heart of the city, a white man learns to be self-conscious, aware of his color the way a Negro always must be. In a store, a tall, massive white man goes up to the counter to pay for his six-pack of beer. 
A boy of fifteen, slender and a foot shorter, bumps 
into him hard. The man looks around, surveying the 
sea of black faces and the boy's dark, opaque eyes. 
"Sorry," the man mumbles, and moves cautiously 
to the door. 

The time for buying their friendship is over. "Material projects are not likely to make ghetto life better," says Bill Standing, "Just jobs and housing alone without self-determination will not cut it." "We must keep Malcolm X alive in our hearts," say Rev. Albert Cleage and his Federation for Self­Determination, "because he taught us to believe in 
identification with Africa, racial pride, self-defense, Black Power, control 0f our own communities!!" 
And the few remaining patches of dirty snow are melting, and the sun turns t11e mud on the sidewalks to gray dust. The children play and fight as they run from school to home. And t_hey tap their fists at the boarded windows of the empty shops as they run by. And slowly, yet inexorably, summer is returning to Detroit. 


Statement Guarantees Rights 
St. Mary's Student Govern­ment has submitted a proposed "Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities" to the stu­dent body for suggestion. The statement was prepared by a Student Rights Working Board composed of students, faculty members, and administrators.

The statement guarantees stu­dents their personal, social, and academic rights as well as Stu­dent Government rights and the rights of due process. The pre­face to the statement points out: "It must be emphasized and fully accepted by those con­cerned, that with any right there is a correlative responsibility." 
The section on personal rights 
guarantees that "Each student as a citizen, has the right to freedom of speech, peaceful as­sembly, and rights of petition. They also possess the same civic and legal rights and responsi­bilities."

ed. Student Government leaders believe that implementation will be the test of the worth of the statement. Ifit cannot be applied as a basis for using student opin­ion to bring about change it will be little better than the "Grant of Responsibilities" which Stu­dent Government has been work­ing under for the past two years. Kathy Lammers, Junior Class President and a member of the Working Board, feels that the 
statement "depends on how it is 
interpreted. The board is putting 
a lot of faith in the system." 

Members of the administration 
and faculty held an advisory pos­
ition on the working board be­
cause the student statement is a 
"community project". Lammers 
said that "the role of a student 
can't be determined without con­
sidering the individual roles of 
faculty and administration. But 
the students have the largest 
say."

Dennis Gallagher If We Went All Out 
Today is January 15th, 1971. I'm Chet David and here's the news. 
Skirmishing continued today between Cuban Communists and state militia on the streets of Miami. In Washington, President Johnson reaffirmed his moral commitment to what he called, "the brave and heroic struggle that the Flori­dans have waged against unequal odds. I only wish that there was something .,,e could do to aid them in their struggle." Premier Fidel Castro of Cuba predicted that his forces would crush remaining opposition within the week. "We're going to miss Miami Beach," said Secretary of State Dean Rusk, "But security priorities must come first." 
General Westmoreland today appealed to Congress for more troops to press vigorously the Vietnam offensive. If his demand for two hundred thousand more troops is met, it will raise the total num­ber of U.S. troops in Vietnam to thirty­four million. Westmoreland added, "Those 
who oppose our actions are giving aid and comfort to the enemy. We could win this war in a month if only we would go all 
out." 
In other Vietnam news, Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker today indicated his belief that the fighting was nearly over. Speaking from the super-secure Saigon embassy (now located in Abilene, Kan­sas), Bunker said that the recent Viet Cong offensive was a failure despite territorial gains. "Our figures show that two hundred million Viet Conghave been killed since the war began." Bunker said. "Either they are just 
lt~~rt"J about out of men or they've found some way of creat-. ing life from river mud, because God knows that's the only raw material left in Vietnam." 
Vice-President Hubert Humphrey was formally committed today to the Massachusetts State Home for the Bewildered. In his last public ap­pearance on Dec. 15, Mr. Humphrey 
re-iterated his support of Mr. Johnson's Asian policy, Mr. Johnson's civil rights policy, Mr. Johnson's fiscal policy and Mr. Johnson's life insurance policy. To­wards the end of his speech, Mr. Humph­rey unaccountably began screaming, over and over again, "HUBERT WANT A CRACKER! HUBERT WANT A CRACK­ER!" 
The House Appropriations Commit­tee called today for cuts in the anti-pov­erty budget. Mr. Johnson has asked for $15.42. The committee would like to cut it to $6.50. 
Former Vice-President Richard Nixon announced today that he will be a can­didate for the Presidency in 1972. Nixon narrowly lost in 1968 on his vigorous campaign based on the slogan: "I can win the war, end poverty, stop violence, and do other fine things." Nixon revealed that his 1972 campaign will be based on a far more radical Vietnam stand. "I think the war in Asia might be un­wise," Nixon said, "I think a re-evalua­tion of the present policy might be in order, and after I'm elected President, I'm really going to study the problem and maybe drop a few less bombs. Or a few more." 
Meanwhile, nine million youthful dem­onstrators massed outside the Pentagon to protest the Vietnamese war. Pres. 
'Johnson said, "These few dissonant rad­icals do not represent the youth of America." The demonstrators were not admitted to the Pentagon building itself, so they surrounded the building and picked it up. At last report, the Pentagon 
'was moving at about two miles an hour down Highway 51.

What Then? 


Tonight the 1968 Republican Mock Political Convention will choose a presi­dential candidate. We will be presented with the opportunity to voice our con­cern for the United States and her pre­sent policies. The word "mock" is utterly misleading. Sure we will have our fun shouting, debating and making like ora­torical geniuses, but our decision is a ser­ious one. We are not voting for fun. We are voting a political alternative to the present national course. 
For the young collegian, today is not a happy time. About our neck hangs a bloody albatross. Vietnam pervades each of our con­ventions. Vietnam affects our every decision. Words · are flowing freely, feeding the ever-increasing sea of conversation. But we are in danger of dy­ing from thirst. The cool, refreshing spring of action is waiting to be tapped. Tonight we must begin. Tonight we must nominate Mark Hatfield. 
What then? We begin to move. We be-
There is always something especially exciting about student conventions of any sort. Young people are usually more open to argument and interaction than their elders. Unfortunately, this pattern will probably hold true in comparing the Notre Dame and Miami versions of the 1968 Republican Convention. Hence, I felt somewhat regretful entering Stepan Center for the first night of the conven­tion. The misplacing of our Marco Polo student body president had altered my destiny towards the National Catholic College Conference in New York instead of politicing for John Lindsay at the Notre Dame's Cow Palace. 
Yet before leaving, the urge to hear my old debate partner, Jeff Keyes, took me for a last sitting to the Pennsylvania dele­gation standard. Any veteran of his mes­merizing rhetoric would have predicted that the assembled would-be kingmakers would hear a brilliant spe­ech assaulting the crises of Vietnam, our cities, and our political leadership. And he did not fall short of his verbal napalming of the White House. 
It was only then that I hesitated to leave for the unmanageable city that John Lindsay was struggling to govern in the face of a losing cause because of the perverted political 
priorities of a Texas cowboy who had at­tempted to swim through quicksand and was now pulling in his countrymen to save him.
Last fall 1had unenthusiastically taken up the John Lindsay campaign with the 
intent that his strong views against the war in Vietnam and for shifting political Priorities to the cities and poor might be considered. It has always been obvious that Lindsay would have little chance of winning here. Rockefeller is the man that most of the large middle will vote for. He has that acceptable image as a nice, ex­perienced liberal who is concerned about 
all the problems -but not concerned enough to take positions proposing any-Eugene McCarthy and Robert Kennedy. Those who criticize Kennedy's entrance into the race have overlooked two impor­tant factors. First, the object of the Democratic alternative movement is to unseat Lyndon Johnson and then win the presidency. Robert Kennedy can accom­plish this. Eugene McCarthy cannot. Sec­ondly, if Eugene McCarthy was a sacri­ficial lamb, why hasn't he stepped aside? Is it possible that he has been affected by the "drive for power" that we so readily attributed to Kennedy? Has this lonely and altruistic battler now tasted the sweet victory of primary success, envisioning the ultimate power of the presidency? And if he did enter the race to protest the war, why doesn't he step aside for the admittedly stronger Kennedy candidacy? The danger is that Lyndon Johnson will stroll between a divided peace movement and America will be faced with a choice (?) between Johnson 
and Nixon. This problem has to be resolv­ed before the convention, not after. 
I criticized Kennedy for not coming out for McCarthy, for not running him­self, and for general lack of action in re­

He is in the arena and it is unlimited energy and potential that we not valid to attempt to destroy him sim­possess must be applied and those of us ply because he was second.

Yet This Same RFK 

Question of the week: Where was RFK when we needed him? 
On November 30, 1967, Senator Eug­ene McCarthy outlined for the nation his previously acknowledged concern with regard to the administration's present and projected Vietnam war policies and announced his intention to challenge President Lyndon Baines Johnson in the Democratic primaries of four states. 
As late as January 30, 1968, Senator Robert F. Kennedy stated, "I have told friends and supporters who are urging me to run that I would not oppose Lyndon Johnson under any forseeable circumstan­ces." 
"Forseeable circumstan­

ces" obviously did not in­clude McCarthy's success in the New Hampshire primaries. 
While McCarthy was delineating his dissatisfactiqn with the administration's handling of the nation's foreign and do­

politician. Older party politicians have 
always considered him a little bit too 
pushy on civil rights, civil liberties, wei­fare reorganization, and Vietnam. And the emerging talk of his national possibilities has sunken into the quagmire of govern­ing New York City. 
Yet after studying Lindsay's record and ideals, I began to realize that he, in fact, is exactly the kind of man that this coun­try needs and the type of political leader Jeff Keyes exhorted us to nominate. This country has been too long plagued with 
the same tired old men leading the wings of its political parties -men who have turned their faces to so many sides of so many issues, and who refuse to commit themselves on any degree such that even intelligent people can understand what they mean, that the whole country has borne the suffering of their inability to redirect our politics. 
But the murmurings of our discontent have given rise to the courage and vision of men such as Lindsay, Kennedy, Hat­field, and McCarthy. They are men of the nation and appropriate for the season. And if we fail to support them, we de­the primaries. Kennedy even went so far as to state that he would support Presi­dent Johnson's bid for the Democratic nomination. 
RFK indicated that he was fearful of provoking a split within the Democratic party, that he was hesitant to make a move that could be interpreted as part of an alleged vendetta against the man who had succeeded his brother to the Presi­dency. 
Yet this same RFK announced his can­didacy last Saturday with the statement the he was running because he was "con­vinced that this country was on a perilous course and because [he had] such strong feelings about what must be done that [he was] going to do all [he] can." The "disastrous, divisive" policies of the ad­ministration could be changed only by opposing President Johnson. 
Noble sentiments, these. 
Yet one can not help but point out that the country's "perilous course" had been charted by "disastrous and divisive" policies long before McCarthy's gains in New Hampshire indicated that President Johnson could be challenged successfully. 

serve to sink slowly with the likes of Lyn-Whery were RFK's "strong feelings" ear-
don Johnson. And so I go to New York hopeful that the Notre Dame community will not let down those that look to us for a new vi­sion of politics, and that the remaining 
Hatfield and Lindsay people will work to ensure that result. And I depart remem­bering a meeting at the NSA congress last August that generated the leadership of 
the students' crusade that won in New H h. d h · h d

lier? For that matter, where was RFK? McCarthy should be commended as a man of principle for political courage in carrying out his convictions while others checked to see if the winds would be fa­
vorable to their own political careers. How ironic that McCarthy seems to have come closest to John F. Kennedy's ideai of statesmanship as set forth in his Pro­files in Courage than the man who is so 
closely imitating his brother's very man­
nerisms.

Our series idea seems to be popular, our columnists have been able to stir up campus opinion, and, above all, our news has been just that: news. The Observer has been believable this year." 
Luking said that "In my opin­ion, one of Collin's best ideas was the columnist idea." Luking plans to run weekly columns by 
Don Hynes, Michael O'Connor, and St. Mary's junior Betty Do­err. Joel Connelly will continue as both a columnist and as exec­utive editor. Guy De Sapio, a freshman, will become news edi­tor and the position of managing editor will be held by Paul Sch­roeder.

Luking said that other ideas include expansion to national news coverage, something which "can be done if we're able to go daily," through a UP! or AP trunkline. "Ultimately," he said, "the Observer can be as good as the students want it to be." 
Outgoing editor Collins credi­ted his staff with much of the Observer's success. "For exam­ple," he said, "Tom Figel did a good job, I think, of keeping the Vietnam issue under con­sideration on this campus. And. Condon and Gallagher have been superb." 
"When it comes right down to it," Collins said, "I think the paper's been damned good and anyone who says otherwise has­n't been reading it."
