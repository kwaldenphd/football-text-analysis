Men to box in Bouts for Bangladesh 

By MEG HAN WONS News Writer 
The tradition of strong bod­ies fighting "that weak bodies may be nourished" continues tonight with the first punches thrown in Notre Dame's famous Bengal Bouts. 
"Guys who are fighting tomorrow want to come in to work up a little bit of a sweat," senior captain and Notre Dame Boxing Club president Andrew McGill said at an informal practice Tuesday. 
Working up a little sweat is well worth the nearly $80,000 the more than 200 men -a record number -hope to donate to the Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh this

Donnelly shares vie-ws on election, Congress 
By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 
For Democratic Congressman Joseph Donnelly, representing the citizens of Indiana's 2nd District is "the privilege of a life­time." 
Speaking to professor Robert Schmuhl's American Political Life class Tuesday, Donnelly highlighted his experiences blazing the campaign trail to his recent election as congressman, beating out incumbent Republican Chris Chocola. 
But since taking office, Donnelly's focus has shifted from gaining votes to giving his vote. He recently backed the non-binding resolution that the House of Representatives passed in opposition to President Bush's plan to deploy additional troops in Iraq. 
Donnelly said he gave a lot of thought to the decision by talk­ing to war veterans, meeting with the Michiana Peace and Justice Coalition and attending a White House briefing on the war in Iraq. 
"At some point the Iraqis have to stand up ... and decide that they don't want any more death and destruction. There is a solu­tion to Iraq -it will be tricky to get there," Donnelly said. "The Iraqis have to want their coun­try to succeed." 
And one thing that helps Donnelly succeed is Notre Dame, his alma mater.

University prepares for Lent -with Masses 
By JOHN-PAUL WITT 
News Writer 
Tuesday's Mardi Gras festiv­ities will die down today as the campus welcomes the solemnity of Ash Wednesday, the first day of the season of Lent. For Notre Dame's Catholic students, this her­alds a time of penance and reflection, preparing the University community to cele­brate the Easter season. 
Today many students, like senior Terence Merritt, choose to attend Mass and receive ashes on their fore­head with their closest friends -members of their dorms. 
'Til go to Mass in Siegfried because I enjoy celebrating my faith in community with my friends," Merritt-said. 
Members of Notre Dame's Protestant and non-Christian communities are also wel­come to participate in the Lenten season and to attend services in community with Catholic students. 
"Although I'm not Catholic, I'll attend dorm Mass on Ash Wednesday so I can be in community with my brothers in the dorm," sophomore Jonathan Poelhuis said. 
However, students like jun­ior Mike Kasalo find the University's focus on Lent, and the signs posted in dorms reminding students that today is a "day of fasting and absti­nence," unnecessary. 
"I plan to skip Mass and go out drinking," Kasalo said. "I

At practice Tuesday after­noon, the steady beat of songs like "Air Force One" echoed the sounds of fists hitting the punching bags. The boxers rotated in and out of a practice ring, some jumping rope while others hit the floor for pushups and sit ups.

NDASK applauds report 
By KAITLYNN RIELY 
Assistant News Editor 
The American Bar Association's (ABA) release of a report calling for Indiana to impose a moratorium on execu­tions less than six months after the creation of Notre Dame Against State Killing (NDASK) might be "divine providence," said co-organizer Will McAuliffe. 
The student group formed last fall to impose a moratorium on the death penalty in Indiana ­and on Tuesday it came a step closer to that goal. The ABA released its report urging the state to halt executions until changes can be made to improve the administration of death penalty cases. 
McAuliffe, who is also an Observer columnist, called the findings of the report a "step­ping stone" to ending use of the death penalty. 
The Indiana Death Penalty Assessment Team, a panel working under the guidance of the ABA, reviewed Indiana's death penalty system for nearly two years. Indiana is the fifth state to be assessed under ABA's Death Penalty Moratorium Implementation Project.

QUESTION OF THE DAY: WHAT ARE YOU GIVING UP FOR LENT?
INSIDE COLUMN 

On Lent and Britney's sons 
Lent starts today, and that's fantastic. Lent marks the end of the ordinary time and sets the stage for Holy Week. Lent reminds us of Christ's ability to resist temptation in the desert. Lent encourages us to follow His lead and be resolute in Marcela our faith and our Berrios commitment to righteousness. Lent

is important. Lent is 

News Editor 
sublime. Lent is my great failure as a Catholic. 

Yes, my friends and readers, I admit in public in my 21 years on this planet I have never given up anything for Lent­and what's even worse, I'm not freaking out about it. 
Maybe I'm just telling myself what I want to hear, but I think I really do believe there have to be better ways to prove my devotion than renouncing candy, booze or Facebook. 
As a mere formality, though, every year I have vowed to give something up only to break my promise within the first week. One year it was Coke, another one it was anything that had chocolate in it and my freshman year here it was Facebook ­and keep in mind this was Facebook before you could create albums. IfI tried that little stunt today, I doubt I would make it through Ash Wednesday Mass before checking who's on my "Recently Updated" profiles list. 
A friend who shall remained anony­mous tried giving up sex with her boyfriend one year -but they indulged on Sundays since technically they're not included in the 40-day count. They really indulged on Sundays. It was everything but sublime. 
At any rate, I don't think I've learned much from my attempts to give up any­thing, and my faith certainly didn't grow from hearing my friend's stories every Monday. I really don't see how I will become a better Catholic these days ifone day I do succeed in renouncing something I like. 
The closest I came was the year I tried giving up on chocolate bars -although not chocolate cookies or chocolate cake or hot chocolate. But then I realized my new motivation to stay away from the candy was the realization that I was los­ing weight, so I broke my promise because I didn't think it was true to the Lenten purpose anymore anyway-and because I went to the movies and I felt like eating some Reese's instead of pop­corn. 
Call me weak ifyou want. Call me cyni­cal even, because I do think Christ has more important things to deal with than my snack selection. There are wars rag­ing and hungry children and neglected old people and a bald Britney Spears in this world-and I think our mission as Catholics is to help them. So let me just throw this out there. This Lenten season, do something nice for someone, and ifit's somebody you don't like, even better. That's way more Christian than treating sweets and Facebook like they're the anti-Christ. Ask the ugly girl out to the SYR or look into adopting the Spears­Federline boys. Spread the love. That's what Jesus would do.

Neb. woman accused of window smashing 
LINCOLN, Neb.-Lincoln police said a 50-year-old woman was charged Tuesday with child abuse and criminal mischief after having her 12-year-old granddaughter drive her to her niece's house, where the grandma broke five windows. 
A neighbor told police that Vickie Britton picked up a chair from the front yard of a duplex Monday night and used it to smash five windows, causing about $400 in damage, said Lincoln Police spokes­woman Katherine Finnell. 
Finnell said police arrest­ed Britton when she came back to the neighborhood more than an hour later. Police found Britton drunk and belligerent in the ear with the 12-year-old behind the wheel, Finnell said. . 
Police have referred the granddaughter to the Lancaster County Attorney's office to deter­mine whether any juvenile charges will bo l'iled for driving without a license. 
Man sues IBM over adult chat room firing 
WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.-A man who was fired by IBM for visiting an adult chat room at work is suing the company for $5 million, claiming he is an Internet addict who deserves treat­ment and sympathy rather than dismissal. 
James Pacenza, 58, of Montgomery, says he visits chat rooms to treat trau­matic stress incurred in 1969 when he saw his best friend killed during an Army patrol in Vietnam. 
In papers filed in federal court in White Plains, Pacenza said the stress caused him to become "a sex addict, and with the development of the Internet, an Internet addict." lie claimed protec­tion under the American with Disabilities Act.

The IRHO is com­prised of 12 Indiana colleges and helps facilitate the communica­tion of ideas between schools around the state. · 
Saint Mary's was the only school to apply for the award this year, but all 12 IRHO schools were eligible to apply. 
"They only give [awards] to schools that deserve them," Dardinger said. "If only one school applies and they don't deserve it [or they get disqualified for not following the rules of the organization] they just won't hand it out that year." 
The award, while given out by an organization that Saint Mary's RHA works with, is not limited to recognizing those on RHA, Dardinger said. 
"It compliments all Saint Mary's students because it shows how well the Saint Mary's community works together," she said. "[RI-IA] is successful because students want to participate."

While many students were not aware of the award on Tuesday, they were excited to hear the good news. 
"That's really cool," sophomore Angela Siler said. "I feel that we deserved the recognition, and I'm glad that they saw fit to give it to us."

SMC to drop landlines 
Students to rely on cell phones, calling cards, officials say

The College will also offer long distance phone cards in the campus bookstore and will work with service providers to ensure excel­lent reception throughout campus. 
For other students with cell phones, the number will be required to be regis­tered with the College. 
McDonald said she has not yet received any com­plaints about the switch and emphasized that the decision was made based on student behavior. 
"The impact will be mini­mal -if it was going to be a big impact that would affect the students nega­tively then the College wouldn't make the deci­sion," McDonald said.

NDASK 
continued from page 1 
Broden, D-South Bend -listed 12 changes Indiana should make to its death penalty sys­tem to make it fair and accu­rate. 
The changes, which NDASK endorsed, included requiring law enforcement agencies to ·record all interrogations, ban­ning the execution of defendants with severe mental illnesses and requiring that biological evi­dence is preserved the entire time the defendant is impris­oned. 
NDASK co-organizer Andrea Laidman said the debate about the use of death penalty is just starting to take place nationally and is now taking root in the Midwest, specifically Indiana. 
"I think the reason that we started NDASK was because no one was talking about the issue on campus and across the state as a whole," Laidman said. 
But with the speaker series NDASK sponsored in the fall ­which included Kernan and Broden -and now with the release of this report, Laidman and McAuliffe hope people will start talking about the death penalty. 
"I think one of the biggest things to come out of this is it adds a lot to the discussion in terms or resources, in terms of numbers and in terms of policy recommendation," McAuliffe 
Donnelly

follows is not about politics or campaigning or voting -it's "God. Country. Notre Dame," he said. 
After graduating from the University in 1977 with a bache­lor's degree in government and then from the Law School in 1981, Donnelly said he never planned on a career in politics. 
"I helped on various cam­paigns at different times and had not envisioned running for the U.S. House," he said. 
But once he decided to run, Donnelly took a "grassroots" approach to his campaign, meaning he put a lot of attention into securing votes from people in his district -something he did by meeting as many 2nd District citizens as possible. 
"It was about looking people in the eye and asking them for their vote," he said. 
But one area that was not so fun for Donnelly was raising finances, which is a huge focus in running for political office. 
"The money involved in cam­paign finance is destroying this country. My best re-election technique is to do my job right," he said. 
And his job is one he fought hard for. In what he called a "grueling endeavor," Donnelly worked from 6 a.m. to midnight, six to seven days a week up until the last possible moment in the election. 
"The polls closed at six o'clo~k ... and I stayed until 6:30 p.m. shaking people's hands because I didn't want to think later that I should have worked harder," Donnelly said. "Don't ever underestimate persistence." 
While persistence may have been one factor contributing to Donnelly's election, he noted the change in "political climate" as another. 
He said many Republicans in Indiana were unhappy with the war in Iraq during his cam-said. "Now there's this one big, overarching resource of over 300 pages for people in the state of Indiana to use in discussion." 
But the ABA report is only a recommendation, not an actual policy. The next step in the process, McAuliffe said, is either for Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels to order a moratorium or for the legislature to pass one. 
A recent statewide survey con­ducted for the ABA makes those two options seem hopeful, McAuliffe said. The survey showed a majority of voters favor a temporary halt to execu­tions in Indiana while the sys­tem is studied. 
"When you have 61 percent of people supporting a moratorium like that -it's a very political topic," he said. 
And so it makes sense for the governor or the legislature to impose a moratorium, McAulifTe said, since a clear majority backs it. 
"Worst case scenario -for us at least -is after two years of looking at it, they say well, actu­ally it does work and here's why ... and then they resume the death penalty," he said. 
But McAulifTe said he is confi­dent that once people study death penalty cases in which mistakes have been made, they will oppose it. Americans don't want a judicial system that puts people to death unfairly, he said. 
"We think that people who take a step back ... and aren't under the ticking clock a "specif­ic case provides, are able to 
paign. Another help, he said, was the string of negative cam­paign commercials started by Chocola actually proved helpful to Donnelly's campaign. 
"Those commercials got peo­ple to recognize me. In a strange way [Chocola'sl com­mercials were helping my cam­paign -he was spending money on commercials that were help­ing me," Donnelly said. 
On election day, after all the work, Donnelly defeated his opponent by just eight points. Now that he's an insider, Donnelly said he's learned most people in Congress are just "try­ing to help their constituents and their country." 
"The great thing about Washington is that there are about twenty crazy people on the Republican and Democratic sides, and the other ... people are just trying to work together to get things done," Donnelly said. 
Though the media often focus­es on "the loudest people in Congress," Donnelly said there are many people "in the middle" working hard every day who are not portrayed nearly as often. 
Whether or not he is in the spotlight, Donnelly said he believes in a moderate national budget and strong defense as part of the "Blue Dog Democrats" group, a moderate to conservative group of Democrats in Congress. 
Donnelly works on· three dif­ferent committees in Congress addressing financial services, veterans' afTairs and agricultur­al issues. 
But sticking to his Indiana roots, Donnelly is also working on a farming bill -nearly SO percent of his district, after all, is agricultural land. 
"We're working elosely with farmers on a riew farm bill to make sure that it works for farmers in the Midwest," he said.

Iran willing to negotiate on nukes 
VIENNA, Austria -Iran's chief nuclear envoy 
 said Tuesday his country wants to negotiate over its uranium enrichment program, on the eve of a 
U.N. Security Council deadline that carries the threat of harsher sanctions. But the country's hard-line president said Iran will halt enrich­ment only ifWestern nations do the same. 
Sanctions could be triggered by a report from Mohamed El Baradei, the head of the Vienna­based International Atomic Energy Agency, to his agency's 35 board-member nations, expect­ed Wednesday. That report is expected to say Iran has expanded emichment ac~ivities instead of freezing them. 
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, speaking to a crowd of thousands in Iran, said his country was ready to stop its emichment program, but only if Western nations do the same -some­thing the United States and others with similar programs are unlikely to even consider.

New Orleans celebrates Mardi Gras 
NEW ORLEANS -Thousands of hurricane­weary residents joined with rowdy visitors for Fat Tuesday, taking a break from rebuilding New Orleans to put on wild costumes and cele­brate the second Mardi Gras since Katrina.

"I work all day at my job, then I work all night and all weekend on my house. I just want to eat, drink and have fun today," Ferguson said. 
Many spectators spent the day along the parade routes or in the French Quarter, where the first Mardi Gras parade of the day was staged by the 1,250-member Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club, a predominantly black group that wears grass skirts and blackface makeup in par­ody of stereotypes from the early 1900s, when it was founded.

Guantanamo detainees can't file suit 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -In a victory for President Bush, a divided federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that Guantanamo Bay detainees cannot use the U.S. court system to challenge their indefinite imprisonment. A Supreme Court appeal was promised. 
The 2-1 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit dis­misses hundreds of cases filed by for­eign-born detainees in federal court and also threatens to strip away court access to millions of lawful perma­nent residents currently in the United States. 
It upholds a key provision of the Military Commissions Act, which Bush pushed through Congress last year to set up a Defense Department system to prosecute terrorism sus­pects. Now, detainees must prove to three-officer military panels that they don't pose a terror threat. 
Democrats newly in charge of Congress promised legislation aimed at giving detainees legal rights. Attorneys for detainees said they would appeal Tuesday's ruling to the Supreme Court. 
"We're disappointed," said Shayana Kadidal of the Center for Constitutional Rights. "The bottom line is that according to two of the federal judges, the president can do whatever he wants without any legal limitations as long as he does it off­shore." 
The two judges voting with the White House -Judge A. Raymond Randolph and Judge David B. Sentelle -were appointed by Republicans. Reagan appointed Sentelle, and the first President Bush appointed Randolph. The dissenter, Judge Judith W. Rogers, was appointed by Clinton. 
White House deputy press secretary Dana Perino called the decision "a significant win" for the administration and said the Military Commissions Act provides "sufficient and fair access to courts for these detainees."

"I feel like I'm pretty ready; I · feel like I've prepared myself as well as I could have," Barbera said. "I wrestled in high school and it's a lot like wrestling­you push yourself in boxing and wrestling more than any other sport I've every played." 
Such "pushing" began at Notre Dame in 1920, when box­ing was nrst brought to the University by legendary football coach Knute Hockne, aceording to the Bengal Bouts Web site. Bengal Bouts was not estab­lished, however, until19:{1 when Dominic "Nappy" Napolitano decided to give his boxers something really worth fighting for -the missions in Bangladesh. 
Since Napolitano established Bengal Bouts as a fundraisor for the Holy Cross Missions, "the Bouts have become the largest contributor" to this cause, McGill said. 
McGill said the work the lloly Cross brothers have done in Bangladesh includes running a university and several elemen­tary and secondary schools, providing shelter and care for low-income families and build­
ing an orphanage, a  hospital  
and  a  shelter  for  abused  
women.  

"The Holy Cross Brothers are a huge presence in Bangladesh, and it's incredible how far the money we donate goes over· there," McGill said.

"I think we've been really suc­cessful f'undraising because we really talked to the boxers about the lloly Cross Missions and what the Brothers do -we encouraged everyone to get involved," he said. "We told thorn that granted, you're down Iin the gym I every day boxing, working hard and making some of your best friends ... but the real hnart and soul of the pro­gram, it's a charity event." 
That spirit of charity is evi­dent in every aspect of the Bengal Bouts, from the money donated to the Missions to the eountless voluntenrs who make the Bouts possibln. 
Two men, whom McGill deseribed as the "heart and soul of the Bouts," are volunteer coaehos Terry Johnson and Tom Suddes -both former boxers at Notre Dame. 
MeGill said Johnson, a Chicago attorney, is "basically the brains of' the Bouts; he has run them for about 39 years." lie said that Johnson eomes up with the fundraising, works closely with the captains and is instrumental in organizing and shaping the Bouts. 
"Suddes has been with the program for about 35 years," McGill said. "He eomes to over­see practiees and to the boxers. lie's the f'aee of Bengal Bouts." 
Suddes, from Dublin, Ohio, commutes every week either just to show up for a praetice or will bring his work with him and stay in South Bend for a few days so he can run several praetices and work with the boxers, McGill said.

The three junior captains are Lawrence Sullivan, Hunter Land and Jesse Brawer. 
"At the end of every year, the captains get together and look at who has the character to lead 200 guys in practice, to be role models for the novices but also · to instruct them in their boxing and help them develop their skills," McGill said of the eap­tain selection process. 
This year's 200-some partici­pants are more than the largest group in history, however. With eight returning champions and a number of returning finalists and semi-finalists, McGill said "it will probably-be the most skill-filled boxing tournament" he's been a part of. 
Freshman Jason Miller, whom McGill said has shown great dedication to the team, is par­ticipating tonight in his first light. Although boxing is "kind of out of character" for him, he said, he heard a lot of students talking about it at the activity fair in the fall and thought it sounded like fun.

IN BRIEF 

FCC licenses prohibit radio merger 
WASHINGTON -When the Federal Communications Commission auctioned off two exclusive licenses to create the satellite radio industry 10 years ago, it did not mince words on whether the competing providers could merge. 
The agency said that one licensee will "not be permitted to acquire control" of the other. The clause was inserted to ensure "sufficient continuing competition" in the new business, it said. 
But when dealing with the FCC, one should never say never. 
"The FCC can undo anything it does," said Andrew Schwartzman, president and CEO of the Media Access Project, a public interest law firm in Washington. "However, when you change course, you need a good reason to do it." 
On Monday, Washington D.C.-based XM Satellite Radio Inc. and New York City-based Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. announced a $13 bil­lion merger, not including debt. 
The companies will have to gain approval from the Justice Department as well as the FCC. Justice typically goes first in satellite mergers. If it blocks the deal, it's game over. But Schwartzman said that is unlikely to hap­pen. 

JetBlue focuses on customer rights 
NEW YORK -JetBlue Airways introduced a customer bill of rights on Tuesday that promis­es vouchers to fliers who experience delays, hoping the move wins back passengers after an operational meltdown damaged its brand and stock price. 
Founder and chief executive David Neeleman described the crisis as "a huge bump in the road" but said JetBlue would move past it. He said he had no intention of resigning in the wake of the worst corporate mess in the air­line's 7-year history. JetBlue's shares fell 66 cents, or 4.87 percent, to close at $12.90 on the Nasdaq Stock Market Tuesday. 
"I think I'm uniquely qualified to deal with these issues," Neeleman said. 
JetBlue said the first step in getting peo­ple to fly on the airline again was its intro­duction of a new customer bill of rights. 


Tobacco death award dismissed 
Supreme Court rules widow has no right to compensation for husband's death 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON-The 
Supremo Court threw out 
a $79.5 million award that 
a jury had ordered a ciga­

that could bode well for

Meeting

cized the relationship between Saint Mary's and Notre Dame but quickly ended the discussion of the topic. 
Shappell said the Student Senate University Relations committee at Notre Dame is now addressing the issue. Notre Dame senior Aly Baumgartner, the commit­tee's chair, did not speak on the topic Tuesday. 
Instead, the groups focused on describing the place of each group on its respective campus and in the larger pic­ture of student government. 
"COR is a microcosm of the larger Student Union consist­ing of presidents from all student organizations," Shappell said. 
The meeting was informal and was used as a "meet and greet" to get to know how each other's systems work,­Mcllduff said. 
"We are the main policy­making board on campus representing every major area of campus and campus groups," she said. 
Saint Mary's student Alanna Cheifari, the tri-cam­pus commissioner who sits on both COR and BOG on a weekly basis, directed the informal discussion and encouraged attendees to use one another as a resource. 
"We hope we can bounce ideas off each other about student government and learn from one other," she 
said. 
The meeting was mandato­ry for BOG members, who had a strong showing with nearly all members present. Due to scheduling eonl'liets and other commitments, only eight representatives from COR attended the meeting. 
Holy Cross student Deirdre O'Toole represented the third branch of the tri-eampus relationship. She was tho on Iy II oly Cross represen ta­tive present. 
Saint Mary's junior Amy Dardinger, Residenc11 Ilall Assoeiation president, led an ieebreaker activity to intro­ducP members from 11ach sehool. 
Members from COH and BOG then paired with a coun­terpart from the other sehool. They were given the chai1ce to discuss their posi­tions at their school and compare their roles. 
There were no serious implications of the meeting, but each student body presi­dent hopes to continue the tradition in the future. 
Prior to the joint meeting, BOG met at 5:30 p.m. as part of its weekly schedule. 
The group discussed the recent approval of the six­semester residency program. The program will begin with the freshman class of 2011 and requires them to live on campus through their junior year. 
"We market ourselves as a residential college," Vice President of Student Affairs Karen Johnson said. "Most of our peer schools require eight semesters; we decided to only require six," Thnre will be certain exc11ptions for local residents, transfers and abroad students which havn not ynt been finalized. 
BOG also invited Laurie Stickolrnaier, the Collngo's vice president of financ11 and administration, to discuss workers at Saint Mary's and­tho living wagn -an issue discussed at last w11nk's mn11ting. 
Stickelmainr said Saint Mary's is working to improvn wagns for its workers, but it is an ong:oing proenss. 
"Wn are paying our work­ers as rnueh as wn can right now as an institution," shn said. 
Stickelmaier said thn College has a thrne-yoar plan for college nmploynns, which was already brought lwforn tho Board of Trustees and will "hopefully" appear on the budget in April. 
"We arn set to address tho shortfall or wages at this time," she said. "It will take us three ynars, but to get our workers within ... 10 pnrcent lofl median market wagns in St. Joseph County, it will take us $1 million." 
Stiekelmaier is confident that the Trustees will eventu­ally approve this pending issue. 
"The Board n1eognizes that this is an important issue and I feel strongly that the Board will approve this first phase of thn three-year program." 
Saint Mary's inability to pay its workers tho mndian mar­ket wages stems from Notre Dame, Stickelmaier said. 
"Notre Dame drives the 
market," she said. "They have a mueh larger endow­mont than we do, so instead of f'oeusing on getting our workers in the 50th per­centile of wages, we have to foeus on trying to get them in the 40th right now."

EGYPT 

Nevv ton1bs discovered 
Associated Press 
SAQQARA -Archaeo-logists unveiled the tombs Tuesday of a pharaonic butler and a scribe that have been buried for more than 3,000 years -proof, they say, that Egypt's sands still have secrets to reveal. 

Although archaeologists have been exploring Egypt intensive­ly for more than 150 years, some estimate only one-third of what lies underground in Saqqara, site of the country's most ancient pyramid and bur­ial site of kings, has been uncovered. 
"The sands of Saqqara reveal lots of secrets," said Egypt's antiquities chief, Zahi Hawass, as he showed reporters a 4,000­year-old mud brick tomb that belonged to a scribe of divine records, Ka-Hay, and his wife. 
The tomb, along with the but­ler's 3,350-year-old limestone grave and two painted coffins, were discovered earlier this year near the famous Step Pyramid of King Djoser -the oldest of Egypt's more than 90 pyramids. 
Hawass said the three discov­eries are just the tip of what remains undiscovered at Saqqara, which was the burial grounds for Memphis, the capi­tal of Egypt's Old Kingdom. 

In December, archaeologists in Saqqara discovered the mummified remains of a doctor who was buried along with sur­gical tools more than 4,000 years ago. Two months earlier, the graves of three royal den­tists were discovered in Saqqara after the arrest of tomb raiders led archaeologists to the site. 
Hawass said the mud brick tomb unveiled Tuesday, which also featured wooden statues and a door with intricate hiero­glyphic carvings, "could enrich our knowledge about the people who actually su-rrounded the kings of Saqqara." 
"It doesn't look great because it was built from mud brick and not built of limestone, but I real­ly believe that this tomb is very important," said Hawass, who donned his signature Indiana Jones-style hat. 
Three wooden statues also were found in the tomb. Two of them, each about 3 feet tall and depicting the scribe, were laid out on pieces of foam on the ground. One was missing a left arm. The third was not shown because it was in poor condi­tion. 
After Hawass presented the tomb, workers picked up the ancient statues, pla<:ed them in the back of a pickup truck ­while tourists, surprised at the media commotion, quickly snapped photographs -and drove them to another building in the complex. 
On the other side of the Step Pyramid, archaeologists then unveiled the second tomb, which belonged to a butler who died some 3,350 years ago. 




Miracle baby stays in hospital 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -A girl born after just under 22 weeks in the womb -among the shortest gestation periods known for a live birth -will remain in a hospital a few extra days as a precaution, officials said Tuesday. 
Amillia Sonja Taylor, born Oct. 24 after just under 22 weeks in the womb, had been expected to be sent home from Bap tis t Children's Hospital on Tuesday. 
However, routine tests indi­cated she was vulnerable to infection, said Dr. Paul Fassbach, who· has cared for the baby since shor.tly after she was born. 
"She has been fine," Fassbach said, but doctors are being extra cautious "now that she's going into the world." 
Doctors say Amillia is 

among the few babies known to have survived after a gesta­tion of fewer than 22 weeks. She was just 9 1/2 inches long and weighed less than 10 ounces when she was deliv­ered by Caesarean section. Full-term births come after 37 to 40 weeks. 
Amillia, the first child for Eddie and Sonja Taylor of Homestead. now weighs 4 1/2 pounds and is just over 15 112 inches long. 
She has suffered respiratory and digestive problems, as well as a mild brain hemor­rhage, but doctors believe the health concerns will not have major long-term effects. 
Amillia was conceived in vitro and has been in an incu­bator since birth. She will continue to receive a small amount of supplemental oxy­gen even after she goes home. 
She was delivered because her mother was suffering 
from complications. Fassbach said that if doctors had known Amillia's real gestational age, they might not have inter­vened. He said he thought she was at .least 23 weeks, and doctors were shocked when the Taylors' fertility specialist pinpointed the exact date of fertilization. 
Fassbach cautioned against rushing to redefine the med­ical standards for fetus viabil­ity. 
"We just don't know which 21-to 22-weekers are going to do well and which are not going to do well," he said. "I don't think we should change what we do, but it shows us we need to do more research and find out where our edge of viability is going to go." 
Preterm births occur in about 12 percent of all preg­nancies in the U.S., according to the National Institute of Health.

Associated Press 
LONDON -Prime Minister Tony Blair will announce on Wednesday a new timetable for the withdrawal of British troops from Iraq, with 1,500 to return home in several weeks, the BBC reported. 
Blair will also tell the House of Commons during his regular weekly appearance that a total of about 3,000 British soldiers will have left southern Iraq by the end of 2007, if the security there is sufficient, the British Broadcasting Corp. said, quoting government officials who weren't further identified. 
The announcement comes even as President Bush imple­ments an increase of 21,000 more troops for Iraq. 
But Blair said Sunday that Washington had not put pres­sure on London to maintain its troop numbers. The BBC said Blair was not expected to say when the rest of Britain's forces would leave Iraq. Britain cur­rently has about 7,100 soldiers there. 
Blair's Downing Street office refused to comment on the BBC report. 
Blair and Bush talked by secure video link Tuesday morn­ing, and Bush said Britain's troop cutbacks were "a sign of success" in Iraq. 
"The president is grateful for the support of the British Forces in the past and into the future," 
U.S. National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said in Washington. "While the United Kingdom is maintaining a robust "force in southern Iraq, we're pleased that conditions in Basra have improved sufficiently that they are able to transition more control to the Iraqis." 
"The United States shares the same goal of turning responsibil­ity over to the Iraqi Security Forces and reducing the number of American troops in Iraq," Johndroe said. "President Bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the Iraqis deal with the sec­tarian violence in Baghdad." 
"We want to bring our troops homes as well," Johndroe said. "It's the model we want to emu­late, to turn over more responsi­bilities to Iraqis and bring our troops home. That's the goal and always has been." 
Blair said last month that he would report to lawmakers on his future strategy in Iraq follow­ing the completion of Operation Sinbad, a joint British and Iraqi mission targeting police corrup­tion and militia influence in the southern city of Basra. 

On Sunday, Blair told the BBC that the operation was complet­ed. 
Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said in January that Operation Sinbad offered the prospect of a "turning point for Iraq. hopefully in the near future." 
Treasury chief Gordon Brown, who is likely to succeed Blair by September, has said he hoped several thousand British soldiers would be withdrawn by December. 
As recently as late last month, Blair rejected opposition calls to withdrawal British troops by October, calling such a plan irre­sponsible. 
"That would send the most dis­astrous signal to the people that we are fighting in Iraq. It's a pol­icy that, whatever its superficial attractions may be, is actually deeply irresponsible," Blair said on Jan. 24 in the House of Commons. 


Megachurches break barriers 
Associated Press 
LEXINGTON, Mass.-Sundays at the evangelical Grace Chapel megachurch look like the American ideal of race relations: African­American, Haitian, white, Chinese and Korean families sing along with a white, guitar-playing pastor. 
U.S. churches rarely have this kind of ethnic mix. But that's chang­ing. Researchers who study race and religion say Grace Chapel is among a vanguard of megachurch­es that are breaking down racial barriers in American Christianity, altering the long-segregated land­scape of Sunday worship. 
"Megachurches as a whole are significantly better than other con­gregations at holding together mul­tiracial, multiethnic congregations," said Scott Thumma, an expert on megachurches and a professor at Hartford Seminary in Connecticut. "It's absolutely dear." 
A study by Thumma and the 

Leadership Network, a Dallas 
group that works with pioneering 
churches, found that minorities 
make up 20 percent or more of 
worshippers in nearly one-third of 
the nation's 1,200 megachurches. 
More than half of the megachurch­
es say they are intentionally work­
ing to attract different ethnic 
groups, according to the 2005 
study, part of a book that Thumma 
and network executive Dave Travis 
will publish in July. 
The question now is whether the 

new diversity is just a fad or a per­
manent shift. 
Although megachurches each 

draw at least 2,000 worshippers a 
week, they are a small percentage 
of the estimated 350,000 congrega­
tions across the United States. And 
leaders at Grace Chapel and other 
megachurches where whites 
remain the majority acknowledge 
enormous challenges in making 
minorities feel included so they'll . stay for the long term. 
Still, megachurches are trendset­ters, and the change they've made is startling considering nearly all other American churches serve one ethnic group. Even churches with a large number of immigrants gener­ally have separate English and non­English services. For black and white Christians, pre-Civil War church support for slavery and the general absence of white evangeli­cals from the civil rights movement continue to drive the two groups apart. 
Most megachurches don't carry that historical burden; nearly all have been built since the 1970s and play down any ties to a denomina­tion. 
But that's not the main attraction. 

Researchers have found that whites and nonwhites join megachurches for the same rea­sons: great guitar-and-drum wor­ship bands, strong programs for kids and a message of Bible-based self-betterment.

Thanksgiving is not uniqun to America. Traditional celebrations of' tlw autumnal harvest are celehralnd in many cultures and countries. llowovnr. in Amnriea, Thanksgiving takns on a spneial meaning as we remember somn of the first cele­brants oi'Thanksgiving in the Now World, the Pilgrims. Facing religious per­secution in their homnland, the Pilgrims fled England and a tyrannical King James for the promise of the Nnw World. Thus, Thanksgiving is not just a cnlebra­tion of the year's harvest. but also a reminder of the promisn of fmedom in America. 
At the same time that most Amnricans will be celebrating Thanksgiving, there will be a small group of citizens protest­ing at Plymouth Hock. Every year since 1970, American Indians and their sup­porters have been gathering at Plymouth Rock to observe their "National Day of Mourning." Thflse Indians are lhn other half of the Thanksgiving story. While the European colonizers prospered freely and built our great country, the Indians suffered and dind, oftnn at the hands of our own government. I should not need to give a detailed history of American Indian abusns perpntualnd by the United States people and its government. We all know the story. llowevnr, as if past atroc­ities were not enough, the federal gov­ernment continues today to persecute Native Americans undnr tho Bureau ol' Indian Affairs (BIA). 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 

Tho BIA was croatnd (indeod all exist­ing govornmonl bureaucracies were cre­alndl bncauso politicians in Washington believed that they knew what was bnst for a group of individuals. Originally organizod undnr tho War Department, tho BIA was responsible for mmoving Indians from their homelands and plac­ing them on unproduetivn reservations. Then the BIA cmatnd govornment sdwols whon~ they sent Indian childrnn to bn "eivilizod." Civilized in this case moans llwy worn abused, l'orbiddon to spnak their nalivn longue, separated from family and purged of any native nlllural oducation. Tlum tho BIA over­looked traditional Indian vinws of eom­munal propnrty and divided resnrvalion lands into individual plots. This was all purported lo bn in tho Indians' best intnrnst. bocaus11 il would allow llwm lo assimilatn faslor into tho European way of lifo. The BIA continuos to this day to unlawfully mnddle in the all'airs of American Indians. ll gives fedora! recog­nition and gaming rights to somn tribns while spurning others. ll intorvnnes in the all'airs of tribal governanco and die­latns tribal polieios. It administnrs health and education programs which arn woo­fully inadnquato. 
As with any govornmont agency, tho BIA is prono to r~orruption and misman­agonwnt. Al'lor tho allotmnnl of reserva­tion lands to individual Indians, many Indians placml lhoir lands in a trust. The BIA was in charge on managing this land trust, eontrading out mineral and resource rights to private companies. Many of lhoso conlraets heavily favored tho corporations al the expense of the American Indian landowners. Furtlwrmorn, tho funds from the sale of those rights havn bmm incredibly mis­managed. In I 996, American Indian rights groups sum! the Department of the Interior and the BIA. The ease, Cobol! vs. Kmnpt.horne, daims that the BIA owns morn than 1:~ billion dollars to the Indian trusts funds. Aceording to Judgn Hoyco Lamberth, "The actions of Intnrior and Secrntary Norton in this instance again dnmonstrate why the court continues to bnlieve that Interior sets the gold stan­dard for mismanagement ol' a govern­mont agnncy." The BIA is also a breeding ground for corruption. It was the compe­tition for lucrative Indian gaming eon­lrads that started Jaek Abramofl' on his road to infamy. 
So what has the American Indian gainnd from the corruption, mismanage­nwnl and "in-your-best-interest" govern­mnnt programs? American lndia1i sui­cide rates are 1.5 times tho national avnrage. Hates of poverty and unemploy­mnnl am more than twice tho national average. It is just a coincidence that poornst people in our nation are also subjneted to the most government ovnr­sighl'! Certainly not. Frnedom breeds prosperity. Rather than lifting American Indians out of poverty, the BIA has fos­lnrnd it through years of corruption, mis­management, and patronization. 
As we commemorate Native American llislory Month next November, let us rnmmnher that the struggle liJr Amnrkan Indian sovereignty is not over. Critks of the BIA are not few and far belwmm, and many American Indians have called for the abolishment or the BIA. As long as there exists a Burnau of Indian All'airs, American Indians will remain poor, broken and without free­dom. ll is lime to let Amerkan Indians rule themselves. Restore their property, their rights, and their sovereignty. Let them deeide for themselves what is best li>r their poople, their culture and their prosperity.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
'Loyal Daughters': More than a play 
Editor's note: The Observer respects the wishes ofthis letter writer to remain anonymous. As a policy, The Observer does not name victims ofsexual assault. 
In response to Jon Buttaci's Letter to the Editor ("Loyal Daughters' humor detracts from true dialogue," Feb. 20) and the ongoing dialogue about sexual assault on the Notre Dame campus, I would like to first and foremost ask Mr. Buttaci when was the last time he was personal­ly sexually assaulted. Though I know that males can be victims of sexual assault just as women can be, I am going to jump out on a limb and assume that he hasn't been. 
But I have. 
It wasn't really something I was going to throw out there to the whole campus, but I think my story is impor­tant to this dialogue. 
Last November I went to see "Loyal Daughters" with a large group of girls from my dorm, Breen-Phillips Hall. When I got into rny seat and began looking at my pro­gram I immediately noticed a page which said something to the extent of "ifthis play brings up any painful memo­ries that you need help dealing with there are people located all throughout the theater to help" and then it listed many ways sexual assault victims can get help on the Notre Dame campus. When I saw this disclaimer I knew that "Loyal Daughters" was going to be more than just a fun night at the theater for me. 
During the show I was able to laugh and cry, but most importantly I was able to see myself in each scene in some way. After the play, a smaller group of girls includ­ing our two ARs and my RA went to Starbucks to discuss the play. During our conversation I began to tell my story for the very first time since it happened. I was able to actually talk about it. I was finally able to admit to myself that it had really happened. I'd spent four years pretend­ing it hadn't. 
"Loyal Daughters" was able to put me at ease through its humor while still being serious enough to help me come to an emotional and intellectual breakthrough in my life. Finally my mind and my heart could understand one another on this issue. I haven't seen 'The Vagina Monologues" in full, but the parts I have seen made me intensely uncomfortable; I'm not sure that I could cope with an entire viewing of such a graphic play. But pre­cisely because "Loyal Daughters" employs humor, I was able to relax enough to get the real points it was trying to make. 
"Loyal Daughters" helped me to change my life. I was finally able to talk to people about what had happened to me. I called some of my friends from home, who knew me at the time it happened, and broke a four year silence. They were shocked that) had been unable to tell them such an important thing, but glad they were finally able to offer me the support I'd needed for so long. Last week I interviewed with "Loyal Daughters and Sons" in an effort to contribute to the play which helped me so much. I offered my story to "Loyal Daughter and Sons" in hopes that I might in a small way be able to help someone like myself. 
Yesterday, Monday, I went to my first counseling ses­sion at the esc to discuss the deep issues in my life as a result of the violence against me, a step that I'd never have been able to take before "Loyal Daughters." These things may not seem monumental, but for me,. they are all huge steps in the right direction. 
Mr. Buttaci's insinuation that "Loyal Daughters" is use­less tore me apart. Useless? For me it was the most use­ful play I've ever seen. Sexual assault victims struggle with the way their ability to choose was taken away from them. "Loyal Daughters" gave me my choice back. I choose to see "Loyal Daughters" and to offer it my full support. Mr. Buttaci is free to exercise his right to choose not to see the play, and his right to choose to aid the problem of sexual assault in any way he wants. I'll be sure to attend his play, or whatever venture he sponsors to advance the issue of sexual assault awareness. In fact, I look forward to it, but I won't hold my breath waiting for him to step up and actually do something.

In 'Loyal Daughters,' humor effective, necessary 
In his Feb. 20 Letter to the Editor ('"Loyal Daughters' humor detracts from true dialogue") Jon Buttaci argues that the play "Loyal Daughters" is "danger­ous" because it uses humor to keep students from actually thinking about the ideas it presents. The first flaw in Buttaci's argument is that anyone who actu­ally saw "Loyal Daughters" is aware that for ninety percent of the play, there was nothing to laugh about. The performance dealt seriously with heavy issues of sexual assault on Notre Dame's campus. 
That said, let's go ahead and talk about that lighter 10 percent. Clearly, Buttaci seems to feel that we, as Notre Dame students, are sheep, incapable of laughing and thinking at the same time, and therefore we should not be allowed to view anything that may lead us astray by requiring individual thought. Buttaci's argument also denies the important power of humor to convey ideas in a thought-provoking manner. Humor, it would seem, can only be propaganda. 
Contrary to Buttaci's narrow definition of the function of humor, playwrights and other authors throughout history have been using humor to pose serious questions and demand critical thought from their audiences. I will give one sig­nificant example: playwright Luigi Pirandello defined humor not as something that merely makes an audience laugh, but rather as something that evokes what he called a "sentimento del contrario," or a feeling that something is con­trary to what it should be. The audience may laugh for a minute, but will then be forced to ponder whatever it is that is out of place. Something that is humor­ous, according to Pirandello, can actually be quite serious, even sad. The mono­logue that Buttaci discusses, called "Logic," is not only laugh-out-loud humor­ous. Sure, the audience laughed when actor Patrick Tighe stormed on to the stage waving Du Lac around. However, as a member of the "Loyal Daughters" cast, I can honestly say that I never once saw an audience that was still laugh­ing when Tighe delivered his final line, in the form of a question, to the audi­ence. So, with respect to Buttaci's argument, I challenge the thoughtful reader to take up the same question that Tighe posed to those who saw the perform­ance: "Is this valid? Anyone?" 
Mary Migliozzi "senior Pangborn Hall Feb. 20 


Qlassics, 'Monologues' bring diversity 
In Mary Elizabeth Walter's Letter to the Editor ("Dialogue is not dead," Feb. 20) she says that presenting material pertaining to subjects such as that, which is discussed in the Qlassics film festival and "The Vagina Monologues", is not necessary to facilitate discussions. I disagree with this claim. 
Qlassics and the "Monologues" are necessary because they present alternative views from a point of view unbiased from the Catholic Church and it is necessary for stu­dents to understand these views. To oppose events such as Qlassics or the "Monologues" is to deny the fact that any alternative opinions exist on the subjects that these events attempt to address, which is a naive approach to the world. Yes, we go to a Catholic university, which promotes the teaching of the Church, but when we leave the "bubble" of Notre Dame, we will enter a world that contains and acknowl­edges many alternative views. The "Monologues" is an opportunity for people to com­municate their alternative views. It is an effort to make people aware, especially in an environment like Notre Dame, that there is more than one answer to a question. People who believe in alternative views to the Church's teachings define truth differ­ently. 
The "Monologues" are performed because they provide insight into the personal experiences of real women, a point of view that cannot be discussed in an academic forum where no one has experienced first-hand the experiences being debated. We are so quick to form opinions today that we sometimes forget that we do not know everything. How can we debate a topic when we have no understanding of the sub­ject? 
When people go and attend the "Monologues," they are not going to be "sitting in a plush theatre," rather they are acknowledging that they may be able to understand alternative view to their own by listening to someone else's opinions. Whether these truths have validity, we must acknowledge their presence within our world, and this is their importance in facilitating the dialogue Walter claims already exists on campus. 
College is a time in our lives to define who we are. We form our opinions independ­ent from our parents for the first time and we begin to learn about different points of view. It seems nowadays that people are quick to form a opinion but they have no sup­port to back it up. I challenge Walter and every other student on campus, regardless of your political, religious, or moral views to explore and learn from people who hold opposite opinions to your own because you might fmd that you could learn something from simply listening instead of always saying how you feel.

The 79th Animal Academy Awards feature the most wide-open Best Picture race in years. In a pack that doesn't yet have a clear-cut front-runner, only "The Departed" and "Babel" have separated themselves enough to be considered favorites. In fact, the most­nominated film, "Dreamgirls" (with eight nominations), failed to even receive a Best Picture nom, despite having won the Golden Globe for Best Musical or Comedy. 
The acting awards, however, are the polar opposite. All of them are essentially locked up, with heavy favorites in each of the four major categories. 
The biggest storyline revolves around direc­tor Martin Scorsese, who has never won a Best Director statuette. His film, "The Departed," has a legitimate chance of winning Best Picture, which bodes well for the cinema legend. The Oscars are always an entertaining show, but this year promises to have more surprises and drama than usual.

the best-reviewed films of Who should win: Abigail the year. If she were to categories. Breslin, "Little Miss Sunshine" 
lose, it would be nothing less than a stunning, almost inconceivable upset. 
Who should win: Helen Mirren, "The Queen" 
Why she should win: The Best Actress race is an odd mixture of old favorites (Meryl Streep? Judi Dench? Again?) and younger talent like Penelope Cruz and Kate Winslet.. Both Streep and Judi Dench have already won, and it seems like Winslet and Cruz will have to wait until they are matched with bet­ter material. Mirren's performance is genuine­ly the best of the bunch, which makes her a shoo-in for the award. 
Best Actor 

Who will win: Forest Whitaker, "The Last King of Scotland" 
Why he'll win: Another lock. It seems highly unlikely that Whitaker will lose, despite the fact that he's in a very deep and talented pool of actors. Surprisingly, this is Whitaker's first career nomination, and his brutal take on Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in "The Last King of Scotland" earned positive eritical notices ­it is generally considered Whitaker's best per­formance in an already long and distinguished career. 
Who should win: Leonardo DiCaprio, "Blood 
ODDS courtest of bodog.com 
RY By 

Diamond" 
Why he should win: A few years ago I picked DiCaprio as my choice for Best Actor for "The Aviator," which was a pretty unpopu­lar piek considering the actor's pedigree and resume. 
Two years later, nobody's laughing. 
DiCaprio gave a pair of fantastic perform­anees this year, and while his paranoid turn in "The Departed" may have actually been the stronger of the two, he brings a lot of depth to "Blood Diamond." Unlike "The Departed," "Blood Diamond" is fully DiCaprio's movie, and he dominates every scene. We are wit­nessing the emergence of one of the great actors of our time. 
Best Supporting Actress 
Who will win: Jennifer Hudson, "Dreamgirls" 
Why she'll win: Hudson already won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress, and it seems that acting awards are going to be the consolation prizes for "Dreamgirls" (since the lilm itself failed to garner a Best Picture 
nomination).. Hudson's brash 
Why she should win: Breslin's sweet-natured, yet surprisingly mature performance is the heart and soul of "Little Miss Sunshine." All of 10 years old, Breslin is one of the youngest nominees ever, but her age belies the fact that she really is good in this year's Oscar sleeper. 
Adriana Barraza was also fantastic as housekeeper Amelie in "Babel," and her per­formance deserves its accolades, but it's unlikely that anyone will be able to wrest the award away from Hudson. 
Best Supporting Actor 
Who will win: Eddie Murphy, "Dreamgirls" 
Why he'll win: You've got to wonder if the backlash of "Norbit" will come back to haunt Murphy on Oscar night. Murphy's perform­ance in "Dreamgirls" earned a ton of positive notices, including a Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe, and seemed to indicate that the SNL alum is ready to come into his own as a dramatic actor. 
The Aeademy has definitely taken notice, despite ill-advised projects like "Norbit," which makes Murphy the frontrunner for the award. 
Who should win: Mark Wahlberg, "The Departed" Why he should win: Man, who would've

Why it should win: It's extremely difficult to write a good war film. Developed from a story by Yamashita and Paul Haggis (who was nom­inated for "Million Dollar Baby" in 2004 and won for "Crash" in 2005), "Letters from Iwo Jima" is an elegant, elegiac look at the Japanese who fought and died in one of the Pacific Theater's bloodiest battles. The screenplay's nomination alone is justified by one scene, in which General Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) quietly listens to a radio transmis­sion from the mainland.

Who will win: Martin Scorsese, "The Departed" 
Why he'll win: Is this the year Scorsese gets it done? Endlessly shafted, rarely rewarded, the 64-year-old director is nothing less than an American treasure, with a handful of stone-cold classics

It seems almost inconceivable that Mr. Martin Scorsese, possibly the greatest living director and no doubt one of the greatest of all time, will lose this year ....unless Clint Eastwood beats him again. 
Who should win: Martin Scorsese, "The Departed" 
Why he should win: There's something oddly comforting about the fact that Scorsese's never won. It makes for a long-run­ning joke, and puts him in good company ­Charlie Chaplin, Stanley Kubrick and Alfred Hitchcock never won for directing either. 
Yet it seems pretty improbable that Scorsese will lose this year and rightfully so, since "The Departed" is an amazing picture. Scorsese has rarely directed with such verve and energy, which for him is saying a lot. 
So take notice because this is the year, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences -you wouldn't just be throwing Scorsese a bone, you'd be rewarding him for his out­standing work on the year's best film. 
Best Picture 

What will win: "Babel" 
Why it'll win: When was the last time that there was an Oscar race this wide-open? "Babel" is the default pick, if only because it won the Golden Giobe for Best Picture. Yet, for perhaps the first time ever, every single film that has been nominated ha~ a legitimate chance of winning, including dark horse nomi­nee "Little Miss Sunshine." 
The race is essentially coming down to "Babel" vs. "The Departed," but the possibility of a split vote means any of the other three films could take home the top prize. "Babel" might win, but it will certainly be close enough to cause a lot of debate. 
What should win: "The Departed" 
Why it should win: Simply put, "The Departed" is an instant classic, shooting into the upper echelons of Scorsese's best work. As See Also thrillingly entertaining as it is cinematically accom­"Academy Awards plished, "The Departed" .is

Oscar Oversights

Despite leading the pack in total nomina­tions with eight, "Dreamgirls" did not receive a Best Picture nod. 

+ 
Ken Watanabe failed to receive a nomina­tion for his brilliant, compe.lling turn as General Kuribayashi in Clint Eastwood's "The Departed."

+ 
Jack Nicholson, the most-nominated actor in Oscar history, failed to garner a nom for his work as Boston mobster Frank Costello in Martin Scorsese's "The Departed." 

+ 
Alfonso Cuar6n's "Children of Men" received no major nominations outside of screenplay. Notable omissions were Cuar6n for directing, Clive Owen for acting and a Best Picture nomination. 

+ 
"Casino Royale," the "reboot" of the James Bond franchise, received no major nominations, despite being a critical and com­mercial smash. Daniel Craig's fierce, charis­matic performance went un-nominated. 

+ 
Neither of the 9/11 themed films (Paul Greengrass' "United 93" and Oliver Stone's "World Trade Center") received any major nominations. 

+ 
Sacha Baron Cohen, who won the Golden Globe for Best Actor, did not receive a nomi­nation for "Borat!"

ACADEMY AWARDS HAVE LONG, RICH HISTORY 
By MARTY SCHROEDER Assistant Scene Editor 
This year marks the 79th time the Academy of Motion I'icture Arts and Sciences will gather together to hand out the Academy Award of Merit -the iconic statuette given for Academy Awards, or Oscars. 
This night of glitz and glam has its share of history and interesting trivia. For example, the 1941 Orson Welles epic that has come to be known as one of the greatest films ever made, "Citizen Kane," only won one Oscar ­and for Best Screenplay at that. It lost out on the Best Motion Picture Oscar to a little-known film directed by John Ford-"How Green Was My Valley." 
Needless to say, the Academy doesn't get it right every time, but its awards have come to be known as the apex of achievement for those involved in the motion picture industry. 
But what about the star of the cere­mony himself -Oscar himself? Where does he come from, and why has he been dubbed Oscar? 
The sword wielding art-deco crusad­er was designed by Cedric Gibbons, sculpted in clay by George Stanley and then cast in tin and copper and plated in gold by Alex Smith. This is the chronicle of his birth and he has changed little except for the base of the statuette, which has been streamlined in recent years. 
His name is something more of a mystery. Some claim Bette Davis named Oscar after her husband Harmon Oscar Nelson. Others say that the Academy's Executive Secretary, Margaret Herrick, after seeing the stat­ue in 1931, said it reminded her of her uncle Oscar. 
Whatever the actual story, the golden knight standing on the reel of film is one of the most highly prized awards in the entertainment industry. 
Though Oscar himself stands in gold­en perfection, the awards ceremony ­and the voting of the Academy mem­bers -is far from perfect. Many times the Academy voters have made deci­sions that seems correct at the time but do not seem right years down the road -like choosing "Shakespeare in Love" over "Saving Private Ryan" in 1998. 

Some of the more infamous gaffes have come in recent years. The 1992 award for Best Supporting Actress went to Marisa Tomei for her role in "My Cousin Vinny." Urban legend claims that presenter Jack Palance actually read the wrong name because Tomei was considered a long shot against the other four nominees. 
Whatever the case, this example shows that not everyone is a lock, no matter what what the critics and so­called experts say. 
Another incident involving accept­ance speeches occurred in 2000 when Julia Roberts won her Best Actress Oscar for her role in '"Erin Brockovieh." When she got up to the microphone she seemed to thank everyone and their dog -forgetting, however, the real-life Erin Broekovich. This snub will go down as a lesson to 
JEFF ALBERT/Observer Graphic 
anyone composing an acceptance speech. 
The Academy Awards are not quite the perfect dream that many budding actors and filmmakers might expect. In fact, there are a lot of politics and a lot of commercialism involved. Some movie studios push their films harder than others to get votes, which ulti­mately equals dollar signs (such as the infamous over-saturating market strat­egy known as the "Miramax Machine"). 
What can be counted on, however, is a night equally exciting for those obsessed with celebrity gossip and fashion as for those that just love movies ... despite the occasional gaffe in etiquette. 
After all, nothing said "the classiest night on Earth" like playing the theme from "The Terminator" right after cine­matographer Robert Richardson dedi­cated his Oscar for "The Aviator" to his recently deceased mother.

-OscAR's DARK HoRsEs CouLD TAKE THE LEAD 
By MICHELLE FORDICE 
Scene Writer 
The Academy Awards are notorious for the inscrutability of their nomination process. 
Somewhere between the 6,000 unnamed members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences receiv­ing a ballot and a winner receiving a golden statuette, a list of nominees is formed and a winner chosen. But every year, there is a nomination that no one actually believes will win, no matter its cinematic worth -the dark horse. 
Dark horse nominations are the movies and performances that, though excellent examples of filmmaking, don't seem to quite fit the typecast of an Oscar contender, and are a long shot to win. 
Of course, the official qualifications to be nominated are deceptively simple. Best Picture nominees simply have to fulfill such requirements as have a run­ning time over 40 minutes and be released in a commercial theatre for paid admission. But there is an unde­fined standard which nominees are expected to fill to have a chance to win. 
Dark horse candidates are fairly com­mon. "Seabiscuit" for the 2003 Best Picture was one, as it stood up to movies such as "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" and "Mystic River." So were "Babe" in 1995 -against "Apollo 13," "The Postman (II Postino)," and "Braveheart" -and "Quiz Show" in 1994 -against "Forrest Gump," "The Shawshank Redemption" and "Pulp Fiction." 
None of the films were undeserving nominations, but they were unlikely to be Oscar winners. Generally, they didn't have the "seriousness" or the chance for historical longevity associated with Oscar Best Pictures. 
The likelihood of there being a non­standard best picture nominee was high this year because so many contenders were still left in the running right before the nominations were announced. 
Everything from "Apocalypto" to "Bobby" to "Pan's Labyrinth" was still considered a possibility. Even "Babel," which is now considered to have a shot, was not a sure thing. 

. The odds increased when "Dream­girls" was left out of the best picture race, leaving an open spot behind it. Now, several of the other acclaimed nominees, such as "The Queen" and "The Departed," have a shot at the top prize. 
The dark horse candidate for best pic­ture this year is "Little Miss Sunshine," which has received considerable critical acclaim, gathering four Oscar nomina­tions and two Golden Globe nods. It has gained popular support, managing to· rank in the top three weekly box office winners, despite being an independent film with a relatively low $8 million budget. 
Still, it does not fit the typical Oscar persona. 
While "Little Miss Sunshine" has dra­matic elements, it is considered comedic satire, a genre that has never fared well at the Academy Awards. It is also the first feature film of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, so it cannot be car­ried by director prestige. Despite all of its merit, "Little Miss Sunshine" will probably never shed its film-festival roots. 
Another dark horse for this year's Academy Awards is Ryan Gosling for best actor. Gosling was nominated for his portrayal of gifted high school teacher and cocaine addict Dan Dunne in "HalfNelson." 
Since the film itself has not received much attention -in fact, it is Gosling's performance that has mostly put it on the radar -it will not carry him. Neither will Gosling's acting history; he is most known for "The Notebook" and "Remember the Titans," neither of which are Oscar-type movies. 
Finally, up against names like Peter O'Toole, Forest Whitaker, and even Leonardo DiCaprio and Will Smith, Gosling does not have much of a chance. Despite his strong performance, Gosling is not actually seen as a contender this year. 
As the 79th Academy Awards draw near, there aren't as many sure bets as in years past. Maybe this is the year that one of the dark horses will take the lead.

Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -It was Oscar De La Hoya's turn to take the podium, and he could hardly get a word in. 
Floyd Mayweather Jr. was busy yelling back at rowdy fans, posing for pic­tures and doing everything he could to annoy De La Hoya. 
It's The Golden Boy against the Pretty Boy, and, boy, what a scene it was. 
"This guy has been under my skin for a while," De La Hoya said Tuesday at the Waldorf­Astoria. It was the first stop of an 11-city promo­tiona! tour in advance of their highly anticipated super welterweight title fight on May 5 in Las Vegas. 

"He's a little brat," De La Hoya added with a smile. ''I'm going to teach him a lesson." 
The trash talk flew, mostly from Mayweather's camp, throughout the press conference, which was marked by the type of lavish production music, lights and videos that's expected to accompany a fight with the slogan, "The World Awaits." 
When De La Hoya (38-4, 30 knockouts) and Mayweather (37 -0, 24 KOs) square off at the MGM Grand for De La Hoya's title, the fight is expected to set pay-per­view records and be shown in a record 176 countries. It also sold out in three hours. 
With a crowd of close to 200 media and several hundred more fans in attendance, a digital countdown board was dis­played outside the press conference and huge pro­motional posters lined the walls. 
Mayweather, looking to win a title in his fifth weight class, was the first to enter the huge ballroom to Queen's "Another One Bites The Dust." He strolled down the red car­
.... 
pet that led to the podium, stopping frequently to shake hands and pose for pictures soaking in the cheers and jeers. 
He took off his brightly colored warmup jacket when he reached the podi­um, revealing a dark T­shirt. A few moments later, De La Hoya made his way in, wearing a sharp, black suit but not for long. 
As soon as De La Hoya started walking, Mayweather whipped off his shirt and flexed for the crowd. When De La Hoya reached the podium, he took off his suit jacket and pulled his dress shirt out of his pants to expose his abs. 
IN BRIEF 
Gonza!!a's Heytvelt charged
with fefony driig possession 
SPOKANE, Wash. -Suspended Gonzaga center Josh Heytvelt is being charged with felony possession of a controlled substance following his Feb. 9 arrest, when police said they found hallucinogenic mushrooms in his car. 
According to court documents released Tuesday, police found 33.2 grams -just over an ounce -of mushrooms inside a plastic ziplock bag in the back of the Chevrolet Blazer that Heytvelt was driving. Possession of any amount of illegal mushrooms is a Class C felony.

Jeter denies rift with teammate Rodriguez 
Yankee captain does not discuss pair's off-field relationship 
Associated Press 
TAMPA, Fla. -Derek Jeter wouldn't discuss his off-the­field relationship with Alex Rodriguez. A-Rod, however, felt relieved to speak his mind. 
As 64 New York Yankees players assembled on the field for the first time this year, the focus was on the withered friendship of their two biggest stars. 
"I don't have a rift with Alex," Jeter said Tuesday, a day after Hodriguez finally acknowledged they no longer are the best of friends. "We go out there. We work together. This is our fourth year to be playing together. It's annoying to hear about it all the time." 
Shortly after arriving at spring training on Monday, Rodriguez said it was time for him to stop pretending that his relationship with Jeter was as close as it was in the 1990s. The pair have drifted apart since Hodriguez made critical remarks in a 2001 Esquire article. 
"That's as honest as I've been here since I've been here, the four years, and that part of it felt good," Hodriguez said Tuesday as he left Legends Field. 
A-Rod's psyche has been subject to analysis by fans since he joined the Yankees before the 2004 season. While he's a two-time AL MVP, Jeter has four World Series rings. 
Hodriguez felt a need to con­form during his first three sea­sons in New York. He appears to be taking a different tack this year. 
"I just found myself trying to say always the right things and trying not to screw up," he said. "And I think that came across for some people as very disingenuous and phony per­haps -those are the things you hear. If you're going to get chopped up into pieces, you might as well be as honest as you can and get ripped for it." 
He thinks he'll be more at ease going forward. 
"You get a little gun-shy, that's all," he said. "It all comes down to being your­self." 
Sitting in virtually the same spot in the first-base dugout at Legends Field that Rodriguez occupied a day earlier, Jeter appeared uncomfortable dis­cussing the topic. 
"I don't see the relevance of it," he said. "It has no bearing on us playing baseball." 
He doesn't comprehend the focus on their relationship. 
"They see us on the field, if one person gives another one a look, it's a story," Jeter said. "If we're at opposite ends of the bench, people say it's a story." 
Jeter spoke with Rodriguez

-in the clubhouse. He played catch with him on the field as they warmed up. But he refused to say how close he and Rodriguez are away from the ballpark. "How would I characterize it? I would characterize it as it doesn't make a difference," Jeter said. "What we do away from the field, how much time we spend together, really 
makes no difference when we're playing." 
Coming up through the Yankees' organization and becoming a key component of the unit that won four World Series titles from 1996-2000, Jeter has worked hard to avoid discussing his private lil'e. 
"I understand my job is pub­lic, but your personal life is your personal life. Once you open that door, it doesn't stop," he said. "Away from the f'ip,Jd, peoplP want to kBep tabs on how many times we go out to eat, things like that. That has no bBaring on what we're trying to do." 
Jeter was criticized by some last year for not voicing suffi­cient support for Rodriguez, who struggled at times during the regular season and was booed at Yankee Stadium. 
"From Day 1 I've said I sup­port Alex," he said. "The only l.hing I'm not going to do is tell the fans what to do.... I don't

think it's my job to tell fans to boo or not to boo." 
Yankees manager Joe Torre thought it was good for Hodriguez to air his issues early in spring training. 
"Evidently, what Alex was talking about yesterday sort of made him feel bettor," Torre said. "Evidently, Alex said what he needod to say." 
Bernie Williams was not among those who worked out. Torre has tried to persuade him to accept a minor league contract and called Williams again Sunday night, but Williams didn't return thn eall. 
"Evidently, what I've said to him hasn't bnen enough for him," Torre said. "I know he was down when I talked to him."

Chicago ace Zambrano inks deal vvith Cubs 

AP Cubs pitcher Carlos Zambrano throws a pitch during a spring training workout at the team's practice facility Monday. 
Associated Press 
MESA, Ariz. Carlos Zambrano and the Chicago Cubs agreed to a $12.4 million, one-year contract Tuesday, avoiding salary arbitration by striking the deal just before the scheduled hearing. 
He would also earn bonuses for finishing among the top five in Cy Young Award voting, being named MVP of the World Series and League Championship Series, making the All-Star game, winning the Gold Glove and the Silver Slugger award. 
Zambrano earned $6.5 mil­lion last season while going 16­7 with a 3.41 ERA and 210 strikeouts. He asked for $15.5 million in arbitration, while the Cubs countered at $11,025,000 -more than any player has been awarded. 
"I feel good, ready to go," Zambrano said. ''I'm ready to lead this team to the champi­onship, to win in this city. The fans deserve us to go to the playoffs and to win for the city of Chicago. I'm here for that." 
The Cubs have not been to the playoffs since 2003, when they were within five outs of reach­ing the World Series. Their last arbitration hearing was with Mark Grace in 1993. 
"Our track record is in order," general manager Jim Hendry said. 
Barely. 
"There was no other case on the dockets at all like this," Hendry said. "From Day 1, when the filing numbers went in, it was like, 'Wow, this is a tough one."' 
The sides reached an agree­ment as they were walking to the room at the Phoenix hotel where the hearing was to be held. Now, they can focus on trying to work out a multiyear contract, which would likely be in the five-year range. 
Zambrano told WGN-TV last week that he would leave as a free age.nt after the season if the Cubs didn't sign him to a long-term deal by opening day -but he backed off a few days later. lie did, however. reiterate that he won't negotiate during the season and wants to be paid on the level of left-bander Barry Zito, who got a $126 million, seven-year contract with San Francisco this offseason. 
"I don't want to have a dis­traction during the season," Zambrano said. "But if some­thing ean happen after the sea­son, why not?" 
Hendry said, ''lie's always told me he wants to be here ­first preference and probably second preference. Why would (1), as a general manager, not want him on the ballclub. I don't think we'II be working on it tonight at dinner, but we're happy. 
"''ve known him since he was a kid and he's grown into a heck of a man." 
A native of Venezuela, Zambrano signed with the Cubs as a non-drafted free agent in July 1997 and made his major league debut in 2001. The two­time All-Star is 64-42 with a 
3.29 ERA. 
"This is a good relationship between Jim Hendry and me," Zambrano said. "I think every­body's happy, as well." 
Zambrano said Monday he was "85 to 90 percent" sure a deal would get done before the hearing. 
Cubs manager Lou Piniella predicted there would be an agreement, too. 
"I don't think the club needs that, and neither does the play­er," Piniella said Tuesday after­noon. 
Piniella said he attended one hearing -when he was the New York Yankees' general manager in the late 1980s and third baseman Mike Pagliarulo went to arbitration -and it was a "rough process." Piniella didn't present any arguments; he just listened. But he did offer a compromise after the hear­ing. 
"After it was over, I told him, 'We'll split this thing before the awards are made because I think you're n'Ot going to be pleased with the outcome,"' Piniella recalled. "He chose not to, and I was right. I felt a little uncomfortable in there, to be honest." 
Hendry said there was "never any animosity" during negotia­tions and there wasn't going to be any because of the hearing. 
"There wasn't going to be any tearing down of Carlos Zambrano because, first of all, he's our best pitcher," he said. ''I've got nothing bad to say to him. All I want him to do is win more games than he won last year.... The person who was going to present our case had been told by me that was the way it was going to be." 
The Cubs committed nearly $300 million to retain and bring in free agents before reaching an agreement with Zambrano. They re-signed third baseman Aramis Ramirez for $75 million over five years, and signed out­fielder Alfonso Soriano to an eight-year, $136 million deal. They also brought in starting pitchers Ted Lilly and Jason Marquis. 
sixth double-double of the season. 
Senior Bridget Lipke also set an MIAA Tournament record, dishing out 11 assists in an incredible performance. 
Junior Alison Kessler led the Belles with 20 points, and in doing so set the Saint 
some momentum," Henley said. "We showed we could play with them last game, and we hope to go on the road and get it done this time."

Bonds challenges U.S. grand jury 
Slugger also hits five home runs in first batting practice 
Associated Press 
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -Barry Bonds had a pointed message for the grand jury: Go ahead, investigate me. 
After arriving at spring train­ing Tuesday, more fit than in recent years following a pro­ductive winter of conditioning, the slugger insisted he's unfazed by all his off-the-field issues and is ready to resume his pursuit of the home run record. 
"Let them investigate. Let them, they've been doing it this long," Bonds said Tuesday after his first workout this year with the San Francisco Giants. "It doesn't weigh on me at all-at all. It's just you guys talking. It's just media conversation." 
When Bonds showed up, he waved twice to the swarm of people waiting to see him make his entrance, then quickly head­ed into Scottsdale Stadium to get to work. 
Noticeably absent wer_e his two personal trainers, Greg Oliver and Harvey Shields, who no longer can be with the slug­ger at the ballpark. Bonds, who spent the weekend in Las Vegas for the NBA All-Star game, was f1anked by his two publicists and a Major League Baseball security guard assigned to him. 
He joked with new teammate Barry lito in their corner space of the clubhouse, then the 42­year-old Bonds made his way through the room and greeted outfielder Jason Ellison, infield­er Rich Aufilia and pitcher Matt Morris. Clubhouse staff soon came his way with new under­shorts and hats. 
Bonds took part in a team meeting before walking to the field for the Giants' l'irst full­squad workout -and he took a big bow for the horde of cam­eras. IIe re-emerged latnr in the morning to start his routine and waved his batting helmet to fans in the bleachers, carrying two bats in his right hand. 

He shagged lly balls and hit five home runs in batting prac­tice, including a shot to the berm in right-center on a fast­ball from No. 2 starter Matt Cain. That was enough to impress new skipper Bruce Bochy, who saw Bonds do his share of damage against his old team, the Padres. Bonds has hit morn homers against San Diego than any other team. 
"lie's an incredible talent," Bochy said. "I le showed it today on the first day." 
Bonds was mostly business ­with a little fun mixed in ­once he got on the lield. 
lie still could be indicted if a federal grand jury determines that he perjured himself whim testifying in 2003 in the BALCO steroid distribution ease that hf1 hadn't knowingly taken por­formance-enhaneing drugs. Bonds, who has long denied ever using steroids, said his level of concern about the investigation is "none." 
Last month. the New York Daily News reported that Bonds fail(~d an amphetamin11s test last season and then attributed it to a substance he took from teammate Mark Swoonny's lock­er. Bonds publicly apologized to Sweeney at tho time, then stretched alongside him and Ray Durham on the first day ol' workouts. 
"I did not blame Mark Sweeney," Bonds said Tuesday, noting he apologized only "because you guys just started talking about it and I just thought it was unfair l'or him to be accused ol' something that wasn't true." 
Asked if he had failed an 
amphetaminos lost, Bonds dnc.lined to commtmt. Also, ho denied reports that he wasn't always availablo to pinch-hit last season. 
"That's not truo at all," said Bonds. who has language about behavior in his new contract. ''I'm always availablP. I'm in unil'orrn, so I'm always avail­able." 
As l'ar as Bonds is coneerned, all that is ovor with. "I don't nnnd to say anything to anybody," he said. 
Bonds quiekly nndnd his 12­minute interview in tho dugout when the questions turned l'rom baseball to his problems away from the field. 
lie begins his 22nd major league season, and 15th with San Francisco, nnnding only 22 homo runs to break Hank Aaron's earner rneord of 755. Bonds isn't about to makn pro­dictions, but said hn won't stop once he catches llammerin' Hank. 
"I said I'm playing till I'm 100 
-you guys gnt used to  mn,"  
Bonds said.  
Bonds and Zito had  a  littln  

fun, corning out of tho club­house at orw point in matt:hing black T-shirts with this orange writing on thn back: "DON'T ASK ME ... ASK BAHHY." each with an arrow that pointed at the other Barry. Zito, who threw to Bonds t.his wintnr at UCLA, stood on tlw lnll with his arrow aimed at Bonds. 
"llny, ya'll don't want to miss this," Bonds said to get nvnry­onn's attention. 
Nnw r.nnter litddnr and lnadoiT man Dave Hobnrts knelt noxt to Bonds' folding chair to ehat with tho rnsting slugger between rounds ol' BP. 
"It's going to ho intornsling to son how this shakos out," Hobnrts said about tho hype. "We'd be naive not to think he's going to be a big part of this team." 
ehargn, though, could be placed on probation, shn added. 
Smith's only prnvious tral'l'ie infraetion was a 2004 citation for failurn to stop or signal a turn, according to tlw Illinois Sncrntary ol' Statn's oflir.e. 
Wober said last week that 
Smith would sit out the rest of the season, ealling it a mutual agrcenwnt that would allow Smith to "for.us all of his atten­tion on thn physical, emotional, aeademie and othnr relatnd issues hn will l'aee in the coming weeks."

old] on a road trip with one of my amateur teams when one of the dads popped it in," Hanson said. "I was flabber­gasted to see my dad like that -he is normally such a quiet guy around the house." 
Hanson's father, Dave, is most famous for playing the feisty and outspoken Jack Hanson in the film. Jack and his two misfit brothers ­Steve and Jeff-come to the struggling Charleston Chiefs and turn the team around using their legendary unorthodox methods. 
The character is based on the elder Hanson's profes­sional career, which included time with the Detroit Red Wings, Minnesota North Stars and the WHA's Minnesota Fighting Saints. During his 10 years in the pros, Dave Hanson spent nearly as much time in the penalty box as on the ice. He collected more than 2,000 penalty minutes in his career. 
"He actually had bonuses in his contract where if he led the team with penalty minutes he would get more money," Christian Hanson said. 
The younger Hanson, who plays more of a balanced role for the Irish. has only racked up 18 penalty min­utes so far this season. Although he may not exactly be a chip off the old block, Hanson did learn some irre­placeable lessons from his childhood spent in hockey locker rooms. 
"I think I picked up the love of the game from always being around it," Hanson said. 
After his fighting days were over, Dave Hanson became the general manager of the AHL's Albany River Rats, a position he held throughout Christian's upbringing. 
The 6-foot-4 sophomore was raised on stories of his dad's career -like the time he fought Bobby Hull, arguably the greatest left winger to ever lace up skates. While exchanging blows, the older Hanson got a hold of Hull's helmet and tore it off -taking his toupee with it. 
"He threw it in the stands and the next year he got death threats from the fans in Winnipeg," Christian Hanson said. 
Although he respects his father's style of play, Christian considers himself a two-way player -responsi­ble for shutting down oppo­nents and buryi.ng a few goals of his own. The sopho­more had one goal and two assists in his rookie cam­paign and netted five more in the first half of this season. 
He was sidelined for more than a month this season by mononucleosis. He missed eight games with the infec­tion and returned to the Irish lineup last weekend for the CCHA-clinching win over Alaska. Prior to the trip to Fairbanks, the last game the younger Hanson skated in was Notre Dame's 4-1 win over Lake Superior State Jan. 13. 
"It felt great to finally be back in the lineup," he said. "To be able to help the team. out again felt great." 
Hanson and his linemates wasted no time getting back in the swing of things. The trio put one past Nanook goaltender Wylie Rogers ov their very first shift. The goal was eventually disal­lowed, but Hanson had his legs back under him. 
His return was a welcome sight for head coach Jeff Jackson and the rest of the Notre Dame team. Just as the fictional Hanson brothers' arrival lifted the Chiefs to the top of their sport, the Irish hope the return of their own Hanson will help them keep their nine-game unbeaten streak alive against Ferris State in the last two games of the season this weekend.

"We were pissed," said .Falls, who scored 19 points Tuesday. "I don't know how else to say it. That was our motivation." 
The win was Notre Dame's school-record 17th straight at home this season. A win against Marquette Saturday at the Joyce Center would close out an unde­feated home campaign for the Irish. 
"This group deserves that," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "Hopefully we can get one more on Saturday." 
DePaul shot just 34 percent for the game, including 2-for-19 from behind the three-point arc. 
"We haven't played that good on defense in a while," Klirz said. 
Notre Dame, on the other hand, shot 49 percent from the field and hit half of its 18 three-pointers. 
The Irish jumped out to an early 8-1 lead, keyed by five points from Falls. The Blue Demons' first field goal came on a runner by Sammy Mejia with 
16:40 left in the first half. 
DePaul (16-12, 7-7) climbed back into the game, getting to within two at 8-6. but a 10-2 Irish run -including six points from senior guard Russell Carter ­stretched Notre Dame's lead to 18-8 with 13:09left in the game. 
The Irish continued to build their lead, holding the Blue Demons scoreless for a six­minute period and going up 27­12 with six minutes remaining in

the half. 
Notre Dame went on a four­minute scoreless streak of its own, but DePaul could only cut the lead by two points during the stretch. 
"We defended well," Falls said. "Our defense won us this ball game." 
A four-point play by Falls broke the funk and gave the Irish a 40­22 lead at the half. 
After the half, DePaul switched to a full court press and cut the lead to 12 at 45-33, but an 11-2 Notre Dame run keyed by six points from freshman point guard Tory Jackson put the Irish up by 21 with 11 minutes to play. From there, Notre Dame cruised to an easy victory. 
Jackson scored 13 points-11 of them in the second half-and added six assists. He also led the team in rebounds with nine. 
"He attaeked and drove and got everybody confident again," Brey said. 
Tuesday's victory moved the Irish into a tie with Marquette for fourth place in the conference. The top four teams get a bye in the Big East tournament.

Jackson finished with six assists and -despite his 5­foot-1 0 frame -a team-high nine rebounds. 
But if Jackson looked more motivated than usual on the floor, there was good re-ason. On the opposing bench sat Will Walker, whom Michigan chose to recruit instead of Jackson. Even though Walker chose DePaul over the Wolverines, Jackson car­ried the memory of someone saying he was not good enough into Tuesday night.

llis biggest impact has come on the defensive side of the ball. 
When guard Kyle McAlarney was starting earlier in 
Jackson had 
to sharpen his game on the other side of the ball and become the gen­eral of the offense. 
llis confidence in the face of dnfensivo pressure is unwavering, and throughout the course of the season, he has grown more self-assured with his ability to put the ball in the basket. 
Sure, he's missed layups and made a couple of turnovers, and he still needs to work on his jumper, but these are growing pains. The confidence is there, the raw ability is there, and Tuesday night was a big step in refin­ing that talent. 
Even with Jackson's offen­sive responsibilities, Irish coach Mike Brey asked the point guard to shut down some of the best offensive players in the conference. Jackson answered the call and was especially effective against Villanova guard Scottie Heynolds in Notre Dame's 66-63 win Jan. 27, holding him to just 5-for-14 from the field. 
With his talent for lock­down defense and ever­improving offense, Jackson will be one of the marquee players in the Big East in a few years. 

Michigan should be kicking itself right now.

Sweet revenge 
Five score in double figures as Irish avenge Feb. 8 loss to DePaul 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Sports Editor 
All five starters scored in dou­ble figures as Notre Dame earned its third win in six days with a 78-54 victory over DePaul Tuesday at the Joyce Center. 
"We had so many guys play really well," Irish junior forward Rob Kurz said. "I think it was definitely one of our better efforts." 
With the win, Notre Dame (21­6, 9-5 Big East) avenged its 67-66 last-second loss to the Blue Demons Feb. 8, a defeat senior guard Colin Falls called "the worst of[his] career."

Judge declares mistrial in Weis medicaln1alpractice lawsuit 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -A judge declared 

a mistrial Tuesday in Notre 
Dame coach Charlie Weis' 
medical malpractice lawsuit 
after a juror collapsed and 
several doctors -including 
the two defendants -rushed 
to his aid. 
The juror, an older man, began moaning as he listened :to an expert testifying in 
defense of Massachusetts General Hospital surgeons Charles Ferguson and Richard Hodin. Weis claims they botched his care after gastric bypass surgery in June 2002. 
The judge immediately ordered the other jurors out of the courtroom, but some saw Ferguson, Hodin and other doctors who were in the court­room rush to the collapsed juror's aid.

Hoyas limp into JACC to face streaking Irish 
By BILL BRINK Sports Writer 
Riding a five-game win streak, Notre D.ame welcomes struggling Georgetown ­which has lost nine of its last 10 games -to the Joyce Center tonight at 7 p.m. 
Notre Dame (18-8, 9-4 Big East) is 13-1 this season at home and faces a Georgetown team (12-14, 2-11 Big East) that is 1-6 in conference road games and second to last in the conference overall. 
The biggest challenge for the Irish will be the inside play of the Hoyas and junior forward Kieraah Marlow, who leads the team with 16.2 points and 6.8 rebounds per game. 
"Our game plan is still kind of undecided about how we're going to attack them," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said in her bi-monthly conference call. "But we certainly know they can shoot the ball from the perimeter as well as score 
see HOYAS/page 22 

An attorney for Weis said it was with "great reluctance" that he ask for the mistrial in the case that was expected to go to the jury Wednesday. 
"I cannot think of an instance there would be more reason than when a juror has this kind of incident," attorney Michael Mone said. 
A lawyer for the doctors said a mistrial would be unfair to the surgeons, who had

rearranged their schedules to accommodate Weis, who is in the offseason for football. 
Judge Charles Spurlock, however, agreed to grant a mistrial. 
"The integrity of the court is more important than sched­ules," Spurlock said. 
The juror collapsed while lis­tening to the testimony of Dr. David Brooks, an expert who was saying the doctors acted responsibly in their treatment ofWeis. 
Spectators were ordered out of the courtroom shortly after the man fell ill. He was taken away in an ambulance; his condition and identity were not immediately known.
