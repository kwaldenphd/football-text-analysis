Cardinal to give Commencement speech 
Theodore McCarrick will deliver primary address, recieve honorary law doctorate from University 
By KATIE PERALTA 
Assistant News Editor 
The University announced 
Tuesday  that  Cardinal  
Theodore  McCarrick  will  
deliver  the  2008  

Commencement address on May 18. 
Along with delivering the primary speech at the 163rd Commencement exercises, McCarrick. five-year arch­bishop emeritus of Washington, D.C., will receive an honorary doctor of law degree from the University, according to a news release from the University. 
The decision to have McCarrick speak was made within the last couple of weeks, said Dennis Brown, assistant vice president for news and information. 
Brown said the University held off the announcement because the Easter season was so much earlier this year, and the Laetare winner is always announced on Laetare Sunday, the fourth Sunday of Lent. 
"We wanted to give some time between that announce­ment and this one so as not to have too many announce­ments all at once," Brown said. 
Cardinal McCarrick, a native of New York City and graduate of Fordham University and St. Joseph's Seminary, presided over a mass for Fr. Basil Anthony Moreau, founder of the Congregation of the Holy Cross, last September in LeMans, France. The Congregation of the Holy Cross is the religious commu­nity that founded Notre Dame. 
"He was an indispensable participant in our recent and joyful celebration of the beat­ification of Blessed Father Basil Moreau..." University President Fr. John Jenkins said in the statement. 
Cardinal McCarrick visited the University in January when he attended a confer­ence organized in celebration of Father Moreau's first feast day.

University sees a slight drop in applicants but overall quality ofadmitted students strengthens 
By ROHAN ANAND 
News Writer 
The Office of Undergraduate Admissions mailed acceptance letters to 3,523 applicants seeking a spot in the class of 2012, accepting approximately 25 percent of the 14,000 appli­cations received this year. 
Despite the slight decrease in applicants from last year's overall number of 14,501 total applications submitted, Assistant Provost for Undergraduate Admission Daniel Saracino is pleased with this year's results as well as the work the Admissions Committee has put into selecting members of the Class of 2012. 
"Based upon the quality of 
admissions, demographics, and comparison to previous years' Iresults], I can tell you that the projected class should be clearly the strongest academically in our history," he said. 
Academic criteria for selection has remained as competitive in previous years. The average student graduating in the top 5 per­cent of their high school class, Saracino said. The average score on the SAT was 1400, Saracino said, and 32 on the ACT. Additionally, about 23 percent of the members of the incoming class are children of alumni, all 50 states will be repre­sented in the incoming class, 24 percent belong to an eth­

Professor disscusses idea of soul 
Says inorganic matter not necessary for life 
By NIKKI TAYLOR 
News Writer 
Nancey Murphy, an author and professor of Christian Philosophy at Fuller Theological Seminary, spoke about the concept of the soul in a lecture Tuesday called "Neuroscience, Christian Anthropology, and the Role of Women in the Church." 
The lecture was the second of a three-part series on "Science and Religion in the Abrahamic Faiths" at Saint Mary's, a series sponsored by a John Templeton Foundation grant. 
The concept of the soul, Murphy said, encompasses whether or not humans have a soul, if the idea of the soul is necessary to science or reli­gion, and the implications of these ideas. 
A physicalist herself, Murphy believes that due to current advances in biology, the con­cept of a human soul is no longer necessary. 
"With the development of modern biology it is no longer assumed that anything non­physical needs to be added to inorganic matter to produce a living organism; rather, life is due to complex organisms," Murphy said. "Thus, insofar as the soul was understood as the life principle, there is no longer a need for such a concept."

Reish, Sclunidt approve positions at 1st meeting 
By JOSEPH McMAHON Assistant News Editor 
Student body president Bob Reish and vice president Grant Schmidt officially took office Tuesday at their first meeting of the Council of Representatives. 
Reish said he was "setting the agenda for the course of the year" and would focus on issues that are "time sensi­tive," including getting more freshman and transfer stu­dents involved in student gov­ernment and optimizing Webmail. 
"We will always have at least one topic to talk about and discuss," Reish said about COR. "I want there to 
be open dialogue and discus­sion." 
Reish handed out three Skittles to COR members and told them to introduce them­selves and provide informa­tion based on the color of the candy, such as a fact about their family or their future career plans. 
For every red skittle, repre­sentatives had to say some­thing no one knows about them.

Aberration splits dog's left leg in two pieces 
AVON LAKE, Ohio -A developmental problem split Angel the dog's leg, making her look like a five-legged pet. Veterinarian Frank Krupka, with the Avon Lake Animal Clinic in suburban Cleveland, said he's never seen anything like it. 
After examining X-rays, Krupka determined that a genetic aberration split Angel's front left leg in two, leaving her with three nor­mal legs and two distinct parts of a fourth. 
Krupka said the condition doesn't cause pain but gives her problems moving between Sunday afternoon and Monday afternoon. lie remained at large Tuesday but was thought to bn in the San Antonio area, said U.S. Marshals Service spokesman Thomas J. Smith.

Trailer dangers ignored 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A federal scientist said Tuesday his boss­es ignored pleas to alert Gulf Coast hurricane victims earlier about severe health risks from formaldehyde in government­issued trailers and once told him not to write e-mails about his concerns. 
Christopher De Rosa, who until recently was one of the government's top toxicologists, told a congressional panel that he repeatedly raised concerns early last year that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not adequately informing the public of the haz­ard, even as symptoms of dan­gerous exposure were surfac­ing. 
As a result, tens of thousands of families displaced by hurri­canes Katrina and Rita remained in the trailers without full knowledge of the risks, he said. 
"I stated that such clinical signs were a 'harbinger of a pending public health catastro­phe,"' De Rosa said in written testimony, quoting one series of e-mails he wrote to superiors last summer. "I stressed the importance of alerting the trail­er residents to the potential reproductive, developmental and carcinogenic effects ... (but) the only response I received was that such matters should not be discussed in e-mails since they might be 'misinter­preted."' 
De Rosa's comments came Tuesday at a House Science and Technology subcommittee hear­ing on how the CDC and its sis­ter agencies handled com­plaints about trailers issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
Committee Democrats accuse FEMA of manipulating scientific research to downplay the dan­gers. They say the CDC and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, where De Rosa worked, went along with the effort. 
"Your agency failed to protect public health," said Nick Lampson, D-Texas. 
When complaints of possible formaldehyde poisoning sur­faced, FEMA officials insisted in early 2006 that the trailers were safe. But after coming under increasing pressure, FEMA enlisted the CDC's help to test them. 
Formaldehyde, well known as a preservative and embalming fluid, is commonly used in building materials. Prolonged exposure can lead to breathing problems and is also believed to cause cancer. 
The CDC initially said in February 2007 that, with prop­er ventilation, formaldehyde levels were safe in the short­term. FEMA immediately began citing the advisory as evidence that the trailers were safe. 
De Rosa said he protested immediately that the CDC should more aggressively address the matter and that the advisory didn't include broader warnings about longer-term health risks, including for can­cer. 
But it wasn't until February 2008 that the CDC released pre­liminary results from additional testing showing that FEMA trailers and mobile homes had formaldehyde levels that were, on average, about five times higher than in most modern homes. 
The CDC urged people to move as quickly as possible, prompting FEMA to say it would rush to find new housing for some 35,000 families still living in the trailers. 
As they have done previously, De Rosa's bosses at the toxic substances agency, director Howard Frumkin and deputy director Thomas Sinks, acknowledged that the agency took too long to address the formaldehyde hazard, in part because little is known about its risks. 
But they said there was never any effort to silence De Rosa or mislead the public. 
"I regret that our initial work on formaldehyde in trailers did not meet our own expecta­tions," Frumkin said. "In some respects, we could and should have done better." 
The agency is reviewing its procedures, he said, and is planning a five-year study of children who lived in the trail­ers in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. 
Subcommittee Chairman Brad Miller, D-N.C., called De Rosa a whistleblower, noting that the nearly 30-year employ­ee was recently removed from his job and assigned to another division. 
Murphy 
continued from page 1 
Saint Thomas Aquinas wrote elaborately about the purpose and job of the soul. Neuroscientists can now prove many of the traits and tasks Aquinas attributed to the soul to be brain functions, Murphy said. 
"I would elaborate on this claim by emphasizing that these are capacities enabled by our complex neural systems, in interaction with cultural resources, and also resulting from our interaction with God," Murphy said. 
An example of this, she said, is emotion, which Aquinas attributed to the soul. Scientists now know, however, that emo­tion is controlled by the tempo­ral lobe of the brain. When it is damaged a person can recog­nize an object, but not always the emotional significance behind the object, Murphy said. 
Murphy did concede, howev­er, that there is really no way of knowing whether humans have a soul. 
"It is important to note that no such accumulation of data can ever amount to a proof that there is no mind or soul," Murphy said. 
Nonetheless the concept of the soul is one that Murphy believed Christians can and should do without. This, she said, is not a question of sci­ence but rather one of history. When the Bible was being translated from Hebrew to Greek, some of the Hebrew words were translated in terms of Greek philosophy, Murphy 
page 3 
said. 
"The clearest instance of this is the Hebrew word nephesh, which was translated as psyche in the Septuagent and later translated into English as 'soul,"' Murphy said. "It is now widely agreed that nephesh did not mean what later Christians meant by 'soul."' 
Murphy went on to speculate that perhaps women would have been better off had early Christians not believed in body­soul dualism, the idea that humans have both a body and soul. She said the soul was respected over the body, and women were more associated with their bodies, making them of less value than the men who were in tune with their souls. 
Though Murphy does not believe in the soul, she said this does not also mean a disbelief in God. She said while "physi­calism" refers to both the human person an lack of spiri­tual realities, she treats the phrase to refer only to the human person. 
"Physicalist anthropology has no implications regarding the existence of God," Murphy said. 
To wrap up her lecture, Murphy said the physical make­up of humans does not limit their ability to feel emotions. 
"My goal here has been to show that our status as embod­ied creatures in no way contra­dicts the fact of our sociality," Murphy said. "It does not undermine our ability to attain the highest heights of reflective thought, or our capacity to be sustained by deep emotions and motivations."

Britain delays Iraqi troop cuts 
50 percent increase in monthly death toll freezes British plans to withdraw soldiers 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD -Britain froze plans Tuesday to with­draw about 1,500 soldiers this spring after the falter­ing effort to drive Shiite militias from Basra raised doubts whether the Iraqis are capable of maintaining security in oil-rich southern Iraq. 
The British decision was announced in London one week before the top U.S. commander in Iraq appears before Congress to offer his recommendation on how fast America should draw down its own forces. 
Defense Secretary Hobert Gates said Monday in Copenhagen, Denmark that last week's violence in Shiite areas had not changed American plans to withdraw more combat forces by July. · But second thoughts about Iraqi security capa­bilities emerged as Iraq's government reported a 50 percent rise in the number of people killed in March over the previous month. 

Much of the increase was a result of the fighting between Iraqi government forces and Shiite militiamen in the southern city of Basra.

IN BRIEF 
Senate seeks to advance housing bill 
Wi\SIIINGTON -Under growing pressure from voters to do something about the nation's home foreclosure crisis, top Senate leaders agreed Tuesday to at least start with a plan that can win the support of both Democrats and Republicans. 
The pact between Majority Leader Harry Heid, D-Nev., and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., ended weeks of partisan bickering over what to do about the crisis in the housing market and the toxic effect it's having on the economy. . 
There is considerable common ground on several steps that can be taken to improve the situation, but battles over how to structure the debate had threatened to produce gridlock. 
Heid agreed not to bring up a Democratic plan containing a controversial provision ­strongly opposed by Republicans and President Bush -to give bankruptcy judges power to cut interest rates and principal on troubled mortgages. That plan stalled a month ago. 
Fed approves JP Morgan acquisition 
Wi\SIIINGTON -The Federal Reserve on Tuesday deared the way for JP Morgan Chase &. Co. to acquire Bear Stearns' bank holdings. 
The approval allows JP Morgan to acquire Bear Stearns Bank &. Trust in Princeton, N.J., tim Fnd said. 
In a controversial move, the Fed last month baeked a $29 billion lifeline as part of JP Morgan's takeover of troubled Bear Stearns, the nation's fifth-largest investment house, which was on the brink of bankruptcy. The eompany had invested hoavily in risky mort­gage-backed securities that eventually soured with the collapse of the housing market. 
.JP Morgan is not required to obtain the Fed's prior approval to acquire Bear Stearns Cos., the Fed said in a brief statement. 
Bears Stearns Bank &. Trust operates in New Jersey and is the 45th-largest bank in the state, controlling deposits of approximate­ly $398 million, the Fed said. Upon comple­tion of this acquisition. JP Morgan would remain the country's third-largest bank, the Fed said.

Congress pressures oil executives 
Companies argue record fuel prices are not their fault, consistent with industry 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Don't blame us, oil industry chiefs told a skeptical Congress. 
Top executives of the country's five biggest oil companies said Tuesday they know record fuel prices are hurting people, but they argued it's not their fault and their huge profits are in line with other industries. 
Appearing before a House committee, the executives were pressed to explain why they should continue to get billions of dollars in tax breaks when they made $123 billion last year and motorists are paying record gasoline prices at the pump. 
"On April Fool's Day, the biggest joke of all is being played on American fami­lies by Big Oil," Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said, aiming his remarks at the five executives sitting shoulder-to-shoulder in a congressional ·hearing room. 

"Our earnings, although high in absolute terms, need to be viewed in the context of the.scale and cyclical, long-term nature of our industry as well as the huge investment requirements," said J.S.

CHINA 
Dalai Lama, Tibet accused of violence 
Associated Press 
BEIJING -China has branded 

the Dalai Lama a "wolf in monk's 
robes" and his followers the 
"scum of Buddhism." It stepped 
up the rhetorie Tuesday, accus­
ing the Nobel Peace laureate and 
his supporters of planning sui­
cide attacks. 
The Tibetan government-in­

exile swiftly denied the charge, 
and the Bush administration 
rushed to the Tibetan Buddhist 
leader's defense, calling him "a 
man of peace." 
"There is absolutely no indica­

tion that he wanl'> to do anything 
other than have a dialogue with 
China on how to discuss the seri­
ous issues there," State 
Department spokesman Tom 
Casey said. 
Wu Ileping, spokesman for 

China's Ministry of Public 
Security, claimed searches of 
monasteries in the Tibetan capi­
tal had turned up a large cache 
of weapons. They included 1.76 
guns, 13,013 bullets, 7,725 
pounds of explosives, 19,000 
sticks of dynamite and 350 
knives, he said. 
"To our knowledge, the next 

plan of the Tibetan independ­
ence forces is to organize suicide 
squads to launch violent 
attacks," Wu told a news confer­
ence. "They elaimed that they 
lear neither bloodshed nor sacri­
fice." 
Wu provided no details or evi­
dnnee. lin usnd the term "gan si 
dui," a rarely used phrase 
dirnctly translated as "dare-to­
die corps." The ol'fieial English 
version of his remarks translated 
tho torm as "suicide squads." 
Wu said police had arrested an individual who he elaimed was an operative of the "Dalai Lama dique," responsible for gather­ing intelligonce and distributing pamphlnts calling for an upris­ing. 
The suspect admitted to using codn words to communicate with his contacts. including "uncle" for the Dalai Lama and "skirts" for the bannnd Tibetan snow lion flag. Wu said. 
Bnijing has mpeatedly accused the Dalai Lama and his support­ers of orchestrating violence in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital. Protests which began peacefully there on the March 10 anniver­sary of a 1959 uprising against Chinese rule spiraled out of con­trol four days later. 
Chinese o!licials have put the fjeath toll at 22, most of them Han Chinese; the government-in­exile says 140 Tibetans were killed. 
China also says sympathy protests that spread to sur­rounding provinces are part of a campaign by the Dalai Lama to sabotage the Beijing Olympics and promotn Tibntan indnpend­nncn. 
Tho 72-yoar-old Dalai Lama has condnmned the violenen and denied any links to it, urging an independent international inquiry into tlw unrnst. 
"Tibetan nxilns are 100 per­cent committed to nonviolnncn. Thorn is no question of' suicide attacks," Sarndhong Hinpoehe, prirnn rninistnr of the govnrn­men1-in-nxiiP in Dharmsala, India. said Tunsday. "But we fear that Chinese might masquerade as Tibetans and plan such attacks to giv1~ bad publicity to Tibetans." 
Experts on tnrrorism and secu­rity risks facing Beijing and the 
Olympics have not cited any 
Tibet group as a threat. 
Scholars said the claim of sui­
cide squads was a calculated 
move by China allowing it to step 
up its crackdown in Tibetan 
areas. 
'There is no evidence of sup­
port for any kind of violence 
against China or Chinese," said 
Dibyesh Anand, a Tibet expert at 
Westminster University in 
London. 
Instead, Beijing is "portraying 
to the rest of China and the rest 
of the world: these people are 
basically irrational" and that 
there was no room for compro­
mise, he said. 
Tuesday's accusations could 
also further divide the Tibetan 
government-in-exile and other 
groups like the Tibetan Youth 
Congress, which has challenged 
the Dalai Lama's policy of nonvi­
olence, Anand said. 
"This is a way of pressuring 
the Dalai Lama to renounce 
Tibetans who have created vio­
lence," he said. 
Andrew Fischer, a fellow at the 
London School of Economics 
who researches Chinese devel­
opment policies in Tibetan areas 
of China, dismissed Wu's warn­
ings as "completely ridiculous." 
What China is trying to do "is justify this massive troop deploy­ment, a massive crackdown on Tibetan areas and they're trying to justify intensification of hard­line policies," Fischer said. 
Drawing from a deep historical 
reserve of angry rhetoric, Tibet's 
tough-talking Chinese 
Communist Party boss, Zhang 
Qingli, recently called the Dalai 
Lama a "wolf in monk's robes, a 
devil with a human face, but the 
heart of a beast" and deemed 
the current conflict a "life-and­
death battle." State media has 
denounced protesting monks as 
the "scum of Buddhism." 
The campaign against the Dalai Lama has been under­scored in recent days with show­ings of decades-old propaganda films on state television portray­ing Tibetan society as cruel and primitive before the 1950 inva­sion by communist troops. 
The escalation of the rhetoric to inelude claims of possible sui­cide attacks may also touch upon another sensitive issue for China's communist leadership­unrest in Xinjiang, a predomi­nantly Muslim region to Tibet's north, and Beijing's tight security measures in the area. 
Last month, state media reported that a woman had con­fessed to attempting to hijack and crash a Chinese passenger plane from Xinjiang in what ofli­cials say was part of a terror campaign by a radical Islamic independence group, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement. The reports said the woman was from China's Turkic Muslim Uighur minority. 
While the United States has labeled the East Turkestan Islamic Movement a terrorist organization, the State Department alleges widespread abuses of the legal and educa­tional systems by the communist authorities to suppress Uighur culture and religion. 
Fischer said China has tried to change the "nonviolent, compas­sionate" image of Tibetans into one of violence and brutality to draw parallels to the pro-inde­pendence stance in Xinjiang.

DENMARK 
U.S. negotiates tnilitary defense deal 
Russians assured that sites will not be activated in neighboring Poland 
 
Associated Press 
COPENHAGEN -Scrambling to seal a missile defense deal this weekend, the U.S. is offering guarantees to assure the Russians the system isn't a European military threat aimed at them. 
A key pledge: The U.S. won't activate new sites in Poland and the Czech Republic unless Iran proves itself an imminent threat . to Europe by test-flying a missile capable of reaching the continent. 
A broader but less-specific agreement seems assured when President Bush sits down with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. That would be a "strate­gic framework" for relations between the two countries after Bush and Putin leave office. 
But the White House seems to think there could be a bigger breakthrough, on the defense sys­tem to guard Europe against a missile attack from Iran or else­where. 
The proposed limitation linked to Iran testing is one of several measures designed to assuage Russian security concerns. It's not yet clear whether they are enough to persuade Moscow to go along. 
"Obviously, we've got a lot of work to do to allay suspicions and old fears, but I think we're mak­ing pretty good progress along those lines," Bush said Tuesday. He spoke in Kiev, Ukraine, before flying to Romania for a NATO summit where missile defense ­including some Europeans' wor­ries about Russia's strong objec­tions -will be on the agenda. Bush would like NATO to announce its support.

Third-graders plot to kill teacher 
Children brought knife, handcuffs, duct tape to school as weapons 
Associated Press 
WAYCROSS, Ga. -A group of third-graders plotted to attack their teacher, bringing a broken steak knife, handcuffs, duct tape and other items for the job and assigning children tasks including covering the windows and clean­ing up afterward, police said Tuesday. 
The plot involving as many as nine boys and girls at Center Elementary School in south Georgia was a serious threat, Waycross Police Chief Tony Tanner said. 
School officials alerted police Friday after a pupil tipped off a teacher that a girl had brought a weapon to school. Tanner said the students apparently planned to knock the teacher unconscious with a crystal paperweight, bind her with the handcuffs and tape and then stab her with the knife. 
"We did not hear anybody say they intended to kill her, but could they have accidentally killed her? Absolutely," Tanner said. "We feel like if they weren't interrupted, there would have been an attempt. Would they have been successful? We don't know." 
The children, ages 8 to 10, were apparently mad at the teacher because she had scolded one of them for standing on a chair, Tanner said. 
Two of the students were arrested on juvenile charges 
Tuesday and a third arrest was expected. District Attorney Rick Currie said other students told investigators they didn't take the plot seriously or insisted they had decided not to participate. 
"Some of the kids said, 'We thought they were just kidding,"' Currie said. "Another child was supposed to bring a toy pistol, and he told a detective he didn't bring it because he thought he would get in trouble." 
Currie said the children are too young to be charged as adults, and probably too young to be sen­tenced to a youth detention cen­ter. 
Police seized a steak knife with a broken handle, steel handcuffs, duct tape, electrical and transpar­ent tape, ribbons and the paper­weight from the students, Tanner said. 
Currie said he decided to seek juvenile charges against two girls, ages 9 and 10, who brought the knife and paperweight and an 8­year-old boy who brought tape. He said all three students faced charges of conspiracy to commit aggravated assault, and both girls were being charged with bringing weapons to school. 
Nine children have been given discipline up to and including long-term suspension, said Theresa Martin, spokeswoman for the Ware County school sys­tem. She would not be more spe­cific but said none of the children had been back to school since the · case came to light. 
The purported target is a veter­an educator who teaches third­grade students with learning dis­abilities, including attention deficit disorder, delayed develop­ment and hyperactivity, friends and parents said. 
The scheme involved a division of roles, Tanner said. One child's job was to cover windows so no one could see outside, he said. Another was supposed to clean up after the attack. 
"We're not sure at this point in the investigation how many of the students actually knew the intent was to hurt the teacher," Tanner said. 
He said the teacher told detec­tives the children involved weren't known as troublemakers. 
"You can't dismiss it," Tanner said. "But because they are kids, they may have thought this was like a cartoon -we do whatever and then she stands up and she's OK. That's a hard call." 
The parents of the students have cooperated with investiga­tors, who aren't allowed to ques­tion the children without their parents' or guardians' consent, he said. Authorities have withheld the children's names. 
Martin told The Florida Times­Union of Jacksonville, Fla., that administrators would follow school system policy and state law in disciplining the students. 
CUBA 

Castro encourages consumer goods 
Associated Press 
HAVANA-Cubans snapped up DVD players, motorbikes and pressure cookers for the first time Tuesday as Raul Castro's new government loos­ened controls on consumer goods and invited private farmers to plant tobacco, cof­fee and other crops on unused -state land. 
Combined with other reforms announced in recent days, the measures suggest real changes are being driven by the new president, who vowed when he took over from his brother Fidel to remove some of the more irksome limi­tations on the daily lives of Cubans. 
Analysts wondered how far the communist government is willing to go. 
"Cuban people can't survive on the salaries people are pay­ing them. Average men and women have been screaming that at the top of their lungs for many years," said Felix Masud-Piloto, director of the Center for Latino Research at DePaul University. "Now after many years, the government is listening." 
Many of the shoppers filling stores Tuesday lamented the fact that the goods are unaf­fordable on the government salaries they earn. But that didn't stop them from lining up to see electronic gadgets previ­ously available only to foreign­ers and companies. 
"They should have done this a long time ago," one man said as he left a store with a red and silver electric motorbike that cost $814. The Chinese­made bikes can be charged with an electric cord and had been barred for general sale because officials feared a strain on the power grid. 
On Monday, the Tourism Ministry announced that any Cuban with enough money can now stay in luxury hotels and rent cars, doing away with restrictions that made ordinary people feel like second-class citizens. And last week, Cuba said citizens will be able to get cell phones legally in their own names, a luxury long reserved for the lucky few. 
The land initiative, however, potentially could put more food on the table of all Cubans and bring in hard currency from exports of tobacco, coffee and other products, providing the cash inflows needed to spur a new consumer economy. 
Government television said 51 percent of arable land is underused or fallow, and offi­cials are transferring some of it to individual farmers and associations representing small, private producers. According to official figures, cooperatives already control 35 percent of arable land ­and produce 60 percent of the island's agricultural output. 
"Everyone who wants to pro­duce tobacco will be given land to produce tobacco, and it will be the same with coffee," said Orlando Lugo, president of Cuba's national farmers associ­ation. 
The change is a sharp con­trast to the early days of Cuba's revolution, when the government forced or encour­aged private farmers to turn their land over to the state or form government-controlled collective farms. But without more details, it was difficult to tell the significance of pro­gram, which began last year but was announced only this week. 

"If this means all land that's not being used, like for private farmers, cooperatives and state farms, is available, that's positive," said Carmelo Mesa­Lago, a Cuba economics expert at the University of Pittsburgh. "Assuming, of course, they have the freedom to sow and sell whatever they want." 
Lines formed before the doors opened at the Galerias Paseos shopping center on Havana's famed seaside Malecon boulevard, and shop­pers wasted little time once inside. But there was no sign yet of computers and microwaves, highly anticipated items that clerks across Havana insisted would appear soon on store shelves, with desktop computers retailing for around $650. 
Cuba's communist system was founded on promoting social and economic equality, but that doesn't mean Cubans can't have DVD players, said Mercedes Orta, who rushed to gawk at the new products. 
"Socialism has nothing to do with living comfortably," she said. 
Lines outside electronics boutiques and specialty shops are common in Cuba because guards limit how many people can be inside at a time. But waits were longer and aisles more packed than usual at Havana's best-known stores. 
"DVDs are over there, down that aisle," an employee in a white short-sleeved shirt repeated over and over as shoppers wandered into La Copa, an electronics and gro­cery store across from the Copacabana Hotel. 
"Very good! DVD players on sale for everybody," exclaimed Clara, an elderly woman peer­ing at a black JVC console. "Of course nobody has the money to buy them." Like many Cubans, Clara chatted freely but wouldn't give her full name to a foreign reporter. 
Government stores offered all products in convertible pesos -hard currency worth 24 times the regular pesos state employees get paid. The government controls well over 90 percent of the economy and the average state salary is just 408 regular pesos a month, about $19.50. 
Still, most Cubans have access to at least some con­vertible pesos thanks to jobs with foreign firms or in tourism, or cash sent by rela­tives living in the United States. 
Graciela Jaime, a 68-year­old retired clothes factory employee, complained that widespread corruption and greed has created a class of rich Cubans. 
"Everyone wants to spend money and that is what's hap­pening," she said. "If every­thing they earned went to the state like it should, there wouldn't be as much corrup­tion as there is." 

differences on missile defense, their meeting still might be declared a success if, as expected, the two men say they have an understanding on the most important issues that Washington and Moscow should deal with as both capitals transition to new leaders. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday in Moscow the document setting out a "strategic vision of the future" should be adopted at the Bush­Putin meeting. It will touch on the tough issues in Russian-U.S. rela­tions, he said. 
U.S. officials have said that a "strategic framework," or agenda for further talks, is intended to highlight areas of agreement between the former Cold War foes -such as their efforts against global terrorist networks -and indicate that relations hold promise for the future. 
The framework probably would mention missile defense as well as future arms reductions negoti­ations, although it would not nec­essarily mean the two sides agree on solutions in those areas. For example, it probably would not include a Russian statement in support of U.S. missile defense in Europe but would say this is among the high-priority issues that future administrations should address, along with NATO. 
Putin is to be succeeded as president in early May by Dmitry Medvedev, and Bush will leave office in January. 
In remarks prepared for deliv­ery Wednesday in Bucharest, Bush highlighted his push for missile defense. 
"The need for missile defense in Europe is real and it is urgent," he said. "Iran is pursuing technol­ogy that could be used to produce nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles of increasing range that could deliver them."

Hecent events in Tibet have intensi­fied calls for a boycott of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. The United States has seen increased pressure from human rights groups but broad bipartisan support 
Zach Einterz
for the Beijing 
Games is unlikely 
to change, and Bulletproof this past week­Ideas end, both Nancy 
Pelosi and Condoleezza Rice reiterat­ed that the U.S. would not pursue a boycott. 
For once, our government officials are doing something right; minding their own business and refraining from making a decision that isn't theirs to make. As with all things, the decision to boycott the Olympics should be a matter of individual choice, not government coercion. 
A boycott of the Olympics punishes athletes who have spent many years in training and made countless sacri­fices to get to the top of their sport. Amnriean athletes shouldn't be forced to abandon lifelong goals so that our political elite can satisfy their arro­gant opportunism. 
Furthermore, past experience has shown that Olympic boycotts do not bring about political change. The Soviet Union in 1980 and the U.S. in 1984 both emerged from their respective Games with an even gre~;tter sense of pride. A boycott of the Beijing Olympics by the U.S. would be seen by the Chinese people as an unjust attack on their country. It would likely strengthen the Chinese regime at home and fan the flames of nationalism. 
Even if the U.S. wanted to boycott the Games, it would have a hard time justifying it without sounding hypo­critical. Human rights activists argue that China's support for the Sudan and its unwillingness to pressure the Sudanese government to bring recon­ciliation to Darfur is reason enough for an Olympic boycott. China buys two-thirds of Sudan's oil exports and in turn, sells weapons to the Sudanese government. However, China's military and economic sup­port for Sudan is hardly different from our military and economic sup­port for repressive and unpopular governments in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Pakistan. 

China is also repeatedly criticized for domestic human rights violations, including its suppressions of political dissidents, restrictions on freedom of the press, and discrimination against ethnic minorities. Yet as long as the 
U.S. authorizes unjust war, rendition, torture, capital punishment, and domestic spying, our rhetoric on human rights will sound a lot like self-righteous grandstanding. China's one-child policy is considered by many to be authoritarian and morally repugnant, but it is no less benign than the United States' sanction of the 1.2 million abortions that are per­formed in our country every year. 
Undoubtedly, China's abuses are of a greater degree than ours, but there can be no denying that America's for­eign policy tactics and failure to uphold basic civil rights has resulted in the loss of our moral credibility within the international community. Until the U.S. gets its own house in order, we will have trouble convinc­ing China to do the same to theirs. 
The absence of a government-man­dated boycott does not prohibit any­one from boycotting the Games under their own will. Corporations have the right to pull their sponsorship, indi­vidual athletes can choose to sit out, and sports fans all over the world have the right not to watch the Games. 
Several European politicians have already rejected invitations to attend the opening ceremonies. German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced on Friday that she would not be attending the opening ceremonies, while Nicolas Sarkozy and Gordon Brown are determining whether they will follow suit. These politicians understand that the decision to boy­cott the Games is an individual choice and they will not make their country­men suffer for their own politieal agenda. 
If the international community has learned anything from the unease surrounding the upcoming Olympies, it's that they should not have reward­ed China with the Games in the first place. Back in 2001, the IOC chose China as host for the 200H Olympics because they thought the Games would encourage openness. In the future, the IOC should wait until a country commits to openness, and then reward them with the Olympics. But for now, we should let the Games begin.

The Tyranny of Title IX 
On March 23, the University of Iowa regained its place in American collegiate wrestling. Behind Brent Metcalf, 2008 NCAA tournament Most Outstanding Wrestler, Iowa claimed its first team championship since 2000. Between 1975 and 2000, Iowa won an astounding 20 team titles, 15 of them under the leadership of coach Dan Gable, the leg­endary wrestler who won an Olympic

gold medal while not surrendering a single point during Dome and the tournament, at Domer a time when the sport was dominated by the Soviet bloc. Now the Hawkeyes reign again, led by coach Tom Brands, one of Gable's former wrestlers. 
Sadly, Notre Dame didn't do so well­no NO wrestlers advanced to the finals. That's because there are no NO wrestlers. NO wrestling was cut back in 1992, a casualty of the Education Amendment Act's Title IX, which requires that no per­son shall, on the basis of sex, be denied the benefits of any education program or activity receiving federal financial assis­tance. As written. the law is quite unob­jectionable. As implemented, though, it's been destructive and stupid. 
Judges, bureaucrats, and college administrators have interpreted the law to demand "statistical proportionality" ­so if a school's student body is 60% female, then 60% of its scholarship ath­letes must be too. Never mind that, from earliest childhood, boys are far more interested in athletic competition than girls are, or that everyone else is general­ly more interested in boys' competition too. 
The situation would be bad enough without football, which itself accounts for 85 scholarships. With that 'many scholar­ships on one side, it's hard to balance the ledger, especially since athletic directors have sometimes been unable to add women's teams because they can't attract enough interested girls to fill them. So schools often cut men's programs instead. 
The case of football shows how ridicu­lous this balancing act is. Football pro­grams, especially at places like NO, gen­erate revenue and publicity for their schools. Moreover, football scholarships often go to recipients whose families might otherwise struggle to afford col­lege. Can any of this be said of, oh, women's golf? Doesn't matter-to the NCAA, collectively affiicted with that mental disease known as political cor­rectness, there's no difference between giving a scholarship to someone like Chris Zorich to play a sport people actually pay money to watch, and who might suffer for years from injuries sustained in playing it hard, and giving one to a girl whose pri­vate high school had its own golf course. As for the justification I often heard bandied about in guys' dorms, that female athletes serve the important role of "comfort women" for the football team: even if this were true, the football team would perform better without such "com­fort". 
Obviously, I'm not entirely sold on ath-

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Vaginas burg 

I, like most of the Notre Dame community, eagerly anticipate the 71st and 72nd Viewpoint articles that will be published tomorrow focusing on the controversy surrounding the recent performance of the Vagina Monologues on our pure campus. This is a very impor­tant topic that needs to be discussed, for we all know that this issue significantly affects our daily lives. 
For example, few know that Eve Ensler herself orchestrated the suicide bomber attack 8 years ago on the U.S.S. Cole off the coast of Yemen. Also, it is not commonly known that the skit titled "My Angry Vagina" single-handedly brought down the housing industry, which sent this country spiraling into a recession. Clearly something must be done and we must act now! So what can you do? How can you stop Eve Bin Laden and her angry vagina? It's simple. All Notre Dame stu­dents are eligible to vote on May 6th in the Indiana Presidential Primary, as long as they have yet to vote in any other primary or caucus this year. 
Though the Republican race is pretty much over, Indiana will for the first time in 40 years play a crucial role in settling the Democratic race for the nomination. Pennsylvania seems to be leaning Sen. Clinton's way, while Sen. Obama will probably enjoy victory in North Carolina. This likely scenario leaves Indiana as the largest state remaining up for grabs. 
Both candidates understand the importance of this primary, which explains the countless number of cam­paign stops that will surely take place in our area dur­ing the next 4-5 weeks. You can fmd a copy of the regis­tration form at Indiana's Secretary of State website (http://www.in.gov/sos/electionsl}. After filling out the forrn, you can send it to the specified address yourself or contact me (mwells1@nd.edu) about campus drop-off spots. The deadline to register is next Monday April 7. 
Remember: By registering to vote, you are one step closer to stopping Ensler's Fourth Reich. Act now or else don't be surprised when you fmd out that Vaginasburg, Oklahoma has been declared the new nation's capital.

letic scholarships. For sports like football and basketball which earn money and press for the school, maybe, and even then I think the scholarships should be need-based. But if NO's going to give out other scholarships, then it ought to have a wrestling team. 
I don't have space for the defense wrestling deserves, and I'm no worthy apologist. But I do believe wrestling, more than any other mainstream sport, devel­ops those qualities that will help a boy someday become a good and noble man. Someone who doesn't even have what it takes to step out on a wrestling mat with­out his teammates, in front of many eyes, knowing he might get seriously hurt ­and even worse, terribly humiliated ­how can he be expected to do the right thing in life? Wrestling's hopelessly work­ing-class, God bless it, and wrestlers are vastly over-represented in the armed forces. For me, it was well worth the injuries, eating disorders, and cauliflower ear (no those last two aren't related!). 
NO needs a wrestling team and it needs wrestlers. But I don't expect NO to bring back wrestling because it's right, and I certainly don't expect NO to court the dis­approval of the federal government -the Church, sure, but not the Holy Government. So here's a solution. Make wrestling co-ed. Allow women to try out for the team. Of course, none will make it (those who would are encouraged to con­tact mere: breeding wrestlers), but it would be impossible to claim women were denied those scholarships on the basis of sex. 
I hope readers won't conclude I have some animus against women's sports -I don't. !.enjoyed going to women's soccer, volleybafi, and basketball games as an undergrad, and since she was tiny I've tried to push my niece into soccer (she's always preferred kittens and puppies). It's a hallmark of political correctness, though, that it pits one group against another. There's no inherent rivalry between wrestling and women's tennis. In a perfect world, wrestlers would pay no attention to women's tennis programs, like everyone else. But Title IX creates resentment where there was none before, just as "affirmative action" {what an exquisitely Orwellian term!) makes com­petitors out of minorities and, as Barack­our-hope-and-our-salvation would put it, a "typical white person" like me. Zero­sum class-warfare economics is another example. 
The Title IX problem is just going to get 
worse, as schools' student bodies become 
increasingly majority-female. More pro­
grams will be eliminated. Until NO cuts to 
the chase and re-names its teams the 
Peacing Multiculties, we're still the 
Fighting Irish. Wrestling's the only inter­
collegiate sport that even comes close to 
fighting. Let's bring it back to Notre 
Dame. 

Greg Yatarola is a 1999 alumnus. He'd 
like to congratulate Indiana University's 
125-pound-class national champion, whose arm was ripped out ofsocket in ·the quarterfinals but who finished the 
match and went on to win the semifinals 
and finals. 

The views expressed in this column 
are those ofthe author and not 
necessarily those of The Observer. 
Defining pro-life 
Congressman Joe Donnelly's visit to the law school last week and the accompanying article in the Observer ("Donnelly expands pro-life definition," Mar. 
27) made the often-seen but critical error of expand­ing a definition to the point that it means everything -and therefore means nothing. Donnelly argued that school lunches, job creation, and welfare checks to pregnant mothers are just as much "pro-life" issues as abortion, embryo-destructive research, and euthanasia are. 
There is a certain appeal to his logic, since one can easily see that kids who eat have a better life than kids who don't eat, that families whose parents have jobs generally have better lives than those that don't, and pregnant women who get government support may choose less abortion less than those that don't. That appeal, however, evaporates when you take that logic to its conclusion. Are federal highway bills mak­ing highways more safe and efficient -thus prevent­ing accidents and encouraging job creation -there­fore "pro-life?" Are subsidies to farmers to grow corn "pro-life?" How about gun safety regulation? Warnings on cigarette cartons? Free trade (or protec­tionism)? 
You can literally attach a "pro-life" moniker to every good or bad or medium-rare idea that a politician has using Donnelly's definition. A "definition" with no lim­iting principle is no definition at all. Pro-life is a pretty general term if used in a vacuum, but in 2008, 35 years after Roe, 16 years after Casey, and in the con­text of the fight to preserve the right to live itself that has followed, it is not. It means ending abortion, euthanasia, and embryo-destructive research. It means stopping the destruction of life, not making 
those that are already here better. 
Does that make Donnelly's ideas wrong or evil? Certainly not. Maybe they are good ideas, maybe not. But they are not "pro-life" issues, and they should not be thrown up as being somehow equivalent or on the same scale of importance as those issues that are pro­life. Killing a child is not the same on the moral order as not feeding the child lunch. Supporting the Democratic Party today, whether in Congress or in the White House, continues to be a vote against the pro­life cause. A vote for a democrat is a vote for a House leadership that is intractably opposed to protecting life. House rules mean that the priorities of Pelosi's leadership dominates -denying access for any pro­,life bills to the floor. You can't install a party leader­ship who believes in abortion as a matter of "repro­ductive justice" and a fundamental right and expect to have a pro-life direction. 
Donnelly's "nay" votes are admirable, but it was his vote for Pelosi that created the necessity for such a vote -and foreclosed the possibility of a "yes" vote on any life-protective laws. Same goes for voting for a pro abortion president, as Obama and Clinton have both promised nominees to the Supreme Court who will continue to enshrine Roe. Pro-life voters would do well to remember that in November.

In his seventh solo offering, Bob Mould gives us "District Line." Well crafted, it is a welcome fol­low-up to 2005's "Body of Song," featuring more of the rocking and thrashing sounds that made Mould a legend in bands such as Husker Oil and Sugar. Teaming up with the explosive of Fugazi

catchy chords and melodies, writes emotive lyrics to go along with the music and then infuses his own soul and spirit into the words and tabs on the page to make the songs live and breathe on their own. 
At this point in his career, there is an added ele­ment to the recording on "District Line" that is distinctly Mould. After years of personal strife and confusion, Mould seems to be a happily adjusted gay American man in his late 40s. No longer struggling to keep his most private details out of the public eye, Mould now engages with his

music and his listeners in a liberating and excit­ing expression of freedom; freedom to become the person that one is intrinsically designed to be and to share the unique art that only that person can create. 
The first track on the record, "Stupid Now," is the throbbing rock track Husker and Sugar fans have been thirsting. The song gives voice to a man working out his clearly conflicting feelings 
about sharing and saying too much from the heart to someone who sadly does not care enough. 
The first· verse is delivered in a decidedly straightforward nature, with each following verse becom­ing more and more digitized and echoed. 
The words bound across the indelible space of the song, receiving no response from the one desired listener. Mould finish­es by belting out repeatedly· in a full shout, "Haven't I been enough of a fool for you? I Everything I say to you feels stupid now." It is 
raw rock-and-roll music, yet also deeply emotion­al and sad, which makes it rather distinctly bril­liant. 
A few of the songs can run the fine line of being a bit too cliche. The lyrics, while coming from an honest well of inspiration, do at times feel a bit junior high sentimental and sweet. One particu­larly enjoyable line, which is just a bit weak for Mould's, is found on the track "Old Highs New Lows" as he sings, "We lock the gaze tightly upon each other/ No others come near, no others come 
between." With so many depressing sentiments 
shared across the tracks of the record, such lyrics are a welcome, if momentary, respite from the obvious emotional tribulations being so honestly shared. 
Overall, it's a great record. It moves along with refreshing speed and musical punch, not allowing the listener much time to dwell on any one song or moment before being thrust into a new sphere of sound and lyric sensation. Mould has created a record that tells us its okay to be sad, just like its okay to sometimes be alone, especially when its not the shallow impulses of others, but only ourselves, who can bring us out of the darkness of melancholy and into the fresh light of new experience and new da.

Associated Press 
PALM BEACH, Fla. -Bill Belichick insists there are no new revelations to come about Spygate. 
"I think they've addressed everything they possibly can address," the New England Patriots coach said during the AFC coaches breakfast at the NFL meetings, disclosing he was reinterviewed after the Super Bowl about alle­gations that former team employee Matt Walsh had illegal tapes. 
''I've addressed so many . questions so many times from so many people I don't know what else the league could ask." 
Commissioner Roger Goodell confirmed that the NFL spoke again with Belichick and other Patriots employees after last January's Super Bowl loss to the New York Giants. The league has been negotiating an agree­ment with Walsh that it hopes will get Walsh, a golf pro in Hawaii, to come for­ward with what he has. 
"We followed up on other things because certain things had been tossed out," Goodell said of the added round of interviews with Belichick and other members of the Patriots front office. 
This was the first time anyone disclosed that Belichick and other Patriots staffers were rein­terviewed after the Super Bowl, when the Walsh alle­gations surfaced. The first interviews actually came the day before the Super Bowl with player personnel director Scott Pioli; Stacey James, the team's vice president for media rela­tions; and video director Jimmy Dee. 

League officials subse­quently interviewed owner Robert Kraft and Belichick, as he disclosed on Tuesday. "I talked to four or five people," Belichick said, although he did not say if it was in person or by tele­phone. 
Spygate developed after the first game of the sea­son, when tapes of the New York Jets' defensive signals were confiscated from a Patriots employee on the sideline. Belichick was 
IN BRIEF Rodriguez to earn more 
than entire Marlins roster 
NEW YORK -Alex Rodriguez makes more this year than his hometown Florida Marlins. 
Boosted by his new deal with the New York Yankees, A-Hod tops the major league baseball salary list at $28 million, according to a study of contract terms by The Associated Press. The 33 players on the Marlins' opening-day roster and disabled fu.t total $21.8 million. 
"The Marlins? It's amazing," Rodriguez said. "And they still seem to find a way to be very eompetitive. They have a great pool of talent; they made some unbelievable trades, so they have great personnel peo­ple. To win two championships in 11 years, that's really admirable, and I'm very proud of that organization, being from Miami." 
For the first time in baseball hi<>t.ory, the average salary topped the $3 million mark. The 855 players on opening-day rosters and the DL averaged $3.15 million, up 7.1 percent from last year's starting average of $2.94 million. 

House urges Bush not to 
attend Beijing Olympics 
WASHINGTON -Fifteen House members, citing China's human rights abuses, on Tuesday urged President Bush to reconsider his decision to attend the Olympic Games in Beijing this summer. 
"It would be clearly inappropriate for you to attend the Olympic Games in China, given the increasingly repressive nature of that country's government," the lawmakers wrote in a letter organized by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. 
The letter was signed by 14 Democrats and Republican Dana Rohrabacher of California, a long­time critic of the Chinese govern­ment. 
The letter cited China's recent crackdown of protests in Tibet, the Beijing government's close economic ties with the government of Sudan and recent suppression of religious and human rights advocates. 
fined $500,000, the team was fined $250,000 and was stripped of its first­round draft choice. 
The Patriots ended up becoming the first team to finish the regular season 16-0. They won two playoff games, but were upset 17­14 in the Super Bowl by the Giants. 
The Walsh allegations came out two days before that title game, although Belichick said they weren't a distraction in the game. And he vehemently denied the Patriots taped a Rams walkthrough before that 2002 Super Bowl, which the two-touchdown underdog Patriots won 20-1 7. 
"''ve never seen a tape of another team's practice. Ever!" he said Tuesday. "Certainly not that one." 
Sutton resigns after poor
second season 
STILLWATER, Okla. -Oklahoma State basketball coach Sean Sutton resigned under pressure Tuesday fol­lowing a 17-16 season. 
Athletic director Mike Holder met with Sutton on Monday to discuss the 
-

state of the program. The move comes almost two weeks after Sutton completed his second season. 
In a statement released by the uni­versity, Holder called this a "sad day for me personally and this universi­ty." He said he and Sutton agreed on the decision and a national search ­for a successor will begin. 
A news conference was scheduled for later in the day. Sutton served as an assistant under father Eddie Sutton before taking the 
-

top job. His status has been a subject of speculation for much of the second half of the season, beginning when the Cowboys lost six in a row, the program's longest skid in more than two decades.

NCAA BASKETBALL 

UCLA's injuries leave room for new talent 
Associated Press 
I.OS ANGELES Ben !lowland's worst fears came true before UCLA played its first game this season. Only 10 scholarship players were avail­able and the coach was wor­ried about injuries depleting his lineup. 
Ilowland is known for want­ing to control every last detail about his team and injuries were something hn had no sway over. 
"It really does impact what kind of year you're going to have if you're able to stay healthy," he said Tuesday. 
The Bruins (35-3) overcame injuries to startnrs Darren Collison and Luc Hichard Mbah a Moute and reserves Lorenzo Mata-Heal and James Keefe, and now they're headed to a third consecutive Final Four on a 14-game winning streak. 
"It shows how strong and deep we are," Keefe said. 
Freshman Kevin Love nearly avoided the injury bug, hurting his back in the Pac-1 0 tourna­ment. But that seems a distant memory since Love has anchored the Bruins' NCAA tournament success. 
Mbah a Moute's lel't ankle is still hurting, although not enough to keep him out of Saturday's national semifinal game against Memphis (37-1). 
"Ever since my freshman year, this team has had people who can step up. We've had injuries a lot," he said. 
Collison missed the season's 
first six games because of a 
sprained left knee. He was stiU 
wearing a brace that limited 
his movement when the Bruins 
lost for the first time, by two 
points to Texas. 
Mbah a Moute missed a total of six games with a concussion and a sprained left ankle, which happened twice. Mata­Heal missed two games because of a strained groin and a concussion. lie's provid­ed a valuable breather for Love after being the starting center on last y{~ar's Final Four team. 
"We know how to respond to adversity, that's it," Collison said. "James Keefe stepped up in Luc's shoes when he was down.... It seems like we do that every year. I hope it sym­bolizes what we do for the Final Four." 
Michael Roll played in six games in December before re­rupturing a tendon in his left foot at the end of that month, causing him to redshirt the rest of the season. That forced Keefe into action after the sophomore thought he was going to redshirt and spend the season working to get back into condition from left shoul­der surgery in August. 
Now Roll is the cheerleader on the bench dressed in street clothes, while Keefe came up big with 18 points and 12 rebounds -both career highs -in an 88-78 victory over Western Kentucky in the West Region semifinals. 


Keefe had already hinted at what he could do when Mbah a Moute got hurt during the Pac­t 0 tourney. Keefe came in and scored eight points and defended well in a win over Stanford for the title. 
"Maybe if (Luc) doesn't hurt his ankle, we don't win against Western Kentucky because James is thrown in there with­out having the experience," Howland said. 
Keefe's performance earned him national attention, but he wasn't exactly a slouch before that. The 6-foot-8 sophomore arrived in Westwood as a McDonald's All-American, but the shoulder surgery set him back as did a lack of minutes.

GOLF 
Woods and Ochoa 
easily comparable 
Associated Press 
RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. ­The comparisons between Tiger Woods and Lorena Ochoa are inevitable, and mostly accurate. 
Woods gave the PGA Tour a two-week head start in Hawaii, made his debut at the Buick Invitational and won by eight shots. Ochoa also skipped the first two LPGA Tour events in Hawaii, started in Singapore at the HSBC Champions and won by 11. 
Woods has won 18 times on the PGA Tour since the start of the 2006 season. Ochoa has 16 victories. They are No. 1 in their respective world ranking by more than double the mar­gin of No.2. 
And over the next two weeks, both are overwhelming favorites to win the first major championship of the year. 
But that's where the parallel paths come to a fork in the road. 
Woods has four green jack­ets from the Masters, not to mention a career full of posi­tive vibes at the majors. He captured the career Grand Slam at age 24, before he had completed four years on the PGA Tour. 
Despite her dominance, Ochoa arrived at the Kraft Nabisco Championship to face some demons. 
She loves Mission Hills, where she first played as a teenager. The affection she gets in the California desert rivals that of her native Mexico, with someone waving a red, white and green nag on just about every fairway. Ochoa sheepishly mentioned that she asked tournament officials for 100 tickets for her family and friends, and she was willing to pay for them. 
"I have great memories, and I have a lot of support from people that comes from Mexico and cheer for me," Ochoa said Tuesday. "It's just someplace that feels good. I'm ready to have a good week. I've been close a few times, and hopefully, this is the year." 
She is being modest about close calls. Ochoa should have won this major by now. 
Two years ago, she tied an LPGA major record with a 10­under 62 in the opening round 
and still had a three-shot lead going into Sunday until a meltdown on the back nine. Ochoa recovered with an eagle on the final hole to get into a playoff against Karrie Webb, who won on the first extra hole. 
Ochoa was tied for the lead going into the weekend last year and looked poised as ever until she missed the par­3 17th green, whiffed on a wedge, took three putts once she got on the green and took quadruple bogey that effec­tively knocked her out of the tournament. 
Moments like that are what makes winning even harder. 
The Kraft Nabisco is the only LPGA major that has been played on the same course every year, which makes it similar to the Masters in that respect -and only that respect. Augusta National does not have a Wienermobile next to the practice green. 
Geoff Ogilvy spoke recently about why the Masters has such a long list of players who never won a green jacket, and he mentioned the familiarity of the course breeding so much contempt. 
"There are demons that don't go away," Ogilvy said. "If you have a few close calls at the U.S. Open, you're always doing it somewhere else. If you have demons at Augusta, which everybody does, _guys always remember." 
Great as she is, Ochoa's biggest challenge will be to bury those memories. 
"I already erased them," she insisted. "I only feel good things about this course, and good vibes and good memo­ries. Of course, you're going to make mistake? and have a few bad holes, like what happened on 17 last year. I struggled on holes 13, 14 and 15. They were holes that I played over par, and I'm going to work on those this year and make sure I play that stretch in a positive way. 
"And I think that will really help get a good result on Sunday." 
What might help this year is no longer having to answer questions about winning a major. Even after she replaced Annika Sorenstam at No. 1 in the world at the end of the 2006 season, Ochoa had a reputation of being unable to win the big one.

She turned a second alley­oop attnmpt into a sueeessful layup, and that got the Lady Vols' run going. Shannon Bobbitt followed with two frne throws. and Parker hit two of hnr own to put Tennessee ahead 43-42 with 3:44 to play.

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL NFL 
Indiana hires Crean Goodell to decide Paanan's fate 
away from Marquette 
Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. Indiana University will hire Marquette's Tom Crean as its bas­ketball coach and is expected to introduce him at a news confer~ ence Wednesday. 
University trustee Philip Eskew confirmed the hiring. Eskew said Crean had signed a letter-of­intent with the university and was meeting with his team Tuesday night. 
Team spokesman J.D. Campbell said a news conference had yet to be scheduled. 
The hiring comes near the end of a tumultuous six-week period in which former Hoosiers coach Kelvin Sampson resigned amid an NCAA scandal, interim coach Dan Dakich replaced him and then lost four of seven games. 
Dakich also suspended guard Jamarcus Ellis for disciplinary reasons for the Hoosiers' game at Penn StatP, and announcPd Tuesday that Ellis and guard Armon Bassett had been kicked ofT the team for missing two scheduled events. 
Crean, who led Marquette to the Final Four in 2003, will responsible for rebuilding not only Indiana's reputation as a national power but also its sullied image as a squeaky dean pro­gram.

"I think he's a great choice," Eskew said. "He has a Big Ten background, a Midwest back­growld, he's recruited in the state of Indiana and he has an impec­cable record, so I think Indiana is on the road to recovery." 
Now the question is what kind of team will Crean inherit. 
Starting forwards D.J. White and Lance Stemler both finished their senior seasons, and it's uncertain whether Bassett and Ellis, two of the starting guards, will return after being punished for missing an appointment last week. When they didn't show 'Up to run laps the next day, Dakich decided to dismiss them from the team. 
On Monday, freshman Eric Gordon is expected to announce whether he will declare early lor the NBA. Most figure, he's leav­ing, which would leave Indiana without all five of its regular starters from last season. 
Outside the administration, the decision was greeted warmly, too.

That's who we need at Indiana, we need somebody who is going to be sta­ble. a foundation for our futun~." 
Associated Press 
PALM BEACH, Fla. Suspended Tennessee Titans cornerback Pacman Jones might know by July whether he'll be playing NFL games in 2008. 
''I'll make a decision prior to the start of training camp," commissioner Roger Goodell said of possibly reinstating Jones, who was suspended for last season for violations of the personal-conduct policy. "I have seen some of his recent comments ... and some of those comments were encouraging. I have always said he has to accept responsibility for his actions." 
Jones stood outside the church doors at Word of Faith Ministries on Tuesday, passing out almost 500 boxes of food and toiletries to needy families , a church in an impoverished area on the west side of Atlanta where his aunt and uncle are members. He said the church was a perfect place to pay hom­age to a community that has given him the most support. 
Jones teamed up with Feed the Children, a nonprofit relief organization that delivers food, medicine and clothing to the poor. 
The troubled cornerback is trying clean up his image, hop­ing this good deed for his hometown of Atlanta will be another step toward showing he's worthy of reinstatement to the league that suspended him for numerous arrests. 

During his time away from the playing field, Jones said he has learned from his actions and cut out all the "knuckle heads" in his life. He just wants the chance to atone for his mis­takes, turning to his faith for guidance. 
"In the Bible it says, 'Let the past be the past and move on to the future,"' Jones said. "I think for my situation, God did every­thing for a reason. Yes, I made a lot of bad mistakes. And I owned up. to them. I want to tell the kids everything I went through, so they won't have to." 
Goodell, who includes Jones' status among a plethora of top­ics he tou,r;hed on at the owners meetings Monday, offered his most pointed comments yet on whether Jones' suspension will cross over into a second sea­son. 
Jones wants to play for the Cowboys and Dallas apparently wants to acquire him, but a source close to the l)egotiations has told ESPN's Ed Werder that trade talks have stalled over the issue of compensation. 
A Cowboys source didn't seem to be optimistic that a deal was imminent, but told ESPN.com's John Clayton, "we're the only fish nibbling." 
jones, the Titans' suspended cornerback, may not be rein­stated by the NFL before the start of training camp although if a trade happens, a source 
·l 

said, the commissioner might allow Jones to train at the new team's facility in order to give him a potentially good environ­ment. 
Goodell was going to allow Jones to train at the Titans facility during .the offseason, but revoked that privilege when it came to his attention Jones was at a strip club at the begin­ning of the year. 
The Titans are seeking a fourth-round pick in this year's draft and a fourth-round pick in 2009, according to the source. The Cowboys are so far unwilling to provide either, believing they are the only team pursuing Jones. 
A Titans source told ESPN.com's Matt Mosley that there is a feeling within the organization that Jones cannot be reformed and should be traded even though at least one Tennessee defensive starter says players would embrace Jones' return to the team. 
Jones said last week in a radio interview with Cowboys Hall of Fame receiver Michael Irvin that he wants to resume his career in Dallas. Jones intends to apply for reinstate­ment sometime before the April 26-27 draft. 
"Dallas, they know the conse­quences lof a trade] and the status ofthe player," Goodell said Monday. "I don't feel any obligation to do more than I said, to reconsider his status. I have made no commitment."

Belles to play tvvo against Olivet 
Saint Mary's, sophomore Peterson perfect in conference play so far 

By LAURA MYERS Sports Writer 
After sweeping league oppo­nent Calvin Saturday, the Belles look to continue MIAA success against Olivet. 
The teams play a double­header this afternoon in Olivet, Michigan. 
The Belles won three of four games last weekend against Calvin and Hose-Hulman, bringing their record to 13-3. The team is 2-0 in eonference play. . 
"We always start well against conferenee teams," Belles coach Erin Sullivan said. "We had a goal of accom­plishing that again this year." 
The Belles owe much of their success to sophomore outl'ielder Ashley Peterson, who was named MIAA Player of the Week on Monday. Peterson, who is batting .517 ovnrall, went 13-for-16 last weekend, induding hitting her first home run of the season Sunday. She leads the team in every major ofTensivn catego­ry. 
"Ashley is just a consistent hitter who works hard on and off the field." Sullivan said. "She is very positive and she picks everyone up on the team." 
As a whole, the team has a .333 batting average against opposing teams. Other top contributors include sopho­more Maureen Healy, who leads the team with four stolen bases, junior Ashley Fusaro, and senior McKenna 
KELLY HIGGINSfThe Observer 

Junior Calli Davison pitches during the Belles 6-5 win over 
Calvin on March 29. 
Corrigan. 
Olivet (5-11) is led by junior shortstop Kacie Hosecrants ­a 2007 first-team all-MIAA nominee. The Comets, who placed firth in the M IAA in 2007, have yet to play a con­ference team this year. 
Junior Calli Davison (7-3) will start the first game for tlHl Belles, and Corrigan will start the second contest. Both pitchers have been strong so far this season. Davison has pitched complete games in all 

eight of lwr starts, and has 50 strikeouts in a total of 60 innings. Corrigan has five complotn games, and holds a 
2.96 EHA. 
Olivet, loeatod in southern Michigan, is about a two-hour bus trip. Sullivan said that though it is hard. to get ener­gized right after a long trip, the team always brings plenty of enthusiasm.

Tuesday's game with Broncos postponed 
By LORENZO REYES Sports Writer 
Tuesday's game against Western Michigan was can­celled because of a storm sys­tem that had passed through South Bend leaving behind rain and frigid ternperatures. As of now, a make-up date has not been announced and it is not certain if the game will be played. 
If the contest is to be played, however, it will most likely take place sometime in May. 
The Irish will take part in an exhibition game against the South Bend Silver Hawks, for the first time ever today at 
5:30 p.m. at Coveleski Stadium. The game is in honor of Irish head coach Dave Schrage's wife, Jody, who passed away after a long bat­tle with cancer in 2007. 
This weekend, Notre Dame will try to bounce back from a frustrating three-game Big East series against Cincinnati, in which the Irish dropped two of three. 
Starting Friday, Rutgers will travel to Frank Eck Stadium to face the Irish in another con­ference three-game set that ends Sunday. 
Junior David Phelps will take the mound the first game, fol­lowed by senior southpaw Wade Korpi, who will pitch on Saturday. 
In the series finale sopho­more righty, Eric Maust will attempt to close out the Scarlet Knights as the Irish look to advance in the league standings.

Though Purdue has strug­glod on the season, Irish eoach Jay Louderback is not underestimating the Boilermakers. 
"We've lost to Purdue a few times over the last few years, and we've had so many elose matches this year that our kids arn smart enough not to overlook anybody," Loudnrbaek said.

he said. "We'll bn happy with nothing less than a shutout." 
Ain't Got No Big Man Hands did not get the shutout they desin1d, but they did eome pretty dosn. 
Captain Kinran Bulger did a stellar job running his tnam's ol"l'onsfl, scoring buckets in transition and easily handing his teammates open looks. 
For the Family Band Solution and captain Brendan Hennessy. penetration was virtually impossible due to the eurtain-like defense maintained by Ain't Got No Big Man Hands for the entire game. The inability to get the ball inside highlighted the fact that the outside shots were not dropping for them. 
Ain't Got No Big Man Hands, however, found suc­cess both inside and outside. They had a decided advan­tage on the boards, and sev­eral players on the team were consistently able to drain shots from outside when given open looks.

Irish ga111e cancelled vs. Cards 
By SAM WERNER Sports Writer 
Notre Dame's game Tuesday against Ball State was cancelled due to unfavorable weather con­ditions. No make up date has been announced. 
The Irish have only managed to play one home game so far this season, downing IUPUI 8-0 in 5 innings on Mareh 26. Notre Dame is most recently coming of a split doubleheader with DePaul this past weekend. 
Freshman pitcher Jody Valdivia was named Big East pitcher of the week for her 2-0 shutout against the Blue Demons. Valdivia is the second Notre Dame player to earn conference pitching honors, with junior pitcher Brittany Baragar winning the award earlier in the season. 
The next Irish home game is Wednesday against Toledo at 5 
p.m. at Ivy Field. 
The Rockets offense is led by senior Leslie Stong. Stong recent­ly broke Toledo's career home run record with her 20th dinger. She is currently hitting .388 on the season with 2 homers and 10 HBI. 
The Hockets, though, have been unable to find a pitching threat to match Stong's offense. The pitching staff has a 6.03 team ERA and gave up six runs in the first inning of their most recent game, a 6-0 loss to Kent State. 
Contact Sam Werner at swerner@nd.edu 
has seen change as freshman Kristen Hafael is out with a an injury. 
At Southern Methodist last week, Krisik and Hielley teamed up at the No. 2 posi­tion to notch an 8-2 win while Potts atl'd Ciobanu did not play at the No. 3 position, winning by default due to the Mustangs short-handed lineup. 
Ciobanu rejoined Rielley at 

the No. 2 spot for the match against Indiana, picking up a win to improve to 13-1 while Krisik and Potts lost their match in a tiebreaker. 
Louderback has not eommit­ted to using just one lineup in Rafael's absence. He remains unsure exactly what he will do against Purdue.

Spons Writer 
Saint Mary's finally got the conference win it had been looking for in its 9-0 sweep over Olivet on Tuesday. The Belles move their record to 5-8, 1-2 MIAA, and the Comets fall to 1-7, 0-3 MIAA. 
"We came out strong in all aspects of our play today," sophomore co-captain Camille Gebert said. "We gained a lot of experience from the tough competition last weekend, and it really showed today. As a team, we're playing more con­fidently." 
The Belles are coming off a winless weekend at the Jack Swartz Invitational at Wheaton College, Ill., losing to Olivet Nazarene and Wheaton College, both ranked teams. The Belles lost 6-3 to No. 16 in NAIA Olivet Nazarene on Friday, and 8-1 to Wheaton, ranked No. 28 in Division III,
