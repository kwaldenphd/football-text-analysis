Students count down to game time 
Excitement buzzes around season opener against Georgia Tech 
By AMANDA GONZALES 
News Writer 
The long, agonizing wait for many students will end Saturday at 3:43 p.m. when the Notre Dame football sea­son kicks off in Notre Dame Stadium against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. 
Because of the graduation of quarterback Brady Quinn and wide receivers Jeff Samardzija and Rhema McKnight -and running back Darius Walker's early departure for the NFL Draft -Notre Dame is not ranked in the top 25 for the first time since Charlie Weis' first game as coach, against

Undergrad research director announced 
By MARCELA BERRIOS 
News Writer 

The most recent product of University President Father John Jenkins and Provost Thomas Burish's public com­mitment to research is the 
appointment  of  former  
Assistant  Dean  of  the  
Graduate  School  Cecilia  

Lucero to be the new director of undergraduate research. 
The newly created position is designed "to expand research opportunities for undergraduates ... and to encourage current and enter­ing students to participate in research," Vice President and Associate Provost for Undergraduate Studies Dennis Jacobs said Thursday. 
Jacobs said Lucero was cho­sen to fill this position because her years as an academic advisor and assistant dean of First Year of Studies have made her familiar with under­graduate students and what the University will need to do to engage them in more research projects. 
"Roughly 30 percent of stu­dents do undergraduate research currently, and I'm hoping that by reaching out to students, especially first and second-year students, we can increase that percentage," she said in a news release shortly after taking office last May. 
Lucero said one way she

Police question proposed ordinance 
SBPD spokesman Phil Trent doubts department can enforce plan intended to control student parties 
By KAREN LANGLEY 
News Editor 
Leaders of the South Bend Police Department believe the Common Council's pro­posed ordinance to require permits for some off-campus parties is not the best way to address out-of-control gath­erings -and might not even be enforceable. 
"The question is, how far is everybody willing to stretch or fund the city's resources to necessarily enforce this,"

US News and World Report recently placed Notre Dame in a tie for 19th in its 2008 rank­ings of the country's best col­leges -one spot up from a No. 20 ranking last year. 
The rankings, published annually by US News and World Report, put Notre Dame in a tie with Vanderbilt. Princeton, Harvard and Yale occupy the first three spots on the list. 
Assistant Vice President for News and Information Dennis Brown said the University is pleased with the top-20 rank­ing, but added that Notre Dame has "always had reser­fines. 

The specifics of the bill are not conducive to efficient patrolling, Trent said. 
"We've got legitimate bars, fully licensed, with 100 patrons spilling out onto the streets," he said. "Somebody's party with 25 people isn't even going to register on the radar." 
Council members readily admitted during community relations committee meetings that the ordinance would pri­

US News and World Report collects data from universities to compile the rankings. The data include the retention and graduation rate for each col­lege, the average freshman retention rate, the selectivity of admissions, class size, the academic credentials of incoming students and the number of faculty members. Those factors account for 75 percent of the school's rank­ing. 
The remaining 25 percent of a school's score is determined by a peer assessment review, in which the president, provost and dean of admis­

Penalties for Hand unknow-n 
Junior guard allegedly solicited a prostitute 
By CHRIS KHOREY News Writer 
Notre Dame students, alum­ni and sports fans are asking questions regarding the pun­ishment by the Office of Residence Life and Housing of junior 
football player Derrell Hand, who was arrest­ed for allegedly soliciting a prostitute 


on South Hand Bend's south side Aug. 3. 
But answers may be slow in coming. 
Irish football coach Charlie Weis said that Hand, who was suspended indefinitely from the team immediately following his arrest, was "reinstated" Monday and has attended classes and football practice all week. 
The junior nose guard will be held out of at least the season's first three games against Georgia Tech, Penn State and Michigan. But, Weis said, the suspension was his and had nothing to do with Residence Life.

When drafted from Virginia Tech in 
2001, Michael Vick was a quarterback 
unlike any the NFL had ever seen.

earenr we had no rnason not to. In his 
first yoar starting, Vick lml us to the 
playofTs and bmLt Brett Farve and the 
Packllrs at I.ambeau Field. 
Ev1m though the Faleons fell to the Eaglt~s in thn next round, Michael Viek was thn hottest athletn ever to hit Atlanta. The No. 7 jersey was thll best­snlling of any player in the NFL. I happily unwrapp1~d my jersey Christmas morning and wore it every Sunday of the Sllason. 
A season later, Vick signed a huge I 0-yfmr contract worth $130 million. The Georgia Domfl was sold out evp,ry week and had never been so loud ­we wanted Michael Vick to be a Falcon !'or life. 
The warning signs began in 2005 with the "Hon Mexico" incident, when Vick was sued !'or allegedly passing on a Sexually Transmitted Disease. The suit was privately settled out of court, and little was made of the incident in Atlanta. To us, he was still the most talented quarterback in football, and he was our quarterback. 
A'i Vick led the Falcons to the NFC Championship game the following sea­son, we as fans looked past his ofT­field issue to watch him win. But then last year, the tide turned. While the Falcons struggled and Vick struggled, his relationship with the eity and fans grew worse. A<> losses piled up, Vick gave fans in Atlanta the finger while we booed him going into halftime. 
Our former superstar's demise cul­minated over the past eight months, ending with the investigation of "Bad Newz" kennels, the indictment, the plea bargain. 
It was a tough summer for a Falcons fan be1:ause it was the end ofVick's once-promising career with the team. 
Ilis entire career and once bright futun~ have crumbled down before our eyes, all because of some dumb decisions and horrible actions. 
If anything, I hope no teams, fans, or cities ever have to deal with players like Michael Vick. 
In the mean time, as Michael Vick trades in his jersey for prison garb, I'll sadly have to make a trade of my own -my No. 7 jersey for the No. 13 of Joey I !arrington.

School outlaws playground game "tag" 
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -An elementary school has banned tag on its playground after some children complained they were harassed or chased against their will. 
"It causes a lot of conflict on the playground," said Cindy Fesgen, assistant principal of the Discovery Canyon Campus school. 
Running games are still allowed as long as students don't chase each other, she said. 
Fesgen said two parents complained to her about the ban but most parents and children didnt object. 
In 2005, two elementary schools in the nearby Falcon School District did away with tag and similar games in favor of alterna­tives with less physical contact. School officials said the move encouraged more students to play games and helped reduce playground squabbles. 
Baby born with 12 finngers, 12 toes 
NEW YORK-Jeshuah Fuller's parents expected him to be born with extra fingers. The extra toes, though, were a surprise. 
Jeshuah, healthy and 
weighing 7 pounds, was born in Brooklyn on Tuesday with 12 fingers and 12 toes. His rare con­dition, called poly­dactylism, is usually genet­ic. 
His dad was born with an extra finger on his left hand. His mom, Quana Morris, said she'd had an ultrasound image taken during her pregnancy and knew the baby would have extra fingers. 
"We were counting them on the sonogram," she told the Daily News.

said. "To ask thnm to evaluate

Brown said Notre Dame 

belongs in the top 20, but said 
he thought Notre Dame could 
be placed higher on the list. 
"It is interesting to us that among the top 25 schools we had the lowest peer assess­ment score, and we are not quite sure why that is," Brown said. "That is one thing that probably weighs us down a lit­tle bit." 
But Notre Dame did advance one spot on the list since last year, a shift Brown attributed to several factors. A change in the University's computer sys­tom allowed Notre Dame to report a larger percentage of full-time faculty members, creating a more eonsistent record of the faculty popula­tion. 
Brown also noted revisions in federal reporting guidelines that updated the way faculty were countod as either full­time or part-time. 
The large number of appli­cants for the Class of 2011, with 14,500 applicants for fewer than 2,000 spots, also improved Notre Dame's rating in the selectivity and accept­ance rate categories, Brown said. 
In an additional US News ranking of schools with the lowest acceptance rates, Notre Dame, with a 27 percent acceptance rate, was one of the most competitive schools in the eountry.

On its Web site, Notre Dame lists its distinguished rankings, including its status as a top-25 school in the US News rankings, on its "About Notre Dame" page. 
Both observations and Admissions office research show students and their par­ents are "not fixated" on rank­ings, said Assistant Provost for Admissions Dan Saracino. 
"If you are ranked in the top 20, it affirms you are one of the top schools in the coun­try," Saracino said. "But a stu­dent is not going to select a school that is 17th over one ly like this place." 
Senior Katie Miller was glad that Notre Dame had moved up in the rankings but said that even if it dropped dra­matically, the school would still get a huge applicant pool.

Svete cited BusinessWeek, which listed the Mendoza School of Businnss seventh in the country in its 2007 rank­ings of undnrgraduate busi­ness programs. That, Svete said, is an "extra selling point" for companies to recruit Notre Dame graduates. 
"I don't think it makes or breaks a deal, but I think it's an added bonus to be in the top 10," he said. 
For the past six years, US News and World Heport has also published a list of schools that have "outstanding exam­ples of academic programs that are believed to lead to student access," according to the magazine's Web site. 
Notre Dame's First Year of Studies, its International Study program and service learning offerings are all recognized in the unranked lists. Notre Dame also was ranked 20th out of 50 schools with the best values. The ranking was determined based on the per­centage receiving need-based grants, the average school cost after the grant and the aver­age discount from the total cost of attending the college.

8 killed as trains collide near Rio 
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil -A train slammed into a stationary train Thursday near a Rio de Janeiro depot, officials said. A firefighter said there were reports ofcasualties. 
The collision occurred about 200 yards from the Austin station on Hio's poor north side, said a firelighter who gave his name only as Sgt. Goncalves, in line with company policy. 
"We heard there were various victims, including fatalities," he said by telephone. Civil Defense officials said 60 firefighters were working at the site to remove victims. 
"Our priority is to give support to the sur­vivors, the passengers trapped in the wreck­age, and reduce the number of fatal victims," Col. Souza Filho, the head of Rio de Janeiro's Civil Defimse Department, said in an interview with the Globo TV network. 
Souza Filho said preliminary reports were that one train was empty and the other was carrying commuters. He said he didn't have an estimate of the number of victims.

UNITED NATIONS-U.N. weapons inspectors discovered a potentially hazardous chemical warfare agent that was taken from an Iraqi chemical weapons facility 11 years ago and mis­takenly stored in their offices in the heart of midtown Manhattan all that time, officials said Thursday. The material-identified in inventory files as phosgene, a chemical substance used in World War I weapons -was discovered Aug. 
24. It was only identified on Wednesday because it was marked simply with an inventory number, and oflicials had to check the many records in their vast archives, said Ewen Buchanan, a spokesman f<w the U.N. inspection agency. 

Report brings more Iraq debate 
WASIIINGTON -An independent assess­ment concluding that Iraq has made little political progress in recent months despite an influx of U.S. troops drew fierce objections from the White House on Thursday and pro­vided fresh ammunition for Democrats who want to bring troops home. The political wran­gling came days before the report was to be ollicially released and while most lawmakers were still out of town for the August recess, reflecting the high stakes involved for both sides in the Iraq war debate. President Bush, who planned to meet Friday at the Pentagon with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is nearing a deci­sion on a way forward in Iraq while Congress planned another round of votes this fall to end the war.

School president refuses to step down despite demands from angry parents 
Associated Press 
RICHMOND, Va. -With anguished parents demanding his firing, Virginia Tech's president bristled at suggestions Thursday that he bears responsibility for the bloodbath on campus, call­ing it a crime "unprece­dented in its cunning and murderous results." 
At a news conference

Seung-Hui Cho that left 33 
people dead. 
"No plausible scenario 
was made for how this 
horror could have been 
prevented once he began

He said he will neither 
resign nor ask the Virginia 
Tech police chief to quit, 
despite bitter demands by 
some of the victims' fami­
lies that he and others be 
held accountable for the 
deadliest school shooting 
in U.S. history.

marily affect students. 
Council member AI "Buddy" Kirsits, a co-sponsor, has said many neighborhood problems are caused by "a culture of drinking" among college stu­dents. 
The ordinance's other spon­sor, Council member Tim House, said student partying has required increased city response and resources. 
"There's a perception that things have gotten better, but when you look at the data, they've actually regressed," he said at the Aug. 20 com­munity relations committee meeting. "We have more instances of things that cost the city money." 
Later during that meeting, Chief Thomas Fautz of the South Bend Police Dopartmnnt disagreed. 
Fautz said polico had seen a "slight improvoment" in off­campus student partying last year, a change potentially related to the amendment addod to the disorderly house ordinance during the summer of 2005.

"It doesn't do any good to have an ordinance that is ignored, not enforceable or taken to court," Luecke said after the com­

what the ordinance mandates we do." 
Trent emphasized the need to be "realistic" when enforc­ing laws. Telling seasoned police officers how to find out-of-control parties would use city resources while accomplishing little, he said. 
"If there's a party on East Washington Street with 400 people, they're not going to hide that very well," he said. "It's not going to be a news flash." 
One positive aspect of the proposed ordinance, Trent said, would be the require­ment of contact information for someone who considered 
munity relations committee meeting Aug. 20. 
Students had already responded strongly to the ordinance and its emphasis on drinking-related problems when the Aug. 21 shooting of two Notre Dame seniors ­both whom are recovering ­attracted campus attention to violent crime in South Bend. 
Discussion of the ordinance has highlighted one frequent misconception about the police department, Trent said.

IN BRIEF 
Toys 'R' Us product recalled for lead 
TRENTON, NJ -Toys 'R' Us is recalling thousands of art sets made in China due to excessive levels of lead in some black watr~rcolor paints. 
Wayne-based Toys 'R' Us Inc. and the 
U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission announced the recall Thursday, saying printed ink on the packaging of the lmaginarium Wooden Coloring Cases also contained lead. They said no injuries have been reported. 
"Toys 'R' Us has terminated its relation­ship with Funtastic, effective immediately," the company said in a statement. 
Toys 'R' Us bought the sets from Funtastic, a unit of a Hong Kong distribu­tion company called FPL Group. They are manufactured by a company in Ningbo, China, called Danxiang International Trading. 
The 213-item set contains crayons, pas­tels, colored pencils, fiber pens, water col­ors, a palette and other art supplies in a wooden carrying case. 
Wheat prices soar in tight market 
NEW YORK -Wheat prices surged again into record territory Thursday as dry weather menaced crops in the Southern Hemisphere, exacerbating the concerns of a world market bound by extremely tight supply and unrelenting demand. 
Other commodities finished mixed, with energy prices retreating slightly from sharp gains a day earlier and metals end­ing in a mixed range. Gold slipped at the market close, while industrial metals including copper and nickel rose modestly. 
The price of wheat has had a spectacular run higher since mid-May, as one wheat crop after another around the world has been damaged by too-hot or too-dry weath­er. Now the market has its eye on crops in the Southern Hemisphere: Forecasts are calling for dryness in Argentina and Australia, when the winter wheat crop emerging there needs moisture, said Richard Feltes, senior vice president and director of MF Global Research in Chicago.

Even if they wanted to comment, Wycliff and Kirk would have to speak within the bounds of the Family Educational Hights and Privacy Act (FEHPA). FEHPA says that "schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible stu­dent in order to release any information from a student's education record," which means any comment from the University would have to come in the form of gen­eralities.

This open-endedness has created confusion among Irish fans, includ­ing those who post on the message boards attached to popular fan site ndna­tion.com. Some have even posited that the administration has decid­ed to ease punishments for duLac violations.

Posters on the message board have compared Hand's situation to that of junior basketball play­er Kyle McAlarney, who was suspended for the 2007 spring semester after being arrested on marijuana possession charges. 
"Suspension for an entire semester for smoking pot but not for soliciting a prostitute?" one poster wrote. "I don't get the administration sometimes." 
However, duLac says that "possession, use or misuse of any controlled substance, including, but not limited to, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, amphet­amines and depressants, is a serious violation. Students who possess, use or misuse such sub­stances shall be subject to disciplinary suspen­sion or permanent dis­missal."

Kosher n1eals provided as option at universities 
UW-Madison to meet needs ofreligious students 
Associated Press 
MADISON, Wis.-Heather Zucker ate mostly salad and spaghetti during the years she lived in the University of Wisconsin-Madison dorms. Sometimes, her dinner was just a bowl of ice cream. 
Zucker wasn't being picky. She keeps kosher, and she said there were "slim pickins" for Jewish students in the din­ing halls. 
"It got old pretty fast," said Zucker, who graduated in 2005. 
That's about to change. UW-Madison is opening a kosher meat kitchen in a residence hall dining room starting this fall. Muslims who follow Islamic dietary laws, called halal, will also be accom­modated. 
A growing number of schools are offering kosher dining options, but few have full kosher meat kitchens, said UW-Madison housing director Paul Evans. Other schools with the service include the University of Pennsylvania and Cornell University. 
"We know this is being talked about because it's fairly unusual," Evans said. 
The goal is to make Jewish and Muslim students more comfortable and help the university attract potential stu­dents. 
About 4,000 Jewish students attend UW-Madison, making it among the largest Jewish student populations at 
U.S. public universities, according to Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life, a Washington, D.C.-based group that has foundations on many campuses. 
Kashrut, or Jewish dietary laws, pro­hibit mixing milk and meat, and bar consumption of pork and shellfish. The kosher laws detail how animals should be slaughtered. Muslim dietary laws also prescribe how animals should be killed, and bar alcohol and other items. 
The school spent $129,000 to buy equipment for the kitchen, which is expected to open in November as part of a renovated dining room in Chadbourne Hall. The university is hir­ing two mashgichim -Orthodox rabbis or those appointed by rabbis to monitor food preparation -to supervise the  kitchen. Rabbi Sholem Fishbane of the Chicago Rabbinical Council reviewed the university's plans to ensure compli­ance with complicated kosher laws. 
While the kitchen will be separated from other food preparation areas, the food will be served in a marketplace near other stations with traditional fare and have similar prices. 
Grilled chicken sandwiches, roast beef and fish will be on the lunch and dinner menus. 
"It's a whole new concept, a whole new cuisine that we're working with," said Bob Fessenden, the university's food service director, who worked with staff to taste potential dishes this sum­mer. Among their discoveries, he said, was a delicious soy crepe. 
Greg Steinberger, executive director of Hillel's foundation at UW-Madison, said many students who grew up eating kosher meats are forced to become veg­etarians in college. Others skip the dorms to live in apartments so they can prepare their own food or try to keep kosher by eating at Hillel, which offers kosher meals through the week, he said.

Testimony starts in Iraq massacre trial 
Associated Press 

CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. ­A Marino tnstifind Thursday that he saw a roomful of frightorwd women and childrnn moments bofore they wero killed by his squad mates in lladitha, Iraq, but he said he did not snn who shot tlwm. 
l.anc~n Cpl. llumberto Mcmdoza was tlw first witness at a hnaring to detnrminn wlwther Stall" Sgt. Frank Wutorich, 27, of Mnridnn. Conn., will facn a court-martial on charges of murdering 17 civilians. 
Wutnrieh had bnnn ehargnd with murdnring I H Iraqis in a bloody combat operation that loft 24 civilians dead. but at the outsnt of Thursday's !waring prosecutors withdrew one mur­der count. 
While the numbnr of suspeet­ed murders makes Wuterieh's ease the biggest to have emerged against any U.S. serv­ice member to have served in Iraq, the hearing eomes after a string of setbaeks for Marine prosecutors. 
The ease eenters on whether Wuterich, who had never expe­rienced combat before, acted within Marine rules of engage­ment when he shot men by a ear and then led his squad in a string of house raids. 
Wuterich asserts that he was following combat rules and that lw assaulted the housns because he thought gunfire was coming from them. 
Mendoza described the events of Nov. 19, 2005, as being a fast­flowing series of engagements. Aftnr a Marine llurnvee driver was killed in a roadside bomb. the troops raided snvnral homos. 
"Whnn I opmwd the door, the first thing I sen is wonwns and kids laying down on a bed," Mnndoza, who is from Vorwzunla and has a heavy accent, reeallnd sewing in the sncond house lw lwlpnd raid. "I lwli!we thny wnw scarml." 
Anrial footage from an unmanned drone shows that Marines were engagnd in sever­al other combat operations around lladitha that day. The Associated Press obtained the footage on Thursday. 
Mendoza testified that he had 
shot an unarmed Iraqi man who 
opened the front door to the 
home, and that he shot a differ­
ent man in another house who 
ho thought was reaching for a 
weapon. 
Mnndoza said the killings were within combat ruins because the oceupants of the homes had been declared hos­tilo. 
Prosecutors called as a wit­ness Capt. Kathryn Navin. a Marine lawyer who testified that she instrueted Wuterich's com­pany on ruh~s of engagement in August 2005. 
Navin said she taught Marines to have "knowledge to a reason­able certainty that the target you are engaging is a lawful military target," though she con­eeded there were occasions when positive identification of every individual in a military strike is not needed. 
One of Wuterich's military defense attorneys, Lt. Col. Colby Vokey, said the government was no longer charging Wuterich with murdering an Iraqi man who died in the final house cleared by Marines. 
The count was withdrawn after the general overseeing the ease dismissed charges against another Marine accused of killing three other men in the same room of the house, ruling that they posed a legitimate threat, Vokey said. 
Mendoza is one of several Marines granted immunity by proseeutors to testify. He claimed not to have seen Wuterieh kill anyone in the two houses he helped elear with Wuterich. 
"I think he's a great Marine, sir." Mendoza said when asked by a defense attorney what he thought of Wuterich. 
Wutnrieh, who like all Marines in tho court wore desert eamou­llage, sat with his tattooed arms folded on the table in front of him and appearnd to be grind­ing his teeth.

Officer: Craig lied in interrogation 
Audiotape of arrest shows Idaho Senator complained of entrapment 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The offi­cer who arrested Sen. Larry Craig in a police undereover operation at an airport men's room accused the senator of lying to him during an inter­rogation afterward, aceord­ing to an audiotape of the arrest. 
On the tape, released Thursday by the Minneapolis Airport Poliee, the Idaho Hepubliean in turn accuses the officer of solieiting him for sex. 
''I'm not gay. I don't do these kinds of things," Craig told Sgt. Dave Karsnia min­utes after the two men met in a men's room at the air­port on June 11. 
"You shouldn't be out to entrap people," Craig told the offieer. "I don't want you to take me to jail." 
Karsnia replied that Craig wouldn't be going to jail as long as he cooperated. 
The two men disagreed about virtually everything that had occurred minutes earlier, including whether there was a piece of paper on the floor of the stall and the meaning of the senator's hand gestures. At no time did Craig admit doing anything wrong, although weeks later he pleaded guilty to a reduced misdemeanor eharge of disorderly conduet. 
"You're not being truthful with me," Karsnia told Craig during the interrogation. ''I'm kind of disappointed in you, senator." 
Karsnia later told Craig he was "sitting here lying to a 

poliee offieer," adding: "I expect this from the guy we get out of the 'hood. I mean people vote for you. Unbelievable." 
Meanwhile, more of Craig's Hepublican colleagues moved away from him Thursday in the wake of his guilty plea earlier this month to a reduced charge of disorderly eonduct in the undereover police operation aimed at sex solieitors. Hepublican National Committee officials had considered calling for his resignation early Thursday, Republicans with knowledge of the delibera­tions said, but had not done so by day's end. 
Sen. John Ensign of Nevada, who chairs the GOP's senatorial campaign committee, stopped short of calling on Craig to resign but suggested strongly that he should. 
"I wouldn't put myself hopefully in that kind of posi­tion, but if I was in a position like that, that's what I would do," Ensign told The Associated Press in his home state. "He's going to have to answer that for himself." 
Sens. Norm Coleman, R­Minn., and Susan Collins, H­Maine, each turned over to charity $2,500 in campaign donations they had received from Craig's politieal action eommittee. Coleman and Collins both faee potentially tough raees for re-election next year.

Judge rules astronaut Now-ak 111ay re111ove ankle 111onitor 
Bracelet no longer necessary because ofgood behavior; Navy Captain awaiting trial following attack against romantic rival 
Associated Press 

OHLANDO, Fla. -Former astronaut Lisa Nowak can removn an electronic monitor­ing bracelet from her ankle whiln shn .awaits trial on chargns shn attacked a roman­tic rival, a judge ruled Thursday. 
Nowak had argund that the brac:nlet was expensivn, bulky, uncomfortable and prnvented hnr from nxerctsmg, as requirml of a military officer. .I udgn Marc L. Lubet said that those~ daims did not matter, but that Nowak had behaved wnll nnough over the past sev<m months to remove the dnvic:n. 
Nowak, a Navy captain, said in a statnmPnt through lwr publicist: "It's a great redid not to worry about safdy issues related to thn batteries life whiln I'm driving. I'm also really looking forward to get­ting back into my former aero­bic fitness programs." 
The woman Nowak is accused of attacking had argued to require Nowak to continue wearing the device. Colleen Shipman said she still feared Nowak, who has filed an intent to plead temporary insanity. 
Nowak is still prohibited from contacting Shipman or Bill Oefelein, the former shut­tle pilot both women dated, Lubet said in the order. Nowak has no reason to travel to Florida, where Shipman lives, other than court, or to Virginia, where Shipman's boyfriend lives, the judge said. 
Nowak is also barred from neighboring Maryland, Delaware and Washington, D.C., without court approval, ac:eording to the filing. 
Shipman's attorney, Kepler Funk, condemned the ruling in a public statement Thursday and expressed concern the order didn't address Nowak's mental health. 
"Colleen Shipman has already been victimized once by Lisa Nowak, and now it seems she is being further punished for wanting to have a relationship with William Oefelein and try, despite the attack, to lead a normal life free from fear of further vio­lence," Funk said. 
"At some points the rights of the victim to feel safe in her own home should be given sig­nificant weight. In our opinion, justice requires that Lisa Nowak's aerobic fitness should not override Colleen Shipman's peace of mind." 
Lubet wrote Nowak was still under previous bond of $25,500 and that the military has assured him Nowak would face additional penalties if she violated the new conditions of parole. He also noted Shipman testified going to Houston, where Nowak lives, three or four times since the incident. 
"During these trips by Ms. Shipman to Houston, the elec­tronic monitoring GPS device afforded no protection or ben­efit to Ms. Shipman, as the defendant could freely move about Houston with no fear of violating any condition of the electronic monitoring GPS device," Lubet wrote. · 
Shipman has said that she felt safe in Houston because she was with Oefelein, her boyfriend, but that the monitor is comforting when she is alone. 
The bracelet cost $105 a week, Nowak said, adding that it kept her from exercising and swimming with her children. She also called it dangerous, because batteries have to be changed twice daily or a loud alarm sounds even while driv­ing. 
Nowak, 44, was arrested in February after confronting Shipman over a love triangle. 

The former astronaut is accused of stalking Shipman at the Orlando airport, then attacking her with pepper spray as Shipman arrived at her car. 
The married mother of three is suspected of driving nearly 1,000 miles from Houston to Orlando, using diapers to avoid taking breaks, to execute the attack. Police said she was carrying a duffel bag contain­ing a steel mallet, a 4-inch knife and a BB gun. 
Nowak suffered from major depression, obsessive-compul­sive disorder, insomnia and "brief psychotic disorder with marked stressors," according to the notice to plead insanity written by defcmse attorney Donald Lykkebak. 
Lubet has asked for another hearing before deciding on Lykkebak's requests to throw out Nowak's long arrest inter­view with police and the search of hnr BMW. 

Pet dog gets inheritance 
Associated Press 
NHW. YOHK Lnona 
llnlmsley's decision to leave 
$12 million to h<~r dog so it 
could livn out its life in luxu­
ry proved once and for all 
that she was not one of the 
little people. 
But legal experts say that, size aside, Ilelmsley's gift to her beloved pet -a Maltese namnd Trouble-wasn't unique. 
A growing number of peo­ple, not all wnalthy, have been setting up trust funds or adjusting their wills to ensurn that their pets are well can~d for if they die, according to attorneys and animal welfan~ groups. 
States have rushed to make such gifts easier. At thn closn of thn 1CJ<Jos, only a handful rc)eognized so­callc~d "pet trusts." Now, 39 slates plus Washington, D.C., have enacted laws dealing with such girts. 
The types of bequests vary. Some wnll-olT Amc~rieans go as far as to sot aside tens of thousands of dollars to allow their pets to continue to live comfot'tably in their past honws with a prol'nssional earntaknr, rather than be shippod ofT to a rnlativn. 
Othnrs I<Htve monoy for futuro vnterinary bills, or just to compensate a new owner for taking on the responsibility of a new dog or eat. 
Hac:hnl llirsc:hfnld, an ostato lawynr in Nnw Yol'k who specializes in pot trusts, said thn idna isn't so c:razy. 
"People really think of thoir pds as thoir babic1s," sho said. 
Yes, shn said, gifts like llnlmslny's are nxtraordi­nary. ller c:linnts more com­monly lc~ave $5,000 to $10,000, although she had orw who set aside $5 mil­lion. 
Tales about nceentrie mil­lionaires leaving chunks of thnir fortune to a pet go back dneades, but the ere­ation or trusts for that pur­pose became easier in 1990 because of an update of the Uniform Probate Code, a model upon which many states base their laws for by her brother, and that when it dies, its remains will be buried next to her own in a lavish farriily mausoleum.

Anima! welfare groups have also lobbied for a federal bill that would cre­ate tax benetits for a pet owner who creates sueh a trust, then leaves the 

"Twelve million is outrageous. Come on! Let's get real! If someone had come to me and said, 'I want to leave I 2 mil­lion bucks, I'd say, 'Why?'" 
Rachel Hirschfeld estate lawyer 
Helmsley's, said that even given the hotelier's famous pen­chant for fine living, the trust's size is star­tling. 
"Twelve million is outrageous. Come on! Let's get real!" she said. "If someone had 
remaining money to charity when the animal dies. 
Sara Amundson, a director of legislative affairs for the Humane Society of the United States, said even a small gift can keep a pet from winding up in dire straits. 
"As a nation, we still euth­anize 4 to 6 million cats and dogs every year, and a good number of those are pnts left without care when their owners die," she said. 
Pet owners of moderate means can ensure some sta­bility for their animals by including a few lines in their will spelling out who gets the family dog, said Kim Bressant-Kibwc, associate eounsnl of trusts and estates for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 
"Maybe it's a situation where a person only has $500 or $1,000 to leave for a pet's care, and that's fine," Bressant-Kibwe said. "What we want people to think about ..is making arrange­ments. 
The specifics of Helmsley's gift to Trouble are spelled out in private trust docu­ments and aren't publicly known. Iler will says only that tho dog will be cared come to me and said, 'I want to leave 12 million bucks, I'd say, 'Why?"' 

One possible reason, she speculated, is that money left over after the dog's demise might ultimately be destined for animal-welfare charities. 
A strongly written trust, she said, could likely protect the dog's gift from becoming the subject of a court fight. 
New York state law allows a court to reduce bequests to pets if a judge finds they are more than needed for the animal's care, and there is always the possibility that disappointed relatives might be waiting in the wings to argue that the dog got too much. 
Helmsley, a hotel and real estate magnate who died Aug. 20 at age 87, decreed that the vast bulk of her multibillion-dollar estate would go to charity, not to her family, although she made individual gifts of $5 million to $10 million to sev­eral relatives. 
She also expressly stiffed two grandchildren with whom she had feuded, say­ing in her will that they would get nothing, "for rea­sons that are known to them."

the Texas Board of former death row inmate 
cerned about 

Pardons and 
Paroles. 
"The frrst thing I did was drop to my knees and say a little prayer," Foster said. "I owe a lot of people." 
The 30-year-old became only the second inmate since Texas resumed carrying out executions in 1982 that the parole board 
voted to stop an execution this close to punishment time. And in that case, in 2004, Perry reject­ed the board's recommendation and mentally ill prisoner Kelsey Patterson was executed. 
"I was real worried about 
that," said Keith Hampton, 
Foster's lawyer. 
He was walking toward the 
governor's office in Austin when 
he received a call about Perry's 
decision. 
"I did go into this thinking this 
is a governor who went ahead 
and let Kelsey Patterson be exe­
cuted," Hampton said. "It all 
happened so fast, to tell you the 
truth.... It's a good day." 
Not for Nico LaHood, whose 
brother, Michael, 25, was 
gunned down Aug. 15, 1996, on 
the driveway of his family's 
home. 
"No one requested to talk to 
us. No one. Nothing," a frustrat­
ed LaHood said after a reporter 
told him of Perry's decision. 
LaHood watched Foster's 
codefendant, Mauriceo Brown, 
die last year in Huntsville and 
had planned to be in the cham­
ber Thursday evening to see 
Foster's lethal injection. 
"For the governor to do that, I 
believe he folded to political 
pressure," LaHood said. 
Over his two-plus terms in 
office, Perry 
has commuted Texas law that 
allows capital murder defendants to be tried simultaneously and it is an issue I think the Legislature should examine," the governor said. 
Death penalty opponents had launched a public relations cam­paign to save Foster, specifically objecting to Texas' unique so­called law of parties, in which . each participant of a capital crime is held equally responsi­ble. 
Hampton, whose appeal to the Supreme Court focused on that issue, estimated at least a dozen of the 402 inmates put to death in Texas since the state resumed carrying out capital punishment in 1982 have been executed under the same law. 
Last weekend, a group picket­ed outside Perry's Austin church. 
"We commend Governor Perry for preventing this miscarriage of justice," said Sue Gunawardena-Vaughn, director of Amnesty International USA's Program to Abolish the Death Penalty. "We also share the gov­ernor's concerns about Texas death penalty law and urge him to examine all injustices plagu­ing the capital punishment sys­tem in his state." 
David Atwood, founder of the Texas Coalition Against the Death Penalty, applauded Perry for recognizing that the death penalty "had been grossly mis­applied in this case." 
Foster and Brown were tried jointly for killing Michael LaHood. Both prosecutors and defense lawyers asked for sepa­rate trials for the pair but the 
trial judge declined 
their requests.

NFL Metno: Ban Vick the equivalency of his dog fighting days

Comments

Bad Newz Kennels where characters called "Ookie," "T," "Q," "P-Funk" and "Funk" established, promoted and bankrolled a vicious illegal interstate dog fighting and gambling enterprise. Their primary concern had nothing to do with love. It was to kill the weak. 
Former Atlanta Falcons quarter­back, Michael Vick, a.k.a. "Ookie," not only financed the venture, but served his social needs by showing off before gamblers who used death as a means of wagering. Witnesses recall Vick per­sonally paying tens of thousands of dollars on lost bets. When Vick entered his guilty plea this week to only a single conspiracy count, he admitted in court documents that he was deeply involved in the venture and endorsed the hanging or drowning of poorly performing dogs. His associates admitted to shooting and electrocuting pit bulls. 
Remarkably, the man whose mini­mum salary was $130 million chose friends in need of financial backing for an ongoing gambling business that tortured and brutally killed animals. Vick not only managed and promoted an operation for hosting dog fights, but also purchased the main staging area that housed, bred and trained dogs. He approved rape stands that tied down aggressive females in heat, and automobile axils implanted into the ground so that a dog could run in a circle without hindering its chain. Vick was the primary source of fund­ing for property improvements, dog food, medicine, travel expenses and purse fees. 
Vick may also face state charges based on an 18-page federal grand jury indictment that outlines many of the sordid, heinous acts that his asso­ciates and other witnesses revealed in vivid detail. While Vick's attorneys deliberated to carefully word his plea in such a way that would prevent state prosecutors from preferring charges, federal witnesses and others yet to be called may compound Vick's legal problems. 
Vick's enterprise began flourishing in 2001. As the number of events increased, so did the size of the purs­es. In 2002, Vick hosted a "Grand Champion Fight" pitting dogs that each won five consecutive fights and sponsored from Maryland and the "Junior Mafia" of North Carolina. Quickly $300 bets grew to $13,000 per sponsor by March 2003. After Vick's dog lost, he personally took a book bag with nearly $23,000 in cash from his car to pay the winning sponsor. His associate then conferred with Vick about destroying the losing dog before ultimately electrocuting it.

Nothing mentions Vick's involvement in side betting, a typical practice among spectators at such contests. However, too many witnesses saw Vick attend numerous fights. In fact, the indictment cites a late 2003 fight at Bad Newz Kennels where federal cooperating witness No. 3 sponsored a dog. The witness was criticized by one of Vick's many regulars after the wit­ness yelled out Vick's name in front of the crowd during the fight. 
One of Vick's Virginia neighbors also owns a condominium in my neighbor­hood. As an entertainment promoter, he knows celebrities, politicians, ath­letes and journalists through gossip and alliances that barely reach the third degree of separation. The pro­moter sought out superstar Vick to become a regular with Vick's crew, attending training and fighting compe­titions in their neighborhood. His first­hand, eyewitness account of how Vick sanctioned the "rolling," or testing of dogs for fights, is gruesome. 
Kennel associates smeared raw ground beef on meek dogs before throwing them into the "box," or blood-splattered walled fighting ring, to watch them be eaten alive. Kittens and puppies whose demeanor was less than vicious, outweighed and outnum­bered, were often chased as a training exercise before eaten alive. Dogs that held promise as an aggressive fighter, however, were kept for further train­ing. 
America's dog fighting subculture is as useless and reprehensible as the Ku Klux Klan. Vick just may be the poster boy who helps end this barbaric and inhumane competition. Fifty dogs were seized from Vick's property. Nationally, nearly three million pit bulls each year are rescued but euthanized for being unfit to adopt. Nobody knows how many are killed by their handlers for poor performance. 
As for Vick, his fate will be deter­mined through three phases -federal court, state court and the National Football League. Vick knowingly spon­sored and sanctioned a death sport, sometimes driving from his home in Atlanta during football season. For example, in the fall of 2003, Vick and associates drove to South Carolina to wager $3,000 on their dog, "Magic." 
The NFL must judge Vick's callous disregard for life and his rampant gambling in light of its corporate stan­dards and ethics. The league should simply reclaim the time Vick wasted on the gambling, mutilating and killing of dogs while an NFL player -ban Vick for six years. After all, nobody can breathe life back into those dogs.

Sensually stunning, suspenseful, and thought-provoking without falling into pomposity, "Sunshine" immerses the viewer in its depths from the instant it begins. Though it senms to have slipped below mueh of thn summer einnma radar, "Sunshine" is a spm~taeular tilm that should definitely be eaught before it leaves theatres.

The last scenario is the synopsis for the recent summer comedy "Superbad," and it's the latest in a string of Judd Apatow projeets featuring horny men, boys and manboys with giant hearts.

After deciding to attempt to board the learus-1, the crew suffers an aeeident that forces them into a fight -not for their lives, but for the life of the human race. This is, of course, an exeellent start to a seience-fiction thriller, but "Sunshine" offers more than that to its viewers.

and the two main char­aeters are named after the pair. The much­revised result of their teen labor is a hilarious raunch-fest that rivals even the Apatow-written and directed "Knocked Up" for the best comedy of the summer. 
Hogen himself co-stars as one of two cops who befriend "McLovin" after a liquor store burglary prevents the boys from getting their beer for the responsibility, and how hard humans are willing to struggle for the survival of their species. 
"Sunshine" succeeds because it cre­ates realistic characters that the audi­ence can learn to like or sympathize with, and then asks them to sacrifice everything for the demands of a humani­ty that remains completely abstract. While many space disaster films, from "Deep Impact" to "Armageddon," contin­ually return to the story back on Earth, "Sunshine" refrains from doing so until the very end, after everything is said and done. Not only does this heighten the movie's sense of claustrophobia, but it also approaches its issues on a very pnr­sonal level. The characters are left alone with their beliefs and their dilemma, and nothing more. 
"Sunshine" is an absolutely stunning study in contrast. It uses every perspec­tive and sense it can, reveling in vibran­cy as much as darkness, strong score as much as silence, and panoramas as much as nearly suffocating close-ups. As a result, simply watching the film is a captivating experience.

Gallo's is eer­tainly a scene to be remembered, employing the same gross-out humor that made "Van Wilder" and "American Pie" instant suceesses. 
However, "Superbad" is more sophisti­cated and sensitive than "American Pie" or any other gross-out comedy we've seen in recent years.

Every cast member does an excellent job of illustrating the multitude of reac­tions to the situations the crew faces and foreing the audience to sympathize with all of them. 
The film is not without its blemishes. Some of the situations feel a bit forced in order to progress the plot -and some of the eharacters remain somewhat pre­dictably heroie -but, on the whole, "Sunshfne" has a strong, uninterrupted storyline. 
Most of its faults can be forgiven in order to enjoy the drama they produce. Furthermore, the plotline is kept (within the realm of science-fiction) believable and understandable. 
If nothing else, "Sunshinn" holds your attention. Because it is suspenseful and exeiting, it ean be enjoyed on a very basic level. For the more interested viewer it can offer more,. and it does so in a way that allows them to eontem­plate without feeling forcn-fed philoso­phy with their popcorn.

Even though they spend the whole movie pursuing beer and babes, all they're really trying to do is hang on to each other. Leaving behind a best friend to go to college is a situation many of us have faeed, but Seth and Evan are more co-dependent than most, and the under­lying tension of their inevitable separa­tion is prevalent throughout their entire adventurous evening together. 
"Superbad" is an extraordinary con­glomeration of talent, and its suecess on the big screen is the result of years of work by Apatow and the group of actors, writers and directors that he has collect­ed around him, with Hill and Cera as its latest additions. 
Just as "Knocked Up" made Seth Hogen a new staple in comedy, "Superbad" is sure to do the same for these two young actors. 
The Frat Pack may have been the reigning kings of comedy in the past few years, but 2007 is the year of Apatow and company. So far, they have yet to disappoint.

By JAMES COSTA Assistant Scene Editor 
In a recent interview promoting "The Bourne Ultimatum," Matt Damon was asked who would win in a fight: Jason Bourne or James Bond? Very dryly, Damon replied that it'd be hard to com­pete with the gadgets and gizmos of Bond. 
In that response, however, Damon unin­tentionally defined the exact appeal of Jason Bourne, and why so many of us have already paid more than an hour's wage to watch his exploits on screen one more time. 
It's pretty simple. Jason Bourne is a man tormented by his inability to realize an identity that has already been defined for him in previous days and years. Thrown into a life of shadows, he must contend with ruthless and violent forces beyond his control as he goes about reclaiming the life that was taken from him. 
Loosely based on the Robert Ludlum novel of the same name, the film is a sequel to "The Bourne Supremacy" and the third flick of the Bourne Trilogy. It stars Damon as amnesiac CIA assassin Bourne with returning cast members Julia Stiles and Scott Glenn reprising their roles from the previous two Bourne films. The film continues the tale of Bourne after he lives through the unsettling "Bourne Supremacy" car chase in Moscow. Keeping with the international flair of the Bourne franchise, the film moves through the locales of Paris, London, Madrid, Tangier and New York City as Bourne searches for his natural identity. 
Differing from the spy swagger and pomp of James Bond is Jason Bourne's pounding silence throughout the film. Commenting on the decrease in spoken dialogue, Damon says, "We realized that Bourne is a lot more effective when he's not 
Of course, the film is wild as hell. Viewers can't forget that Bourne is a fme­ly tuned killing machine caught in a battle of fierce rebellion against the CIA opera­tives who so ably created him. Unfortunately for them, he's remembered enough over the last two movies to realize that he is neither who he thought he was nor the man the CIA thought it created. With this knowledge, Bourne is finally nearing the end of his journey toward redemption. 
The film's treatment of Bourne as a man whose humanity is coupled with his dead­ly side resonates strongly with the film's prevailing theme -the tense and anguished difficulty in surviving while retaining control of one's actions. Perhaps the most refreshing aspect of the film is its reliance on real human beings. Not to crit­icize "Harry Potter," "Cars" or any other movie that heavily relies on computer ani­mation, but audiences can appreciate that the images in the "Bourne" films aren't computer-generated. Especially in today's ever-unstable social climate, the film also hits a strong nerve with its sharp and top­ical realism. The cinematography is also shaky and unstable, an effect resulting from the extensive use of hand-held cam­eras. 
In Jason Bourne, there is a universal element of the everyman, someone won­dering who he is and who he .might be ­if only he could simply run away from it all, just for a chance to get back to where he should be.

talking, so we cut a lot of the original dialogue in the script." In short, the cuts worked. Bourne's silence highlights the perils of mind and body he faces as he struggles towards the film's climax. In place of verbal con­frontation and vocal eruption is a far more menacing and gripping experience of true deter­mination plagued by fear.

Associated Press 

NEW YORK -As a kid, Andy Roddick was hard­pressed to come up with a better birthday treat than going to the U.S. Open with his mom. At 9, he was thrilled to be on the scene while Jimmy Connors made a stirring run to the semifinals. 
''I'd get here for the first match, and I wouldn't Rleave till it was over. Those are probably my fondest memories, just sneaking into the nose­bleed sections," Roddick recalled Thursday. "I actually snuck into the players' lounge one time and stole a cheesecake." 
He still comes to Flushing Meadows at birthday time, nowadays as a competitor -and with a certain James Scott Connors tagging along as his coach. 
Roddick turned 25 on Thursday and marked the occasion by reaching the 
U.S. Open's third round, although not before losing the opening set and mov­ing on when his opponent, Jose Acasuso of Argentina, quit after the third because of a left knee injury. 
"That's the good thing about Grand Slams: You get in the grind, and who­ever doesn't mind the grind wins," Connors said after watching the match through silver wrap­around sunglasses. "The way Andy played today, especially in the second and third sets, is always good. As long as he's play­ing the right kind of ten­nis, that's all that counts." 
A trainer came out to wrap white tape above Acasuso's left knee after the second set, then added another bandage below the knee at the next changeover. By the end, he was as stiff and creaky as the Tin Man in "The Wizard of Oz," barely bending or moving at all, and the score was 4-6, 6­1, 6-2 when Acasuso decided he couldn't con­tinue. 
"I don't think you like winning matches like that," the No. 5-seeded Roddick said. "But at the end of the day, your goal is to get through." 
In other words: no com­plaints. Same for Donald Young, the 18-year-old Chicago native who was 0-11 in tour-level matches until last week and never had won a Grand Slam match until this week. 
Now he's in the Open's third round, and he didn't have to lift a racket Thursday, because his scheduled opponent, No. 13 Richard Gasquet, with­drew, citing a viral infec­tion. 
IN BRIEF 

Ga_y _sets meet record in 
20UM 

SAKA, Japan -Tired and sore, Tyson Gay didn't have energy left to celebrate completing one of the most impressive sprint doubles in the his­tory of the world track and field championships. 
"This was the hardest race of my life," he said. "I couldn't think or nothing. 
"I really couldn't put my arms up to celebrate. I couldn't even really jog on my victory lap." 
The latest dominant American sprinter pulled away from Jamaican Usain Bolt down the straightaway to win the 200 meters Thursday in 
19.76 seconds, breaking the meet record of 19.79 set 12 years ago by American Michael Johnson in Goteborg, Sweden. 
"Tyson is the man to beat right now hands down. He just proved it," bronze medalist Wallace Spearman said. 
Irish football star caught in 
dogfighting scandal 
DUBLIN, Ireland -A star of Ireland's Gaelic football league was exposed Thursday as a director of an illegal dog-fighting club, an under­ground gambling activity that has wrecked the reputation and career of Atlanta Falcons football player Michael Vick. 
The 17 -month undercover investi­gation by BBC Northern Ireland's "Spotlight" program, broadcast Thursday night, found evidence of 15 illegal dog-fighting operations in the British territory of 1. 7 million peo­ple. 
The program secretly filmed Gerard Cavlan, a 31-year-old mem­ber of the County Tyrone Gaelic foot­ball team, discussing his ownership of more than a dozen dogs _ and bragging about how one "hard­mouthed dog" gripped another in its jaws. 
"Sure he had him in the chest, and he shook him and he shook him for 25 minutes," Cavlan said during a conversation filmed covertly in his vehicle.h 
Tiger roars back after week­
long hiatus 
ORTON, Mass. -The crowd fol­lowing Tiger Woods around the TPC Boston grew steadily throughout the morning sunshine until it lined the length of the 18th fairway as he finished his pro-am Thursday at the Deutsche Bank Championship. 

Woods skipped the first round of the PGA Tour Playoffs last week at -­Westchester, saying his body and mind needed a brief vacation after back-to-hack victories in stifling heat, the second title coming at the PGA Championship. 
He looked plenty refreshed on the refurbished TPC Boston during the pro-am round, playing without a bogey and without much effort on his way to a 63.

NFL 
Brees has good control of dangerous offense 
Efficient preseason bodes well for Saints 

Associated Press 
NEW OHLEANS -Rookie Tyler Palko has been learning the Sainl<;' vaunted offense by study­ing starling quarterback Drew Brees' game film from last sea­son. 
Along the way, he's noticed sonwthing that might serve as a warning to defenses all across the NFL. 
"From what I saw with Drew last year on film to how he's operating now in the preseason, he's head and shoulders above what he was," Palko said. "When things are clicking, especially with someone like Drew, you can't be stopped, you can only stop yourself, and that's a fun offense to play in." 
Palko's observations would be onr1 thing if Brees was coming off a mediocre season. But Brees was the runner-up for MVP in 2006 after leading the NFL in passing. 
The Saints' starter, who threw for 4.418 yards and 26 touch­downs last season, is now more than a year removed from com­plicated throwing shoulder sur­gery. !lis arm has looked much stronger throughout the presea­son than it did a year ago, while his comfort with coach Sean Payton's versatile offense appar­ently has improved. 
He completed 90 percent of his passes (35-for-39) to numerous wide receivers, tight ends and running backs during his last three appearances in preseason games, then shrugged off those performances with seemingly no intention of patting himself on the back. 
"I think it's what you expect," Brees said. "In the preseason, you want to look efficient and sharp. That's obviously what I've tried to do." 
In improving from 3-13 in 2005 to a playofl' worthy 10-6 last sea­son. the Saints were fortunate not to have too many injuries at kny positions. If Brees went down. for example, it could be disastrous. 
But in good health, the league's leading offense in 2006 may be even better now. 
Reggie Bush had a tremendous last few months of his rookie sea­son, scoring nine touchdowns in his final seven games. He report­ed for training camp confident and fit, eager to join veteran run­ning back Deuce McAllister in a dynamic backfield that can pun­
ish defenses with power and speed. 
"Both of those guys appreciate what each other brings to the table. I think they both are guys that put the team first and they both want to see us be success­ful," Payton said. "The objective is for us to score enough points to win games. There's a flow to game sometimes that might fea­ture one more than the other. I think there are enough touches and I think there was a year ago for both of those guys to be effec­tive." 
Receiver Marques Colston, one year ago a little-known seventh­round pick from Hofstra, returns primed for a Pro Bowl season as the Saints' No. 1 receiver. The 6­foot-4 playmaker has bulked up by about 10 pounds in the weight room, surpassing 230. He'll be joined by returning starter and big-play threat Devery Henderson, along with veteran David Patten, who may have won the No. 3 receiving job with a strong preseason. 
And a new receiving threat has arrived in tight end Eric Johnson, who when healthy was among the most productive members of San Francisco's passing game. 
Meanwhile, the Saints' defense, which wasn't dominant but held the fort by making clutch stops, should be stronger and deeper. 
The Saints preserved the strength of their defense by extending the contract of defen­sive end Charles Grant, who worked effectively last season with fellow end Will Smith in the pass rush. 
And after last season's success, Payton, the reigning NFL Coach of the Year, didn't have to do much of a sales job to attract free agents. Linebacker Brian Simmons, safety Kevin Kaesviharn and defensive tackle Kendrick Clancy wanted to be in New Orleans, where they're all expected to contribute. Clancy, who was a starter for most of last season in Arizona, has so far unseated Hollis Thomas for a starting job. 
"I think players in our league look for destinations where they can win and places where the lit is right," Payton said. "Part of it is related to the contract and money. But hopefully, we contin­ue to become a place where guys look at, players, coaches or any­one for that matter, as a good spot to work in as an organiza­tion that's a winner." 
LPGA 

Steinhauer leads Classic 
Defending champion Sorenstam finishes day 4 shots back of lead 
Associated Press 
SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -U.S. Solheim Cup player Sherri Steinhauer shot a 5-under 67 in windy conditions Thursday to take a one-stroke lead in the LPGA State Farm Classic, while Annika Sorenstam was four shots back in defense of her last tour title. 
Steinhauer, the last of the 10 automatic qualifiers for the U.S. team for the Sept. 14-16 matches against Europe in Sweden, had five birdies in her bogey-free round on the Panther Creek Country Club course. Winless since the 2006 Women's British Open, Steinhauer played alongside Solheim Cup teammate Angela Stanford 
(72). 
"I think we do consider our­selves teammates out there and we're pulling for each other ... And we were talking about some things with Solheim out there today, and we're just really looking for­ward to the competition," said the 44-year-old Steinhauer, making her 20th appearance in the tournament. 

Sorenstam, the winner last year at the Rail Golf Club, had two birdies and a bogey in a round of 71. On Saturday, Sorenstam announced that she's marrying Mike McGee, her boyfriend of two years. It will be the second marriage for the 36-year-old Swede, who filed for divorce from David Esch in February 2005. 
"I think I played really well today," Sorenstam said. "I hit 16 greens and didn't miss any fairways, so I think I played very, very solid. I had a lot of chances and had a lot of looks out there. If that is any indi­cation of how I'm going to play the next few months I'm happy about it. I'm just going to go out there tomorrow and continue what I'm doing and hopefully it works out." 
Last season at Rail, Sorenstam won the last of her 69 LPGA Tour titles, closing with a 10-under 62 to match the lowest final-round score by a tournament winner in tour history. The tournament moved to Panther Creek this year after 31 seasons at Rail. 
"I thought today was tougher than the practice round and the pro-am," Sorenstam said. "The wind picked up and the ball trav­eled to different places. The greens are getting llrmer and the fairway is getting llrmer." 
Japanese star Ai Miyazato and Marcy Hart opened with 68s. 
"It was very windy today," Miyazato said. "I just tried to make one shot at a time. I had good concentration today, . so I feel very satisfied."

MLB 

Aaron feels n1essage to Bonds is adequate 

Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE In Milwaukee, at least, Hank Aaron remains baseball's home run king. 
Aaron received that esteemed -if now outdated -introduc­tion as he and several other members of the 1957 Milwaukee Braves came to Miller Park on Thursday for a 50-year reunion of their World Series victory. 
While Aaron wasn't willing to hit the road to follow Barry Bonds' pursuit of his career home run record earlier this month, he was thrilled to travel back to Milwaukee to reunite with his former teammates. 
"I am very much enjoying this," Aaron said. "As I men­tioned before, some of these guys I haven't seen for a long time and I wanted to see them." 
Aaron originally said his reluctance to go see Bonds break his record in person was because he was getting older ­hn's 73-and simply didn't like to travel. 
But on Thursday, Aaron said that by not following Bonds around the country, he also could avoid answering ques­tions about whether he suspect­ed that Bonds' achievements came with the help of perform­ance-enhancing drugs -and whether that would taint the record. 
"I guess I kind of stayed out of that, really," Aaron said. "Because I didn't want to get involved. For seven or eight years, I went through a thing where people were talking about all of the other things. 
"If I had decided that I was going to go and follow Barry, or do anything like that, then peo­ple were going to start talking about steroids, and I didn't want to get into that. I didn't want to, didn't have to, so I kind of avoided it." 
Feeling he needed to do something to acknowledge Bonds breaking the record, Aaron recorded a short video tribute that was played on the scoreboard after Bonds hit his record-breaking 756th home run Aug. 7 -a solution that, at least in Aaron's mind. was the best way to bring closure to the situation. 
"I thought it was," Aaron said. "I certainly wasn't going· to fly to San Francisco or fly to Chic~go or anywhere else to be with anybody. I didn't think I had to. Because I wasn't pre­pared to answer all these ques­tions that people were going to have." 
Aaron said that no matter how he reacted publicly to Bonds breaking the record, he was "damned if you do, damned if you don't." 
But above all, he didn't want people to think he was resent­ful. 
"That's not true," Aaron said. "''ve said many times, records are made to be broken. I con­gratulated Barry, and that's enough." 
And with that, Aaron left to join his former teammates for a photo opportunity at a small Braves monument by the youth baseball field adjacent to Miller Park. 
The '57 Braves beat the New York Yankees in seven games in the World Series, and the city of Milwaukee hasn't seen much baseball success since. 
The Braves moved to Atlanta in 1966. The Brewers have made one trip to the World Series, in 1982. 
With the current Brewers team struggling to stay in con­tention in the NL Central race, the consensus among Aaron and the Braves' other stars seemed to be that the young Brewers are still a year away. 
"I've been watching this club," Aaron said. "It's just a young club. I think it's going to take another year before they really get to where they're probably going to be sure of themselves, and I think they're going to be all right." 
Del Crandall, a catcher for the Braves and former manager of the Brewers, said he couldn't offer much in the way of advice. 
"You have a very young ball­club here, and you've had prob­lems with your pitching," Crandall said. "And I don't think anything is going to do them any good except experi­ence, and they will probably all be much, much better [next year]. Everybody would like to win. We couldn't win in 1956. We weren't ready to win." 
After a strong start early in the season, the Brewers have hit an extended slump and went into Thursday night's game in Chicago 1 1/2 games behind the first-place Cubs. 
"Now, can they handle defeat after winning? Can they recover fast enough to make the next run, is going to be the ques­tion," former Braves outfielder Wes Covington said.

NCAA lACROSSE 







Nifong denies wrongdoing 
Associated Press 
DURHAM, N.C. -The former prosecutor who led the now­discredited Duke lacrosse rape ease never intentionally tried to mislead the court and believnd he gave all DNA test results to defense attorneys, a lawyer for Mike Nifong said Thursday dur­ing his criminal contempt trial. 
Nifong turned over all the information during the pretrial discovery phase in his ease against three Duke lacrosse players, said his attorney, Jim Glover. And when he told a judge the defense had all the DNA test results, it was a mis­take -but little more than an oversight. 
"The question is not whether those statements Mr. Nifong made are literally true or liter­ally false," Glover told Superior Court Judge W. Osmond Smith 
III. "The question is were they willfully and intentionally false and were they also part of an effort ... to hide potentially exculpatory evidence, and that's the issue before the court." 
Defense attorneys for the three falsely accused young men asked a judge to punish Nifong for initially telling the court he had turned over all DNA test results when he knew, and failed to diselose, that genetic material from multiple men was found on the accuser -but none from any lacrosse player. 
If held in contempt, Nifong faces up to 30 days in jail and a defense all the DNA testing line of up to $500.

A month later, Nifong learned that a private laboratory determined the genetic material found on the woman was from several men, none of whom were Duke lacriJsse players. 

But Nifong didn't provide that information to the defense until October, and only then amid nearly 2,000 pages of raw DNA test data that defense attorney Brad Bannon testified Thursday took almost all of November to decipher. 
Glover said Nifong believed he was being truthful when he told the judge he had given the

Meehan, who testified later Thursday, denied that Nifong told him to withhold any excul­patory material. He said he con­sidered the DNA results provid­ed to the defense to be an "interim" report since other test specimens had yet to arrive. 
Afterward, Meehan told reporters that he ineluded all test results by referring in the report to other "non-probative" but unspecilied DNA materials -the genetic material found on the accuser.

NFL 
Johnson shakes off rust after ending holdout 
Losman, Edwards are efficient in win over Detroit; Campbell returns from injury looking sharp and healthy 
Associated Press 
ST LOUIS -Larry Johnson got the break-in work he needed while supplying a lackluster Chiefs-Hams preseason finale with just a smidgen of star 'power. 
Johnson, who ended a 25-day holdout earlier in the month. was the only starter of substance for either team who got on the field in St. Louis' 10-3 victory Thursday night. He shook off a bit of rust, carrying three times for 12 yards at the start of the Chiefs' first drive. 
"It was good to get in the game and get a couple carries," .Johnson said. "That's the tough­est adjustment, getting back in the speed of the game and getting your timing down with your olrfmsive linemen." 
Third string quarterback Hyan Fitzpatrick threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Marques Ilagans in the third quarter to give the Hams (2-2) a 10-0 lead. Hagans, battling for an extra reeeiving spot, had four catches li>r 53 yards. 
The Chiefs (0-4) were held to a 40-yard field goal by Justin Medlock late in the fourth quar­ter and wound up winless in the preseason, trailing the NFL with 32 points. Kansas City lost the Governor's Cup game, a contest so uninspiring that the Rams bought the final 900 tickets to ensure a sellout for only the sec­ond time in six seasons. 
The Hams figure to have a 

high-scoring offense featuring Steven Jackson and Marc Bulger, but totaled only 46 points in the preseason. Jackson, who led the NFL with 2,334 yards rushing · and receiving last year, ended the preseason with only two recep­
tions and no carries. 
After ceremonial starts the pre­

vious two games, Jackson spent 
the whole time on the sideline 
watching the Chiefs. 
The Hams gave cornerback 

Fakhir Brown a start before he 
begins a four-game suspension 
for violating the league's sub­
stance abuse policy on Friday. 
Honald Bartell, a second-round 
pick in 2005, will be making his 
first career start in place of 
Brown in the Hams' opener Sept. 
9 at home against the Carolina 
Panthers. 
Chiefs defensive end Jared 

Allen, suspended for a DUI for 
the first two games, also made 
his final appearance before an 
enforced absence. 
Bills 16, Lions 13 
Trent Edwards will watch J.P. 

Losman take every significant 
snap, if all goes well for the 
Buffalo Bills this year. 
If it doesn't, the rookie quarter­

back hopes he can draw on expe­
rience from the exhibition sea­
son. 
Edwards directed a 90-yard 

drive that set up a tiebreaking 
field goal with 1:46 left, and Buffalo recovered a fumble on the ensuing kickoff to seal a win over the Detroit Lions on Thursday night in the preseason finale. 
"It's going to be a long stretch of sitting on the sidelines and watching, so I need to be able to use what I learned in the presea­son," Edwards said. 
Edwards was 18-of-24 for 182 yards, perhaps solidifying a job as Losman's backup ahead of Craig Nall even though coach Dick Jauron said the decision would be made soon. 
"I was really happy with Trent," Jauron said. "He's per­formed so well. He just gets a lit­tle better all the time. He's pretty good to start with, like we said when we drafted him." 
Losman was 5-for-6 over two drives. 
"I felt sharp, personally," he said. ''I'm definitely ready for next week." 
The Lions hope J.T. O'Sullivan is relegated to the sidelines this season, but like Edwards, he gained some needed experience in case Jon Kitna can't withstand 63 sacks as he did last season while taking every snap. 
Jaguars 31, Redskins 14 
Jason Campbell got a much­needed touchdown. Mark Brunell got a loud ovation. And most of the Jacksonville Jaguars got a night off. 
Campbell returned to the start-ing lineup after missing last week's game with a bruised left knee. He was 5-of-5 passing for 54 yards and a touchdown in Washington's loss to the Jaguars on Thursday night in the presea­son finale for both teams. 

Campbell played just one series, but it was exactly what the Hedskins (2-2) wanted to see from the third-year pro. Although he got hit once, he had ample time in the pocket and capped the drive with a 23-yard strike down the sideline to Antwaan Handle El. 
It was Campbell's first touch­down pass of the preseason, an encouraging sign for an ofi'ense that scored just 37 points in its first three games. 
"It couldn't be a better way for him to end the preseason," Brunell said. 
Brunell took over from there, getting plenty of playing time in his first game in Jacksonville as an opposing player. 

-
The face of the Jaguars for nine years, Brunell got a warm wel­come as he jogged onto the field. He didn't get quite the same reception when he threw a 14­yard TD pass to Ryan Hoag late in the first half to give the Redskins a 14-3 lead.

NFL Quinn keeps pushing for Brovvns starting job 
Rookie had to wait his turn, but led team on touchdown drive once he saw the field 

Associated Press 
CIIICAGO -Brady Quinn says he's ready to make an impact for tlw Clnvnland Browns and lw did in the pro­
-season finale. Wilen his next opportunity comes n~mains to be see11. The rookin from Notre Damn was el"fkient, if' unspectacular. leading tlw Browns to a touch­down in a I<J-<J vidory over thn Chicago Bears on Thursday night. Now. it's up to coach Horneo Crennel to decide if' Quinn's time is soorwr or later. Although incumbent Charlie Frye f'e1ds he did nothing to lose his job. Crennel said he won't announce the starter for the snason-operwr against Pittsburgh until rwxt week. "I think the competition has brought out the bPst in me on and ofT tlw field," Frye said. "Made me a stronger person, being able to handle diiTerent situations. It's pwilwd me." Quinn will continue to push if' Frye gets the nod. llis timH is coming for the Browns {3-11, but against tlw Bears, he had to wait a quarter. Frye played the lirst two pos­snssions, complnting two of five passes, and Derek Anderson led a lield-goal drive late in the first quarter before Quinn entered the game. The 22nd piek in the draft, he started the second and was 9-of-14 with 64 yards. lie threw an inter­ception but led a touchdown drivn. Overall, not a bad perform­ance. And not a bad preseason. Quinn was 29-of-45 with 300 yards, three touchdowns and one interception in three pre­season games, after reporting late to training camp because of a holdout. "I think I progressed," Quinn said. "1 think things went well not only for myself, but for our team, our oll'ense. We did a lot good things this preseason." It was not a good night for the Bears, who were shaky on 
-
special teams and lost rookie tight end Greg Olsen to a knee injury late in the first half. He was hurt while getting tackled after catching a short pass and will undergo an MHI. 
Chicago's Danieal Manning fumbled a kickoff near the goal line in the closing seconds of the first quarter after Anderson led the Browns to a field goal, resulting in a safety that gave 
Cleveland a 5-0 lead. Joshua 
Cribbs returrwd a punt 70 
yards for the game's first 
touchdown early in the second 
quartnr. And Quinn led a 50­
yard drive on the Browns' next 
possession that e rHI B d with 
Jnronw IIarrison carrying it in 
from thn 1 . 
Bears starting quarterback 
Hex Grossman left after the 
lirst possession _ a three-and­
out alTair in which he cornplet­
od a pass to Olsen for no gain. 
Cedric Benson had one carry 
for 2 yards. 
Brian Griese came in and 
completed one of three passes 
-a 12-yarder -bnfore giving 
way to Kyle Orton to start the 
second quarter. 
Pro Bowl defensive tackle 
Tommie Harris started for the 
Bears af'ter missing the first 
three preseason games while 
recovering from a season-end­
ing hamstring injury. 
"What did I accomplish in two series?" llarris said, repeating a question. "Just get­ting a feel of preparing for a game, staying at the hotel. get­ting my mind right for the game. I wanted to do that and not go to San Diego (for the season-opener) ... and have to do that for the first time." 
Otherwise, it was an unevent­ful conclusion to a difficult week for the Bears (3-1 ), one that began with linebacker Lance Briggs leaving his Lamborghini alongside a high­way after he crashed it early Monday morning. 
The Bears now can turn their attention toward their NFC title defense. They figure to be test­ed in the opener against the Chargers, where former defen­sive coordinator Ron Rivera is coaching linebackers. 
''I'm excited about using the experience I have from last year, starting 19 games, and hopefully that shows," Grossman said. 
Frye completed a 16-yard pass to Braylon Edwards on the game's first play from scrim­mage but did little else. Anderson was 6-of-9 for 53 yards-21 coming on a pass to Cribbs that set up the 24-yard field goal by Phil Dawson. 
Then, it was Quinn's turn. 
He was 4-of-4 for 27 yards on that touchdown drive as the Browns' lead grew to 19-0. 
"Really across the board, every position was just amaz­ing," Quinn said. "I think you can truly see that.

Rays complete rare sweep 
Associated Press 
BALTIMORE -The Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays finally found a 
city they didn't want to leave. 
The Baltimore Orioles could­
n't wait to get out of town. 
The Devil Hays completed 
their lirst road sweep in more 
than two years, getting a three­
run homer from ILl. Upton in 
an S-6 victory over Baltimore 
on Thursday night that extend­
ed the Orioles' losing streak to 
nine games. 
Josh Wilson and Akinori 
Iwamura also homered for the 
Devil Hays, who trailed in all 
three games of the series. 
Tampa Bay's last road sweep 
came in Cleveland on Aug. 12­
14, 2005, and tho Devil Hays 
hadn't won three straight on 
the road since September of the 
same season. 
"We talked earlier about fin­
ishing strong, and certainly to 
come out and get these three 
games ... it certainly sets us on 
the right track," Wilson said as 
the Devil Hays packed for a trip 
to Yankee Stadium. 
"Now we go into Nnw York," 
Wilson said, "and hopefully 
we'll play them tough and get 
on our way to finishing the sea­
son the way we want to and 
take it into next year." 
Nick Markakis and Kevin 
Millar homered for the Orioles, 
who won the opener of a 10­
game homestand before a 30-3 
loss to Texas began tho skid on 
the same day the team 
announced manager Dave 
Trembley would return in 
2008. 
It's enough to make a team 
want to go to Fenway Park for 
a thrne-game series against the 
AL East-leading Boston Hed 
Sox. 
"Yl~ah, maybe we'll start a winning streak in Boston," Trembley said. "That's the mind-set you've got to have. I don't think there's any other way to look at it. What's done is done." 
It was the worst 10-game homestand in Orioles history, surpassing a 2-8 mark in September 1987. Baltimore surrendered 100 runs to Texas, Minnesota and Tampa Bay­the most the Orioles have ever yielded in a 10-game stretch. 
Baltimore has been outscored 98-3S during the nine-game losing streak, which matches a season high. The last time it happened, in mid-June, the Orioles fired manager Sam Perlozzo after the run reached eight. 
Although the bullpen has received much of the blame for the current slide, Baltimore failed in the clutch Thursday, going 2-for-14 with runners in scoring position. 
"We had some chances to do some things and blow it open," Trembley said, "and we didn't." 
Tampa Bay starter Scott Kazmir (11-8) allowed five runs, four earned, in five innings. He struck out live to raise his single-season club record total to 194. 
AI Heyes gave up an RBI dou­ble to Corey Patterson in the ninth before finishing up for his 22nd save. 
Jeremy Guthrie (7-5) gave up six runs, five earned, and eight hits in six innings. The rookie went 0-2 in six August starts. 
Tampa Bay snapped a 5-5 tie in the sixth. Jonny Gomes led off with a double, advanced on an infield hit by Wilson and scored on a two-out single by Carl Crawford. 

Iwamura homered off Jim IJoey in the eighth to make it 7­5, and Greg Norton added a sacrifice fly in the ninth. That all but assured the Devil Hays their first three-game sweep in Baltimore; Tampa Bay swept a four-game series at Camden Yards in 199S. 
The first three battnrs to faco Kazrnir provided the Orioles with a 3-0 lead. Brian Hobcrts hit a leadoff' double, Patterson reached when Kazmir mis­played his bunt, and Markakis hit his 15th homer on an a 2-0 fastball. 
"We carne out like gang­busters and put three on the board in the first inning and we thought, 'Hey, we're ofT to the races. We're going to break this thing wide open,"' Trembley said. 
But Tampa Bay went ahead with a four-run li1urth. Wilson led off with his first major league homer. and Guthrie got two outs bofore Crawford dou­bled and Carlos Pena walked. Upton followed with his 21st home run, tho fifth in 12 games. 
"ILl. totally shirtod it back. turned the momentum around and gave us a much better feel about it." Devil' Hays manager Joe Madelon said.

Stern ansvvers gambling questions 
Special prosecutor hired to investigate referee betting scandal 
Associated Press 
LAS VEGAS -David Stern detended his current referees, blasted a pair of former ones, and vowed to wait until a review of the NBA's officiating program is finished before he decides on any punishments stemming from gambling activi­ties. 
The commissioner was in Las Vegas on Thursday to watch the United States play Argentina in the FIBA Americas tournament, and it wasn't long before questions turned to gambling. 
The league recently chose former federal prosecutor Lawrence B. Pedowitz to over­see a review of its policies regarding gambling and its ref­erees in the wake of the Tim Donaghy scandal. 
Donaghy has pleaded guilty to betting on games, including some he worked, and providing inside information to others to help them win bets. An ESPN Radio report said the former official was set to name as many as 20 other referees who took part in gambling activity, though not necessarily crimi­nal. 
"There has been no release of any information, there have been leaked news reports about what Mr. Donaghy might have said," Stern said. "We think the fairest way to deal with this is to allow the referees to tell us what the facts are, and our ref­erees are very anxious to tell us what the facts are and then we'll know. And the speculation is hard for them, but we're very much on the same page as we seek to move forward. 

"Many people have been happy to condemn them on the basis of either disgruntled for­mer officials or press reports about what Mr. Donaghy is alleged to have said, and that's not fair." 
The former referees the com­missioner spoke of were Mike Mathis and Hue Hollins, who have been critical in some recent newspaper stories of the current state of the profession under director of officials Honnie Nunn. NBA o!lkials are generally prohibited from speaking to the media. 
"I think that their statements about current referees, whieh they're happy to take shots at, are kind of interesting," St1~rn said. "And I guess that's all I'll say, is that Messrs. Mathis and llollins at the end of their eareers were not model refer­ees. 
"A<> a starr·. the quality is a lot better than when Mr. Hollins and Mr. Mathis were roaming the floor, I might say. Certainly toward the end of their perhaps otherwise distinguished careers, so I'm very protective of our existing officials and their staff and their develop­ment, and I doubt very much that our existing stall' would do to their younger colleagues what Mathis and Hollins now find to be open. So when you talk about officials you should make the point that those are disgruntled former oflieials." 
S1Lern said Pedowitz and his stall' have as much time as they need to conduct their review, whieh will inelude intmviews with referees, and league and team officials. He said there would be "no holds barred." 
But he's not ready to say yet what will happen if more gam­bling aetivity among his o/lieials is proven. NBA pulieies prevent referees from any type or bet­ting, other than trips to tho raec traek during the oflseason. 
"Some of them might have aetua!Jy bought a lottnry ticket, or played bingo in a church. two forms of gambling that I'm sure everyone is vPry familiar with," Stnrn said. "I don't want to pmjudge it, but I think thern am sonw things that would per­haps cause me to pause morf\ than others. 
"And I think that's the prob­lem here, that everyone (says) 'Oh my God. I saw him play, I don't know what you eall it, $5 nassau on the golf eourse.' That's why rather than specu­lat{l about what they did or what would happen if they did it, we agree that the best way to do it is find out what they did and then understand it all."

One of those freshmen, goal­keeper Nikki Weiss, is one of three keepers who has seen playing time throughout the preseason. Weiss, sophomore Kelsey Lysander and senior Lauren Karas received equal playing time, about 30 minutes each in both exhibition games. Coach Randy Waldrum has not decided on a starting keeper and will continue to rotate them until one separates from the others. 
Notre Dame has won 32 straight games at home and has not lost in 41 straight home games. The Irish are 17-2-0 in season openers. 
"It's definitely a whole new set of games, but a 32-game home winning streak is pretty fun," Cinalli said. "We love play­ing at home. Home crowds are so much fun, they really pump us up. Just having all the cheer­

ing and our friends and family here really helps out a lot. I think that support is really key for us." 
Five starters graduated last year, but Cinalli said their spots have been satisfactorily filled. 
"Some of [the freshmen] have filled those roles, we've also had a transfer [junior Elise Weber, from Wisconsin] who's stepped into that hole and is helping with that a lot," Cinalli said. "And then some of the underclassmen have stepped up, so it's been everyone." 
The graduation of Jen Buczkowski and Jill Krivacek left a large hole at the midfield position. Freshmen Lauren Fowlkes, who had a goal against Virginia, should start there, along with juniors Brittany Bock and Becca Mendoza. 
Junior Carrie Dew, back from an ACL injury, will play along­side Weber and sophomores Amanda Clarke and Haley Ford in the backfield, helping to fill the void left by the departure of Christie Shaner and Kim

Lorenzen. Cinalli and Waldrum said Weber has been a great help to the team since joining them this summer. 
Notre Dame is 12-2 against Michigan and defeated the Wolverines 2-0 in Ann Arbor last season. The Wolverines, who were 9-7-6 last season and lost in the first round of the NCAA playoffs, had a 1-1 pre­season record. They defeated Ohio 5-0 and lost to Dayton 2-1. 
Cinalli said Notre Dame's loss to North Carolina in last sea­son's NCAA championship and the subsequent tie this presea­son provided the team with extra motivation. 
"Obviously it was a heart­breaker, the national champi­onship," CinaHi said. "Coming into preseason and playing North Carolina, I mean, we completely dominated them and should have beat them, but we did tie them and so that kind of built our confidence going into the season."

Fran Tolan 

turned out 
at Alumni 
Field on Sports Writer Aug. 19 for the rematch of that final. The Irish played the defending champions to a 2-2 draw in the friendly. But tonight's contest is Notre Dame's first regular­season Irish home game. And the Irish deserve a tremendous home-field advantage. "Last year, the fan support had as much to do with us going to the Final Four as anything," Irish coach Randy Waldrum said. While the crowd for the North Carolina game was a sellout, it was a group com­posed primarily of South Bend natives. Tonight, every student is back on campus, providing the main ingredient for a raucous crowd. "The local community has always been very supportive but it was great last year to have such student support," Waldrum said. "Let's be hon­est, the student body gives the games the great atmosphere." The Irish still are ranked No. 2 nationally despite the loss of five starters from the 2006 national title game. With enough fan support, it'll be easier to assure that the 
Irish will not fall in the rank­ings because of a setback at home. 
The effect of having a huge crowd on their side was evi­dent as the Irish outshot North Carolina 14-7. Because host Notre Dame was able to handily outplay the top­ranked team in the country, it is difficult to imagine that it could drop a match at home. 
Waldrum said that it was energizing to see so many students in the stands last year, even when weather con­ditions deteriorated toward the end of the season. 
Clear skies and warm tern­peratures are expected tonight. With the increased school spirit common to foot­ball weekends, fan participa­tion should swell. 
"We're expecting a packed house," Waldrum said. 
So, after this afternoon's pep rally, help one Irish squad in its first step towards anoth­er possible Final Four appearance. 
"We want [students] to come learn the chants and be loud and harass the other teams," Waldrum said. "We basically want them to do what good fans do." 
Because if they do, the unranked Wolverines don't stand a chance.

diflcrently. Personally, I do not think either merits a suspension lor a semester, but my issue is less with the degree of the punish­menl<> and more with their relative im:onsistency. By refusing to addrnss tl1is inconsbtency, the University has ereated a number of perceptions I mn sure it dons not want circulating among stu­denl'l and fans. 
Onn such perception is that the University considers using drugs a morn significant crime than solicit­ing a prostitute. That would sur­prise mn. This is Notre Dame, right? The place where you can gnt in trouble just for being in an opposite-sex dorm room artor mid­night during the week? I supposn all thP rngulations the University has in placo to make this a chaste eampus do not mean that much. 
Just imagine the next time somebody rneeives a Rnsl ,i(i.~ lcJr breaking parietals. The obvious response of the student would be, "Well, I only broke parintals. Maybe next time I should go out and find a prostitutn inst1md. The University ean barnly touch me." Is this the message ResLile wishes to snnd to students? 
Maybe the University has aeted similarly in the past rogarding prostitution and handled the ca.s1~ similarly to Hand's. If so. then HesUii.l still contradicts tim striet rules it has established over many years regarding sexual rdations. 
Another perception tim University has created is that it favors football players over other athletes and students. I am eertain it does not want to create this per­ception. In the past, Heslife has used a still' hand when dealing with football players. Two years ago, when former fullback Hash<m Powers-Neal was arrested on charges of driving under the influ­ence, Hesl jfi~ suspended him from any extracurricular activities ­whieh meant missing the last half of his final season. Basml upon the precedent the University set in the cases of Powers-Neal and McAlarnny, its treatment. of I land i'l suspect. 
If the poliw had arrested a n~gu­lar student lew solicitation, tlwm would be no thron-game suspml­sion. It is hard to see HesLili dol­ing out a slap on tim wrist whnn possessing martjuana equates a semnstnr-long suspension. Let me be clear-I am not saying tlw University favors football players -but given this set of circum­stances, that argument can cer­tainly be made. In this partiwlar ea<>P. perception is just a'> impor­tant lL'> rnality. 
It is hard to know the spndfk cireumstancns surrounding I land and MeAlarnny beeausn HnsLili1 refuses to diseuss individual <:a<;es. This policy, though dnsig1111d to proteet student privacy, contribu­tions to pnreeptions that ean some­times damagn the reputation of this University.

No.1 UCLAawcrits in season deb·ut 
No. 9 Irish try to snap losing streak against top-ranked opponents 
By DAN MURPHY A'sociate Sports Editor 
Notre Dame has faeed a No. 1 ranked team five times in program history. The result has b{Hm the same each timH: an Irish loss. 
But No. Y Notre Dame has a ehance to start its 2007 season with a bang by reversing that trend against top-ranked UCLA tonight. 
Four of the live losses have come at the hands of in-state rival Indiana -the most recent loss to the then-No. 1 Hoosiers being a 2-0 defeat in 2004 -and tht~ l'ifth was another 2-0 loss to Connecticut in 1YY8. The Irish were shut out in all live contests. 
"To start oiT the season beat­ing anyone is special, whether they are No. 1 or just another good team," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. "The important thing in this game ls that we have to look after OU 1 ~selves." 
The UCLA match is part of the Adidas/IU Classic in Bloomington, Ind. The tourna­ment is in its 25th year and features four top-1 0 clubs this season. It has hosted the even­tual national champ nine times since 1982. 

The Bruins were only one goal away from elai ming their own national crown last year, but lost 2-1 to UC-Santa Barbara in the title game. UCLA returns eight starters from that squad and 16 total players -all of whom are hungry for a second chance at a championship. 
One key loss from last sea­son's UCLA squad was goal­keeper Erie Reed. But sopho­more Brian Perk, who takes over the starting role, played with the U.S. Under-20 National Team and was recent­ly named to the pre~:eason All-

Irish travel to Tiger In-vitational 
Team hits the road hoping to rebound after rough week 
By ELLYN MICHALAK 
Sports Writer 
After two tough loses against No. 9 Minnesota and No. 7 Florida, Notre Dame will look for its first wins of the season this weekend in the Tiger Invitational in Columbia, Mo. 
"We played two tough teams last week," coach Debbie Brown said. "We played and hit much better against Florida than Minnesota. We hope to con­tinue this upward trend and improve both our play and our record." 
The Irish lost to Minnesota 3-0 in the first game of the weekend. The Irish played a closer match against the Gators, but Flordia won in four games. 
Though this weekend's tournament traditionally has four participants, Florida A&M withdrew from the field

Going back to a familiar unknolf\7ll 
In 2007, Irish fans stop back into the unknown. 
Some people dmad the unknown and limr that 2007 
will bring dis­appointing n~sults. Af'tnr all, who could blame them for thinking that way'! Last season, everybody 


knew who

team. Quinn, Samardzija and Walker wern known quanti­tins. Thny worn rnliable, consis­tent and brought with thmn tho security of a good snason, but thosn days of security are now ovnr. 
This season is for those who rnlish the unknown and the ehanen to tak11 a journny that is sure to hold moments of both disappointment and exdtmnent. 
The first and most obvious unknown is at the quart1~rback position. Somo have callnd mad1 Chal"lin WPis arrogant for not rnvnaling his starting quar­tPrba<:k narlier, but in r11ality. what dill"nrnncn dons it nmlly make wh~llwr or not fans learn the startPr Saturday morning or if they had lnarned a month ago? Tho startnr dons not have to dPal with all the preseason buildup of being Notre Dame's quarterback and maybP it will confusn (;norgia Tech. Maybe it will not. but it does not hurt to try. 
Fans should be eonlidnnt knowing that whoever gains the starting job had to bnat out two vnry good candidates this train­ing 1:amp and will be ready to take t.hn linld Saturday. Come Sunday morning, the question, "Who is tho starter'?" will be a distant memory and all thn talk will he about the play of the quartnrbaek. Hegardless. there is little to fimr given tlw talent at the position and Weis's ability to develop his quartNbacks into national stars, as he did with 
Quinn. 
On defense, the Irish bring back some familiar faces, such as defensive end Trevor Laws, linebacker Maurice Crum Jr. and safety Tom Zbikowski. The unknown hern is whether Corwin Brown's nnw 3-4 per­sonnel scheme can stop big plays and keep the Irish in games when they may not score bunches of points. 
Based on the results of sum­mer camp, the Irish are pushing thmnselves harder than ever on defense. Sophomore Darrin Walls beat out traditio 'lal starter snnior Ambrose Wooden for the cornerback spot oppmite Terrail Lambert. The competition for nach defensive spot must have been intense and only makes the secondary better in the end because everybody ha;; to push harder everyday in practice. 
Nobody knows what to expect from anybody this sea:mn. Hemember 2005, and having that feeling of uncertainty that the season could comf: crashing down or, if a couple things went right, could be memorable? 
I have the same feeling. 
Notre Dame has a roster mixed with veterans and younger players with 11ntapped potential. They face a sehndule, which, on paper, is among the hardest in the nation. Expectations should be low. 
But after all, this is Notre Dame-a place where the term "low expectations" doesn't exist. Maybe Notre Dame ca.n win 10 games and make it to another BCS bowl game, but the odds are that will not happen. 
Just have a little patience while some of the younger play­ers lind their groove c.nd this season could be a special one. In other words, wekomfl back to the unknown.

Running backs look to establish offense 

By JAY FITZPATRICK Associate Sports Editor 
Travis Thomas spent almost all of last season on defense and special teams -a depar­ture from his natural position of running back -in order to hnlp bolster the Irish defense with speed. 
But Saturday, the fifth-year senior captain returns full-time to the offensive backfield and can already visualize the big plays he wants to make against Georgia Tech. 
"1 think everyone is excited right now, hopefully," Thomas said. ''I'm just looking forward to the first hit," 
Thomas is one of live running backs at head coach Charlie Weis' disposal this season, along with senior Junior Jabbie, sophomore James Aldridge and freshmen Armando Allen and Robert Hughes. The stable of running backs has allowed offensive coordinator Mike Haywood to expand his rushing attack in preparation for the Yellow Jackets. 
"You have different types of backs," Haywood said. "You have power backs, you have speed backs, and when you're going into all your different personnels -maybe three tight end sets, two tight end sets, three receiver sets -you spin backs in and out just to see how do they react versus this, how do they protect this blitz." 
The variability in the back­field is one of the biggest changes from last year's offense, when then-junior Darius Walker had 60 percent of all rushing attempts and 67 percent of all rushing yards for the Irish. 
Although having more run­ning backs available means each player gets less playing time, Thomas sees it as a bene­fit. 
"With the diversity that we have, it allows me to not only do certain things, maybe neces­sarily a little bit better than some of the backs," Thomas said. "But it allows me to get a rest in, and, you know, stay fresh, which is something not a lot of teams can do because they may not necessarily have the depth at this position." 
One reason the offense has so many backs at its disposal is the quick change the two fresh­man backs have made to col­lege football. 
"The freshmen are adapting pretty fast, surprisingly, and things are going pretty good," Aldridge said. "The older guys help out. Even though I'm a sophomore, I've been here for a while so I'm willing to help any­body out." 
And Aldridge himself is ready to start taking meaningful handoffs -something he had to wait on last year after a knee injury sidelined him for the first six games of the season. 
"I feel good. I mean, it's time to play. I'm past all the injury stuff and I'm ready to play now," Aldridge said. "Now I can do things that I wanted to do. No limitations, so I'm excited about it." 
The running backs will have the important task of taking the pressure off whichever quarter­back lands the starting job. Haywood and center John Sullivan said the most impor­tant thing a young quarterback can do is establish a rushing attack early, which will be a focus of this weekend's game. 
"When you run the ball effec­tively it allows for play action and just more passes in gener­al," Sullivan said. "It means they have to put more defend­ers in the box to try and stop the run. That's if you run the ball effectively though, which of course will be one of our goals." 
Another step in creating a better situation for the "quarter­back is for the running backs to perfect their pass protection schemes. Going against a Georgia Tech defense that Haywood calls "dial-a-blitz," the running backs have to be ready to protect the new signal caller. 
"You have to be conscious of your protections and your ­responsibility on every play knowing that they could throw something at you at any time, and we're expecting that," Thomas said. 
The running backs have focused on preparing for the blitz throughout their game planning. Haywood said they have spent two individual prac­tices solely focused on pass pro­tection and have gone against the linebacker squad in prepa­ration. 
The practice is important, Aldridge said, because of the difference between high school and college pass rushes. 
"In high school you may have somebody running in there and you can just butt them and the quarterback can throw the ball off," Aldridge said. "But in col­lege you really have to strain the gut to protect the quarter­back." 
Regardless of the quarterback on Saturday, the Irish offense will look to its tailbacks to ease the transition from backup to starter. 
"Whenever you have a young offense, you try to take as much practice off the quarterback as you can," Haywood said. "What we're trying to do is take pres­sure off the quarterback. put more pressure on more experi­enced players we have on our team."

Into his place step two play­ers that were on Georgia Tech's roster during the game last September in Atlanta but were hardly household names -running back Tashard Choice and quarterback Taylor Bennett. 
Choice was the Yellow Jackets' starting running back against the Irish last year, but he carried only 14 times for 58 yards. 
Bennett was thn back-up to tlwn-starter Heggie Ball and had only snen action in three previous games. lie did not play against the Irish. 
Fast forward to a year later and Choice and Bennett make up a backfield duo that has Yellow Jackets fans excited about their offense. 
game against 
Notre Dame, 

but then-offen­sive coordinator Patrick Nix decided to concentrate on the passing game. 
"We didn't run the football as much, we didn't convert on that many third downs," Choice said. "Last year we had a chance to win the game but we came up a little short. We knew that we could compete with anyone. This season we want to show people that we can go into a hostile environ­ment and win games like that and do that for the course of the season." 
Bennett can point to his per­formance last year against the Mountaineers as proof that he can play well in big games. He threw for 326 yards on 19-for­29 passing and two touch­downs. 
"[The Gator Bowl] helped 
him tremendously," Yellow Jackets coach Chan Gailey said. "I think it helped every­body tremendously. The more experience you have, and the more positive experiences you have, it helps you." 
For his career, Bennett has completed 45 percent of his passes for 668 yards, with six touchdowns and two intercep­tions. 
But Weis said what impressed him most on film was Bennett's composure. 
"The thing that stood out about this kid is he shows very good poise," Weis said. "He has a strong arm. I think he's a very good athlete." 
Bennett will have to be poised coming into a hostile environment at Notre Dame Stadium against the new defensive scheme of the Irish under defensive coordinator Corwin Brown. But Gailey said his quarterback will be up to the challenge. 
"I think that our guys can make the adjustments that are necessary," he said. "The experience factor really plays a big part into that." 
Although Bennett has yet to start a true road game for the Yellow Jackets, Gailey said Bennett will be unfazed by the mystique of Notre Dame. 
"You can't let the situation get to you," Gailey said. "Our guys have been in some pretty tough places to play in and have been successful, so l don't think I have to go make a long speech about the Four Ilorse!llen or anything."
