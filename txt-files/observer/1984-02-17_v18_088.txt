One of the nations's most prominent Protestant theologians is considering leaving Notre Dame to take a position in Duke University's Divinity program, The Obseroer has learned. 
Stanley Hauerwas, a tenured professor, said he would not make a final decision until Duke's tenure committee decided ifit would offer him tenure. 
"I think he (University President Father Theodore Hesburgh) is wrong in many of his policies, both with respect to this department and the University, hut I don't want to pick a fight with Hesburgh," he said, declining to be interviewed about why he is leaving until his decision is final. 
The Dean of Duke's divinity school Dennis Campbell, denied whether he has been in touch with Hauerwas. 
"I certainly would not talk to the press about any faculty matters," strong in -Christian ethics." 
McBrien said he and other depart· ment chairmen in the country fol­low a similar recruiting procedure. They keep in touch with prominent professors in their field so that if a problem develops for a professor at another school they can make him ticized from the left for

Two arcade games were broken into at Stanford Hall sonwtimt· last week.

Empty dining halls solution to student apathy 
Try to imagine this scenario: It's noon on a Wednes­day and the campus is alive with students hurrying to and from their classes. As they walk along the pathways they smile and say hello to people they recognize. It seems to be a normal afternoon at Notre Dame. But something is different and you can't quite tell what it is at first. Then you realize -nobody is entering or leaving the dining halls. The vast dining rooms of the cafeterias, usually the hotbed of conversation and the place to relax with your Obseroer, lie darkened and silent. 
This is exactly the way John Borkowski would like it to he. 
Borkowski is the director ofthe Notre Dame chapter ofthe World Hunger Coalition. The Coalition organizes the Wednesday Fast program. Those who sign up for the fast agree to skip lunch on Wednesdays in exchange for having the dining hall administrators give the group S 1 which goes towards feeding hungry people both in the South Bend area and in

One can hardly be unaffected hy the photographs in the newspapers and national news magazines of the poor children of third world nations with their bloated bellies and crying eyes. But all too often we just put it out of our minds and inwardly promise to send some money just as soon as we get some. 
But the Coalition is offering students at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's the opportunity to do something right now. 
At the risk ofsoundinglike an UNICEF ad, this really is a small sacrifice on our part and can mean so much to somebody else. People who participate in the fast may be hungry, but they know that they can go to dinner hetween 4:30 and 6:00 and eat all they want. The peron

who benefits from the $1 that the skipped lunch 
provides has no such guarantee. 

Whether it is a result ofthe recent conservative trend on campuses or from the pressure to succeed in the highly competitive job market, most students are not socially active in organizations that help people. And this is a sad turn ofevents. 
Says Borkowski, "It's not a whole lot to give up, hut I don't think that's the major reason people should sign up for the fast. We get so used to having so much that it's 


maintained over the past century. It sees us as supporting the ideals of the Cath­olic church, including relief to those too poor to feed themselves, and expect us to live up to these ideals. But the apathy of the students towards social issues shows we are more concerned with advancing ourselves in the all-impbrtant job market. 
By signing up to participate in the fast, we can prove we do care enough to help. Although it will probably never happen, ifeverybody chose to ahstain from eating lunch on Wednesdays, if the dining halls stood empty during this time, we could make a statement proving that we really do care. We could set ourselves apart from other universities with this small sacrifice. And thousands of people would benefit from the money raised by a campus-wide fast. 
Ivy Award or not, the food isn't all that great to hegin with, and with I00 percent participation we could final­ly live up to our image.

Ingredients ready for tonight's start of annual Junior Parents' Weekend 
By KEITH E. HARRISON,JR. 
StaffReporter 
A cocktail dance featuring international hors d'oeuvres. 
A dinner for 3,800 people. 
And a brunch with former football running back and 
Notre Dame alumnus, Rocky Bleier. 
These are the main ingredients for the February phenomenon known collectively as Junior Parents Weekend. 
The three-event, which begins today "gives juniors an opportunity to show their parents the academic, religious, and social aspects of Notre Dame," said Stephen Smith, an executive coordinator of the weekend. 
A cocktail dance at the ACC tonight will kick off the weekend. The theme for the event, "A Taste ofTravel," was conceived by William Hickey, director of Food Service. Fourteen hors d'oeuvre booths will be located in the con­course of the ACC, and each booth will feature a certain country and serve that nation's national food. In addition, all the chefs will be dressed in the traditional clothing o: the nation they represent. 
Hickey, whose food service is preparing all the food for the weekend, said, "Food for cocktail parties is usually kind of dull and unexciting. I think that the international idea will add flair to the event." 
There will be two different dance areas at the cocktail party. The Bill Porter Orchestra will provide the big band sound on the basketball floor area, while a disc jockey will add more contemporary music in the Monagram Room. 
Saturday's big event will be the President's Dinner. AI· most 4,000 people are expected to attend the dinner, which will include stuffed breast of chicken and flaming baked Alaska. University President Father Theodore Hes· burgh and Junior Class President Vince Hockett will be featured speakers. 
Another highlight of the weekend will be Sunday's closing brunch. Beginning at 10:30 a.m., the brunch will include a 15-minute audio-visual presentation lifthis year's junior class. Notre Dame alumnus and former Pittsburgh Steeler Rocky Blier will be the special guest speaker. 
"We were looking for a dynamic, upbeat Notre Dame personality to be the guest speaker," said Mike Schmutz, chairman of Junior Parents' Weekend. "We think Rocky will end the weekend on an exciting note." 
There is no reserved seating for the Sunday brunch. 
This year's JPW will differ slightly from previous ones. First, a number of new activities have been added to the agenda for Saturday afternoon. "Traditionally, there has been a bit ofa lull between the college workshops on Satur­day morning, and the Junior Class Mass that evening," said Smith. "We hope that our additional activities will eliminate that lull." 
As part ofthese added events, both the Notre DameJazz Band and the campus singing group Shennanigans will per­form in Washington Hall. Although not officially part of JPW, former Reagan Campaign Manager John Sears will speak at the Memorial Library Auditorium Saturday at 3:j0 p.m. 
Several other changes have been made for Junior Parents' Weekend this year. Due to increased participa­tion, the Sunday Mass has been moved from Sacred Heart Church to the ACC. Also, after the President's Dinner, four chartered buses will take the students and their parents from the ACC to the hall receptions. The buses will also he available after the the receptions to shuttle parents back to the ACC parking lot. 
Junior Parents' Weekend is strictly a student-organized event. The JPW planning committee was advised by james McDonnell, director of Student Activities. "I can honestly 
"The people in charge of .Junior Parents' Weekend are the hardest working committee on campus." 
say that the people in charge ofJunior Parents' Weekend are the hardest-working committee on campus," said McDonnell. This year's weekend "will he the best one ever," he added. 
The Junior Parents' Weekend was founded j4 years ago by former Director of Public Relations]. Arthur Haley. In its early years, JPW had a slightly different format. In the late sixties, for example, parents were invited to sit in with their sons during Saturday morning classes. 
In 1970. the JPW featured student discussions on issues such as coeducation, conscientious objection, and the quality ofeducation at Notre Dame. It also included a con­cert by the rock group Fifth Dimension. 
Schmutz said "most ofthe parents have made their hotel reservations long ago." Those who have not may be in for quite a search. All of South Bend's major hotels are com­pletely booked for this weekend.

Two assaults occur at ZZ Top concert 
ByTRIPP BALTZ 
StaffReporter 
Two separate incidents involving assault occurred at the ZZ Top con­cert held last Thursday at the Notre Dame ACC. 
Mike Renaud of Stanford Hall was taken to the St. Joseph Medical Cen­ter and treated for a mild concussion and multiple lacerations to the face. He was struck by a chain-wielding youth who was not apprehended,by authorities because of Security offi­cials' difficulties in his description and in gaining access to the arena floor where the incident occurred. 
Two youths allegedly demanded the tickets of a young couple in an­other incident outside the football stadium. Director of Security Glenn Terry said, "The incident was probably entirely false. We have reason to believe the couple was merely attempting to get into the concert and never had tickets in the first place." The two reported that they were held at knifepoint by two assailants who took their tickets. 
The assailants did not, however, take the purse of the young lady nor the wallet of the young man. Both are residents of South Bend. Assis­tant Security Director Rex Rakow said, "We've had incidents of stolen tickets reported before. But never when just the tickets were taken." 
Renaud raised questions about

the role security played on the eve­ning of the concert in a meeting yes­terday with Dean of Students James Roemer. ··security failed to get the guy who did it. Now my insurance will have to pay the hospital bill," he said. 
"The seating arrangement could 
have been better," Renaud con­
tinued. The arrangement on the 
arena for the concert was festival 
seating, meaning there were no 
chairs on the main tloor. "It was so 
packed," said Renaud, "that it was 
difficult for my friends to get me out 
after I was hit." 
Renaud said the youth who struck 
him was pushing toward the front to 
get a better view. The youth shoved 
him, and Renaud said there was 
"continual pushing going on. After a 
while, the shoving stopped and I 
thought I was going to get to see the 
concert. The next thing I know, I 
was lying on the ground." Some 
concert-goers nearby said the as­
sailant ran from the scene after 
Renaud was hit. 
Dean Roemer said, "There was 
not much more security could have 
done about the incident. Mike was 
immediately taken to the hospital by 
a paramedic team made available for 
the concert. The way security 
handled the occurrence was very 
professional . " 
Security has no new informa .tion on the suspect.

Student apathy 
Dear Editor, 
We do not live in the world that George Or­
well depicted. ln his story, free will seems 
hopelessly lost whi\e man submits himself to 
~he compulsion of 1'.\1!. Brother. Aut­
horitarianism ultimately ec\\Qses the brief, 
shining moments ofresistence and freedom. 
Orwell's important message leaps over the actual conditions of our year 1984. Whether or not we fall into his terrifying predic ~ions depends on our ability to recognize and practice the fundamental difference between Orwell's story and our own world. 
We can be more than reactors like the characters in 1984. We have the privilege ofa free press even now in our own Observer. We can use the press's power to communicate powerfully. The press can convey anything from a newsworthy "contrived ... show," to reports about politicians' unacknowledged accomplishments. 
If we dislike The Observer's practices, we can change them personally by working on The Obseroer staff. How many times we pass the notices calling for help while we turn to the comics. Ifour lunchtime conversations fall into complaints about the news (and even, unimaginably, about The Observer,) we un­consciously submit ourselves to the Orwel­lian world. 
We complain without acting to resolve our complaints -we become submissive instead of positively act ive. Orwell alerts us to this danger of becoming apathetic automatons directed by our own society. We do have the minds to criticize and dissent, and we are for­tunate enough to live in a society where we can freely change our actions into con­structive responses to the problems which our criticism discover. 
Have we freely chosen to be students at Notre Dame? Maybe there were parental, academic, goal oriented pressures which swayed our decisions to become domers. Yet 
that one decision already made and kept does 
not release us from the responsibility of 
making subsequent decisions and actions. 
Perhaps we are apathetic because of the "unclear role," of Student Government. Pt:r­haps we fed tired of watching clashes be­tween the Administration and Student Government -clashes that usually seem to resolve in the "administration's favor." 
We see interaction between Student Government and Aoministration in terms of competition -terms that necessitate a win­ner and a loser pitting their strengths against one another. Is it a good training session for life in the "real world," or is it possibly an im­pediment preventing the emergence of a more powerful force called cooperation? 
Fifty-five and one tenth percent of the ND 
studepts determined the people for political 
positions in the Student Government. Yet all 
of us here -100 percent of the constituency 
-necessarily share concerns which the Stu­
dent Government addresses. 
Seemingly, people with similar goals and ideals (like the crowd drawn together at a uni­versity) would benefit far more by learning to cooperate -a skill which can compound everyont:'s strengths, a vital resource for the future. 
Do we think that our apathy and our com­plaints will speak for our ability to assume greater charge over our student lives? Even now, as evidenced by our less than rousing voting patterns, we fail to use our full capacity to "recommend." How can we assume the responsibility to "legislate," ourselves, when we find ourselves too busy to trudge all the way to LaFortune or to our dorms to vote? 
We can shrug it all off and say that there is 
no issue particularly important which we can 
address while we are college students. Yet I 
wonder when the isues do become important. 
And I wonder if, when they do become impor­
tant, we will know how to meet them. Or will 
we turn our clocks back to 1984?

Picks Soviets and Czechs 
Vairo predicts medal-round teams 
Associated Press 
SARAJEVO, Yugoslavia -When the Olympic hockey tournament en­ters its medal round today, Lou Vairo will look like a pretty good hand­icapper. 
"I said a few months ago, and my opinion never changed, that the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia were the class of the field here," Vairo, the U.S. hockey coach, said. "The Czechs are very good but not as good as the Soviets. The Soviets score much more. · 
"In the next grouping were teams like the United States, Canada, Sweden, Finland and West Germany, who would all be competing to get into the medal round with the Rus­sians and Czechs." 
Vairo was right. The Soviets and Czechs stormed into the medal round with 5-0 records. Canada was 4-1, with crucial victories over the Americans and Finland, and Sweden was 3-1-1. 
Canada takes on the mighty Soviets and the Swedes play Czecho­slovakia in the medal-round opeJIIers. Sunday, the final day of the Olympics, it will be Sweden-Canada 
and  Czechoslovakia-Soviet  Union.  
The  team  with  the  best  overall  
record wins the gold medaL  

In a fifth-place playoff on Friday, 
it's Finland and West Germany, while the United States, assured of its worst finish ever in Olympic hockey competition, faces Poland for seventh place. Vairo gave his team Thursday off"as a refresher." 
For Canada to have any shot at a gold or silver medal, it must beat the Soviets. Canadian Coach Dave King thinks his players will get some in­spiration from speed skater Gaetan Boucher, who has won both of Canada's gold medals here. 
"Hey, that's really something to 
see a Canadian athlete come through like that, especially when you beat the Russians," King said. "We always think Russians are machines yet Boucher beat them all. so it defeats that awe that you think the Russians are all machines and bionic and they don't make mistakes." 
"The Olympics are the top com­petition and we have had good preparation," he added. "It looks like we're in good shape. But we have two games we must win left."

Big day for U.S. 
Johnson, Hamilton both win golds 
Associated Press 
SARAJEVO, Yugoslavia -Bill Johnson and Scott Hamilton carried the flag for the United Stat~ yester­day, winning double gold at the Win­ter Olympics. Johnson brashly took the downhill, while Hamilton apologized for not being better in the finals ofmen's figure skating. 
Johnson and Hamilton salved the spirits of the U.S. Olympic team, whose medals output had been sparse, with only one gold and a total of three medals before their vic­tories. They put the U.S. in sole pos­session offifth place in the standings, with five medals. The Soviet Union leads with 20, but both nations have three golds. 
Both were historic triumphs. Johnson's was the first ever by an American man in Olympic alpine skiing, and Hamilton's broke a 24­year drought ofgold in an event that once belonged almost solely to the United States. 
Hamilton, dressed in red, white and blue, waved a huge American flag on his victory skate around the Zetra rink. He was the first American· to win the men's figures since David Jenkins in Squaw Valley in 1960, and he won despite finishing second to Brian Orser of Canada in the 
freestyle program. 
"I feel like I just fell off the edge of the world," Hamilton, of Denver, said. "I did it. I waited a long time for this. I can't even describe my feelings." 
Johnson, a flip 23-year-old from southern California, summed up his feelings, and perhaps those of his teammates, too, after winning downhill gold. 
"This is both America's medal and mine," he said. "Now America has 
it." 

It was not a perfect day for the U.S. team. There was a surprising second place in the short program of women's figure skating for Rosalynn Sumners, and speed skaters again were shutout of medals. In the women's downhill, the best U.S. fmish was 16th, by Holly Flanders of Deerfield, N.H.

But Johnson's searing run down 
an icy mountain provided the spark, 
and the stars and stripes exploded 
with Hamilton's performance at 
night. 
On the technical side, Hamilton 
got three 5.6's out of a perfect 6.0,

Young skiier wins downhill 
Associated Press 
SARAJEVO, Yugoslavia -Switzer­land's Mic.:hela Figini rocketed down Mount Jahorina and into Olympic history yesterday, winning the women's downhill to become the youngest gold medalist ever in Alpine skiing. 
The 17-year-old's .05-second ad­vantage over teammate Maria Wal­liser also set an Olympic record for closest victory margin in a downhill. 
"The track was very good today," Figini said. "There was sun. I skied well on virtually the entire track. I may have made a few mistakes, but everyone made them." 
Figini, who won her first World Cup event only rwo weeks before the Olympics, covered the course in 1 minute, 1'3.36 seconds. 
Walliser, the World Cup downhill leader, slipped coming out of the starting gate, but recovered instant­ly and hit the finish line 1,965 meters away in 1: I 3.41. 
An elated Olga Charvatova, who started I6th in the field of32 racers, finished third in 1:13.53 to give Czechoslovakia its first-ever Alpine medal in Olympic competition. Her run also prevented a Swiss medal sweep by knockingAriane Ehrat into fourth place by .42 seconds. 
The course was well suited for the Swiss skiers, who excel at gliding ­keeping their skis flat on the snow. But it didn't please the top American finisher, Holly Flanders of Deerfield, 
N.H. She was 16th in 1:15.11. 
''I'm a downhiller, not a giant slalom skier," Flanders said. "I was out almost a second in the giant slalom turns in the middle sections. The gates were set like a giant slalom, not a downhill." 
Although snow was falling, visibility was generally good for the downhill, which twice had been postponed because of bad weather. The most recent cancellation oc­curred Wednesday after three ofthe top-seeded skiers had finished and another lost a ski in a bump. 
The 20-year-old Walliser, who won last year's pre-Olympic race on this mountain, was disappointed at failing to repeat. For a time, she stood silently at one side ofthe finish area while a beaming Figini ac­cepted congratulations on the other. 
But the two Swiss youngsters finally skied to each other, embraced and kissed, although Wal­liser's face showed little emotion. 
"Naturally, I came here to win," Walliser said. "I did not, but still it's a great day for the-Swiss." 
Charvatova and Walliser each had the fastest time -22.20 seconds ­at the first intermediate point. Figini's 22.34 was only seventh best. And Charvatova's 48.86 at the second time stop was .I9 better than Figini. 
But Figini made up valuable hundredths through the bumps and jumps near the bottom of the 28­gate course, which has a vertical drop of 1,805 feet from the start house to the finish.

1982-83 Athlete ofYear 
Casey nears end of final season 
By KATHY MURPHY 
Saint Mary·~ Sports Editor 
The 19H2-83 Moose Krause Award, given annually by The Ob­server to the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's Female Athlete of the Year. will be presented to Saint Mary's senior swimmer Gail Casey tonight at halftime: of the Saint Mary's­Aquinas College basketball game. 
Casey, a Communications and English major from Holmdel, N.J., has been a member of the varsity swim team for the past four years. She, however, began to swim at age four. 

Cougars· 
continued/rom page 16 
BYll coach Ladell Andersen says. 
"He's as good as any player I've 
coached (in I 0 years) in college 
hall." 
The job of guarding Durrant 
tomorrow will fall heavily into the 
hands of Jim Dolan, but Donald 
Royal and Cec il Rucker will also get 
to share some ofthe fun task. "Jimmy 
wants him," says Phelps. 
It shouldn't be suggested that 
Brigham Young is a one-man show, 
though. Senior Brett Applegate does 
his share for the Cougars, especially 
on the hoards. The 6-8, 220-pounder 
averages almost 12 rebounds a 
game. 
Applegate is also the BYlJ leader 
in steals with 33 in addition to being 
the second-leading scorer on the 
team, contributing 16 points a game 
while playing close to 36 minutes 
each outing. 
Freshman Mike Smith mans the 

last spot up front for BYlJ. The 6-8, 
205-pounder gets about 31 minutes 

a game, during which time he 
averages 6.5 rebounds and 7.7 
points. 
"One of our concerns was 'How 
good are their guards?"' says the 
Irish coach. "But then (Chris) Nikic­
hevich shot well the other night ­
7-of-12 against Hawaii in a double 
overtime game." 
A 6-2 sophomore, Nikichevich 
usually chips in 7.0 points per game 

and, although he has only a .415 per­
centage from the field, shoots an 
awesome 90 percent from the free 
throw line. He is the best foul 
shooter on a team that shoots an im­
stripe. 

The other Cougar guard is 6-2 junior Scott Sinek. Sinek, interesting­ly enough, is from Servite High School in Fullerton, Calif., the same high school where Irish quarterback Steve Beuerlein starred in both foot­hall and basketball. 
For No~re Dame, tomorrow's game will, for the the first time in a long time, not be one that it "has" to win. NCAA Tournament hopes are all but gone now and the team is hoping to salvage something out of this injury-plagued season by getting a bid to the NIT. 
It should be a loose bunch ofguys that take the floor tomorrow in the 22,700 seat Marriott Center before a largely-Mormon crowd. The Irish players, those few who arc still able to play, no longer need to worry about winning every remaining game and, perhaps, the team will be better because of it. 
It will also he a somewhat­different Notre Dame team out on the court tomorrow, as the Irish, for the umpteenth time this season, are forced to use a new starting lineup. 
"It's like I've had about four dif­ferent teams this year," cracks Phelps on all the injuries that have hit his squad throughout the season. "This is like a December team all over again." 
Hopefully, though. Notre Dame doesn't play as poorly as it did in December when it meets the 15-7 Cougars. If the Irish dp, it could be one long afternoon. 

"We lived on the ocean while I was growing up," says Casey. "I figured that I might as well learn to !>Wim." I 
Casey has certainly learned how : to do that well. At the present time, ' she holds or shares I 2 varsity swim j records. Last season, Casey qualified ; for the NAIA Nationals, where she : took seventh in the I00-yard in-I dividual medley. In the process, she 1 was named to the NAIA All-i American team, besides being I honored as an academic all-1 American. 
This year's season has been tough- er for Casey, though. Last May she: had knee surgery and spent most of1 the summer in therapy sessions. 
"I expected to come back and pick up where I had left off last season," says Casey of her pre-· season expectations. "I wanted to swim as well as last year right from the start and that was tough." 
Once again this season, Casey has qualified for Nationals, which will be held March 1-3 in Arkansas. 
''I'm extremely psyched for Na­tionals this year," Casey says. "I'm in better shape and working harder. I'm shooting to get into the finals in . at least one event."

Final home meet 

Wrestlers take on two foes tonight 
ByJOE BRUNETTI 
Sports Writer 
Tonight, the Notre Dame wres­
tling team will conclude its regular 
season schedule with a tri-meet 
against Purdue and Marquette at the 
ACC Pit at 7:30p.m. 
The Irish are on a three-match 
losing streak, but they have just 
come off an excellent showing in 
last weekend's Wheaton Invitational 
Tournament, finishing fourth. 
They will need whatever momen­tum they now have, though, if they hope to give Big Ten opponent Purdue a tough time. So confident art· the Boilermakers that their coach, Bill Trujillo, has said, "We should have no trouble coming away with two victories." 
Confidence is good, but cockiness is not. If Purdue comes to Notre Dame overconfident, it is possible that there could be a major surprise. 
"I think they'll be overconfident," says Irish mentor Tihamer Toth­Fejel. "If tht·y think they're going to win, then we'll have a good chance." 
Purdue is a strong team that com­
petes in the powerful Big Ten. It is 
H-1 0 overall and 4-S in conference 
matches. 
That record may seem weak, but Purdue has competed against some tough opponents. Last week the Boikrmakers lost to · nationally­ranked Wisconsin, 36-9. They also have lost to Minnesota. One of their confert·nce wins came against In· 
diana hy the score of 29-16. The Irish also heat Ill, 23-11. 
After three straight losses, the Irish arc hungry for a win, and an up­set of Purdue would give the Irish excellent momentum for NCAA Regionals. But, once again, the Irish arc an injury-laden squad with hare­Iy enough bodies to fill all tht' spots. 
At ISH, Notre Dame is affected by injuries more than any other spot. Starter Louis Carncsale is out with a torn hicep. Senior Pat Jolin took his place at the Wheaton Tourney, hut he poppt.·d his collarhone and could not wrestle Tuesday against IIJinois State. Transfer student (ireg Swartz took Jolin's place at ISH, hut now Swartz is in the infirmary. The Irish may he forced to pull graduate stu­dent Doug Skinner out of his wres· tling retirement for this one meet. 
Skinner wrestled three years for Notre Dame and has one year of eligibility kft. 
"Skinner is a good wrestler," com­ments Toth-Fejel. "He has put in a lot of time, and he would have a good chance ofwinning both (matches)." 
Either way Toth-Fejel will find a body to 1111 the position at ISH pounds. 
In the I.34 and 190 classes, the Irish will be forced to wrestle a man who has moved up a weight class. Sophomore Eric Crown. a 126­pounder, will wrestk at I 34 he­cause starter Glenn Glogas is injurnl. Matt Stamm is out at 190, so freshman Dave Helmer will wrestle up from 177. 
At JIH ami 167, Notre Dame will wrestle two stalwarts, freshman· Greg Fleming and sophomore John Krug. Heming has performed wdl

Battered Irish travel to West to try to stop BYU's explosive offense

Devin Durrant is the man Notre Dame must stop tomorrow ifit is to hare any hope of beating Brigham Young in Prooo, Utah. Durrant was areraging 29.2 points per contest going into the C!ougars' game with San Diego St. last night. For more on tomor­row's match-up, see]effBlumb'spreviewat right.

PROVO, Utah -With relatively notl1ing to lose and a chance to gain somj:: new respect, nine survivors of the 1983-84 Notre Dame basketball season travel here tomorrow to meet the Cougars ofBrigham Young University ( 5 p.m. EST -USA Net­work). 
The Irish will have only nine players available to them in the game because of injuries to Tim Kempton and JoJo Buchanan, the academic ineligibility of two others, and the fact that walk-on Casey Newell will not make the trip. 
The most recent prognosis on Kempton is that he will not play anymore during the regular season because of his stress fracture, but could return for any post-season pia~ the Irish might take part in. Buc­hamin's status is similar to Kempton's. He is doubtful for tomorrow's game and it is likely that his nagging tendonitis will be rested for the duration of the regular sea.'ll.>n, leaving Joe Howard as the only Notre Dame point guard. 
The nine who do play tomorrow will have quite a task at hand. Besides having to stop an explosive BYU offense that averages over 80 points a game and ranks in the top ten in the country, Notre Dame will have its hands full trying to shut down the Cougars' Devin Durrant. 
Durrant, who has been the na­tion's leading scorer for much ofthis season, held a 29.4-point average going into BYlJ's game with San 

CSCHL title on line 
Hockey team faces crucial series 
By ED DOMANSKY 
Sports Writer 
HUNTSVILLE, Ala. -The Notre D;,me hockey team resumes Central States Collegiate Hockey League ac­tion tonight and tomorrow here in lhntsville. Boasting a 21-1-1 overall record and a 13-0-0 mark in league play, the Irish will receive by far their biggest challenge from a CSCH!.. opponent. 
Alabama comes into the weekend series 22-4 overall and 14-0-0 in CSCHLplay. 
In the CSCHI, the league cham­pion is determined on a percentage ba.o;is and all teams do not necessari­ly play the same number of games. With this bdng the last w<.·ekend of CSCII!.. action, it is crucial for Notre Dame to either sweep both games of the series or, at the very lea.o;t, come away with a win and a tic to win the rt·gular-season title. 
Huntsville is tht· lone Division II varsity team in the CSCIIL And, in an ironic twist, it is not coming to Notre Dame for the league playoffs the first wet·kend in Man:h. Instead, it is hosting five teams for its own tournament which is being billed a.o; the World Club Sport Hockey Cham­pionship. 
Alabama, outside the league, has beaten Air Force in three of four mt·etings this season. It ha.o; also had the same success against Penn State, the same team that the Irish earned a win and a tie with last weekend in Johnstown, Pa. Two ofits four losses came at the hands of Miami ofOhio, a member of the Central Collegiate Hockey As..'ll.>ciation, Notre Dame's old conference. 
"Huntsville doesn't carry the name like other hockey colleges be­
program, and the city has taken to it 
with great interest." 

To demonstrate its interest in just the Notre Dame series, Alabama called and asked permission to use the Notre Dame logo to sell T-shirts -several weeks ago. 
Ticket sales are also said to be going well, with crowds of four to six thousand expected for each night. 
"With both games in their arena, the atmosphere will inspire us to play well," says Dave Waldbillig. "It's almost like a North-South rivalry. And, with the two top teams in the league, it should make for interest­ing competition." 
The Chargers are a physical team with a good passing offense, so a solid performance from the Irish will be necessary in both games if they are to be successful. 
"This is our biggest series to date," says Greg Duncan. "At our team meeting the other day, we decided that we must really go out and work hard. Some teams haven't been as sharp, but now we must put every­thing aside and give it everything we've got." 
Notre Dame will be without the servkes of Steve Whitmore, who is suffering from a severe thigh contu­sion received in last Friday's game at Penn State. Bob Thebeau is having trouble with back spasms and sat out workouts on Tuesday and Wednes­day in order to rest for the weekend. 
With Whitmore out, Rick Ken­nedy will move up and play right wing on the third line with Waldbi1­lig and Tom Parent. 
On the Irish scoring chart, co­captain Brent Chapman remains on top with 24 goals and 34 assists. His linemate Adam Parsons is second who has scored seven goals and dished out seven assists in the last five games, also has 39 points. He has scored 1 5 goals and added 24 assists. 
Tim Lukenda will get the starting nod in the Notre Dame nets tonight at the Werner Van Braun Civic Arena. He is 5-0 in CSCHL play with a 
1.60 goals against average. Smith has yet to make a decision on his starter for Saturday. 
With Notre Dame hoping to leave Alabama with a league title, ·the Chargers could be in for their tough­est competition of the year in front oftheir home crowd. 
Diego St. last night. He has lead the Cougars in scoring in all but two of their games this year, after doing the same in all but three games last season. 
The BYU star was held to just 13 points last Sunday against George­town, something Phelps largely at­tributes to the Hoyas' excellent quickness. The Irish, however, ob­viously do not have that same quick­ness and will really have their work cut out for them. 
Still, Notre Dame has had excel­lent success in stopping the big guns ofother teams so far this season. Wit­ness the job they did on Washing­ton's Detlef Schrempf and Villanova's Ed Pinckney, as well as both Len Bias and Adrian Branch of Maryland. 
A starter in all of BYll's games since he was a freshman, Durrant took two years off after his sopho­more season in order to serve on a church mission in Spain -just as if the Cougars had red-shirted him for two years. A 6-7, 20 1-pound for­ward, Durrant wa.o; the unanimous choice a.o; the Western Athletic Con­ference's player-of-the-year la.o;t season. 
Aserious all-America candidate, Durrant also played for the llnited States in the World University Games la.o;t summer in Edmonton. As expected, he usually plays the entire game. 
"He's very tough to stop," says Irish coach Digger Phelps of Dur­rant, "because he draws the fouls very well, he works to get open, and he's not afraid to put it up anytime. 
"I don't think you can play one defense against Brigham Young. I think you have 10 keep mixing your defenses and, yet, he'll get his points. I mean, that's one thing about him, he's just a yery aggres.o;ive offensive player." 
"He can get shots through cracks in the floor sometimes," first year

Women look for third win in row at Detroit tomorrow 
The Notre Dame women's basketball team will try for its third straight victory tomorrow night as it travel-; to Detroit to tak<.· on the Lady Titans ofthe University ofDetroit. The Irish will also be looking for their second straight victory over the Titans. Ifthey are success­ful, it would mark their longest wining streak ofthe waning sca.'ion. 
On Tuesday, Mary DiStanislao and her players got a good look at what they can expect tomorrow at Calihan Hall when Dewayne Jones's team visited the ACC. The Irish won the game, 72-67, but the Titans showed that they could present some problems with their run-and-gun style of play. They forced Notre Dame to turn the ball over 17 times, keeping the Irish from running away for an ea.o;y win_ In front of its own crowd, which should number more than I000, Detroit will be even tougher. 
If the Irish are going to win, they must do another good job of defending Titan star freshman Cassandra Pack. Pack, who had been averaging more than 1 7 points a game, was held to just 13 points on 6-of-17 shooting Tuesday. 
At the same time, the Irish must do a better job controlling Regina Pierce, the Detroit guard who led all scorers in Tuesday's game with 23 points. However, DiStanislao would be happy to have her shoot as poorly (9-of-25) as she did in scoring her Points. Pierce is the key to Detroit, however, as she runs the sometimes-wild Titan offense and press. 
The only other Titans that made major impacts on Tuesday were forward Bridget Howard and center Lori Tennant. Howard pulled down eight rebounds and scored 14 points, while Tennant led Detroit with nine rebounds. 
Balanced scoring is what helped the Irish to victory Tuesday and will be necessary again tomorrow. Mary Beth Schueth, Carrie Bates, Lavetta Willis, and Ruth Kaiser all scored in double figures in the first Detroit game. Eight different players have scored in double figures in the last two games, so the Titans will have a hard time trying to focus on one or two players. That could be the edge for Notre Dame as it tries to lift its record to I 1-1 2.
