• Regional meeting focuses on ethical, legal issues around genetic research 
By HllARY BURN 

News Writer 

As scientists raced to sequence the human genome, they left a multitude of ethical and legal issues in their wake. At Notre Dame this weekend. health care professionals, edu• cators, lawyers. researchers, students and clergy wrestled with those issues and discussed how health care will be affected by medical genetics and the human genome. ­
The Second Annual North Central Indiana Consortium on "Clinical, Ethical and Legal Issues in Medical Genetics" included seven speakers and three panel discussions. Notable speakers were Dr. Charles Epstein, professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco, Dr. Neil Holtzman, professor of pedi­atrics, health policy and epi• demiology at Johns Hopkins University and Dr. Ellen Clayton, director of the Genetics and Health Law Policy Institute at Vanderbilt University.

Talking about a revolution 
. One expert warns not to hope for too much from genome findings 
By HILARY BURN 
News Wrirer 
Our expectations for the potential of genetic research should not be too high. said Dr. Neil Holtzman, a professor at Johns Hopkins, in a lecture Friday at the North Central Indiana Ethics Consortium at Notre Dame. 
"Genetics will advance knowl­edge, but its effect on health or reducing the burden of common complex diseases will not be ter­ribly great," Holtzman said. 
Even after last week's highly publized announcement that sci­entists have figured out the human genome sequence. they are still in the process of deci­phering it. Researchers estimate that there about 30,000 genes, but, in terms of function, only a couple thousand have been identified, according to Holtzman. 
As this genetic research has progressed, "revolutionary claims have been made [by both the media and the scientific community] about the ultimate impact of genetics on clinical medicine," he said

Montana, renowned architect, dies 
By LAURA SELLINGER 
News Writer 
Francesco "Frank" Montana, former professor and chair of the School of Architecture, died Friday, Feb. 16, at his home in Largo, Fla. He was 89 years old. 
Montana designed many build­ings on the Notre Dame campus. His works include McKenna Hall in 1965, the University Club in 1968, the original Hammes Bookstore in 1955, the Center for Social Concerns and the University Village in 1962. 
Montana, who was born in Naro, Italy. earned degrees of architecture from New York University and the Ecole des Beaux Arts in 1933 and 1939, 
respectively.  
Montana's colleagues  remem­ 
bered him well.  
"He was a very warm  and tal­ 

ented Italian gentleman who never lost his Sicilian charm," said Father Theodore Hesburgh, University president emeritus. "His passion for beauty showed not only in his architecture. but also in his paintings." 
"Frank was a genuine and hon­est man who lived architecture as a vocation. He took his talents and used them according to the will of God. He truly did architec­ture for the good of the people," said Father Richard Bullene, assistant professor of architec­ture. 
Montana also served on Notre Dame's architecture faculty from 1939·47 and acted as the archi• tecture chair from 1950-1972. 
"Frank was the most important figure in this program in the past 50 years. He was very devoted to his work and is the embodiment of the best of Notre Dame," said Carroll William Westfall. the cur­rent chair of Notre Dame's School of Architecture. 
Montana worked diligently to establish the school's renowned Rome Studies Program in 1969 and directed it from 1972•75 and from 1980-86, when he retired.

INSIDE COLUMN 
IM Fiasco 
I'm all about honesty lately, so rd like to share one of the most embarrassing moments of my col­lege career. One Saturday night last semester I attended my friends' party at Campus View. After mingling a while, I noticed a cute boy and asked a friend to introduce me. He obliged, names were exchanged, and I ended up talking and dancing withthe new boy for a while. By the end of the night, I had devel­oped a small crush on him. 
Saturday night ended. Sunday came and went. Monday morning classes passed as usual. 
I crune home and had a lit­tle time to waste before heading to lunch. I listened to my phone voice mails. No w1played messages. I 
. '

checked my e-mail. No new mail. I looked to see who was on Instant Messenger. No one to chat with. My friends and I have this wonderful way of adding new people to our Buddy Lists. You can use someone's e-mail address and find their AOL screen name. I thought back to Saturday night. And the party. And the boy. Did he have a screen name? 
I typed his name in the ND search engine and copied his email address into AOL's "Find A Buddy." A screen usually pops up asking you if you want to search for the person's screen name, and you simply click "Next." I clicked "Next." 
But then another screen popped up. I hit "Next" · again. And then, another screen. So I hit "Next" for a third time. "MAUREEN!!" ! shrieked at the top of my lungs. "OH NO!!" 
A new screen had popped up on my monitor: "Congratulations! You have just invited (My New Crush's Name) to join AOL Instant Messenger. AOL will notify you if they join the service." Apparently one time I clicked "Next" and agreed to to send my crush an invitation to join AOL instant messenger. 
Suddenly I received a new e-mail, too. It was a copy of the invitation that was sent to my crush. It read: "Laura C. Rompf has invited you to join AOL Instant Messenger, a great new way to keep in touch with family and friends. It's free, it's fast, it's easy. Join today!" 
Talk about traumatic! My new crush was about to receive an e-mail asking him to join this "new" service -a "new" service that everyone on cam­pus has know about for years! I had only met him once and two days later he was about to receive this psychotic e-mail! What was a girl to do? 
I could only think of one possible solution. 1­8111. "Hello, OIT." 
· "Um, yes, I have a problem. I need to you to delete an e-mail I just sent." I explained the whole situation to the OIT operator and begged him to delete the e-mail. He said he couldn't. He would be fired. "Fired?" I thought to myself. "Does it matter? I'm about to be embarrassed beyond beliefl" But he wouldn't budge. 
I hung up the phone. There was nothing l could do, the e-mail was there, just waiting to be read. I checked my e-mail later that night. No response. Days passed. Weeks passed. Nearly three months have passed. No response. I've seen the boy out a few times. I know exactly what he is thinking: "There's the psycho girl that sent me an invitation to join AOL." Six weeks after I sent the first invita­tion, I signed on to AOL and a screen popped up: "(My Old Crush's Name) has not joined AOL Instant Messenger yet. Would you like to send them another invitation?" Luckily, I didn't just push "Next." I learned my lesson and quickly clicked "No."

Student alleges sexual harrassment 
WASHINGTON 
The chairman of the Georgetown University chapter of College Republicans has accused a high-ranking official in the party's national college committee of sexual harassment and misuse of party funds. Jennifer Gorski and two other female employees of the Republican National Committee and the College Republican National Committee, one of whom is a recent Georgetown graduate, submitted their com­plaints in affidavits to the RNC earlier this year. According to the women's spokesman, Jason Zanetti, the RNC made a decision on the allegations Thursday, but it was unavailable at publication. In her affidavit, Gorski said that the CRNC official engaged in unpro­fessional behavior by regularly making unwanted sex­ual advances and sexual comments to her and other female employees. "On two or three separate occa­sions ... [the official] stated to me that. 'I can't hire a good-looking girl because I can't keep my hands off her,"' Gorski said. 
UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA 
Alcohol notice to be sent to parents 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. 

UF will send out its first ever parental notification letter this semester, telling one student's parents their child repeatedly violated the school's alcohol policy, said James Rollo, associate vice president of student affairs. UF's notification policy permits parents to be called if their child is taken to an emergency room for alcohol intoxica­tion or drug use. UF only sends a letter if a student vio­lates the alcohol policy twice in one semester or three times during the student's entire time at UF. Every other state university sends a letter if a student violates the school's alcohol policy twice in their time at the school. While the letter may be a first for UF, Rollo called 14 par­ents this Fall because their children were transported to an emergency room due to drug use or intoxication, he said. In comparison, Florida State University contacted 40 parents, according to an article in the Tallahassee Democrat. But FSU's policy requires notifying the parents ofstudents who violate the school's alcohol policy and stu­dents who are transported to an emergency room.

UNITED KINGDOM 
Foot-and-mouth cases on the rise 
Associated Press 

LONDON 
British agricultural 
authorities on Sunday con­
firmed new cases of foot­
and-mouth disease at a cat­
tle and sheep farm in 
southwest England. 

Meanwhile, officials were 
setting about the grim task 
of burning the carcasses of 
hundreds of animals 
slaughtered in an effort to 
contain the highly infec­
tious livestock ailment. 
Huge pyres fueled with rail 
ties and diesel were built in 
preparation for the first 
mass incinerations Sunday. 
Britain has been scram­
bling since Feb. 19 to con­
tain the outbreak of foot­
and-mouth disease, its first 
in two decades. Exports of 
meat, milk and live animals 
have been banned, and 
inspectors have been quar­
antining farms and slaugh­
terhouses suspected of har­
boring the disease. 

The latest confirmed cases, reported by the agri­culture ministry, were found in Devon, at a sheep and cattle farm that is part of a 14-farm chain. The 13 other farms are now being inspected as well. 
Authorities also con­firmed that prior to last week's export ban, sheep from the Devon farm had been sent to buyers in Europe. Agriculture Minister Nick Brown acknowledged there was thus a risk that infected sheep could have been exported before the out­break was discovered. 
Veterinary officials can­not say precisely when the outbreak began, but some have speculated the disease could have been present for as long as three weeks before being discovered.

Mazarr: Find a human side to organizations 
By KIMBERLY SPRINGER News Writer· 
"Most organizations aren't human, what are you going to do about it?" asked Michael Mazarr, president of an international security think tank in Washington, in his dis­cussion of sociology and psy­chology of people in the elec­
tronic work­place on Friday. 
Mazarr. president of the Henry R. Stimson Center, said that the high performance management technique is the answer to this chal­lenge. 
"[It is] a style that is aimed at creating an organization in which employees consider themselves owners of the organization," he said. 
He also noted we are in a transitional era of manage­ment in the business world. 
"We are of a generation that will be managing in this tran­sition," Mazarr said.

California outages foretell Western summer energy crunch 
Associated Press 
As Californians brace for a summer of anticipated power shortages and the possibility of rolling blackouts, experts are warning their neighbors in states across the West to be ready for the pos­sibility of having to share the pain. 
Natural gas supplies are tight,  reser­ 
voirs  are low and a  heat wave  could  
drive up demand for electricity.  

"It could get bad all over the West this summer," said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor who specializes in energy markets at Washington University in St. Louis. 
a double challenge this year. 

The Bonneville Power Authority has been forced to draw down its reservoirs to spin generators in recent months under a federal order requiring energy suppliers to sell to California. The order has been lifted, but reservoir levels are perilously low. 
That wouldn't be such a concern in a year of normal rain and snowfall, but the snowpack in the Cascade Range this year is only 60 percent of normal. Less runoff means less water refilling reser­voirs to power turbines.

The power alerts were lifted last week, thanks to the availability of more imported electricity and the return to service of power plants that had been down for repairs. 
But energy experts predict the state will run short again, particularly when air conditioners crank up in the hottest months. 
All the Western states share a power transmission grid, but the area most likely to face problems similar to California's is the Northwest. 
Washington, Oregon, Idaho and west­ern Montana depend heavily on hydro­electric power, an energy source facing will be avoiding black­
outs here, but we won't have any power to spare." 
And because the other states in the West are linked through their common power grid, there is the potential that problems also could affect Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah and Arizona. 
If California's situation is severe enough. it could suck electricity from the rest of the grid and set up a ripple effect in other states' utility systems. 
"It's a scary thought, but the electrici­ty is tied together like a bunch of high• tension rubber bands," said Kellan Fluckiger, chief operating officer for California's Independent System Operator, which manages 75 percent of the state's transmission system. "If you 
Predicting a power problem in the West 
Analysts, regulators and power suppliers are warning of possible power disruptions across the West this summer, with some states more vulnerable than others. California is considered the most likely western state to face blackouts this summer. The state gets about 24 percent of its power from its own hydroelectric dams, which could generate less power this summer because of lighter runoff. The Sierra snowpack stands at 70 percent of normal. Here is the outlook this summer for other selected states.

"A limited blackout could become fair­1y widespread," said Dick Watson. director of the power division of the Northwest Power Planning Council, a policy advisory board. 
California's peak demand for power is expected to exceed supplies from May through September, according to the Independent System Operator. The pro­jected deficit will range from 3,030 megawatts in May to as high as 6,815 megawatts in June. It takes about 1,000 megawatts to power 1 million homes.

Legislators have been working on bills intended to result in more power plants in the state, and fears that natural gas · supplies in Northern California would be depleted by the end of February eased when more suppliers agreed to deliver gas to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
Still. the state's goals will be tough to meet by summer, however, said Judah Rose, managing director of ICF Consulting, a Washington, D.C., firm specializing in energy-issues.

QUOTE OF THE DAY 
"/ believe in the fundamental Truth ofall the great religions ofthe world. I believe that they are all God given ... I came to that con­clusion long ago ... that all religions were true. and also that all had some error in them." 
Mahatma Gandhi activist 
"Life is like a box of chocolates." Well maybe, sort of, I guess, except that you can poke the bottom of the chocolates and see what is in the center and you cannot normally do that with life. I usu-, ally look for the 
raspberry or Anna Barbour 
coconut centers myself; I have a technique so that unless you check, Get A Life you cannot tell if a piece has been tampered with. You cannot tamper with life like I do with chocolate; you can't get something for nothing in the game of life; you rarely, as they say, have your cake and eat it too -in life, you pay the piper and reap what you sow. 
Well, speaking of life, Lent is upon us once again. Lent and life, they both start with "L;" it works; bear with me. Who is not excited about Lent? Let me tell you who is not excited. You are not excited. And why are you not excited about the season of the liturgical year that marks the passing of the catechumen to rebirth in the life of Christ, the special season that was intended to initiate baptismal candidates, purifying them for the joyous Easter period? You are not excited because you watch too much television. 
Oh, the theory that has television at the root of Lenten inattention {and other compounded evils) is certainly a wild• type hypothesis at this point. People can be disenchanted about Lent for a variety of reasons. One reason being the mod­ern superpower's complete lack of understanding for what it means to go without stuff. When a family owns an SUV for each parent and an F-150 truck for one of its two children, Lent is not going to be very exciting for it. When a group of friends goes to, say, Reckers and assumes it need not throw away its trash (perhaps because it assumes peo­ple who are not receiving tips enjoy cleaning up after stupid students), the magic of Lent must be lost on this group. And you have got to love those people who let fall willy-nilly beer cans as soon as all the liquid is swallowed down (because, I guess, nature makes a good trash can), those people really do not have much interest in Lent or Lenten practices. 
Lent is exciting for only certain people. At this point, I should like to state that Lenten observance is still very much an obligation for Christians, that the views henceforth stated are my own, that if you consider your religion seriously it behooves you to look into Lent. 
Lent is the time to review your life thus far, to make some payments on that tab you've been running up at the big bar of life. Times, they are a changing though; Lent is becoming very vague. Who knows why we do what we do? How do we practice Lent now? Why do we not eat meat? The ordinary rule on fasting days, beginning in the second century, was to take but one meal a day and that only in the evening, while meat and, in the early centuries, wine were entirely forbidden. Yes, wine. 
Now, what do we do? Give up eating mainly cows, pork and chicken on Friday and if truly dedicated, give up something everyday that is a bad habit (but not too bad because then it gets rough); we do this between a most excit­ing and festive Mardi Gras'Carnaval atmosphere and the celebration of Easter. 
Mardi Gras is a fun time especially if you live in New Orleans or some place that knows how to do Carnaval right. At that mystical, magical time and you're suppose to lose your inhibitions, you 're suppose to become like the Hyde of Jekyll and Hyde. 
Why in the name of the holiest of holies would any God-fearing religion allow such unseemliness to occur? Well, first off, it's not every religion that does a Carnaval like Catholicism, at least in my unbiased Catholic perspective that is. And the Church has repeatedly attempt­ed to curb the excesses of the week before Lent, but like any Yin, there has to be a Yang. Hence, if you are going to celebrate Carnaval to its fullest (O'Neill Family Hall), then it is only fair to observe and celebrate Lent to its fullest. 
Mardi Gras must be regarded as the clearing away of base tendencies so that one can prepare for change. The Lenten season then signifies that preparing peri­od. Lent has its origins in the Gospel accounts of Christ's 40 day temptation in the wilderness but has also been subject to much change especially as to its length and fasting regulations. Lent has always been considered a time of preparation for baptism, for the reconciliation of pen­itents and a season of recollection, invit­ing all people back to their baptismal foundation in Christ. A conception of the essence of this preparation period is that Lent is to be when you give up what you think you need. putting your trust in· something greater than you. 
The less you have, the more free you are, you know. True freedom exisl'i in the ability to live without the necessary. If I did not need to sleep, imagine how much I could get done or if I did not need air, imagine where I could go. If the abandonment of a big necessary can pro­vide so much freedom. imagine what even abandonment of smaller neces­saries can do. I gave up chocolate one year; it was hard, but not too hard since I ate all manner of vanilla based items. I have a feeling a missed the point that year. 
It is quite painful actually to give up something you have come to feel as nec­essary. which is possibly why Lent is los­ing its vigor. Who wanl'> to do anything painful? While it is quite possible to give up food for days, weeks, even months. it is quite painful to give up food for 24 hours. While it is difficult to go without, how often can you say you experience real joy with food especially if you com• plain about the dining hall? But if you can be free of something like the necessi­ty of food, imagine it. My god, you won't have tasted a dining hall burger so scrumptious in your life as one eaten right after Lent is over.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
A defense of Knight's of Columbus statue 

the Roe v. Wade decision. We chose the Blessed Mother's image for this statue specifically in her role as mother: illustrative of the holy vocation of each and every woman who conceives to bring the life entrusted to her into the world. We also chose her because of the peculiar circumstances of her own pregnancy. She chose to carry Jesus to term in the face of a soci­ety that would at the least publicly disgrace her and at worst stone her to death for doing so. If the experi­ence of those modern women who 
Statue recognizes all affected by abortion 
I was first upset and then saddened by Jocelyn Szczepaniak­Gillece's letter to The Observer on Feb. 22. It betrayed a misunder­standing that is all too common today, especially at Notre Dame. The feeling that for a person or institution to take a position is nec­essarily to condemn all others or to betray a sense of "free think­ing" and intellectual honesty. This reasoning would disallow Notre Dame. a Catholic school, from taking a moral stand on anything. It would not only condemn the University's stand on abortion, but on every other pertinent social issue, such as sweatshops. Yet this is not the heart of the issue. 
A statue that remembers the victims of abortion is not a condem­
nation of women. Neither is it insensitive and "deliberate manipu­
lation." Instead, it is a symbol of the Catholic convictions underly­
ing both Notre Dame and the Knights of Columbus that calls out for 
us to bear witness to what is taking place. 
I believe that both pro-lifers and pro-choicers can agree that abortion is not a social good; this is reflected in the statement by many pro-choicers that they want abortion to be "safe, legal. and rare." I know many times, I have been criticized by pro-choice friends for characterizing their position as "pro-abortion." They may be right. In both of these instances though, it is clear that many people feel that there is something wrong taking place in abortions. It may sometimes be justifiable, it may some times be considered necessary and it even may be a constitutional right guaranteed to women. The fact remains that no one promotes abortion, they simply disagree over its legality in a civilized nation. 
This statue and the shared awareness of pro-choicers and pro­lifers should be the beginning of a new common ground. The stat­ue that the Knights of Columbus donated is not a judgment, but a memorial. I agree with the previous letter that women do not take abortion lightly. I believe that it is a serious and difficult choice. It is for this reason that I feel the statue is appropriate in remember­ing "the victims of abortion" -both the unborn who have died and hopefully the women who felt forced by society and circumstance to make that choice.

"Think I ·give a damn about a Grammy?" 
It was an awfully strange sight last Wednesday night at the Grammy Awards. Controversial rapper Eminem was hold­ing the hand of music legend Elton John, while his other hand was offering an extended middle fin­
ger to the crowd giv-Mike Marchand ing him a standing ovation. The Gay & Lesbian 
Questionable

Alliance Against 
Freedoms

Defamation {GLAAD) was extremely criti­2000 cal of Elton John, who is openly gay, for sharing the stage with Eminem, whose last album "contains the most blatantly offensive, homophobic lyrics Gl.AAD has ever seen," according to Executive Director Joan M. Garry. 
But except for occasional derisions of people Em doesn't like as "faggots," the real hateful lyrics don't come until the very last track, "Criminal": "My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge, that'll stab you in the head, whether you 're a fag or lez. or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-ves, pants or dress -hate fags? The answer's yes." In the 17 songs before that verse, Eminem states multiple times that he doesn't personally believe in the hateful mindset his lyrics espouse. In fact, he does it once just before the "Hate fags?" verse in "Criminal." 
The real Marshall Mathers, so to speak, comes through in some of the less angry songs. Seeing past the explicit lyrics. Eminem does have some poignant social commentary. For example, "ifwe can hump dead animals and antelopes, then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope." Enlightened thinking for someone who supposedly "hates fags," even though it's presented in a demented sort of way. 
Eminem constantly questions the con­sistency of people who criticize snippets of his lyrics by asking why he is the tar­get. He points to sex on televi­sion, violence in movies/ and the lack of parental influence 
as other problems~·

but he sees the  f  
finger of blame  •  
immediately  •  ...~  
pointed at him after things like  ~Cf-V  #  
school shootings.  

(He also reserves spe­
cial attention to a cer­

tain now-citizen: "You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his d--k sucked? F--k that!") 
But of course. it's wrong to portray Eminem just as some Jonathan Swift for the new millennium, satirizing the world by making himself look like a hopeless misanthrope. There are some truly sick­ening and offensive words and themes in his lyrics. In The Marshall Mathers LP, Eminem raps about raping his mother (who sued him for defamation after Em said she "does more dope than I do") and murdering his wife (who has now sued him as well). For good measure, he also 
talks about impregnating Jennifer Lopez 
and acts out a skit where rival Detroit 
rappers Insane Clown Posse perform oral 
sex on him. 

His most despicable lyrics come on the song "I'm Back," where he raps about shooting bullies at Columbine. The result­ing outrage forced him to delete the words "kids" and "Columbine" from all 
future copies of the album, even 
the unedited ones. 
But, truly sociopathic 
lyrics aside, Eminem is 
simply following a 
trend set by Marilyn 
Manson, Ozzy 
Osbourne, Howard 
Stern, Andrew Dice 
Clay, George Carlin, 
all the way back to 
Allen "America, go f--k 
yourself with your atom 
bomb" Ginsberg. The lesson is 
that shock sells. And the more people shocked, the more you will sell. The Marshall Mathers LP has sold over 8 mil­lion units. 
So, when Gl.AAD announced its part­nership with other groups like the National Organization for Women; the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network; Parents. Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays; The Matthew Shepard Foundation; the National Sexual Violence Resource Center and others to protest Eminem's stage appearance, the performance quickly became the hottest topic surrounding the Awards. 
Eminem's lyrics, although shocking, should come a sµrprise to no one. In a genre cluttered with songs devoted to such intellectually stimulating topics as "bitches," "ho's," "ni---s" and "nines," Eminem's rants were the next logical evo­lution, especially given the fact that he wanted to be taken serious]y as a white rapper and not automatically lumped in with farces like Vanilla Ice. What better way to get noticed than controversy? (Em's first album, Infinite, has the stan­dard rap obscenities, but none of the truly psychotic stuff.) He himself recognizes the secret to his success: "Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records .. . Well, I do, so f--k him and f--k you too.... 
So, in the end, what should we make of Marshall Mathers, who raps under the moniker Eminem and concocts graphic fantasies under a further alter ego called Slim Shady? In "Stan," the song he per­formed at the Grammys, Eminem takes us into the mind of a crazed fan and gives voice to those sensations civilized people never see. But is Stan the insane one or is it Eminem? Can we ever know the differ­ence? 
Perhaps that's the scariest thing.

I was riding on the late bus back to my house one evening in Toledo, Spain and the bus driver struck up a conversation with me and asked me where I was from. 
"America," I said, eager to practice my developing Spanish skills with a native. 
Oh, he knew about America, he told me, with subtle pride. 
He knew the latest news about the elections (this was November, and the endless election headache had only just begun). He really liked American music. He wasn't sure if he preferred New York or Los Angeles, but he was leaning toward New York. . 

'Tm from Chicago," I said. He knew Chicago -Michael Jordan and the famous lake. 
One day, he confided, he hoped to move to America. He didn't want to hurt my feelings, but he didn't think he would move to Chicago. He wanted to be near an ocean. Imagine working in New York City! His eyes gleamed with the imag­ined glamour of his new American life. 
"Do you speak English?" I asked. 
Well, only a little. But he could learn, he assured me. English was the most important lan­guage to know, but it was difficult. So many con­fusing rules! Spanish was much easier. 
We were close pals by now. I knew of his dreams and aspirations and I hadn't laughed at him; he chose to ignore my prominent American accent. We had accepted each other and the con­versation was flowing smoothly. And then, as we bounced along the old streets, he ruined it all. 
He turned to me with earnest eyes. "What," he asked, "do Americans know about Spain?" 
I hesitated. He had made his offer, showed me what he knew. and now he waited for me to return the favor. I had to look away from his expectant face. 
"Nada," I said. I stared out the window. It was true. Most Americans don't really know much about his country. 
"Well, don't they want to come here and visit? Surely they must know what a beautiful place Spain is." 
I didn't have the language skills to translate my emotions. I didn't know how to tell him that for many Americans, Europe meant Paris and London and Rome -and Spain wasn't usually the first stop on that proverbial backpacking trip. 

Of course, some Americans travel to Spain. But few could boast a knowledge of Spain as extensive as this humble bus driver's was about my coun­try. To know that much requires an effort that most of us aren't willing to put forth. 
To some Americans. the word "Spanish" con­jures up the stereotypical images of flamenco, siestas and bullfights -and those are the ones who at least have an idea. And then there are the ones who think Spanish food consists of spicy tacos, or who struggle to name even two major Spanish cities. It's not their fault; they're just citi­zens of the bubble that is the United States of America. Spain is far from the sole victim of our mostly oblivious nation -we know very little about a lot of countries -but living there for a semester helped me to see the reality of the situa­tion from a Spaniard's perspective. And talking with that bus driver forced the truth on me in a way that no anti-American rant ever could. 
That's exactly what strikes at the heart of the difference between an American and a Spaniard. An American can live a full and happy life and not give Spain a second thought. It's there if he wants to visit but he doesn't need to worry about it. A Spaniard doesn't have that luxury; he is acutely aware of American culture, whether he likes it or not. Our president's decisions can impact this Spaniard. If Britney Spears releases a new CD, his daughter is going to want a copy. And there's a McDonald's in every town. 
The bus driver asked me again. "Don't they know what Spain has to offer?" 
"The lucky ones know," I thought. Aloud, I said, "Most of them don't, but hopefully they'll learn more someday." Even as I said them, I realized how awkward and useless my words sounded. 
The truth will set you free, people say. Maybe for some of us. But when I realized such an unset­tling truth about my country, I wondered if that saying is accurate. I felt less free than ever when I realized how self-centered my American views had rendered me; if anything, I felt like a captive. I saw the expression on that bus driver's face when I told him that the majority of Americans gave little thought or concern to his homeland, and my stomach turned with the resulting empty air as I attempted to make amends for my coun­try. The remainder of our conversation was strained, and I left the bus quickly. 
I don't think I wanted to know that truth about the place where I lived, and I knew I would never look at America with quite the same rosy opti­mism.

Mirror, mirro 
The Counseling Center's 
By C. SPENCER BEGGS 
Staff Writer 

Can you spot the eating disorder? 
Tim is your average freshman. He is 
involved in a few clubs and likes to play bas­
ketball with his hallmates during the week­
end. Tim also lifts weights regularly. Lately, 
Tim has been using creatine, a bodybuilding 
supplement, to increase his performance 
and help him bulk up. He regiments himself 
to an extremely low carbohydrate diet and 
eats almost twice the amount of protein than 
before he began his diet. Tim's workout 
regime has been taking up more of his time. 
He often finds himself working out instead 
of going to social activities. 
Molly prefers to eat alone and often eats 
late at night. Although she does not exercise 
regularly, she meticulously counts the num­
ber of calories in her food and tries to limit 
her caloric intake to 8 5 percent of the rec­
ommended daily value for her height and 
body weight. To help regulate her hunger 
she takes appetite-suppressing pills. 
Occasionally, if Molly feels she has eaten too 
much she will make herself vomit. 
Laura weighs herself on a scale everyday. 
She feels that her body is not acceptable to 
others. When she eats in mixed company, 
she picks at her food and generally eats only 
a salad or a piece of fruit. Laura is ashamed 
of how she looks when she eats. She quickly 
lost eight pounds since the beginning of the 
semester. 

So, which scenario -Tim, Molly or Laura 
-represents an eating disorder? Trick 
question. In fact, none of these situations 
accurately represents an eating disorder. All 
of them show signs of high-risk eating 
behaviors; however, the classification of an 
eating disorder is a little more complicated. 
Dr. Rita Donley Ph.D., the assistant direc­
tor of the University Counseling Center, sees 
this as a growing problem for Notre Dame 
and other campuses around the country. 
Last year, she and other colleagues conduct­
ed a study on eating practices at Notre 
Dame. 

"One of the things we've proven with the 
2000 [eating disorder] study is that there are more [Notre Dame students] engaging in high-risk eating," says Donley, a specialist in eating disorders and body image. According to Donley's results, Notre Dame has slightly elevated levels of diagnosable and symptomatic eating disorders. The study, which took a sample of 1,484 Notre Dame students -approximately 21 percent of the student body -was compared to a ·similar study conducted in 1988. It should be noted, however, that the more recent study was done on a volunteer survey basis, which may skew the results with a pre­selection factor. In other words, people may have chosen whether to respond because of 
the questionnaire's subject matter. 
Why do eating disorders occur? Like many 
psychological and medical problems there is 
no one cause. "I don't think anyone wakes 
up one day and says, 'Gee, I want an eating 
disorder,"' Donley remarks. "It's a progres­
sive chain of events." 
Nutritionists and psychologists have gen­
erally viewed eating disorders in two ways: 
as an addiction and as a behavior. Donley, 
however, sees eating disorders as a combi­
nation of the two, but moreover. she sees 
them as a control issue. 
"If you look at people with eating disor­
ders you'll see that they feel out of control in 
their lives, and eating is a way for them to 
try to take control of something." 
Unfortunately, it is a vicious cycle and even­
tually people with eating disorders define 
themselves in terms of eating habits. 
"People with eating disorders want to defy 
[their body images] but we 're finding out 
more and more that for whatever reason.

genetically or physically, we just can't 
do that." 
Who develops an eating disorder? 
One stereotype is that intelligent and 
successful people, such as the aver­
age Notre Dame student, would not 
engage in this type of destructive 
behavior. "It has nothing to do with 
being smart. In fact, we see a lot of 
highly intelligent people with these 
disorders," Donley replies. 
"Getting help is the key issue here. 
It's very rare that someone comes in 
[to the Counseling Center] on their 
own and says, 'Look, I've got a prob­
lem.' More often it is an RA, coach, 
friend or family member," Donley 
adds. 
The hardest thing about helping 
those with eating disorders is know­
ing when to actively seek outside 
assistance and when to limit one's 
involvement. A person may engage in 
high-risk behaviors for long periods 
of time and may even have a serious 
eating disorder but not be ready to 
accept help. 
The most important step in recov­
ery. according to psychologists, is the 
person's acknowledgement that he or 
she has a problem. Donley agrees, 
pointing out that "forcing someone to 
get help hardly ever works." 
Donley recommends confronting the 
person in a caring way about the per­
ceived problem, a technique called 
intervention. Generally, the response 
is either denial or anger. At that 
point, most experts recommend back­
ing away. 
"An intervention is a social awaken­ing because so often people with eat­ing disorders think that what they're doing is a secret," Donley adds. By bringing the issue to the surface, you plant the seeds of doubt that, when .,eombined with failing under physical and mental pressures, will eventually lead to an acknowledgement of the 
situation and acceptance of help.

The first thing a person should do if he or she is concerned about a stu­dent's eating habits is consult the Counseling Center. located on the third floor of the Health Services building behind the Dome. Often times, counselors will advise and even role-play a confrontation with con­cerned parties, namely friends and relatives. The Counseling Center has found this to be a very effective approach; it is much more personal than a confrontation with a strange authority. 
"Awareness is the first step," says Donley. Once you let somebody know that you are aware of his or her prob­lem. he or she must constantly justify the "mental gymnastics" that accom­pany eating disorders. After the initial confrontation, it is up to the person with the eating disorder to actively seek help. 
This week is National Body Image Awareness Week. The University Counseling Center is co-sponsoring a 
series of events including: a Body Image Awareness Fair in LaFortune Student Center Monday, Feb. 26 from 9 a,m. to 3 p.m., a presentation on talking to friends about eating disor­ders in the Montgomery Theater, Feb. 28 starting at 5:30 p.m. and a talk by Judy Molnar, Rosie O'Donnell's fitness guru and founder of the "Chub Club," in 155 DeBartolo, March 1 starting at 7 p.m. For a full schedule of events and information of individual and group counseling visit the Counseling Center's Web site at www.nd.edu/-ucc.

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 
No. 2 North Carolina falls prey to Virginia 

Associated Press 
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Virg. 

Tent cities filled with stu­dents desperate for a ticket. A sea of orange shirts at every game. Players that feed off of the fans, and noise that makes it hard to concentrate. 
This is what Virginia basket­ball has become for coach Pete Gillen and the No. 9 Cavaliers this season, and No. 2 North Carolina became the latest to experience it in an 86-66 loss at University Hall on Sunday. 
"They were quicker today, they jumped higher today and they shot the ball better today." Tar Heels coach Matt Doherty said of the Cavaliers, who improved to 13-1 at home with victories against Duke and Maryland. 
"When we play, we can play with anybody in the country,,. Gillen said. "We just want to try to be as close to what we did today as many times as we can. That's what the great teams do." 
Virginia jumped the Tar Heels in the first half with a 22­6 run that turned a 31-29 deficit into a 51-37 lead and had another sellout crowd, some of whom had camped out eight days for tickets, simply delirious. 
The second half proved more of the same as a 10-4 burst pushed the Virginia lead to 76­56 with 9:47 left and seemed to end the suspense. 
"What we wanted to do in the second half was keep that lead, pressure them and make them try to come to us," Virginia's Roger Mason said. 
Virginia held on despite a scoring drought that lasted 5:47, allowing North Carolina to get within 76-66 with 4:55 left. But that basket, a layup by Joseph Forte, proved the last points the Tar Heels scored. 
Forte scored 28 points, but made only four of his last 19 shots after starting out 7-for-8, and Brendan Haywood added 20 points. Haywood finished 9­for-12 from the field: the rest of the team was 19-for-52. 
The Tar Heels also suffered from the absence of point guard Ronald Curry for all but eight minutes of the first half, when he drew three fouls, and from three that put Haywood on the bench in the second half. 
The victory was Virginia's fourth against a team ranked in the top 10 at the time, and came only 11 days after anoth­er one, a 91-89 last-second tri­umph against then-No. 2 Duke that ended the same way this one did. 
As the final horn sounded, students from both sides stormed the court, and Gillen and some players addressed them on the microphone. 
"They were berserk," said Gillen, who joked that he'd spent half his budget in the past two weeks buying food for the tent city occupants. 
The Cavaliers (19-6, 8-6 ACC} were paced by Mason with 18 points. Donald Hand with 17 and Travis Watson with 14 and 10 rebounds. Adam Hall and Chris Williams each added 13, and all but Watson hit a 3­pointer. 
Since heading into ACC play at 10-0, then struggling. Virginia has come a long way since losing 73-68 at home to Georgia Tech on Jan. 9. 
"Everybody knows what type of role they have now." Watson said. "Everybody can score and everybody feels comfortable with everybody." 
The Tar Heels, meanwhile, left with a disappointed coach. 
"You've got to bring it every night, and today we didn't. That's the most disappointing thing," Doherty said. "It hurts to admit that." 
Razorbacks 79, Wildcats 72 
Leading No. 13 Kentucky by four points, the Razorbacks twice worked the shot clock before Brandon Dean missed badly. 
On the next possession, Arkansas was in no danger on the shot clock when Jannero Pargo fired from the top of the key. 
"I was yelling, 'Don't shoot!'" said Arkansas coach Nolan Richardson. "I didn't want it. Then I yelled. 'Good shot.' That one there was the dagger."

team in the 1980s to a perenni­al national top-10 team by the middle of the 1990s. But even when the Irish became one of , the country's best squads, they were still virtually unknown to most of the local community. 
Check out the numbers: in 1995-96, 96-97 and 97-98: an average of less than 2,000 fans attended the Irish home games. In the past three seasons, they have averaged crowds of 2,996, 3,567 and 5,960 fans per game. 
Judging from personal expe­rience, it's pretty clear that the students' appreciation for a sport other than football and men's basketball has not changed much. More students would rather attend daily mass than go to women's basketball games. 
But the townies have embraced the nation's No. 2 team. Scan the crowd and the vast majority are under 15 or older than 40. Parents and chil­dren. Older couples. Families. 
Some are probably fair­weather (who ever came up with that term?) fans. Yet if the majority only cared about records, why didn't they flock to 
games for five straight seasons? 
Credit the more talented play­

ers, the increase in marketing and advertising, the growing acceptance of women's athlet­. ics in a male-dominated sports culture and the current Irish 
36-game home winning streak 
for attracting the larger 
crowds. 
There's another reason, how­

ever, for the increased ticket 
sales: the bond between the 
current players and South Bend 
teenage girls. 
After every game, the girls 

greet the Irish players as if they 
were the Backstreet Boys. They 
line up outside the locker room, 
notepads and pens in hand, 
awaiting the autographs of 
their idols. And for nearly an 
hour, the players sign, chat and 
laugh with the young girls. 
Maybe it's because they real­

ize that they are role models for 
these kids. Maybe it's because 
they never really had female 
athletic role models when they 
grew up, before the WNBA and 
the growth of women's college 
basketball. Or maybe it's just 
because they understand the 
importance of giving back to seem to enjoy the post-game even more than the game itself. Where else can you pay less than it costs to go the movies and interact with arguably the best player, best shooter and best point guard in the country, not to mention the nine other players who all treat you like a little sister? 
No other senior class has ever attained the on-court success of this crew. They have won 100 games in four years, have par• ticipated in three NCAA tourna­ments, and took part in the finest regular season victory in the program's brief history. the win over Connecticut. 
But forget the W's. 

Look at the attendance fig­ures. Glance at the smiles on the girls' faces when one of the players signs their notebook. Notice the tears in the fans' eyes when these seniors walk off the Joyce Center floor for the last time in the middle of March, either after advancing to the Sweet Sixteen or after their dream season ends with a stunning loss. 
Therein lies this group's most significant achievements.

Contestants with byes look to get in on the action 
Boxers duke it out between the ropes 
KEVIN BERCHOU 
Sports Writer 
It may all be for a good cause, but the boxers that will duke it out in the quar­terfinals of the 71st annual Bengal Bouts tonight will harbor cruel intentions once they step between the ropes. 
Friends outside the ring are arch enemies once inside with a title the moti­vation to fight. One fighter will taste the sweets of vic­tory, while his opponent will taste nothing but the leather of his gloves. 
165 lbs. 
Senior co-captain and top seed Brian Hobbins begins his search for that elusive Bengal Bouts crown tonight. after receiv­ing a first round bye, as he battles Morrissey Manor freshman Patrick Dillon. Hobbins, a returning final­ist. brings a wealth of experience to the bout, but is careful not to be over­confident against first-year boxer Dillon. 
"Sure, my experience helps," Hobbins said. "But boxing can come down to one punch, so I don't want to underestimate him." 
Dillon is not one that should be taken lightly. He was most impres­sive in securing a unanimous deci­sion in the preliminaries, using his reach to the best of his advantage. 
"I was really impressed with him [Dillon]," Hobbins said. "He really came out and got after him. I'm not going to look ahead. I just want to come out tonight and do my best." 
Though Hobbins' 2_001 debut is perhaps the weight class's most anticipated, its best fight could very well be between sophomore Clay Cosse and Thomas Macias. With nei­ther brawler likely to give up easily, this one is likely to go the distance. 
Cosse, who scored a unanimous decision in round one, counts his toughness as his strongest suit. 
"He has a head like a coconut," Hobbins said. "He never gives up." Macias, however. promises to work just as hard. 
"Tom just keeps going," Hobbins said. "I think this bout is going to be like two rams butting heads." 
In a clash of opposites, Christopher Kitalong will go toe to toe with Billy McMurtrie, a third year law student. While McMurtrie will try to throw the book at Kitalong with his superi­or height and reach, Kitalong will try to get along with a contrasting inside style that could will give his taller opponent problems. 
It's McMurtrie's last chance to lay down the law and win a title, and Hobbins thinks that might work in the law student's favor. 
"It's his last shot, so it should be no holds barred," Hobbins said. 

For McMurtrie, the whole premise is familiar. His task will, as always, be to impress the judges. 
In other 165-pounder action, Justin Myers will slug it out with Brian Berg. 
Berg, a freshman, made it to the quarterfinals with a split decision on Stephen Owens, while Justin "The ResLife Regular" Myers defeated Tim "Maximus Mccurdy. 
175 lbs. 

Rob Joyce knows exactly what he wants. He's been the best, and now he wants to fight the best, so he can be the best again. 
Got all that? In perhaps the most competitive weight class, Joyce, the top-seed and defending champion, would like nothing more than to take on junior captain Mark Criniti, the defending champion in the 185-lb. division, in a title match. The fact that Criniti shed a few pounds makes such a duel possible, and such a rare clash of defending kings could be the Bouts' most enticing. 
But Joyce's path to the title and the potential glory that lies therein is by no means paved with gold. Rather, Joyce will have his hands full tonight with the likes of sopho­more Matt Padilla, his neighbor from Seigfried Hall. 
"We're in the same section," Joyce 
said. "So there's always a bigger 
incentive to win there." 

Though Joyce is the top seed and a 
clear favorite, he thinks Padilla will 
be a test. 

"He's a little bigger than I am and he has a longer reach," Joyce noted. "It will be a good fight." 
After Joyce finishes his encounter with Padilla, he'll be able to watch his best friend, Criniti, try to hold up his end of the bargain. The junior from Keough Hall is listed as the No. 2 seed, but could well be designated seed 1A, since both he and Joyce are likely equals. 
Joyce's southpaw often poses diffi­culties for opponents unfamiliar with fighting lefties, but Bryan Colville will have a go at it, earning the right to do so thanks to an easy unani­mous decision over Brent Barish. 
In perhaps a duel of dark horses, senior Dan Schaeffer will tango with sophomore John Lynk. Schaeffer, a superior tactician, will be on the move the entire fight, hoping to steer clear of the powerful Lynk, who dis­patched his first round opponent in a mere 34 seconds. 
"It's a real contrast in style," Joyce said. "Dan's real technical and John's a ball of muscle." 
To win, SchaefTer will have to pick his spots and avoid Lyn.k's devastat­ing right hand. 
"Anyone that tries to stay in against Lynk has no chance," Joyce said. "He tries to knock you out." 
Rounding out the bracket are Nathan Scheid and Keith Arnold. Arnold is a slugger in the classic mold, who, if given the opportunity to throw just one punch. can end a fight quickly. 
"Arnold's a one punch kind of 
guy," Joyce said. "He's very power­
ful."

Boxers move one step closer to winnning championships 
• 130-lb. fighters enter competition in quarterfinals 
By BRIAN BURKE Sports Writer 
Those who show up for the start of the Bengal Bout quarter­final matches Monday night will get an opportunity to see the smallest of the fighters as the 130-pound weight class begins competition. 
The first bout of the night matches Tom Steinbach against Brian "The Boxer Rebellion" Kenney. 
"Brian is trying to rest tonight for the fight, and he doesn't want to get wrapped up in the media, so I'll be fielding any questions from the press," said Kenney's "press secretary" Daniel Hibey. "[Brian's] an underdog, I'd say, because he hasn't fought anybody. There's some tough guys. in his weight class. He really belongs in 125 [pounds] but they didn't have enough fighters." 
The other 130-pound pairing features Derrick ''Hoof Hearted" Bravo against Coleman Lechner. Bravo enters his first fight hop­ing to box despite a foot that may not be 100 percent due to surgery over the summer. 
'Tm pretty nervous about [the fight]; it's my first year. I sparred against the guys I thought would be in my weight class, but I haven't sparred against [Lechner]," said Bravo. 
Bravo will look to negate the reach advantage of the taller Lechner by either staying away or moving in close where it may not be as big a factor. 
135 lbs. 
At 135 pounds, last year's champion and now a captain, Matt "The Don" Fumagalli begins his title defense when he takes on Tony Hollowell. 
Hollowell comes into the fight having defeated Charles Cullen. Although Hollowell is fighting in only his second bout ever, Fumagalli sees his opponent's prior fight as something that will help him in the quarterfinals. 
"This is going to be my first fight [of the year]. Tony has a fight under his belt," Fumagalli said. "He's a tough competitor, he's aggressive and throws a lot, so I'll have to counter that." 
Fumagalli comes in with a def­inite edge in experience, but sees expectations as something extra to deal with this time around. 
"Nothing's really changed from last year," Fumagalli said, "a little more pressure. A little more is expected of the cap­tains." 
The next card of the night pits Ryan Duffy against Guillermo Tijerina. Duffy enters his first fight after a preliminary round bye, while Tijerina hopes to con­tinue the momentum gained from a unanimous decision vic­tory over Eric Ota. Tijerina wants to keep the fight tactical and avoid too many wild exchanges. 
"I just want to be calm in the ring. This fight is for a good cause, so I'm not going out there with a lot of stress," Tijerina remarked. "fjabbed pretty well [against Ota]. for the most part kept the fight toned down. I'll try to keep that pace against Ryan." 
Also coming off a bye, Josh Coleman will take on Russell "The Muscle" Giancola, who was a preliminary round winner over Justin Pendarvis. 
"[Giancola) fights really aggressive, so I need to fight smart," said Coleman. "I can't let up on intensity, I need to con­trol the fight. He'll come at me. but I can't brawl with him. That's not my style." 
Coleman knows all too well the position he is in coming off a bye. . 
"I'm a little apprehensive, because last year, I upset the guy [in the quarterfinals]. and this year I'm that guy." 
Ginacola definitely will con~ centrate more on form in his second fight. 
"I saw a tape of my fight [against Pendarvis]." said Giancola. "My hands were up for about 30 seconds, so I definitely need to keep my hands up." 
Another strong contender in 135-pound division is Jason McMahon, who will take on Christopher Cardillo in his first bout of the year. 
Cardillo notched a preliminary round win over Michael Moore. He was patient in his first con­test, finally breaking the fight open in the second round. His opponent this time around, how­ever, will likely be more disci­plined. 
145 lbs. 
At 145 pounds, defending champion Michael Waldo faces Daniel "The Aztec Warrior" Gonzalez, who emerged from the preliminaries with a victory over Luke Macauley. Although Waldo is the top seed, Gonzalez was impressive in his first round win and could provide a chal­lenge for the champ in his first bout. 
Andrew "The Golden Arms" Harms and Anthony "T.J." D'Agostino both advanced to the quarterfinals by chasing their foes around the ring. They will get the opportunity to chase each other when they meet in the quarterfinals. Harms showed to be a hard hitter in his win, but D'Agostino will look to counter with a good jab and straight right. 
The next bout features two hard punchers who both knocked down their preliminary round foes. Jemar "Swift-T" Tisby battles Eric Eddy in a fight with definite knockout potential. 
"I need to make my nickname fit me, ducking and dodging, moving in and out," Tisby said. "That's what the short guys have to do." 
The final card at 145 pounds is a clash between Jason Voss and the experienced Anton Kemps. Voss defeated Walter Pfenning while Kemps enjoyed a bye. 
"He's the real deal," Voss said of Kemps, who along with Waldo will be a front runner for the 145-pound belt. Voss won a slugfest with Pfenning, but will need to avoid that type of fight against Kemps.

Sporu Writer 
150 lbs. 
If their last fights are any indication, tonight's fight between Tucker "The Wicked Bad Bostonian" McGree and Luke "Desperado" Busam should be a close one. Both boxers secured narrow split decisions in the prelimi­naries, with McGree defeating Patrick "The Kleese" Kolesiak and Busam dispatching Brian "The Irish Stallion" Long. 
Julian "Bel Biv" Devoe will have his hands full with Chris Matussa. Matussa received a bye to advance to the quar­terfinals, while Devoe nar­
155 lbs. 
One standout fighter on Thursday was Steve "The Natural Lightweight" Keppel. who will take on Tom Pierce, who was awarded a bye to the quarter­finals. 
Keppel had no problem with Shawn "The Full Monty" Monterastelli last week, securing a standing eight-count on his opponent in the first round, and then continuing his thrashing of Monterastelli for the next two rounds on his way to a unanimous decision. 
Keppel's strategy against Pierce is similar to his previous fight. 
'Tm looking to establish my stance early," said Keppel. "I want to be aggressive but still pace myself in the second and third rounds." 
Sean Novak didn't fight in the preliminaries but faces a challenge from law student Joe "The Polish Tank" Czerniawski. 
Czerniawski was one of the more impressive fighters that competed on Thursday night, soundly defeating Paul "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" Stinson in a unanimous deci­sion. Czerniawski stayed aggressive the entire fight, relentlessly pounding his opponent and causing the fight to be stopped due to Stinson's bleeding. 
160 lbs. 

Chris Pettit will be facing the class of Thursday's preliminaries fighters, namely Mike "The Militia Man" Melby. Pettit did not compete on

Melby said the exchanges were "pretty even -nobody really got the upper hand." As far as preparation for his next fight, Melby hopes to use size to his advantage. 'Tm taller, so I want to use my reach and keep my jab strong," Melby said. 
Dennis Abdelnour will fight Vince "The Italian Meatball" DeGennaro, giving DeGennaro a challenge. Abdelnour, who did not fight Thursday. is an experienced and tal­ented fighter. DeGennaro beat Andrew "The Atomic" Baum last week, a fight where DeGennaro gradually took control in the sec­ond and third rounds.

had a lot of help in taking the 
game from the Hokies. 
"We don't have any individ­uals," Murphy said. "We're the perfect definition of a team." 
Ingelsby's and Humphrey's pictures appeared next to that textbook definition of team play against the Hokies. Ingelsby, a senior point guard, dished off six assists, while Humphrey tossed a few well­placed post feeds. 
The hot shooting that marked the game's early going continued all game long. with Notre Dame scoring on a torrid 53 percent of its shots. Murphy, who topped the Irish with 20 points, and Carroll, who had 19, each hit 7-of-10 field goal attempts. Graves broke out of a shooting slump to score 19 on 8-of-14 shoot­ing. 
Notre Dame pulled off a 46 , to 29 advantage on the glass, led by 10 rebounds apiece by Murphy and Graves. 
Not to be overlooked was the security cover the Irish kept Virginia Tech's top scor­er Brian Chase under. Chase scored just eight points in the game. The Hokies were held to 49 points until just five minutes to play in regulation. At that point, the Irish had sizzled to a 34-point lead late in the game after a Graves layup and Carroll's third trey of the game, but the Hokies cut the gap down somewhat by scoring with Notre Dame's subs in. 
All 12 of Notre Dame's play­ers got in on the action as the Irish won their fifth consecu­tive road game for the first time since the 1953-54 sea­son. 
Reserve center Ivan Kartelo saw his first game time in more than a month after spraining his left ankle in January.

:t Conn-quering Huskies is next task for league champs
,I' 
! MEN'S BASKETBALL 
By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN Associate Sports Editor 
Tonight's road matchup with Connecticut has lost some of the luster it had a year ago, when the Huskies reigned as the defending national champions, especially since the Irish have already escaped with first place in the Big East West Division. 
The Notre Darne-UConn face­off remains a marquis game, though, as ESPN has it marked off for a primetime slot on Big Monday. Unlike last year, when the lower-ranked Irish stunned the Huskies by knocking them off twice in one season, this time it's the unranked

6, 11-3 Big East] are seeking to snag a higher seed. 
"We certainly know we'll be playing a UConn team that's playing for their lives up there on Monday," Irish coach Mike Brey said. 
The Huskies, at 18-9 and 7-7 in the Big East, are on the bub­ble of the NCM Tournament, a familiar position for this Irish team that wound up on the out­side of the bubble a year ago. A 60-53 win over Miami (Fla.) on Saturday helped UConn's chances, but beating Notre Dame and at Seton Hall next Saturday would improve the Huskies' postseason outlook. 
"They're a team that, they're always going to be good, no matter what their record is, especially going into their place," Irish small forward David Graves said of Connecticut. 
Graves was on the money when he said going to the Hartford Civic Center to play made Notre Dame's task tougher. The Huskies are an impressive 14-1 on their home­court, the lone loss coming to Villanova. 
The atmosphere in Hartford should be much like the one the Irish faced at Kentucky's Rupp Arena. The UConn fans, used to supporting highly successful teams, know their basketball, and get into theit team's games. 
The Irish have played well on the road, though, since losing three straight away from home in January. They've won their past five road games. the best by any Notre Dame team since 1953-54. 
"I think we've been better on the road than at home," Brey said. 
The Huskies' Albert Mouring, a senior, leads UConn in scoring 
with 16 points 
per game. But 
Taliek Brown 
and Jun10r 
college trans­fer Johnnie Selvie. 
"They're very young and they're very talented," Graves said. "They're a lot like Seton Hall." 

If UConn is like Seton Hall, the Irish have reason to worry, . since the Pirates are the only team to hand them a pair of losses this season. 
For guarding matchups, Husky center Souleymane Wane will have his hands full in guarding Irish All-American Troy Murphy. Forwards Edmund Saunders and Butler will have to take on the rotating trio of Graves, Ryan Humphrey and Harold Swanagan. Mouring will match up with Matt Carroll, while Brown will go up against Notre Dame point guard Martin Ingelsby. 
Swanagan will play despite a bruised right foot as the Irish work on getting their 20th regu­lar season win.

have her on the floor." 
Ivey finished the day with 10 points, nine rebounds and three steals. She rebounded from a first half in which she committed two fouls while hitting only one of nine field goal attempts. 
The Irish shot only 37 per­cent from the field in the opening half and trailed by as many as four points before scoring nine of the final 14 points of the half. 
McGraw blamed her team's 
sluggish start on emotions 
before the game. 
"I think I set the tone for 
the first half," McGraw said. 
"I couldn't control my emo­
tions before the game and it 
overflowed into some of the 
players." 
Ruth Riley led the Irish with 21 points on 7-of-10 shooting from the floor. Riley also hit seven free throws in her 38 minutes of play. Riley was also surprised by the emotion she felt before the game. 
"It didn't really hit me until 
I stood up there and saw the 
other seniors up there," Riley 
said. "It came over me a little 
bit, because so many times, 
you come out on the court in 
practice and in games -you 
don't take it for granted, but 
you don't realize how lucky 
you are to be out there." 
Fellow senior Kelley 
Siemon continued her 
improvement since coming 
back from a hand injury, 
chipping in 13 points and 
seven rebounds. Siemon 
teamed with Ivey for multiple 
fast-break baskets. The 
power forward realizes that 
the Irish likely have two 
more NCAA games in the 
Joyce Center, and wasn't quite as choked up by the days festivities. 
"I know we have two more games," Siemon said. "Those 
will probably hit me  a  little  
harder."  
Senior  guard  Katie  
Smrcka-Duffy  led  

Georgetown with 19 points. The senior guard has com­peted against the likes of Ivey, Siemon and Riley for four years, but was not lack­ing confidence entering the game. 
"We didn't come in and roll over," Smrcka-Duffy said. "We didn't say, 'Oh they're one, two, three, whatever they're ranked."' 
Rebekkah Brunsen, one of the top first-year players in the Big East, scored 12 of her team's first 18 points. She then was held scoreless for the remainder of the game. McGraw observed that the Irish defense was able to adjust her style of play as the game progressed. 
" I think as she got a little further away from the bas­ket, we had a little more pressure when she shot the ball," McGraw said. "In the first half, she got a bunch of open looks. In the second half, we were a little closer to her and made her shoot contested jumpers." 
Hoyas' coach Pat Knapp has seen his team fall 107-45 to Connecticut, yet was not satisfied with simply putting out a solid effort against one of the nation's elite teams. 
"It's very disappointing today," Knapp said. "I think our team did a lot of good things, we probably played Riley as good as we can play her. We had some good shots in those last ten minutes ­we had to have enough offense to beat Notre Dame today." 
HOCKEY 
Irish victory raises playoff hopes 
By JEFF BALTRUZAK 
Sports Writer 
Three weeks ago, Notre Dame's playoff hopes were just that -hopes. Desperate ones. 
Two consecutive losses at Ohio State had officially put the Irish against the wall, and the squad could not seem to find its scoring touch. 
That was then. 
Now, following a 3-1 win over Alaska-Fairbanks on Saturday and a 4-4 tie on Friday night in Fairbanks, the Irish suddenly control their own playoff destiny and playoff hopes have turned into playoff considerations. 
Notre Dame is 3-0-2 in its last five, and they have jumped ahead of Bowling Green in the race for the tenth and final playoff spot. with 18 points to the Falcons' 17. The win and tie this weekend improve Notre Dame's record to 9-21-7 over­all, and 6-14-6 in league play. 
Rotating goalies all season, Coach Dave Poulin went with Tony Zasowski in Friday's game against the Nanooks. The Irish jumped ahead on the Nanooks, only to watch their lead melt away. 
Fittingly enough, the Dan Carlson scored first for the Irish when he guided a Connor Dunlap slapshot into the net on the power play for a 1-0 lead. The senior left winger is Notre Dame's top scorer and has been the most consistant offensive threat all season but especially in the playoff drive. 
Less than four minutes passed before Cam Keith of the Nanooks beat Zasowski to tie the game, the first of two power-play goals Alaska Fairbanks would score during the period. 

Matt Van Arkel pounded a rebound past Preston McKay to give Notre Dame a 2-1 advan­tage, and just three minutes later, the siren would wail again for the Irish as Rob Globke fired a pass that David Inman one­timed into the net to give the Irish breathing room at 3-1. 
But the next 12 minutes of action would belong to the Nanooks. Keith netted his sec­ond goal at 18:36 in the first period, and at 10:10 in the sec­ond period, his teammate defenseman Chad Hamilton fired a puck that clipped Zasowski's glove on its way into the goal to knot the game at 3-3. 
The freshman Globke put the Irish up when Evan Nielsen fed him on the left side of the rink, and he put the puck past McKay as he crossed in front of the crease for a 4-3 Irish advantage. 
Going into the third period, Zasowski had to leave the game with blurred vision, the result of a collision while in goal during the second period. Poulin sent in junior Jeremiah Kimento to finish out the game and to pre­serve the slim Notre Dame lead. 
That lead evaporated when 

Cory Rask for the Nanooks slipped the puck between Kiminto's pads and the left post to tie the game at 4-4. 
The next 15 minutes of the third period and the entire five minute overtime went without a score as Kimento was solid for the Irish, making 10 saves in a reliever role. 
Kimento got the start on Saturday in place of Zasowski, and played solidly. He allowed just one goal in the second peri­od, saving 29 shots. 
"When they scored, it just made me mad," Kimento said. "I couldn't dwell on the goal." 
The start of the game looked like the previous night's contest, with Dan Carlson scoring first again in the opening period when Brett Lebda assisted him on the power play. 
Lebda got into the scoring col­umn himself when the Irish defenseman took a rebound and slammed it back past McKay. 
Carlson put the Irish up 3-1 when he scored his second of the night on an assist from Ryan Dolder after the Nanooks had pulled McKay looking for the equalizer. 
The Irish face off against Western Michigan this week­end.

TRACK AND FIELD 
Relay team breaks record during Belles' third place finish 

By KA TIE MCVOY 
Assistant Sports Editor 
The Saint Mary's track team, which will be dissolved next year, refuses to go quietly into the night. The Belles are going out to run and they are running away with new records. 
During Saturday's meet at Huntington College, all 10 women who competed placed, with the Saint Mary's eight-lap relay team winning and breaking a school record in three minutes, 45 seconds. 
"I think the fact that we did really well this meet shows that it's sad we won't have a team anymore," team captain Erica Burket said, "but we're still going to go out there and com­pete." 
Burket was part of the winning relay team along with freshmen Courtney Follmore and Lauren Stoeger and junior Laura Graf. The eight-lap relay in indoor competition is shorter than the 4x400-meter relay that is run in outdoor track, and the women owe their win, in part, to practic­ing the right distance during the week. 
"We had run that same dis­tance interval during the week," Burket said. "So we knew the distance and worked well on it. We knew how fast we had to go." 
"Everyone just put their mind to [winning]," team captain Kara 
Irish rank fourth in Sporting News survey 
Special to the ObseIVer 
The University of Notre Dame athletic program ranks fourth in the nation among 115 NCAA Division I programs playing both Division I men's basketball and Division I-A football. The rank­ing is according to a second annual survey by The Sporting News in which schools were graded according to standards ranging from on-field to acade­mic performance. 
The survey was based on the 2000 football and 1999-2000 basketball seasons. 
Notre Dame received one A. two B+s and a B for a 3.42 grade-point average. The Irish finished behind Stanford (3.5).. Michigan State (3.5) and North Carolina (3.5). 
Schools were rated based on grades in four areas: 
. 
"Do We Play Fair?" [Notre Dame received a B this year, an A last time] -number of teams sponsored, their success rates, graduation rates for all sports (for those who entered from 1984 through 1993) and Title IX compliance. 

. 
"Do We Graduate?" [Notre Dame received an A both years] -graduation rates for classes entering from 1990-93, based on 

•he 
most reent statistics pub­!lshed by the NCAA in its 2000 Division I Graduation-Rates Report. 

. 
"Do We Rock?" -fan sup­port. attendance, merchandise sold, size of athletic budget, number of teams and points awarded in Sears Directors' Cup 


Bergman added. 
The previous eight-lap relay 

record was a 1994 time of 3:50. 
In addition to the first place 

eight-lap relay finish, five Saint 
Mary's women went home with a 
top-three finish. The Belles fin­
ished in third place, only five 
points behind second place 
Goshen. 
'Tm so happy for the whole 

entire team," Bergman said. 
Marian College placed fourth 

in the meet. 24 points behind the 
Belles' 36. 
Saint Mary's cleaned up in the 

55-meter races. The Belles went 
one-two in the 55-meter hurdles 
and grabbed fourth place in the 
55-meter dash. 
Burket crossed the finish line 

of the 55-meter hurdles first, 
with a time of 9.22 seconds, and 
Stoeger was right behind her in 
9.77. 
In long distance events. Graf 

won the 800-meter run with a 
time of 2:18, breaking the indoor 
track record set earlier this sea­, son. 
Freshmen Nicole Garcia took 

home a third place finish in the 
1600-meter crossing the line in 
6:09. 
The Belles also placed eight 

women in field events, five in 
jumping events. 
Freshman Becky Shrepkowski 

won out in the triple jump, with 
a jump of 32 feet, 4 inches, also 
placing fourth in the long jump 
in 15-6 1/4. Her long jump was

only 1/4 inch short of Burket's school record. 
Junior Akmaral Omarova also placed fifth in the triple jump with a leap of 27-1/4. 
Freshman Kemi Adebamowo took a fourth place finish in the shot put with a throw of 26-1. Bergman and Stoeger tied for fifth place with throws of 24-1.

''BUBBLE BOY'' HOCKEY TOURNAMENT 
Coming to the club this Wednesday night is our annual "Bubble Boy" hockey tournament. Teams of two will match up against each other and play 
three 40 second periods. Winners advance to the finals and might even get a chance to play in the "city-,vide" tournament in downtown South Bend. Of course, the winners of this Wednesday night's tourney will also get prizes (t-shirts) and all participants get retro pint glasses from our sponsor. "Moaning Lisas" will also be playing this Wednesday night (no cover with club membership). Must be 21 or older with valid ID. 

injury. 
This meet was the last indoor meet for the Belles before they start outdoor competition in March. The team believes that this performance will be a spring­board to a good outdoor season. 
"I think everybody feels really good, considering [the team's dis­solution]." Bergman said. "Everybody is really excited for outdoor and really looking for­ward to it." 

When MIM competition starts, Saint Mary's will be running in small meets similar to Saturday's contest. 
"I definitely think [this meet] is a good indicator of how our sea­son is going to go," Bergman said. "It was a smaller meet and smaller teams, and that is how the MIM is." 
The team's first outdoor meet is at the Wabash Invitational on Mar. 17.

" WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
Seniors say goodbye to Joyce center with victory 
Ivey excels 
despite foul trouble 
By NOAH AMSTADTER 
Assistant Sports Editor 

Niele Ivey went from tears to fears on Senior Day, but in the end all she could hear were the cheers. 
Following an emotional pre­game ceremony in the Joyce Center on Saturday, the No. 2 Irish (25-1. 14-1 Big East) struggled to build a lead over conference foe Georgetown (15-12. 6-9) before finally pulling away in the game's final 10 minutes to win 65-53. 
Ivey re-entered the game with 12 minutes, 47 seconds remaining, carrying four fouls into the crucial final minutes of the game. 
In the next three minutes, Ivey drained a 3-pointer, found Ruth Riley under the basket and hit a free-throw. By the time the clock read 9:34, the four-point deficit turned into a four-point Irish lead.

So don't expect McGraw to recall every detail of her storied career as a player and coach, especially those that do not even exist. 

"I don't think they had Senior Day back then," McGraw said on Saturday. "They didn't even have video­tapes then." 
"Back then" was 1977, McGraw's senior season at St. Joseph's University in Pennsylvania. That was also the first year Notre Dame had a women's basketball team. 
On Saturday, 24 years after the Irish placed fourth in the AIWA Small College State Tournament in their first offi­cial season, the senior women's
