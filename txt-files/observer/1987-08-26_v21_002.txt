In Brief 
More women and minorities than ever before have entered Notre Dame this year. About 670 of the 1,820 stu­dents expected to enroll this year will be women, according to the admissions office. Also, about 180 freshmen, or 10 percent of the class, are minority students. More than 500 women entered Saint Mary's this semester. -The Observer 
Study lounges became home for 111 freshmen this semester. No Saint Mary's students were moved into tem­porary housing. The Office of Student Residences said the displaced Notre Dame freshmen will be moved into per­manent residences as soon as spaces become available, based on how soon the students returned their' confirmation forms. The office said it had "no idea of a time frame" in which the students will get permanent housing. -The Observer 
No drugs was the verdict given by congressional Iran-Contra mvestigators in a memo released Tuesday on allegations that Nicaraguan Contra leaders trafficked in drugs. A top CIA official said "a lot of people" associated with Eden Pastora, the former Contra leader based in Costa Rica, were linked to cocaine trafficking. One of the reasons the CIA cut its connection with Pastora in 1984 was drugs, a CIA official said. -The Observer 
What happened? is the question still plaguing federal investigators two weeks after the crash of Northwest Flight 255 near Detroit. The National Transportation Safety Board said preliminary tests to determine whether circuit breakers on the alarm system were pulled by the airliner's crew were inconclusive. More refined tests on the wreckage have been ordered. -The Observer 
Its bark was worse than its bite as a falling limb from a hickory tree killed a 58-year-old Washington County, Ind. man Monday. Taylor Gibson, of Campbel­lsburg, died instantly when a large limb hit the top of his head, said Monroe County Coroner Dennis Troy. The ac­cident occurred minutes after workers had chopped down a nearby poplar tree. Troy said the falling poplar tree may have loosened the dead limb that fell on Gibson, fracturing his skull. -The Observer

Sneak a peek at us: The Observer needs you 
With the beginning of the school year comes 
the need for The Observer to recruit new staff members. Because we are produced by only students every day, it is necessary to have a large number of people working to keep the newspaper coming out consistently. 
There are a lot of people at Notre Dame and 
Saint Mary's who do not know what we at The Observer do on the third floor of LaFortune every day and night. I'm not surprised; we never really explain what we do up here. 
So given the fact that this is the beginning of the school year, and that we are now graced with roughly 2,250 new members of this com­munity who may be interested in working here, I thought I would take a stab at explaining what goes into putting out your daily newspaper. 
Every day Sunday through Friday, some of the members of our staff of more 200 students are up at the offices working on The Observer. Our doors open at 8 a.m. when our office manager Shirley Grauel comes in and close about 20 hours later when our design editor for the night leaves with the "flats." 
Our paper gets picked up at the main gate by a gentleman from South Bend who is con­tracted to drive it down to our printing plant in Milford, Ind. (about one hour from campus), where 10,500 copies are printed for campus dis­tribution and roughly 2,000 copies are prepared for our subscribers. The finished product is then brought back to campus for delivery to the various drop spots. 
But the above is just the mechanical part; the student work at The Observer is done be­tween the hours of 8 a.m. and 4 a.m. With the unbelievable amount of money it takes to run a daily newspaper, the student monetary sup­port that we receive at The Observer covers about one quarter of our operating costs each year. Therefore, there is a need for students to sell advertising for the paper in order to support the majority of our operation. Each day, our advertising representatives make calls to and visit businesses in South Bend to talk about ad­vertising in The Observer. These ad reps not only get sales experience but also receive a commission from their sales. After this, our advertising design department makes up the ads for display in the paper. 
Closing out the business side of the newspaper is a small business department that handles our accounting and collecting, etc. Any of the above departments offers excellent business ex­perience for anyone who is looking for some responsibility and an extra line on the resume. 
The editorial side of the paper is made up of editors, writers, copy editors and page desig­ners. Besides the material that we take off the Associated Press wire every night, the stories and columns in The Observer are written by

students on their own free time. These stories and columns are then edited by an editor or assistant editor and checked for accuracy and spelling by a copy editor. At night, people from the various departments come in to decide on the content of the various sections and design the pages to include all of the stories that were assigned that day by the editors and written by the reporters. 
Our graphic arts department includes our campus strip cartoonist, a nightly general as­signment artist, and an artist to draw the illus­tration for the column that appears on this page every day, the Inside Column. 
Each night, there is also a person who operates our computer and typesetting equip­ment to take the stories that are typed into the computer and turn them into the columns that appear in the paper. These columns are then cut up by members of our production staff and placed by hand onto sheets the same size as the paper you are reading now. 
When production is over, the paper is delivered to the gate and printed; it arrives back on campus at about 10 a.m., two hours after we have started the next paper. 
The possibilities for students to work here are endless. These brief descriptions of some of the jobs up here are only the tip of the iceberg; there are a number that I did not even mention. 
So if you have any interest at all in getting rid of some of your spare time or if you would like to make a little bit of extra money or if you need a resume boost or if you would simply like to spend a little less time sleeping, come up to our offices and see what we have to offer. 
You may just like what you see.

Police investigating death of ND parent 
By MARK PANKOWSKI Managing Editor 
Police were continuing their investigation Tuesday into last week's accident that killed the father of a Notre Dame fresh­man, the county prosecutor said. 
Thomas Naddy Sr., 65, the fa­ther of Thomas Naddy Jr., died of massive internal injuries late Wednesday night in a two­car collision on Juniper Road, police said. 
The driver of the other car, Lynda Maike, 28, of Mis­hawaka, suffered internal in­juries in the accident, said Cpl. Charles Feirrell, public infor­mation officer for St. Joseph County Police. 
Police tests showed Maike's blood-alcohol level "was sub­stantially higher than the legal limit," Feirrell said. 
County Prosecutor Michael Barnes said Tuesday that police were still collecting evidence and trying to locate witnesses to the accident. 
Barnes said he did not know whether charges would be filed in the accident. "It's depends on the evidence," he said. 

Naddy, of Wailuku, Hawaii, was at Notre Dame to drop off his son, a Grace Hall freshman who had arrived early because he is an Air Force ROTC cadet, said Father Gerald Lardner, rector of Grace Hall. 
The accident occurred at about 11:10 p.m. as Naddy was driving south and Maike was heading north on Juniper Road, Feirrell said. 
The collision occurred in the northbound lane between Douglas Road and Pendle Street, Feirrell said. Inves­tigators are still trying to de­termine why Naddy's car was in the northbound lane, Feirrell said. 
Both drivers, the only oc­cupants in the cars, were repor­tedly not wearing seat belts, he said. Naddy was pronounced dead at the scene. 
Maike was taken to the St. Joseph's Medical Center, where she was released on Tuesday, a hospital adminis­trator said.

which will add 200 seats, he said. 
The serving areas will be remodeled to resemble the "scramble" lines in the South Dining Hall. The new lines will differ in that grills and fry sta­tions will be on the lines, he said. 
"We will be getting fresh products out to the hot food sec­tions at all times," Hickey added. 
The serving areas will also have a deli and dessert show­case, he said. 
The new serveries will "make things flow better," he said.

creased faculty and staff salaries as one of the reasons for the hike in tuition and fees at their respective schools. 
"Half of (Notre Dame's in­crease) went to salaries and related benefits," said Thomas Mason, vice president for busi­ness affairs at Notre Dame. 
"We want our faculty to be among the best paid in the country." 
Theoretically, Mason said, higher salaries mean better faculty are attracted to the Uni­versity. Notre Dame is trying to keep its faculty salaries in the top 20 percent in the nation. 
Other reasons for the in­crease in Notre Dame's tuition include the cost of operating new facilities and increases in liability insurance costs, Mason said. 
In his letter, Malloy wrote that "it is a source of some con­cern to ali of us here at Notre Dame that such increases in tuition and room and board are necessary. . . In the years ahead I hope to provide (parents) with a fuller expla­nation of our financial situation as well as the steps being taken to address these important matters." 
Malloy has asked the busi­ness affairs office to prepare a report on why tuition and fees are increasing, Mason said. 
This fall marks the third con­secutive year of 8 percent tui­tion and fee hikes at private, four-year institutions. The 6

The serveries will be con­
verted during the summer 
"because it is the demolition that will cause the most excite­ment as far as dust and dirt," Hickey said. 
The beverage machines will be remounted in alcoves in the dining area, Hickey said. New round "conversation" tables and carpeting will be featured in the dining areas. 
Food Services looked into other possibilities, such as ser­ving the food in the dorms or using Stepan Center as a dining hall, but found the ideas un­workable, Hickey said. 
Other construction projects are proceeding along, accor­ding to Don Dedrick, director of the Physical Plant. 
The Loftus Sports Center, an 
percent average at public, four-year colleges equalled last year's rise, but was less than the 9 percent increase in 1985­86. 
Last year, Notre Dame's tui­tion was hiked 9.9 percent and its room-and-board fee 7.1 per­cent. The year before, Univer­sity tuition jumped 10.8 percent and room, board and laundry charges 7.65 percent.

all-sports building north of the Joyce ACC, is nearing comple­tion, he said. 
The weight room will be finished by the end of the month, he said, with the arena scheduled for completion by the end of October. 
Problems with the delivery of materials have delayed the project, Dedrick noted. 
Construction on Knott and Seigfried Halls, two new wo­men's halls north of the Res­burgh Library, is "in good shape," he said. 
The external masonry and roof on Knott Hall, the west building, has been completed, Dedrick said. Seigfried Hall has been completed up to the third floor. 
Dedrick estimated that both buildings should be completed by June 1, 1988.

Last year Saint Mary's had a 6.7 percent increase in tuition and room and board, Hitchcock said. 
College costs thus continue to surge ahead of the overall in­flation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index, which has risen at a 5 percent rate so far in 1987.

Computerized card catalogs facilitate ND library research 
By GREG LUCAS Senior Staff Reporter 
Anew computerized catalog­ing system called UNLOC was recently activated by the Hes­burgh Memorial Library and its branches. UNLOC, the University of Notre Dame Li­braries Online Catalog, is de­signed to make research more efficient and effective, said Pat Max, instructional services co­ordinator. 
At the present time, the com­puter database contains records for all books cataloged since 1977 and 80% of the books received before then, Max said. He added that UNLOC is an evolving system that will con­tinue to grow and adapt to new information and needs. 
UNLOC is based on the exist­ing Library of Congress Cataloging System, an IBM mainframe and a NOTIS software system, Max said. The NOTIS software was developed by Northwestern University, Max said, adding it was chosen for its proven effec­tiveness in other large re­search libraries. 
The final cost for the imple­mentation of UNLOC is $1.7 million, said Robert Miller, director of libraries. The system had been in planning stages for about 5 years, Max said. 
UNLOC includes 93 termi­nals, distributed throughout the libraries on campus, Max said. Simple or very complex searches for information can be conducted from any of these terminals, he said. At some locations printers will be avail­able to eliminate copying time, Max said. 
''The system is user-friendly, but one will need instruction for more sophisticated functions, such as Boolean search tech­niques. We're trying to train anyone on campus who wants to learn," Max said. 
Freshmen will receive an in­troduction to UNLOC during their tour of the library, said Max. "I'm more concerned about the sophomores, juniors and seniors who may put off learning about the new sys-tern," he said. Max said the library intends to offer instruc­tion to upperclassmen through distributed literature, and a number of introductory lee­tures at the library, beginning in the next few weeks. 
As a growing system, UN­LOC will create many changes in the library in the very near future, said Max. 
By the middle of the school year, information will be released that will allow stu­dents with personal computers and modems to tap into the UN­LOC system from their rooms, said Max. 
It is also projected that by next year, light pen technology, as used in many supermarkets, will simplify and expedite the present system for checking out books, said Max. 
Max believes that the online catalog system, like UNLOC, will become the universaJ mode of communication among libraries around the na­tion. "To use it to its fullest power, you really need some training" Max said.

Special to The Observer 
Two graduates of Notre Dame have been elected to the University's Board of Trus­tees. Dr. Nancy Haegel and Tracy Jackson, members of the class of 1981, will replace Dr. Terrence Keeley, fixed income analyst with Paine Webber In­ternational in London, and Dr. Kathleen Sullivan, assistant professor of biology at the Uni­versity of Miami in Coral Gables. 
Keeley and Sullivan were the first to occupy positions set aside by the board for two recent graduates, under 30 years of age at the time of their election who would each serve one three-year term. 



Saudi Arabia warns Iran against city, 
oil attacks 
Associated Press 
JIDDA, Saudi Arabia -Saudi Arabia called Iran's govern­ment a "group of terrorists" Tuesday and said its forces would dea1 firmly with any Iranian attempts to attack this nation's Moslem holy places or its vast oil fields. 
In Tunis, meanwhile, Arab League foreign ministers decided to give Iran until Sept. 20 to accept a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a cease-fire in its 7­year-old war with Iraq. 
"Saudi Arabia has enough defense capabilities to repulse any Iranian aggression," Inte­rior Minister Prince Nayef warned Tuesday. 
"In the past the Iranians tried to attack eastern Saudi Arabia and had one of their warplanes shot down. We will not hesitate to deal similarly with any aggression." 
Naye£, a brother of King Fahd, announced a get-tough policy to head off any demonstrations by Iranian pilgrims in the Saudi holy city of Mecca, where hundreds died in clashes with police last month. 
His comments came hours after a senior Iranian cleric, Mahdi Karoubi, said pilgrims from Iran would continue to stage political rallies in Mecca. Karoubi was quoted by Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, as saying such rallies were a political obligation for all Mos­lems in addition to the religious rituals. 
Iran's ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Mus­tafa Haeri, dismissed the im­pact of a possible U.N. arms embargo as trivial and said Iran was testing new missiles and was capable of blocking the Strait of Hormuz. 
Haeri said in an interview in Abu Dhabi that Iran continued to buy weapons on the free market despite a loose Western embargo imposed since the Iran-Iraq war broke out in Sep­tember 1980. 
Kuwaiti tankers flying the American flag have been navigating the gulf under U.S. naval protection. 
'81 ND grads elected to Board of Trustees 
Haegel, of Milan, Ohio, was a valedictorian of her gradua­tion class and received a bac­helor of science degree summa cum laude in metallurgical en­gineering.
Jackson, who received his degree in economics and cap­tained the Irish basketball team his senior year, played in the National Basketball Asso­ciation for the Boston Celtics, Indianapolis Pacers and Chicago Bulls. 
Jackson, of Silver Spring, Md., is currently a stockbroker with the Folger, Nolan, Fleming & Douglas brokerage firm in Washington, D.C. 
Haegel and Jackson will at­tend their first Board of Trus­tees meeting in November.

VVednesday, August26, 1987 The Observer 
By SANDY CERIMELE Assistant Saint Mary's Editor 

Incoming freshmen are not 
the only new faces at Saint 
Mary's this year. Three new 
resident directors for McCand­
less, Holy Cross and Regina 
Halls have been added to the 
Residence Life staff, the Saint 
Mary's housing department 
said. 
The new directors are Chris­
tine Benvenuto in McCandless 
Hall, Marie Lievens in Holy 
Cross Hall, and Beth Lumma 
in Regina Hall. 

Benvenuto said her experi­ence as a resident assistant for more than 2 years at Indiana University of Pittsburgh helped her to be better qualified for the job. 
"Through my experience as an R.A., I have learned that programming and communica­tion are the key components to success in community living," she said. 
Benvenuto said her goals for the year are to get everyone involved in the school and to be approachable for the students in McCandless. 
She attributed the size of the school as helpful in achieving her goal. "I would like to get to know all the students and promote a general closeness. I think the smallness of the Saint Mary's community allows for that," said Benvenuto. 
Lievens said her love for people, background in psychol­ogy at Creighton University and two years' experience as a 
resident adviser all qualify her 
for the job. 
"I hope to enforce policies 
when addressed with issues, 
but not under the assumption 
that we are out to get 
everybody. There are reasons 
behind rules and our staff is 
working to help the students un­
derstand those reasons rather 
than just the fact that they 
must follow a set of rules," she 
said. 
Lievens said her goal for the 
year is to spur initiative and 
enthusiasm, direct that to the 
students and keep it going 
through the year. 
Lumma said her background in social work and two and a half years as a resident assis­tant at Illinois State University have prepared her for the po­sition of resident director. 
"My directing philosophy is to teach students self discipline and responsibility. We are not a policing force. We want the rules to make sense to the resi­dents," she said. 
Margaret "Mugs" Caven, who has 5 years of experience as a resident director at Saint Mary's, said the overall re­sponsibility of the job is "the administration of the building and the promotion and devel­opment of the community within it." 
The resident director's job is to challenge the students to pursue the unique opportuni­ties Saint Mary's offers to be involved in the community as women leaders, Caven added.

Titanic artifacts displayed around the world as 'respectful memorial' 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -The more than 300 objects recovered this sum­mer from the wreck of the Titanic will be neither sold nor held privately, but displayed around the world, organizers of an international expedition said Tuesday. 
"We have a lot of respect for the people who died" on the luxury liner, said Robert Chap­paz of France, an expedition or­ganizer. "Titanic was a kind of link between Europe and the United States, and it's part of our common history. It belongs to the people of the world." 
Artifacts also will be shown on a television special this fall, expedition officials said at a news conference. 
Under the terms of the ex­pedition's covenant, objects recovered "may never be sold," said Robert Slavitt, the expedition's lawyer. "No way, no time, no place, no how." 
The expedition's investors will receive proceeds from the television program and sales of tickets to view the collection. Ticket prices would be such that "a family of six will be able to afford it," said George in 1912, a statement released by the expedition said the ex­hibit would be "a lasting, respectful memorial." 
Earlier this month the Senate passed a resolution barring the sale or display-for-profit of Titanic artifacts. Although Slavitt questioned the vote's significance, Tulloch said the collection would be displayed in the United States on a non­profit basis, if necessary. 
The Titanic was first located in 1985 by a U .S.-French ex­pedition led by Robert Ballard, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. He later used a small submarine, Alvin II, and a small camera­carrying robot sub, Jason Jr., to explore the wreck, and his film became a National Geo­graphic television special on cable station WTBS. 
The latest expedition also will be the subject of a televi­sion program, a two-hour live special to be broadcast Oct. 28.. The program will be narrated by actor Telly Savalas and fea­ture the opening of a small pur­ser's safe. 
Objects recovered thus far from the debris scattered around the wreck include 160 dishes, four bottles, seven pieces of furniture, a propeller, a chandelier, a bronze cherub that once held a light on one of the ship's grand staircases and a leather satchel containing jewels, bank notes and coins.

Grant  White  of  Hutchison,  

Kansas, a doctoral student in theology, has received an award for study in England. 
White's research is in oriental studies and early Christianity. 
The Fulbright Scholar Pro­gram was established forty­one years ago under federal legislation introduced by former. Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas. Funded and administered by the United States Information Agency, the program's financial support comes from U.S. congressional 
appropriations  and  from  the  
governments of 27  other  na­

Outside of orientations, Student Gov­ernment and the Student Union Board are offering students Planning Calen­dars complete with athletic games, movies, and special events already marked on the appropriate days. These calendars are selling for one dollar through your hall presidents. 
Another service provided by Student Government this weekend was a shuttle from the Michiana Regional Airport to Notre Dame. The shuttle service which was run on Sunday was very successful. 
We plan to run it for the rest of the year at break times. 
So, there you have it-a more concrete answer to the question, "What is Stu­dent Government?" We can always use new ideas about what services the stu­dents want and need. Please bring your ideas to Student Government on the second floor of LaFortune. 
We're looking forward to a year in which students see tangible results so they don't have to ask, "What is Student Government?"

Quote of the Day 
"Aim at the sun, and you may not reach it; but your arrow will fly far higher than if aimed at an object on a level with yourself." 
Joel Hawes 

When people ask us, "What is Student Government?", our response, in con­densed form, has been that student gov­ernment is a service organization run by and for Notre Dame students. 
Pat Cooke Laurie Bink 
guest column 
This answer is often met with nods of heads, but somehow we feel that it doesn't really clarify what Student Gov­ernment does. Concrete examples might help. So let us relate to you those Student Government services which were available already this year. 
Freshman Orientation is a branch of Student Government. Over seventy­five students on the Freshman Orien­tation committee worked to plan and organize a movie, two dances, ice cream socials, picnics, tours, an orien­tation booklet, and a giant game of mu­sical chairs to welcome the Class of 1991 to Notre Dame. Freshmen seemed to have a great time. Hopefully, the work of Student Government and Dr. Hof­man will make the transition from home to Notre Dame a little easier for our new students. 
Like Freshman Orientation, Trans­fer Orientation was organized by Stu­dent Government. Transfers were wel-

Olympic volunteers lauded for effort 
Dear Members of the Notre Dame Family: 
I want to thank in a special way those students, faculty, staff and administra­tion who participated as volunteers and workers in the International Special Olympic Games in the first week of Au­gust of this past summer. For all of us who were present it was one of Notre Dame's finest hours. Of course, we did not do it alone since it was really a cooperative effort on the part of Notre Dame, Saint Mary's College and the surrounding community. The courage, persistence and love that were so evi­dent were a source of inspiration to all of us. Many of the athletes and their families commented to me that they had never been better treated anywhere, and they especially appre­ciated the genuine interest and concern they experienced. 
There is no way in which I can thank each member of the Notre Dame com­munity who participated. Some operated behind the scenes, assuring that the ordinary tasks were attended to, and others were more on the front lines. But everyone carried their weight and it was a magnificent week. Thank you for being a part of this special event. May it continue to be a sign of what we can achieve together. 
Rev. Edward Malloy, C.S.C. President

It took me over a month to find out that the person on top of the Golden Dome wasn't Thomas Jefferson. I don't know why I thought It was Jefferson, It must have been the stately pose and the lack of a beard. 
Now that I'm a senior I admit that I really haven't changed much. I still have everything in storage and have no food in my fridge or blankets on my bed.

New stadium hon.ors former athletic director Krause 
Special to the Observer 
The new 5000-seat stadium just east of the ACC will be named after former director of athletics Edward W. "Moose" Krause. 
Dedication ceremonies are set for halftime of the Notre Dame-Michigan State soccer match, Sept. 18, the night before the Irish football team clashes with the Spartans. The soccer match begins at 7: 30 p.m. 
The lighted facility was con­structed last summer for use during the International Sum­mer Special Olympics Games. It will serve as the home for the Notre Dame soccer, track, lacrosse and field hockey teams. 
IAAF starts drug tests 
Associated Press 
ROME -The IAAF, the governing body of interna­tional track and field, has im­posed procedures for year-round drugs tests for ath­letes -both in competition and training -to try to prevent the use of illegal substances, its Medical Commission an­nounced Tuesday. 
The plan is to conduct ran­dom tests everywhere and at all times, "to chase the cheaters right into their train­ing havens and catch them red­handed," IAAF vice President Arne Ljungqvist of Sweden, who also heads the Medical Comission, said. 
Moose Krause has been on the Irish athletic scene since he showed up as a student 55 years ago. Earning monograms in football, basketball and track, he particularly excelled in bas­ketball, scoring 547 points in three seasons and leading the Irish to a 54-12 record. In 1976 he was inducted into the Na­tional Basketball Hall of Fame. 
Krause served as athletic director from 1948-1980, reliev­ing former head football coach Frank Leahy from his duties. He also coached the basketball team for six seasons, compiling a 98-48 record. 
The stadium features 2500 permanent bleacher seats on both sides of a 70-by-120 yard grass field. The field is sur­rounded by a nine-lane, Mondo­surface track, and is lighted by six standards with 16 lights apiece. 
''Being able to play under the lights at Krause Staidum is really going to benefit our pro­gram," says Irish soccer coach Dennis Grace. "It's an ab­soloutely incredible facility. It will be nice to see those lights on and several thousand people up in the stands when we come out for our games. 
"I think 5000 seats is just about right. If it were any

INDIANAPOLIS -Denny Crum said he doesn't think the 
U.S. Pan American basketball team's loss to Brazil in the gold-medal game will hurt his chances for being named the Olympic coach in 1992. 
"I don't have any way to judge that, but I don't think so," said Crum, head coach at Louisville. "I talked to several USOC <United States Olympic Committee) officials after the game and they were very com­plimentary. 
"They congratulated me on a job well done and said we just ran into a hot team. I didn't get any heat from anybody." 
Brazil shocked the U.S. team 120-115 on Sunday. Crum now joins Jim Gudger of East Texas State as the only coaches not to win a gold medal in the Pan American games. 
Crum said despite that dis­tinction, he doesn't regret having taken the Pan Am job. 
"I'm tickled to death I had a chance to do it," he said Mon­day. "I'd do it again. I enjoyed every minute of it. We should have beaten Brazil, but I'm not going to make a negative sit­uation out of a great experi­ence. It was fun." 
Crum also isn't going to shoulder the blame for the loss. 
"In this business, you're al­ways going to get criticized, but we did the best we could do. I don't get to shoot the basketball 
"I don't know what more I could do. I feel good about what we did. I wouldn't change a thing, except the final score. Upsets happen; that's what sports are all about."

Molitor hits in 39; Brewers down Tribe 
Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE Milwaukee's Paul Molitor extended his hit­ting streak to 39 games Tues­day night with a sixth-inning single against the Cleveland In­dians in the Brewers 10-9 vic­tory. 
Molitor, in his fourth at bat, lined reliever Don Gordon's first pitch in the sixth for a single to right field. 
Dale Sveum homered and drove in five runs to pace Mil­waukee. 
In his first at-bat in the bot­tom of the first, Molitor hit a fly ball to right field. Batting in the second he walked, and in the fourth he grounded out to second base. 
Molitor is 68-for-163, a .417 average, during his streak. For the season, Molitor is batting .371 but does not have enough plate appearances to qualify among the leaders. 
Molitor's streak is the fifth longest in modern major­league history and the longest the majors since Cincinnati's Pete Rose hit in a National League-record 44 consecutive games in 1978. The last time an American League player had a longer streak than Molitor's was in 1941 when the New York Yankees' Joe DiMaggio set the major-league record of 56 games. 
Molitor's next target is Ty Cobb's 40-game hitting streak in 1911 for Detroit. 
Also ahead for Molitor is George Sisler, who hit in 41 straight for the St. Louis Browns in 1922. 
Prior to 1900, Baltimore's Willie Keeler hit in 44 straight in 1897 and Chicago's Bill Dah­len hit in 42 straight in 1894. At that time, several rules were different, including foul balls not counting as strikes. 
The Brewers' designated hit­ter will try to make it 40 straight Wednesday night when Milwaukee hosts Cleveland again. Rich Yett is scheduled to pitch for the Indi­ans. 
All three major television networks, the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour and a dozen newspapers who do not cover the Brewers on a regular basis descended on-County Stadium Tuesday to monitor Molitor. 
"If you learn anything about yourself, it's how you are going react to outside distractions of the streak. I've not had that much experience with the media in these numbers except for po~t-season play in 1981 and 1982 but that was more team focused," Molitor said before Tuesday's game. 
"If I've learned anything, it's that this game has helped you prepare for moments like this; you can keep things in perspec­tive." 
Molitor has missed 44 games with injuries. He would need to average almost four at-bats a game the rest of the season to accumulate the 502 plate ap­pearances necessary to qualify 
for the batting title. 
Molitor, who went 1-for-4 with a walk, singled in the sixth inning on the first pitch from reliever Don Gordon. Molitor moved within one game of tying Ty Cobb for fourth place on the major league list of modern-day hitting streaks. 
Molitor flied out in the first 
inning and walked in the second 
against starter Ken Schrom. 
He then grounded out sharply 
to second base in the fourth off 
Jamie Easterly. 

With a crowd of 15,580 on its feet Molitor didn't wait in the sixth. His liner hit the back dirt of the infield in the hole be­tween first and second base and sped into right field, and the crowd responded with a 1112­minute standing ovation. Molitor flied out in the eighth. 
Molitor is 68-for-164 (.415) 
during the streak that began 
July 16. 

Juan Nieves, 11-6, was the 
winner. 

Tigers 5, Twins 4 
MINNEAPOLIS Chet Lemon and Kirk Gibson each drove in two runs and Doyle Al­exander beat Minnesota for the second time within a week Tuesday night as the Detroit Tigers defeated the Twins 5-4. 
The Twins have lost seven of their last eight games and had their American League West lead cut to one game over Oak­land. 
Alexander, 2-0, gave up four runs on seven hits in 7 1-3 in­nings. 
Mike Henneman relieved Al­exander with one out in the eighth after Randy Bush's RBI triple and went on to earn his fourth save. 
Joe Niekro, 6-10, lost for the sixth time in his last seven deci­sions. 
Red Sox 7, White Sox 3 
BOSTON -Sam Horn hit two solo home runs and Dwight Evans reached the 100-RBI mark for the second time in his career Tuesday night, leading the Boston Red Sox over the Chicago White Sox 7-3. 
Evans, a 15-year veteran, and Marty Barrett keyed a four-run third inning with two­run singles. John Marzano homered in the Boston fourth. 
Steve Crawford, 5-3, relieved Boston starter Al Nipper in the 
.th the Red SOX ahead 6-3fifth Wl

Injuries, ineligibilities hit as ND fall workouts begin 
By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 
While Lou Holtz has been pleased with what he's seen on the field these past two weeks, a number of developments off the field are less than promis­ing. 
The Irish have lost the 1987 services of: 
 Offensive guards Jason Cegielski and John Zaleski. The two were dismissed from the University for academic reasons after spending most of their freshman year on aca­demic probation. 
Cegielski and Zaleski were two of the five players suspended from spring football 
last year for  disciplinary  
reasons, and  were also  
Irish  

continued from page 24 
in Notre Dame history. 
And while that's quite a bil­ling to live up to, there is cer­tainly no shortage of talent among the class of 1991. 
Freshman running backs Ricky Watters and Tony Brooks were the leading ground gainers in Saturday's scrimmage with 88 and 55 yards, respectively. 
"Our backs ran well," Holtz said. "Tony Brooks and Ricky Watters have an awful lot of talent."

suspended by Holtz last No­vember for separate infrac­tions of team rules. 
 Sophomore center Steve Huffman. Huffman quit the team last week for personal reasons. 
His absence has prompted Holtz and the Irish coaching staff to try defensive tackle Matt Dingens at the back-up center position -just in case. Senior co-captain Chuck Lanza will start in the middle. 
 Senior split end Tony Eason. Eason will sit out the entire year after undergoing surgery to his left knee in July. The surgery repaired ligament damage suffered during a sum­mer workout. 
Eason could apply for eligibility in 1988. 
Green showed why Holtz has tabbed him the squad's premier back, picking up 47 yards on six carries, scoring a 
touchdown and turning a bro­ken play into a 25-yard gain. 
Defensively, Holtz saw what he wanted to see in the scrim­mage. 
"The whole defense hit well," Holtz said. "I thought the hitting was outstanding today. 
"The defense played with in­tensity and -above all -they scored." 
Holtz was referring to the first touchdown of the day, when first team inside linebacker Ned Bolcar inter­

In addition, senior outside linebacker Cedric Figaro, sophomore inside linebacker Mike Stonebreaker and sopho­more center Jim Dadiotis are awaiting decisions concerning their academic eligibility. 
Figaro has been given per­mission to practice and is ex­pected to be in uniform this season. 
The situation with the two sophomores, however, looks less promising. Both have been kept out of practices so far. 


cepted a Pete Graham pass and returned it 61 yards for a touch­down. Senior outside linebacker Cedric Figaro pres­
sured Graham on the play. 
"It was just a tremendous ef­fort by Cedric Figaro today," Holtz said. 
A number of penalties -many on the offensive and defensive lines -plagued Saturday's scrimmage, but Holtz said those can easily be ironed out. 
"Most of those were on the younger players," Holtz said. "It's a combination of things. We don't have a history of making those mistakes on Sat­urday, and we won't make them this year. "

Sutton becomes latest scuffball suspect of season 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK jim Palmer, a three-time Cy Young award winner when he pitched for the Baltimore Orioles, said Tues­day that Don Sutton told him several years ago the best way to scuff a ball was to use sandpaper pasted on your glove hand. 
Palmer recalled the advice, unaware that a television close­up shot Monday night showed a patch of some sort in the Cal­ifornia Angels right-hander's bare left hand as he rubbed up the ball in a game against the visiting New York Yankees. 
Sutton, who has been accused of scuffing the ball, said the patch was a bandage to cover a blister. 
Palmer, discussing scuff balls in general, said Sutton told him in the "early 1980s" how to doctor a ball. 
"Don told me to just take some sandpaper and Super Glue, put it on your glove hand

rigan did have a problem with 
that." 
Once the story broke, Cor­rigan tried to call back Morten­sen, but Mortensen was on vacation. So Corrigan called the Associated Press office in Atlanta to deny the coverup. 
Corrigan then talked to Davidson, who wrote a follow­up story on the situation. Both Davidson and Corrigan agreed that he was quoted correctly, but the assumption made by Mortensen in the second para­graph of the article involved a misunderstanding. 
"We were not talking about the same thing," said Cor­rigan. 
In their extended conversa­tion Davidson said that Cor­rigan, though upset over the report, was not "ranting and raving." 
"Gene Corrigan is a first­class person, and it was han­dled in a first-class way," said Davidson. 
Meanwhile Miller is ex­pected to testify in front of the grand jury, and has been advised not to talk about the case. Miller had indicated as early as April, however, that he would not be returning to Notre Dame in the fall for a fifth season of eligiblity. He finished school and graduated in the summer. 
A July 21 Associated Press story said that Miller and 
Robert  Banks,  a  defensive  
tackle  at  Notre  Dame  last  
season  and  a  seventh-round  

draft pick of the Houston Oilers, were both subpoenaed by the grand jury in Chicago. The story says that the Notre Dame athletic department learned of the subpoenas in May. 
Several other college football and basketball players have lost their eligibility for their in­volvement with Walters and Bloom. Chris Carter of Ohio State, James Lott of Texas, Teryl Austin of Pittsburgh and basketball star Derrick McKey of Alabama all have been declared ineligible for their senior seasons. Running back Charles Gladman of Pittsburgh was declared ineligible after refusing to cooperate with the NCAA and the university into Walter's and Lloyd's dealings with Pittsburgh's players.

NEWARK, N.J. Hodgkin's disease, the form of cancer that has stricken New York Giants tackle Karl Nelson, is one of the most treatable and surviv­able forms of the disease, al­though its cause remains un­known, doctors and researchers said Tuesday. 
The disease attacks the body's lymphatic system and is characterized mostly by the progressive enlargement of the lymph nodes. 
"Basically, Hodgkin's dis­ease is a mystery to a lot of people," said Dr. Alan Lip­pman, associate director of the oncology department at Newark Beth Israel Hospital. "The more doctors examine it, the more questions we have. We really don't know how to classify it." 
The disease first was des­cribed by English physician Thomas Hodgkin more than a century ago. Until 1947, it was considered an infectious dis­ease rather than a cancer, said Larry Garfinkel, vice presi­dent of epidemiology and sta­
Nelson's cancer treatable 
tistics for the American Cancer Society. 
"What's peculiar about it is that is has the features of a malignancy and also the fea­tures of a chronic infection, at least under a mircoscope," said Dr. Robert Krigel, direc­tor of hematology at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. 
Hodgkin's disease occurs at any age, although the Ameri­can Cancer Society said it mostly strikes young adults 15 to 35. 
Its symptoms include swell­ing in the arm, neck or groin areas, and can also be accom­panied by fever, weight loss, back or abdominal pain, night sweats, nausea and vomiting. 
In Nelson's case, the disease was discovered during a routine chest X-ray prior to arthroscopic surgery for an arthritic condition in his left shoulder. 
Once the cancer is detected, a biopsy is performed and the tissue evaluated. 
Lippman said Hodgkin's is classified by four stages. In Stage I, only one area of the body is involved. Stage II is two

areas, such as the neck and 
arm. Stage III is two areas in 
different parts of the body, 
such as neck and groin, and 
Stage IV, the most serious, is 
when the disease has spread to 
an internal organ. 

Nelson has been diagnosed as Stage I, according to the Giants' team physician. 
There are also three or four subclassifications of the dis­ease, depending on what cells are found in the affected lymph nodes, Lippman said. 
In almost all cases, the prescribed treatment is radia­tion, chemotherapy or a com­bination of the two.

Garner buys Indy team 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS Actor 
James Garner, who's driven 
the pace car twice in the In­
dianapolis 500, will join a motel 
owner in sponsoring a racing 
team for the 1988 race, a pub­
lished report said. 
Garner and Larry Cahill of 
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, will be co­
owners of the team, The In­
dianapolis News reported 
Tuesday. A driver will be 
named later. 
Publicists later announced 
that the pair would hold a news 
conference Thursday in In­
dianapolis to discuss their part­
nership. 
Garner, best-known for his 
television roles on "Maverick" 
and "The Rockford Files," 
drove the pace car for the Indy 
500 in 1977 and 1985. 
Cahill, 50, owns a racing shop 
in Cedar Rapids and with his 
brother owns 60 motels, most 
of them Holiday Inns, in 24 
states. 
Both Garner and Cahill have 
racing backgrounds. 
Garner drove dragsters in 
the 1940s and became further 
involved in racing after he 
made the movie "Grand Prix" 
in the 1960s.
