Discusses dorms, security 

Hesburgh talks in Flanner pit 
by Jim Eder Staff Reporter 
I don't think that we need coed dorms here at Notre Dame." Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh told a group of 200 students who crowded the Flanner "Pit" for an hour­long question-and-answer session with the university's pr<'sident last night. 
"Some schools need to have men and women living in dose contact with one another," he explained, "but I feel that we have enough variety among the people and halls here to make life interesting without having coed dorms." 
When asked to explain his position on having women undergraduate students live off-campus, Hesburgh said. "Our effort right now is"to get as many women on campus as quickly as possible. The goal is to have over 1000 women living here within the next two years. Having them Jive off-campus would defeat this pur­pose." 
"The soeiallife can get pretty dreary around here at times. especially at this time of year," Hesburgh admitted. "but I believe it will improve when more girls are brought to the. campus. Still, I think social life. is better today than it ever was---certainly better than wlwn I started here twenty years ago." 
Commenting on security at Notre Dame, Hesburgh said that it is impossible to have fool~proof security. "There are just too many opportunities for someone to do something bad if he wants to. The ideal is to spend a limited amount of money on security and rely on the people of the community to provide some of their own." 
The president did admit, however, that things could be improved. ''I spoke with H-man (Dennis Etienne) this morning about setting up a meeting between students and the security people. Dr. Faccenda is working on that now." 
Questioned about the expulsion of a Lewis Hall resident for a parietals violation, the president said that "the case was handled in the only way it could have been at the time." According to Hesburgh, who was away from the campus at the time of the incident, there was no precedent for the case because when the hall was built. he decided not to establish a definite eode of behavior for the graduate students. 
When asked to give his opinion on the recent Supreme Court ruling on abortion, Hesburgh said, "I think it's terrible. The fetus is the most helpless being in the whole world, and it is getting no protection from thl' selfishness of human beings. I don't think that one can stand up for the underdog as I have tried to--black or brown or woman or chicano or whatever--and not stand up for the most helpless of all beings, which are unborn children." 
lies burgh went on to say. "The moral health of this country is very much related to its respect for life--its rl'spect for people. If this country sinks into broad immoral practices, then we will all pay for it in the long run." 
Speaking on the topic of civil rights, Hesburgh said, "I think that we will be facing tough days ahead, because there is a lot of lost enthusiasm for the cause. I noticed during the last few months that I was in charge of the Civil Rights Commission that it was becoming increasingly difficult to get the government and people to be responsive." 
llesburgh announced that he plans to form a civil rights center in the Notre Dame Law School, where there will be an extensive library dealing with the subject. He has already asked the Ford Foundation for a grant of a half million dollars to finance the project, and he is awaiting their reply. "I hope that we can then hold a national conference here every year to focus on thl' precise points of greatest importance to the movement." 

Though the long-range effect of the new appearance of the Huddle won't be known for a while, many students are now finding the disadvantages of having to wait in two lines: one for service, one to pay. (Staff photo). 
Faccenda: University to force only 100 OC 
by John Abowd Editor-in-Chief 

Only about 100 students will be forced off campus next year when the student affairs office eliminates the present dormitory overcrowding. according to Dr. Philip Faccenda, acting vice presidnt of student a Hairs. 
Speculation throughout the past two weeks had put the figure at over 300. 
Faccenda made the announcement at a press conference last night. Frs. James Flanigan. James Shilts and James Riehle, nwmbers of the central staff of the Vice President of Student Affairs office also fielded questions. 
There are presently 185 freshmen living in rooms that will not be used next year. These students are the last of the 325 frosh who were invoived in the on campus housing shortage at the beginning of the school year. 
"We promised that the dormitory overcrowding would be a one year oc­eurence and I don't think we can go back on our word." Faccenda said. · 
The vice president defended his prediction of 100 students by referring to the ratio of on campus to off campus ~tudents from 1967. The average per­centage of off campus students for those six years was 20.4. In every year except 19fi9 the figure was over 20 percent. 
Faccenda predicted that 22.5 percent of the student body would have to live off eampus next year. Since no increase in enrollment is planned, this means that about fifteen hundred undergraduate students (out of 6725) will not be able to live on campus. 
Currently 1427 students live off campus <21 percent l. The difference between the trend figures and the 1973-74 prediction is the basis for the estimate of only 100 ~tudents forced off campus. 
"We are making this estimate based on historical trends. We could be off by as much as 100. That is, we might have to force no one off campus. We do not expect that the figure will be much higher than 100." Faccenda added. 
The normal attrition rate during the first month of the school year is 100 students, according to Riehle. director of student housing. When this consideration is made, the final breakdown is· 6625 total un­dergraduate students with 5110 on campus and 15Hi off campus. 
Faccenda denied that the housing shortage was caused by guaranteeing female transfer students on campus residency. 
"Notre Dame only accepts transfers to fill vacancies that already exist in the upper classes," Faccenda said. He added that there are usually 125 vacancies which represent about 100 empty on campus beds. 
The fact that all female transfer students are . :,aranteed on campus housing while m ·ie students are not was not important, according to Faccenda, because most male transfers who wanted to move on campus could do so during tp~ first month of the school year. 
When asked about a possible reveFSal of the rule which prohibits fMJ"!!i"le un­dergraduates from living o(f' campus, Faccenda said "We have as~d the male students to disrupt their liyes considerably to make room for the women. I don't think it's too much to ask lbe women to disrupt their lives slighty 
"These are tht>· terms under which we offered admissiQn to females," he con­tinued. 
The vice .President contended that students moving off campus that are not anticipated "cause almost 100 percent loss to the university." 
He noted that the number of females involved was "probably very small," but added that in the second year of coeducation Notre Dame would still have difficulty accurately predicting trends with female students. 
The student affairs office recommended the admission of 450 more women students next year. "This is more than the quota recommended by the academic com­mittee. It represents the absolute upper limit in which we could recruit in our second year," Faccenda said. 
The committee which will decide how to relocate the displaced Farley and Breen­Phillips :;.tudents will meet for the first time today. According to Faccenda, the chariman. the agenda is: 
--formulation of recommendations on how to offer space in the remaining residence halls 
--recommend methods to select 100 students who will be forced off campus.

On nursing old grievances 
By James Reston 
(C) 1973 New York Times 

Was~on. Feb. 1---A lot of people around het~ bave been wondering about President Nixo.i''s mood as he goes into his second term. and now we have a few hints from the President himself. The man is fighting mad. He has his second term and his settlement in Vietnam, and he has come out of his struggles with all his grievances intact. lf anything, he is more combative and energetic than ever before, and he seems determined to reform everything and t-verybody but himself. 
. (;t-orge Wallace used to urge the American people to "Send a message to those guys in Washington," but now it is the President. who apparently heard the· Wallace message, who is sending a message hack to the people. THE Congress, and his critics. 
"Shape up," he says, with all the subtlety of a sergeant major. Get to work. Don't ask what the nation can do for you, or even what you can do for the nation. but what you can rlo for yourself. 
!lis 'budget, his remarks about the <'ongress. his defense of the bombing in the last weeks of the war. and his claims for the "Peace" are not appeals for reconciliation hut defiant declarations of war. The secon<;J. t t-rm was going to be "exciting", tie promised, and that may be t~ un­dt-rstatement of the new year. 
The text of his last news c.onference is a revealing document. Th~ ·tone is that of a man who has won a great political victory and settled a wan~obody else could end, and how is is not goil'ig to be crossed by all those \'icious grumblers who ahandoned him in the struggle and didn't even have the grace to admit he was right all along. 
When he was · asked whether he had anything in mind to help heal the wounds in this country," he took a somewhat different line from Mr. Lincoln. and answered with malice toward some and charity only for his supporters. 
"Well," he said, "It takes two to heal wounds. and I must say, when I see that the most vigorous criticism--or shall we say the least pleasure out of the peace agreement comes from those who were the most out­spoken advocates of peace at any price--it makes one realize whether some want the wounds healed. We do." 
Nixon did recognize that maybe the Congress had a problem getting information from the Executive if his officials misused Uie device of executive privilege and ~~ to testify on Capitol Hill. 
Hel~ was cautious and agreed to think about the ~blem and make a considered statement on l'f. later, but he asserted his right to impouna wnds voted by an irresponsible Congress, "'8.Qd his remarks about granting amnesty to tlresP who had refused to serve in the war left no room for compromise now or later on. 

The amnesty question didn't ask him whether he was considering such a policy now but "down the road much farther." 
"Amnesty means forgiveness," he said. "We cannot provide forgiveness for them. Those who served paid their price. Those who deserted must pay their price, and the price is not a junket in the peace corps or something like that, as some have suggested. The price is a criminal penalty for disobeying the laws of the United States. If they want to return to the United States, they must pay the penalty. If they don't want to return, they are certainly welcome to stay in any country that welcomes them ... " 
Many things might be said about this. First. amnesty is a very hard question that dearly divides the Nation, but amnesty does not mean forgiveness. It comes from the same root as amnesia, it is an act of "forgetting" past acts. Second, he left himself no out for the future and evett' rejected the compromise of non~ry service. Third, it dramati~k ~ril{e the savage bombing of 1\lJ,Wtlt-cVietnam, and some of his stiff bUdgets on many social probgrams, an insensitivity to people in trouble. if not an actual strain of cruelty. 
"Certainly," he said, "I have sympathy for any individual who has made a mistake. We have all made mistakes. But also, it is a rule of life, we all have to pay for our mistakes." This is odd coming from a man who has certainly made his share of mistakes. but has somehow managed oveJr a long and remarkable career to be re3arded rather than punished for many of them. 
Maybe all this merely indicates the exuberance of the election and the Vietnam settlement, or one of the dangers of the open news conference---that sometimes it brings delicate questions to the fore at an awkward time---but this sort of thing has happened too often lately to be regarded as an accident. 
Nixon's assumptions seem to be, not only 
that he has been right on these moral 
questions all along, but that there was little 
or nothing to be said on the other side. Also, 
that he has a mandate from the people for 
all his policies---never mind the help he got 
from George McGovern or the fact that the 
Democrats were re-elected as the 
Congressional majority--and that he intends 

to push them through. It is a bold policy, but 
it is certainly not the way to reconciliation.

'Publish and be damned' 

By Tom Wicker 
(C) 1973 New York Times 

New York---Self-censorship may well be a graver threat to a free press in America than anything the government is able to do. That is the trouble with the Twentieth Century Fund's well-intentioned plan to establish a press council to monitor the performance of national news organizations. 
The New York Times has announced that it will not cooperate with the council, and there are some other major holdouts; but enough others have agreed to participate­most of them reluctantly--so that the council probably will get off the ground. Probably nothing could please the Administration's press watchdogs more. 
It is true that, with their well-known hostility toward at least the "Eastern Liberal Press," and given a re-elected President's hardnosed new attitudes, the Nixon men pose a substantial threat. But in trying to act through official means to cripple the press, they will encounter constitutional barriers, Congressional resistance and perhaps even some public hostility. 
Congress and the legislatures, for example, have the power to undo much of the damage done to a free press by the Supreme Court's decision restricting a reporter's right to protect the con­fidentiality of his sources. Nor does Congress have to pass the Administration's so-called Whitehead Bill, which would set local stations to do the censor's work on network news broadcasts. And it is by no means clear that the courts ultimately will tolerate the government's novel in­terpretation of the espionage statutes, amounting to establishment of an official secrets act. under which Dan Ellsberg and Anthony Russo are being tried in the Pen­tagon Papers Case. 
But one thing is perfectly clear about 
these developments, as well as the Ad­
ministration's attempted prior restraint on 
publication of the Pentagon Papers, and the 
\'arious strictures on the press periodically 
voiced by Nixon and Vice President Agnew. 
It is that they have planted the fear of 
retribution in any number of publishers, 
editors and broadcasters. 
It is precisely that fear that underlies the 
plan !"or a private press council; the basic 
idea. however sugar-coated, is to clean up 
the press before the government comes in to 
do the job. That, not so incidentally, is what 
such friend:, of the press as Herbert Klein 
and Pat Buchanan are forever urging the 
press to do. 
Thus. much of the press is now moving-­
through the press council idea--toward 
precisely the self-cen::.orship that, in all 
probability. the Administration has been 
hoping for all along. This is not to argue that 
there is anything wrong with self-scrutiny 
and a sensible effort to correct errors and 
maintain a scrupulous fairness. The danger

Raises $22.8 million 
McGovern. campaign 

sets De1no record 
(C) 1973 New York Times 
Washington. Feb. 1---Sen. George McGovern's campaign against President Nixon raised 
$22.8 million, a record figure for Democratic nominees, and came close to matching his expenses, according to the official year-end report of "McGovern for President, Inc.," made public today. 
ln comparison with anything but the Nixom Campaign Treasury of about $50 million, the McGovern war chest was large. But the South Dakota Senator ran to the worst defeat ever suffered by a Democrat. 
The McGovern funds were slightly more than Nixon had when he first won the Presidency. And they were half again more than Se. Hubert H. Humphrey raised for the losing Democratic campaign in 1968. 
The $22.8 million figure from the principal McGovern Finance Committee covered the nearly four months of campaigning after the Democratic Convention in July of 1972. ln addition, campaign spokesmen said today, McGovern had raised nearly $2 million bet­ween early April, when new Federal campaign disclosure laws took effect, and the convention. 
McGovern for President, Inc. reported a net deficit of about $3~9.000 at the end of last December. But according to Marian Pearlman, the campaign treasurer, many of the debts---both bills for services and campaign loans--had been discounted or forgiven. Through further set­tlements, she said, the deficit "will all be wiped out in another month." 
Meanwhile, Maurice Stans, Chairman of President Nixon's fund raising effort, said that the total surplus in the President's several re-election committees is about $4.8 million. No dectsion has been made, he said, on disposing of the excess. 

is in institutionalizing that self-scrutiny in a press council or any other such instrument. 
For one vital thing, that would concede the point that such a watchdog body is needed--when the fact is that the American Pre~s does n~t really need self-censorship, particularly m reporting on the govern­me~t. u.needs instead, a vigorous new spirit of mqUiry, a bold new determination to make its commitment to truth as it can be perceived, rather than to any Ad­ministration, any ideology or any govern­ment-defined statement of the national 
interest. The Pre~s Council idea presupposes, for another thmg, that the council itself will be altogether objective and unbiased (even as some suppose the press itself should be) when no one can be. As Wes Gallagher of th~ Assoc~ate.d Press has pointed out, the press counctl wlll be as subject to partisanship as any other group . It is well-known, for one example, that numerous responsible, honorable and fair­minded per"flns disagreed with the Time's decisio.n to ;··Jblish the Pentagon Papers. That ~1d not make them right. It is entirely concetvable that a press council numering such men or women among its members could have either condemned that publication, or at least issued a divided re~ort. That would have had great public wetght. Can the American Press, with its constitutional responsibilities, really coo~erate in su~h a potential limitation upon Its nght to pubhsh, and upon its willingness to do so fearlessly and powerfully? Apparently much of it can; and so the likelihood is that once the council is esta?lished and issuing its reports, editors, pubh~hers and broadcasters will begin to seek tts favor--at least to avoid its disfavor w.hich might produce that of the public: Smce no one can say in advance precisely 
what the dominant influences and prevailing attitudes of such a council will be. the process of pleasing it or not 
distressing it could become a dangerous form of self-censorship. 
That the Press Council would aim to keep the press "free" by making it more "responsible" is a contradiction in terms. If the press is truly free, it follows that it will not always be "responsible·'; and anything that tends to enforce its "responsibility" necessarily makes it less than free.

A good case 
t 
When Acting Vice President of Student Affairs Philip Faccenda decides to set the 
[ 
record straight there are no words minced. Last night's press conference was an excellent example. 
Faccenda came in with his case meticulously prepared. He had the total enrollment and off-campus housing figures from the last six years on a chart. He had the statistical procedure used to arrive at the prediction down cold. A careful check of both the procedure and the conclusion won't turn up a flaw. In short, he made a good case. 
r 
r The fact that he was concerned enough 
, 
to set up a press conference at the con­venience of both The Observer and WSND and had several other members of his central staff available to answerf 
r questions shows that he believes the 
~ problem of forcing students off campus 
r h'~s ~een overstated anti needs 
r c ,a rifica tion. 
r r What Went Wrong
r 
r 
The Vice President traced most of the current difficulty to an "administrative~ error" last year which resulted in 350 missing beds. The error was essentially~ guaranteeing on-campus housing to every student who wanted it. The error was made by Fr,. Thomas Chambers, who
t is no longer with us in an administrative capacity. 
If Faccenda is right that only 100 students will be forced off campus, and he probably is, then it is possible that the whole process could be pulled off without any bloodshed. There is some real flexibility between guaranteeing students on-campus housing and forcing them to move off. That flexibility is embodied in the market for on-campus beds.

During the last four years university officials have not encouraged moving off campus, to say the least. This is un­derstandable. They dropped three quarters of a million dollars in 1969 making dormitory renovations and wanted to recoup the investment. In addition, the opening of Flanner and Grace resulted in a net increase of 600 on­campus rooms (500 rooms were con­verted to lounges and suites in 1969). 
How to Fix It 

These developments have unquestionably increased the demand for on-campus housing. Coupled with the nearly complete elimination of dormitory regulations, it's not hard to see how the last few years have greatly enhanced the desireability of dorm life. 
So how do you get 100 extra people to move off campus? Do a similar number on off-campus housing. That doesn't mean dropping $750,000 into an off­campus apartment building---we are working at the margin, not on the average. All it means is to offer sufficient encouragement to move off campus that 100 extra people will be inclined to do so. 
This isn't as hard as it appears. Preparing and distributing a com­prehensive directory of available off­campus housing (including price in­formation), lending university support to the formation of a tenents' union (in­cluding legal aid) and setting up few other amenities of the same type should do the trick. 
After all about 65 students have been enticed to move off campus this year without doing anything but offering to return the $50.00 room deposit.

lefty rusc:hmann 
Most Notre Dame students don't need much of a stimulus <or lack of suchl to get a good night's sleep, either in the dorms (ask the maids about thatl or in the classroom (ask the profs about that). But there is usually one guy in every section <two, if he has a roommate) who suffers from insomnia because he worries about the weightier questions of Life. · 
These inquisitive souls come in several varieties. There are the Philosopher Kings who grapple with such questions as: "Is the Cosmic Awl the world's largest ice pick?" or "Does the fact that essence precedes existence in the dictionary necessarily render all of Existentialism false?" Then there are the Empiricists, whowonder about mundane matters such as "What do they call baseball-sized hailstones in countries where they don't play baseball?" 
And then there's a third category of thinkers, guys who worry about the more earthy issues facing the campus. One or two of this group, believe it or not, do· not aspire to high campus office, but politico and non-politico alike, all are needlessly losing shuteye wondering about a question whose answer is painfully obvious. 
The burning question of the hour is: "How many females will the Dome eventually see fit to allow into the ND student body?" The folks on high hint at some four-digit number less than 2,000-depending on how they define their terms and juggle residence halls. 
2,000 women? No way the Dome will admit that many; the eventual number will be roughly half that figure because (a) Notre Dame and an equal male-female ratio are as compatible as Nature and the proverbial vacuum and <bl besides, in the first place, men out­number the women in America by about 3 to 1. 
And, using that Dynamic Duo.of Absolute Truth, namely statistics and logic, I can prove it. Nobody dares call my evidence into queston, since it is provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. <The logic is mine.) 
Below, astute readers <and a few slowpokes who move their lips as they read l will read for each age group the percentage of men not married, the percentage of women not married, and the male-female ratio for that age group. 
Age  per cent Men Unmarried  Women Unmarried  l{atio  
14  !19.9  !19.9  I to I  
17  !18.7  !19.4  1.1  to I  
19  55.0  27.5  2.0 to 1  
21  :!3.2  1-1.2  2.5 to I  

(Note: the above information assumes that equal numbers of each sex are born, that married people are excluded from the figures for fear of encouraging philandering, and that figures, of course, never lie.l 
Extrapolating the given information, one can readily see that by age 50, the ratio increases to about 4 to 1, or close to that at ND-SMC. Moreover, taking it on faith that these are "the best years of our lives," one would logically expect life to get worse after age 21 <i.e., the ratio will deteriorate). Simple enough. 
Life, in its diversity and complexity, abounds with proof of this daring assertion. You can prove it for youself: walk through most any downtown area, count the crowds at ball parks, study the faces in the bars. go wherever large crowds congregate, and the preponderance of nwn is evident. 
What caused this phenomenon? Scientists are divided on this matter. although the majority opinion suggests that the large female mortality rate resulting from the tear-jerking rock lyrics of the 50's, plus the debilitating effects of new "fad" diets, has caused the female X chromosome to have become recessive. 
Bathed in the glowing brilliance of this discovery, old problems are seen in a new light, one which obscures the lousiness of this metaphor. I<'or instance, America's staggering divorce rate is quite in the face of a -t to 1 ratio gnawing at the grand old institution of marriage. And what about the alleged deterioration of the American family unit? 
Small wonder the family hasn't appeared on the endangered-species list. considering the circumstances. And, as a result of the decline of the family. a whole raft of modern-day social ills can be explained away: drugs, alcoholism, crime, insipid sex-oriented commercials, the proliferation of gradeD skin mags, NHL over-expansion, etc. 
Women aren't immune from this phenomenon, even though they enjoy increased selectivity, being in the minority. <Remember "scarce goods" from Econ. 223?) And, since women are a minority, their crusade for political power through the democratic process is doomed. For women to gain political power, they must become economically powerful, and there are only two ways of pulling it off: to expioit others or to be exploited. 
The workings of the Great Ratio also present a number of rn~r.ur hassles. such as the collapse of the economy, the ineviti!!:Jiiity of large­scale war and the end of humanity due to th~ absence of women of 1:hildbearing age, <one-third of the population of this generation, one­ninth of the next generation, and so on). But column space runs short, the hour is late and the night staff wants to put this issue to bed. 
So while the insomniac philosophers suffer through their newest question: "Where are the girls?" I'll be getting a good night's sleep so I ran prove tomorrow (with stats and logic) that the 76ers are better than the Lakers, that Rhode Island is larger than Texas, that three of the four seasons in South Bend are called "summer," and that num­bers always speak the truth.

I'd like to say a few words about

am totally in favor of the girls

the services of such a specialist if 
the need arises. Their enthusiasm 
in appealing to Fr. Shilts reflects 
the enthusiasm shown by the 
typical minority group.

most certainly applies here.

Editor: He: Don Ruane's column on Notre Dame fans. 
You confuse us. Much of your 
article was contradictory. Ap­
proximately half of your column 
was off the subject of the fans, and 
since you opened the case, we'd 
like to respond to a few of your 
eomments. 
We don· t condone the fans 
throwing things; but you 
l'X aggerated a bit. We take oi­fense to your judgment of the Notre Dame team on seeing them once. You also say, "I'm not that txcited about Notre Dame sports anymore." although you like to see txceptional performances, etc. Do ~ ou call SR turday's farce an ex­ceptional IJCrformance? The ref's performance was clearly ex­ceptional ... exceptionally bad. And th!' calls were not nearly missed hoth ways. The refs seemed to be ahiP to consistently lose their whistles when UCLA committed 
obvious v1clations. The fouling was tremendous on both sides. The thing that made a difference was the little things, the walk here, som(thing else there, that the refs always seemed to ignore. 
We seriously wonder whether or not you were watching the game during the Hollyfield incident. Did you see that first elbow? I don't know how he feels, but I hope Pete Crotty didn't read your article. Hollyfield's action was the. "bushest." we have ever seen

In case you had your eyes open 
for the incident where the ref fell, 
we have it from the most reliable

If UCLA deserved praises, we'd

Uni.on response 
Editor: 

In your Jan. 29 issue you invited 
responses to the question fo a 
faculty union, and I wish to report 
that I "mildly approve" 
unionization of the NO faculty. Most of the arguments I have heard against unions stem from the middle class fear of losing status, of "descen­ding" from the white collar status to the blue collar; Prof. Goerner's article seems to me at base a highly rhetorical version of this, except that he seems to fear Joss of a Homan collar status. Frankly, if I wanted to be some kind of "priest. a mediator between God, under the divine name of truth, and man." I'd get me to a seminary and become ordained; why go second class? I am interested in learning more about my subject and talking to people about it, not in being a priest or saint or martyr or Christian witness; and I am interested in whatever a union might do to create good working conditions for such an enterprise, 
I . like Prof. Goerner, haven't been particularly interested in money --until recently. Now that I find I have to start sending my five children to college, I will have to teach summers (summers when i cc:.:!d ~pend my time reading, learning. and writliig) for a long time to come. Many universities will pay the full tuition for faculty children; Notre Dame pays $1,000 toward it--not bad, but it could be better. Most good universities have regular sabbatical leaves every seven years whereby each teacher gets a year or a semester off at university expense in order to write or learn more; I would like this and. follwing the reasonable assumption that the leisure to think would improve my teaching, I think that my students would benefit from it too. Most good 
universities have standard 
teaching loads of nine or six hours 
(:~ or 2 courses). Last year the 
administration told us we were to 
tt>ach twelve hours (4 courses); 
this year I am teaching one more 
course than I have for the past four 
or five vears. It is obvious to me 
(though I hope not too obvious to 
my students> that the more 
courses I teach the less time I have 
to spend on each course; the 
quality of my teaching 
deteriorates subtly. 

The three matters I have raised 
l'Oncern. not sordid matters of 
money, but working conditionsand 
the resulting quality of my 
teaching; if a union could improve 
things. then I favor it. 
Yours.

The war 

Leanne Jacques' letter of 
Jal)uary 30 was correct in all but 
one aspect. There never was, is 
not. and never will be any reason to 
be thankfuL any any sense of that 
word. for the bombing of Hanoi. 

What was done in our name last 
December will forever be cursed. 
There is no fundamental dif­
ference between the murderers at 
Dachau thirty years ago and the 
murders over Hanoi during 
Christmas. 1972. Does it matter if 
the civilian you kill is a Jew or a 
Vietnamese? If there is a dif­
ference between Dachau, 1942, and 
Hanoi. 1972, it is this: w e knew 
what the Nazis did was evil, that it 
was wrong to kill civilians merely 
because you didn't like them or 
their government. Yet we did 
t>ssentiallv the same thing. 

It is said that those who eriticize 
America are blind to what the Viet Cong have done. The Viet Cong have done a lot of atrocious things . themselves. But does hat make it right for us to do the same--murder the innocent? It's awful that it's even conceivable to compare our bombing of civilians with the atrocities of the Nazis and ihe Viei 
Cong. That's pretty sick company 
to be among. 

On the same topic James Dickey 
once wrote a poem, "The Fire­
bombing." He prefaceed with the 
lines. "Denke daran, dass nach 
den grossen AZerstoerungen­
.Jederman beweisen wird, dass er 
unschuldig war." (After the great 
destruction all will prove their 
innocence.) How true. 

No. it would be perverse to thank 
those who bombed Hanoi, even for 
a second. If there were truly in­
nocent . people in this war, the 
.:;impie ·wufkt=i;; of Hanoi were 
among them. But they paid iof 
their innocence. And no doubt we will pay, somehow, for their murder. 
Peace.

abortion 
Editor: 
In Thursday's (January 25) 
Observer I read with some dismay 
Carole Moore's comment on the 
Supreme Court's abortion ruling. 
Said Miss Moore: "It's about 
time ... The emphasis should be 
shifted from whether or not 
abortion constitutes murder to 
consider what the quality of life 
will be for that fetus." 
By itself. such a statement is 
nothing more than a reflection of 
unthinking humanitarianism: 
unwanted children born into 
broken homes and abject poverty 
face a life devoid of all joy and 
hope. Perhaps so. But is not the 
cure worse than the illness? When 
killing l'or convenience is thus 
legitimized where will it stop? 
After the nameless fetus, perhaps 
\H' can get rid of Grandpa (he's 
getting senile and can't work in the 
garden anymore>; or that little 
retarded boy on the corner (he.ll 
never be a lawyer, you know>; or 
how about that poor brunette 
(after all. blondes do have more 
fun l; and maybe even a Jew or two 
(they don't bleed or have feelings so I'm told l. 
Miss Moore's statement would not merit a serious second thought \\'ere it not for the fact tht she is a faculty members. While it may be an exaggeration to call Notre Dame "Catholic," the University can still lay claim to being "Christian" in a broad sense, which. of course. includes a respect for the sanctity of human life and at least a tacit recognition of the Commandments of God. Facultv members who cannot accept even so minimal a Christianity make a mockery of Notre Dame. 
To compund matters, I am told that Miss Moor specializes in medieval history. Accordingly she 

of all people should realize the. vital role that morality and religion play in the social order. Medieval man recongnized a hierarchy of being that transcended mere human convenience or "quality of life" (Whatever that meansl. It would seem that the Middle Ages, for all their so-called darkness. were not nearly so barbarian as our own t>nlightened. liberated time, freed as it is from the rigors of serious thinking.

Washington, Feb. !-President Nixon raised and spent more money in his re-election race than any other candidate in history, official rilings show. 
At least $35.2 million passed through the Finance Committee to He-elect the President, according to its summary report, and reports of other fund-raising arms are expected to push the final Nixon total past $50 million. .

According to Marget, the idea is financially feasible. Marget has predicted a surplus of almost 15 hundred dollars in this year's student government budget. The idea must be approved, however, by both Fr. Wilson, VicePresident for Business Affairs, and Brother Kieran Ryan, Asst. Vice-President of the Business Office. Roe stated that approval must also be sought from the campus Environment Committee headed by Prof. Frederick Beckman.

YAF forms new ND-SMC chapter 
by Jim Lindsay 
Staff Reporter 
A new chapter of Young Americans for Freedom, the nation's largest conservative ~·outh organization, is being for­nwd at Notre Dame to make ND­SMC students more aware of the "l'onservative alternative," said l'hapter chairman Edward N:tvarro yesterday. 
According to Navarro, "YAF is not a political party in itself, nor is it an appendage of the Republican party. Ha ther. Y AF is trying to hridge the present gap between parties by awakening the American public to the merits of conservatism.'' 
Navarro. a junior government major, pointed out that YAF dtnounces fascism, racism, ~ocialism. and communism. The organization's "credo", the Sharon statement. declares that the forces of international communism are the greatest single threat to American liberties. and the "the United States should stress victory over, rather than coexistence with, this menance." 

A native or Cuba, chapter head Navarro brings a special personal interest to his post. Having spent the rirst ten years of his life in Cuba, four of which were under the Castro regime. he sees Americans as being "terribly unaware of the effects of a communist or any other form of totalitarian state." 
Y AF particularly lists as one of its goals the improvement of life on the American college campus. A Y AF promotional brochure speaks or the organization's desire for "presenting a responsible campus approach to resolving the teal problems of our universities and to restoring sanity through curriculum reform, legal action programs. majority coalitions, student government participation, independent newspapers, responsible academic freedom, and voluntary student activity fees." 
Amtrak releases 
first public report 
by Stephen M. Aug 
(C) 1973 Washington Star-News 
Washington. Feb. /--Amtrak today outlined publicly for the first time the extent of some of its problems trying to operate a nationwide rail passenger service hy contract with a dozen rail systems. 
In its annual report to the President and Congress, Amtrak-­officially the National Railroad Passenger Corp.-cited difficulties forcing railroads to operate trains on time. preventing overcharges hy the railroads and collecting damages for railroad-caused accidents. 
The difficulties--which probably represent only a small percentage of actual incidents in which Am­trak and the railroads find themselves at odds--are outlined in a section of the annual report dealing with arbitrations. 
Amtrak also reported that during its first year and a half of operations it had accumulated a ddicit of $239 million. It noted that revenues for the last six months of 1972 were up 12.6 per cent from the samP period of 1971 "indicating that the historical decline in railroad passenger ridership has lwen reversed." 
Among its accomplishments, Amtrak listed the fact that by ~·ear's end 603 passenger cars had lwen refurbished: now advanced passenger-train cars and engines have been ordered for service next summer: ridership was up 10.4 per cent and it is now possible to buy tickets using any of six national lTedit cards. 

At the same time the company said it had received 8,506 letters from customers, more than 3,000 of which were requests for in­
formation.  but  more  than  1,400  
critical of Amtrak service.  The  
most  frequent  complaints  were  

with reservations (11.9 per cent) 
and rude personnel 01.1 per cent). 
Under the federal law that created Amtrak, the corporation and the railroads which operate its trains under contract submit disputes to binding arbitration. 
The reports on arbitrations disclose that Amtrak -has been having difficulty forcing some railroads to maintain the operating speeds to which they agreed. 
In one case. Amtrak accused the bankrupt Penn Central Tran­sportation Co. of reducing the average speed on its line between Indianapolis. Ind., and Kankakee, Ill .. to 33 miles an hour from the previous 52 miles an hour. As a result. the 139-mile trip now takes three hours and 50 minutes instead of the previous two hours and 41 minutes. 
The railroad. Amtrak says, had violated its contract "by failing to maintain its rail lines" between Indianapolis and Kankakee. 
In autumn 1971, Amtrak says, its Chicago-Florida train began to experience such delays on the same Penn Central line between Chicago and Louisville that it rarely made its connection in Jacksonville, Fla. 
When Amtrak asked Penn I Central to restore the level of track to what had existed prior to May 1, 1971, the railroad replied that Amtrak must pay $2.7 million to improve the line.

Prof Bishop discusses Indian caste systeiD 
Professor James Bishop, Associate Professor of History at Manchester University, spoke on the "Political and Changing Aspects of the Indian Caste S~·stem." last night in Carrol Auditorium at St. Mary's College. 
Bishop pointed out that since democracy has come to India the caste system has become a part of the political system. This is a result of the necessity for politicians to appease the larger lower castes in order to stay in office. 
Bishop also attacked the American belief that the caste system is unflexible. He explained thet ranking is dependent on what people think of you. There is no personal movement up or down hut. a whole group or Jati may move up or down in the system. This is happening often today because many pP.ople are becoming educated and want a social position suitable to their intelligence. 

Bishop said that the view that most Americans hold of India are at least 50 years behind the times. He blames this on the news media and authors who have covered events in India. 
Professor Bishop was a Fulbright Scholar in India from 
1966 to 1967.

Crotty 
by Lefty Ruschmann 
Strong rebounding and tough defensive play by Notre Dame's basketball team overcame a 30­point performance by All-America candidate Tom Inglesby as the Irish staged a second-half rally to upend Villanova University, 82-66, last night at the Palestra in Philadelphia. The win snapped a three-game Irish losing streak. 
John Shumate led the way for the Notre Dame with 23 points, 15 of them in the second half, and also controlled the boards at both ends of the court. "Big Shue" received ample help up front from Pete Crotty. who amassed a season high of 18 points. and by Gary Novak, whose rebounding and outlet passes set up several second-half breakaway goals. 
The fine outside shooting of Inglesby and Ed Hastings kept the 'Cats even with the Irish for most of the game but the Villanova forecourt could not cope with a taller and stronger Notre Dame !'ront line. as three 'Cat players fouled out of the physical. foul­filled contest. 
After Novak's jump shot put Notre Dame ahead, 2-0, both clubs settled down to a seesaw battle marked by numerous ties and lead changes in the early ping. Villanova. paced by the perimeter shooting of Hastings and Inglesby, hit on its first four shots while Crotty scored six of his squad's first ten points. 
Neither team led by more than three until halfway into the opening period. After Crotty's goal put the Irish in front, 17-16, the Wildcats rolled off eight con­secutive points on buckets by Jim Rurang and Inglesby, Bob Sebastian's layup and Mike Stack's fast-break basket to pull ahead. 24-17. 
The Irish. bothered by the Villanova zone. went scoreless for nearly five minutes until Shumate 
Cagers face Xavier Saturday in ACC 
by Vic Dorr If comparative scores meant anything, the Fighting Irish basketball team would be in a very 
secure  position  on  Saturday  af­ 
ternoon.  
The  Irish  entertain  the  

1\Iusketeers of Xavier University in a 2 pm home game on Saturday, and a comparison of the 2 teams' performances against a mutual opponent -the Dayton Flyers ­clearly favors coach Digger Phelps squad. 
Xavier played Dayton nearly a month ago, and despite a home­tourt advantage the Musketeers suffered a 98-82 drubbing at the hands of their cross-state rivals. Notre Dame met Dayton 2 weeks ago in the ACC. and this time the Irish won by a big score -they pounded the Flyers, 94-58. 
But comparative scores have never been reliable. and the ND cagers won't be favored by 52 points when the two teams meet tomorrow in the ACC. The Irish will simply be hoping for a win, and they will be hoping againstll a 
Xavier club that is returning some high-class talent from last year's 12-14 campaign. The 1971-72 season was Xavier's etghth non­winning year in a row, but the Musketeers came within points of several big upsets. 
They lost to Dayton by 3, 69-66, before bouncing back to dump the flyers later in the year. They lost to Villanova and Duquesne by t-ight. to Detroit by four, and to Marquette-in the second meeting of the season -by eight. The Musketeers closed their 71-72 campaign by winning 3 of their last four_ outings. 
-

D . Shue do it to Villanova 
I broke the ice with two free throws and Brokaw sank a jumper, making the score 24-21. 
Tom Inglesby stretched the home club's lead to 30-21, its largest of the night, tossing in two goals after taking advantage of Irish defensive lapses. But Notre Dame. shuffling front-line per­sonnel and switching to a full-court press. closed to 32-29 at the half on lay-ups by Shumate and Brokaw. 
Opening second-half action, Crotty and Shumate tallied to give the Irish the lead at 33-32. Thereupon both teams again began to exchange baskets, improving upon their first-half shooting <ND :l3 percent, Villanova 32), with Shumate hitting repeatedly from the baseline. Don Silinski chipped in all of his five points within the span of two minutes. his short jump shot and foul shot giving the Irish a 46-44 lead which they never relinquished. 
Following a Sebastian free throw, the Irish front line triggered a run of seven points with two Shumate baskets. Dwight Clay's baseline shot and a Crotty free shot to make it 53-44. Meanwhile, Villanova encountered difficulty with the Irish defense and was unable to muster .a comeback. 
With five minutes remaining, layups by Clay and Shumate hiked the Irish advantage to 63-53, for­l'ing the 'Cats into a press in hopes or rattling the visitors. But Novak's score-producing outlet passes thwarted the Wildcats, who resorted to fouling for possession. The strategy failed as the Irish eooly converted virtually all their charity tosses to build up their t-ventual victory margin. 
The Irish face four home games in the next eight days, hosting Xavier <0. l Saturday afternoon, Butler on Monday night, Michigan State on Wednesday night. and La Salle next Saturday afternoon. l\:otre Dame has posted a 4-3 record this year in the ACC. 

Xavier's hopes in their clash \\'ith the Irish lie largely with a pair of experienced seniors. Center Bob Fullarton, a li-10, 225­pounder. led the Musketeers in scoring last year with a 14.8 average, and finished the season as the nation's second-leading percentage shooter. Com­plementing Fullarton is 6-6 for­\\'ard Conny Waren, also back for his final year. Warren was the team's leading rebounder in 'i1 -­pulling down nearly 11 'bounds per 
game  - and  also  posted  a  9.6  
scoring averag e.  
Coach  Dick  Campbell's  other  

three starters graduated last spring. hut a rising sophomore and a pair of transfer-students should more than make up for their departure. The sophomore is Pete Accetta. a 6-6 forward, who led the \\I usketeer freshmen in both scoring (J8.5ppgl and rebounding last year.
