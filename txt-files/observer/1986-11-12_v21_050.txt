HPChears senate resolution 
By REGIS COCCIA 
Assistant News Editor 
A Student Senate proposal calling for divestment of the University's holdings in South Africa was one of the topics dis­cussed at Tuesday night's Hall Presidents' Council meeting. 
Student Senator John Gar­diner reported on the Senate's vote on a resolution to impose a deadline for University di­vestment. According to Gar­diner, ·'the close margin of the vote shows how sensitive an issue it is." "I think a lot of students want divestment," Gardiner added. 
··According to the referen­dum held in March, 60 percent of the students who had an opinion on divestment wanted the University to divest," said Gardiner. Responding to a question regarding the Univer­sity's involvement, Gardiner said: "I think that Notre Dame's investment in South Africa is about 9 percent of the endowment, about 33 million dollars." Gardiner said the movie "Wit­ness to Apartheid" will be shown at the CSC Wednesday at 7:30P.M. and a candlelight vigil will be held Thursday night at 7:30 at the War Memorial. Also, there will be a rally"Vigil on Friday at 12: 15 
P.M. at the CCE <where the Board of Trustees will meet). 
Dan Van Haitsma of the Aca­demic Commission of Student Government addressed the council regarding the Faculty Course Evaluation, a comput­erized listing of course instruc­tor ratings.

SMC Programming Board' responds to surveys 

By KAREN WEBB · copy editor 
Responses on the success of student government awareness surveys given to students Tues­day night in Saint Mary's dining hall were presented at Saint Mary's Programming Board meeting Tuesday night. 
"The questions were good, but dinner time's not a good time to do it," said Vice Pres­ident of McCandless Lisa Montpetit. 
"People usually object to surveys because it's an inva­sion of privacy," said Calendar Commissioner Mary Carol Cahill, also suggesting the sur­vey, which was given orally, should have been presented beforehand by R.A.'s or through campus mail. 
"Freshmen had no clue," said Athletic Commissioner Kim Drahota. "They didn't know positions, offices, anyth­ing." 

Results of the survey will be compiled and presented at a fu­ture Programming Board meeting. 
In other business, Mary Ger­ber, Director of Special Pro­grams at Saint Mary's, con-· suited with the Board on future dates and events for the cul­tural arts calender. 
Suggestions made by board members for upcoming events were a jazz music concert, a ballet, and also a play, based on the past success of the broadway play Evita shown at O'Laughlin Auditorium Nov. 2. 
After trying unsuccessfully to coordinate dates of cultural arts events with dates of stu­dent government sponsored events, Sarah Cook, vice pres­ident for student affairs, brought up the idea of forming student committees based on a list of volunteers made at stu­dent orientation at the begin­ning of the semester. 
Woman sentenced for Hurley mishap 
By MARK PANKOWSKI 
News Editor 

The South Bend woman who plead guilty to leaving the scene of the accident involving Kevin Hurley was sentenced Tuesday in St. Joseph County Superior Court, her attorney said. 
Mary Beth Gallivan, 24, was fined $1,000 and ordered to spend Sundays in the county jail for three months, attorney Victor McFadden said. 
In addition, Judge Jerome Frese placed Gallivan on four years' probation and suspended her driver's license for the same period of time, McFadden said. Frese also or­dered Gallivan to work eight hours per week at the Northern Indiana State Hospital during her probationary term. 
Gallivan had pleaded guilty on Sept. 17 to leaving the scene of an accident involving a serious bodily injury, a Class D felony. The charge carries with it a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. 
"I thought (Frese's) sentenc­ing was at least fair, and pos­sibly much more understand­ingly made than many sentences I've seen over the years," McFadden said. 
Hurley, an 18-year-old Howard Hall freshman at the time, suffered a crushed right leg, a bruised lung and numerous abdominal and head injuries in the accident. 
His right leg was amputated below the knee, and he remained in a coma for three months. Returning to Notre Dame this past weekend, Hur­ley said he has been undergoing rehabilitation since December, 1986, and is now attending classes at a private school. 
During Tuesday's sentenc­ing, Hurley's parents spoke for approximately 1 l;2 hours about their son's injuries, McFadden said. "It was a sad thing," he said. "(Mrs. Hurley) talked of his survival as being miraculous." 
McFadden said the family's attorney, Robert Canty, also spoke at the hearing. 
"He essentially asked that Gallivan be required to work with people with serious injur­ies, particularly head injuries with disabling results," said McFadden. 
Frese followed that recom­mendation by ordering Gal­livan to work specifically with those with mental disabilities, McFadden said. 
"It was a tough decision for him to make," McFadden said. "There was no way to com­pensate the family for their grief and expenses . . . " 
At her Sept. 17 plea hearing, Gallivan testified that she was driving north on U.S. 33 at about 2:30 a.m. Sept 7, 1985, when she hit something that caused her windshield to break. Gallivan said she didn't stop even after the passenger in her car mentioned she might have hit someone. 
Both turned themselves in to the St. Joseph County police about 12 hours after the acci­dent. Her companion was not charged in the accident. 
During her testimony, Gal­livan admitted to drinking 1 l;2 beers before driving, but said she was sober at the time of the accident. 

ND students create investment group 
By SEAN HICKEY News Staff 
Seven Notre Dame entrepreneurs have initiated an investment group, accor­ding to Sam Siewert, a soph­omore who is credited with the brainstorming idea. 
Unlike the Morrissey Loan Fund, which is simply a stu­dent service that loans out money, the investment group is a partnership, according to Siewert. 
"It is a partnership invest­ment group ... separate from the university," said Siewert. "Basically what we offer over other investment groups is a far smaller personal fee which would ordinarily stop the small-time investors from investing," he said. 
Siewert said there were two 
reasons for setting up the in­
vestment group. "It's a 
chance to make money!" 
More importantly, however, Siewert said "it is a chance for students who are inter­ested in investing to brainstorm, get involved, and share experiences." 

Siewert said his original idea was spurred on by an entrepreneurial contest cur­rently being held at Notre Dame. "I talked to random stu-dents about my idea and found that there was intense interest," he said. 
"An investment group works by drawing up a detailed partnership contract stating how the money will be handled, i.e. I.R.S. involve­ment, pooling initial re­sources of the group together to serve as a base, and then investing clients' money through a broker. The amount of profit or net profit at the end of cycle is determined by subtracting the brokerage fees and the service manage­ment fees from the gross profit," he said. 
The legalities of forming an actual business seem compl­icated, but Siewert said "It is legal." 
After consulting a lawyer, Siewert said the contract "is currently being discussed and written up in detail." 
According to Siewert, some of these fine points include discussing how money will be handled and how profits, fees, and dividends will be divided. "The brokerage fees will be much less," added Siewert, and "divided proportionally to the amount of money in­vested by individuals" while management fees levied on individual profits "will cover the cost of running the group." 
Siewert said the group decided on becoming a part­nership because a corporation has virtually limitless legalities. In addition, he said

"Senate Censures Use Of K-9 Police To Stop Panty-Raids," the headline read. 
No wayyyyyy, I said. 
But there it was, right on the front page of The Observer's April20, 1967 tssue: South Bend and St. Joseph County police had used dogs and tear gas to break up the annual panty raid. 
According to the article, the Notre Dame Stu­dent Senate reacted by passing a resolution con­demning the use of "K-9 dogs and tear-gas bombs as weapons against a harmless demonstration." 
During the meeting, Student Body President Jim Fish said about 1,500 students participated in the panty raid on the Saint Mary's campus. Fish said he had gone to the police right after the disturbance ended. 
"I was standing talking to one of the policeman when one of those mongrels lunged at me," Fish was quoted as saying. "I never saw such a big grin and bright eyes as I did on that mut. I ran for the nearest tree." 
Because of their capture and subsequent iden­tification during the panty raid, eight students received punishments ranging from indefinite probation to expulsion from their dorms, the article said. 
One student said he was apprehended while returning to Notre Dame. "A cop came up and said to get into the car. I wasn't too willing to get in," he said. "I started to run, but I stopped when he said, 'Stop or I'll shoot!' " 
The disciplinary action came as the result of the first of two panty raids on Saint Mary's that week. The first raid began after a shouting match bPtween residents of Cavanaugh and Breen-Phillips halls. Firecrackers, cherry_ bombs and shouting attracted the attention of other halls' residents, the article said. 
Shouting "We want panties" and "Go Irish," the crowd moved from the quad to U.S. 31. There a sheriff's car had the crossroads blocked, The Observer reported. The students moved around the car and across the road to the threats of the police. 
Speaking on a public address system, one dep­uty told the students, "All right now, you guys, we'll give you one more chance to come back to your own side of the road before we set the dogs loose." The threat was met with jeers and dares, the article said. 
The police managed to move the crowd from

Police officers, arriving with billy clubs in hand, walked toward the students. The crowd then moved back to LeMans where they were met by police officers and their dogs, The Ob­server reported. 
Held on a short leash, the dogs were walked in the general direction of the students, who were eventually herded back to U.S. 31. 
Fish, speaking at the senate meeting, des­cribed the dogs as "150 to 200-pound monsters trained to mutilate whatever came within their reach, pulling along a 160-pound cop. 
"In one instance the back of a student's coat was shredded like spaghetti," he said. "If it had been a student rather than a coat that mon­ster had cattght, there would have been serious injury."

New minority director named 
Falwell to give lecture at ND 
By CHRIS SKORCZ Staff Reporter 

Dr. Jerry Falwell, outspoken leader of the Moral Majority, will speak Thursday night at 7 in Washington Hall. The title of his lecture, sponsored by the Student Activities Board, is "The Evangelical Vote: Is it Monolit­hie?" 
According to Steve Georgi of the SAB, Falwell will most likely use this lecture as an opportunity to discuss t~e issue of religious leaders, such as himself or televangelist Pat Robertson, running for public office. Falwell will dis­cuss the likelihood that such a religious leader can per­suade those sharing his faith to vote for him and effect a strong church-state relationship, Georgi said. 
Falwell comes to Notre Dame free of charge. Georgi said that the SAB extended approximately thirty invita­tions last spring to prominent individuals asking them to speak at Notre Dame as part of the SAB's Distinguished Lecturer Series.

Getting to know the students and helping them organize their goals is the first step toward solving the problems faced by many minority stu­dents at Notre Dame, accor­ding to Kenneth Durgans the new minority affairs director. 
Durgans replaced Edward Blackwell, who left Notre Dame last summer to take an advanced position at Colby Col­lege in Maine, according to Sr. Jean Lenz, assistant vice pres­ident of student affairs. 
As director of minority af­fairs, Durgans has several re­sponsibilities. 
"I will be involved in the ad­vising and recruitment of minority students, both under­graduate and graduate," said Durgans. "The bottom line is to help the various minority groups to fit in with the Notre Dame community and have

the group has applied for a tax number from the I.R.S., "as it will want in­formation on individuals in the group and in the future a list of 
names and the home addresses 
of investors." 
"The group is research inten­sive," Siewert said, "with an automation of portfolio." This means that there are computer programs which, for example, "determine undervalued stocks in industry according to their needs recognized." 

Durgans said he is still be­comming familiar with the sit­uation at Notre Dame, but he believes it is reflective of the situation of minorities in soci­ety at large. 
"Isolation is the biggest problem minorities face," said Durgans. "It is difficult for many minority students to maintain their cultural unique­ness and and at the same time fit in with everyone else." 
Durgans attributes such iso­lationism to the failure of minorities to be acknowledged and to have their needs recog­nized. He said his first goal is to help minority students un­derstand and organize their goals in order to achieve recognition. By getting to know the students on an organiza­tional level, Durgans said he hopes to help them deal with each other as well as the rest of the Notre Dame community. 
"I'm not setting any goals for 
financial equations," he said. "In other words, the risk is lim­ited" with the financial exper­tise of the computer. 
If a student wished to become an investor in the group, Siewert said he or she could take one of two courses. "If a student has a particular idea as to an investment opportu­nity, he-She would have to pres­ent the idea to the group," he said. 
Depending on how convinc­ing the student's presentation is, "the student's idea could be accepted or rejected by a vote of the board members," said Siewert. 
the students, I'm just helping them organize the goals they already have," said Durgans. 
As a result, Durgans said he hopes to see minority groups also doing more activities with each other as an effort to preserve their cultural unique­ness. 
Durgans graduated from Baldwin-Wall ace College in Berea, Oh. in 1977 with a degree in political science and history. In 1981 he earned a master's degree from Kent State Univer­sity, and in July of this year he received a master's degree in school counseling from the Uni­versity of Dayton. 
Prior to his arrival at Notre Dame, Durgans served at Wit­tenberg University and is a member of the American Col­lege Personnel Association, the American Association of Col­lege Admission Counsellors, and the Mid-American Associ­ation of Educational Opportu­nity Program Personnel. 
A student could also go to the group with money and ask for the group to invest it, he said. Then by careful consideration the gr~up would decide where the best sources of investment would be, "but the manage­ment fees would be greater," he added. 
The investment board con­sists of seven members: soph­omore Sam Siewert, managing partner; freshman Jeff Heilert, operating manager who calls the broker directly; and soph­omore Pat Zelton and fresh­man Nick Rossi, marketing managers who handle all ad­vertising and promoting.

Charity Ball for Ethiopia planned 
Correction 
LISA DAVISON 
News Staff 
To promote social and politi­cal awareness throughout the country, and specifically at Notre Dame, a Third Annual Notre Dame-Saint Mary's Charity Ball For Ethiopia is planned, according to Dan Har­rison, chairman of the ball. 
The first organizational meeting for the third annual ball in May is scheduled for Wednesday at 7 p.m. in the In­ternational Student Organiza­tion lounge in LaFortune, Harrison said. 
"The meeting is open to anyone who wants to get in­volved in committees," said Harrison. 
Harrison said the commit­tees are selected according to the person's individual inter­ests. "After Wednesday's meeting, we'll choose chair­people from each committee and they will be my working committee," he said. 

Discussing the upcoming ball, Harrison said, "This year I want to have as great a suc­cess as the past two years have been." 
According to Harrison, the first ball grossed $7,000 and the second ball netted $10,000. "The money goes to the Cath­olic Relief Fund and they dis­tribute it to the Ethiopia Fund. It goes to direct relief of the starving," Harrison said. 
"I believe you have to help people that do need help," Har­rison said. "At Notre Dame, we are growing, morally mature human beings and should be more aware of what we could do for other people." 
"The first year of the ball, it was estimated that 75 to 100 people were dying every hour,'' Harrison said. "To me, it .was just unfathomable that people were dying like that." 
"What we try to achieve is a positive outreach for everyone to become aware. It's positive, not negative. We want people to have a good time at the ball, but we also want them to think why they're there. The only negative aspect is that people that don't come are those who aren't aware." 
The Charity Ball is the cul­mination of an idea that Har­rison and Annemarie Finch had while driving back from break two years ago. "We were thinking how we could actually help people in need, actively as­sist those really in need," said Harrison. 
"Father David Porterfield is the faculty member who was most helpful. He's the guiding light. We needed a faculty member to help manifest our idea and he did," Harrison said. 
"The Administration is fan­tastic, a great help. The most fantastic support is Father Hesburgh. ·

-------------­
Women are now inspecting their po­sition in the Church, and many are not finding it to their liking. Women have never before thought to find fault with the male patriarchy of the Church or with the dPcisions that male body is passing on to its flock are now challeng­ing this, and more. 
In the forefront of this new movement of women stand several powerful fig­ures. Most irritating to the politic in Rome at this moment is the Chicago­based Sister of Notre Dame, Margaret Ellen Traxler. Although Traxler has been a nun for 45 of her 62 years, she was almost expelled from her order for her involvement with an advertisement that went out in the New York Times in October 1984. 
Along with 24 other nuns, she has been under Papal investigation since signing the ad, published under the title "A Diversity of Opinions Regarding Abortion Exists Among Roman Cat­holics." Sponsored by a small Washington-based group called "Catholics for Free Choice," the adver­tisement argued that there was more than one "legitimate Catholic position" on the issue of abortion and used as evidence the signature of 97 prominent Catholics. 

Traxler claims that the ad was for­mulated as "a partial response to the highly-publicized anti-abortion state­ments of Archbishop John J. O'Connor of the New York archdiocese, later elevated to cardinal. His comments, ac­cording to the views of many, were clearly aimed at the Vice-Presidential candidate of the time, Geraldine Fer­raro, a member of O'Connor's archdiocese who had come out in favor of pro-choice. 
Statistics show that only 11 percent of Catholics disapprove of abortion in all circumstances. "We tried to put it in the mildest possible tones," said 
Traxler of the ad. "We could have said 
89 percent of Catholics approve abor­tion under some circumstances." 
"(O'Connor's speech) was an at­tempt to rig the election on the basis of this one issue. So we called for some balance in the discussion," said Trax­ler. 
Also among those who had signed the document were two priests and two re­ligious brothers. When the prefect of the Vatican's Congregation on Religi­ous and Secular Institutes Archibishop Jean Jerome Hamer wrote to the offend­ing signers, asking for a recanting of the declaration, only the four gentlemen gave in. The 24 nuns in­volved wouldn't budge. Traxler said she did not believe that she could have done so (recanted) "under any circum­stances." 
Even Chicago Cardinal Joseph Ber­nardin acknowledged that "it was en­tirely possible that the offending nuns might have been expelled because they 'directly challenged the Church's con­stant teachings about the immorality of abortion."'

Marching Band gets credit for dedication 
Dear Editor: 
With all the hubbub lately about who the next Notre Dame president will be and whether the giant sprinkler on the Fieldhouse Mall should be razed or kowtowed to, there is one group on campus who is deprived of the recogni­tion and support it deserves: the Marching Band. 
I am a senior this year, and I think I can safely say that in my three years under the dome I have not seen more spirit (the lifeblood of Notre Dame) and dedication in any other group. But it's not just on Saturdays that the Band per­sonifies this spirit. It's every day when they march out to Green Field and monotonously rehearse the songs that echo their hard work and sound A­number-one on Saturdays. 
At the risk of sounding corny, I have Council of Churches and organizer of countless workshops and projects dealing with interracial justice. Her awards include medals from the State of Israel, Chicago Catholic Women and Saint Theresa's College in Winona, Min­nesota. She has been active in causes since her first march for equal rights in Selma, Alabama. 

Her main cause at the moment, however, is that of women in the Cath­olic Church. "(I) view Pope John Paul II as the misguided defender of a dying patriarchical system that represents neither the will of God nor the essense of the Catholic Church." Traxler con­siders herself representitive of two eras, caught between the old way of thinking and the new. 
Such a figure of strength is surely necessary in these turbulent times after the Second Vatican Council issued the historic statement urging religious wo­men to ease their old restrictions in or­der to capture the intentions of their founders, and in the process, to re­evaluate their calling and the form their calling took. While the 1965 state­ment seemed to many a recognition of the new importance and freedom that the sisterhood was taking, it led to a sharp division between the older, more conservative nuns and those usually younger, more liberal nuns who were delighted with this chance to merge in a small way with the secular life. 
Many women of both categories left the order as a result of this seemingly irreconcilable division. Between the year of the declaration's publication and 1984, some 62,000 nuns in the United States alone left the religious life. 
Traxler explains the massive exodus ~uite simply. "Most Catholic nuns were living in an unreal world," she says. She, sees a large part of the problem in the failure of the Church "to minister to all its people," by refusing to ordain women priests." 
Through her work with the prison sys­tem in Chicago, where she has aided female prisoners through their terms for many years, Traxler has decided in favor of the ordination of female priests. "Male prison chaplains," she explained," usually do not relate well to female inmates, and for that reason 
(I) would like to be ordained." 
While she seems to inspire contro­versy wherever she goes, Traxler's most publicized skirmish to date has been against the 1982 endorsement of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops for a Constitutional Amend­ment, proposed by Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, which would have allowed state legislatures to restrict or even ban abortions. Along with the Na­tional Coalition of American Nuns, which Traxler helped organize in 1969 and which is the first and only organi­zation of feminist sisters in the United States, Traxler condemned the Bis­hops' support statement. Issuing her own opinion on the Phil Donahue Show, she said that "the Catholic hierarchy would be better advised to educate men on the responsibilities of fatherhood." 
All this has been submitted as some­thing different for you to read and for you to form an opinion about. Yes, there was a time when women would simply go to church on the arms of their hus­bands or next to their fathers and not really think about their purpose there, not within the physical building but within the hierarchy and theology of the Church. There was a time when wo­men who wanted to devote themselves to God and their Church settled down to silence and obedience by becoming Sisters of one order of the other, pas­sively teaching the Word to school children and villagers in far-off lands. But times have changed.

always maintained that catching the Band marching out to practice on one of my occasional forays to the library, and hearing the fight song and subse­quent drumbeat, gives me enough pep to get through an additional ten pages before I visit the land of Nod. I guess you could equate it to a human Vivarin pill. 
Seriously, though, I firmly believe that the Band is one of the best things about Notre Dame. Their perpetual

spirit and the halftime fun they have provided me with will reserve a place for them in my heart as one of the thumbs-up groups at this place. 
I have only one more thing to add: make it a good show on Saturday. I think that seeing the Lions get thrown to the Christians would be much more enjoyable with a little musical accom­paniment.

of the University over to the Trus­tees without asking for anything, with no conditions. It had to have been the largest amount ever 
handed over to lay control." 
According to the Statutes of Notre Dame, the Fellows of the University are a self perpetuating body of 12 members. Six mem­bers are Holy Cross priests, or clerical fellows, and six members 
are lay fellows. Six of these fel­lows hold office ex officio, name­ly, the Provincial of the Indiana Province of the Holy Cross order, the President of the University, the Provost, the Executive Vice President, and the Chairman and Secretary of the Board of Trus­tees. All other fellows hold office terms ofsix years, and are simul­taneously members of the Board of Trustees. The University Pres­ident acts as Chairman, and the fellows meet annually. The duties of their office include electing the Board of Trustees by a two-thirds vote, adopting and amending the bylaws of the Uni­versity, preserving the physical property and material goods of Notre Dame, and "preserving the essential character of {he Univer­sity as a Catholic institution of higher learning." 
The Board of Trustees is a 50­member body including ex of­ficio members as follows: the clerical fellows and the President and Honorary President of the Alumni Association. All other Trustees serve terms of three years, and two of the Trustees must be recent graduates of the University, one male and one female, under the age of.30, who only serve one three-year term. 
The retirement age for Trustees 
is 70, at which time the retired 
Trustee has the status of Trustee 
Emeritus, and may still attend 
meetings, although he has no 
vote. 

The Board meets biannually and its seven standing commit­tees reflect its broad range of University control as follows: Ex­ecutive, Nominating, Academic and Faculty Affairs, Student Af­fairs, Financial Affairs, Invest­ment, and Public Relations and Development. The Board ap­proves the budget among other duties, but it is unique from other university boards in that all aca­demic regulations are left to the Academic Council, a 60 member board comprised of administra­tion, faculty, and students. 
Father Hesburgh said he would not change a thing about Notre Dame's Board ofTrustees. "They are not just businessmen who are barely involved with the Uni­versity," he said. "I have had no problem at all with the Board, "probably because of the mem­bers' academic experience, their knowledge about investing the endowment and running the budget, and because so many of them are alumni." 
Notre Dame's Board of Trus­tees will make the decision on a new president to succeed Father Hesburgh's .35-year term this Friday.

Micky and Davy prove that they can be as much fun as a barrel of  (guess). 
Monkeeshines 
GERTIE WIMMER 
features copy editor 
I got ready, feeling vaguely like 
Cinderella on her way to the 
Prince's place. I was going to see 
the Monkees. I was going to 
review the Monkees. It was one 
of those cases where dreams do 
come true. 
I always wanted to see the Monkees (Who didn't?), but of course by the time I was "old enough," the television super­kids had gone in different direc­tions. Micky (George Michael) Dolenz had gotten into television production in England, where he now lives with his wife and three daughters. Peter Tork (Torkelson) was living with his giriJ'~end in New York. He had formed a cult-status band called "The Peter Tork Project," about which little was generally heard. 
Davy Jones, who I had a crush on before I knew there was a dif­ference between boys and girls, I had last seen on a talk show talking about his lovely wife and his many daughters. Then I knew how old we all had become. 
None of them looked old though when they bounded onto the stage at about quarter after nine last night to the roars of the crowd. They were bouncing, singing, joking and gagging like they had so many sitcoms ago, and we couldn't help but respond. Although the press box was relatively calm, from my vantage point (I was standing and dancing) I saw select celebrity feet tapping. 
And then the Monkees can1t on. And they were better than a 

date to the prom (certainl~ better 
than the dateJ took to my prom!) 
The concert upon reflection was 
great, the reliving ofa childhood 
fantasy, a great thrill yet with that 
aftertaste ofpain that came when 
when I realized I could never go 
back to their era, the era of my 
childhood, again. 

The Monkees made thdr grand entrance accompanied by the theme from their television program--a style to which their many generations of fans were accustomed. Halfway through, the recording got stuck and the comedy began. With a quite literal explosion the band launched into "Last Train to Clarksville," one of their first commercia! hits in the '60s. 
"Stepping Stone," "No Time," and "Day Dream Believer" fol­lowed while the crowd sang along. The three reUnited Monkees took turns singing lead vocals, with Micky taking the majority of the tunes including a rockin' version of "Going Down" which was the equivalent (for him and quite a few members of the audience) of an entire semester of aerobic workouts. 
Davy stuck to quieter ballads like "I Wanna Be Free," which he said reflected back to that time when boys liked girls, girls liked boys, and the only one who swung both ways was Tarzan. (You had to be there.) His rendi­tion of "Valerie" brought thousands of squeals f.rom what seemed a largely high school crowd. 
About half way through the hour the Monkees spent on stage, Peter got his chance in the spotlight, as he started to tell the history of the band. He sung "Auntie Griselda," a song un­known to many people which I fortunately had on one Monkees album at home. Peter captured the crowds' approval by dancing on the speakers at both sides of the stage, something neither of his cohorts had done." 
By the end of the show, only one girl had hugged Davy on stage (Who was that and how did she get up there?, I ask.) All three Monkees had touched hands in the crowd, and several bouquets of flowers were tossed up. They had danced a chorus line--Davy with hat and cane. They had ban­tered in the old NBC series style, having fun on stage the same way they used to on TV (then with Mike Nesmith, who was notably absent from all press photos.) 
The Monkees returned for one encore which included the songs "Listen to the Band" and "Pleasant Valley Sunday." They concluded their triumphal Tues­day night performance by walking offstage in the infamous Monkee walk, a walk which every­one and their best friend had been doing in front of the ACC before the concert. The group left the flowers on stage, (or would have) but I, being the in­vestigative type, received per­mission from the stage crew to see them. The cards contained girls addresses and phone num­bers (sheesh!) which the band never saw--something to keep in mind.

Good blend of experience, youth has SMC swimmers looking ahead 
By JANE SHEA Sports Writer 
With the arrival of four fresh­men and the return of an expe­rienced corps of swimmers that suffered only two gradua­tion losses, the Saint Mary's swim team is counting on a pro­ductive 1986-87 campaign. 
At least that's according to Saint Mary's head coach Nancy Jo Kuzmitz, who will take her Belles squad into its first meet of the season Friday at North Central College. 
"We have a strong team this season,"said Kuzmitz, "and a variety of strokes which will add a lot of depth." 
This fact, along with a new schedule that features more teams of Saint Mary's caliber, 
Irish

feld. "The girls have a great attitude together and they really work as a team. They have progressed a great deal this season." 
The strongest asset to the team this season was the con­sistent play of junior goalie 
M.J. Beetel. Coming into the net with little varsity experi­ence, Beetelled the defense as it improved steadily. 

I 
"The goalkeeping by M.J. be­came better and better all season long," said Lindenfeld. "Our defense started the season with little knowledge of how the other players would work on the field, but they have learned to work as a group. Our passing has improved and we are more confident." 
I 
While the defense supported the team, the forward line was 
I 
plagued with injuries halfway through the year. Co-captains 
Corrine DiGiacomo and Mary Wagner, the biggest scoring threats for the Irish, both were

t 
I lost for the season, substan­
tially reducing Notre Dame's t offensive production.I DiGiacomo ended her career 
I 
shortly after becoming the all­
time leading scorer in Irish his­

tory.

I 
I 
Looking toward next season, Lindenfeld cannot help but be I concerned that the entire for­I ward line for the Irish will I graduate this year, leaving
I 
more holes to fill for the fall.

backs and links, spots where the Irish will look to be espe­cially strong. 
"Benet DeBerry, Caroline Berezny and Christine Sweeney are our stalwarts and they will all be back for us in the fall," said Lindenfeld. "We need to become more aggres­sive and really fight to be a really competitive team. The defense is the solid part of our squad." 

should  translate  into  a  good  
year.  
"We  are  swimming in  the  

NAIA this year,"said Kuzmitz, ''which is a better association for our team." 
Last Friday, the Belles were invited to swim in the Notre Dame Relays where they tied Marquette for fifth place out of 17 teams. 
"We swam excellently for our first meet," said Kuzmitz. "The races were close and we were up against some good swimmers." 
One Saint Mary's group, the 500-yard relay team, swam particularly well on Friday, placing second in the event. The team, which consisted of senior captains Mary Fisher and Patty Juckneiss, junior Mary Hogan, and freshmen

The pollsters went out and ruined the party. By demoting Penn State to No.3, they have taken some of the luster out of Saturday's matchup. 
There has been gobs of hype about how the Fiesta, Gator, and Florida Citrus bowls have been seeking sponsers to enable them to up their antes for a Miami-Penn State matchup for the National Cham­pionship. The increase is necessary to lure Miami away from bowls like the Orange and Sugar, which offer a much larger purse but not the chance for the Hurricanes to defeat No. 2. 
But now those bums that cast the all-important votes have sent Penn State down to No.3. A matchup between Miami and Penn State at this point cannot claim to determine the National Championship ex­clusively. The pollsters may be saved from ruining the dream matchup if Michigan loses to Ohio State, which would give undefeated Penn State a chance to move back into the second slot. 
But that's where the Irish come in. 
Although the excitement of beating the third­ranked team is not quite the same as beating the second-ranked team, I don't really think too many people on the Notre Dame side are going to argue. After all, the Irish are 0-2 against second-ranked teams this season. Whether Penn State is second or third, at any rate, they must be undefeated to qualify for any hope of a shot at Miami. 
The red-hot Irish have an opportunity to make all the talk of a National Championship matchup just babble. 
Notre Dame poses the only real obstacle to that

matchup since Penn State only has the Pitt Pan­thers left on the schedule after the Irish. Without John Cangemi, the Panthers lose a lot of their snarl. 
But while Notre Dame can ruin Penn State's trip to the dream game, the Irish can rain on a lot of other people's parades as well. Think of the long faces of the selection committees of the Gator, Fiesta, and Florida Citrus bowls if the Irish nix their chances at a Penn State-Miami game. Notre Dame could be the masked bandit that takes away unlimited amounts of revenue and national expo­sure. 
Being the bad guys can be a lot of fun. 
The game presents a case where Penn State has nothing to gain, since they are expected to win, and everything to lose, like a shot at the National Cham­pionship. The Irish, on the other hand, are in a very different situation. A win against Penn State could serve some notice to some bowl committees to give the Irish more than a passing glance. They can only help themselves at this point. Unfortunately, the Lions are just one step toward any bowl berth, and each step requires a little spring. 
But this game is a special one even if there are no bowl representives chomping at the bit. It presents a little tradition and old-fashioned charm. 

The beauty of the game is captured in the uni­forms of each team. Penn State has the ugliest uni­forms in the nation in the eyes of many, but I don't agree. The simple white-and-blues that look more like some team's practice uniforms represent a little taste of college football in its purest form. Quarterback John Schaffer has been quoted as saying that Joe Paterno would do away with the numbers on the uniforms if he could get away with it. Simplicity has a beauty all its own. 
Notre Dame's move to this year's edition of uni­form puts it in Penn State's class. They both disdain the players' names on the back, heavy striping and rainbow colors. Traditional black shoes present an aura in which the game of football was meant to played. 
With last year's rain and mud added to all this, you have a picture that only John Madden dreams of. 
If you compare scores, the Irish shouldn't have a chance. While the Irish fell to Alabama decisively, 28-10, Penn State went out and left the Crimson Tide red-faced with a convincing 23-3 drubbing. But that's why the game is played on the field. The Irish have come a long way since that debacle, and ap­pear to be primed for a major test such as Penn State will administer. 
So while the pollsters may have ruined the party, this game provides at least enough entertainment for a little gathering.
