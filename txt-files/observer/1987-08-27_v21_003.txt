McCafferty dies after cancer bout 
By CHRIS JULKA Assistant News Editor 
Father Michael McCafferty, 40, assistant dean of the Notre Dame Law School, died June 12 of cancer at Saint Joseph Medi­cal Center in South Bend. 
McCafferty was one of the four finalists in last year's search for a successor to Theodore Hesburgh as Univer­sity president. 
Born on Aug. 18, 1946, in Cin­cinnati, McCafferty received a bachelor's degree in govern­ment and international studies from Notre Dame and stayed to earn a doctor of laws in 1973 and master's degree in theol­ogy in 1974. 
Making his first vows in Holy Cross order on July 16, 1967, McCafferty was ordained to the priesthood in Sacred Heart Church on April 6, 1974. 
From 1974 to 1976, he served as a trial lawyer for the U.S. Equal Employment Commis­sion in Washington, D.C., and in the following year became a consultant for one of Chicago's most prestigious law firms, Winston & Strawn. The lawyer and priest was awarded a master of laws degree from Harvard in 1978. 

Fr. Michael McCafferty 
In the following year McCaf­ferty was named assistant dean of the Notre Dame Law School. Author of "Medical Malpractice: Bases of Liability," published in 1985, he specialized in constitutional law, medical malpractice and product liability. 

Survivors include five sisters, Patricia Veith, Mar­garet Cronin, Aileen Geraci, Mary Dorger, and Tracy McCafferty, all of Cincinnati; his parents, Mr. and Mrs. J. Robert McCafferty of Cincin­nati; and his grandmother, Mrs. Albert Harmeier, also of Cincinnati. Preceding him in death was his sister, Kathleen, who died in 1975.

l I SAB 
becomes SUB 

. By PAT HEALY --··· News staff 
The Student Activities Board has announced it has changed its name to the Student Union Board because of incon­veniences caused by its former name. 
The only difference, said Board Manager Janel Blount, is that the "A" in SAB will be replaced with a "U." 
The renamed organization cited two reasons for the name change. First, the Board was often confused with the Office of Student Activities, an arm of the administration. Complaints or comments intended for the OSA were often misdirected to the Student Activity Board.

For $20,000, would you read this entire column? 
"Would you be willing to give up sex for five years if you could have wonderfully sensual and erotic dreams any night you wished?" 
"You, your closest friend, and your father are on vacation together, hiking in a remote jungle. Your two companions stumble into a nest of poisonous vipers and are bitten repeatedly. You know neither will live without an immediate shot of anti-venom, yet there is only a single dose of anti-venom and it is in your pocket. What would you do?" 
"Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as your dinner guest? as your close friend? as your lover?" 
"The Book of Questions." 
Written by Dr. Gregory Stock ($3.95, Workman Publishing, New York), the 205-page book contains no answers. Just questions. 
For example, "If you could script the basic plot for the dream you will have tonight, what would the story be?" Or, "Would you be willing to reduce your life expectance by five years to become extremely attractive?" 
But wait. There's more. 
For slobs, there's the question, "For $20,000 would you go for three months without washing, brushing your teeth, or using deoderant? As­sume you could not explain your reasons to anyone." 
And for pet lovers, "Would $50,000 be enough money to induce you to take a loyal, healthy pet to the vet to be put to sleep?" 
For the animal and nature lover, "Assuming that complete recovery were instantaneous, would you be willing to accept a year of com­plete paralysis below the neck to prevent the otherwise certain extinction of the blue whale?'' 
And there's a question for ROTCs, too. "Would you accept $10,000 to shave your head and continue your normal activities sans hat or wig without explaining the reason for your hair­cut?" 
And for those reading this at lunch: "Would you be willing to eat a bowl of live crickets for $40,000?" 
A question for gamblers: "You are offered $1,000,000 for the following act: Before you are ten pistols --only one of which is loaded. You must pick up one of the pistols, point it at your forehead, and pull the trigger. If you can walk

away, you do so a millionaire. Would you accept the risk?" 
For the cruel: "For an all-expense paid, one­week vacation anywhere in the world, would you be willing to kill a beautiful butterfly by pulling off its wings? What about stepping on a cockroach?" 
And for the unsatisfied: "If you were able to wake up tomorrow in the body of someone else, would you do so? Whom would you pick?" 
Then there are the questions that for some, have what appear to be obvious answers. For example, ask a Saint Mary's student, "Would you generally rather be overdressed or un­derdressed at a party?" 
Or ask a Notre Dame student, "Have you had satisfying sex within the last three months?" 
Can I say that? 
Anyway, you may be wondering how success­ful Stock's book has been. Well, Stock ap­parently got rich; ''The Book of Questions'' was recently on the best-seller list. 
Which brings up a question that's not in his book. Why didn't I think of it?

Iran-Contra source: Cables not missing 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The chief of the CIA's clandestine service told Congress that Iran-Contra independent counsel Lawrence Walsh is probing the mystery of missing CIA cables alerting the spy agency in late 1985 that U.S.-made missiles were being shipped to Iran, according to testimony released Wednes­day. 
Clair George, the CIA's dep­uty director for operations, raised the possibility the cables could have been destroyed in a cover-up, but he discounted the likelihood. 
George's private testimony on Aug. 5 and 6 before the con­gressional Iran-Contra com­mittees was distributed Wed­nesday although some

In addition to his comments 
on the missing cables, George 
also: 
Testified that the White 
House and the late CIA director 
William J. Casey ignored his 
strong complaints that un­
savory and untrustworthy 
people were helping run what 
George viewed as a total "arms 
for hostages deal" with Iran. 
Suggested that Lt. Col. Oliver North's engaging personality won him friends at the CIA but a tendency toward exaggera­tion and melodrama kept even those who liked him skeptical about things he told them. Still, he said, North had endeared himself to Casey, in part be­cause he was "action oriented" and reminded Casey of his own exploits during World War II with the Office of Strategic Ser­vices, the military precursor to the CIA. 
Declared that the North­directed diversion of arms­sales profits to aid the Contras was something the CIA could not properly be involved in. 
"You cannot take United 
States weapons and just go out 
and sell them for a profit and 
use the profits as you see fit," 
he said. "That's the gospel." 
In another development, the Republican Party's effort to capitalize on North's popularity has drawn a rebuke from Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, the senior GOP member of the Senate Iran-Contra committee. 
"If you're like me, you're very proud of Oliver North," said the fund-raising letter signed by party chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. 
Rudman, however, said in a 
letter to Fahrenkopf that North had participated in deceiving the president and other offi­cials and "these are not actions that are representative of the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower and Reagan.

JOHANNESBURG, South 
Africa-The National Union of 
Mineworkers voted Wednesday 
to continue a 17-day-old strike, 
rejecting an offer by the top 
mining companies that slightly 
improved benefits but not 
wages. 

A grim-faced union general­secretary Cyril Ramaphosa read a statement prepared by union leaders at a two-hour meeting that followed daylong voting by thousands of black miners on the offer from the Chamber of Mines, which represents the top mining com­panies. 
"The telex that we transmit­ted to the chamber was to in­form them that our entire membership on the striking mines has decided not to accept the chamber's offer," Ramap­hosa said. Thousands of miners voted by show of hands in hostels and unions halls in South Africa's longest and costliest mine strike. 
"The reaction of the workers has shown that they are reject­ing the offer," National Union of Mineworkers President James Motlatsi had said earlier in an interview in western Transvaal province. "The ball is in the chamber's court." 
The management offer would have slightly improved death benefits and holiday pay, but it did not address the union's demand for a 30 percent wage hike, the main reason the strike was called. 
Union leadership did not rec­ommend approval or rejection of the offer. 
The union planned to reply Wednesday night to the man­agement offer. 
Union officials say 340,000 miners are on strike at 45 gold and coal mines in the biggest legal walkout in the country's history. The chamber puts the number of strikers at 210,000 at 29 mines. 
Representatives of the union and the chamber met for four hours Tuesday in the first con­tract negotiations since the strike began Aug. 9.

7 governors seek Auto Pact 

A Notre Dame student takes time out from classes to drive his cares away yesterday with a video driving machines in LaFor­tune Student Center. 
Associated Press 
LANSING, Mich. -The governors of seven carmaking states, complaining that the current treaty is "distorting in­vestment and trade to the bene­fit of Canada," are urging the 
U.S. government to negotiate a new Auto Pact. 
"We believe that an equi­table agreement which lowers the existing ... barriers should enhance the economies of both countries," the governors of Michigan, Missouri, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio and Wisconsin agreed in a statement released Wednes­day. 
''The U.S.-Canadian Automo­tive Agreement represents a departure from free and fair trade between our nations," the governors said. "The Auto Pact in its present form cannot continue as the basis for a long­term bilateral trading relation­ship in automotive products be­tween our two countries." 
The governors said the 1965 treaty "limits our ability to at­tract new investment and hinders our companies' access to the Canadian market." 
The Auto Pact allows some motor vehicles to pass duty­free between the United States and Canada. 
It is not a formal part of free­trade talks between the two na­tions, but members of Congress have said an agreement on autos will be important in win­ning congressional approval of any free-trade agreement. 
Under the ground rules of the negotiations, which are being held this week in Ontario, a pro­
posal must be presented to 
Congress by Oct. 5. 
Although the pact is not a for­
mal part of the negotiations, 
"all trade issues between the 
U.S. and Canada are being dis­cussed," said Gary Holmes, spokesman for U.S. Trade Rep­resentative Clayton Yeutter. 
"The Canadians don't want to discuss (the Auto Pact)," he said. "We say that you can't have comprehensive negotia­tions and take things off the table." 
The governors want Canada to: -Extend the benefits of duty­free automotive trade only to 
U.S. manufacturers, and not to those of Japan or other countries. 
-Put U.S. vehicle parts sup­
pliers on an equal footing with 
Canadian parts companies by 
dumping Canadian content re­
quirements. 
-Eliminate an "illegal export subsidy" that lowers the amount of duty paid by auto companies that purchase Canadian parts for export to the U.S. 
"This is not a new position but it increases the emphasis and highlights dissatisfaction on the U.S. side," said Paul Wonnacott, a University of Maryland economics professor and author of a studv on the U.S.-Canada auto issue. 
"I would assume that the negotiators will pay attention to the governors," he said. 
Under the pact, U.S. car­makers must make one car in Canada for every car sold there. They also have to use at least 60 percent Canadian parts 
and labor for each car; 50 per­cent for each truck. 
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. all build cars and trucks in Canada for sale in the United States, including all of Chrys­ler's small minivans. 
The pact has long been un­popular among U.S. autoworkers because it secures jobs for Canadians without equal protection for Americans. For instance, GM is closing 11 plants in the United States but keeping open some weak plants in Canada. 
In addition, Canada has given Japanese automakers generous incentives --includ­ing tariff remissions --to open plants there. 
Canadian plants are planned by Toyota Motor Corp., Hyun­dai Motor Co., and a GM-Suzuki joint venture. Honda Motor Co. started making cars in Canada in November 1986. 
Canada makes up less than 10 percent of the North Amer­ican auto market but about 30 percent of the Japanese and Korean plants in North America will be built there. 
Many in the U.S. auto indus­try fear that means that Asian makers will try to use the pact to ship Canadian-made vehicles into the United States duty-free, circumventing re­strictions on exports from Japap to this country. 
The heads of state forged the agreement while in Michigan last month for a meeting of the National Governors' Associa­tion. 

Survey: Businesses not ready to deal with AIDS 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -A majority of the country's top businesses are unprepared to deal with AIDS despite growing evidence the fatal disease could eventually cost corporate America bil­lions of dollars, a survey released Wednesday found. 
Of 100 Fortune 1000 compan­ies surveyed in late July, only 29 had policies for dealing with employees with AIDS, and nine were considering adopting guidelines, according to the survey by the Boston office of TeleSearch Inc. 
"It is almost as though most of these companies don't want to admit that AIDS exists or that it will only affect the 'ot­her' company," said Ellen C. Kinlin, president of TeleSearch, a national execu­tive search firm owned by Fidelity Investments. 
Three of the companies sur­veyed said they would fire employees who contracted ac-

quired immune deficiency syndrome, while 25 said they might do so, the survey found. 
Sixty-seven companies said they would not fire employees with AIDS, and five refused to answer the question. 
Of the 14 companies requir­ing employees to have regular medical checkups, only one re­quired an AIDS test, TeleSearch said. 
One-third of the companies said they expected health in­surance costs to increase dramatically because of AIDS, while 25 companies said insur­ance costs would not increase, according to the survey. 
AIDS eventually could cost major corporations billions of dollars because of increased health insurance costs, lost work time and production and related costs, the TeleSearch report said. 
TeleSearch refused to release the names of the com­panies it surveyed, saying it promised them confidentiality. The surveyed companies are in New England, New York, Washington and Chicago and represent manufacturing, in­surance, health care, utilities and consumer products, the company said. 
A random survey of a dozen major companies Wednesday by The Associated Press found varying efforts to deal with AIDS, which attacks the body's ability to fight disease and in­fection. The disease primarily is spread through sexual con­tact and the sharing of infected needles by intravenous drug users. 
Several company spokesmen said constant developments in research and the uncertainty among government and the in­surance industry about how to respond to the disease were partly repsonsible for what TeleSearch termed the corpor­ate world's lagging response to dealing with AIDS. 
Raytheon Co., a major defense contractor which has 76,000 employees worldwide, does not have a formal AIDS policy, said spokesman Ed Powers.

Laxalt out of nomination race 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Former Sen. Paul Laxalt announced Wednesday he is withdrawing from the race for the 1988 Re­publican presidential nomina­tion after "a careful and real­istic assessment of our financial situation.'' 
Laxalt, who has raised more than $1 million, made the an­nouncement in a statement issued about 7 p.m. EDT Wed­nesday by his campaign com­mittee. 
In the statement, Laxalt, a 
former Republican senator 
from Nevada, said his commit­
tee has "thoroughly test~d the 
political and financial waters 
for the past four months." 
"While the political response 
was encouraging, the financial 
outlook was not as bright," he 
said. 

"We are a family of very modest economic means, and I wasn't about to embark on a campaign that would have led us into a financial black hole," he said. 
Laxalt has said that he wanted to have $2 million in the bank by Oct. 1. In the state­ment, he said that "even if our projections for fund raising had been met, the money, in my opinion, would have been in­adequate to conduct a viable presidential campaign." 
"As chairman of Ronald Reagan's three presidential campaigns, I have learned to be very realistic when it comes to political fund raising. A care­ful and realistic assessment of our financial situation caused me to do what I think is right for the Laxalt family." 
Laxalt, 65, never formally entered the race but said on April28 that he was forming an exploratory committee and that his decision to run was "as close to final as one can get," with financing the only ques­tion to be answered. 
Laxalt, a close friend of Pres­ident Reagan, said he wanted to succeed him in the Oval Of­fice because "there is much un­finished work to do." 
His departure from the GOP race leaves three announced candidates, former Delaware Gov. Pierre S. Du Pont IV, former Secretary of State Al­exander Haig, and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, in the com­petition. In addition, likely can­didates are Vice President George Bush, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, and the Rev. Pat Robertson. 
Army grounds new helicopters 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The Army on Wednesday grounded its en­tire fleet of new AH-64 Apache helicopter gunships, describing the action as a precautionary measure in the wake of a fatal crash last week. 
The service said the directive applied to all 264 Apaches now in the inventory and will remain in effect until an inves­tigation is completed of an Aug. 21 crash at Fort Rucker, Ala. 
An instructor pilot was killed and a student pilot seriously in­jured in last week's crash.

ATLANTA -A federal ap­peals court Wednesday reversed an Alabama judge's order that had banned 44 textbooks from Alabama public schools on the grounds they promoted a belief in secular humanism. 
In allowing the textbooks to remain in use, a three-judge ical failure in the tail rotor swashplate assembly," the Army said in a statement. 

The statement said the Army was still investigating the cause of the failure. After the investigation is complete, the Army said, instructions would be issued on what would be needed to bring the AH-64 back into service. 
The Aug. 21 crash was the third major accident involving AH-64s during the current fis­cal year, but the first to produce a fatality. The other two accidents also occurred at Fort Rucker, on Aug. 10 and July 9. 
Earlier this summer, the Army ordered all Apaches tem­porarily grounded for modifi­cations to an engine wiring har­ness. Those modifications took only about four hours per helicopter, however, and the fleet was quickly returned to service. 
The Apache is replacing the Cobra helicopter gunship as the Army's primary attack helicopter. Designed to kill enemy tanks, the Apache is also a twin-engine copter and is loaded with Hellfire and Hydra 7 missiles and a 30mm cannon.

Reagan pushes for arms agreement 
Associated Press 

LO~ ANGELES -President Reag n on Wednesday ap­plaud d West Germany's wil­
lingn~s to destroy its Pershing 
1-A m ssiles and declared that the viet Union must not "erec additional barriers" to a sup power agreement on the global elimination of 
inter~diate-range missiles. 
In a speech to the Town Hall of Cal ornia, a civic organiza­tion, eagan also challenged the S viet Union to bring a spirit of "glasnost" or open­ness ti its military affairs and said past U.S.-Soviet arms pacts ave been "too often vio­lated by the U.S.S.R." 
The address, billed in ad­
vance by White House officials 
as a major assessment of U.S.­
Soviet relations, came as Chan­
cellor Helmut Kohl said in 
Bonn that West Germany will 
destroy rather than modernize 
its Pershing missiles if the su­
perpowers scrap all their 
medium-and short-range mis­
siles in the Intermediate 
Nuclear Force, or INF, class. 
The Soviet Union has said it 
would not sign a disarmament 
agreement unless it includes 
the 72 Pershing 1-A missiles, 
which are owned by West Ger­
many but have nuclear war­
heads controlled by the United 
States. 

"We can wrap up an agree­
ment on intermediate-range 
nuclear missiles promptly," 
Reagan said. "There are still 
issues to be worked out. Our 
delegation in Geneva has 
already pointed the way to sim­
plifying verification require­
ments now that we have agreed to the total elimination of U.S. and Soviet INF missiles." 
But the president, without mentioning the name of his So­viet counterpart, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, called on the Kremlin to smooth the way toward an arms accord. 

He said the United States has "repeatedly pointed out that the last-minute demand by the Soviets concerning West Ger­man Pershing 1-A missiles was without foundation.'' 
"Earlier today, Chancellor 
Kohl removed even this artifi­
cial obstacle from considera­
tion," Reagan said. "We are 
therefore hopeful that the 
Soviet Union will demonstrate 
that there is substance behind 
the rhetoric they have repeated 
so often of late --that they 
genuinely want a stabilizing INF agreement. 
"If so, they will move to meet our proposals constructively rather than erect additional barriers to agreement." 
A senior administration offi­cial said before the speech that "there was absolutely no pres­sure" brought to bear on the Bonn government by Washing­ton. 
The president's speech ap­peared to be a new attempt to take the offensive in the long­running public relations struggle with the Kremlin. Gor­bachev has scored some major victories over Reagan, with recent polls in Europe showing that a majority of people believe the Soviet leader -­rather than Reagan --is a champion of peace.

Museum workers on pig dig 
Associated Press 
TASWELL, Ind. -A team of Indiana State Museum workers hopes to find enough prehis­toric pig bones near the Patoka Reservoir this week to erect a skeleton to grace the museum's planned Earth Sciences gallery. 
The "pig diggers" are muck­ing around in a cramped Craw­ford County cave in a week­long excavation for the extinct peccary bones. 
Two young spelunkers dis­covered the 10,000-year-old bones in the cave owned by Vic­tor Megenity last fall. 
Ronald L. Richards, curator of natural history, calls the find significant. 
"Finds of peccaries are com­mon in other places, but not in Indiana. They commonly traveled in herds, so we think this could be Indiana's big statement," said a mud-caked Richards, who heads the team of nine. 
Unlike Richards and Ball State University archaeologist Don Cochran, most members of the museum crew are novice cave diggers. 
To get to the deep pit where Mark Spencer of Louisville, Ky., and David Reynolds of New Albany found the bones, the workers must crawl and squeeze through a narrow, 40­yard long passageway. Once at the pit, they carefully scoop up mud and clay into black plastic buckets, which are hauled or pulled by ropes to the mouth of the cave. The buckets then are carried about 100 yards to an area where Richards and Cochran oversee a crew that washes the mud through mesh screens in search of tiny bones. 
"We've got parts of at least three individual peccaries, and

it should build up quickly in the next couple of days as we get closer to the bedrock," Ric­hards said. 
When peccaries roamed the southern Indiana more than 10,000 years ago, the forests and their inhabitants had little resemblance to what is found today, Richards said. 
"There would have been more spruces, some pines and more sporadic areas of gras­sland. The winters wouldn't have been as cold and the sum­mers wouldn't have been as hot. There would have been a lot of large animals, elephants, mastodons, mammoths. And the Indians were just starting to come across the Bering Strait," he said. 
Richards and his crew are trying to make that era more understandable to today's Hoosiers. 
"We'll be here until Satur­day. A good cave digger knows you're not done until you hit bedrock," said Richards. "I al­most hope I don't find anything else. I've got so much work to do I'll have to live to be at least 125." 
Memories of plane crash linger on 
Associated Press 

MAPLE GLEN, Pa. -The survival of 4-year-old Cecilia Chichan from the crash of Northwest Airlines Flight 255 helps give the rest of her family the strength to cope with the deaths of her parents and bro­ther, a priest said at their fu­neral Wednesday. 
Michael Cichan, 32; Paula Cichan, 33; and their 6-year-old son, David, who were among the 156 people who died, were remembered during Mass at St. Alphonsus Roman Catholic Church, where the couple was married. 
"Talking about Cecilia will always remind us of the miracle of life. We believe God spared her to give the rest of her family the strength to bear the cross," the Rev. Andrew Robberecht said during the ser­vice. 
Three matching, chestnut­brown caskets rested before the .altar adorned with more than a dozen flower arrange­ments. About 350 people packed into the church, 25 miles from Philadelphia. 
The Cichans had been visit­ing relatives in the area and were en route to their home in Tempe, Ariz., when the plane crashed Aug. 16. 
''Today as in the past few days, we all stand together as a shocked and stricken group of people. Death brings us face to face with the deepest ques­tions of faith," Robberecht said. 
The priest, who is also a teacher at nearby Archbishop Wood High School, married the Cichans and baptized their two children. He described them as "a young, beautiful family with a promising future." 
Cecilia's condition was upgraded to fair Wednesday at the the Burn Center at the Uni­versity of Michigan Hospitals in Ann Arbor, Mich. 

Detective: Loan all in a day's work 
Associated Press 

INDIANAPOLIS -When an 
Edinburgh police officer 
loaned a Cincinnati college stu­
dent $20 earlier this month, he 
never expected to see the 
money again. But an envelope 
arrived with a crisp $20 bill this 
week --from the White House. 
"It shocked me," detective Capt. Ron Beier, 41, said Wed­nesday. 
The envelope contained $20, an autographed photograph of President Ronald Reagan and a note on White House station­ery. 
It all started one afternoon earlier this month --but Beier couldn't remember exactly what day. Beier was sitting in his office at the Edinburgh Police Department, about 25 miles south of Indianapolis, when the secretary rang him that him the White House was on the line. 
"I said, 'Sure, the White House on the corner,' " said Beier, who also serves as as­sistant police chief. "Then I said, 'Tell them I don't know a thing about the Iran-Contra thing.' "

tary wasn't joking, and when 
he picked up the line, the per­
son on the other end identified 
himself as William Feezle of 
the federal Office of Manage­

ton. 
Feezle's son, Chris, had gone 
to the Johnson County Horse 
Park near Edinburgh to visit a 
friend at the Pan American 
Games equestrian competition 
and had run low on cash. So 
low, in fact, he couldn't get 
back to Cincinnati, where he at­
tends college. 
Beier said Chris called his dad from the Dairy Queen res­taurant in Edinburgh and asked that he get some cash to him right away. Feezle called the police department and asked that somebody loan Chris $20. 
"I met him at the Dairy Queen and handed him $20 and went on about my business," Beier said. "I didn't put a whole lot of stock in it. I knew somebody needed some help and I helped. When a person gets in a rough spot, you just kind of jump in and help them out."

"U.S. comnanies are l!oinl! for greater profits instead of more market share, and that's a big mistake,'' he said. 
The dollar is worth only 40 to 50 percent of what it was worth in mid-1985. But despite this depreciation, export prices in the second quarter of 1987 ac­tually rose 1 percent, Wednes­day's report showed. 
Exports, overall, increased in the April-June quarter by $3 billion to $60 billion. Analysts said this was a bright spot in the otherwise gloomy report. Exports had decreased just slightly in the first quarter to $56.99 billion, down from $57.02 billion in the last three months of 1986. 
Some analysts argued that, despite the widening of the trade gap, if recent inflation is taken into account, the trade figures actually show a slight improvement.

Campers eliminate housing difficulties

~ 
thetic worries: What will my dorm be like? Will there be lots of things to do? Will the campus be as beautiful as I remembered it? 

This year, I got a special surprise. At first I thought there was a football game going on. I could barely control myself. It's always hard waiting for the home opener to finally roll around, but this year I thought maybe we were playing preseason games or something like that. But as I got closer to campus, I realized this was no football game. What was going on? Everywhere I looked, gorgeous campers and mobile homes. They were everywhere: around the stadium, behind the ACC, in the stu­dent parking lots-it was really in­credible. I had no idea what they were doing here. 
After giving it a great deal of thought, I realized what had happened. This year, as usual, a surprising number of freshmen were without dorm rooms. But this year, unlike past years, the administration had actually come up with a good idea on how to deal with this problem. They had brought in RV's and mobile homes to house the fresh­men until more permanent housing could be found. 
P.O. Box Q 
Priest's life mirrored in beauty of campus 
Dear Editor: 
Even the ducks of St. Mary's Lake gazed in mezmerized silence upon the. inspiring tribute to this great man. 
At his ordination at Sacred Heart Church only thirteen years ago, Father Michael McCafferty embarked upon a ministry that led thousands of us closer to Christ. At his funeral this past sum­mer, a small fraction of the people he touched formed a line over one-quarter of a mile long to lead him from that same church to his final resting place. 
Our Lady's campus was never more beautiful than on the day Father Mike was laid to rest. The afternoon sun serenely glistened off the water and il­luminated the landscape. Meanwhile, the Voice of God, barely audible at first, reached an almost deafening roar in the form of a warm, brisk breeze that embraced the throng approaching the cemetery hill. It seemed that God had offered us a glimpse of the place where Father Mike now peacefully resides, a 
Doonesbury 

place far more beautiful than even this, as a way of comforting us in our grief. 
Father Mike taught us many lessons, and he taught them well. He taught us to utilize our God-given abilities for the benefit of others. He taught us that the faith which we have nurtured here will mean nothing if we do not carry that faith with us into our personal and pro­fessional lives after we leave. He taught us that the strongest allies in the battle against adversity are courage, hope, a sense of humor, and an irrepressible belief in God. 
He also taught us to love Notre Dame. Father Mike cherished this university. One of the greatest tributes we can pay Father Mike is to cherish Notre Dame as he did. As the new school year begins, let us remember never to take for granted the time we spend together in the Notre Dame community, for it is far too short. 
I am not convinced that Father Mike's untimely death had a purpose. But I am convinced that his life cer­tainly did. And it's up to us to prove it. 
Tim McLean Notre Dame Law School 
This is really a great idea. Just think how excited young Johnny-who had never been to Notre Dame before-must have been to drive proudly down Notre Dame A venue and see row after row of the newest and most stylish forms of temporary student housing. Think of the joy his parents must have felt knowing their son was not going to be stuck in some old overcrowded dorm but was going to be living (and driving to class, most likely) in this sleek new home at no extra charge. The campus could not have looked more beautiful. 
As an extra bonus, Notre Dame Se­curity had cleverly made sure all the incoming freshmen would be aware that some of their mates would be taking advantage of this temporary housing by rerouting all traffic coming into Notre Dame out past this suburb on wheels. Even North Quad residents, who may have missed this attraction by using the Juniper Road entrance, got the opportunity to see these beauties. No sense rushing right to your dorm when you can spend half an hour looking at the University's latest at­tempt to show students just how impor­tant they are. 
Even students who live off-campus are fortunate enough to get involved in this new arrangement. Now, instead of spending fifteen boring minutes walking from the Senior Bar parking lot to the middle of campus, off-campus students can take their time brousing through this happy neighborhood. The jaunt into class is nothing when you realize all the administration has done to make the journey pleasant as well as possible. Watch out for those wood chips when they're wet though-yuk! 

There are a couple of problems with this arrangement. How will parietals be enforced? Will RA's patrol the RV's, turning back tent flaps to make sure no one has snuck off into the woods? What about privileges? Should the lucky stu­dents who get a camper be allowed to have bonfires just because they're out­side? And what about the alcohol policy? When is a camper that sleeps six so full that it is considered a party? 
There are also long-term problems to the Rod Quad. When football season comes, will the students living there au­tomatically get the best parking places? Or will they have to packup and leave by 8:00 a.m. days of home games? And what about night games? What if some students want to go to bed early? Will MUSCO have to dim certain lights so some of our freshmen can get a good night's sleep? Other sports may suffer too. Will we ever have another home basketball or hockey game? 
Despite these minor drawbacks, I think this camper idea is one of the best new plans Notre Dame has ever come up with. It's great for tourism, it solves the housing crunch, and it gives the grounds crew a much needed vacation. The incoming freshmen must feel great seeing the campus all prepared just for them. I know I'm proud knowing that the people in the administration think enough of me and my fellow students to do whatever it takes to make sure we're all comfortable. I just wish they would have thought of this when I first came here. I would have never worried about coming back.

'Life' photo exhibit featured at Snite 

Kim Yuratovac Assistant Features Editor 
The glamour of Marilyn Monroe, the tension of the Korean War and the dawn of the 1950's era of stability are among the Images that made "Life" Mag­azine so popular during the years Immediately after the Second World War. 
"Life: The Second Decade, 1946-1955" Includes photos that reflect the post-World War II era. The exhibit Is on display until Oc­tober I I In the O'Shaughnessy Galleries of the Snlte Museum of Art. 
"Life" Introduced a brand of photojournalism that needs no words to evoke the power and real feeling of the events that have Influenced the latter half of the twentieth century. 
"The first "Life" exhibit was 
such a success," said Peggy Tol­
bert. Educational Coordinator at 
the Snlte, "that we began Inquir­
Ing about the second exhibit 
before It was even finished." The 
first "Life" exhibit contained fa­
mous photos from World War II. 
The Snlte Is one of "The Second 
Decade's" last stops. It has been 
traveling to museums around 
the country for the last four years. 
"People who have seen the ex­hibit In other museums have complimented us on our dis­play," said Tolbert. "They say It looks different because we have memorabilia from the era and we have used color, music and videos to accent the photos." 
Many of the Innovations the Snlte used were made possible by a grant from the Declo family of Elkhart. Indiana. 
"We have to pay for the ship­ping of the exhibit so normally we wouldn't have the money to add the extras we have In this exhibit." said Tolbert. "But be­cause of this grant we were able to add Items that complement the photos and make the era be­come more real." 
Among the dated relics are a Coke bottle machine, a 1950's party dress, 3D glasses and magazines. "I think our display Is Interesting because people are able to touch things to get a bet­ter Idea of the time period," added Tolbert. "In most exhibits people are not allowed to touch any of the art. Because we en­courage people to get Involved with this exhibit. they are less In· 

hlblted  and  they enjoy  them·  
selves a lot."  
A  collection  of  old  "Life"  

Magazines are part of the dis­play. There Is also a 30 minute video featuring interviews with former "Life" correspondents and a 10 minute video produced by Pam Falkenberg of the Depar­tment of Communication and Theatre, combining "Life" head· lines and advertisements of the era. 
The exhibition of 200 photographs, collected from the 520 Issues betweeen I 946­1955, Is part of the largest In­dexed picture collection In the world. The photos were chosen by Doris O'Neil, "Life's" Director 
of VIntage Prints and formerly Chief of the "Life" Picture Collec· tlon, from the 156,000 photos taken In that era. 
The pictures "were not chosen as a review of photojournalism, nor as a guide to world events of the period," O'Neil writes In the exhibition catalogue. "This Is, rather, a selection of some of the most remarkable and com­pelling Images of that time, regardless of subject matter. Since "Life" was dedicated to covering national and world events, however, many of these pictures do reflect the decade's history. Another major area of the magazine's concern ·-the human condition --Is reflected In many more." 
According to Tolbert the Snlte's exhibit has received many positive responses. "There are always people In the galleries to see this exhibit." she said. "They seem to like the way we have or­ganized the exhibit, using music and videos to enhance the dis­play." 
Aside from the display Itself, the Snlte Museum Is sponsoring 
Margaret Bourke-Whlte<:ourtesy of Ufe Magazine 

a related film series, featuring films of the era. "Rear Window," "The African Queen," and "Brlgadoon" are among the films already shown. 
September .3 is scheduled as Marilyn Monroe night and Sep­tember 10 is Marlon Brando night. September 17 Is 3D night. September 24 features the films of James Dean and the October I theme is teen rebellion. All films are shown in the Annen­berg Auditorium in the Snite. 
To celebrate the success of the exhibit, the Snlte is sponsoring a Fifties Party and Sock Hop on Friday, September 1 I from 8 to 1 I p.m. at the Snlte. Admission Is free and Tolbert is encourag­ing students to attend and wear Fifties clothing to kee,e with the theme of the party. 
A lecture series also accom­panies the exhibit. Upcoming lectures Include a. talk with W. Eugene Smith at noon on Sep­tember 8 In the O'Shaughnessy Gallery, a lecture by Cornell Capa, executive director of the International Center of Photog­raphy and photographer John Phillips September 16 at 7:30 
p.m. In the Annenberg Auditorium, and a seminar led by Capa and Phillips on Septem­ber 17. 
Guided Gallery Tours will be available for museum visitors who wish to know more about the exhibit. Tours begin In the O'Shaughnessy Gallery and are 45 minutes in length. Upcoming tour dates are September 13 and October 4. 
"To see life; to see the world; to eyewitness great events; to watch the faces of the poor and the gestures of the proud; to see strange things machines, armies, multitudes, shadows in the jungle and on the moon; to see man's work" is part of the prospectus that "Life" created to shape its first Issues. This theme Is carried through the exhibit which contains some of the most dramatic and Influential photos of the time period. 
The magazine was first pub­lished as a weekly on November 23, 1936. The last weekly issue was published on December 29, 1972. Monthly editions began in October, 1979. A 1948lssue cost 20 cents with a yearly subscrip­tion at $6. 
The "Life" exhibit Is one of several exhibits featured at the Snlte each year. Museum hours are Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Sunday I p.m. to 4 p.m., and Thursday 10 a.m to 8 p.m.. The museum 
is closed on Mondays and major holidays. Admission free.  all Is

NEW YORK -Cris Carter, the Ohio State wide receiver made eligible for a supplemen­tal NFL draft after admitting taking payments from agents, has been barred from working out for scouts at league facilities, his lawyer said Wed­nesday. 
NFL spokesman Dick Max­well said the league had noth­ing to do with the ban. 
Mitch Frankel, a lawyer with a Boston-based firm called Im­pact, said Carter had planned to work out Tuesday at the Hoosierdome in Indianapolis, but had been barred by officials at the arena, home of the NFL's Colts. Earlier, Frankel said, workouts in St. Louis and at the Cowboys facility in Dallas had been called off. 
"We just can't seem to find a suitable facility. We don't get much cooperation any way we turn," said Frankel, who added that Carter might have to per­form for the scouts informally at a park or vacant lot. The Hoosierdome was the workout

setting last January for players eligible in last spring's draft. 
Carter, an All-American as a junior, had been considered a possible first-round draft choice next season. 
He petitioned the NFL for ad­mission after being ruled in­eligible for the 1987 college season. He admitted he ac­cepted a $5,000 loan from player agents Norby Walters and Lloyd Bloom in May, 1986 and subsequently accepted $1,800 more from them. 
The NFL, citing the threat of a lawsuit, announced last week it would "reluctantly" hold a supplemental draft this Friday for Carter and Charles Glad­man, a Pitt running back who lost his eligibility for refusing to cooperate with an investiga­tion of agents. 
The league said Tuesday that four other players would be el­igible for selection Friday: Dan McFadden, a defensive back from Miami; Paul Miller of Illinois Valley Community College, whose position is un­known; Marquis Pleasant, a wide receiver from Southern Methodist; and Chester Savoie, a defensive back from Nicholls State. 
Maxwell said none of the four had been illegally involved with agents but added that he didn't know why they had peti­tioned for the draft. The league customarily holds several sup­plemental drafts a year for players who have completed their school work or used up their eligiblity in some other fashion. 
But the announcement of the Carter-Gladman draft set off a storm of protest among college coaches, some of whom said they were considering barring NFL scouts from their cam­puses. They claimed that by al­lowing the players to be drafted, the NFL was tacitly condoning illegal activities. 
The league claimed it had no option because the colleges had declared the players profes­sionals and it could not deny them the means to try to earn a living. 
Ten NFL teams have already said they won't participate in the supplemental draft.

Bennett seeks pact similar to Bosworth 
Associated Press 
ANDERSON, Ind. In­dianapolis Colts owner Robert Irsay and the agent for holdout rookie linebacker Cornelius Bennett will meet for contract talks within the next week, Jim Irsay, general manager of the NFL team, said Wednesday. 
Jim lrsay, speaking to reporters while the Colts prac­ticed at Anderson College, said his father had recently telep­honed agent Richard Woods and that the two had "a good conversation." The two agreed to meet perhaps as early as Friday, but no later than Wed­nesday in Chicago, Jim Irsay said. 
The Colts withdrew their most recent contract proposal, valued at $4 million with incen­tives over five years, at the end of June, after Woods was quoted as saying he wanted the linebacker from Alabama to receive a contract worth a single dollar more than that given Brian Bosworth, the rookie linebacker out of Okla­homa. Bosworth recently signed with Seattle for $11 mil­lion over 10 years. 
Woods said Monday he still wanted Bennett to receive a contract comparable to Bos­worth's. Jim Irsay, however, said the Colts would be reluc­tant to sign such a long-term pact. 
"I wouldn't rule anything out, but I would say that doesn't make a lot of sense to us," Ir­say said. "I think we can do something to satisfy everyone if he (Woods) is willing to be flexible." 
"We'd be starting at Square A," Irsay added. 
The Colts, meanwhile, released three players Wednes­day, leaving their roster at 66 heading into their first home 
preseason game against Hous­
ton Saturday night in the 
Hoosier Dome. 
Released were defensive end Booker Reese, a free agent from Bethune Cookman; nose tackle Isaac Williams, a free agent from Florida State, and wide receiver Byron Williams, a free agent from Texas­Arlington. 
Sixty-four players are con­sidered healthy enough to play against Houston, Coach Ron Meyer said, but probably only 45 to 47 will see extensive ac­tion. 
Meyer said he is attempting to "project who will make the final roster." 
Meyer is planning for a 45­man roster even though a new labor agreement might in­crease that number. 
"I think you have to plan for 45 and anything after that is a bonus," said Meyer. 
Meyer said the Oilers, who like the Colts are 1-1, will pose a good test for his team's of­fense. 
"Houston is very much an improved team," he said. "They're very much a pressing 
team, a very aggressive team. They like to make the big play defensively. They very easily could be 2-0 in preseason play.'' 
Meyer is looking to improve his team's success rate on third downs. The Colts have con­verted only seven of 31 third downs (22.6 percent). The coach said the conversion rate is even worse on third downs with more than 1 yard to go. 
"It's a horror show," Meyer said. "All three of our turn­overs (two fumbles, one inter­ception) have come in third­and-long, and a majority if not all of our sacks have occurred in those situations."

Mark Duper and the high-powered Miami pass-England Patriots in the AFC East this year. ing game will be gunning for the favored New 
Patriots overwhelming choice to capture AFC East title 
Associated Press 
FOXBORO, Mass. -Passing should be the focus in the AFC East this season. Passing the football, not passing the Patriots. 
In a division loaded with strong quarterbacks, weak defenses and questionable run­ning attacks, New England fig­ures to have little trouble repeating as champions. 
"As far as overall depth, we definitely are in the driver's seat," says Bill McPeak, the Patriots' pro scouting director. "I don't know how you could pick against this ballclub." 
New England, with the top­ranked pass defense in the AFC last season, is best equipped to handle the division's quarter­backs. Indianapolis, Buffalo and the New York Jets were the NFL's three worst teams against the pass, while Miami allowed the seventh most throwing yards. 
The Dolphins, behind quar­terback Dan Marino, had the league's top passing attack last year. New England, with Tony Eason, was fourth. New York, with Ken O'Brien, was ninth. 
They have some dangerous receivers to throw to -Stanley Morgan and Irving Fryar in New England, Mark Duper and Mark Clayton in Miami and AI 
NDSMC 
Toon and Wesley Walker in New York. 
In Buffalo, quarterback Jim Kelly should benefit from his first full training camp with the Bills. In Indianapolis, Gary Hogeboom guided the Colts to victories in their last three games after missing 11 weeks with a shoulder injury. 
The division's running games are not as potent. 
New England was last in the NFL in rushing yards last season. Miami had the fewest carries. Indianapolis lost last season's top rusher, Randy McMillan, for the season when he was hit by a car last April. 
In the draft, Buffalo's top four choices, Miami's top two, Indianapolis' first and three of the Jets' first four were defen­sive players. 
The Dolphins figure to start the same secondary that con­tributed to their weak pass defense last year, while the Bills expect to have at least two new starters in the defensive backfield. 
The Patriots' secondary, featuring Raymond Clayborn, should stay the same and could be helped by the return of de­fensive end Ken Sims, a poten­tially strong pass rusher, from back surgery. 
page 11 

Moreover, New England's division rivals are hurt by in­jury. 
Marino should be ready for the season opener with the Patrots after dislocating a finger in the opening exhibition game. But linebacker John Of­ferdahl, who made the Pro Bowl as a rookie last year, is gone for at least the first six games with a torn btcep. 
The Jets are missing defen­sive stars Joe Klecko, Marty Lyons and Lance Mehl and McMillan leaves the Colts with­out much of a running game. 
Holdouts by first-round draft choices -linebacker Cornelius Bennett in Indianapolis and de­fensive lineman John Bosa in Miami -won't help either. 
New England has great depth at nearly every position and new faces should improve its ground attack. 
Correction 
Because of an editing er­ror, a headline in yester­day's issue incorrectly said that Alvin Miller has been declared ineligible for foot­ball. Miller chose not to use his fifth year of eligibility.
