River City Records 
O-wner adlllits to Who ticket fraud 
Reeves concludes democracy is improving 
By DIANE DIRKERS and MARK WORSCHEH 
SeniorStaffReporters 
The owner of River City Records admitted last night that he had planned to use tickets sold by unaut· horized "ticket brokers" as part of his Oct. 5 and Dec. 8 Who concert bus packages. 
The packages. offered for S49, each included a reserved seat for the performance in Chicago's Rosemont Horizon. round-trip bus transporta­tion from South Bend and refresh­ments. Peter Kernan. River City's proprietor, had sold 280 packages for the first show and 100 for the 
second. He cancelled both bus trips within two days of the scheduled concerts. 
KathyJohnson -a representative ofCot ntemporary Productions ofSt. Louis, the promoter of the Who's Chicago shows -said yesterday that Kernan "had no way at all to get that many tickets without getting any permission from us, and he never did.·· 
According to Johnson, tickets were sold on a mail-order basis only, with a six-ticket limit on any order. Blocks oftickets were distributed to some radio stations, hut only with the approval of Contemporary Productions, said Johnson.

In 1831. Alexis de Tocqueville saw America as a successful democracy, troubled by racism, but getting better all the time. 
And in 1982, syndicated political columnist Richard Reeves sees America in much the same way. 
Reeves came to this conclusion in 19~9 after completing a modern version of de Tocqueville's famous nineteeth-centurv journey to study American democracy. De Toc­queville was a noted French political philosopher. 
Ket:ves, columnist. author, and writer for New Yorker magazine, reflected on his modern JOurney last night in a lecture in the Library Auditorium. 
Whtle prt:paring for the tour, Reeve" studied 14 notebooks .md numerous letters that de Toc­queville wrote while making his 9· month journey. Reeve~ said de Tocqueville is most famous for the hook ht: wrote about the trip, Democracy in Amenca, but the notebooks present the more descriptive impressions of de Toc­queville. 
Reeves took the same journey as de.: Tocqueville and put the same questions to the modern counter­parts of the Americans de Toe: queville questioned. 
Like de Tocqueville, Reeves concluded that "there is such·a thing as an 'American.' The characteristics and values are the same ones de Toc­queville saw ...Ther(" were no 'good old days."' 
De Tocqueville found the latest newspapers in homes on the American frontier, according to the columnist. In comp.t.·bon, Rcc.-cs found "Eskimos watching 60 Minutes, talking about Mike t Wallace) and Morley (Safer) ...then going back to their -IBM terminals." 
Reeves said that a traditional Sun­da} Catholic Mass in Alaska con­vinced him that "this is America." He found the same dress, language, spirit, and habits along his journey. 
Secondly, Reeves concluded that the U.S. is among the world's most stable societies and that American democracy is indeed working very well. 
"Democracy may not be doing what individuals want it to do, but the will of the major translates into life, liberty, and happiness" 
Reeves emphasized that com-

Athletic department 
'willing to share' bill 
By ANNE MONAS1YRSKI 
Senior StaffReporter 
Although the Athletic Department said it will pay the bill for 
damages to the Transpo buses incurred after the Pitt game, the depart­
ment is "willing to share it (the bill) with the studentbody, according 
toJoe O'Brien, assistant director and business manager ofathletics. 
Father John Van Wolvlear, vice president of student affairs an­
nounced at last Tuesday's Hall President's Council meeting that 
O'Brien would pay the damages incurred by the students. 
Said O'Brien, "we've had a good long-term relationship with 
Transpo. When a bill comes. we're going to pay it." 
O'Brien said that he will wait for Student Body President Lloyd 
Burke to approach him on the matter ofsharing the cost. 
Burke stands bv the Student Senate's decision not to pay the bill 
because of the "ri~k" involved. He believes that ifthe student govern­
ment paid for the damages, the act would "set a precedent" holding 
student government accountable for any student action, regardless of 
who sponsored the event. 
See SENATE, page 4 
"Nobody legitimate" would be able to supply that many tickets to Kernan, she added, "It's a scam." 
After cancelling the Oct. 5 trip, Kernan offered his customers a choice ofeither a full refund or first priority to purchase bus trip packages for the Dec. 8 concert. 
Kevin Finger, a sophomore from St. Ed's, said that he still was waiting for a refund from Kernan for the Oc­tober trip. 
'Three of us got tickets together for the concert," he said. "When we went to get our refund, he said to wait, call hack later and then we'd have the money. He (Kernan) later gave us a check for S 14..., for all three tickets. 
"When we went to get it cashed, it bounced," Finger continued. "The bank said he had no money to cover it. 
"We still don't have any money from him and are seeking legal recourse," he said. 
Kernan replied that he thought most people already had received and cashed their refund checks. "It's not my fault that several hit the bank after the account was closed," he said. 
Others who received refund checks found that they only could he cashed at St. joseph's Bank, where River City holds its account. Accord­ing to Pat Toole, a junior from Stan­ford Hall, "Kernan gave us a check which we had to take to his bank and have the president OK it."

Canadian strikers 

Chrysler reaches tentativepact 
HIGHLAND PARK Mich. (AP)­The Chrysler Corp. and the auto workers' union reached tentative agreement yesterday on an im­mediate wage increase that paves the way for an end to a t1ve-week-old Canadian strike and the signing of a new contract for U.S. workers. 
United Auto Workers Union Presi­dent Dougias A. Fraser said at a news conference that he was optomistic that the 85,000 U.S. Chrysler workers would accept the new offer. 
"The Chrysler (bargaining) com­mittee voted unanimously to recom­mend the terms of a new economic agreement to the members," Fraser said. 
''I'm glad it's over," added Thomas Miner, Chrysler vice president ofin­dustrial relations. 
Neither side would detail terms of the agreement, although Fraser said there is a "big difference" between the U.S. and Canadian pacts. 
Agreement on the Canadian terms had been announced yesterday morning in Toronto, and top negotiators immediately tlew back to Detroit to complete the U.S. talks. 
UAW bargainers also had refused to reveal the size ofthe Canadian pay raise, but earlier this week they had rejected 30 cents an hour, saying the rank and file demanded at least S 1 an hour. 
The raise, negotiated in talks that began Nov. 22, was "substantial," said Ken Gerard, president of the Canadian UAW bargaining commit­tee. "We're happy to see that the company came here with the amount of money that we were looking for. I'm sure the member­ship will ratify it without any problem." 
U.S. workers wanted at least a 50 cent an hour boost, local union offi­cals said. 
Ratification voting for the 10,000 Canadian Chrysler workers was tentatively scheduled for Saturday and Sunday and the striking Canadian auto workers should be able to return to work Monday, Robert White, director of the Canadian UAW said at a Toronto news conference. 
Fraser said U.S. local unir·n offi­
cials would decide when to hold 
ratification votes. 
"We don't have to hurry," he 
added. 
About 4,600 U.S. Chrysler workers were laid off because of parts shortages from the Canadian strike, and they probably will return two or three days after Canadian plants resume operation, Miner said. 
The two sides planned to con­tinue bargaining late yesterday and meet again today to finish up any loose ends, officials said. 
The last push at Chrysler head­quarters in Highland Park began a few hours after UAW and Chrysler officials in Toronto announced agreement on economic terms for a Canadian pact. 
Fraser, who along with Miner had tlown to Toronto on Wednesday, said yesterday morning he felt the Canadian economic terms would be "a basis" for a U.S. accord. 
'They just have lO find the money to make the l"nited States' adapta­tion to thi~ (Canadian) agreement," Fraser said. 
"It's been a very difficult set of negotiations and the economic settlement satisfies us," said White. 
"We are pleased to have arrived at an agreement ... which will end this long and costly strike by our Canadian employees," Miner said. "I think it will become readily ap­parent that the parties have used some ingenuity." 
Canadian workers walked out Nov. 5 when Chrysler said it could not afford to give them an im­mediate raise. U.S. workders ­43,200 on the payroll and 42,200 on indefinite layoff-had demanded an immediate wage increase but voted against a strike and in favor ofresum­ing talks later. 
The latest roun t d oftalks begin­ning Nov. 22 was designed to reach agreements simultaneously in the 
U.S. and Canada. 
Earlier U.S. talks snagged over the pay raise issue Oct. 18 and negotia­tions broke off. Canadian talks had ended Nov. 5. 
Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca said last week that Canadian workers must be back on the job by Monday or Chrysler would recess talks in Canada and the United States until January. He said it would not be worthwhile to resume Canadian production briefly before the tradi­tional weeklong Christmas shut­
down, when workers look forward to six paid days off.

Leon Jaworski, former special prosecutor for the Watergate burglary incident and former Texas lawyer, died yester­day afternoon of an apparent heart attack while chopping wood at his "Circle]" Ranch in Wimberley, Texas. He was 77. Jaworski en­tered into national prominence when he was selected to be special Watergate prosecutor in October of 1973, replacing Archibald Cox at the request ofAxexander Haig. OnJuly 24, 1974,Jaworski played a key role in ordering President Richard M. Nixon to surrender the White House tape recordings, an event considered to be the apex of his career. Sixteen days later, Nixon resigned the presidency. While being a veteran lawyer in Texas before the Watergate investigation, Jaworski never returned to the courtroom after the Watergate. Jaworski was born on Waco, Texas in 1905. He became the youngest lawyer ever licensed in the state at age 20. Jaworski served as a prosecutor in the Nuremburg Trials after World War II, and also served as counsel to the Warren Commission's investigation into the assassination of Presdent John F. Kennedy. -AP 
A large hippopotamus statue surprised residents of Muskegon, Mich., when it appeared in the spot usually taken by a large bull statue. Sometime early Wednesday, pranksters abducted 
the life-size fiberglass Angus bull statue that stood watch outside the 
Black Angus Restaurant. "Apparently, someone got in (our) building 
with a key and switched our hippo for the Black Angus' Bull," said Bob Sikkenga, president of a design company that owns the hippo. "The hippo is frequently used in parades all over the country and it comes and goes so often that I frequently don't know where it is." Authorities said the restaurant's bull often is snatched by teen-agers as a prank. But Wednesday was the first time in memory that the figure has been upstaged by competing wildlife. -AP 
Good grades in schoolare being rewarded at two video game arcades in Alpena, Mich. by promoters who have given away S1 ,500 in tokens to young scholars in a week. School officials seem resigned to the plan. "We want to encourage the kids with good grades to come in," Betty Ruczynski, operator with her hus­band Jerry ofTWI Big Operation arcades, said this week. "They are the ones who don't make trouble, and we like to have them in here." Students can bring in report cards and get five 25-cent tokens for every A and two tokens for every B. No rewards are given for lower grades. High school and junior high students must present school identification cards along with report cards. Elementary students, who don't have the cards, must bring a parent. "We like to encourage parents to visit," said Mrs. Ruczynski, "so they can see it's a nice place for their kids to be." Alpena High School Principal David Clink said he appreciates "anyone in the business community recognizing good grades in a special way. I'm ambivalent about video game arcades because of the amount of money the children spend there, but I suppose it's better than spending it on cigarenes." "Encouragement and praise are more effective" than video game tokens in motivating students toward "sustained efforts" for better grades, said Joseph Mischley, principal ofThunder Bay Junior High.

Ah, Christmas 
Ah, Christmas. 

I love Christmas. This time of year always brings vi­sions of silting in front of the tlreplace at home, curled up with a nice,· sweet girl. A bottle of wine sits on the table close w us, and we are very quiet as we sit and watch the Christmas lights burn on the tree. The smell of pine fllls the room and Johnny Mathis sets the mood by gently singing "Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire." Outside, the snow lightly falls, covenng the ground with yet another layer of lluffy snow. The evening would be perfect if we could just hear the prancing of little hooves on the roofabove. 
Somehow, things aren't exactly the same this year. 
Christmas doesn't bring the same feelings of happiness 
and contentment. This year I sit under a high-intensity 
lamp. curled up with Hans Kung text. A now-warm 
bottle ofMountain Dew sits on the table next to me; the 
mood set by two of my roommates arguing over the 
name of a long-canceled television series. From next door, the gentle sounds ofVan Hal en softly drift into the room. We don't have a tlreplace, and even ifwe did, we couldn't burn our chestnuts over it because the Univer­sitv made us install a smoke alarm last month. Outside, it ha~ finally gotten a little cold, but the ground is still muddy from the previous

seems that nothing but problems can develop from run­

First of all, even the lucky students who manage to 
return home a few days before the rest ofus are having a

campus. The tree in the window and the mistletoe han­ging from the loft (though it never seems to work) are simple ways ofmaking the best ofthe situation, and they do make Christmas seem closer, despite the fact that it is at least four finals away. 
But the real way of bringing the Christmas season to campus is to usher in the spirit of Christmas. This is truly a joyous time of year, no matter how hard your professors try to make you believe otherwise. To keep Christmas the special time of year that it is, and to prepare yourself for the Christmas season at home, spread a little Christmas cheer around campus. Take a special trip to the grotto to remember what Christmas is really all about, or wish someone a Merry Christmas, even if it is your professor who gives you that last final exam. And if you're really daring, prove to those poor 
 mistletoe buyers around campus that those silly things 
really work. By the way, Merry Christmas.

1'0:\TIAC. :\1ich. (AP) -Former Team~ter~ President James R.· Hoffa can he legally pre~umed dead. more than !>even years after he vanished from the parking lot of a suhuran lktroit reMaurant, under a judge's ruling. 
Oakland County Probate Judge 
:"'orman Barnard said Wednesday 
that Hoffa's "presumptive date of 
death" was July 30. 19H2, seven 
year~ to the day after he disap­
peared. 
At the time of his disappearance, Hoffa reportedly was planning a hid to regain the presidency of the na­tion's largest labor union following his release from prison. FBI agents have said in court papers they believe he was the victim of an ex­
ecution by organized crime t1gures. 
Hoffa, convicted of jury tamper­ing and mail fraud in 1964, went to the federal prison in Lewisburg, Penn.. in March of 1967. He was sen­tenced to 13 years but was pardoned by then-President Richard Nixon in December of 1971 with the restric­tion that he not participate in Teamsters Union activities until 1980. 
Barnard's ruling was in response to a petition filed by James P. Hoffa, 41, the labor leader's son. Barnard named the younger Hoffa and his sis­ter, Barbara Ann Crancer, heirs to Hoffa's estimated JI million estate and named the younger Hoffa per­sonal repesentative of his father's estate. 
The elder Hoffa's wife, Josephine, died in 1980. No will from Hoffa was found. 
The younger Hoffa testified to three specific criteria that are re­quired under state law before a per­son can be presumed dead, Oakland County Probate Register William Travis said. 
The criteria are that Hoffa be ab­sent from his last place of residence for seven years, that his whereabouts be unknown for seven years by people who were likely to know them, and that Hoffa did not communicate during that period with people he was most likely to communicate with, Travis said. 
In another three years, Hoffa, who

The younger Hoffa petitioned the court in July for a pre~umr,tion of death. and a notil:e was published once a month for four months to notify anyone who may have claims to the estate. None has been made. 
The FBI continues to investigate Hoffa's disappearance. FBI spokes­manjohn Anthony said Wednesday.

plaints must be taken in stride. "Not many people are trying to leave this country and many more are trying to get in," he said. 
Reeves, like de Tocqueville. found racism to be the greatest problem facing America. Racism in de Toc­queville's day, however. was directed toward the American In­dians, according to Reeves, while minorities are the victims today. 
While traveling through Detroit on his journey, Reeves began to see the inner city as "a foreign country, with an underground economy and laws." He characterized social workers as diplomats and the main export as crime. 
Reeves sees liquors and drugs used as pacifiers in these areas, but he views the American Dream is the greatest pacifier. The minorities "believe the words and ideas," said Reeves and "import" hope. 
Reeves remains hopeful about the possibilities of dealing with racism. "Being American is believing we can be better as a people than we see ourselves," he said. 
Democracy is getting better Reeves concluded from his journey. 
America, however. is moving toward "mass" democracy. Americans have learned that "representative government couldn't deal with the problems ...We don't go . to politicians, we go to the courts." 
One man Reeves encountered on his trip concluded that that this trend in American democracy is not wholly bad. "The people are happy," quoted Reeves, "if there were one demigogue, we'd be in trouble. But there are so many, they cancel each other out." 
Reeves views modern America as being democracized by electronic communication. "Leaders are losing the ability to control communica­tion," he said," ...we (the public) get the information at the same time as the president_" 
Reeves is the author of a number of books, including A Ford, Not A Lincoln, Old Faces of 1976, Con­vention, andjetlag. He also hosted the NBC television show "Sunday" from 1973 to 1977. 
Reeves re-enactment of de Toc­queville's journey is the basis of a television program he is working on for Public Broadcasting. The show will be aired in the spring.

Jo0d behavior 


Michigan eyes prisoners' law-s 

LAl":O.ll'<l, .vtiCh. ( AP) -Time off from prison for good behavior ­eliminated for many criminals by state voters in 1978 -would be available again to all inmates under two bills that cleared the state House yesterday. 
Under the legislation, which now goes to the Senate, inmates not now eligible for "good time" credit could get up to a week lopped oiHheir sen­tences for each month of good con­duct behind hars. 
When voter~ passed Proposal B in 1978, they barred "good time" for inmates convicted of assaultive ccimes and most crimes against property. 
All inmates previously were eligible for up to 22 days offfor each month ofgood behavior. 

The proposed scaled-down sys· tern of "disciplinary credits" is meant to encourage good conduct among the most difficult inmates in Michigan prisons by giving them an incentive to behave. 
The bills, sponsored by Rep. Alan Cropsey, R-DeWitt, cleared the House on votes of-90-10 and 86-13 without debate. 
A three-fourths vote of the House, or H3 votes, was needed to pass each bill since they would amend legisla­tion by the voters. 
The new system is supported by the state Department of Correc­tions, Michigan sheriffs and police

chiefs, and state prison guards who hope it will help maintain order in the penal system. 
In addition, the Michigan Prison Overcrowding Project estimated the legislation could save the state up to s 196 million in future costs by hdping to control the population of the state corrections system. 
Oakland County Prosecutor L Brooks Patterson, who led the peti­tion drive that placed Proposal B on the 1978 state ballot. blasted it as an anempt to get around the will of the 
people~ 

l;nder the new plan, inmates denied "good time" could automati­cally earn five days of "disciplinary credit" for each month in which they committed no major miscon­duct. 
They could win another two days of credit for any month in which ther behavior was especially good. 

House Corrections Committee Chairman Jeffrey Padden. D­Wyandotte, who helped guide the bills to passage, admitted they face an uphill battle in the state Senate, since little time remains before the lame-duck legislature adjourns. 
Supporters ofthe legislation main­
tain that voters were misguided into 
believing that passage of Proposal B 
would reduce crime by barring ex­
cessive leniency for felons.

The Notre Dame Credit Union would not cash any of River City's checks. 
Kernan had told The Observer Monday that he had reserved three buses from Indiana Motor Bus Co., but a representative for the com­pany said that no reservations were made. Last night, Kernan claimed he had spoken with a dispatcher for the company two to three weeks before the Dec. 8 concert, informing him that he may need buses, but ad­mitted that no formal reservations had been made. 
"In practice, I had the ability to get the buses even as late as the day ofthe trip," Kernan said. 
Kernan cancelled the first trip af­ter his ticket source hacked out ofan alleged verbal contract. He blamed the upcoming video telecast of a Who concert in Stepan Center for a rash of cancellations of the Dec. 8 package. He said that only 35 people remained committed to the trip. 
Kernan said that if he could not put together a bus package for the Dec. 8 concert, he did not want to sell the tickets at a scalper's markup. 
Though he said he was purchasing tickets at inflated prices from a Chicago ticket broker, he com­mented, "I was not interested in sell· ing tickt;ts to customers over the counter. I chose not to handle tick­ets in that fashion," he said, claiming it would be "unethicaj." 
Kernan said he wanted to "keep his options open," and therefore, did not cancel the trip until Monday. '·Even when money is tight, a lot of business can be obtained right before the show." However, the last advertising that Kernan could recall placing was on radio station WAOR during the week of Thanksgiving, two weeks before the concert. 
"Why keep dumping money into 
the thing?" Kernan said. 
Kernan said that certified checks 
were being prepared and would be 
mailed this weekend to all who had 
purchased the Dec. 8 package. The 
checks should arrive early next 
week, he said.

Welcome to the world of cellular radio 
Were you the first person on your block to have a "Pong" game years ago? Did you buy a "Walkman" before they became a fad? Have you looked into getting a wide-screen televi-
Skip Desjardin On the Media , 
sion for the living room back home? Well, here's good news for you. The newest technological fad-to-be is cel­lular radio, and it's just around the corner. 
In the last month, the FCC has begun grant­ing licenses for cellularsystems -two in each major city. 
Cellular radio really has little to do with the kind of radio that plays the latest hits. It is a system ofremote telephones which will even­tually allow people to take their phone with them wherever they go. 
The concept is similar to that of today's increasingly common cordless phones. It's also similar to the concept of "beepers," the paging devices that doctors wear on their belts. 
But it's significantly different than both. 
By 1990, experts estimate, upwards of 3 million people could be carrying telephones the size of a pack of cigarettes. Computers would seperate calls, and expanded fre­quency capabilities would allow the calls to reach their intended recipients. 
But don't rush to your stockbroker, folks. Cellular radio just isn't going to make the big leagues. 
Do you know anyone who's made a bundle investing in companies that make phones for cars? Do you know anybody who actually bas a phone in their car? Have you ever been in a car with a phone? 
So what makes communication industry ob­servers think things will be any different this time around? It doesn't seem to make sense, given developments to this point. 
In most cities, callers can get a service known as "call forwarding." With a quick punch of the buttons, a housewife can receive all her calls at the bridge club meeting, a busi­nessman can be reached at his lawyer's office. Between one place and the next, each can make calls from the car. 
If one is a frequent airline customer, many flights now offer in-flight phone calls. 
In short, the territory is covered already. There just isn't a large enough market to make cellular radio a big profit item. 
AT&T and GTE have the most outstanding license applications, and MCI is third. But even these giant corporations see little money in the venture. One telecommunications analyst predicts that even MCI, by far the smal­lest of the three companies will profit by way of cellular radio to the tune of no more than 10 percent oftotal net earnings. 
So take some advice. Ifyou really feel a need to own a go-anywhere phone, hold your breath -it's on the way. But if your looking for a sinart investment, keep looking into the wide-screen television for the living room back home. 
Publicly sanctioned homicide 
At 12:16 AM on December 8, 1982, the heart of Charles Brooks stopped beating. Brooks did not die from natural causes or an unfortunate accident; he was executed by an injection of a lethal drug. The decision was made by the legal instruments ofsociety after

Friday Analysis 
they had determined that he was guilty ofkill­mg David Gregory in I976. The drug induced ·execution was supposed to be a "humane 
way" to carry out a most inhuman act. 
My first reaction was one of shock and outrage. Norma Morrison, the mother of David Gregory, said after the execution, "Now there is some hope in this society for victims." Unfortunately, the execution suggests the complete opposite for victims and society as a whole. One man was dead; taking the life of another will neither bring him back nor make up for his death. Even more disturbing is the fact that the prosecuting attorney who con­vinced the jury to give Charlie Brooks the death penalty, Jack Strickland, is not sure that the state ofTexas executed the right man. 
It's all academic now because two lives have been taken. both unnecessarily. the sad thing is that the second death could easily have been prevented. In all of the righteous talk about law and order, it seems that we have forgotten the immortal words of Thomas Jef­ferson when he wrote in the n Declaration of Independence about an unalienable right called life. Also forgotten seems to be the Con­stitutional Amendment in the Bill of Rights which guards against the use of cruel and un­usual punishment. A state sponsored execu­tion is clearly a violation of these two major pillars oflaw and society. 
Life is such a precious and mysterious quality that it is neither understood nor ap­preciated by human beings. I don't under­stand how the legal system can play God and determine that someone must die. What I find even sadder h is that we, as citizens of this societv, are all accomplices to a public sane­
tion tor murder through our passive accep­
tance ofthe death penalty. 
I've heard all ofthe rhetoric about the need 
for capital punishment as a means of maintain­
ing law and order in a hostile society. Capital 
punishment is supported by cruel and narrow 
minded people whose views on the topic can 
only increase the violence in society. It is 
NOT a deterrent to crime. 
All crimes can be broken down into three categories: crimes of passion, ·crimes which are premeditated, and accidental crimes. Capital punishment will prevent none of the from taking place. A crime ofpassion is carried out without ever looking at the conse­quences; it is perpetrated only because of the situation at a given point in time. A premeditated crime is committed by ·someone who feels he will not get caught. Again the the thought ofpossible punishment is not a factor. It is obvious that capital punish­ment will not prevent those quirks of fate 
which are accidental in nature. 
Capital punishment is dehumanizing. The only argument to support it which has some basis for truth is the fact that a convicted felan must be maintained in prison at great public expe11se. In other words, it is cheaper to kill someone than it is to incarcerate them...in dol­lars and cents that is. Fortunately I cannot put such a price tag on a human life. Its nature is too sacred to deal with on such a crass and unsympathetic level. 
By keeping someone behind bars for the rest of their lives, you make them LIVE with the consequences of what they have done. Also, you eliminate the possibility that society might kill the wrong man. A life sentence makes our legal system deal with an earthly act in an earthly way. There is only one defen­sible reason for killing someone and that is self-defense. By keeping someone in prison you prevent him from doing any harm to society. 
The use of capital punishment may appeal to the lowest level ofhuman civilization, but it is cruel, senseless, and part ofthe most savage elements which remain in humanity. In other words, capital punishment should be abolished forever. 
Jesus Christ can look at the present state of his institution and shake his head and say "you've missed the point, my 20th century friends." Catholicism has lost a lot in the trans­lation from principles to practice. 
The Church was meant to be a divine in-

stitution, yet when translated into human terms it becomes hierarchical. There is no­thing wrong with that. However, when the Church becomes such a bureaucracy that most ofits members feel that many ofits rules do not apply to them, it's time to bring the congregation and the hierarchical body back together. 
In a democracy, majority rules. Laws are enacted ranging from such major issues as murder and extortion to issues as miniscule as not parking on a street on odd-dated Tues­days. These laws are binding, but each case is illdi!lidual~v mterprt::ted in court. Interpreta­tions can be appealed. Most important of all, these laws can bechanged as easily as they are instituted. 
The Catholic Church also plavs the role of legislative body. Besides dol'trinal issues. there are regulations on evernhing from felony offenses to how soon bcti>re com­munion one can eat. Howe\er. unlike the lt::gislative system of a secular enun·. manv of 1he laws are never changed. ;md if the~ are it

takes centuries. 

 Inconsistencies in Catholic rules are dis­missed because of tradition (for example, why, in the 20th century, can't the Catholic Church accept female priests?) or, better yet, because the Pope is infallible. 
Here is an example of an inconsistency which has recent!~ been questioned repeatedly, only to be handed the answer "because the Pope says so." After reading editorial after editorial condemning and supporting birth control,-I took a little time to think. Is it really that big ofa deal? The rhythm method is okay, the pill isn't. On the other hand, abstinence because of the rhythm method is "a beautiful sacrifice". while total abstinence makes a marriage null. What's wrong? Is it a sin to "sacrifice" too much' 
Once, I talked to a priest about the inconsis· tencies I saw. "I believe the major doctrines," I said. "But there are so many little things that the Church makes rules on that I just can't ac­cept." I proceeded to name every one I could think of_ , .divorce and remarriage. birth con­trol. meat on Fridays ...the works. 
"That's okay," he replied. "The major em­pha~is of the Church is love. If you believe in God, and try to live the best you can, you can still claim yourself Catholic." He agreed, as many priests today do, with my feelings about birth control and divorce. 
So what's the point' The point is that there are manv Catholics today that have that same kind of conversation..md. in many case~. the priest re~pomb till' ~.tme way. !'hat ~hould make us all hapJ)\'. right? That\ enough. i~n·t n' We can dt~agree and still remain in the 
Church ... 

No, it's not enough. There's no reason why a Church founded by Jesus Christ to start a ideal, loving, "Kingdom on Earth" should be reduced to a political ball ofred tape. We Cat­holics spend so much time arguing over the minor technicalities that we lose sight of the ultimate earthly goal -a loving community. 
What can be done? First of a!l, many of the rules should be reviewed and de-emphasized or phased out altogether. Second -perhaps this is heresy because it does challenge the infallibility ofthe Pope, but nonetheless-the Church must admit that it can be wrong. 
It's time for the Catholic Church to step away from the rule books and the political bureaucracy of the Vatican and relate once again to the congregation. 
Baltimore catechism states "the Church is its people." If only the many confused Cat­holics of the world could really believe that ...

ere's the movie column you've all been waiting for. Yes, it is once again time for the best movies ofthe year -in my opinion at least. This year, more than any other, I feel as though I might be doing more ofa service than just giving Notre Dame a guided tour of the left side of my brain. With the substantial increase 

Dennis Chalifour 
movie review 
ofcable TV movie channels in America's living rooms, the oppor­tunity for the public to see some of the year's best movies has also in­creased. Maybe you'll get to see 
what I'm talking about. 
In addition, I should also state that this list represents selections I've made according to the movies I've seen. Diva, Lola, and,Bob, le F/am­beur might very well have been mar­velous films, but I've never had the chance to see them. 
In any case, not to see you chewing on your finger nails in an­ticipation (ifyou'll try to get a drum roll going in your head), here, in al· phabetical order, are my selections for the five best films of 1982: 
Burden ofDreams, Diner, E. T.: The Extra Terrestrial, Fitzcarraldo, and.'11issing. 
A lot of you might be wondering how I ever came up with such a diverse lot offilms. Well, as you may very well have already guessed, I've got an explanation all set. 
Many film historians argue that most film developed from two major roots. The Lumiere Brothers made some ofthe first commercial films in the 1890's featuring single shot cinematic events such as Train Arriving at Station and Workers force behind the Canzonet section, the contrast to Wilson's trombone in the Fantasia section and the blend of the Ayre section. The "Trio" was one ofthe most engaging selections of 
tht: entire program. Zwerneman's 
horn stated a theme to which Bryant 
and Wilson responded in tandem. 
These alternations were crisply per­
formed, giving the piece clarity and 
a defined shape. 
Closing out the program were two rag pieces, "The Chevy Chase" by). Hubert Blake and "The Junk Man Rag" by C. Luckyth Roberts. The xylophone in the former piece and the sliding trombone ofthe lat­ter dominated and energized the rest ofthe ensemble to create an at· mosphere filled with the vibrancy of a dance hall. These were two ex­emplary selections with which to close the half hour recital. They proved the versatility ofthe en­semble while drawing the audience into the enjoyment with which they performed. 
The Saint Mary's Wind Ensemble showed that they are capable of performing an extensive repertoire despite their size and imbalance in numbers. Bryant would like to en­courage any interested instrumen· talists to join their ensemble. 

l:)erforming music ranging from r Elizabethan chamber pieces to ragtime, the Saint Mary's Wind En­semble demonstrated yesterday af­ternoon that the quality of performance need not be sacrificed in order to present an assortment of musical styles. The 13-member en· 
Tcui Brown 
music review 

semble, conducted by Dorothy Bryant, participated in five of the seven selections while the two remaining pieces required three brass instrumentalists on trumpet, trombone and french horn. 
John O'Reilly's "Idyllwild Fan­tasy" opened the program, and with Jane Zwerneman's horn solo, set the qualitative standard for the rest of the program. Two singular and dis­tinctive sounds were pursued by the flute and horn sections, creating a contrasting yet simply layered sound. As the piece progressed and the rest of the ensemble joined in, the music seemed to take on the quality ofa theme song from awes­tern television show; very rhythmic, rich and rounded in tonal quality. 
There were a few precision errors that created a perceptible dis­sonance in this ensemble theme, but such mistakes were forgiveable in light ofthe demands of the piece. The ensemble, small as it was, was able to unify the sound ofthe various instruments and present a wholistic 
piece of music. 
Conductor Bryant explained that "flexible arranging," a technique which enables every part to be covered by a variety ofinstruments, was employed in Bach's "Prelude and Fugue." There was a con­siderable difference in character in the two sections. Bach's prelude seemed to burden the instrumen­
talists, causing them to strive more for accuracy of technique while sacrificing the natural flow and character ofthe piece. At times it was apparent that there was a cer· tain amount ofhesitation on the part of the instrumentalists. The jux· taposition ofthe various parts lacked cohesion and clarity in rhythm. Whereas character was missing in the prelude, character was the propelling force behind the fugue. The layered tonal music was per· ti.Jrmed with excellent precision, particularly in the woodwinds. Ac­curacy seemed to be instinctive, allowing the musicians to provide 
be there. Most impressive was the ritard that concluded the piece; the timing seemed to communicated by feel. 
The finale to Haydn's "Farewell Symphony" can be a problematic piece of music to perform iffor no other reasOn than because ofits familiarity and the expectations imposed upon it by the audience. The ensemble was able to fulfill the expectations of most any listener. The alternating solo sections be­tween the horns and woodwinds were distinct, clean and functioned very well as statement/response. The woodwind section peaked in its performance, losing the edge and slight hesitation ofthe earlier pieces. The exit ofthe instrumentalists from the stage, beginning with the horns, left a sole percussionist striking a tri· angle on stage. This set up the two 
brass trio pieces to follow. 
Dorothy Bryant on trumpet, Jane Zwerneman on horn, and Mary Wit· son on trombone performed Thomas Morley's tripartite "Elizabethan Suite" and Vaclav Nel· hybel"s "Trio for Brass" with the precision and tluidity necessary for a trio sound to be complete. Bryant's trumpet seemed to propel the 
"Suite," providing the cohesive 
The best movies of 1982 

Lecwing the Lumiere Factory. In 
time audiences got bored with 
looking at simple real-time events. 
The basic filmic yearn of"show me your reality" has remained in many films. The urge for something different however, led to the success offilms such as those produced by Georges Melies. Melies was known 
for playing with his image in films likcA Trip to theMoon. This, in turn, marked the birth ofthe particularly cinematic experience known as "filmic reality", that reality which can only exist in films. 
All five of the films I have chosen for my best list succeed by showing us a reality that hovers between these two extremes. The most im­portant element they all share is the authentically human characters which people each ofthe films. 
Burden ofDreams: Although it is first in this list only by the grace of the "B" its title begins with, this Les Blank documentary may very well be at the top of many of the lists you'll be seeing this Christmas. (IfI were to have a gun pointed at my head while some maniac demanded that I choose just one best film, I think this one would do the trick. ) At the very least, it is certainly the best film I've ever seen about man as creator. 
Les Blank ha~ done more than just "the making ofaFitzcarraldo" flick. He shows us a particular reality, filmically yet truthfully enhanced. An artistic portrait ofan artist thwarted by his own humanity. Even then,Bu,·den ofDreams is more than just a portrait offilmmaker Werner Herzog -it is about (and very much recommended to) anyone who has ever attempted any­thing. 
Diner: Barry Levinson's elegy to the American Fifties garners a place on this list by the grace of what I thought was some of the best dialogue I've ever heard in the movies. There's not a word in this film that fails to ring true. In fact, the tilm seems more akin to the spirit of the Lumere Brothers than an actual documentary like Burden of Dreams. 
But don't get the idea that the home movies your dad took might also get a place on my list for their realistic qualities. Diner most im­portantly delves into themes ofmale camaraderie as successfully as anyone since Howard Hawks. (and, might I add, it was certainly nice to see male camaraderie portrayed in a framework outside of World War Two.) As I mentioned earlier this year, these characters are so aut­hentically human, they'll become a few ofyour best friends by the end of the film. 
E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial: When I tirst saw E. T., I never dreamed I'd have to make an argument for its place among the best films of the year. Box oftice success has a ten­dency to cloud vision. It is quite ob­viously the one tilm on this list closest to the spirit of Georges Melies. In fact, if Melics were alive today, I'm certain he'd chooseE. T. as one ofthe finest tilms ever made. No one can stake a claim as Steven Spiel­berg's better when it comes to manipulating tllmic reality. 
Exactly what makesE.T. succeed is the way in which the reality works. There is a theme ofbrotherly love here that is stripped to the bones and dressed in wonderful cinemati<.: imagery so that it b tested beyond any earthly limits and proven to work (Einstein would like this part) throughout the universe. What we are rooting for in this tilm goes beyond the soirit of human beings (it is the work of human beings that brings about destruc­tion), it repr<.:scnts life itself. 
What makesE.T. wholly different from any other motion picture on this list is the way in whiich it could work only as a motion picture.E.T. provdes us with a very strong argu­ment for the unique importance of tilm. 
Fitzcarraldo represents the massive dream with which filmmaker Werner Herzog is bur­dened. Herzog is the director most like the Lumiere Brothers in his technique. What makes Herzog's fil­mic images so strong is the way in which he insists upon making the images exist in the real world before committing them to tilm. What can you say about a twenty ton steam­ship being dragged up the side ofa mountain with the use ofpulleys, ropes, and a couple hundred natives? 
Fitzcarraldo is pure poetry capturing all the qualties ofBurden ofDreams plus a calculated dream world that slowly engulfs an audience like a hallucinogenic drug. 
Missing: Costa-c;arvas is the quin­tessential political tilmmaker. lie successfully takes documented facts and molds them into a slyly filmic reality ..Wissing might have have l'ct"n attempted by a lesser filmmaker in the form ofa straight docu-drama. Instead, Costa-(;arvas manipulates his audience with various versions ofthe truth, leading them toward discovery and letting them drop. It is the perfect form for a political narrative -filmic frustra­tion. 
Costa-Garvas manages to people the structural unreality ofMissing with real human charaters. (Jack Lemmon becomes one of the most truly American characters the movies have ever seen.) The frustra­tion is felt doubly..'11 issing is one 111m that certainly won't leave you talking about the popcorn.

The vi pet's sin 
H
ypocrisy is such an egregious sin -smacking of Pharisees puffed up with pride and legalisms, whom Our Lord denounced as a generation ofvipers ­that Iwas thrilled the mher day to read in the paper that one ofour priests ha..-. taken a hypocritical stand. Stu­dents don't sniffout hypocrisy the way they used to. In the old days, when Fr. Hesburgh was chairman of the Civil Rights Commission, articles were printed two or 
Rev. Robert Griffin 
letters to a lonely god 
three times a week proving him to be a whited sepulchre. Either the moral critics are failing in their powers ofdiscernment, or hypocrisy is losing its grip as. a clerical distraction. 
A hypocrite, says the dictionary, is pretending to be what he is not, or to feel what he does not feel; especial­ly, a pretense ofvirtue. Webster has more, but inves­tigators can read for themselves. Catechisms should be consulted, but I don't own a catechism that defines hypocrisy. My moral attentivelless is not perfect, you see, but I hope that does not appear to make me a sham. 
It is good to see the hypocrites shaken out oftheir high and mighty roost. Confront them on the streets, confront them on the beaches, with their holier-than­thou facades. A cleric is usually exposed to double jeopardy when he errs. Lay people only have to accuse themselves once: "Bless me father, -for I have sinned. I am guilty ofbeing a thief, a liar, a libertine, an idolator." Hypoocrisy is the priest's other sin; it never fails to be 
monstrously there. For example, a priest preaches the 
necessity of becoming a saint. He tells you that in the 
evening oflife, your greatest regrets will be your 
failures in love. By his fruits, you will know him. In his 
personal life, you find out, he's no paragon ofvirtue; he's 
big on hating. lie has given lip service to an ideal he 
doesn't practice himself. Casting him into the exterior 
darkness is too good for the likes ofhim. His hypocrisy 
entitles him to the unfailng attention of the worm that 
dieth never. 
Accusations of hypocrisy make me tremble, because 
it reminds me ofmy father's contempt for Catholics. He 
was a Methodist who said he preferred the company of 
adulterers and drunkard~ to hypocritical preachers 
who covered their faults with a cloak oflight. I gave up 
singing in the Congregational church choir; because of 
my father, it was too close to the altar for comfort. IfI 
talked back to my mother even once, he would mock 
me as a hypocrite who hurt his old lady's feelngs with 
rough words, and then went to church to chortle God's 
praises with those same sacrilegious lips. He hated my 
going to the seminary. Catholic priests were the arch­
hypocrites ofall, he thought, because as a boy, he had 
seen them drinking beer at Knights ofColumbus pic­
nics. He had heard stories oftheir twisting money out of poor widows for Masses to get their husbands' souls out ofpurgatory. My father was one ofthe best men I ever knew. It hurt him deeply to have a son who wanted to join the hypocrites' profession. 
Sadly enough for me, I have never felt like a hypocrite. The priests I know are rarely hypocritical. A few priests are saints, and a number became poor wretches. They wouldn't pull the wool over you eyes, because you could tell when you saw them that they are burnt-out cases. When you get to be my age, you respect the wonderful group you have grown old with. 
Some of us can't preach worth a damn. Some of us are 
overgrown jocks. We become cross with Catholics who 
blow away their chances. We nag the parishioners over 
the parish debt. Age or sickness make us timid, so that 
we feel threatened by change. We know Almighty God 
will forgive our sins; we're still trying to find the mercy 
with which we can forgive ourselves. We had expected 
to pray better, to believe more confidently, and to keep 
closer to the love which will not let us go, in the hide­
and-seek way that God has ofbeing endearing or 
exasperating. 

Apriest, ifhe's been around for twenty years or more, 
is probably not much better or worse than your own 
father. Saying Mass every day doesn't make a silk purse 
out ofa sow's ear, but it gives you pleasant dreams, and 
it fortifies your courage and sense of humor. 
It always seems to me that if a priest administrator 
fails, it means that he is a bad administrator rather than a 
bad prier. The Church expects her priests to make 
serious mistakes, and encourages them to go to confes­
sion with great regularity. Students are not always so 
patient about mistakes which may turn out to be honest 
differences in judgment. Yet the priests I know best are 
always grateful to the University family for the love we 
may or may not deserve, and for the respect we may not 
have earned. 

I would never quarrel in print with a student's 
opinion. I try to be faithful to alii believe, but I don't 
usually succeed. My sins are often obvious, not needing 
to be overlooked, because I am willing to be held 
responsible for my mistakes, though I decline to do 
public penance. Iwish you would go easy with the label 
ofhypocrite, and make sure the shoe fits before you ask 
some priest to wear it. Ifl play the hypocrite, I know my 
father's ghost will track me down at midnight to scold 
my conscience. 

Whatever the limitations of the Holy Cross order, I 
don't believe we qualify as Pharisees. Holy Cross love is 
the love that built the place. Each of us in the Com­
munity will go to heaven in single file, leaving Notre 
Dame behind us for others to serve. We take pride in 
being faithful to a great tradition while we're here. The 
weary priests and brothers asleep in our cemetery ­
many ofwhom wore out early -gave themselves the 
best they could in service to the campus. They went 
home to God, hopeful that He would praise them as 
good and faithful servants. 
Juggler: For closet intellectuals 
A n article in the November issue riD£Scholastic complains that in­tellectual intercourse at Notre Dame seems restricted to the un­natural and fluorescent-lit atmos­phere ofthe classroom. Pleading the case ofthose "closet intellectuals who, male or female, may discover 
ffiike Garvey 
features 
that finding other students with whom to share intellectual interests outside the classroom is no mean 
feat," the author admits that he has "sometimes opted to spend a Friday 
night dripping beer on my shoes 
rather than squinting at subtitles in 
the Snite Auditorium." 
The sincerity of the admission is admirable. but the dichotomy it assumes (that drinking on Friday night, which is enjoyable and which involves fellowship is one thing, while watching a foreign film, which is "intellectual" and therefore grim­ly necessary is quite another) is in­felicitous. Equally infelicitous is the conspicuous absence in the article ofany mention otjuggler, :'llotre Dame's superb literary magazine, whose editors and contributors type in America.

THEATRE 
The days ofarranged marriages have ended, but the literary and theatrical relics still survive. The tradition is that a spinster woman of the town surveyed available men and women, consulted their parents as to financial specifications, including dowries and in­heritances, and proposed a marital "coalition" based on her research. The matchmaker, as she was called, became immortalized in literature as far back as 1835 inA Day Well Spent byJohn Oxen­ford. In the twentieth century, Thornton Wilder chose this theme which subsequently has become the theme of Broadway musicals, Fiddler on the Roofindirectly and Hello, Dolly directly. Wilder's farce, The Matchmaker continues this weekend and next weekend at the South Bend Civic Theatre, 701 Portage Avenue. Tonight, tomorrow night, and Dec. 16, 17 and 18 the company will take the stage at 8 p.m. For more information, call 234-5696 or 233-0683. 
DANCE 

Earlier this semester, a proposed Ballroom Dance class was can­celled. Apparently, lack ofinterest was not the reason for such recourse. Tonight in the Chautauqua Ballroom, the Student Union will sponsor a Ballroom Dance and dance lessons. For those ofyou who cannot remember the days ofthe Fox Trot, the Box Step or the dances that became the rage in the marathon days ofthe thirties, Dan O'Day of the Dan O'Day Dance Studio, will give lessons starting at 8:30p.m. At the end of the instruction period, approximately 9:30 p.m., Mr. O'Day and his partner from the studio will demonstrate their technique. After everyone has learned the moves, the dance it­selfwill begin (at 10 p.m.). Semi-formal attire is the attire for the eve­ning. Refreshments will be served. To defray the costs, there is an admission charge, S2 per person or S3 per couple, which may be paid in advance at the Student Union Ticket Office or at the door. Happy dancing! 
MOVIES 

Through the ages, the legend of the greatest king of the Britons, 
Arthur, has been preserved in such epics as Mallory's Le .'11orte 
d'Artur, Tennyson'sldylls oftbe King and Twain's satire, A Connec­
ticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. Since the advent of the 
cinematic medium, the history ofArthur has found its way into many 
plots. After a period of respite, King Arthur's adventures have again 
become the subject ofa major motion picture. Excalibur stands as 
one ofthe finest cinematic attempts at capturing the atmosphere and 
life of"Arthurian" England and the Middle Ages. It will be shown in 
the Engineering Auditorium at 7 and I 0 p.m. Admission is SI. 
To close the Friday Night Film Series, the Notre Dame/Saint 
Mary's Communication and Theatre Department will be showing 
Man ofMarble in the Annenberg Auditorium at 7:30p.m. Director 
Andrzej Wadja follows in the stream ofOrson Welle's Citizen Kane 
in tracing the life of Mateusz Birkut, a government-created hero of 
the '50s working clas~. Admission is S2. 
MUSIC 

The University of Notre Dame Chorale, under tthe direction of 
Carl Starn, will present its Fall Semester Campus Concert on Friday, 
December 10, at 8:15p.m. in Washington Hall. The Chorale, a select 
group ofmixed voices, ha.~ prepared a program including selections 
from Stravinsky's Mass, Bach'sLobet den Herrn, all Heiden, and 
Faure's Cantique dejean Racine. Complimenting these serious 
pieces will be a number ofspirituals, madrigals and Christmas 
Carols. Come enjoy the magic ofmusic presentd by the Chorale. Ad­
mission is free and early seating is advised. 
In keeping with the spirit of the season, the Department of Music 
at Saint Mary's is sponsoring a concert Sunday evening at 8 p.m. 
which will feature music associated with the Yuletide season. Les­
sons and Carols will be performed by the various Saint Mary's choirs 
and Chamber singers in the Church ofLoretto. The Notre 
Dame/Saint Mary's community is invited to attend. 
Amah/ and the Night Visitors, a one-act operetta that has become 
a Christmas classic. will be performed tomorrow :md Sunday nights 
at 7:'0 p.m. in the Goshen College Umble Center. Amah/, by 
modern Italian composer Giancarlo Menotti, tells the story ofa poor 
crippled shepherd boy and his mother who are visited by the Three 
Kings on the night ofthe babyJesus' birth. Tickets are S I and can be 
purchased at the door. 
NAZZ 

As veterans of the Nazz will tell you, students, faculty, staff, 
children offaculty, children ofstaff, children oftownies, children at 
heart, in other words, everyone and anyone, await the arrival ofthe 
Christmas Nazz. This event ranks right up there with the Southern 
Cal-Notre Dame football game, UCLA-NO, etc., in attendance and en­
thusia.o;tic fans. In the past, there have been-the traditional audience 
participation caroling, dramatic readings of various Christmas 
stories, lots of music, singing and fun. This year's Christma.o; Nazz 
promises to top its predecessors. The evening will feature Matt 
Feeney, Bob O'Donnell,John Foryt, Betsy Quinn and Greg Sobowski. 
Sources say that there will be elves present to supply North Pole­
type cocoa and cookies.

says DiStanislao. "And she'll try to drive. Their floor leader is Lori Gnat­kowski. The team will try to run, so it'll be another tempo game." 
Michigan's starting five is un­settled, as Coach Gloria Soluk is searching for a winning combina­tion. The word from Ann Arbor is that Soluk may start four freshmen along with Harte, as Lilly leads a group of five freshmen, four of whom are over 6-0. 
Freshman Wendy Bradetich is Michigan's third leading scorer (9.0 average) and the leading Wolverine on the boards, pulling down eight a game. Forwards Sandy Svoboda and Amy Rembisz may also be given starting shots. 
"They came back by turning the DePaul game (a 75-70 loss for U ofM that was a blowout early) into a track meet," says Mary D. "But they'll turn it over, like Western, and we can capitalize on it." 
The WMU game was an encourag­ing come-from-behind win on the road, another step for a young Irish team. This weekend's games with teams from the MAC and the Big Ten can be another. 
"This weekend's games are pretty evenly matched, especially with Miami," says Mary D. "But we want to cultivate a habit of winning the close games -we've still got a lotto learn."

Ivyopponent ,..-G Big Green rolling into ACC I ~~srA 
llAIIT, cocKTAil lOUNGE SZECHUAN -WTONESE-AMERICAN 
By RICH O'CONNOR 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame's win over a tough 
Fairfield team last night was another 
step in the right direction for Irish 
basketball. Notre Dame hopes to 
continue its progress as it plays host 
to an improved Dartmouth squad 
tomorrow afternoon at l :30 at the 
ACC. 
Two starters return from the Big 
Green's 7-19 team a year ago. That .may not seem like an improvement, but juniors Paul Anderson and Brian Burke learned much from the ex­perience. While Dartmouth's ex­pectations do not include·either a national or even an Ivy League championship, there has been 
progress. 
Anderson holds down the center spot for the Big Green and averages 13 points and six rebounds a game. He led the team in scoring, rebound­ing, and shot blocking last season. Anderson's total of 174 rebounds in 26 games also led the Ivy League ­although he is only 6-5. 
Burke, a 6-5 forward, averages 13 
points and five rebounds from his 
spot. 6-6 senior Matt Stewart also 
returns to inherit the remaining for­
ward slot. Stewart is averaging 12 
points and six rebounds a game for 
Dartmouth. 
With backcourt players Taylor 
Conlan and Derek Sells, both sopho­
mores, rounding out Dartmouth's 
starting five, the Big Green shows 
signs of breaking their string of 
losing seasons at three -and 
searching for only their fifth winning 
season in the last 20 years. 
The improvement is already 
noticeable. Dartmouth comes to the 
ACC with a 2-0 record after wins 
over Bowdoin (81-56) and Harvard 
Dartmouth placed 13 players in the 
scoring column, with three in 
double figures. The victory over 
Harvard was the first for the Big 
Green over the Crimson since 1979, 
and they did it from the foul line. 
Dartmouth converted on 17 of 18 at­
tempts. Last season Harvard 
defeated Dartmouth, 80-64. 
The main difference is the play of 
their bench. In their two games this 
year. Big Green coach Tim Cohane 
played 14 people in one game, and 
10 in the other. Senior captain Steve 
McNamara, sophomore Aaron Hill 
and a nine-player freshmen class are 
among the major contributors. 
"Overall. the team will be im­
proved in all areas from last season," 
says Cohane. "We feel we've had 
three recruiting clas,es in the past three years that -if combined ­match up with the top four in the Ivy League. Now we need one more year of development and recruiting to move into the first division. 
"We're very excited about playing Notre Dame. It'll be a good ex­perience for the kids. We have ab­solutely nothing to lose by going there to play." 
While no one will mistake Dartmouth for an Indiana, a Ken­tucky or a UCLA, the game will be a test for Notre Dame's freshmen to see how well they've learned the les­sons of the past week. 
"The freshmen learned that they can play with the best college bas­ketball has to offer," says Irish coach Digger Phelps. "Now we'll use what we learned to make us a better bas­ketball team. 
In Dartmouth's first action since the completion of final exams, Phelps should have the opportunity to play most of his 13-man squad. 
"We're still experimenting with some things at this stage of the season," says Phelps, "but more than anything we're trying to get the freshmen comfortable with their roles and feeling comfortable assert­ing themselves when they're on the court. 
"These guys have talent, and these early games tell them and tell us as coaches where they stand, and where they need work. We also hope that having some success will give them. the confidence to go out and play on a consistent basis." 
After tomorrow's game, the Irish will take ten days off for their own finals. Their season resumes Wed., Dec. 22 against Valparaiso.

Hockey weekend 
Ely leads fracturE~d defense 
By STEVE LABATE 
.~jJOrls Writer 
!\lotre Dam~: sophomore ddl:n­seman Stl'Vt: Ely has had more than his share of mistiJrtunt: sinn: arriv­ing from his hom~:town in Woodbridge, Ontario to play hock­ey t(Jr tht: Irish. 
First he had to sit out the second half of last s<:ason because he was 
academically ineligible.  
Then  he  injured  hh  knee  in  
Chicago  this  ~cason  in  a  game  
against Illinois-Chicago.  

!\low, aftt:r two fine pert(mnances against .\1ichigan State, he has come down with a viral infection that has set him hack once again. 
What docs Ely think of his streak of had luck? "I can't believe it," he commcntt:d. "I'm going to try and play Friday (tonight), and if I can't, I'll be ready Saturday. I've hccn sleeping all wt:ek." 
Coach Lefty Smith isn't as optimis­

tic. According to Lefty, Ely is out t(Jr 
tonight's game and has a "'5 percent 
chance of suiting up tomorrow. 
Smith expects a physical series this 
weekend as the Irish play host to the 
Buckeyes of Ohio State. If he plays. 
Ely ( 6-2, 205 pounds) could he a sig­
nitkant factor in the series. 

Coach Smith lamented, "Steve being out could hamper us. We hope that it (Ely not playing) doesn't have a damning eftcct on us." These

words may sound somewhat strange when you consider that Steve Ely has not scored a goal or assisted on one so far this season. What is it then that adds to the team that makes him so valuable.' 
"He's very physical, very en­thusiastic. and it ruhs oft· on the team," commented Smith. "With his size and strength he provides us with muscle hack there (on defense)." 
Although he has only come as of late:, Ely will hl' the t1rst to tell you that his play is the result of hard work and hustle. The second semes­ter ineligibility was a real set hack for him hecau!>e he was not allowed to skate with the team. "Yeah, I've been very pleased with my progress. .\1y contldence is very high right now," remarked Steve. "I don't feel that I've reached my peak though. there's a long way to go. 
Ely showed just how t:tr he has come last Saturday afternoon against MSU in the third period of a game already decided. It was then that he played like a man possessed. He hit everything in a green uniform. But don't call Steve an enforcer. "I don't like the word enforcer, maybe a motivator is more like it." Ely con­tinued, ''I'm just a friend of my goalie." 
Ely's hest performance came on a weekend in which the Irish Hockey team appeared to come into its own. At least Lefty Smith is inclined to think that way. "Their enthusiasm and work ethic has really been ex­cellent this week in practice. Their spirit has been the best the best its been since the beginning of the season." 
They will need excellent perfor­mances again this weekend if they are to sweep Ohio State. Coach Smith assessed the Buckeyes, "Ohio State is an excellent club. They beat and tied Bowling Green, so that should give you an idea ofhow good they are. They have an excellent goaltender (John Dougan, 2.90 goals against) and are strong up front. I ex­pect it to be a very difficult series." 
The Buckeyes are coming off a win and a tie against Northern Mich­igan, and are 6-4-2 in CCHA play (5th place).juniors Dave Kobryn (7 goals, 2 3 assists), Andy Browne ( 7 goals, 16 assists), and twin brothers, Paul and Perry Pooley ( 16 and 20 points respectively) will lead the Ohio State offensive attack. 
Trying to keep the puck out ofthe net for the Irish will be senior goalie Bob McNamara, who returns to ac­tion after missing the MSU series with a concusion. On defense, Rex Bellomy will shift from hi!> normal center spot to defenseman should Ely sit out. 
However the Irish could certainly use a strong body like Ely's this weekend. His presence gives the whole team more cont1dence on the ice. Ely admits, "I think they (his tt:ammates) enjoy seeing me out on the ice. I suspect Iwill see a lot ofice time." 
Ely served warning to the Buckeyes by concluding, "Never mind the infection, I'll be ready and it will be physical." 
The opening face-off will be 8 p.m. at the Athletic and Convocation Center.
