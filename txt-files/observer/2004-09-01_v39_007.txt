Convention encourages students 
Students from both parties gear up for November election 

By JANICE FLYNN 
News Writer 
Launching politically-minded Notre Dame students of all stripes into an autumn of cam­paigning for their respective parties in both national and local elections. the Republican National Convention kicked off this week with the challenge to reach a critical voting bloc of young adults. 
The elected officers of Notre Dame's College Hepublicans club made their allegiances clear. holding an informal con­vention-watch Monday night in the LaFortune Student Center. The group also plans to have a larger turnout for President Bush's upcoming speech on Thursday, with both past mem­bers and newcomers who joined at Activities Night Tuesday. 

Defense and national security, major themes of the convention and campaign, are important issues for them, group members said. 

"The speeches were amazing on their own in humor, logic and emotion, but as a whole they present an underlying corner­stone of the Hepublican Party," Notre Dame College Hepublicans secretary Jonathan Klinger said.

Teaching assistants lend classroom support 
By KEN WALSH 
News Writer 
While classes utilizing teaching assistants and grad­uate assistants have earned a negative reputation on other campuses, several Notre Dame students and faculty members disagree with this stereotype. 
Assistant Dean of the College of Arts and Letters Dottie Pratt praised small class sizes and one-on-one teacher-student interaction as benefits of the TA system. 
"It allows people to have more sections, so you are not 
in those huge, anonymous classes," she said. According to Pratt, the presence of teaching assistants allows professors to spread large classes into smaller, more personal, discussion groups. 
Although many classes uti­lize TAs, the majority of the schools at Notre Dame do not actually rely on teaching assistants to instruct under­graduates, but rather to aide the professor in running the class said representatives from the Colleges of Arts and Letters, Business and Architecture. 
"They assist the faculty member in the administration 
of the class," said assistant dean of the Mendoza College of Business Sam Gaglio. "They might grade papers, they might sit there for an exam, help grade exams." 
Teaching assistant involve­ment in class is not only sup­ported by busy faculty mem­bers looking for assistance in administering a class, but also by students. Students find they often relate better to teaching assistants, as they are closer in age, sophomore Tim Haren said. 
"I think they are very help­ful to every class, especially if it is in a language require­ment," senior Maria Garrido added. 
One of the greatest benefits of the presence of TAs is the real-life classroom experi­ence that the graduate teach­ing assistants receive, said chemistry professor Xavier Creary. 
"All professors, at least in our department, at one time were TAs. That's one of the ways in which they learned how to get in front of a class and give a presentation and how to organize," he said. "They learned the types of questions that students are going to ask by being TAs in a

Parking rules cause tnixed reaction 
By KATE ANTONACCI 
News Writer 
With classes underway, abid­ing by parking regulations may be at the back of students' minds. But the hefty price tags accompanying Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) issued tickets may cause them to think twice. 
Though many students are unaware of ticket fines, NDSP has clear stipulations for differ­ent types of violations -$10 for improper or overtime park­ing, $15 for parking in unas­signed lots, $20 for driving on lawns and $30 for blocking a trash receptacle, amongst oth­ers. 
On Tuesday, senior Alissa Lemmon, an off-campus resi­dent, parked her car in a yel­low no-parking zone in the D6 parking lot without a decal, risking multiple fines. Luckily for her, she got to her car before NDSP did. "I think parking tickets are kind of stupid," she said. "I used to get tickets all the time for parking at Main Circle. It's not a big deal." 
Phillip Johnson, assistant director of Security/Police, said that NDSP is holding off for most students to register their cars before they begin issuing the steep $50 tickets for park­ing without a decal. 
Other students said they feel tickets are necessary to main­tain safety and fairness in the lots. 
"I don't mind if they start cracking down if that's what they need to do," said Ryann Swalling, a fifth-year architec­ture student who lives off-cam­pus. "People take advantage, so if a $10 fine is what they need, then that's fair." 
NDSP, however, insists there is no sudden crackdown and that parking regulations

INSIDE COLUMN 

Learning on the W"eekend 
"I had a crazy weekend." 
I am sure you have heard this 

phrase about 1,000 times since 
Monday, followed by a detailed story 
about an adventurous "Hally" experi­
ence. My weekend 
was about more Kelly Meehan 
than Rally, The 
Show or any off-
campus party. It Wire editor 
was about some 
important realiza­
tions I came to in my first weekend 
back. 
The first weekend on campus is a 

right of passage for any first-year col­
lege student. 
Being a sophomore, I could not help 
but envy the freshman as they "dis­
cover" all that college has to offer, 
with everything and everyone being a 
new face or experience. On the other 
hand, I was glad to be a sophomore 
and reassure myself that having been 
here for one year I would not make 
any "freshman mistakes" ... but I was 
very wrong. 
When I was heading back to cam­

pus Friday night I came to the horrid 
realization that I had lost my keys 
and wallet somewhere in the vastly 
congested alley at Turtle Creek. 
After a moment of panic in the real­ization I had lost not only my mail and door keys, but also my student ID, ATM card and $40 cash, I felt more helpless than any freshman might in his or her first few weeks at college. 
As the weekend progressed, I felt more at ease with my loss. Perhaps, you might say, I came to terms with having to cash out over $100 to replace my belongings. This stupid mistake made me realize that college is all about mistakes, and what really counts is how you deal with them. 
I knew I swore that I would not make any mistakes this year, but just like a freshman I did not know what life would have in store for me. If I knew coming to Saint Mary's last August what I know now, my life would have been much simpler. 
I guess someone should have told me winter can and will last for 80 percent of the school year, boys do really play video games all of the time, Instant Messenger will be equiv­alent if not more popular than the telephone and it is okay to eat cereal for every meal at the dining hall. 
No one ever told me that this week­end I would be saying goodbye to two of my best friends who would be studying abroad for the year. These are two friends who I did not even know existed merely one year ago, but by making it through our fresh­man year together we would become best friends. 
You will be glad to know that NDSP left me a voicemail on Monday morn­ing, reporting that someone had turned in my keys and wallet. 
When I picked it up from Security I felt more in control of things, like a real sophomore who knew what was going on. I could only hope that it was an honest freshman out there, about to experience one of the best and most challenging years of his or her life. who turned in my keys, wallet, and money all intact.

Toilet paper gift raises city's spirits 
YORK, Pa. -York, a city struggling with its finances, has received a most practical gift. An unknown donor 
dropped off a case of toilet paper at City Hall on Sunday. The gesture was in response to a recent comment made by York Councilman Wm. Lee Smallwood, who wondered how the cash-strapped city would close a $25 million deficit in the police and fire pensions. 
"We can't even afford toilet paper," Smallwood said. 
Mayor John Brenner said the toilet paper was left at City Hall with a note from "a friend."

Security, post office anticipate m_ove 
By ELIZABETH CHEFFERS 
News Writer 
While students may agree that the new security building/post office complex being built on Holy Cross Drive has already vindicat­ed its existence by hiding Stepan Center. the postal workers and security officers who work there welcome its opening for more basic reasons. 
The existing security building was built as a temporary struc­ture in 1944, and Notre Dame Security/Police officers on campus have waited 60 years for a per­manent home. The new building will include more room for offices, training space for the South Bend police and even some classrooms. 
"It will be great to have students come in here when they are not having problems," said Rex Rakow, NDSP director. Other than adding classroom space, the move should have no effect on student services or response time as offi­cers usually respond from patrols on campus and not from the secu­rity building, he said. 
The new building has 40,000 square feet, only 5,000 of which will be used by the post office, which will occupy half of the lower floor on the side of the building that faces the nearby power plant. 
The post office will gain only 44 square feet in the move, but workers remain enthusiastic about the new facility. 
"We are especially excited about adding three new enclosed load­ing docks," said Ellen Bystrom,

the Notre Dame postmistress. 
The post office's current loca­tion, although sufficient to handle mail distribution, is also difficult to access with a vehicle and has only 10 parking spaces that it shares with McKenna Hall, half of which provide handicap-only parking. 
The new office will solve both of these problems by opening Saint Joseph's Road to Douglas Road as an access route and adding 13 "customers only" parking spaces. 
While both officers and postal workers said they are thankful for the space they will gain in the move, expansion of both facilities was not the primary reason the University decided to give priority to the construction, Bystrom said. 

The University plans to build new buildings where the security building and the post office are now located. 
"It was definitely the University's decision to move," Bystrom said. 
Rakow mentioned University plans to build a hotel where the security building now sits. The new hotel would eventually replace The Morris Inn. 
Bystrom said the new building is expected to be finished by Dec. 20 and will be fully operational by 
. the beginning of the 2005 spring semester.

The Fair Trade agreement was established to provide relief to coffee growers from stringent economic pres­sures. 
The Fair Trade agreement certifies that coffee farmers will be paid a fair price for each pound of coffee they sell and will also provide credit to farmers and technical 
m1mmum of $1.26 per pound of coffee that they sell. 
Most coffee farmers, Poklinkowski said, "will grow their product for, say, 76 cents and the market price will be 80 cents. Fair Trade pays [farmers] a decent liv­ing to grow their coffee." 
Huddle manager Jim LaBella said the LaFortune convenience store has been using both regular and Fair Trade coffee for the last three years. 
"The Fair Trade coffee blend that we've had for the past few years has been our French blend, and it's an extremely high quality cof­fee," he said. 
In its press release, Student Government urged all students to promote Fair Trade coffee. 
"The continued expansion of Fair Trade coffee is now in the hands of the students," the release stated. "It is up to the students to decide through their coffee choice, whether or not the dining halls and cafes across cam­pus make Fair Trade coffee their sole supplier." 
In addition to the dining halls, Fair Trade coffee is now offered in Waddick's in O'Shaughnessy Hall, the Cafe Commons in the Mendoza College of Business and Starbucks in LaFortune. Fair Trade will soon be the sole supplier of coffee at the

been able to participate in the political process in an excep­tional way. Senior Danny O'Driscoll has been working in New York for the convention this summer, and will remain there for the duration of the week. 
"There has been a lot of excitement," he said. "It's going to be a great jumping off point for the fall campaign." 
Like many politically-active students, O'Driscoll will contin­ue campaigning locally when he returns to South Bend. He has worked for Indiana Rep. Chris Chocola for the past three years. 
While Notre Dame Republicans and Democrats plan to support their candi­dates in the national election, they will devote special focus to the local Indiana elections. 
In the governor's race, Republicans will support Mitch Daniels while Democrats back current governor Joe Kernan. Democratic candidate Joe Donnelly challenges Republican incumbent Chocola in the race for Indiana's Second Congressional district. 
Both the College Democrats and Republicans clubs boast large memberships, and the groups are hesitant to specu­late on where the dividing political line of the student body lies. 
"I think all degrees of the spectrum of political thought are reflected at Notre Dame," said Professor William Schmuhl, faculty liaison to the College Republicans. ''I'm real­ly not sure that there are any studies done to indicate if the students are more conserva­tive than liberal." 
College Republican club offi­cials fall short of saying that Notre Dame leans conserva­tive, but say that they receive a better reception than their Republican counterparts on

smaller setting." 
Acting as a teaching assis­tant gives graduate students the chance to become more comfortable interacting with students, leading discussions and becoming aware of the needs of students, philoso­phy TA Jennifer Jensen said. 
Fellow teaching assistant Angela Smith agreed. "Since you are working so closely with the students you are able to see very clearly what works and what doesn't work, and what would work for you as a teacher," Smith said. 
According to Pratt, this preparation is important for molding the teachers and professors of the future. 
Despite the benefits pre­sented to students, profes­sors and TAs, there are still those who are skeptical about the use of teaching assistants. 
"[Teaching assistants] can help you prepare for tests, and they can help you in specific things," senior Claire Hagan said, "but pro­fessors are definitely better prepped." 
Hegardless of any criti­cism, it appears as though the use of TAs will persist. 
"We really appreciate the teaching assistants and the 
other campuses. Klingler says such reception "refutes the claim that if you are in college, you have to be a liberal." 
Notre Dame College Democrat Co-President Colin Taylor says that the number of independent students at Notre Dame will factor in heavily into this election. Taylor said the College Democrats gained a record attendance at last week's meeting, and believes the trend will continue. 
"This election is invigorating everybody, especially the Democratic base," Taylor said. 
Both College Republicans and Democrats agree this year's election has caught the attention of students in an unprecedented way. 
"This semester I am seeing many people come out of the woodwork and start taking a political stance," said Notre Dame College Democrats Co­President Nicola Bunick. 
To encourage political par­ticipation, the two clubs have planned two debates for Sept. 8 and Oct. 6. 
In addition, they intend to invite the editors of the liberal "Nation" and the conservative "National Review" publications to debate on campus, an event currently scheduled for late September. 
"Notre Dame is full of civi­cally minded students who will especially pay attention when the election is at hand," said Taylor, adding that auditorium viewings of the presidential debates are also planned. 
Students active in both politi­cal parties on campus will focus on voter registration this fall, particularly through the Rock the Vote effort. 
"So many college students and young people in general don't register or don't vote," O'Driscoll said. "I think that those who have interest should try to raise interest level in others."

12 hostages slayed in Iraq 
BAGHDAD, Iraq -A gruesome video posted on a Web site purported to show militants beheading a Nepalese worker and shooting 11 others in the first mass slaying of foreign hostages during the Iraqi insur­gency. 
If confirmed, it would raise the number of foreign workers known to have been slain by extremists to at least 22 in a terror cam­paign aimed at forcing foreign troops and contract workers out of the country. 
Interim Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi promised retribution. "The only solution with this unjust group is to make them face justice," he angrily told the Arab-language Al-Arabiya television station. 
In another hostage crisis, French officials held talks in Paris and around the Arab world in hopes of saving the lives of two journalists held by other insurgents in Iraq. The kidnappers set a Wednesday deadline for France to rescind its ban on Muslim head scarves in French schools, a demand France has said it won't meet. 
16 killed in Palestinian bombing 
BEERSHEBA, Israel -Palestinian suicide bombers blew up two buses in this Israeli desert city Tuesday, killing 16 passengers and wounding more than 80 in an attack that ended a six-month lull in violence. 
The buses exploded into flames just sec­onds apart and about 100 yards away from each other in the center of Beersheba the deadliest suicide strike in nearly a year. 
Israel had attributed the lull to its sepa­ration barrier, arrest sweeps and wide­spread network of informers.

England military trial adjourns 
FORT BRAGG, N.C.-Prosecutors ended a military court hearing Tuesday for a soldier shown in infamous photos of naked Iraqi prisoners by requesting an additional charge of "maltreatment and cruelty" against Pfc. Lynndie England. 
The hearing to determine whether England should face a full court-martial adjourned without testimony from any of the high-level witnesses sought by the defense, including Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. 
Investigating officer Col. Denise Arn said she would recommend within a week whether England should face a court-mar­tial. 
Terrorist may get new trial 
WASHINGTON -The Justice Department has asked a judge to throw out the convic­tions of a suspected terror cell in Detroit because of prosecutorial misconduct, revers­ing course in a case the Bush administration once hailed as a major victory in the war on terrorism, legal sources said Tuesday. 
The department told U.S. District Judge Gerald Rosen that it supports the Detroit defendants' request for a new trial and would no longer pursue charges of material support of terrorism. That means the defen­dants at most would only face fraud charges at a new trial, the legal sources said.

Former ambassador Richard Holbrooke expresses need for aid in Africa

AL-FASHER -The for­mer U.S. ambassador to the United Nations visited a displaced persons camp in the troubled Darfur region on Tuesday and sharply criticized Sudan, the United Nations, the U.S. adminis­tration and the internation­al community for doing too little to stem the humani­tarian crisis there. 
Richard Holbrooke, trav­eling with U.S. Sen. Jon Corzine, a New Jersey Democrat, visited the Krinding camp near El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur state. 
"What we have seen is very moving, very disturb­ing, and there is an enor­mous amount that needs to be done still in the humani­tarian area and beyond that," Holbrooke told reporters after the visit. 
"I do not think that any­one involved, the Sudanese government, the United Nations, the international community, my own coun­try, is yet doing enough," he said. "Everyone needs to do more.

Female suicide bomber kills 10 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -A woman strapped with explosives blew herself up out­side a busy Moscow subway station Tuesday night, killing at least 10 people and wounding more than 50 in the second terrorist attack to hit Russia in a week, officials said. 
Seven days earlier, almost to the hour, two Russian jetliners crashed within minutes of each other in what officials determined were terrorist bombings. All 90 people aboard were killed, and the investigation has focused on two Chechen women believed to have been passengers. 
A militant Muslim web site pub­lished a statement late Tuesday claiming responsibility for the sub­way bombing on behalf of the "Islambouli Brigades," a group that also claimed it caused the jetliner crashes with suicide teams in retri­bution for Russia's war with Islamic rebels in Chechnya. The veracity of neither claim could be confirmed. 

The statement said Tuesday's bombing was a blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin "who slaughtered Muslims time and again." Putin has firmly refused to negotiate with the rebels in predomi­nantly Muslim Chechnya, saying they must be wiped out. 
Several female suicide bombers allegedly connected with the rebels have caused carnage in Moscow and other Russian cities in a series of attacks in recent years. 
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov told reporters near the Rizhskaya subway stop in northern Moscow that the bomber was walking toward the station shortly after 8 p.m. but turned around when she saw two police offi­cers. 
She "decided to destroy herself in a crowd of people" in a busy area between the subway station and a nearby department store-supermar­ket complex, Luzhkov said, adding that the bomb was packed with bolts and pieces of metal.

"I don't think we're writing any more than we have in other years," Johnson said. "Sometimes a reminder from our ol'fice in the form of a tick­et is necessary." 
Suzanne Stryker. an off-cam­pus resident who drives to campus for class, echoed Johnson's point. 
"Especially during the winter when the snow hasn't been cleared in the lot. I think park­ing tickets are necessary," she said. 
Still, many people dismiss parking tickets as being minor problems, even the $50 fine. 
"To me, it's not a big deal because they just go on your student account," Lemmon said. ·

"I know you get one warning per academic school year and that is understandable because obviously there have to be rules that need to be fol­lowed," she said. "But I got a warning during move-in this year. I forgot to move my car overnight. They were going to tow it in the morning, and I thought that was a little over­board." 
All tickets can, however. be appealed to a board of neutral members. 
"There are no NDSP people on the appeal review board," Johnson said. "It is made up of faculty, staff and students." 
Students receive written notification once their ticket is reviewed by the board, and if dissatisfied ~ith the citation, may re-appeal their case. The second finding, however, is final. 
Johnson said that if students pay their fine within 10 days and move their car to a legal spot, NDSP offers a 20 percent discount on the fine. 
NDSP traffic rules, which dif­fer from parking rules, are set by the law enforcement pro­gram "Click It or Ticket." Funded by federal highway safety grants, the program was initiated in an effort to enforce seat belt and car seat laws for adults and children. Supported by Notre Dame. the program's mission is clear ­either buckle the seatbelt or get a ticket. 
There has been a national reduction in the number of deaths by car accidents follow­ing the institution of the pro­gram, which also has paid tel­evision, radio, billboard and print advertisements. Deemed successful, "Click It or Ticket" has been initiated all over the country, including in Indiana's neighboring states of Michigan, Illinois and Ohio. 
To promote compliance with state jurisdiction, all traffic tickets issued at Notre Dame follow "Click It or Ticket" reg­ulations. 
Notre Dame students travel­ing off-campus should be aware of the strict enforce­ment of the program in the South Bend area. 
"Local departments have geared up their patrols for school zones in particular," Johnson said.

SMC initiates school recycling cainpaign 
By KELLY MEEHAN 
News Writer 

Saint Mary's began a cam­pus-wide recycling program Aug.18 in an effort to become more environmentally con­scious. 
Before the College officially took over recycling efforts this month, the Student Environmental Action Coalition ran the Saint Mary's recycling campaign. SEAC members were responsible for collecting and driving the recyclables to the closest col­lection center in their own cars. 
"The [Student Environmental Action Coalition] had done it for a long time, and it was time for the College to step up and be more conscience about recycling so that the club could do other things," pur­chasing director Dan Deeter said.

green recycling bins are locat­ed in nearly every building on campus near other trash receptacle and vending areas. According to Deeter, the College signed a contract with a company to pick up the recy­clable goods every Wednesday. 
"Plans for the College to take over the recycling effort start­ed last fall," Deeter said. 
Students will be able to recy­cle their aluminum and metal cans, paper products, glass and plastic bottles, jugs and containers. 
Along with the general recy­cling bins are "Paper Only" bins, and students are urged not to place anything other than paper products into these bins. Deeter said. All plastic containers and bottles must be rinsed clean of residue and food morsels before being placed into the recycle bin, he said.

IN BRIEF 
Stocks rise despite low confidence 
NEW YORK -A late-session buying spurt gave stocks a moderate lift Tuesday as investors managed to overcome their disap­pointment over troubling readings on con­sumer confidence and manufacturing. But with volume extremely light, analysts said it was difficult to place any real significance on the upturn. 
The plunge in the Conference Board's con­sumer confidence index, which fell to 98.2 in August from 105.7 in July, kept stocks lower for much of the day and raised concerns on Wall Street that a lack of new jobs could extend the summer's economic slowdown through the third quarter, or perhaps longer. Data on Midwest manufacturing activity also showed a sharp decline for the month. 
With oil prices extending their losses, buyers did move back into the market at the end of the session. Still, the turnaround was likely exaggerated because of the light turnover; many investors have stayed out of the market entirely during the Republican National Convention. 
New iMac released by Apple 
PARIS -The latest computer in the iMac family literally puts Apple's trademark mini­malism on a pedestal. The processor and drives are built into a sleek flat-panel display. 
"A lot of people are going to be asking, 'Where did the computer go?'" said Apple Computer Inc. senior vice president Phil Schiller as he introduced the new iMac on Tuesday, the opening day of the Apple Expo in Paris. 
The announcement ended days of fevered speculation about the launch, postponed from earlier this year because of inadequate sup­plies of the G5 processors made by IBM Corp. 
Available in 17 -inch and 20-inch versions beginning in mid-September, the new iMac looks like a 2-inch-thick monitor. 
Inside, however, is a large hard drive, 256 megabytes of memory and an ultra-fast processor of the kind reserved until now for Apple's professional Power Mac desktops. COs or DVDs disappear into the side of the white panel. as they are fed into a drive behind the screen.

That legislation, dating from 2000, empowers Washington to hand over to U.S. companies the duties imposed on foreign firms judged to be unfairly dumping cheap goods on the U.S. market. A state­ment from the eight com­plainants estimated that money totaled about $240 million last year.

EDITORIAL CARTOON 
If you're new on campus -even if you're not-you are probably famil­iar with something the advertisements call the Notre Dame Experience. I've never seen it outside of the brochures (that should tip you 
Lance Gallop 
off), but it seems to consist of football games. praying at the The Third Way Grotto, scintillating lunch discussions with professors ­which neither I nor anyone else I know of have ever had -and doing your best to look like you stepped right out of an Abercrombie catalog. Also, if you're honest, for consolation on the long nights there is beer. 
Now a new band of neophyte stu­dents wanders among us, more than anything else desiring to taste experi­ences, and only too eager to drink in those at Notre Dame. That is, after all, probably why our new friends came here; they are paying a lot of money for the Experience, and they want every bead and sequin. Oh. and they would like to be the next models in those Abercrombie flyers too, please. 
Sometimes we try to give them good advice on living the Notre Dame life and capturing the Experience, and it is the same advice that we were told long ago. Notre Dame is family. Notre Dame is values. Notre Dame is laud­able. We come to believe that Notre Dame is sisterhood, brotherhood, aca­demics, achievement, spirituality, hope, love and goodness. Notre Dame is football. Notre Dame is wealth, achievement, success and happiness. So we come to understand the Experience, and we gain peace in having lived it. 
There is one minor problem with all of this. It is completely and utterly 

wrong. 

The Notre Dame Experience is not the same as Notre Dame. If you can leave here after four years and give it one, or any of these labels, you've never been to Notre Dame. Notre Dame is family. values and all those virtues I named a moment ago ­everyone can see that. But Notre Dame is also well leavened with its share of bigotry, pride, greed and vain foolishness. If you live only in the light of the Notre Dame Experience, you will never see enough of the true heart of the University to believe this, and you will never love it enough to change it. You might as well not love it at all. But these realizations, impor­tant though they may be, are still only halfway to my point. 
You see, Notre Dame is not an expe­rience at all. Notre Dame cannot even be defined, let alone experienced, any more than you and I can really be defined or experienced. For Notre Dame is you, and it is I, and it is all the things that we do every day, both good and evil. There is hope and sor­row, friendship and enmity. equal parts of lust and holiness. much petty greed and much compassion. If Notre Dame has vice -and do not for any moment doubt that it does -then it is because we have vice. If Notre Dame has virtue, it is our virtue. Notre Dame is tragic, just as you and I are tragic. It is exactly as broken as we are. It is exactly as divine. 
If you only look to the Experience, you end up experiencing nothing. The character of Notre Dame does not fit in a brochure, or even into one of Monk's stock homilies. There is good 
here, and the good is far better than 
anything you will find in the 
Experience. But it is human good, 
good that is messy, lived and earned. 
miserably misunderstood and even 
suffered (you won't find that in the 
advertisements). But if you avoid the 
pain, as the Experience urges, you 
avoid the human lessons and divine 
truth of Notre Dame. and you gradu­
ate from an illusion. 
The Experience glosses over the 
harder parts of Notre Dame. In the 
real Notre Dame, we all must take 
responsibility for what we all have 
become and what we all are becom­
ing. In the real Notre Dame we hurt 
and give hurt. In the real Notre Dame, 
though there are times when the 
Grotto is all of your soul and half your 
heart, and there are times when and 
you can't find peace for all the can­
dles. The real Notre Dame is harder 
to bear. yes. but all the more precious 
because of it, for. properly tended. it 
becomes a living truth. And left 
untended, it will die. 
I'd like to think that all alumni come 
to this realization eventually, if only 
deep within. I tell it to you now for 
only one purpose. that you open your 
eyes .to everything around you and 
within you, and that you scrutinize 
Notre Dame as you scrutinize your­
self. 
That's the first step.

Bush speech must have broad appeal 
In the midst of a tight race, President Bush will make his case to the nation on Thursday night, a mere nine days before the Sept. 11 anniversary. Four years ago, on a different stage (Philadelphia) and in a different time (pre­Sept. 11), then-Texas Edward Guest Governor Bush accept­ed the Republican Kentucky nomination. 
Kernel 

Bush's speech, laden with tough criticism of Democratic cen­trism and promises to unite the country, persuaded many that he had the capabili­ty to govern as an effective leader, even if some questioned his policies. The presi­dent, for his own political sake, must at least replicate that showing at his Madison Square Garden gala, ifnot reach the levels of his Sept. 20, 2001 address that followed Sept. 11. 
Bush did not give an effective State of the Union address in 2004, he did not per­form particularly well during Tun Russert's grilling on "Meet the Press," and he has not captured the imagination of anyone, save his hardcore political base, in quite some time. That might well change on Thursday, when, for all practi­cal intents and purposes, Bush must destroy the candidacy of John Kerry and establish an insurmountable lead. 
Kerry, all criticism to the contrary, has run a methodical ifnot brilliant cam­paign, as recent polls suggest his support growing in key swing states such as Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio. 
More importantly, no polling consensus has yet established that a Gore state is trending toward the Bush column, which would leave Kerry with at least 260 elec­toral votes -10 from victory. Many liber­als and Democrats have argued that the 2004 election most closely resembles 1980, a year when the race remained close until the last week, when a decisive majority of independents and undecideds broke for Reagan. 
Despite my aforementioned disposition, I believe Bush has a much stronger chance at preventing Kerry from sweep­ing the late board. In doing this, Bush admittedly has a difficult task: He must persuade many of the same people who broke late for President Clinton in 1992 ­and likely had voted for George H.W Bush four years previous -to give him their support. Bush needs to persuade Gore voters, or the nominal Democrats that pushed the veep over the top in the national ballot, to join his camp. Even though many of these voters are not in sync with the president on court appointees, the environment or taxes, Bush might have garnered their vote with positive developments in education, cou­pled with Medicare reform. 

Unfortunately for the president, neither of these initiatives has turned out rosy. Many voters believe that Bush has under­funded his much-ballyhooed "No Child Left Behind Act" and are confused by the Medicare reform. 
Also, with ominous signs of stagflation approaching, the economy does not appear likely to win the president many votes. Foreign policy-specifically a detailed plan about how long and why Americans are to remain in Iraq, and how his counterterrorism plan supersedes Kerry's-represents Bush's best oppor­tunity to win new voters. 
The glow that surrounded the president post-Sept. 11 has faded away, but many Americans remember his words of reas­surance leading up to the Afghanistan invasion and that they supported Saddam Hussein's removal from power. 
But they want to know why Osama bin Laden has not been brought to justice, why al-Qaeda's presence in Iraq has intensely magnified since March 2003, and how the president, if re-elected, can bridge the deep chasm between the United States and almost all the rest of the world. IfBush fails to unfurl a new idea or articulate a coherent message to these concerned Americans, his Nov. 2 support is likely to crest at 45 percent. But more than anything else, Bush must convince the aforementioned American electoral bloc, who are more and more inclined to believe that his "Steady Leadership in Times of Change" is the wrong leadership for the United States.

Tips for Tailgating 
COLUMN HY MAUREEN MALLOY 

Football may be the main attraction on Saturdays in South Bnnd, but no gridiron spectator is complete without a drink in one hand and a brat in the other. Tailgating is the perfect way to stretch a four-hour game into an ali-day event. llow else are Irish fans supposnd to bnar the frigid Indiana mornings without some warm food and good drinks to numb the cold? Although this girl is going to Dublin and won't be near Notre Dame's parking lot in the fall, I will be tailgat­ing in spirit and still havn some good tips and recipes to share. 
Serve mostly linger foods that can be prepared ahead of time (except for the grilling) and eaten while standing up. If you want something a little dassier than tlw usual burgers and hot dogs but don't want anything too fussy, try a menu with hand-held delec­table such as bacon-wrapped scallops, shish kabobs or tomato, mozzarella and basil skewers. 
Try to lind a parking spot by the grass or at the end of the parking row so you have morn room. Jiang a bright llag from your car so family and friends can lind you. Be ready to serve the food at least an hour and a half before kick oil".

Lucky at Legends 
Lucky Boys Confusion rocked a packed crowd at Legends Saturday night 
By MICHELE JEFFERS 
Scene Writer 
Legends hosted its first con­
cert of the year Saturday, fea­
turing the band Lucky Boys 
Confusion. Due to the band's 
reputation and the unbeatable 
ticket price (the show was free). 
confusion abounded at Legends 
when a much larger number of 
studonts came out to see the 
show than expected. Students 
grew anxious waiting for the 
doors to open and feared they 
would not be admitted into the 
show. When the small club 
reached its capacity, the staff of 
Legends was forced to turn 
away many disappointed fans. 
Waiting for the show to begin, many commented that Lucky Boys Confusion should have played at a bigger venue on campus. Although it is unfortu­natp, that more students could not get in due to the club's size, the small setting afforded a more intimate atmosphere, allowing everyone to get close to the stage and rock out. 
And rock out they did. 
Lucky Boys Confusion took the stage opening the set with the appropriately chosen "Saturday Night." While some only recog­nized the band's 2001 single "Fred Astaire," die-hard fans surged to the front, never miss­ing a note. The set list was well balanced, showcasing songs from both their first record "Throwing the game" (2001), as well as the more recent "Commitment" (2003). Lucky Boys Confusion also played "Broken," "Hey Driver," "Bossman," "Something to Believe" and "Do you Miss Me". among others. Finally, in what very well could be an anthem to end parietals, LBC ended the show with "3 to 1 0/Cd 's Caddy, Pt. 1". During the song they reminded the sweat­soaked audience that when some thing stands in their way of a good time, "there's always the back seat." Overall, the concert seemed a success. Everyone appeared to enjoy the show and, since it ended by 11:30 p.m., the night was still young enough for revelry, debauchery and late­night Yahtzee games. 
The five members of Lucky Boys Confusion hail from Chicago, where they have culti­vated a diverse following consist­ing of fans of all different ages, backgrounds and musical tastes. Their sharp lyrics and innovative ability to combine rock with other musical genres like hip-hop and reggae, gives LBC a unique sound, preventing LBC from being shoved aside as just anoth­er pop punk band. As is clear from their performance on Saturday, LBC's music has the power to reach audiences on multiple levels. 
It doesn't matter whether someone is a "420 geek", a bro-


ken-hearted cynic or a kid that would rather "drink beer and play Atari" than face the respon­sibilities of adulthood, Lucky Boys Confusion can reach all those fans without compromising the intention of their music. According to their website, LBC named its new album "Commitment" to express its commitment to each other as a band, as well as its commitment to each and every one of its fans. Produced by Sublime's Michael Miguel, "Commitment" comes to term with issues such as suicide and spiritual uncertainty while continually blurring stylistic gen­res. 
If you missed Lucky Boys Confusion this time around, dry your tear-ridden eyes and uncurl yourself from your fetal ball. Lucky Boys Confusion has announced that it will be touring this fall with the Plain White T's, The Matches and Dropping Daylight on the Suburban Curse Tour. 
Legends brought a great show to campus and gave the Chicago crowd at Notre Dame an opportu­nity to enjoy a city favorite.

NCAA FOOTBALL 
Questions abound for Tiller's Boilermakers 
Coach not sure what to expect for 2004 
Associated Press INDIANAPOLIS -It must be close to the start of the foot­ball season. Purdue coach Joe Tiller is getting nervous, and he would­n't have it any other way. "I think when I lose that, that's probably when I will quit coaching," Tiller said Tuesday. "I find every year exciting. I find the start of the year the most exciting part of the year." His eighth season with Purdue begins in a nationally televised (ABC) game against Syracuse on Sunday. The 24th­ranked Boilermakers were 9-4 last year and return eight starters on offense, including their quarterback, running 
back and a receiver who could set Big Ten records for career catches and yards. 
But Tiller is getting those familiar jitters. 
"I get nervous about the bezillion things that could g·o wrong or could go right to have us look like a football 
team," he 

s a i d "Nervous is perhaps not the word. Anxious, I think, is the right word. I'm anxious to see these 
Tiller guys play. 
"I have an opinion about these guys, but I have been around long enough to know that can all go out the door in a hurry." 
Like it did last year, when the Boilermakers were upset 

in their opener 27-26 by Bowling Green. Their only other defeats were at Michigan and Ohio State, which tied them with the Buckeyes for second place in the Big Ten, and in overtime to Georgia in the Capital One Bowl. 
Syracuse ended last season with a 38-12 victory over Notre Dame but finished just 6-6 and sixth in the Big East, failing to gain a bowl bid for the third time in four years. Sunday's game will be the first between the Orange and the Boilermakers. 
"I don't really know what to expect," Tiller said. "They've made an adjustment in their coaching on the offensive side, but I don't think their base offense is going to change much. They like to run, and have one of the top running backs in the country. If you have a talent like that, cer­tainly you're going to exploit that." 
Coach Paul Pasqualoni is also the offensive coordinator, calling all the plays for the Orange, who return two-time 1,000-yard rush-
from Cincinnati wanting to change its schedule in antici­pation of its move next year to the Big East. Syracuse then agreed to make the switch, and ABC offered to televise it if it was moved from Saturday to Sunday. That

Friedgen building a winning legacy with 2004 Terrapins 
Associated Press 
COLLEGE PARK. Md. -The challenge facing Ralph Friedgen this season is simi­lar to the one he tackled upon his arrival at Maryland. 
llis goal: To buck the odds and make the 22nd-ranked Terrapins a force in the pow­erful Atlantic Coast 
... Conference. This time, though, instead of trying to build a winner, the portly football coach will attempt to sustain an unprecedented run of suc­cess. He will seek to do so in a beefed-up conference and with the youngest team he's ever had. If he can win with this group, then Friedgen is worth every penny of an upgraded contract that will pay him an average of $1.5 million over the next eight years. The Terrapins have little game experience at quarter­back, one senior on the defensive line and just one returning starter in the sec­ondary. In addition, Maryland will be competing in an ACC that now includes Miami and 
Virginia Tech. 
"It's not going to be easy because we have a lot of young players," senior receiv­er and kick returner Steve Suter said. "We're going to have a lot of new players stepping into new roles." 
But the Terrapins have Friedgen, who knows a thing or two about overcoming adversity. 
Before he arrived, Maryland went 10 years without a bowl appearance and was 37-73-1 since 1990. Football games were poorly attended, and most Terp fans lost interest once the basketball team held its Midnight Madness ceremo­ny each October. 
Friedgen changed all that. He guided Maryland to the ACC title in his first season, took the Terrapins to the Peach Bowl the following year and last season capped another spectacular effort with a rout of West Virginia in the Gator Bowl. 
Now, after going 31-8 the best record by a coach after three seasons in ACC history Friedgen is looking to keep a good thing going. 

The key to the Terrapins' success is tied to the develop­ment of sophomore quarter­back Joel Statham, who takes over for the dependable Scott McBrien as the leader of an offense that also lost standout running back Bruce Perry. 
Statham got his experience under fire last year, coming in relief of an injured McBrien in a road game against Georgia Tech. He failed to produce a touchdown and Maryland lost the game, but the experience he's gained this summer has Friedgen thinking Statham might develop into a solid quarter­back. 
"His decision-making has been excellent. The ball's going to the right place a lot of the time," the coach said. "What we have to do better is finish the play." 
The oft-injured Perry will be replaced by Josh Allen, a junior who last year led the team in yards rushing (922) and touchdowns (nine). Allen will get help from Sammy Maldonado, whose 2003 sea­son was cut short by a knee injury.

Edmonds flying high as Cardinals keep soaring 
Prior hit hard as Cubs lose, continue slump 
Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS ~ Jim Edmonds homered twice, giving him seven in six games, and the St. Louis Cardinals powered past 
the  San  Diego  Padres  9-3  
Tuesday night.  
Albert  Pujols  and  Edgar  

Renteria each homered and had three hits for the NL Central leaders. Reggie Sanders also had three hits, and drove in a run. 
Woody Williams (1 0-7) became the fifth member of the Cardinals' rotation to reach double figures in victories. 
The Cardinals beat up on 13­game winner Brian Lawrence and the San Diego bullpen to win their fourth in a row. and lowered their magic number for clinching the division to 16. 
St. Louis also beat one of its potential opponents in the play­offs: the Padres are battling for the wild card spot and have won six of eight on a 10-game trip. 
Edmonds was 3-for-3 with his 37th and 38th homers, two walks and an RBI single. He connected off Lawrence (13-11) to lead off the second and again off Steve Watkins in the seventh on the front end of back-to-hack homers with Renteria. 
Montreal 8, Chicago 0 
Livan Hernandez allowed three hits in eight scoreless innings, and Brad Wilkerson and Maicer Izturis each hit home runs in the Montreal Expos' victory over the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday night.

. Izturis made it 5-0 in the fourth with his first major league homer. 
Houston 8, Cincinnati 0

Carlos Beltran, -Jeff Bagwell and Lance Berkman hit consec­utive home runs for the Astros, winners of a season-high five straight and eight of nine over­all. 
Brandon Backe (2-2) scat­tered three hits over six shutout innings to win for the first time in three career starts. He threw seven shutout innings in a no­decision against Chicago in his first career start on August 21. 
The ReQ.s got just on~ runner past second base against Backe. Barry Larkin went to third on Sean Casey's two-out double in the sixth, but Backe struck out Adam Dunn to end the threat. 
Atlanta 5, Philadelphia 3 
Mike Hampton has few expla­nations for the turnaround that's made him one of base­ball's best pitchers over the past few weeks. 
Hampton pitched two-hit ball over eight innings and Andruw Jones hit a two-run homer to lead the Atlanta Braves to a vic­tory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Tuesday night. 
"Confidence is pretty high and, in this game, when you've got confidence anything can happen," Hampton said. 
Eli Marrero went 3-for-4 and Julio Franco had two RBis for the Braves, who went 20-8 this month, marking just their sec­ond 20-win August since mov­ing to Atlanta from Milwaukee after the 1965 season. They also did it in 1999, going 21-7. 
Milwaukee 4, Pittsburgh 2 
The Milwaukee Brewers snapped a 12-game losing streak and avoided their worst month in franchise history with a 4-2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Tuesday night. 
Geoff Jenkins' two-run double highlighted a four-run first inning off rookie right-hander John Van Benschoten, and Milwaukee's beleaguered bullpen turned in a solid per­formance after lefty Doug Davis was knocked out in the second inning with a bruised forearm 
The Brewers went 6-21 in August, barely avoiding their worst month in franchise histo­ry (6-22 by the Seattle Pilots in August 1969). Still, it was their worst month since moving to Milwaukee in 1970, displacing the 6-20 mark from July 2001.

Florida 5, New York 0 
Josh Beckett saved his best for the Big Apple again. 
Beckett pitched a six-hitter for his first regular-season shutout, leading the Florida Marlins over the New York Mets 5-0 on Tuesday night for their fifth consecutive victory. 
Of course, it wasn't quite the finest performance of Beckett's four-year major league career. He threw two shutouts in the 2003 postseason, including a five-hitter in a 2-0 victory at Yankee Stadium in the World Series clincher. 
"Maybe I'm more comfortable here, I don't know," Beckett said. "I was just going to go at 'em today I'm not going to pick." 
Juan Pierre hit a two-run sin­gle and the Marlins took advan­tage of a career-high seven walks by Steve Trachsel, who lost his fourth straight start. Beckett drove in a run with a bases-loaded walk and Paul Lo Duca had an RBI single. 
Florida, which moved within three games of the NL wild-card lead, won for the eighth time in 10 games to improve to six games over .500 for the first time since June 24. 
"We're relaxed because everybody counted us out already. That's the way we like it," manager Jack McKeon said. "That's what happened last year they can't win. Fine, great." 
Beckett (6-8) struck out two and walked none to win for only the second time since May 20, when he beat Houston 4-3. The World Series MVP was 1-5 with a 5.21 ERA in his previous 10 starts, but he dominated New York's depleted lineup. 
"I wouldn't say he was as sharp tonight as he was against the Yankees. But it was good enough," McKeon said. 
Beckett threw 80 of his 116 pitches for strikes and retired 13 of his final 14 batters. 
San Francisco 9, Colorado 5 
Yorvit Torrealba and Marquis Grissom homered, and Ray Durham hit a tiebreaking three­run double to lead the San Francisco Giants over the slumping Colorado Rockies on Tuesday night. 
Barry Bonds went 1-for-2 with a double and remained at 696 career home runs, but the Giants got enough offense from other sources to move into a virtual tie with the Chicago Cubs for the wild-card lead, a half-game ahead of San Diego. 
Brett Tomko (8-6) won his third straight decision, which included his first career shutout last Thursday a four-hitter in a 5-0 win over the Florida Marlins. 
Dustin Hermanson relieved Jim Brower with two runners aboard in the ninth, then got three outs for his eighth save in 10 chances. 
Torrealba hit a solo homer deep into the left-field bleachers in the second off Jeff Francis (0­
2) his career-high fifth homer. Grissom chased Francis with a three-run shot to left on a full­count in the fifth. 
Vinny Castilla and Luis Gonzalez each homered for the Rockies, who lost their eighth straight and are off to an 0-7 start on their season-high 12­game road trip. 
Los Angeles 4, Arizona 1 
Steve Finley hit a three-run double in the 13th inning in his return to Arizona, lifting the Los Angeles Dodgers to victory over ._ the Diamondbacks on Tuesday night. 
Finley also homered off Randy Johnson as he faced Arizona for the first time since the Diamondbacks traded him on July 31. 
Brian Bruney (3-4) gave up a leadoff single to Alex Cora and, one out later, walked pinch-hit­ter Hee Seop Choi and Cesar Izturis to load the bases. Bruney fell behind Finley 3-0, got a strike and then threw a pitch down the middle that Finley drove into the left-field gap to score all the runners. 
Dodgers closer Eric Gagne (5­

3) pitched two scoreless innings for the win, and Giovanni Carrara pitched a perfect 13th for his second save. 
Johnson, 0-2 in three starts since pitching into the ninth in a 2-0 shutout win over the New York Mets on Aug. 15, struck out a season-high 15 and allowed three hits and one walk in eight innings. He increased his major league-leading strike­outs total to 242, and left him with 4,113 in his career 23 shy of tying Steve Carlton for the most by a left-bander.

IN BRIEF 
Brackett ready to step in 
for Colts 
INDIANAPOLIS -To some, he's too small to play middle linebacker in the NFL. 
But Gary Brackett, all 5-foot-11 of him thinks that he can be a force for the Indianapolis Colts this season. 
Brackett was a surprise when he made the Colts' roster as an undraft­ed free agent a year ago. 
The former Rutgers standout proved he could hold his own in the NFL. 
"A lot of people have talked about my size, but I've never seen it as a problem," he said Tuesday. "I think that I showed people last year that I could play in this league and play well if I was given the opportunity. The Colts gave me that chance last year, and I'm still here." 
He said he uses the talk about his size to his advantage. 
"The way the game is now, it's more based on speed and quickness than it is on size," he said. 

The Glassboro, N.J., native played in 16 games a year ago and had 16 tackles, mostly on special teams. 
He also returned an interception for a 31-yard touchdown against Denver Broncos quarterback Jake Plummer. 
He has been splitting time this pre­season with veteran starter Rob Morris, and that rotation could carry into the regular season. 
"Gary is playing well. We're alter­nating those guys. Gary's done a good job. Rob's done a good job. We feel like we have two pretty good players there," said Colts coach Tony Dungy. 
He said Morris is probably ahead of Bracket on the depth chart. 
"(Morris) was the starter there last year and has really done nothing to show that he shouldn't be," Dungy said. Knight in works with CBS to develop half-hour sitcom 
LUBBOCK, Texas -The life and times of Bob Knight could soon be right inside America's living rooms. 
The fiery Texas Tech coach met with television officials last month in Los Angeles and gave his approval for a sitcom deal. CBS and Paramount Television are exploring the development of a half-hour com­edy that could run by next year. 
Knight, 63, would serve as a con­sultant and said he might make guest appearances. 
"Right now it's still in an embryon­ic stage," Lindy DeKoven, who would serve as the show's executive pro­ducer, told the Lubbock Avalanche­Journal for Tuesday's editions. "Right now we don't have a writer yet, so we can't get into too much detail. But, it would be a half-hour comedy based on Bobby's charac­ter." 
Knight was out of town Tuesday and couldn't be reached for com­ment. The next step is for a writer will come to Lubbock to spend time getting to know Knight at work and at home.

Roddick, Sharapova notch vvins 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK Maria Sharapova nearly found out just how quickly one can go from diva to disaster. 
No reigning Wimbledon women's champion has lost in the first round of the U.S. Open, and Sharapova was just one game from that fate. Then she steeled herself to claim 12 of the last 14 points and got past Laura Granville 6-3, 5-7, 7-5 Tuesday 

AP 

Andy Roddick serves during his first round victory over Scoville Jenkins. Roddick won In straight sets. 
night. 
"My game went off for a while. 
I went to La-La Land," the 17­
year-old Siberian-turned­
Floridian said, "but I came back 
to Earth." 
She wasn't the only top player pushed to the limit on Day 2 at Flushing Meadows: 2000 Open winner Marat Satin and 11th­seeded Rainer Schuettler lost, while 2003 runner-up Juan Carlos Ferrero and No. 5 Tim Henman both needed five sets to advance. 
Salin, Schuettler and Ferrero were put in the same quarter of the draw as 2003 champion Andy Roddick, who followed Sharapova in Arthur Ashe Stadium and broke the tourna­ment record with a 152 mph serve during a 6-0, 6-2, 6-2 vic­tory over 17 -year-old Scoville Jenkins. 
One indication of how players slide from star to afterthought: While Sharapova was on the National Tennis Center's main stage, 2000-01 Open champ Venus Williams was in the last day-session match on another court. 
Made to wait until after 8:30 
p.m. to play, because she was scheduled to hit the court after Henman and Ferrero, Williams was broken while serving for the match but eventually pulled out a 6-3, 7-6 (3) win over 64th­ranked Petra Mandula of Hungary. 
"What I need to focus on for me right now is th·e second round," said Williams, seeded No. 11 after a year of injuries and earlier-than-usual.losses at majors. ''I'm not really thinking ahead too far." 
After cruising through the first set against 68th-ranked 
Granville of Chicago before a 
subdued crowd, Sharapova was 
suddenly in trouble late in the 
second. Down 6-5, Sharapova 
faced her first break point of the 
match, which she saved with a 
101 mph service winner on a 
second serve. But she double­
faulted to grant Granville anoth­
er break point, then slapped a 
forehand into the net. 
Granville never beyond the second round at the Open was within a game of a serious sur­prise, ahead 5-4 in the third set. That's when Sharapova took over, holding at 15, breaking at love with a superb cross-court backhand winner, then holding again at 15. 
All the while, the photogra­phers in their courtside pit trained their equipment on the 6-foot Sharapova, who's repre­sented by a modeling agency. Most of the time, about 40 cam­eras followed her, and one or two followed Granville. 
"Wimbledon was an amazing thing, winning it, but now I have to sort of move on," said Sharapova, who came to the Open just 3-3 since becoming the third-youngest champion in 127 years at the All England Club. "You're sort of a celebrity, and people want a piece of you." 
When she hit her 1Oth ace, fol­lowed by a service winner, to end it, her sunglasses-wearing lather jumped and pounded his list on his chest. Sharapova mimicked that gesture, then just as she did after stunning Serena Williams in Wimbledon's fmal in July went to grab her phone to call Mom. 
"It's all about the spirit," Sharapova said after her 2-hour, 9-minute adventure. "Hanging in there, and trying to do your best."

Baltimore tunes in to Prime Time 
Cornerback Sanders, 37, leaves retirement to playfor Ravens 
Associated Press 

OWINGS MILLS -Deion Sanders is back in the NFL, this time with the Baltimore Ravens. 
The seven-time Pro Bowl defensive back passed his physi­cal Tuesday and formally ended his retirement by signing a one­year contract laden with incen­tives. Sanders will practice with the team for the first time Wednesday, and expects to play in the Ravens' season AFC North title and advance to the Super Bowl. 
"Based on people we've talked to, opinions we trust, I'm sure there's no question he's going to be able to compete. At the level he competed before? There's very few of us that can do things as well as we did before. At 50, I can attest to that," Billick said. "But what he will bring to the table for us will be substantial." 
Sanders' experience will also be invaluable to a defensive unit that will look to him for guid­ance. During his days with the Atlanta Falcons, San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys when he was known as

BYU's retaining Francisco would be the equivalent of the Irish getting Courtney Watson at linebacker for one more year. 
The Irish had the Cougars scheduled to host a game Oct. 30 anyway, but a schedule change during the summer placed Notre Dame and BYU at the beginning of their respective schedules. 
Though Julius Jones and the Irish offense pounded BYU for 33 points, a different and more experienced Cougar team returns. Just as the Irish will seek revenge on teams like USC and Michigan, BYU will be out to prove last year's loss to Notre Dame a fluke. 
"BYU is a far better team at home than they were on the road ... last year," Willingham said. "I don't think there's any question in our minds that this is a very dangerous and very explosive team when they are playing foot­ball the way they can play it." 
In the preseason so far, BYU has had some trouble with con­sistency. In one team scrimmage, . the Cougars defense surrendered

Do the d-back shuffle 
Willingham names Jackson, and Ellick as starting DB's 
By PAT LEONARD 
Assistant Sports Editor 

After preseason InJury watches and practice obser­vation, Tyrone Willingham and his staff have deter­mined the defensive back­field starters. 
"I think right now we're leaning toward Preston Jackson and Dwight Ellick [at cornerback]," Willingham said. 
Senior Quentin Burrell gets the nod at f r c e safety after sit­ting out t h e majority of fall practice with an injury. T h e strong safety spot is up for g r a b s s t i l I between senior Lionel Bolen and sophomore Freddie Parish. 
And though the coaches have stepped up and defini­tively named three of the four starters in the defen­sive backfield, they acknowl­edge the uncertainty of a relatively inexperienced sec­ondary. 
"In terms of their passing game, we do have some inexperience in our second­ary," Willingham said. " W h a t we've got to 



"What we've got to do is ably say

Ellick, Burrell and Bolen are all seniors, but the playing time over the past few seasons has gone primarily to departed play­ers such as Shane Walton and Vontez Duff at corner­back, and Glenn Earl and Garron Bible at the safety positions. 
Burrell has the most expe­rience and is expected to be a secondary leader behind a defensive line that could help the rest of the defense handle passing attacks. 
"If we can count on the Justins (Tuck). the. Victors (Abiamiri). the Kyles (Budinsack). the Gregs (Pauly) to really apply some pressure to that quarterback and make it really uncom­fortable for him ... then Wl help our secondary out, Willingham said. 
Burrell finished fourth iL the Irish in tackles last sea­son· with 58 total and 3<:1 solos. He intercepted four passes and recovered tw fumbles. 
Bolen started one gaml' last season against Florida State and played in 10 other games. collecting 12 tackles. 
Ellick played in 10 game~ in 2003, recording 21 tack­les. Jackson made 24 tackle~ last season and intercepted one pass. playing in all 12 games as primarily a nickel back. 
Notes 
+ Defensive backs coach Steven Wilks and defensive coordinator Kent Baer have rooted through their talent and pulled an interesting game plan out of fall camp. 
In a normal cover-two defense that features two cornerbacks, two safeties and three linebackers. Jackson and Ellick will get the start at the cornerback slots. But Jackson will shift positions when the defense changes. 
."Preston will shift to nickel back and [senior] Carlos Campbell will most likely be the cornerback," Baer said of when opposing offenses spilt three wide receivers outside. 
"In the dime [defense]. it will probably be Mike Richardson [in as the fourth defensive back]." Baer said. 
+ Though young players like Darius Walker and Justin Hoskins have impressed in practices and scrimmages, Tyrone Willingham said no fresh­man should see the field 
Saturday. ''I'd prob­
positioning 

themselves, but I think to start this opening ballgame, I would probably say zero [freshmen will play)." 
+ Willingham has not decided one-hundred per­cent on who will return kicks Saturday night, but he gave a hint of the personnel Tuesday. 
"Probably our starter in the punt return will be Rhema [McKnight] starting there, and our kickoff return we're still making that deci­sion," he said.

five games a week. He is in a "dynasty" with guys in Keenan, and the eight of them play fre­quently. But he had a scare in the second round. 
With just 30 seconds to play, he was faced with a fourth-and-11, down by seven points against Southern California. He converted the fourth down, went on to score and then won in overtime to keep his chances alive. 
"1 just got lucky," he said. 
For Ramsour. the dream of playing football for Notre Dame was only reachable via video games. 
"I figured since I'm not good enough to be on the Notre Dame team, I'd just get on the stick," he said. 
The contest, sponsored by the Student Union Board, was open to 128 students. However, due to a flaw in the online registration process of EA Sports, many stu­dents weren't given the ability to sign up. 
"We were very excited to work with EA Sports, but the sign-up process was flawed," said Ashley Sinnott, Student Union Board spe­cia! events programmer. "It's not SUB's fault. People who weren't students were allowed to enroll. It was a good event, and we wish there was a better turnout. It's unfortunate that's how it worked out." 
Notre Dame was the first stop on the tour for EA Sports, which is doing this contest for the first time. In the past, they have done the competition with Madden NFL games. 
"We're used to Madden," Trey Geiger, of the EA Sports lifestyle marketing department said. "So it's a high bar. It's the first event. You go back to our first-ever Madden Challenge, and it wasn't as high ~ you expected either." 
But Geiger wasn't discouraged by the relatively low turnout. 
"Everybody who came out had a good time," he said. "A lot of guys said, 'Hey call me when you're corning back next year.' You can't expect to come out of nowhere and have everyone know about it. But I think a lot knew about it, it was just they thought it was full." 
Regardless, Ramsour is going to Las Vegas with a chance at $10,000, and he is excited. 
"Vegas, baby, Vegas!"

Including tonight's contest, the Irish will have four home matches in the next week. They will square off with Nebraska on Friday and Saturday while facing Valparaiso Tuesday. All matches begin at 7 p.m. at the Joyce Center. 
The Irish will look to duplicate much of the success of last year's team. The 2003 Notre Dame squad split the Big East regular season championship and finished second in the con­ference tournament while extending their streak of NCAA Tournament berths to twelve. 
Captain Meg Henican believes the Irish are ready to start the year ofT right. 
"Our goal every time we step on the court is to win," she said. "Obviously that won't be easy as Loyola is a great team." 
Four starters return from last year for the Irish -juniors Henican; Lauren Brewster and Lauren Kelbley along with sen­ior Emily Loomis. 
Loomis, Brewster and Kelbley were named honorable mention All-Americans last season and are the only trio in school histo­ry to record 350 kills apiece in the same year. As a sophomore, Loomis was named the Big East Tournament Most Outstanding Player. Brewster led the country in blocks last year with 1.78 per game while Kelbley holds a .325 career hitting percentage, the second best in school history. Henican is also a player to watch as she sports a 3.15 career dig average, which ranks as second-best in school history. 

After playing against each other during the preseason, the Irish are ready for some fresh competition. 
"I am excited that the team will finally get an opportunity to play," Brown said. "The presea­son is fine but there is nothing like getting the chance to play someone else."

Vegas trip becomes a reality for champ Ramsour

.Junior Bon Hamsour took home the 2004 EA Sports Football Challenge Tuesday night, winning the championship 10-7 as Louisiana State in the three-hour event. 
"I know if I played my game, I'd put myself in position to win," the Keenan llall resident said of the contest, which was played on Playstation2 systems. 
Hamsour defeated Knott Hall sophomore Trey Patrick, who played as Florida State in all his games, except for one. 
"I thought it was gonna take up too much time from school work," 


Hamsour was the winner of 50 participants, each of which could chose to be any team in the game. A'i a result, Hamsour will travel to Las Vegas Dec. 10-11, where he will face off against 15 other win­ners from schools such as Purdue, Penn State and Oklahoma, for a chance to win $10,000. 
''I'm pumped," he said. "I'll be 21 by the time I go, so it'll be even better."

Nebraska match 
By MIKE GILLOON Sports Writer 
With a dynasty like Nebraska waiting to eonverge on the Joyce Center later this week, it might be tempting for the Irish to over­look their opening match against Loyola Chicago tonight at 7 p.m. 
Fortunately for Notre Dame, coach Debbie Brown won't let that happen. 
"There is a huge danger in looking past anyone," Jjrown said. "The resull'i will take care of themselves if we just take it one match at a time." 
The No. 25 Irish will need to keep that in mind as they face a talented Hamblers team that returns four starters, featuring two-time AVCA All-Midwest Hegion setter Lauren llolbrook.
