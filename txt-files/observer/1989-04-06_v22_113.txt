VALDEZ, Alaska --The tanker Exxon Valdez was freed Wednesday from the reef that ripped its hull and spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude oil, and Alaska's governor said the Coast Guard would take over the cleanup from Exxon. 
Elsewhere, the captain of the Exxon Valdez surrendered to police and was ordered held on $1 million bond. 
Cleanup crews continued to skim mayonnaise-thick oil from Prince William Sound, but progress was slow and the oil had spread over an area larger than Delaware. The animal death toll rose and sal­mon hatcheries remained en­dangered. 
In Juneau, Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper said he asked the Coast Guard to take over the much­maligned and slowly progress­ing cleanup effort from Exxon, and that the federal agency had agreed. 
Cowper said the Coast Guard should be better able to handle coordination and management of the cleanup than Exxon, which he said was too bureau­cratic. 
"Maybe that's been the prob­lem all along. You need a mil­itary system to get things done," the governor said.

WARSAW, Poland Solidarity leader Lech W alesa sealed a historic deal with the government Wednesday to res­tore the independent trade union after a seven-year ban and give Poland its first dem­ocratic elections since World War II. 
Walesa, representing the op­position, and Gen. Czeszlaw Kiszczak the interior minister representing Poland's commu­nist government, approved the package that emerged from two months of negotiations on political and economic reforms, as the 57 participants in the talks gathered for a final time at the "round table" in the Council of Ministers Palace. 
"There is no freedom without Solidarity," W alesa said at the beginning of a 10-minute ad­dress to the table in which he explained why the opposition 
Cheerleaders named for 1989/90 season 
By MICHELLE DALL Senior Staff Reporter 
Three new members were added to the 1989-90 Notre Dame cheerleading squad after try-outs concluded Wednesday night in the Joyce Athletic and·Convoca­tion Center. 
Six female and five male cheerleaders, as well as one female and one male alter­nate, were selected from the pool of 36 applicants, accor­ding to sophomore Don Gomez, current captain of the men's squad. As captain, Gomez was not required to try out for the new team. 
The 1989-90 cheerleaders include: juniors Brendan Teehan, Nick Farmer, John Ryan, Stephanie Hayashi and Kristin Komyatte; sopc homores Don Gomez, Don Stager, Zac Nagle, Keilleen .· ...· Phelan, Claudia Limardo and Kathleen Kelley; and freshman Jessica Chiappet­ta. 

Sophomores Kevin Suggs and Michelle Paraiso were selected as alternates, and junior Chris Ryan will be the new leprachaun. Ryan was the sole contestant for the mascot position. 
According ·.to Gomez, ··.·· every cheerleader from the 1988-89 season re-applied for a position on the new squad, with the exception of five. seniors who will be graduat­ing this spring.

"We appreciate the efforts of Exxon --we think they were done in good faith. But we think there has to be a much more disciplined management struc­ture," Cowper said at a Capitol news conference. 
President Bush earlier had sent a team of high-level offi­cials to Valdez and determined that federal management of the cleanup wasn't necessary. 
Although Cowper said he didn't want to be "extremely critical" of Exxon, a letter sent to the Coast Guard by a state environmental official 'said Ex­xon had been unresponsive. 
"Exxon has failed to provide ... the information necessary to make sound planning recom­mendations regarding the cleanup of oil and the protec­tion of resources," wrote Lynn Kent, chief of the state Oil and Hazardous Substance Spill Response Section. 
Exxon spokesman Henry Beathard· said the company disagreed with charges it wasn't handling the cleanup properly and thought Exxon was the best organization to inanage the effort. 
"We gathered all the re­sources and organized the cleanup. We think the most ef­fective and efficient way to carry out this project is (for Exxon) to continue," Beathard said. 
Fired tanker captain Joseph Hazelwood, 42, surrendered to police on New York's Long Is­land and a judge set his bail at $500,000, up from a prosecu­tor's recommendation of $25,000. He had been sought since Saturday on a fugitive warrant on misdemeanor charges of operating the tanker while drunk. 
"These misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that -has never been equaled, at least in . this country," Judge Kenneth Rohl said as Hazelwood was ar­raigned. "He's got to think about that. We have a man­made destruction that has not been equaled, probably, since Hiroshima." 
Salvage crews pumped com­pressed air into the $125 million ship and floated it off Bligh Reef, 25 miles from the port of Valdez. From there, it began a 30-mile journey under the con­trol of six tugs to a remote cove off Naked Island for temporary repairs, picking its . way through scattered icebergs.

had approved the agreements. 
He credited authorities with having shown "readiness for a radical change of the system." 
But he said that behind the "nice words" of communist authorities for the past 45 years there was "dishonesty and vio­lence," and Solidarity had aimed for "substantial settle­ments that could be imple­mented right away." 
He declared the opposition had achieved the "necessary minimum" by regaining the le­gal status lost after martial law was imposed in December 1981. negotiated them. 
The government agreed to restore legal status to Solidarity, the farmers' union Rural Solidarity and the Inde­pendent Students Association. All had been banned in the martial-law crackdown. 
In exchange, the Solidarity­led opposition agreed to partie­ipate in June elections to the 460-seat Sejm, or parliament, that guarantee the Communist Party and its allies a 65 percent majority. 
But a new 10-member senate to be created would be the first fully democratically chosen legislative chamber in the East bloc. Anyone who collected 3,000 signatures could get on the ballot and all the seats would be openly contested.

WORLD BRIEFS 



In the heat of the 
London's subway system was crippled by a strike Wednesday as more than 60 percent of the train drivers shut down service to wide areas of the capital. The Circle, Metropolitan, District, East London and Jubilee lines were closed, and the Piccadilly line, which serves Heathrow Airport, closed after a few hours of service. Normal service was maintained only on the Northern, Victoria and Central lines. Wednesday's action was taken by drivers seeking a pay raise of $108 per week for operating trains without a second crew member, known as a guard, who operates the doors. 
Vietnam will withdraw from Cambodia by Sept. 30, nearly 11 years after an invasion tha.t ended the brutal Khmer Rouge regime and started a civil war. Wednesday's announcement, issued as a joint statement in Phnom Penh, Hanoi and Vientiane, capital of Laos, did not indicate any conditions were attached. It said an international commission including Canada, Poland, Indonesia and India was welcome to supervise the withdrawal, and called for an end to outside military aid. 
The body of Vladimir Lenin is in no immediate danger of rotting away, the Communist Party newspaper reported Wed­nesday. The Soviet founder's body has been lying in state for 65 years. The body lies beneath glass in a special marble-and­granite mausoleum on Red Square. Five days a week, visitors are hustled past the body in a dimly lighted room where no photographs are allowed. There has long been speculation that the technology did not exist when Lenin died in 1924 to preserve him, and that the body is a wax dummy. In the Pravda interview, a laboratory spokesman confirmed that at first, Soviet scientists did not think they could preserve the body of the revered leader. Lenin's wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, was against having Lenin embalmed, but she was overruled by the Communist Party lead­ership. 
NATIONAL BRIEFS 

Mob boss Nicodemo "Little Nicky" Sarcfo and seven associates were convicted Wednesday on first-degree murder charges in the 1985 slaying of another gangster and could face the electric chair. Jurors deliberated about three hours before returning the verdict on all counts in the slaying of Frank "Frankie Flowers" D'Alfonso in July 1985. The jury will begin consideration Thursday on whether the defendants should face death in the electric chair. No other mobster in the nation, or­ganized crime investigators say, has ever been sentenced to death.

Lawrence County Prosecutor Charlene Hall will seek the death penalty against a man charged with murder in the stabbing death of his estranged wife. David J. Gardner, 30, is being held without bond in the Lawrence County Jail in the death of Paula 
K. Gardner, 25. Mrs. Gardner's body was found last month buried near railroad tracks behind her parents' Bedford, Ind., home, where she had been living. Mrs. Gardner had filed for divorce last December. The final divorce hearing had been scheduled the day her body was found. According to court documents, aut­horities believe Gardner parked his truck near Mrs. Gardner's parents' home the night of March 1, waited for her to return home and then stabbed her to death. The body was found the next day.

night... 
My dorm room is too hot. 
Unfortunately, the heat can't be attributed to the three gorgeous girls who live there or the fabulous parties held in its confines. 
It's too damned hot because we can't adjust our thermostat. 
In most rooms, temperature can ideally be regulated by turning a knob or adjusting a valve on the radiator. Regulating the heat in my room, however, typically means prying open a window or shedding a sweater. 
Although RAs caution open windows may in­vite prowlers or lonely men, my roommates and I take our chances. After all, it would take Spiderman to scale Farley's walls. 
On the verge of heat stroke and possible dehydration, we've filed countless complaints about the. soaring temps. Sometimes our re­quests are actually heeded, and the tempera­ture dips below the hundred degree mark for a few days. Eventually, however, the mercury gradually climbs back into the nineties, and we're soon left basking in our tropical hotbox. 
There's no problem in the early autumn or late spring, because the heat's shut off. In December, however, when most South Bend students are bundled up in wool blankets and flannel pajamas, my roommates and I are sporting tank tops and sucking ice cubes. In fact, it's so hot, we have all three of our fans running simultaneously, resulting in tornado winds in the epicenter of the room. 
Nighttime is particularly wretched. I sleep on the bottom bunk with a window above my head. Directly behind me, beneath the window, is a three foot radiator. 
From October to April, the radiator emits heat--whether we like it or not. Maybe--un­beknowst to any of us--there's actually a way to turn down the thermostat, but we've never quite mastered the technique. This lack of me­chanical expertise results in many a hot, sleep­less night, and led us to dub the heater the "towering inferno." 
By early morning, cool breezes finally drift through the window, but, alas, they provide no relief. Since the heater is strategically located between the bed and the window, every

semblance of a cool breeze is effectively cooked before it reaches me. Even an Arctic wind would thaw in our room. 
The radiator not only converts our dorm room into a sweltering sweatbox, but also constantly emits strange gurgling and hissing sounds like a geyser readly to spew scalding steam. 
Fearing an actual explosion from "Old Faith­
ful," I've decided to sleep with my head facing 
away from the window and my feet by the 
radiator. This way, I'm able to catch an oc­
casional breeze on my baked brow if someone 
opens the door quickly, and once in a while I 
can feel a draft accross my face from a hole in 
the floor somewhere nearby. (I have forced 
myself not to consider the ramifications of that 
last fact.) 
When I finally do fall asleep, I have dreams 
of "Body Heat," "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" and 
"Out of Africa," so I guess there are some cul­
tural advantages to living in a steam bath. 
Don't let anyone tell you the upper Midwest 
is frigid in winter. It's a well-disguised fact, 
but the Torrid Zone is actually located on the 
third floor of Farley Hall in northern Indiana. 
In fact, my roommates and I are probably the 
only college students in America who dream of 
heading north for Spring Break and fleeing to 
Iceland in April.

Baker meets with Israel's Shamir 


Associated Press 
WASHINGTON --Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Thursday he was encouraged by suggestions by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir for settling the Arab­Israeli dispute. 
Baker commented after a two-hour meeting with Shamir that the secretary called "very productive, useful and very friendly." 
For his part, Shamir said he had offered "some ways to solve" problems in the Mideast and remarked: 
"I feel we have started a very serious discussion. Our con­
versation was very friendly."

the Palestinians launched a 
concerted campaign to chal­
lenge Israel, the territories 
have been shrouded by vio­
lence in which 419 Palestinians 
and 18 Israelis have died. 

Shamir has ruled out 
negotiating with the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, which 
he holds responsible for that 
violence and for an unceasing 
campaign of terrorism against 
Israel. 

He told a conference of 
Jewish-American organization 
leaders that sitting with the 
PLO would "bring disaster." 
Instead, he has sought to revive the 1978 Camp David agreements' promise of a transitional period of autonomy for the Palestinians and then negotiations for an overall settlement. 
"The prime minister has made some suggestions," Baker said. "We are going to continue our discussion with the objective of moving the peace process forward, if it's possible to do so. They were very encouraging. Hopefully they will form the basis under which we can move the peace process forward." 
Shamir follows Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to Washington, who said toward the end of his visit Tuesday that he saw no way to stop the vio­lence in the territories. 
"If anybody could stop it, we would be very pleased," Mubarak said, asking, "But how?"

Bush proposes $441 million for education 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON --President Bush, who campaigned on a promise to be "the education president," on Wednesday sent Congress a $441 million educa­tion package designed to reward and promote school im­provements. 
"We're going to take action --action to make excellence in education not just a rallying cry, but a classroom reality," Bush said at a Rose Garden ceremony outside the White House. 
His "Excellence in Educa­tion Act," based in part on campaign pledges, would reward outstanding schools, teachers and science scholars, encourage districts to create magnet schools with special curriculums, push states to develop new ways to certify teachers, help drug-ridden ur­ban schools and bolster the en­dowments of historically black colleges. 
"These education initiatives don't constitute a cure-all, a quick fix," Bush said. He added 

Bayh considers drug testing for new drivers 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS --Gov. Evan Bayh may look into a federal pilot program to randomly test first-time drivers license appli­cants for drug use, a spokes­man says. 
"It sounds like something we would want to look at seriously, but we'd like to see the proposal first," said deputy press secre­tary Phil Schermerhorn. 
Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., urged Bayh in a letter Tuesday to apply for the program, ap­proved by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act authorized by Congress last year. It calls for the federal government to fund four model drug testing programs in dif­ferent states. 
"Drug abuse continues to be a major problem for our country and our state," the freshman senator said in the letter. "Approximately 10 per­cent of our population --23

EDITORIAL 

Library must meet student needs 
The Association of Research Libraries' ranking of the Notre Dame library as 74th is a misleading, yet revealing number. Unfortunately, the study does not measure the primary objective of a university li­brary: how well the library meets the needs of stu­dents and faculty. 
The University has tried to focus on attracting top­notch faculty and raising faculty salaries for the past ten years. Yet, the most sought after professors are less likely to come to Notre Dame without the research facilities an exceptional library provides. 
An excellent library should be a University priority. 
Specifically, there are two areas in which the library could improve to better meet the needs of students: the increase in the number and availibility of qualified staff and the extension of library hours. 
One revealing aspect of the ARL study was that only 14 schools had fewer staff members than Notre Dame. This situation must be remedied. In order to best meet the needs of the faculty and students, the library must increase the number of staff. With the increase in the number of qualified staff, we hope will come the extension of the Micro Text and Audio-Reserve readings department hours. 
A problem not revealed by the rankings is the lim­ited time Notre Dame's library is open for student and faculty use. Most university libraries, for instance the University of Pennsylvania's and Harvard Uni­versity's, are open 24 hours. However, extending the hours from approximately 16 to 24 does not seem practical at this time. 
We recommend an extension of library hours for 
two hours on Sundays through Thursdays. Few stu­
dents use the library during the morning hours be­
cause of class schedules, and the extension of library 
hours would give students a quiet place for late study. 
The increase in qualified staff and extension of li­
brary hours are two problems that would help our 
library better meet student needs.

Israel: Land of chaos and corruption 
BY MICHAEL CARRIGAN 
-

The small humble square is an unlikely spot for a holy site. A church tower rises towards the sky, stretching away from the darkened stones. The foundations of the ancient churches impress visitors with both their history, and the im­portance of the site on which they rest. The square is peace­fully alive with shops and ven­dors. Discarded cans and wrappers are a reminder of the modern age in this seemingly timeless spot. 
Like a small hint of rain, a gentle mist gildes into the square. Soon its smell divulges the true identity of the cloud. It is not a gentle fog of rain, but the violent, burning am­monia smell of tear gas. A bit­ter conflict spills into the square as the peace is shat­tered by shouts and gunshots. Pilgrims and shopkeepers scurry inside as their places are taken by masked protesters and armed soldiers. 
The place is the Israeli occu­pied west bank, and is also known as the manger square in Bethlehem, the birthplace of Christ. This spot, one of the world's holiest for Christians, 
LETTERS 
Sports legendleaves NO 
Dear Editor: 
As the 1988-89 athletic year at Notre Dame comes to a close, I would like to recognize a certain Irish sports legend for 
long,  devoted  service  to  the  
University.  
Earlier in  the year  Roger  

V aldiserri relinquished his title of Sports Information Director in the athletic department after serving for over 20 years in that capacity. In his long and dis­tinguished career, Roger be­came the standard by which all other SIDs are judged. He was regarded as the "best in the business" and did his job with unprecedented profes­sionalism and integrity. He was the perfect publicity chief for Notre Dame. A graduate of the University, he typified everything Notre Dame stood for--a deep belief in academic credibility within the athletic department, an unmatched drive for success on the field and a manner of style and class unseen anywhere in athletic communications. 
Over the years Roger helped countless young professionals is not a place of peace but one of constant and often deadly violence. The irony of manger square is not an exception in 
the holy land, but the rule.  
When the state of Israel was founded over 40 years ago, it was to be the antithesis of the Jews' most awful enemy: Hit­ler's Germany. It was to be an example of democracy, equality, freedom or religion and justice for all the world to turn. From the ashes of World War II, the Israeli people bravely challenged themselves to establish a better country in the land of their patriarchs. 
Ironically, this ideal is no more reality today than it was in 1948. Today, the Israeli gov­ernment uses many of the same methods to control the Pales­tinians that were used in Jewish persecutions for centuries. Regularly homes are sealed or destroy~d and schools are closed. Arab leaders are har­rassed or imprisoned. Special licence plates, and personal identity cards single out Pales­tinians for detention and searches. The high ideals of the early zionists have been yet an­other casualty of Israeli occu­pation and war with the Arabs. 
Still another irony is far more 
get started in the business. I was one of those. I served un­der Roger as an Assistant Sports Information Director for four years (1982-86) and it was the most enjoyable time of my career. 
I'm just one .of many who have been touched profes­sionally and personally by Roger. Thanks for everything, Roger. The University owes you a great deal of appreciation for such dedicated, loyal and devoted service.

NO foreigner wants change 
Dear Editor: 
I have just arrived at Notre Dame from China. I am con­cerned about getting the chance to practice my English often. 
While I was in China, I knew someone who had graduated from Manchester University and lived in England for five years. But I was surprised that his English was quite poor. Why? I wondered about it. After I arrived at Notre Dame, simple. Jews, Christians, and Moslems have fought, lived, and died for this land since the birth of their faiths. In the name of Yahweh, Christ, and Allah, each teligion has made special claim to Israel, and preached of it's importance. What is unbelievable is they fight for the land with one hand, and destroy it with another. Is­rael is a land covered with trash and litter, even in its most holy places. The roads linking the towns are lined with rusting cars and rotting litter. For all their speeches and weapons, all those who claim this land cannot even keep it clean. 
Perhaps it is because this is God's land that Israel is so complex and paradoxical. But hopefully one day the holy places in this land will no longer be surrounded by armed guards and litter, but peace and mutual respect. This should be a goal for all the world, not only because it will save lives, but because God would want it so, whether he or she is Yahweh, Christ, or Allah. 
Michael Carrigan is a junior government and Hesburgh Program major in Notre Dame's Jerusalem Program. 
I saw that many foreign stu­dents live with students from the same country. I was further surprised to find that all of the students are from the same country in a big graduate stu­dent office. So, I guess that many foreign students only have the chance to practice their English in English class. I have found out why some­body's English was very poor even after he lived in an English-speaking country. 
In China, the school usually appoints a Chinese student to room with a foreign student, so the foreign student can benefit from this. I wonder why the Notre Dame administration cannot do the same as the Chinese college administra­tions. Let us merge.

'The Bonfire of the Vanities' 
"A modern day Sod om" 

MISSY IRVING accent writer 
S 
herman McCoy fancies 
himself a Master of the 
Universe. McCoy, the 
protagonist in Tom Wolfe's 
riveting satire, "The Bonfire 
of the Vanities," takes the 
reader along on his tumul­
tuous odyssey through New 
York City--at its grandest and 
at its most pathetic. It is al­
ways intimidating. 
Although "The Bonfire of the Vanities" was first pub­lished in 1987, it has recently been released in paperback and recommends itself as a thoroughly modern, provoca­tive summer reading sugges­tion. 
McCoy is a young, ex­travagantly wealthy Wall Street bond trader. He lives with an attractive, yet so­cially preoccupied wife, Judy, and an angelic 6-year-old daughter, Campbell, who at­tends, "the best schools, with the best girls, from the best families." In addition, he en­joys a secret affair with the wily, adventurous, and gor­geous, Maria Ruskin who, as it turns out, is capable of being neither satisfied by nor loyal to a Master of the Uni­verse. Yet McCoy is seemingly a man who has everything. 
"The Masters of the Uni­verse were a set of lurid, rapacious, plastic dolls his otherwise perfect daughter liked to play with ... On Wall Street he and a few others had become precisely that-­
Masters of the Universe ... If 
you weren't making $250,000 a 
year, within five years you 
were either grossly stupid or 
grossly lazy. By age 40 you 
were making a million a 
year, or you were timid and 
incompetent." 
The first quarter of the novel is devoted to illustrat­ing McCoy's world and con­trasting it with the miserable situations of the other charac­ters. The preliminary chap­ters are the least enjoyable of the whole book, but patience for the first 150 pages is richly rewarded. 
McCoy's fortunes begin to plummet rapidly when his mistress hits and fatally in­jures a 17-year-old black boy, Henry Lamb, from the Bronx projects. McCoy is wrongly accused of a hit-and-run, and it is in this setting that Wolfe depicts the ethnic idiosyncrasies and the vanities of New York's finest and foulest. 
The most commendable aspects of the book are Wolfe's brilliant, hilariously overdrawn character sketches. The individuals who cross paths with McCoy rep­resent the stereotypes of every ethnic and economic group to be found in Wolfe's conception of the late 1980s morally decadent microcosm of New York. 
The members of the black community who rage for a mistaken justice are portrayed as dishonest, power-grabbing thugs. The Irish, Jews, and Italians who 
constitute the employees of 
the New York District Attor­
ney's Office, which seeks to 
prosecute McCoy for a crime 
he didn't commit, are 
depicted as the lusty, 
prejudiced pawns of the black 
activists. The women in 
McCoy's world, who inciden­
tally don't receive the same 
rich development Wolfe 
employs on the male charac­
ters, are either "social X­
rays, the starved to near per­
fection" wives of New York 
power brokers, or "lemon 
tarts," the young, ambitious 
second wives or nighttime 
consorts of the elite. 
Wolfe fashions a tantalizing 
portrait of a modern day 
Sodom and its culturally 
bereft inhabitants, to contrast 
with what he describes as 
McCoy's occasional longing to 
return to the chaste and 
simple Midwest. 
Nothing escapes attack by Wolfe's savage wit. The politi­cal aspirations and financial aggrandizement that could be realized by a few subtle dis­tortions and coverups of the actual facts of the case result in the district attorney's of­fice engaging in a hastily con­spired, inescapable perver­sion of legal ethics. The tabloid, "The City Light," which circulates the myth that Lamb was an honor stu­dent and the victim of a racist playboy, is run by snobbish and unscrupulous Englishmen. 
All the characters converge at McCoy's grand jury hearing to lobby for their own 


Wiskirchen's 30th Jazz Festival 
KATHY KIRIN accent writer 
N 
otre Dame tradition lives on this weekend as the 31st annual Collegiate Jazz Festival gets underway once again. This year also marks the 30th year that Father George Wiskirchen has been involved with the Festival. 
A noted campus music au­thority, Wiskirchen currently resides as associate director of bands and music. This weekend, however, Wiskir­chen's more important duties lie in his position as faculty advisor for the Collegiate Jazz Festival. 
As faculty advisor, Wiskir­chen interacts primarily with the students who are in charge of organizing and co­ordinating the weekend's 
BUZZ MC FLATIOP 
events. Together, they solve any logistical problems, and work with the Offices of Se­curity and Student Activities to ensure that everything runs smoothly as planned. 
However, Wiskirchen denies the importance of his role in the Festival, stating that he only advises and guides the student organizers when nec­essary. "My job actually means very little," he said. "The students do all the work." 
Wiskirchen's connection with the Jazz Festival began in 1960, when he was respon­sible for introducing and directing various high school bands in the Festival. Thir­teen years later, in 1973, he began recruiting and super­vising collegiate big bands and jazz groups for the an­nual event. This year will be 
his lOth as faculty advisor. 
As Wiskirchen's role in the Festival evolved throughout the years, so has the format of the Festival itself. Once a highly competitive event, the Festival now follows a non­competitive format. Several bands and ensembles are se­lected and honored for their outstanding performances, but the basic premise of the event is to "give various col­legiate jazz groups an oppor­tunity to play in a festival setting." 
One aspect of the Festival that has not changed is its reputation. The Collegiate Jazz Festival is the oldest and most prestigious of its kind, and as Wiskirchen stated, "I would be the first to agree with that."

At this point it becomes readily apparent that all are living various degrees of the same lie, that the mantle of in­tegrity and fairness in which they clothe themselves is merely a foil for the actual falsity of their existences.

For the price of $5.95, "The Bonfire of the Vanities" of­fers exactly what it seeks to.

Hershiser's streak ends ; 


Associated Press 

CINCINNATI--Orel Hershiser lost his magic and record shutout streak in his first inning of the season and later lost the game when the Cincinnati Reds beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-3 Wed­nesday night. 
Hershiser's string stayed at 59 in­nings and was stopped when Todd Benzinger hit an RBI single with two outs. The run was set up by one of Her­shiser's two throwing errors. 
Hershiser, who did not allow a run in. his final six regular-season starts last year, pitched seven innings and gave · four runs, only two of them earned, on seven hits. The Cy Young winner and World Series MVP struck out six and walked one. 
Hershiser got nicked again in the third on hard singles by Eric Davis, Benzinger and Paul O'Neill. Ron Oester opened the fourth with a double and scored when Hershiser fielded a sacrifice by pitcher Tom Browning but threw the ball past the dugout. 
Cards 3, Mets 1 

St. Louis spoiled Bob Oieda's first 
start since he nearly severed the 
middle finger of his pitching hand and 
Willie McGee drove in two runs, leading 
the Cardinals past the New York Mets 
3-1 Wednesday at New York. 

The Cardinals snapped their 11-game losing streak in Shea Stadium and right-hander Jose DeLeon broke a per­sonal nine-game skid against the Mets. 
Phillies 12, Cubs 4 
Mike Schmidt's three-run homer capped a seven-run fourth inning Wed­nesday night at Chicago, leading the Philadelphia Phillies to a 12-4 victory over the Chicago Cubs. 
Schmidt's homer off reliever Jeff Pico was his second in as many days and the 544th of his career. Ron Jones also homered for the Phillies. 
Twins 12, Yankees 2 
Wally Backman's single snapped a 
fifth-inning tie and sparked an eight­
run inning capped by Brian Harper's 
three-run homer, leading the Min­
nesota Twins past the New York 
Yankees 12-2 Wednesday night in Min­
neapolis. 

Harper had three hits and drove in 
four runs to lead a 17-hit attack. Allan 
Anderson, last year's American 
League earned-run average champion, 
allowed seven hits in seven innings to 
improve his record to 11-2 since June 
24. 

Pirates 3, Expos 0 
Doug Drabek pitched a two-hitter as the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Montreal Expos 3-0 Wednesday night at Montreal. 
Drabek, the Pirates' top winner at 15-7 last year, held the Expos to Rubie Brook's single in the first inning and a single by Andres Galarraga in the seventh. 
Padres 4, Giants 3 
Jack Clark's single keyed a three-run third inning as the San Diego Padres beat the San Francisco Giants 4-3 Wed­nesday at San Diego.

And speed is what will help the Canadiens squeak by the Flames in seven games in the finals. Coach Terry Crisp's Cal­gary squad is a very physical team, while Montreal relies on quick, smooth skaters to score goals. These skaters will stymie the slower Flames and lead the Canadiens to their 23rd Stanley Cup title.

Arizona star Elliott wins Wooden Award 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES--Sean El­liott, called the "consummate team player" by his coach at Arizona, collected a distin­guished individual honor Wed­nesday when he was named the winner of the John R. Wooden Award for 1989. 
Elliott, a 6-foot-8 senior for­ward, had finished third in the national balloting by sports writers and sportscasters last year, behind winner Danny Manning and Hersey Hawkins. 
This year, Elliott edged out such stars as Danny Ferry of Duke, who also was among the five finalists for the 1988 Wooden Award. The other finalists this year were guards Sherman Douglas of Syracuse and Charles Smith of Geor­getown and center Stacey King of Oklahoma. 
Elliott received 1,871 points in the voting, with Ferry second at 1,721, followed by King with 895, Smith with 486 and Douglas with 356. 
The winner was announced, by Wooden himself, during a luncheon at the sponsoring Los Angeles Athletic Club. 
"Wow," Elliott said, tempo­rarily groping for words. 
"It feels good; with all the great players out there, I don't think you can really name one guy. There are probably several guys out there more deserving than I am." 
But Arizona coach Lute Ol­son doesn't think so. 
"I think he's the consum­mate team player. He's at his best when his best is needed," Olson said of Elliott, who averaged 22.3 points a game this season and had 2,555 career points to replace Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then Lew Alcindor) as the Pacific­10's all-time leading career scorer. 
The guidelines for Wooden Award candidates extend beyond the athlete's ac­complishments on the court. To be eligible, a candidate must maintain at least a 2.0 scholas­tic average and "display strength and character on and off the court. "

Bayliss. "But he insisted on playing the doubles. Dave Reiter was also on medication and not up to par." 
Illness and a completely revised line-up were nothing compared to what Notre Dame faced once they reached the land of the Boilermakers. 
"We went to the outdoor courts and they sent us to the indoor place across town," said Bayliss. "When we got there, they told us to go back to the outdoor." 
The matches began and the Irish looked as if they would soundly defeat Purdue. Then the rains came and the matches had to be delayed 45 minutes before the indoor courts could be used. 
The Irish journeyed back to the indoor sites, but because of time constraints, had only five minutes to warm up on the car­peted courts. 
"It's the only time this year we've played on carpet," said Bayliss of the faster .surface. "Purdue, on the other hand, practices there, so it was a big disadvantage." 
Bayliss claimed the change directly affected at least one match, Ryan Wenger's 6-4, 3-6, 4-6 loss to Brain Ritz. Wenger was up a set and winning 2-0 in

from Walter Dolhare, Brain Kalbas, Paul Odland and John Silk to lead 4-2 entering the doubles. In spite of the makes­hift doubles roster, Bayliss was confident about Notre Dame's chances. 
Because of limited court time, Bayliss and Boilermaker coach Ed Dixon agreed to cut possible third sets to simple tie­breakers. The decision came close to costing the Irish the match.

doubles split and lost the tie­breaker. No.2 doubles also lost a close match 7-5, 7-6." 
The third doubles duo of Wenger and Odland saved the day for the Irish by winning an eight-game pro set 8-5. 
"We had no time left so we decided to play a pro set," ex­plained Bayliss. "Fortunately, our guys controlled the match from the beginning." 
Despite the difficulties, Bayliss was happy with the way his disabled team pulled together to come away with the expected victory. 
"Last year's team never would have won this meet," commented Bayliss. "It's not just that we're more talented but we have more determina­tion. We did not want to lose to Purdue." 
Bayliss also admitted that a few members of the young Boilermaker squad played "the matches of their careers" to give Notre Dame a tough challenge. However, the Irish skipper was quick to commend Notre Dame freshman John Silk, who won at sixth singles 7-6, 2-6, 6-4. 
"John hasn't played varsity often and he came off with a really big win," Bayliss said. 
The Irish now have a long layoff to rest and return to top form. They resume action April15 and 16 when they travel to St. Louis for the Midwestern Collegiate Conference tourna­ment.

Papers accuse Rose of using code-name 
Associated Press 
CINCINNATI--Pete Rose bet heavily on baseball games during the 1987 season under a code-name, two Ohio newspapers said Wednesday, citing uniden­tified sources. 
If true, the Cincinnati Reds manager could be banned from baseball for life if he bet on games in­volving his own club. 
A person referred to in an Internal Revenue Service court affidavit as. "G-1"-­whom the Plain Dealer of Cleveland and the Cincinnati Post quoted sources as saying was Rose--bet $8,000 to $16,000 a day on games during a stretch early in the 1987 season. 
Although Rose is not referred to by name in the IRS affidavit, the ne~spapers said they were told by federal sources the code name "G-1" means Rose. 
Rose declined comment on the newspaper reports. 
The Post quoted the docu­ment as saying G-1 bet an average of "$2,000 per game on four to eight games per day, approximately four days per week." 
The IRS affidavit quoted unidentified government in­formants as saying the bets were placed through Ronald Peters, 31, a Franklin, Ohio, cafe owner who was des­cribed in a Sports Illustrated story as Rose's principal bookmaker. Peters said Monday he would plead guilty to federal charges of tax evasion and cocaine dis­tribution. 
Peters declined to tell reporters whether he had any knowledge of Rose having bet on baseball games. Peters, under pres­sure of his plea agreement with federal prosecutors, is cooperating with federal in­vestigators looking into drug trafficking. 
The newspapers also re­ported the document indi­cates that Paul Janszen, a friend of Rose's, urged Peters to pay a $50,000 gam­bling debt the bookie owed Rose and Janszen. 

The Plain Dealer said U.S. District Court records show Janszen became an FBI in­formant and began wearing a wireless microphone in April 1988 and that federal agents taped at least four conversations about the debt. Janszen's lawyer, Mer­lyn Shiverdecker, declined comment on the reports. 
While Rose has denied bet­ting on baseball and using bookies, he has admitted he frequently bets at race tracks. 
U.S. attorney D. Michael Crites declined comment on the reports or whether the government is investigating Rose.

Masters take aim at Augusta 
Kite predicts softer greens will favor aggressive golfers 
Associated Press 
AUGUSTA, Ga.--"lt's a dif­
ferent course this year,'' Tom 
Kite said of the site for the 53rd 
Masters. 
The first of golf's four major annual tournaments has not been moved from the Augusta National Golf Club, but the splendid old place is just not the same, in Kite's view. 
The difference is on the greens, he said. 
"They're fast, fast as ever," Kite said. "But they're a little softer." 
And that could make a major difference in the tournament which begins today, suggested the tough little man who has come so close so often here among the azaleas and dog­wood, the wisteria and redbud that color the course built by the legendary Bobby Jones. 
"The last couple of years, the leaders have just been trying not to lose," Kite said. 
"With the greens softer, more receptive to a shot now, there's the possibility of some­body making a charge over the last nine holes, coming out of pack and winning the tourna­ment." 
The greens could be even softer if the threat of rain be­comes real. 

The forecast calls for the pos­sibility of heavy rains and thun­derstorms on Friday and again on Sunday, the day the tourna­ment is scheduled to end. 
"We could be here Monday," Masters chairman Hord Har­din said. 

-
''Ifwe are unable to complete play Friday and make the cut, we could be in trouble," Hardin said. "We'll just have to wait and see." 
So will the starting field of 85 of the world's finest players and a gallery of about 40,000. 
Kite is on the short list of players most likely to be in title contention over those last nine holes. 

So are defending title-older Sandy Lyle of Scotland, British Open champion Seve Balles­teros of Spain, a revived Greg Norman of Australia and American hopes Curtis Strange and Mark Calcavecchia. 



Delany takes over Big Ten 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO--James E. Delany, named commissioner of the Big Ten conference Wednes­day, called for fresh ideas to keep sports from overpowering the academic life of student­athletes. 
"At this unique time in col­lege athletics, all is not well," said Delany, a 41-year-old lawyer completing his lOth year as Ohio Valley Conference commissioner. 
"I think it's important to find a better balance," he said. "There's got to be a way to make sure education is first. And I don't think that's the case in all institutions today." 
Delany will take over July 1 for Wayne Duke, who is retir­ing after 18 years as commis­sioner. 

"He is a person of unques­tioned integrity, who has dem­onstrated exceptional ability," said Stanley 0. Ikenberry, president of the University of Illinois and head of the Big Ten's governing board. "We look to him to provide leader­ship not only to our conference, but to provide leadership on the national level as well." 
Delany said the problem of boosters and sports agents cor­rupting student-athletes with money is worse now than it was 10 years ago. 
"Sometimes the values of pure capitalist competition is in conflict with educational

values,!' he said. 
The pressures of big-time sports, television and national championships can be too much for some young men who enter college to play football or basketball, Delany said. 
"There has been tinkering with NCAA rules ... but in my opinion there has not been reform," said the new Big Ten commissioner, who played var­sity basketball at North Carolina and twice made it to Final Four competition.

Bolcar anchors linebackers 
Back-ups getting plenty of work during spring practice 
By MOLLY MAHONEY 
Sports Writer 
When describing a lineback­er, the word thin is probably not the first adjective to come to mind. 
In fact, most people see the intense eyes of a linebacker hovering behind the defensive line and are more prone to ascribe words like tough, pow­erful or quick to the hard-nosed players seen slashing through the offensive line to sack the quarterback or standing up running backs trying find open field. 
But in this case, it is not an individual linebacker, but the entire corps which is looking a bit emaciated lately. 
Last season, the Irish had one of the strongest linebacking trios in the nation, with fifth­year senior and "mike" linebacker Wes Pritchett leading the team in tackles. 
And on paper, with two mem­bers of that trio--Ned Bolcar and Michael Stonebreaker-­back next year, the Irish look to be a defensive force once again. 
But with the impending graduation of Pritchett and the unexpected loss of Stonebreaker from spring workouts after his Feb. 25 car accident, the linebacking ranks 
have  been  rather  thin  this  
spring.  
So  Ned  Bolcar,  who  will  

return as a fifth-year senior and one of next year's tri­captains, has borne much of the burden in guiding the young and inexperienced corps of linebackers in spring practice. 
Besides Bolcar, the only. scholarship athletes with linebacking experience are sophomore Donn Grimm and

Mike Smalls. And three walk­ons, juniors Joe Farrell, Chris Shey and freshman John Far­ren, round out the Irish linebackers. 
"I think they will be strong," defensive coordinator Barry Alvarez said of the seven players vying for a linebacking position this spring. "But right now, they're a little thin. 
"We're grateful for the three walk-ons, because without them, it would be difficult to have a good practice. They are doing a nice job, and do whatever we ask of them with­out even thinking lwice." 
Bolcar, who played both "eagle" and "mike" linebacker positions last season, has moved into the eagle slot and has been the elder statesman for the linebackers this spring. 
He finished last season ranked fourth in tackles with 57, seeing action in all 12 games, and the coaches have looked to Bolcar to exercise his captain's duties frequently this spring. 
"Ned's a good leader," said Alvarez. "His play has really improved during spring drills and it helps having a second­year captain's leadership out there to push the younger players." 
Bolcar sees his role in the same light. 
"I realize we don't have a lot of depth," said Bolcar, "so they count on me to do a good job and be a leader. 
"A linebacker has got to be the captain of the defense and keep the guys together on the field, so I try to lead by exam­ple on and off the field and hopefully help the defense to come up with big plays." 
Stonebreaker's recent clash with the law may not hinder his playing in the fall, but it is yet to be seen whether a broken kneecap and dislocated hip will keep the top candidate for next year's Butkus Award from re­turning to top form. 
Stonebreaker, a consensus All-American last season en route to finishing third in the running for the Butkus Award given to the nation's top linebacker, could leave a con­siderable void at the eagle linebacker position if he cannot fully recover. 
"Mike should be ready to play in the fall," said Alvarez. "He's ahead of schedule and healing well and the doctors are happy with his progress." 
But with Stonebreaker ab­sent from spring practices, other players, such as Grimm and Smalls, have stepped for­ward to make their presence felt. 
Smalls has helped fill the eagle linebacker spot, while Grimm's versatility has al­lowed him to play the eagle· or mike linebacker, depending upon the team's needs. 
"I think Mike Smalls is really learning the game and I'm pleased with his toughness and aggressiveness," said Alvarez. "I think he's going to be a good football player for us. 
"And I am really pleased with the progress Donn Grimm has made. He's been working very hard for us this spring." 
Both will help the Irish con­tinue using the linebacker corps on a rotating basis, such as the three-man rotation 
employed  last  year  with  
Pritchett,  Stonebreaker  and  
Rolcar.

ND fencing teams foiled in bids for national title 
By CHRIS FILLIO 
Sports Writer 
While the 1989 NCAA fencing season is now over, thoughts of what could have been will remain for some time in the minds of the Irish. 
For the men's squad, it was a fourth-place finish behind repeating national champion Columbia, while Penn State and Penn came in second and third, respectively. 
The women's team took third as the Wayne State Spartans also defended their title, with Columbia taking second place. 
Neverthless, both results were disappointing--and shocking--to say the least. 
"Obviously I am disap­pointed, more for the kids than for myself," said Irish head co­ach Michael DeCicco. "It's pos­sible that they may have let something slip through their fingers." 
For the women especially, the loss was tough to handle. While they were able to defeat eventual national champ Wayne State on two different occasions this year, the breaks simply did not go in their favor. 
In the loss to Columbia, which decided the right to fence WSU for first place, the Irish suffered a key setback when a simultaneous touch was called against them. As a result, they tied Columbia in bouts but lost in overall touches. Wayne State went on to dispose of Columbia in the final. winninl! its second straight national champion­ship. 
"Everything seemed to be going as planned," said DeCic­co, "until we lost that simulta­neous touch to Columbia." 
Senior captain Janice Hynes placed sixth overall in individ­ual standings, earning second­team All-America honors. Senior Kristin Kralicek took lOth, while freshman Heidi Piper was 13th in her first year of collegiate action. Senior Brenda Leiser and sophomore Lynn Kadri also competed for the Irish in the team competi­tion. 
DeCicco commented on the need for a gold-medal con­tender to pace the women's team. Four-time All-American Molly Sullivan propelled the Irish to the national title two years ago in her junior year. 

"Next year we'll still have the nucleus of a very good team," noted DeCicco, "but we'll have to develop the caliber of gold-medal performers necessary to lead the team." 
The women will look to Kris­tin Kralicek next year, as she has made tentative plans to ap­ply for her final year of eligibility. In addition, fresh­man phenom Piper will return following a successful rookie season. 
In men's foil, senior Yehuda Kovacs took seventh and gar­nered All-America honorable mention. Junior Derek Holeman was 30th in his first year at the NCAA tournament. 
"I feel bad for Yehuda be­cause the gold medal was one of the few goals he had left to accomplish," said DeCicco. "Following his first lost bout, he struggled and couldn't return from that initial set­back. Unfortunately, the Penn State fencer who won the gold is someone that Yehuda has beaten several times in the past." 
Sophomore sabreman Les­zek Nowosielski placed fifth overall, making him a second­team All-American. Classmate Dave Kirby finished 17th, just missing the final round of 16 by a single touch. Both fencers had strong showings over the season and will undoubtedly continue to be a potent force next year. 
In the epee competition, team captain Ted Fay was 12th while Niles, Mich., native Todd Griffee took 18th. The Irish will have a tough time next year in their efforts to replace the two senior epeeists. 
"I'm very hopeful with some of the recruits we have coming in for next year,_" said DeCicco. 
While both WSU and Columbia graduate only a few seniors and retain several strong individuals, the Irish have the makings of a solid al­beit young team with in­credible potential. 
Right now they may be but a step away from that champion­ship season. 

The Notre Dame fencing teams had disappointing be just a step away from returning to the top of the NCAA tournament appearances this season, but may collegiate ranks.
