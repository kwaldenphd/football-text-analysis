Soviets take sexist stand 
MOSCOW <AP) -The head of America's biggest women's rights group says the Soviet Union has a sexist attitude, that Soviet authorities tried to censor one of her speeches and 
that  the  country  is  "a  horrible  
place  absolutely  fright·  
ening."  

Karen DeCrow, president of the 60,000-member National Or­ganization for Women, said Tuesday: "Equality is not part of their ideology. In their heads, women are different.· There is a sexist attitude to women here." 
The 37-year-old president of NOW was here for an inter­national conference. A lawyer and writer from Syracuse, N.Y., Ms. DeCrow, who prefers that designation, said she formed her opinions by obser­vation and discussion with So-

Hilaire Thomas and Terry Tuohy will vie for SMC freshman class president in a run-off election this friday, according to election chairman Kathy Carrigan.

Carrigan reported that 57 per viets in a two-week stay in the country. 
Soviet insistence that the pri­mary job of women is to bear children, the official assertion that women aren't physically able to work at some jobs and the failure of many Soviet men to help with housework and child raising, all contributed to

Law Council emphasizes practical skills

The Law Advisory Council discussed ways the Notre Dame Law School could increase orientation toward the practice of law at their September meeting. 
David Link, hean of the Law School. said. "We got good suggestions on how to get across the aeademic nH'ssage while still giving some practical skills oriPntation." The men related t•xpPriPnces they had encountered in their own practices, he added.

InPIRG to release price study 
By Jim Winters Staff Heporter 
Confused Notre Dame students unable to choose among competing banks and rival grocery stores will soon have help. 
Comparative studies of both checking account services and grocery store prices in the South Bend area will be released within a week by InPIRG, the Indiana Public Interest Research Group. 
InPIRG volunteers from Notre Dame and SL Mary's studied the checking account policies of seven banks and compared prices in over 
40  grocery  stores  throughout  
October.  
The  bank  survey  has  been  

completed and will be released l<'riday. 
(;roccry price information is still l,eing tabulated and will be rl'leased Parly next week. Both studil's will be included in a con· sunwr handbook which InPIRG hopes to publish next semester. 
Tom Martiny. director of the l'he{·king account survey, said the !'ost of accounts in every bank surveyl'd rose betwt>en 10 and 25 cents within the past year. 
Three banks · First National of Mishawaka, National Bank and Trust and Valley Bank and Trust ­have begun offering to students "thrifty" or "special" accounts. These accounts require no minimum balance or monthly service charge, and can be con­siderably cheaper than regular accounts. But Martiny says no area bank offers a really "free" account. 
"If they don't get you through service charges," says Martiny, "they'll get you through $2.75 charges for every 25 checks."

Members include Indiana Senator Birch Bayh, and Jefferson l<'ordham. former Dean of Penn State's Law School. Thomas Ford, a partner in the New York law firm of Sherman and Sterling, serves as the council chairman. The remainder of the members are attorneys from across the countrv. 
Link said the law school will use the council's ' suggestions when developing new programs. 
The law school is currently dt•veloping two new programs. 
The first program, entitled "Problem Methods in a Client Environment" will attempt to improve the student's skills in legal writing, interviewing, and nPgotiating. Link said, "We will try to show students that the 
availability of student loans is included in the survey. 
Gemma Graham and Steve Jehl of Notre Dame and Lena Rose of St. Mary's aided Martiny in compiling the data. 
The grocery · price study was completed yesterday, and the information gathered is being deciphered by a computer and analyzed by a task force headed by 
Pat  Burke.  The  Observer  will  
publish the survey 's results  next  
wt-ek.  

lnPIRG is also investigating the art-a's utility companies.

Princeton lab director speaks 
The director of the largest fusion energy laboratory in the United States will lecture on "The Problems and Promises of Fusion Ent-rgy" at Notre Dame, Monday October 20. 
Dr. Melvin B. Gottlieb, director of the Plasma Physics Laboratory at Princeton University, will speak at 8pm in the labrary auditorium. 
Gottlieb was one of the founders and the first chairman of the Plasma Physics Division of the American Physical Society. Since 1954, he has been associated with Princeton, where he also is professor in the Department of Astrophysical Sciences. 
A member of Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi, he was educated at the University of Chicago and is theauthorof articles on cosmic-ray and plasma physics. 
The lecture, sponsored by the Notre Dame Chapter of Sigma Xi, an organization for the couragement of scientific research, is open to the public without charge. 
problems they will be handling are not abstract problems but people problems." 
The Law Advisory Council will also help the law school in putting together a Masters Program. 
The Law School's computer ~:enter favorably impressed the council. Link said. "Stanford and Michigan are the only other schools to do significant ex­perimentation with computers," he added. 
"The Notre Dame Law School has pioneered the use of computers in legal systems. We did the first sophisticated simulation of a legal system ever, as a joint project with the Engineering School," Link said. · 
Link believes the computer's greatest contribution to law will be in the study of legal systems. 
"The legal profession has never really done an in depth study of its The computer is used mainly as system. But the computer allows a research tool now, Link added. for simulation of the legal system The computer provides for an so that experiments can be made interactive system of research within the system and it can be rather than a hierarchical system improved.

the nightbefore emil 
T'was the night before Emil And all through the dorm The freshmen had heeded What upperclassmen had warned 
They studied their Chern To the fullest extent Then all went to bed And were fully content 
The very next morning The freshmen arose They looked at the quiz And everyone froze 
After the quiz They gave a great sigh Then looked up at Emil And all wondered why 
All during class As Emil was teaching All the poor freshmen Were wailing and weeping 
At the end of the class Emil T. did speak "StudY, your Chern, And I II see you next week!"

eharacteristics of swing and modern jazz, Latin, classical, and contemporary, as wl'll as all forms of rock. This can be seen in the fact that no two of Chicago's albums are alike. Chicago Transit Authority was basically a basic rock album with brass and Latin overtones; Chicago II got into much more brass and jazz, and even some dassical. The third, fifth, and eighth recordings took all these forms and ex­panded them in different directions; and the seventh had definite Latin, modern jazz, and electronic influence. 
Chicago's band members aren't your run-of-the-mill New York Dolls-typed musicians, either. Each have studied at such places as DePaul, Quincy, and Hoosevelt Universities and the Chicago Conservatory College, each compiling various instrumental and compositional dpgrees. All have had experience with symphony orchestras and brass, wood­wind, and jazz ensembles. And, as result, all have won many high individual music

~the first time' the stars euer did it 
IIOLL\'WOOI> BABYLON By Kemwth Anger Stntight t\nmw Books, $14.!15, 2!12 pp. 
One of the early chapters in this fribble of a book describes the debauchery and subsequent demise of Fatty Arbuckle, the plumber-tumed-actor whose comedy career was destroyed by the sordid death of a young would-be starlet. The tabloids, Angl'r notes. "had a field day." 
So does Anger. Like those same tabloids that Ill' so sactimoniously condemns, "Hollywood Babylon" has all the depth and subtlety of the Yellow Pages. It reads likl' "Tht• Best of the Daily News, 1920­1!170," complete with purple prose and lurid pictures. Even his title, which suggests a deeper level than can be found ht•re. is really a newspaperman's 
''I('HScr. ,, 
"Hollywood Babylon" is an episodic chronicle of human waste--from the suicide of 20-year-old actress Olive Thomas in 1920 to the 1969 murder of Sharon Tate--and after awhile it all gets rather monotonous. 
The book has been highly praised by the excitable avant-garde left (Anger is a ''I rue visionary," says one), but decadent American writing about decadent Americans is, in the final analysis, the n•dul'tio ad absm·dum of so-called Post­Modernism. 
This book, unfortunately, is not even very good pornography. ••••J.B. 
TilE FIRST TIMF; By Karl Fleming and Anne Taylor 
Simon and Schuster, $7.95, 319 pp. 
If your first sexual experience was rotten, this book will make you feel better. 
If  your  first  sexual  experience  was  
terrific,  this book  will  make  you  feel  
better.  

In the first case, it will be comforting to know that some of the most famous people 111 the world--including so-called "sexy" starlets--had miserable first times. In the second case, it will be pleasing to know that your first time measured up to some famous first times. 
i\s Karl !<'leming put it in an interview with this reviewer, "These experiences arc so universal they will make people feel not so alone. There is somebody in the book for everyone to make some sort of connection With." 
The authors interviewed 28 celebrities, mostly movie people and writers, about their first brushes with sex, their ehildhoods and all the factors that shaped their sexual and professional attitudes. Although many of the accounts are shockingly graphic (most notably those of Hudy Vallee and Liberace ), they are never obscene. It is obvious that each person thought carefully and told the truth, no 
~natter how painful or embarrassing it was. 
Many felt crushing guilt at the smallest demonstration of sexual awareness during childhood or adolescence. And the majority never heard anything close to a realistic explanation of sex from their 
frank Iaurino awards, including high rankings on many Hownbt><lt polls. 
Trombonist James Pankow is one of the finest in the music world today. <He once played with the Ted Weems Orchestra.) Walter Parazaider (woodwinds) can pick up anything that half-way resembles a flute or saxophone and expertly play it like very few can. Terry Kath has to be one of the most underrated guitarists around, despite the fact that his electric and acoustic work is quite outstanding. Equally outstanding (and equally un­derrated l is the bass playing of Peter Cet­era. who is only now being ranked among the top in his field. Keyboard man Robert Lamm is very competent on piano, electric piano and organ, and has recently in­eorporated synthesizer and mellotron into his work. Danny Seraphine is regarded as one of the top jazz-rock drummers today; and Lt•e Loughnane does a number on trumpet and flugelhorn, too. 
The newest fact in Chicago is Laudir 
parents. <(Loretta Lynn said her father told her he found her under a tin can). I>Pspite these repressive parental at­titudes, however, only four of the 28 were virgins on their wedding night. One lost his virginity at the age of six. 
Some highlights: 
Jack Lemmon: "The first time I had an affair I was in a parked car in a parking lot 111 Harvard Square... Physically it was such an impossibility; you had to be an acrobat.. .Jesus Christ, it was not at all to~ching. I didn't feel guilty, just disap­pomted." 
Loretta Lynn: "I couldn't figure out what was happening and he didn't tell me 
so I just lay there."  '  
.Debbie  Reynolds:  "Have  you  ever  
k1s~ed  br~ces?  Well'  I  was  really  not  

thnlled w1th my first kiss. I thought 'If that's what it's all about I don't need ~nyof this.' " '

Joan Hivers: "Physically, it was nothing. You read in the books, 'She took to it like an animal.' I just said. 'Hunh is it over?' The whole thing lasted abdut a minute and a half, including buying the dress." 
Artie Shaw: "I just thought, 'Well, it's 
over. Thank Christ I did it...Now I can get on about my business and my life.' I drove her home and never saw her again." 
Of course, not everyone had a bad first time: Grace Slick: "The first time.. .is always Pxcellent." Mae West: "I felt right doing it, and after the first couple of times, it felt good."

which later voted to recom­mend Nixon's impeachment. A Watergate grand jury also named Nixon as an unindicted co-conspirator. 
Tucked between blue card­board covers, the 277-page final report contained no surprises and few previously unknown facts about the scandals which led to creation of the office 28 months ago. Nor were there suggestions for major in­
stitutional reform. 
"I have tried to make it plain for 10 months now that it would not be an evidentiary report," Special Prosecutor Henry S. Ruth Jr. said in an interview timed to coincide with the re­port's release. 
He was asked if the pardon granted Nixon on Sept. 8, 1974, would justify the release of White House documents and tapes of further wrongdoing.
