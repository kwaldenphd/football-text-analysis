McKenna relates plans for 
statement 
Dear Students, 

today's Trustees meeting 
The Board of Trustees of the University of Notre Dame will meet today in the Center for Continuing Education. As most of you know, Student Government has submitted seven proposals to the Trustees. The proposals include student representation on the Board, a statement of investments, and access to University financial records. 
These are requests, not demands; but they are important requests. I ask you all to show your support for these proposals by assembling in front of the Center for Continuing Education at 3 p.m. If you disagree with the proposals -be there to say so. I will appear before the Trustees at 2:30 to present the proposals. I will announce the results at 3:00. We have been asking for reasonable t~ings for a long time. We are asking again. We plan no vwlence, and we ask you to be non-violent. The proposals will be hollow without your support. 
. I ask y~u to come today to show your support and unity m a non-vtolent manner. We must begin today to show our concern for the University in a non-violent and rational manner. 
Sincerely yours, Phil McKenna

"It was a good dialogue ses­sion hut I'm afraid it didn't accomplish much," said Student body Presidcnl Phil McKenna. "We seem to he talking on two different levels at all times. The administration couldn't compre­hend our feelings." 
Vice President Fred Dedrick described the meeting as a "gen­eral discussion to let the admini­stration know how the students feel." 
"Nothing was decided 
Wednesday," said Student Union President Dennis Clark, "but at least now the administration is aware of our frustrations and the fact that Notre Dame students are growing in concern and in­
volvement." 
Commenting on these frustra­tions Dedrick said, "the Univer­sity's financial situation is a roadblock to any type of pro­gram we initiate -from Black Studies down to Experimental College." 
"Every time we ask for money we get the same answer," he asked. 
Another area of concern is the lack of student representation and the lack of respect for stu­dent proposals.

Seabrooks rejects all labels 
hy Mark Walbran "One interview with me will dispel any ideas of 'window dressing,' placation, or 'toke­nism' either on the part of Notre Dame's administration or con­nected.with the personal motives of this counselor for all people." So states George Seabrooks, the University's new black coun­selor in the Freshman Year Office. The interview left no doubts. Seabrooks feels Notre Dame hired him because the University is seeking skilled black profes­sionals to help solve society's problems of apathy and racism. These can only be solved with the understanding of the ideals and motives of the blacks. "I view myself,'' Seabrooks said, "as a black professional to whom Notre Dame has invested a contract, a contract to assist in searching out and identifying solutions which will prove bene­ficial for the school and the community, I suppose Notre Dame feels as though I might be such a person." 
After completing his under­graduate work at Wilberforce University in Ohio, Seabrooks 

George Seabrooks earned a Masters degree at Wayne State University in De­troit. Presently he is a candidate for a Ph.D. in guidance and counseling. 
Seabrooks spent two years teaching and counseling disad­vantaged children in the inner cities in New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Detroit under "de facto" conditions. 
More recently Seabrooks has counseled disadvantaged stu­

bodies preparing for the mora­torium. He said all theology undergraduates had signed a let­ter in support of the mora­torium, which may be published in the National Catholic Repor­ter and the New York Times. 
He also said similar move­ments were taking place in the English and history departments at Notre Dame. 
He also announced a list of speakers who will appear during the week prior to the morator­ium. New York Senator Charles Goodell, who recently called for a complete American troop pull­out in Vietnam by December of 
1970, will speak October I 0 at 3 
p.m. in the Stepan Center. 
Archbishop John Robinson, author of "llonest to God," will be on campus Sunday through the Wednesday moratorium date and on Tuesday night prior to the moratorium, pacifist David Dellinger, one of the Chicago Eight currently on trial, will speak. 
Some of the activities already planned for the Wednesday in­clude a teach-in by the theology majors, continuous showings of the anti-war film, "How I Won the War," and a rally and a Mass. 
Mcinerney also said prayer meetings will be held in several churches in and around South Bend including a complete read­ing of the war dead on the steps of the county courthouse in South Bend. 
Also announced were prelim­inary plans for the two-day November moratorium including a national movement in Washin­gton. Peace demonstrators will march single file from Arlington Cemetery to the White House in Washington, D.C., each person bearing the name of one war 
dead,  and  all  names  will  be  
deposited  in  a  large  coffin  in  
front of the White House.

Out of the ninety-two girls present at the meeting, nine voted for class officers, fifty­seven voted for the class council, and twenty-one voted for the "no structure" plan. 
As the council form was adop­ted, Karen stressed that it would be a distinctive body from those established previously. With it the Junior Class President plans to accomplish any set goals as would have been realized under the "no structure" government. 
Because McCandless houses the majority of the Juniors, Ruthie Lyons, its president, will sit in on the council in order that the hall and class govern­ments may help each other out. In two weeks the council should be formalized so as to begin making plans for the class' activi­ties.

"No matter what you doves do October 15, you won't affect me!" 

Rick L.ibowitz 
Dim, dark days 
Item: Notre Dame opens new experimental dormitory and "Halfway House," September, 1967. 
I went through Holy Cross Hall the other day. In the two years I had lived there, it was a dorm marked by constant change. Now, with an off-campus address, I was back to take a look at the latest evolutions. 
Fr. Joe Hoffman was the rector that first year. It was an old high school seminary, complete with gym, being opened to the college students for the first time. The rooms were large, the halls wood-panelled and carpetted, compensations for the students living so far from the rest of campus. On the ground floor, there was a rec room with three resurfaced pool tables, as well as a restaurant and coffee shop, open seven days a week. But it takes more than nice rooms and a restaurant to build a dorm community, it takes people, active people. Michael Patrick O'Connor lived in Holy Cross that first year, as did Lou MacKenzie and Lou Pelosi. Ed Roickle and "Groovy Brucie" Carter were on the hall football team.. .it was that kind of a place, with that kind of people. 
After a hall government had been formed, parietal hours were soon passed and put into operation. The University quickly put pressure on Fr. Hoffman to abolish the rules (a flaunting of University regulations in those dim, dark days); he refused, merely requesting that the hall suspend them. Throughout the first year, the hall's residents continued to act as if students had the rights of 
. human beings. Girls were a common sight in the halls and the hypocritical feeling of sneaking your date to your room, so common to the rest of the campus, was gone. The Administration was upset at this unexpected turn of events and "steps were taken." The next year, Fr. Hoffman was gone; in his place came Fr. Joseph Miller, a middle-aged parish priest from New Orleans, whose rapport with students quickly showed itself to be nil. When we returned that second September, the pool tables were gone,the "beach" on St. Mary's Lake was off-limits for swimming and an attempt was being made to seal off several of the hall's numerous entrances. The restaurant, which had employed dozens of students the previous year, was closed. The Anastasio brothers, who had managed the place that first year, had left when the University upped its financial demands to approximately 40% uf the gross. It remained closed, until several students took over its management in late autumn, opening on weekends only. By semester break, a large number of the hall's residents were gone, to Sorin, to Walsh and Off-campus apartments. More planned to go at the end of the year. This week, the room that had once held the pool tables was empty, a large padlock on the door to keep students out. The corridors were filled with new faces, to whom the old days are unknown. Fr. Miller is still there-with a few others, many of whom are openly contemptuous of him. 
They say that next year Holy Cross will be converted into a co-ed experimental dorm. You have to wonder if, once again the University will be frightened off by its own success, panic and ruin 
another good idea.

Butkus, meat work help Curl 
Ron Curl makes no bones about it-Illinois and Chicago Bear linebacker Dick Butkus is his favorite athlete. 
"lie knows what it is to be

Is Ron Curl mean? There has 
to he some reason why the 6-0, 
240-pound Michigan State tackle' 
from Chicago has come so far so 
fast. 
In spring of 196S, Curl was j ust anot her name on the Spartans' spring roster-a highly regarded newcomer to be sure hut still a frl·shman who spent th~ entire spring sidelined by a bad left ankle. 
A year later, however, Curl was the Spartans' only returning starter at defensive tackle.

regular, Rick Benedict, and had finished the season as the front wall's second leading tackler with 19 solos and 25 assists. He also finished second on the team in tackles for lost yardage with eight for 61, minus 61 for opponents, and his line coach Henry Bullough, offers a reaso~ for the rags-to-riches transformation. 
"Curl is an exceptionally hard worker who loves the game of football," Bullough explains. "He'll do anything to become a better player." 
Anything includes his summer 
job. A product of Chicago's 
tough South Side, the 
20-year-old junior spends his 
surnn!ers as a meat lul~ger on the truckmg docks of a Chicago meat packer, carrying quarter beeves that scale around 200 pounds apiece. Meat lugging may not to be the usual summer employment

for a college football player, but then nothing would be too unusual for this determined athlete. Curl enjoys being a starter. It hurt him a great deal when he had to sit out that first spring in East Lansing, and that's a feeling he'll not soon forget. 
"Athletics mean everything to me," Curl says. "It means what I like to do best--play. I can't stand to just watch. I'd quit first." 
As a prep in Chicago, Curl attended De LaSalle High School where he put together an impressive athletic record. Despite the fine game he had as a starter in the Spartans' big 21-17 upset over Notre Dame last October, Ron still counts a high school game as his biggest sports thrill. 
"I picked up a fumble in our game with St. Catherine and went HS yards for a touchdown," Curl recalls. "There were only 56 seconds left in the first half, and it put us ahead, 21-14." 
Base b a II is the physical education major's other big love. A two-lime all-league pick in high school, Ron has coached a Little League team and played softball for the team which has won the Windy City CYO title the past three years. 
A high school All-American selection in football his senior year, Ron was a highly sought college prospect who says he picked Michigan State because "they weren't phoney; they told 
me the truth." 
With a brilliant sophomore season now behind him, bigger things seem to be around the corner for the hustling kid from Chicago. 
"Curl improved a great deal as a sophomore," Bullough says. "With his great quickness and added size, we expect even more from him as a junior."
