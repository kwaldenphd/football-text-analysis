Faculty wants tenure guarantee 1n merger 
by Steve Lazar Reactions against the Park Mayhew Report, a proposal to insure current tenure arrange­ments, the ammending of the Faculty Manual, and the com­plete merger of Notre Dame and St. Mary's are among five resolu­tions that were released yester­day by a subcommittee of the Faculty Senate. The resolut~ons, which ar:e to be voted on at next Tuesday's Faculty Senate meeting, were released to the Observer by 


chairman of the Senate sub­committee that drew up the resolutions. 
Manier, stressing the impor­tance of an informed and active debate of the issues by the faculty's representatives, emphasized that it was necessary for the faculty to read and dis­cuss the proposals prior to Tuesday's meeting. 
The five resolutions, listed here in a slightly different order than the way they were re-I leased, are as follows: 
I) The Faculty Senate of the Notre Dame

Wednesday night when the Stanford Deviates, Keenan Raggers, 
and the B-P Nads gathered to help the Naked Kahuna reveal 
the 'naked' truth. Naked claimed through the campaign that 
he would reveal all the issues. All there can attest that they 
were exposed to the issues. However a few questions caught 
Naked with his pants down. When asked what would happen if 
he won Naked offered all at the rally a position in student 
government. The rally broke up after the seventh shower when

recommends to the Board of Trustees of the University of 
Notre Dame that any plan provi­ding for a closer association of St. Mary's College and the Uni­versity of Notre Dame should include guarantees for the pre­servation of tenure arrangements for all current faculty members of each of the two schools. We further recommend that a joint committee of the Notre Dame Faculty Senate and the St. Mary's College Faculty Assem­bly be created to formulate mutually acceptable tenure arrangements and report back to their parent bodies. 
2) The Faculty Senate of the University of Notre Dame rejects the proposition that a viable college or university curriculum can be "primarily designed" for men or for women, and strongly recommends against accepting a 
college so structured as a separ­ate and distinctive entity within the larger University framework. 
3) The Faculty Senate of the University of Notre Dame rejects the proposition that the Univer­sity needs the humanizing influence of a second Liberal Arts College operating as a separate and distinctive entity within the larger University framework, if its curriculum would simply duplicate fractions of the curricula of the current Colleges of Arts and Letters and of Science. 
4) The Faculty Senate recom­mends the complete incorpora­tion of St. Mary's College into the UniversitJI of Notre Dame; this should not entail a distinct St. Mary's College of Liberal Arts in the University of Notre Dame. 
S) The Faculty Senate of the University of Notre Dame· authorizes the Chairman of the Faculty Senate to appoint a committee to formulate appro­priate amendments to the Facul­ty Manual and to suhmit these to the Faculty for its ratifica­tion. This committee may con­sult with representatives of the Faculty of St. Mary's College and with representatives of the student body of the University of Notre Dame and that of St. Mary's College. 
Rationale. Some recent admin­istrative initiatives in the areas covered by the University of Notre Dame Faculty Manual have not followed the guidelines set forth by that manual. 
Any modification of the Uni­versity structure as significant as the incorporation of a distinct college and large numbers of new faculty members will place new and unforseen burdens on the Manual. In particular, the faculty Senate cannot accept the proposition that a new office of Vice President in the University of Notre Dame can be created and filled before the Faculty Manual is amended to recognize ~uch an office.

The sophomores also reviewed the recent administrative re­organization, which included the appointment of a vice-president for student affairs (a newly­created post) and creation of a Freshman Year Office to cope with counselling a large fresh­man class. 
"Our concern rests with the means used to attain the ends," the letter stated. "Saint Mary's College has for past years en­joyed a system of participatory government which we proudly called community government in which students, faculty, and administration shared their views and concerns." "These latest actions by the ad­ministration have dealt the concept of community govern­ment a serious, if not mortal blow," the letter continues. "The actions were taken without any discussion or knowledge of Community Government, in­cluding the Student Policy Committee and Educational Policy Committee of Board of Trustees, and the Student Affairs Council and Academic Affairs Council of St. Mary's College."

Concluding the letter, the sophomores suggest that the parents question not only statements made by ad­ministration and the faculty, but also the ones that the class asserts. The letter urges parents to discuss these issues openly with their daughters. 
In writing the letter, the class consulted with a member of faculty members and ad­ministrators to verify their in­formation.

by Ann Therese Darin In the only action bv any student government at St. Mary's on recent changes in the ad­ministrative or financial policies, the Sophomore Class has drafted a letter to be sent to their parents. The letter, endorsed by 62 per cent of the class, questions the tuition hike, the resignation of the dean of students, and the ethics in the creation of an office for the vice-president of student affairs and a freshman year office. "I am very excited about the overwhelming response of the class," stated Sue Welte, sophomore class president. "It 
proved that dass government as well as th~ class in general can be and is involved in matters that concern us all as a community." 
In the letter, the sophomores question the $75 per semester tuition boost which reportedly would generate an additional $250,000 for the college. The class contends that the Board of Trustees authorized the increase for faculty salaries. Only 100 faculty m~mbers, however, whose average salary was $11,000 received an average raise of 5 per cent. they alleged. 
Since this would account for only $55,000 of the revenue ob­tained from the tuition increase,

Sr. Alma replies to AAUP action 
by Jan Walton 
Sr. Alma's reply to the cen­sure of her recent actions by St. Mary'S chapter of the AAUP was read at last night's meeting of St. Mary's ~udent Assembly. 
Writing from Rome to Sr. Franzita Kane, president of the AA UP . chapter, and the other administrators addressed in the r.~ensure, Sr. Alma stated her displeasure that the statement of censure was published in The Observer instead of being sent directly to her in Rome. 
She pointed out that two mis­understandings were made in the censure. The Director of St11rlfmt Aid and the Director of Housing have not been eliminated, said the acting president of St. Mary's, but have been lowered to the third level of the admini­their present $1500 budget to enable them to bring more speakers to campus, in con­junction with Notre Dame's Corrnrission, which still will bear more than it's five-sixths of the financial burden with a $19,000 budget.

FOUNDED NOVEMBER 3,1966 NOTRE DAME,INDIANA 
From the E-ditor's Desk 
To the Parents 
Today marks the start of the nineteenth annual Junior-Parents weekend and the 
Observer wishes to extend a cordial welcome to those parents who were able to 
come down. 

Despite the criticism and complaints about Notre Dame most will agree that this place has chanted a lot since we juniors first set eyes on it back in the fall of 1968. 
When we first arrived women were allowed in the rooms only on football Saturdays and then for a few hours. Security guards prowled the campus on Friday and Saturday evenings looking for students carrying beer on campus. Student rights under the judicial code were in their infancy and the Student Life Council was just beginning. 
Most important of all, there were virtually no women in classrooms. The co-exchange program had just started with one shuttle bus going between the two campuses and the ACC opened for use for the first time. 
Forced doubles were in vogue that year and Flanner and Grace were unfinished hulks. Second semester seniors were the only on campus students allowed to have cars, and all on campus students were required to sign in once every twenty-four hours. 
St. Mary's girls are now found in dormitory rooms every day of the week. 
Coeducation looks to be just around the corner, pending the outcome of the joint 
Trustees' meeting in March. 

It won't be the instant panacea that some expect it to be, and it won't be here over night but as it does come it can't help but make this a better place to live. 
Students, some of them at least, walk around the campus openly with beer and on weekends kegs are common in most halls. Other students have turned from beer are into different things, as evidenced by the drug raid last semester. 
The Student Life Council, after a brilliant start, has slowed down and seems to be in the midst of an identity crisis. It did pass a new judicial code, but as shown in the case of the two students suspended for being accused of drug possession, is far from perfect. 
Co-exchange is in full gear but most of the girls are in Arts and Letters classes. There are two shuttles now and a third was recently added during the busiest hours of the class day. 
The bigger concerts and all the basketball and hockey games are put on in the Convocation Center. Other activiites go on there also, some oriented towards the people in South Bend. Student groups would like to use it more, but complain that the minimum $1000 rental is being too high. 
Forced doubles have gone the way of sign ins with the opening of the new towers, 
but there is room shortage facing the University as it continues to admit more 
freshmen each year. 

Car privileges were recently extended to Sophomores, but the University claims a parking space shortage. The mood and tempo of the campus seems more relaxed than when we first came here but there are still problems. A lot of students turn to alcohol on the weekends and the results are shown in the shattered windows and damaged walls found in the dorms Monday morning. 
Minority students feel that the University is not putting enough time, money, and effort into recruiting and scholarships, while the University points to a shortage of funds. 
Notre Dame has a long way to go both academically and socially. Change has and will come. How fast and how far it will go depends on the students and faculty and administration. They can make this place the truly Christian University it deserves to be.

While he was at dinner in the house, it happened that a number of t:.1x collectors and sinners came to sit at the table with Jesus and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your master eat with the tax collectors and sinners?" When he heard this he replied, "It is not the healthy who need the doctor, but the sick. Go and learn the meaning of the words: What I want is mercy, not sacrifice. And indeed I did not come to call the virtuous, but sinners." Matthew 9:10. 
I heard a story once about a guy in Lyons that stayed in his single room all day and all night, never studying, never talking to those around him,leaving his room only for lunch and dinner and trips to the bathroom, never going to class. He finally went insane and left the university. I know other people at Notre Dame, students, faculty, administrators, that are alcoholics. There are others, unable to face the complexilty of life, that have turned to drugs. Some of these people sell drugs, as a way of affirming their identity, a way of making money and holding power over people by having drugs that others want to buy. 
We all have problems; some of us have problems that are so severe that the inner turmoil manifests itself in forms of self-destruction. This is not abstract rhetoric, for we all know persons that need our love; our compassion, our friendship and understanding, to obtain the strength to leave the path of self-destruction. All of _us need 'this love and compassion to be happy, others need it so badly that drugs, alcohol, power, and exploitation are used as replacements, as signs that point to a great personal need. The core of our worth as human beings lies i111 our individual ability to respond to the personal suffering that is all around us, and within ourselves. All the people that live and work at Notre Dame are collectively, and individually, responsible for the well-being of every person within the community. 
Father Burtchaell is well aware of this, for as a New Testament scholar and as a practicing Christian, he must know that Jesus had a special compassio-n for men and women that had turned to evil as a way of conft·onting life's complexities. That seems to be the point of the Mary Magdalene story, for example. Jesus did not report Mary Magdalene to the authorities, he did not defame her before the self­righteous, he did not place her outside the community as too corrupted to be saved. The whole spirit of Jesus' teaching, if I remember what Father Burtchaell taught me in Bibilical theology Freshman year, is that love, forgiveness, and compassion can never be replaced by law, authority, judgement, and punishment. By placing a person outside the community we are losing nope:, giving up on faith, sinning against the humanity of the person that is confronting us. Did Jesus command the police to storm into Mary Magdalene's bedroom, did he call for her damnation because of whoring? Of course not. Jesus responded with love and compassion for a woman that was crying out for love and compassion, and because Jesus responded to her needs, she believed in his goodness. 
It is self-evident that many people respond to the harshness and 
inhumanity of existence at Notre Dame by turning to drugs, alcohol, 
exploitive sexuality, and false pride. We !re. all guilty; we are all lost; 
we are all responsible; we are all needful of each other's ability to love 
and care and forgive and heal each other. 
Some of the people on The Observer myselfincluded; have been very harsh to Father Burtchaell and Father Riehle. We have judged and condemned in response to judgements that we perceive to be wrong. I apologize for that.lack of humanenessand I hope that respect has-not 
been completely destroyed. 
But the probl~m that I have been talking around remains. It appears 
that Father Burtchaell has decided that Misters Hannahan, Badger, 
and Brennan are guilty of wrongdoing that exceeds our powers of love, 
compassion, and forgiveness. They are judged to be "imminent 
<'angers to the community;" sinners that cannot be forgiven; persons 
that must be expelled from the community and handed over to the civil 
judges for punishment. Is this a Jesus-like response? 
·Father, eould you explain to the community, in the form of a letter 
to this newspaper, how suspending Mark Hannahan, Donald Badger, 
and Timothy Brennan is fulfilling our mandate to act with forgiveness, 
love and compassion?

LOVE AND DAVE BECK 
If you're going to say anything about tove Story you had better be quick about it, because everybody is getting his licks in and soon it will all be said. It seems that we have reached the point where it is becoming extremely stylish to be highly critical of Erich Segal's novel and film, almost as though it would be corny at this point to say anything nice about something so many people have said nice things about. It seems to be an application of the old rule: "Anybody who has made that much money on a book and a movie deserves to be blasted." 
l was in an interesting discussion the other night, and we got to talking about the gospel according to Segal; and, in particular, the now famous line from the book and movie, "love means never having to say you're sorry." There were num­erous insightful comments about that line, many people interpreting it one way or another, some agreeing with the thesis, some disagreeing. When l first read the line in the book it bothered me a bit, but I didn't stop over it -kept right on reading. But when it came up in the movie and I reacted to it similarly, I began to reflect on it. I think the thing that bothers me is that it suggests (this may be the fault of the reader or the viewer) -it seems to suggest a universal principle: "Love means never having to say your're sorry". But love doesn't, always, in every circumstance, mean that. 
Perhaps it's the problem of failing to see the difference between love is and love means . In other words. there'~ a great difference between what love is-its basic definition and, on the other hand, what this basic definition means in all the ramifications, manifestations, and imple­mentations that are necessary because of unique and special circumstances. In short, you just can't capsulize the impli­cations of love in twenty-five words or less. 
According to the gospel, love is the thinking, the willing, and the doing of good to another person. The highest form of this love is the love of God, agape. If there is any love of God in your life or my life, it's not so much that we love him, but that he loves us. If we consent to the love of God, we then have his love -we have agape -in our lives. This then begins a sequence, a chain reaction. Once we have the love of God in our lives, this love must expand; it must extend itself through us. Love is diffusive of itself, which means that we must, in turn, love others. This is why love of 
neighbor becomes so crucial for the Chris­tian person. If l refuse to love one who is my brother or sister, I have really refused to allow the love of God in my life to express itself thnmgh me in my relation­ships with others. 
And, amazingly enough, when I allow this chain reaction to happen I discover that, at the end, in loving my fellow man l do, in fact, love God. The impossible has become possible. It is, we would have to assert, absolutely impossible to love God in the sense of love being the thinking, willing, and doing of good to another person. You and l can't do anything for God; he has no need of anything from us; he is not in any way insufficient or inadequate. But because God has become man, he has so united him,elf with all mankind, as Jesus himself said, that whatever we do to another man we do it, in fact, to him. Because God became man, the love of man is now theological; it is, in fact, in the fullest sense of the word, loving God. This is the marvel of the Christian life. And this is why the fulfuillment of the second com mandment, "love your neighbor as your­self," is in fact the only definitive way we know we are fulfilling the first command­ment -to love God with all our heart, mind, soul . and strength. 
Once we have established what love is, then because of all the circumstances challenging us, what love means will tak~ on multiple dimensions. It can mean at one time giving a drink of water to a child . at three o'clock in the morning. Love can mean smiling and saying "good morning." Love can mean to shut up and let another person talk for a change -a person who very desperately needs to share deep thoughts and feelings with a friend. 
There is a craze on the west coast right now, about to sweep the country. It is the water bed. In its most typical dimen­sions, the water bed is approximately two hundred gallons of water encased in a high-test plastic bag, about seven feet long, six feet across, one foot high. The water bed perfectly contours the frame of the human body; it is absolute perfect comfort. Well, love is like that. Love has to be like that. It has to contour the frame of the unique and special needs of a person. It has to respond to the special contours of needs that each of us has. 
Love means a lot to me, because I see so much of it every week. I see so much of . it every day; and some days are specially 
filled with love's dimensions. For exam­ple, a couple of weeks ago, I went to Dayton, Ohio to attend the funeral of David Beck. David, as you know, was the · sophomore Notre Dame student who died following an accident after the UCLA game. I saw all kinds of manifestations of love on that occasion. I found out what 
love means. Love means -well, it means a mother and father who are torn with pain over the death of their oldest son who can only think of being gracious and kind and sensitive to the needs of others, wonderfully hospitable to the relatives and friends who were with them on that occasion. Love means -well, love means the grandmother of David Beck, herself dying of caner, yet the most outgoing, energetic, least self-pitying per­son in the crowd, And love means three carloads of Notre Dame students, who got up at four-thirty in the morning that Wednesday and drove through! the bliz­zard of northern Indiana to be with their 
friend David. 
The song is right: "What the world needs now is love, sweet love; that's the only thing that there's just too little of." But it seems there's more to it than that. Although there is indeed a great lack of love, such a tremendous need for more love in this world, there are also -if we look at the total peicure-fantastic de­monstrations and manifestations of love around us all the time. We ought to see this. We ought to rejoice in it, thank God for it...recognize him in it. For, after all, love is his name. 
I guess it's for all these reasons that I 
was particularly moved the other day 
when l received a letter from David 
Beck's mother. She had an unique and 
unusual (truly beautiful) request. Many 
Masses had been offered for David; and

however, they wanted a special Mass

Freshman winger Ian Williams and veteran center John Noble, both playing on the first line, continue to anchor the Irish scoring attack with 36 and 33 points respectively. Williams has 14 goals while Paul Regan, with a hat trick on Saturday, and freshman Eddie Bumbacco both have 12 goals. 
Injuries, however, may force Smith to alter his lines in the remaining games. John Roselli (groin) Noble (bruised kidney) and Jim Cordes (hip pointer) were all under par against Mich­igan. 
The Irish will be facing a red-hot Falcon team that has posted 11 straight victories while compiling an overall 16-11 record. Bowling Green gained 64 and 7-3 victories at Ohio University last weekend to win the Mideastern Collegiate Hoc­key Association title with a 7-1 record. 
The Falcons have not dropped a game since a 6-2 sethack at second ranked Boston University a month ago. Among the Falcon victories was a 7 4 home success over high ranking Clarkson. Centers Gerry Bradbury and freshman Mike Bartley led the scoring parade with 46 and 3 2 points respectively while winger Pet Badour has 31 points. Bart­ley has 19 goals.

Voices from the Crowd 
Sports Editor: 
Anyone associated with the Notre Dame Club Basket ball League is certainly aware of an organization named the Cape Cod-Toledo-Kankakee Club. The CCTKKK (as it is known to its members) IS another one of the fine examples of the very loosely defined term "dub." 
Upon asking one of its mem­bers the reason for the unusua! title, . he answered that these were the home cities of the members; not all the members, but three who happen to be from Cape Cod, Toledo, and Kankakee, respectively. 
The member replied that it was actually a bunch of guys from B-P who have parties and stuff together. 
But. with regards to basket­ball, the CCTKKK is actually known as The North Quad All­Stars. Four of their starting five were all-league selections in lnterhall Basketball, namely Fritz Hoefer and Bill Schmidt of B-P and Bob Bingle and Clark Keller of Stanford. 
As of now, the CCTKKK is leading the league and appears a good bet to lake the Club Title. Reportedly, they will then issue a challenge to Pangborn for Campus Basketball Champion­ship. 
So what the CCTKKK boils down to is an amassed bunch of jocks united into a learn with fancy uniforms, and large thirsts. This is a "club."

Notre Dame, Ind.--The 40th annual Knute Rockne memorial breakfast will be Sunday, March 28, in the University of Notre Dame's North dining hall. Mass at 8:30 a.m. in the Stanford­Keenan Chapel on the campus will be followed by the breakfast at 9:30. 
Principal speaker at this year's event, held annually on the Sunday closest to the date of Rockne's death on March 31, 1931, in a Kansas plane crash, will be Tom Pagna, offensive backfield coach of the Notre Dame footbaH squad. In great demand as a speaker at athletic events, Pagna combines humor and football lore in his presen­tations. 
Pagna was a spectacular halfback under Irish Coach Ara Parseghian at Miami of Ohio, twice winning little All-American and all-Ohio honors. He played professimnal football with the Green Bay Packers and Cleveland Browns before joining Parseghian's staff at Nor­thwestern University in 1959 and making the switch to Notre Dame in 1964.

The Irish dropped a 94-88 fouled out. Dee is hopeful that scoring 25 apiece.

It wasn't the end of the world, however. Coach Johnny Dee was decision to Fordham in Madison injuries to Meehan (knee) and crouched in front of his team as they Silt leaning back against their lockers, most with their heads bowed and some with a little moisture in their eyes. In his baritone voice he concluded his post-game message by saying, "Shake if off. We can get back at them in Houston." 
Austin Carr, the team captain, stood up and walked to each man on the team individually to get them "up" again. He grabbed Jack Meehan and whispered something in his ear. The dazed Meehan wasn't smiling but he had stopped frowning. Austin merely clipped Collis Jones on the head and Collis forgot about the poor shooting night he had had. It went on this way with each teammate. You knew then that this was not a team that would stay down. This was a team that believed its coach. They would get back. 
It's nearly three months later now and during these three months there were times when it looked as though neither the Gamecocks nor the Irish would ever meet again this season...at least not in Houston.  
After both teams have absorbed some tough defeats it still appears that they can face each other again, but it won't be easy. The Gamecocks must endure that ridiculous Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament before they get on the road to Houston. The Irish, well, all they have to do is finish the season without another loss.

II . . Munchkins and Demons! 
t 
~ 
Saturday at midnight seems to me to be tp.e most perilous hour of the week for the munchkins tripping in the Land of Oz at this University. If horror hosts a plot to tangle living flesh with speeding steel on Notre Dame A venue, then death is most apt to come as a midnight rider, and a weekend rider, at that. If violence flares up with a twist of knife among bones that live, it most often seems to be at the hour when only the twelfth stroke of the clock separates a seventh-day evening from the first instant of a Lord's day morning. If somewhere in a turned-on crowd, a mind dances the arabesques of terror to the off-beat tunes of a psychedelic ballet, it will most probably be as a ritual in a witchesi sabbath wheri midnight hags ride their broomsticks of fear across the skies arching the soul, until the Sunday holi­ness begins with daybreak. 
On a recent Saturday evening, when my imagination was wide awake with images as Gothic as those of any opening para­graph I have ever written, a friend named Rich approached me with introductions to a boy waiting outside my office door. Rich said of the boy, "He's bumming," by which I understood him at first to mean that the lad was a hobo, down on his luck, wandering from a somewhere town to the neighborhoods of no place to go. Then I understood the boy was a traveller only in the mind; his trip was on 
drugs, and all of the vibrations were bad. For the next several hours, R1"ch and I and Jim McDermott, a worker in the 
Drug Information' Center whom I sum­moned from tl1e fourth floor of Keenan, 
offered the boy the therapy of conversa­tion, in an attempt to talk him down distrust the young man who spoke with me; hopefully, he will go home, and with a ho-hum of disdain, he will burn his notes. But in the event that he doesn't, I thought to myself, my attitudes as rector are too important at least to me, to rely for their reporting on a vety young man starting out in student journalism. Thus, this column. 
Of drugs themselves, let me say there is nothing I fear more unless it be the death of God, or my own damnation. Some­times I wonder if damnation itself is not a bad trip to infinite depths, to where the soul is locked-in on itself to experience the eternal horror of its own being, emptied, by choice, of love and conse­quently creatured with loathsome and slimey things that crawl up from the night swamps of the doomed imagination. Last year, after endlessly rapping with hall residents on the tedious subject of 
parietals, 1 rather suddenly became aware of the escalation in drug use on the premises of my beloved Keenan, and 1 felt towards the parietal discussions like a dog to whom a meat bone has been tossed by a burglar making off with the family silver. I remember also, last year, zoning in on a kid, who seemed to cxemplify, in his weight Joss and in his saffron complexion, the deterioration that is, traditionally the "dope fiend's" lot. Ultimatums were leveled against the kid: stop! or phone calls will be made to 
Papa, and you can settle the problem together in the suburbs west of Chicago. 
But the kid would not promise to stop;he could not lie to me, he said. He chose instead to leave the hall, and his friends came as intermediaries. They said: there

caline. (The boy's supplier, thinking the mescaline to have gone stale, gave his protege in drugs a double dose of the 
crud. The reactions were so severe that the boy supposed he was freakiJ,g out on L.S.D.) Eventually, I learned hat two other students were undergoing a similar distress, as partners in the same sale of mescaline, in another hall on campus. They finally appeared at Keenan, where friends gave them comfort and shelter for the rest of the night.

It was an extraordinarily miserable day on the campus of du Lac when Nobody decided to stroll over to the student government offices and pick up a petition for SBP. The idea to run for office was never conceived and didn't mean anything anyway, as it was received with absolutely no acclaim or censure. The Observer made no mention of Nobody's candidacy and the Scholastic followed suit. He had no machine to help him win and nobody supported anybody, that is, everybody supported Nobody. He ran a campaign in which signs were placed in every hall on campus proclaiming that "Nobody will speak in the student lounge this evening at six thirty. No one is invited to attend and nothing will be said. No questions will be answered afterward. Please don't come." On election eve there was no excitement at Nobody's non-existent campaign headquarters and, as might be assumed, the well-informed powerless to touch his son's inner will. In the end 1 had to work out other terms with the boy; it seemed in no way desirable to dismiss him to an off-campus room, where he could stone himself into 
madness. My situation was like that of another 
dad 1 have heard about: he commanded a child of his flesh named David, "Get a haircut, or get lost." David, feeling that a father's love should be based on contin­gencies more basic than a hair-style, opted to leave home. In tears, the father apologized to his son, shocked at his own near-deed of throwing away a child for a 
but I refuse to let it alienate me from a kid who, at that point, may be most in need of my friendship. 
My attitude toward this boy is illustra­tive of my feelings toward all the mem­bers of the Keenan enclave. Obviously, one cannot condone the use of drugs, since, among other things, there are federal laws curtailing the operations of even such free spirits as the Rector of Keenan. Of drug use, I am not, nor do I

intend to be, penmss1ve; I hate the practice with a passion more intense than even my love for God, or so it seems when I compare the intensity of my prayers with the revulsion I feel at the thought of L.S.D. But drugs are a prob­lem too serious to he treated only as an upset to disciplinary schemes. In the sub-culture of today's youth, attitudes have developed that were undreamed of in my own formation as an adult human being. As a chaplain, 1talk regularly with students who approach life with a dif­ferent frame of reference, a different set of values, a different structure of premises, than my own; and if I have to deal with drug-users, I must do so in'such a way that they will not carry their practice underground, where I will hear about a kid's drug-induced dilemma only after he has arrived at the state of being a 
mindless vegetable. 

There are two kinds of campus facilities I will try to impose, when needed, on a drug user: ( 1) the Student Drug Informa­tion Center, founded by Tom Tollaksen after a germinal suggestion from me; and 
(2) Psychological Services -and the sug­gestion is made not for the boy's punish­ment, but for his healing. If discipline is imposed, it must be as personally tailored, and as therapeutic, as apenance given after sin. 
In my own experience, I have never seim a drug-user with his inner mess-tips whom I have considered a source of contagion to his classmates. Even with the shabby chaps who sell drugs, I am tempted to deal gently. (Note the differ­ence between a supplier, who claims to provide a marketplace for customers who wish his merchandise, and a pusher, who 
tries, I am told, to get his clients hooked into a drug dependency. I have never consciously met a pusher; I am on speak­ing terms with several who are suppliers.) Speculatively, I can imagine the supplier as a creep with all the earmarks of a moral monster; in practice the suppliers I have met seem like regular chaps, though screwed up in some of their personal judgments and usually a little paranoid. None of them seemed sinister, and all of them seemed worth saving, whatever the word salvation may imply. 
In writing of my feelings about students who are using drugs, I speak of myself as a fallible creature who has tried to temper the wind to the shorn lamb in order to keep that lamb from perishing. If I had done otherwise, I think to myself, fright­ened freshmen would not come banging on my door at midnight, and Saturday evenings would not be times when. once in a while, I feel much needed, because the Demons of mischief are conspiring against the peace, happiness, and survival of the children in the land of the munchkins.

Notre Dame graduate Rick Libowitz on the Hebrew University Campus. 

Graduate in Israel 
Jerusalem, February, 1971: "I want to become a rabbi because of the idea of doing things with and for people," says 22 year old Rick Lobowitz who this year is studying at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and plans to return to the United States where he is enrolled in a 
Rabbinical School. 
Rick, son of Mr. and Mrs. Milton Libowitz of 3 Rocky Rapids Road, Stamford, Connecticut, has a long record of work in both politics and civil rights. He worked towards voters' rights in the South and helped in election campaigns for Robert Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy. 
After completing a B.A. degree in English at the University of Notre Dame Rick came to Israel in July and spent two months learning Hebrew at a course of the Teachers Training College at Sede Boker, a kibbutz (collective agricultrual settlement) in the Negev desert whose members include Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion. 
He then spent a week touring Israel hefore ooming to Jerusalem where, in addition to studying at the Hebrew University, he is also enrolled at the Hayim Greenberg Teachers Seminary. His programme includes Bible, Talmud, Jewish History, Jewish Thought and Sociolagy, but he is most concerned with learning Hebrew. 
By studying at the Hebrew University, Rick says he is following a cousin, Dr. Lewis Kaplan, former head of the Baltimore Teachers' College, who, in 1925, was the first American to study at the University which was founded on Mt. Scopus in I 918. Access to this site, cut off in 1948, was regained in 1967 and last year the entire Law Faculty and all first year science students were transferred th_ere. There were only a handful of overseas students at the University in Dr. Kaplan's student days. This year almost one quarter of the University's 16,000 students are from abroad, an increase of 400'Jf. since the Six-Day-War in 1967. 
As a result of the strikes on the United States campuses, when Rick started studying at the Hebrew University, it was the first time he had been to rt:gular classes for seven months. He commented on how good it was to see full classes again. He dinds the classes enjoyable and likes to see so many people from different countries congregated. He adds, "where else can you lay outside in the grass in November?" 
Rick sees Israel as a "mixture of 
things." He feels it is difficult at first to 
get used to a different style of life yet his 
is already changing. "If my mother saw 
me eating tomatoes and egg-plants, I 
would not get the same treatment at 
home again," he comment'>. He likes the 
way people in Israel have "good, concrete 
goals" which they try to accomplish. 
In the future, Rick would perhaps 
consider returning to live in Israel but for 
the present his plans are already made. 
Next year, he will begin studying to 
J_ 

become a rabbi at a Reconstructionist R:.~bbinical College. In any case he has to return for a while, "I've spent four years trying to change things in the 1Jnited States, and working with similarly oriented people, and that is too long to <urn my back on it all, he concludes. 

Nobody Wins 
electorate of this University was quick to elect him by a landslide margin over every other candidate who did!l't run-you see, Nobody wag the only name on the ballot. No victory party was held and so, in gracious manner, absolutely Nobody won the election for student body president -par for the course at Notre Dame. 
The after effects were remarkable. No congratulations were in order for the victor so he quickly set to no work at all. First, he abolished any semblance of student government and replaced the whole "blasted mess" (in his own memorable words) with a Department of Everybody, in order that he might avoid double negatives-he was an English major. Thus, when Nobody was doing anything, at least it could be said that Everybody was doing nothing. The trivial wordplay which ensued was too marvelous for this author to relate. 

At the first football game, Nobody presented the flag to Mr. and Mrs. Edmund Stepan -but they unflinchingly played their parts, walked empty-handl J over to the flagpole, and raised absolutely nothing to the top of the pole whilst the band played on. No concerts were held since Nobody bried to arrange them-and most students were relieved at this turn of events following the fiascoes of 70-71. In fact, a whole year was spent with nothing happening in student government. Yet, somehow the year was no different from any other year at Notre Dame. And when the new election time came around, Nobody supported anybody who didn't run, and people began to realize the tmth of the childish, high school game at Notre Dame in,accurately referred to as student government. And the suct:ession of Nobodies pertetuated itself-Everybody saw t0 that.

Junior parents comment on student life 
(Continued from Page 1) 
at ND was not depicted on the film. The parents in the audience were then asked for questions. One father wanted to know what student life should be like. Mooney answered that it should be as diverse as possible and that there still may be too many Irish catholics on campus. 
He also said the social aspect of the university must be much looser and that co-ed dining halls and dorms should be pushed. 
Corso answered a query on the cause of the damage of weekends by stating that there is not enough to do on campus. He put the blame on the students for the vandalism. 
Mooney said that it is not the fault of any one group, students or administration, but just the way things are presently set up. 
A parent commented that twenty years ago students at ND had the same weekends to put up with, "yet there was not all this drinking and vandalism." In

For they are the exemplification of the total oneness of life experience. From the seeker of truth and the prince of wisdom. To the scholar and the doctor. To the fisherman and the farmer. The People of India are the soul of India. 
reply Meyers pointed to the fact that ·"ours is a more affluent society, the students today expect more." Mooney added that an all-male university is no longer conventional, and that with coeducation the vandalism would stop. 
Corso said that co-education wouldn't help all that much because some students would still drink too much but going co-ed would help,-even if it would rtot solve the problem.

Choice: Mooney, Barkett? Final endorsements given 

Eileen Fitzpatrick and the Student Government Coeduca­tion Coordinating Committee, in 
separate announcements yester­day, declared their support for Off-Campus Senator Don Mooney in his race for the Student Body Presidency. 
Also, in a letter to Grace Tower residents, Hall President Frank Musica endorsed Hall Presidents' Council Chairman John Barkett in his bid for the post in today's run-off. 
In their endorsement, Miss Fitzpatrick and her running­mate, Walt Secada, said that they '"recognize in Don Mooney and Dan Sherry the embodi­ment of most of the ideas we stood for." 
They also said, however, that "we have strong personal convictions, yet wonder what right we have to speak for the people who supported us. We 
Notre Dame team analyzes Ford's Pinto 
by Tim Burke According to the report issued by the Notre Dame research team the potential purchaser of Ford Motor Company's Pinto "X" tends to be sports-oriented, liberal, optimistic and an innovator." Ford's new subcompact has been the subject of a complete· marketing report, recently com­piled by the Notre Dame research team. The 200-page report, which was finished in February, has been sent in to Ford Motor Company and the College Marketing Corporation, sponsors of the project. Notre Dame was one of 160 universities throughout the nation selected to participate in the contest. Ford is offering sixteen regional grants of $1,000 each, and a national prize of $5,000, to those schools that most effectively analyze their target market, and the marketing strategy of the Pinto. The winning schools will be an­nounced on April I. The Notre Dame research team was comprised of a faculty advisor, Dr. David L. Appel, and six Notre Dame seniors majoring in marketing. Those students are: Bob Fries, John Hafel, Eric Korth, Bob McCarthy, Kevin Moore, and Ken Strottman. The project was begun last October as a special course designed solely around the Pinto contest. Notr-e Dame received, as did each participating school, a fully-insured Pinto for six weeks and $250 to cover expenses. According to Bob McCarthy, their goal was "to identify the potential Pinto purchaser at the ND-SMC community, analyze his or her car demands, and present Ford with a complete marketing report." However, McCarthy pointed out that the Notre Dame report was not designed to represent the average American College; instead "it should give Ford a realistic picture of the medium­sized private university in the United States today." The ND team divided their research into three major pro­blem areas, and investigated each through the use of a question­naire-a master questionnaire, a test-drive questionnaire, and a

promotional questionnaire. 
Four hundred Notre Dame students and one hundred St. Mary's students were selected at random to receive the master questionnaire. The research team received 400 replies, while it needed only 385 replies to make an accurate analysis. 
The questions were designed to ·identify the potential Pinto buyer, reveal his primary pur­chase motivations, and suggest the most -effective ways of communicating with him. They analyzed the socio-economic, demographic, and psychological aspects of potential buyers. 
From those respondents who indicated that they were inter­ested in buying a car in the next 12 months, the researchers selected approximately 40 people to test-drive the Pinto. Each driver answered the test­drive questionnaire while taking the Pinto on a IS-minute cruise around the campus. 
"We wanted to see if it is worthwhile for Ford to push test-driving as a promotional device," explained McCarthy. The team compared the initial opinions of the drivers with those that they had "after finishing their drive. McCarthy said that most people were "much more impressed with the car after driving it." 
A Pinto advertisement, designed and donated by Ford Motors, was placed in the Observer last fall. A month later, the researchers placed an adver­tisement of their own design, 
uniquely  tailored  to  the  
ND-SMC community.  
The  promotional  question­ 

naire was used to compare the effects of both ads. A telephone survey was conducted to test student recall and awareness of the advertisements. One hundred students were contacted follow­ing each of the ads; however, the difference in response between the two ads was "insignificant." 
Also included in this survey were questions pertaining to student awareness to the various media. In a survey of 184 people conducted by the reesearch

Musica said in his letter to the Tower residents "when I return, I would like to see a different Notre Dame, I feel that if John is elected, Notre Dame Student Government will be more than just a play ground. Now is your opportunity. Give Student Government a chance.· I strongly urge you to vote for John Barkett and Orlando Rodriguez tomorrow." 
Musica also spoke of a "disap­pointment" on his part this year. As one of the causes of this he mentioned "a failure on the part of Student Government. It seems that every time things go wrong . . . they blame the structure instead of themselves."

For forms of government let fools contest, Whate'er is best administer'd is best.

FOUNDED NOVEMBER 3,1966 NOTRE DAME,INDIANA 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
John Barkett 
Today's runoff election for the Student Body Presidency is probably the Single most important day in student government's existence since J. Richard Rossi won the first rights of student self-government from the University. For the first time since Rossi, we have a candidate who is committed to a series of positive and realistic goals, articulated before and argued throughout the campaign. That candidate is John Barkett, and we strongly urge his election as student Body President. 
John Barkett is more than a fine administrator. He is a man with a record of getting things done. His 2-year record in Morrisey speaks for itself; it is one of the best-run and most socially active halls on campus. Likewise, the Hall President's Council under his administration as chairman set up a leadership conferance which helped other Presidents in their halls. It has also established definite conclusions about the rector-hall relationship, and in general has behaved in a far more active manner than it ever has before. 
Barkett is informed, direct, and honest. He'll bother some administrators who are used to limiting student power by being better aware of the University's operation than student power's elected representatives, but he will represent the students, and represent them well. The way he'll represent them will not be with the empty rhetoric of confrontation, but with solid and inevitable reason. 
When we write of honesty, we do not mean the trivial tests of honesty that have cropped up in the campaign. 3oth candidates pass that test. 
The honesty we refer to is John Barkett's honest acceptance of the fact that student government can address itself to important problems effecting the students. This is where he differs from his opponent, and this is where he best shines. The programs John Barkett espouses are ones we can realistically expect to get next year. Barkett espouses them because he believes we can get them. 
We can get the thing Barkett has pledged to get. The long-overdue "money back to the halls" project Barkett has endorsed can be accomplished without a raise in the activities fee. The Barkett minority program, written by' Orlando Rodriguez, the Krashna Administration Human Mfairs Commissioner and easily their most knowledgeable man on Minority Affairs, is a logically sound one and one that won't be hindered by the University. Barkett's plan to create a Student-Faculty Advisory Board for Security is eminently workable and would only help a deteriorating situation. 
Probably the most important aspect of Barkett's campaign is his approach to coeducation. He recognizes both its economic necessity and its inevitability, and the suggestions he has made to antitipate coeducations are both commendable and helpful. 
Particularly important are his suggestions to adjust the placement bureau for the admission of women, to appoint a co-ordinator, to recruit female professors and female administrators, and to provide gynecological services in the infirmiry. 
The merger of Notre Dame's student government with that of St. Mary's will be consumated regardless of who wins this election. Kathy Barlow has said this several times before her own election. We are confident that she will find it as easy to merge with a student government led by John Barkett as with one led.by Don Mooney. 
Mr. Mooney's campaign continues to be a dissapointment. In an effort to "get specific" Mr. Mooney has written a list of programs; some of them of the promise-the-world variety ("open air concerts with good inexpensive groups") some already suggested by John Barkett (such as the Junior Year at Home Program) some of them vague ("revitalization of the Social Commission.") and some of them impossible to obtain, no matter how much confrontation is used (such as putting approval of the rector in the hands of the hall members.) Mr. Mooney has run an honest and fair inquiry into the affairs of the campus, but he has found no answers. Mr. Barkett has.  
It is for all these reasons, then, and for the reasons expressed in last Wednesday's Observer that we endorse the Student Body Presidential Bid of John Barkett.

Unsolicited Appreciation 
All "good" things must come to an end sooner or late.r, and so, it 
is with another year at Notre Dame. We feel that the year is over for 
all practical purposes since the Krashna administration is out and the 
general yearly turnover of personnel is about to begin. 
Since we don't want any of the efforts of campus personalities to 
go unappreciated we would like to say thanks to various people, and 
present some awards to illustuous campus dignitaries who in our 
humble opinion have helped make this last year one of the great 
years in recent campus history.
