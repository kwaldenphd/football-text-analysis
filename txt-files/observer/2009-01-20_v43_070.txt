INSIDE COLUMN 

Carpe Oban1a 
Did you hear the news'? Therp,'s a small event going on in Washington, 
D.C. today. It may or may not concern the politics of the free world. It might involve one of the greatest new politi­cal minds of our century. And it could, 
just maybe, per­ 
tain to Y-0-U, that  
single American  Analise Lipari  
citizen sitting in  
the dining hall. If you have been  Scene Editor  
anywhere near a  
television, news­ 

paper, radio, or even that one kid down the hall who's been reading pas­sages from "The Audacity of Hope" to you since freshman year, you've prob­ably heard the news: Today, my friends, is Inauguration Day. By the time you're reading this paper. Barack Hussein Obama will have officially been inaugurated as the 44th presi­dent of the United States of America. 
Winning the presidency, we might gather from the length and expense of this past race, is no small feat. You need both your plans and your exPcu­tion to work in tandem without miss­ing a beat of the national pulse. You need to build lasting connections with politicians and ordinary citizens across this country, a massive task even in its geographic scope. You need to research. to investigate, to under­stand and to grapple. You practically need an army. Heck, if you manage to get the job, you will need an army. 
On January 20. 2009, we've offered Barack Obama the chance to take that job. 
In a time of economic collapse and international tension, our democratic process, however long and toiling that proc-ess may be, has chosen this man to take his seat in the Oval Office. Maybe it was a feeling of trust. or confidence, or belief in his beliefs and his vision. Or maybe it was all threfl. But no matter what led us to the polling booth, and no matter whose box we checked for whose chad we punched), today. we're celebrating a beginning. 
On a side note, I wonder if my kids will ask me about the dav Obama became the President. (Note: In this scenario, I have extremely thoughtful and politically aware children.) If or when they do, I'm not sure what I'll say. I could tell them the details of the ceremony, or quote a memorable part of his inaugural speech. 
But will I be able to express the feel­ing'? The excitement and the anticipa­tion, blended together with some sense of hope in this crazy world? We'll have to wait and see. 
I hope you watched the Inauguration this morning. You may have class, work or something else that would normally be a legitimate use of your time. But I hope you set aside whatev­er commitments you may have had to watch at least part of what happened today. 
Because you -yes, you -are wit­nessing something extraordinary. It's rare that we get the opportunity to grab hold of history with our own two hands. Don't let ~t pass you by.

CLC considers creation of a task force, host of other issues 
Student body president Bob Reish offers suggestions on alcohol policy, sexual assault, how to clarify off campus rules 
By SARAH MERVOSH 
News Writer 
The Campus Ufe Cow1cil (CLC) prepared for the new semester by discussing their ideas and the need for creating a new ta..'>k force at their first meeting of the semes­ter Monday. 
Student body president Bob Heish proposed three key issues that the committee might consider thi'> semester. 
Heish first discussed the idea of implementing a Good Samaritan Policy protecting intoxicated stu­dents from getting in trouble if they are helping someone who is hurt or sick from drinking. 
"A lot of other colleges are insti­tuting this policy in the past couple of years. I think Saint Mary's did last [semesterl which his some­thing to consider," said Reish. 
He also proposed an investiga­tion and assessment of the University's sexual assault policy. 
"Student government has received reactions to current practices, [and] a large percent of them have been negative," he said. "People feeling like they can't 
explain their story and they don't 
feel like they are treated fairly." 
CLC is aware that the Gender 
Issues committee of Student 
Government has already looked 
into the sexual assault policy and 
discussed whether it would be 
more effective to work with 
Student Government or to do 
something separately. 
Reish also said he wanted CLC 
to look at the role of off-campus 
students and off-campus life. 
Unda Cirillo, Lewis Hall's rector, 
specifically wants to look at how 
off-campus students express 
themselves to the University and 
how the University looks at off­
campus students. 

There is currently an off-cam­
pus senator on the Student Senate and there is an off-campus coun­cil, but Reish said the off-campus representation is not proportion­. ate to the number of students liv­
ing off-campus. 

Additionally, Heish proposed 
creating a set of rules for off-cam­
pus life that would determine the 
consequences of having an off­
campus party. DuLac states that all DuLac rules apply to off-cam­pus students, but Student Government has received com­plaints that there has not been precedence for punishment in cer­tain situations, said Reish. 
Student Body Vice President Grant Schmidt said the Good Samaritan Policy, the sexual assault policy and off-campus life are all issues that are "very sub­jective and you can't have hard concrete facts, [like l if you do x then you will get this dollar fine." 
Schmidt suggested that instead of specific rules, CLC should look at informing students so they know what the posf)ible conse­quences are for actions so that they aren't caught by surprise. 
Student Union Board Manager Meg MacCaughey suggested cre­ating a new task force that focuses on otT-campus life, but no defini­tive decision was reached. Each task force will meet to discuss the relevance of the three suggested issues and report back at the next meeting.

Harsh -winter -weather causes pipe to burst 
By LIZ HARTER St. Mary's Editor 
Anyone working in or walking through the Main Building last Friday were in for an unpleasant surprise as a fire sprinkler water line pipe fell victim to the sub-zero temperatures outside. 
The -45 degree wind chill took its toll on a pipe on the ground floor, which froze and subse­quently burst around 5 p.m. Friday. 
"Water gushed from the pipe causing damage to the ceiling and soaking the carpet," said University spokesman and assis­tant vice president for news and information Dennis Brown. 
Brown said workers were able to cap the pipe and fix the fire sprinkler system by Friday night, but there is still a hole in the ceiling, which needs to be repaired. 
The area around the break will be examined by the utilities department this week to try to figure out how the cold air is getting into the building, Brown said. The University does not have a cost estimate of how

much damage was done, but Brown said it was minimal. 
However, this is not the first time the cold weather took its toll on the pipes around campus. Water flooded the third floor of the Hesburgh Library to the basement after a pipe burst in Feb. 2007. That incident result­ed in the library closing for six hours and damaged approxi­mately 1,500 books on the sec­ond floor aecording to Observer archives.

ND reflects on end of term 
By AMANDA GRAY News Writer 
Most eyes in the nation will be on President-elect Barack Obama as he is sworn into office at noon today, but there are many who are using the inauguration as a chance to reflect on the pres­idency of the man who Will be former President George 
W. Bush by 1 p.m. 
Junior Edward Yap, presi­dent of the Notre Dame College Hepublicans is doing just that. 
"President Bush served his country with honor and integrity," Yap said. "While his decisions were not always pleasing to all people, or myself, he made them with the best interest of the coun­try ~t heart and with princi­ple. 
Josh Kaplan, the associate director of undergraduate studies in political science, is also looking back on Bush's presidency a11d said he saw potential in Bush that he did­n't fulfill. 
"Bush had a positive and far-reaching vision for the future of the Republican 
party," he said, "but was unable to move the party very far in that direction." 
Ilowever, that doesn't nec­essarily mean that Bush was unsuccessful in his presiden­cy, according to Christina Wolbrecht, an associate pro­fessor of political science at the University. 
"Success and failure are political judgment calls," she said. "It all depends on what you attribute to the President." 
Yap, however, thinks there are many things that can be considered a success in the past eight years. 
"President Bush's President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPfAH) has poured $18 billion .into Africa in an effort to increase the number of Africans on anti­retroviral drugs from just 50,000 [people] at the end of the Clinton presidency to 1.3 million as of 2007," Yap said. 
That doesn't mean that Bush's tenure was without fault, though, he said. 
''I'm still torn as to whether the war [in Iraq) was justified according to my understand­ing of a just war," he said. · 
Kaplan said he thinks 

Bush's form of politics can still be beneficial after he's gone. 
"His vision of 'compassion­ate conservatism' was gen­uine and thoughtful." he said. "The party could still learn from it." 
Wolbrecht said Bush's tenure in office will most likely be associated with "a shift of the place of the United States in the world," but it is still unclear what he will be remembered for. 
"We don't know yet what he'll be remembered for," said Wolbrecht. "Depends on what you focus on." 
Kaplan said he believes that the Iraqi War might have an impact on how Bush's presideney is remem­bered. 
"If Iraq becomes a more stable. country in the near future, his decisions will be judged more favorably," Kaplan said. "If not, history will judge him harshly for it, because he committed the United States to an open­ended involvement in Iraq with no end in sight."

This is not her first time wit­nessing the transitien of power. Lowry and her parents came to the inaugurations in 2000 and 1996. 
"I think this one is definitely a lot more exciting, because I was able to vote in this elec­tion, so I had a sav in it," she said. "And I campaigned for Barack Obama." 
Lowry plans to wake up early, before 7 a.m., to walk over to her ticketed section. 

"I am really excited to see all the people that are sup­posed to he coming out for this, and to see how packed the mall \Viii be," she said. "Just to see the millions of common Americans that will be there." 
Notre Dame sophomore Ja&mine Williams will not need a hotel room or couch during her time in Washington. Along with about 50 others from Notre Dame, many of them members of the Africana club, Williams left campus at about 4 p.m. to drive through the night to get to the inauguration. 
"It's a huge opportunity to see history, something that's never happened before," she said. "It'll be cool to tell my grandkids these things." 
Most members of the club do not have tickets to the inaugu­ration', so they plan to line the parade route instead. 

Notre Dame senior Mallory Laurel had a ticket to the inauguration but did not arrive in Washington in time to pick it up. On Monday, long lines formed outside tlw House and Senate office buildings with people waiting to pick up tickets for inauguration. Laurel left Notre Dame on a bus organized by engineering professor Leo McWilliams shortly after 5 p.m. Monday, expecting to a1·rive at 6:30 
a.m. Tuesday. Laurel, who spoke to The Observer by phone, said she had not yet decided whether she would try to stand in the non-ticketed area of the National Mall to hear Ohama's inauguration speech, or whether she would try to stake out a position along the parade route. 
Laurel decided to make the trip -spending two consecu­tive nights on a bus -becausP she thinks the inauguration will be a once-in-a-lifetime event. 
"It's going to be an experi­ence. So many people are going who don't have tickets," she said. "The whole point is to show up and be there in community supporting the president-elect. 
"Oddly enough, I'm looking forward to the erowd," she said. 
About 50 people are on the same bus as Laurel coming from Notre Dame, most mem­bers of the Notre Dame chap­ter of the College Demoerats, but also some who just got word of the bus trip and want­ed to join, she said.

Tension heightened in South Korea 
SEOUL -South Korea's hard-line president tapped a hawkish security expert to head the ministry in charge of relations with Pyongyang on Monday, a move bound to ratchet up already heightened tensions with the communist regime. 
Relations between the two Koreas, which fought a three-year war in the 1950s that ended in a shaky truce, have plummeted to their lowest point in a decade sinee President Lee Myung-bak took office a year ago. Pyongyang cut off ties and suspended key joint projects, and last weekend accused the South of plotting war. 
On Monday, the North's main Hodong Sillilllill newspaper reiterated the military's warning that it will respond to any South Korean aggres­sion with "one strike" capable of annihilation. 
"Thf:\ Lee Myung-bak group should bear in mind that our guns and bayonet.<; ... are aimed at theiJ· throat.s," the paper said in an editorial carried by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, warning that its threats are not "empty talk."

IRAQ 


New style of campaigning emerges 
Iraqi candidates answer a range of questions focused on grass-roots issues 
Associated Press 

BAGHDAD -Candidates in this month's provincial elections are answering questions from voters and debating issues ranging from Baghdad's housing shortage to the need to attract foreign investment. 
This is the new style of campaigning in Iraq, where candidates feel safe enough to stump for votes and focus on grass-roots issues instead of the religious divi­sions and violence that overshadowed earlier dec­tions held after Saddam Hussein's regime was top­pled in 2003. 
The shift was evident at a weekend forum that brought together 13 candidates in the Jan. 31 election for provincial councils, includ­ing a communist, Shiites, Sunnis and a journalist who formed a party named after an Iraqi television show called "Let's Talk." 
As a waiter in traditional Arab clothing poured coffee at the gathering in a Baghdad country club, the moderator and people in the audience asked candidates how they would improve public services. 
They got one minute for each answer. And nobody was fazed when the power went out briefly -a com­mon occurrence in a coun­misrule. civil war.

Russia, Ukraine make deal 
Gas crisis ends after with Russian c01npany ordering deliveries to resume 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -Russia and Ukraine pledged to restore natural gas supplies to Europe after signing deals Monday to end a bitter dis­pute that led to a chilling two-week cutoff of shipments. 
Europeans, who normally get about one-fifth of their gas from Russia via Ukrainian pipelines, anxiously awaited for the fuel to start flowing. 
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Yulia Tymoshenko on Monday signed the documents at Putin's government head­quarters on the Moscow river. They resulted from an outline agreement they had clinched in late-night talks Sunday as heads of Russia's state-run natural gas monopoly Gazprom and the Ukraine's Naftogaz. 
"As a result of intensive and lengthy talks we have reached agreement on all issues concerning natural gas supply to Ukraine and its transit to Europe," Putin said. He said Gazprom had been instructed to resume ship­ments bound for Europe that had been halted since Jan. 7 as Moscow and Kiev argued over 2009 gas prices and alle­gations that Ukraine was stealing gas destined for Europe. 
Tymoshenko said the gas would be pumped toward Europe as soon as it enters the Ukrainian pipes. 
Early Tuesday, Gazprom chief Alexei Miller ordered the resumption of deliveries 

bound for Europe via Ukraine to begin at 10 a.m. (2 a.m. EST) Tuesday. 
In a directive issued before dawn, Miller told company officials to ensure the neigh­boring countries' pipeline sys­tems are synehronized to get the gas f1owing at the desig­nated time. 
Offieials said the restored gas shipments could take up to 36 hours to cross Ukraine, whieh is the size of France, and reach European cus­tomers. 
EU officials were taking a wait and see attitude. 
"We now need an indication of the precise time that gas deliveries will be resumed. Our monitors will verify when the gas actually starts to flow," the European Commission said. 
Europe gets about 20 per­cent of its total natural gas needs from Hussia via Ukrainian pipelines, and the cutoff hit hard at some coun­tries, such as Bulgaria and Slovakia, that .rely almost entirely on Russia for gas. In the Balkans and other east­ern European nations, the crisis has shut factories and left millions of people to shiv­er in unheated homes. 
The confrontation has deeply shaken Europeans' trust in both Russia and Ukraine as reliable energy suppliers -something each has repeatedly insisted it is, while blaming the other for the supply cutoff. 
More than 15 nations have been forced to scramble for alternative sources of energy. The dispute was further com­plicated by geopolitical strug­gles over Ukraine's future and over lucrative export routes for the energy riches of the former Soviet Union. 
Before dawn Sunday, Tymoshenko and Putin nego­tiated a preliminary deal for Ukraine to get gas with a 20 percent discount from this year's average European price, which Hussia says is $450 per 1,000 cubic meters. That would double the prieB Ukraine paid in 2008. 
However, natural gas prices for Europe are expected to fall sharply later this year, due to the reduction in oil prices. By midsummer, Ukraine could be paying as little as $150 for 1,000 cubic meters, said Ronald Smith, a strategist at Mosr.ow's Alfa Bank. 
Russia, meanwhile, will not have to pay Ukraine higher transit prices to use its pipelines this year. Putin said in 2010. Ukraine will have to pay full price for Hussian gas, and Hussia will pay market prices for transit. 
Tymoshenko said the deal would save Ukraine billions of dollars. But there was no cel­ebration in the camp of her political rival, President Viktor Yushchenko. 
Citing Monday's deal, Yushchenko's energy adviser Bohdan Sokolovsky said Ukraine will pay $360 per 1,000 eubie meters in the first quarter of this year, and then a lower price. He said the average price for 2009 should be $235-$240 -still a signif­icant increase from the $179.50 it paid last year.

Notre Dame Theology depart­ment and director of the Institute for Church Life, said that beatification means that there is permission for a "public cult." 
Last year, a Mass and the con­ference "A Great Cloud of Witness: Saints in the Catholic Tradition" celebrated the feast day, according to Observer archives. 
This year, the celebration began with prayer vigil service in the Lady Chapel of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart last night. 
"The idea was to try to keep some tradition going associated with his feast day each year," Cavadini said. 
Today, Father David Tyson provincial superior of the Indiana Province of the Congregation of the Holy Cross, will preside at a Mass that will take place in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart at 5:15p.m. 
Along with the Mass, a panel discussion entitled "Men in Black: Holy Cross Stories" will take place at 7:30 p.m. in Washington Hall, according to a press release. 
Different religious congrega­tions have their own spirituality and approaeh, Cavadini said, 
ing the strength of King's messages came from the faet that King did not always tell people what they wanted to hear, but rather eaiJed peo­ple to something higher. 
"The power of King's ora­tory was to call us to moral goodness and away from our own selfish interests," he said. "As we go forth we can remember King's power to connect what he said and did in his life. We can strive to better our lives to this high­er calling.··

and Moreau's feast day allows for re11eetion on what would be a particularly Holy Cross approach. 
Panelists will be "reflecting on their vocation to Holy Cross," he said. 
During the event, audience members will be able to listen to the speakers' presentations and will have the opportunity to ask questions. 
"People will get a sense that they are not just priests," Cavadini said. "They are priests in a particular congregation of Holy Cross and [people will get the sense of! what that means to them." 
Cavadini will also deliver the inaugural Blessed Basil Moreau Lecture on Thursday at 7:30 
p.m. in the Jordan Auditorium of the Mendoza College of Business. 
The lectureship is a way to "commemorate the feast day with an academic event," Cavadini said. 
All of celebrations throughout the week are designed to pro­voke thought about Moreau and his values. 
'The idea is not just to com­memorate Basil Moreau and his ideals, but to develop them, to help our community think about how those ideals take root here now," Cavadini said.

Last week I visited the National Archives in Washington, D.C., a building that houses the most treasured historical documents of the United States govern­ment, induding the original copies of the Dedaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. Seeing these docu­menL<:> for the first time, after 21 years of living in the nation con­ceived in the ideals of their revered authors and born from the words carefully pre­served in ink upon their surfaces, was a deeply moving experiencP fur me, one that I will not soon forget. 
When we take a look back through our nation's history, however, it becomes !Wi­dent that many AmPricans have forgotten 
_the principles that are enshrined by these faded pages of parchment. Perhaps the most sacred among these principlPs is the preservation of individual liberty through limited government. What the Founders feared above all was a distant, powerful, centralized goverrnnent, and they took gn~at care to ensure that the institutions that replaeed the British crown would not revert baek to the tyram1y exemplified by thPir predecessor. In fael., their first attempt at establishing a government through the Articles of Confederation. while upholding statps' righL'l and individ­ual liberty, eventually proved too weak to enable the fledgling nation to survive. By writing the Constitution that endures today, the Founders managed to balance the need for more robust institutions with thei1· desire to secure the freedom of its people. 
Yet since the days of the Founding, the federal government has bPen allowed, at times even encouraged, to grow exponen-tially while interfering in aspm:ts of our daily lives that the Founders never intendnd. At the best of times, the expan­sion of the government at the expense of liberty is so gradual, so craftily disguised, that its nfli.1eL'l only beeonu~discernable with the clarity of hindsight. In times of crisis, however, mass hysteria and Hw desire for comfort enables the govern­ment, with the people's blessing.-to take unpreepdentnd measures that forewr broaden its rnalm of authority. 

Thomas Jell'Prson warned of tllis possi­ble developmm1t, stating, "the true theory of our Constitution is surely the wisest and best ... !fori when alt'government . .. shall be drawn to Washington as t.ltP centre of all power, it will render power­less the cheeks provided of one govern­ment on another. and will become as ... oppressive as the government from which we separated." Indeed, we now have a govPrnnwnt that more closely resembles the British monarchy, wielding its tremendous power from afar over the increasingly-wPakfmed states and individ­uals, than thn government of limited authoritv that the Founders envisioned. 
As anyonP who has st.udiPd American history (:an allirm, three of the most basic elements that the Founders \>Vrote irito thP Constitution to oblige the limitation of government include the notions of the separation of powers, federalism, and ehecks and balances. Yet today, instead of separation of powers, we have aetivist judges rewriting legislation to suit their own political belief's, and legislators try­ing to eonduet warfare based on popular sentiment. Instead of federalism, we have the national government rPaching beyond its enumerated powers and interfering in affairs that, according to the Tenth · AmendmPnt, should be left to the individ­ual states. And instead of checks and bal­ances, we have a newly-inaUf:,'llrated president whose party holds overwhelm­ing majorities in both Houses of Congress, making him more of a prin1e millister than the leader of an indepfmdent execu­tive branch. 
Furthermore. and perhaps most unset­tling to defenders of liberty, our new pres­ident and the party he leads insist that all of the nation's problems can be solved as long as people put their faith in govern­ment. Universal healthcare, "tax cuts" meant to redistribute wealth: opposition to the privatization of social security, spending billions on a green-energy plan. and the like are all examples of how he plans to use the goverl)ment to solve the nation's problems. And though his goals may seem worthy, his methods contradict the core prineiplPs of the Constitution. For all his talk of hope, he sure has very little in the American people. 
At this moment, our nation is facing a crisis that. though dissimilar in magni­tude to the Civil War or the Great Depression. nonetheless instills Amerieans with fear. This fear is a power­ful tool that the federal government can capitalize on in its desire to become more expansive, more powerful, and more dan­gerous to liberty than the Founders could have ever imagined. A leader, Pspecially one as charismatic as Obama, can make government intervention seem like the only method of dealing \\ith crisis and assuaging the fimr. Yet this fear, like Franklin Hoosevelt once declared (ironi­eally while presiding over one of the most egregious expansions of the federal gov­ernment in American history), is the only thing we have to fear, for it cloaks the vio­lation of liberty in terms t}J.at make it seem palatable, even necessary, to those who claim to defend it. 
If we are to remain true to the princi­ples of the Founding. it is imperative that we look beyond our immediate concerns and take great care to avoid falling prey to the temptation of relying on govern­ment, rather than the pPople, to ensure national prosperity.

For a couple of weeks now, friends and other people whom I unfortunately know, have joked around with me, asking how much I was looking forward to the upcoming inauguration. I am not going to lie -I have kind of been in a funk. All of the hype about it has gotten to me, and the multiple Facebook invites to speech-watching events and prayer services have not helped either.

will be a historic day and perhaps the most important day America will see during our lifetimes. We will see our country's first black president take office. 
Just think about it! Think about how far our country has come in the last 100 years. The path toward ridding our eountry of the regrettable prejudice and bigotry that has haunted it for so long has caused years of pain and frustration to go unnoticed. While we still have a long way to go, the inau­guration of President-elect Barack Obama will be perhaps the biggest step our country has taken. 
Throughout his trip to Washington, D.C., Obama has taken lines from both Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr., symbolizing both the impor­tance and the value of his inauguration. While the U.S. would never be where it is today without the guidance of these spectacular men, Obama has done something even greater. He did not achieve the presidency alone but with the help and support of Amerieans. This is not just Obama's achieve­ment and not just the achievement of one race -this is an ~chievement for the American people. 
This all may sound way too annoyingly idealistic, but there is really no other way to describe what will happen in Washington tomorrow. People will take their minds off of the economy, the war and even their worries about the future. Guantanamo Bay inmates will be there Wednesday (hope­fully), pro-lifers will still have the Freedom of Choice Act to worry about and conservative talk show hosts ean complain about the estimated $150 million price tag on Obama's inauguration gala for the rest of the week. Jan. 20 will be a sacred day, and we should all work to keep it that way. 
Tomorrow, those who are caught up in the hope and t;hange the Obama presidency will bring about and those who are unsure about the next four years should join together in wonder and amazement of what this country has just achieved. We have many changes to look forward to (or to dread), and there are still many problems yet to be revealed. Let's try to forget about those tomorrow and just soak in the day's historic importance.

Where would the United States be today if King had not 
Alligator

brazenly stuck his neck out for the good of his people'? 
It's a question no one can answer, but thankf\IIly, no one has to. At some point this weekend, dedicate a fraction of your time to recognizing the tri­umphs of a movement led by the will and the virtue of one man. 
King was a black man who campaigned for the civil rights, of all people, not just people of his race. Civil rights apply to everyone, regardless of skin color. King wanted all people to do the right thing, not just whites. 
He favored Sivil disobedience over the take-by-foree mentality of Maleolm X. King's words-over-weapons approach allowed him to gain the favor of white Americans­stamping his signature on the civil rights movement. His in1passioned speeches and peaeeful policies gained him the national attention necessary to create enough aware­ness to reinforce his cause. 
Consciousness snowballed into an avalanehe of furious discontent that overtook the nation. The nation's reaction ignited a glorious change in government and American society. Such ehange garnered by King's efl'orts (not to discredit the thousands of other faces of the 1960s civil rights movement) was something Americans eould believe in. 
Sound familiar'? There shouldn't be a person on the UF eampus who is able to conscientiously ignore the power of King's voice and the effects of hiS policies. 
President-elect Barack Obama has become the face of American politics in the past two years. Would his rise have been possible without the work of King and the rest of the civil rights movement'? Ifnot for King's leadership back then, would we even be able to envision a black president now'? 
Fortunately, our generation doesn't have to consider these possibilities. Instead, we have been blessed with the opportunity to witness the fruits of King's labor. 
Upon learning of threats made on his life in 1964, King responded, "If physieal death is the price that I must pay to free my white brothers and sisters from a perma­nent death of the spirit, then nothing can be more redemptive." 
King struggled for everyone, and his triumph is shared by all.

Writer Eric Roth's loose adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's wildly imaginative short story, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button", is a grand epic that sees its star. Brad Pitt, give the hands-.down best per­formance of his career. 
Director David Fincher's keen directing not only captures but expands on the won­der of Fitzgerald's story. Yet the true suc­cess here is the life both Fincher and Pitt breathe into the film's title character, the backwards-aging Benjamin Button. 
Told from a hospital room where Benjamin's old love interest, Daisy (Cate Blanchett), is dying, Benjamin's. sweeping story begins with a tale about a once­famous clockmaker whose grand creation turns out to be a clock that is only capable of working backwards. He explains that his son was killed in WWI and that the dock is an expression of his desire that time may run backwards so that his boy would, come back to him. This opening introduces the film's obsession with time running back­ward. Man's desire to cheat death and hold onto the love in his life is contrastPd with the passing of all things. 
Benjamin is born a decrepit baby who quickly grows into a failing man in his 80's with poor eyesight, arthritis, and a rasp, aged voice. His father (Jason Flemyng). shocked bv the birth, abandons the child, and leave·s him on a doorstep, where a maternal black woman, Queenie (Taraji P. Benson) takes him in and raises him as her own. He soon adapts to life growing up among the old. forgotten people who also inhabit the home, until one day. he meets a young girl, Daisy, who SfH~s past his condi­tion and all the way to the core of his youthfulness. 
Although many obstacles separate the two star-crossed lovers, such as Benjamin's servicP in WWII, his affair with an English spy's wife (Tilda Swinton), and Daisy's pur­suit of a career in ballet, Benjamin and Daisy inevitably find each other in the mid­dle of their respective lives. But just as time unites them, so it undoes them. Yet the love remains. even until the very end, when Daisy,· old but still able, takes can~ of an infant-looking Benjamin, until his eyes situ­ply close, and his journey has ended. 


Benjamin, as portrayed in old age by the film's talented CGI team, and by Pitt throughout the rest of the film, is a beauti­fully poignant eharaeter who stands as a hymn to life's many angles, all of which are as much mysterious as they are grand. 
Although it's a tad too long, at 166-min­utes, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is a roaring erowd-pleaser. Fincher and Roth somehow manage to adapt this imaginative piece and expound on it by shooting it ~rough ro,manee-infused veins. Whereas Fitzgerald's story is driven by the premise of a child born under eurious cir­cumstances, the true success here is that the movie pushes his condition to the back­seat and instead focuses on the curiosities that are life, death. and love.

Scene Writer 
Once in a blue moon, a film comes around that is so profound, so beautiful -yet also so tragic and so close to the heart-that, during the end credits, you sit motion­less, entranced, gazing at the dark screen while the rest of the audience shuffles out of the theater. 
"The Wrestler" is one such film. 
Acclaimed director Darren Aronofsky's depicts the arresting story about an over­the-hill wrestler who is trying to mount a comeback both out and inside the ring ­the only place he's ever truly been alive. The film operates in a weirdly poetic way, becoming a sort of beautiful requiem. 
Mickey Rourke plays Randy "The Ram" Robinson, a wrestler who was once on top of the sport. At one time headlining events across the country's biggest stages, he now remembers those days as nothing more than a distant life. 
The film begins with Randy panting in the corner of an elementary school class­room after having just fought a match in front of a handful of spectators in the school's gymnasium. Brilliantly placed right after an opening montage of his past suc­cesses, the f11m's first few scenes show just how far Randy has fallen from the top. But his struggle isn't one of an ex-star who had it all, lost it all, and now wants it back. Instead, it's the struggle of a human being with a dream. He's a man who once seem­ingly had it all, a man who had always lived in the ring. He's without t.he sort of love and compassion that transcends the cheers of fans and temporary fame. He's a man who, loved by society while he was on top, is cast aside once his fifteen minutes were up. Ultimately, he was left numb and unable to experience life outside of the ring. 
It's the relationships that shape this film; those between Randy; his love interest, an outcast stripper tMarissa Tomei); his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood}, who he aban­doned to pursuP a wrestling career; and his diehard fans who follow him into exile. Additionally, the stability that eludes Randy defines the film. Aronofsky's directing and the cast's performances, all of which are nomination-worthy, elevate Randy's story into something worthy of chHers and tears. 
Mickey Rourke and the role of Randy were made for each other. An actor who was once a headlining star atop the film industry has since become a Hollywood reject who plays supporting roles in straight-to-video films. He was Randy "The Ram" in every sense. and "The Wrestler" is his comeback. 
Make no mistake: this is the resurrection of a gifted actor. Rourke's performance is not only award-worthy, but so immaculate, that it is worthy of bPing placed alongside the great screen performances of all-time, Credit is also due to Aronofsky, who had the gumption to put his career on the line to give Hourke the chance to shine once again. ­
That isn't his only success though. Aronofsky is praise-vvorthy in his own right for

but a great deal more difficult for a director, much less one of Aronofsky's silk, to edit himself. Yet he resists his usual impulse for flair directing and camera trickery,. and instead trusts his actors enough to let them anchor the film, which ultimately pays off. By leaving the film to unfold on its own, Aronofsky is put into the position of being a minimalist director at the helm of an equally minimalist, but immensely powerful film. 
It could be said that "The Wrestler" is one of those rare films that will at once unnerve and sooth you, making you glow with delight for the film's underdog one sec­ond, only to cry the very next as the film treks down its inevitably tragic path.

"The Wrestler" can only be described by the feeling you get when the screen cuts to black and Bruce Springsteen's original song, "The Wrestler," begins to play in the background. It's an indelible feeling that what you've just witnessed is more than the triumphant comPback of a fine actor, more than thE' year's best picture, and a great deal more than a film.

Nowitzki's ·buzzer-beater ends Philly's streak 
76ers' seven-game winning streak snapped; Ming scores 31 points, Alston adds 18 in Houston's win over Denver 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA Dirk Nowitzki carne through when it mattered. 
Despite missing 13 of his first 14 shots and 16 of 23 overall, the seven-foot forward hit a turnaround 17 -foot jumpPr over Reggie Evans at the buzzer to give the Dallas Mavericks a 95-93 victory against Philadelphia, snapping the 76ers' season-high seven­game winning streak. 
''I'm a shooter," Nowitzki said. "I always think the next one is going in." 
Nowitzki received the inbounds pass with 4.3 sec­onds left and spun around the 6-foot-8 Evans to deliver the game-winning shot. 
"It's easy to get it to him because he's seven feet," Kidd said of Nowitzki. "He's done it all year. He's an All-Star and an MVP and he enjoys these moments." 
Nowitzki finished with 24 points, Jason Kidd had 22 points and 12 rebounds and Jason Terry added 20 for the Mavericks (24-17). 
Philadelphia coach Tony DiLeo didn't second-guess his decision to put the smaller Evans on Nowitzki. 
"Heggie had a good feel for him because he was guarding him for the last five minutes as we were making our come­back," DiLeo said. "Reggie is a physical guy who did push him out and contested the shot." 
Lou Williams scored 25 points, while Andre Iguodala had 18 points and 12 rebounds for the 76ers (20­21), who are trying to climb 
above .500 for the first time since Nov. 23 when they were 7-6. 
Andre ·Miller added 12 points for Philadelphia, whose four-game home winning streak ended. 
"I was proud of the way we came back," Iguodala said. "I think we need to continue to have that hunger." 
The 76ers have reason to be optimistic with the expected return of forward Elton Brand, who worked out on the court before the game. DiLeo said Brand, who dislocated his right shoulder De-c. 17 and has missed 16 consecutive games, most likely will play Saturday against the New York Knicks. 
Dallas overcame an early deficit and was sparked by Kidd and Nowitzki. Kidd tied his season-high with six 3­pointers, while Nowitzki shook off a poor shooting perform­ance from the field (7-of-23) by hitting all 10 of his free throws. Nowitzki is 44-for-45 from the free throw line over the last six games. 
Kidd was 6-of-8 from 3-point territory. 
"They're going to give me 3­point shots," Kidd said. "I haven't been making many, but I've been staying with it." 
Dallas trailed 55-47 with 
8:58 remaining in the third quarter, then went on a 19-4 run over six minutes. Kidd scored 11 points, including three 3-pointers, and Nowitzki had eight during the scoring spurt to give the Mavericks a 66-59 advantage. 
By the end of the third quar­ter, the Mavericks led 74-63, with Kidd and Nowitzki com­bining for 25 of their 32

points. 

With 2:14 remammg, Terry hit a 3-pointer from the base­line to give Dallas a 93-81 lead. It wouldn't last as the 76ers scored 12 straight points, tying the game at 93 with 8.5 seconds left after a driving layup by Iguodala. 
"We really came back there at the end," DiLeo said. "They never gave up. That's the essence of our team." 
Rockets 115, Nuggets 113 

HOUSTON -The Denver Nuggets felt a bad call cost them a win against the Houston Hockets. 
Yao Ming scored 31 points, Hafer Alston added 18 points and 11 assists and the Rockets beat the Nuggets 115-113 on Monday. 
Denver's Kenyon Martin missed two foul shots with 2.6 seconds left, and Yao got the rebound to clinch the win. But the Nuggets felt they had the go-ahead basket wrongly taken away on their previous possession. 
Yao missed with 18 seconds left, Martin rebounded and Denver coach George Karl called timeout. Lina.s Kleiza drove into the lane and passed to Nene for a dunk. But the basket didn't count beeause referee Bennett Salvatore called a eharge on Kleiza for running into Chuck Hayes. 
"I thought it was definitely a flop," Kleiza said. "I definitely didn't feel like I hit him. But. oh well. It's done. We've got to Inove on." 
Aaron Brooks hit 1-of-2 from lhe line with 6.5 seconds to go and Karl called one more timeout. 
Chauncey Bi.llups fed Martin cutting down the lane, and he was fouled. Martin came into the game making 58.3 percent of his free throws. 
The Nuggets were too steamed about Salvatore's call on Kleiza to blame Martin for the loss. 
"L.K. made a great play," Karl said. "It was a great play that won the game. We're just going to go home without a win." 
J.H. Smith scored 24, Nene had 23 and Martin 22 for the Nuggets, who lost for just the third time in 12 games. 
"We had great effort," Karl said. "My big guys battled Yao and got beat up a lot. He's a tough eat, gets away with a lot of holding, grabbing and dis­lodging. There are losses that are good losses. Tonight was a good loss. We did a lot of things well." 
Von Wafer had 1R points and Luis Scola· finished with 16 for the Hockets, who have won five of their last six games. Yao went 13-for-19 from the field -5-for-8 in the fourth quarter. 
"lie was terrific," Houston coach Hick Adelman said. "He made some really positive plays." 
Yao. who went 12-for-12 from the field in a win over Miami. on Saturday, missed his first two shots on Monday. Alston sank his first f'ive shots, including three 3-pointers, to carry the Hockets early. 
Yao spun for a dunk 90 sec­onds into the third quarter, then drew his fourth foul going for an offensive rebound on Houston's next possession. The Nuggets continued their accurate shooting, hitting five of their first eight after the break to build an 80-73 lead. 
Denver finally started miss­ing and the Hockets finished the third quarter with a 17-7 spurt to take a 90-87 lead to the fourth. The Nuggets scored 64 points in the first half, but mustered only 19 in the third quarter. 
"Our defense in the second half was kev," Yao said. "In the first half, they shot way too many layups. We did a bet­ter job in the second half." 
Smith started the final quar­ter with a pair of 3-pointers to put the Nuggets back in front. He hit four 3s and went 6-for­1 0 from the field i.n the fourth quarter. 
"I tried to do what I do," Smith said. "Just keep shoot­ing, just try to get my rhythm." 
Billups broke a 103-all tie with Denver's eighth 3-pointer with 6:27 left. Yao argued a traveling call at the other end and got a technical foul and Billups' free throw put Denver up 107-103. 
"It was one of those games where you kind of had to claw your way back into it," said Brent Barry, who scored 11 for Houston. "[t's kind of like the person who is going to score last is going to win." 
Yao's hook shot with 1:41 lnft gave the Rockets a 114­110 lead. Smith hit his fifth 3­pointer with 1 :05 remaining to cut Houston's lead to one.

Associated Press 

NEW YORK Baltimore defensive coor­dinator Hex Hyan was hired as the coach of the New York Jets on Monday, a day after the Ravens lost in the AFC championship. 
The 46-year-old Hyan replaces the fired Eric Mangini. taking over a team that started last season 8-3 but missed the playoffs with quarterback Brett Favre after losing four of its last five games. 
The Jets announced the hiring, but released no other details. The con­tract is for four years, a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity earlier Monday because the deal had not been announced. 
Ryan, the son of former NFL coach Buddv Rvan, will be formally in-tro­duced at a news confer­ence Wednesday at the Jets' facility in Florham Park, N.J. 
"It's been a dream of mine to become a head coach in the NFL," Ryan said in a statement. "Coming here to the New York Jets, where my father once coached and was part of the Super Bowl III staff, is fantastic. I look around at the facili­
ties and the people they have in place and see a first-class organization. I'm just proud to be part of it." 
The deal was finalized Monday afternoon after Jets owner Woody Johnson and general manager Mike Tannenbaum flew to Baltimore in the morning to iron out the details, team spokesman Bruce Speight said. 
"We got the right man for the job," Johnson said in a statement. 
The Ravens' defensive coorainator the last four seasons is the twin broth­er of Cleveland defensive coordinator Rob Ryan. 
His Baltimore defense helped the Ravens to the AFC championship game and has been ranked in the top six in total yardage allowed the last four seasons, including second overall this season while leading the NFL with 34 takeaways. 
"I think it's a gain for them and a loss for us, but it's well-deserved," Ravens linebacker Bart Scott said. "It was a long timP coming." 
This will be the first head coaching job for Ryan, who is said to he well liked among his play­ers becausr of his straightforward, no-non­sense style.

Giants appoint Sheridan 
defensive coordinator 
EAST HUTIIERFORD, N.J.-Less than two days after Steve Spagnuolo left to become coach of the St. Louis Hams, Tum Coughlin promoted linebackers eoach Bill Sheridan to replace hin1 a'i the New York Giants' defensive eoordinator. 
Coughlin interviewed Sheridan and secondary coach Peter Giunta for the coordinator's job Sunday. Giunta was the Ran1S' defensive coordinator when they won the 2000 Super Bowl. 
Sheridan has spent four seasons V\ith the Giants, with his biggest challenge coming in 2007 when he helped Mathiac; Kiwanuka make the move from defen­sive end to linebaeke1: 
Before coming to the NFL, Sheridan spent two decades as a college assistant, eoaching all the positions on defense in that span. 
111e Giants played an aggressive blitz­ing defense in Spagnuolo's two years as defensive coordinator, and Sheridan said that he will keep the system, although he will make some modifications. 
McGahee released from 
hospital, returns home 
OWINGS MILLS. Md. -Willis McGahee joined his teammates Monday at Baltimore's training complex after doctors told him he would make a full recovery from a fierce helmet-to-helmet hit in the AFC championship game that had him carted ofr the field. 
The play occurred in the fourth quarter of Pittsburgh's 23-14 victo­ry. McGahee had just caught a pass and taken two steps before being met by safety Ryan Clark, who drove his helmet into McGahee's face mask. McGahee·s head snapped back, and he lost the ball as he dropped to the ground. 
"I didn't even see him coming," McGahee said. 
Clark also collapsed, though it was immediately apparent that his injury wasn't serious. Players from both teams gathered around McGahee, who lay motionless before being taken away.

NHL 
Sharks recall 43-year­old Lemieux fro111 AHL 
Celebrate the Feast Day of 
Blessed Basil Moreau 
January 20th 
Associated Press 
SAN JOSE, Calif. -Nearly six years after Claude Lemieux retired, he's back to pester the NHL again. 
The San Jose Sharks recalled the 43-year-old for­ward from their AHL affiliate on Monday. adding a four­time Stanley Cup winner to a team already tied for the overall league lead. 
Lemieux probably will be in San Jose's lineup Tuesday night against Vancouver. He spent the past eight weeks riding the bus and playing against the next generation in Worcester. Mass., making sure his physical skills still matched his desire to com­plete a comeback that's been on his mind since shortly after he retired in 2003. 
"The more I was told this was impossible, the more I wanted it." Lemieux said after his first practice with the Sharks. "I still feel that way. This is just the first step to life back in the NHL.... I _ got into this with my eyes wide open, knowing that most folks out there would think that I'm out of my mind to attempt to do something like this." 
Lemieux once was hockey's archetypal agitating forward. beloved by his teammates 
and despised by everybody else during parts of 20 sea­sons with five NHL clubs. He also was among the best playoff performers of his generation, with 80 postsea­son goals that are still ninth­most in league history. 
Lemieux, who will wear No. 32 in teal, won titles with Montreal (1986), New Jersey (1995, 2000) and Colorado (1996), earning the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff MVP for the Devils in 1995. 
Sharks coach Todd McLellan. who's over-two years younger than Lemieux, is expected to have Lemieux in uniform against the Canucks in San Jose's final game before the All-Star break -nearly 24 years after his NHL debut in 1985. 
"The excitement is proba­bly about the same," Lemieux said. recalling that first game with the Canadiens. "The only difference is I know what to expect, and back then I didn't know what to expect. I've done this before. and it's going to help me through the process. I worked very hard to get to where I'm at today. It's what I wanted, a chance to live this dream again, and it's great to be here." 
Lemieux's career petered out after 32 games and seven playoff appearances with the Dallas Stars in 2003. He lived in Phoenix after his retire­ment, dabbling in real estate investment, appearing on a reality show and briefly serv­ing as president of the ECHL's Phoenix Roadrunners. 
But a comeback already was on his mind when he played briefly in Switzerland in 2004 before the league's lockout season. After nearly starting a return in 2007, he got his wife's approval to try it last fall. 
"With the lockout, I thought 


Today we have an enhanced awareness of the rich and living legacy that Basil Moreau passed on, not only to the religious ofHoly Cross and those who minister with them, but to all who are committed to continuing the mission and message of Jesus. 
JOEL GIALLANZA, C.S.C. 

I'd missed my opportunity, but I missed being out there," Lemieux said. "I missed the camaraderie and the chance to do something you love. To know that you've got to get up in the morning and be some place, and you've got a job to do ... it's just the best life. I'm very thankful that I can do this again." 
Sharks general manager Doug Wilson is no stranger to reclamation projects after adding Jeremy Roenick and Saudis Ozolinsh to his club last season. He also provided a chance to Lemieux, who joined the Worcester Sharks in late November and signed a two-way contract in late December. 
With Wilson monitoring every shift on television, Lemieux had three goals and eight assists in 23 games with Worcester. racking up 24 penalty minutes and a plus-2 rating. 
"Historically, people that can come back and help you later in their careers usually have similar attributes.~' Wilson said. "A t'ove for the game, a high level of intelli­gence, and ... being geneti­cally gifted. lie's gifted, and he's gone and put the work and time and energy in. He's not been given anything by

us. If anything, we've given him a couple of (reasons) to say it's not been worth it." 
Lemieux won't be the oldnst 
player in the NHL, not with 
Detroit defenseman Chris 
Chelios turning 47 later this 
month. But his comeback is 
even more remarkable 
because of his lengthy 
absence from the game. 
Montreal coach Guy Carbonneau played with Lemieux during parts of six seasons with the Canadiens 
in the 1980s. 
"I'm very surprised, even shocked," Carbonneau said after the Canadiens' practice Monday. "Chris Chelios is 46 years old. but the fact that Claude stopped playing three or four years ago, it shows the kind of character he has. I'm happy for him. When· I first heard about it, I didn't think it would be possible, but it just goe-s to show that nothing is impossible." 
Although the Sharks led the overall NHL standings with 71 points entering Monday's games, their fourth line has­n't been impressive or pro­ductive since Roenick was sjdelined last month with a shoulder injury. If Lemieux sticks and Roenick returns soon, the Sharks could match Roenick and Lemieux with enforcer Jody Shelley on a line that would be among the NHL's most entertaining, if no longer its most talented. 
Lemieux replaces young forwards Brad Staubitz and Tom Cavanagh. who were sent back to Worcester so they can play through the All-Star break. 
"Claude deserved it, he earned it, and I really can't stress it enough that the guys down in Worcester are happy for him," Wilson said. "They know he put in the work. lie's happy to be here, it's that simple."

Pavel retires because of injury, gives Murray win 
Associated Press 
MELBOURNE, Australia ­Andy Murray's first win at Rod Laver Arena was a little low key. 
The 21-year-old Seot, carry­ing the hopes of a British pub­lic looking for its first male Grand Slam champion since 1936, was leading Andrei Pavel 6-2, 3-1, 15-0 in the Australian Open when the Romanian retired with a back injury. 
The fourth-seeded Murray, who lost last year's U.S. Open final to Roger Federer. didn't mind getting off the court as the midday temperatures topped 99 degrees on Tuesday, day two of the first major of the year. 
"It's the first time I've ever won a match on here," he said. "You don't want to win a match like that. Andrei's been having trouble with his back for a year." 
Murray was installed as the favorite or joint favorite for the tournament by British bookmakers after beating Federer three times since los­ing the U.S. Open final -his best run at a major to date. 
'Tm aiming to go one better here and I need all the sup­port I can get," he said, noting the number of Scottish flags unfurled around the stadium. "It's nice. Hopefully they'll keep coming throughout the tournament." 
Murray defended his Qatar Open title before coming to Melbourne but said it was still difficult getting used to the Australian summer. 
The relentless sun had play­ers seeking shelter in whatev­er shade they could find between points. 
Murray, who worked hard in an offseason conditioning pro­gram that has added seven pounds of muscle to his lean frame, was sharp from the start, exerting pressure with virtually every shot. 
Pavel managed to keep pace for the first four games before his feet betrayed him at the same time that his back was letting him down. He was twice called for foot-faults as Murray broke him for a 3-2 lead while running off the last five games of the first set. 
Pavel had a quick massage on his lower back during the changeover, held se·ve, and lost 13 of the next 14 points. 
Federer commenced his quest for a 14th major to equal Pete Sampras' record with a 6-1, 7-6 (4), 7-5 first­round win over 35th-ranked Andreas Seppi of Italy that fin­ished after midnight. 
It was a difficult opener, considering Seppi is only just outside the top 32 players who are seeded for the tourna­ment. 
Federer had mononucleosis this time last year and that dogged him for months. 
"I wasn't fit, I had hardly played any matches, had any practice." he said. "This year I had much more preparation and 1 feel 1 know where mv game's at." · 
Second-seeded Serena Williams, the reigning U.S. Open champion and winner each odd year at Melbourne Park since 2003. faces Yuan Meng of China on Tuesday. 
Sixth-seeded Venus Williams, who won her fifth Wimbledon title and finished off 2008 by winning the sea­son-ending tour champi­onship, goes against Angelique Kerber of Germany. 
Fourth-seeded Elena Dementieva, unbeaten in 10 matches this year and winner of the Beijing Olympic gold medal, plays Kristina Barrois. 
Hafael Nadal starts his sec­ond consecutive major as the top seed in a night match against Christophe Hochus of Belgium, about the same time No. 9 James Blake is due to play Canada's Frank Dancevic. 
Blake and Andy Roddick arR leading the American charge. 

Mardy Fish also advanced, but six other Americans made first-round exits: Hobby Ginepri, John Isner, Hobert Kendrick, Bobby Reynolds, Sam Querrey and Taylor Dent. 
Dent, returning from three back operations for his first major since 2006, lost to fel­low American Amer Delic in tive sets. 
Other men advancing were No. 8 Juan Martin del Potro and No. 10 David Nalbandian of Argentina, No. 11 David Ferrer, No. 15 Stanislas Wawrinka, 2005 champion Marat Safin, 2006 finalist Marcos Baghdatis and 16­year-old Australian Bernard Tomic. 
Third-seeded Dinara Sa fin a and No. 7 Vera Zvonareva of Russia, No. 11 Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark, No. 15 Alize Cornet of France, No. 16 Marion Bartoli and No. 19 Daniela Hantuchova were among the women advancing.

Francisco. 
Defender Elise Weber and Hanks will continue to play as teammates as Weber was taken the 21th overall pick by the St. Louis Athletica. The transfer from the University of Wisconsin started all 53 games during her two years with the Irish and helped Dew keep the. Irish defense standing. 
ln addition to the four graduating seniors, the Irish lost another familiar face to the draft. Current volunteer assistant coach Amanda Cinalli was selected by St. Louis in the general draft for players no longer in college. Other recent graduates selected include defender Christie Shaner ('07), who was selected in the fourth round (25th over­all) and midfielder J en Buezkowski ('07), who went in the sixth round (39th overall) to Sky Blue FC (New Jersey.) 
Irish standout Kate (Sobrero) Markgraf ('98) is listed on the Chicago roster but will sit out the league's inaugural season as she is awaiting the birth of her second child. Another Notre Dame graduate, midfielder Shannon Boxx ('99), joins Bock in Los Angeles. 
The WPS is the second attempt at women's profes­sional soccer in the U.S. The Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA) was founded in 2000 but only survived three seasons before folding. With fresh stars like those coming off the Irish graduating class, many hold hopes the WPS will survive longer than its predecessor. Boasting inter­nationally-famed players like Brazil's Marta (Los Angeles Sol) and America's own Abby Wambach (Washington Freedom), the WPS stands a fighting ehanee. 
The first match kieks off Sunday. March 29, when Bock and the Los Angeles Sol play host to the Washington Freedom in Carson, Calif.

Pitt rebounds with big conference victory over Syracuse 
Associated Press 
PITTSBUHGH -Pittsburgh went through more than half a season without losing, then faced the realistic pos­sibility of losing twice in three days. 
The Panthers didn't let it happen, making sure every­thing that went wrong in its first loss -the lack of rebounding, the poor down­the-stetch shooting -wasn't repeated. · 
Sam Young pulled out of a three-game slump by scor­ing 19 of his 22 points in the second half and No. 4 Pittsburgh surged shortly after halftime to defeat No. 8 Syracuse 78-60 on Monday night. 
·''The big thing in this league (the Big East) is not turning one {loss) into two," point guard Levance Fields said. 
DeJuan Blair, also coming off a poor game during a 69­63 loss at Louisville on Saturday night that ended Pitt's two-week stay at No. 1, was strong inside with 20 points and 12 rebounds. 
Blair's toughness keyed a rugged and at times intimi­dating defense. The Panthers outrebounded the Orange 40-28 and held them nearly 22 points below their scoring average. 
Several Syracuse players were seen complaining to the officials that Pitt (17-1, 5-1) was being too physical, and the Orange (17-3, 5-2) drew two technical fouls less than three minutes apart during the first half. 
Young, Pitt's leading scor­er with an 18.7 average, made seven of 12 shots after going only 15-of-49 in his previous three games. Pitt missed 15 of its final 16 shots while losing a 10-point lead at now-No. 9 Louisville. 
"But as soon as we got on the airplane, we forgot about it," Blair said. "Sometimes you're going to come up short." 
As Syracuse knows. The Orange went 1-2 during a three-game stretch against ranked· Georgetown, Notre Dame and Pitt, beating only the Irish. 
"When you don't play well offensively, this is what's going to happen in this league," Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim said. "But I told the players, we're 17-3 and 5-2, and that's better than we're supposed to be. It's frustrat­ing when you lose, but you have to understand where you are." 
Andy Rautins hit five 3­pointers while scoring 17, but Orange leading seorer Jonny Flynn made three of 
14 shots while being held to 
12 points, four below his 
average. 
"It was him (Hautins) ­

and nobody else," Blair said. 
Pitt bega'n pulling away by 
scoring nine consecutive 
points, finished off by 
Young's layup off Jermaine 
Dixon's pass, to make it 42­
35 with 15:21 remaining. 
The Panthers stretched the 
lead to 53-40 on Fields' 
drive, and Syracuse got no 
closer than seven after that. 
Pittsburgh also went on a 
9-0 run midway through the 
first half to take a 20-11 
lead. The advantage would 
have been bigger if the 
Panthers made some free 
throws -they missed six of 
their first seven, ineluding 
all four by Fields following 
the technicals. Fields had 15 
points and six assists, and 
Pitt ended up 9-of-17 at the 
line. 

"We were in the game, but 
we still were frustrated," 
Boeheim said. "We shouldn't 
have been frustrated." 

The Orange answered with 
a 9-0 run of their own, fin­'ished off by Rautins' 3­pointer that gave them their 
first lead at 28-27. 

Blair came baek to make 
two free throws, drawing 
loud cheers from an 
announced erow.d of 12,508 
that looked to be even larg­er, and Pitt trailed only once after that. For one of the few times since the Petersen Events Center opened in 2002, the ticket demand was. so great that students were turned away. 
Syracuse, blanketed by Pitt's defense, couldn't come up with another run in the second half that would have tightened the game. The Orange came in averaging 
81.5 points, but shot 41.8 pereent (23-of-55) to Pitt's 53.3 percent (32-of-60). 
Pitt was especially effee­tive against Flynn, who scored 28 points as Pitt ral­lied to win 82-77 win at 
Syracuse last  season  after  
trailing by  11  with  3:49  
remaining.  
Pitt  improved  to  2-1  

against ranked opponents, with its other win against Georgetown. Pitt has won its last three at home and six of eight overall from .Syracuse, which five years ago became the first visiting team to win at the Petersen Center. 
The crowd gave some of its biggest cheers to the three Steelers players spotted in the crowd Ben Roethlisberger, Jeff Reed and Santonio Holmes, with Heed pointing proudly to his AFC championship T-shirt.

Here's a look at the standings: 
No.10 Marquette (16-2, 5-0) 
The Golden Eagles have bene­fited from playing a relatively easy portion of their Big East schedule, but they beat the teams they should beat, which is what you need to do to survive in thP Big East. They passed their first test on Saturday, winning on the road against a tough Providence team. 
No. 12 Louisville (13-3, 4-0) 
Louisville could easily be 1-3 right now. If Villanova could have made a layup in the final seconds, the Cardinals would've lost to the Wildcats. If Notre Dame hadn't forgotten how to score late in the game, they would've lost to the Irish. And they were behind Saturday against a Pittsburgh team that was ranked No. 1 in the country. But here they are, undefeated in conference play with a big road game against · Syracuse on the horizon Sm1day. 
No.3 Connecticut (16-1, 5-1)

Teanz must greatly improve on defense 
In the early part of this decade, the Dallas Mavericks were sometimes derisively referred to as the "Alias Mavericks." The nickname poked fun at the fact 
·that the offensively­charged Mavs had no D. 
Well, if Notre Dame doesn't step it up on the defensive end, Big East oppo­nents might justifiably start ealling the Irish "Notre Arne." 

"The team has repeatedly struggled to get stops, especial­ly during crucial situations. The problem has never been more evident than during Saturday's 93-74 Sf~tback at Syracuse. The Orange owned the Irish inside on the way to a 54-24 edge in points in the paint. 
Notre Dame fought baek sev­eral times during the second half, cutting its deficit to five or six points. But the Irish also repeatedly lacked the tough­ness to get a key stop. 
For a team with a typical rotation of four seniors and three juniors, Notre Dame looked surprisingly rattled on the defensive end during key moments against Syracuse and last Monday against Louisville.

By DEIRDRE KRASULA Sports Writer
