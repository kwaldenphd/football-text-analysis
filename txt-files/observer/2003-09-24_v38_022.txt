Cheney could visit JACC for fundraiser 

By MEGHAN MARTIN Associate News Edicor 
Vice President Dick Cheney is slated to be the keynote speaker at a fundraising luncheon for Hepublican Indiana Congressman Chris Chocola on Oct. 9 in the Joyce Center. 
According to invitations sent out for the event, Cheney, who visited the area in May 2002 during Chocola's bid for his current Congressional seat, will address a $250-per-plate crowd of supporters that Thursday. 
For security reasons, Chocola's office would not officially confirm the vice president's visit. 
"We cannot confirm the vice president's schedule," Chocola spokesman Brooks Kochvar said. "The White !louse press office will say the same thing. 
For security reasons, they will not publicize his schedule until 48 hours in advance." 
Cheney's office could not be reached for comment. 
If the vice president does participate in the luncheon, a $2,000-per-couple reception will be held before the signa­ture event, which will give patrons the opportunity to meet and pose for photo­graphs with him. 
Cheney's last visit to South Bend raised over $250,000 for Chocola's initial congres­sional bid, and October's event, with 3,500 invitations already sent out, has the potential to raise even more for the incumbent's re-elec­tion campaign.

Dean Eileen Kolman and the rest of the First Year of Studies Department saw months of hard work come to fruition Tuesday night as its first­annual academic convocation titled "The United States and the Middle East: Do We Face a 'Clash of Civilizations'?" took center stage at the Joyce Center. 
"[This convocation is] designed to provide insight into the way scholars tackle thorny problems," Kolman said. Roughly 1,000 students attended the convocation, although students left in large groups after each panel pres­entation.

ND prof heals from U.N. bombing 
By MEGHANNE DOWNES 
News Editor 

The Notre Dame professor emeritus injured in the Aug. 19 suicide bombing of the Baghdad U. N. headquarters made a considerable step in his long road to recovery last week, speaking audibly for the first time since the inci­dent, his family reported. 
Gilbert Loescher's relatives posted the information on a Web site tracking his recov­ery. They said his tracheosto­my tube was replaced Thursday with a smaller, more flexible tube, allowing him to speak more clearly. 
Family members posted that, prior to Thursday's pro­cedure, the political science professor emeritus would attempt to talk and would become anxious and frustrat­ed when he could not be understood. Doctors informed the family that it was com­mon for patients with tra­cheostomies to believe that others can hear them because they can hear their own voice even though their attempts to speak are inaudible. 
Loescher, who is now able to talk for brief periods, recounted memories from the blast. 
Relatives posted that he remembered seeing his right hand getting sliced during the explosion, the floor falling and the ceiling caving in.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Don't 'fix' sm_oking rule 
Let me preface this column by saying that I do not smoke. I tried a cigarette once several years ago and didn't find it particularly appealing. It's also pretty obvious that smoking leads to cancer, damages teeth and skin, and is an expensive habit. 
That being said, smoking tobacco is legal in this country and I respect other people's right to light up as long as they do so in a man­ner that shows concern toward others. 
Thus, I do not believe that the University should consider a cam­pus-wide ban on smoking. I believe that the current policy is effective in creating an environment that allows both smokers and nonsmok­ers to coexist fairly peacefully. 
According to du Lac, "the right of non-smokers to a smoke-free envi­ronment always takes precedence over the desire of smokers to smoke." The undergraduate student handbook states that smoking is prohibited in all buildings, stadiums and University vehicles. Notre Dame leaves open the possibility of allowing students to smoke in their dorm rooms, but individual halls have rules and regulations that effectively forbid it. University poli­cy also prohibits smoking in out­door high-traffic areas. 
This essentially means that stu­dents are forced to smoke in desig­nated outdoor areas. Such meas­ures ensure that those who smoke have an opportunity to do so, while safeguarding those who may have asthma, are allergic to tobacco smoke or find the habit unpleasant. 
My experience to date has indi­cated that, overall, Notre Dame smokers are respectful of the rules and other people. I am rarely bom­barded with the smell of smoke when I walk around campus and I almost never see litter from tobacco products on the ground. 
I have, however, observed a nationwide trend that aims at demonizing and belittling those who smoke. I have watched passers-by reward smokers who are enjoying their habit at a consid­erate distance from others with dirty looks, and I have friends who dispense insulting and condescend­ing remarks to smokers because they "care." 
If the University is smart, it will avoid getting involved in this messy debate. The current policy on smoking is effective in creating a good environment for nonsmokers while simultaneously accommodat­ing those who smoke. 
As the old adage says, "If it isn't 
broke, don't fix it."

Woman bites two librarians In robbery 
CRAWFORDSVILLE, Ind.­A woman bit two librarians after they tried to stop her from stealing about $70 from the public library's cash drawer. 
One of the librarians, Debbie Barry, said that a man tried to distract her Saturday while a woman grabbed the money and fled. 
Barry and fellow librarian Christina Crouch chased the woman outside and wrestled with her while library patrons called police. The woman bit Crouch on the chest and Barry's thumb before the man pulled her free and they ran off. 
"When I grabbed her it was kind of stupid," Barry told the Journal Review newspaper. "What I should have done was yanked her hair and sat on her, but I didn't think of it at the time." 
Anna M. Davis, 24, and her live-in boyfriend, Kevin 
T. Kamradt, 25, were caught a few minutes later, police Officer Bob Rivers said. An officer at the Montgomery County Jail reported finding $71 in Davis' underwear.

Flint wrote two letters to The Observer two weeks ago on the subject of llonor Code violations. One decried the suspected number of viola­tions by students and the fac­ulty inconsistencies in deal­ing with them. The second proposed changes that may be made to rectify the situa­tion. 
Flint said he believes stu­dents arc cheating and not getting caught, and faculty arc handling I Ionor Code vio­lations on their own.

fessors are 
reluctant to surrender what power they have. It's not a particularly nice trait, but I think it's accurate," Flint said. 
The main problem with this practice, Flint said, is that it creates the opportuni­ty for students to repeatedly commit Honor Code offenses· because there is no record of their violations. Under the Honor Code, students who commit a second violation would usually be suspended or dismissed from the University. If faculty mem­bers do not report incidents, however, students can violate the Honor Code repeatedly and never have any ultimate penalty. 
"Faculty who fashion pri­vate penalties are opening the door to the possibility of serial offenders," he said. 
Faced with this problem, Flint believes there is a possi­ble solution, albeit a some­what radical one. 
He said he would like to propose a system in which professors are explicitly per­mitted to negotiate penalties for Honor Code violations directly with students. In this system, not every case would go directly before an honesty committee. 
The catch would be that faculty members would be required to submit a report of the violation and penalty the student sustained to the Associate Provost's Office for record keeping. In this way, Flint said there would be a record of students who com­mitted offenses. 
"At least if this was made an appropriate or acceptable option, there would be some sort of check on those who are [violating the Honor Code] repeatedly," he said. 
Flint said feedback to his proposal has been positive. 
"I've received a lot of feed­back from faculty ... I haven't had one faculty member who has clearly opposed this proposition," he said. 
Any changes recommend­ed by the University Honor Code Committee must be passed be the University's Academic Council.

SMC professor's study 
Kim's paper explains N. Korean Sunshine Policy 
By NICOLE ZOOK 
News Writer 

Sci-Hill Kim. assistant professor of Communications Studies at Saint Mary's, recently received word from the International Journal of Public Opinion Research that his paper, "Talking on Sunshine in North Korea: A Test of the Spiral of Silence as a Theory of Powerful Media Effects," will be published at the end of this year. 
The paper and publication are aimed at professors, researche·rs and graduate students who are doing research on public opinion. 
Kim, who is from South Korea, wanted to examine how the mass media influences the population's opinion on Sunshine, a controver­sial government reunification policy. 
"These two countries have been separated for more than 50 years," he said. "We wanted to see how South Koreans viewed North Koreans, which is important to gov­ernment policy." 
To research this topic, Kim worked with Miejeong Han, a pro­fessor at Hanyang University in Anyang and friend since their PhD studies at Cornell. 
The two studied the South Korean news media and how it played a role in shaping people's opinions. 
"My contact in Korea collected data in a small city like South Bend, with a population of 500,000. It was a telephone survey of 443 resi­dents." 
There were several key findings. 
"We found that the media, in gen­eral, were in favor of this public policy. People infer public opinion from mass media, and the people see the public opinion as in favor," Kim said. "People, in general, are really concerned about how people think about this issue, and their perceptions influence their political behaviors." 
A good example of this, Kim said, is the American view of North Korea. The general tone of the med!a coverage can sway a popula­tion if they are led to believe that others are also in favor. 
"Even in the U.S., North Korea is becoming the next big thing. If the American media portrays North Korea in a very negative light, then people will believe that the American public is very negative about North Korea," said Kim. "If American media keeps portraying North Korea in a very negative light, there will be positive support for military action in North Korea." 
There are two current views held by South Koreans, Kim said. One is to see North Korea as an enemy. The other is to be sympathetic to their northern neighbor, viewing them as family and friends who need South Korea's help.

gist, some of her friends and a Saint Mary's professor. The woman, who was a freshman at the time, said the incident that occurred March 22, 2001 was so traumatic that she transferred from Saint Mary's to a university closer to her Pittsburgh home and that on the first anniversary of the incident she overdosed on antide­pressants. 
When Jefferson questioned the woman on cross-examination why she had not pressed charges, she responded she was traumatized when she went to Memorial Hospital on March 22, 2001 and was scared she would lose her scholarship because she had been drinking underage. Evidence col­lected at the hospital was not saved, she said. 
Jefferson testified Tuesday, and he did not call any defense wit­nesses. The jury's verdict comes following a two-and-a-half-year process, during which Jefferson

failed to appear at multiple court proceedings and nipeatedly did not cooperate with his own attorneys and the plaintitrs attorneys. His most recent attorney withdrew himself from the case in October 2002 because he was unable to contact Jefferson once he returned to Texas and claimed Jefferson was uncooperative. 
The civil trial was supposed to begin Jan. 21, 2003 but was delayed when Jefferson, who had missed several other court appear­ances, unexpectedly appeared in court. Judge Jenny Pitts Manier, who had not called a jury because she did not think Jefferson would appear, then denied the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and recused herself from the case. Before recusing herself, Manier had withdrawn most of the requests for admissions that Jefferson had failed to respond to in November 2002. Failure to respond is considered an admis­sion of guilt.

Israelis poised for prisoner swap 
JEHUSALEM -Israel's defense minister said Tuesday the government had no inten­tion of releasing a jailed Palestinian uprising leader, but that progress was being made toward a prisoner swap with Lebanese guer­rillas. 
Freeing Marwan Barghouti, considered a poll~ntial successor to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, could help get the stalled U.S.­hacked "road map" peace plan back on track. 
A Palestinian source close to the talks said Monday the emerging deal would include Barghouti, who is on trial in Israel for his alleged role in terror attacks that killed 26 lsnwlis. The idea of his release would trigger tough resistance from hard-liners in the Israeli government. 
Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz said Barghouti was not likely to be part of a deal to exchange Arab prisoners, including Palestinians, for Israeli businessman 1\lhanan Tannenbaum and the bodies of three Israeli soldiers kidnapped by llezbollah in 2000. 
"We have no intention of releasing Barghouti," Mofaz said. adding that the num­bers and names being mentioned are not correct. Palestinian and llezbollah oflicials say Israel would free about 400 Arab prison­ers. inducting at least 200 Palestinians.

Laborers Union endorses Gephardt 
WASIIINGTON -Dick Gephardt picked up his 14th union endorsement for the Democratic presidential nomination when leaders of the Laborers International Union of North America decided Tuesday to back the Missouri Democrat. 
"Dick has been there for us for 27 years," said Terry O'Sullivan, president of the Laborers Union. which reported 322,000 dues-paying members last year. "His tenure in Congress has been defined by his commit­ment to working men and women, to work­ing families, and I think the vote today is a recognition of that." 
On Wednesday, however, the International Association of Fire Fighters was poised to become the first national union to break publicly with Gephardt, giving its endorse­ment instead to Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry after a vote of its leaders. 
The Laborers' decision in favor of Gephardt came after a survey of about 1,000 union leaders attending a conference in Chicago.

"Do We Face a 'Clash of Civilizations?"' a topic tentatively breeched in the first panel, was further explored in the second. All three speakers found Huntington's thesis that the source of most major conflicts today can be traced to fault lines between civilizations far too vague and limited in application. 
"[Huntington's theory is] over­simplistic, and in some cases, just wrong," said Kathleen Collins. professor of Political Science. 
Senior Terence Fitzgibbons used his experience studying abroad in Cairo to debunk the thesis, while political science pro­fessor Michael Francis attributed international conflicts to power politics, not clashes between civi­lizations.

Storin said that University policy does not permit the endorsement of political candi­dates, and Notre Dame will panel was made up of Middle East Studies and theology profes­sor Joseph Amar and theology professor Paul Franks. 

Amar argued that the clash the­ory overlooks commonality and that dialogue between conflicting groups creates trust, respect, and foundation for coexistence. Franks, drawing upon his own Jewish devotion, said that recent Jewish-Christian dialogue has fos­tered a veritable revolution of feeling between the two groups. 
"Interfaith dialogue is between individuals ... and individuals can transform communities," he said.

FDA stiffens BSE-related guidelines 
WASIIINGTON -The government is work­
ing on expanding its ban against brains and 
spinal tissue in cattle feed to include food for 
dogs, cats. pigs and poultry. 
Stephen Sundlof, director of the Center for 
Veterinary Medicine at the Food and Drug 
Administration, said Tuesday the agency 
wants to prevent animal diseases from being 
passed unto consumers and other animals. It 
will probably write new regulations, one of 
which could require companies that slaughter 
"downer" livestock -animals that are sick or 
injured -to dispose of the brain and spinal 
cord before mixing animal feed and pet food, 
he said. 
The government already bans animal feeds 
made with spinal and brain tissue from being 
fed to sheep, goats and cattle -a safeguard 
against the spread of diseases like "mad cow 
disease" or BSE. But the tissue can be mixed 
into pet food and feed for pigs or poultry. 
The FDA is working with slaughterhouses 
and animal feed companies to come up with a 
plan by 2007 to prevent high-risk materials 
like spinal tissue from ending up in feed. 
Local parts companies face layoffs 
GARY, Ind. -The push to pressure the Bush administration to maintain tariffs on steel imports drew thousands of steelworkers and their supporters to a rally in one of the industry's key centers. 
Many who gathered Saturday in the city's 
baseball stadium -known as the U.S. Steel 
Yard -carried signs that urged Bush to con­
tinue the tariffs. 
"This is important to our livelihood," said 
steelworker Karen Fleming of LaPorte. "The 
end of tariffs would cause a downward spiral 
in the steel industry just when things are 
starting to turn around and get better." 
Northwestern Indiana is the site of several 
large steel mills-including ones owned U.S. 
Steel, International Steel Group and !spat 
Inland -and many have blamed cheaper for­
eign steel imports for bankruptcies and lay­
offs in the U.S. steel industry. 
Gary Mayor Scott King told the crowd that 
the federal government should be just as con­
cerned with the security of domestic industry 
as keeping the borders secure from terrorism. 






Iraq's role in OPEC questioned 
Associated Press 
VIENNA, Austria ­OPEC members struggled Tuesday to prevent a dis­pute over Iraq's participa­tion in their oil policy talks from causing a damaging rift and impeding their plan to set production tar­gets for the coming months. 
Cartel members, exclud­ing Iraq. failed to resolve an impasse between Venezuela and Iraq during a late Tuesday meeting, OPEC sources said. The 10 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries heard Venezuela's position that Iraq, a cartel founding member, should not attend the group's formal meeting Wednesday because its government has no U.N. recognition. 
Iraq is attending OPEC talks for the first time since the toppling of Saddam Hussein, and its presence was seen as a sign of grow­ing international accept­ance of its U.S.-backed interim government. 

However, Venezuela's minister of energy and mines, Rafael Ramirez, said Iraq could only attend on an informal basis.

Firefighters union to endorse Sen. Kerry 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry is the first Democrat to get a national union endorsement other than Dick Gephardt, who now has 14. 
The International Association of Fire Fighters planned to endorse Kerry on Wednesday after a vote of union leaders. 
The union, which reported 214,000 dues-paying members last year, likes Kerry's record as a decorated Vietnam War veteran; his political, legal and legislative experience; his sense of humor; and his per­sonal interests in athletics and Harley-Davidsons, union President Harold Schaitberger said. 
"He is a proven leader," Schaitberger stated in remarks prepared for Wednesday. "He knows how to navigate Washington. He learned the hard· way in Vietnam, in the courtroom and. in the halls of the U.S. Senate." 
Late entrant Wesley Clark has four-star credentials, but lacks political and legislative experience, said Schaitberger, who spent a couple of hours at breakfast with the retired gen­eral several weeks ago, along with other union presidents. 
"You've got to know how to navigate and operate in Washington, D.C., to be a good president and to be an effective executive," he said. "I question Wesley Clark's experience, and John Kerry clearly has that experience." 
Gephardt is a longtime ally of organized labor, yet some pub­lic and service sector unions are hesitant to embrace his second run for the White House. 
The firefighters union want­ed to support a candidate who can beat President Bush next year. "Our view is that Dick Gephardt is not the candidate who has that best chance," Schaitberger said. 
After a disappointing show­ing in fund raising, Gephardt's third-quarter results, out Sept. 30, will be a key indication of whether he can win enough support for a laborwide endorsement from the AFL­CIO. 
President John Sweeney is expected to call a general board meeting around Oct. 15 to consider an endorsement, which requires support from unions representing two-thirds of the federation's 13 million members.

Democratic sena­tor from West Virginia since the Eisenhower administration, complained that he had never been treated with such discourtesy as he had been at a hearing on Bush's spending request. 
That was the environment awaiting Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and two top generals who were scheduled to appear Wednesday before the Senate Appropriations Committee to defend Bush's spending request. Separately, Bremer was to appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
The mood was a striking change from last year. Bush was soaring in opinion polls, and. with midterm elections approaching. Democrats were Bush's "pow­
erful and con­vincing indictment" of the Iraqi leader. 
After Bush's speech Tuesday at the United Nations, Daschle -now minority leader -said Bush "lost an opportunity" to make he case for more interna­tional troops and resources. 
Lieberman -now a presi­dential candidate-said Bush's "11th-hour, halfhearted appeal to the United Nations, and his continuing 1-told-you-so tone, have made it more difficult to secure international assis­tance." 
Much has changed in a year. Opinion polls show rising doubts about Bush's Iraq poli­cies. Lawmakers do not face re­election this year. And criticiz­ing the aftermath of a war isn't as risky as criticizing the war itself. 
With the $87 billion request coming on top of a $79 billion package approved in April. Democrats argue that Bush woefully underestimated the costs of the war, the difficulty of rebuilding Iraq and the amount of international help available. 
But many Democrats acknowledge that the $87 bil­lion request likely will be approved. They say they can't deny the money that the Pentagon says is needed for 
U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Daschle said Tuesday he doubts most senators will sup­port the $20.3 billion part of the request that is for Iraqi reconstruction. But he said it is not clear whether that money may be considered separately. Republicans, who control both Houses, adamantly oppose splitting the bill. 
But if Democrats' actions are limited, their words are not. They are lashing out at the administration, in public and in private. 
Bremer received a harsh reception from Senate Democrats during a closed­door meeting with them Tuesday. When he began com­paring the current situation to the German defeat in World War II, Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D­W.Va., asked him to discuss Iraq, not world history, accord­ing to one senator present. 
"It was a maelstrom," said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who described the session. 
While the Democratic seua­tors usually applaud visitors to their weekly meeting, Bremer left to silence, Harkin said.

McGillan, Gorman join ND 
Two set to assume newly created positions in the Development Dept. 
Special to The Observer 
Mary Ellen McGillan, most recently assistant vice presi­dent for development at Santa Clara University, and Jean Gorman, vice president for development at the Scripps Foundation for Medicine and Science in LaJolla, Calif. have been appointed to newly cre­ated positions in the Department of Development at Notre Dame. 
McGillan will serve as assis­tant vice president for devel­opment and director of nation­al programs, with responsibil­ity for foundation and corpo­rate relations, the annual fund, communications and advancement of the Notre Dame Law School, Mendoza College of Business, new DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts and athletic department. McGillan assumes her duties Sept. 2. 
Gorman has been appointed senior director of planned giv­ing and development research with oversight for planned giv­ing, research activities and training the major gifts staff. 
She will join the University on Sept. 29. 
Both positions were created this summer following two major promotions. Daniel Heagan, formerly assistant vice president for University relations and executive direc­tor of development, was appointed associate vice presi­dent for University relations and executive director for principal gifts and campaign administration, and Timothy Rippinger was promoted from director of development oper­ations to assistant vice presi­dent for development and director of leadership gifts. 
McGillan brings to Notre Dame more than 20 years of board fund-raising experi­ence. In addition to Santa Clara, she has held senior development positions at Belmont Abbey College in Belmont, N.C., the Horticultural Research Institute in Washington D.C., the American Diabetes Association and the American Cancer Society. 
An active leader with the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education (CASE), McGillan will serve as co-chair of philanthropy at the western regional CASE confer­ence this year. She also previ­ously served in the same posi­tion for all Jesuit colleges and universities. 
McGillan earned her bache­lor's degree in sociology from Belmont Abbey. 
Considered one of the coun­try's leading planned giving experts, Gorman has served as the vice president for develop­ment at Scripps College and has worked in development at the University of California, San Diego, the University of Portland and St. Mary's Hospital in Grand Rapids, Mich., in addition to the Scripps Foundation. 
A graduate of Saint Mary's College and Notre Dame Law School, she served for five years as director of financial aid at Saint Mary's and was an assistant rector of Farley Hall at Notre Dame for three years. 
Gorman earned a master's degree in education, college counseling and administration from Northwestern University. 

IRAQ 



Council bans two Arab news stations 
Associated Press 

BAGHDAD, Iraq -Iraq's U.S.-appointed Governing Council on Tuesday barred journalists from two leading Arab satellite news channels from government buildings and press conferences. 
The council said the two­week ban was imposed on Al­Jazeera and Al-Arabiya ­two of the most popular tele­vision news stations in the Middle East -because it sus­pected the stations had violat­ed rules that include not dis­closing information about pending attacks on American troops. 
A spokesman for Ahmad Chalabi, the current Governing Council president, accused the stations of "incit­ing violence" against U.S.-Jed coalition forces and Iraqi offi­cials. 
"We hope other channels will draw a Jesson from this decision," spokesman Entifadh Qanbar said. 
AI-Jazeera spokesman Jihad Bailout said the station regretted the council decision but "will continue our work as usual until we are officially notified" of it, according to Al­Jazeera's Web site. 
Reaction from Al-Arabiya was not immediately avail­able. 
Qanbar did not elaborate on what the two stations had done, and the council state­ment did not mention any specific allegations against the two Arabic broadcasters. 
Both channels have in the past broadcast audio tapes and statements purported to be from Saddam Hussein and footage showing alleged resistance fighters vowing to continue attacks on U.S. troops. 
"We will not let them broad­cast footage of U.S. soldiers being ripped apart," Qanbar told reporters, adding that the two channels could be fined. 
He called the council decree "a positive step to protect the Iraqi people from the poisons being broadcast by the chan­nels." 
Under rules listed in the council's statement Tuesday, Iraqi and foreign media are prohibited from inciting vio­lence or "chaos" or promoting the return of Saddam's Baath party. All news organizations are required to inform authorities if they learn of any information concerning ter­rorist activities.

Bon Jovi starts AFL team 
Associated Press 
PHilADELPHIA -Rock star -and football fan -Jon Bon Jovi is now co-owner of the Philadelphia Soul, an Arena Football League expansion team. 
''I'm a football fanatic. I love football, always have," the New Jersey native said Monday. "It's the only sport I really live and breathe." 
His partner is real estate developer Craig A. Spencer. whose properties include the five-star Ritz-Carlton in Philadelphia, where Bon Jovi spoke about his lifelong love of football and his plans for the Soul. 
The announcement was made Monday. The Soul will begin play next season in the Wachovia Center and Wachovia Spectrum. 
Bon Jovi had to overcome skepticism among league exec­utives when he first approached them earlier this year about owning an AFL franchise. 
Arena League commissioner David Baker said he quickly impressed with his business acumen, work ethic and knowl­edge of the game. 
"We're driving on our way to a concert and he's asking me about the emergency quarter­back rule. Nobody ever asks me about the emergency quarter­back rule," said Baker. 
Bon Jovi, whose hits include "You Give Love a Bad Name" and "It's My Life," said he'll hold a private performance for season ticket-holders. But that's all the singing he's planning to do -at least for now. 
''I'm not going to be the half­time entertainment," the 41­year-old rocker said. ''I'm going to sit in the owners' box." 
The Soul becomes the 18th team in the Arena Football League and the second expan­sion team announced this year, following the New Orleans VooDoo in May. A 19th team. in Austin, Texas, is also expected to enter the league next season. 
Baker declined to put a price tag on the Soul. 
Philadelphia has a glut of professional sports teams, but Bon Jovi and Spencer said they're not worried about put­ting fans in the seats.

But the figure remains on the field, undeterred by the torrential down­pour or the chill given by soaked clothing. Fundamentals that have been practiced hundreds of times seem to hold new importance now, 
· each one done by heart in the blind­ing rain. They are done meticulously, precisely, but without fear. The legs churn, the arms pump and the eyes remain focused-pushing, pulling, prodding for more in the slop of the muddy field. For every mistake that is made, the exercise is done cor­rectly 10 times more. No mistakes are tolerated. Now the dreariness of the late spring evening is fading into com­plete and utter darkness, and the fatigue of hours spent on the soggy field begin to show in the body lan­guage. But only the sagging shoul­ders and hands on hips illustrate the weariness, sweat having lost all dis­tinction to the pouring rain. The movements are not quite as sharp, and the eyes have glazed over, mak­ing the mistakes snowball. But the dark silhouette keeps on, more determined to find the perfection that has not been reached, the time not yet achieved, the perfect 10 never attained. Only then does the figure fall, remaining motionless in the mud for seconds, seemingly like minutes, and time stops. It is the desperate groping for something more. The mindless 
screaming in the inner soul that urges, that expects more, that is confident in the abilities not yet shown. It is the burning torment of defeat when an opponent celebrates a victory and the empty satisfaction of victory, knowing that you still have not shown the world your best. There is no substitute for it. It is only black and white. You either have it or you do not. Some teams have it and some teams do not. It is for the love of the game.

It cannot be taught but it never leaves. It is the intangible that coaches preach and dream about but can never duplicate because it lies in a place that they can not touch. Away from all the scoreboards and shoes, contracts and television cam­eras, it is some place deeper. It fol­lows an athlete into every aspect of life-jobs, family, company softball games -nothing is done with reserve. But like a sleeping volcano or a warrior retired to the solitudes of a farm, passion can lay dormant for years. The will to overcome and conquer can fade if something is not worthy of the absolute effort needed. 
It is why men and women who have donned high school and college jerseys decades ago still talk about the glory days. If a horse retires from the track, does it mean it still does not love to run? It haunts them just as much as it drives. It is why they push their children to be better than them, why they will not accept anything other than 110 percent. They want that feeling again -the knowledge and quiet satisfaction that comes with doing more before breakfast than most of the popula­tion does all week.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Spirit lacking in Notre Dame marching band 
Wednesday. Seprember 24, 2003 
LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Recognize and respond to inequality 
Few recognize that right beyond the walls of our campus are children who are starving, LLc.;ing pacifiers to battle bouts of hunger, children without pillows to sleep on, children watching their mothers get arrested on the front lawn and children wit­nessing murders as they walk out their front door. Few recognize that as we sit, complaining about homework, there is a child trying to read who can't concentrate because they haven't eaten today or a child who can't all'ord school supplies to even attempt their work. And fmally, few recognize that these are not exaggerations, but arc the realities of growing up in poverty in South Bend. 
This problem is not unique to South Bend, it plagues countless cities throughout the United States and the world. In Baltimore the drop out rate is 70 percent at some high schools. On average, children attending public schools in the inner city are three grade levels below their suburban peers. I can cite statistic after statistic to illustrate the disgusting inequity that exists, but l don't feel it is necessary nor yields action. 
Hather, I am going to ask each and every one of you to think of what role you could play in closing this disturbing gap. Many of you already tutor in the community and arc making an impact right now. Some of you reading this have the talents and drive to participate in programs like Teach for America and the Alliance for Catholic Educatior:t and immediately make an impact after graduation. Some of you may one day light to forever change educational inequity, and some of you, at the least, will remember these gross inequities and be sympathetic to the situation. 
For most of us this is not our story, we cannot directly relate, and sometimes we don't want to believe. But it is the truth, and we are the only ones who can make a difference. If you arc not willing to take action, how can you expect a seven year-old with no food and a shattered household to believe in his future. 
Kristen McCaffiey senior off-campus Sept. 23 



Blame ignorance for lack of diversity 
Deka Motanya's Sept. 22 letter addressed the stark lack of diversity on campus. The deficiency of minorities on campus is obviously an unfortunate situation; how­ever, attributing the lack of diversity to people not attending the president of Nigeria's speech is asinine. Furthermore, counting on "students drastically chang­ing their mentalities" to bring more diversity to the school plays into every stereo­typical portrayal of minority students. It fosters the idea that the reason more minorities aren't attending prestigious private schools is because the minorities themselves have done something wrong. 
The reason that more minorities are not on campus has nothing to do with the attendance of speeches and everything to do with the lopsided politics that we, as Americans, deal with on a daily basis. When the Federal Housing Administration was created, the government made it difficult if not impossible for minorities to get loans for homes. No loans translated into no equity and no equity translate into no borrowing power for minorities, which greatly all'ected minorities abilities to send their children to good schools. Perhaps this happened before most of us were born, but the effects remain today. Despite the University's ell'ort to recruit students, the sociological, economical and political boundaries keep many minorities at home. 
Motanya was correct in one respect-diversity does need to be promoted on campus. There have simply been too many times that I have heard racial slurs, especially directed at the field during football games. Ignorance amongst the gen­eral populace is the culprit for the lack of diversity, ascribing the monotonous nature of the University to anything else is oversimplifying matters, and is ignoring the real problems that face us today.

Finally and most importantly, when the team came out of the tunnel before the second half, they were greeted only by the cheers of the student body and not the Notre Dame Victory March. This silence continued, as the band played nothing during much of the third quarter.

ALBUM REVIEW 

Dave Matthews flies solo 
By EMILY TUM BRINK 
Assistant Scene Editor 
Dave Matthews' much-anticipated solo release, Some Devil, contains 14 original tracks, with Matthews' vocals and lyrics taking center stage on each. Though he collaborated with many guest artists during the production of the album, including Trey Anastasio of Phish, the Dirty Dozen Brass Band and guitarist Tim Reynolds, Matthews' songs definitely possess a softer and more intimate feel than any performed by the Dave Matthews Band. Whereas most popular Dave Matthews Band songs would be characterized as rous­ing, energetic and jam-centered (think "Tripping Billies," "Lie in Our Graves" or "Two Step"), Some Devil possesses a more subdued and blues-influenced sound. Many of the tracks are soft and meandering, and most would never be categorized in the jam band genre. 
Two of the tracks on Some Devil may be familiar to fans of the Dave Matthews Band. "Gravedigger," the first single from the album (a different acoustic version is also includ­ed). has been performed by the Dave Matthews Band dur­ing their regular touring schedule but has never been officially released on any of the band's albums. "An' Another Thing," perhaps one of the most unusual tracks on Some Devil, possesses a strik­ing resemblance to the song "Little Thing" from the Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds' release Live at Luther College, but with the addition of strings and percussion. Matthews' haunting vocals on this track seem spontaneously concocted and manage to cap­tivatingly convey his emotion through mere sounds rather than actual words. 


ALBUM REVIEW 

Boyd Tinsley abandons his violin 
By EMILY TUMBRINK 
Assistant Scene Editor 
Boyd Tinsley, well known for his con­tributions as the violinist for the Dave Matthews Band. became the first mem­ber of the band to release a solo album on June 17. 2003, beating Dave Matthews by a matter of months. 
True Reflections, the title of Tinsley's album, was named after a song he wrote in the 1990s that has now become a con­cert staple of the Dave Matthews Band, though it has never been released on a studio album. Tinsley has included this song on his own album. with Dave Matthews providing back-up vocals just as he does during live performances of the song. However, listeners expecting other aspects of Tinsley's album to be comparable to the work he does for the 
True Reflections Boyd Tinsley 
RCA Records 

Dave Matthews Band will be disappoint­ed by his solo release. 
Tinsley. trained as a classical violinist, neglects to showcase his greatest talent on True Reflections. Listed as providing the lead violin on only four of 11 tracks, Tinsley instead focuses his energy on songwriting and providing vocals, two things at which he is not very skilled. Tinsley's voice is not very strong, and his lyrics are even weaker. Though it must be said that the lyrics of the well-known song "True Reflections" are cliched, these lyrics seem far deeper than any of the other song lyrics included on this album. 
"All the lyrics were written after think­ing about what's important in life, what I appreciate about life. So the songs are basically about love and relationships," Tinsley told VHl. 
Unfortunately, Tinsley does not provide 

Most of the songs on 
Some Devil 
have a much darker tone than we are used to hear­ing from Matthews. Through the use of spare electric guitar melodies that often mirror the sound of Matthews' unusual voice modulations, "Some Devil," the title track, succeeds in cre­ating a mellow and haunting sound. "Too High" utilizes the Seattlemusic Group, an orchestra, on strings and horns, further increasing the overall drama. Though "Trouble" may sound like an uplifting song, its title and lyrics reveal otherwise. 
There are, however, some positive, upbeat songs on Some Devil. "So Damn Lucky," one of the most conventionally "Dave" songs on the album. contains an optimistic message paired with an upbeat melody. 
Apparently, Matthews' main motiva­tion for releasing a solo album was to have an outlet for the songs he has written that do not quite fit with the Dave Matthews Band style. 
"I hadn't really been thinking about doing a solo album until I had a hand­ful of songs that didn't really fit with the band, so I started with those and it just grew into a full record," Matthews told MTV. "I kind of thought it'd be fun to put it out." 

Fittingly. it is nearly impossible to envision most of the songs included on Some Devil being played by the Dave Matthews Band. The stylistic differ­ences between Matthews' solo work and that of the Dave Matthews Band are striking, making the influence of the other band members on the overall sound quite apparent. Some Devil shows a side of Matthews that would never have been revealed in his normal working environment, and by straying from his traditional formula, he is able to prove to listeners that he is capable of creating a new and unique sound.

any interest­ing insights into these common lyri­cal themes. Perhaps the best example of this comes on the cringe­worthy track titled "Perfect World," which Tinsley says was written for his two chil­dren as an attempt to explain the concept of war. Alas, Tinsley's treatment of this serious theme will leave even children say­ing "duh" by the end of the track. With lyrics like "It's not a perfect world, I I don't want to lie. I Sometimes it makes me laugh, I Sometimes it makes me cry. I I'm beginning to wonder why, I I won't tell no lies. I I just don't know why. I No matter how I try, I I wonder why," "Perfect World" is so completely unin­spiring that it leaves listeners wondering why Tinsley ever thought he was a song­writer. 
Although it is admirable that Tinsley had the courage to release his own material knowing that it would be com­pared to the work of the ever-popular Dave Matthews Band, this album might have been better left unreleased. Tinsley should have focused more on what he is good at, namely playing a mean fiddle, instead of trying to fit the role of singer/songwriter. By relying on a slew of guest artists to provide the instrumen­tation, Tinsley completely misses what should have been the point of his album. Hopefully, Tinsley will realize where his talents lie and release an amazing instrumental album, one that can redeem his listeners' opinion of him.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Nappy Roots still country and proud of it 
By KENYATTA STORIN 
Scene Music Critic 
Last year. Kentucky-based Nappy Hoots' major-label debut, Watermelon, Chicken and Gritz. was a pleasant surprise to the rap world. providing a fresh, lighthearted brand of Dirty South rap. Thanks to the hit single, "Awnaw," good. down-home production. catchy hooks. fast paced lyrics and an overall good-time country feeling. the album went platinum. 
In a genre known for short-lived careers. however. there was no guarantee that the sextet could duplicate this suc­cess in their sophomore release. Despite all the positives. the album ran a little long. their lyrics were sometimes bland and tracks seemed to blur together after awhile. Thankfully. the group avoids the "sophomore slump" by improving upon

"Who would have guessed?" is exactly the qunstion that races through one's mind while listening to the new Christian rock band Sky !!arbor. 
In its first album. Who Would Have Guessed, the band continually keeps listen­ers guessing about what could possibly be coming next as the album plays. The punk/garage rock band's music varies from that of strong guitar riffs and heavy their original formula in the entertaining 
Wooden Leather. 
Although they've tasted success, the rap unit has not forgotten its country roots. Individually. the rappers are arguably average at best, but together the six eJTectively work off each other's contrast­ing 11ows and voices. On their first single, "Houn' the Globe," they rap about every­one's inner Southerner with the sing along chorus. "The whole damn world is country I Been all around the globe from Monday to Sunday I Y'all the same folk we see in Kentucky," over a mellow, upbeat production juiced with hand claps and acoustic guitars. "Nappy Roots Day," a reference to the group being honored by Kentucky Governor Paul E. Patton with "Nappy Roots Day" on Sept. 16, 2002, is another highlight, combining a piano melody with female vocals for a soothing sound.

The album title itself is drawn from "A Case for Christianity" by C.S. Lewis. who argued that the best thing about Christianity is that no one would have guessed it to be true, but it is that fact which makes it true.

Wooden Leather is not littered 


with guest appearances, but the few that do appear supply quality assistance. Vocalist Anthony Hamilton contributes on "Push On," one of the more emotional tracks, and R&B singer Raphael Saadiq provides some good production on "Leave This Morning." · 
Unfortunately. Wooden Leather is not without its missteps. possessing the same problem as its predecessor by continuing for too long. Clocking in at just under 70 minutes, even with six rappers the group does not have the creativity to sufficiently maintain such a lengthy endeavor. Tracks such as "Lac Dogs & Hogs," "1\vang" and "Roll Again" sometimes have their moments but often leave the sextet appearing very ordinary and generic. The Lil' Jon-produced "What Cha Gonna Do?'' has a catchy trumpet blaring beat, but it could very well be confused with any number of Cash Money songs. The group's attempt at rap-rock, "War/Peace," has good production. but possesses a lackluster chorus of "War! Peace! Come on Nappy!" and probably could have been left ofT the album, as well. 

Wooden Leather may not be deepest rap album out there, but it's still enter­taining and unique in its own right. Unlike other pop Southern rappers, like Nelly and Big Tymers. who only rap about their riches, Nappy Roots have not let success go to their heads and. have man­aged to stay true to themselves. Their lyrics may not turn any heads, but the group mixes things up well. and every now and then they produce a gem. However. their main strength remains in the catchiness of their music, for it only takes a few listens before one finds him­self humming Wooden Leather for the rest of the day. You may have missed Nappy Roots Day this year, but be sure not to forget it next year.

ALBUM REVIEW 

Sky Harbor updates Christian rock 


deep messages such as the one found in the title of the album. The current single, "In Stereo" is an upbeat rock song with strong drums accompanied by quick yet heavy guitar rifts. The song talks about the revolution of Christian music through punchy and clever lines like. "It's a culture revolution fueled by noise pollution I Funny-looking kids are offering solutions." As "In Stereo" continues, it moves to a challenging tone, pointedly singing. "And everybody's praying I While sitting on their hands." The song is probably the strongest on the album in both message and music. 
The rock songs throughout the album are generally very strong. and the best tracks, such as "Welcome" and "Day at the Beach," carry weaker songs like "Identity" and "Not Gonna Change." While all of the rock songs on the album are unique and individual. high-quality tracks such as "In Stereo," "Welcome" and "Day at the Beach" really stand out as terrific songs. 
A huge strength of the album is the three out of 10 songs that are of a lighter rock nature. "What If I Doubt," one of the best songs on the album, is light acoustic mixed 
-
with rock and an upbeat rhythm behind it. The song confronts the issue of doubt in Christianity, asking, "What if I doubt? I What if I question things my life has been about? I Will you turn your back on me?" As one of the strongest songs on the album. the melody stays with the listener. 
Likewise, "Who Needs A Girl" is also a softer song on the album. The song, about a boy needing a girl to "miss when he's away" extends larger into the metaphor of the human need for connection. As one could probably guess, by the end of the song "Everyone needs someone to miss when we're away," just as the boy needs a girl. 
Sky Harbor's Who Would 1/ave Guessed is an energetic mix of heavy rock and lighter guitar that makes for a terrific album. Enjoyable for any age and any type of person. the debut album is the perfect recording for anyone who, just as the title hints, may not have initially guessed the band's talent and appeal.

MLB 



Yankees clinch sixth straight division title with win 

Associated Press 
CHICAGO-The New York Yankees' playoff party was rock­ing even before they left the field. 
Jason Giambi hit a grand slam in the ninth inning, and Jose Contreras struck out a career­high nine Tuesday night as the Yankees clinched their sixth straight AL East title with a 7-0 victory over the Chicago White Sox. 
Nick Johnson and Juan Rivera hit solo homers, and Hideki Matsui drove in his 106th RBI for the Yankees, who are live games ahead of second-place Boston with five games left. 
"The guys in this room under­stand how hard it is to get here, especially when everybody in the league guns for you every year because they know that you're going to have a good team," Giambi said. "By no means was anybody feeling sorry for us when Jeter went down and Bernie [Williams] went down and Nick Johnson." 


"That's what's gratifying. We still all came together as a ball­club and ended up winning the division with all those guys going down." 
The loss was doubly disap­pointing for the White Sox, who were eliminated from postseason play. Minnesota beat Cleveland 4-1 earlier Tuesday and lead the White Sox by six games with live to play. 
The White Sox had a two-game lead in the AL Central just two weeks ago. Since then, they've lost nine of 13. 
"I always held out hope," White Sox manager Jerry Manuel said. "Hegardless of what the numbers were I always held out hope we could get it done. Baseball is a funny game, but we just didn't get it done." 
White Sox fans already were disgruntled with their team's late collapse, and Tuesday night's rout didn't help their mood. By the eighth inning, they were more interested in doing "The Wave" than watching the team lose another game. 
When Mariano Rivera got the last out, the Yankees ran out of their dugout, exchanging hugs and high-lives. When they got in the clubhouse, they popped open bottles of champagne, alternat­ing dousing each other with swigs of the bubbly. Their new T­shirts, which read "Six in a Row Eastern Division Champions," were quickly soaked, but nobody minded. 
And when the champagne ran out, the Yankees grabbed beer and shaving cream. 
"This is just step one," manag­er Joe Torre said. 
Minnesota 4, Cleveland 1 
The Minnesota Twins clinched their second straight AL Central title by defeating the Cleveland Indians 4-1 Tuesday night, win­ning their 10th consecutive game as Kenny Rogers came within one out of a shutout. 
Shannon Stewart drove in two runs and Cristian Guzman went 2-for-2 with a homer and two runs. 
After the game, Minnesota had to wait 30 minutes to celebrate. The Twins' title wasn't ensured until New York defeated Chicago 7-0 and Detroit routed Kansas City 15-6, dropping the White Sox and Royals six games back with five to play. 
Hogers (13-8), probably the odd man out of the postseason rotation, rolled through a lineup stocked with eight rookies. His last shutout was a five-hitter against Seattle on April 19 last year. 
He gave up one-out singles to Jody Gerut and Alex Escobar in the ninth before Josh Bard hit a two-out single to make it 4-1. Eddie Guardado got the final out for his 40th save in 43 tries. 
Rogers gave up eight hits and struck out two. 
Guzman sparked a two-run third with a leadoff single against Jake Westbrook (7 -1 0). Stewart and Luis Hivas followed with back-to-hack HBI doubles. 
Westbrook gave up four runs -three earned -and six hits in seven innings. He walked three. 
Hogers had runners on first and third with one out in the sec­ond inning, but he picked Josh Bard off first and got Greg LaRocca to ground out.

David Ortiz won it with a solo 
shot in the 1Oth as the Boston 
Red Sox beat the Baltimore

Despite the heroics, the Hed Sox were eliminated from the AL East race when the New York Yankees beat the Chicago White ·Sox 7-0. Boston still leads the wild-card race, bringing a 2 1/2 ­game lead over Seattle into the night; the Mariners played a late 
game at Anaheim. 
Byung-Hyun Kim (8-5) earned 
the win with a scoreless ninth. 
Ortiz sent the fourth pitch from 
Kurt Ainsworth (0-1) in to the 
new seats above the Green 
Monster as the crowd erupted.

homer in the second, and 
Baltimore scored two more in 
the ninth to extend its lead to 5­
2. 
But with Jorge Julio on and 
one out in the ninth, pinch-hitter 
Jason Varitek singled and took 
second on a passed ball. Johnny 
Damon bounced out to second 
base, then Nomar Garciaparra 
walked and took second. 
Walker hit Julio's 3-2 pitch into 
the Baltimore bullpen to tie it. 
On Aug. 10, Julio's previous 
appearance in Boston, he walked 
the bases loaded before striking 
out Garciaparra on a pitch in the 
dirt to preserve Baltimore's vic­
tory. On Tuesday, he got Bill 
Mueller, the leading hitter in the 
league, to line out in the eighth 
to protect Baltimore's 3-2 lead. 
The Orioles made it 5-2 when 
Brian Hoberts doubled and 
scored on Jay Gibbons' single. 
Larry Bigbie, who had been 
intentionally walked, scored to 
make it 5-2 when right fielder 
Gabe Kapler couldn't field the 
ball cleanly. 
Toronto 8, Tampa Bay S 
The Toronto Blue Jays and 
Tampa Bay Devil Hays tried to be 
diplomatic after several run-ins 
on and off the field. 
Not anymore. 
Toronto's starting pitcher was 
ejected for the second straight

School has started and you have books to read, papers to write and projects to complete. All of these things are done with the ultimate goal of obtaining 
enough credit to graduate, get a job and hopefully contribute to society. Along with the academic college experience is the "social" college experience ... 
road trips to take, social activities to participate in, Spring Break to plan. All of these items can earn you credit too ... on a piece of plastic. This "extra" 
credit can add up over time and turn one's college experience into a life-long, never~ending financial lesson. Do not learn this lesson the hard way! 
The nation's undergraduate students are carrying and using credit cards in record numbers. Over half (54%) of first year students carry a credit card. with that number vaulting to 92% in their sophomore year. (Nellie Mae, Aprii'02) The median credit card balance-where half the population have balances lower than this amount and half have balances higher-has risen to $1,770, up from $1,236 in 2000. (Nellie Mae, April '02) There has also been a 61% jump in undergraduate students who carry credit card balances between $3,000 and $7,000. (Nellie Mae, April '02) How do you avoid all of this "extra credit"? By educating yourself about the use of credit and how it can help you or harm you in your not-so-distant future. 
What is a credit card? A credit card do~s not give you more money nor does it provide you with "free" money. It simply changes the way you pay for 
things whether it be an airline ticket or a night out with friends. (studentcredit.com) 
How do credit card companies make money? First, the cardholder pays interest on the amount of money not paid off (balance) each month. For example, if you ring up a $3,000 tab for food, cds and spring break, it will take three years to pay off the balance if you pay the monthly minimum of $100 @ 10% interest, and that is assuming you do not charge another penny on your card (what are the chances of that?)! Income is also generated through assessing annual fees, late fees and fees for exceeding one's credit limit. (studentcredit.com) 
Why do I need a good credit history? Credit history is the record of the way an individual manages their debts.

Associated Press 
COLUMBUS, Ohio ­Suspended Ohio State tailback Maurice Clarett sued the NFL on Tuesday, asking a judge to throw out a league rule that prevents him from enter­ing the 2004 draft. 
The lawsuit contends the NFL rule prohibiting players from being draft­ed until they have been out of high school for three years violates antitrust law and harms competition. 
Clarett, who rushed for 1,237 yards and led Ohio State to a national cham­pionship as a freshman last season, wants U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin to declare him eligible for the 2004 draft -or require the NFL to hold a special supplemen­tal draft sooner. 

Under current rules, he is not eligible for the draft until 2005. 
"Had Clarett been eligi­ble for the 2003 Draft, it is almost certain he would have been selected in the beginning of the First Round and would have agreed to a contract and signing bonus worth millions of dollars," according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in New York. 
The NFL says it will fight any challenge to the rule it adopted in 1990 because coaches and executives believe younger players aren't physically ready for the league. 
"We do not believe that this lawsuit serves the best interests of Maurice Clarett or college football players generally, but we look forward to explain­ing to the court both the very sound reasons underlying our eligibility rule and the legal impedi­ments to the claim that was filed," NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said. 
Football is the only sport with a draft that doesn't allow teams to select players when their high school eligibility is finished. 
Clarett was suspended from the team for at least a year after an investiga­tion determined he broke NCAA bylaws concerning benefits for athletes and lied to investigators. 
His attorney, Alan Milstein, filed the lawsuit against the NFL a day after he and Clarett's mother met with league executives in Washington to discuss whether Clarett would be eligible for the April 24 draft.

Samardzija hopes to be t-wo-sport star 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 
Freshman receiver Jeff Samardzija has impressed the football coaching staff with his performance in practice so much that he has earned a regular spot in the rotation on game days. 
In the spring, Samardzija hopes he can do the same for the baseball team. 
A football, baseball and bas­ketball standout athlete at Valparaiso High School in Indiana, Samardzija figured he would have to give up baseball when he went to college. But when baseball coach Paul Mainieri learned Samardzija, a pitcher and an outfielder who batted .481 with eight homers and 50 RBis in high school, still wanted to play baseball, he approached football coach Tyrone Willingham about the prospect of Samardzija playing baseball. Willingham, to Samardzija's delight, said yes. 
"I was almost expecting him to say yes because he'd help your team out," Samardzija said. "That's the kind of player he is. Words can't say enough about the kind of person he is and how he runs his system." 
For now, though, Samardzija is focused on football. He entered fall camp unsure of how much he would be able to contribute, but a week before Notre Dame's season opener against Washington State, "everything just clicked," Samardzija said. In each of Notre Dame's three games, Samardzija has caught one pass. 
"He has not.been intimidated by any means," Willingham said. "He's jumped right in, he's made catches and he's been an active blocker and has understood a variety of positions that he's been placed in on our different forma­tions." 
Firing the shotgun 
Playing in place of injured cen­ter Bob Morton, Zach Giles 
couldn't snap a ball out of the shotgun to save his life. And Tuesday, he ripped him­self for it. 
"I don't know when it became an issue for me; it never hap­pened all through camp and I caught the bug last week, I guess. It was the most frustrat­ing thing watching that tape, I worked so hard on it last week. 
"It's ridiculous. The quarter­back needs the ball, and I have to get it to him." 
Giles said he took 250 extra practice shotgun snaps last week trying to hammer out early-sea­son problems, and he said he'd be willing to take 500 extra snaps to get it right this week. 
The most frustrating part, he said, is that he has no idea if a snap is good or not until he talks to the quarterback on the side­line after the play. 
"I feel like I'm putting it back on the money every time," he said. "To hear it's not, it's a real chop in the throat, it's real tough to swallow." 
Old players no excuse 
Willingham dismissed any notion that Notre Dame's 1-2 start is the result of playing with players that aren't players he recruited. 
"Those players that were listed in the previous program fit under one category for me ­they are Notre Dame football players," he said. "So in my esti­mation, they are all a part of the same system." 
The Irish coach also pointed out that the lack of execution of the new offense the coaches are trying to install is not related to the players left from the Bob Davie era. 
"Right now, no one has adjust­ed," Willingham said, later adding, "but I don't think it's necessarily because another regime recruited those individu­als. We are not executing and we are not doing the things that good offenses have to do."

Seminole quarterback Rix ticketed again 
Associated Press 
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. Florida State quarterback Chris Rix was ticketed again Tuesday for a parking violation, this time for leaving his vehicle in a spot reserved for patients at the school's regional rehabilitation center, university police said. 
Rix was ticketed last week for parking in a handicapped-only spot and was fined $100. Tues·day's offense, which will cost Rix $20, was reported by a student who took several pho­tos of Rix's vehicle, university officials said. 
"We have no explanation," vice president for university 
relations Lee Hinkle said. "Ask Chris Rix." 
Rix refused to comment about the latest incident after Tuesday's practice. University police said the player's vehicle was ticketed at 11:10 a.m., school officials confirmed. 
Team officials imposed a pun­ishment of extra running drills against Rix this week, in response to the handicapped­spot ticket he received after students called authorities when the player failed to heed their advice to remove the vehi­cle. More team-imposed penal­ties against Rix are possible, coach Bobby Bowden said Tuesday.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL 
Purdue looking forward to Irish 
Associated Press 
WEST LAFAYATTE-Purdue coach Joe Tiller loves compet­ing against Notre Dame. lie expects his players to feel the same. 
"I told the team on Sunday, 'Fellas this is why you play Division I football. This is why you came to Purdue to play, to play in this game," he said Tuesday. "This is why I came to Purdue to coach, to coach in this game." 
If No. 22 Purdue (2-1} can beat Notre Dame (1-2) in West Lafayette on Saturday, the Boilermakers would tie Michigan State for the second­most wins against the Irish (24). But the Boilermakers, already the team Notre Dame has beaten the second-most times (49), are just 2-15 against the Irish the past 17 years, beating the Irish in 1999 and 1997. 
Tiller, who is 2-4 against Notre Dame, still likes playing the Irish. 
"I like nail-biters," he said Tuesday. 
Tiller has chewed his nails down to the quick the past four games, with the games being decided by an average of four points. The past three games have been decided by big plays by the Notre Dame defense. 
Last season, Notre Dame cornerback Vontez Duff inter­cepted a tipped pass and returned it 33 yards for a touchdown with 5:09 left to give the Irish a 24-17 victory. Earlier in the game, Notre Dame had scored 14 points in 11 seconds on Purdue turnovers. 
Two years ago, Duff returned a kickoff 96 yards for a touch­down and Jason Beckstrom returned an interception 29 
-.

yards for a touchdown in a 24­18 victory in Bob Davie's last game as Notre Dame coach. 
Three years ago, the Irish scored 17 points off Purdue miscues and Nick Setta kicked a 38-yard field goal as time expired to give Notre Dame a 23-21 victory. 
Tiller said he won't talk much to the players about how the Boilermakers lost those games. He admits, though, he thinks about what could have been or would have been if a play or two had been different. 
"It really kind of grinds on you because you see the way we've gotten beaten," he said. "You have to give Notre Dame credit. They did make the plays when the plays were there to be made." 
Despite the last three games turning on big defensive plays by the Irish, Tiller said he won't put any special empha­sis on preventing turnovers. 
"We want our team to be aggressive and we want to be an attacking team. We're not going to play this game not to lose. We're going to play to win."

The Irish offense under either quarterback hasn't been particu­larly effective, either. Both Holiday and Quinn have connect­ed on touchdown passes with Rhema McKnight, and Julius Jones rushed for the only other Irish touchdown. 
Both Quinn and Holiday have said all the right things during the controversy, with Holiday saying he would support any decision made by the coaches and Quinn saying Holiday has the skills to be the starter. 
"If I didn't start, I'll just have to sit back and know my role from there," Holiday said. ''I'm not a selfish person so I really want what's best for this team now. I win." 
W hi I e Willingham said he was anxious to make a decision, it was not one he was willing to make light­ly. And after practice Tuesday, he said the competition was still up in the air. 
"If we could have that decision today, it would be better for the team, better for the quarterback, better for everyone. We don't have a problem making it as soon as possible. But it would have to be in our estimation the right time when you make that decision. 
"So if it takes till the end of the week to make that decision, then that's when we'll make it."

WOMEN'S SOCCER 
Irish rookie receives Big East a1Nard 
Special to the Observer 
Notre Dame freshman defend­
er Christie Shaner has been 
named the Big East Conference 
women's soccer rookie of the 
week, after playing a lead role in 
last week's pair of strong show­
ings versus 16th-ranked 
Stanford (0-0) and No. 10 Santa 
Clara (2-1) at the SCU adidas 
Classic. 
Shaner started both games at central back alongside senior Melissa Tancredi as the Irish continued to cope with the absence of injured All-American Candace Chapman. Another defensive starter, Gudrun Gunnarsdottir, played just a handful of minutes off the bench in last week's action. Shaner and her defensive counterparts responded to the challenge in dominating fashion by holding Stanford and Santa Clara to just three combined shots on goal and three combined corner kicks in 200 minutes of play. 
Four Notre Dame players already have received Big East weekly awards this season, including player of the week Mary Boland (Sept. 1). rookie of the week Jen Buczkowski (Sept. 
8) and defensive player of the week Vanessa Pruzinsky (Sept. 15), making Notre Dame the Big East's only team to receive at 
least one award in each of the 
four weeks this season. Notre 
Dame also has produced the 
most Big East weekly award 
winners thus far in 2003, is the 
only team to feature both an 
offensive and defensive player­
of-the-week selection and is the 
only squad with multiple rookie­
of-the-week recipients. 
Shaner was rated by Soccer America as the nation's No. 22 incoming recruit for the 2003 season (Buczkowski was No. 6 on that list) after a stellar prep career at Germantown Academy. She also has been active in vari­ous U.S. National Team pro­grams and nearly guided her FC Bucks Challenge club team to the 2003 USYA national-title game. 
Notre Dame (7 -0-1) remains No. 2 in the NSCAA Coaches poll and the Soccer Times and Soccer Buzz polls while Soccer America now lists the Irish third behind North Carolina and Florida. 
Notre Dame is one of 10 unde­feated teams remaining in all of Division I soccer, with that group including five teams that have no loss·es and no ties (North Carolina, Florida, Boston College, Cal Poly and Oklahoma State), three that join the Irish with one tie (Navy, Ohio State and Princeton) and twice-tied Pennsylvania.

Pangborn falls short against Cavanaugh 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER AND

Associate Sports Editor and Sports Writer 
For a while, it looked like the underdog Phoxes would pull ofl[ an upset. Then the Chaos offense got going. 
Cavanaugh defeated Pangborn 27-14 Tuesday, but the game was much closer than its finall score. Pangborn led at one poin., and was in the game until the Chaos scored two late touch­downs to put their opponent away. 
''I'd say this is definitely a moral victory," Pangborn cap­tain Katie Murray said. "The first half we were right with them, and we know they're one of the best teams in the league." 
It was the Phoxes who got on the board first, with quarter­back Christina Dunn completing a 26-yard touchdown pass to Trish Conneely. The extra point

Belles struggles continue 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER

Saint Mary's (8-6, 1-5) contin­ued to have trouble winning in conference, falling to Hope in four sets at home Tuesday by the score of 20-30, 30-28, 24­30, 26-30. 
"It seems like we didn't get started in that frrst game," said middle hitter Elise Rupright. "We really need that first game to get us going." 
Outside hitter Kristen Playko led the Belles with 21 kills and defensive specialist Alison Shevik led the team in digs with 22. 
Settter Lauren Temple and Playko each had three blocks. Temple also had 42 assists. 
"The team really played with a lot of heart," Rupright said. "We did many things right. It was close again, but we didn't quite pull it out." 
The Belles aren't hitting their stride. 
"We're coming up short a lot and we're searching for what it is we're missing," Rupright said. 
Saint Mary's has one last chance to win a conference game at home as they play Olivet Saturday at noon.
