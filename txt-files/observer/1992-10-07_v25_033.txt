Right-to-Life addressed 
By GERALDINE HAMILTON 
News Writer 

As part of Respect Life Week the pro-life activist group, Col­legians Activated to Liberate Life (CALL) spoke at the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's pro-life group meeting about the need for people to become active in the fight to stop abortion. 
Three representatives from CALL devoted a year to pro-life work, and they have been traveling for the last three weeks to midwest colleges to get support for the pro-life cause, said Bill Keen, co-presi­dent of the Right to Life group. "CALL is an organization geared toward activism-to­ward getting people involved," he said.

INSIDE COLUMN 
Demands and regrets don't show tolerance 
To hear them talk about ""f 

it, victory has never tasted 
so good. 

After lambasting NBC and the historically raucous "Saturday Night.....,.~ Live" for last week's performance by the equally outspoken Sinead O'Connor, Notre Dame's Student Senate is revellin~------­in the network's conciliatory -yet spineless ­retraction. 
Most observers by now know the story: O'Connor, during an emotional performance o Bob Marley's "War," ripped into pieces a photo of Pope John Paul II, referring to him as "the real enemy." A stunned audience was just the beginning of NBC's woes, for the network soon found its switchboard jammed with calls from complaining viewers. 
Among the outraged was the Notre Dame Student Senate, who passed a resolution demanding an apology and statement of regret from NBC. "This country was founded on religious tolerance," SUB Manager Pat McCarthy said at Monday's senate meeting. "The action displayed no tolerance, no respect." 
The senate got what it wanted. In a statement released Tuesday, NBC denounced O'Connor and apologized to the nation for her actions. "NBC had no knowledge of what she was going to do," the statement read. "Had we known NBC would not have permitted it." 
Is this the 'tolerance' McCarthy speaks of? Essentially, both the senate and NBC have redefined the term, which to most (including Webster) describes the "fair and permissible attitude toward opinions and practices that differ from one's own." 
Of course O'Connor's opinions and practices differ from the senate's, and much of the Notre Dame community. She hails from a war-torn Ireland, mired in religious and social unrest. Few would be pressed to deny that O'Connor has legitimate grounds for her religious sentiment -just as few could deny the religious grounds that conservatives like Pat Buchanan cite for anti-homosexual remarks, or constitutional grounds that liberals like Bill Clinton cite for a pro-choice stance. 
In each and every case, tolerance requires watching, listening and understanding. It does not now, and never will, require agreement. 
The hypocrisy of the senate's resolution should overwhelm anyone with basic First Amendment knowledge and a working conscience. Not only did the senate overreact to the situation and appear self-righteous and self­serving in its media barrage, but the group ironically furthered O'Connor's argument by over-publicizing it. 
In demanding that NBC drop to its knees over O'Connor's actions, the senate asked the network to make a judgment that her work was more than offensive, that it was hateful, intolerant and therefore unacceptable. 
Surely, student leaders with a reverence for religion would understand that no human possesses such a power to judge. That is, after all, what tolerance is all about.

DENVER -Barbara Bush on Tuesday danced with senior citizens, hugged children and urged voters to stand with President Bush in his battle against Bill Clinton and "the scandal-ridden Congress." "This is going to be a tough race for the president and all Re­publican candidates," she told 750 Republican parti­sans at a $10-a-plate luncheon at the Jefferson County Fairgrounds. "I don't believe the polls," she told re­porters at a brief news conference. "I just don't believe them."

Equality Now working toward gender equality 
By ALICIA REALE Assistant News Editor 
Equality Now is working for gender equality through dedi­cation to international action for the civil, political, economic and social rights of women, according to Jessica Neuwirth, group president. 
"Hundreds of women around the world are bought, sold, beaten and killed with im­punity," she said at a lecture yesterday entitled "Equality Now!: Human Rights as if Women Mattered." 
Equality Now works with groups in other countries; sometimes with formal groups or lawyers in cases defending women . "We change the flavor of the community through our impact," said Neuwirth. 
They also try to "interact in a pro-active, constructive way to change the situation for women in the country," she said. "We provide women with alterna­tives, work to create opportuni­ties in business. Over time we hope to elevate female status in country." 
There is violence to women in all cultures, including our own which Equality Now works to combat, said Neuwirth. "Equality is a transcendent right," said Neuwirth. 
The group works for women's rights that have long been ignored in international organizations, national gov­ernments, traditional human rights groups and the press, said Neuwirth.

and women around the globe continue to endure debilitating and often fatal human rights abuses, she said. 
For example, in India 10-year old girls are sold and exported to be wives in auctions held in back streets, and in Burma, women with AIDS are injected with cyanide and killed, said Neuwirth. 
"Human rights are not sub­ject to erosion under cultural relativism. Cultures are not monolithic," she said. 
Many international conven­tions protect human rights for women, such as international laws under the United Nations for equality and equal protec­tion under the law, she said. 
Equality Now mobilizes action on behalf of women whose rights are not protected and promotes women's rights at national and international levels through mail campaigns, video witnessing, media events and public information activi­ties, according to Neuwirth. 
The group gleans research from human rights groups, newspapers, governments and lawyers. "Accuracy and preci­sion are our highest priority," Neuwirth said. "We get and present facts. We let the facts speak for themselves." 
The group also takes action through "adaptation of human rights techniques which we use as catalysts for change,"she said. 
"We understand the impor­tance of audio visual communi­cation. Television and radio are the way in which most peo­ple learn," said Neuwirth.

Carberry receives Murphree Award 
By CARRIE KINSELLA News Writer 
James Carberry, professor of chemical engineering at Notre Dame, is the latest recipient of the E.V. Murphree Award in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry from the American Chemical Society. 
The award honors career ac­complishments and contribu­tions in research and develop­ment. This award is not given annually, and it is unusual for an engineer to receive it. 
James Kohn, assistant chairman of chemical engi­neering, expressed the de­partment's "delight in having a chemical engineer recognized" by this notable award. 
He graduated from Notre Dame in 1950 and received his Master's degree here, as well. He received a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from Yale Univer­sity before returning to Notre Dame in 1961.

Debartolo provides 'high-end' computer cluster 
By MATT BOWER News Writer 
The new academic year has brought with it many dramatic changes in Notre Dame's com­puting services. Both students and faculty now have access to top of the line hardware and services. 
The most notable addition to the Notre Dame computing is the new Debartolo computer cluster. 
"This new cluster is certainly a high-end cluster," said, James Ostlund, director of User Services. In addition to 78 new computers, the cluster also contains high speed laser printers and multimedia sta­tions. 
The Debartolo building has been equipped with several computers for classroom use. Computer instruction stations have been installed in 13 rooms, while two classrooms each contain 30 computers for student use. 
To complement the new hardware additions, University

himself through numerous publications and awards, in­cluding his acceptance to the National Academy of Engineer­ing in 1989. He has also re­ceived many honors from the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, most recently their first Thiele Award (1992). 
He advocates "knowing the answer before you begin" to find solutions. Intuition has provided the source for his de­velopments, he said. He also is quick to acknowledge the use of cooperative research with other disciplines, because others can bring a different perspective to a problem. 
Carberry's research is pri­marily in the areas of reaction and catalytics, important in in­dustrial catalysis operations. A significant accomplishment was his development of the Carberry-Notre Dame reactor in 1964. 
In addition to his engineering accomplishments he has also written a legal and scientific argument against abortion with Douglas Kmiec of the Notre Dame Law School, and empha­sizes the importance of liberal arts in education. 
Carberry credits the source of his accomplishments to his students. He cites in particular the seniors' research projects ­"their enthusiasm provides an inspiration." 
He is currently working on molecular biology in collabora­tion with Cambridge University and Paul Huber from the Notre Dame department of biology and life sciences. 
Computing has installed many new services for both student and faculty use. The most no­table additions are E-mail and the Gopher networks. 
"The E-mail system allows students to correspond with others on this campus or on other campuses worldwide, re­ducing phone bills," said Denise Moser of the Information Resource Center coordinator. "Professors can also correspond with their students through E­
rnan." 

Every Notre Dame student has an E-mail account and needs only to go to the library or Debartolo computer clusters to activate their free account. 
The new Gopher network complements the E-mail sys­tem. It hooks into national and international computer systems to allow students to access a variety of information sources. 
Currently Presidential plat­forms, UPI news releases, weather reports and student addresses at other Universities are available on the network. 
"It provides a wealth of in­formation, and soon more will be available, " added Moser. 
Assistant Provost for Univer­sity Computing Donald Spicer, emphasized that the changes are "evolutionary." These changes represent only the beginning of a reworking of the Notre Dame Computing ser­vices. 
"We are continuing to rewire all of the academic buildings and we are currently trying to devise a way to distribute in­formation through the campus," said Spicer. 
The next major project for University Computing will be networking dorm rooms to the computer clusters. 
"It is the next logical step," he said. "Right now we just lack the funding." 
"Five or six years ago we were not in a very good position (compared to other institutions), but we are now in a very competitive position," said Spicer. "We have one of the top computer to student ratios and our management is first rate." 

Library donates computer to National Library of Poland 
Special to the Observer 
The University of Notre Dame libraries system has donated its IBM 4381 computer to the Na­tional Library of Poland. 
The eight-ton gift was trans­ported by the University of Chicago and was flown to its Warsaw destination by LOT Polish Airlines, according to Robert Miller, libraries director. 
The Polish National Library, located in a newly-constructed modern facility that houses six million volumes and employs almost 900 people, has been automating its operations over the last 20 years under strict Western embargo regulations for computer hardware and software. 
Miller recently returned from the University of Warsaw where he held an exchange faculty position in its professional library. 
"The Polish National Library currently uses an IBM 4361 system with capabilities that no longer satisfy its growing needs," said Miller. 
"We were in the same posi­tion until we replaced our IBM 4381. It simply became obvious what we should do with our old equipment." 
Once the computer is on-line, the Polish library's databases and catalogs will be accessible to users beyond the library's walls.

one of the CALL representatives. 
Heers spoke of the revolu­tionary spirit of Jesus Christ and said that pro-life activists must go against the grain of culture as Jesus Christ did and stand up and do something to fight abortion. 
"The selfish, self centered society we live in -that is the real root of abortion. The self­less message of Christianity has been abandoned," said Heers. "Notre Dame is in a position to make a huge impact. It has the roots and the teachings." 
Like the solidarity movement in Poland and the Civil Rights movement in the United States, CALL is a non-violent move­ment who has nothing to lose and everything to gain, said Heers. 
An interruption occurred when members of the audience voiced their concern about the contempt for Bill Clinton sup­porters by pro-life activists. 
A debate ensued in which the abortion stances of the presi­dential candidates were dis­cussed instead of the agenda

action and resisting arrest for participating in the protest, ac­cording to Johnson. 
The rescue group succeeded in shutting down the clinic for the day and saving at least one human life before the protest ended at 3 p.m. All 73 protesters were handcuffed and jailed in a one-car garage until 9 p.m., Johnson added. 
Johnson, Keen and Boyce returned to Champaign in June for arraignment. According to Johnson, the charge of mob action was dropped, but they were still formally charged with criminal trespassing and resist­ing arrest. 
Last Tuesday, Keen and Boyce returned to Champaign a third time for their trials. Keen, a senior, pleaded no contest to the stipulated fact that he was involved in the protest in April. 
"In effect, I pleaded guilty and agreed to the charge," Keen said. 
Because Keen took the option of a plea bargain, he was found guilty of the lesser charge, criminal trespassing. Accord­ing to Keen, this charge holds with it a maximum sentence of 30 days m pnson and a $500 fine. He will receive his sen­tence on November 13 and will be on probation until that date. 
"I expect to serve some time in jail," Keen said. "When we did this, we realized jail was a possibility." He added that he was willing to face the conse­quences because, "I know in my heart that what I did was right." 
Sophomore Elizabeth Boyce was found guilty of criminal trespassing and resisting arrest.

which the CALL representatives had prepared. 
The question arose concern­ing the feasibility of holding a pro-life, pro-Clinton stance, which some members of the audience claimed to hold. 
In response, Heers stated, "Abortion is the most unjust and disgusting abuse of human rights, so therefore Bush has to be voted for." 
The meeting continued with the CALL Director of Social Outreach, Stephanie Placek, instructing the audience on methods used to fight abortion. "Picketing at an abortion mill is making a statement," said Placek. 
Sidewalk counseling is talking to the women entering the abortion clinics and relating the truths about abortion as well as the serious affects of post-abor­tion syndrome, said Placek. 
Another type of activism is the "Rescue," said Placek. "A Rescue is placing yourself be­tween the killer and the child by blocking the door of the abortion mill," she said. 
There was recently a Rescue in Champagne, Ill. in which 73 college students were arrested outside an abortion clinic, said Placek. 

e JU ge oun er gm ty o both charges after she pleaded innocent last Tuesday, according to Boyce. 
Boyce does not regret partici­pating in the protest. She ex­plained, "I did what I had to do and they found me guilty. That's fine." She will be sentenced on November 12. 
Like Keen, Boyce faces the possibility of jail time as a result of her conviction. She had never been in jail before the protest last April. 
Junior Claire Johnson must return to Champaign on Octo­ber 16 for her trial. She will then be given the option of plea bargaining or taking the stand. 
Johnson does not want to take the option of plea bargaining. If she pleads not guilty, she will argue the "necessity defense" and try to convince the judge that she felt the protest was truly necessary. "I view it as the greater good save a life," she said. 
Johnson regrets, however, that the case has dragged on for so long. She said it is a non­typical rescue because each protester is being tried sepa­rately. Normally, in such cases all of the protesters are tried as a group immediately after the

"We are just really happy we got the first show together, we all shared the responsibilities," said Schulz. 
Schulz said that the project could

The first show will be re­broadcast Tuesday, Oct. 30.

Schulz also said that he thinks that the South Bend­Mishawaka community will benefit from the program. 
"Notre Dame is a very big part of the community," he said, "but it will be good for them to be able to see it news­wise and entertainment-wise and in ways other than just sports." 
The idea of the show was de­veloped by Schulz after work­ing at Heritage Cable as a vol­unteer sports commentator on a community affairs show. 

He approached Heritage with the idea for the show, and after getting its approval, scouted for students who might be inter­ested in working on the project. 
Heritage Cable has given the students studio and production time every week to produce the show which airs the first Tues­day of every month at 8 p.m. with a rebroadcast of the show on the third Tuesday of the month at the same time.

Aided by a pair of sympa­thetic senators, D'Amato gamely held the floor through the night and beyond noon. He never sat down or even left to use the bathroom, but he did give way briefly to allow the Senate chaplain to conduct the daily prayer.

Lawmakers in both parties were in a rush to return home to campaign for re-election. 
But adjournment, already put off by one day, became elusive when Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a New York Republican battling for re-election, snarled the Se­nate in a 15-hour filibuster over the tax bill after it cleared the House early Tuesday morning.

Collins: Multiculturalism falsely portrayed by media 
By ALEX MONTOYA News Writer 
Multiculturalism is falsely portrayed by the media as a negative ideal demanded by minorities only, Ava Collins said Tuesday. 
Collins, director of the gender studies program, said that both the national media and educa­tion system have failed to demonstrate how multicultural­ism is intended to bring all people together. 
Speaking at a fireside chat as part of the Multicultural Fall Festival, Collins said that the newspaper and television in­dustries are not addressing the need for all people to learn about each other and that edu­cation leaders are labeling multiculturalism as an unnec­essary burden forced by special interest groups. 
"There is a problematic no­tion in this country that we all belong to this grand melting pot," she said, "but in a melting pot a person's voice is lost." 
What is not being addressed is the nation's growing diversity and subsequently the need for all cultures to educate each other, Collins said. 
These ideas, she said, are not being implemented by schools at various levels out of "a fear that the traditional classroom learning atmosphere will be destroyed." 
Some changes have been made to textbooks, Collins noted, but there must be other changes. One idea Collins mentioned, formed by the Black Faculty Caucus at the University of Texas, is to recruit more minority faculty and help increase the diversity of the student body. 
She also mentioned increas­ing recruiting of minority graduate students and encour­aging them to pursue teaching careers. 
Collins cited the media for misrepresenting multicultural­ism and agreed it should not be regarded as just "a minority thing." 
"The media," she said, "has great power to influence and have an impact. Just look at Murphy Brown and Dan Quayle, and most recently, Sinead O'Connor."

MSA pledges support for use of force to end violence in Bosnia-Hercegovina 
By JOHN CONNORTON News Writer 
The Muslim Student Asso­ciation (MSA), a small group of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students, has begun efforts to increase aware­ness of the . atrocities com­mitted in Bosnia-Hercegov ina. 
Pledging to support the efforts of Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, who has calledfor the use offorce tQ.. end the violence in Bosnia­Hercegovina, the MSA has increased its presence Oil the Notre Dame campus to attract attention to the plight .of Bosnian citizens, Muslim and non-Muslim alike. 
Beginning with the multi· cultural fair this week, the MSA plans to stage events to garner support for what jt feels is the best way to remedy the civil war in what U$ed to be Yugoslavia. 
"We feel that the arms embargo should be lifted," said Abid Yousuf,Vice President of the MSA, addressing the current United Nation's ban on weapons shipments to the troubled region. "What the Muslim Croats need now is something to defend them­selves with." 
Yousuf praised the efforts of Senator Lugar, citing his willingness to go out on a limb to convince Congress and the Senate to take action in Bosnia. 
"Something has to be done now before the House closes" in two weeks, said Yousuf. "The U.S. and the 
U.N. must do something be· yond peace talks. No peace till Bosnia is returned." 



Student speaks before Spanish forum 
Special to the Observer 
Emil Bolongaita, a doctoral student in the government de­partment, spoke last month be· fore the Spanish Forum of the Chief Executive's Organization (CEO) in Madrid, Spain. 
Bolongaita's presentation emphasized the need for CEO to help build corporate com­munities to help sustain and advance movements to com­munity at the national and in· ternationallevel. 
He advised the CEO to help build world community, initiate corporate communities in com· panies by changing corporate culture, implement top-heavy management in inclusive cul­tures with open communication processes, and collaborative management through teams. 
According to Bolongaita, his ideas for community were shaped by his experience in the International Scholars Program of the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, which brings young scholar­leaders from different parts of the world to Notre Dame to study. 
Bolongaita was invited and introduced at the meeting by Father Theodore Hesburgh, University president-emeritus and the education director of CEO's Spain Forum. 
Boeing held meeting concerning possible engine-mount problem before 747 crash 
SEATTLE (AP) -Boeing of­ficials met with operators of early model 7 4 7 jets to discuss possible problems with engine mounts two weeks before a cargo version of the plane smashed into a Dutch apart­ment building, the company said today. 
The Sept. 16 meeting was held because of a long standing concern about fatigue cracking in fuse pins, which hold the four engines onto the 747's wings, said Boeing Commercial Airplane Group spokesman Jack Gamble. 
Boeing is redesigning the pins, and on Monday issued a service bulletin asking opera­tors of some 7 4 7 models to in­spect the pins and repair or replace them if necessary. 
Swissair spokesman Hannes Kummer said earlier today that the Swiss carrier received a telex from Boeing last week suggesting checks for cracks in the pins within 90 days. Gamble said the need for the inspec­tions was discussed at the Seat­tle meeting, which was at­tended by Swissair and El Al representatives. 
Dutch officials said the Israeli El Al 7 4 7 -200F freighter that crashed Sunday evening lost the two engines from its right wing shortly after taking off at Amsterdam's airport. They said the was unable to

maneuver the plane back for an emergency landing. More than 250 people were feared killed on the ground. 
The crash was similar to a China Airlines accident last De­cember in which a 747-200 freighter dropped two engines from its right wing shortly after taking off from Taipei. Five crew members were killed in that crash. 
Gamble said that while both accidents involved the same type of aircraft, the right-wing engines, and occurred while the jets were climbing after takeoff, there was no way to tell yet whether the fuse pins were a factor.

ELECTION '92 

ELECTION BRIEFS Perot not catching on 
NEW YORK -A national poll released Tuesday showed Ross Perot getting the support of only one in 10 voters even after they had a few days to hear about his campaign. The NBC News poll taken Sunday and Monday showed Bill Clinton leading with 46 percent, President Bush at 32 percent, Perot at 10 percent and 12 percent 
uncommitted. Perot announced his candidacy Thursday, then virtually secluded himself except for a television interview. The poll of 820 registered voters has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
Clinton ad irks taxpayers 
WASHINGTON-Five middle­class taxpayers who appeared in a controversial television ad for Presi­dent Bush urged Democrat Bill Clin­ton's campaign on Tuesday to stop airing a reply ad that also shows their pictures. At the same time, one of the five acknowledged that, far from being just another ordinary taxpayer, he worked in Wisconsin for Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson's campaign and now has a state job under Thomp­son's administration. Controversy continued to swirl over the Bush ad, which showed five middle-class Americans and said that under a 
Clinton presidency, each would pay $1.000 to $2,000 more in taxes. 
Clinton poses with Elvis 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. -Bill Clinton went to Music Row on Tuesday to have his picture taken at Houndogs. 
a hot dog stand with an Elvis Presley motif. He wasn't too tender to George Bush. "You know, Bush is always comparing me to Elvis in sort of unflattering ways." Clinton, a.k.a. Elvis, complained. 

Perot appears on national TV 
DALLAS (AP) -Ross Perot bought 30 minutes on national TV for his first ad as a presidential candidate Tuesday night, delivering a lecture on the sorry state of the economy spiced by a tongue-lashing of government officials who become lobbyists for other coun­tries. 
Perot said of such officials, "This is like a general switching armies in the middle of the war. They should come to serve and go home, not cash in." 
Most of the ad, which forgoes the Madison Avenue touches of the Bush and Clinton campaigns, was filmed after Perot's announcement last Thurs­day that he was officially joining the race. 
Called "Jobs, Debt and the Mess in Washington," the ad repeated many of the economic and government reform themes Perot has made in dozens of television interviews. Perot spoke from a desk, using a chart and pointer. 
With the election just one month away, Perot is pouring his time and money into television, detailing eco­nomic troubles and his solutions, which include higher taxes, cuts in entitle­ments and government spending. An­other 30-minute ad is scheduled for Friday night, and he also is to begin running 30-and 60-second commer­cials on the major TV networks begin­ning Thursday. 
Campaign officials provided an ex­cerpt of Tuesday night's ad in advance. 
In the excerpt, Perot strongly criti­cized government workers who become 
lobbyists and political campaign 
activists after leaving their federal jobs. 
"That's like having Russian spies in 
the middle of a presidential campaign 
during the Cold War. Because we're in a 
business war now, folks," Perot said. 
"The sickest thing of all, we had a key guy on the (International Trade Com­mission) leave and go to the other side in the middle of a negotiation. He knew the plans, the strategy, the detail," Perot said. "As far as I'm concerned, that's economic treason." 
He gave no names. 

Orson Swindle, Perot's national vol­unteer coordinator, said Tuesday night's ad would be typical for the campaign. 
"We won't have Ken and Barbie im­ages up there as you get with the Democrats or Indiana Fitzwater run­ning around in his hat," Swindle said in a reference to Bill and Hillary Clinton and the safari hat of President Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater. "You won't see that kind of stuff." 
At least one more 30-minute ad after Friday's is being prepared but is un­scheduled, spokeswoman Sharon Hol­man said. 
Perot paid $380,000 to run the first spot on CBS, before the National League baseball playoff game in most of the country. 
Swindle said Perot's participation in the presidential debates will be the cru­cial part of the Dallas billionaire's cam­paign. He said Perot would make some campaign appearances, too, but none had been scheduled as of Tuesday.

Ross Perot has outlined his reasons for the nation's economic woes in 21 charts. Some examples:

Bush, Clinton prepare for series of debates 
WASHINGTON (AP) -President Bush studied at the White House on Tuesday for Sunday's leadoff debate, while Bill Clinton summoned stand-ins for mock go-rounds in Kansas City -including a Washington lawyer to play Bush and an Oklahoma congressman to play Ross Perot. 
With the approach of the nationally televised debate, which the Bush forces hope will shake up the final few weeks of Campaign '92, full-tilt preparation was beginning. 
Clinton planned to hole up in battle­ground Missouri for the latter part of the week, practicing and trying to determine Bush attack avenues in advance of the real show, set for Sunday across the state in St. Louis. 
Bush, meanwhile, charted his own debate tactics Tuesday from the White House, setting aside three hours for a session with chief of staff James Baker III, budget director Richard Darman, and other top policy aides. 
If and when Bush moves on to re­hearsal debates -aides said there could be one Saturday at the White House -Darman would play dual roles, jumping back and forth between portrayals of Clinton and Perot, said a Republican source. 
The budget director, who played Democrat Michael Dukakis in Bush's mock debates in 1988, has been carrying around debate briefing books for weeks.

Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to your publication's security pol­icy. In Julie Barrett's article, "Crime policy applies to all," she outlined the reasoning be­hind publishing a student's name if he or she is arrested. 
Barrett stated that it is of in­terest to the student body when students are arrested, and The Observer intends "to provide the most thorough coverage of all security issues on campus and in the community." 
Yet I feel that you have failed in providing the "thorough coverage" that you promise. While I disagree with the prac­tice of printing students' titles in addition to their names, I can understand, to some extent, the reasoning involved. 
I did not enter The Commons last weekend to conduct Scholastic business, but my po­sition at the magazine does not

end as I step out of the campus boundaries. I accepted my po­sition at Scholastic; therefore, I accepted the responsibility it entails. 
The security policy is sup­posed to ensure that students are being treated fairly, yet I feel The Observer was some­what selective and irresponsible in its coverage of the S.U.D.S. raids at The Commons and, earlier this year, at Campus View and Turtle Creek. 
The Observer claims that it will include the titles of varsity athletes, elected student gov­ernment officials and publica­tions editors, yet only a few students were pinpointed as holding titles while several more were deleted. 
Why are some titles included while others were ignored? Do your reporters simply pinpoint those students whose positions are blatantly obvious? 
For example, there is a list of the Hall President's Council members in the student direc­tory; none of the HPC members that have been cited over the past month have had their titles listed. I believe that they fit un­der the category of "elected student government official." Why were these titles ex­empted? 
If your publication boasts of providing "thorough" coverage of such incidents, don't you think you should follow through and not discriminate against certain students? 
I advise that if you plan to maintain this policy, your re­porters should take the time top provide what you promise, not 
simply students.  highlight  certain

Important changes in Travel Grant Committee rules 
Kurt Mills 
On the Other Hand 
As many of you know, the travel grant fund of the Gradu­ate Student Union has been one of the most popular and widely used GSU services. 
This fund is used to partially defray the costs of presenting a scholarly paper at a conference, and has been of great help to many graduate students over the years. 
What many of you probably do not know is that the guide­lines used by the Travel Grant Committee have been changed. Below, I will talk about some of these changes, as well as the way in which these changes were made. 
In the past, students were able to submit a funding form either before or after the actual conference. This enabled stu­dents, first, to know how much they were going to get before­hand, and second, to be able to pay for plane tickets or other up front expenses. 
This is especially important for students without credit cards, and even those with credit cards who would have to pay their bills before the con­ference, since most graduate students tend to live paycheck by paycheck. 
In addition, knowing before­hand how much they will re­ceive might also make the dif­ference in whether or not stu­dents decide they can actually afford to attend the conference. 
The committee has decided to restrict the process so that stu­dents can only submit for re­imbursement with full receipts after the conference. 
Apparently, this decision was made because of supposed fraud and wastefulness in the process. The claim is made that graduate students submitted forms before the fact that vastly overestimated the cost of their trip, and then did not submit receipts detailing their expendi­tures, as required. 
In addition, supposedly the Travel Grant Committee did not follow up on those who did not submit receipts. 
I have very grave doubts that if graduate students did try to rip off the GSU it amounted to that much or was very widespread. 
According to the past Travel Grant Chair, Mel Hall, who had been involved with the commit­tee for several years, he and the committee followed up on all submissions. 
Even if this were a problem, it would seem reasonable that the Travel Grant Committee should, rather than making wholesale changes, enforce the rules more strictly and follow up more closely, as the new chair seems interested in doing. 
Punishing all graduate stu­dents because of a few bad ap­ples does not make sense, and insults the vast majority of graduate students who benefit fairly from the Fund. 
The previous Chair notes that the only outcome of these changes will be to make the job of the Travel Grant Chair easier, and make it harder for students to receive support. 
We are also given no idea what percentage of our ex­Il.t)nses we can expect to be re­imbursed. 
While it will vary from fund­ing period to funding period, depending upon the number of applicants, we should still ex­pect some sort of ballpark es­timate. 
The form states the students should be able to expect be­tween 30 percent and 50 per­cent reimbursement, which is what was given in past years. The minutes of the last Gradu­ate Student Council meeting indicate 15 percent, and some people have been told 20 per­cent. 
Since the fund has increased substantially since last year, I find it hard to believe that the rate would go down. In any event, we deserve a better es­timate. 
Regarding the way in which these new regulations were enacted, it is interesting to note that this administration cam­paigned against what it per­ceived as nondemocratic prac­tices within the GSU and promised to leave almost every decision up to the full Council. Yet, these decisions were made without any real input by the Council. 
This is in contrast to past years, when the Travel Grant Chair came to the first Council meeting of the year and pre­sented all of the committee rules and guidelines, and asked for approval of the allocated amounts for each funding pe­riod for the upcoming year. 
In addition, it should be noted that until this year, the position of Travel Grant Chair has been filled from those who have worked on the committee. This has provided continuity and expertise, and has also served as a reward for individuals who have volunteered on the com­mittee. 
The new policy which com­bines the position of vice presi­dent and Travel Grant Chair make such continuity very diffi­cult. 
Finally, the timing of the fall deadline was changed from November 15 to September 15; unfortunately few people knew this. 
It was announced in the Graduate Student Newsletter, which was dated September 16, the day after the deadline, and the back of the application form notes that the revised form was approved on September 1 7, two days after the deadline. 
After pressure from various quarters, the deadline for this fall has been extended to Octo­ber 15, although this has not been made widely known ei­ther. 
If you are concerned about this issue, you can talk with your departmental representa­tives, or attend the next Grad­uate Student Council Meeting tonight at 7 p.m. in the Notre Dame Room of LaFortune.

Things, life, whatnot 

On a higher level of smut 
I 
t's kind of scary. 
Stay-at-home moms schedule 
carpools around them. Corporate 
executives re-arrange meetings 
because of them. College students skip 
classes to see them. 
They're daytime television talk shows and I have to admit I'm a victim of their sensationalistic intrigue, although I'm not sure why. 
I'm not talking about sleazy tabloid shows like "A Current Affair." I prefer to see myself as being on a higher level of smut, led by my close friends Oprah and Sally Jessy. 
When Phil Donahue perfected his talent of running like a lunatic up and down stairs through his audience with an outstretched microphone for anyone who would take it, the TV talk show took on a whole new meaning. 
But why are we so enthralled with shows starring Geraldo, Maury, Faith, Jenny and Joan? Who are they, and why are we under the impression that they can single-handedly solve the problems of screwed-up Americans in a mere hour of television? 
Or an even better question: Where do shows find people with such stupid, smutty, idiotic lives who are willing to expose themselves on national television? 
There are endless topics just waiting to be covered by the likes of Phil Donahue and Faith Daniels. But week after week, certain subjects seem to be favored. 
Here's just a sampling: 
In-family marriages are always a hot topic. 
In the last year, Oprah Winfrey devoted an hour to "When your husband marries your mother," Geraldo Rivera counseled a young woman who married her father and Sally Jessy Raphael questioned a teenage girl who wooed her stepfather and proceeded to have his baby. 
Weird. 
Sexual oddities are classic. 
Women explaining how they gave birth without knowing they were pregnant, cross­dressers telling all, and people undergoing sex changes always boost ratings. 
Even this week, Jenny Jones pondered the lives of "Lipstick lesbians and macho gay men." Weirder. 
Sexual promiscuity is another favorite. 
Chippendale dancers and Playboy centerfolds strip at least once a week on any given network. The Barbi Twins of poster pin-up fame have graced the tube on numerous occasions, and women with size "M" bra cups have explained the plight of their uh... big situation. 
A recent episode of "Sally Jessy Raphael" featured the topic "Babedom: boobs, boys and high heels." Husbands enjoyed watching their "plain Jane" wives mudwrestle with "sleazy babes" to determine the REAL women in the group. 
Even weirder. 
When all else fails, TV talk shows can always rely on Geraldo's favorite approach: take a topic you've covered before (like "Psycho cat killers") and add a new twist. Now it becomes "Psycho cat killers and the women who love them." A entirely new and different topic-how easy was that? 
The TV smut level is rising ... tune in next week for "Transsexual cops who support Ross Perot and the women who love them." Yes, it definitely is kind of scary.

by Scott Mendenhall The Department of Communication and Theater is bringing the play 'Ah, Wilderness' to Notre Dame from October 7 through October 11. 
Atheatrical look at tamily values 
Eugene O'Neill's 'Ah, Wilderness' explores the dynamics of family relationships 
By JENNIFER GUERIN Assistant Accent Editor 
"L ife! Life is a joke and everything works out wrong in the end." 
It is not the cry of frustrated college students in this week before mid-terms, but of a con­fused young boy in 1906. The character is Richard Miller, teenage philosopher and aspiring student of love poetry in Eugene O'Neill's "Ah, Wilderness." 
The play traces the activities of the family of Nat Miller, a newspaper editor in a small Connecticut town in 1906. Miller's household consists of a concerned wife struggling to keep her family happy; an uncle whose relationship with Lily, the woman he loves, is tainted by an inability to deal with his drinking problem; and four children, the most troublesome of whom is Richard. 
As he works through the re­bellious stage of his youth, this young man convinces himself, with all the fleeting conviction of a love-struck adolescent, that cruelty and passion are the true driving forces in the world. In response, he rebels with all of his might (which proves not to be much) against authority figures in his life. 
Studying the works of poets like Shaw, Carlysle, and Wilde, Richard is moved by their romantic verse to court the young and innocent Muriel, whose father does not hesitate to express his dissatisfaction. Debates about Richard's rebellious antics en­sue, and in uncovering their significance, the Millers find that the passions of youth, while humorous and fleeting, may also be meaningful. 
Packed into this portrayal of 48 hours of time are lengthy dialogues, masked as comic conversations and irate exchanges between family members. Out of these passionate discourses, however, emerges the picture of a genuinely loving family with honest flaws and attributes. 
"Ah, Wilderness!" is steeped in familiar O'Neill themes like family disagreements and the destructiveness of alcoholism. As O'Neill's only comedy, however, its final message is hopeful and refreshing, because the family displays its ability to survive. 
O'Neill's play reveals the honest 
'This is a time when people are concerned with family values. This is a very rich play because the family displays negatives as well as positives.' 
--Mark C. Pilkinton 
frustration but enduring sympathy of a mother for her children, the irrationality inherent in adolescent love, and, more seriously, the pain of relationships to which lovers cling de­spite a sobering recognition that the partnership is doomed. 
According to Mark C. Pilkinton, professor in the Department of Communication and Theatre and director of the play, "Ah, Wilderness!" 
was chosen not only because O'Neill is considered "the greatest American playwright," but also because the play presents themes that are timeless. 
The notion of family values ties O'Neill's play to life in this election year with uncanny appropriateness. "This is a time when people are concerned with family values," Pilkinton said. "This is a very rich play, because the family displays negatives as well as positives." 
The dynamics among cast members in the Department of Communication and Theatre's performance will fascinate audiences, bringing the turn-of-the-century household to life in a way that is both humorous and realistic. 
Mark White, who portrays the rebellious son, creates a caricature in Richard Miller that is both comically youthful and ardently committed to larger ideas of truth and love. Joe Wilson and Katherine Blakey, as Nat Miller and his wife Essie, have mastered the dynamics of a couple who, despite their frustrations and pet peeves, cannot help but remain in love and laugh at the antics of their children. 
The performances of Michael Scarsella and Jeannie Goodnow as Essie's alcoholic brother and Nat's sister, Lily, lend an aspect of seriousness to an otherwise refreshing look at family life. 
"Ah, Wilderness!" will run at Washington Hall from Wednesday, October 7 to Saturday, October 10, at 8:10p.m. and Sunday, October 11, at 
3:10 p.m. Tickets for all shows are available at the LaFortune Informa­tion Desk, or at the time of per­formance.

Is Jack Morris the ticket to a title? 
TORONTO (AP) -A little older, a little wiser and defi­nitely a lot richer and a lot more relaxed, Jack Morris is ready again. 
Because when it comes to playing baseball's biggestALCS games, there is no 
pitcher with a bigger reputation. 
Who could forget that chilly night last October, Morris standing alone in the Metrodome as Atlanta loaded the bases in Game 7, the World Series championship in the balance? Or the result, Morris steadying himself and the Min­nesota Twins, finishing with a 10-inning shutout that earned him the MVP award? 
Morris will be back on mound Wednesday night when he starts for Toronto against Dave Stewart and the Oakland Athletics in Game 1 of the playoffs. He's already won titles with two teams, and now the Blue Jays are hoping he can take them there, too. 
"I don't know the task is ever any easier," Morris said Tues­day. "The fact that I've been there makes me more com­fortable." 
"But tomorrow, that little, wonderful feeling is going to come back," he said. "Playoff time in October." 
It's a time Morris knows well. 
He is 3-1 lifetime in the play­offs, including two victories against Toronto last year. He's even better in the World Series, going 4-0 with a 1.54 ERA in five starts. 
Morris' success in the post­season was a big reason why the Blue Jays forked over $10.85 million for two years and lured him away from his hometown Twins as a free agent. 
At 37, the Blue Jays expected a lot and they got it as Morris matched a career-best with a 21-6 record. Even though he tied for the major league lead in victories. some of his critics said he wasn't that great and pointed at his 4.04 ERA. 
True, Morris became the first 20-game winner with a ERA over 4.00 since Jim Merritt for Cincinnati in 1970, and just the 11th ever to do it. And it's true that such a stat could've left him this year in the company of pitchers such as Ramon Martinez (8-11, 4.00 ERA), Charlie Hough (7-12. 3.93) or Trevor Wilson (8-14, 4.21). 
But Morris and his manager have answers for that. 
"Let me explain something about ERA," Morris said. "You get a guy on second base, two outs and the batter hits a ball way up in the lights. The in­fielder loses the ball in the lights, it comes down and drops at his toes. runs scores. Earned run." 
"I always could've sworn they paid me on my wins and losses," he said. 
Blue Jays manager Cito Gas­ton admits that Morris has given up a few runs. No that it matters. 
"Actually, I don't think Jack's numbers are all that good as far as ERA," he said. "But ex­cept for Jack, we wouldn't be here." 
"He's the kind of guy who if you put up a couple of early runs and he knows he needs to hold you to those, he will," Gas­ton said.

And Smoltz didn't shut down just Barry Bonds, a leading contender for the NL Most Valuable Player who's been anything but Mr. October. Bonds was 0 for 3 but had plenty of company from the rest of the Pirates, who have scored all of two runs in their last four playoff games against the Braves' young guns of Smoltz, Steve Avery and Tom Glavine.

current pitcher with 30 or more innings. Sid Bream, the former Pirate who cried when he left the team two years ago, scored the Braves' first run and drove in the second and Jeff Blauser hit a solo homer. 
Drabek was hurt badly by walks -and by Bream, one of his closest friends when the two were teammates. 
Bream singled with one out in the second for the game's first hit and Damon Berryhill walked on a 3-2 pitch one batter later. Mark Lemke, Atlanta's unlikely offensive star of the '91 World Series but a .226 hitter this season. hit a hard grounder up the middle that second baseman Lind knocked down just to the right of the bag.

A's swagger intact without Canseco 
TORONTO (AP) -Here come the Oakland A's marching into SkyDome, still full of swagger. 
There's Rickey Henderson, strutting in the dugout. There's ALCS Mark. McGwir~, 
swingmg hard m the batting cage. There's Dave Stewart, preparing his death stare in the clubhouse. 
There's another Athletics player in the outfield, singing "0, Canada" out loud, his voice echoing through the nearly empty ballpark. 
Yep, Oakland is ready for playoffs, as always. Only one thing is missing. 
Where's Jose? 
"Yes, it does seem strange to playing them in a big series without Jose Canseco," Toronto reliever Tom Henke said Tuesday, a day before Game 1. 
"I mean, this guy has hit some mammoth shots here," Henke said. "There are a lot of other great players in the game, but not many carry the aura that he does. H 
Nor do many carry teams or create commotions the way Canseco can. Canseco was the talk of baseball after his home run in the 1989 playoffs in Toronto landed in the top deck, near the windows of a hotel that overlooks left field. By comparison, his homer off the glassed-in restaurant in center field was a popup. 
His big bat was a fixture in the postseason from 1988-90, even though it wasn't always productive -he batted just

.156 in the World Series and was a little better at .273 in the playoffs. 
His big ego always was pre­sent at this time, too. He de­lighted in holding mass news conferences, once climbing into the stands in Cincinnati to hold court, and enjoyeo the crowds, once razzing fans in Boston after they taunted him with chants of "Ster-oids, Ster­oids." 
It seemed like both his power and personality would be on display this October, at least until one of the most stunning trades in baseball history, the one that sent Canseco to Texas on Aug. 31 for Ruben Sierra, Jeff Russell and Bobby Witt. 
Now, the 1\s are back in the playoffs for the fourth time in five years, and Canseco is back home. It just doesn't seem like old Oakland without him, does it? 
"It may seem odd to you, not to me," Henderson corrected. "What's so odd about it? I mean, things change. Life changes." 
Well, what about it, Dave Henderson? You were the guy who played in center field, next to Jose in right, for all those Oakland pennant winners. 
"Man, I've played in a lot of big games where Jose Canseco wasn't on my team," he said. "You play in baseball 10 or 12 years. you get to play with a lot of players. I don't see anything strange about it."

Women's soccer gets a breather against Loyola 
Special to the Observer 
The Notre Dame women's soccer team a gets a rest of some sorts as it takes on Loyola tonight at 5:00 on Alumni Field. 
After facing four nationally ranked opponents in eight days, the Ramblers give the Irish somewhat of a breather as they begin their Midwestern Collegiate Conference schedule. 
Notre Dame suffered three defeats during the four game stretch, but the one win over Wisconsin was called "the biggest in the history of Notre Dame women's soccer" by Irish coach Chris Petrucelli. 
It is the first season of play for Loyola, which holds a 2-8 record (0-2 in the MCC) 
"They have given up a lot of goals and haven't been able to score many," said Petrucelli about Loyola. "It will give us a good opportunity to get some players some time." 
An additional fact which won't he! p the Ramblers is that the Irish currently have no players suffering from serious injuries. 
"We are the healthiest we've been all year," added Petrucelli. "None of the players are injured seriously enough where it will effect their play." 
BY TIMOTHY SEYMOUR Sports Writer 
With most teams already more than halfway through their four game regular season schedule, intensity in interhall football games will be high this weekend, each team aiming to make the playoffs, which are only a few weeks away. 
Zahm 24, Sorin 0 
Zahm ran its record to 3-0 by trouncing Sorin (1-2). Big plays were the key to the Zahm victory, as junior Rick Rios caught a 45 yard touchdown pass from sophomore quarter­back Chris Hammond, who later connected with Pete Corry for another six. The ground game was also effective for Zahm, as team captain Matt Seng broke a 30 yard touch­down run for the third touch­down. 
OC 6, Grace 0 
Off-Campus, aided by a strong effort from its defense, improved to 2-1 by blanking Grace (1-2). Behind the stellar play of noseguard Tom Minis­calco and the linebacking trio of Tom Pitstick, Matt Carr, and Matt Davis, OC limited the tal­ented Grace backfield of quar­terback Tim Slentz and half­back Steve Romine to only one first down. 
OC coach Keith McKeon blamed his team's lack of scoring on inopportune

turnovers, but noted that the offense has been steadily "improving" since the first week. OC scored the winning points on a creative play, as fullback Denny Morrissey throwing an option pass to Davis for the game's only touchdown. 
Alumni 20, Fisher 7 
Alumni evened its record at 1-1 and denyed Fischer (o-3) its first victory in a game that, as Alumni coach Paul Zackland noted, "was dominated by our offensive line." Using a patient, ball-control offense, Alumni wore down the opposing de­fense and then relied on quick­strike passing for its points. Patrick Bitter was on the re­ceiving end of a 50 yard bomb, and Tyrone Smoak scored on a slant pattern for the game's first two scores. Rob Hardi­son's 25 yard touchdown run, sprung by great downfield blocking by the Alumni re­ceivers, put the game out of reach, as Fischer managed its only score on a long, cut-back run late in the game. 
Carroll 28, St. Ed's 0 
St. Ed's (0-2) was held to negative yardage and Carroll moved to within a game of first place with a convincing victory inspired by quarterback Jon Oleksyk. Oleksyk threw to fel­low captain Jack Hay for a 20 yard score, connected with Anthony Laboe for 15 yards

and another touchdown, and ran 14 yards for a third. 
The Carroll defense was also dominating, as it re­covered a badly snapped punt deep in St. Ed's territory, which Dan Turner converted into points on a three yard run. The third touchdown was also set up off a turnover, as George Keegan intercepted a pass with one minute left in the first half, leading to Laboe's reception. 
Flanner 7, Dillon 6 
Planner stayed undefeated with its second victory by edg­ing Dillon (1-2). The differenGe in the game was a missed extra point after Dillon's first drive, which climaxed in a 1 yard run by Mike Fox. Planner later an­swered with a 60 yard quarter­back sweep and converted the extra point for the eventual margin of victory. Dillon had a chance at more points late in the game, but Planner recov­ered a fumble at its own 40 yard line with three minutes left and ran out the clock. 
Keenan 7, Morrissey 0 
Keenan went to 2-1 by shut­ting out Morrissey (1-2). Both team's defenses played well, but Keenan's Dave Dettore broke the game open with a long run for the game's only score. Morrissey coach Jamie McMillan noted that his team drove well the entire game, but lamented the two fumbles in Keenan territory that prevented his team from getting on the board.

Saint Mary's soccer loses
Irish volleyball attacks Indiana St. 
BY DAN PIER Sports Writer 
Now that the Notre Dame vol­leyball team has its own game running smoothly. coach Debbie Brown wants her charges to concentrate on attacking their opponents' weaknesses. The Irish did just that last night, defeating Indiana State 15-7, 15-6, 15-12 at the Joyce ACC. 
"I was encouraged by the fact that we told them in practice which shots would be open, and they really worked hard to hit them in the game," Brown said of her hitters. "We were going for the deep corner, and we hit quite a few balls just out, but I encouraged them for at least trying to do what we worked 
on." 
Notre Dame (13-2) started slowly and fell behind the Sycamores (7-9) 5-1 in game one. Christy Peters led a comeback, however, tallying six kills as the Irish took control. Brett Hensel served up an ace to finish off the game. 
Notre Dame got off to a 9-3 lead in the second game. Outside hitter Marilyn Cragin and middle blocker Jessica Fiebelkorn led an efficient of­fensive attack which pounded out 23 kills and committed just 6 errors. Cragin and Fiebelkorn had 6 kills apiece in the game en route to leading the team with 13 each for the match. Those two seniors have been among the six offensive players who have seen a lot of action so far for the Irish.

footing in loss to Kalamazoo 

BY MAGGIE HELLRUNG 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's sports are having the kind of season that would make the average sports fan cringe. Following the lead of Irish football last Saturday, Saint Mary's soccer lost their footing against Kalamazoo Tuesday night 2-0. 
"The girls played extremely strong in the first half," said coach Tom Van Meter. "It was just one of those situations where we just ran out of gas." 
The Belles had a strong hold on Kalamazzo first half. out­shooting them and keeping a strong defense. The situation was not quite as bright in the second half. as the Belles fell off guard, allowing Kalamazoo to cash in with two goals. 
"We've gotten into the habit of relying on one or two players to do the job, said VanMeter. "The girls are becoming watchers instead of participants." 
The Belles were set back after St. Thomas put an end to their undefeated season, beat­ing them 1-0 last Saturday. 
Kalamazoo, however. had a clear advantage over the Belles. For the past two years Kalamazoo has represented this area in the NCAA tourna­ment. 
"Life is more difficult now in terms of getting a post-season bid," said Van Meter. 
Saint Mary's faces Division III Wooster College at 3:00 Satur­day afternoon and Division III Denison University at 12:00 on Sunday. Wooster is ranked second in the region this sea­son, and Denison is tied with Kalamazoo in the rankings. The final scores to these two crucial games will decide whether or not the Belles have a shot at a post-season bid. 
The overall reaction for the Belles is disappointment, but the loss to Kalamazoo gives the team incentive to work hard this week in preparation for the weekend. 
"This week we will have to concentrate more on our sup­porting attack," said VanMeter. "The girls have to work a lot

Cavanaugh defeats Keenan in first 
reduce
round of interhall soccer playoffs 
By KEVIN JANICKI Sports Writer 
After compiling a 4-0 regular season record. the Cavanaugh men's interhall soccer team continued its win streak into the playoffs with a 1-0 opening round victory over Keenan yes­terday. 
Cavanaugh goalie Pat Robin­son registered his fifth shutout in as many games. 
Both teams played solid de­fense throughout the match until Tim Williamson put Ca­vanaugh ahead within the first five minutes of the game by placing a hard shot into the up­per left corner of the net from forty feet out.

Carroll finished the regular season at 4-0 with a 3-0 victory over Zahm B on Thursday. Rudy Christopher scored two goals while Tom Leahy added one for Carroll.

RICH KURZ 
Eye in the Sky 
What happened to the mystique of the stadium? 
Something a little bit unnerving has 
been going on over at Notre ~a~e 
Stadium lately, and it's been bmldmg 
ever since two years ago, when we first 
lost to Stanford at home. 
Since that time, of the last seven 
games the Irish have not won (that 
means ties, too), five of them have 
come at home. That doesn't happen to 
championship football teams. 
The hated Miami Hurricanes have a 
48-game home-win streak, and even 
Notre Dame tradition supports that 
premise. For nine seasons, from 1942 
through the 1950 season, the Irish won 
28 straight home games. And four 
national championships. 
This has been the rule even during 
the Lou Holtz era. After a close-24­
19-loss to Penn State in Holtz' first 
year at Notre Dame, the Irish didn't 
lose another game at home until that 
fateful loss to Stanford two seasons 
ago, which very nearly ended the Irish 
national championship hopes for that 
season-until a home loss to Penn State 
did. 
Nineteen games in a row at Notre 
Dame Stadium ended in an Irish victory 
at home during that streak, which saw 
one national championship and a close 
second-place finish. 
Dominance like that at home is what 
causes visiting opponents to pack it up 
in the fourth quarter and give up. 
When opponents walk into a stadium 
full of nearly 60,000 screaming fans, 
with the knowledge they are about to 
play in the house that Ro~kne ~uil~, 
home to 11 national champiOnships, It 
certainly gives Notre Dame an edge. 
Or at least it did until Stanford 
stunned the Irish at home two years 
ago. That planted a seed in the mind of 
opposing players. Notre Dame coul~ b.e 
beaten at home. So Penn State did It 
and Tennessee rallied to defeat Notre 
Dame as well. Teams weren't packing 
it in in the fourth quarter any more. 
In 1989, the Irish were 6-0 and 
number one, and behind late to the 
Trojans. Everyone in the Stadium knew 
the Irish would come from behind, 
even USC. There was no way Tony Rice 
wouldn't drive the Irish to score and 
win the game.The same thing 
happened in Rick Mirer's first game as 
a starter, versus Michigan in 1990. 
Teams just didn't come in and beat 
Notre Dame at home. 
But now with the gloss taken ofT after 
a number of home losses visitors have 
heart instead of fear in the final 
moments of the game. The intimidating 
home-field edge the Irish has had in 
years past has disappeared. 
If the Irish are to regain their spot at 
the top of the polls, the place to be~n 
is at home. Until Notre Dame regams 
that hard-won home-field advantage, a 
national championship will be a tough 
goal to reach.

Smash-mouth football returns as the Irish regroup 
BY MIKE SCRUDATO Sports Editor 
Smash-mouth football is back. . .. . 
Irish coach Lou Holtz said yesterday that the team IS gomg to go back to the things we really believe in." This means running the football. . Holtz believes that his team has had to rely too much on big 
plays throughout the first five games of the season. "We don't need to make great plays, we just need to play great " Holtz explained. . 
"when we throw the ball 28 to 30 times a game, that IS not us. That is not the way great teams win. Great games are won by defense and controlling the football. . . 
"You can't control the ball without falling I?to a rhythm, and it's easier to get in that rhythm with the runmng game than the passing game." . f Holtz believes that this big play reliance could be the cause o the Irish's second-half swoons over the past three seasons. . 
"We would go into the game wanting to knock a team out m the first half. We played so well in the first half of the fo~r losses (against Stanford in 1990 and this year, Penn .state ~n 1990 and Tennessee in 1991) that when. we made a m.Istake m the second half and put ourselves in a bmd, we weren t able to regroup " Holtz said. 
"From' this point forward, we're not looking for the knockout. We're looking to go all 15 rounds." 
Another change in the Irish offense could be the use of t~e second-team, which Holtz plans to use for "a series or two" m the first half for the remainder of the season. . 
The second unit, though, has to show Holtz that they. Will not 

turn the ball over, not miss assignments, not get pe~alized ~nd play with a lot of emotion and toughness to earn Its playmg time. 1 d 
"In the past, at North Carolina State and Arkansas, ~ p a~e, two offensive teams in both halves. It's something I believe m, Holtz commented. 
Holtz gave two reasons for the move. . 
"It's not bad to have your first team on the bench ~atch1~g other people perform, as long as those people are domg their job. Also, when guys know they're going to play on Saturday, 
The Observer/Pat McHugh Jerome Bettis and the rest of the Irish backfiel? will get more chances to run the ball as the Irish return to their smash-mouth football of the past. . 
their practice intensity increases," the seventh-year coach .sm~. 
"I've never seen the second unit practice as well as It did yesterday," Holtz added. "I expect that team to move the football." . 
A few second-teamers could also see time With the first team,

Men's soccer expecting another Atlant~'s gamble pays   off 1n game one
physical game agamst Detroit victory 
BY JASON KELLY Sports Writer 
It will be a typical Midwestern Collegiate Conference men's soccer game. . . 
When Detroit Mercy visits Alumm Field tonight to face Notre Dame, they wi.ll bring the physical style of play that IS common in the MCC. 
They will also bring the second-leading scorer in the conference, Stephan Glover. 
"Everytime we play them it's very physical and we're expect!ng ano_the~ tough game," Irish coach M1ke Berticelli said. "They also have two or three dangerous players that we will have to keep in check to win the game." 
The Irish have some dangerous players of their own, however. 
After his hat trick Sunday against 
Dayton, freshman Bill L~nz~ no~ has four goals this season, which ~Ies him for the team lead with junior Mike Palmer and senior Kevin Pendergast. 
With a break or two, all three players could have several more goals alr~a.dy this season. Those missed opportumt~es have been a major problem as the Insh have stumbled to a 5-4-1 start, with a 2­
1 mark in the MCC. 
With five sophomores and three freshmen in the starting lineup, inexperience is a big factor as the y0 u n g e r pIayers try to a dj ust to t h e college game. . , 
"It (youth) is definitely a maJor factor, 
Berticelli commented. "Sometimes the younger guys are looking for a perfect opportunity, but they have to learn that it's okay to make mistakes as long as 
they're aggressive. . 
Young or not, the Irish h~~e still missed some scoring opportumties that could have changed the complexion of the season. But with eight games 

Bill Lanza 
remaining before the MCC tournament, there is still time to improve. 
"We've had a whole bunch of chances, but sometimes that net can seem pretty small after you've been hammering away at it," Berticelli said. "Our concern tonight is to finish the way we are capable of finishing." 
Defensively, the Irish have proven that they can handle some of the best players in the country. Olympian Joe-Max Moore of UCLA and the MCC's leading scorer Doug Tegge of Xavier were both held scoreless by the Irish defense and sophomore goalkeeper Bert Bader is just seven shutouts away from the Notre Dame career record. 
But the defense has been steady this year and the offense remains Berticelli's main concern. 
"We can't get away with being tentative," he explained. "They (the younger players) have to learn to take risks and convert the tough chances, that's what wins games." 
Notre Dame owns the series against the Titans with a 7-1 record since the series began in 1987. Detroit's last win came in 1990, when they defeated the Irish 2-0 at Moose Krause Stadium. 
ATLANTA (AP) -Atlanta's gamble with John Smoltz wasn't so risky after all. 
Smoltz, a right-hander who struggle~ through September, added to P~tts~urgh s Octgher wpes Tuesday night, ~Itching the NLCS Braves to a 5-l victory over 
...:..;;=..;;;;..;;---the Pirates in the first game of the National League playoffs. 
Smoltz held the heavy-hitting Pirate lineup scoreless until Jose Lind led ofT the eighth with a home run to left field. That ended Pittsburgh's postseason scorel~ss 
streak at 29 innings, one shy of the maJor 
league record. 
Now the Pirates must come from a game down if they are to avoi~ becomi~g the first team since the Phlladelphta Phillies of the late 1970s to win three consecutive NL East titles without advancing to the World Series. 
Braves manager Bobby Cox gambled perhaps the whole series .by starting Smoltz against the predommantly left­handed-hitting Pirates, and was rewarded. Smoltz gave up just four hits before Mike Stanton took over in the ninth and gave up a two-out double to Jeff King before striking out Orlando Merced. 
"I thought the game plan I had coming in, it ended up working," Smoltz said. "I kept the guys off base ahead of (Andy) Van Slyke and Bonds, and didn't allow them to get a big inning going. I got. out of the gate good, but I stiffened up a httle bit late and was able to get a five-run cushion." 
Smoltz who shut out the Pirates 4-0 on six hits in Game 7 last fall, didn't allow a hit until Lind's two-out infield single in the fifth. 
The NL strikeouts leader was even more overpowering than he was in beating Pittsburgh twice last October. He struck out six and allowed only one runner as
