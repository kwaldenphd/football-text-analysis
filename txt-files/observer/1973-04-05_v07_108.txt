Goerner declines teaching a'Ward 

by Ed Ellis 
Notre Dame Government Professor Edward t\. (:oerner has refused to accept the most recent Sheedv Award for excellence in teaching. (;oen{er's action, taken in a letter to Arts and Letters College Dean Frederick Crosson, is in reaction to the University Academic Council's refusal to require that nominees to the position of University Provost be approved by the elected Pm mhers of the Council. 
Included in Goerner's letter to Crosson was the thousand dollar check awarded him last Fall as the winner of the award. 
While he refused to accept both the award and the money. Goerner indicated his gratitude to hoth the donor of the award and the committee that ehose him. "I in no way scorn him or his intentions," the Government prof stated. "It is a gn'at sum both in itself and to a man in my finaneial circumstances." 
However. Goerner said his refusal was based on the fact that "Honors conferred by despotisms dishonor the recipient and whatever good or truth he stands for ... " 
Goerner had originally proposed in debate last fall on the Faculty Manual that the University Provost be nominated with the concurrence of the Plected members of the Council, a motion that \\'<lS approved after brief debate. 
In the Council's March 27 meeting, however, that action was reversed at the insistence of llnivC'rsity President Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh, who ~·eilded the chair at the meeting to speak against the concurrence clause in the revised 1\lanual. Despite the arguments of Goerner and ol her nwmbers of the body, Hesburgh 's action succeededby a 28 to 15 vote. 
In the same meeting, the Council made nwndatory College Council approval forthe ;1ppoinlment of college deans, an action lll'sburgh did not oppose. According to Goerner, this action does not replace the loss of the provosts' approval because, he argues, "The dt'nns are not University officers in the same way that the president and provost are. They do not sit on the Board of Trustees and they are subject to <lclions from the president and the prO\'OS!. 
(;oerner's objection to the Council's action is hased upon a conception of the University as a eommtmitv of scholars. 
"The life of learning," he commented in h!s l£'tler to Crosson. "can only be governmed· tiy men who live the vocation to such a life and not hv nwn who. drawn to other lives and objects, d~'lude themselves into thinking that thier strong wills are suitable governors of a community's seaJTh for truth and love for wisdom." 
lkcause of the Council's action, Goerner ;u·gued that "the community of scholars can be nalt'd hy officers that may be flatly unacceptable Io iI." 
Characterizing the present organization of the l rnivt'J'sity as "despotic," the Government Professor noted. "The President thinks such a pmn•r to impose flatly unacceptable officers must be retained at the cetner of our public law." 
(;ot'rner said vesterrlav that he did not oppose llw fat· I that gi·ea I , . . 1ritv is placed in the hands of the President and !'.__.Provost. He said that it was •wressarv. howeYer. he argued that the nnlv wav to susl<;in that authority for a great h•nglh ~lf ti1iw is hy asking for the consent of the l!nn'rnnwd p<lrlies, in this ease the faculty and studt'nls. 

Cr·ossorl 
"The President and Provost must have big authorilv." he stated," but the only way they can get it is· by consent." 
"Tiw Vniversity officers have looked upon any altl'mpl to require consent as a threat to their authoritv," Goerner continued, "The only way wide-rat;ging authority can be sustained over the long nm is through this consent." 
"Wt• must convert the University officers to the role of leaders of the community rather that I hat of drover." 
Goemer was also critical of the amount of authority that resides in the Board of Trustees with no ·..balance on the faculty side." He said that this meant "the people who are spending lhPir lives in this place can't be trusted with the authority to govern it. 'The authority must be givPn to Chicago lawyers." 
<'mTPntly before the Academic Council is a Fantltv S~nate resolution that would place six facullv members on the Board of Trustees, the group· that appoints both the president and the provost. 
<; ot•mer contended yesterday that such action would likPiy make the governamce situation more shapeless than is already. Faculty nwmhers are elected and appointed to so many hodit's now. he said, that the faculty input would I){' more personal input than representative input. 
ln a separate letter released yesterday, <;ot'nl£'r informed Academic Council Secretary Fr. Fl'rdinancd Brown that he might not par­tidpal£' in further Council deliberations. 
,\flt•r defining to Brown the vacation of the professor as a "searcher after truth," Goerner slatl'd. "The character of that vocation ... seems to nw to he such as not to admit that the search he gnvenwd by men who have not responded to that \'ncalion ... " 
"Tlw Aeademic Council." he continued, "has defim'ci itself as a body that rejects a conception of tht' llnivl'rsity as a community in a common s<'an·h for truth and a common love for wisdom .. 
"A hndv that so t·onceives itself necessarily t•xdudPs ·anvone who thinks as I do snce we nmnot ht' P~JX'ded to deny hy our deed of par­lit·ipation in such a Council what we take to be trllt' and t<'ach hv our words." 
Twn-h'rm st.udent Academic Council n•pn'sentative Frt'd Guiffrida concurred with <;m•rnpr's analysis on the campus situation and tlw stah' of lht' t·ommunity. 
"H tlw rPturn nf this award is Professor (;ot'nwr·s nwans of indicating his displeasure, tlwn that's his judgmt'nt." said Guiffrida. 
l'nin•rsilv Pl·ovost Fr. James T. Burtchaell was unavai.lahll' for t•omment last night. Ih•<J n ( 'rosson is out of I own and will not return unt i I tlw wt•t'kt•nd. 
March 28, 1973 
Dean Frederick J. Crosson! 
Dear Fred Enclosed you will find the check for one thousand dollars which is 'he material tok~ of the Sheedy Award for excellence.~ teaching. I c1o not know whether you can understand the depth of .-.y sadness in hewing to say that I cannot accept the award. However, I write what follows in an attempt to make my refusal at least comprehensible to vou and ~ the community. Shortly before the ceremony for the presentation of the award was to take place last fall, I telephoned you to say that developments in the rc.vision of he Faculty Manual by the Academic Council made me think that I had better not accept the award. More specifically, I said that the Council seemed to be moving in the direction of confirming the status of thefaculty as a body of "Uncle Toms," a status that seems to be no good for either black men or professors. That seemed to be fhe direction the Council was taking in affirming a structure of .University governance in which the University was to be ruled by <lfficers to ~hich the faculty did not consenr~..'••1 did not see how I could participate in a celebration of teaching without speaking about the proceedings in the Council, of which I was a member, that were tending to the definition of teaching as a. vocation to servility. ·I did not think that a seemly thing to do and so I asked you to let the whole ,,ward be quietly forgotten. So it was not without some irony and surprise that. the day before .~·he Sheedy Award ceremony was to have taken place, the Academic .Council accepted my motion ,to provide that the Provost of the University not be appointed without the concurrence of the elected mcn,bersof the Academic Council. I thought to myself that my proud pre-judging of the outcome of the Council's deliberations had been suitably punished by my loss of the award. .So it was with no small surprise that, shortly before Christmas, I received a note from you including the check for the Sheedy Award. Tl1inking there must have been a misunderstanding, I returned it only fo·discover that you were off in India for a long stay. Dean Plunkett ,,ssured me that there was no mistake, that the award was to be given without the ceremony and he sent me the check again a few days iater. It has lain on my desk since, while I wondered whether I could rightly ti'lke the money without having participated in the public ,cei.C'bration of teaching for which the money was intended, .U~14tt"Ony a~d reversals were not yet over. On Tuesday, March 27, Tf1!!--.t:ildemf'c Council, at the urging of Father Hesburgh, reversed itstlf, e~mending its text of the Faculty Manual again so as to elimine~te the provision, I mentioned. Once again the community of scholars Celn be ruled by officers that may be flatly unacceptab!e to it hnd' the President thinks such a power to impose flatly unacceptable officers must be retained at the center of our public law. A com· m u.ni ty so governed is despotic. ·,Well, if I; e~s a teacher of politics, ever taught anything worthy of being honored tor it would include the proposition that honors con­tcrrcd by despotisms dishonor the recipient and whatever goods or trut11 he stands lor. Shall I deny that and celebrate servility by my deed in e~ccepting this check? ;-rt ·a , as el teacl'l·er, ever taught anything about learning1worth Y of llcing honored for it would surely include the proposition that the life of learning can only be governed by men who live the vocation to such ,\ liie f1'l.!110f by men, who, drawn to lther lives and objects, deluge t'hc'811•se1ves into thinking that their strong wills are suttable gover­nors of a commuiity's search for truth and love of wisdom. Shall I now, by e~ccepting this award from a University so governed, affirm in c1Jcd what I denied in word? Such a teacher would be worthy of no t10nor at all. r know, Fred, that in some respects the Sheedy Award need not be ~ccn as cln honor from a despotic regime. You were right to point out rome Ihat it we~s in fact the gift of a generous donor ans was voted to n1·, lJy n committee of faculty and students and not by a committee of trustees clnd administrators.• And I wish, by this letter, to com­nwnicilte to them (who they are I don't know} this explanation of my olCt. I wish the donor to know that I in no way scorn flis intentions nor the hc1ndso~nc and generous sum he gave. It ~sa great sum both in itself .md toil n)itn in my financial circumstances. And I am grateful to him tor hii' h'clving offered it. I wish those who voted it to me to know that I dearly hope they knew 
1 
whc1t sort of a man they voted it to. If they did, lean at least be glad to think they will understand my refusal. Perhaps they witt even agree that. in IIH? present circumstances of this place, the best celebration of tf'ach ing clnd of the love for the truth must be in a steadfast refusal of .1 d(>gradinq servility. If I can still teach anything in this matter, let it hf' h" f'ncouraging us not to be so embittered by the need tor refusal as not to wish for, work for, and greet with joy, if it comes, aregime that ,, tree mcin and Cl scholar can support without Shame.

Shaffer speaks lor Life group 
Ind. abortion bill unsatisfactory 
by David Rust Staff Reporter 

Dean Thomas Shaffer of th: Notre Dame Law School an nounced yesterday mor :ting tLt: St Joseph County Right to Life Committee's position that the abortion restriction bill presently before the Indiana Senate is un­satisfactory. 
Reading a press release from the anti-abortion group that claims over 500 members county-wide, Dean Shaffer reviewed Right to Life's ten points the Committee felt must be contained in any abortion bill passed by the Indiana legislature. 
He told newsmen before he began that "I'm not a member of Right to Life. I'm not endorsing fllese proposals; I'm merely an­no1lllcing them." 
~n asked where he differed with ~ Committee, Shaffer ex­plain~,· 'I don't want to push this thing. . If we can get some agreemen\. on these points in the Senate, fina But i don't want to push so harcAhat no bill is passed. Any bill is bet~r than none at all." 
At present, sa1d Shaffer, Indiana is without an' legal stricture on abortion, its pNor abortion laws struck down by the celebrated Supreme Court ~ision of last 
February. 
Indiana's Senate recently passed SB 334 which contained many of Right to Life's ten poir1ts, bur the House amended it by deletion of several provisions and sent it back to the Senate, where it now awaits passage. 
Right to Life's strat~gy ,ex­plained Shaffer, is to contact ligislators all over the state in a "Last-ditch effort" to add amendments to the bill. 
Shaffer felt most strongly about the present bill's nod to saline abortions. "Saline abortions" are 
into the mother's womb, which poisons the fetus and burns away its skin. Shaffer called this method "(~ross and barbaric." 
Hight to Life's ten points would ban this kind of abortion. They would also: 
-Establish a committee ap­pointed by each local Board of Health to determine which trimester of pregnancy a can­didate for abortion is in, since the Supreme Court's law "is so dependent upon the trimester condept," and there is presently no mechanism provided in the Senate bill by which the state may determine if a criminal abortion has been performed; 

-Require written consent for any abortion from both parents of the fetus; 
-Prohibit a minor from receiving an abortion unless there is valid fear for her life; 
-Require all aborted fetuses to be buried by a licenses mortician; 
-not repeal former abortion laws affected by the Supreme Court's decision. 
"The legislature appears to have been influenced by its own legal counsel," said Shaffer explaining the opposition facing these provisions. "The legislators have been convinced that their present bill is the most restrictive the Supreme Court will allow, and they don't want to have any bill of theirs struck down. 
"But I haven't heard one legislator of this session speak in favor of liberal abortion," said Shaffer. 

POWs' :morale bolstered by ND Victory March 
by Art Ferranti Staff Reporter 
Prisoners of war in Vietnam hummed or whistled "The Notre Dame Victory March" to keep up their morale, it was leaned yesterday from reports coming out of the debriefing sessions for American prisoners. 
A Pentagon spokesman said that the song was hummed or whistled as a sign of deviance by American POW's in the Hanoi Hilton and other prisoner camps. 
Since any attempt to sing, hum, or whistle "The Star Spangled Banner" or "America the Beautiful" resulted in beatings from the Communist guards, the prisoners resorted to "The Notre Dame Victory March," a song unknown to their captors. 
Capt. Jeremiah Denton, the first POW to be released, confirmed this report along with many others

who asked not to be named, said the spokesman. 
The song was composed in 1908 by Sorin Hall residents John and Michael Shea and was also known in World War II POW camps. Since the first time it was played in 1909 in the rotunda of Notre Dame's Administration Building, many other schools and colleges have adopted the song as their own. And now, the march has hit Vietnam.

Charges 'unfounded': Rybarczyk 
by Kathy Hessert Staff Reporter  
The Union called  newly ·instated Student Director, Jim Rybarczyk, allegations of corruption  

and deceit within the union "!.In­founded and undocumented," yesterday.• 
Social Commissinn ticke~ manager Kev!n" Krull Tuesday accused Ryparczyk of ~ithholdibg pertinent facts concerning·the dat.lo of his gra'du&tion during intervie"s for the post. Krvl! also cha~ed Rybar~zrk ·of. favoritislll' ~n commission ·appointments ftnO of attemptit~e to "take o~r" the SQdal Commission. 
In response to the accusation of withholdi~g the facts of his plans for graduation Ry~arczyk-com­merited, "nothing was witbtteld. I jtlst wasn'tasked. I asSllffied !hat everyone _in the . Stutient Union knew my ~tatuS." 
·According to Ryf>arczyk, it is acatletllic~l!Y pos.<Ible for him to graduate ml>ecember 1973 but he ha·~ no present p1ans to do so. 
"When registering with the Placement Blli-eau I filled out both summer and-permaner::t job ap­plications.· I haven'g as yet applied tb •any graduate schools fe.r J~nn.ary," Rybarczyk said. 
The p~_cement bureau sent out lJ:~tor~atiop and scheduled in,­:erviews -this· year for December 1972 or Mav 1973 graduates. D('cember 1~73 graduates were. given on-cctinpus interviews for permanet employment only with special permission from the em­ployer. In this circumstance the student must inform the employer that he is a December graduate. ~ Accordbg to Mr.. Richard Willame'n of the Placement' Bureau. "Jim Rybarczyk Is registered with the "bureau as a December ·1973 gradHate." 
In explaining the charge of patronizing, R_ybar~zyk,. stated,.. '"! didn't appoin.friends at; ii-Jends. K !\luth. AssoC'... DlrectOt of~tudent Union. Pete' Sohlander, Assistar.t Director. and ·. .Bob F~rhent>ack,. Comptroller. were the best qualified for the po!;i(1~m\."

Roland W. Chamblee, M.D., recently returned from volunteer service as medical physician in charge of Nuggalama _Hospital in 
Nakifuma,  Uganda,  spoke  last  
nig_ht ·on  "Health  Care  for  the  
People  of  the  World,"  to  an  

audience in the Center for Con­tinuing Education. In conjunction with the Arthur J. Schmitt challenges of Schience meetings of the College f science. 
Stressing that as a doctor and a classical witness to a travesty of medical ·care programs virtually non-functonal at the lowest levels where it was the most needed, Chamblee further stated that the effects of the absence of medical care are that most of the world's underpriviledged population is dying of treatable diseases. 
"There is no personnel or medicines to stop this," said C::hamblee, who was speaking in conjunction with the Arthur J. Sch­mitt Cahllenges of Science Meetings. "It is frustrating when you ~now that over one third of the world's population never receives any-relief from diseases that m·edicines can effectively flr~event," he continued. 
the need 
Citing the many problesm tha* arose during his year in Uganda, Chamblee went into some detail concernign the difficulties with transportastion, superstition, and inadequate facilities. 
Transportation, he believed, was one of the greatest obstacles faced by those Ugandan villagers who needPd medical treatment. 
Chamblee stated that it was not uncommon for some villagers to travel as much as 80 to 100 miles by foot, bicycle, taxi, or whatever form of transportation was available. He cited one case where a young man brought his wife in for an operation, wited until it was completed, and then left with his wife that night yraveling by bicylcle to his home 55 miles away. 
Chamblee ex­paaaaaaaaaaaalained that local witch doctors were useful in degating the superstitions fo his oatients. 

''The person best able," em­phasized Chamblee, "to get rid of superstitions was the witch doctor. He is the psychiatrist of Africa. It was not uncommon to see a witch doctor at the hospital to rid patients of ghosts and evil spirits." 
Arriving in September of 1972 in Uganda with his wife, Chamblee took over direction of the hospital in Nakifuma, Uganda.

"Yolu never run out of work in Africa, you just stop and begin another day with second class medicines and improvised equipment. You treat those who vou have lost even before you begin knowing that youlack the mdicines to stop them fromdying even as they thank you for helping them." 
"At the student level," stressed Chamblee, "what is needed is the building of the desire to work in underdeveloped countires. The 
sad fact today is that priority is given by many doctors on the dollar value of work over the responsibilities of practice for the sake of healing those in need. The progress to change must be with your generation or ti will not stand at all."

Be Salvaged? 

Watt•rgate has confronted every conscientious American. Rumors of tlw wtwds of James McCord's sworn testimony before Judge .John 1\it·iea. which allegedly connects several highly placed administration ,,ffit'ials with the Watergate scandal, has reached and disturbed many individuals' sense of integrity. 
President Nixon can not avoid perceiving America's abhorence and itH.·n•asingly vocal indignation. Nixon, himself, perhaps as uncertain and as doubtful of the actual facts as the rest of this land, now faces the hall h.• of convincing his highest officials along with the rest of the nation's populace that Watergate is not directly on his hands. But even as Nixon ('ndeavors to reassure, his highest aides are asking the extent of th(' administration's involvement in the Watergate affair. Hugh St·ott. Nixon's Senate Minority Leader, asked the President point hlank if he was involved in Watergate. The unequivocal reply came

Cross oilers free concert 
by Mike Kulczv .•l Staff Report~ 

Notre Dame's H4''.1 Cross Hall is resenting a fr,.. . concert Satur­ay, April 7, )'.:aturing the group Greenleaf" and the duo of Jim }resser 91d Bart Pollock. 
Hall r tesident Fred Baranowski escribed the 8 p.m. concert at the JD Holy Cross Hall Auditorium as "Hall activity, but we want to pen it up to the rest of the cam-
JUS." 

Baranowski explained that the roup "Greenleaf," made up of evin Dockrell, Milo Kosich, a trick Kronenwetter, and Harry Soze have been using the Holy Cross Auditorium to practice for the last month, have played at a few parties on campus, and now would like to "debut" for the entire campus. "Greenleaf" will also be performing at the An Tostal Concert. 
The concert is sponsored by the Holy Cross Hall Government, according to Baranowski, "because we noticed a lack of get­together events like this, that are free, that anyone can come to." He added that Holy Cross Hall would like to get the "ball rolling" for more hall-oriented activities which are for the benefit of all the students. 
Baranowski described "Greenleaf'' as a grou specializing in playing Stephe~Stills, Loggins and Messina, Poco, and Tom Rush; and Gresser and Pollack performing acoustic rna terial along the lines of Gordon Lightfoot. Baranows,i said, "We want to try to use the concert as a springboard to launch both groups for campus familiarity." 
Stressing that it is a free concert, Baranowski invited everhone to come. and added that food sales wouldbe open during the second half of the concert to provide refreshments. 

Paper plane passes-flight test 
by William Murphy Staff Reporter 

New York advertising agency lirector Richard Kline recently .haltered ·conventional terodynamic theory with a paper >lane of his own design. 
Time magazine covered Kline's ,tory and told how Kline and Dr. John Nicolaides of the Notre Dame . \erospace Department flew this 
1>aper plane from one ene of the 
:'-lotre Dame football field to the >ther. 
I 
Nicolaides said' at Notre Dame ast night that Kline was directed 
o him through a mutual friend and hat ,h(\ really has made a break hro1,1gh, although the plane was in 
·eality ·flown across the ACC! 1asketball arean, rather than the ·ootball field. 
In fluid-flow visualization tests in the Notre Dame wind tunnels, Nicolaides confirmed the fact that Kline's wing design is a breakthrough because it greatly reduces stalling. However, he said, no one really knows why. 
Nicolaides said he feels he has an obligation to bring the results of the tests to the attention of NASA and to suggest possible further study of the wing. 
A fbrmer NASA official, Nicolaides commented .s that he would be agreeable to a joint research project with NASA on the new wing design. "NASA might also be agreeable to this",said -Nicolaides, "because we have the best flow-visualization wind tunnels in the world here at Notre

"We could measure the fluid­fJow field and NASA could get the hft and drag data," he said. 
Nicolaides stated that he had not thought of any practical ap­plications for the new wing. He did 
. say, however, that the Department of the Navy had contacted him. "The Navy believes the new wing might be great for missles", said Nicolaides. 
"When a plane stalls the pilot can try to regain control but when a missle stalls its finished." 
In whatever application Kline decides to use his win, it has already achieved the distinction of being awarded U.S. patent No.

Bus shelter plans o:Jcayed 
by Terry Keeney Staff Reporter 
Plans for the design of a bus shelter at the bus stop near the Grotto were approved last week by the Campus Committee on En­vironment. The shelter, which is to be financed by student government funds, now faces f!nal ad­ministrative. approval. 
When asked how much the proposed shelter would cost, outgoing Student Government Treasurer Mike Marget could not· specify an exactlfigure. "The cost of the bus shelter varies depending on the materials used," Marget observed. 
Marg-et also noted that Student Government plans to work closely with the Administration in building the shelter. 
The shelter was designed by four fifth -year architectecture · students who design university improvements as part of an ac­credited architecutre course. In working . closely with the Com­mittee on Environment the four designers tried to preserve the esthetic surroundings -the Grotto and the lakes. 
In addition to the bus shelter, the 
architecture students have previously submitted plans to build a mini-park behind LaFortune student Center. Plans for the future include improving the service road that runs throughout the campus and revamping Old Juniper · Road which stretches from 0-Shaugnessy to the Towers.

·'he year was 1934, and Notre Dame was beginning to flourish. '<1ther Charles O'Donnell was then the University president, and two arc head administrators, Father John O'Hara and Father John v-anaugh, were teaching in the\school's religion department. Father ius Nieuwland was still receiving plaudits for his worlfwith synthetic 
· .ber. and an altar boys' society was one of the larger clubs on campus. .,he fall social season opened with khe sophomore, cotillion·, an affair 
· 1ch drew upwards of 400 couples, and the Notre Dame student radio lion formally opened that same year-by presenting a dramatization ;he founding of the University. .thletically, too, Notre Dame was coming into its own. Carroll Hall 1 the 1934 interhall football, and Badin and St. Ed's claimed the IH ;ketball titles. The year's football banquet was held in the south dining 
I. and the guest speaker, humorist Will Rogers, headed a program that d tribute to the late Knute Rockne. · 'he Irish grid fortunes were in the hands of coach Elmer Layden, ,tain Dominic Vairo, and players like Andy Pilney and Billy tkespeare. ND opened the '34 grid season with a 7-6loss to to the Texas 1ghorns, and closed it with a 14-o blanking of Southern Cal. Across 
campus. in the field house, coach George Keogan led his Irish .• '5ketball team to a 13-9 record. · ~'aced by captain Johnny .lorda_n,'the ND cagers hung close in nearly 
•ry game they played, and included wins over Marquette (23-20) and m<•sota cm-27) in their won-lost ledger. 'or Notre Dame. 1934 was a year for the status quo. Changes were n ing. hot h athletic and administrative, but they wf)uld wait until '35. 4 was a steady year for the Irish. 
·~ut there was one change made during '34. It Peceived scant attention he time. and rated only a couple of lines in The South Bend Tribune: larence C. <Jake) Kline was named head Notre Dame baseball coacH 
·ay by Elmer F. Layden, Director of Athletics." 'oday. some 40 years later, that change has become anything but in­nifkant. Jake Kline has remained as Notre Dame's head baseball .ch through every one ofthose ~0 years. and during the past several sons his endurance has placed him among the elite of college baseball. .ast season. four games· from the end of their campaign, the Irish mt'd Bowling Green. 5-l, and gave Kline his 5oqth career victory. 
·..'"72 squad won two more games following the milestone win over Sll. and this year's team. with a p<1ir·1 of victories on its spring trip, de Kline the coach who guided the ND baseball program to the 1,000­' plateau. 
la\·ing reached both of those impressive vicr,ry totals might have Jbcd Kline's career of any concrete future ~oals, but the 78-year old 
· t'ran isn't conceding any such thing. ·J told the players after we wontwodown at Tulsa," he remembered, wt ,n,·vc only got 496 to go to reach my second 500." But then he <.'ktracked. "No. seriously, I was never aiming at any goals; and if I 
s. my only goal was to have fun. I'm one of thoese guys who doesn't go 
~'king for publicity." ~ut P\·cn though he hasn't tried to cultivate it, Jake has generated a ,d deal of publicity in recent years. He was elected to college s<•hall's IJail of Fame in 1968, and las~ year was forced to ride a wave of in•nwnt talk. He survived it all, though, and is back this year-ready :wgin his 40th rt'gularseason cam(iaign at Cartier Field.

. this past season. He holds the varsity records in both the 200­yard <2:07.2) and 400-yard (4:37.1) individual medley.

Sophomore James G. Kane of Owings Mills, Md. was named the 
Irish sailors 2nd at Purdue 
The Notre Dame Sailing team beat eight schools in a storm· tossed, 20-race regatta held this past weekend on Purdue's Lake Schaeffer. Wisconsin took first place in the regatta, followed by 

Notre  Dame  and  Indiana  
University.  
On  Saturday  morning  the  

winds were whipping out of the northeast at 25 mph, and forced the races to be postponed on one oc­casion. But ten schools braved the weather to begin the regatta. In the first race Notre Dame's Kevin Hoyt was in excellent position to win when his crew--Bruce Marek-­fell overboard while hiking to keep the boat flat. This misfortune did not stop the Irish, though, as Hoyt came back to win the next A­Di\'ision'race. But in the fourth A­Division race a first place finish was disallowed when it was determined that Hoyt had touched the windward mark while roun­ding. Wisconsin jumped to a sizeable lead and a host of other schools threatened NO's position. 
Meanwhile, in B-Division, Will Donelan was sailing a consistent series that kept the team in serious l'ontention and earned low-point skipper honors in B-Division. But the Badger lead was large and the lighter-air sailing on Sunday morning saw Notre Dame narrow the gap, only to clinch second place. 
J\.•::ro sailing for ND were .Jon~ 1\IaktPlski Bill Reed, Rob Gaw, and hteky Banasiak. 
This ~eekend the Notre Dame team v.,,-4 compete in separate regattas ~·· &owling Green and at Ball State.
