sponsors forum 


tonight 
Jake Morrissey Staff Reporter 

A Student Government Forum will be held tonightat6:30 p.m. in the LaFortune Ballroom. "Its purpose," according to Dave Bender, student body president, "is to allow students to voice their complaints. During the campaign, people told us that the student go\·emment doesn't give students an opportunity to talk to them. The 
forum is one way of fighting this." 
Some topics that Bender antici­pates will be considered are: student justice, student parking regulations, noise in the library, and the problems confronting· area bars and their owners. 
Bender, however, is quick to add that "there are a lot of talented people here at Notre Dame. I think we should give them a chance to articulate their views." 
Any student able to attend is urged to do so. 
aides said that there had been "a constructive and useful discussion of U.S.-Soviet relations, which included strategic arms limitation." Attending the session, Carter's first with Dobrynin since the break­down in weapons negotiations, were Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance, national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and Robert Hunter of the National Security Council staff, who took notes. Emphasizing the meeting's im­portance, White House spokesman Rex Granum said the two sides "were anxious to meet" in order to update U.S.-Soviet relations. . Dobrynin's call was arranged 
agenda, a possible topic for discus­sion was sending Paul C. Warnke, the U.S. arms control chief, to Geneva this month to renew wea­pon discussions before Vance meets with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko in May. 
The two sides have yet to !>'et a precise date for the Vance­Gromyko talks, which are likely to be critical in the effort to reach an agreement to limit nuclear wea­pons and take some steps toward general disarmament. 
Carter has said if they are unproductive and the Soviets do not negotiate "in good faith" he would be forced to consider step­ping up U.S. weapon development.

Last of the burglars 
Liddy sentence commuted 
WASHINGTON [AP]  President Carter commuted the 20-year pri­son sentence of Watergate burg­lary mastermind G. Gordon Liddy to eight years yesterday "in the interests of equity and fairness." 
Thus, the 46-year-old Liddy will be eligible for parole on July 9 after having served a tptal of SO months. Thirty-two months of that time counts toward his main sentence; the other 18 months were for refusing to testify before the Watergate grand jury. 
"I'm grateful to the President for commuting my sentence and bring­ing it into line with the sentences received by Mitchell, Haldeman, Ehrlich man and Hunt," Liddy told his lawyer, Peter Maroulis. 
/!>. prison official said that after Liddy was informed of the commu­tation, "he was smiling and looking 
· better than I've seen him. He told me, 'Now I've got what the rest of them have got."· apparently a reference to the shortened se:t­tences of the others. 
Liddy's wife had just ended a visit with her husband at the Allenwood, pa., minimum security institution and heard about the commutation on the radio-while driving home. 
"She told me, 'Thank God,"' Maroulis said. · 
Once Liddy is released, all the participants in the June 17, 1972, burglary at Democratic party head­quarters in the Watergate office building will be free. · 
E. Howard Hunt, Liddy's lieute­nant in the botched burglary, was released Feb. 24 after serving 32 months and now is on the lecture circuit. James W. McCord, the burglary squad's electronics ~an, served four months and moved to Colorado. The foot soldiers in Watergate, four Cubans from Miami served slightly more than one year each and recently received $200,000 from Richard Nixon's re-election committee as settle­ment for being duped. 
But John d. Ehrlichman, the second-ranking Nixon aide con­victed of covering up the Water­gate affair, is serving a minimum 21/2-year sentence in Arizona. Former Atty. Gen. ·John N. Mitchell and H.R. Haldeman. Nixon's chief of staff, are awaiting Sniegowski who will be on leave next year. Freshman Composition and Literature was directed by Sniegowski, Freshman Seminar by Frederic Syburgh, and Humani­ties Seminar by Dr. Joseph Duffy. Both Syburgh and Duffy will be assisting Kline next year. 
·'The creation of one post from three will eliminate, not create, bureaucracy, and also simplify operations." Kline said. 
Kline plans to make available to teaching assistants in the Fresh­man Seminary Program a course in teaching writing and grammar. Although the course will be manda­tory for all teaching assistants majoring in English, all teaching assistants will be encouraged to attend. 
The goal of the Department of Freshman Writing is to increase the writing skills of Notre Dame students. 
Get your Dome! 
The 1977 Dome will be distri­buted today through Friday, from 1 to S p.m. in the parking lot behind the Huddle. Students should first bring their ID card to the LaFor­tune Ballroom an~ pick up an IBM card. The IBM card should then be exchanged for a yearbook at the trucks behind the Huddle. Plastic protective covers will be sold in the Ballroom for SO cents. The yearbook will be on sale at the beginning of next semester for non-students and those not eligible to receive their yearbooks now. 
word from the Supreme Court on whether they, too must serve their 2'12-to 8-year sentences. 
Without presidential interven­tion, Liddy would not have been eligible for parole until May 1, 1981. 
Deputy White House Press Sec­retary Rex Granum said the president commuted Liddy's sen­tence "in the interests of equity and f!lirness based on a comparison of Mr. Liddy's sentence with those of all others convicted in Water­gate-related proceedings.'·' 
Liddy was given the harshest sentence, six years, eight months to 20 years, by U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica. He also was fined 
$40,000. . Carter's commutation order did not lift that fine, but Granum said Liddy could win parole without paying it if he is able to take a pauper's oath. But Granum said that if Liddy's financial fortunes improve subse­quently, he will have to pay all or part of the $40,000. The Ford administration did not .

We're KillingOurselves 
::::::::::==========~:mike richfer 
Do animals have free choict'? Most scientists say no, animals c\o that which best insures survival. Animals learn to do what they msu~ do to survive. This is sometimes called the "Survival Instinct." 
Gradually technology has allowed human beings to distance themselves from nature and there­fore from the immediacy of making decisions for survival. Today's day-to-day decisions are usually not made with life or death consequences in mind. Our survi­\'al instinct has been weakened because we are no longer as dependent on it. Technology has given us the option of acting in a manner harmful to our existance as a species. 
One example is the full-blown bloom of our throw-away mentality, especially in the U.S. We now make "easily disposiable" every­thing: bottles, cans, even diapers. Use is once, throw it away, and forget it, right? WRONG!! After we throw them away, many materi­als do not break down in nature. The styrafoam cup you put your coffee in today has the potential to be around in its same form 2000 years from now. In the year 2047 it could conceivably still be found where you left it; thrown away, but not disposed of; forgotten, but not gone. 
It might be noted as a sidelight that we have begun to extrapolate this easy throw-away mantality to many things. Witness that our broken-down factories, our wasted strip-mined land, our bombed-out cities. our senior citizens tucked neatly away in their homes, and even our marriage partners. are used for what they are worth, then conveniently thrown away. 
Until recentlv humans have al­ways been able -to cut down forests, pollute streams, use up land in one place. and go to another place. 
There areno more new places now. If we are to survive, we, the people of the world must learn to over­come our throw-away mentality. We must learn to make responsible environmental decisions or suffer nature's slow, but unrelenting wrath. 
A responsible decision is a decision that takes into considera­tion (among other things) the cause and effect of nature. Any decision that leads to the systematic des­truction of the natural order of things is a bad, irresponsible decision. Decisions which seem easiest in the short run often turn out to be the most dangerous in the long run. Smart decisions leading to the best long-term results are often the hardest to implement and are therefore fought by the short­sighted indurstrial profit-motivated concerns which dominate our lives today. 
For example. an auto manufac­turer (the poor maligned auto industry) has the choice to research and eventually produce non-pollu­ting electric engines. It would cost a bundle. In the short term, it is easier for the company and the stock holders to dump electric engine research and to continue making combustion engines at the highest margn of profit possible so they can the research. In the long run, it turns out that the combus­tion engine created smog, forcing ail their prospective car buyers to live under protective glass domes. They can breathe, but they can't have cars. The company will have made an "easy" short-term deci­tion that led to its demise. 
This is a dramatization of my point (I hope) but the point is clear. We have to worry about what we do 
to our environment because our actions will effect us. Ifwe insist on polluting the environment of which we are a part, we face the real possibility of not being able to live in our surroundings. 
Our dependence on technology hinders our capacity to see cause and effect relationships. I'll never forget the guy who came out of a closed up. crowded, chokingly smoke-filled room to the porch where I was gasping for breath. He was also quite relieved to be outside in the fresh air. He sighed, said, "Ah, fresh air!" and prompt­ly lit up a cigarette (the cause of the smoke in the room). I'm not sure if he was blind, irrational, ignorant, or just plain stupid. What scares me is that he might be a typical example of our level of awareness. 
We have got to become more aware of cause-effect. Dr. Hors­burgh will be speaking directly on this topic tonight in the architec­ture auditorium at 8 o'clock. His talk, entitled "The heavy hand of natural retribution," will kick off InPIRG's environmental seminar. 
I recommend it highly because, like it or not, we are all part of a whole. We have to learn to look harder to see what effects our actions will have on our environ­ment. Concrete buildings and plas­tic cups get in our way, smog ruins our focus, but we must correct that focus and sharpen our dulled instincts. Short-term "solu­tions" will not save us. We've got to think in terms longer and larger than even our own life-times. This isn't easy, but it must be done. 
The problem is not only a large corporational problem_ It is our problem. It is a matter of individual responsibility and individual awareness. If we are not able to stem the tide of pollution, or are unwilling, or simply don't believe that pollution could kill us as it kills fish and birds, we are liable to wake up one morning and find we have joined the 262 animals already on the endangered species list. 
Parental thoughts 

Dear Father Hesbwgb: 
I would like to put forth some parental thoughts regarding the limiting of tickets for the May commencement mostly made nec­essary because of President Carter being present. 
Some four years, twenty thou­sand plus dollars ago, and after much hard work by our son, he will be getting his cherished (and ours!) degree from Notre Dame Univer­sity. His mother and I will be there, but the plans fro his six siblings to witness this event are apparently shattered. 
I feel that the most important person on commencement day should be the graduate and the whole family should experience the whole event! Unfortunately Presi­dent Carter's presence restricts the family's happy event. 
I would like to record my 
resentment on the plans that are 
being formulated -after all, wasn't 
it President Carter himself who 
referred th to unity of the family!!

Editor's Note: The Observer's counterpoint on collective bargain­ing (April 5) contained several typographical errors. The senten­ces are reprinted below with the deleted portions in parentheses: 
Dr. John Lyon's article contained a sentence which should have read "One feels safe in this polyimagis­tic configuration: ot e can choose the best or the most useful (image for a given occasion. But unioniza­tion reduces all these) images to one... " 
Prof. John Lucey's article con­tained a sentence which should have read, "The institution of another bureaucratic layer between the faculty member and the admin­istrative structure would make it more difficult, rather than less, for the faculty and administration (to institute changes in curriculum, teaching methods, administrative) procedures; etc., to improve the learning process in a timely fashion." 
It should also be noted that three of the articles (by Dr. Lyons, Dr. Shaffer and Prof. Robinson) were slightly edited because of space limitations. . 
The editor would like to thank these gentlemen and Professors Ross and Manier for their contribu­tions to the Point-Counterpoint feature.

There is one aspect of Notre Dame which sets it uniquely and distinctly apart from almost all other colleges and universities in this country. This one difference is the emphasis placed on community living and the fact that life at Notre Dame is centered around the halls. In fact, it is this very difference that Notre Dame is proud of and boasts of in admission and alumni litera­ture. Moreover, the famous Notre Dame "spirit" is said to be a product of our close community living in and around the dorms. Therefore, it is important that hall life here be maintained and expan­ded. If we allow a deterioration or stagnation of this life then we are in danger of losing one of the most fundamental aspects of Notre Dame, indeed that which makes this place "Notre Dame." 
Hall life, like any other kind of life, changes with the times. There­fore it is essential that we have a group on campus that is primarily responsible for a high level of community living within the dormi­tories. The sad fact is that there already exists such a group, but for the most part it has been ineffec­tive in dealing with this area. 
During the past three months, and especially the last few weeks, we have been researching the Student Life Council (SLC) to determine first, if it has been dealing with student life (what constructive and tangivle changes or improvements it has made, etc.), and secondly, to find out if the SLC has in fact been ineffective. 
Our findings (to be presented to the board of trustees on Thursday) reflected the latter view. During the past five years of existence, the SLC has done. little to aid, modify or influence the student life at Notre Dame. As a result, theStudent Life Council no longer deals with stu­dent life. 
However, once having discov­ered that the Student Life Council has not dealt effectively and con­cretely with student life, we are faced with three options. First, we can keep the SLC as is, hoping that somehow from somewhere a spark will ignite some type of action and involvement in· dormitory living. Another possibility would be to abolish the body, admit that its time is finished and give it a quick and efficient burial. Either option is unacceptable, however. Who is to say that a body that has had five years to do something constructive will turn itself around in a year? More importantly, should we abo­lish the SLC entirely we would have no group primarily responsible for maintaining good community life on this campus·. We feel that the answer to the SLC and the campus life dilemma is to restructure the body around individuals who deal more directly with student life in the halls and desire an opportunity to make constructive proposals on how to improve that life. 
We propose to restructure the SLC around dormitory life. and thus rename it the Campus Life Council [CLC) The newly-created CLC will consist of Rectors (six), Hall Vice-Presidents (four), Stu­dent Goverm.nent Representatives (three) and Ex-Officcio members of the Administration and faculty senate (three). In tomorrow's Observer, I will explain more fully the reasons for each choice. It is important now, however, to note that we have excluded Off-Campus representation on this council, primarily because we feel off­campus life is essentially different from campus life and thus deserves different attention and considera­tion. By dividing the areas of concern, proposals unique to those areas are more feasible and applicable. 
The need exists for an active and credible CLC . There are halls that are seriously hurting for lack of social space. In other halls the disciplinary procedure is archaic and breeds discontent and disunity between members of the hall and their hall staffs. Some halls offer little more than a place to sleep and study which, in our mind, does not manifest community living in the true sense of the word. 
We cannot promise that our CLC will solve all the problems that currently exist in dormitory living at Notre Dame. We do not feel that the restructured SLC is the end-all solution and will provide us with all the answers, etc. What we do feel will happen however, is that a serious look (perhaps for the first time in awhile) will be given to HALL life. In addition, there will be some concrete proposals on how to improve that life made to the administration. Whether or not the administration chooses to accept and implement these ideas is anyone's guess. The important thing is that suggestions are being made by people who are in the best position to make them. Neither one of these holds true right now and we would like to change that. 
Our goal is to maintain strong community life here. We feel that the Campus Life Council will be essential in improving and foster­ing good community life and strong community spirit at Notre Dame. We ask for your support in achiev­ing this goal.

Strife continues after end of Lebanese war 
BEIRUT, lebanon [AP]--Two years ago today war exploded in Lebanon, the opening act of a bloody tragedy that the country's leaders and people are trying desperately to forget. 
Government censorship forbids any mention in the Beirut press of the artillery battles still sputtering along the southern border with Israel between Palestinian guerril­las and Christian militias. 
From conversatons with a broad range of Lebanese it appears most people would rather not know about the continuing fighting any­way. That would intrude on efforts to pick up where everyone left off before "the events," as the civil war is politely called here. 
The events began April 13, 1975, 
with a Christian ambush on a 
busload of Palestinian refugees. 
They ended, at least for the time 
heing, when Syrian troops occupied 
most of the country last November. 
In the meantime, about 40,000 
persons were killed, most of them 
civilians, and the city center that 
once made Beirut the hub of 
oil-based Middle East commerce 
was reduced to rubble. The battles also created a chasm of hatred between Moslems and Christians, despite frequent protests from both sides that sectarianism was not behind the war. 
The director of the Information Ministry, Ramis Khazen, is still unable to get to his office because he is a Maronite Christian who 
helped with Christian war  propa­ 
ganda  and  his  ministry  is  in  
Moslem territory.  

A head accountant in the same ministry, George Abu Rizq, also stays in Christian territory and confers with his office by telephone from temporary headquarters in Christian-held east Beirut. 
"It's too bad," one of his colleagues says. "We were the only ministry split up that way." 
Reminded that the Army and Defense Ministry split into Moslem and Christian forces, and that the foreign-ministry at one point had competing Moslem and Christiqan ministers, she replied, "Oh, yes, of course, but that was during the events.'' 
A Christian leftist party official who ran into a correspondent near the southern battle zone launched into a speech designed to prove that participation of his party alongside Moslt.. fflrces demon­strated that sectarianism had nothing to do with the war. 
He said nothing of the Christian militia thugs who kidnapped sev­eral hundred Moslems on the strength of their religion and killed 150 of them on Dec. 6, 1975, the "black Saturday" that sparked a new round of the war, one of many spread among numerous failed truces. 
Also conveniently forgotten were the hooded Moslem hoodlums who regularly stopped cars just entering the Moslem zone after a dangerous sprint across no-man's land. Dozens of Christians who had made it safely that far were shot and their bodies thrown under a nearby bridge, minus money and valu­ables. 
Most Moslems are still afraid to go into Christian territory. The same is true for Christians keeping out of Moslem areas, but to a less-er degree.

For members of Congress 
Payraise procedure altered 
W ASIDNGTON [AP]--President Carter signed a law today that ensures that Congress  gets no 
future  pay  raises  without  first  
voting on them.  
The law also  resurrects  a  pro­ 

gram which expired March 31 to provide emergency benefits for the 
long-term unemployed. 
The new pay raise law will retain the special commission to make recommendations to the President on pay raises for Congress and other top officials and the President still will have the decision on whether to submit the recommen­dation to Congress. 
But both the House and Senate then will have to approve the increase by a roll call vote before it can go into effect. Under the old law, the hike automatically went

was offered with the stipulation that $200.000 must come from other sources before the $100,000 will be given. "But we're very confident that this will happen," Remmo added. 
Rev. Theodore Hesburgh helped in attaing the grant through a letter of recommendation. The new donations will raise the

$1,211,183.75.  A  total  of  $1.8  
million  is  needed,  and  Remmo  

hopes to have this amount secured by July I, the scheduled opening date of the sports facility. 
"We started just sixteen months ago to raise the money for the sports building, so we're very proud of our accomplishments, and we hope to continue in this way till we have all the funds needed," he said.

into effect unless either house 
vetoed it. 
The new law is a result of the public outcry that occurred when a 29 percent pay raise for Congress, federal judges and other top feder­al officials took effect in February without a record vote by the House and Senate. 
The February raise increased top congressonal salaries to $57,500 a year. The increase, recommended by President Gerald R. Ford before he left office, took effect after the Senate tabled a motion to kill it and the House failed to vote on a similar motion. 
The new law also will provide unemployment benefits for persons who have exhausted the 39 weeks of aid under regular state and extended federal state compensa­tion laws. 
This will cost taxpayers $528 million this budget year ending Sept. 30 and $215 million next year. 
Benefits will be denied to those who are not actively seeking work or who refuse suitable work offers. 
Under the law, unemployment benefits will continue until Oct. 31.

Christ leadership, particularly Camille Chamoun and his National Liberal party, are making plans for a permanent partition, even if it remains only the de facto sp.\it left by the war. 
One evidence of this is the building in the Christian heartland north of Beirut of an unsanctioned $2.5 million airport, named Pierre Gemayel International Airport after the Phalange party leader who is Chamoun's main ally. The reason the Christians are building the airport is that Beirut's official international airport lies in Moslem territory.

President Elias Sarkis, himself a

But Sarkis, installed by Syria during the war, has yet to make his authority accepted with­out question.

Sarkis has little to say about it.

In Washington, the Carter ad­minisuation said it was stepping up aid to the government of President Mobutu Sese Seko. giving it a total of about $13 million in "nonlethal assistance." including a cargo plane. 
At the White house, there was no elaboration on the considerations that led to the decision. However, spokesman Rex Granum said:"We

How carrying out Equal Rights law may affect you 
Who could quarrel with the right of 
every individual in America to an 
equal chance for a job'! No one we 
know. But when you look for a job. 
you should understand some things 
about the equal rights regulations that 
could affect your chances. 
Most large companies are deeply involved in affirmative action pn:r grams. These are plans and actions designed to overcome discrimination. Statistics are the only evidence that counts. If a company's statistics don't measure up. the company is presumed to discriminate. 
Some people think affirmative action programs discriminate against the majority of Americans. But that kind of talk doesn't solve any problems. Affirmative action is the law. And it's here. 
So if you're a woman or a member of a recognized minority group. you stand a better chance than other pepple of equal ability. Companies are working to catch up. and that's good for you. 
But when you look at a potential employer. we think you ought to dis­<:riminate a littfe, yourself. Ask some tough questions. Such as how a com1 pany promotes people. Or how many higher-level women and minority members they have. Chances are there won't be too many-statistically. So you should demand some straight­forward answers about what a company is trying to do about that. 
FREE--Armco's plain talk on how to get a job 
We've got a free booklet to help you get a job. Use it to set yourself apart, above the crowd. We answer 50 key questions you'll need to know. Like why you should bone up on companies you like. What to do after the first inter­view. Hints to make you a more aggres­sive. attractive job candidate. All prepared for Armco by a consulting firm specializing in business recruiting, with help from the placement staff of a leading university.

Plain talkabout EQUAL JOB RIGHTS 
So far. there just aren·t enough women, blacks or other minority members in some fields. That's where the real opportunities often are. But you're not likely to be hired as a chemical engineer if your major was black literature or feminist history. If you're looking for real opportunity, you should polish your talent in a discipline that is needed most by those who offer

good jobs. We'll need to create 
18.fXX).(XX) more jobs to take care of 
the young people joining the work­force over the next ten years. So the competition for jobs will be fierce. 
Most of all. we think you should look for companies that really try for excellence in the people they hire, develop and promote. Equal rights are one thing. Good jobs with tough standards and exciting futures are something else again. 
Next time somebody gripes about job discrimination. you might ask: ''Have you ever thought about metallurgy'!" 
Armco -wants mur.plain talk about equal rights and jobs 
Does our message make sense'? We'd like to know what you think. Your 
personal experiences. Facts to prove or disprove our point. Drop us a line. We'll send you back a more detailed 
report on equal rights and jobs. Our offer of How to Get a Job, above. tells you how to write us. Let us hear from you. We've all got a stake in more American jobs.

freshman Carlton Harris to go unblemished through the first doubles slot. 
Coming up with a strong show­ing in the singles competition the Irish again brought their record to the .500 mark with a 6-3 victory over the Bearcats of Cincinnati. 
Starting off slow, the netters came away with one victory in the doubles competition as Stehlik and Harris continued their winning streak which now stands at four. Taking three sets, the duo finally put away a tough Bearcat team winning 6-4, 4-6, 6-2. 
The other doubles slots saw the Irish drop two as Cincinnati picked responsible in helping to determine the entire athletic budget.'' 

On July 1, 1976, O'Brien filled this position which had been vacat­ed by the retirement of Robert Cahill. Knowledge of O'Brien's background made his selection no surprise to the Notre Dame com­munity. 
O'Brien was born and raised in Philadelphia. After serving in the military during the Second World War he enrolled at Notre Dame. While at the University. O'Brien studied to be an engineer. 
but later switched to sociology and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1949. 
After graduation O'Brien worked in the Personnel Departments of the Oliver and Whirlpool Corpora­tions for three years each. Then in 1956, O'Brien was notified, by Father Jerry Wilson of the creation of a new position, Director of Personnel. He then applied and received the job and has been at Notre Dame ever since. As the Director of Personnel, O'Brien was 

responsible  for  supervising  the  
budgets,  including  salaries  and  
fringe  benefits,  of  all  the  em­ 

ployees within the university com­munity. · 
O'Brien first became involved in the athletic program at Notre Dame in 1969 when he became the voice of the Fighting Irish hockey team. He held this position through the 1975-76 season at which time he 
up two of its victories. Three sets were needed in both cases to secure the wins for the Bearcats. 

Down 2-1 after the doubles competition Stehlik continued his prowess into the singles match. After losing 7-6 in a tie-breaker in, the first set, Stehlik went on to sweep the next two sets by identi­cal scores 6-3, 6-3. The win was he fourth in a row for the Notre Dame captain who leads the Irish in victories this season. 
After losing the second slot in three sets, the freshman sensation Carlton Harris gave the Irish its third victory of the afternoon with a two set win over his Bearcat counterpart. The score of the match was 7-6, 6-3. 
In fourth singles spot Bob Koval dropped his first set before un­winding and came up with still another three set victory for the netters. 2-6, 7-5, 6-2 was the final tally. 
Clinching the victory for Notre Dame in the fifth spot was sopho­more Mark Trueblood. Losing just three games in the .entire match Trueblood won easily 6-1, 6-2 giving the Irish its eighth win of the year. 
Adding icing to the cake was Notre Dame's Tom Westphal. Playing in the sixth singles position Westphal came away with a two set victory over his opponent winning 6-2. 6-4. 
The win evens the Irish record at a respectabele 8-8. Playing with more consistancy coach Fallon hopes his netters can continue their winning ways into this weekend as they host a triangular meet with Northern Illinois and Bowling Green. On Friday the action begins at 3:00p.m. at the Courtney Tennis Center while resuming on Saturday at 9:00a.m. 

periods of time and endless frustra­tion. "Fortunately, my previous contacts, within the rest of the university made my job that much easier," O'Brien emphasized. Certainly, his job has been any­thing but easy during his first year. "I never conceived of the num­ber of details involved in running an athletic program, the magnitude is almost overwhelming." 
O'Brien modestly admitted that since the Athletic Department is only a part of Financial Affairs, much of the financial burden is taken from his shoulders. Ulti­mately, O'Brien is responsible to Father Joyce, Executive Vice-Pres­ident and the Chairman of the Faculty Board of Athletics. "This group has complete and final authority concerning all budget proposals within the Athletic De­partment," O'Brien insisted. 
The budget of the Athletic Department is allocated, in much the same manner as that of each other department, from the budget of the university as a whole. 
"The importance of the Athletic Program and Department can only be judged by its ability to enhance the overall excellence of the uni­versity," O'Brien acknowleged. "The excellence of the university as a totality always takes prece­dent, with the Athletic Program only considered as an additonal plus." 
This ideology differs drastically

The 1977 Bookstore Basketball Tournament got underway yester­day and everything went excep­tionally well, according to tourna­ment director Tim Bourret. In games involving highly ranked teams, the results came as little surprise with one exception; in the Farrah fawcett Sextional, the Old Timers upset Toby Knight's Team (who's roster does not include the Notre Dame basketball star who's name the team boasts) 21-12. 
Six-foot seven, 230 pounds Fat­her Dan McNeil paced the Old Timers with nine buckets and 13 rebounds. Lou Cohen tallied three baskets in five attempts for the victors. Mark Simendinger hit five of seven attempts for the losers. Simendinger's totals were not re­presentative of his teams perfor­mance as the remainer of Toby Knight's team could only manage seven baskets in 45 attempts. 
In the Johnny Dee Secional, The Exceptions dumped Meehan's All­Stars, 21-4. Varsity golfer, Bob Kennedy led The Exceptions with seven baskets while Jim Kelly contributed five tallies and Chris Fabian of SWAT team fame added four hoops. 
In the Father Riehle Sectional, the two co-favorite teams both won easily with Three Eggs and Sterm Brothers thrashing The Love Mach­ine 21-7 and Claudine Longet and Spider Shooters crushed the 45 cent Sandwich on Pampernickle 21-12. Bill Murphy, a three-year starter for Bennett Academy of Chicago, led the Three Eggs with seven buckets and: 12 rebounds. Glen Sterms chipped in five bas­kets and ten rebounds. 
powers employ. 
Although recognizing the impor­tance of income producing sports, such as football, basketball and hockey, O'Brien emphasized that the only difference which exists between these sports and the non-money making ones concerns the use of scholarships. 
"The expansion of women's sports along with the renovation of intramural and varsity athletic sites should attest to this comparison," stated O'Brien. 
O'Brien has just begun to under­stand the intricate workings of the Athletic Department and is anx­iously anticipating the upcoming football season. Since attaining his present position, he has found this environment to be completely dif­ferent and yet more exciting than any previously held job. 
"Being able to contribute to the success of the football squad and the entire athletic program along with my involvement with student athletes are the most rewarding aspects of my job," O'Brien em­phasized. 
Although only entering his se­cond year at his present position, O'Brien has shown, through his enthusiasm and dedication, that Assistant Direcor and Busine"s Manager of Athletics is more than just a bureaucratic title. Recogni­tion and success do not always coincide, such is the case with Joseph O'Brien. 
The Love Machine was paced by Jay Clubb with three baskets. For Claudine Longet and the Spider Shooters, Frank Coughlin showed six baskets on the day with the Morrisey-based backcourt of Mike Mulligan and Mike Vadas turning in a nine-basket day. John Ran­dolph led the Pmpernickles with five buckets. 
Bob Keen and Tom Powanda hit for seven buckets apiece leading The Mo Fandsome Five to a 21-15 victory over Harrassing Divinely Inspired Seige Squad in the Tasha Palui Sectional. The Mo Fandsome Five advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in last years tourney before being eliminated by Dave Batton's Tiles, the eventual tournament cham­pions. 
The first day of competition saw The Mooners grap th Most Shots Attempted honors with a 21-84 performance. Augie Jennewein paced the offensive minded club with a seven of thirty performance. The Mooners were victorious, de­feating Not Much, 21-15. 
"The crowds were good for the first day,'' commented tournament. director Bourret who pointed out that he expects a big crowd for tonight's 6:15 games behind the bookstore where two of the top three-seeded teams will be in acton. Tonight at 6:15 Tiles IV will defend their title against Teddy Roosevelt Rides Again. Tiles IV: are paced by Dave Batton, Joe Montana and John Dubenetsky. In the other game, Bill Paterno's Average White Team, 1976 tour­nament runner-up, will meet De­laney's Profs. A WT Ill boasts ND grid stars Rusty Lisch, Mike Banks and Doug Buth as well as Irish cage standout Paterno. 
The Cindermen finished strong at Jonesbory, :-vith Perry Stow finishing sixth against Olympian Earl Bell from Arkansas State with a vault of 15-0; Ahmad Kasimi's 45-2 '12 effort in the triple jump for fifth-place; and Dennis VanDer­Kraats' sixth-place finish in the 3000-meter steeplechase in 9:12.0.
