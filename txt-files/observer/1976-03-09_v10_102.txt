By Academic Council members 
Possible Council changes weighed 

voting procedure~. and the possi­bility of open meetings while offering suggestions for council improvements. 
William Bula. student repre­sentative of the Engineering Col­lege. stated that the Academic Counl·il as a bodv is dedicated to the "educational 'excellence of the University as a whole." He explained that the Council's posi­tion as academic affairs legislator at the University makes it the most important committee on campus. 
John Borsious, student repre­sentative of the Arts and Letters College, supported Bula's state­ment of the basic council goal, which is to the "overall betterment of the University." He was vehemently opposed to a more political orientatio~, saying ~t "defeat the purpose of the counctl by creating factions within the group. 
All of the members interviewed agreed on the University orienta­tion of the council, but varying opinions appeared on the question of representative responsibility. 
Dr. Isabel Charles, Dean of the Arts and Letters College and an Ex Oflicio member of the council. explained. "You are elected not only as a representative. but as a thinking member of the body." Charles went on to say that the representatives are appointed or elected because of their "good sense and intelligence." 
The members are then "privy to a whole series of discussions that their constituents have not been privy to.'' 
For this reason, Charles and 
most of the members questioned 
said that the voting is based on 
one's own judgement. Burke said, 
"If you're a member of the they wouldn't have made it to the Council." 
A few of the members question­ed placed more emphasis on their "constituency." Brosious said of the student representatives, "Ob­viously. we should represent the student point of view." Bula agreed while Academic commis­sioner Michael Gassman recogniz­ed a dual purpose: "I have to work for the academic interest of the University and for what the stu­dents want." 
Dr. Robert Williamson, elected faculty representative of the Busi­ness Administration, said, "The elected member should definitely solicit opinions from his constitu­ents. Frankly, when I do go in and vote, it's my own opinion. Only a 
couple  of times  this  is  different  
from my constituents."  
Representation  was  a  point  of  

dissent among those questioned. 
Gassman stated. "The council is obviously not representative. Stu­dent representation is near nil. Faculty representation is not strong enough to give it a voice against the representatives of the Administra­tion." 
He also mentioned that there are "too many Arts and Letters repre­sentatives" and not enough from the Business school. Joseph Fiorella, the student representative from the Business College, agreed, but Williamson explained that the number of representatives from each college is determined by the number of faculty in the college. He pointed out that "there are fewer faculty in the Business College." 
Williamson added that he sees "no lack of understanding of the needs of the business school." Williamson disagreed, however,

Dr. Robert E. Burns, associate dean of the College of Arts and Letters at Notre Dame , has been named one of 26 outstanding college and university teachers in a national report on improved teach­ing published in the current issue of Change magazine.

Convinced that teachers must be free to transmit more than content in the courses, he worked with Dr. William I. Davisson, associate dir­ector of the Social Science Training and Research Laboratory at Notre

SMC receives recognition 
by Margie Irr 
Staff Reporter 

Indiana Governor Otis Bowen awarded St. Mary's College recog­nition as a Bicentennial College in a ceremony in Stapleton Lounge on Friday. 
Bowen presented Dr. John M. Duggan, St. Mary's College presi­dent, with an official Bicentennial Flag and certificate of distinction. Before the presentation, Bowen spoke to approximately 100 mem­bers of the administration, faculty and student body. 
"The successful pursuit of Bi­centennial College recognition is indicative of an educational institu­tion with both a deeply abiding sense of understanding and respect 
for our democratic heritage and a forward-looking attitude of hope and confidence in the continuing 
future greatness of our American nation," Bowen stated. "St. Mary's College is such an institution of higher learning,'' he

According to Dr. Jack Detzler, chairman of St. Mary's Bicenten­nial Committee, community in­volvement was an important con­sideraton of the Natonal Bicenten­ial Commission in choosing St. Mary's. 
St. Mary's music department is cooperating with the South Bend community in the planning of a Bicentennial pageant for July 4. Also the college must plan activi­ties of lasting value. Histories of the college and the Holy Cross Sisters have been prepared for this purpose. St. Mary's has worked in conjunction with the University of Notre Dame on this week's Bicen­tennial Festival and Conference. Upon presentation of the award, Duggan spoke for St. Mary's. "Thank you, Govenor Bowen, for bestowing this flag on St. Mary's College, and for picking such an appropriate day," Duggan added, referring to Friday's windy weath­er. 
The presentation was followed by a reception where the govenor met informally with those attend­ing.

Smelser highlights causes of U.S;. Revolution 
by Kathy Mills Senior Staff Reporter 

The American Revolution was a mild revolution staged by reluctant rebels for limited goals which were in their reach, asserted Marshall Smelser, professor of history at Notre Dame. Smelser spoke to approximatley 40 people yesterday morning in the Center for Continu­ing Education on "Understanding the American Revolution" as part of the Bicentennial Festival and Conference. 
Rejecting economics as a major cause of the Revolution, Smelser said, "It was British policy that roused discontent in an otherwise­contented people." Smelser cited the British policy of taxation on the colonies. 
"The British decided to make the Anglo-Americans pay for a large part of the standing army which wa~ to he kept, threateningly, in the colonies. They decided to levy taxc~ and make the colonists pay for the administration of these taxes,'' he pointed out. 
Thc policy issue at stake, accord· 1ng to Smelser, was that the royal governors would not need the local as.,emhlics if the colonists could he 
Ombudsman announces Brainstorm award winners 
Mike Mountford has won the $76 

grand prize in the Ombudsman 
Service's Second Annual Operation 
Brainstorm. 
Mountford's winning idea was 

that the Student Union should 
operate a student employment 
service which would publish a list 
of joh opportunities on campus and 
in South Bend. 
Nine other winners were chosen 

by the panel of five judges for their 
proposals in three categories: 
service, social and policy. 
In the service category, Amy Thornton placed first with her suggestion that summer storage be held in two orthrce rooms in each section of each dormitory so that thlrc would be no need to remove possessions to another site. 
Midge May and Nancy Budds tied for second place by suggesting that the Huddle offer limited amounts of grocery store items. Mary Siegel placed third by pro­posing a baby-sitting service. 
In the social category, Sally Stanton placed first by proposing a sidewalk cafe to encourage outdoor sot·ial gatherings. 
Second place was awarded to Brian Kirk for suggesting a roller­skating party, and third place went to John McAustin, who asked for a 'SO's day and dance. 
For policy proposals, Kevin

compelled to pay these taxes. "This brought fear from those who took pride in the assemblies and participated in them," he explain­ed. 
''Any policy which provokes such anger and outrage in prosperous colonies could not have been a very prudent policy," he declared. 
Wisdom lacking 

Smelser mentioned other differ­ences between the colonists and the British, including mistrust of Anglican bis;hops in the colonies and conflicting claims to western lands. ''Despite these differences, a reorganization of America might have been carried off if it had been done by wise men," he observed. 
"A wiser government in West­minister might have led the Ameri­cans better," Smelser continued. "They could have been made to feel at home in the Empire. But wisdom was scarce." 
Smelser also said the colonists were prone to violence and psycho· logically ready for disobedience long before they rebelled against British policy. "Before the Revolu­tion, the Anglo-American staged 18 attempts to overturn colonial gov-
Dickerson won for calling for the re-institution of sophomore class officers. 
Fred Haaser placed second by proposing that an interior map of the ACC be placed in du Lac and William Shaughnessy captured third with his suggestion that smoking in dining halls or class­rooms be subjected to rigid limits. 
About 70 ideas were submitted to the contest. 
First-prize winners will receive two free tickets to the Pittsburgh football game next year. Second­place finishers will receive Me­Donalds gift certificates worth three dollars and third-placers will get an 8 by I0 glossy photograph of their favorite Notre Dame persona­lities. 
Judging the contest were Om­budsman representatives Matt Cockrell and Robin Lavendar; Richard Sullivan, registrar; Robert Watkins, director of purchasing, and Robert Waddick. assistant dean of the College of Arts and Letters. 
Ideas which did not win prizes will be kept and reviewed later and the originator of the idea will be given credit if his proposal is implemented, Ombudsman sources said.

ernments," he noted. "Six of these were violent." 
He also mentioned the violence of the colonists' encounters with Indians and said international wars were endemic in the colonies before the Revolution. "Mob action was common," he added. 
Loyalists' role 

"Perhaps the worst mistake of the British was to overestimate the power of the Loyalists," Smelser said. He pointed out British Loyalists actually comprised less than one-fifth of the population in the colonies. 
"In the North, they were passive or they huddled behind the army," he continued. ''Only south of Virginia were there Loyalist lead­ers. and here they were rebel partisan bands warring against other rebel partisan bands." 
Smelser added, "British leader­ship did not sparkle." 
According to Smelser, the tem­perment of George Washington was probably the single most important ingredient in the Ameri· .:an military victory. He noted rebel propaganda was skillful and "won the contest for public loyal­ty." 
"Independence was one thing on which all American rebels a­greed," he stated.

cosmetic effect," he stated. "It hid 
the oppression of slavery. Not only 
did it not abolish slavery, but in 
the 70 years following the ratifica­
tion of the Constitution, the rights 
of black people became fewer." 
Smelser said he thinks the 
phrase, "All men are created 
equal/' in the Declaration of 
Independence was intended to 
indicate the colonists were equal to 
the people in Britain. 
He called the Declaration of 
Independence "an historical doc­
trine of interest but not binding." 
Smelser noted the colonists did not 
apply universally the natural law 
doctrines contained in the docu­
ment. 
"They did not even apply them to their own society,'' he remarked. The broadening of applications of these doctrines, he said, occurred in later times. 
The Americans negotiated a "truly splendid treaty" in Paris after the Revolution was over, Smelser commented. "They won because they learned how diplo­macy operated in Europe better than the Europeans," he stated. 
Smelser termed the Constitution a "financial bargain" at about $12,000 in 1976 dollars. "It was not a philosphical treatise," he stated. "It was a successful working paper to meet the needs of the 1780's." 
The Bicentennial Festival and Conference, which will run through Thursday is entitled "An Almost Chosen People: The Moral Aspira­tions of Americans," and is spon­sored by Notre Dame and St. Mary's. 
Author and educator 
Smelser was educated at Quincy 
College, St. Louis University and 
Harvard University. He was a 
member of the faculties at St. Lousi 
University and St. Thomas College, 
St. Paul., Minn.

Nuts or Guts?

If nothing else, the Mock Convention enhanced California's reputation as America's leading producer of fruits and nuts. 
As the ballots and hours progressed, what began as a murmur of discontent with the California delegation's consistent support of Governor Jerry Brown, matured into shouted obscenities. What right did those (expletives) have in keeping the session going until 4:20A.M.? Why did they stick with a sham candidate like Brown until Hubert Humphrey won by default? What provoked the sudden jump to Carter on the sixth ballot when it was too late? Why, in general did they screw up the convention? 
One reason only: we wanted Brown to win. 
And as a Golden State delegate and a leader of the Brown campaign, I know that all of us thought Gov. Brown could win. Contrary to erroneous reports in the South Bend Tribune, we were not holding out for a vice-presidential bid from anyone, not even Mandello. the Fighting Chicken. We were serious, we were in the race to stay, hoping to win on a later ballot. 
The strategy we fashioned closely fitted the circumstances of the convention. Early on, we wanted to establish ourselves as having a viable credible candidate, who could pick up substantial strength outside California. From then, we thought the field would narrow to a Carter-Udall stalemate, where a more moderate man like Brown could build momentum as a candidate acceptable to all factions. 
On the first ballots, we collected many more votes than we ever imagined, too many, in fact. Though Brown built strength on succeeding tallies, a strong stop-Brown sentiment developed. When the standoff did materialize. the resentment of the delegates at hearing "California casts 68 votes for Jerry Brown." had grown too great. 
Until the fifth ballot, we thought things could still go as anticipated. But then, several states exhumed Humphrey (even though he withdrew earlier in the night) as a compromise, or more aptly, an exhaustion candidate. The big states, outside of California rigidly rejected Brown. The two big complaints l\gainst Brown, his youth and the fact that he has not yet declared his candidacy (issues we could have handled one at a time, as did Humphrey,but proved devastating as a combination) scared off numerous potential votes. After the fifth ballot, vote changes cut our total by one-third, we could no longer hope to win, and subsequently threw in the towel. 
California then caucused, and after unpressured debate, gave 66 votes to Jimmy Carter and 2 to Brown. No ideological shift or inconsistency was involved here. In a recycled Humphrey, we saw a man who totally contradicted the pioneering. forward-looking spirit of our governor. Carter more closely embodied Brown's reexamination of government and acceptance of an ''era of limits''. Unlike other big delegations, we took the qualifications of the man more seriously than bedtime. 
I know I speak for the whole delegation in saying that we are proud of the role we played Friday night. We had a candidate we liked, and enthusiastically stuck with him until all hope was lost. Unlike other states, who voted merely in reaction to us, who gave extensive support to "serious" contenders like Pat Moynihan or Mayor Daley. who claimed to be a keystone of events but really resembled Silly-Putty in the hands of any little trend, we voted our conscience every time and remained unintimidated by the late hour. 
As one Brown supporter put it, we may have lain under the wheels, but we never jumped on the bandwagon. 
As for making deals. none seemed very attractive. Udall-Brown would be great only for states west of the Rockies. Carter-Brown would have meant conceding to someone with not a great deal more votes, while being unattractive to liberals. If Brown dropped out, the delegation would have split about evenly between Carter and Udall, helping no one. Therefore, we did what we thought was right, and still do. 
A lot of people complained about the final result, but I think I can safely predict, that the real Democratic convention will end very similarly. Three or four candidates will go to New York without enought strength to win (in addition to Jerry Brown holding the major part of the California delegation.) From this morass will emerge a compromise, most likely HHH. 
We never bowed to the whims and abuses of others. We regret only that Brown lost. As for Humphrey: the convention cast 386 votes for California cast 0.

Cuckoo's Nest--maddening triumph 
Beyond Bicentennial Banalities 
During a week of Mock Convention, Bicentennial doings. and Lenten begin­nings. Isaiah haunts me and disturbs my complacency: 
Is not this the sort of fast that pleases me -­to break unjust fetters and undo the thongs of the yoke, to share your bread with the hungry, and shelter the homeless poor, to clothe the man you see naked, to let the oppressed go free. 
As if this wasn't bad enough, I can't shake 
off a chilling line in the gospel: "Teacher, 
tell my brother to give me a share of our 
inhcritant·c." 
How many millions arc saying precisely 
this about us today! Those who mine tin in 
Holivia. and copper in Chile. Those who 
harvest our coffee in Brazil; the families 
who pick our food from the fields, where 
tht·y are merely "migrants." All of these 
pcoph:. and many more, are asking today, 
and sometimes demanding, to share in 
God's creation... "Teacher. tell my brother 
to give me a share of our inheritance." 
Their murmurs of protest are presently 
like distant thunder; but the thunder rolls 
in our direction. How amazing it is that we 
have so lost touch with our own history that 
we fail to recognize that the voices of our 
Founding Fathers sent forth that very same 
cry for liberation. In this Bicentennial year 
we arc forced to wonder if we have not 
become strangers to the fact that we exist 
as a nation only because of an historical 
event called the American Revolution. 
There seems to be a calculated conspir­acy against an honest and forthright analysis of our origins and what the American Revolution means today. The heaviest emphasis of the Bicentennial is on the circus aspect: festive celebrations in tri-corncrcd hats and colonial uniforms. Indeed, the word "revolution" is missing from the Bicentennial. The government seems to be terrified by the thought that the United States is a revolutionary eountry. 
We find ourselves in the midst of a monumental snow job, perhaps Washing­ton's most effective cover-up of all. A principle of direct proportion is at work: the greater the effort to plan for the Bicenten­nial. the greater the attempt to eliminate any possibility that serious retlcction and debate will occur on the truly serious questions of the American Revolution. It's 
wt 
hard to understand the administra­tion's ambivalence. At a time when our 1magc abroad reveals us as a capitalist,

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, is a powerful and moving film about a man who stands up against the injustices of a social and political system. Although he is beaten down, he becomes a symbol of hope to the others that are oppressed and overwhelmed by it. We see that many of the oppressed may never be able to break free. but because of this man they begin to understand that the assertion of individual­ity often necessitates action; if they don't like things they can indeed stand up and shout and perhaps force some things to happen. 
Milos Foreman has taken the original Ken Kescy novel and has enlarged upon its political implications, while strictly adher­ing to the plot. In the novel. first published in the early sixties, the story of how one Randle Patrick McMurphy attempted to change ward policy in a mental institution after being transferredthere from a prison, was told from the point of view of an Indian who was a paranoid schizophrenic. The story as seen through his eyes was naturally exaggerated so that the conflict between the highly volatile McMurphy and the head of the ward, Nurse Ratched, became essentially a power struggle between two forceful personalities. Fore­man. however, has decided to film the story from an objective point of view. As a result, the conflict between the Nurse and McMurphy develops into more than a struggle for power; the asylum becomes a microcosm for society and McMurphy's defeat is seen as a suppression of individuality by a form of police state that attempts to hold power by suppression through the instillation of fear and social emphasis on conformity. 
Foreman's transformation of Kesey's novel into a political allegory is obviously a means of personally alluding to his native nationality, yet his treatment of the subject matter is never overtly heavy-handed. The depiction of the patient's life in the ward is not particularly careless or unfeeling nor is the character of the nurses or the orderlies outwardly hostile or aggressive. We come to realize the nature of the system and the patient's subservience toward it only as a direct result of McMurphy's confrontations with it. 
At the very top ofthe power hierarchy is Nurse Ratched. Projecting an outwardly

believe in it for other peoples. ''On~ can understand why the notion of American as the great anti-colonial, revolutionary coun­try is badly tarnished," h;storian Richard 
B. Morris writes. "The word revolution has a bad connotation in Washington. We're supporting military regimes in Greece and Turkey, in Spain and Portugal. We arc helping counter-revolutionary movements in the Caribbean and Latin America. We took over France's colonial role in Indo­china. Our tradition has been a kind of isolationism in terms of other peoples' revolutions." 
I believe most of the American people possess a quality of character admirable enough to want to discover the relevance of the American Revolution for our present moment. It should not take a full-scale revolution against us to wake us up and tune us in to the voices of the oppressed ­and a gospel message that would reform our national policies and our self-obsessed style of life. 
The gospel and Jesus (that Jesus spoken of by Isaiah: "The people who walk in darkness have seen a great light; upon those who dwell in the land and shadow of death, a light has dawned") -they should be sufficient to motivate us to feed the hungry and to share more equitably the inheritance of the earth; to struggle to initiate appropriate actions to advance the necessary reforms of oppressive systems. 
God would light our consciousness and lead us to live in a radically new way. He himself seems to be speaking to us. through a remarkable document recently issued from Taize. France. where 35.000 young people from more than one hundred countries assembled for the First Council of Youth. They wrote: 
Church, what do you say of your 
future? Are you going to become 
the people of the beatitudes, 
having no security other than 
Christ. a people poor, contemplat­
ive, creating peace, bearing joy, 
and a liberating festival for man­
kind, ready even to be persecuted 
for justice? We know that we can 
demand nothing exacting of others 
unless we ourselves take every­
thing. What do we have to fear? 
Christ says, "I came to kindle tire 
on the earth. and how I long for it to 
burn." We shall dare to commit 
ourselves, together. and to the 
point of no return, to living beyond 
hope. letting the spirit of the 
beatitudes come springing up in 
the people of God, being leaven of 
a society without class and where 
none have privileges. We are 
addressing this first letter to the 
people of God, written on our 
hearts, so as to share what burns 
us. 

serene exterior, she uses daily communal discussion sessions to psychologically shat­ter the patients morale and dignity by exposing their fears and weaknesses to the group. It is only when she is confronted with the aggressive and confident Mc­Murphy that she has to resort to physical violence and then murder (lobotomy), to defeat him. Yet McMurphy's death is more inspirational than tragic. It ultimate­ly inspires the patients to assert their individuality and in the movies most moving scene, gives the once inactive Indian the courage to break out by throwing a marble basin that weighs about a half ton, through the window. And although McMurphy has just been thrown back from the operating room a virtual vegetable, we know the patients will never believe it, and their shouts of joy at hearing the window shatter and "His" escape following it, becomes one of the most moving expressions of defiant triumph ever depicted on the screen.

Letters From Abroad 


War-Broken Vienna 
We didn't start the last war. We would 
have been well-content with Bogart and 
Bergman. chocolate romance and the new 
media culture. The lilies of the field could 
have done without our human fertilizer. 
Whilst we were filling our minds with chocolate music, new ideas and ideals, in another part of the world. a nation became obsessed, another filled with anxiety. An "inferior" race could do nothing but choke in a most perverted ill-fate. The artists suffered the most however; theirs was an impersonal fear for mankind: Klee, Hesse, etc. 
We no longer have to hide in the ruins of that war. Our hearts may bleed for Dresden, but there is no Dresden lift. Here in Vienna. like elsewhere, we can find the scattered remnants of a cultural massacre; like an embarrassed child we were quick to repair the broken vase of history. 
"Never again" speak the monuments of victory. hardly consolation save for the meager minded, those who will easily forget the past. The dog or child, once spanked, will be hard pressed to learn his lesson. 
But resentment is soft-spoken, subtle, not really too existent. It is easier to forget. for remembering is painful, like a constant nightmare. At Dachau. an extermination camp of sorts near Munich. we arc an intruder who awakens the sleeping beast. 
We feel a universal sorrow for those destructive days of this century as we stroll through Vienna. but that is somewhat staggered and sweetened by frame of mind and mood. The Viennese wine is more persuasive than most. The beauty of an age past seeps through from behind the closed doors of post-war industrialization. 
All the while the ghosts of the Viennese masters (Beethoven, Mozart, Strauss, Shubert, etc.) still delightfully haunt the opera houses and music salons, which are

Much of the movie is richly comic. Jack Nicholson who plays the part of McMurphy has built a career out of playing the part of alienated loners and in Cuckoo's Nest he gives the finest performance of his life. As McMurphy his prankish escapades and his continual attempts to get the patients involved in his schemes against Nurse Ratched make up a major portion of the film. By encouraging the patients to be themselves and accepting them as equals. McMurphy restores much of their self. confidence and respect. What makes the movie such an inspiring work, is to sec these harrowed souls return to life and enjoy all the beauty it has to offer, the beauty and wonderment that Nicholson­McMurphy shows and then gives to them. In encouraging the patients to laugh at themselves as they get involved, the patients lose much of their self-centered ness and many of their anxieties. More 
importantly,thesc people grow and become more individualistic because of Mc­Murphy. and that's why he can never really die for them, for in the end he has become a part of their souls.

its once-classical form; the eighteenth and 
nineteenth century romance creeps 
through a blanket of the last seventy five years. 
And standing in the centre, the impres­sive Gothic structure of St. Stephen's Church, severely tattered after brutal bombings of the Second World War. is now mostly restored. Its tower looks down ominously upon the broken street below. where a metro is being constructed. 
The plywood fences surrounding the pit are adorned by photographs from the regal age: ladies in white lace gowns, men in traditional suits, arriving at the opera. strolling in the woods, or at a courtly palace. 
Meanwhile our ideas remain static but free: the cause for the fighting has long since been forgotten. though we search in humility for an end to the massacre of civilization, or for the war for the end of the world. 
All in all the last laugh belongs to fate: we'll smile a stoic smile for those at peace. extend an emotional sigh for those alive. and leave a teardrop in the snow for those waiting to be.

SMC Writing Clinic encounters positive reaction 
by Jean Powley Staff Reporter Editor's note: tbis article is the second in a two-part series examin­ing the St. Mary's Writing CUnic. 
"The Writing Clinic showed me the things I was doing wrong and now I can write pretty well on illy own," explained St. Mary's fresh­man Ann Sofranko, when asked how the college's program helped her. Her comment is typical and accurately reflects the hopes ;md expectations of tutors, faculty members and administrators work­ing closely with the experiment. 
Tutors do not write students' 
papers for them. Instead they help 
with organization, grammar and 
the general mechanics of writing. 
''When I bad to rewrite a paper 
they would go over it with me and 
criticize it. Then I would rewrite it. 
After it was rewritten, they would 
go over it again and encourage me. 
I learned through my mistakes," 
another student, Barb Borkowski 
said. 

One of the tutors. Jeri Kane, a 
senior English major, explained 
that the idea behind the clinic is 
''to help students who have trouble 
writing and to offer this help 
through other students. We're not 
as intimidating, being students 
ourselves.·· 

Most students agree that the student tutor system has been quite effective. The tutors have encouaraged many students to gain confidence in their ability to write and to become self~sufficient in recognizing and handing their own problems. 
Terry Kerley, another tutor, observed that much of the problem is lack of self-confidence. "They come in very nervous and we try to relax them and make them feel that writing isn't a big pain. Many students find it more relaxing and informal to go to another student,'' she said. 
In general, faculty reaction has been favorable. English depart­ment chairman, Sr. M. Jean Kiene, said that she is "delighted" with the work of faculty coordinator,

Hearst's rape allegation disputed 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -A prosecution doctor said Monday that Patricia Hearst became "a queen'' in the terrorist army that kidnappedher and willingly joined in a bank robbery and sex with her captors. 
"She was a queen in the Sym­bionese Liberation army," Dr. Joel Fort testified at Miss Hearst's bank robbery trial. ''She brought them international recognition. She par­ticularly enjoyed the status and the recognition this brought her." 
Fort declared that Miss Hearst did not feel she carried the low rank of a "private in an army of generals." This directly contra­dicted the testimony of a defense psychiatrist who said Miss Hearst's low military status showed she was not a true convert to the tiny group. 
Aftl·r nearly a full day of testi­mony, Fort faced cross­examination by defense attorney F. Lee Bailey, who began by challeng­ing the doctor's qualifications to testify on the matters involved. Fort was still on the stand when court recessed, and Bailey was to resume cross-examination Tues­day. 

Earlier, Fort said he examined the heiress for 15 hours and testified that she told him she agreed to have intercourse with a man she accused from the witness stand of raping her. 
Fort, a physician with psychiatric training, also swore that he deter­mined from his talks with her that the 22-year-old defendant was fully converted to the aims of the Symbionese Liberation Army by March I, 1974 -less than one month after her violent kidnapping. 
"As I reconstructed it. probably 
Council members discuss possible future changes 
(continued from page l) 
callinL: someone on the carpet," said Brosious. 
Williamson was the only member polled who favors publication of the vote. Charles sees no objection to making one's vote known, and taking the responsibility for it. With a secret ballot, actual publica­tion is impossible, she added. 
The question of open meetings also elicited mixed reactions from the group. Burke said, "I would be delighted if we could have people come and observe." However, he cited lack of space as a reason for the impossibility of public meet­ings. 
Williamson, Fiorella and Brosi­ous arc opposed to open meetings, while Bula and Gassman see no danger in admitting the public. Charles would open the sessions, but "Frankly, I don't think any­body would come." 
Admitting the media to the sessions was accepted by most of the group. Richard Conklin, di­rector of Information Services and an official observer to the council, prepares a special press release which is the only official account of the meetings. 
Conklin commented on the pos­sibility of admitting the press, "I think the perception of some that the council docs not thoroughly discuss all sides of the issues is fostered by the fact that its debates arc not made public and I feel that opening its sessions to the public would be one of the best things the Academic Council could do in terms of public relations." 
Williamson sees no advantage in admitting the press. He thinks the way the releases are handled prevents "talk." 
Gassman strongly favors the inclusion of the press because "one person's review is not accurate." He commented, "I think that might go over in Russia, but not in the 
u.s." 
Gassman applauded Rev. Ferdi­nand Brown, associate provost, who records the minutes. "Father Brown takes pretty accurate min­utes. He does an excellent job." 
Finally, in response to Faculty Senate member Vincent De Santis' comment "that the Council is 'stacked' with assistants to the provost." Burke noted, "I was elected to the council first as a professor, then as a dean and now as assistant to the provost. I've got a perspective that many of the new people don't have. I know the workings of the thing." Burke, as mentioned earlier, has been a member of the council for at least 18 years. 
At the end of his interview, Bula summarized the attitude of all the members interviewed, ''The coun­cil as a whole is a basically honest, open group that is really willing to deal with the problems of the University as they come up."

by March l she had become a voluntary member of the SLA," he said under questioning by U.S. Atty. James L. Browning Jr. 
"She did not perform the bank robbery because she was in fear of her life," he said at another point. "She did it as a voluntary member of the SLA." 
As Fort began to discuss her sexual encounters with SLA "soldier" William Wolfe, Miss Hearst became agitated, shook her head negatively and appeared ready to jump out of her chair. Her attorney, F. Lee Bailey, placed a heavy hand on her shoulder as if to calm her. 
Miss Hearst had said on the witness stand that she "couldn't stand" Wolfe. But Fort said the defendant spoke to him of the now-dead Wolfe as one of three SLA members who were ''kind and nice and friendly to her and with which I gathered there were affec­tionate bonds." 
Asked by Browning to discuss Miss Hearst's allegation of rape, Fort gave this account: "In her interviews with me, she indicated at some point that it was brought up whether or not she would like to have intercourse with Willie Wolfe. She described agreeing to do that. She said among the reasons was because, 'It would help save my life.' 
"She said she had had inter­
course with him a couple of times 
prior to the bank robbery. She did 
not indicate he in any way forced 
himself on her or that directly or 
indirectly rape was involved." 
He said Miss Hearst also told him of a sexual incident involving Donald "Cinque" DeFreeze, the SLA field marshal she depicted as her second rapist. 
"She said once Cinque asked her to have intercourse with him and she said she had intercourse with him -to translate her word~ ­without affection." 
He added, "She said she did not have sexual relations with any of the female members of the SLA. ··
