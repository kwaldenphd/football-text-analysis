Across the nation, the victims were male in three offour instances, andmost were slain in single victim-single offender situations, the FBI report said. One ofevery five victims was related to his assailant, the report showed. The greatest number ofmurders, 43 percent, resulted from arguments.

'It Takes a Thief' 
Thieves are sneaking about on campus. Masked 
marvels, it seems, from all indications. Just 
think-someone had the nerve to go through 
the pants pockets ofaMorris~ey resident while 
he and a few friends were fast asleep on the floor. Yes, the pendulum is shifting slightly. Put the wave ofoff-campus on hold for a momentand take a look at the "criminal" activity on the homefront. 
Being right on top of the day-to-day news, The Observer has scooped the latest on "on-campus" crime with a lead story concerning thefts that occurred in Cavanaugh and Morrissey. It appears that it isn't your ordinary thief who's pulling the jobs. These thefts can not and .should not be blamed on some South Bend juvenile delinquent. The thiefwho may hit your room can be your next door neighbor, an acquaintance or even your roomate. Now don't go out and buy a gun or a knife in order to protect your domain. And don't go out to the hardware store and spend your remaining bank balance on chains and locks. This column is not meant to induce mass hysteria or paranoia. It is written as a friendly warning. 
. I'm not writing this purely from an objective level. In fact, three years ago, I encountered objects being taken from my room. What does a freshman know, right? I just thought that some­how in my mixed-up, confused state ofmind, I had banished them to never-never land. And then I started getting those "survival" packages from home-guaranteed my mom said, to keep me healthy, ifnot exactly wise. It was those times that I notice that small amounts of the food kept disappearing. For awhile I thought I shared a room with a sugar-starved rat. Until after I heard other people complaining of their things being swiped. Stealing is a very visual problem here.

OK-a few cookies is one thing. But having $50 ripped off and your football tickets taken is another. And to make matters worse, there are too many inconsistancies in stories and too many refusals to comment on thefts by security, hall rectors and the victims themselves. Sure, it doesn't look too "hot" to have alumni pick up The Observer and read about how their son or daughter had a couple ofbucks stolen. And sure, hall rectors don't want to point the finger of blame on one of their residents. 
But, hey, boysandgil:ls, thisisacoldcruelworld. Life, can be . extremely unpleasant at times, especially when you deal with human nature. But these unpleasantries must be faced Why hide the fact that people do steal? Because this is Notre Dame? Because Security is too busy busting happy hour kegs on Green Field? Or because you are afraid to face the fact that it could be someoneyou know who is doing the stealing? 
What do you do in the meantime? I don't know. A colleague ofmine isgoing to read this and tell me that like usual I don't propose any solutions to the problem. And every week my defense is always the same: No one can solve human madness. Least of all a mad person like me. 
Observer Notes 
In yesterday's edition, a front-page headline read "Campus organizations sponsor mock election". In fact, The Observer will be sponsoring the October 2 election, in cooperation with several campus political groups.

Pedi stated, and some com­mittee members confirm, that the decision was made with the concensus of the committee. "We kept the committee ad­vised of the situation, and when the time came to decide, the members were consulted." Pusateri was traveling in the Soviet Union at the time and was not consulted. 
Turzai, an adament opponent of the single-sex mandate did not agree.."They did it during the summer so there would be no publicity," he said. Turzai also complained that he should have been consulted and was not. "I never intended to give the committee wholesale auth­ority on theformal," he said. "I should have been consulted." 
Saint Maris Senior Class President Terry Hill disagreed. "If I appoint a committee, I trust them to perform theto the best of their j!Jdgement," Hill said. "If you don'ttrust them, then do it yourself." 
Turzai regards the affair as a matter of principle, despite the fact the Vice-President of Stu­dent Affairs Father John Van­Wolvlear eventually agreed to permit students to register in 


Foreign students meet 
All foreign students wishing to take the ESL (English as a Second Language) must register this week in the InternationalStudies Office. 
The ESL will be taught on Monday and Thursday nights, from 6:30 to 9 p.m. by Mrs. Sandra Hayes, a South Bend teacher and president of the Notre Dame Host Family. 
Also, an important meeting to outline University insurance vs. international insurance will be held tonight at 6:30 p.m. in the ISO. This meeting is important to all foreign students because their needs are not met by ND insurance coverage. 
single-sex groups of two."I'm 
just tired ofbeing treated like a 
child," he said."The University 
doesn't have the right to tell 
twenty-one olds whether or not 
they can have sex. I felt we 
should fight them." 
Turzai took his fight to the 

Senior Advisory Council.In a 
motion before the Council, he 
proposed that the Senior Class 
run the formal independently 
of the University."It was the 
one chance we had to show the 
University we weren't going to 
'PUt up with their motherly a­
ttitude towards us," Turzai said. 
"It was time students stood up 
and dtd something besides 
talking." , 
Council members, however, 

were afraid that the Administra­
tion would respond to such a 
move by restricting class ac­
tivities and funds. "Everyone 
was scared that the University 
would mess us up for the rest of 
the year," Council member 
Cindy Huot said. "They figured 
that people could just switd~ 
rooms when they got there." 
There were also problems with liability in case of a death or an accident connected with . the formal and financing of the event ifUniversity monies were refused."There was no way we could have done it," committee member Ann Hesburgh said. "We didn't have the money and the problem of liability was to~ great. It came down to having the formal with the single-sex doubles or not having it at all. 
The motion was defeated by a 

19-18 vote. 
"It's all so transparent," 

Turzai said. "The Administra­
tion is just trying to preserve 
their image as an upstanding 
moral institution, but they 
know everyone will switch 
around once they get there. It's 
all so fake." 
Pedi disagreed. "What the 

students do on their own is their 
business," he said. "We're not 
going to be checking rooms. 
However, we do want to ensure 
that no one is forced into an 
embarrassing situation." 
"I'm just disappointed that 

the Council didn't stand up for 
the class," Turzai said. ·~.'People 
would rather step around the 
rules instead of fighting for 
principle.We'll just keep get­
ting pushed around until we do 
fight."

Because of his background, George did not have the sam~ adjustment problems other Mexican-American students may have had. George represents the other end of the spectrum of Mexican-American students, but he does feel the kinship bonds that are characteristic of 
Mexican-Americans. 
The "compadre bond"-the taking of someone into a family so that they become like a blood relation -is very strong in Mexican-American culture. 
Pat Leonardo, Assistant Director of Admissions, noted that this kinship bond is a hindrance in the recruitment of Mexican-American students. Leonardo said that this bond, along with the geographical distance from home, means "we will have to be more aggressive to get the student." 
According to Leonardo, Notre Dame has a good reputation with Mexican-Americans and His­panics in general because there is a "natural relationship" in Catholicism. He also noted that the university is starting to work with Hispanic alumni this year to increase recruiting effectivness. 
Leonardo also feels the univer­
sity did a good job with the funds 
available for financial aid. Josie

their packages "weren't great", it

could provide.

A mask worked for the Green Hornet. The phantom has been wearing one for years. 
And professional wrestlers like the Masked Marvel use them as part of ther acts. 
Supposedly masks help make these entertainers famous while disguising them at the same time. It stands to reason if a mask would work for them it might work for a singer, too. 
Orion Eckley Darnell, who prefers to be known simply as Orion, is a singer who will appear Saturday at the Morris Civic Auditorium. He never parts with his mask. He says he's too ugly to take it otT. 
But his mask is only what this singer calls his "trademark." And it's only a small part of his image. This 6-3, slim, dark-haired pro­tege of Shelby Singleton, owner of Sun Records, sounds exactly like Elvis Presley, singing or talking. 
But despite persistent rumors that Orion is Elvis incarnate, te singer says it isn't so. 


Future domerspractice trudging to classes, complete with ND emblazenedbookstore appareL (photo by Helen 
Odar.) 
But that doesn't mean that his 
record company isn't taking ad­
vantage of his uncanny resem­
blance to the King. 
Orion is merely the singer's stage name. His character is based on a novel called Orion written in 1977, according to CountryStyle magazine. 
The book's main character, 
Orion Eckley Darnell, is a super­
star who lives a fishbowl life due 
to his fans' adoration. He grows 
tired of it and stages his own 
death, turning to the life of a 
recluse after fooling the world. 
But, he finds the life of a recluse 
boring, too, and takes to the stage 
agaitf. 

According to an interview with the author, Gail Brewer-Giorgio, in CountryStyle, she received a :telephone call in 1978 from a caller named Orion. Although she tried to convince the caller that there was no such person, that the character was merely in her imagination, the caller insis­ted "I am Orion and I was born 
today!" 
"I remember that day," said 
Sally Smash of Sun Records. "It 
was wild." 

She says Orion's past is kept 
deliberately hazy and that she really knows very little about him. She does know that he is a ·singer signed to fit the part of the 
Elvis-like character. 
· "The author of the book is 
being very cooperative in helping 
with the promotion," she said. 
During a telephone interview, 
Orion said he had known Ms. 
Giorgio before she wrote the 
book, after a quick consultation 
with someone in Shelby Single­
ton's office. 
Although he tries to keep his 
past vague, he says he's been 
"singing in the shower since I was 
a little boy" and has sung in 
church many times. 
He's a bit touchy about his 
mask and says that "nine out of 
10 people don't care about the 
mask. It's just part of the trade­
mark, like Kiss. They wear 
paint." He added that one of the 
mask's purposes is to keep his 
personal life separate from his 
professional identity. 
He says he writes some of his 
own music, "when the mood 
strikes me," and that he plays the 
guitar. He especially enjoys aud­
ience participation in his act. 
He's unmarried and says he's 
"23 and holding" and doesn't 
really mind the Elvis rumors, 
though he doesn't believe the 
King staged his own death. The 
magazine articles linking him 
with the late performer don't 
bother him "as long as they spell 
my name right." 

Reagan. charges 
Carter 
(AP)-Ronald Reagan charged President Carter with indecent political behavior yes­terday, while John B. Anderson .;aid the commander-in-chief was using "scare tactics" for claiming that the election this fall comes down to a choice between war and peace . 
The President's spokesman, Jody Powell, conceded Carter was guilty of an "overstatement of the case." 
But he also said the President feels his Republican opponent should "address himself to the implications" of what he said about previous statements cal­ling for U.S. military interven­tion overseas. 
Carter himself, meanwhile, outlined a policy of "strict neu­trality" in the conflict between Iran and Iraq, and urged other nations to follow his lead 
Campaigning in Reagan's na­tive California and in Oregon, Carter said there is no indication that American hostages in Iran have been affected by the hostil­ities between the two Middle East neighbors. 
The President issued a state­ment encouraging all countries, "including the Soviet Union, not to interfere with this conflict." 
But what triggered charges from his opponents was Carter's

Wednesday, September 2~, 1980-page 1 
N.D.S.G. :To be continued    
Despite whispered rumors to the contrary, this year's Student Qovernment has been alive and well. 
However, like any bureaucratic machine, it has taken us a while to get rolling. If every hour we've spent in meetings had tangible results, I'd be a lot happier and we'd all be much better off. Unfor­tunately, I'm not any happier and none of us is any better off. However, the ~eeds for change have been sown, and with a little more attention they'll soon sprout. 
The long-awaited plan for a Student Senate will be unveiled at the Board of Commissioners meeting this Sunday. We've taken constructive criticism from last week's meeting and have added 

insights from an historical analysis .F====================================================I 
covering the evolution of ND Student Government to our own 
~~:: ~~:c~~ewg~~ee~7::~~~~-the 
The final proposal of the com­mittee will suggest a· Senate of about 25 persons and will include representation from the HPC, Off­Campus, Class Officers, some members from the present Board of Commissioners and a group of eight senators to be selected from four districts on campus. In the future -hopefully after this fall break -the Senate will allocate resources, formulate and advance student policy, and present sound proposals to the University Ad­ministration. 
This will be the ad hoc commit-tee's final recommendation; how­ever, it will still be subject to 
change by  the  Board  of Com­ 
missioners.  If  it  meets  their  
approval,  the  reconstituted  

Constitution will be sent to the HPC for further debate. 
After that, we will hold several forums to receive more student input. Finally, the new constitu­tion will be submitted to the Student Body for approval by a two-thirds majority vote. 
No doubt the most immediate concern for Student Government this year has been the off-campus situation; here there is no simple solution. Off-Campus Commis­sioner Mark Kelley faces th~ difficult prospect of bringing together five groups (students, landlords, South Bend residents, university administration and South Bend police). 
But if we are to make any real progress it is clear that we the students must take the initiative. This Thursday, September 25, there will be a gathering of students concerned about their own safety. There will be speakers from the police department giving security advice, year-round resi­dents of the northeast neighbor­hood giving neighborly advice and beaten (literally) students giving healthy advice. 
In addition, there will be renter's insurance available, along with "Halt," a mace-like spray used by postmen to stop dogs in their tracks. There ·will also be a meeting between students, !arid­lords and administration tentatively scheduled for October 7. . 
No matter how you look at off­campus problems, it is obvious that many of them are caused by on-campus living conditions. 
For example, the towers now house almost 600 students apiece with a maximum party room capacity of 150. Even before St. Ed's burned, there was a lack of on-campus housing and social space. 
Furthermore, outlets that underclassmen used to have open are now unavailable: The Joe~! college bars are being harrassed; Michigan is now a "21" state; and section parties are, for the most part, outlawed. The result is that students have been flocking to the off-campus parties. 

ln response to this situation, Student Union, the social branch of Student Government, is spon­soring a Block Party on the north quad this Friday, a punk rock party in Stepan on October 3, and other campus-wide activities after break (for example, Halloween costume party, Sadie Hawkins Dance). 
However, such solutions are only short-term; we need a place to kick back and relax, such as a coffee house with live entertain­ment and a mellow atmosphere at all times. 
Instead of the Engineering Auditorium, we need a real movie theater. We need a bowling alley on campus and a swimming pool to splash around in (not one that more closely resembles the Indy 500). 
We're not necessarily asking for a huge complex that some say would become a white elephant. Modular student centers would be perfectly fine, but we need faci­lities -and fast! 
Don Murday, Carroll Hall President and SG Executive Coordinator, is heading up the push for more social centers on­campus. At the last Board of Trustees meeting, the problem was identified and recognized. When the next meeting in October 
P.J. Riehle 
comes around, we shall demand 
immediate action. 
The Student Senate, off-campus crime and social space are, no doubt, our biggest concerns. How­ever, Student Body Vice President Don Ciancio and myself remain true to our platform, and with the help ofour cabinet, much headway has already been made in fulfilling our goals. 
But for the present, I've run out of time and The Observer is out of space; for now, file this article under "To be continued." Next week you'll getmore exciting info on the accomplishments and inten­tions of those hard-working yokels that we're proud to call our Cabinet.

statement the night before that the election would decide "whether this nation will make progress or go backwards and whether we have peace or war." 
First Reagan declared the pres­ident was guilty of "inconceiv­able" and "unforgivable" state­ments. 
"To accuse that anyone would deliberately start a war is beneath decency," said Reagan, who told his audience in Carter's native South that he has seen four wars in his own lifetime. 
In a new charge of his own, Reagan added that Carter "lacks the vision and the will necessary to restore America's margin of safety and to preserve a genuine world peace." 
Reagan's running mate chimed in with his own criticism. Campaigning in Illinois, George Bush said, "I don't think the

Anderson launched his attack from Harrisburg. Pa., where he declared:"the choice is not peace or war." 
He said voters face a decision about which candidate can set the best foreign policy. "To suggest anything less than that is to demean the conduct of the campaign," he said. 
Anderson, whose attacks on Carter have intensified in recent days, added, "I will not condone any effort on the part of the president to use scare tactics to suggest that the election in November is a choice between peace and war." 
In a television interview in Los Angeles before he learned of either of his rivals' comments, the president reportedly said he did not intend to imply that Reagan would start a war.

The January lOth battle at .Marquette inaugurates Notre Dame's new TV season, with episodes planned at Maryland Ganua~y 24, 1:30 EST), in the ACC against UCLA (February 8, 2:00 EST), and against Virginia (February 22, 2:00 EST) and DePaul March 8, 1:45 EST). 
The latter two cont~sts will be played at the HorizonArena in Rosemont, a northern suburb ofChicago. The Virginia game is Notre Dame's home-and home series with the Cavliers while the Horizon is DePaul's new home court, the Blue Demons having finally outgrown legendary Alumni Hall. 
The two Horizon games are both scheduled for Sunday afternoons, which normally means a national TV appearance. The other three games are Saturdays, which may be either regional or national contests.

PeteJohnson, who had lost his starting fullback job to second­year year man Charles Alexander, may have regained it with his hard running. He led Cincinnati rushers with 19 car­ries for 65 yards. 
"This was a game I felt we had to win," Johnson says. "I said before the game, 'We're going to win today if I have to do it myself.' 
"I was hoping I'd get to carry the ball. For our passing game to go, we've got to establish our running game. I'm just glad I could be a part of it.''

leadsCincy 
ONCINNATI (AP)-Coach Forrest Gregg is impressed with the way quarterback Jack Thompson came off the bench Sunday to lead the-Cincinnati Bengals to an upset victory over the National Football League champion Pittsburgh Steelers. But it's too early for starter Ken Anderson to concede his job. 
"Jack Thompson helped our cause and his Sunday," Gregg 
says. "I don't know what Kenny's ssituation is. Youwould like to have him because he's been playing well and moving the team. ButI thinkJack gained a lot of confidence from this game. He's gotten better every week." 
Anderson aggravated the stretched ligament in his left 
If that's the case, Thompson will get his second start of the season -both times because of injuries to Anderson. And he seems to have convinced several veteran teammates that he's ready to step in. 
"I thought Jack played ex­tremely well. There were a lot of key things Jack did that people don'tnotice," wide receiver Isaac Curtis says. He was particularly impressed with the way Thompson stayed in the pocket to throw him a touchdown pass despite heavy pressure. 
"He was being pursued, but he hung in there and waited instead of dumping it off to a running back," Curtis says. "It makes me feel good that he had that con­fidence in me." 
Thompson surprised writers when he said his p·erformance Sunday was only his second greatest sports thrill.

makes a point. Pitt has been skipping along from 
pushover to pushover these last five years, en­
joying national recognition and national honors 
but actually coming no doser to the real national 
powers than watching them play on national TV. 
Just who do they think they're fooling? 
Certainly not the people ofPittsburghwho have 
found a plethora ofexcuses for not buying tickets 
to see the Panthersplay. 44,800 people showed up 
to see their home-opener. Not a bad crowd, but not very encouraging when youconsider that Pitt Stadium holds 56,500 and is located in a met­ropolitan area ofover two million people-most of whom are rabid football fans. 
Hey, the Steelers sell out every game and their tickets are quite a bit more expensive. But, then again, the Steelers are a national power. 
But so are the Panthers. Aren't they? 
The people at Pitt will tell you that the Steelers are a prime reason that people don't go to Pitt games. And that's easy enough to see, isn't it? Whatdoes it matter thatPittplays on Saturdayand the Steelers on Sunday? And tlie fact that last week, when Pitt was at home, the Steelers were on the road is irrelevent. It's obvious that all those people who didn't make the Pittgame were home warming up their TV sets for Sunday's game. 
Seriously, the public relations people at Pittwill have to come up with a better excuse for empty seats than that. Some cities support two 
So what's the real reason people in Pittsburgh blow off Pitt games? It might be because of the weaklings that come to play the Panthers. When Notre Dame visited Pitt Stadium, there wasn't a ticket to be found. Penn State is also a traditional sellout. However the fact remains that Pittdoesn't play enough good teams. Why don't they put an Alabama or a Texas or even a Southern Cal on the schedule. They'll not only sell more tickets, they'll also gain some credibility as a real national contender. 
C'mon, Coach Sherrill. If you wauna be a big boy, you gotta play with the big boys. Besides, what are you worried about? You can handle those guys. 
Can't you? 

Jaworski oozes UJith confidence 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) ­Ron Jaworski says the name of his game is confidence. 
The Philadelphia Eagles' quar­terback isn't talking about self­confidence. He's always had that. He's talking about the faith that Coach Dick Vermeil has in the "Polish Rifle's" ability to throw the ball. 
Vermeil's faith hasn't ·been misplaced. His unbeaten Eagles have won three games, and scored 104 points. Jaworski has triggered this offense with 56 completions on 83 attempts for 755 yards and eight touchdowns. Only two ofhis passes have been intercepted. 
Jaworski says the thing thathas made him a mature field director 
is that his teammates have e­
lected him a captain:­
"It's a great honor. I want to get out there and lead. I've always had confidence in my ability. Some people think I'm cocky. I'm not that at all. I just feel if they ask me to throw 100 passes I can complete 100," Jaworski said. 
The quarterback spoke after 
the Eagles smothered the New 
York Giants 35-3 in the National 
Football League's Monday night 
nationally televised game. 
"We proved ourselves to be a good football team," said Jaworski. "I don't know how far we are from being a great foot­ball team." 
Jaworski threw three touch­down passes against the Giants, completed 18 of29 for 240 yards, with one intercepted. He teamed with running back Wilbert Montgomery to beat the Giants for the lOth straight time since 1975. . 
Montgomery gained 87 yards running and 67 receiving-154 of the Eagles' 382 yards total offense. He was described by New York Coach Ray Perkins as the key to the game, a great . running back who simply thun­ders over the opposition. 
ButJaworski runs this team as ifhe were operating out ofa text book. He calls 10 percent of the plays. The rest come from Vermeil and the coach's aides. ­The quarterback, however, has
