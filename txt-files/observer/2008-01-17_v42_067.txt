Thieves burglarize student residences 
More than 20 off-campus break-ins reported during winter break; complexes step up security 

By JOSEPH MCMAHON News Writer 
For Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students in 10 residences at Clover Ridge Apartments and 11 at Stadium Club Condos, the fear of burglary became reality when thieves broke into their residences during winter break and stole several items, ranging from television sets to jars of change to pots and pans, man­agers at the housing complexes said. 
Police investigated the rash of break-ins on Dec. 27. Kristie Nozykowski, the property man­ager for Clover Ridge Apartments, said "there was no rhyme or reason" to what

thieves stole. 
"They didn't take a lot of stuff. In some of the apartments it looked like [the burglars] weren't even there. They actual­ly spent more time breaking in than they did stealing stuff," Nozykowski said. 
But she was still shocked by the break-ins, prompting Clover Ridge to hire additional security. 
"We've never had any break­ins, but we have always had a police officer that lived on site," Nozykowski said. "This is our first incident where we've had break-ins at Clover Ridge Apartments. Because our main goal is that they are happy and safe where they live, when the

ACE Consulting moves forward 
Under new director, program offers under-resourced schools free services 
By EMMA DRISCOLL News Writer 
The Alliance for Catholic Education (ACE) Consulting Initiative -a program that aims to provide under­resourced elementary and secondary Catholic schools with free consulting services -is underway with recent hires and plans. 
ACE Consulting appointed Stephen Perla, superintend­ent of schools for the Catholic Diocese of Worcester, Mass., as director, according to John Staud, ACE director. 
ACE Consulting is a response to the 2006 final report of the Notre Dame Task Force on Catholic Education, which was com­

missioned by University President Father John Jenkins and chaired by Father Timothy Scully, direc­tor of the Institute for Educational Initiatives at Notre Dame and ACE founder. 
The report, entitled "Making God Known, Loved, and Served," proposed the development of the ACE Consulting Initiative, "which will work to provide expert­ise to elementary and sec­ondary Catholic schools in a variety of areas, inCluding marketing, governance, board training, management, strategic planning, and investing." 
Under-resourced or strug­gling schools are often unable to afford key consult­ing services of this nature, Staud said. 

"A lot of Catholic schools do not have the resources to pay for consulting," he said. "We would hope that if a diocese is contemplating closing a school or parish, they would contact us first." 
Assistant Director of ACE Consulting Chuck Lamphier said there were about 60 applicants for the position of director. 
"We knew the decision would be an important deci­sion in the life of this pro­gram and. we were very pleased with who we could hire," he said.

News Editor 

Hilary Crnkovich will leave her job as vice president for public affairs and communica­tion at the University on Aug. 1, she announced Wednesday. 
Crnkovich said she is going to return to Chicago to be clos­er to her family. She has occu­pied her current position since March 2005. 
As vice president for public affairs and communication, Crnkovich has presided over events and initiatives including the inauguration of University President Father John Jenkins, the production of three Notre Dame forums, the redesign of the University Web site, the production of the University institutional spots during foot­ball game broadcasts and last October's tribute to University President Emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh in Washington, D.C. 
Crnkovich cited as one of her most meaningful undertakings at Notre Dame the Washington tribute, which honored both Hesburgh's 90th birthday and the acceptance of a photo­graph of him with Martin Luther King, Jr. into the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institute.

Professor reflects on student voters 
By DAVIS RHORER JR. 
News Writer 
Sean Savage, a political science professor at Saint Mary's, commented Wednesday on the role of college-aged voters in the recent Iowa, New Hampshire and Michigan presidential caucuses. 
A highly-regarded authori­ty on the American political system, Savage has given his insights on the recent pri­maries to a number of media outlets. 
"The youngest voters are more likely to believe voting is not the only way to be a good citizen," Savage said, contrasting the current gen­eration of college students to older Americans. 
Older voters, he said, are more likely to look at voting as an obligation similar to that of paying taxes or the military draft. Savage cited young Americans' frequent service in their local com­munities and the Peace Corps as two examples of how they are diversifying the idea of responsible citi­zenship. 
Savage identified a process he called "socializa­tion," or the steps taken by

Nevv Year's resolutions 
It is the time of year where 
inevitably the gyms seem to be more 
crowded. 

People are reenergized after a 
holiday break and, of course, it is 
the month of 

New Year's Madeline Buckley resolutions. People talk

more exercise, 
eating more 
vegetables and 

less earbs and finally attaining that 
perfeet 4.0 GPA for the spring 
semester. 

Every year, it always seems like 
the resolution fever lasts a few 
weeks at most and then dies down. 
Well, let me tell you, I hate New Year's resolutions. 
I hate them mostly because I have never once kept a New Year's reso­lution and I believe that this is the sad fate of resolutions for most peo­ple. 
IIonestly, what is the point of waiting until January to make an improvement'? 
I recently read an article listing the top 10 New Year's resolutions of the average American compiled from surveys. 
Here is the list of lof'ty aspirations: 
1) Spend more time with family and friends 
2) Get more exercise 
3) Lose weight 
4) Quit Smoking 
5) Quit Drinking 
6) Heduce stress 

7) Manage money better 
8) Learn something new 
9) Get a better job/promotion 
10) Become more organized. I wonder if there is a study on the success rate of these resolutions. 
I'm sure I could pick up the January edition of various maga­zines and they would tell me 10 easy tips for keeping my resolution. 
I'm guessing, however, that most people will find it difficult to keep their resolution or they will simply forget about it in a few weeks. 
If I want to improve something about myself, why wait until Jan. 1'? The mere fact that it is the new year is not enough motivation because it is not much more than a change in the calendar. 
Aside from new classes, my life is more or less the same. 
Changes should be made when a person feels the need. Why should people make changes just because it is now January once again? 
I think this is why most of my res­olutions are always doomed and once I slowly but surely give up a resolution what remains is a tiny bit of guilt. 
This year, I am firm in my decision to eliminate the guilt and not make a New Year's resolution. 
Why waste a perfectly good goal on New Year's when I know I won't keep it? Perhaps I will make a spring resolution, an end-of-the­year resolution or simply a resolu­tion when I want to. 
Then, at least, the motivation will be there.

Sex toy triggers bomb scare in Sweden 
STOCKHOLM, Sweden ­A Swedish bomb squad called out to disarm a suspi­cious package on Wednesday did not find a ticking bomb. But they did fmd a vibrating sex toy. 
A janitor alerted police after he found the package in a garage of an apartment building in Goteborg, the country's second-largest city, police spokesman Jan Strannegard said. 
The package was hum­ming and vibrating suspi­ciously, so police took no chances and sent out a team of explosives experts. After having cordoned off the area, they opened the package with bomb disposal equipment, only to find the battery-operated device inside. 
"The package was vibrat­ing when the janitor found it, but I think it had sort of died out by the time it was disarmed," Strannegard said.

Kroc Institute offers nevv Ph.D. 
New doctorate in peace studies among few offered in nation 
By MADELINE BUCKLEY 
News Writer 
The Kroc Institute is now accepting applications for its new doctoral program in peace studies, making Notre Dame one of the few major universities in the country to offer a Ph.D. in the field. 
The recent addition to the University's doctoral program will make Notre Dame a worldwide leader in peace studies research, said profes­sor Robert Johansen, director of doctoral studies at the Kroc Institute. 
The program will welcome its first class of doctoral stu­dents this fall. 
"Peace studies is a growing field because of a recognition that violence is not going away, and secondly, that we are not very well-equipped for knowing how to deal with it." Johansen said. 
The new Ph.D. program is designed "to turn out some of the leading peace research doctoral people in the world who will do research that gives us a much better understanding on how to pre­vent armed conflict from spi­raling out of control." Johansen said. 
The program's inception came after the Kroc Institute received a generous donation from 1953 alum John Mullen. chair of the Kroc Institute Advisory Council, and his family, a news release said. 
But before it became a reality, the program needed support from the University administration and academic departments such as political science, history and psychol­ogy. 
The proposal also had to be approved by the Arts and Letters Council, the Graduate Council and the Academic Council. 
"In each case we got unani­mous approval," Johansen said. "This was a very warm and reassuring vote of confi­dence for this program from the highest levels in the University." 
And that may be because the program fits well with the University's mission, he said. 
"Notre Dame is a natural for this in my view, Johansen said. "Our program looks a lot at ethical ques­tions that bear on major war and peace issues. This is something that Notre Dame is especially good at because of its Catholic heritage, which gives Notre Dame a special advantage with this pro­gram." 
Applicants interested in the peace studies Ph.D. will have to pass through two separate admissions committees and have excellent academic and service credentials, Johansen said. But academic ability is only a portion of the admis­sions decision. 
"We are looking for clear evidence from the applicants of a long-term commitment to peace building," Johansen said. 
Most doctoral graduates will likely teach peace studies and do research, Johansen said. 
"The program prepares people to beome scholars," he said. "But some will go into work with intergovern­mental organizations like the United Nations. Others may work within the diplomatic community." 
A third group, he said, might work with non-govern­mental organizations such as Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch. 
"We really think this is part of the Catholic mission," Johansen said. "Concern for all human beings in the world is uppermost. We need to look at the threat of vio­lence like doctors look at dis­ease. We need to find anti­dotes and ways to prevent them." 
The anticipated size of the doctoral program is of about 20 to 25 students, according to the Kroc Institute Web site. Approximately four students will be accepted in each incoming class. 
The deadline to apply for the 2008-09 year is Feb. 1.

RecSports touts new group-training 
By LINDSAY SENA 
News Writer 
Keeping that New Year's going­to-the-gym-more-often resolution may be easier this year with the help and supervision of profes­sional trainers for small groups of friends, a new workout option available to students through RecSports. 
In addition to the personal trainer program, RecSports cre­ated the small group-training program for students who like to work out with their friends, said RecSports fitness coordinator Shellie Dodd-Bell. 
"This gives them the opportuni­ty to learn some instruction and come play with their friends," Dodd-Bell said. 
While she said personal train­ers can be an easy way to "spice up" a dull exercise routine and "keep you from getting bored," Dodd-Bell believes having friends to exercise with will provide that "I ittl e extra motivation" that many students need to make the trip to the gym. 
Similar to individual personal training sessions, which first became available last February, small group personal training is sold in packages ranging from "Domer" (which indudes three sessions) to "Fighting Irish" (which consists of 10 sessions). Before beginning the actual training, students must take a fit­ness assessment, in which their body composition, muscle strength and cardiovascular endurance are evaluated. 
In addition to contributing to the students' motivation for exer­cising, group personal training is less of a financial strain than individual personal training, Dodd-Bell said. For groups of two students, the "Domer" pack­age costs $57 per person. For groups of four, each student has to pay only $48. Individual per­sonal training costs a student $69 for three sessions. 
Junior Patrick Kennedy said training in a group could create another incentive to fit a quick workout into his weekly routine. 
"I think it's a great idea. Unless I have something scheduled, it's hard for me to find the time to work out but if I had someone else with me, it would be much more fun," Kennedy said. 
But other students, like sopho­more Raymond Clark, may prefer to keep exercising on their own. 
"Working out is more personal for me. I'm individually motivat­ed, so I'd rather work out by myself," Clark said. 
The small group personal training program has ongoing registration and allows students to eustomize their fitness goals and request a male or female trainer.

To help Catholic schools overcome these challenges, ACE Consulting's first step will be to listen to the needs of the schools, he said.

Egypt endorses Bush's peace plan 
SHARM EL-SHEIK, Egypt-President Bush's fast-track plan for a Mideast peace agreement got a welcome endorsement Wednesday from a nation long seen as a key Arab mediator. Bush responded by pulling his punches on the human rights backpedaling in Egypt that has cooled relations with this longtime ally. 
The president closed an eight-day Mideast trip well-fed from several lingering meals with his Arab hosts and upbeat about what even some of America's closest allies say is an unexpected and ambitious drive. An Israeli-Palestinian agreement has eluded U.S. presidents for decades, and Bush didn't put much etiort into trying for the first seven years of his presidency. 
Bush had a message for skeptical Ar,ab states whose help he needs to make any accord stick and who doubt the president's intention to per­sonally shepherd a deal. "I mean what I'm say­ing," Bush said.

BAGHDAD -A female suicide bomber struck black-clad worshippers preparing for Shiite Islam's holiest day, killing at least nine Wednesday in an attack that highlighted insur­gents' widening array of tactics against a U.S.­led offensive in key areas on Baghdad's doorstep. 
A witness said people shouted slogans against al-Qaida in Iraq as they carried the dead and wounded from the blast scene near a market­place in Diyala province -a region of farmland and palm groves northeast of Baghdad that holds strategic havens for extremists.

Navy exempted from environment law 
LOS ANGELES -Conservationists on Wednesday blasted President Bush's decision to exempt the Navy from an environmental law so it can continue using high-power sonar in its training off Southern California -a practice they say harms whales and other marine mammals. 
The president's action by itself won't allow the anti-submarine warfare training to go forward because an injunction is in place, but the Navy believes it will significantly strengthen its argument in ceurt. A three­judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco is expected to make a determination on the future of the Navy exercises on Friday. 
The White House announced Bush signed the exemption Tuesday while traveling in the Middle East. In his memorandum, Bush said the Navy training exercises "are in the para­mount interest of the United States" and its national security.

Colbert photo hung at D.C. museum 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Stephen Colbert was denied when he tried to run for president this year in South Carolina. Now the fake TV pundit is getting some love from the eity of his birth. 
His portrait was hung Wednesday at the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery in Washington for a six­week showing in what the museum considers an "appro­priate place" -right between the bathrooms near the "America's Presidents" exhibit. Museum ollkials stress it's only temporary. 
"We agreed to go along with the joke and hang it for a short limn in between the bath­rooms," said rn usnum spokes­woman Bethany Bentley. "Let me tell you two key things here: !lis portrait is not coming into the collection, and it's not hang­ing permanently." 
That may come as a surprise to Colbert, who has campaigned for tlw honor and boasted on his Comedy Central show Tuesday night that his portrait was "hanging in the hall of presi­dents, just a few yards from the father of our country -exactly where I believe it belongs." 

Colbert, who plays a pompous conservative talk-show host on "The Colbert Heport" and recently tried to run for presi­dent as a Democrat, went to great lengths to persuade Smithsonian Institution officials he was worthy. 
The portrait -actually three portraits in one -depicts a debonair Colbert standing at a fireplace in front of a similar portrait of himself posing in front of the same mantel with a third picture of himself. 
After the work was rejected by the National Museum of American History, Colbert even­tually made his way to the por­trait gallery. Bentley said Colbert wasn't begging so much as "making his case." She said they welcome the conversation about whose portraits are included in the gallery's collec­tion. It was just not Colbert's time, she said. 
"Who's the competition? Who do I need to knock out of here to get me up?" Colbert asked gallery director Marc Pachter.

Student support for iTunes U is essential to bringing the technology to Notre Dame, Montes said. 
"From my understanding, the legal issues are almost resolved .... They want student support to make sure this is something that students arc definitely going to uti­lize within the classroom," she said. 
While Montes' committee is anticipating success in its endeav­ors, Community Relations chair Colin Feehan said his committee has forming a team that will work to give students the option of increas­ing their print quotas online.

IN BRIEF 
Wall Street down on day of fluctuations 
NEW YORK-Wall Street staggered through another volatile session Wednesday, closing mostly lower after a Federal Reserve report showed some economic growth at the end of 2007 and after Intel Corp.'s disappointing profit report. 
Stocks gave up a modest rally in the fmal 20 minutes of trading, continuing the fluctuations seen throughout the session as investors pored over corporate profit reports and economic news that supported varying views about the soundness of the economy. 
Stocks initially gained after the Fed report­its Beige Book survey of regional economies ­suggested economic activity increased modest­ly from mid-November through December, though at a slower pace than in a previous survey. 
The report seemed to quell some concerns about prospects for the economy that took on fresh urgency after Intel issued disappointing earnings after the closing bell Tuesday. 
The Fed's report bolstered enthusiasm among bullish investors who pointed to better­than-expected results from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. The banks' reports appeared to remind Wall Street that while the fallout of souring loans was widespread, it wasn't necessarily evenly felt. Buyout news in the tech sector also gave a boost to sentiment. 
Congress nears economic stimulus bill 
WASHINGTON -Under pressure to act quickly on the sagging election-year economy, Democratic and GOP leaders held talks Wednesday amid increasing optimism that the warring factions might actually agree soon on an economic stimulus bill. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 0-Calif., and Hepublican leader John Boehner of Ohio emerged from a rare meeting promising to develop legislation that would both provide a boost to the economy and pass with little con­troversy. 
"There is an agreement that we will work together to try to put together a package that truly is stimulative, that will happen quickly, and those conversations are going to continue in coming days," Boehner said. 

Fed: Economy losing momentum 
Retailers, builders, manufacturers to face more hard times as economic picture uncertain 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON Hetailers, home builders and many manufacturers should brace for even more rough times ahead, a somber Federal Reserve suggested Wednesday amid growing fears that the U.S. might be sliding into reces­sion. 
The Fed's snapshot of business conditions showed a national economy losing momentum heading into the new year and a future riddle.d with uncertainty. The persistent housing slump and harder-to-get credit are making people and businesses ever more cautious, it said. 
Separately on Wednesday, more big banks reported losses and said people were having trouble making pay­ments for everything from credit cards to cars. Stocks were mostly down for the day, the Dow Jones indus­trial average declining

Siljander charged in conspiracy


Marine suspected 
Ex-congressman indicted for raising money for terrorist group 



of fleeing country 
Associated Press 
JACKSONVILLE, N.C. -A Marine suspected of killing a pregnant comrade told friends he would flee to Mexico to avoid being convicted of raping her, and investigators said Wednesday they are working with Mexiean authorities to track him down. 
A wide-ranging manhunt for Cpl. Cesar Armando Laurean began last week, after authori­ties said he fled North Carolina and left a note in which he admitted burying the body of Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach, but said she committed suicide. The 20-year-old had accused him of rape. 
Investigators found Lauterbach's burned remains, and those of her 

The court documents are included with an FBI criminal complaint charging Laurean with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. He is also wanted in North Carolina on a state arrest warrant for murder. 
Laurean appears to have mailed letters back to his wife in North Carolina, according to two law enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investiga­tion. 
It was not immediately clear what the letters said, how many of them were sent or where they were sent from, but one of the officials said at least one of the letters was postmarked from Houston. 
Authorities have said Laurean's wife, Christina Laurean, is

"We strongly suspect, but have not confirmed, that J.aurean may be in Mexico," FBI spokesman Hichard Kolko said in Washington. "We have a strong working relationship with law enforcmnent partners in Mexico and we'rn working with them to l01:ate and apprehend him."

unanswered Wednesday. His attorney in Kansas City, James 
H. Hobbs, said Siljander would plead not guilty to the charges against him. 
"Mark Siljander vehemently denies the allegations in the indictment," Hobbs said in a statement. He described Siljander as "internationally recognized for his good faith attempts to bridge the gap between Christian and Muslim communities worldwide" and plugged the ex-congressman's upcoming book on that topic. 
The charges are part of a long-running case against the charity, which had been based in Columbia, Mo., before it was designated in 2004 by the Treasury Department as a sus­pected fundraiser for terrorists. The indictment alleges that lARA also employed a fundrais­ing aide to Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaida leader blamed for the Sept. 11 attacks. 
lARA has long denied allega­tions that it has financed ter­rorists. The group's attorney, Shereef Akeel of Troy, Mich., rejected the charges outlined in Wednesday's indictment. 
"For four years I have not seen a single piece of a docu­ment that shows anyone did anything wrong," Akeel said. 
The government accuses lARA of sending approximately $130,000 to help Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, whom the United States has designated a global terrorist. The money, sent to bank accounts in Peshawar, Pakistan, in 2003 and 2004, was masked as donations to an orphanage located in buildings that Hekmatyar owned. 
Authorities described llekmatyar as an Afghan muja­
hedeen leader who participated 
in and supported terrorist acts 
by al-Qaida and the Taliban. 
The Justice Department said 
Hekmatyar "has vowed to 
engage in a holy war against 
the United States and interna­
tional troops in Afghanistan." 
Siljander was elected to Congress initially with the sup­port of fundamentalist Christian groups, and said at the time he won because "God wanted me in." In 1983, he claimed that "Arab terrorists" planned to kill him during a pro-Jewish rally; the FBI and Secret Service said they knew of no such plot. Siljander attended the rally wearing a bulletproof vest. 
After leaving the government, he founded the Washington­area consulting group Global Strategies Inc. and, according to the indictment, was hired by lARA in March 2004 to lobby the Senate Finance Committee to remove the charity from the panel's list of suspected terror fundraisers. 
It's not clear whether Siljander ever engaged in the lobbying push, said John Wood, 
U.S. attorney in Kansas City. Nevertheless, IAHA paid Siljander with money that was part of U.S. government fund­ing awarded to the charity years earlier for relief work it promised to perform in Africa, the indictment says. 
In interviews with the FBI in December 2005 and April 2007. Siljander denied doing any lobbying for lARA. The money, he told investigators, was merely a donation from IAHA to help him write a book about Islam and Christianity, the indictment says. 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A former congressman and delegate to the United Nations was indicted Wednesday on charges of working for an alleged terrorist fundraising ring that sent more than $130,000 to an al-Qaida supporter who has threatened 
U.S. and international troops in Afghanistan. 
Mark Deli Siljander, a Michigan Republican when he was in the House, was charged with money laundering, con­spiracy and obstructing justice for allegedly lying about being hired to lobby senators on behalf of an Islamic charity that authorities said was secretly sending funds to ter­rorists. 
The 42-count indictment, unsealed in U.S. District Court in Kansas City, Mo., accuses the 
injury due to 

blunt force trau­ma," according to autopsy results released Tuesday. But authorities said the exam failed to answer all the questions detectives have about Lauterbach's death, including whether she gave birth before her death and of the identity of the father. 
Authorities believe Lauterbach was killed around Dec. 15. Marine officials have they attempted to find her after she failed to report to work on Dec. 17, but had evidence -includ­benefit of terrorists and con­spired with a former United States congressman to convert stolen federal funds into pay­ments for his advocacy," Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Wainstein said. 
Siljander, who served in the House from 1981-1987, was appointed by President Reagan to serve as a U.S. delegate to the United Nations for one year in 1987.

Protesters force suspension ofAntarctic whale hunt 
Japanese government says it will temporarily shut down operations after activists gained access to harpoon vessel 
Associated Press 
TOKYO -Protesters scored a victory in a high-seas campaign to disrupt Japan's whale hunt in the Antarctic, forcing the fleet to a standstill Wednesday while oflicials scrambled to unload two activists who used a rubber boat to get on board a harpoon ves­sel. 
The faceoff was a rapid escala­tion of the annual contest between the fleet that carries out Japan's controversial whale hunt in southern waters and the envi­ronmentalist groups that try to stop it. 
The founder of the Sea Shepherd anti-whaling group, Paul Watson, told The Associated Press by satellite phone that the Japanese arc tar­geting vulnerable whale stocks and said his organization will keep harassing the fleet. 
"We will chase them until they stop their hunt." Watson said from the bridge of the Steve Irwin. a Sea Shepherd vessel. "As long as we are chasing them. they aren't killing whales." 
Japanese officials said a Greenpeace boat also was shad­owing the whaling fleet. 
Watson claimed the two activists were being held as "hostages" on the Japanese har­poon ship Yushin Maru 2, but no Sea Shepherd boat had been sent to retrieve them. 
Japan condemned the inci­dent, calling the boarding of har­poon boat an act of "piracy" and accusing Sea Shepherd of stalling a handover of the activists to get publicity. 
Authorities repeatedly tried to contact Sea Shepherd to arrange a return of the activists, but the group didn't responding and its boat appeared to be speeding from the area, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tomohiko Taniguchi said. 
Taniguchi said the Japanese whaling boat was chasing the Steve Irwin in an attempt to return the protesters, but he declined to disclose the vessels' locations, citing security con­cerns. 
"These people aren't hostages, they're unwanted guests," he said. "We want them off our ship immediately, but they're not giv­ing us the chance." 
Japanese officials said Sea Shepherd must agree not to attack the whaling vessel during any rendezvous to turn over the two protesters. Watson refused to comply, demanding an "unconditional" release. 
"When people hold hostages and make demands, that's the behavior of a terrorist organiza­tion," he said. ''I'm not going to acquiesce to their demands." 
Japan was considering trans-. ferring the two activists to a third party, such as the Australian government, fisheries ollicials said. An Australian gov­ernment ship, the Ocean Viking, was in southern waters although neither side announced a han­dover deal. 
Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith called for caution on both sides.

RUSSIA 
Britishgroupaccuses policeofharassment 
Associated Press 
ST. PETERSBUHG -A British cultural organization accused Hussian authorities on Wednesday of harassing its staff and said it had temporarily closed its offices in St. Petersburg. 
The British Council, which acts as the cultural arm of the British Embassy. said the director of its St. Petersburg office was followed and stopped by Hussian law enforcement authorities and that intelligence agency officials had interviewed its Hussian employ­ees. 
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband described the Russian actions as an attack on the coun­
cil. Britain's Foreign Office said Hussia's ambassador to London was summoned for talks with British officials. 
"We've also heard very serious reports of intimidation and harassment of British Council offi­cials," Miliband told reporters outside Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Downing Street office. "Obviously we take that very seri­ously indeed. ... Any intimidation or harassment of oflicials is obvi­ously completely unacceptable." 
The new troubles came amid persistent tension between the two countries over the fatal 2006 poisoning in London of former Hussian security agent Alexander Litvinenko. 
The long-simmering dispute over the British Council flared this week after the orgartization defied Russian orders to shut its offices from Monday in St. Petersburg and the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg, which Russia says operate illegally. 
After an angry exchange Tuesday in which Britain's ambassador warned that action against the British Council would violate international law and Hussia's foreign minister accused Britain of colonial-era arrogance, Hussia's Federal Security Service said it was interviewing the coun­cil's Russian employees. 
The Federal Security Service, or FSB, said it was conducting "explanatory work" with the employees with the aim of "pro­tecting Russian citizens from pos­sibly being drawn into the Britons' provocative games as tools." 
FSB officials refused to com­ment further Wednesday. 
The British Council said its Hussian staff in St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg were "sum­moned for interview by the FSB at their headquarters and subse­quently visited in their homes late last night by officials of the Russian Ministry of the Interior and have been called for further interviews today." 
distance of the southern ocean. The capacity for adverse inci­dents is high, and the capacity for rescue or assistance is low," he said. 
An official at the Japanese Fisheries Agency, Takahide Naruko, said the fleet would not resume its planned hunt of about 1,000 whales until the activists were handed over. He said there was "no telling what Sea Shepherd would do" if the fleet hunted with the activists on board. 
The two protesters Benjamin Potts, 28, of Australia and Giles Lane, 35, of Britain ­jumped from a rubber boat onto the deck of the Yushin Maru 2 in the icy waters off Antarctica on Tuesday after a high-speed chase. 
Sea Shepherd protesters earli­er attacked the harpoon ship with bottles of acid and tried to entangle its propellers, both Japanese officials and Watson said. 
Watson claimed the two activists were not involved in throwing the acid and said they intended only to board the ship to deliver a protest letter. 
The men were detained and briefly tied up. Watson alleged the Japanese crew assaulted the activists, which Japanese offi­cials denied. 
"It is completely illegal to board anyone's vessel ... on the high seas," said Glenn Inwood, a spokesman for Japan's Institute for Cetacean Research, which organizes the hunt. "So this can be seen as nothing more than an act of piracy by the Sea Shepherd group." 

Japan sent ships to Antarctica in November to kill minke and tin whales under a program that skirts an international moratori­um on commercial whaling. 
The ban allows limited hunts for scientific research, a loop­hole Japan has used to kill near­ly 10,000 whales over the past two decades, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare. 
Opponents say Japan's pro­gram is commercial whaling in disguise because the meat is later sold on the market. Environmentalists say Japan's hunts are detrimental to vulner­able whale populations in the area. 

Japan's top government spokesman defended the catch. 
"The activists are obstructing what are legal activities in inter­national waters. and in an extremely dangerous way," Nobutaka Machimura said. "Japan strongly condemns these actions." 
The whaling fleet's mother ship, the Nisshin Maru, has been chased 435 miles from the standoff scene by a boat belong­ing to the environmental group Greenpeace, Japanese officials said. 
PAKISTAN 

Opposition urged not to hold rallies 
Musharraf cites terror threat in recommendation to other candidates 
Associated Press 
ISLAMABAD -Pakistan's government urged opposition leaders Tuesday to refrain from holding rallies ahead of next month's elections, citing an escalating terrorist threat. 
The party of opposition leader Nawaz Sharif quickly rejected the recommendation, accusing officials of trying block its cam­paign against President Pervez Musharraf. 
The political squabble comes in the aftermath of the Dec. 27 assassination of Benazir Bhutto, whose Pakistan Peoples Party is expected by many to emerge as the largest in parliament after the Feb. 18 elections. 
Musharraf came under heavy criticism for alleged security lapses that allowed suspected Islamic militants to launch a gun and suicide bomb attack on for­mer prime minister Bhutto as she left a campaign rally. It was one in a wave of more than 20 suicide bombings to hit Pakistan in the past three months. 
In apparent response to the accusations, the Interior Ministry on Tuesday issued guidelines to political leaders "for their safety and security." These included recommenda­tions to heed the advice of local police commanders on security matters and to keep authorities informed of their movements. 
"It is of paramount impor­tance that the political leader­ship is sensitized about the looming threat and asked to adopt a security conscious approach," Interior Ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema said. "Big rallies should be avoided as much as possible." 
Large political rallies have tra­ditionally been the main method to drum up support during elec­tion campaigns. Opposition groups say Musharraf's own party is unable to exploit this because of its declining popular­ity after it supported his purging of the judiciary and failed to contain skyrocketing food prices. 
Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League party denounced the government's guidelines. Party spokesman Ahsan Iqbal accused authorities of "playing with ter­rorist threat to stop opposition parties from reaching out to the people." 
"This is a failure of Pervez Musharraf. If he resigns, the law and order situation will become normal," Iqbal said. "This is intended only to stop the opposi­tion from campaigning." 
The United States hopes the elections will stabilize Pakistan, a key ally in the war against the Taliban and al-Qaida in neigh­boring Afghanistan. But militant violence in Pakistan's border regi<?ns -where support for the Taliban remains strong -has spread to the entire nation, seri­ously undermining public sup­port for the president. 

Al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden and his top deputy are believed to be hiding out some­where in the lawless tribal region straddling the Pakistan­Afghan border. 
Also Tuesday. a suicide bomber blew himself up when troops opened fire as he drove a car toward a checkpoint in Mohmand, a tribal region close to the Afghan border where a clash the previous day left 30 dead, an army statement said. A second militant in the car was killed by gunfire. 
On Monday night, a bomb explosion near a textile factory in the country's largest city, Karachi, killed 10 people and wounded 52. 
In a related development, three militants were found guilty Tuesday of plotting to kill Musharraf by setting off a car bomb near his convoy in Karachi in 2002. Judges said the car did not explode because the remote cont-rol device used to detonate it malfunctioned, according to state prosecutor Naimat Randhawa. 
The three were from the out­lawed Harkatul Mujahideen Al­Almi militant group, which police have blamed for a 2002 bombing at the U.S. consulate in Karachi that killed 14 people.

Days

speculated that Giuliani would gov­ern in a similar fashion, Jetting the terror­ists win a few rounds to build up their confidence before sweeping in to tako the day. 
What Colbert's witticism points to is the growing trend, especially in the realm of the tlm~e giant 24-hour cable news net­works, or viewing the electoral process in this country as a game. Giuliani's large­state strategy is merely one permutation of' ways in which candidates for the presi­dent of all 50 United States, with the media giddily tagging along for the ride, have thwarted and neglected the mission of campaigning to all the people of those 50 states in favor of gaming the system, showcasing and being hugely rewarded for skills which have little-if anything­to do with the awesome responsibilities of governing this nation. 
The greatest problem resulting from a eampaign structure which so easily invites dodges and misdirection is that the media become more interest1~d in the games­manship than the game. Aside from the possible exceptions of Senator John McCain's well-publicized collaboration with Ted Kennedy on illegal immigration and Mike Huckabee's oddly-intriguing support of the Fair Tax, no issues have really garnered traction in the primary election coverage. 
MSNBC might be the worst offender of the three major networks. After Iowa, I suggested that they change the station's acronym to represent "Must Say Nothing Besides Change." The network's talking heads spent hour after hour reiterating how each campaign had made use of the desire for change, how Hillary Clinton had perhaps erred in Iowa by trying to make herself out as a "change agent," when . most voters really saw Barack Obama as the apparent true candidate of change. What was lost in the discussion was any sense of what was going to be changed, why change was necessary, and how one candidate's version of change would be difl'ernnt from any other candidate's. 
The core of the problem is lazy journal­ism. Chris Matthews is not really interest­ed in the economy, or healtheare, or any­thing really, because he doesn't find those things fun. Elections are fun for him for the same reasons they arc alienating to an inercasing portion of Americans. Matthews laughs at negative attack ads that torture logic to the breaking point. lie smiles at the underhanded tactics employed with virtuoso precision by Hillary Clinton, wherein campaign stall' members make the less dignified attacks on the opposition, sueh as bringing up Barack Obama's drug use or the idea that Obama's support is a symptom of white guilt, giving the candidate herself distance from these unsavory remarks. Meanwhile, I doubt Matthews, or Brit llume, or Anderson Cooper with his "Best Poiitical Team on Television" even knows what Mitt Romney thinks about anything. I mean, of course, what Mitt Romney thinks now, not what he may have thought yes­terday, which could be wildly difl'erent. 
The sad thing is that the proliferation of news on television has somehow, almost inexplicably, led to the public being less well-informed about the world around it. There is so much time to fill on these net­works, and yet we get the same people talking about the same few things over and over again, with the election and its intrigues taking over this year from miss­ing white teenagers and murdered wives. 

In all this coverage, there is so little that 
could pass mustnr as true journalism or 
reporting as to be funny if the stakes 
weren't the identity of the leader of the 
free world. Arbitrarily assigning blame ({Jf 
tho discrepancy between the exit polls and

mporting, it is guessing. Crediting I Iillary 
Clinton's rise to her tearing up mildly at a 
rally is baseless and uninformative, the 
definition of the antithesis of news. 
Instead of having campaign stall' mem­bers on to disingenuously "analyze" the election process or de!imd thoir candi­date's doeision on which states and votnrs to ignore, the news networks could have people on to discuss the actual positions the candidates have. I would like to soc leading economisl<> on the air discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the Fair Tax.

I understand that there am avnnues f(>r me to discern this information on my own, through the Internet or elsewhere. I humbly submit that I am ashamed of my own lack of knowledge on certain topics. and while I am the most rnsponsible for this, I do believe that there is a tacit soda! contract being largely ignored by the news modia to actually report facts, not specu­lation. We in Ameriea need our news media to rise to the level of seriousness we would like to see in the campaign itself.

Find inspiration for New Year's resolutions 
Welcome back! Welcome to your new classes, new books, clean notebooks, your new professors and to the fresh start that a new year always brings. As a student, I used to feel as if I had three "New Year's" 
Kate Barrett 

-one on the first of January, and one at the beginning of 
Faithpoint

each new semester. 
With all the reso­lutions, plans and sacrifices we embark upon for New Year's we should all find ourselves daily-exercising, healthy-eat­ing, moderate-drinking, non-smoking, regular-praying, teeth-flossing, non­procrastinating, homework-completing persons of virtuous habits. Perhaps this year, this will be true. I won't hold my breath. Why? Because along with mak­ing all these earnest plans we make one common mistake: We believe it's all about us, that somehow we can become the people we want to be if we just try hard enough. Well, maybe that's true for flossing and exercising, and sometimes for dieting, but instead this could be the year we hear the call to a true conversion of heart, to new depths in our love for God. And maybe then a lot of other things will fall into place. This year, Lent begins awfully early-Feb. 6, to be exact. So early that by then, you certainly won't have given up on your New Year's resolu­tions yet! 
Since we're about halfway in between New Year's resolutions and Lenten sacrifices, here's an idea you could use for either. It has two parts. First, read the gospels, the story of Jesus' life, public ministry, death and resurrection. You can move around between all four of them, or just pick one. The Church is reading Matthew this year; you could start there. As you read, notice -really notice -what Jesus is like. Second, ask-really ask -God to help you try to be like Jesus. 
I suppose it would be easy to think, "Jesus' life was so different than mine. It would really be a stretch to think entering into his life will help me live mine." Though he may have lived under different circumstances and in a different culture, Jesus became human precisely to show us how to be human. And that's all God wants from us as well: that we live our human-ness to the fullest. To the extent that we can, we will start looking a little more like ... Jesus. 
It wouldn't be boring, being like Jesus. First of all, he enjoyed life. He made sure a big party had plenty of wine; he loved to eat with friends; he told stories that the disciples had to puzzle out to understand. He could be demanding; he got angry at injustice; he hung out with unexpected people and confused and irritated the religious and political leaders of the time. He didn't stand idle when he knew another was in need. He had the charisma to convince mere acquaintances to drop every bit of their livelihood and follow him on an unknown and improbable journey. 
All of this does come back to those pesky New Year's resolutions, by the way, as well as to the Lenten sacrifices you may already be considering. Jesus certainly got plenty of exercise; he had no other way but walking to get any­where. He probably ate right, simply because he didn't have as many unhealthy choices as Martin's, McDonald's and Starbucks offer us. Even when it meant leaving everyone else, from his dear friends to great crowds of people, so that he could be alone with God, Jesus made regular prayer a priority. He didn't appear to be a procrastinator; he started warning the disciples quite early on that things would seem to end badly for him. More importantly, however -much more importantly-Jesus lived, prayed, made choices, acted upon those choic­es, and loved, all with his relationship to God as the foundation and center of his life. If we could do the same, maybe we would take better care of ourselves out of gratitude because God created us. Maybe we'd pray more regularly just because we wish to spend more time with the Lord. Maybe we would treat others with the utmost respect 

and honor because we can see our 
common bond in our creation and our baptism. 
Jesus tells us in John's gospel, "I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done ... " (Jn. 13:15). Though this passage comes from a specific moment in the story, when Jesus has just washed the disci­ples' feet, we can remember that everything about Jesus' life sets us an example. In the still-fresh newness of 2008, perhaps our most significant res­olution ought to be to ask God to help us follow that example as closely as we can.

Cold-hearted tech firms block progress, charity 
Optimism abounded when Nicholas Negroponte announced his goal to design the $100 laptop, an item that could improve learning for millions of poor chil­dren in developing countries. Finally, it 
seemed advanced Brian Solomon 
technology would help the disadvan­taged among us and The Dartmouth do more than just increase the stock values of Silicon Valley companies. 
Unfortunately, some of those cold-heart­ed, profit-mongering corporations such as Intel and Microsoft lack the morals to assist this noble effort, and instead choose to stand in the way of progress and charity. 
Negroponte-co-founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Laboratory and the non-profit organization, One Laptop Per Child -built the innovative "XO" laptop to account for many of the problems that underprivileged students encounter. 
For example, the computer has a built-in hand crank to charge the battery in places where electricity is sporadic. The computer also comes with long-range wireless, a ver­sion of the open-source operating system Linux, and an interactive interface that allows users to communicate and work with others nearby. 
While the price still hovers above $150, many students around the globe, in places like Peru where 270,000 XOs have already been distributed, will soon be reaping the benefits of such cheap technology. 
But the executives at entrenched soft­ware and hardware companies are more interested in padding their bottom lines than helping kids. 
Intel Chairman Craig Barrett mocked the XO laptop as a "$100 gadget," saying, "What people are looking for is something that has the full functionality of a PC... that can run all the applications of a grown-up PC... not dependant on hand cranks for power." 
His remarks miss the point of OLPC com­pletely. The XO laptop is not intended for use by corporate offices, or even college students; the project is geared toward put­ting computers in the hands of people who are so impoverished that they have most likely never touched a full-featured PC before. 
Even within the United States, the city of Birmingham, Alabama has agreed to pur­chase 15,000 laptops for its students. 
The truth is that companies like Intel do not care about the hundreds of millions of people who have entered the 21st century unable to read a book or even sign their names. 
Although in the last year Intel spoke about contributing millions of dollars to the cause and constructing a microprocessor to use in future generations' affordable lap­tops, it pulled out of its deal last week amidst claims that it had stabbed its non­profit partner in the back. 
Turns out, Intel has its own ambitions about supplying cheap computers to the developing world -for profit. According to Negroponte, for months Intel has been urg­ing countries that may be potential XO-cus­tomers not to buy the device because the company is releasing its own low-cost lap­top, the "Classmate PC." 
Just as Intel has been sabotaging its fledgling teammate, the software behe­moth Microsoft has also been antagonistic toward OLPC and its mission. While the company views emerging markets as an important next frontier for its Windows operating system -and founder Bill Gates said that they have "always believed in cheap PCs" -Microsoft has refused to col­laborate on giving the XO dual-boot Windows XP support. 

The company's shortsighted goals pre­vent it from embarking on a mission that could both help millions of children and expand its market share into the develop­ing world of computing. 
We should not strive for communism, but perhaps capitalism has gone too far when companies seek to crush a well-meaning nonprofit with a great chance of making a difference in thousands, or even millions of lives. Is a little respect, or even -dare I say it-help, too much to ask for? 
The OLPC goal is not dead yet, but given the resistance to its philosophy from the corporate world, it will not be long before its efforts to bring education to far-flung reaches of the globe are cut short. In addi­tion to more basic supplies, laptops for poor students around the world could help bridge the so-called "Digital Divide" and encourage growth, learning and hope in small communities everywhere. 
When will Intel and Microsoft see that?

Time Magazine, Entertainment Weekly and the Chicago Tribune have all called it "the best show on television" and yet as HBO's "The Wire" enters its fifth and final season, the show still lacks a large mainstream following. Despite its crimi­nal under-appreciation by the masses, "The Wire" promises to return to its roots as one of the hardest hitting, most innovative and best dramas in the history of television. 
Set on the mean streets of Baltimore, Md., "The Wire" depicts a grim picture of urban life in inner city America, follow­ing the ravaging effects of the drug trade and the accompanying violence and crime it stains the streets with. 
In its first season, "The Wire" con­cerned itself primarily

down that empire. The gay, and by doing so, 
show derives its name from a wiretap the police set up in order to build a case against Barksdale's crew. However, in subse­quent seasons the show expanded from its original status as a cops-and-robbers drama to an inner city magnum opus sprawling across all facets of urban life in Baltimore, including the politics of police work, the politics of education and the politics of politics. 
The best part of "The Wire" is that the show doesn't try to push a message about morality -it just portrays real life through fiction and shows things the way they are on the drug-and crime-ravaged streets of urban America. The show por­trays the horrors and hardships of drug abuse, wanton violence and killings relat­ed to the drug trade in colors as bleak and unrelenting as the cement jungle landscape the show sets itself on. 
MATT HUDSON I Observer Graphic 

"The Wire" wouldn't be the show it is without its stable of characters, which span from cops to criminals and from high-class politicos to homeless people. A talented and versatile cast of no-name character actors have assumed their roles with poise and a gritty sense of reality. Like the best forms of fiction, "The Wire" doesn't have any eut-and­dried cookie cutter character molds. Instead, the people populating the world of "The Wire" sound and act like real human beings. with all their flaws, imperfections and seemingly eontradicto­ry natures. "The Wire's" key theme is that nothing is set in black and white ­the show creates several penumbral areas of gray. 
For example, one of the main charac­ters, Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominie West) is a stubborn, persistent hound of a cop and is very good at what he does, but

"The Wire" challenges conventional norms of masculinity and homosexuality. 
Politician and Mayor Tommy Carcetti (Aidan Gillen) made a lot of campaign promises to cleanse the streets of crime and work to protect the children, but as he takes the job the exigencies of the office and his own political goals cause him to alter his original aims. 
Series creator David Simon's commit­ment to continued excellence has paid ofT through "The Wire's" first four seasons. Now as he draws several of his ongoing storylines to their final close and adds a few new wrinkles to the mix, it's a good bet he'll close out the series with the same level of excellence with which he started it. 

Drug kingpin Marlo Stanfield (Jamie Hector) has left a trail of bodies In his bloody rise to the top, but the pollee have started uncovering his handiwork.

NBA 

Celtics end two-game skid with win over Blazers 
Wallace scores 36 points in Bobcats' upset win over Magic; Knicks record third-straight victory over rival Nets 
Associated Press 
BOSTON Hay Allen impressed teammate Paul Pierce with his shooting. For Allen, satisfying himself proved to be a tougher task. 
Allen scored a season-high 35 points, Kevin Garnett had 26 and the Boston Celtics rebound­ed from their first consecutive losses of the season with a 100­90 win over Portland on Wednesday night. 
Allen, who scored 26 points in the second half on 9-of-13 shooting, wasn't about to get caught up in the excitement of his scoring. 
"Every time I leave here I feel like I've left something out there on the table," he said. "I feel that way right now. There were some shots I should have knocked down." 
The 12-year veteran had Pierce enjoying his work, though. 
"It was great to watch. When you've got a hot player like that who's done it so many times throughout his NBA career, you just try to ride the hot hand," Pierce said "We just tried to get him the ball as much as we could. He made plays off the ball, on the ball and finished it with the shot." 
The Atlantic Division-leading Celtics, who had lost three of their last four games and two straight at home, also got 12 points from Pierce and 10 from Eddie House. Boston had lost its last two games, both to Washington. 

Brandon Roy led the Northwest division-leading Trail Blazers with 22 points. Travis Outlaw and Jarrett Jack each had 17. 
Portland, which lost for just the third time in 21 games over­all, fell to just 6-12 on the road. 
The surprisi"ng Trail Blazers may have come into the game hoping to compete with Boston instead of working like they have so far this season. 
"I don't think we believed we could beat them," Roy said. "We've been playing to win lately, but tonight I think we just came in to give them a good game. The next time we play them we have to believe that we can actually beat them." 
Allen scored 12 points, including eight straight in the third quarter, helping the Celtics take a 7 4-69 lead after three. 
Portland tied it at 56 before Kendrick Perkins' free throw moved the Celtics ahead for good. House followed with a 3 from the right corner before Allen took over, scoring off drives to the basket three times and hitting a pair of free throws to give Boston 68-63 lead. 
After the Trail Blazers cut it to 71-69, Allen completed his quarter with a reverse layup. He then opened the fourth with a jumper from the right base­line on Boston's first possession and Tony Allen had a break­away dunk, giving the Celtics a

78-69 advantage. 
Portland cut it to 80-75 on 

Outlaw's 3 with 7:55 to go, but 
Ray Allen hit a key 3, followed 
that with a turnaround jumper 
and added a 3 with 50 seconds 
left to help Boston seal the win. 
Ray Allen capped his second half with four free throws in the final 31 seconds. 
"They showed why they're the best team record-wise in the league right now," Portland coach Nate McMillan said. 
Portland led 45-43 at half­tiple. 
Bobcats 99, Magic 93 
The Charlotte Bobcats' awful start this season might be too much to overcome, but the fourth-year team is finally start­ing to look like a playoff outfit. 
Behind 36 points and 14 rebounds from Gerald Wallace and late-game heroics from Jason Richardson, the Bobcats rallied from a 19-point third­quarter deficit Wednesday night to stun the Orlando Magic 99­93. 
The Bobcats fourth win in six games -all against teams above them in the standings ­still left them eight games below .500. But suddenly Charlotte is full of confidence and perhaps close to reaching its potential. 
"It's very satisfying but we still have a long way to go," first-year coach Sam Vincent said. "We're 15-23. If we were .500 then we'd be getting close to being happy." 
The latest in a stretch of wild finishes and big wins left plenty of smiles in the Bobcats' locker room. 
Richardson, who scored 26 points, hit a 3 with the shot clock running down with 31.2 seconds left to put Charlotte ahead 93-88. Raymond Felton and Richardson then combined to hit six straight at the foul line as the Bobcats avoided a season sweep to the Southeast Division leaders. 
"That's big for us. It shows a lot of growth," Richardson said. "This team is growing every game." 
Dwight Howard had 24 points and 21 rebounds and Carlos Arroyo came off the bench to score 17 points for the Magic, who went on a turnover spree after point guard Jameer Nelson left in the third quarter with a strained tendon in his right foot. 
"Our turnovers were mindless and mindboggling," coach Stan Van Gundy said of the 19 times the Magic threw it away. "You've got to be able to handle the ball. When you have a 19­point lead and a good veteran team that handles the ball solidly and makes solid plays and doesn't break down defen­sively, then you're probably going to win that game. But we didn't do any of those things. It's frustrating." 
Charlotte, which had been 0-3 against Orlando this season by an average margin of 13 points, took its first lead since 9-8 on Richardson's 3-pointer with 
8:20 left. Matt Carroll's 3 with 
5:50 left made it 88-82. 

Orlando, struggling to run its offense with Arroyo and Keith Bogans, went nearly four min­utes without a point until Hedo Turkoglu's driving layup made it90-87. 
Richardson then hit his 3 and the Magic fell to 16-9 on the r 
Knicks 111, Nets 105 

For the first time since Jason Kidd showed up in New Jersey, the guys on the New York side are having more fun in the Hudson River rivalry. 
Jamal Crawford scored a sea­son-high 35 points and hit a tiebreaking 3-pointer, leading the Knicks to a 111-105 victory Wednesday night over the New Jersey Nets that gave them the season series for the first time in eight years. 
Zach Randolph added 24 points and 11 rebounds for the Knicks, who are 3-0 against their cross-river rivals after the Nets had owned them for years. New York hadn't won the series since going 3-1 in the 1999-00 season, with New Jersey bring­ing a 24-4 mark, counting the playoffs, into this season since Kidd's arrival in 2001. 

'Those guys really put it to us for a long time. As long as I've been here, every time we played them it seemed like we lost," Knicks center Eddy Curry said. "But as of late, last time we played them very well and tonight we played them very well. I think if nothing else we showed them that they're not going to be able to beat up on us every time they play us." 
New York has won three in a row for the first time in a year, all without starting point guard Stephon Marbury, who is side­lined by a sore left ankle that he believes will require surgery. Curry finished with 17 points and Nate Robinson had 13. 
"Our resiliency, just persever­ing, we're starting to play with the type of grit that we were playing with last year," Knicks coach Isiah Thomas said. "I thought New Jersey, they were tough tonight, and we got off to a pretty rocky start but our team battled back." 
Two of the Knicks' three road wins have come in New Jersey, where they hadn't won twice in the same season since 1994-95.

AP New England wide receiver Randy Moss answers questions Wednesday regarding his alleged assault of Rachelle Washington. A hearing is scheduled for Jan 28. 
Patriots receiver Moss accused of assault 
Associated Press 

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. ­Randy Moss joined the Patriots this season deter­mined to avoid off-field problems. Now he's in the middle of one, just days before Sunday's AFC championship game. 
A temporary restraining order was issued Monday · requiring the star wide receiver to stay at least 500 feet from a woman who alleged he committed "battery causing serious injury" to her at her Florida home on Jan. 6. 
Moss denied the allega­tion by Rachelle Washington, which he called "this situation of extortion," and said he 
McMackin hired as Hawaii 
bead coach 

HONOLULU -Greg McMackin's first head coaching job was with the Warriors of Aloha High School in Oregon. Now, 40 years later in the land of aloha, he has come full circle. 
McMackin was hired as Hawaii's football coach Wednesday after serv­ing as its defensive coordinator last season on a team that went undefeat­ed until losing the Sugar Bowl. ­
He replaces June Jones, who left the Warriors to coach SMU less than a week after they were routed by Georgia. McMackin agreed to a five­year deal that will pay him $1.1 mil­lion a season, making him the highest paid coach in school history. He will earn 10 times his 2007 salary. 
The 58-year-old former assistant with the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks said the Warriors will not change their wide-open offense that flourished last season behind NFL-bound quarterback Colt Brennan. 
was "furious" about it. The restraining order was issued in the Broward County 17th Judicial Circuit of Florida. 
A hearing on whether to issue a permanent restraining order is sched­uled for 3 p.m. Jan. 28, six days before the Super Bowl. 
Moss broke his usual midweek silence as he was surrounded by two dozen reporters and 10 video­cameras at his locker on Wednesday. He didn't identify the woman but said she has been a friend for 11 years and that she asked for "six figures" for what he said was an acci­dent in which she was hurt. 
"I want to make some­thing clear," Moss said. "In my whole entire life of liv­ing 30 years, I've never put my hand on one woman, physically or in an angry manner." 
David McGill, the attor­ney for Washington, had no comment, according to his legal assistant, Melissa Miller. A telephone mes­sage left by The Associated Press with Moss' attorney, Jim DiPiero, was not immedi­ately returned. 
In his previous nine sea­sons seven with Minnesota and two with Oakland -Moss was involved in several off-
O.J. Simpson violates bail 
terms 
lAS VEGAS-An angry judge dou­bled O.J. Simpson's bail to $250,000 on Wednesday for violating terms of his original bail by attempting to con­tact a co-defendant in his armed rob­bery case. 
Simpson, clad in jail attire, grimaced as the amount was announced and meekly acknowledged that he under­stood. 
"I don't know Mr. Simpson what the heck you were thinking -or maybe that's the problem -you weren't," Clark County District Court Judge Jackie Glass told Simpson. 
"I don't know if it's just arrogance. I don't know if it's ignorance. But you've been locked up at the Clark County Detention Center since Friday because of arrogance or ignorance -or both." 
Glass said that the initial court order to not contact other defendants was clear and she warned that if anything else happened Simpson would be locked up. 

field incidents. 
"This is a negative," he said of the latest allega­tion, "a black cloud hang­ing over my head, and that's something that I did not want coming into the season.... Everything I tried to do from getting here early, to make sure I eat the right food, all the way to practicing and playing, I wanted all of that to be A-plus. 
"Everything's been posi­tive, so why would I bring something negative on. As much as I care and love the game of football and love my teammates, I would never put myself or them in a situation of something like this." 
Sparano hopes to fix 
Dolphins' problems 
DAVIE, Fla. -Discussing his new job as Miami Dolphins coach, Tony Sparano sounded like Tony Soprano. 
''I'm just happy to be part of the fam­ily," Sparano said. 
The family includes his mentor, Bill Parcells, and general manager Jeff Ireland, who are transforming their new team into the Miami Cowboys. 
Sparano is the latest transplant from Dallas. He was the Cowboys' assistant head coach before accepting an offer Wednesday to rejoin Parcells and Ireland. 
The trio worked together in Dallas when Parcells was head coach in 2003-06. 
"I know what the people here are capable of, and I'm excited about that," Sparano said at a news conference. 
Parcells sat in a corner of the room, smiling occasionally like a proud papa. He declined to meet with reporters, leaving the talk to his proteges.

NHL 

Islanders beat Devils for fifth-straight time 
Associated Press 
NEWAHK; N.J. -The New York Islanders have the New Jersey Devils' number, and it's starting to bug the perennial Atlantic Division champions. 
Hiek DiPietro had 37 saves and Bill Guerin scored two goals in a 3-1 vietory Wednesday night that gave the Islanders their fifth win in as many games against New J1-1rsey this season. 
"We just seem to play well against them," said DiPietro, who has given up five goals in four games against New Jersey this season. "You find if you play long enough, there aro eor­tain toams you play well against. The last eouple of years, it has been the Devils." 
Mike Sillingor also seorod for Nnw York. whieh has won four · or tho live meetings in regula­tion. Tho Islandors have won six straight ovorall against the Devils. 
Travis Zajac scored for Now Jersey, which had a three-game winning stroak snapped in los­ing for only the seventh time in 26 gamos (19-5-1 ). 
"It doesn't take a rocket sci­entist. dons it'!" Dovils forward l'atrik 11lias said or the Islanders' streak. "Thoy are playing woll against us. Th11y aro playing well against Philly and us. Thosp, arP big points to lose. We had our opportunities to gnt back in tho game, but it's still disappointing to lose. Tlwir goaltender played awesome tonight." 
DiPintro was spectacular in tho third period, stopping 15-of­16 shots, including one in close by Dainius Zubrus in the final 90 sneonds that had the Devils 
cnntP.r looking up at the rafters in the Prudential Center. 
"Th~nl wore a eouple of pucks whaeked away and I was able to get my glove up on it," DiPietro said of Zubrus' shot from Jess than 10 feet away. 
Guerin  downplayed  the  
Islanders' dominance.  
"Jiave wn  eome  out on  top  

every gamo? Yns!" Guerin said. "It's not like it's been a domi­nating effort by us eaeh and every single time. They have been good hockey games." 

DiPietro, who shut out the 
Devils in his only other game at 
the Prudential Center, had to 
work hard in the final six min­
utes to preserve the win. 
Brian Gionta, whose shot was deflected by Zajac on the Devils' goal, had a good chance from the right circle with six minutes to play. Jamie Langenbrunner, who was stoned in close early in the game, was stopped in close again seeonds later. 
Zajae and Zubrus were also stopped in close in the final minutes. 
"Tonight, Hieky saved us a couple of points," Guerin said. "I thought we played a solid game, but when they turned it up and got good scoring oppor­tunities, Ricky was there. He saved at least four goals I ean think over. He kept us in it. He's been doing it all year for us." 
The Devils are now winless in nine games against their New York-area rivals, including an 0-2-2 record with the Hangers. 
"Nine straight is something we have to take notice of obvi­ously," Langenbrunner said. 
"It's nine straight against the Now York teams," Gionta added. "We have to tinct a way to win." 
The Islanders had a two-man advantage when Guerin gave thorn the lead with less than five minutes to go in the first period. Colin White and Mike Mottau were both given two­minute penalties at the same time. 
Rangers 2, Sabres 1 
The setting was the regular season instead of the postsea­son, but the stakes seemed nearly as high for the New York Hangers and Buffalo Sabres. 
Not since the seeond round of last year's playoffs had the Hangers faced their Eastern Conference foes. Buffalo moved on to the conference finals then, and now both clubs face a sec­ond-half struggle just to get back into the tournament. 
Petr Prueha and Brandon Dubinsky each had a goal and an assist to lift the Rangers to a victory Wednesday night that stretehed the Sabres' losing streak to 10 games. 

Buffalo snapped its run of three straight shootout losses, but couldn't find a way to win. The Sabres haven't eome out on top sinee a 6-5 shootout victory at Philadelphia on Dee. 22 (0-5­5). 
New York jumped from 1Oth place to eighth in the East with the win, five points in front of No. 11 Buffalo -the team with the NHL's best record last sea­son. 
The Rangers shook off 

Monday's poor 4-1 loss at Pittsburgh and earned their seeond eonseeutive win at home. Still, New York has won only twice in eight games (2-5­
1). 

"Obviously, we've had a bad string, but for our team and our season's sake, we've got to turn the eorner and make sure we're bringing that effort and intensi­ty every night," Dubinsky said. 
The Sabres are trying to get out of their doldrums. They picked up some points recently by losing in overtime, but that's not enough. They are two losses from matching thp, worst win­less skid in franchise history. 
"It's better than getting blown out," goalie Hyan Miller said of the Sabres, who have lost by more than two goals once dur­ing the skid. "We're right there and it's "something to build ofT of'. 
"It's frustrating any time you lose and when you put yourself in this kind of' position in this league."

AUSTRALIAN OPEN 
With baby looking on, Davenport bovvs out 
Sharapova defeats new mother in second-round match 
Associated Press 
MEI.BOUHNE. Australia Maria Sharapova looknd up and spotted a 7 -month-old kid staring hnr down. 
"I thought I saw lwr little kid g1v1ng me dirty looks," Sharapova said. 
The boy, Jagger, was eourt­side. llis mom. Lindsay Davenport. winner of throe Grand Slam titles and with a 1!J-1 record since returning to thn tour, was across the net. 
Sharapova beat Davenport 6-1, 6-3 Wednesday night to move into the third round of the Australian Open against a fellow Hussian, Elena Vesnina. 
"Tell you thn truth, I approaehnd it like it's a final," said Sharapova, straying from her 'one-match-at-a-time' mantra. "Ever since I took a penk at the draw and saw that Lindsay was second round." 
Davenport was only five tournamnnts into a eomeback after giving birth to Jagger last June. Still. Sharapova was preparing for a matehup wor­thy of the second week of a major. 
"You probably don't get to see too many second rounds where you see two Grand Slams champions, former No. 1 s playing against each other," she said. "The buildup to the match, the excitement, the showtime -l love that. As an athlete, that's what you play for." 
And that's probably what brought Davenport back. 
"It was fun. The crowd was great. I wish l could've given them a little more to cheer for," the 31-year-old Californian said. "The key was starting off' well, and l really didn't do that." 
Sharapova never faced a break point. She broke for the fourth time when Davenport nettnd a forehand on seeond match point. 
''I'm disappointed with the way this mateh went and this tournament went, but l have to look big pieture at this point in my eareer," Davenport said. "So far it's gone pretty well the last few months." 
Justine lienin could say the same about her time back on thn tour after a marriage broakup that kept her from Melbourne last year. She domi­nated the rest of the 2007 sea­son with a 63-4 record, includ­ing wins at tlw Freneh and 
U.S. Opens. 
ller 6-1, 7-5 victory over Hussia's Olga Poutchkova on Wednesday extended the Belgian's streak to 30 conseeu­tive wins since an upset semi­f'inal loss to Marion Bartoli at Wimbledon. 
No. 3 Jeiena Jankovic, who had to save three match points in a 22-game third set in the first round, had a routine 6-2, 7-5 win over Edina Gallovits in the second round. 
Serena Williams made a eomeback of her own last year, eapturing an eighth Grand Slam title with an emphatic victory over Sharapova in the Australia Open final only three weeks after one of her worst career losses in a tournament at Hobart. She was ranked No. 81 and was only the second unseeded woman to win a Grand Slam title. 
Now ranked No. 7, she's growing in confidence for an Australian title defense. ·she improved her record to 25-1 in her five most recent trips to Melbourne Park with a 6-3, 6­1 win over China's Yuan Meng. 
Sister Venus, whose first­round win was her first at Melbourne Park since a fourth-round exit in 2005, is in the opposite half of the draw. 
Venus, ranked No. 8, plays Camil Pin first up on Vodafone Arena on Thursday, with No. 2 Svetlana Kuznetsova begin­ning play on center court against Tsvetana Pironkova. 
Roger Federer is next at Rod Laver Arena against French veteran Fabrice Santoro, play­ing in a record 62nd Grand Slam tournament. Federer has reached the finals of the last 10 majors, winning eight of those to move within two of Pete Sampras' record 14 Grand Slam titles. He's 27-1 at the season's opening major since the start of 2004.

Luke Harangody has thrown his hat in the ring for Big East player of the year considera­tion. lie's leading the league in scoring (19.3 points per game) and is fourth in rebounds (9.6). Harangody had some trouble contending with the double­team agairist Marquette Saturday, but fared much bet­ter against Cincinnati Tuesday, seoring 24 in the second half. 
Guard Kyle McAlarney lit up Connecticut for a career-high 32 points and has developed a consistent touch from the out­side after some early-season struggles. McAlarney is also well on his way to perfecting the floater in the lane, which has enabled him to score over guys seven or eight inches taller than he. 
Meanwhile, Hob Kurz is as steady as always, averaging 
13.8 points and 8.3 rebound;; per game. 
But for everything the Irish are doing well right now, the 92-66 blowout at Marquette showed what can go wrong. 
If Ilarangody or McAlarney has an off-night shooting, oth­ers need to pick up the slack. It could be Tory Jacksop finding his way inside, Luke Zeller or Hyan Ayers (whose defensive efforts are almost as unappre­ciated by the casual observer as Kurz's overall career at Notre Dame) nailing a few more three-pointers and fight­ing their way inside, or Zach Hillesland using his size and quickness to find his way to the basket. 
All of that could happen ­but it hasn't very often this sea­son. 
Against Marquette, 1-larangody had 29 points and Kurz added 11, but no one else scored in double figures. 


If Notre Dame expects to compete with the upper eehe­lon of the Big East, especially on the road, it needs a little more help from its role players on the nights when Harangody is held in check by someone a little taller than him -like 7­foot-3 Hasheem Thabeet of Connecticut-or when McAlarney faces tough one-on­one defenders, like he did against Marquette. Not every team in the Big East has a Thabeet, or guards as quick as Marquette, but the upper-level teams, like Georgetown and Pittsburgh, do. 
Right now, Notre Dame could easily finish 12-6 in conference and make the NCAA Tournament, but with a little extra boost from its supporting cast, the Irish can challenge for the league title. 
Notre Dame faces its biggest test of the season Saturday when it goes on the road to face Georgetown. The Hoyas are on a bit of a downturn, struggling at home against Connecticut and falling at Pittsburgh, but then again, Marquette was in a similar situation Saturday. 
And we all know how that turned out.

NCAA BASKETBALL 
Tar Heels edge Georgia Tech 
Hansbrough's blockwith seconds left keeps North Carolina perfect 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -North Carolina usually does its best work at the offensive end. 
This time, it was a defensive play that kept the top-ranked Tar Heels perfect. 
With Georgia Tech poised to pull off a monumental upset, Tyler Hansbrough made a game-saving block in the clos­ing seconds and the Tar Heels escaped with an 83-82 victory over the pesky Yellow Jackets on Wednesday night. 
Hansbrough scored 27 points, bullying inside for shots and drawing one foul after another, but he saved his biggest play for the end -getting a hand on Zack Peacock's shot that could have won it for about the second attempt. 
"It was the cleanest shot you'll ever get in a basketball game," he moaned. "Next time, it's going in." 
Hansbrough finished 7 -of-14 from the field and kept getting to the foul line, where he had more attempts (15) than Georgia Tech's entire team (1 0). The burly, 6-foot-9 junior made 13 free throws, and North Carolina needed every one of them. 
"My face really got beat up, '"'said Hansbrough, who also had 11 rebounds. "It was really, really rough." 
North Carolina is off to its best start since the 1985-86 team began the season with 21 straight wins. Another encour­aging sign for the 
the Yellow Tar Heels: This is
"My face really got 
Jackets. their first 3-0

Danny Green NCAA champi­
put North Carolina (18-0, 3-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) ahead by making one of two free throws with 22 seconds remaining. 
Georgia Tech (7-9, 0-3) had a chance -a couple of them, in fact. Peacock retrieved the loose ball after Hansbrough"s block and got off another shot with 3 seconds to go. It rimmed out, allowing North Carolina to escape. 
Peacock insisted that some­one hit his hand on the first shot, but he made no excuses onship. 
This season, 

they have won all but four of their games with double-digit blowouts. North Carolina came into Atlanta averaging 92.2 points and win­ning by an average margin of 22.1. 
With snow covering the ground outside after a rare winter storm in Georgia, the Yellow Jackets almost pulled off an even bigger surprise. They put together an 11-2 run for their biggest lead of the game, 63-56. 
Anthony Morrow hit a 3­pointer falling down and Peacock completed the spurt with a basket on the inside. 
In the unaccustomed role of playing from behind, North Carolina responded. The Tar Heels worked hard for second chances and pulled even at 70 on Ty Lawson's three-point play with 8:52 remaining. 
But the Yellow Jackets· kept matching North Carolina shot for shot. D'Andre Bell hit a jumper to reclaim the lead for the horne team. Lawson scored on a fast-break drive to make it 72-all. Georgia Tech took off the other way for Peacock's dunk. 
It was close to the end. Jeremis Smith hit two free throws with 1:13 remaining to make it 82-82, and Georgia Tech squandered a chance to go ahead when Morrow missed a jumper from the corner with the shot clock running down. 
Green was fouled by Peacock on the rebound, and walked to the other end of the court to shoot two. Only one went in, but that was enough to give the Tar Heels another victory. -­
''I'd rather have the winning points than the winning point," "Green quipped. 
Smith led the Yellow Jackets with 15 points, Peacock had 14 and Morrow added 13.' Freshman Gani Lawai also had 13 but fouled out with more than 5 minutes remaining. 
Georgia Tech scored three more baskets than the mighty Tar Heels, including eight 3­pointers, but couldn't overcome their 21-of-26 showing at the foul line.

t.hn 6-4 load in the first five 
minutns of thP gamn. With 
l'etnrs on the court, though, 
Notre Dame took the game 
hack in its own hands. 

Thn strong Irish prnss con­tinued to forrn turnovnrs as Notre Dame stn~tchnd its lead. Dnspitn staying strong up top, Notre Dame struggled to dnl'nnd the Wildcats' three­point game. Villanova went 9­for-1 (J from tlw three-point linn. lnd by Junior Lisa Karcic, who madn' thnH~ for four. 
McGraw knnw the Irish had thnir work cut out for them. 
"That was ,.LL great win for us," Mdiraw said. "[Villanova[ is a rnally diffieult team to guard, thny obviously shoot tiHl throe very Willi." 
The game also brought an excess of fouls from both sides. Villanova headed to tho locker room af'tnr the 11rst half with eight fouls, Notre Dame with six. 
The Irish were able to con­trol tlwir fouls in the second half and finished the game with 12: Villanova had 18. 
This made tlw difTerencn for the Irish as they went 17-for­18 in free throws, just one shy of the tnam record. Villanova only wnnt three for four from the line. 
The match wasn't all ups for Notre Dame. With 4:55 lel't in the first half, Lindsay Schrader was down on the floor grab­bing h1~r left knne. McGraw said she was immediately con­cerned, since the guard had torn her right ACL last October. 
"Bad memories went through my mind and I was worried," McGraw said. "Siw's benn such a big key for us and she's hav­ing such a great year you hate to see that happnn." 
Schradnr re-entered the game in the second half. after doctors said she had hyper­extendnd her knee, whieh was not enough to knnp her on the bench. 
Schrader came back for the Irish to finish the game with 12 points. 
Laura Kurz. sister of Notre Dame men's basketball captain Hob Kurz. led Villanova with 20 points. 
Notre Dame had some trou­bln with the ball as the Villanova defense succeeded in foreing 19 turnovers from the Irish. but McGraw wasn't too worried. 
"I don't think they're the type of turnovers you worry about because they weren't bad de<~isions," she said. 
Notre Dame's athleticism helped slow Villanova's offense for the win, Villanova coach llarry Perretta said. 
"When have you have ath­leticism that disrupts any­body's of'fense," Villanova coach Perretta said. 
Petnrs' role in Notre Dame's press isn't always to get the ball herself. 
"!My role isl really to got in their vision and really just force them to through it long so other people can get the steal," Peters said. 
Note: 
+The game started with a moment of silent prayer for Notre Dame faculty member Patricia McAdams, a longtime Irish fan who was injured in an accident on her way home from the West Virginia game Sunday.

beat Peters, she used the only outlet available to her 
to take out her frustration. As Peters backed into the 
lane, Karcic reached around and popped her in the jaw. 
Unfazed, Peters found guard Lindsay Schrader for the layup, then proceeded to steal a pass, run the length of the court, and make both free throws after she was fouled attempting a layup. 
By disrupting Villanova's offense, Peters put together one of her best games of the season. 
"She's everywhere. She takes up a lot of ground," Villanova head coach Harry Perretta said. "She's guard­ing our guards. She's faster than our point guard." 
Along with her 15 points, which came on 5-of-8 shooting, Peters had six rebounds, three blocks and seven steals in the game. No player has had seven steals in a game since Megan Duffy did it on Jan. 


30. 2005, when the Irish ended No. 9/10 Connecticut's 112-game winning steak at home against conference oppo­nents. She was also perfect from the foul line, hitting all five free throws she took. 
Peters made a living on the block underneath the basket and waited for a lob pass from her teammates. Once it came, her adeptness at turning for the lay-in made life difficult for defenders. 
Her natural affinity for defense made itself appar­ent as soon as she entered the game. Seconds after entering the lineup, she tipped a cross-court pass that resulted in a turnover and scored on the ensuing Irish possession. 
"Our game plan changes when she comes in the 
'
R 
RAM
' . 
game because she can do so many things, so many things well defensively," Irish coach Mul'f'et McGraw said. "We really want her on the floor as much as we can have her there." 
Villanova's offense suiTo­cated when Peters partiei­pated in the press. ller height and long arms got in Villanova's way, and her quick feet carried her back and forth as she blanketed the Wildcat guards. 
Villanova guard Siobhan O'Conner's eyes grew wide with fright as Peters descended on her during the press. Indeed, the Wildcat offensive machine suffered technical difficul­ties and at times lost even the ability to dribble and pass when Peters applied pressure.

Grit and determination 
Irish top Wildcats / for second Big East win in three games 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA Sports Writer 
Villanova loads the nation with the fewest turnovnrs per gamtl, but that didn't stop Irish freshman Devereaux Peters rrom playing her role. 
Peters forcnd seven of Villanova's 24 turnovers in Notrn Danw's 69-58 win over Villanova Wednesday night at the Joyce Center. 
The Irish felt Peters' impact as SCHill as she stepped on the court at 15:4 7 in the first half'. Slw grabbed her first steal only 20 seconds into the game and put her first two points on the board just 29 seconds later. 

"She's a really good defender in the rront of the press and I think she makes a difference in our press, which is why we were able to force the turnovers tonight," Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw said. 
Villanova looked strong com­ing out of the gate and took

That may work fine in math, but it hardly applies to the wild and crazy Big East. 
Pittsburgh sufl'r.rs injuries to two key players, loses to Villanova, but some­how pulls it togethnr to knock oil' league-favorite <;eorgntown. Wnst Virginia handily beats Marquette, but Marquette turns around and crushes Notre Dame, who beat West Virginia nine days earlier. DePaul, who was 4-7 out of eonfnrence, startnd the Big East 3-1. Most teams have played four conference games, and nobody escaped without at least one loss. 
So how can Notre Dame pull through the mayhem and finish near the top of the Big East

standings? 
A little balance. 
Notre Dame (13-3, 3-1 Big East) is one of six teams with one loss atop the conference standings. Before the season began, the Big East coaches picked Notre Dame to fmish ninth in their preseason poll. Last year, the Irish were 

picked 11th, and finished fourth. 
Judging by the way they played their first four games, Notre Dame can finish that high again this year -maybe even a little higher.

Peters' efforts on both ends of floor spur team to win 
After 37 minutes of basket­ball. Villanova forward Lisa Karcic was frustrated. Her team was down by 10 points, and they couldn't mount a comeback despite shooting 
56.3 per" cent ft·om behind the arc. 
But she had to be frustrated with Irish freshman forward 

Devereaux 
Peters. All Sports Writer night, Peters had disrupted the Wildcats offense, throwing her lanky limbs in front of shots and passes and destroying Villanova's momentum. She had also lived on the block all night and finished with a career-high 15 points.

Kessler's record night powers Belles to win 
Senior guard scores 41 as Saint Mary's tops K-Zoo, 72-69

Alison Kessler rebounded from a slow start during Wednesday's game against Kalamazoo, scoring a school­record 41 points in the Belles' 72-69 win. 
The Saint 
Mary's sen­ior guard missed her first two shots and had a turnover early in the first half. 

She didn't Kessler get on the board until five and a half min­utes had gone by. Once she started, though, Kessler never stopped. The Belles edged Kalamazoo for their third conference win of the season. Kessler, the only Belle to score in double figures, shot 14-27 from the field and pulled down nine rebounds in the win. Despite Kessler's stellar per­
formanee, the Hornets (4-10, 1­5 MIAA) went shot-for-shot with the Belles for the first half, always staying within at least six points. 

After the break, Kalamazoo took a 42-41 lead at the 16:41 mark, and stretched that lead to 12 with 7:48 left in the game. But Saint Mary's took a 70-69 lead after a layup by Kessler with 34 seconds remaining. 
Twenty seconds later. Kessler iced the game and scored her 40th and 41st points with two 
free~throws. 
Sophomore Anna Kammrath was the Belles' second leading scorer with eight and junior forward Erin Newsom chipped in eleven rebounds. 
Kalamazoo senior guards Kelsea Howell and Therese Demres led the Hornets, scor­ing 22 and 19 points, respec­tively. 
With the win, the Belles reached .500 both in the MIAA (3-3) and overall (7-7). 
The team hopes to continue its success Saturday at home against Tri-State. The contest with the Thunder will be the second home game for the Belles this season, and the first since Dee. 5 when the Belles lost to Calvin.
