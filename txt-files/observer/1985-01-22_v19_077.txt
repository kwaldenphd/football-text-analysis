Winter cold requires extra caution 
By DIANNE MCBRIEN 
StaffReporter 
Despite temperatures which plunged below zero last weekend, it was business as usual on the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's campuses. 
With wind-chill temperatures of thirty or more degrees below zero, however, it takes common sense and planning to keep one's self and one's car warm and win­terproof. 
Students need to protect their bodies against the weather, said Registered Nurse Harriet Joyce of the Notre Dame Student Health Center. She warned of frostbite, "We've been seeing a lot ofit in the last few days--mostly the uncovered spots, like fin­gertips and earlobes." 
Symptoms of frostbite include glossy white appearance and itching or stinging sensations in the affected skin. Blackened skin indicates advanced frostbite. Joyce recommends gently thawing the affected area with warm water or chafing. 
The layered look is more than just fas­hionable this winter. "A lot of layers help insulate body heat," said Joyce, who sug­gested that students should not go out un­less it is absolutely necessary and they are warmly dressed. Joggers should cover their mouths with scarves to block freez­ing air from rushing into their lungs. 
Students also should be careful not to mix drinking and exposure on chilly nights, Joyce said. She explained that alco­hol dilates the blood vessels, which causes loss ofbody heat, making the drinker espe­cially vulnerable to low temperatures. 
Notre Dame Security Director Glenn Terry suggested several ways that students can protect their cars from the cold. He recommended the use of light oil and an­tifreeze, as well as "keeping the battery well charged." 
Terry emphasized that students must use caution when planning to travel, and that they should listen to radio and televi­sion bulletins or dial numbers listed in the front of the telephone directory for road conditions. 
Weather can affect Notre Dame 
ByJOHN-JOHN AMORES 
StaffRepporter 
The blizzard-like conditions andrecord­
breaking cold that swept through South 
Bend this past weekend not only caused 
concern about overexposure and frostbite, 
but also fueled hopes ofpossible class can­
cellations. 
With regard to extreme weather condi­tions, the decision whether to cancel classes at Notre Dame is officially made by Provost Timothy O'Meara, since it is con­sidered an academic decision. However, the decision is also made with the coopera­tion of the associate provosts, and the in­formation gained from the local weather, police, and highway detachments. 
Associate Provost Father Edward Malloy 
said that in his ten-year experience on the faculty ofNotre Dame, there has only been one instance of classes being cancelled, and that was for a five-day weekend during the winter of 1977-78, when the city was at a complete standstill. 
Malloy said that the first consideration during inclement weather is the safety of faculty and students, and that if the situa­tion warrants, classes will be cancelled. yed. However, Malloy also said that the people of South Bend are used to the "rigouous" climate, and have a tendency to make it through difficult weather. 
Ifclasses were cancelled, though, Malloy said that the decision would be made promptly and relayed to the individual dorms, as well as announced through the local television and radio stations. 
The recent winter weather, although cold, has not affected the operation offood services. William Hickey, the director of food services at Notre Dame, said that all workers have been able to reach the dining
halls, and althou8b tbcrc .....____ difficulty in getting the trucks started, nothing has been held up. In fact, the only effect that the cold weather has had is to increase the number ofstudents using the dining halls and the Leprechaun Pizza ser­vice. 
The extreme winter weather of the past few days has brought to mind some of the other memorable winters in South Bend,

A civil action suit was filed against Texas Tech 
University administrators by the Student Services for Lesbians/Gays and Friends after the group was denied recognition as an official campus organization.

More than $165,000 was raised by Notre Dame for United Way in its recent campaign. This is S3,000 more than the goal the University set as part of the St. Joseph County 1984 United Way Drive. It also sets a University record. William McLean, assistant dean of the law school and chairman of the University United Way Cam· paign said he attributed the success of the drive "to the hard work of a lot ofvolunteering people and the compassion and generosity ofall elements of the Notre Dame family." In addition to the $7,500 con­tributed by students, 1,600 administrators, faculty, staff and retirees of the University donated money to the cause. Employees of the Notre Dame Credit Union, Ave Maria Press and WNDU and members of the Holy Cross Order also were "willing participants" in the cam­paign, McLean said. -The Obseroer 
Eric Voegelin, visiting professor at Notre Dame and 1974 recipient of an honorary degree, died Saturday in Palo Alto, Calif., at the age of 84. He was a retired distinguished scholar at the Hoover Institution at Stanford. He taught six semesters at intervals of two or three years at Notre Dame. Born in Germany, he was ed­ucated in Vienna, and was the author of"Anamnesis," published in Munich in 1966, and "Science, Politics and Gnosticism," published in Chicago in 1968. He is survived by his wife, Lissy. -The Obseroer 
A 68-year-old plumber came forward yesterday in Chicago as the man who fatally shot a knife-wielding youth during a robbery attempt, and police said they considered him "a victim" and did not plan to arrest him. Harold Brown, who said he had been robbed before, told reporters he regretted the incident, but added, "I didn't have any choice." Brown's attorney, Thomas Royce, said, "He is a victim ofa crime. He is not a vigilante. If he had not shot, he wouldn't be here right now." -AP

Job at Court teaches compassion from a new point of view 
Fortunately, for most Notre Dame and Saint Mary's 
students, the only glimpse they get ofthe U.S. court sys­
tem is due to an occasional speeding ticket or being 
around the Five Points area at the wrong time. 
Traffic court, however, is only one small part of any 
city's court system. But contrary to what many televi­
sion shows would have you believe, the rest is not 
devoted to ·Jife-and-death child custody cases and 
alimony battles. 
Working at the Circuit Court of Cook County, Ill., during the summerand Christmas break, exposed me to the most frequent users of the courts -the poor and the disabled. While on television Blake Carrington fights to save his oil company, this is the time of year that many are trying to save their homes and their paychecks. 
The Cook County Court system is among the largest in the world. Over six million cases a year are handled, and civil trial court, garnishment court and eviction court carry most of that volume. The garnishment courts pick up where trial courts leave off. Once a defendant has been proven

year. Although it is against ~.>EMifi>'.T the law in Illinois to throw anyone out on the streets during the winter, the court was overflowing with 
landlords and tenants each day. Mothers, hoping for sympathy, carried babies into court and pleaded with the judge. Lawyers threaten tenants with the sheriff, and the possibility offorced eviction. And out in the hall, the landlords and tenants fought, threatened, and argued, until the bailiff kicked them out. 
Watching this process go on, and being involved in it, was a fantastic experience. The most interesting part of the job, however, grew to be observing the attitudes of my co-workers. 
During break, I worked with a sophomore ftom an­other prominent Catholic university in the Midwest. The contempt he showed towards defendants was amazing. His attitude was consistently, "If they're too lazy to go out and work, they deserve what they get."

Most schools like to think they are turning out graduates who are bright, talented, and concerned with improving the world around them. But it seems to be these same privileged people, who give themselves the luxury oflooking down the nose at those they don't see as "measuring up" to their view ofhard work. 
My other co-worker was a woman in her 50s, who had been working in a courtroom since the age of 18. Never married, but with three children, she went out of

Many applicants fabricate resumes 
Special to The Observer 
Looking for a new job and feeling 
self-indulgent? If you fabricate your 
resume to find that job, you're 
among one-third of all job seekers 
who attempt to boost themselves in 
the eyes ofa prospective employer. 
lfyou "give" yourself an M.B.A. to boot, you've awarded yourself the most common of manufactured degrees. 
Some signs of the "ringer" are evi­dent, according to Robert Vecchio, chairman of management at Notre Dame, who addressed the problem of phony resumes in an edition of the journal Personnel published last year. 
One of the most obvious signs is 
an ambiguous resume, said Vecchio. 
Oddly phrased sections, a lot of ab­
breviations and gaps In employment 
dates should signal a warning. 
In hopes that the ambiguities will be interpreted favorably, Vecchio said, some candidates will list a num­ber ofschools they have "attended." The term may not be an out-and-out lie, but constitutes misrepresenta­tion when the candidate believes it will be Interpreted as "graduated." 
Abbreviations are another cause for caution, Vecchio said. He recalled the story ofa job candidate

In the employer's mind, USC translated into the University of Southern California. Late in the in­terview, the candidate owned up to having a degree from the University ofSouthern Colorado. Not quite the same. 
Employment dates listed with 
years but not months should also be 
questioned. Such omissions might 
imply the candidate has more past 
experience than he or she actually 
possesses. 

Vecchio said the technique might also mask the time it took to obtain a degree, past firings or worse. "Who knows, the person might have spent that time in jail," said Vecchio. 
But even though some mis­representations, such as inflating past salaries and responsibilities, might seem fairly harmless, Vecchio said the overall problem is hardly a trivial matter. 
The statistics he cites, collected by the National Credential Verifica­tion Service ofMinneapolis, indicate that employers run roughly a one in three risk of hiring a candidate who is misrepresented in some way. 
"Candidates who lose out on a job opportunity when a less qualified candidate lies are, to a large extent, victimized. Someone loses out and the career ofa qualified candidate is Coworkers and customers are also placed at risk." More extreme cases might cause serious harm, Vecchio said, using the example of an im­poster surgeon. 
But the good news is that employers can weed out most ofthe phonies by exerting some caution and, in some cases, some common sense. Vecchio suggests that employers read resumes carefully, making note's on any items to be questioned. It's also a good idea, he added, to have employees who are experts in the field scrutinize the resume and question the candidate during interviews. 
In s-ome cases, he said, candidate's skills should be tested in an on-the­job simulation. In others, transcripts should be obtained directly from an institution, not the candidate, and references should be checked by telephone or mail. However, Vec­chio added, a uniform policy for checking credentials should be developed to avoid discrimination charges. 
When fraudulence is suspected, Vecchio also suggests trapping the candidate In his or her own lie. 
The best protective measure for employers, Vecchio said, is a signed application form. Resumes normally are not signed and are not legal doc-

Student Senator Javier Oliva said an "Off-Campus Week" will be held soon. "It's primarily an information event," he said, adding "we're not trying to promote people to leave:' Information will include sample housing contracts, talks from repre­sentatives of Campus View, lists of available -ousing, and other helpful information. The date has not yet been set, but should be before housing contracts are due (Februay 4th). 
Rules for student body elections were clarified by Maher Mouasher, Ombudsman Election Chairman. He said an informational meeting will take place on the 29th of January, with a mandatory meeting following two days later. Mouasher will be holding office hours in the OBUD of­fice from 12 to 2 pm next week to answer any questions. 
Bertino said "one ofthe things we tried to do is avoid the problems of last year," which centered around write-in candidates. He summed up the new rule changes by saying "If you plan on running for anything, you better meet the deadline." 
A motion submitted by Student Senate Parlimentarian Brian Holst was unanimously approved for con­sideration. The motion was a wor­ding change to the constitution which involves adding senators to the list of those who can be im­peached by a two-thirds vote of the senate.

Today's concern seems to be making the most 
Recently, Newsweek magazine ran a cover story about the "yuppie" in American society. This new group (young urban professionals) displays a tremendous concern and interest in personal wealth and gain. Reading the article,

One "yuppie" interviewed for the article best epitomized the feelings of her grouup politically. This past election, the young wo­man (age 25) explained, was the first time that "I had to think about my pocketbook." An ad­mirer of President Reagan "for financial reasons," but an opponent of the Republican stances on abortion and other social issues, she eventually voted for Mondale. However, there's more to her story that you ought to know. "I knew Reagan would win easily

anyway," she said. "IfI thought it was a close election, I might not have voted for Mondale. I had the best of both worlds. I could vote my conscience and still come out ahead finan­cially." 
Well, now there's someone with some firm convictions. She didn't really want Mondale to win, but, because of the President's expected landslide, she was able to ease her conscience. Makes you proud to be an American, doesn't it? 
Ibe yuppies may not be the only group focusing their lives on their wallets. An annual survey ofcollege freshmen conducted jointly by UCLA and the American Council on Educa­tion showed that materialism among fresh­men is on the rise. Nearly 68 percent said that a "very important" reason for attending col­lege was "to be able to make more money." Comparatively, only SO percent felt that way in I971. In addition, being financially well off has jumped from ninth place in I970 to 
second place among personal values ex­pressed by survey participants. 
A great number of college students are not satisfied with making more· money. They want to do even better than that. Last week, in a class I have since dropped, the professor asked how many in the class wanted "to make as much money as they possibly could." A majority of hands went up. The professor didn't seem very surprised. 
Why the preoccupation in our society with making a lot of money? Admittedly, money gives a person a certain independence. But to make as much as you possibly can? That seems to be little more than self-serving. 
Some people, when nagged by their con­sciences about the disproportionate distribu­tion ofwealth in this country, shrug it off as a necessity of capitalism and point to Christ, who said that "there will always be poor among us." The Catholic bishops have been ridiculed recently by numerous commen­tators for attacking the economic system of the United States. The critics were shocked that the bishops would challenge capitalism. Michael Novak, a leading conservative lay Catholic, said ofthe bishops' criticisms of"our punitive attitude toward the poor" that "like the Democrats in San Francisco, they always blame America first." Who, as Leon Wieseltier of the New Republic correctly puts it, should 

be blamed for American hunger and American homelessness? 
America has always been a country which prides itself on "rugged individualism." Today, a new breed ofindividuals is emerging, one which aspires to the acquisition of vast amounts of wealth. Is this healthy for our country? Not when this pursuit of money and material gain seems to be the primary purpose for living. This new breed of "yuppies" wants to have their cake and eat it too. Concerned mainly about themselves, they lack any con· cept of social conscience and responsiblility to the community. 
Some historians say that the period of the 1960's and 1970's was one which tore at the social fabric of society. However, the period also saw great social change which altered our country permanently. This new generation, characterized by an evident "me-first" mindset, may do more harm to society than the movers of the past two decades. Taking their share from the society without giving anything back, without caring for the "have­nots," is oflittle benefit to society.

Yet despite this long history of broken resolutions and otherwise futile attempts at self-betterment, I once again intend to make a resolution as my last semester at Notre Dame begins. Yes, I am aware that I have never suc­cessfully followed through with my previous resolutions, and no, I do not take a perverse sense of satisfaction in repeated failure. In­stead, I have found the perfect resolution: one I will enjoy fulfilling. 
The problem with past resolutions, as l see it, is that the resolution has always been

r Credit Union..._to serve the Notre Dame com­munity or to make inordinant interest on its apparently immobile and captive market? 
Recently, the Credit Union has adopted in­creasingly restrictive and arguably confis­catory policies with regard to deposits of checks, namely the "21-day hold". At first this policy only applied to the deposit of out-of­state checks for over S200. This was incon­venient hut probably reasonable in light ofthe amount involved. But upon returning from Christmas break with checks to deposit for less than 5200 I learned the infamous "2I-day hold" had been extended: it was changed to include any out-of-state personal check over S50 which is not covered by the member's current account balance. This is unreasona­ble. The majority of out of state personal checks deposited by Notre Dame students are

r 
from the students' parents. Does the Credit Union mistrust our parents? 

With bills due, in need of cash, and nearly too angry to speak I took my checks to a nearby Notre Dame competitor, Valley Ameri­can Bank. There I was not greeted with lines and inflexible policies but prompt, courteous service and a management willing to listen. Within a few moments I had opened a new account and had deposited my checks -with­out the "21-day hold". 
How can the Credit Union justify its hold policy when major banks in the area, with less ties to the University community, do not need to tie up these deposits at all? Has the Credit Union found some lucrative 21-day interest­bearing certificates to invest in? Surely it does not take three weeks to clear a check if cash flow is what they are worried about. 
My hassles with the Credit Union are over. I have a new bank. Perhaps if more students do the same the Notre Dame Credit Union will get the message, terminate its "2I-day hold" policy and return to the business of serving the Notre Dame community.

negative in nature. It has always required giving up ere, or something I enjoy or per­forming some task which I dislike. Finally, it occured to me to choose a resolution that both warrants my time and energy, and that I will find enjoyable to do. Hence, for the spring semester of I985 I resolve to spend less time studying and more time socializing with friends. 

This simple but worthwhile resolution, however, is not nearly as frivolous as it seems. I have good reason for such a resolution and, at the terrible risk of appearing maudlin in print shall explain. 
I and my fellow seniors will be graduating in exactly II7 days. While for some ofus gradua­tion day cannot come too soon, for all seniors life as we have known it over the past four years will come to an abrubt end on May I9. For better or for worse, there will be no more Notre Dame football weekends, tailgaters, An 
Tostal celebrations, or SYR's; no more quarter 
beer nights at Senior Bar, off-campus parties, 
or illicit dorm social "gatherings." But most of 
all, there will be no more Notre Dame frater­
nity. On May I9, the class of I98S will be scat­
tered across the nation, distributed amongst 
countless professional schools and corpora­
tions. Never again will the class of '85 be to­
gether in the same place at the same time. 
No doubt the pressure to do well in school is great and as a result it becomes easy to let the demands ofdaily class work dominate our attention. A resolution to spend time with friends recognizes and appreciates what is best at Notre Dame. It is also a resolution worth keeping. 
We have the rest of our lives to get ahead, but only II7 more days at Notre Dame.

Patrick takes over 
Brooks fired by struggling Rangers 
team vice president. Brooks, the mastermind of the 1980 U.S. Olym­pic team's gold medal performance at f..ake Placid, N.Y., compiled a 131­113-41 record with the Rangers. 
But so far this season, the team was just 15-22-8 and in fifth place in the Patrick Division. The team has been hit by a rash of injuries to star players but also has performed in­consistently all year. 
In the Pacten, St. Ed's and Sorin have both gotten off to fast starts at 3-0. St. Ed's has beaten Grace (2-1); Flanner (1-2); and Fisher (0-3). Flanner, Fisher, and Stanford ( 2-1) have all fallen at the hands of Sorin. Although both of these teams have unblemished records to this point, Grace and Stanford will make some noise before the season is com­pleted. St. Ed's and Sorin met last night and The Obseroer will have results of this game and many other important "A" League games in Thursday's paper. 
Fencers 
continuedfrompage 12 
"Our epee team has fenced out of their mind," said DeCicco. "Last year, ifwe had the team that we have this year, we'd go undefeated." 
In the foil, the Irish are also strong with 1984 national champion Higgs­Coulthard. The sophomore who went 43-6 in his first year is cur­rently 13-1 with a gold medal in the USFA Open under his belt. 
According to DeCicco, junior co­captain VanderVelden may be the best or at least one ofthe best in the country. Lifetime, he maintains a 66­28 record ( 3 2-8 in 1984). This year, he is 10-4. With his injury two weeks ago, he might be questionable for the upcoming Ohio State Tourna­ment. Nevertheless, he will be a key for the Irish in 1985. 
Rounding out the foil lineup are juniors Dave Reuter (5-7 in 1985) and Craig Funai (5-4) and sopho­more Phil Moschella ( 4-1 ). 
In the sabre, the Irish are led by senior co-captain Mike Janis. With 115 lifetime wins, he is at the top among current fencers in that cate­gory. After going 40-3 last year and meeting some tough luck in the NCAA tourney, he is back in good form with a 9-1 record. 
Junior DonJohnson adds depth at the number two spot with a 9-3 record. After going 35-6 last season, he came on at the end to be the runner-up to National Champion Mi­chael Lofton ofNew York University in the foil. 
Junior John Edwards (27-1 in 1984, 68-11 lifetime) is competing with sophomore Tony Consoli (28­2, 41-7) for the number three spot on the team. Edwards is 6-3 after losing his first three bouts while Consoli is 6-6. 
Of the three teams, DeCicco believes that his epee squad is per­haps his best currently based on their 44-10 mark. However, his 37­1 7 sabre and foil squads are also very talented and have been fencing some tough competition. Team­work will be the key for success in the 1985 season for the Irish. 
"We have some individuals who are very, very competitive, but you can't go undefeated with just a couple of individuals," said DeCicco. 
To provide the Irish with a tough test of their ability will be this weekend's tournament at Ohio State. ·At the Buckeye university, they will face the strong host team along with the surprise team of 1985 · Illinois. Also on the schedule will be a tough Clevelend State and a tough Case Western Reserve. 
The first home meet for the Irish will come on Feb. 23, when they will face Northwestern, Illinois, and Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Herb Brooks was fired yesterday as coach of the New York Rangers and was replaced by Craig Patrick, the National Hockey League team's vice president and general manager. 
Patrick, who also coached the team during the 1980-81 season, said that Robbie Ftorek would become a playing assistant coach. 
"We feel today's change is in the best interest of the team," Patrick said. "This is no reflection on Herb's abilities. We feel he is an excellent coach and will be successful in the future." 
Brooks took over as the Rangers' 19th coach on June 4, 1981, the same day Patrick was elevated to

to attempt to score the winning points. 
However, an Off-Campus player got a little too physical, at least ac-'­cording to the referee, and an inten­tional two-shot foul was called. Captain Steve Treacy converted on the two foul shots and Off Campus failed to score on its final possession. 
Both these teams stand at 2-0 until a decision is made on the game. 
Grace is the first place team in this division to date. They have recorded victories over Keenan ( 0-3 ), Howard ( 0-2 ), and Holy Cross ( 1-2 ). "Grace will play Off Campus tonight and then Morrissey in the last game of the season. These three teams seem to be the class of the division and it appears that the league title for the Bigten will go down to the final week.
