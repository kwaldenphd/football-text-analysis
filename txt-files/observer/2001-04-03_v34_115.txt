Victory buzz hits campus 
By JASON McFARLEY 
News Editor 
Sunday night the Notre Dame community watched the women's basketball team win the national championship game against Purdue in St. Louis. 
On Monday all it wanted to do was talk about it. 
"The atmosphere on campus was very exciting and positive. The mood today was a carry over from the excitement last night," sophomore Matt Smith said. 
"You could sense the enthusi­asm from everyone talking about it in class and on the quads today," Linda Melchor, also a sophomore, said. 
Smith was among a crowd of about 1,500 who welcomed the team back to campus around 
2:30 a.m. Monday at Main Circle. The students braved the early-morning cold while cheering and waving signs in celebration of the victory. 
The win set off an explosion in school pride -in female athletics in particular. 
Signs on residence halls and at the Joyce Center announced the newly acquired title and offered public testament to campus-wide support of the nation's top women's team. 
"This is an all-time high that I've seen for support of women's sports," Smith said. "I spoke to [sophomore guard] Alicia Ratay and told her the team had done a monumental thing," Smith said. 
As part of the team's banquet Sunday, the University will sponsor a pep rally open to the public at 3 p.m. at the Joyce Center. Sports information offi­cials said Monday that the event will include tournament game highlights and put on display the national champi­onship trophy. 
Brooke Norton, student body president, said the Office of the President will likely sponsor the pep rally in conjunction with the University. She said student government officials are optimistic that they can hold an event on behalf of the student body before Sunday. 
"I think a group should orga­nize something to show appre­ciation for the team's hard work and success," Melchor said. 
"Any chance we can, we'd like to show more support for the team," said Smith, presi­

The greatest gifts 
Oh, what a weekend. 
It all started for me at the "butt-crack of dawn" 
on Friday morning, my 20th birthday, when I 
helped set up the stage equipment for the G-Love 
concert. I had flashbacks to elementary school as 
I wore a name tag that read, 
"Bryan -AKA Birthday Bryan Kronk 
Boy," in hopes that my 
friends at SUB might recog­
nize it and wish me the Sports Copy 
obligatory Happy Birthday. Editor 
It worked. 
Friday night, I sat with my 
roommate and a close friend as our Fighting 
Irish women's basketball team took on 
Connecticut. Munching on Doritos and guzzling 
Mountain Dew after Mountain Dew, we watched 
in agony as the Irish fell behind by 16, only to 
make the biggest comeback in the 20-year histo­
ry of the women's Final Four. 
This might sound corny, but I knew all along 
that they would win. I really did. And they had 
to. After all, it was my birthday. 
Then, on Saturday, I held an informal gather­
ing in my room for some of my manager friends. 
As they started to arrive. they sang me a beauti­
ful rendition of Happy Birthday. 
Then there was a knock at my door. 
It opened, and about two dozen guys from my section, in the midst of competing in 23 sports in 14 minutes, took the time to provide me with their own raucous rendition of the tune. I laughed. 
Then, on Sunday night, I went over to LaFortune and joined about 200 of my closest friends in cheering on the Irish women again, this time in the national championship. I walked past the 1V trucks waiting outside. I don't think at that point I realized how momentous this occasion was. I soon did. 
While meeting with my management group at halftime, I felt a great sense of hope. I knew that these resilient Irish players could win, even though they were trailing the game by six points at halftime. We all sat with excited anticipation. 
Throughout the second half, we watched as Ruth Riley. Kelley Siemon. Niele Ivey, Alicia Ratay, and Ericka Haney kept the Irish well with­in striking distance. 
The game was ours. I could smell it. Then, with 5.8 seconds left in the game, I start­ed having flashbacks. 
2001 Big East tournament finals. Riley made one of two free throws to bring the Irish even with UConn. only to watch as Sue Bird drive the length ofthe court and sink the game-winning shot at the buzzer. 
But. luckily, this time the outcome was differ­ent. Katie Douglas' desperation shot for Purdue missed -barely -and the Irish emerged victo­rious. LaFortune exploded as the final buzzer sounded. I smiled and hugged strangers, oblivi­ous to the fact that I was now 20 years old, no longer a teenager. 
The weekend ended at about 2:30 Monday morning. About an hour earlier, my roommate and I walked to Main Circle and watched the Irish charter jet fly directly over campus. The party was about to begin. 
We stood along Notre Dame Avenue.just in front of the Morris Inn, and cheered as the team's bus pulled up in front ofus. The players took turns hoisting the championship trophy high into the South Bend night, and I took pictures. After all, you don't exactly win a national cham­pionship every day; I wanted to remember this forever 
I got the greatest gifts for my birthday. Not money, clothes or expensive toys, but friendship, joy, and most importantly, memories. Not bad for a guy with a bad memory.

UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
Trustees question president's plans 
University of South Carolina President John Palms' possible bid for a U.S. Senate seat has surprised and incensed some university trustees. Trustees continued late last week to question Palms' now very public consid­eration of the issue. Most of them also said Palms should resign the moment he decides whether he will run for Senate. "The day he is going to run is the day he ought to step down," said trustee Edward Floyd, a contributor to the U.S. Senate campaign of U.S. Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. "The timing is absolutely awful," Floyd said. "We've got to deal with budget cuts. We have a lot of unfilled posts. We need to be involved with the state to see if we can get more funding. All of that affects the university, and we are uncertain about our leader." Palms has said he would decide to run by May 1, but trustees want his decision at an April 12 meeting where the issue will be discussed. That meeting had been scheduled for other business. Chairman of the board Mack Whittle, also a Graham contributor, was also criti­cal of Palms' move. 
PRl~CETON UNIVERSITY 
Professor cited for sex harassment 
Karen Bates, a Princeton University graduate stu­dent, filed a complaint in N.J. Superior Court on March 22, accusing architecture professor Georges Teyssot of sexual harassment. Teyssot said Saturday that he "did not sexually harass Ms. Karen Bates. Her allegations ... are denied." He declined to comment further, citing that the matter is in litigation. Bates is currently a graduate student in the School of Architecture. Her complaint states that the alleged harassment began when she moved from the compar­ative literature department to the architecture school in 1997. Bates claims that she decided to switch departments at Teyssot's suggestion. Bates attended ARC 548: Selected Architects of the 18th and 19th Century taught by Teyssot in 1996. "At that time," reads the complaint, "defendant Teyssot aggressively began an attempt to persuade the plaintiff to enroll in the Ph.D. program at the School of Architecture, and he repeatedly insisted that only his program fit plain­titrs intellectual objectives and goals.

Lecture tackles hip-hop, feminism 


By EMILY W'ELSH News Writer 
Joan Morgan. a leading feminist and journalist, visit­ed Saint Mary's Monday to discuss hip-hop culture, an art form that includes break dancing and graffiti art. 
According to Morgan, hip­hop culture has developed its own cultural identity and has had an affect on relation­ships. 
Morgan, senior editor for Essence Magazine, is a part of a new wave of women and men that believe hip-hop cul­ture's infiltration of the media promotes sexism. This realization is causing many black women to work toward abolishing the sexi.sm and stereotypes encouraged by the hip-hop culture. 
"They must reject the his­torical tendency of women to stand behind the downtrod­den black male. Women must assume the responsibilities of their lives so they can become self-empowered," said Morgan. 
Morgan's lecture was an extension of her exploration of hip-hop's influence on black women in her book, "When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost: My Life as a Hip-Hop Feminist." 
"Bringing Joan Morgan to campus is encouraging the women at this campus to confront the objectifying of our bodies that occurs in music videos, magazines, and 
media in general that we are bombarded with. Look at what the women in videos wear and how they act and the image that is relaying to us," said April Davis, Assistant Director of Multicultural Affairs. 
Morgan's informal lecture started a discussion of rela­tionships on Saint Mary's campus. During the lecture, she shared excerpts from her novel and then invited ques­tions. 
First, Morgan read the sec­tion of her book deal­violent images and words found in hip-hop music and videos. She sees the lyrics of these rappers as the only key into the black man's mind and heart. 
In analyzing the words of the hip-hop artists, Morgan found that the men hide their pain and anger behind words like "hoes and bitches." She said that these young men cannot love the women in their lives until they learn to love themselves. 
The black-on-black vio­
lence cannot 
be curbed

themselves by the oppressions of sexism and racism that they live with everyday. Community was a reoccurring theme in the dis­cussion of redefining hip­hop's relationship with women and feminism. 
"Feminism and hip-hop are not at war. It is my communi­ty [of journalists] that is at war," said Morgan. 
As a journalist covering hip-hop artists, Morgan said she has an appreciation for the artists that she inter­views, but she said that does not reconcile the degrading, 
just shaking 
their booty to the beat." 
According to Morgan, her concern is one that is shared by many African Americans in the United States but is not acted upon, evident by the financial prosperity of the current hip-hop culture. 
"Joan Morgan possesses a perspective on the lives of blacks today that many peo­ple agree with but do not voice because they are forced to assimilate to the popular culture of the majority," said Apryl Underwood, a sopho­more at Saint Mary's.

Dennis explained the reason for choosing a company like Majority had nothing to do with them being non-union but rather cost and sp(1cialty. 
"Thny were in the architectur­al budget and steel erections is a niche business that is predom­inately done by non-union con­tracto.rs."

On Monday if the public was reveling in being part of the University's first-ever women's basketball title, then it was also trying to get their hands on tangible evidence of it. 
In addition to increased sales, inquiries about champi­onship merchandise poured into the Hammes Bookstore. according to Jim O'Connor, director of retail operations. 
"We started off with good business this morning," O'Connor said. "The really dramatic increase has been in the phone calls and e-mails from poople wanting to know about merchandise availabili­ty. There has been nationwide interest in sharing the success of the women's program."

of it. Half an hour after that dis­
covery, students found a clear 
plastic bag with a preserved left 
arm from the elbow to the hand. 
Fingers were sticking out of the 
plastic, Perkins said. 
Overall, Perkins said the trip was a worthwhile experience, even if it offered some fright along with the feeling of doing a job well done. 
"It was kind of creepy at first, but then it became sad. These were people just like us with lives and friends and family. For all this time they were in limbo," Perkins said. 
As a result of the students' dis­coveries, new legislation in West Virginia requiring the. use of metal tags in cremated remains has been proposed. The police are considering opening an investigation.

claims the architectural budget 
was met in the first round of 
bids. 
On December 20th, Saint 
Mary's received the bid of four 
union contractors. After receiv­
ing the bids, Christman was told 
by an unnamed source that it 
had the job because they were 
under the half of million-dollar 
budget. Christman, a contractor 
that has done work for Saint 
Mary's in the past, including 
LeMans I Jail and the renovation 
of Regina Ilall, had no reason to 
think it would not start the job 
after receiving word. 
"We were told we had the job and we were told that we were in less than a half million. We were getting ready to start after Christmas," said Howard Emmons. 
Dennis did not disclose the figures of the first or second bid but <lid say that the first bids were not in the range of the architectural bid. 
Along with clarification on the contracting procedure, students wanted some guarantee that Saint Mary's would proceed in securing the wages of workers in the future building projects Saint Mary's has planned. 
They want the college to inquire into what contractors are paying their workers. However, Dennis did not say any measure was in the future.

The Indiana Collegiate Press Association named Notre Dame senior Tim Logan the Brook Baker Collegiate Journalist of the Year at its awards banquet Saturday night. Logan served as News Editor, Assistant Managing Editor and In Focus Editor during his four years of work for The Observer.

Logan's creation of "In Focus," a special news sec­tion that examined Notre Dame/Saint Mary's rela­tions, student government and alcohol laws among others, was especially praised by the judge. 
"Ilis work with young writers on the section and the scope of community service it porform.s likely will con­tinue for years to come, thanks to Tim's hard work," Lawrence wrote. Logan is the first Notre Dame stu­dent to win the award which bas been given by !CPA for three years. The award is named for a Vicenncs University student who was murdered in 1997. 
In the overall publications competition, Dome, Scholastic and Juggler all took home first place honors in yearbook, news magazine and literary magazim categories. respectively. The Observer placed third after winning top honors for six consocutive years.

Students push for exam study day 
By COLLEEN McCARTHY Assistant News Editor 
Student body president Michelle Nagle and vice­
president Kristen Matha met with Teresa Marcy, 
~istant to vice_ pn'4"iident and dean of faculty, and 
Susan Vanek, director of first year of studies to dis­
cuss possible solutions to alle-.iate the stress Saint

. "M"i. Marcy ru1d Ms. Vanek were very supportive of our effort to try to alleviate some ofthP stress peo­ple arn foeling during that week before exams," said Matha. "However, our idea to have a study day was denied by the faculty because they don't feel that one day will make a dilference, so we are trying to find other possib!P solutions." 
Faculty have expressed concern that tl1ey need to continue to teach new material dwing the last week because it i.s an essential part of the education they arc trying to provide students, said Matha. 
"We tried to come at them from every possible direction with possible solutions and alternatives " said Nagle. "They said the faculty recognize th.at s~­dents are under a lot of stress in tl1at last week. Any "Any solution that would submit a budget to BOG seeking fund­

Oth~r solutions mentioned included having repre­sentatives from Student Academic Council sit in on department meetings to be sure that tests, papers and projects on syllabi within a department do not overlap.

And tltis would show that this open communication is beginning with stu­dent leaders on mmpus." 
. The Board was asked by Katie Camosy, a member ofthe Notre Dame Student Players, for the club to be recognized at Saint Mary's. 
Carnosy decided to seek recognition upon learning that.th~ club could host a production in O'Laughlin Auditonum free of charge if tl1e Notre Dame Student Players were a recognized club at Saint Mary's. 
"I wanted Saint Mary's people to audition for the musical I want to put on before I found out that ifwe had club recognition here it would mean using O'Laughlin for free," said Camosy. "There is so much talent for theater here at Saint Mary's." 
If recognized as a club, the group would be allowed to advertise at Saint Mary's, use the facilities free of charge and

Arizona fans riot after NCM tournament loss 
Associated Press 
TUCSON, Ariz. 
Disappointed Arizona fans over­turned at least two cars, tore down street signs and set small fires Monday night following the Wildcats' loss in the NCAA men's basketball tournament. 
About 1,500 red-clad fans had gathered at the McKale Center to watch the NCAA championship game on 1V from Minneapolis, and surrounding sportc; bars and restau­rants were jammed. 
Police reported only a handful of arresl"i before the game ended, and Assistant Police Chief Roberto VJ!la,;enor reported four post-game arrests along a major avenue near tlie campus. 
A campus police officer, Joe Mayerle, said that "people are still just venting -it's nothing like 1997," when the Wtldcatc; won tho national title. 
Several hundred people jamming one intersection near the campus were met by about 50 officers in riot gear while a helicopter circled ovor­head, but Vtllac;enor and observers there said officers weren't moving in on crowds unless there were some overwhelming reason to do so . 
Police had cordoned off the entire campus by closing streel"i to vehicu­lar traffic, a precaution to avoid hav­ing motorists trapped as some wore during the 1997 postgarne action. 
Vtlla-;enor said there were several small fires along the main avenue, where he estimated about 2 000 people milled about, and that there four other small fires at a student housing area about four miles 
away.

rights is the United States," said North Korea's delegate, Jo Sung Ju, speaking at the U.N. Human Rights Commission's annual meet ing. 
He cited the use of the death penalty against minors and wide­spread poverty in the United States. 
"Racial discrimination, child abuse, killing, trafficking, drug abuse and police brutality are tak­ing place as a usual practice," he said in a rare speech by a North Korean diplomat to the 53-nation body. "Rape and murder cormnit­ted by U.S. troops abroad are a serious problem." 
Jo lashed out following a state­ment Friday by U.S. chief delegate Shirin Tahir-Kheli, in which she described North Korea as one of the "world's most serious human rights violators." 
Tahir-Kheli accused North Korea's communist government of using a "draconian" legal code to deny all basic rights, like freedom of opinion, assembly or worship. 
The U.S. delegate also con­demned serious abuses in Cuba and said suppression in China was worsening. 
On Monday, Cuban Ambassador Carlos Amat Fores accused the United States of sponsoring U.N. resolutions critical of Cuba merely to justify Washington's own "geno­cidal policy of aggression and the economic blockade it has imposed for more than 40 years." 
"There is a massive and flagrant denial of human rights to tens of millions of people within its own borders," he declared, adding that about 15 percent of the U.S. popu­lation lived below the poverty line and were excluded from proper education and health care. 
Cuba is routinely criticized by the U.N. commission for suppress­ing democratic freedoms. Havana hopes to beat the U.S.-backed res­olution this year with support from Latin America and some vote abstentions from Europe. 
In recent years, the commission also has passed critical resolutions on Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Sudan and Afghanistan under a proce­dure whereby a special investiga­tor is appointed to monitor the sit­uation. 
In the heavily politicized debates, China has managed to use its muscle with other develop­ing nations to block critical resolu­tions for the past decade, and will likely head off a U.S.-sponsored resolution again this year. 
China's ambassador Zonghuai Qiao accused the United States of double standards in a speech Friday. 
"The U.S. concern for human rights is a sham, what it really practices is power politics," he said. "The U.S. advocacy for humanity is a fake. what it really pursues is hegemonism."

Championship shows that 
women belong 
All of us who watched your inspiring performance this sea­son are gratified you have achieved your ultimate goal: A National Championship. We are so pleased and delighted all your hard work has paid off. 
Your achievement is particu­larly poignant for me: I matricu­lated at Notre Dame in 1972 ­the first year females were admitted to the University. They were a tough breed, determined to resist the efforts of some who believed they didn't "belong" at Notre Dame. 
I'm delighted to see, after almost 30 years have passed, that Notre Dame women are still the same "tough cookies" I remember. 
Bill Wilder 

A classy victory 
Congratulations to Coach McGraw, Ruth Riley and the womens' basketball team on their national championship. Congratulations too to the Notre Dame stu­dent body for the classy way in which they celebrated the victory {unlike Purdue). Well done!

Bringing transition to co-education full circle 
Imagine a prototype raven-haired green-eyed Fighting Irish hero with a good Celtic name like Riley -and her first name is Huth! 
Undoubtedly, the Notre Dame students of today are still reveling in the victory, basking in the afterglow of a championship -as are we alumni from sea to shining sea and beyond. 
Speaking as a member of the eighth class of women to attend the University, however. the championship meant much, much more than that to me. Back in the early 1980's. men outnumbered women on campus by over a three to one margin in enrollment. and by far greater proportions in int1uence and tradition. 
I will never forget the Notre Dame Club Freshman Send-Off Picnic I attended the summer before I started at Notre Dame. An alumni from the class of 1953 looked me straight in the eye and told me point-blank that the deci­sion to become co-ed was "the worst mistake Notre Dame had ever made." Nice send-off, huh? Sadly to say. his were not the only derogatory com­
ments l was to hear. Over the next four years. there were professors, security 
' ) 
I 

officers, alumni -and 
even fellow students ­who openly echoed the refrain. Our joke back 
then was that the only adjustments Notre Dame had made to wel­come women were a few alterations to the plumbing system. 
Thus was it a grand and glorious moment for me to sit in my living 
room, watching the Irish women play to a packed house, cheered on by the 
band and cheerleaders and hordes of students and alumni waving the 

"Play Like A Champion" sign -gaining the respect and adoration once reserved exclusively for those in pads and helmets. J'll bet even my send-off buddy from the class of '53 was jumping up and down in his living room, embracing the new champions as his own. Although they may not know it, Ruth Riley, Niele Ivey and crew have 
accomplished something far greater than just a sporting championship. They have brought the University's transi­tion to co-education full circle. as women have become not only a part of Notre Dame's enrollment but of its rich and glorious tradi­tions. 
It certainly brought tears to this Domer's eyes. Thank you Lady Irish!

GUEST COLUMN 

What's good for corporations isn't nece~ly what's good for us 
AUSTIN, Tex. 

In the early 1900's, the conventional wisdom was "what's good for General Motors is good for America." After the auto-maker was convicted of orchestrat­ing the demise of public transportation 
systems in dozens of ·  
cities across the  Travis Metcalfe  
United States, some  
people began to  
doubt whether  
General Motors (GM)  Daily Texan  
really had the public  
interest in mind.  

Despite a horrific record of placing prof­it above all other considerations, multi­national corporations like GM still want the American public to believe that what's good for big business is good for every­one. The latest pill that they would have us swallow is the so-called Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). which would essentially expand NAFTA to cover the entire Western Hemisphere. Business leaders and politicians will meet in Quebec in mid-April to finalize the details of the plan. Citizen activists from around the world will be there to greet them. 
Consumer advocate and former Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader refers to the FTM as "NAFTA on steroids." Public Citizen, one of the many watchdog groups founded by Nader, recently released a report card evaluating the first five years of NAFTA to see how the reality ofthe trade agreement com­pared to the rhetoric used to rally public support for it in the early 1990's. The results were astounding. In every catego­ry, from job creation and trade balance to environmental protection and consumer safety, the first five years ofNAFTA have been a disaster. Only one aspect of the agreement lived up to its promise corpo­rate profits soared to record levels. 
Adam Smith, who introduced the theory of free market economics in his 1776 book "The Wealth of Nations," would roll over in his grave ifhe heard about NAFfA and the FTAA. Smith points out quite explicitly in his book that in a truly free market huge profits are impossible because competition ensures the lowest price for consumers. He also notes that free markets cannot exist between nations with significantly different stan­dards of living because the incentives for exploitation of the weaker economy are too strong. 
In spite of its doublespeak name, the Free Trade Area of the Americas has nothing to do with free trade. It has everything to do with protectionism for corporate profits at the expense of con­cerns like public health and fair wages. 
Under the FTM, U.S.-style protection of patents will be extended to all of Central and South America. In practice, this will prevent generic drug manufacturers in Brazil from producing medications to treat HIV and providing them at market prices. Instead, the U.S. corporations that own the patents on these drugs will have a protected monopoly and the price of the drugs will be inflated by several thousand percent above the manufacturing costs. Patents were intended to encourage inno­vation by allowing inventors to recoup their research and development costs before competition would be allowed. With the grossly inflated prices drug com­panies charge their customers it only takes a few months to recover these costs but their monopolies continue for many more years. 
Workers on both sides of the border have suffered under NAFTA, and the FTAA would only spread the misery. In the United States, the rate of illegal threats by corporations to close their plants and relocate in Mexico has more than tripled since NAFTA was adopted. They successfully use this tactic during union organizing drives to keep wages artificially low even while worker produc­tivity is increasing dramatically. At the same time in Mexico, wages fell 29 per­cent in the first few years of NAFTA while productivity increased 36 percent. Labor organizers in both countries know that resisting FTAA is not about job protec­tionism in either country. They are united against it because they know it would be bad for all workers. 
Corporations argue that globalization is inevitable and those who resist are just anti-progress. But many opponents are not against globalization itself, they are against corporate control. Organizations like Global Exchange have proposed detailed alternatives based on fair trade, human rights and democracy rather than "ftee" trade, corporate rights and plutoc­racy. 
What's good for corporations has been demonstrably bad for the rest of us. The time to educate yourself about the FTAA is now, before the corporate spin doctors unleash their propaganda in full force.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
What's in your germplasm? 
same and much lamented fate of the Dodo bird, her assumptions lacks a foundation in either biology or anthropology. It is these I wish to challenge. (I'll leave it to others to comment on the decen­cy of such an analogy in the first place and the shallow assump­tion that the main, or at least most pertinent, value of human lives in the debate of cloning is their status as "cultural arti­facts with aesthetic function.") 
First of all. her concept of 
o.

race is untenable. While the 
. 

world has long embraced the ideas of white, black and yel­low. among others, as distinct biological groups within the human species, these denomina­tions bear no significance from a genetic standpoint. Indeed, the genetic difference between any given person of European descent and that of a person ofAfrican descent would be no greater than a comparison between two Europeans or between two Africans. In other words, I bear as much genetic dissimilarity to other white people as I do to any given black person. For this reason, the American Association of Anthropology has rightfully discredited any decisive notion of "race." Any 
genetic origin) are so superficial and account for so small a percentage of our genetic makeup that choosing to create distinc­tion based on them amounts as sensi­ble a gesture as does segregating automobiles by the sound of their horn alone and nothing else. 
Ok, so it's a cultural distinc­ 
tion. Why not preserve the  
germplasm of a certain culture?  
C  Well, this is equally nonsensi­cal. Instinct is that which we do  
,  by merit of our genetic con­ 
struction. Birds flying, building  
0  ·  - nests and searching for worms are instinctual, not cultural  
habits. ''Culture," in any proper  
sense of the word, denotes that  

 which is transmitted by learning and not by biology. Watching foot­ball on Sundays, speaking in English and eating chips and drinking beer are all cultural or learned traits. ~~~J~~,c'\,/ I don't think anyone would challenge that we are disposed by our nature. by biolo­
gy, to participate in any of these. This should be obvious. It follows then that preserving the germplasm of, for example, a Chilean, no more promises to preserve a deep love for Pablo Neruda, avocados, Catholicism and la Roja (their soccer team) than my genes would be assured to produce an English speaking New York Mets fan. Better said, the traits of Chilean, American or any other culture are not encompassed in genetic make-up. Were they to be, it would by definition not be culture at all but instinctual. Suggesting, therefore, the desire to preserve the "cultural artifacts" and "aesthetic function" of Kalahari Bushmen by creating a stockpile of "germplasm" makes absolutely no sense. Were such an offspring to be made from such material, we could only expect a fairly random, dark-skinned, human; but never that she or he would hunt and gather, speak "Kung" lan­guage or have any disposition to the culture once endowed by his or her biological ancestors. 
It is my hope, like the author's, that we not lose to extinction such cultures. While Susan adopts a utilitarian argument whereby the value of any given people is reduced to their status as "rare and beautiful" or "aes­thetic(ly)" pleasing, ours should stem from elsewhere: the call to respect the dignity of all human life. Be it Bushmen or deathrow inmates, as Catholics we recog­nize that human life is an objective, and not just subjec­tive, good. It is the vacancy of any consideration of this nature that makes Sprecher's article mildly offensive. Were human cloning to be, as she suggest, "beneficial," much more than its aesthetic utility would need to be considered. The emotive arguments and compassion she elicits, however forceful they may be, fail in themselves to be "open-minded" to such consideration; the very charge which, to us, she issues. 
Anthony Pagliarini junior Dillon Hall April 2, 2001 
In response to yesterday's article entitled "Benefits of Cloning People," I would like to point out several key fac­tual errors that were posited by Susan Sprecher. 
Although she presents a thoroughly emotive argument about the need to preserve the Bushmen from the such divisions we choose to make are more assuredly important cultural distinctions, but not biological ones. While we are correcting in noticing that, yes, in general, Tutsis are taller than Peruvians, and that Norwegians 
are lighter than Nigerians, these distinctions (of

Over the past live years. Ben Harper has established himself as one of the most charismatic and soulful musi­cians to make an appearance on pop radio. 
Perhaps he's the only one, yes? At any rate, he has developed a large and loyal following for which he shows appreciation by Louring 300 days a year with shows that are often described as "cool" and "nice," not to mention "orgasmic." 
The newest project for Harper and his band, The Innocent Criminals, is a compilation of these large shows. llarper listened to hundreds oflive recordings before set­tling on this ultimate show, a twodisc affair that sets out to replicate one of his shows and falls short only on olfac­tory ambiance -which can always be provided by listen­ers themselves. 
The two discs rnally serve as two separate sets. Just as he does in his shows, l larper plays with the Criminals in the first set, moving from the raucous and raw rock 'n' roll of "Glory and Consequence" to the smooth seduction of his cover of Marvin Gaye's "Sexual Healing." The radio-friendly bubble-gum pop favorite "Steal My Kisses" is countered by the more memorable and explicitly counter-cul­tural "Bum One Down." 


While the loud and sometimes violent chords of electric Ben and his buddies burn with fun and pack a solid political punch at times, it is in the second set. where Harper appears solo on his acoustic slide guitar, that the real soulfulness ofhis artistry is allowed to shine through. 
Harper is adamant about retaining ties to his folk roots, and he does it well here. He has selected several tracks from Welcome to the Cruel World, his debut album that few noticed until his later success with Fight for Your Mind. It was with these early albums that he neared the divine through music as an acoustic won­derkid. 
Indeed, he does it again here. 
bringing the rowdy crowds of the 
first disc to near silence as he expounds on the "Power of the Gospel," ih which the real convincing is done not with his lyrics but with the simple haunting melody of his gui­tar. 
Harper does well to mix his mournful and solemn love songs and ballads, like "Roses from My Friends" and "Another Lonely Day" with his angry or pained political anthems, "Excuse Me Mr." and "Like a King," the lat­ter of which he blends into an interpretation of Maya Angelou's poem "I Will Rise." 
Most artists would not be able to pull this off without sounding like shallow pompous windbags trying to be poetic through mimic-

ry. As the final track on a set that has revealed Harper's lyrical and verbal abilities in the most intimate of American forms, Angelou's words lit well. 
Harper's fans now abound on college campuses across the country, and there is no scarcity of his albums in their portfolios. But this is his first live release, and there is material here that cannot be found legally recorded elsewhere -covers of Gaye and Led Zeppelin for instance -and renditions of his own work that give these songs a new personality and a new medium of interpretation. 
This is the kind of concert that can be listened to over and over without hearing every piece of it, a rare show that can make you dance, cry or drift off into bleary-eyed oblivion in the loving arms ofyour "special lady."

Perhaps the title of Tortoise's latest album. Standards, opti­mistically suggests the future of popular music to come. Or maybe it's somewhat of a band mission statement as Tortoise continues to push the envelope of musical innovation to just within reach of anyone open to something exciting and different. 
Whatever the title is though, it certainly isn't a statement about how the album fits into the state of today's MTV-driven popular culture of teeny-bopping Carson Daly legionnaires. Or is it? 
Indeed, much to the delight of pretentious anti-radio post-rock mongers who scoff at the thought of an album selling more than 900 copies, Standards challenges, redefines, decon-

structs, slices and dices conven­tion, cataloguing the results into just 45 compact minutes of musical protein shake. But chin up, Britney and Backstreet lovers. because this group of anywhere from four to seven band members led by produc­er/drummer/vibes player John McEntire is also delightfully accessible. 
Well, if by accessible, one means a hearty lyricless melange of jazz. electronic, Kraut-rock, dub, classical mini­malism, ambient, prog-rock, jam band and kitchen sink-rock. Then yes, Tortoise is quite accessible. 
It is no question that the band is riddled with musical influ­ences ranging from A Tribe Called Quest to its own Chicago free jazz progeny. Isotope 217. Hut successfully bringing them all together on an at least mildly cohesive record hasn't always seemed as effortless as Standards suggests. Simply put, the album is brilliant. 
Standards opens with a bang. The hailstorm of percussion and bass in "Seneca" cleanses tho musical palate like Drano-fla vored sorbet, properly leaving the mind an uncluttered and receptive tabula rasa for absorb­ing the more easily digestible majority of the album. The duel­ing bass lines that kick in mid­way through "Eros" just can't get any smoother, transforming any casual listener into nothing but head-bobs and smiles. With its expressively staccato and impressive and beautifully con­structed track. Incredibly mature and mildly erotic, "Monica" blossoms with catchy complex rhythms. melodic hooks, some delightful imperfec­tions beneath heavily-vocoded. :.mintelligible voices and a great bass line at the end. 

The album climaxes with the quick-paced and adventurous "Blackjack," and finally chills out in a pleasant denouement with the final two tracks. "Eden l" and "Speakeasy." which con­tain nothing more profound than some courtesy pillow talk. 
Too subtle to be rock, too pre­meditated to be jazz and with too many members in the band to be considered electronic, Tortoise successfully dodges classification and judgment. leaving the music to simply speak for itself. As their best album, Standards is moving, ele­gant, down-to-earth and quite possibly clairvoyant.

Air leak prompts evacuation of Writing Center 
By FRED SMITH 
News Writer 
A catastrophic air leak forced the evacuation of the University Writing Center yesterday, amid fears that the inflatable, drag­on-shaped facility would col­lapse. 
Onlookers watched in horror as students remained trapped in the netting of the center, unable to operate the Velcro­sealed emergency exit. 
Senior Katie MacLaverty was inside the center at the time of the leak. 
"I was in there, bouncing around and working on a semi­nar paper, when I heard this weird hissing sound. I looked at my friend Katie [Reilly], and I was like, 'Do you smell air?'" she said. "It was really scary." 
B o t h "When we find out that stu­dents might be in jeopardy, such in last week's gas leak behind O'Shaughnessy Hall, we like to wait a while before evacuating them." 
Once students were evacuat­ed, surrounding buildings were evacuated as well. 
Architects of the facility issued a statement later that day stating that the risk of an air leak is implicitly understood when constructing any building out of vinyl. 
"We sat down last August with the University planning committee and reviewed the risks of building an inflatable Writing Center," said Lloyd Fisk, founder of Fisk and Grady Design Associates in Elkhart. "They said that the inflatable dragon head was too cute to resist, though."

"It really is adorable," Fisk added. "Especially when there's lots of people bouncing around inside. He [the dragon] looks all angry." 
Authorities are unsure what may have caused the leak, but several theories have yet to be ruled out.

Absurder Staff Report 
Senior accounting major Mike Kowalski stunned the campus community by singing along to ABBA's 1978 hit "Dancing Queen," at the Welsh Family Hall Formal Saturday. 
"So, everything was going fine, right, and they just played Lady in Red, which was so cute because I was wearing my roommate's red dress with the strappy top, and then Dancing Queen comes on, and all of the sudden Mike starts singing along with the words," said former girlfriend Theresa May.

Moving into the garage 
Many people leave Notre Dame for graduate schools, high-paying jobs or the excitement of the big city. That's fine for them. But if you want to find me, knock on the aluminum siding 
of my parents' garage.  
Many of my friends have laughed, but I know there's  Olivia B'Server  
nothing wrong with living in  
my parents' garage. "You  
mean, OVER the garage,  News Writer  
right?" they would ask me.  
No ­ you'd be surprised  
how nice that place is once  

you move all the tools to one corner and mop 
up the oil. I can just imagine how cute my 
Bengal Bouts poster will look next to my dad's 
Craftsman power saw! 
And all those hooks on my new plywood walls will be just great for belt hooks and my Notre Dame degree. 
Some people think that Arts and Letters majors have a really tough time finding jobs, but that's simply not true. Offers for my future have been pouring in and it's all I could do to fight the headhunters o!T. 
Just the other day a letter came telling me I could be a winner -instantly! Just goes to show you don't need a finance degree to draw in the big bucks. 
But after months of rejecting firm after firm and company after company, the perfect opportunity shined before me at my local Tan Tan Bo Ban. 
My new boss Barbi said that most new employees just get entry level positions clean­ing otT sweat from the beds and selling bronz­ing gel. But since I took that one business class sophomore year and I went to Cancun for spring break all four years, she promoted me right to tanning bed technician manager. 
And I'll probably be so warm from my man­agerial position supervising the dark flesh industry that I won't notice how cold my new digs will get at night. In fact, I embrace the fresh, outdoorsy air and motor oil perfume per­meating my new home. 
And I figure those big blue dice from my grandfather's old Cadillac could finally get some use again as decorations. I mean, they're a baby blue and match perfectly with my bed sheets and a picture frame that has a photo of my friends and I drinking on a beach in Mexico. Who knew that not only was 1soaking in the rays (and alcohol) but also investing in my future? 
As graduation nears, many students have been freaking out about where their Notre Dame education will take them. But frankly, I'm not worried. Because I know I have the sweetest little 20' by 20' space waiting for me at home. 
The only problem I see arising is if my mom or dad might need to park their cars and I'm sleeping, or getting dressed or they forget that my bed is on the left side of the garage and I have oily tire marks when I get home from the Tan Tan. But it's all worth it for my very own retractable sun wall, plush with terrace. Some may call it a driveway; I call it a patio. 
Sometimes l worry that I'll never make it after graduation; I freak out thinking of moving back home. But I mean, I love cars and I have a great tan. And while some close-minded people may call it a carport, I call it home.

Students perform "Ankle Monologues" March 30, 1858 
Saint Mary's College was scandalized by the perfor­mance of Agatha Buchanan's controversial dramatic work, "The Ankle Monologues." College president Sister Gertrude Thomas More expressed concern about the subject matter. "We feel this kind of licentious behavior is not in accordance with the mission of the College," she said. "Our Student Handbook explicitly prohibits mentioning things of that nature. Ankles, elbows, necks -these are all things that should never be discussed in a public setting." 
Architects hail Stepan Center April 3, 1965 
Architects from around the world arrived on campus yesterday to marvel at the latest addition to the Notre Dame skyline. Stepan Center, a large dome .enclosing a concrete floor, has been described as a crowning archi­tectural achievement, though no one is quite sure what its purpose is. "I guess it's for concerts. but l'm not sure what performer would want to even go inside," said one member of Student Activities. Like most contemporary architecture, the Stepan Center was scheduled to be obsolete approximately 10 minutes later.

Tissue industry prepares for room picks 
With room picks just weeks away, America's tissue industry has been working overtime to meet anticipated demand. The annual event touches off an emotional powder keg of cry­ing, sulking and backstabbing, lasting through the last weeks of the semes­ter, and well into the fall. 
Experts predict the center of this year's activity will focus around an emotionally unstable group of eight best friends in Pangborn Hall, where tensions have already begun to rise dramatically. 
"We wanted to get this quad, but then Katie [Mickelson] said that she couldn't live with Emily {Noble]. and so she totally ditched us to live with Katie [Sobieck]. and so now Colleen [O'Hanrahan] is saying that she wants to live with Emily. but only in a dou­

Mickelson claims she knew nothing of the pact. 
"I mean, we had talked about maybe living together, but that was during the Texas A&M game back in September, when we had only known each other for like 16 days, or some­thing. I didn't think anyone would take that seriously," she explained. 
Sobieck echoed similar sentiments. 
"Like two weeks ago, Katie [Mickelson] and I were talking. and since no one had talked about living together. we just decided to live together," she said. "It's going to be so cute. We're going to do our mes­sage so it says, 'Hi. you've reached Katie and Katie,' and we're going to pass the phone to each other, so we can each say our names." 
The most recent emotional tremor occurred on January 24. when Noble asked Dining Hall Boy to the crew team SYR, even when she knew that O'Hanrahan was going to ask him to the Pangborn Formal the following night. O'Hanrahan retaliated by steal­ing Noble's television set and donat­ing it to the Congo Relief Mission.

Student glimpses bookstore 
University officials are baffled by reports that an anymous Siegfried Hall R.A. somehow came within sight of the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore. "I was out walking in a snowstorm because I had to mail something at the post office, and all of the sudden, I got turned around, and then I saw this weird church­looking building off in the distance. I couldn't tell what it was because of the snow, but l knew it wasn't anything I'd seen before," he said. "When they tore down the old bookstore, they told the kids on Mod Quad that we weren't going to have a bookstore on campus, so I've just been buying my books online since then." The new bookstore, whose doors ironical­ly face away from the campus it was designed to serve, opened in the Spring of 1999. Rumors of a new building circulated around Mod Quad, but most were quickly dispelled by a carefully maintained media gag order on photographs or referecenes to the bookstore or the Eck Center. "Apparently there's another dining hall on campus, too."

That tan isn't fooling anyone 
Theresa Perry returned from a trip to Meijer looking much tanner than usual Friday, and no one on campus is fooled. "That girl was white as a sheet last week, and today she's orange. I don't know what she was thinking," said English professor Susan Lavonde. "l don't know who she thinks she's fooling." Sources close to Perry said that the mysterious tan was definitely not an epidermal flashback to Spring Break. "She spent her Spring Break underground on a service project in a copper mine in Manitoba, or somewhere, so she defin­tely didn't get any sun there," said one friend. Witnesses reported seeing Perry's car parked outside a Mishawaka establishment called "Tan Tan Bo Ban." According to city authorities.Tan Tan Bo Ban operates a series of so-called "tanning beds," where customers voluntarily expose themselves to an ultraviolet light spectrum that turns skin an unnatural orange color. "Maybe she thinks it looks like a tan," one friends said. "That would be a shame, though, because that girl looks like a pumpkin."

London with all sorts of weird-ass music. Techno, or whatever. I wouldn't be surprised if he learned the Dancing Queen song there," said roommate Aaron Wagner. 
In the wake of the inci­dent, members of the Ethics committee of the Campus Life Council called an emergency meeting to draft a possible amend­ment to the Student Union constitution, banning cam­pus events from playing Dancing Queen. 
"This song promotes las­civious behavior that is clearly not in line with the teachings of the Catholic Church," said University president Father Edmund Valloy. "I don't care if she can dance. 1 don't care if she can jive, nor do I care if she's having the time of her life. This so-called queen of dancing is only 17, and I really don't think we, as Christians, can con­done that sort of activity." 
"And I think it's really odd that a guy knows all the words to that song," he added. "Theresa can total­ly do better." 
Attorneys for former ABBA member Bjorn Andersson released a statement issued from his home in Malmo, Sweden. 
"I think it good people of young generation learn words to songs we sing," Andersson said. "Dancing Quee~. is fun song for dance.

VIEWPOINT 
Sunday, April 1, 200 I ~ page 3 
Taliban: Elderd has the right idea 

As leader of the Taliban, the extremist group dedicated to oppressing and taking away the rights of all women in Afghanistan, I want to applaud the decision of Saint Mary's College president Shari-Lou Elderd for her to ban the perfor­mance of "The Vagina Monologues" at the College. 
It is especially gratifying to us to see that our belief that women should not be heard or have any rights is spreading worldwide. Although we didn't anticipate that an all women's college would be the first to buy into this idea, we'll take what we can get. In fact. we believe that Dr. Elderd is taking a leadership role that hopefully will influence other leaders to follow the Taliban. 
After Dr. Elderd's decision, I personally contacted her to praise her for her decision and Jet her know that the Taliban is on her side. She graciously accepted our support since most of the student body and faculty have turned against her, except a few misogynist priests and devout Catholics. We exchanged stories about how the oppression of women is not always a popu­lar concept but in the end, it's for the best. 
After speaking with Dr. Elderd, she realized that she has a friend in the Taliban. Therefore, she said that we will work swiftly to create a College-Taliban alliance. This will involve creat­ing a Taliban Club on campus. Dr. Elderd assured us that although the club has to be approved by Board of Governance, this would not be a problem since the student gov­ernment is terrified of making a decision that would go against the administration. 
Dr. Elderd also assured us that the Taliban Club, committed to the oppression and silencing of women would be given prime office space on campus from which to run it's operation. She said the Taliban office will be located in the newly renovated Women's Center. Dr. Elderd said she was nervous that the Women's Center would become a hotbed of feminists anyway so this would effectively end any further organizing on campus. 
To further strengthen the ties between Saint Mary's and the Taliban, the Taliban will be pro­viding funding to create an endowed chair for a visiting pro­fessor. Through this Taliban Chair in Oppressing Women, the College will be able to bring some of the most notable oppres­sors of women and proponents of oppression of women to cam­pus including a return of former Saint Mary's professor and "Vagina Monologues" critic, J. Mark Johnson. 
Perhaps the most exciting development of the Saint Mary's­Taliban alliance will be a new study abroad program. While the Rome and Ireland programs have been popular with students in the past and have given them a sense of independence and an opportunity to grow. these pro­grams will be eliminated. In place of these programs, the College and Taliban have creat­ed a first of it's kind program: the Study Abroad in Afghanistan program. The program will give students a chance to experience the oppression of the Taliban firsthand and return to Saint Mary's realizing their campus is not nearly as oppressive as our regime. 
Because the Taliban has for­bidden women and girls to attend school or universities in Afghanistan, we are encouraging Dr. Elderd to gradually phase out female students and turn the College into an all male institu­tion. 
Finally. in an unprecedented decision. the Taliban has decided to offer Dr. Elderd a position in its government. Although we normally do not encourage plac­ing women in positions of authority or power. we believe that Dr. Elderd has demonstrat­ed through her suppression of "The Vagina Monologues" that she knows that women should not really have a voice and are better off remaining in a submis­sive position. We hope that she will accept our offer. We see Dr. Elderd as a pioneer in carrying out many of the goals of the Taliban in America.

I studied abroad, so worship me 
Last year, I had the opportunity to study abroad on Notre Dame's London Program. and now that I am hack, I am pretty disgusted with America. 
Let me begin by boring you with a long story filled with local slang, to prove I was actually there. I left my flat with a group of 50 of my friends, and we went to this pub, and then we started talking to the bartender, and he was like, America sucks. And I totally agree. America has like no culture at all. In London, they have ballet, opera, plays and concerts. I didn't actually go to any. because we went to the same American-themed sports bar every night, but it was there, and we could have gone if we wanted. 
I definitely want Lo live in Europe one day. It's so pretty. On one of my breaks, me and 43 of my friends went to every country in Europe. It was so great, especially Prague. Beer was like 20 cents there, and we stayed in this one hostel that was only like two dollars a night. It was so cool. Then we went to Berlin. Apparently there's some kind of wall there, because we went to this awesome club called The Wall, and it didn't even open until like two in the morning. Berlin was awesome. They had this huge museum that my friend Stacey threw up in front of. It was so pretty from the outside, but the admission was way expensive, and we were saving our pesos for the clubs. 
And then, we took the train to Amsterdam. which was so great. When dumb Americans think of Amsterdam. all they think of is the Red Light District and marijuana. hut there's so much more than that. In fact, when I was smoking out in this one sketchy bar, this dude handed me a pamphlet for the Anne Frank museum. which is Amsterdam, too, I guess. I don't remember much. 
In short, though, I just want to say that I studied in Europe, so now I'm the classiest. most cosmopolitan person on earth. Also, Americans are ignorant and uncultured and they make me sick.

Yeah, it was cool and all. and I was getting pretty sober so I fig­ured I should go pick up my date. I don't know what her name is, because this dude down the hall from me went with some hot chick from his calc class, and she had a whole bunch of friends, so we all had to go with her friends so that he could go with the hot chick. 
Yeah, so we get there, and I don't know where we were, and I met my date, and she was cool, I guess. I think she was short, or something. I don't remember. She wasn't nearly as hot as that chick from that dude's calc class.

Shortly after the Notre Dame women's bas­ketball team won the national championship. a press conference was held to announce a new addition to the women's team. 
"We are pleased to announce that LaTroya Murphy will be a part of our team for the 2001­2002 season," said Muffin McDraw, women's basketball team head coach. 
recruit. 

"LaTroya has an awful lot of body hair and sometimes, her voice gets really deep unex­pectedly," said one player. "But if she can play, her masculine-like characteristics shouldn't really matter to any of us. She can still be just one of the girls." 
Members of the Irish cheerleading squad have also expressed concern with the team's newest player. 
"She's always lingering around when I'm at 
the top of the pyramid," said

of our graduating seniors." 
LaTroya is listed as a trans­fer student and wouldn't divulge where she transferred from. 
"That's not really important," she said. "So let's never discuss that again, okay?" The 6-foot-11, 245 lb recruit said she is excit­ed to be a part of the team. 
Little is known about her, though many wit­nesses report seeing her hanging around Morrissey Hall at odd hours. 
"I guess she has a boyfriend that lives here, or something.ff said one Morrissey R.A. "She's always here. Watching T.V., playing Sega, working out or chilling with the guys. She's real nice. and she's got one hell of a deep voice. We want her to sing bass with us at Acoustic Cafe next week. n 
Some of the women's basketball players expressed skepticism about the mysterious LaTroya said she is already 

adapting to her new environ­ment and feels very comfortable at Notre Dame. 
"I felt like I was coming home when I arrived at Notre Dame," said LaTroya. "It was kind of strange because [ felt like I had been here for oh. three years. When I walked into the Joyce Center and practiced on the basketball court, I felt like I had played there many times before. I think I've finally found the team with the right fit for me." 
Already a success in the game with her impressive stats, LaTroya said she considered going pro but wanted one more chance to win a collegiate national championship. 
"I really thought about going to the NBA, uh I mean, WNBA, but I just couldn't end my colle­giate career knowing I hadn't yet accomplished that," said LaTroya."

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP 

Duke wins, Coach 'K' joins elite group with three titles 
Associated r,~ss 
MINNEAPOLIS 
Mike Krzyzcwski didn't want 
to let go of Shane Battier. 
lie hugged him for what 
seemed to be an eternity, a 
farewell embrace for his nation­
al player of the year and team 
leader. 
"It's complete," Duke's all­
everything senior forward said. 
"All that's left for me is to ride 
off into the sunset on a white 
horse." 
With a national title in hand. 
The top-ranked Blue Devils won their third championship -and second in the Metrodome -with an 82-72 victory over Arizona on Monday nighl.. 
With Battier and Duke's other 
All-American. Jason Williams, 
coming up big down the stretch, 
and sophomores Mike Dunleavy 
and Carlos Boozer playing key 
roles, Krzyzewski moved into 
impressive coaching company. 
"The thing with Duke, you pick your poison," Arizona coach Lute Olson said. "Sometimes it's going to be one guy, another time it's going to be someone else. The one con­s istent thing is that Shane Battier is going to have a great game because he just makes things happen. I don't think there's been any question in anyone's mind about him being player of the year." 
Battier played all 40 minutes, scoring 18 points, with 11 rebounds and six assists. He fin­ished his career with 131 victo­ries, tying Kentucky's Wayne Turner, who played from 1996­99, for the NCAA record. 

"Shane wasn't hitting his jump shot, but he comes up with two amazing offensive rebounds," Krzyzewski said. 
He was referring to two plays in the final 4 1/2 minutes when Battier scored after Arizona had closed within three points. 
Krzyzewski said Battier, who went from a role player as a freshman to a two-time national defensive player of the year and All-American, made himself a great player. 
"He's probably the most rec­ognized kid playing college bas­ketball," Krzyzewski said. "He deserves that." 
Still trailing UCLA's John Wooden's 10 national champi­onships, Krzyzewski moved one behind Kentucky's Adolph Hupp and tied his college coach, Bob Knight. who won three at Indiana. 
"Coach is such a tremendous influence in my life," Battier said. "To give him his third championship, and separate him from the pack that has won two is the best way that I could go out. It's my going-away pre­sent to him. 
"I am the luckier person to 
have the relationship with him 
for the last four years. And I 
know that he'll be one of my 
most valuable friends for the 
rest of my life." 
To get to this game, Duke {35­
4) had Lo overcome a 22-poinL deficit in Saturday's semifinal win over Maryland. The last time the Blue Devils won it all. it was by 20 points over Michigan. 
The loss ended Arizona's ago­nizing season and kept the Wildcats (28-8) from matching their own record of beating three No. 1 seeds in the NCAA tournament, which they did when they won it all in 1997. 
Loren Woods had 22 points and 11 rebounds to lead Arizona, the team that rebound­ed from a poor start and over­came lhe death of Olson's wife, Bobbi. on Jan. 1 to reach the championship game. 
"All the emotions they had to go through and they withstood them and did a great job to get to the final game," Olson said. "It's tough. Someone's got to lose it. Duke is deserving. We gave them a good run and couldn't get it done." 
Duke's other titles came in consecutive years, and the sec­ond in 1992 was won in this building after the same trip through the tournament ­Greensboro, N.C., Philadelphia and Minneapolis for the Final Four. 
Dunleavy, playing in front of his father, Portland Trail Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy, led Duke with 21 points, 18 in the second half. 
Dunleavy hit a career-high five 3-pointers, while Boozer, who just returned last weekend after missing six games with a broken foot, had 12 points and 12 rebounds. 
Williams, saddled with foul trouble, had 16 points on 5-for­15 shooting. 
"So many times people are always saying you stop Shane and I, you can beat Duke," Williams said. "We're so much bigger than that." 
Duke is the first No. 1-ranked team to win the national cham­pionship since UCLA in 1995. 
Dunleavy had three 3-pointers in an 11-2 run that put the Blue Devils up 50-39 four minutes into the second half. 
Arizona came right back with a 9-0 run that was capped by a hook shot by Woods with 14:11 left that made it 50-48. 


It took Duke just four minutes to get the lead back to 10, 61­51, on Dunleavy's last 3 of the game with 10:08 l.o play. 
Again, the Wildcats came back. 
Four times Arizona got within three points. Three times it was Battier, the outstanding player of the Final Four, who respond­ed for Duke. 
His dunk on a pass from 

Williams made it 77-72 with 
2:31 left, and Williams hit a 3 with 1:45 left that gave the Blue Devils an eight-point lead. 
"Most games we're able to get that run," Woods said. "We just couldn't today. They just beat us at our own game." 
Duke, which set NCAA records this season for 3-point­ers made and attempted, fin­ished 9-for-27 from beyond the arc. Arizona really struggled from long range, finishing 4-for­22 with Jason Gardner missing all eight attempts. 
Duke shot 47 percent from the field (30-for-64). well above the 38 percent Arizona's other opponents, including No. 1 seeds Illinois and Michigan State, shot during the tourna ment. 
Arizona shot 39 percent (28­for-71), nowhere near the 50 percent mark the Wildcats were at for the first five games of the tournament. 
"Somehow," Dunleavy said. "we were able to outlast them."

Rockne 
continued from page 20 

sports were just beginning to become a part of mainstream American culture, Rockne and Notre Dame defined sports. He coached the Four Horsemen and gave the famous "Win one for the Gipper" speech. He started the Bengal Bouts boxing program as a way to keep his players in shape. 
He was a renowned track and field coach. Rockne didn't just embody the spirit of Notre Dame -he created it. 
Heathman was a mere teenager when he and his uncle arrived at the crash site. What he saw would change his life forever. 
"I went to Notre Dame last year and arranged a meeting with Father Theodore Hesburgh," he said. "In our conversation I said, 'Father, it's amazing how this has enriched my life.'" 
Heathman dedicated the rest of his life to preserving a monu­ment on the spot where the plane crashed. lie unselfishly led historians, tourists, fans, and countless others from his modest house through the Kansas woods to the simple, 10-foot obelisk. 
"It's given him a reason to be," said Heathman's friend David Kil. Notre Dame's assis­tant registrar. "People start 
stopping by and he takes them 
up there. If they offer him 
money, he won't take it. If they 
insist. he'll use it to put a new 
wreath out. He is an ambas­
sador who is an unsung hero." 
Heathman is a folk legend to 
Notre Dame fans, and the mon­
ument he protects has been a 
gathering place for die-hard 
football fans. 
Sometimes, visitors will travel to Heathman's farm merely to talk to the spirit of Rockne. They'll talk about what Rockne means to them, what he means to Notre Dame, and the incredi­ble tradition he started. 
Last year, on the 69th anniversary of Rockne's death, a group of five Notre Dame seniors invited Bob Davie to join them in Kansas. They had been making the trip to Kansas since they had been freshman. 
"They have a ceremony where each one of them would talk to Knute and they would say what he meant to them and what he meant to Notre Dame, and how the tradition contin­ues," Davie said. 'Then it was my turn." 
So what did the current Notre Dame football coach and the heir to Rockne's legacy have to say? 
"I said, 'Why'd you have to make these expectations so high?" Davie said. 
And that's exactly what Rockne did for Notre Dame. He raised the bar and he changed what is expected of Notre Dame football seasons. As Davie him­self said, 5-7 seasons aren't acceptable by Notre Dame standards: "Knute, I know you can hear me, and I apologize about that," he said last year. 




Davie has a special memento of the Rockne crash site. 

ing one pilot, six passengers, and a Notre Dame football coach. Seventy years ago, a leg­end was found lying on the ground, a rosary in his pocket. Seventy years ago, one man died. 
His spirit survived. 

"[Heathman] came by and brought me glass -actual glass -from the windshield of Rockne's crash," he said. "That shows you what this place is, tradition wise."

MEN'S TENNIS 
No. 19 Miaini edges No. 10 Irish 
By KATIE HUGHES Sports Writer 
A few hours before the women's basketball team was fighting its way to victory from a tie, the men's tennis team had three tied matches going on at once. 
Leaving South Bend's barely spring-like weather to face No. 19 Miami in temperatures approaching 90 degrees, the No. 10 Irish lost an excruciatingly close match Sunday 4-3. 
"Obviously, we're disappointed with the loss to Miami, but I thought the effort level was very high," said Irish head coach Bobby Bayliss. "I don't think we could have played any harder." 
"To come that close and come up short is tough." said Irish freshman Matt Scott. "They had some grinders and hitters, while we rely more on power and strength." 
The Irish did, as usual, show their depth and strength in the middle of their singles lineup. Freshman Luis Haddock­Morales had a decisive victory at No. 3 singles, beating Miami's Lindquist 6-4, 7-5. Aaron Talarico, a perpetual pillar for Notre Dame, beat Miami's Hoffman 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-5) to win his seventh straight singles match. Freshman Matthew Scott added some momentum to his spectacular season, beating Miami's Culub 5-7, 6-1, 6-3 at No. 6 singles. 
"Aaron Talarico showed an unbelievable amount of courage," said Bayliss. "He really scratched and clawed and found a way to win. Matt Scott showed a lot of poise in his match, com-

ing back to win comfortably in the third set." 
Scott is now 11-1 this season. 
Miami's Michael Lang beat 9lst-ranked junior Casey Smith 6-2, 4-6, 8-6 (7-0) at No. 1 sin­gles, and Tomas Smid beat Notre Dame junior Javier Taborga 3-6, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-4) at No. 2 sin­gles. Rrian Farrell lost to Miami's Lieberman 6-2, 6-2 at No. 5 singles. 
As the Irish approach the end of the season, with the Big East Championships and a string of top-25 ranked teams on the horizon, it has become impossi­ble to ignore the need to win the ever-elusive doubles point. 
"The area of our team that needs attention is our doubles," Bayliss said. "We're making some fundamental breakdowns. Whether we need to turn our attention to different combina­tions or a new person or two, or to better focus on execution, remains to be seen." 
The 20th-ranked Irish doubles team of juniors Taborga and Talarico beat the Hurricanes' 31th-ranked team of Smid and Hoffman 9-8 (7-4), but Miami's Andrew Golub and Johan Lindquist beat senior Matt Daly and sophomore Brian Farrell 8-5 at No. 3, 8-5. Miami's No. 2 dou­bles team of Michael Lang and Jose Lieberman beat Notre Dame's Smith and Haddock­Morales 8-6. 
"Smith and Taborga played exceptionally well to get to the point where they could serve for the match, then they were just a little too anxious," Bayliss said. "Maybe they wanted to win almost too much. They'll correct that. They'll be back, and we'll be back." 
The Irish will face Miami again in the Big East Championships in Miami in three weeks.

TRACK AND FIELD 
Shay qualifies for Nationals in 10,000 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Associate Spores Editor 
It's safe to say Ryan Shay likes the 10,000-meter run. 
It had been seven months since the senior All-American last competed in his favorite event, but the long layoff didn't seem to slow down the top Irish distance runner. 
Shay finished in 28 minutes, 40 seconds, the second-fastest time in Notre Dame history. en route to a fourth-place finish in the 10,000 at the Stanford Invitational. The time automati­cally qualifies Shay for the NCAA Outdoor Championships. 
The senior was about 14 sec­onds off the school record he ran last year at the Mt. SAC Relays. Shay also ran a 28;51 at the Olympic Trials last August, the fifth fastest time in the 10,000 meters. In all, Shay holds four of the top five 10,000-meter times. 
It was a rather strange week­end for the men's and women's teams as they split up to com­pete in three different meets to kick off the outdoor season. Four distance runners joined Shay at Stanford, while most top jumpers and sprinters com­peted in the Arizona State Invitational. The rest of the team competed in the Purdue Invitational. 
In Arizona, many Irish women turned in winning per­formances. 
Junior Llz Grow, the Big East runner-up in the 400-meter dash, won the 100 and finished second in the 200. Her 100 time of 11.91 is a new personal best. 
Kymia Love ran 55.06 in the 400 to take first. It was the first time the sophomore didn't have to run in Grow's shadow, and she made the most of her opportunity. 
In the first 1,500-meter race of her career, freshman Megan Johnson placed third with a time of 4:33.5. 
In the pole vault, Jamie Volkmer continued her domi­nance of her favorite event by winning the vault with an 11· foot, 5 3/4-inch leap. Freshman Jill Vanweelden placed third by clearing 10-11 3/4. 
In the long jump, sophomore All-American Tameisha King won her first outdoor competi· tion of 2001, jumping 19-11 3/4. 
Senior Travis Davey turned in the best individual perfor­mance out of the men who competed at Arizona by placing in the top five in two events. Davey took fifth in the 100 in 
10.91 and third in the 200 in 21.71. 
The men also turned in solid performances in the field events. Junior Andrew Cooper, who won the Big East high jump competition a month ago, cleared 6-8 3/4 for fourth place. In his first discus competition of the year, Derek Dyer took third place with a toss of 164-11. 
Among the athletes who com­peted at Purdue, thrower Dore DeBartolo's was the biggest story. The junior, who sat out the indoor season win an injury, placed second in the hammer throw and shot put. 
On the track, Jennifer Fibuch took second in the 5,000-meter run while Ana Morales placed second in the 800-meter run. 
On the men's side, Nathan Shay turned in an impressive fifth-place finish in the 10,000 meters, running 32:05. 
Josh Heck placed second in the pole vault with a leap of 15­
11. Meanwhile, Quill Redwine placed second by soaring 6-9 3/4 in the high jump, a new personal best.

WOMEN'S TRACK AND FIELD 
Belles go home satisfied with fifth place 
By.KATIE McVOY As>odaie Sports Editur 

The Saint Mary's track team may have finished fifth during Saturday's meet, but the run­ners considered the perfor­mance a team success. 
As a whole, the team reached eight personal bests and 10 season bests. 
"I think we did really well for ourselves," team captain Kara Bergeman said. 
Junior Erica Burket led the team. scoring 19 points along with attaining season bests in four events. Burket took sec­ond place in the triple jump, with a season best of 32-feet, 9 3/4 inches. A 5-0 high jump was enough to earn her a third place finish and another sea­

son best. Burket's 16.71 sec­ond dash through the 100­meter hurdles landed her a fourth place finish and her third season best of the meet. Wrapping up the new records for the season. Burket joined Whitney Ross, Anne Dudding and Laura Graf on a fifth place 4 x 400-meter relay. 
Ross and Graf also added split times of 1:10.8 and 1:01.0 respectively that were their best of the year. The team wrapped up a season best of 4:30.27. 
"Erica has always done well," Bergeman said. "This year it helps to have other jumpers helping her out." 
Freshman Becky Shcpkowski jumped in to aid Burekt in the field events. scoring nine points for the team on a 14-4 long jump that earned her fifth place in the event. The jump was a personal best for the recent addition to the Saint Mary's club. She also landed a 30-11 triple jump to finish in third place just behind team­mate Burket. Shepkowski teamed up with Dudding, Courtney Follmer and Jaclyn Thompson to claim a fourth place finish in the 4 x 100­meter relav, with a season best time of 57.06. Thomspon, Pollmer and Dudding each had season best split times, run­ning 13.8, 14.0 and 14.5 respectively. 
Thompson, a freshmen, didn't stop with a season best in the relay. Thompson cleared 8-6 on the pole vault for a per­sonal best and a new school record. 
The 4 x 800-meter relay team chalked up a second place victory. The team, com­posed of Nicole Garcia, Ross, Erin Kosco and Graf finished with a time ofl0:47.98. 
Follmer and Graf wrapped up the Saint Mary's scoring. Follmer took a fifth place finish in the 100-meter dash. with a time of 19.03. Graf claimed a first place victory in the 800­meter, with a time of 2:27. 
Although the Belles are lc1\.v in numbers on distance run­ners and had a weak throwing meet, they still reached several season bests. 
"It didn't help that we didn't have anybody place in throw­ing events," Bergeman said. "If we had a stronger field in throwing or more distance runners we would do better."

WOMEN'S TENNIS ... 
Netters' double play helps Irish dominate home court 
By STEVE KEPPEL 
Sports Writer 
There's no place like home, espe­cially for the Notre Dame women's tennis team. 
The seventh-ranked Irish improved their record to 17-4 after two impressive home victories over Iowa and William and Mary this weekend. The 17-4 record is the best for the Irish since 1985-86, their first year in Division I. The Irish have now won eight in a row at home and 26 of their last 27 in South Bend. 
"It's a really good advantage," said junior Becky Varnum. "The travel takes a toll on us. Also, when we are away we usually play on only four courts and there is a lot of waiting around. It's nice to play on six courts here because we all get to go out and play at the same time." 
On Saturday, the Irish came out CTred up against 32nd-ranked Iowa. Looking to make up for a tough loss last weekend to Tennessee and avenge a 1999 NCM Tournament loss to the Buckeyes, the Irish were unstoppable in a 6-1 win.
 
The fifth-ranked doubles team of All-American Michelle Dasso and Varnum continued its dominance as they won their 12th straight match 8-1. Their victory was followed by wins from Lindsay Green/Nina Vaughan and Kim Guy/Katie Cunha. as the Irish easily took the doubles point. 
It was all Irish from then on with singles wins from Varnum, Vaughan. Green, Guy and Dasso, who won her 130th singles match, an Irish record. Da.sso, rnnked No. 3 in the country, has now won 29 straight home singles matches, going back to the 1998-99 season. 
"I think we went in expecting a tough match; that's why we played so well," said Varnum. "I feel like every time we play them now its revenge: ever since they beat us two years ago its been psychologi­cally different." 
Sunday afternoon, the Irish took up right where they left otT, as they trounced William and Mary 7 -0. In their eighth shutout this season, the Irish ·swept the doubles point once again. Dasso and Varnum contin­ued their streak of 13 straight victo­ries, as they are now 16-2 in dual matches this season. Juniors Green and Vaughan clinched the doubles point, winning their eighth in a row, beating Kari Olsen and Kelli Partlow at No. 3 doubles 8-5. 

Green later secured the shut out for the Irish with a win over Lindsay Sullivan 7 -6 (7 -4), 6-2 at the No. 4 singles spot. The win improves her record to 5-0 at the number four spot. 
Dasso won her 30th consecutive home match by beating a pesky Delphine Troch 6-4, 6-3. Dasso bounced back this week with two wins. after uncharacteristically los­ing two in a row against Tennessee and Kentucky. Iler record now stands at a team best 30-8. 
In a shutout its obvious that everyone has played well and done their part but the play of Green and Cunha reallv stood out. Green, who has been battling shin injuries, fought hard to gain a two set over­time victory over Sullivan. 
Cunha, who lost a tough match Saturday, battled back by crushing Kelli Partlow 6-0, G-2. 
"Katie Cunha finished her match in a half hour." said Varnum. "Katie rebounded right back with a great win, she just went out and played hard and killed the girl."

Sharron throws no-hitter as Irish sweep competition 
By LIA GARClA MILHOAN Sports W rirer 
The Irish women's softball team began Big East play with a bang. 
Notre Dame swept a double­header against St. John's Saturday and came right back on Sunday to take a double­header from Seton Hall and boost its Big East record to 4-0. 
The Irish are now 26-3 on the season for the best start in 
Notre Dame added four runs in the bottom of the third led by the hitting of Lemire, Andrea Loman. Andria Bledsoe and Sharron. 
In the bottom of the fourth inning, Alkire hit her 26th career home run which both ended the game early and tied a school record for career homers. 
Sharron struck out the side in the fifth to secure the no-hitter.

Lizzy Lemire went 2-3 to lead the Irish charge. In the end. seven batters recorded a hit in the game.

Freshman Kristin Schmidt pitched her fourth shutout of the season and allowed only two hits while lowering her EHA to .74. 
However, Courtney Fitzgerald of St. John's was equally effec­tive, allowing just seven Notre Dame hits in six innings. 
Notre Dame's lone run came in the bottom of the sixth when Alkire led off with a double. Jarrah Myers doubled to center field, allowing Alkire to score and gave the Irish a 1-0 win.

Miller said. 

On Sunday, the Irish took on the Pirates of Seton Hall. With a 6-3 win in the first game and al0-2 win in the second the Irish swept its fourth consecu­tive doubleheader at Ivy Field. 
Notre Dame got on the board early in game one as Kriech and Alkire scored in the first. 
In the fourth inning. the Irish were up by three when the Pirates began their rally. 
With the bases loaded and only one out, Notre Dame's Madrid threw home to Myers for what appeared to be the second out. However, the home plate umpire called Myers for catch­er's interference, which auto­matically advanced all runners. Pirate Marlena Koiynski con­nected for a single that allowed two Seton Hall runs to score. 
The Irish escaped the inning in a 3-3 tie. 
Notre Dame responded with a three-run fifth inning of its own to secure a 6-3 win. 
The second game was Notre Dame's from the start. 
Schmidt struck out five of the first seven batters she faced. while the Irish offense put four runs on the board in the first inning and followed with five runs in the fourth. 
Leading the offensive display were Kriech and Alkire, who each posted two hits. The Irish added one more run in the fifth giving them a 10-2 win. 
The Irish will next play a dou­bleheader at Purdue on Tuesday.

WOMEN'S SOCCER 
Johnson replaces Milligan for Belles 
By KATIE McVOY 
Assouatc Spores Edi tm 
Athletic director Lynn Kachmarik announced last week the athletic department 
.. hired Bobbv Johnston of McLean. Va., to take the helm of the Belles' soccer program. McLean replaces two-year head coach Jason Mulligan, who resigned at the end of the 2000 season. 
Johnston, who was named "All-Metropolitan Coach of the Year" by the Washington Post in 2000, spent the last two years as the varsity girls' soccer head coach at Potomac High School. During Johnston's time at Potomac, the girls' soccer team fin­ished fourth in the Washington Post's Top 10 Hanking and won the Independent School League AA Title and Tournament Championship. The team fin­ished the season 14-3-2. .Johnston was named NSCAA Virginia Private School Girls' Coach of the Year in 1999. 
Johnston is excited about the transition to coaching in a college program. 
"l 've been coaching high school and younger women for six or seven years, and have been training Division I athletes lo get ready for their college program," Johnston said. "The game or soccer is the game of soccer. I'm going to teach the game." 
Johnstnn takes over at a critical point in the Belles' soccer program, as the team struggled to a 3-13-1 overall record and 3-10-1 record in the MIAA last fall. Working on attitude and goal setting will be two of the aspects Johnston will focus on to boost the team's record. 
"I definitely want to be realistic," Johnston said. "The team wants to have a better season. Attitude will be a big factor -when they step onto the field. they have lo believe in themselves. I think they lost a few close games last year because they didn't believe in themselves." 
Players ,rnd administrators are exrited about Johnson joining the Saint Mary's soc­
...... 
cer program. 
"LJohnstonl is going to be an excellent addition to our program," team captain lleather Muth said. "!Ie is very enthusiastic and more than willing to do whatever he can to take our program to the next level." 
"[Johnston's] enthusiasm, his knowledge. his work ethic and his commitment to excel­lence is what this program wants and what this program needs," Kachmarik said . 
"I think that [Johnston) brings to this [program] a level of expertise that we've not had before," Kachmarik said...He has great experi­ence with women athletes and high goals." 
Players will look to use Johnston·s experience and enthusiasm as a benefit to the Saint Mary's program. 
"I think his best quality is his energetic personality," Muth said. ''I'm truly impressed by how quickly he assumed the role of our new coach and it's obvious that he is really dedicated to our team." 
Johnston's dedication is already surfacing. Division Ill teams are allowed to have a spring training session and Johnston has taken advan­tage of that allowance, flying in from Washington D.C. sev­eral times to work with the team. 
"Coach is sincerely inter­ested in turning our program around and he has already done a lot of work to prepare for our fall season," Muth said. 
In addition to his coaching skills, Johnston will also be reaching out to the commu­nity. While at Potomac, Johnston founded Kicks for Kids, providing non-competi­tive, co-educational instruc­tion. 
Johnston will be coming to South Bend with his wife, who will be teaching at Stanley Clark Elementary. 
Johnston attended James Madison University, where he played Division I soccer and earned his undergradu­ate degree in finance. He holds a graduate degree in education from Shenandoah University. 
Johnston will be joined by assistant coach Lisa Reinke. Reinke will also be in her first year as a coach at Saint Mary's, although not in her first year at Saint Mary's. Reinke graduated from Saint Mary's in 1997 where she played soccer for the Belles. 
"[Heinke] will complement the staff with her connections to the communitv," Kachmarik said. ·

Famed Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne (above) died In a plane crash 70 years ago last Saturday. Rockne remains among the most-revered figures In Notre Dame history. 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Associate Sports Editor 
Seventy years ago last Saturday. a small plane plummeted through the night clouds hanging over Kansas. spinning end over end. One wing had fallen off, and a trail of smoke followed the plane through the sky. It continued its dive until it plunged into the ground, instantly killing all eight passengers aboard. 
One of them was Knute Rockne. 

News of the legendary Notre Dame football coach's death rocked the world. llis funeral was broadcast over the radio in Europe and Asia. The king of Norway even knighted Rockne posthumously. Studebaker imme­diately halted production of the Rockne Sedan Six 65 automobile when news of the tragedy hit newspapers across the America. 
The man had died. The legend was just beginning to live. 
Rockne was alreadv a hero in American culture before his plane crashed. He was a few months off leading the Notre Dame football team to the 1930 national cham­pionship. When he died at the age of 43, he was on his way to Hollywood to negotiate a deal about a film documentary. 
"In my opinion he was what you would call a straight, honest man and he liked to win football games," said 83-year-old Easter Heathman, one of only three peo­ple alive today who saw the man­gled wreckage of Rockne's plane in person. 
Saying Rockne liked to win foot­ball games is like saying Father Hesburgh was a decent University president. In Rockne's 12 years as the head coach, he posted a 105­12-5. His 88 percent winning per­centage, impressive in the 1930s, is considered untouchable by most of today's Division I coaches.
