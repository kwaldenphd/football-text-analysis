Student to appear before grand jury on fatal accident 
By MARK PANKOWSKI 
News Editor 
A county grand jury will decide today whether to indict a Notre Dame student in con­nection with the Dec. 6 accident that killed junior Michael Cogswell. 
The 21-year-old student has been subpoened to testify before the grand jury in St. Joseph County Superior Court, the county prosecutor's office said. 
Notre Dame senior Douglas Meier said he also was sub­poened to testify at the hearing, which is closed to the public. Meier said he was driving in the area when the accident oc­curred. 
The six-member grand jury will review police records and listen to testimony to deter­mine what charges, if any, to indict the student on, the pros­ecutor's office said. 
The student was arrested on the charge of driving while in­toxicated after he submitted to two blood-alcohol tests, said Cpl. Mary Potter of the county police department. 

The prosecutor's office did not charge the student, but in­stead sent the case to the grand jury for review. 
Potter said the student told police he was driving east on Saint Mary's Road, stopped at a stop sign, then went forward and hit an unknown object. 
Michael Cogswell, a Zahm Hall resident, died from mas­sive head injuries 10 hours later. 
One of his roommates said Cogswell was walking home with two friends when he was struck. They were returning from a party at the Saint Mary's Clubhouse, he said. 
The two friends are par­ticipating in foreign-study pro­grams this semester, he said. Receiving your cue They apparently will not return Pool shark John Kenney of Zahm Hall takes to testify before the grand jury. aim while brushing up on his billiard skills in 
Reagan tells nation he ''regrets'' selling arms to Iranians 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Reagan tJld the nation Tues­day night that he now regrets his failed risk in selling arms to Iran but, despite the continu­ing furor, "will not sit idly by if our interests and our friends in the Middle East are threatened." 
He said he did not want to see an America that had become "so obsessed with failure that we refused to take risks that could further the cause of peace and freedom in the world." 
The president delivered his sixth State of the Union address as the Pentagon shifted its overseas naval forces in what one source described as a response to recent hostage­takings in Lebanon. 
Reagan said relatively little about the situation in Lebanon and used the bulk of his remarks to lay out the agenda for the last two years of his presidency. 
In introducing wide-ranging remarks involving America's competitiveness overseas, its relations with the Soviet Union and its budget problems at home, he said, "Now, ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, why don't we get down to work?" 
Democratic congressional leaders, responding to the pres­ident in their own televised remarks, said they were will­ing to cooperate with Reagan, but that he must first answer questions about the sale of arms to Iran and whether he intended to swap arms for hostages. 
"The administration's recent dealings with Iran have cast a long shadow over this country," said Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia. "The sale of arms to Iran -in direct contradiction to our stated foreign policy-­raises x:eal questions about trust." 
"The administration has the obligation to tell the American people exactly what led to the arms-for-hostage deal--and what happened to accoun­tablility in the White House," Byrd said. 
The president's speech was broadcast live from the cham­ber of the House of Represen­tatives before a joint session of Congress. Smiling and looking fit, Reagan was applauded warmly as he returned to the public eye after a month's ab­sence following the holidays and recuperation from pros­tate surgery, 
Reagan said it was not wrong to try to establish contact with a nation of strategic impor­tance and "certainly it was not wrong to try to secure freedom 
for our citizens held in barbaric captivity." · 
He added, "But we did not achieve what we wished, and serious mistakes were made in trying to do so." 
Reagan said his administra­tion had made progress on many fronts but "I have one major regret. 
"I took a risk with regard to our action in Iran. It did not work and for that I assume full responsibility," Reagan said. 
While mentioning mistakes, Reagan did not say he, specif­ically, was guilty of any. Unlike his earlier statements on the subject, Reagan--in a single sentence--linked the effort to open contacts with Iran with trying to win the release of the hostages. The administration insisted previously that release of hostages was merely a byproduct of establishing a re­lationship with "moderate" elements in Iran. 

Dorm relcoation proposal discu~ssed by HPC 
By REGIS COCCIA Assistant News Editor 
A proposal for the relocation of the residents of Howard, Holy Cross and Carroll halls was discussed at Tuesday night's Hall Presidents' Coun­cil meeting. 
"The idea is to plan now and get some input before (the ad­mininstration) makes their decision,'' said Student Senator Brian Holst, who collaborated on the proposed program with Holy Cross President John Powers and Carroll President Tim Salmon. 
"The proposal is going to be effective in three years, but of course we don't know how it's going to work," Holst said. Ac­cording to Holst, the proposal is "a fair and favorable means of relocating displaced resi­dents without adversely affect­ing the residents of halls which are to remain open." 
Holst said the proposal recommends that no freshmen be admitted to either Carroll or Holy Cross Hall in the last year of its existence as an under­graduate residence. 
"We've got a limited number of spaces and the housing office has already got names for them," said Carroll Hall Pres­ident Tim Salmon. "We're just trying now to determine how many spaces we've got be­cause we've got guys coming back from overseas so we're trying to get that coordinated," Salmon said. 
The relocation program proposes that "members of a displaced hall should hold a 'dorm pick' within their hall in the same fashion as they would conduct regular 'room picks', only a few weeks earlier. A 'dorm pick' would allow resi­dents to choose the hall they want to move into, in accor­dance with availability. 
"During 'dorm picks', a stu­dent would be able to pull in up to three of his fellow residents with him," the proposal states. The proposal also recommends that each dorm be required to 
see HPC, page 4 
Reagan did not offer any new revelations about the arms sale and later diversion of profits to Contra rebels in Nicaragua. 
While pledging to find out the facts and take any necessary action, Reagan said that "in debating the past, we must not deny ourselves successes of the future. Let it never be said of this generation of Americans that we became so obsessed with failure that we refused to take risks that could further the cause of peace and freedom in the world. 
"Much is at stake here and the nation and the world are watching to see if we go for­ward together in the national interest, or if we let partisan­ship weaken us," Reagan said. 
He added: "Let there be no mistake about American policy : we will not sit idly by if our interests or our friends in the Middle East are threatened .'' 

Lee's Grill correction 
Because of an editing er­ror, an article about a Jan. 16 raid of Lee's Ribs was reprinted in the place of a story on a Jan. 25 raid. The information regarding the more recent raid is con­tained in today's inside column and a brief on page 2.

Lightning strikes twice when it comes to Lee's raids 
A flyer for Saturday night's events at Lee's Grill and Bar-B-Q declared that "Lightning 
· never strikes in the same place twice." Lightning's been comin' in pairs ever since. Law officers rained upon the bar like bolts from above Sunday morning, making three ar­rests and leaving 10 cited students in their wake. It was the second time in two weeks that the bar has been invaded by officers from South Bend, Indiana State, and Indiana State Excise police forces, according to Lt. Richard Kilgore. Seems as if Lee's is cursed for even uttering the words. The Observer became the curse's next victim when it printed a story about the first bust for the second time in Tuesday's edition. Another second: Sgt. Greg Deitchly of the Indiana State Excise Police led the joint oper­ation, just as he led the first. The citations were also the same the second time around: charges for being a minor in a tavern for alllO, according to Kilgore. One difference was the incredible number of patrons cited in the first raid --this one did not come near the new high of more than 200, set by the Lee's raid of Jan. 15. Three custodial arrests were made, Kilgore said. For Lee's, how long will this curse last? Can the bar survive it? The recent citations and arrests are state liq­uor law violations for which Lee's is liable, Kil­gore said. A meeting has been scheduled for today between the owners and the Alcoholic Beverage Commission, according to Gale Lighthall, a worker for the restaurant-tavern. Lighthall said he will attend the meeting. The ABC fined The Commons $1,500 on Nov. 10 of last year and closed the bar for five days after investigating a Dec. 15, 1985 raid. The Commons was charged with allowing minors to loiter after the raid. More citations were delivered in the Jan. 15 raid on Lee's than ever before in South Bend. The location of the bar that formerly held this dangerous honor is now a vacant lot. Another thing that may come out of the latest raids on Lee's is tougher police tactics regard­ing charges and arrests. One of those arrested in the Sunday morning

bust was given the same charge for which ten others were only cited. 
Lt. Kilgore said this was because the oolire record showed the patron~ried to hide in a crowd when law officers entered the building. 
Conduct "primarily differentiates who gets arrested and who gets a citation," Kilgore said. 
Kilgore said it is the arresting officer's prerogative to decide whether a patron should be arrested or cited. 
Kilgore added that patrons who try to escape while a bar is being raided can be charged with resisting law enforcement. 
The events over the last two weeks demon­strate that the police are cracking down harder on the underage drinking package: fake IDs, entering taverns and escaping from raids. 
They're trying to indicate that lightning sometimes strikes twice.

Former owner of Nickie's tavern forfeited $1,000 in bond money 
By MARILYN BENCHIK Assistant Saint Mary's Editor 
Nick Bilello, former owner of Nickie's tavern, forfeited $1,000 in bond money last week to the city of South Bend. 
Bilello failed "to repair the code violations which were placed on the building," said Larry Clifford, code enforce­ment hearing officer. 
"Bilello was in on a demoli­tion order and said he would like to have the demolition or­der set aside. He wanted the opportunity to fix the repairs," said Clifford. 
In order to convert the demolition order to a repair or­der, Clifford asked Bilello to post a bond. "He promised to perform as promised, and if he failed to perform, the bond would then be forfeited." 
Clifford said the bond was posted at 10 percent of the total estimated damage cost. "The damages were set at $10,000, so the bond equalled $1,000." 
Clifford said he issued an or­der form on Oct. 13, "categori­cally setting out five (types of) items that had to be repaired by Nov. 28." 
The five categories took all of the code violations and broke them down into specific code violations on the premises, ac­cording to Clifford. 
The violations ranged from holes in the roof to electrical and plumbing problems, said Clifford. 
"He (Billelo) only met two of those items." 
"I ruled there had not been substantial compliance to make repairs," said Clifford. 
John Gourley, Bilello's attor­ney, felt ''the city of South Bend should have been a little more lenient and understanding." 
"We feel the fact that we posted the cash bond showed our good faith," Gourley said. 
Gourley said Bilello had trou­ble getting a certain roofing contractor because "the con­tractor had other jobs lined up, and we don't think the city gave us enough time to make the re­pairs." 
"Our position was there are a many buildings that are worse off than the building Mr. Bilello owns," he said. 
Gourley said he thinks the city is "trying to get rid of the tavern by using selective en­forcement. They seemed hell­bent on getting rid of it." 
The property and the liquor license have been for sale for over a year. Gourley said the building and the license are being sold separately. 
The tavern closed in July 1985. "Mr. Bilello was dis­gusted with the way the bar had been run in his absence. The manager had allowed entrance to minors, and the bar was raided in Bilello's absence," Gourley said.

Weekend closing time altered at Theodore's 
By GREG LUCAS Staff Reporter 
The Office of Student Activi­ties has ordered Theodore's to close at 2 a.m. instead of 3 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays be­cause of damage to the LaFor­tune Center, according to Vince Willis, club manager. 
''There is some damage being done in the building and it's being blamed on the people in Theodore's," said Willis. 
Ceil Paulsen, assistant direc­tor of Student Activities, declined to comment on the na­ture of the damage and on the order to close Theodore's an hour earlier. 
According to Willis, there has been no damage to Theodore's since the Penn State game in November. "Nothing has been done in Theodore's since that first time," Willis said. 
"In the building there are other problems that I have been told are occuring between two and three a.m.," said Wil­lis, who was unable to describe the exact damage to the LaFor­tune center. 
Willis did not feel that closing Theodore's one hour earlier would significantly reduce the potential of damage being done to LaFortune. "The crowd be­tween two and three usually has been there and leaves at three. Most people do not come between two and three," said Willis. 
"If you close at two, it's like taking away one-third of the most valuable time," Willis said. "Not only do I think (the order's) not necessary, I think it's detrimental," Willis added. "There should be a place on campus to socialize after parie­tals," said Willis. 
"I can see why the adminis­tration is concerned with main­taining the building, but I think there are better solutions than closing an hour early," Willis said. Willis was optimistic that an alternative agreement could be reached. "I do think that if we come up with an ap­propriate plan, the administra­tion will be receptive," said Willis.

In other business, the Council discussed the Buzz Bus and drinking and driving. "The HPC Alcohol Committee met twice and came up with two recommendations," said Stan­ford Hall President Jim Wim­biscus. 
"First of all, we're thinking about a taxi service, where someone at a bar or a party gets drunk and then takes a taxi to the dorm. The RA on duty would have money, that he was provided with, to pay the taxi driver. The drunk per­son would either pay then or at a later time," Wimbiscus said. 
"We're going to push the Buzz Bus again," Wimbiscus said. "On campus we're going to try to have a free coupon with a schedule on the back; that way, everyone would have a chance to ride it," he said. 
According to Wimbiscus, the Buzz Bus will run on Thursdays as soon as a driver for that night is found. HPC Co­Chairman Joanie Cahill said ridership for the Buzz Bus is approximately 100 students per night.

Divestment would show committment to blacks 
"We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history there is such a thing as being too late. Procrastination is still the thief of time. We must move past indecision to ac­tion. Now let us begin. Now let us reded­icate ourselves to the long and bitter ­but beautiful -struggle for a new world. This is the calling of the children of God, and our brothers and sisters wait eagerly for our response. Shall we say the odds are too great? Shall we tell them the struggle is too hard? Or will there be another message, of longing, of hope, of solidarity with their yearn­ings, of commitment to their cause, whatever the cost? The choice is ours, and though we might prefer it other­wise we must choose in this .crucial mo­ment of human history." 
Martin Luther King

guest column 
Last semester an event took place which seems to have been glossed over by many on this campus. All around us there has been a call for tough action against the sin which is apartheid. But Notre Dame and perhaps this has been true of the nation as a whole is in no apparent rush to help-perhaps because those in need are people of color. 
'How can we expect them to be committed to blacks in another country when they are not even committed to blacks currently at­tending their own institution?' 
The event: ''TheNational Conference of Catholic Bishops urged Roman Cath­olic dioceses and institutions to strip themselves of their holdings in compan­ies operating in South Africa or per­suade those companies through stock­holder resolutions to withdraw business from that country." The Times article continues stating that "the recommen­dation is expected to affect hundreds of millions of dollars in the investment portfolios of this country's vast network of Roman Catholic institutions -184 dioceses, 19,313 parishes, 850 religious communities, 200 colleges and univer­sities and hundreds of Catholic hospi­tals and charitable agencies.'' I guess they should have said 199 colleges and universities since Notre Dame should not be included. 
IBM has divested. Kodak has divested. Coca-Cola has divested. GM has divested. The British National Bank has divested. Bishop Desmond Tutu has called for divestment. Winnie Mandela has called for divestment. The African National Congress has called for divestment. The Notre Dame Stu­dent Senate, the Notre Dame faculty, the Notre Dame Black Alumni Confer­ence, the Notre Dame Black Student Union have all called for divestment. And, as you now know, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops has called for divestment. But Notre Dame has remained steadfast and foolhardy. 
Let's face it, Father Hesburgh, Fa­ther Williams and the predominantly white Board of Trustees know what is best for the poor downtrodden black masses. Tutu and Mandel a live with the atrocities, the degradation, the humiliation, the injustices, the murders and the violence every day, how can they possibly know what is best for their people? Martin Luther King, Jesse Jackson and Medgar Evers obviously didn't know what was best for blacks during the Civil Rights Movement did they? But perhaps I am being a little too tough on them you say. And indeed this may be true for how can we expect them to be committed to blacks in an­other country when they are not even committed to blacks currently attend­ing their own institution. How can they be attentive to blacks there when they are not listening here? 
Picture this situation: an admissions counselor is standing in the midst of a room packed with minority high school seniors telling them how Notre Dame is Catholic, how socially concerned Notre Dame is, what a great place it is and how much they want minority stu­dents to attend Notre Dame. Then a black student raises his hand and asks whether or not Notre Dame has divested. Response: no, number of ap­plicants: none. What message does the University send to blacks across the country? As the premier Catholic insti­tution in the country, what message does it send to Catholics across the country? Notre Dame is living a lie, contradicting the ethical constructs upon which the very foundation of the University rests. 
Would the response be the same if the people involved were not people of color? Regretfully, I think not. The fal­lacy of Notre Dame's stance may be evidenced by another example. A couple of years ago when the African situation of starvation finally came to the attention of a long-since ignorant American population, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia sent the three million dollars it raised in the annual Catholic Charities Appeal to Poland to purchase toys and cribs instead of feeding the hungry. Similarly Notre Dame and the nation is not in any rush to help because those imperiled are not white, are not Irish, are not Polish are not Italian...and thereby not of primary concern. The blacks of South Africa are not viewed as true "brothers and sisters" and consequently though they "eagerly await a response" it shall not be forthcoming for there exists no "solidarity" with them. They are not worth the "cost." 
In this "crucial moment in human history" Notre Dame with its tauted Christianity and white purity has cho­sen "not to act". In the light of the "fierce urgency of now", Notre Dame has chosen "procrastination". We have told them "the struggle is too hard" and "the odds are too great". (Indeed Father Hesburgh has apparently wearied of the fight. Having been so intimately involved with the Civil Rights Movement perhaps he is too tired to recognize his inconsistencies. Father Hesburgh, would Martin Luther King shake your hand today?) Notre Dame has issued a hypocritical mes­sage which it shall prove to regret. I was always told that inaction in the presence of wrong was just as sinful as the wrong itself. Is not Notre Dame an accomplice to this sin which it says it abhors? It is time to stop talking, cut the lip service, and act. Otherwise how will they know that we are truly Chris­tians? 
If we continue to wallow in the valley of indecision and inconsistencies, then what Bishop Tutu said of the West in general may be directly applied to Notre Dame: it can "go to hell". For in not hearing and responding to the cries of the children of South Africa, Notre Dame has neither heard nor responded to the "calling of the children of God".

P.O.BoxQ 
Accidents caused by a lack of responsibility 
Dear Editor: 
After reading Kevin Trautner's and Sean O'Brien's letter of January 16th, I have suggestions for the two. 
First, they should read up on the laws of the state of Indiana, which prohibit drinking for anyone under the age of twenty-one. 
Second, they should check the ·u.s. Constitution, especially the amend­ment regarding unreasonable searches and seizures. 
Third, they should look up the defini­tion of the word "responsibility." 
This school's strict alcohol rules did not kill Michael Cogswell. An allegedly intoxicated student killed Michael Cogswell. One of the aims of the Uni­versity's alcohol policy of 1984 was to encourage responsible use of alcohol by

students. Unfortunately, some students did not react to the policy's implica­tions with responsibility, leading to tragic consequences. Letting the beer flow on campus again will not not rec­tify this tragic problem (Michael could just as easily have been killed in front of the Grotto as opposed to Saint Mary's). The fault lies squarely on the shoulders of the people who were drink· ing and who were involved in the acci­dent last December. It does not lie on the administration's shoulders. It does not lie on Father Beauchamp's shoulders. 
Until all students here take respon­sibilty for their actions and their drink­ing, no administrative action will prevent deaths like Michael Cogswell's from happening again.

The war of sexes is over! 
ND's 'fat chicks' and 'insecure boys' find peace 
&Jitor's Note: Today The Ob­server concludes its examination of women's progress at Notre Dame 15 years after females were first admitted to the Univer­sity. 
ROBIN SQUYRES features writer 

T
he girl took a deep breath, hitched up her voluminous, tent-like sweats, and stood up. She clutched her Calculus book to her chest for courage as she began the journey to end her craving for something sweet...something smooth... ice cream. 
From long experience, she knew tonight was mint chocolate chip night. She crept around the milk machine, fervently hoping no one would notice her. 
But it was too late--there they were. The Notre Dame Men. Laughing. Uproariously. "Fat chick, fat chick," they chanted ... 
So, you ask, what is it really like to be "a woman at Notre Dame?" Amazingly, completely erroneous stereotypes are ram­pant. 
Is it a life of pure bliss-­thousands of men lined up to date the few eligible girls? Or is it a life of pure hell--sexism, chauvinism and basic nastiness constantly directed toward the innocent, outnumbered female intellectuals? 
Oddly enough, when one in­vestigates the stereotype situa­tion on an individual level, it ceases to exist. Yes, my friends, CEASES TO EXIST. 
The women do not seriously feel the supposed tension vibes the men are supposedly sen­ding. and the men say of course they don't really mean the stereotypes they throw about so casually. 
Now let's get this straight--are we to infer that the massive, male! female tensions at Notre Dame that have been the object of probing psychological studies for years are no longer a valid excuse for meaningful subject matter? Apparently, an era has come to an end. 
As a residual effect, though, some predjudices remain. "It's harder to find girls' bathrooms around here than guys'." ob­served an anonymous female student. 
"The days ofNotre Dame being 
a male-dominated school are 
over, and everyone has to realize 
that, "says Sandra McBride, a 
sophomore. 
While we're discussing the 
Notre Dame female stereotype, 
It would only be fair to include 
their supposed "hatred" of Saint 
Mary's students. Everyone knows 
a Notre Dame girl will stop short 
of nothing to maim or kill a SMIC 
chick, right? 
Is this a fantasy created by Notre Dame men who love the illusion of women clawing at each other over SYRs? Or a sad but true story of frustrated, com­petetitlve females? 
Sure, you'll catch the occas­sional grimace as you mention the females "across the road, "but the deep-seated hatreds simply do not exist. 
"Most NO girls are ingrained with a little tension, but they al­ways admit they know nice girls at St. Mary's," says McBride. "Notre Dame and St. Mary's girls are more than happy to meet each other at parties." 
"I don't think that people take the stereotype as seriously as they put across," says Chris Murphy, a Flanner Hall resident. He adds, "I personally look at It as a joke." 
There are some actual facts that have given way to ugly tension-causing rumors. For in­stance, It is common knowledge that it is harder for a female to get into Notre Dame than a male. Thus, the average female of the last few years here is said to be of superior Intelligence to the average male. 
The university is presently in­creasing female enrollment to better balance the ratio. The greater number of female slots will hopefully lessen the female disadvantage, and the accompa­nying male inferiority complex. 
Women's support groups have been started to cope with the "special problem of being a wo­men at Notre Dame," but have actually died from lack of inter­est. 
Is that to say there are no prob­lems? There are always insulted individuals rampaging about, but the majority of the student population enjoys a peaceful coexistence with the opposite sex (under the constant superv­sion of du Lac, of course). Jibes below the belt are com­monplace, but that's human na­ture. 
We have our fun mocking each other because we're not allowed to do much else. But at least we can thank Notre Dame for honing our sense of keen wit and stimulating conversation.

... meanwhile, Howard braces for a sex change 
GINA CAMARENA features writer

onversion of Howard Hall into a women's dorm will begin the day after commence­ment, according to Physical Plant Director Don Dedrick. "The process is a very simple one," said Dedrick, since both men's and women's dorms are easily interchangeable." Basically, the only renovation will be done within the lavatories, and is scheduled to be completed before the start of the Special Olympics this summer. 
Residents of Howard continue to feel "angered," "upset," and "disappointed" in the way the ad­ministration conducted the af­fair. The issue now concerning the residents is how they will stay together next year. 
Hall President Jim Bradford said "they (the administration) did not give us much ofan option to stay together." Howard resi­dents were only guaranteed that groups of six men could be placed in the same dorm, but not necessarily room together. As a result, he said, "residents plan to move off-campus next year-­many to Campus View." 

However, Bradford also stated that the situation could prove to be a positive one, because now residents "realize how much they really like Howard Hall." 
Bradford believes that the delayed notice of the conversion of Howard was a "political move to stop any demonstrations or protests." "During finals week the residents were too busy to do anything about the notice," said Bradford. 
Other Howard residents ex­press mixed emotions about the conversion. Although resident Doug McLaughlin plans to "stay on campus" next year he has not decided where he would like to live. McLaughlin also felt that "everyone now realizes how much Howard really means." 
Resident Matt Kelty said his "anger has changed to frustra­tion." Kelty said, "I realize the opposition is useless, but there are many things that can't be ac­counted for." Kelty is disap­pointed in the administration for their "insensitivity" toward the residents and for "not presenting their reasons more clearly." 
Although freshman Bruce Haikola has not lived in Howard long enough to "feel close to the others," he is still upset about the conversion. Haikola also said that meeting new people next year will be a challenge. 
Resident John Piecyk is disap­pointed in the administration and is upset about the Howard change. "(Howard) is an intlmat community--everyone is con­cerned about everyone," said Piecyk. He also thought it was a "rude" gesture for girls to exam­ine the dorm the same day the residents received their eviction notices. 
The conversion of Howard and the building of two new women's dorms is part of the attempt to equal the male-female ratio at Notre Dame. The two new dorms will be constructed between the Memorial Library and Pasquerllla East and West. 
Many Howard residents have suggested that the new dorms be expanded to accommodate the number of females that will be living in Howard. However, "the buildings are filling capacity and the cost effective is too 
reat," accord in to Dedrick.

The Irish have faced several adverse situations this season, particularly the loss of three players. Bunek admits that it has been very tough on the team but says that it certainly will not keep them from playing their best basketball. 
"You have to put things into perspective," she adds, "and be very positive. You have to think of it as a challenge to the team. It's a tough experience but we'll be better in the end." 
The Irish have been improv­ing with each trip out on the court, so the Flyers of Dayton and first-year head coach Sue Ramsey will face a stiff chal­lenge at 7:30 tonight in the ACC.

ahead of the rest of college bas­ketball for much of last season. They are coached by the legen­dary Dean Smith, so legendary that Carolina's arena bears his name, even though he is still living. Despite those lofty ac­complishments, the Heels felt the need to offer suggestions to the officials. 
Most fans remember last season's tight battle in the heart of Carolina country. The Irish gave the Heels a run, but eventually fell. Smith and his center Brad Daugherty were not satisfied with the win, though. They were less than enthused with Phelps' version

of the Bruise Brothers, Tim Kempton and Jim Dolan. To emphasize the point, it was sug­gested that the Heels don tear­away jerseys for this year's battle. 
One would have to wonder why the superior team, after winning a game in which its op­ponent had played very well, would find the need to chastise the officiating. There are enough legitimate complaints that need to be addressed with­out wondering if Brad Daug­herty got roughed up a bit. 
Officials have an impossible job, but it is still frustrating to see blown calls. The key is to adjust to their style, if at all possible, and make them as in­significant a part of the game as possible. Complaining about officiating is a dangerous game, and it can blow up in your face. 
The Irish will be substantial underdogs this Sunday. But if they can build up a head of steam against fellow indepen­dents Dayton and Marquette, anything can happen. Tear­away jerseys, huh? Who knows, the ACC could once again prove fatal to a No. 1 team. And then Dean Smith will have put his Heels in his mouth.

Of course, all of this protest­ing does little good. It sounds like sour grapes, even if the point is valid. Sometimes it can get a coach into trouble. If Notre Dame played in a con­ference, Phelps would prob­ably get a reprimand from the conference commissioner for his post-game comments.

Notre Dame will continue playing UCLA, no matter how terrible the referees are, and no matter who Walt Hazzard thinks he is. Poor officiating is part of basketball because the game itself is nearly impossible to cover well. Mis­takes in the officiating are ex­pected, but they are magnified when they occur at the end of the game. Or if they occur in a big game. That brings us to Sunday's collision with the na­tion's top-rated team.

Irish survive UD rally, hang on for 66-55 win 
By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 
There were times when one had to wonder whether Notre Dame had learned its lesson. 
After blowing an 11-point lead at UCLA this past Satur­day in a 63-59loss to the Bruins, the Irish looked to be toying with fire again last night, but held on with some clutch free­throw shooting to pull out a 66­55 victory over Dayton at the ACC. 
Notre Dame built an 11-point lead on four occasions in the second half, largely behind the strong inside play of 6-8 senior Donald Royal (17 points) and 6-9 junior Gary Voce (16 points,

12 rebounds), but the Flyers 
"I thought we got careless at times and that's why I took David <Rivers) out," said Irish head coach Digger Phelps. Phelps benched his star point guard for almost six minutes in the second half, leaving the backcourt duties to senior Scott Hicks. Rivers finished the game with only eight points, seven below his season average of 15.1. 
"I just thought he was trying to do too many things by him­self, and we've got to space him out for the rest of this week," said Phelps. "We just can't af­ford to be careless against good people." . 
The Irish then took control of the game with nine straight free throws to seal the win, four by sophomore Mark Stevenson,

The last time the Notre Dame women's basketball team faced Dayton, a conference championship was on the line. In a hard-fought battle in Dayton last March, the Irish pulled out a 66-62 victory and a bid to the Women's National In­vitational Tournament. 
Tonight the Flyers seek revenge as the two teams take to the ACC court for a 7: 30 con­test. 
A key factor in that game last year was the return of then­freshman Heidi Bunek to the Irish lineup. Bunek had suf­fered a stress fracture in her right leg early last season which kept her on the bench for much of the season. She returned, however, to average 
13.8 points and 12.8 rebounds over the season's last four games as the Irish soared to a third-place finish in the WNIT. Bunek now admits the return was difficult. 
"I missed fourteen games," said Bunek. "Coming back from that was hard because it was just like starting all over again. I watched all the games so I could progress mentally, but physically it was hard get­ting back into shape. But I worked hard and I knew it would pay off eventually." 
Pay off it did. Bunek, a native of Milwaukee, Wise., topped off her strong comeback by ear­ning a spot on the WNIT All­Tournament team. Now, as a sophomore, she has taken over as the team leader, averaging approximately 14 points and eight rebounds per game. She teams up with another Wiscon­sin native, junior Sandy Bot­ham, to give the Irish a strong one-two punch in the front line. 
Bunek's big contributions to the Irish are no surprise con­sidering the basketball success that she has achieved through­out her career. Named to six first-team All-America squads as a senior at Pius XI High School in Milwaukee, Bunek led her team to four consecu­tive state championships and was named Wisconsin's Miss Basketball for 1985. 
"We lost only two games in my high school career," said Bunek proudly. "We started a dynasty. My high school is going for its seventh consecu­tive state championship and is on a 55-game winning streak. That all started with us." 
Bunek attributes much of her success on the court to her sup­portive family, and her father in particular. 
"My dad is the one who got me started," she says. "I really didn't start playing organized basketball until the eighth grade and I was very thin and lanky. My dad put me on a weight program. We have a weight gym in the basement that is almost as big as the one here at Notre Dame. He taught me everything. He would work me for hours. I didn't have older brothers to play against like a lot of girls do so my dad was the one who taught me the game." 
This closeness with her fam­ily was one of the major reasons why Bunek chose to come to Notre Dame. 
"My final five schools were Texas, USC, Louisiana Tech, Notre Dame and Nevada-Las Vegas. I chose to come here be­cause it was close to home and
