How the Student Union works 
By Tom Degnan 
This is the first of a two part series dealing with the Student Union and its functions. The first part deals with the Union ad­ministration and the Cultural Arts Commission and the Academic Commission. The second part, to be published in tomorrow's paper will be con­cerned with the Social Com­mission and the Services Com­mission. 
When the Student Senate Constitution Subcommittee submitted a bill to the Senate in mid-February proposing the dissolution of the Student Government, the main complaint from the students was not that the resolution left the campus without a provisional voice but that it provided for the disban­ding of the Student Union. The newly merged ND-SMC Student Union is probably the most in­despensible part of the current student government. It's ap­proximately 250 members make up the constituency that decides what speakers to bring, what movies to show, or how the LaFortune book co-op is going to be run. 
Organizationally, the Union is split into two divisions, the ad­ministrative and the com­missions. The Union Director oversees the operation of the commissions and irons out any of 
OBSERVER INSIGHT 
the Union's problems. Two AssistantDirectorshaverecently replaced the offices of Executive and SMC Coordinators. Under the new programs set up by director Bill McGrath one Assistant Director acts as a liasion for minority affairs while the other' appointed from the St. Mary's student body' attends solely to programs instituted on the SMC campus. Offices of Comptroller and Assistant Comptroller were initiated last year to watch over t~e Union's expenditures and fmances. 
It is the commissions however that provide the bulk of the programs that the Union spon­sors. Through them the Student Government most closely affects the students. 
The Academic Commission is the largest budgeted commission of the Union with a total of $19,000 of this year's Union's $35,000 Student Government allotment going toward the procurment of speakers for the ND-SMC campuses. The commission occasionally relies on agencies to book it's speakers but most of the approximately 80 speakers brought to the combined cam­puses this year were obtained by the Academic Commission itself. The commission is comprised of between 25 and 30 members whose responsibility it is to write letters to the various speakers and speakers agencies. This year the speakers were brought to the campuses in conjunction with nine main programs which in­eluded; a distinguished lecturer series, a woman's speakers program, an Asian studies series,

The consolidation of the two schools Academic programs was an experiment this year aimed at using the facilities at both schools to benefit both student bodies. The present cooperative system has resulted not only in a more extensive speakers program but 
also in a reduction of the strain on

The Judicial process at Notre Dame 
This is the first of a two part series explaining the structure and procedure of the University Judicial Code. This article deals with University wide judicial bodies, while tomorrow's will concern itself with the hall boards. 
By Art Ferranti 
The present judicial code is an outgrowth of an excessively legalistic document drawn up by the SLC and rejected by Father Theodore Hesburgh. Originally termed the "Burtchaell Code," in recognition of the then Theology Department head's contribution, differed markedly from the rejected code in its simplicity. 
The code set up a two tier judicial system. The individual hall judicial boards handle all offenses committed by residents within the hall, while the university board judges all other cases. 
All violations and of­fenses"committed against the good of the university com­munity" committed by univer­sity students residing both on campus and off are referred to either the Dean of Students or the University Board. The student can choose either to be tried by. No matter who or what method he chooses, though, the student also has the right to appeal the case to the Appeals Board. Ultimately, a case may be brought to the University President, if he chooses to accept it. 
The University Board is composed of twelve students appointed by the Student Body President and the Dean of Students. Three faculty mem­bers, who act as chairmen are appointed by the Faculty and Dean of Students. The board itself retains a lawyer and a psychologist as "permanent advisors." For each sitting, the Dean of Students picks five students and one chairman w' J may not vote. 
The two present advisors · re Dr. Charles Arens, assist.p of. and clinical psycholigist, and Prof. Michael Mcintire, law. Dave Tushar, the present Judicial Com­missioner(appointed by the Student Body Presiden­tlconsiders the employment of a lawyer and a psychologist a good addition by the originators of the code. He feels that the psychologist can lend personal advice to both the board and the accused while the lawyer gives professional, legal consul. 
Tushar's Judicial Commission hives aid and assistance to the student. The code states (Section on Student Rights, articles 5,7,8,and ll)that a student has a right to seek consul. Utilizing a staff of four, Tushar provides this consul to the student so the ac-
OBSERVER INSIGHT 
cused will be made aware of his situation and will have respon­sible "aid and assistance." Tushar said his group does not make determinatigns in the trial. 
Fr. James L. Reihle, CSC, Dead of Students, is responsible for the observances of all the judicial code procedures. 
He said it was to early to tell how the code has worked, since its ratification by the SLC and Fr. Hesburgh late last October. 
Fr. Riele's ability to judge a student recieved favorable comments from Fr. Maurice Amen CSC, Flanner rector and head of the Non-Violence Program. Fr. Amen said he would never hesitate to send a student to Fr. Riehle if he had allegedly committed a university offense. Fr. Riehle was, in Fr. Amen's estimation "fair and considerate." 
Prof. Edward Manier, a member of the university board, said he was satisfied with the sense of responsibility shown by student members. In the one case the board has heard thus far, Manier claimed the student members made "a real responsible and fair in­terpretation, did not make new rules(since the University Board is a judicial and not a legislative body), and made a good judgement. 
The Appeals Board is com­posed of one student, Greg Potts, one faculty member, Dr. John Kovel, sociology, and one ad­ministrator, Dean William Burke. They form the appellate board under which decisions of the University Board and the Dean of Students may be either overturned or upheld. 
Potts said that he,' in general, was "pleased with the preamble of the code(which was very idealistic in eoncept)while at the

The Institute, named after Robert Kennedy, was founded in 1969 with a $30,000 Ford Foun­dation grant. In past years, the Institute has funded community projects in Appalacia and · sociological research in Mexican­American communities of Texas. 
Next year the Institute will concentrate on the Notre Dame­South Bend area, linking students who are willing to work with local organizations that need tem­porary workers. Much of this work will be correlated with the student government Community Relations Board.

same time discouraged with the legalistic strictness of the University Rules and Regulations." Potts stated that the board is in a bind as to what basis their decisions shoud rest upon, the legalistic rules and regulations or the idealistic preamble which speaks of love over law. As a result, he said they are attempting to combine the best of the two in order to seek "a clarification of what should stand as policy of the University Community in relation to the external behavior of its mem­bers." 
Potts claimed in the three cases tried in the Aopeals board history, the good order of the University Community has been upheld. 
In general, Potts said, offenses concerning parietals, drugs and drinking are considered by the University Board. Each case though is considered on an in­dividual basis as to jurisdiction. 
.. The third university wide judicial body is the Board of Traffic Appeals. This board consists of two students and one faculty member and "considers student appeals of alleged violations of Traffic Rules." Its decisions are final. 
An offshoot of this body is the Joint Traffic Appeals Board made up of two ND and two SMC students. They decide on cases in which a ND student allegedly infringes on SMC traffic or­dinances and vice-versa. Its decisions are also final. 
Tomorrow, the hall judicial boards and their performance will be discussed in relation to the 
Judicial Code.

Hunger strike planned for 
weeK-end war protest 
Three Notre Dame students have announced plans to conduct a sit-down hunger strike on the steps of the Administration building this weekend. 
Senior Lance Corey said that the action is intended "to show empathy with all affected by the war in Southeast Asia." He of­fered it as an alternative to the anti-war activities planned in Washington on April 24th. 
Corey said that informal 

Fieldhouse still to be used for storage; not razed 
Dr. Thomas S. Fern, art department chairman, denied rumors yesterday that the Fieldhouse would not be used for summer storage this year because of demolition plans. 

Unitl recently, it had been thought that storage would not be possible because of stipulations made by the insurance company that covers the building. The company requires that all access to the fieldhouse floor be shut off so as to avoid damage to, or theft of merchandise. Last summer, when the art department used only the boxing room, a fence sealed off the stairwell to the storage area. 
This year several of the rooms bordering the basketball floor will be converted to studios thus opening up the building to a constant flow of people. Luckily, for those who plan to store their belongings, an alternate plan was decided upon by the department and the Junior class, which sponsors the service. 

discussions on the moral, political and practical im­plications of the war are planned. He said that he also hoped to 
arrange poetry readings, a 
guerilla theater, and  a  Sunday  
morning Mass.  
"We would  like  to  invite  all  

members of the community to join in participation in whatever capacity they wish," Corey said.

The question and answer 
which followed Ahmad's lecture concentrated on revolutionary actions. The basic tenet treated by Ahmad was that a revolutionary action is most successful when it has the effect of freeing people from the felt constrains of authority. "The main goal of a revolution," Ah­mad said, "is to complete the 'delegitimization' of the

Vietnam did he experience any hostility because he was an American. 
In reference to the Calley trial, Parker said that he believed that "Calley is a scapegoat, but he is still a murderer." He felt that "Generals Abroms and West­moreland should also be put on trial." In regards to American POW's, Parker stated that these people were not kidnapped, but that "they were shot down from the skies, dropping death on orders from the Pentagon." 
Parker concluded by stating that the North Vietnamese people were expecting an invasion. "However the people are not going to give up, there is a spirit of resistance and they are determined to preserve what is theirs," he stated. 


Amerena takes frosh orientation post 
Hall Life Commissioner Bob Higgins announced yesterday the appointment of John Amerena as FRESHMAN ORIENTATION COORDINATOR. 
Amerena, a Morrissey Hall senator, said that he has already begun compiling back in­formation on orientation. 
It will help "hall cha1rmen put together a workable program applicable to freshmen coming into their hall," Amerena said. 
He also plans to set up a workshop for group leaders and compile a general information booklet to be distributed to fresh­
men during orientation.

Amerena said that he plans to

There will be no mass mixer, or "cattle show" as Miss Hicks calls it, held next fall. Instead, plans are being formulated for small mixers involving individual Notre Dame residence halls. "Ideally all the halls will be reached, Miss Hicks added. 
She said that orientation ac­tivities will extend beyond the normal orientation week and several "useless activities" will 
be removed from the schedule.

Commission profit. Financially, the Cultural Arts Commission runs on a no profit no-loss proposition. This year it had an initial budget of $13,000. The Sophomore Literary Festival is the largest of the Cultural Arts programs, costing an estimated $12,000 this year. The Com­mission also provides a number of poetry readings and outdoor concerts free of charge. Films are obtained either through a college film release agency or 
through a direct to the producer committment. · 
The Commission uses both the Engineering Auditorium, for 16 millimeter, and Washington Hall for 35 millimeter films. A Collegiate Folk Festival had been planned originally for the latter part of April but because plan­ning stages began too late the festival idea had to be aban­doned. Bookings for groups and films are made throughout the year on a flexible system. 

Class o_ffice merRer 
A referendum to determine whether joint class officers should be elected for next year's Notre Dame-St. Mary's senior classes will be held tonight, according to Susie Way, SMC junior class president. 
The referendum will take the form of a telephone vote by members of the present junior classes. Votes may be cast by calling 4695 between 7 p.m. and midnight. The results will be announced Friday . 
"The foundations last year and this year for the total merging of the class of '72 of St. Mary's and Notre Dame led to the logical conclusion that the officers by elected from the merged class," Miss Way said. 
The "foundations" include a joint class passed last September which includes a provision describing joint officers as a goal. The constitution also provides for a combined treasury. 

NDNight gatherings probe, "How Catholic" is du Lac? 
Monday, April 19, was Universal Notre Dame Night, the night on which alumni clubs around the country traditionally meet in honor of Notre Dame. 
According to Michael Jordan, Assistant Alumni Secretary, these gatherings have taken place since 1925 and they are usually highlighted by a visit from a member of the university. 
This year, officers of the University and other members of the administrative staff, faculty members, a few men from the athletic department and about a dozen students spoke to alumni clubs in 92 cities on days focusing about the 19th. Their theme was 
"Notre Dame: How Catholic is it?" This is a question that arises in 
the minds of a great maJority of our alumni," Jordan said. "Many of those who have been away from the campus for a long time try to explain the University in their own terms and often it doesn't fit. We tbJnk that someone from the university can present facts and explanations, and we have found that the alumni become at least more understanding when they receive this attention." 
"These talks can be very ef­fective means for carrying on the continuing education process for 
the alumni of Notre Dame," he said. "Generally we reach a greater number of people in a shorter time through the Universal Notre Dame nights than at any other tin'1e."
