MONDAY, MARCH 1970 7118 
Bright NSA future seen 
by Tjm Treanor selves." basic point-we have a long way 
Since their ties with tbe Central Intelligence Agency were exposed, the National Student Association has been reduced to an impotent echo chamber for the new left. Or has it? To find out, Observer reporter T.C. Treanor interviewed NSA head Mike Shaughnessy, and several campus notables. In this, the first of two installments, Shaughnessy talks about the nature and the direction of the National Student Association. 
The NSA files are much like Mike Shaughnessy himself­informal, perceptive and deep. They contain a chronology of the NSA past the CIA fiasco; a mottled collage of uprisings, attacks, counterattacks, and spinoff groups. But through it all, the NSA endures, and, if Mike Shaughnessy is to be be­lieved, will endure for a long time. 
"The NSA is more able to make constructive change than radical groups," Shaughnessy contended, "Anti-NSA literature says that the NSA's membership ha~ decreased since 1967, but in fact shortly after the CIA thing came out, three colleges left the NSA and about twenty-one joined." 
The anti-NSA literature that 
Shaughnessy referred to was put 
out by STOP-NSA, an organiza­
tion closely alligned with the 
conservative Young Americans 
for Freedom. It charges the NSA 
with mindlessly following the 
lead of radical groups. 
Shaughnessy doesn't see the situation in that light. "The National Student Association is going to depend totally on student governments across the country," he argues. "NS A policy isn't generated by the SDS, or any little group of devious politicos. It's generated by the constituent parts of its organization-the student gov­ernment representatives them-
Better communication 
(continued from page 1) 
can be completed as rapidly as possible. The-coordinating com­mittee welcomes proposed sur­vey topics from any person or group that feels they have an issue of current importance that previously has been merely spec­ulated upon. 
The organizers of the service believe that improved cornmun_i­cations between the Notre Dame-St. Mary's community will be achieved through this service if the cooperation of the stu dents can be maintained. 
Don Driscoll, a senior socio­logy major who helped form the Student Survey Service, said, "It is intended that the Student Survey Service become a per­manent resource for all segments of our community. The results of each particular study will be maintained in order that a de­gree of continuity may be pro­cured. It is intended that student abilities be both measured and recorded so that the degree of change over time or as a result of particular occurences can also be obtained. It is hoped that the results may also provide valuable information to the students, fac­ulty and administrators who in particular are obliged to consider and respond to the needs and desires of our evolving communi­ty." 
Persons interested in further information should contact Gary Gereffi at 283-8037 or Don Dris­coll at 283-1693, 
Shaughnessy doesn't see the NSA as a political organization, though. Rather, he visualizes it as "a couple thousand people from all parts of the country getting together and discussing issues pertinent to them." According to Shaughnessy, the NSA's prime function is that of an informational repository, a "voluntary library" of student government experiences. 
Shaughnessy is in a position to know. He was elected last summer to the National Super­visory Board as one of three midwest (Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky) representatives. As a representative, he has a complete file of NSA records at his finger­tips. 
"It's a student government organization," he says, "and it's got about five hundred member schools. The advantages it has for students are tremendous. Financially, it's gotten student reductions in food, posters, clothings, travel-a whole series of things." 
Before the CIA thing, we used to get grants and put them into the treasury, where we could use them at will. Some of our projects suffered financially; some of them went into debt. Now, grants are designated to specific programs." 
"Some of the big schools­Harvard, for example-have left us because they don't think we have anything for them any­more. As a result, the NSA is moving to the right on a lot of things." According to Shaugh­nessy, Catholic Women's colleges fill a large portion of the NSA. 
Notre Dame's NSA represen­tative makes little secret of his desire that Notre Dame remain in the NSA. 
"I see every reason in the world for Notre Dame to stay in the NSA-academic, social­every reason. We are only at a to go to give students a role in the University's legislative pro­cess. The information we receive cannot but be of aid to progress in those areas." 
"We have not reached the point at which NSA won't help us any more. I'm not sure if we ever could reach that point. We'll always be able to learn from the failures of other col­leges."

The last word 
It is not often that a journalist takes pen in hand to comment on the activities of a fellow member of the fifth estate. Politicians never seem to hesitate to comment on the actions or" their fellows. Their opponent is always fair game. But journalists seem to be of another breed. They seem afraid to criticize in writing because they understand the power of the printed word and so fear to set off a genocidal tendency among their own species. Of course there are people like an Art Buchwald who are willing to suggest things on the sly about fellow writers; but then again he created a characature and didn't go after his opponent by name. 
I myself would hate to start a precedent, but I feel that there is something that should be said-for the sake of what I construe to be the obligation of publications in general. In these times when the media is the message it is obvious that any type of publication Plans a large role in the way that people think, and so, act and react. It is the press that can lead soc~ety, or a community if you wish, to higher plateaus of accomplishment. It is the press ~h1ch can make people stop and think --or indeed could make people stop everything. If 1t we~e~'t ~or t_he printed word there couldn't be a mass movement to save the starving and dteillg ill Btafra or a smaller movement to raise Toys for Tots in the nation's hospitals at Christmas time. There could be no mass Chicago 7 support demonstrators nor even an app~al to the Silent Majority. 
Of course all this power places a tremendous amount of responsibility on the shoylders of the people who weild it -if that doesn't sound too much like Spiro Agnew. Where the Vice-President and I differ is in what the nature of that responsibility should be. Agnew cares about what the press weilds its power for. I care only (in a professional sense) that the press weild its power FOR SOMETHING and not FOR NOTHING. 
Now that last statement might seem like an acute exercise in semantics but I didn't intend it to be so. As far as the press is concerned I have no professional qualms with it as long as it stands for something--be that something conservatism, liberalism, or what have you. But once professional press starts opting for nihilism I'll argue against it with all my effort. 
Once the press stops pushing, society will shrivel up as will progress along with it. When the press' progressive spirit dies, the spirit of the people that it serves will die too. It is for that reason that I am disappointed in my fellow editor one flight up --he wrote an obituary on Friday when he should have outlined a direction. The worse part about it is that he wrote it about something that is still living. 
Rich Moran looked at America and noted the ailments that come with old age. By the time one reaches the age of 194 he has made a lot of mistakes. Quite possibly innocence is gone -there is a lot to be ashamed of. But no individual's life is totally despicable. There is a lot to take pride in. It is the way the individual reacts to his mistakes that counts. Does he learn from them? Does he attempt to overcome his shortcomings and pull himself to higher levels? 
Moran's comments noted the wrinkles in America's skin, how it had been scared by abuse and neglect·-another sign of age. It was easy to note the way the dirt of years of toil have combined. with the sweat of persistent struggling to clog America's pores with a" decrepit and polluted look. Then he seemed to mirror an attitude that many Americans seem to hold about old people. When they grow old and are no longer productive they are written off, sent off to old age homes to retire, their children waiting in most instances for the day they kickoff. 
If there is one thing that this old nag America has stood for during its long life, it is hope. _There was always hope in Americans' hearts and· an American ideal engendered hope ill the hearts o( people around the world. I don't believe that hope should be written off so easily. America has made many mistakes. Maybe because of them, the word America doesn't mean hope any longer to a lot of people around the world. If so, then this is the time when the word hope should mean the most for America itself. We have to look beyond our shortcomings -rise above our failings -push ahead and not wallow co_ntent in old age ready to die. We can't sit back and "weep helplessly as. it (America) collapses." There is a lot left in its spirit that young Americans have to draw on. It is that feeling that the American press must draw out. To become a prophet of doom is to admit your own failure.

Dave Lammers 
On bra burning 
A modest silence is a woman s crown. -Sophocles 
Women's Liberation is having a tough time getting off the ground here, and I think its a damn shame. Part of the trouble is that we have left it up to the girls to organize the movement. In fact, a lot of men have denounced women's liberation as being opposed to femininity, motherhood, and gentleness, while the women consider women's liberation as war against men, against the old fashioned subservient view of women, and the placing of women in second-class jobs by the men that control America. · 
The conflict is, the result of the total ignorance of the men. We just don't know what's in it for us; if we did, we'd be all for it. 
Consider the case at the University of Dayton, where women's lib is really big. The girls ask guys out for dates and pay for it, and girls refuse to let a guy open a door or help them out of (or into) their coats. 
Taking their cue from the black liberation movement, the Dayton girls wear buttons with a clenched fist. The girl behind the movement at that university recently gave a speech. The hall was jammed, and after the inflammations were over some males tried to ask questions. Ala Leroi Jones, the liberated woman refused to recogniz~ the men, and forced them to have a girl in the audience ask the questions for them. . 
The real clincher is that the men are encouraged to tell girls off in. the same way that a normal male tells another male off. The Smdent Body President at Dayton goes around telling girls to get this-l!d and get that~d, (only he uses the real word). According to my sources, the girls love it. 
Now before Kathy Cecil and other liberated women accuse me of 
purposeful gross distortions and demolish The Observer office let 
me admit that I know little or nothing about Women's Liberation. 
Oh, I saw the picture in Time of a woman flinging her liberated bra 
into the bonfire, and I think I understand why girls dislike being mampulated by the ad men on Madison Avenue . . P~rhaps more intricate analyses of this issue are required to get a gul mvolved, btH for the men, the advantages are obvious. Can you imagine the thrill of having a St. Mary's girl call up and say "Hey, I sat _behind you on the shuttle this morning and I just 
happened to notlc~ your name on the laundry tag of you left sock, and I wondered tf maybe you wanted to go out to dinner or something? Strictly on me, of course." 
What true Notre Dame man would object to calling a girl names out loud? And if it was part of a movement, so much the better! 
The possibilities are infinite. Instead of the traditional spring 
paq' raid, why not have a bra burning over here on our campus? In 
the Huddle, the girls could paint out the Neanderthal man mural and 
replace it with pictures of some liberated women doing whatever 
they do. The Convo, the Rock, and the Burke Memorial Golf Course 
are all prime targets for liberation, not to mention the Dinin!~ Halls. 
We could have a Student Body President candidate running on the 
grass roots issue of women's lib. 
But like I said, I'm afraid it's up to the guys to get the thing going. 
I'd hate to see a beautiful spring go to pot.

Dreams: Like watching a birth 
by John Yurko 
Dreams: Before 
Barry Rogers (trombone): Hey, Doug, I'd like you to meet my cousin, who's m-f'ing musician. 
Doug Lubahn (bass): Yeah, how do y'do'! You from around here? 
Cousin (elfish, wire-rimmed, with four ltarps in his coat pockets,-a Minolta, and a Norelco cassette r~corder, smiling his teeth off): Yeah, well, yeah, I'm doin' a thing in Elkart, sorta. 
Lubahn: Yeah? 
Silence. Cousin goes away. Mike Breck­er bounces short runs off the mens' room door. 
Lubahn (as equipment gnomes test mikes): Man, this place has no sound at all. Bounce, bounce, bounce, look out, there goes a B-flat, whooshhhhh! 
Jeff Kent (guitar, organ, vocals): Doug, hey, I made a chord change in Celestial. ..I'm gonna hold D-minor at the "sun­shine" part, it's better, you know, don't worry, okay? 
Stomping around back stage. Look at the small crowd clustered in front, the smoke running to the ceiling. Nerves. 
Everybody: Let's go, let's go, what are they waiting for, etc. 
"Ladies and gentlemen ... Dreams ... etc" 
In reviews, there are two ways of approaching the problem, the first being an extension of the old Tiger Beat syndrome of breathless hypes and sex set-ups ("Win one of Keith's grooviest ascots!!!") that translates musically into "They played this song and it was fast and good and then they played this hit and it was not so fast and not so good," and so on in to history. The second approach entails trying to tell what the 

Stockade confinement is 
challenged by petition 
by Chris Cicconi 
A nationwide petition by the Richard Chase Defense Committee, is currently being circulated at Notre Dame. It is an attempt to get Richard Chase released from a U.S. Army stockade, and to improve the "inhuman stockade con­ditions." 
Richard Chase is an Army private at Fort llood, Texas. On December 20, I<169, he was convicted for refusing to participate in riot control training. He was given a dishonorable discharge and sentenced to two years at hard labor. The Federal District Court has dismissed the case, but there is an appeal pending in the Federal Circuit Court. Chase's lawyers, have declared an intention to pursue the case to the Supreme Court if ne.cessary. They also plan to present the case before the Military Board of Review. 
However, the Defense Committee feels that the efforts of Chase's lawyers are not enough. They are appealing for public support, since they consider this an issue affecting every American's basic rights. The committee states that "it is through the use of riot control that Gis are used to suppress people fighting for basic human rights just as they are used for that same purpose in Vietnam". 
The Chase supporters claim that GJ 's are used as a deterrent to Blacks, stu­dents, and those in opposition to the waf' in Vietnam. Port Hood troops were used in Chicago in 1968 after Martin Luther Kmg's assasination and during the Demo­cratic National Convention. According to the Defense Committee's circulated state­ment, "as more and more people become angered with the direction in which the 
U.S. is heading, Gls will be used more and more to suppress them". 
Chase stated that he refused to take part in any activities that would be used to "crush movements that he suuported". Three months before his courtmartial, Chase became involved in anti-Vietnam War and enlisted men's rights movements. He also wrote for the Fatigue Press, the Fortllood underground paper. 
Chase's supporters state two reasons why charges should be dropped against him. First, they claim that the Uniform Code of Military Justice---which only requires a two-thirds majority for convic­tion---is a "mockery of justice". Second, the defense was denied permis­sion to subpoena witnesses to testify about riot control. Included in this list of witnesses denied by Lt. Col. Hagen were Rennie Davis and Bobby Seale. 
An investigation is also being demand­ed of Chase's pre-trial confinement. He was placed in solitary confinement for thirty-one days, and reportedly was in­flicted with four beatings during this period. 
The Richard Chase Defence Committee hopes to amass widespread support. They urge all interested students and faculty 
members  to  sign  the  petition,  write  to  
their  Senator  or  Congressman,  and  to  
form a local committee.

group is, not what the group is about. ln other words, the difference between Hair and Uberation: A Rock Cantata. 
Dreams is to Blood, Sweat, and Tears as Liberation is to Hair. The first set­tight, too tight. No talk from the stage for about a half-hour. Lubahn is the keystone, and he is worried. He is either smiling and nodding or frowning at Kent, Cobham, and the horns. Most of the first set is frowns. The horns are playing, but they are still working long car rides and Whoppers out of their systems. Only Cobham and Kent are sweating. 
Even playing with miscellaneous per­cussion to turn the band around doesn't work. As the end nears, Cobham talks­about football. Disaster. He talks about Valpo-laughter. This song and they cook for a while, and then drum solo. Long, but the comparison with Baker (the necessary mark of rock drum compar­ison) ends there. Not that Cobham doesn't have the Baker-type ego, but technically, he is a superior rock drum­mer. You don't play for James and the Flames and Sam and Dave for three years and not understand the beat, even if it·is 6/4. He can cook, and Baker can't. During his solo, then, the principle was to show that It's got a beat, and you can dance to it, even though the time is 
somewhere off in jazz-land. There are cheers and much applause, and the band goes off smiling. "We'll be back!" Yeah. 
Dreams: Between 
Randy Brecker (trumpet): Yeah, my album on Solid State. No promotion, at all. It got so bad, like one day, they wanted me to record Theme from Mid­night Cowboy and the Theme from Popi, or Pepi, something. I made my album commercial, I thought, but they wanted this. Anyway, they set up a date and told me I had two days to record. I didn't show, and they cancelled the contract ... well, we haven't signed yet, our manage­ment is holding out for quite a bit, and we're just playing these weekend things, and making enough to get us through the week practicing in New York. We need some more time to really get together, y'know? 
Lubahn (left-handed bass): We spent just about all day hunting for a left handed bass. "I got one." A Fender Precision? "Yeah, right." Well, at least I found this thing. 
The Breckers are alumni of the Colle­giate 1azz Festival. Both remember. 
Dreams: Back. 

They get applause as they come on stage. They showed more in the first set than any "unknown" group has a right to show, but there is the bad taste of B, S, and T, and the crowd wants more. They get it. 
In the long piece, "Sweetheart Suite," Lubahn no longer directs. He concen­trates on playing. The horns are miked better, and they can hear themselves for 
the first time, so the harmonies are heard 
for the first time. And here is where the 
real power comes. 
In any group, the only one capable of 
leading naturally is the drummer. Cob­
ham comes through. In the piece, as it 
builds and builds, Cobham makes his 
breaks turn that band around, little by 
little, phrase after phrase, until imposed 
tightness falls away and an organic, nat­
ural, beautiful understanding of the music 
takes its place. The ultimate meaning of 
the cliche of "together." 
Only the best bands have it, the Dead, 
Miles, Chicago, to a certain extent. 
Dreams showed it Saturday night. Mike 
Brecker and Billy Cobham taking the 
band where a band, even of battle-scarred 
veterans, of only four months, has no 
right to go. 
A stoned high-schooler in the front 
row has had his mouth wide open for five 
minutes, while somebody else is shaking 
his hair in time. Everywhere the feet are 
moving, heads are bobbing. If it wasn't 
Notre Dame, there would have been 
dancing. Brecker's sax solo should be too 
long, but it is not, for with each bar, 
there is a hint of something new, some­
thing that is developed, easily, gradually, 
until it hits you that you haven't under­
stood it until now, but, man, you sure do 
understand now. 
The band comes back in and lets it 
come down, down, down, throwing in 
another drum solo that made me think 
they wanted to say "Yeah, we're good, 
but not that good ... yet. Just w<.~it." I· 
will. The end. Standing ovation. Encore. 
An embarrassment. They had played 
all the songs they knew. So they did a 
fast repeat and gave Jeff Kent his chance 
to solo on' the organ, to demonstrate 
obviously to those who hadn't been 
listening closely, what he had been doing 
all night, working with Lubahn to draw 
out rhythmic lines that first provided 
strong foundations for the strong (That's 
an understatement) solos of the horns, 
and, all by themselves, developed embel­
lishments on those lines that were beauti­
fully interesting and at the same time did 
nnt work against the main solo lines of 
the horns. 

.!(ent's organ, in other words, was subtle like Booker T.'s, not over-powering like Kooper's. You had to listen, but it sure was there. So was everybody else. Best concert here all year, you know. 
Randy (B, S, and T alumni): Yeah, that was one of our best sets so far. Sure would like to come back, y'know .. . "Ellis isn't coming to CJ Pas a judge" .. . "His band was ruined by Kooper" .. . yeah, I can see that. 
For once, an embryonic growth appeared at Notre Dame, instead of slick still-born millionaires. A band that is still moving, still finding, still imprvving, it's like watching a birth from the delivery room..Dreams delivers.

President of and for tile University 
The Chance Ilor -President system 
This is the fourth in a six part series in which members of the Nutting for President Committee expound their views on why they feel changes should be made in the existing structure of the university. -ed. 
Chancellor-President Structure: How it should work 
For this reason students and faculty have proposed changing the system into a Chancellor-President structure, thus giving the internal affairs of the university the equal representation and attention they deserve. The problem is not that Father Hesburgh has outlived his usefulness, but that his responsibili­ties as he sees them no longer corres­pond to the job of the university president-namely, the supervision and progress of the internal affairs of the campus itself. The Chancellor-Presi­dent system has proven effective in other univerisities where it (under that name and others) has been tried. Of course there are disadvantages in any administrative novelty. The most pop­ular complaint is that the duties of each officer are not clearly defined. The office of the President, thus con­
ceived, overlaps into the realm of what is now the concern of the Dean of Students or some Vice-President for the campus. At Indiana University, which has one general Chancellor and a president for each extension, the faculty complains of duplication in administrative red tape and functjons. And there is always the danger that a president selected or nominated by the Chancellor or the Chairman of the Board of Trustees will be only a mouthpiece for those who put him in office. 
Other universities have established the office of Ombudsman (literally, "grievance man") to integrate all the university services of internal affairs, but usually only with power to investi­gate and recommend in matters of student and campus policy. At schools like Berkeley, the Ombudsman has jurisdiction only to settle academic complaints, but in many of the other 20-some schools which have Ombuds­men his powers have _grown from approximately equal to the Dean of Students to a much larger and dyna­mic office. At San Jose State the Ombudsman is appointed by the Presi­dent and is responsible to him, but in other schools (Michigan State, for in­stance) his office is independent of the president and hence not subject to the president's will. His objectives are to hear individual grievances and·'suggest­ions and to detect patterns of com­plaints and possibilities in both acade­mic and non-academic areas. His realm does not extend into community poli­tics, fund-rl!ising, or public relations. 

Internal President 
In most instances, the office of the Ombudsman unfortunately does not have power to initiate changes or innovations but merely to suggest them. The situation at Notre Dame demands, however, initiation of an office to deal with internal affairs exclusively-in contact with the cam­pus and with power enough to respond to immediate camp!ls needs. The President, with powers and responsibil­ities limited enough for one man's energies but large enough to remain integral, would be elected by a tri-part­ite committee (at last, something for 
the University Forum to do!) and would be subject only to the Board of Trustees. His jurisdiction would be the internal affairs of the university, and he would presumably be liberated from external demands. The Chancell­or, not superior in authority to the President but freed from the responsi­bilities of running the university, could devote his time to the external de­mands now made on Father Hesburgh -the responsibilities of representing the university to the alumni and to the national boards and committees which 
now usurp over half of our President's time. 
Notre Dame needs a President of and for the university, with an orienta­tion towards her obvious internal needs and potentials. Within the pre­sent structure, too many demands on the person of the President make it impossible for him to fulfill that rune­tion, no matter how diligently he may try late at night. Differing sets of responsibilities for one man have re-suited in a schizophrenic office: "!'ecole, c'est moi." It is time that we dictated the role of the President, and that we in the university are represent­ed and consulted as we deserve. This can happen through the new definition 
of the office of the president and the establishment of a Chancellor-Presi­dent system, splitting the present auth­ority of the one President into two offices according to the already-exist­ing split between the internal and external functions of the university. Thus defined, the jobs could be ade­quately handled by two men, instead of half accomplished by one overwork­ed President.

original music by Professor Nonte Floyd, composer and member of the SMC music department. Mr. Floyd will disucss his own stylistic develop­ment, focusing on four of his works: a Piano Quintet (piano and string quartet), written in 1964, a Piano Quartet ( 1966), a theme and Variations for Or­chestra (1966), and his most recent work, a Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra ( 1969-70). Mr. Floyd's discussion will draw on the works of European composers Bartok and Hinde­meth and the americans Ives and Carter, and discuss their influence on his growth as an artist. 
Prof. Floyd comes from a highly musical family. He began composing on his own at age 6, and to date has written over 400 works. He has played with both orchestra groups and stage bands. After earning his B.A. from Oklahoma City University, where he won their composition competition four times, he received his M.A. from the Uni­versity of Oklahoma. He is cur­rently a Ph.D candidate at the Eastman School of Music. Some of his more prominent works have been performed by the Oklahoma City, Buffalo, East­man-Rochester, and Baltimore Symphony Orchestras. 
This is Prof. Floyd's second year at St. Mary's. He teaches the courses in composition, contemporary music; conducting and arranging, and music theory. 
The final two events on Monday night will focus on modern dance. Judy DeVleigher will present two numbers, one from "West Side Story," the other from "Cabaret." Miss DeVleigher, an SMC senior, has background in ballet and mod­ern jazz, and has danced in several musicals. 
Anton Balcomb, a graduate student in Art, will dance in a contrasting free-style form. His numbers are described as "inter­pretive dances with flute accom­paniment." They are a series of delicate, almost improvisational interpretation of recorder music, emphasizing the closeness and spontaneous flow between the artist and his music. 
Tuesday's presentation is en­titled "Firewater with Words" and highlights four student pro­ductions. 
Meagon Te~ 1's off-Broadway play, ·"Keep tightly Closed in a Cool, Dry Place," opens the festivaties at 8 pm. Warren Bowles has coordinated the Notre Dame production. This will be followed at 9: 15 by excerpts from Murray Schisgal's existential farce, "Luv," pre­sen ted by Michael Kelly, George Moore and Larry Russick. The players characterize the play as "one that raises all the time­worn questions and answers them for good."

Irish sweep CC on 3rd period rallies 
by Don Kennedy 
Observer Sports Writer 
Lefty Smith's boys swept a pair of thrillers this past week­end from the Tigers of Colorado College, coming from two goals behind on both occasions to win by scores of 6-4 and 5-4. The Irish record now stands at 19-8-l with two games left with the Air Force Academy to break the 20-win mark. 
Colorado jumped to an early lead in Friday's contest, as Dale Yutsyk took a Jerry O'Connor pass and beat Tomasoni on his glove side. Junior defenseman Paul O'Neil squared things for the Irish at 9:32 of the first period with his first goal of the season, a hard slap shot into the lower left corner. But with the Irish short a man and the de­fense doing a lackluster job of backchecking, O'Connor picked up another point with his twelfth goal. of the season to make it 2-1 at the close of the period. 
After a first period of good fundamental hocky, both tt;.ams seemed more concerned with trying to out "physical" each other. What it turned out to be, however, was a battle for possession of the penalty box, as a total of 38 minutes in viola­tions were doled out over the next forty minutes of play. Some were not satisfied with only one trip to the sin-bin. CC's Yutsyk visited on three different

When your key man is injur­ed, it seldom helps you to win the event, but the Notre Dame track team got a break this past Saturday and defeated Miami of Ohio, 77-62. 
When the word that Irish long and triple jumper Mike McMan­
non would not compete due to an injured ankle got around the visitors' Milan Tiff, he decided that the competition wasn't worth the trip and so stayed home. Watching from the side­lines, Mike said that Tiff would have easily broken Mike's own Convo record in the Triple Jump. 
With Tiff (one of the nation's best) absent, little Kevin Mc­Auliffe came up with his career best in the Triple Jump, winning with a leap of 46-9. The sopho­more from Syracuse also won the Long Jump. Mike's younger brother Tom McMannon took third in both events. 
N D's stellar middle distance man, Rich Wohlhuter, zed to wins in the 440 and 880-yard runs as Mike McCann took sec­ond in the latter event. Earlier, McCann had opened the running events by winning the Mile run in 4:12.

But just when it seemed the game was headed for a ten-minute overtime period, defenseman O'Neil, who had an excellent series of hockey, poke checked an onrushing Tiger wing and hit John Noble with a clean pass

·uo fell behind. Dayton built their lead up to as much as 16 pts. during the first half. They did this mainly on the strength of Kenny May's outside shooting and George Janky's rebounding. At the half May had 18 pts. (26 for the game) and Janky had 10 rebounds and 15 pts. (22 rbds. and 25 for the game). 

UD led 49-38 at intermission and NO was lucky to be that close. Pat Murnen, a 6' 5" guard, did an excellent job of defensing Austin Carr. He held Carr to 12 pts. and more important a mea­ger 4 of 12 from the field. 
The Flyers outshot NO at the half, 52.7% to 37.5% and out­rebounded them by a 33-16 margin. The consistent play of Collis Jones kept the Irish in the contest and a brief moment of brilliance by the entire squad before the end of the period brought the Irish to within II.

Carr and Jones outscored Dayton's two high men, Janky and May by a 55-51 count. The difference came in Gottschall's 18 pts. 
Another big factor was the team rebounding. The Flyers managed to jump off their Tar­tan surface floor high enough to outrebound NO 60-45. No one

The Irish showed a definite lack of bench strength in this game. It seemed that no one could spark the team when it needed help most. Of course Mike O'Connel's ankle sprain kept him out of action and he may have been able to get the ball to Austin. 
This loss can be viewed in two ways. First, the loss takes away a great deal from the excelknl momentum that the Irish had built over the last nine games. There is a bright way of looking at the situation, also. Perhaps the Irish got that "bad g<Jme" out of their system and they might be ready to play the grade of bllll that they are cupable of playing. They can forget about this game and look forward to meeting Ohio U. with a definite positive attitude.
