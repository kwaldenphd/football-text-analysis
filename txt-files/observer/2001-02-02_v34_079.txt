Living in a climate of change 
Homosexual members of the Notre Dame community agree that although progress is slow, the University is becoming more welcoming 
By ERIN PIROUTEK 
Associate News Editor 
Ever since the University denied Gays and Lesbians of Notre Dame the right to meet on campus in 1993. the struggle for recognition by homosexual student groups has fueled public debate, most recently when OutreachND was denied recognition in April 2000. 
But while not as well publicized, the more prevalent struggle is that of individual Notre Dame students, those who deal every day with being homosexual in a predominantly heterosexual culture. 
A change in campus atmosphere is impossible to measure, but members of Notre Dame's gay and les­bian community agree that Notre Dame is becoming a more welcoming place. 
"It's much better here [now] than when I came here," said Outreach cochair Dave Wyncott. Fellow co-chair Molly Morin echoed Wyncott's senti­ments. 
"In my personal experience, students seem to be more open and aware to what's going on with gay stu­dents," she said. 
Reasons for the changes include a more visible gay and lesbian community, improved efforts by the University to create a more welcoming environment

Becoming them 
Few things in life are guaranteed. Just as Fox's "World's Meanest Animals" appears on your TV, the remote is nowhere to be found. The very last seat in class is the one next to the kid who smells like he's been at a bar all morn­
ing. 
And one day, whether we're prepared for it or not, we become our par­ents. 
What we don't realize, though, is that this isn't necessarily a bad thing. 
The realization is seldom happy and always sudden. It hits us when we least expect it -when we laugh at a Democrat joke or say "slacks" when we mean pants. It rocks our world and, guaranteed, it freaks us out. 
And it often comes in the

nicest of compliments that we take to be the cruelest insults. 
I used to hate it when the old ladies from church would come up to me and tell me I must be Patricia's daughter. "It's your eyes ... your smile ... your sick sense of humor... (rm told for that, my grandfather would be proud). 
Now I see it almost every day. I recognize my mother in every sarcastic joke I dish out. I real­ize it whenever I spot a new white streak high­lighting my hair. 
I remember as a little girl thinking that when my parents turned 50 they might as well be turning 100. At a time when I figured I'd be married with children at 22, 50 seemed ancient and further away than I could possibly imag­ine. 
Today, as my mother hits the much talked­about age, I realize that 50 is just as important to me as it is to my parents. 
Llke many of my senior classmates, now is the most confusing time of my life. What will I do? Where will I live? Which bill will I dodge first? 
More than any other time in my life, I now need my parents. Without their help or guid­ance I might not know how to start paying school loans. I might not get the extra push I need to find a good job. Hell, I might end up working back at Indiana's largest Amoco gas station like I did a few summers ago. 
Now is a time when Ijust need an old church lady to tap me on my shoulder and remind me that I'm Pat's girl. Or -and I can't believe I admit it -for me to get in a political debate with my dad and know that I'm that passionate because of him. 
It's a time when my parents can be proud of how they have shaped me and my life experi­ences; when they can see them&elves in how I deal with problems. answer the phone or but­ter my bread. 
That 50 means that both my parents have hit the "milestone," and that I need the assurance that yes. I AM becoming them and that I'll turn out okay like they did. It's a time when they can see me becoming -well, them. 
So if someone comments that you're begin­ning to walk, talk or act just like your mother, don't fret. 
If an older woman you don't recognize approaches you and says, "Are you 'so-and-so's daughter? You look just like her," don't assume you've aged 30 years. 
Turn, smile and say "thank you." 
Thank you, Mom, and Happy Birthday.

Oklahoma State remembers crash victims 
NORMAN, Okla. 

Oklahoma State University hon­ored 10 men associated with the school's basketball team who lost their lives in a plane crash Saturday night. 
Thousands began quietly filling Gallagher-Iba Arena shortly after 2 
p.m. Wednesday. Most faces were either expressionless or buried in their hands as they waited for the ceremony to begin. 
The front of the stage was lined with portraits of the 10 who died, and their families were seated in a special section facing them. 
Terry Don Phillips, director of OSU athletics, opened the ceremony by having a moment of reflection for the victims. He then announced plans to dedicate a memorial to them inside

Kelly Ogle worked with OSU announcer Bill Teegins, who died in the crash. He shared memories of him and brought a smile to many in the arena. 
..He loved OSU, he didn't want any­one to know it, but he told me many times he would have done the games for free," Ogle said. 
OSU basketball head coach Eddie Sutton said Teegins was the most 
humble sportscaster he had ever known. 
Sutton received a standing ovation by the crowd and the only applause of the afternoon. 
OSU student Stephanie Hodges said the memorial service was what the students needed right now. 
"Now that we've been able to come together, the healing process can start," Hodges said. 
Even Eskimo Joe's, a place OSU vice president Harry Birdwell said was not known for its religious music, experienced a moment of prayer when the band began to play "Amazing Grace."

Police question suspect student 
HANOVER. N.H. 
A Dartmouth junior says that the police consider him a "prime suspect" but that he is completely innocent of all allegations and was not in any way involved in the Saturday afternoon murders of Susanne and Half Zantop. The student. who spoke under the condition of anonymity, told The Dartmouth in an interview early Thursday morning that the police's investigation into his involvement is "a bunch of baloney." The student said that two police officers came to his dormitory room Monday evening and questioned him for approximately an hour. They then requested that he come with them to the Hanover police station and record his statement offi­cially. The police also confiscated several items of cloth ing and footwear and a kitchen knife that the student said he used for "cutting cheese and ham." The police declined to comment on possible suspects, but the stu­dent said he does not believe he is the only suspect. The student said he was interrogated for about four hours Tuesday night.

Chilean diplomat addresses future of Pinochet, democracy 
. Former Chilean dictator could face trial, house arrest 
By ANDREW THAGARD News Writer 
The socialist Chilean ambas­sador to the United States spoke about the house arrest and pos­sible trial of former Chilean dic­tator Augusto Pinochet in a lec­ture Thursday night. 
"Human rights violations was a characteristic of the Pinochet regime. I don't think that there is anybody in Chile that didn't feel a deep sense of satisfaction when Pinochet was detained. Arrogance was being pun­ished," explained Juan Gabriel Valdes to a nearly full auditori­um of professors, students and members of the community. 
Valdes offered his views on recent news surrounding the former dictator and lifelong senator as well as his nation's transition to democracy. 
"Extraordinary events have taken place in the last few weeks," Valdes said in refer­ence to Pinochet's house arrest and possibility of standing trial on charges of homicide and kid­napping. 
Valdes attributes the current progress in addressing past human rights violations to insti­tutional and political changes that have taken place within the government. 
"The military dictatorship left a structure that inhibited a move toward democracy. 
Legislative policies prohibited passing laws and the armed forces had the same input as the other three branches of government," Valdes said. 
Additionally, Pinochet remained commander-in-chief of the army for another seven years and became a senator for life. The justices he appointed to the supreme court continued to retain their positions throughout the 1990's. 
"We thought that democracy would become the 'only game in town' if only we could elimi­nate the constitution. We have now been able to change the institutions of Pinochet [instead!," said Valdes. 
Now, the government is able to move on with the passage of laws replacing many of Pinochet's judges with a group of human rights enthusiasts, and the former dictator's retire­ment from the armed forces has brought the first accusa­tions against him by the mili­tary. 
Despite these advances, how­ever, Valdes would still like to see the establishment of a new constitution. 
"I believe that we should face the task of a new constitution. I also have to accept that these institutions [remaining from the Pinochet era} do not threaten the democratic government," Valdes said. 
Valdes also addressed the concern among many outsiders that Chile's democratic govern­ment is inefficient and the nation's decision to try Pinochet in Chile instead of by an international court for human rights violations. 
Most outsiders "have never understood the power of the Chilean right. This has led many people abroad to blame vacillations on democracy rather than the [far] right. They could never understand what it was like to govern a country where businesses and the media were against you because you were against Pinochet," Valdes said. 
Valdes also defended his nation's decision to pursue legal action against Pinochet domestically rather than on an international level in Madrid. 
"We were concerned that a trial in Madrid would have been an international justice but not a Chilean justice," Valdes said. 
He emphasized that it is important for Chile not only to work toward the future, but also come to grips with their past. 
"The right looks at Pinochet as a hero from Marxism while the left is upset about injustices under him," Valdes said. 
He is confidant that justice against human rights violations will be achieved but said that achieving it would take time, citing that some investigations have taken up to six years. 
"Justice is very slow. I think it's not only slow in Chile but everywhere," Valdes said. 
The unanticipated crowd that gathered to hear Valdes speak forced organizers to relocate the lecture from a Hesburgh Center conference room to the building's main auditorium.

and a greater acceptance of homosexuality nationwide. 
"Society in general is chang­ing. Notre Dame is slowly lag­ging behind, but it is chang­ing," said Wyncott. 
As more students know someone who's gay or lesbian, homosexuality becomes more than an abstract concept. 
"When it has a personal face -that's when hearts are changed and attitudes are developed," said Keough Hall rector Father Tom Doyle, who works with gay and lesbian students through Campus Ministry. 
"I think there's been an increase in gay students living openly, which teaches students in their dorms, in their classes about tolerance in a very per­sonal way," said Morin. 
Better support is likely a rea­son more students feel com­fortable enough to be open about their sexuality. Morin noted that groups such as Outreach allow gay students to come together and gain sup­port that they cam bring back to a larger community at Notre Dame.

OutreachND co-chair
T h e University does not recognize sexual ori­entation in its non-discrimina­tion clause, which disturbs many members of the commu­nity. Yet the steps towards the ideals of "The Spirit of Inclusion" cannot be ignored. 
Campus Ministry has helped take some of these steps by promoting initiatives such as designating last Nov. 5 as Solidarity Sunday. The purpose was to challenge the Notre Dame community to be a place where all, including gays and lesbians. are accepted and loved for who they are. Each priest on campus received a packet of information about welcoming and inclusion. In collaboration with Outreach. cards with a unity prayer and a rainbow pin were distributed after all campus Masses. 
Campus Ministry has also sponsored an annual retreat for gays, lesbians, questioning students and their friends which has grown in popularity. Nearly 40 people attended the last retreat in November. and Campus Ministry is considering offering another retreat this semester. · 
"It was a wonderful weekend to watch people who are homo­sexual feel like they are totally at home," said Doyle. "You can literally watch the tension and pressure drop from people's faces. 
Additionally. in 1996 the University established the "Standing Committee on Gay and Lesbian Student Needs." According to its mission state­ment, the group works on ..identifying the ongoing needs of gay and lesbian students" and "assist[ing] in the imple­mentation of campus-wide edu­cational programming on gay and lesbian issues," as well as fostering continued dialogue. Students, faculty and adminis­trators serve on the committee, and at least half of the mem­bers are gay or lesbian.

"Three very angry men piled out." 
The men, who also had been drinking began to intimidate the couple, Wyncott said. 
"They were trying to decide 'what to do with the fags,"' said Wyncott. The harassment stopped when the designated driver yelled out the window to "leave the fags alone" and the vehicle drove away. 
Wyncott notes that incidents like this aren't common. 
..The average Notre Dame student is very respectful," he said. But even when prejudice occurs in mild forms, such as derogatory messages in the dorm on wipe-off boards, it still hurts. 
..Gay students do not feel safe here entirely. Or it takes them a long time to feel safe." said Morin. 
Still, the positive changes towards a more welcoming attitude towards gays and les­bians give cause for optimism about the future. 
"It's much more like the movement of a glacier than a lightning bolt through the sky." said Doyle. "But it is progress."

KOSOVSKA MITROVICA 
NATO-led peacekeepers talked some ethnic Albanian crowds into dis­persing on Thursday and fired tear gas and stun grenades at others rioting near a base used by French soldiers in this tense Kosovo city. 
As confrontations in Kosovska Mitrovica went into their fourth straight d_ay, NATO's top general in· Kosovo and the province's chief U.N. administrator met with local leaders in efforts to end the violence. 
The violence ended by nightfall. Lt. Gen. Carlo Cabigiosu and U.N. admin­istrator Hans Haekkerup condemned the unrest, in a joint statement urging "all citizens to remain calm and refrain from further acts of violence." 
The statement, also signed by the city's ethnic Albanian leaders, said there was a need for more troops and police in the city; the extension of a so-called confidence zone set up nearly a year ago on both sides of the main bridge separating its Serb and eth­nic Albanian communities; and creating conditions for freedom of movement and the return of displaced fam­ilies. 
"We will use all forces we have available to increase our presence on the ground," Cabigiosu told reporters. The Italian gen­eral, the commander of the NATO-led Kosovo peace force, pledged that his troops would continue using restraint, adding: "We will not start a war here." 
NATO's secretary gener­al, Lord Robertson, used tougher language, telling reporters in Oslo, Norway, that peacekeepers in Kosovska Mitrovica would "continue to be robust with those who seek to challenge law and order." 
In Budapest, Hungary, Adm. James Ellis, comman­der in chief of NATO in southern Europe, also con­demned the violence, "directed against the very forces that were introduced to preserve the well-being of both parties in the Kosovo conflict." 
The industrial city has been rocked by unrest since Monday, when a 15-year­cld ethnic Albanian was killed in a grenade attack. 
On Wednesday, demon­strators throwing rocks and fire bombs injured 21. peacekeepers. Most, if not all, appeared to be French. 
Several people were injured Thursday, including a photographer for the Reuters news agency.

Police catch 6 escaped Alabama prisoners 
Associated Press 
DICKSON, Tenn. 

Six escaped convicts from Alabama were captured in Tennessee on Thursday, two days after they broke out of a maximum-security prison by using a broom handle to lift an electrified fence. 
Authorities stumbled onto the group along a country road about 50 miles west of Nashville and 165 miles from the prison. They scattered and were caught without violence over an eight-hour span.

and their escape prompted residents across the region to lock their doors. A robbery at an RV park in Floyd County, Ga., was attributed to one fugutive earlier, but authorities said Thursday afternoon that the crime was not committed by the Alabama convicts. 
The six stopped at a gas sta­tion Wednesday evening not far from where they were found. Three went inside and bought six bologna sandwich­es, beer, toothpaste, tooth­brushes and shampoo, authori­ties said.

The deputies called for help and caught the first three inmates around 6 a.m. with the help of a tracking dog. 
"We ordered them to give up and they came out unarmed," police officer Bryan Johnson said. "We said, '\.'Vho are you?' And, they said, 'You know who we are."' 
Two more convicts were found within an hour. Gary Scott eluded authorities for another 6 1/2 hours before two residents spotted him crouched under a bridge. 
"We told an FBI agent, went down the road a little piece and turned around, and by the time we got there, there were three state highway patrol cars 
hearing was set for Tuesday, and they will be housed at the Metro Nashville Jail at least until then. 
The inmates escaped Tuesday by slipping beneath an electric fence and two razor-wire fences at Alabama's St. Clair Correctional Facility, northeast of Birmingham, before guards noticed they were gone. 
Prison commissioner Mike Haley has blamed the escape on a manpower shortage and faulty security. including an alarm system that didn't go off. 
Captured were McClain, 35; Scott, 31; Billy Gamble, 24; Steve Murphy, 45; O.C. Borden, 33; and Jack Allred, 43. 
Scott, Murphy and Borden were serving life sentences for murder. 
Murphy is also credited with making the only other success­ful escape from the Alabama prison, in 1984. He and anoth­er man used a hacksaw to cut through metal bars and then crawled 100 yards through a drainage pipe to freedom. Murphy was recaptured about 2 1/2 months later. 
Historic railway cars crash in L.A. 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES 

Two cars on a historic cable railway in downtown Los Angeles collided Thursday. injuring eight people, three of them critically, authorities said. 
The cable for the Angels Flight car at the top of Bunker Hill apparently broke, sending it crashing into the other wood­en car, Fire Chief William Bamattre said. 
"It usually goes about 2 mph, it must have been going 30," said Isis Burkholder, who was working in a coffee stand across the street when the car came hurtling down the track. "It sounded like a building fell down." 
It was unclear whether the ride had actually started. 
The oragne-and-black cars normally move in opposite directions from stations at the top and bottom of the hill. One heads down the hill as the other one heads up. They pass each other in the middle of the slope where the tracks sepa­rate widely. 
The noontime collision occurred near the bottom of the tiny railway. 
Construction worker Richard Romero, who was eating lunch nearby, ran up the tracks to rescue an injured man who "flew out" of the lower car.

administration's reasons for not allowing the play to take place at the College this year. 
Although Eldred said she saw the performance of "The Vagina Monologues" last year on cam­pus, she declined to give her opinion of the play. 
"Yes, I did see [The Vagina Monologues]." she said. "However, sometimes when you are in a position of responsibility you have to set aside personal views and do what is best for the organization. My view is that what I think is best for Saint Mary's College is not to have the play performed on campus this year." ­
In place of the "Monologues," Eldred suggested more inclusive programming regarding sexuali­ty and violence against women. 
"We have continued to say that we don't feel that there is a need to do the play again this year," said Eldred. "We talked about creating more programming to meet the needs of more stu­dents." 
This kind of programming would involve a panel discussion or bringing speakers to campus representing a wide range of opinions on issues of sexuality, said Koelsch. 
However. Koelsch said CARE already sponsors such program­ming efforts throughout the year on campus. 
"I think there was a misunder­standing between CARE and the administration about inclusive­ness," said Koelsch. "We pointed out to them that we already have those other programming but 'The Vagina Monologues' was a different way to talk about things and even if we had it last year. there will always be someone new on campus who could bene­fit from seeing it." 
CARE board member Katie 
Poynter agreed. She added that 
lectures and panels do not draw 
crowds the way the monologues 
did last year, when an estimated 
350 people attended perfor­
mances. 
"The administration is saying 
that we should do other pro­
gramming in place, of 'The 
Vagina Monologues,' so if the 
administration thinks they can 
put together a panel that brings

Clinton heads back into limelight 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

Out of the nation's sight for all of two weeks, Bill Clinton is back. He's got two speeches in Florida, something to say to Israelis as 
they get ready to vote and a possible trip to Hong Kong for a conference. 
"Someone needs to 


send him a Clinton m e m o reminding him that he's no longer president," conservative critic L. Brent Bozell III snapped Thursday. 
But Clinton spokesman Jake Siewert said the ex-president is merely following the lead of his predecessors in hitting the lucrative lecture circuit. 
"He has hundreds of speak­ing requests," Siewert said. "Like any former president, Clinton will give speeches from time to time, press interviews from time to time. 
"I don't think the American people would expect anything different." 
On Monday, Clinton is to speak at a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter convention in Boca Haton, Fla. The topic had not been decided. The fee is about $100,000, according to sources familiar with the speaking arrangements. 
On Feb. 10, Clinton will give a speech, likely focused on the Middle East, at a synagogue in Aventura, Fla. near Miami. The sources would not disclose the fee. 
Clinton did his first post­presidency interview Thursday, talking 30 minutes with an Israeli TV station at his home in Chappaqua, N.Y. His remarks are to be shown Friday, just four days before Israel's election that is expect­ed to determine the direction of Middle East peace talks. 
Siewert said Clinton is not meddling in U.S.-Mideast poli­cy. Instead, he said, "The inter­view looked back on his role in

the process and the lessons he drew from that about how to bring peace to the Mideast." 
Clinton may even return to Washington soon, although not by his own initiative. 
Republican Sen. Arlen Specter, H-Pa., who started a Judiciary Committee hearing on Clinton's pardon of fugitive multimillionaire Marc Rich, said Clinton may be called before the panel. 
Former Vice President Al Gore, Bush's rival in the cam­paign, also is coming back into view, with a speech Monday to a health care conference in New York. His fee was not dis­closed. 
Clinton's re-emergence fol­lows his slow-motion exit from the presidency, one that irritat­ed Republican critics who said he was crowding in on Bush's big moment. 
Following a farewell address to the nation his last week in office. Clinton spoke on Inauguration Day at a rally at Andrews Air Force Base and then welcoming rallies in New York City and Chappaqua. 
"He lusts for the spotlight," said Bozell, president of the Media Research Center, a conservative media-watch­dog group. 
But there's nothing new about ex-presidents airing their views for cash. 
When Ronald Reagan went to Asia in 1989. the year he left office, a Japanese media conglomerate paid him $2 million for two 20-minute speeches. He gave other talks for about $60,000 each. 
Bush's father charged an estimated $100,000 for trips abroad, and he charged about $80,000 for speeches in the United States after he was president.

Bush unveils plan to aid religious agencies

In separate events, Bush capped a weeklong campaign designed to reach out to moder­ate voters. Advisers say the president will turn next week to another challenge: promoting tax cuts by trying to show they would benefit families, small businesses, the high-tech indus­try and the sluggish economy. He plans to submit the package to Congress late

The line drew a huge round of applause. 
Mindful of critics. Bush said his proposal was not an effort to impose religion on anybody. "An American president serves people of every faith, and serves some with no faith at all." he said. 
Bush, a Methodist, quoted scripture and said religion was important in his life, just as President Clinton and several of his predecessors have done. Clinton used the 1998 gathering to apologize for his affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
Later, Bush filled up the East Room to discuss a series of pro­posals to help disabled Americans. They include:

Increase spending for research and development. 

.

If Board members are truly committed to the future of this University, it doesn't seem unreasonable for the Board to meet on campus twice a year.

game aired on ABC.

Where was the sense of outrage from Notre Dame as they raked in the televi­sion proceeds? Many find it amusing that ND football games will not accept spon­sorship from alcohol manufacturers while drunken slobs carry open contain­ers throughout the campus during Saturday afternoons. 
Don't get me wrong, I was one of those drunken slobs in my youth. However, it is difficult for me to explain to my Georgetown friends how commercial money in the Big East differs with that of the independent NBC football contract. 
Today, Punxsutawney Phil will express his outrage at the Georgia "copy ground­hog" who is attempting to "overshadow" Phil. And just recently, the Bush Administration expressed moral outrage for all the Clinton staff pranks prior to their departures from the White House. Morality usually has different meanings to different folks. 
History has shown that almost every presidential administration during mod­ern times expresses frustration at being succeeded by an administration of the opposite party. 
The issue resurfaced last week when Bush officials moving into their offices found that the "W" key had been popped off of many computer keyboards. George Walker Bush had made a three-fingered "W" his signature salute in the waning days of his campaign, and the keyboard incident was portrayed as hijinks on talk shows and in news accounts. 
Clinton administration officials con­firmed that pranks were played on the incoming Republicans, but contended that nothing malicious had been intend ed. The Democratic officials said the actions were meant to be funny, or in some cases were an outlet for frustration by soon-to-be-unemployed staffers. 
But a little tomfoolery is typical in tran­sitions between presidents. On the day Gerald Ford left Washington, his /, staff ground peanut shells into the 
rug of Air Force One ... like Jimmy Carter was personally going to clean it! Carter staff took pizza and ran along the halls of the Old Executive Office Building smearing tomato sauce along the walls for the Reagan staff to enjoy. 
Incoming administrations often accuse their predeces­sors of trying to make life difficult. In 1993, some Clinton officials cried foul when they found hard drives missing from their computers. 
but they turned out to have been \ seized by an independent prosecu­tor looking into the Bush administra­tion's use of passport files. 
However, Clinton administration offi­cials found numerous "Bush-Quayle" stickers plastered on desks when they moved into the White House. Some main­tained that phones and computers had been disabled. 
In defense of the departing Clintonites' deeds. some Democrats say that this year's mischief pales in comparison to what Clinton and Gore staffers encoun­tered eight years ago. They say that office closets were locked shut and keys thrown away, almost all office supplies were stolen or discarded and scrawled signs contained greetings like, "Welcome you [expletive] draft dodger!" and "Go [exple-

Clinton and Gore officials admitted to having left official-looking signs on oflice doors that said roughly, "Office of Strategerie" (a reference to a "Saturday Night Live" spoof of Bush), "Office of Subliminable Messages" (another refer­ence to Bush malapropisms) and "Division of Uniting." Another sign with the words "Office of Communications" acquired the eversoslight hint of the word "RATS" in the background. The Office of Management and Budget was recast as the "Office of Management and Fudgit." 
Vice President Dick Cheney's wife, Lynne, was welcomed with the plac­ard "Office of Uniter-Divider Division." One room within the&ia Council of Economic Advisors' 
~ suite of offices became the "Council of Economic Advisors -Fuzzy Math Division." 
Republicans even play pranks on other Republicans. When Virginia Governor

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Contradictions span right and left 
I write in response to Wednesday's column by James Seaman, entitled "Leaders of America's Left Fall to Flaws." Upon reading this piece I was left wondering: Why don't, why haven't, the leaders of America's right similarly fallen to flaws? 
Reflect upon the Reagan-Bush legacy of illegal involvement in Central America, covert drug and gun deals, the destructive crazi­ness of Star Wars. etc. 
What was the Gulf War about anyway? Liberating Kuwait? How many Iraqi children died and continue to die as a result of our bombings (initiated, it is fair to say, by President Clinton as well as President Bush)? 
Powell, Cheney, et. al., all the brave warriors who sat in their plush offices and orchestrated the rape and pillage of third world countries so that our 5 percent of the population could continue to consume close to 40 percent of the world's resources, whose repression of accurate information and reporting during the Gulf War still shames those of us who believe in the First Amendment. Why do we feel so lucky, so safe, to have these men back in charge? 
As for George W. Bush, this is a man who presided, as Governor of Texas, in what will long be remembered as one of the most shameless systems of state execution in the developed world. We're not just speaking about capital punishment here, bad enough as it is (in the eyes of the Vatican), but the archaic Texas system of administering that punishment. Why is our new President Bush thought of as the man who will restore decency to our country? 
In short, the Seaman piece compels me to ask another, but relat­ed (and somehow silenced) question beyond that of the authors: Why are Reagan, Bush and Bush and their henchmen still celebrat­ed as unfallen leaders? 
What Jesse Jackson did was wrong. Just as wrong, by the way, as what Newt Gingrich, Bob Livingston and Henry Hyde did. And per­haps whatever else George W. Bush did (he won't tell us) before he found religion. 
But I also struggle to think well of our country's future as long as the "more public" evils of Ronald Reagan and the Bushes are ignored, or somehow take second stage to the relatively private evils of Livingston, Gingerich, Hyde and Jackson. 
Jesse Jackson, following his mentor Martin Luther King, has done more good for the poor and oppressed in our country than Reagan or the Bushes could possibly imagine. If Republicans can welcome people like Ollie North back into their good graces (for what? sub­verting the Constitution?), I imagine that we "leftists" will find our way toward forgiving Mr. Jackson and continuing to work with him towards "the promised land" that he and Mr. King have devoted their lives towards making possible.

ND Security Police not doing its job 
Just in case you missed the small article tucked neatly back on page 9 of Thursday's Observer, I feel I should I mention it. I was dis­heartened to read of another sexual assault on the Notre Dame cam­pus. It is truly horrifying to read of such acts occurring anywhere, especially our home. 
I'm not going to speculate as to the "unexplained reason" this crime somehow fell through the cracks and went unreported by Campus Security for nearly three months. I can, however, conclude that this oversight is definitely not a good example of what DuLac boasts on page 44: "IThe Notre Dame Security Police Department] is a service organization whose product is safety. We succeed by pro­viding services in a manner that exceeds expectations." 
Service, safety, succeed, expectations. Did we miss anything? Not reporting a sexual assault that occurred on Nov. 3 until Jan. 22 is certainly not providing "services" in the "compassionate manner" it promises in DuLac. 
Nor is assuming that an assault by an acquaintance does not "[pose] a threat" to the Notre Dame community. I don't think I have to remind a security organization of "well trained individuals who work as a team" that between 70 and 80 percent of all rapes are perpetrated by an acquaintance. 
If this was simply an honest mistake, Campus Security, then take responsibility for it. You owe an apology to the survivor and to the student body who have relied on you to "promote a safe and well ordered environment."

Responding to dissolution of Belles' track team 
Fighting to keep track at the College 
We are writing as a team to respond to the termination of the track and field program at Saint Mary's. We feel that this measure is a sig­nificant step back in the progress our Athletic Department promotes. 
The Saint Mary's community is rooted deeply in its tradition, and that is part of what we love about our school. Track and field was one of the building blocks on which our present athletic program was founded. We believe it is important that the Athletic Department. as well as the whole community including administration, fel­low students and alumnae, acknowledge the tra­dition of Saint Mary's women participating in track and field events. 
We also feel that by taking away the Track and Field program, Saint Mary's is not adhering to its mission statement which proclaims, "dedi· cated to the personal and social growth of its students, Saint Mary's cultivates a community life which responds to the needs of women and cherishes their talents." 
Our team has much talent and determination. At Saint Mary's, we are encouraged to be lead­ers and strive to make a difference. Track and Field has given us the opportunity to persevere and challenge ourselves to live out the mission of' the College. Terminating the track and field pro­gram based on a little financial difficulty sends all women at Saint Mary's quite a contrary mes­sage. 
We have decided to do all we can to save our program. We will not let our program die due to lack of money. We plan to continue competing at the varsity level for this season while trying to find the funds necessary for the track and field team to remain as a varsity sport on Saint Mary's campus. We encourage any feedback or support to help us reach our goal. 
Saint Mary's Track and Field Tearn 
February l, 200 l 


Tuesday's controversial decision to elimi­nate the track and field program at Saint Mary's College was one that was undertaken in a hasty and sudden manner. Saint Mary's College President Marilou Eldred gave her not so popular final answer to cut the program after receiving the recommendation of athletic director Lynn Kachmarik. It is obvious to me that neither put much thought into the process. 
The individuals who made this bold decision apparently had some second thoughts of their own considering they did not inform team members of even the possibility, let alone the final decision to, terminate the program at season's end. I would like to make several points as to why the track and field program should be kept running, no pun intended. 
First, track and field is an activity which individuals compete in because they love it. It is not easy, practices are not fun and the sport enjoys little fanfare from outsiders. The point is that those who stay with the sport love it deeply and to take away that extracurricular option for current team members at Saint Mary's is wrong. It does much more than take away one activity from the day, it takes away a big part of who each team member is. 
Secondly, financial concerns were given as the primary reason for cutting the program. It was estimated that the school could save $13,000 by cutting the program, and this money could be allotted to other sports. I know Rick Pitino is available. but I am guess­ing he needs more than five figures to make him the new Belles basketball coach. In short, $13,000 is not enough to make a significant difference in the sports program at Saint Mary's College. 
Track and field is the largest high school participatory sport in America, and Saint Mary's can use it as a recruiting tool for ath­letes who may not have the chance to run at a Division I school, but can come and compete in the sport they love at the Division III level. l think it would be in Saint Mary's best interest to diversify the number of sports they have to offer, rather than to specialize in only a few. 
Third, how can anyone expect head coach Larry Szczcho to motivate his runners for the upcoming campaign. With no future to work towards, with each meet meaning the team is closer and closer to the end, how can any coach be expected to produce great results, and how can the athletes create the usual feeling of optimism heading into a season? The will to compete, a big part of the sport, will be lost. 
Finally, adequate practice space was addressed. Saint Mary's has long jump, high jump, shot put and discus areas on campus. I am an assistant track and field coach at South Bend's Saint Joseph's High School, and we have allowed the Belles track team use of our facilities during the season. The one mile jog down to the track is like a stroll to the dining hall for these athletes, so distance can not be a concern. 
A new facility may not be feasible, but cut­ting a sport altogether is not the answer. This shocking decision was done without a careful look into the future, without any input from the student-athletes effected by it and with financial considerations taking top order. 
In my opinion. it is in the best interest of Saint Mary's to rethink its decision to cut the track and field program.

Over the years, the library scarrels have been adorned with the idle thoughts ofpre 
By LAURA KELLY Assisrant Scene Editor 
It happens to everyone, from the practiced slacker to the most diligent student. You've been at the library for what seems like days, your eyes bleary from the lack of sleep, your hands jittery from the steady flow of caffeine. As the clock ticks away the hours, you panic and lose all ability to concentrate on the stack of books in front on you. Wild-eyed and desperate for distraction, you lunge for your trus~y No. 2 pencil and scribble maniacally on the desk m front of you. 
Some vent their frustration by cursing professors and finals week itself. Others are so despairing that all they can think to write is their ~wn n~me, o~er and over. Die-hard fans seek solace m their favorite lyrics, while lovebirds carve hearts and interlocked initials, pining for their absent one. 
The lofty yearning for an education draws hopeful Irish from all corners of the globe, while the frantic cramming of finals week sends them running to !he library. As they huddle in isolated cubicles or social­ize at popular second-floor tables, study b~eaks and perfected procrastination techniques inspire a new art form -a language of the library, a subculture of the stacks. · ·

From the day the Theodore M. Hesburgh Library opened its doors Domers have sought to escape the pressures and d~mands of university life by leaving their mark on the desk in front of them. 
The once smooth, wooden surface of library tables and cubicles tells a history of life at Notre Dame as seen through the eyes of stu~ents -t~eir loves, th_eir hates, their dreams and their frustrat10ns. Explormg this secret saga of the stacks reveals the humor prevalent among decades of undergrads exasperat~d by the gray skies of South Bend and the lack of social life in northern Indiana. 
While their wit and wisdom can be thought-provok­ing or even educational, the timid or faint-at-heart should remember that the maturity level of 18-to 22­year-olds often leaves much to be desired -one unfortunate constant throughout the years. Looking beyond the occasional unpleasantry, however, can provide telling insight into the lives of those who have called this University home. 
At a school so steeped in athletic tradition and excellence, it's only natural to find numerous references to sports and favorite teams scribbled on the desks of scholars. Almost every team is represented somewhere in the library, from "ND Water Polo forever!" to "ND Swim #1." One die-hard rugby player expressed his anger at his team's disbanding by writing a few choice words to the Office of Residence Life in bold black pen, followed by "NOTRE DAME RUGBY LIVES!" 
Football dominates the sport-affiliated graf­fiti. One jubilant fan proclaimed "11/13/95 ­Greatest Day for ND Football Fans!" Another responded grudgingly, "9/18/99 -Worst Day for ND Football Fans." 
Another set of responses reveals the spec­trum of football lovers and haters. An exuber­ant "Are you ready for some football?!" is dryly answered by, "NO -this school should work to develop its academic reputation and recruit profs like it recruits jocks." 
Some take their graffiti more seriously than 
others. 
One interesting phenome­
print up cleverly insulting t-

shirts and chant degrading cheers; they insult us in library cubicles. Wow, they really got us there. 
Stuck behind the walls of the library on a football Saturday, one dedicated fan longed to be in the stadium across the street and must have been listening to the game on the radio while working. An updated score of a Notre Dame vs. BC game runs across the top of one desk, accompanied by a few carefully chosen ex~le­tives to express dissatisfaction with the Screammg Eagles' win. . 
Students maintain a passion for hometown teams and heroes as well. An enthusiastic "Mets #1" is scrawled across several cubicle walls, while a metic­ulously drawn Cubs insignia is etched into one tabl~. And one particularly dedicated sports nut made his mark on seven cubicles in a row, writing "Free 
Pete Rose!" in perma­nent marker. 
This same borderline obsession is found in music fans of all gen­res who find them­selves holed up in the 'brare. Domers of the '80s cried out for Bruce Springsteen, Guns 'N' Roses and The Cure. In response to a Def Leppard logo, one crazed co-ed scrib­bled "Who wrote this?? I want to have your children." "Oasis is the waste bowl of all time," declares anoth­er. 
For some reason, U2 fans are particularly fond of pledging their allegiance via graffiti. "Achtung Baby," "Bono is God," and "U2 U2

popularity throughout several decades, or perhaps simply because the two letter moniker is easy to remember when cranky and craving sleep at 3 a.m. 

Other vocal fans include Phish phans and Deadheads, who tend to ramble in long lyrical quotes sometimes decorated with pot leaves. An interesting juxtaposition of musical tastes is found on one second floor desk in which warring sides have colored the surface with "Poison," "Phish," "Whitesnake," "Grateful Dead" and "Motley Crue." South Bend's local music scene is even represented, with the lyrics of Umphrey's McGee's classic, Bootie Wax. 
Indeed the most popular forms of library graffiti are musical lyrics -as seen on one cubicle com­pletely covered in different son~s -and phi~osophi­cal musings. Apparently the philosophy reqmrement is doing its work, as Notre Dame students throughout the decades have pondered the great questions while procrastinating from their econ or orgo homework. 
They wonder: "Why do I take up space?" They despair: "You live, you learn. Then you die and forget it all." They seek to understand: "All that you have is your soul." They wallow and reflect on the popular musings of other tortured souls: "You run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking ... rac­ing around to come up behind you a~ain. Bummei:." 
Sometimes the pressure to achieve the typical Notre Dame financial success is too much for late­night crammers to bear. "Cash rules everything around me." 'Tm a slave to the traffic light." "The lunatic is in my head." 
One student happily dismisses this fear of succee~­ing in capitalistic America. Noting the words of Ins teacher -" 'PLS, if done correctly, will make you inoperable in the 'real' world.' -Prof. Imery" -the student confidently replies, 'Tm doing something right." 
But fear not -these serious philosophies are tem­pered by the randomness of college-age humor.

WOMEN'S NCAA BASKETBALL 
Tennessee edges UConn, 92-88 
Associated Press 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. 

With Chamique Holdsclaw watching, Gwen Jackson put on a Chamique Holdsclaw-type performance to lead Tennessee to victory in one of the biggest rivalries in women's basketball. 
Jackson scored a career-high 28 points, grabbed 14 rebounds and blocked five shots as the third-ranked Lady Vols (22-1} outlasted the No. 2 Connecticut Huskies 92-88 Thursday. 
"If you had told me that we would be able to win with Michelle Snow and Semeka Randall playing the way that they played and Tamika Catchings in street clothes, I wouldn't have believed it," said Tennessee coach Pat Summitt, who earned her 750th win. "Gwen Jackson was our biggest player on both ends of the floor." 
Holdsclaw, a member of three national championship teams at Tennessee, had her No. 23 jersey retired in a half­time ceremony. 
In a frenetic and riveting game between the top pro­grams in women's college bas­ketball, Snow and Randall cooled off for the first time since Catchings went down with a torn ACL on Jan. 15. 
Kara Lawson added 23 points and Kristen Clement had 10 for Tennessee, which has won 11 straight since losing 81-76 to the Huskies (17-2) on Dec. 30. Connecticut had won the last two meetings in the series, including last season's national championship. 
The rematch lived up to its billing and remained close the entire way as neither team was 


able to extend a lead past nine points. Tennessee led by seven with 
1:02 remaining, but Connecticut refused to back down. 
Jackson and Lawson each made two free throws down the stretch after the Huskies pulled within four on Sue Bird's bas­ket to keep the Lady Vols in front. 
Connecticut's Tamika Williams, who finished with 23 points and 10 rebounds, scored with 4.3 seconds left, cutting the lead to 88-90, before Tennessee's Ashley Robinson, who has struggled from the line, made two free throws after she was intentionally fouled on the next possession to ice the victory. 
The Lady Vols rushed to cen­ter court as orange and white confetti fell to the floor after time expired. 
..There's a lot of talent on this team. With Michelle and I play­ing like we did, it showed that there are other people there," Randall said. "Gwen and Kara did an awesome job. I'm glad I'm on their team." 
The Huskies had an answer for just about everything Tennessee did. They outre­bounded the Lady Vols 47-38 and scored 25 points off 11 turnovers. 
"In any other game, we would have won. but not tonight," Huskies coach Geno Auriemma said. "We played pretty well and they still beat us." 
Connecticut had won four straight since being overpow­ered by Notre Dame 92-76 on Jan. 15. The Huskies weren't about to outplayed like that

Tennessee went up by seven with 1:02 left after Snow·was fouled hard by Diana Taurasi, who picked up her fifth foul. The call enraged Auriemma and he was called for a techni­cal. Lawson made both techni­cal free throws and Snow added a free throw for an 86­79 lead. 
Bird hit a 3, missed two more 3s, then finally drove the lane for a basket to cut the lead to 88-84. 
The Lady Vols built an eight­point lead to start the second half before Shea Ralph's basket cut the margin to 52-46 with 
18:12 left. 
Tennessee went ahead 61-52 on Jackson's jumper with 14:12 remaining before the Huskies went on a 15-2 run over the next 5 1/2 minutes to take the lead. Svetlana Abrosimova's 3­pointer gave Connecticut its first lead of the second half before Taurasi hit another 3­pointer for a 67-63 lead with 
8:47 to go. 
Abrosimova, the Huskies' main scoring threat, left the game with 9:22 to go after she crashed hard to the floor going for a loose ball. She played only a few minutes the rest of the game and was diagnosed with a sprained left foot, finishing with 18 points. 
The Lady Vols tied the score at 67 on Jackson's basket and Snow's two free throws with 
7:28 left. The teams traded bas­kets until Clement was fouled twice and made three free throws to put Tennessee in front 79-74 with 3:25 remain­ing.

FENCING 
Notre Dame faces marathon home meet 
By MIKE CONNOLLY 
Sports Writer 
The Irish fencing team faces a marathon test of endurance this weekend in its only home regu­lar season meet of the year. 
Facing 10 teams over two days, Notre Dame must remain mentally and physically focused for the entire weekend. 
"I think it is going to be really long," women's epee captain Kim DeMaio said. "Last week­end at Northwestern when we fenced our fifth match. we were really tired at the end of the day. I think it is going to be a long weekend." 
The two-day meet will be a good warm-up for the four-day NCAA Championships in March, according to men's foil captain Ozren Debic. 
"The only time we fenced like that last year was at the NCAAs but that was much harder com­petition," he said. "Since this meet is at home, it is going to be more relaxed so I don't know. I am looking forward to it just to see how it goes. It will show how good we really are since we are competing and exhausting our­selves to the limit." 
Although eight of the 10 teams the Irish face this weekend should pose little threat, Air Force could give both the men's and women's teams a test while the Northwestern women are one of the best in the country. The Irish face both teams on Sunday morning -after fencing five bouts on Saturday. 
..As long as we still have ener­gy it doesn't matter when we fence those," women's sabre captain Carianne McCullough said. "We can't come in from Saturday -however it goes ­and just be worn out." 
The women narrowly defeated Northwestern 14-13 last week­end but expect to win again this weekend but by a larger margin. 
"I think we definitely have the potential to do a lot better than we did," DeMaio said. "I just feel that we will beat them again, hopefully a little easier this time." 
If the Irish are going to win by a larger margin, they will need a better showing by the epee squad. While the women's foil squad beat Northwestern 7·2 and the sabre squad on 6-3, the epee squad was whipped 8-1. 
Sophomore All-American Meagan Call feels she can improve on her 1-2 record against the Wild_cats while DeMaio expects All-American Anna Carnick to fence better this weekend. 
"I think [Carnick's] feet are still bothering her a little bit, her injury is still there but she is ready to fence Northwestern," DeMaio said. "I know she wasn't very happy with last weekend." 
The long weekend will be more than an endurance test for Notre Dame. It will also give the walk-on fencers a chance to fence a few bouts. After the Irish win five bouts against a team, they will replace the starters with some of the less experi­enced fencers. 
"It's going to be the opportuni­ty for the non-starters and the walk-ons to compete," Debic said. "That will give them the chance to prove themselves. Our goal is to give as many people as we can the opportunity to fence." 
The toughest test for the men will come from Air Force. The Falcons are led by All-American epeeist Seth Kelsey who finished ninth at NCAAs last year. 
The Irish will counter Kelsey with a pair of All-Americans at epee -Jan Viviani and Brian Casas. Viviani missed last week­end's meet at Northwestern while he was fencing at a World Cup event in Cuba. 
The Irish begin the weekend against Michigan State at 9 a.m. on Saturday followed by Detroit, Chicago, Wayne State and Cleveland State at 10:30 a.m., noon, 1:30 p.m. and 3 p.m. On Sunday the Irish start the day at 8 a.m. against Minnesota before fencing Air Force at 9:30, Northwestern at 11 a.m., Michigan at 12:30 p.m. and Lawrence at 2 p.m. All matches are held in the hockey dome of the Joyce Center.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING 
Irish swim to No. 15 
in new poll 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 
On the heels of a pair of impressive dual meet wins last week, the Notre Dame women's swimming team jumped up one position to No. 15 in the lat­e s t Speedo America Top 25 


P O l I Van Saun released Feb. 1. The No. 15 ranking is the highest Irish have ever risen in the national poll in the history of the swim­ming program. "I think it just shows that our hard work has really paid off this season, espe­cially the last two dual meets," said senior Kristen Van San Notre Dame finished its dual meet season with a 10-1 record. The Irish wrapped up their dual meet competition last Friday with a 157-143 win over Michigan, less than 24 hours after holding off Northwestern 154-146. Their lone loss of the sea­
son came on Nov. 4, when Notre Dame fell 161-138 to Purdue. 
Michigan dropped two places to No. 16, while Northwestern jumped up five spots to No. 18. 
"I think people thought we'd not be as good this year without Carrie Nixon, but we pulled together," Van Saun said. "A lot of that credit goes to our freshmen, they've really matured and stepped it up a lot for us this year." 
Junior Kelly Hecking, freshman Marie Labosky, and junior Heather Mattignly have been instrumental in Notre Dame's success this season 
The Irish have two more weeks of practice before the Big East Conference Championships begin on Feb. 15 in Long Island, NY. Notre Dame will be swim­ming for their fifth straight conference title since join­ing the Big East confer­ence six years ago.

The Notre Dame hockey team didn't have much to do to pre­pare for this weekend's series against Ohio State in Columbus. That is because for the second time in three weekends the Irish have a two-game series against the Buckeyes. 
Unlike two weeks ago, this series will not be played in the intimate Joyce Center, but instead in Ohio State's Schottenstein Center. 
While the Joyce Center holds 2,700 for hockey, the Schottenstein Center holds 17,500 fans. With Columbus get­ting an expansion NHL team, the crowds are finally showing up to OSU hockey games. Playing in front of a large crowd is something that excites Irish coach Dave Poulin. 
"It is a different feeling going down there than in years past," said Poulin. "Before (Ohio State) play in a tiny arena that held 1,500 people. Now they play in a beautiful arena and they drew 14,000 for a game against us last year." 
Notre Dame has been kept busy in the past two weeks play­ing Michigan on Jan. 23 along with a series against non-con­ference foe Yale this past week­end. This is .in stark contrast to the Buckeyes, who have sat at home for the past two weeks. 
They won't have to change much of their game plan. Poulin felt that they played effectively against Ohio State the last time the schools met. 
"We played very well against Ohio State," said Poulin. "We didn't have many breakdowns, they just made good plays. So we don't need to go out and change much. We just need to play our game." 
Notre Dame will devote a large part of its gameplan to stopping Ohio State's fabulous freshmen. Two of the top three scorers for the Buckeyes are freshmen Dave Steckel and RJ Umberger. In Notre Dame's first meeting with Ohio State on Jan. 
19. the freshmen scored every goal for the Buckeyes. 
Coming off a 40-save perfor­mance against Yale, sophomore Tony Zasowski will be between the pipes this weekend. Zasowski took the loss Jan. 19 and did not start the next night against the Buckeyes. 
One question for the Ohio State series will be the health of Irish freshman Aaron Gill. Gill had a mishap on an icy sidewalk and injured his back. He missed this past Saturday's game against Yale, but was in the line­up for Sunday. According to Poulin, Gill will be in the lineup for tonight's game.

Brey said. "It's another good road 
challenge, but we're not in must win 
territory. We're better, and they're 
better this year." 

Not only are the Panthers (12-7, 4­
4) better than they were in 1999­2000; they're anxious to show their dismal performance at Notre Dame was a fluke. In the Jan. 16 match, which Notre Dame won 74-58 to begin its current run of wins, the Panthers missed their first 11 shots and never recovered. The Irish held Pittsburgh's star player, Ricardo Greer, to 2-for-12 shooting, an outing he's not likely to forget. 
"I don't think Pittsburgh's going to get off to as bad a start as they did here," Brey said. "We really have to be ready to play. They've shot it much better at home than on the road." 
The Panthers have played much bet­ter at home in general, with just two of their seven losses coming at Fitzgerald Field House. Their shooting percentage against Notre Dame was a rare low ball for the Panthers. More often, the Panthers smother their opponents from the field. The Pitt defense is keeping opponents to the lowest point total and worst shooting percentage in the conference. 
The Irish managed to hold down the tempo against · high-scoring Georgetown, and their ability to con­trol the game pace against the Panthers will be key. 
"We know we need to go in and con­trol the tempo," said Irish point guard Martin Ingelsby. who leads the Big East in assist-to-turnover ratio at 
2.65. "When opportunities are there, take them, but not be too crazy with the ball. We need to get it into our big guys in the post, because that's where we're most effective." 
If the two teams keep things slow 
and patient Saturday, the Irish may 
actually benefit. With three strong 
post players in Murphy, Ryan 
Humphrey and Harold Swanagan, 
meshing with three potent perimeter 
shooters in lngelsby. David Graves 
and Matt Carroll, Notre Dame has 
options galore. 
Pittsburgh isn't quite as versatile, 
but the Panthers do have some 
options beyond Greer. a senior guard. 
Freshman point guard Julius Page 
and 6-foot-8 senior forward Isaac 
Hawkins each average 9. 7 points per 
game, while forward Donatas 
Zavackas and guard Brandin Knight 
are also important contributors for 
coach Ben Howland's squad. 
In the first Irish-Panthers contest 
this season, Brey implemented a new 
starting lineup, replacing Graves with 
Swanagan due to Graves' sprained 
ankle. The switch worked, and Brey's 
stuck with it ever since. 
Swanagan became the team's shin­ing example of gritty play with his penchant for rebounds and floor burns, while Graves, still averaging more than 30 minutes per game, pro­vides energy and hot shooting off the bench. The flip-flop in positions among the teammates and close friends is a change the Irish look to as a possible turning point in their sea­son. 
..I don't know what the difference is," Murphy said of the change in Irish play. "It could have something to do with the new starting lineup." 
Ingelsby added, "I think we're just playing well as a team right now. We're doing the right things at the offensive end and defensive end. I think guys know their roles, and we've established our guys in the post." 
Doing the same on Saturday should up the Irish run of victories to five, a school record for consecutive league wins.

. Belles travel to Calvin for MIAA matchup 
By KATIE McVOY 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Post player Kristen Matha returned to the court Wednesday night to join a Saint Mary's team that strug­gled, but left Cappaert Gymnasium at Alma College feeling proud. After a seven game losing streak, the Belles team dropped the game to 
[Alma on Jan. 6]." head coach Suzanne Smith said. 
In the first minutes of the game, things looked bleak for the Belles. Scots' starting for­ward Janell Twietmeyer came out and hit her first three shots, dropping the Belles behind seven points. 
However. the Belles fought back. Matha joined the team off the bench and gave the team some motivation to get into the game. 
..The team was very excited to have her back," Smith said. "I think its given the team a lift." 
Matha did a lot to help a Saint Mary's offense that went into halftime down by three points, 30-27. 
"Our post kind of lit up with Kristen there," Smith said. "She creates opportunities for 
lther people." 
During Wednesday's game 
Matha was creating opportuni­
ties for Anne Blair. 
"We really feed off of each other," Matha said. "It's great being in there and playing with her." 
Feeding off of each other 

worked well for the team of post players Wednesday. Blair led the team with 18 points and four blocks. A still-recov­ering Matha, who only played for 20 minutes, scored eight points, had eight rebounds and led the team with three steals. 
"It felt great being back in there," Matha said. 
Although the Belles kept the game close, it may have been fouls that put the final nail in the coffin. Alma players went to the foul line 22 times during the course of the game; Saint Mary's saw the line six

cost them points. Wednesday marked a season low number of turnovers, with only 13. 
In addition, Saint Mary's seemed to recreate team com­munication that has been miss­ing. 
"We really looked like a team," Smith said. 
Matha attributes part of the communication and focus to being on the road. 
"I love being on the road," she said. "There are no dis­tractions and we don't have all day to think about the game." 
Although Saint Mary's still fell short of a victory, the team is hoping Wednesday's good play will springboard them to a victory over Calvin College on Saturday. 
..[Wednesday) came out with a lot of intensity and feeling," Smith said. "We need to do that again." 
The Belles will be facing off against a Knights' team that is 4-5 in the MIAA and 9-10 over­all. The Belles are 7 -15 overall. 
The last time these two teams met, Calvin defeated Saint Mary's 52-35. This time Saint Mary's plans to be on top. 
"In the Calvin-Saint Mary's game, the only team that can beat us is Saint Mary's," Matha said. 
However, a strong Calvin team will be looking for a win. Led on offense by Jennifer Playmeyer, Tara Bergsma and Emily Mejeu, who average 11,

away, competing against conference rivals Georgetown and Miami should give the Irish insight heading into the meet. 
..Georgetown historically is very good distance and mid­dle-distance," said Irish head coach Joe Piane...This year is no exception -in fact they may be better than normal." 
Miami comes in with a solid sprint crew that will challenge Gilbert and Davey in the 60 meters and Gilbert and "Red" Croker in the 200 meters. 
"It's good to see the com­petition that's going to be in the Big East meet," said Davey. "My focus is the Big East, so it's good to see the competition beforehand." 
Tennessee sprinter Leonard Scott brings in the nation's top times in the 60­m e te rs and 200-meters. Scott has clocked in at 6.57 in the 60 and 20.80 in the 200. 
In the longer sprints, the Irish will be challenged by a talented group of Georgetown middle-distance runners. Freshman James Bracken will run the 400 meters. Georgetown's Nick Reynolds brings in the Big East's top time in the event with a 47.74 on Saturday. 
In the 500 meters, Irish sprinter/kicker Nick Setta and senior Terry Wray face a talented group of Georgetown runners. Wray, who specializes in the event, is competing in the 500 for the first time this season. 
'Tm ready to come out and run a good time." Wray said. "I ran a pretty good time last year. I'm hoping to go in to the Big East meet with the No. 2 time." 
The Irish start off the meet­tonight with the long jump. Gilbert will face a challenge from Miami's Joseph Mbayen, who has jumped 
7.24 meters in the event this season. Godwin Mbagwu and Eddie Faustin also will take part in the event for the Irish. 
"Godwin had a rough week last week -not up to his standards or mine," said Irish field events coach Scott Winsor. "Eddie needs to get on the board. I think he·s had three legal jumps in two competitions." 
Later this evening, Irish star distance runner Ryan Shay will compete in the 5,000 meters. Shay looks to top Georgetown's Tom Howell, who ran a time of 
14:57.91 in December. Marc Striowski will also compete for the Irish. 
The final event this evening is the distance medley relay. Because the Big East has introduced qualifying times for the conference champi­onship meet, Notre Dame needs to run the event. 
Sean Zanderson leads off for the Irish, running the first three-quarter mile. lie then hands off to Bracken, who will run 400 meters. Bracken gives way to Setta, who will run the 800-meter leg. The anchor is John Keane, who runs the final mile. 
Freshman Mbagwu looks to remain No. 1 in the Big East in the triple jump Saturday. Sophomore Scott Kelley and senior Chris Marvin look to help make up for Redwine's absence. 
In the 35-pound weight throw, sophomore Brian Thornburg looks to improve upon last week's first-place performance. Derek Dyer looks to break out of a rut in the shotput. 
The most entertaining event Saturday will likely be the ..Meyo Mile." Although no Notre Dame athlete will be competing. the race attracts some of the nation's best. Drake's Troy Trygstadd leads a pack of runners who have approached the four-minute mark this season. 
In the 800 meters, sopho­more Doug Gunzelman looks to improve in Andrulonis' absence. Georgetown's Jesse O'Connell has run 1:51 in the event. 
Freshman Mark Barber looks to get past the first hurdle in the 60-meter hur­dles. Barber, who has been slowed by hitting the first obstacle, has looked good in practice. 
"If he can clear the first hurdle, I think he'll run real well," said Millar. 
Field events begin at 10:30 
a.m. Saturday, while running events get going at noon.

. Irish must battle injuries, illness in weekend invitational 
By NOAH AMSTADTER Assistant Sports Editor 
Injuries are the focus when the Irish men's track team begins the Meyo Invitational today in Loftus as the team will be with­out three important members of their team. 
Distance runners Pat Conway -who has won the mile in both Notre Dame meets this season ­is out with a leg injury, as is 800-meter standout Nate Andrulonis. 
Junior Quill Redwine, who won both the high jump and triple jump last Friday against Michigan State, will miss the invitational with a tender knee. 
Additionally, the team's lead­ing scorer, sprinter/jumper Tom Gilbert, has been battling the flu all week. 
"I've been sick all week, that's my biggest problem right now," said Gilbert. "If it were a smaller meet I'd probably consider not running." 
The meet brings some of the top teams in the country to South Bend. Michigan, Tennessee, Miami (Fla.), Wake Forest, Duke, Missouri and Michigan State all will be com­peting. Other competitors include Georgetown, Kentucky, Central Michigan and Easterri Michigan.

. At Invite, focus is on making individual success instead of team performance

Liz Grow has yet to be tested this season. 
She's won every individual event in which she's been entered by wide margins. She's qualified for the NCM indoor finals with­out a time that is among the fastest in the nation. In short, she hasn't faced any real competition. This weekend, that will change. 
Liz Grow, meet Foye Williams. 
\Villiams, ·who competed on Canada's 2000 Olympic team, will make her annual trek to the Meyo Invitational this weekend to run against some top-level collegiate competition. Grow's fastest 400­meter time this season is 54.61 seconds. 
By contrast, Williams typically runs a 52 second 400-meters. 
"Faye's the one person who's really beaten Liz," said Irish sprints coach John Millar. "She gives Liz some extra motivation." 
Williams, a professional runner who trains independently, usually comes down to the Meyo Invitational because of its size and the talent level, Millar said. 
"She helps us by coming down her," he said. "It's an athlete that's at the next level, if you want to call her that. It's good for Liz and the others to compete against her." 
Grow is also in another intrigu­

Severe latest piece of the Irish puzzle to fall in place 
"She expects me to defend and rebound," Severe said of her roles on the team. "I really never have to worry about scoring. If I get wideopen, that's good. But we've got so many scorers on the floor, it's just like get the ball to them and you're fine." 
Entering Saturday's game at Boston College (8-12 overall, 2·7 in the Big East), the Irish players have all seemed to fit into the system. The three main scorers (Ruth Riley, Niele Ivey and Alicia . Ratay) have been complemented by the interior defense and rebounding of

Notre Dame seeks revenge for late season loM to Pitt 
By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 
Associate Sports Editor 
Riding a four-game winning streak, the Irish head to Pittsburgh Saturday hoping to avoid a repeat of last year's road letdown against the Panthers. 
.. I'd say the Pittsburgh game was one of the ones that sealed us not get­ting into the NCM tournament," Irish forward Troy Murphy, the current Big East Player of the Week, said. 
A loss to the Panthers a season ago helped send the Irish packing to the Notre Dame traveled to Pittsburgh with a 14-8 record, having defeated the Panthers by 15 in the Joyce Center less than two weeks earlier. But Notre Dame caved to a 15-0 run by Pittsburgh in the second half and dropped five of its next eight games. 
Despite the sour aftertaste of last year's game, Irish coach Mike Brey doesn't view Saturday's contest as a must win for his 13-5 team, which sits atop the West Division of the Big East at 5-2 in the league.
