Vatican sets faith on birth methods 
Associated Press 
VATICAN City-The Vatican warned against "unforesee­able and damaging" conse­quences of artificial procrea­tion Tuesday, condemning surrogate motherhood, test­tube births, cloning and experi­ments on living embryos. 
In setting out the Roman Catholic church's position on rapidly developing techniques of fertilization, the Vatican also called for laws against embryo banks, attempts to fashion animal-human hybrids and the planting of human embryos in artificial and animal uteruses. 
It left the door open to re­search on helping sterile couples conceive and withheld judgment on fertilization tech­niques in use or development that neither substitute for marital intercourse nor result in deaths of "spare" embryos. 
"We encourage scientific re­search ... but science is not ab­solute, to which everything must be subordinated and eventually sacrificed, includ­ing the dignity of man,'' Car­dinal Joseph Ratzinger, head of 

HPC hears of policy to punish drunk drivers 
By REGIS COCCIA Assistant News Editor 
The establishment of a Uni­versity policy to discipline stu­dents arrested for drunk driving was discussed Tuesday night by the Hall Presidents' Council. 
Father Gerry Lardner, Grace Hall rector, spoke to the hall presidents to get student opinion on "a policy which would guide the University in handling cases when students, while driving under the influ­ence of alcohol, pose a threat to the lives and safety of other persons." 
"Should the University have a policy for dealing with drunk drivers?" asked Lardner. "I think student opinion on this would be very ambivalent, frankly," he said. "It's an open discussion. We're just inter­viewing students leaders," said Lardner. 
HPC Co-Chairman Joanie Cahill said "some people feel civil law is enough, that Notre Dame should only be a sup-the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, told a news conference. 
The church position is con­tained in a 40-page document written by the Congregation, the guardian and promoter of Roman Catholic orthodoxy, and approved by Pope John Paul II. 
Vatican officials said the pope was consulted at every stage about the document, titled "Instruction on Respect for Human Life in its Origin and on the Dignity of Procrea­tion -replies to Certain Ques­tions of the Day." 
Some Vatican officials des­cribed it as the most important pronouncement on human procreation since the 1968 "Humane Vitae" encyclical of Pope Paul VI, which banned ar­tificial birth control. 
Any Catholic who "willingly and knowingly" violates the directives will be committing a sin, Vatican officials said. The document asks all church-run hospitals and Catholic doctors and scientists to follow to the directives. 
Ratzinger said the document was a response to requests and queries from national bishops' conferences, individual pr­elates, doctors and scientists. He described it as the result of "vast consultations" with ex­perts and church officials. 
Central to Vatican reasoning are two time-honored church principles: that every human life must respected from the moment of conception, and that the only acceptable way to give 
birth  to  a  child  is  through  
sexual  intercourse  between  
married spouses.  

According to the document, the church opposes all forms of "test-tube" births because it is "immoral to produce human embryos destined to be ex­ploited as disposable biological material." 
It says life begins when the ovum is fertilized and the embryo must be treated as a person. It also insists that "corpses" of human embryos and fetuses be respected and not subjected to mutilation. 
porter. Should Notre Dame deal with (students arrested for drunk driving) itself or should it hand the student over to civil authorities? Should there be a punishment from the University in addition to civil disciplining?" 
The hall presidents offered opinions both for and against University action in cases where students are subject to Indiana law for driving while intoxicated. 
"Everybody knows the Uni­versity can do as it pleases as long as it says in print what it's going to do beforehand," Lardner said. "On a case by case interest, the University makes judgment calls. Secur­ity would not make an arrest without consulting (Associate Vice President for Residence Life John) Goldrick," said Lardner. 
"In cases of suspension, counseling was conditional to the suspension," Lardner said. "So it's not like the University

OC commissioner set 
Run-off set for other class tickets 
By CHRIS JULKA Assistant News Editor 
Diane Fitzgibbon will be the new president of the senior class, and Sean Evers will replace Race Thoman as off campus commissioner, the two being the only clear-cut win­ners of Tuesday's four student elections. 
Fitzgibbon and her running mates Sean Doyle, Amy Treder, and James Wimbiscus carried all the dorms but five, with Steve Dufour's ticket mounting the only significant challenge by taking Alumni and Dillion halls, the off campus residences, and refus­ing to budge from its home 
strongholds  of  Grace, Lyons  
and Zahm.  Evers  won  unop­ 
posed.  

Fitzgibbon garnered 530 bal­lots or 59.3 percent of the total vote, thus obtaining the neces­sary majority of her class to become president starting April I. 
By contrast the sophomore and junior contests produced no decisive winner. None of the 


Demolition set for the future of former Nickie's tavern 
By GREG LUCAS Staff Reporter 
The former Nickie's tavern on N. Eddy St. is scheduled for demolition because of its deteriorating roof and struc­ture, said Patricia Declerq, head of the Department of Code Enforcement in South Bend. 
"We are now taking bids for the demolition," said Declerq, adding that the lowest bidder will begin destruction of the building as soon as possible. 
Nick Bilello, owner of Nickie's who could not be reached for a comment, did not attend the Department of Code Enforcement hearing on March 5, said Declerq. 
"We'd had a long history of the building being in dis­repair," said Declerq. On Oc­11 sophomore or five junior of­fice candidates came close to the needed 50 percent of the vote. 
As a result the leading two tickets from each of these class races will compete against each other in the run-off elec­tions to be held this Thursday. 
Of the candidates who will participate in the junior class office run-off, Ellen Nichols drew the most votes of her class with 23.9 percent of the ballots, edging past the 22.4 percent won by Bill Pelino, who will oppose her. 
In the sophomore class office elections, Dave Kinkopf ac­quired a clear lead but only 
27.03 percent of the vote. His ticket will oppose that of Tom Rask, which received 15.86 per­cent of the vote. 
Student Judicial Coordinator Maria Cintron supervised and determined the tallies of the above elections without the as­sistance of the Ombudsman, which traditionally has managed all student elections. 
see ELECTIONS, page S 

tober 13, 1986 Bilello posted a $1000 cash bond and was or­dered to make repairs on the building by the end of Novem­ber, Declerq said. "In any event no repairs were made and the repair date was passed," Declerq said. 
"Any work that (Bilello) would complete on the building now would be at great risk be­cause the demolition has been ordered," said Declerq. 
Declerq said that she thought Bilello was trying to sell the property. She added that the Department of Code Enforce­ment would be willing to hold a hearing with a new owner. 
"Our aim is not demolition. We certainly would have liked to see Mr. Bilello repair the building" said Declerq. 

This will be the final reg­ular issue of The Observer before spring break. Tomor­row a special edition of Irish Extra will be printed. The Observer staff wishes every­one a happy and safe spring break.

ND grad's book and spring usher in time to remember 
Certain books should be read only on certain types of days, in certain places, at certain times. 
As the first drops of spring tapped on my shoulder, I grabbed a blue-and-gold book meant to be read on the not-too-green grass of South Quad. 
As students swarmed around the center of campus, I quietly read Edward Fischer's "Notre Dame Remembered." 
As a student, I see changes at Notre Dame in terms of passing seasons. Football flows into the fall, snow drifts into winter, flowers bud in the spring and calm comes with summer. 
Over forty-five years have passed since Fis­cher saw Notre Dame in such a light. His eyes have grown accustomed to a more gradual, per­vasive sense of change. For him, the sudden­ness of seasons has yielded to the subtlety of years. 
"It did not seem possible, we both agreed, that fifty years had passed since we sat on Sorin porch--endowed with all the juices of life and surrounded by lovely autumn afternoons," Fis­cher laments as he encounters an old classmate in front of the administration building. 
"Those were the days we took tests under the Dome without once realizing how we die a little in the time it takes to put a period at the end of a sentence," Fischer continues. 
Fischer does not pretend to tell us how to live, but he does tell us how precious life is and gives us examples of individuals who have lived lives of grace despite the realities of the world. 
"We were still young enough to think that as we ran up Sorin stairway nothing changed. But in those few seconds everything in the universe was changing and has been ever since. 
"Like every graduating class we stepped from campus life into a world of hard choices. Many of our ideas of reality were severely chal­lenged, as we learned the gap between inten­tions and results. And as we should have known, all of our plans were subject to God's veto," Fischer concedes. 
Joe Murphy 
Editor-in-Chief 


When summer comes, the students will have left Notre Dame. Most will be back to burn in the August sun, but some, the seniors, will find new lives awaiting them. 
Hopefully, the seniors' all-too-short years at Notre Dame have provided a foundation of com­passion, competence and commitment to serve others as pthers have served them. 
For the Class of 1987, spring is its last season under the Dome. With spring's warmth comes an appropriate opportunity to remember the people--family, faculty, religious, and administrators--who have made us what we are and who have prepared as we go forth to live as we have been raised. 
May will come quickly.

Democrats urge delay of contra aid 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON House Democrats, including one declaring Nicaragua's Contra rebels "mired in corruption," urged colleagues Tuesday to delay $40 million in military aid and insist the Reagan adminis­tration pursue opportunities for peace in Central America. 
House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas told reporters that Wed­nesday's House vote on the aid installment will represent the start of a new, long-term struggle over the administra­tion's policy. 
He said that while Democrats may lose the opening skirmish, the vote will serve as an important building stone in the battle to cut off aid to the Contras permanently. 
House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois acknowl­edged that the Contra-aid cause had been hurt by revela­tions of the Iran-Contra affair, including allegations that prof­its from arms sales were diverted to the rebels. 
"That hasn't helped us... I have to be realistic when I see votes slipping away," Michel said. 
However, Wright conceded that he cannot count on the votes to enforce a moratorium on spending the money in view of President Reagan's certain veto. He said the $40 million, the last installment in a $100 million aid package approved last year, ''probably will go for­ward." 
Most lawmakers agreed, and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said the money was "in the bank." 
But Wright said a strong vote to stall on making the money available will signal the White House that future aid requests will be in serious trouble on Capitol Hill. 
At the White House, during a meeting with House and Senate Republicans, Reagan said of the House Democrats, "All they are trying to do is break the commitment that the Congress made last year." 
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said "the president most certainly would veto" such a move, and he added, "we think we have the votes to sustain a veto." 
Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D­Conn., a Contra aid opponent, said that because there is no

chance of rallying the two-thirds majorities required to override a presidential veto, no political capital should be ex­pended on the $40 million weapons-aid issue. 
Dodd said the major battle should be to end the Contra aid effort pemanently -by scrap­ping a separate Reagan re­quest for $105 million in further aid. 
House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash., said of Wed­nesday's vote, "What we're demonstrating by this vote is that the president doesn't have the votes to get the $105 mil­lion."

Babbitt chose to spend hh.

three areas that will be crucial 
to his dark-horse effort. He 
began in New Hampshire,

was spending the night in the 
South where most states are 
holding their primaries and 
caucuses on the same day, 
March 8, 1988. 
During a campaign stop in Des Moines, Iowa, Babbitt said he would consider hostage­taking as ''an act of war." 
He conceded it's "heart­
wrenching" to see hostages 
pleading for their lives but said 
leaders should stand firm, and 
the public backs that view. 
He said his policy would be "simply to say the taking of hostages will be treated as an act of war. 
"What we are going to do is say we are at war with that na­tion," Babbitt said. He said the country should use "diplomatic and economic" sanctions, but "we can't exclude the use of force and I don't." 
Babbitt joined Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri in the Democratic race. 
Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts plans to an­nounce his plans next week, and former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado has scheduled his an­nouncement for April 13. 
The Rev. Jesse Jackson and Sen. Joseph Eiden of Delaware also are expected to enter the race, and Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas is considering be­coming a candidate as well. 
With his wife and two sons on the platform, Babbitt declared his candidacy before about 200 supporters at Science Enrich­ment Encounters, a display of science and industrial exhibits geared to children. 
His speech contained several allusions to the Iran-Contra af­fair although he never referred directly to the investigations.




anniversary 
Special to The Observer 
This past fall marked the fif­tieth anniversary of ac­celerator physics at Notre Dame, where physicists were among the first to use electro­static accelerators, popularly called atom smashers, to study the atomic nucleus and the first to disintegrate the nucleus of an atom by electron bombard­ments. 
Accelerator physics at Notre Dame began with a do-it ­yourself approach. On a $900 budget and almsot entirely with volunteer labor a huge Van de Graft generator, while simple compared to today's high-powered machines, was capable of generating poten­tials up to 1.8 million volts. 
[\'1 ?.>\I-
The generator was ,' first operated in October, 1926, and by the following year the ac­celerating tube connected the terminal to an adjacent room, where nuclear experiments were conducted. Initially, re­searchers climbed inside the terminal to adjust the electron source as the generator ran. 
Using this home-made in­strument, Notre Dame scien­tists were the first to show that the nucleus could be disin­tegrated by electron bombard­ment. Through the years the acceleration of electrons remained a trademark of Notre Dame accelerator labs for close to forty years. 
Early on, the weaknesses of the open-air generating system were obvious. South Bend's humid climate limited experi­ments to the winter months, and even then it was difficult to reach the voltages desired for research. Due to moisture in the air, sparks--actually lightning bolts, some 15 to 17 feet long--flashed out in all di­rections from the terminal and a purplish corona could fill the room when high voltages were reached. 
Frustrated by the open-air accelerator's limitations, Notre Dame physicists built a second accelerator in 1940-41. 

1:15 a.m. -A Plainfield, Indiana, resident reported that some items were stolen from his vehicle while he was visiting the Notre Dame area. The vehicle was locked at the time the theft occurred and, according to the victim, the car was locked when he returned to it. Taken from the vehicle was a mens' suit, trench coat, pen set, radar detector and several cas­sette tapes with a total value of $469.99. There were no signs of forced entry. 
12:30 p.m. -A Holy Cross Hall res­ident reported the theft of his Notre Dame class ring from in­side his unlocked room. The vic­tim estimated his loss at $310.00. 
1:35 p.m. -The manager of Notre Dame Vending reported that one of its machines located in Keenan Hall was damaged and all prod­ucts inside stolen. No damage es­timate or loss was available when the incident was reported.

The victim had only been away from the vehicle for about twenty minutes and found the car se­cured when he returned.

Incumbent wins third term as Ireland's prime minister 
Associated Press 
DUBLIN, Ireland -Charles Haughey won a third term as Ireland's prime minister today in a cliffhanger session of Par­liament that gave him a one­vote majority. 
The Dail, or parliament, split 82-82 after debate on his nomination. Speaker Sean Treacy then used his vote to break the tie in Haughey's fa­vor. 
All four opposition parties united in voting against Haug­hey, whose Fianna Fail party won 81 seats in the Feb. 17 elec­tion. All the opposition parties in the 166-seat body nominated their own leaders for taoiseach, or prime minister. None had any chance of winning, but Haughey's prospects were not certain until almost the last minute. 
Haughey's election was as­sured when Marxist indepen­his abstention shortly before the ballot. 
Haughey was supported by his Fianna Fail party and also got the vote of Neil Blaney, an independent and an anti­British nationalist. 
Blaney signaled potential trouble for Haughey when he said his support was condi­tional on the new government "reviewing" the 1985 Anglo­Irish Agreement on Northern Ireland. 
Blaney said he opposed the agreement because "it gives the British the right to be in this country." The agreement gives Ireland a say in the run­ning of Northern Ireland, but also contains Irish recognition of long-term British sovereignty over the province, which Irish nationalists con­tend is part of Ireland. 
Britain has warned it will not accept any change of the agree­ment until it comes up for review in November 1988 as

NEW YORK -CBS news, the network of Edward Murrow, is reeling from the abrupt firing of more than 200 of its 1,200 news employees, prompting current and former staffers to worry about its future. 
Former CBS news President Bill Leonard said in a telephone interview from his home in Washington that he found the layoffs of last week "horrify­ing." 
"I frankly despair for the fu­ture of CBS news," he said. 
Former "CBS evening News" executive producer Burton Benjamin, now at the Gannett Center for Media Studies at Columbia Univer­sity, said he felt "tremendous sadness" but predicted hope-rebound. 
However, former CBS corre­spondent Hughes Rudd, from the vantage point of retirement in the south of France, called the cuts "long overdue." 
A frequent and outspoken critic of network news even when he was in the thick of it, Rudd left CBS for ABC seven years ago and retired last year. 
"The fact is, all the network news divisions got so fat and happy," Rudd said in a tele­phone interview. "For years, it seems to me, they didn't even care about your expense ac­counts as long as you turned in something to show for it. Money used to fly around like dead leaves at CBS." 

Elections

Ombudsman withdrew from supervision in protest last Wed­nesday. 
Cintron, referring to the ac­tion which occurred as a part of a protest to the Student Sen­ate's amendment of election rules last Monday, said there were "no hard feelings." 
"Tom (Brennan, OBUD co­director) and Dan (Gamache, OBUD elections officer) were quite helpful," she said. "They let us use their ballot boxes and answered our questions when they could have been real jerks." 
As to the absence of OBUD from the supervision of these elections, Cintron said the departure had had no signifi­cant effect. "The elections were fair, even without OBUD. 
They went as smoothly as they could have gone, given what happened." 
She said counting the votes and enforcing the election rules without OBUD had posed no great problems, with the tabulations of Tuesday's elec­tions being finished by 9 p.m. 
One incident that could have proven to be a problem was the failure to detect an ineligible candidate until shortly before the elections, she said. This she ascribed to a fault of OBUD, however. 
Cintron did not speculate whether efforts would be made to have OBUD supervise future elections. 
Cintron with Student Body President Mike Switek, Stu­dent Body Vice President Don Montanaro, Student Body President-elect Pat Cooke and members of the student senate collected and tabulated the bal­lots in OBUD's place.

Study: Balloons don't stop surgery 
Associated Press 
NEW Orleans-The use of tiny balloons to unclog heart ar­teries is growing dramatically, but it seems to have done little to cut into the high prevalence of expensive coronary bypass surgery, a study has found. 
The non-surgical procedure, known as angioplasty, is being done on increasingly sicker patients with better results, re­searchers found. 
However, the researchers say that while angioplasty was used on 150,000 Americans last year, bypass surgery was per­formed on 250,000 Americans in the same period. 
Both angioplasty and bypass surgery are performed to relieve obstructions in the cri­tical arteries that feed the heart muscle. These blockages can contribute to heart attacks, and their major symptom is chest pain called angina. 

The first angioplasty was performed 10 years ago. By 1979, it was conducted on 3,000 people, usually those with a single narrowing of one coro­nary artery. That grew to 60,000 people in 1984, 100,000 in 1985 and 150,000 last year. 
In several papers presented this week at the annual meeting of the American College of Car­diology, researchers described the results of a large followup of angioplasty sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute that examined differences in angioplasty be­tween 1980 and 1985. 
Dr. Katherine Detre of the University of Pittsburgh said the statistics show that an­gioplasty is being performed on people with far more advanced heart disease than it was in the early days, and that results continue to improve. 
The procedure was success­ful 87 percent of the time in 1985, compared with 67 percent five years earlier. 
Despite the more compl­icated cases, the death rate is the same--about 1 percent. And the need for emergency bypass operations to rescue patients from unsuccessful angioplasty fell from 6 percent of cases to 4 percent. 
"Angioplasty is being done in much more severely a~fected patients, and it's more success­ful. It's a good news story," said Dr. Eugene Passamani of the heart institute.

Students give gift of life to Central Blood Bank 
KENDRA MORRILL features writer 
A 
little over a year and a half ago, Notre Dame student Kevin Hurley was critically in­jured while crossing U.S. 31. In immediate need of a blood transfusion, he did not have time to call his friends or fam­ily back home in Massachusetts to ask for their help. He received the blood he needed, though, and today is alive and along the road to recuperation. Very possibly, the blood of Notre Dame students or St. 
"Some people may feel that donating blood is unsafe because of the rumors about AIDS; Quinn terms this fear 'absolutely felonious." 
Joseph county residents saved Kevin's life. 
Dr. Gerald Quinn, medical director for the Central Blood Bank of the South Bend Medi­cal Foundation, related this Incident In which a Notre Dame student received what many others have given so freely -· life-saving blood. The Central Blood Bank provides needed blood to accident victims, sur­gery patients, those undergo­Ing cancer chemotherapy treat­ment and others who may require trasfuslons. 
Quinn described how one donated unit of blood can be broken down Into three seperate components  red cells, platelets and plasma. Each component serves a dif­ferent purpose. Red blood cells can be given to surgery patients or accident victims to replace cells they lose through bleeding during the operation or through wounds. Red blood cells and platelets, which are tiny cells that promote clotting, are often needed by cancer patients undergoing chemot­herapy. 
Potent and toxic chemicals destroy red cell, white cell, and platelet manufacture. Bone marrow, which contains the most active cells, "gets wiped out," Quinn said. "the cells are vastly reduced In number and (the cancer patients) can't fight day to day exposure to viruses that you and I can. They need blood donors to get them over crises." 

Plasma contains various blood proteins. Individuals who suffer from severe liver disease cannot make certain plasma proteins and require occasional plasma replacement. Plasma has an added benefit in that it can be stored frozen for a long period o! time, and after thawing (In about 20 minutes) has the same effect as if it were donated that day. Whole blood has a shelf life of 35 days, but the proteins begin to deteriorate in five to seven days. 
According to Quinn, 114 units of blood must be donated to arrive at 100 usable units. Donated units have to pass a "pretty Intense screening process," and not all blood passes the required tests. Among the tests are an AIDS antibody screening, a syphilis test, and surrgogate tests for non-A and non-B type hepatitis. 
Acceptable blood Is taken from healthy 17 to 65-year-olds who have not had hepatitis and are not In an AIDS-at-risk group (homosexual males or Intravenous drug abusers). 
With all the rumors about AIDS, some people may feel that donating blood Is unsafe because It poses a risk of con­tracting the disease. Quinn terms this fear "absolutely felonious." He says It Is vir­tually Impossible to contract AIDS through donating blood. The needles are completely sterile and are discarded after each use. He adds, however, that there Is a very slim risk of contracting AIDS by receiving blood. The reason for this Is that a person can acquire the virus, yet the detectable an­tibody will not develop im­nmediately. That person could donate blood without the an­tibody being detected. "The chances of this happening are extremely remote but they do exist," said Quinn. 
In 1986, the blood bank drew about 16,400 units of blood (each unit is equivalent to a pint) from St. Joseph County residents, collecting from both the South Bend Medical Foundation on Lafayette Street and from various "remotes", said Quinn. 
Remote draws, he explained, are held at different locations in St. Joseph County. Notre Dame is one of these remotes and with a donation of 532 units In 1986 is the largest contributor. Another remote is the St. Joseph Medical Center, which donated 164 units In 
1986. 
The number of units of blood collected each year at Notre Dame has been steadily In­creasing since 1983, Quinn said. 193 pints were collected 
"In 1986, the blood bank drew about 16,400 units from St. Joseph County residents." 
In 1983, 386 in 1984, 506 In 1985, and 532 In 1986. The numbers may very well con­tinue to Increase In 1987, es­pecially since a major blood drive has begun on both North and South Quads. Stanford has challenged any North Quad dorm to exceed the amount of blood it collects, said Stuart Steichen, who is In charge of Stanford's blood drive. 
Similarly, Alumni has issued the same challenAe to South Quad dorms. Quinn cites Alumni as the "strongest dorm," donating 140 out of the 
532 units collected at Notre Dame last year. Alumni also Initiated the process of the blood bank coming right to the dorms, rather than the stu­dents having to go the Infir­mary as was done In the past. Quinn feels that students seem to respond better to something when It Is familiar to them, which makes the dorm a com­fortable environment In which to give blood. 

Maureen Trubac Is the blood bank's recruiting director and has been Instrumental In set­ting up drives In the dorms at Notre Dame. Any halls that want to respond to Stanford's and Alumni's challenges should contact her at the South Bend Medical Foundation Central Laboratory as soon as possible. 
While donating blood Is now done strictly on a volunteer basis, orlor to 1974 donors 
were paid $25 for each unit donated. Quinn said donating used to be a source of some revenue for "good, loyal, clean, paid donors" in St. Joseph County. However, in bigger cities such as New York and Los Angeles, the people who would donate blood for $25 "weren't the caliber of individ­uals you'd want in your blood bank." The Federal Govern­ment urged blood banks not to accept paid donors. Quinn said this made It more difficult, and that "Notre Dame students were many times the recipients of the $25." 
How does the bank now elicit a respone from students and other potential donators? Quinn believes It appeals to a sense of altruism and sympa­thy. Initially, he said, the reac­tion to donating blood may be negative. One may realize that there Is a mild Inconvenience, but then considers how trivial this Is compared to the fact that he or she Is participating In the saving of lives. "Weigh­Ing gain versus cost," Quinn stated, "you say 'It's not that bad after all, is it?" 
Notre Dame students should be strongly commended for their support of the blood bank. said Quinn. If he had one message to send to Notre Dame students, It would be that they have "a lot to be proud of. There's a lot of ap­preciative people out there." One need only look at the ex­ample of one Notre Dame stu­dent who Is alive today be­cause others unselfishly gave a little bit of themselves.

Irish sabremen Geoff Rossi (right) is a key cing team's title at the NCAA Fencing Cham­player in Irish hopes to defend the men's fen-pionships next week at the ACC. 
Golfers tee off season in Orlando 
By ORLANDO RUBIANO Sports Writer 
With spring just around the corner, the Notre Dame golf team took advantage of last weekend's warm weather to prepare for their trip down to Orlando, Fla., during break. The Irish will see their first ac­tion since the fall when they join 12 other schools at the Uni­versity of Central Florida for a three-day, 54-hole tournament. 
Coach Noel O'Sullivan, in his 14th season as the headman, is very optimistic about the up­coming spring season. 
"We had a super fall season, and in the past that has usually been followed by a good spring outing," remarked O'Sullivan. 
The Irish compiled a 29-3 slate over the fall, and the team average was just below a 76. In addition, the club garnered two first-place victories and one second-place finish. O'Sullivan feels that his squad needs around a 75-average to be con­sidered a good team. 
While in Orlando, the team will shoot two practice rounds before beginning play on March 18th. . Among the entrants, other Midwest schools participating include Purdue, Bradley, N. Illinois, Wisconsin, as well as several Florida schools. The tourna­ment will be held on three sep­arate championship courses (Rio Pinar C.C, Tuscawillo C.C., and Orange Tree C.C.). 
O'Sullivan's reasons for a successful campaign can be counted on one hand. His five starters, only one a senior, have O'Sullivan convinced that this is not a rebuilding year, but a continuation of last year's efforts. Despite losing four seniors from a year ago, the coach feels that the current roster can get the job done. 

"Our captain, senior Chris Bona," said O'Sullivan, is my number-one guy, because his leadership on and off the course is valid and proven." 
Following Bona is sopho­more Pa,t Mohan, who came to the forefront last fall after win­ning the Notre Dame Open with a 73-average. O'Sullivan says that Mohan has the skill and potential to be an excellent gol­fer. 
Sophomore Doug Giorgo, who was the only freshman to start last season, is third on the roster. Giorgio was the second­best fall performer, averaging around 75. Junior Dick Connel­ly, with two years of varsity ex­perience on the links, is ex­pected to help Irish hopes. Connelly suffered from a bad wrist last fall that kept him out of two events. When he did see action, O'Sullivan called his play (75-average) inspiring. 
"Dick's absence probably made a difference in how our team finished overall in those tournaments," said O'Sullivan. 
The last, but certainly not least, piece of the puzzle is none other than John Connelly, who­O'Sullivan termed as the fresh­man sensation. Connelly is the only freshman starting on the club, and brings a 76-average from the Fall. 
Once the Irish return from their Florida trip, the next scheduled stop will take them to Richmond, Ky. (E. Ken­tucky Univ.) on the weekend of March 27-29.

continued/rom page 16 
"The first day will be the key day for us, because that's when the seeding will take place. If the girls get through the first couple of teams and relax, then they'll be ready to compete for first place." 
Sullivan is wary of the atten­tion that she will be getting as the defending champion. 
"I'm a little nervous about it, but I'm not hysterical about the tournament," said the junior two-time all-American. "I'd really like to win it again. I've been doing a lot better this year, and my record doesn't show how I'm fencing." 
The men will be defending their team championship but will have to overcome a host of talented teams to reclaim the title. Columbia will be the team to beat in the tournament, fueled by sabremen Robert Cottingham and Chris Reohr, 
and  foilists  Mark  Kent  and  
William Mirdel.  
"Columbia  has  to  be  the  

odds-on favorite this year," said DeCicco. They have more people returning from last year than any team ever, possibly with the exception of Penn. 
"But we're not just going to let them win the national cham­pionship and take it away from the rest of us. I think that with Kevin (Stoutermire) and Jeff (Rossi) , the results of the first day will be very indicative of what goes on in the tourna­ment." 
The Irish have Rossi and Stoutermire in the sabre, Tim Vaughn and Todd Griffee in the epee, and Yehuda Kovacs and Charles Higgs-Coulthard in the foil. 
And as it has been all year, the success of the team rests squarely on the shoulders of the "weak-link" epeeists. But Vaughn and Griffee are ready. 
"I've been a good fencer who's been stuck in a mediocre plateau," said Griffee. "I need to go out there and fence rather than fight the man. If I fight the man, I wind up losing my concentration. But I want this one bad." 
Vaughn, who is practicing with tendonitis in his right foot, is still up for the meet. 
"My foot could fall off and I'd still fence next weekend," said the senior from North An­dover, MA. IRISH ITEMS Charles Higgs­Coulthard collected points in a circuit event for the World Uni­versity games by finishing 21st in Los Angeles. Higgs­Coulthard missed the Great Lakes Championships to attend the meet ... Senior Cindy Weeks will be the alternate women's competitor at the NCAA's... Men's fencing will begin at 9 a.m. each day in the North Dome of the ACC. Wo­men's team competition begins at 2 p.m. next Thursday and Friday.

truth books do it Bobby Knight. 
The fact is, Louisville has done little this entire season to make anyone believe it is a tournament-caliber team. 
Crum's tantrum may have a positive effect on the Irish. The surprising success of this year's team has people won­dering what the team will ac­complish next, rather than waiting for it to do what is ex­pected of them. We all remem­ber how that attitude ended last season. 
While Irish head coach Dig­ger Phelps and his staff scramble to look at Blue Raider footage, the environment is more to their liking. The tur­moil surrounding Middle Ten­nessee's inclusion in the tourn­ament takes the spotlight off the Irish, and will allow them to concentrate on playing the way they have shown they are capable of. 
Though the Irish find quite a task facing them in their region, they have shown the ability to play with anyone. Whether the Thundering Herd of Marshall, or the Horned Frogs of TCU greet them, or the mighty Tar Heels or even the Boilermakers of Purdue, the Irish have a shot to be the underdog, planning its assault from the shadows, throughout the tournament, whether it is because they are a lower seed, or have a less-bizarre nick­name. 
And if the results of this rags­to-riches season are any indi­cation, that's just where they would prefer to be.

East Coast swing to provide challenge for lacrosse team 
By CHRIS DALLAVO Sports Writer 
Look out lax lovers, the Irish are back. 
The 1987 Notre Dame lacrosse team, led by senior co­captains Dave O'Neill and Wally Stack, is ready to defend its Great Lakes Lacrosse Con­ference co-championship, but the road looks rocky. 
Head Coach Rich O'Leary's squad lost over fifty percent of its goal production to gradua­tion, but he remains optimistic about the coming year.

Hilton Head next stop for women's tennis 
By SHEILA HOROX Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's tennis team takes a working vacation of sorts as it travels to Hilton Head, S.C., for spring break. The Irish will face several tough opponents in this sunny vacation attraction as they meet Louisville, Rutgers, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Auburn. 
With the exception of Louis­ville, the Irish will be facing these teams for the first time. Head Coach Michele Gelfman isn't quite sure what to expect in terms of competition, but

definitely hurts," noted O'Leary, "but it just means that everyone has to work that much harder. We will have no stars this year. It will have to be a total team effort." 
The rebuilt attack unit of the Irish, the stomping grounds last year of both Grote and Franklin, will have to deliver for the team to succeed. Taking over will be senior Jim Shields, last year's third leading scorer, and sophomore John Olmstead. 
"Shields and Olmstead, along with Jeff Shay and John McLachlan, should provide the backbone of our attack unit," continued O'Leary. "I have 
that doesn't affect her own team's expectations. 
"The team is striving for a 5-0 record," said Gelfman. "In singles, we're looking to play an aggressive serve-and-volley game, and the doubles teams are what will pull us through the tough matches." 
The doubles tandems that Gelfman is counting on feature co-captain Michelle Dasso and Alice Lohrer at the number-one spot, Stephanie Tolstedt and Natalie Illig slated second and co-captain Tammy Schmidt and Resa Kelly comprising the third team. 
"The emphasis is on winning as a team," said Assistant Coach Steve Simone. "If one of the players isn't in a match, she's on the sidelines cheering for her teammate to win. 
"We're finding out that we've got the talent to beat some good teams. Just because a team is stronger than us doesn't mean we can't beat them. We're starting to think to ourselves, 'We're a good team too.' " 
Taking the courts for the Irish in singles action will be Dasso, followed by Tolstedt, Lohrer, Schmidt, Illig, and Kel­ly. 
confidence that they will get the job done." 
The Irish are stronger at the midfield position, where a wealth of players with experi­ence return. Heading the unit will be three-time monogram winner O'Neill and senior Kevin Cullinan. Also playing crucial roles will be juniors John Burtis, Tom Lanahan, Art Brady and John McNicholas, while sophomore John Flick­enger and freshman Mike Quigley will contend for playing time. 
"We have a great deal of depth at midfield," stated O'Leary. "We hope to get more scoring from the midfield spots to help out the attack. Our scoring will be much more balanced because we are employing more of a team con­cept." 
If a strong defense indicates a good team, then the Irish should be awesome. The defense, led by Stack and fel­low seniors Jim Fallon and Dick Milone, (a total of eight monograms between them), will be the strongest in years. Add to that nucleus talented sophomores Brendan Cahill and Kevin O'Connor, and the future looks pretty stingy. 
"We have so much talent on defense that it allows us to spe­cialize in certain situations," O'Leary said. 
Who will be in goal remains a bit of a question mark for the Irish, as returning starter Matt McQuillan is currently academically ineligible. O'Leary is hopeful McQuillan will become eligible prior to the season, pending a grade change. If not, the duties will fall to freshman Jeff Glazier. 
The Irish open their season over break with a swing around the East Coast, playing Rad­ford, Washington & Lee and Villanova.

The World Wrestling Federation will conduct a live taping of its Saturday Night's Main Event at the Notre Dame Athletic and Convocation Center, The Observer learned earlier this week. 
The NBC show, which periodically pre-empts Saturday Night Live, will be taped on April 28th and aired May 2nd. This marks the second time that the WWF has taped an event at the ACC. Last Nov. 19th, the WWF taped a card in front of over 12,000 people for its weekly syndicated show. 
March 29th, the ACC will have a closed-circuit link for WrestleMania III, the second time the ACC has done so. In the spring of 1985, Stepan Center sold out when it provided a closed-circuit showing of the first WrestleMania. 
According to William Datre of the WWF, all of the organizations top stars should be in at­tendance. As of late Tuesday, the official card had not been set.

WNDU to broadcast ND's first-round game 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
If you're not heading for Charlotte, N.C., or on your way to Florida, WNDU (channel16) announced Tuesday that it 
NCAA Tournament 
The Road to Bourbon Street 
would broadcast live Notre Dame's game against Middle Tennessee St. in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. 
ESP:r;.T had announced Sun­day that it also would air the game live, with . tipoff sched­uled for 2:37p.m. EST. 
If you are heading for Char­lotte and don't have tickets, be prepared to pay scalper's prices. The Charlotte Coliseum, which seats 11,666, is completely sold out, according to Notre Dame Ticket Manager Mike Bobinski. All of Notre Dame's allotment of 250 tickets were sold here, and Bobinski said Tuesday that the rest of the Coliseum seating was sold out as well. 
The Irish left for Charlotte early yesterday evening. They will practice at 1 p.m. today on the Coliseum floor. 
One of the big stories coming out of the Notre Dame Sports Information Department yes­terday was the wearing of the latest sports fashion state­ments, the fish tie. After Sports Information Intern Andy O'Brien wore the tie, which 


resembles a dead Muskie, to Notre Dame's victory over Wagner, Irish head coach Dig­ger Phelps wore the tie during his squad's defeat of Brooklyn College last Monday. 
The tie has since won two more games. South Bend Tribune basketball writer For­rest Miller wore it as the Irish downed Miami, and women's Assistant Coach Bill Fennely wore it as both his squad and the men's team took victories from Dayton. 
Now the tie, which can best be described as polyester, is in demand and is booked through­out the NCAA Tournament, Re­quests have also begun to come in for the football season. 
The moral of this fish tail is that as a big event gets closer, the hype and trivia increases daily. 
Women fencers hope to keep DeCicco's vow at NCAA's 
By TERRY LYNCH Sports Writer 
Trying to predict what ex­actly is going to happen in next weekend's NCAA National Fencing Championships at the ACC is a lot like, well, taking a stab in the dark. 
But if you throw some of the class fencers from Notre Dame into a tournament of any kind, you can be pretty sure that something's going to happen. So far this season, that some­thing has been winning. 

The Irish will face the 'ul­timate test when the best of the collegiate ranks will be around from March 16 throught the 21st. The men will fence from the 16th to the 18th, while the women will take the strip from the 19th to the 21st. 
The women's team has a strong possibility of winning a national championship, and to fencing coach Mike DeCicco, bringing home a title for the women will be the fulfillment of a 16-year old promise. 
"I promised (Vice Presi­dent) Father (Edmund) Joyce, on the day he called me into his office and asked me if our wo­men were ready to be elevated to varsity status, that we would be ready whenever he wanted us to be ready," said DeCicco. 
"I made him a promise that if he made the women's fencing team the very first women's team on this campus that we'd win a national championship," continued DeCicco. "Well, we gave him individual champion last year--Molly Sullivan--who was the first women's cham­pion we'd ever had here at Notre Dame. Hopefully this year we can do it with the team. 
"If we can win it while Fa­ther Joyce is still our executive vice-president and the one who really started this whole thing and believed in us, it'll be an especially nice thing for us to do." 
The women are going into the tournament with defending NCAA Champion Molly Sul­livan, along with Janice Hynes, Anne Barreda, and Kristin Kralicek. The team will face stiff competition from Temple (whom the Irish defeated 9-7 earlier this season), Columbia and Yale in the tournament. 
"It won't be easy," said wo­men's head coach Yves Auriol. "But right now we're a solid, well-balanced team. We're working hard and have been fencing as a team. Kristin has some experience, but she should be pretty nervous. As a freshman, Anne Barreda will probably be nervous, too.
