KAVANAUGH TELLS OF DATED MORALITY 
Just what has brought James Kavanaugh from the timid I 6 year old seminarian "who fol­lowed the law to the letter," to the crusading rebel who last week rejected both his priest­hood and the institution of his Church? 
Throughout his talk last Sun­day at Notre Dame and in an interview with this reporter, he alluded to incidents in his 39 years that have led him this way or that. 
His very decision to make the announcement of his resignation at Notre Dame stemmed from his childhood in Kalamazoo, Mich., where he was one of sev­en boys. "If we were good, my father would take a couple of us to a game up here. Notre Dame was our way of saying that we were as good as anyone else. It was sort of the local Vatican. We used to come and watch Notre Dame beat Carnegie Tech then you've got the faith! I'd stand up and say, 'Boy, I'm glad I'm Catholic.' " 
Two tickets to the Notre Dame-Southern California foot­ball game were Kavanaugh's pay for his lecture, and he didn't get much chance to scream his lungs out there. Southern Cal whipped the Fighting Irish 24-7. 
He said he accepted the invi­tation to speak at Notre Dame {he refused several hundred since the publication of his book), because Notre Dame represented the defensiveness of the old Church, "and I hope it will be­come the new Church. From what I've seen I think it may.'' 
Raised in a non-Catholic nei­ghborhood where he was "perse­cuted for our Catholic faith," he attended the parish grammar school. 
By age 16 he was in a semina­ry, where he kept a daily diary. Reflecting on this diary, he said, "When I read the diary ... I can­not believe that I was that man. I had no emotions." 
"The old Church epitomized my psyche," he said. "Just like the Church, I never asked ques­tions, I never entertained doubts and I never missed Mass." 
In his book, A Modern Priest Looks at His Outdated Church, he offers a detailed account of his 13 years as a priest, years of personal crisis and conflict. They were years of feeling and believ­ing "yes," but of conforming to what he terms the impersonal "no" of the Church. For James Kavanaugh the priest, they were frustrating years. 
And then he could remain si­lent no longer. A year and a half ago, he published an article in the Saturday Evening Post enti­tled "I Am a Priest. I Want to Get Married." He said he was asked by "a number of priest friends who were involved with women -and were damn good priests -to write such an article. I was not involved with a woman at the time. I had met women, but had never permitted the rela­tionship to continue." 
What finally convinced him to write it, he said, was "a priest who was married and had five children. He very tearfully asked me to write the article.'' 

Senate Reveals '68 Purpose 
The first Student Senate mee­ting of the year Monday night, though of an organizational na­ture, was highlighted by the pre­sentation of several new plans and ideas by the stay senators. These ideas, in the areas of Human Affairs, Academic Aff­airs, and Hall Life, should pro­vide a nucleus for much Com­mittee and Senate business the coming year. 
Human Affairs Stay Senator Rich Rossie centered his pre­sentation on minority problems, both at Notre Dame and in South Bend. He spoke of the interest of the Committee on 
Minority Enrollment in getting students of Mexican origin from the Southwest at Notre Dame. He also spoke of establishing a committee on Protestant and Jewish students at Notre Dame, to examine and solve whatever problems these individuals might have at a predominently Catho­lic university. 
Phil Rathweg, Academic Aff­airs Senator, promised that a course evaluation booklet will be in the hands of the students by February. He forsaw changes in the cut system and progress in the area of pass-fail, too, speaking of the interest of Aca­demic Affairs Vice President Fr. Walsh in each of those areas. Finally, Rathweg was optimistic 
as  to  the  progress of the  Free  by  Christmas.  Looking  furthe1

Sp~ce Program "0ne of Best" Libby· 
Dr. Willard F. Libby, Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, said Monday night that Vietnam war costs must not be permitted to cause cutbacks in scientific ex­ploration. In his Library audito­rium address, Libby stressed the space program, calling it "one of the best bargains the country ever had.'' The benefits of the program, Libby stated, necessi­
tate its continuation. Libby stre­ssed the application of man's in­telligence to his environment, proclaiming this to be man's primary role in life. 
"It isn't enough to discover knowledge, and then file it a­way," he said. "It must be re­duced to practical applications." He used Great Britain as an ex­ample of where knowledge is be­ing "filed away", but cited Ja­pan, China and West Germany as nations where knowledge is be­ing applied to economic and social needs.

After completing the article, he said he "sat on it for a year before publishing it.'' He said other magazines were interested in publishing it, but they insisted that he use his name. When plans were made with the Saturday Evening Post to print it anony­mously, Kavanaugh said, "I pro­tected myself like a gestapo.'' He described the intricate system of pseudonyms and multiple post office boxes used to insure his anonymity. 
It was the response to this ar­ticle that inspired his outspoken book. He said favorable criticism for the book has outnumbered that of detractors by a ratio of 20-1. 
In speaking of marriage, he said, "Although I have no defi­nite plans as yet, I will definitely marry. I don't know how I, as a man, can find God and meaning without marriage. I need the close personal relationship of a woman. I need it and I intend to have it.'' 
Currently on a leave of ab­sence from the diocese of Lans­ing, Mich., the notoriously can­did priest has spent the past year working as a child, family, and marriage counselor at the Hum­an Resources Institute in La Jol­la, California. He said of his year away: "I've never been more sa­tisfied. It's been a strained year, a hectic year, but I've never been happier." 
"So, I'll leave," he said, "al­though not without misgivings, but I'll be a Christian. I will try to find a community and in my own way will search for God. I will admit my own strengths and weaknesses and will find God, for in Him I know there is truth. I have learned not to fear the judgment of men." 
"My kind must leave your in­stitution. My kind must walk a­way, because we have lost the faith, or something like that. We must leave the parish because we 
leave, Kavanaugh spoke of his 
love  people  and  must  cling  to  
Christ."  
In  discussing his  decision  to

reasons for entering the semina­ry: "One thing that drew me to the priesthood was the desire to help people find God and them­selves and to discover their own capacity for love, self-respect and responsibility. This is what Christianity is all about." 
"I will remain a priest in my own way even as I leave the in­stitutional priesthood," he said, and described his counseling work in La Jolla as what "is probably now my priesthood." 
He said he will "work with the Church, but not within it. I will respect the general princi­ples of Christianity and the a­wareness of Christ that they have given me." 
"So, now I'm just another man," said Kavanaugh. ''I'm not an ideal, I'm no longer another Christ, I'm just another man." 
"I must now listen to voices that know not Rome and I must look into eyes that seek love. My story is one of a manhood redis­cvvered. It is beauty, it is the beginning of life."

But it was plain that they didn't really know. "What kind of people are the demonstrators?" said the reporter from the Washington Post. Are they from the center of the student body, or are they on the fronges? They couldn't decide whether everybody was getting their ticket paid for by some commie front.

Preparations for the 1968 
Notre Dame Mock Republican 
Convention have begun m earn­
est. Although the Convention is 
not to be held until March, work 
is presently being done in the 
areas of platform research, can­
didates' organizations, and con­
vention organizatiOn. 
Mary Lou Gallagher of St. 
Mary's heads the group research­
ing the platform. The aim of this 
group is to gather together the 
proposals of different G.O.P. 
Presidential possibilities and, in addition, find the stand of each on the major prospective issues of '68. The Notre Dame Young Republicans are, on an indivi­dual basis, doing much of the re­search on the platform. 
The organization of the cam­paign is m full swing, with the lead so far being taken in the Hatfield and Romney camps. The Hatfield speech two weeks ago spurred much interest, es­pecially in the area of a Repub­lican alternative on Vietnam. Se­nior Ed Kickham, who organized students to go out to the airport to greet the Senator on his arri­val, is going ahead with plans for a full-scale Hatfield effort keyed to Vietnam. 
Also in the running are the Romney forces, so far under the lead of Mike Kelly, a student senator and official of the Mid­west Federation of Young Re­publicans. From working this past summer in Washington, Ke­lly has contacts with the nation­al Romney organization. From these contacts, he will get pro­fessional advice and funds, both in very limited quantities. A measure of the importance of the Notre Dame Convention is the fact that ours will be the one such event to receive money from the national Romney cam­paign forces. 
In the convention organiza­tion, three men are concentrat­ing their efforts. Senior Tom McCloskey, defeated last year for the presidency of the Young Democrats, is now heading work on the candidates' organizations for the Republican Mock Con­vention. Tom Chema is handling the convention organization it­self, the details involved in arran­gements and procedures. 
Academic Commissioner Chuck Nau also figures in the Convention picture, both in his official capacity and as Conven­tion Publicity Chairman. Nau is in charge of lining up speakers. Senator Hatfield's speech on Vi­etnam and the Republican Party

11 continued from page 1 When questioned yesterday afternoon, Col­onel Victor Ferrari, Commander of the local Air Force ROTC establishment indicated that he and his officers were under strict regulations which prohibited them from participating in any campus events that would purport to be influ­encing national political policy. He attempted to find the order specifying this, but later ad­mitted that "I don't have anything in my hands that say we cannot participate in campus events ... but I assure you that I am going to make some t~leohone calls to fmd out." He said further that he thought the ques­
tionaire was "open-ended", and unscientific. He attacked several of the questions in the survey, particularly number 6, "Would you be 
willing to become personally involved in a move­ment to end this war?" "Which solution does he mean," Ferrari asked, "His own or mine or any­body else's?" 
"If I had complete authority as commander, 
I don't think I would have participated in it any­
way. I don't think it is worthwhile." 
Mr. Cushings when questioned admitted that 
the refusal of the Military Science departments 
to participate "May raise the question, do they 
have academic freedom?" He refused to com­
ment specifically when asked whether there was 
a movement afoot, as rumor has it, that the 
Military Science Department's right to a seat 
in the projected faculty senate will be questioned. 
Colonel Ferrari similarly said that he did not know the specific nature of that suggestion and could not answer it, but made it quite clear that he feels that because they are agentsA t)le President, they are unwilling to integrate them­selves into any campus controversy. 
"We are here as guests on the campus," he said. He also said that while he does not attempt to discourage his Cadets from taking part in any event, he and his officers must realize that they call into question their professional integrity when they involve themselves in any controversy.

Dear Mr. Gallagher,

I hope you enjoy my interpretation of your "Black Tuesday" -please pardon the overwhelming plagerism.

CINEMA FOR '68:SIN & SEX 
BY DAVID KAHN 

The brown and buff Cinema '68 posters are going up all over campus and it seems as if the Film Society's 11th annual film series is one of the best it has ever sponsored. 
So that football interests mi­ght not be deterred, this year's opening will be a late one. La Notte, Antonioni's lyricism at its best, be)!ins the series on the 
11th of November. Cinema '68 has announced that its showings will be largely conducted in Wa­shington Hall and the Center for Continuing Education Audito­rium to provide maximum view­ing comfort. In order to accomo­date everybody's schedule, films will be shown on Saturdays and Sundays at 2 and 8:00pm. How­ever, it is highly recommended that filmgoers avoid the very crowded Saturday evening per­formances. 
Cinema '68 presents a wide­ranged assortment of films in keeping with Film Society's tra­dition selection of a progamme internationale. Features include imports from Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain, Russia, France and India. The Film Society has also concentrated upon making ac­

cessible cinema excellence which has been previously limited to a minority viewing. For an ex­ample, the much praised Before th~ Revolution, made by Italian film prodigy at the preposterous age of 22, will make its premiere in the Mid-West. A rarely seer Vigo film, Zero for Conduct will prove indispensible in de­monstrating the historical influ­ences of the New Wave move­ment. Cinema '68 will also scr­een Muriel, a Resnais master­piece perhaps obscured by his later work, Last Year at Marien­bad. 
Marlene Dietrich fans may meet her before her Hollywood 
tainting in Von Sternberg's clas­
sic, Blue Angel. The peace-man 
might particularly enjoy Clem­
ent's Forbidden Games which Pauline Kael has heralded as the greatest anti-war film ever made. And for those who raivsh vio­lence on the screen, Rocco and His Brothers' repeated stabbings are destined to please. Filmbuff, Business major, Dove, Hawk ­Cinema '68 is sure to entertain and enlighten. 
Ticket information and speci­fic dates are listed on the post­ers. Bring a date to 13 films for the bargain price of $5.50. And for those who are alsa single they may meet that ver; special one at the movies, and for only $3.50. 
The Student-Faculty Film So­ciety is headed this year by Dave Kahn, Marty McNamera, and Bill Siska, and is unler the faculty guidance of Dr. Donald Costello. All those who are interested in working with the Film Society may inquire in person at 440 Morrissey, or call 284-7975 for information.

Burrell Dates Church 
Maintaining a cool optimism about the future of the people who comprise today's Church Father David Burrell. C.S.C., ap­peared neither surprised nor dis­turboo by James Kavanaugh's announcement Friday night that he will leave the priesthood. 
An assistant professor of phil­osophy at Notre Dame, Father Burrell is a frequent contributor to theological publications and journals of opinion. 
In taking sharp exception to the basics of Kavanaugh's creed, Burrell said, "I mean what I say not as a personal attack on Jim Kavanaugh, who is a fellow Chri­stain. I simply see a knight on a 
white charger and I don;t mind showing that the charger is made of paper mache." 
Much of this paper mache is due to Kavanaugh's lack of a sense of humor," said Burrell, who claimed, "His book indica­ted a complete lack of an ability to laugh." 
He added, "One senses that Father Kavanaugh has a personal inability to discover an inner freedom from which he can work. He's waiting for the insti­tution or structure to free him." 
Father Burrell said the "inhu­man structures" described by Kavanaugh "become inhuman only when we take them too ser­iously." He suggested first fmd­ing one's self sufficiently and then "just hanging loose from the structure." 
Characterizing Kavanaugh as .one who "bought the pre-Vati­can II and post-Trent Church ­lock, stock and barrel," the Not­re Dame theologian said, "It's great that people like this are fm­ally feeling themselves free to leave the priesthood. These are the kind of people who appar­ently felt as priests that they had to mouth the prepared state­ments of the Church. And this is the irony of the situation -he is guilty of just what he accuses so many others of -a feeling that one must revert to a set of canned lines and laws. This is the reason he sees the priesthood as 


he does -and if he must see it 
that way, then it is better that 
he leave." 
He suggested that Kavanaugh 

is the "victim of a culture lag... 
he's still waiting for the Church 
to move him, to liberate him, 
instead of realizing that he -and 
we -are the Church and we can 
get together and we, the Church, 
can move." 
Burrell described today as "the post Kavanaugh generation, a Church of clergy, sisters and lay people who are no longer sit­ting around complaining about the fact that they are not per­mitted to do things -they're just doing them.

~------------------------------------~~~~~~~~----------------------------------------~~ 

THERE ARE NO BAD TEACHERS; THERE ARE ONLY BAD STUDENTS 
The academic year has only just begun and already one thing is clear: you're not ready for college. 
What, then, should you do? Should you throw up your hands and quit? I say no! I say you must attack, grapple, cope! I say America did not become the world's leader in motel construction and kidney transplants by running away from a fight!  
To the question then: You say you're not ready for col­lege. You're too green, too naive. You lack maturity. Okay, the answer is simple: get mature. How? Well sir, to achieve maturity you need two things: 
a) 
a probing mind; 

b) 
a vest. 



A probing mind will be quickly yours if you'll remem­ber that education consists not of answers but of ques­tions. Blindly accepting information and dumbly memorizing data is high school stuff. In college you don't just accept. You dispute, you push, you pry, you chal­lenge. If, for instance, your physics prof says, "E equals me squared," don't just write it down. Say to the prof, "Why?" · 
This will show him two things : 
a) 
Your mind is a keen, thrusting instrument. 

b) 
You are in the wrong major. 


Ask questions, questions, and more questions. That is the essence of maturity, the heart and liver of education. Nothing will more quickly convince the teachers that you are of college calibre. And the tougher your questions, the better. Come to class with queries that dart and flash, that make unexpected sallies into uncharted territory. Ask things which have never been asked before, like "How tall was Nietzsche?" and "Did the Minotaur have ticks? If so, were they immortal?" and "How often did Pitt the Elder shave?" 
(Incidentally, you may never know the complete an­swer to Pitt the Elder's shaving habits, but of one thing you can be positive: no matter how often he shaved and no matter what blades he used, he never enjoyed the shaving comfort that you do. I am assuming, of course, that you use Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades, a logical assumption to make when one is addressing col­lege men-which is to say men of perspicacity, discrimi­nation, wit, taste, cognizance, and shrewdness-for Personna is a blade to please the perspicacious, delight the discriminating, win the witty, tickle the tasteful, coddle the cognizer, and shave the shrewd. 
(I bring up Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades be­cause the makers of Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades pay me to write this column, and they are in­clined to sulk if I omit to mention their product. I would not like to see them unhappy, the makers of,~Personna, for they are fine ruddy men, fond of morris da~ing and home brewed root beer, and they make a ·hhi:de that shaves closely and cleanly, nicklessly and haekles$ly, and is sharp and gleaming and durable and availitble both in double-edge style and Injector style. ·.,. 
(And from these same bounteous blademakers comes Burma-Shave, regular or menthol, a lather that out­lathers other lathers, brother. So if you'd rather lather better, and soak your whiskers wetter, Burma-Shave's your answer.) 
But I digress. We have now solved the problem of maturity. In subsequent columns we'll take up other is­sues, equally burning. Since 1953 when this column first started running in your campus paper, we've tackled such thorny questions as "Can a student of 19 find hap­piness with an economics professor of 90 ?" and "Should capital punishment for pledges be abolished?" and "Are room-mates sanitary?" Be assured that in this, our 14th year, we will not be less bold. 
* * * © 1967, Max Shulman 
The makers of Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades (double-edge or Injector) and Burma-Shave (regular or menthol) are pleased (or apprehensive) to bring you another year of Max Shulman's uninhibited, uncen­sored column.

caused our homecoming week­end, heralded as the greatest in ND's history, to fall so short of expectations? Despite admirable efforts on the part of individual halls, the co-ordination of all the individual activities was, at best, disappointing. Where were the ABC cameras pledged to give nationwide coverage to our en­deavors? Why such a startling ~ shortage of hotel rooms for home town honies? And what about the 400 SMC girls who were promised to co-operate with ND students in destroying the Trojans? What happened ... ? 
Many halls are now deeply in debt and are forced to appeal to students in order to pull out of the red. Halls such as Dillon and Walsh were forced to pass the hat in an attempt to make a comeback. The planners of the "Fall of Troy" seem to have in­advertently undermined the Irish. 
As "watchdog" of the student union, the senate is obliged to examine the disaster of Home­coming '67. Added to the pro­blems which arose on the Purdue trip and Homecoming lottery, it seems that there is a great deal of room for improvement. The situation demands a prompt ex­planation.

Carberry Picks College Bowl 
Front Five 
The Notre Dame team which will face Bryn Mawr College of Pennsylvania on the November 4th College Bowl has been selec­ted. Out of more than SO who tried out for the show last sp­ring, only five remain. One mem­ber will be chosen as the team's alternate. The remainder will ta­ke on Bryn Mawr. 
The five team members are well known on campus. Dennis Gallagher, a Senior English ma­jor from Oswego, New York, is Executive Editor of the Observer and ND correspondent for Time­
Life. William Luking is this year's Academic Commission Gabfest chairman. Luking is a 
Junior History major from Con­
norsville, Indiana. 
Greg Adolf, a Sophomore and also a History major, provides the team with its second journal­ist. Adolf, from Phoenix, Ari­zona, was an organizer of Breen Phillip's hall newspaper, the Pace Setter. Richard Libowitz, also a Sophomore and an English ma­jor, works for WSND and is on the track team. Libowitz is from Stamford, Connecticut. Round­ing out the team is Thomas Spinrad, a pre-med major from 
Albany, New York. Spinrad has been an activist in the Pentacost­al movement on campus. 
Dr. James J. Carberry, Profe­ssor of Chemistry, has coached the team since tryouts began in 
May. Stress is on this year's Col­lege Bowl team because when Notre Dame last appeared on from England and McGill from Canada, have been invited to the conference. 

Each university will give a presentation on a major topic of university interest. McCauley wi­ll speak on "The search for iden­tity in leadership." The purpose of the conference is to bring to­gether student representatives to examine the future role of the university in society as seen by the students. Notre Dame's part­icipation assumes greater signifi­gance in the fact that, as with 
some  major conferences,  is the  
one  Catholic  university  to  be  
invited.  

Alumni leaders from Rensse­laer plus leading public speakers will participate in the conference. Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon will deliver the major address of the conference Saturday morn­ing. Also on the program is Mel Elfin, Senior Editor of News­week. 
McCauley stresses the import­ance of the RPI conference as the first major conference of stu­dent government leaders this aca­demic year. Also important is the participation of foreign universi­ties. To McCauley the conferen­ce will be a major source of new

Here's a question for you, sports fans -What game is played after the baseball season is over? Basketball, of course. Just three days after the last b!lbble had burst in Fenway collegiate hoop­sters take to the courts in earnest. At Notre Dame, if all goes well, the season could last until somebody has clinched the Cactus league title. 
The Irish optimism as they head into practice is based on the return of three topflight junior performers from last year's 14 -12 squad: Bob Arnzen, Bob Whitmore, and Dwight Murphy: Arnzen, who was the leading Irish scorer last year, will be back at his forward position. Whit­more has a lock on the job at center and Murphy will have a starting role at a backcourt slot. 
Whitmore, incedently, has brought some of his freshmen playmates back from D.C. which should make this winter's prelims enjoyable for local cage fururologists. 
The other two posts are open for the moment. Seniors Jim McKirchy and Brian Keller are ex­pected to fight it out with sophmore John Gal­lagher for Jim Monahan's old forward job. Junior Jim Derrig and sophomore Mike O'connell are leading candidates for the other guard position. Others slated to see considerable action include George Restovich and Mike Franger.

IRISH TAKE UP ILLINI GAUNnET 
BY TERRY O'NEIL 

Notre Dame, in general, and Quarterback Terry Hanratty, in particular, attempt a comeback at 1:30 p.m. Saturday when the Irish journey to Champaign for an engagement with Illinois.

It dropped ND out of the Top 10 in both wire service polls for the first time in two years. Hanratty had an especially bad day. In slightly more than three periods, he completed only I 0 of 23 passes, tossed five in­terceptions and rushed five times for just II yards. As if that

Before the game Coach John McKay had complained about the noise in the house that Rock built. Calling signals against that crowd was like whispering in a hurricane or making sign language in the dark. It was bad enough having to play Notre Dame with­
out bucking its crowd as well. But McKay's Trojans overcame that obstacle even though the cheering never stopped. Steve Sogge got his message across and 
O.J. Simpson heard it three times too often. They added insult to injury, salt to the wound, throughout the second half. The crowd was stunned but still loud. 
Not all of the crowd was loud, however, and not all of the crowd seemed to care. The flower children were there sitting up above the band between the twenty and the twenty-five. They were arrayed in all their splender: cast off Army drabs, cowboy boots, and mod caps. They were sitting in the stands whild Notre Dame lost to Southern Cal and they were reflecting on the moon. 
When Southern Cal's team was announced, they didn't join in the "Who's he?" chant. When Notre Dame stopped that first charge and took over, they were discussing a sit-in. And when Notre Dame scored, when the Victory March was being sung, they were still seated, complacent and uncaring, although before them the game of the year played itself into tragedy. They couldn't have cared less and the Irish couldn't have needed their cheers more. 
At the pep rally, Notre Dame had promised its team sixty min­utes of cheering for sixty minutes of football. Frank Leahy had spoken of patriotism and Irish hearts had looked forward to the next afternoon. They hadn't saved their voices that Friday night but they were ready to make John McKay's team run in circles next afternoon. 
Not the flower children. They were gathering the sun. During the late minutes of the third quarter the sections around them stood up. They chanted, "We never give up, we never give up," and smiles returned to their faces as they tried to instill in their team what they believed should be. One section remained seated and stood out like a sore thumb, like Koolaid on a white shirt. 
One section came to talk and not to yell, to watch and not to hope, to withdraw and not to commune. Coach John McKay should have seen them. He would have known that at Notre Dame things are changing, that in the house Rock built quarterbacks can talk. 
Less than one hundred oer cent hung on the Irish efforts. Less than one hundred per cent--brought their team out of the huddle. Less than one hundred per cent went out ot their minds when Terry Hanratty sliced over. A team that had promised and given it!f six minutes was shortchanged. You wonder if it was noticed .
