McKenna's tap class entertains crow.ds with dance numbers in South Dining Hall 

By KAITLYNN RIELY ·Associate News Editor 
The hall where studenl<> normal­ly sit and eat was transf(Jrmed into a song and dance concert stage WednPsday night, as the 72 mem­bers of Professor James· McKenna's tap dance class soft shoed and Shirley TempiPd to sev­eral choreographfld numbers. 
Dressed in white tops, black pants and tap shoes, the tap dancers showed off the moves they l!~arned during the semester, from the "Bob Hope time step," to an Irish jig and the "reach for the moon" move. 
For 40 minutes, they tapped in front of a large crowd that gath­ered in the east wing of South Dining Hall. They opened and closed with Michael Jackson's "The Way You Make Me Feel" and per­formed other numbers in between. 
Prior to the first tap dancing cla...:;s in AugUst, McKenna told the audience, 90 percent of the stu­denL<> had never even seen a pair of tap shoes before, let alone per­formed a dance. 
"It's so funny, every semester at the beginning of the course, I show the students the dances they will learn," he said, sitting in his office a few hours before the recital. "And they all laugh and say, 'Oh right, we're going to learn that."' 
But he reassures them that three months from the start of cla...:;s, they will know the songs. 
"And it's true," he said. "They all learn it."

'Tis the season for the sound of Christmas songs and the smell of Christmas cookies. And 'tis the season for Christmas decorations to adorn campus buildings. 
But with strands of lights hanging in dorm hallways, individual dorm rooms and dining halls, it should come as no surprise that the Christmas season is also one of increased energy use. 
While in the grand scheme of things Christmas lights are not s-ignificantly high-energy users, there are a few ways to decrease the amount of ener­gy used during the Christmas season, said senior Lourdes Long, president of GreeNO and an intern in the Office of Sustainability. 
Long suggested two main ways to decrease energy use regarding Christmas lights ­unplugging Christmas lights when they are not in use, and using Light-emitting diode (LED) lights, which are much more energy efficient. 
"Just like the normal light bulb is no longer efficient, the same is true for Christmas lights. LED lights might be a little more expensive but they are sort of the next wave tech­nology wise," Long said.

NDftuih awarded $lOOk 
By TESS CIVANTOS 
News. Writer 
Freshman Kevin McShane plans to quit his dining hall job, now that he won a $100,000 scholarship­by throwing footballs into a giant Dr Pepper can. 
The scholarship was part of the Dr Pepper half-time footoall chal­lenge. Six grand-prize-winning college students each received a trip for two to either the ACC championship game, the SEC championship game or the Big XII championship game. 
Two of the six Grand Prize win­ners attended each game, where they competed for the scholarship money at half-time. 
McShane chose the Dec. 6 Big XII Championship game, and took his older brother with him. 
"We each had an eight-foot-high Dr Pepper can five yards away, and we each had 10 footballs ­10 shots each," McShane said. 
"It was pretty nerve-wraeking," McShane said. "But it was really cold in Kansas City. so it was hard to get really excited." 
He chose the Big XII game because it sounded like the most exciting game out of his options, he said. 
"My brother was really mad at me for picking Kansas City over Tampa Bay," McShane said, laugh­ing. 
McShane chose to enter the con­test on a whim. 
"I saw a promotion on the Dr Pepper Web site for the halftime throw. I figured I could use the money, so why not give it a try?"

ANDEHSON, Calif. ­Three employees of a Kentucky Fried Chicken have been suspended for bathing in a deep sink used to clean dishes. The prank was discov­ered after one of the young women posted photos on a social net­working site of the trio posing and cavorting in the steaming water in their underwear and swim wear. 
The photos were filed in a gallery called "KFC moments." Captions included "haha KFC showers!" and "haha we turned on the jets."

"With this event we hope to establish the story of Hanukkah," Jewish Club president Jenna Zigman said. "Part of our mis­sion is to expose Catholics to Jewish tradition and history." 
The event included traditional Hanukkah food as well as the teaching of the story of llanukkah. 
The feast of Hanukkah com­memorates a rebellion of the Jews in Judea against the Syrian king Antiochus in 175 BC. King Antiochus tried to stifle the .Jewish religious practices to such a degree that the Jews, led by the Maccabee family, created a sueeessful revolt that drove the Syrians out of Judea. 
Aftor·the rebellion, the Jews needed to reconsecrate their Holy Temple, which had been 
defiled by the Syrians. Most importantly, the Jews needed to rekindle their everlasting light in the temple. There was only enough oil to burn the flame for one day. However, the flame stayed lit for eight whole days.

Christmas sale to· 
display local artists 
By ALICIA SMITH News Writer 
Saint Mary's College will be hosting the Christmas Craft Show and Sale, Dec. 12. in the Reignbeaux Lounge from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
The Show will host over 40 local artists including some work from Saint Mary's own students. 
Carrie Call, director for the Office Civic and Social Engagement (OCSE) at Saint Mary's said the Art Department will have five tables to sell ceramics and other art pieces at the event. 
Saint Mary's junior and Art Club President Regan Magee told The Observer she will be selling some pieces from her stu­dio art classes at the sale. 
"It is a little nerve-wracking because as a seller you are afraid to name that price," Magee said. "The potential buy­ers do not always understand why an artist would price what they find to be high, and not nec­essarily see all the work and money for supplies to make that print or ceramic piece." 
The Show will contain a vari­ety of crafts including fiber arts, crochet, woodworking, quilting, gourmet food, jewelry, pottery and photography. 
Magee said she is selling "five lithography prints, but multiple copies of each of the prints. Also. [I have] a handmade book made from a studio last semester." 
All of the art is 100 percent handcrafted and designed by the artists, Call said. 
"All crafters are required to confirm that their work is 100 percent handcrafted/designed by them, no commercial products or representatives," she said. 
Some Saint Mary's students will be selling T-shirts at the sale. 
The show will benefit the OCSE's 12 Days of Christmas project, which began Dec. 1. "The artists each pay $25 to have a table," Call said. "This money goes directly to the 12 Days of Christmas project. The money that the artists make is theirs to keep. We will ask them to make further donation if they wish at the end of the day." 
The event is in its second year, and "this year's show is much, much larger," Call said. 
Magee added: "I am very excited. It is always fun to see who stops by to look and ends up buying certain pieces that a student may have worked on or worked around all semester, and see it leave the studio for good." 
The Christmas Craft Show and Sale i.'l open to everyone. 
"A piece of art is always a great gift to give someone for Christmas," Magee said. "It's dif­ferent than buying something from a general store."

Executive education team partners 'With NSWC Corona to design career plan

Maricopa County prosecutors said the men on the wiretaps are Dale Hausner and Samuel Dieteman. 
The recordings, played publicly for the first time Tuesday, allegedly have the two talking almost obsessively about media coverage of the spree that terrorized Phoenix in 2005 and 2006. 
"It now brings the total to six," said the man identified as Dieteman, referring to news reports.

Purdue students invent brace for dogs LAFAYETTE, Ind. -Purdue University stu­denl<; are working on an "exoskeleton" for dogs 
' -a type of brace they hope can help older eanines struggling with hip problems. The students came up with a deviee that fits over part of a dog's back and helps it put more weight on its back legs while using less pain medicine. "If we can make a joint on the crutside of the body to do the same thing, it ean reduce pain. We want to make it marketable for all dogs," said Jim Bergren, a Purdue senior in mechanieal engineering working on the device. Some dogs suffer from hip dysplasia, a condi­tion in which thfl hips deterioratfl, making it diffi­eult for dogs to walk without pain. 
Gov. Blagojevich refuses to resign 
Illinois governor will not heed President-elect Obama's suggestion to step down

to power Wednesday, 
ignoring a call to step down 
from President-elect 
Barack Obama and a warn­

"Everyone is calling for

"My mother swears this is true, and I guess I've heard it long enough that I've come to believe her, that every time she looked over at me, whether I was in the crib or when I was first learning to walk or just standing, more than walking, if there was music on, I was tap dancing," McKenna said ".Just tap dancing, keeping beat with my feet in whatever capacity I could." 
McKenna received his first pair of tap shoes when he was four years old. He said he would watch tap dancing movies, like ones with Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly or Ray Bolger. He'd watch the steps they would do and try to imitate them. 
"It just came out of me," he said. "I think of it as a way of playing the drwns with your feet."

IN BRIEF FDA deadlocked over asthma drug risks 
WASHINGTON -Deadlocked over the risks of long-acting asthma drugs, government health officials Wednesday asked outside advisers if four medications used by millions of patients should remain on the market. 
An unusually large panel of some 30 med­ical and scientific advisers will vote Thursday on whether the risks of the drugs -Advair, Foradil, Serevent and Symbicort -outweigh the benefits. The Food and Drug Administration, whose own scientists are at odds, sought the advice in making a final deci­sion. 
Doctors who treat adults and children with asthma strongly urged the FDA not to ban the drugs. It would only trigger a dangerous surge in cases of uncontrolled asthma, they warned. 
Some of the FDA advisers expressed frustra­tion Wednesday ovor a lack of fresh clinical data on medications in use for a decade or longer. "I think this is an impossible task you are asking us to do," said Dr. Judith Kramer, who teaches medicine at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. 

Bush gives up on easing coal restrictions 
WASHINGTON -Six weeks before leaving office, the Bush administration is giving up on an eight-year effort to ease restrictions on pol­lution from coal-burning power plants, a key plank of its original energy agenda and one that put the president at odds with environ­mentalists his entire tenure in the White House. 
President George W. Bush had hoped to make both changes to air pollution regulations final before leaving office on Jan. 20. In the midst of a coal-fired power plant construction boom, the rules would have made it easier for energy companies to expand existing facilities and to erect new power plants in areas of the country that meet air quality standards. 
But the Environmental Protection Agency on ,Wednesday conceded that it didn't have enough time to complete the rules changes, which were undermined by a federal court decision earlier this year that serq.pped a sig­nature component of Bush's clean air policies.

Emergency auto bailout in peril 
Republicans fight against plan to spend_ $14 billion to help struggling automakers 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON­Emergency aid for the nation's imperiled auto industry was thrown into jeopardy Wednesday, opposed by Republicans who were revolting against a hard-fought deal between Democrats and the Bush White House to speed $14 billion to ailing carmakers. 
The House was on track to vote on the bailout Wednesday night, and Democrats held out hope that it could be enacted by week's end. But a growing number ol' GOP senators deelared they would not go along. 
The White House, though not formally endorsing an agreement with congres­sional Democrats, dis­patched administration officials to Capitol Hill to make a ease for the reseue package. During a con­tentious, closed-door lunch­eon with Senate Republicans, White House Chief of Staff-Josh Bolten got an earful of criticism from the rank-and-file, some of whom have already announced plans to block the measure.

Assisted suicide televised in Britain 
Broadcast shows terminally-ill American during his last moments at Swiss clinic 
Associated Press 
LONDON -The scene is dif­

ficult to watch, even for view­
ers inured to the subject of' 
dying by a steady diet of' vio­
lent llollywood and television 
fare. 
Craig Ewert, a former com­

puter scientist from Chicago, 
is shown lying in bed with his 
wife at his side while he takes 
barbiturates. lie asks for a 
glass of' apple juice to mask 
the bad taste and help him 
swallow. Then he uses his 
teeth to turn off his ventilator 
-and dies on camera. 
Britain's obsession with 

reality television reached new 
heights -or depths ­
Wednesday night with the 
broadeast of the assisted sui­
cide of' the 59-year-old tenni­
nally ill American at. a Swiss 
clinic. 
Showing the final moment of 

death had long been a final 
taboo, even for no-holds­
barred British TV, where sex 
and violence are common, and 
the broadcast unleashed 
debate on an issue that 
strongly divides public opin­
ion. 
Photographs of' Ewert's final moments dominated Britain's newspaper front pages Wednesday -"SUICIDE TV" screanwd one tabloid -and prom ptnd a debate in Parliament, whern Prime Ministnr Cordon Brown was quizznd about tho propriety of the decision to air the pro­gram. 
Before hn died, Ewert said taking his own lifp, would mean loss suffering for him­self and hi.s family. 
"If' I go through with it, I die as I must at some point," he says in tlw documentary. which eh ron ielns his 2006 dncision to take his own life after being diagnosed with degenerative motor neuron disease. 
"If I don't go through with it, my choien is essnntially to suf­fer, and to inflict suffering on my family, and thnn die." 
Care Not Killing, an anti­euthanasia group aligned with the Catholie Church and other religious organizations in Britain, denouneed the broad­east as "a eynieal attempt to boost television ratings" and persuade l'arliamnnt to legal­ize assisted suicide. 
"Thorn is a growing ·appetite from the British public for increasingly bizarre reality shows," said the group's director, Peter Sa.unders. "We'd son it as a nnw mii!-J­stonn. It gloririns assisted 
dying when there is a very 
active campaign by the pro­
suicide lobby to get the issue 
back into Parliament." 
Mary Ewert wrote in the 
British press Wednesday that 
her husband had been enthu­
siastic about having his final 
moments televised. 
"He was keen to have it 
shown because when death is 
hidden and private, people 
don't faee their fears about 
it," she said, adding that he 
wanted viewers to understand 
that assisted suicide allowed 
him to die comfortably rather 
than enduring a long, drawn 
out and painful demise. 
The documentary by Osear­winning director John Zaritsky has previously been shown on Canadian and Swiss TV and at numerous film festi­vals, where it provoked little eontroversy. But it struck a raw nerve in Britain, where the divisive debate over assist­ed suicide remains unre­solved. 
Zaritsky said it would have been "less than honest" to make the film without show­ing the actual suicide because it would have left viewers wondering if the,..death was unpleasant, cruel, or carried out against Ewert's will. 
"By putting it out there, and putting it out there in its entirety, people can judg(~ for themselves," he said, adding that the documentary gives viewers an insight into how assisted suicide would work if it is legalized in more places. 
Originally called "The Suieidn Tourist," the film was renamed "Hight to Die?" for its British broadcast on Sky TV's Heal Lives digital ehan­nel, which draws far fewer viewers than the network's myriad news, sports or movie shows. Still, it generated enor­mous publicity, with elips shown throughout the day on Sky News and rival channels. 
The televised suicide in Britain follows a well-publi­eized case in Florida, where a teenager killed himself on cameni. last month and broad­cast the chilling images live on an Internet site. 
Ewert, who was living in Britain when he became ill, went abroad to end his life because assisted suicide is illegal in Britain. 
In the film, he says he want­ed to take action before the disease, which destroys eells that control essential muscle activity such as speaking, walking, breathing and swal­lowing, left him completely ineapaeitated.

Twas the night before finals when all thru the JACC, 
Not a creature was stirring, not even K-Mac. 
The netting was strung from the hoops with great care, 
In hopes that the Legion soon would be there. 
The freshmen were studying all quiet in CoMo, While visions of plane flights start­ed to grow. And profs with_their coffee, some with their tea, Were writing the finals we all wished to see. When out at the Gug there arose such a clatter, Coach Weis had just realized that losses do matter. Away to the window he limped very 
slow, 

The swelling on his knee was starting to grow. 
Looking out on the fields where they practiced all year, 
A loss to the Warriors he started to fear. 
lie texted his boss, already in bed, 
These sleepless nights were going to his head. 
At that very moment in the library basement, 
Writing feverishly I was not yet complacent. 
A Christmas Poem I wanted to write, 
To bring joy to all, as well as delight. 
My thoughts were still racing about my exam, 
And those horrible meals when the DH serves ham. 
My focus was gone, my mind had no might, 
I realized I needed was a smooth Keystone Light. 
So out to my car I moved very quick, 
A grin on my face, like the smile of St. Nick. 
As I got in my Buick, the ice turned me blue, 
Back home I did go to drink a quick brew. 
With the car running smooth I arrived in a flash, 
Not lee nor Snow could make this GM crash. 
As I walked up my steps, and turned the bright key, 
I eouldn 't contain my emotional glee.

I entered the house while my roommate did say, "We're dogs to the Warriors on the Eve of Christmas Day'?" Embarrassed l was with the madness of that, I symbolically threw down my Notre Dame hat. As I entered the kitchen and found a cookie, I picked up my phone and called my bookie. They'll cover the spread, I said almost laughing, Hhyming is hard, but at least I'm not rapping. I opened the fridge looking for my tasty stone, A problem I saw, our fridge was dry to the bone. I went right outside in the snow to our neighbors, But they only had Bud, not the smooth Keystone flavors. To the stores I thought, to buy me a rack, It's Sunday, I recalled, openness they lack. With no options left, I drank some hot cocoa, A house without Keystone is driving me loco. I retired to my room all ready for bed, Clouds of disappointment danced through my head. Finals were coming, and I couldn't quitn think, I desperately needed that light and smooth drink. In the morning I'd wake and go back to my work, Because tests and papers continued to lurk. And in the darkness, yet another clatter, My roommate entered. What was the matter? He tossed me a stone with a gleam in his eye, Speechless I was, I almost did cry. The blue on the can so bright and magical, It must have been a Christmas Miracle. Santa did come, he told me with joy, With eyes wide open like a nine-year-old boy. The reindeer I heard, upon the rooftop, Not even the gunshots could cause them to stop. As he left the room and walked out of sight, I said Merry Christmas. Have a good night.

Give us a day off 

More praise for ND soccer 
Rarely do we have the chance to plan ahead to witness history, the good or the bad, the triumphant or the tragic. History doesn't give us a warning in advance, so we arc always paying close attention. It just comes. 
However, in just over a month, we will have a chance to witness history, with time to prepare~ On Jan. 20, 2009. Barack Obama will be inaugu­rated as the first African-American president, in a country not far removed from an age when blacks and whites couldn't even drink at the same water fountain or attend the same schools. 
Regardless of your political leaning, you must admit, this is an historic event. And the beauty is, we kno~ it's coming and have the chance to watch it unfold. However, we will be -or are supposed to be at least -in class. This historic event even falls close to a national holiday, which the University does not honor in any real sense. · 
This is a chance to make things right. 
There is· a movement to rnake MLK Day not a day off but a "day on," a day to work for the justice and peace that Dr. King died fighting for. What better way to honor Dr. King than to provide students with the chance to witness­history, an event that many people our parents' age probably thought they would never see in their life time. 
Let's take Jhe day off to witness his­tory. ·

Dropping the bolVl 

To whom it may concern, 
Thank you so much for choosing to accept a bid to the Hawaii Bowl on Dec. 24, 2008. To quote our outstanding sen­ior receiver and captain David Grimes, "Nice weather, beautiful women," ... sounds great to me. 
It is so smart that you chose such a convenient bowl for Notre Dame fans to attend. First of all, airfare to Hawaii is really cheap, the trip takes no time at all, and I know that the hotels there are relatively inexpensive. 
Also, I know that hardly anyone at this University celebrates Christmas. I would never expect members of the Notre Dame family to have already made plans for Christmas Eve. 
Further, the Band of the Fighting Irish will not be in attendance at this bowl game. I know we love tradition here at Notre Dame, so I totally understand why you, for the first time ever, chose not to send any band members to the bowl. We all know that the band has never done any service to this University. After already taking away their grades, taking away the highlight of their marching season is also another great idea. I know that none bf our school's songs or cheers are important to the Notre Dame fans, and I know the football team hates when the band shows up at away games. Even ask Charlie, he hates the band ... 
So, I hope that our football team, their families and our administrators have a great time in Hawaii. Enjoy yourselves, wear lots of suntan lotion, and don't get too discouraged by the lack of blue and gold in the stands at the game. I hope Santa finds you all in Hawaii, 
Go Irish, and have a Merry Christmas. 
Happy Holidays, 

Matt Babcock junior Stanford Hall Dec. 10 
Band m_issing out on bovvl 
I would like to start by saying how hon­ored I am to be a part of the Notre Dame Marching Band Tradition. I have faithfully praeticed, performed and cheered on the Irish for four years. Not everyone makes the band, so I understand I am entitled to nothing. Being part of a tradition larger than myself is enough. 
The most amazing part of this year was our storied trip to USC. It took a lot of donations and a lot of manpower in plan­ning the trip, and I am forever in debt to all those who put effort into it. It was awe­some. The band lived up to expectations and beyond: we out-performed and out­classed the USC band without question. After a long weekend, we were exhaust­ed. And the Irish fans, in a foreign stadi­um, appreciated it. 
What, then, am I upset about? How classless our team was. I was embar­rassed about the fight before the game even started; and even more embarrassed by the laek of eohesiveness our players demonstrated on the field. But yet, the band never quit. We kept on eheering. The worst part is that I didn't even know this was going to be my last time in uni­form; after all, we were bowl eligible, and if the band means so much to Notre Dame Tradition, as I'm constantly told by alum­ni, I imagine we could scrape some money together to send us to cheer the team. 
But we're not going to go. It is the first time in the band's history that it will not follow the team to a bowl game. 
A week ago, people were willing to spend $20 million to fire Weis. We are now sending our team to Hawaii. Sure, we get a payout for the bowl, so the team ean go. But we would get a payout for a game in the continental U.S. too. Father Jenkins wrote in an e-mail to the Notre Dame community on Dee. 1, "I ask our academic and administrative leaders to do more with existing resourees in order to reduce expenditures," in order to, "maintain our unwavering commitment to Notre Dame's core mission." We'd have more money from that payout to keep if we weren't flying overseas. But we chose a bowl game that does not do that. They get to go to Hawaii. 
And in "cutting eosts," we will not spend a large sum to reward the group that never failed on the football field. I don't get the privilege of cheering on the team one last time. I understand. It's a lot of money. It's a failing economy. Fine, I've hung up my uniform. I am a band alumna now. I only ask one last thing: 
That the money not spent to reward our band for their devotion with one last game, will go toward something that makes me proud of my University, not towards recruiting cocky players who don't exhibit Irish spirit and pride, not towards sending our players to extrava­gant bowl game locations and not towards firing coaches because we're about instant gratification, but toward some­thing that might truly reflect "Notre Dame's core mission."

To the women's soccer team: 
"Football" is known as the beauti­fd!l game ... I never understood what that meant until I saw the way you played this year. Having attended all but one of your home games and travelled to NC for the College Cup, I can barely express in words how amazing it was to witness your mag­ical season. 
When I look back, I remember seemingly endless good times and amazing moments. I remember the countless young soccer players who watched in awe and dreamed of suiting up for the Irish one day. I remember the die-hard local fans who made it out to every game and cheered you by name until their voices were gone. I remember a packed house against Minnesota during the coldest night I ean remember, with our students going crazy for all 90-plus minutes of an overtime thriller. 
Most of all, I remetnber how you brought the same fire to every game, how you played with genuine pride and excitement and how you lived every moment. 
I have never seen a team like this before in a~y sport. The way you carried yourselves can not be paral­leled, and the inspiration you gener­ated can not be surpassed. During a time when we all tend to lose sight of what playing for Notre Dame is all 1 about, you showed us that sports can still be pure. 
To the coaching staff, the trainers, and the entire team: Thanks for keeping .the magic alive. Go Irish! 
Daniel C. Collins junior Alumni Hall Dec. 9 


University vvorkers deserve respect 
To the supporters of CLAP and others who seek better pay for University workers: 
In honor of the holiday season, make an effort on an individual level to affect social change. Leave a small Christmas bonus for the housekeepers, dining hall workers and other University person­nel. 
Don't complain to the administration on behalf of others if you are not will­ing to lead by example. People have the power to change the world one goodwill gesture at a time. Brighten someone's Christmas this year (espe­cially this tough year) by cracking your pocket book and being a Christmas angel. 
To the Dining Hall staff, 
I would like to thank you fo~ the won­derful Christmas dinner served yester­day. The special dishes were all deli­cious and deserve proper recognition. The quality prime rib doused in Au Jus and juxtaposed with tangerine-topped salmon and delectable scalloped pota­toes was a plate worthy of royalty. 
I consumed the best mousse of my life last night and I want to thank the workers of the Dining Halls for their consistent performance in food quality especially in the desserts and baked goods department. 
If only we could have these special dinners more often ... 
Mark Easley freshman Keenan Hall Dec. 9 


Religion and football 
I am writing in response to the Viewpoint letter "Comments on Weis" by Peter Hellas. In his letter, Hellas covers such topics as his high school football days, his eable TV show, Weis' obesity, Vinee Lombardi and a "dumb spirit called Titan." 
I wasn't sure what the point was, but at some stage it seemed lik¥,. he was say­ing Weis' failure to become a spiritual role model has something to do with the football team losing. 
As much as you'd like it to, Catholicism has nothing to do with winning football games.

events for the Undertones.

Sct!nf~: What is the Undertones' winter con­at the LaFortune cert like? 
Box Office 
/Jassatti: The winter concert is one of our 
favorite nvents of the year, and we've been preparing for il basically sinco our last concert in late December. We'll be doing a lot of our traditional stuff, along with a few new numbers and, of course, some Christmas music just in time for the soason. So far the response has been pretty good; I guess a lot of people like the idea of taking a break from study­ing Friday night. 

Scene: What is the process like for arranging a cappella performances? 
Dassatti: We arrange all of our own music, and some of the stuff we'll sing on Friday was done by guys currently in the group, while other songs are taken from years past. As for how we arrange, I'd say there are two basic methods we tend to follow. Sometimes we'll get a copy of the sheet music and directly transpose the notes the instruments are playing, meaning we're literally doing the song a cappella. With other songs though, we might use that method as a 
basis and then add our own flare to it. Scene: Who else is in the Undertones? 
Dassatti: There are 12 of us in the group, 11 currently hore. We have two sophomores (myself and Kyle Neiman), the oxpi~rionee of heartbroak with s~msitivity and depth.

entire work merits appreciation. "Love Lockdown" and "Heartless" have already become regulars on radio. Both tracks are characterized by their staccato, accented blend of tribal raw­ness and processed, mechanical beats. 
There is something both controlled and pa<>sionate in these and other songs on the album. But while the two better-known tracks only show one facet of the album, the other songs highlight other musical ele­ments, such as the drumming and beeping, which persist subtly throughout all the tracks. Additionally, airy chorus chanting and boautiful violin/string instrumental are frequently found in the tracks. "RoboCop" about a "spoiled little LA girl" utilizes the 
five juniors (Dominic Go, Mike Flattery, Tom Ronan, Mike Mahoney, and Chris 
· Meister) and four seniors (Brian Green, Tim Cummings, Ben Willis, and Robert Curry). One other junior, Scott Robinson, is in London this semester but he'll switch places with Meister, who leaves in the spring for Cairo. 
As for leadership, it kind of depends on what you're looking for. Brian is our musical director, I'm the business man­ager -I'm in charge of organizing concerts/events/etc. -and Robert is our tour manager. 
Scene: What kind of practice or meeting schedule do you have leading up to a concert? 
Dassatti: Our practice schedule is usually Monday and Wednesday nights for an hour and a half or so, and we tend to do more practice before a con­cert, but because Glee Club has been so busy these last few weeks with Christmas obligations it's been inter­esting trying to get everything together in time. Still, I think we'll be OK. 
Scene: What other concerts do you put on during the school year? 
provide an intriguing contra<>t to West's usual style. 
While rap may typically seom abrasivn musically, Wost draws listeners in with his smooth vocals that envelope insightful, poignant lyrics. On the whole, "808s & lleartbreak" is nloquent, simple and rich. It might be a nnw fac11t of Kanye West's per­sonality and style, but his compelling style that fans fell in love with is still distinctly present. As usual, West uses his musical gPnius and flexible talent to take his craft to the next level, to the benefit of the entertain­ment and musie industry and listeners alike. 
Contact Jess Shaffer at jshaffel @nd.edu 
Dassatti: Aside from a lot of small University events, we have four major concerts planned for this year. The first one was back in September, when we released our latest album, "Stranded." We'll have our traditional semester concerts -this Friday's and one in the spring -and we've also planned an Undertones Heunion con­cert for Feb. 28. There will be a lot of 'Tones alums coming back to sing for that one, and it'll be a really great time. 
Scene: What is the Undertones win­ter tour going to be like? 
Dassatti: We'll be touring for the second half of Christmas Break. We'll start in Indianapolis and then spend a little over a week down south with stops in Florida, Alabama, Tennessee and Louisiana. Tours in general are a great time because you get to go around the country, meeting a lot of really cool alums and just singing for people, which we love.

Tebow goes for second straight Reisman 
Oklahoma's Bradford and Texas' McCoy to join Tebow as Heisman Trophy finalists in New York City this weekend 
Associated (>ress 
NEW YOHK-Tim Tcbow will go for two against a pair of tal­ented quartnrbacks from tho Big I 2 wlwn the II eism an Trophy is handPd out Saturday night. 
Sam Bradford from -Oklahoma and Colt McCoy from' Texas joined TPilOw as llnisman thutl­ists annouiH~nd WPchwsday. 
ThP last tinw all· the llnisman tinalists wnrn quartnrbaeks was 200 I, wlwn NI'IHaska's Erie Crouch won thn award and QBs lwld thn tirst six spots. 
Tnbow. thn ruggnd and multi­talnntnd junior from Florida, was tlw lirst sophomorn to win tho lleisman last year and is trying to bneome the second playnr to win it twice. 
Archie (; ritTih won the llnisman as a junior in ·1974 for Ohio Statn and again in l 975. 
Tebow's Gators will play Bradford and the Sooners in the BCS national championship game Jan. Hin Miami. 
"It's a good thing I don't have a vote," Bradford said while attending an event with Tebow and McCoy in Orlando, Fla., whern numnrous college foot­ball awards will be handed out Thursday night. "I couldn't decide. It's just an honor to be one of' the guys going up to New York." 
Tebow became the first col­loge football player with 20 touchdown passf1S and 20 rush­ing touchdowns in 2007, carry­ing a Florida tnam that finished 9-4. 
This ·season, Tebow's slats wPI'n down, but his play has still bonn stellar. lin is fifth in the nation in passnr rating (176.7) with 2H touchdown passes and only two interceptions. lie has­n't bonn asked to run as much this season. hut still has 564 yards rushing and 12 touch­downs. 
Most importantly, the Gators are 12-1 and a victory away from their sncond national title in three snasons. 
"Tim is a winner," Florida coach Urban Meyer said during a news conference in South Florida with Oklahom.a coach Bob Stoops to promote the national title game. "lie wants to win. lie's motivated like all of us are. But he's a team-first guy. That's why statistically he might not have the Star Wars slats like he had a year ago. However, he won 12 games. And if he could have either-or, he's going to take 12 wins and the chance to hold that crystal ball." 
Tebow made a strong final case to win another Heisman, leading Florida's 14-point fourth quarter and comeback 31-20 victory in the Southeastern Conference title game against Alabama last Saturday. 
As a former winner, he also has a vote. 

Tebow said 1996 lleisman winner Danny Wunrtl'el suggest­ed he not tell people what he did with his vote. 
''I'm taking his advice," Tebow said. 
Bradford has directed the highest scoring team in major college football history, leading the nation in passer rating 
(186.3) and TD passes (48) while throwing for 4,464 yards. 
The So(mers have scored 702 points and became the first col­lege team in 89 years to reach 60 points in five consecutive games when they won the Big 12 title game 62-21 over Missouri last Saturday. 
"Players just follow him because of his commitment to them and how tough he is and how important the team is to him," Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops said. 
McCoy, who had the imposing task of following Vince Young as Texas' starting quarterback, has turned out to be a multiple threat much like his predeces­sor. 
McCoy set a major college record with his 77.6 completion percentage, breaking the mark set by Daunte Culpepper for Central Florida, and is the 
, Longhorns' leading rusher with 576 yards and lO touchdowns. Texas finished 11-1, with a vic­tory against Oklahoma. 
"If you're going to play quar­terback in our league, you bet-ter be able to put a lot of points on the board," McCoy said. "There are just so many good offenses in this league." 

That victory wasn't enough to get McCoy and Texas into the Big 12 or national champi­onship game instead of the Sooners. 
Heisman organizers generally invite three to five players, based on vote totals. 
Texas Tech quarterback Graham Harrell was surprising­ly not invited to the ceremony, to be held at the Sports Museum of America in downtown New York for the first time. 
Harrell, the latest in a long line of prolific passers to run coach Mike Leach's Air Haid offense, leads the nation with 4, 7 4 7 yards passing and has thrown 41 touchdown passes. He also led Texas Tech to a school-record 11 victories and a tie for first in the Big 12 South with Texas and Oklahoma.

Associated Press 

LAS VEGAS -There is no recession for the New York Yankees. 
Flexing the economic muscle of their new billion­dollar ballpark and ignor­ing industrywide nervous­ness over big-money deals, the Yankees landed the top free-agent pitcher when they agreed Wednesday to the framework of a $161 million, seven-year con­tract with CC Sabathia. 
The amount is a record for a pitcher and the fourth-highest ever in baseball. It signaled a new willingness by the Yankees to spend in an attempt to regain dominance and win the World Series for the first time since 2000. 
''I'm sure every team in baseball would love to have him. He's a guy who's an intimidating factor on the mound," Yankees cap­tain Derek Jeter said at the winter meetings. 
Sabathia's contract fig­ure seems quite appropri­ate -in February the Yankees move across 161st Street in the Bronx to their monumental $1.3 billion palace, where tick­ets cost up to $2,500, fans can watch games at a mar­tini bar and the clubhouse contains a swimming pool, hot tub and every imagina­ble convenience. The way the schedule lines up, there's a good chance Sabathia would pitch the opener there April 16 against Cleveland -which traded him to Milwaukee last July. 
"It illustrates that base­ball is a very different eco­nomic model than the real world," said Scott Boras, the agent for Manny Ramirez, Mark Teixeira and other free agents also seeking big deals. 
The Yankees and Sabathia's agents still need to work out all the details and the pitcher must pass a physical, a baseball offi­cial familiar with the talks told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been complet­ed. Sabathia even has the right to opt out after three seasons and become a free agent again. 
"l think it's a great deal for him and a great deal for the Yankees," Cincinnati Reds manager Dusty Baker said. ''I'm sure he's going to help them win." 
The two New York teams have made the biggest splashes in the slow-mov­ing free-agent market. The Mets, moving into $800 million Citi Field, finalized their $37 million, three­year contract with closer Francisco Rodriguez on Wednesday. 

IN BRIEF Cassel leaves Patriots 
after father's death 
SAN JOSE, Calif. -New England Pa1riots quarterback Matt Cassel left the team Wednesday to join hi'> family fol­lowing the death of his father earlier in the week. 
"Our thoughts are with him and his family during this time," Coach Bill Belichick said before practice. "Right now we're just taking it day to day. He's going to take care of what he has to do." 
Belichick said that Greg Cassel died Monday night and Matt has left the team to be with his family in Southern California. Belichick said he didn't know when Cassel would rejoin the team or whether he would be able to start Sunday against the Oakland Raiders. 
The Pa1riots are practicing this week in San Jose. They stayed on the West Coast after last Sunday's 24-21 win in Seattle. 
Matt Cassel is from Northridge in the Los Angeles area and his father and mother Barbara divorced when he was 
14. Greg Cassel was a script writer. 
Suns acquire Richardson 
from Boticats for Diaw, Bell 
PHOENIX -The Phoenix Suns jetti­soned two familiar players to Olarlotte, and got the Bobcats' leading scorer in exchange. 
In the latest move in the their ongoing makeover, the Suns traded Raja Bell and Boris Diaw to the Bobcats on Wednesday as part of a deal for Jason Richardson. 
Rookie point guard Sean· Singletary aL'lo went to Olarlotte, while the Suns got small forward Jared Dudley and a 2010 second-round draft pick. 
The 6-foot-6 Richardson is a two-time NBA slam dunk champion and an accomplished 3-poinJ: shooter who is averaging 18.7 points this season and 
18.8 for his pro career. 
Bell, a first-team all-defensive team selection in 2006-07 and second team last season, had made it clear he was not happy with the SmlS' switch from coach Mike D'Antoni's high-flying style to the more deliberate approach of new coach Terry Porter. He's averaging 9.4 points this season. 
Owner says AFL could 
call off 2009 season 
NEW YORK -The Arena Football League is poised to call off its 2009 season, tlie owner of its Los Angeles franchise told a newspaper. 
Avengers owner Casey Wasserman said in a story posted on the Los Angeles Times' Web site Wednesday that the AFL needs to take the time to become more effi­cient because of the poor economy. Wasserman is a former league chairman and one of the AFL's major power brokers. 
Avengers spokesman John Tamanaha confirmed to The Associated Press that the team exp'ects the 2009 season to be can­celed. Wasserman told the newspa­per the decision was not official, but he expected owners to vote to approve it this week. 
The 16-team league has repeated­ly delayed the start of free agency and the release of its 2009 schedule after an offseason of uncertainty.

NCAA FooTBALL 
Mullen named next MSU coach 
Associated Press 
JACKSON, Miss. -Florida 
offensive coordinator Dan 
Mullen will be the new football 
coach at Mississippi State, mov­
ing from the Southeastern 
Confernnee champions to one of 
the league's pen~nnial cellar 
dwellers. 
Mullen arrived in Starkville 
on Wednesday afternoon and 
will be introduced at a news 
conference Thursday morning. 
He leaves Gainesville as the 
top-ranked Gators are prepar­
ing to play for their second 
national title in three years. 
"A lot of people get in this profession and when you have head coaching opportunities, they're very rare," Urban Meyer said at news conference in Hollywood, Fla. "Head coach­ing opportunities in the Southeastern Conference at a young age is a great honor. So (Tim Tebow) had t.he same exact reaction that I did: Doggone it, but we wish you well." 
Thn 36-year-old has been an assistant coach for 14 years and spent the last eight with Urban Meyer at Bowling Green, Utah and Florida. 
Florida won the SEC with a dominant ofTense and will play No. 2 Oklahoma for the BCS national championship next month. Meyer told reporters he was not sure if Mullen would be staying through the title game. 
"It's all too frnsh," Meyer said. "The most important thing is whatever gives the University of Florida and our players an opportunity to be successful on that night and I have not had a chance to evaluate that yet." 
Mullon replaces coach Sylvestnr Croom. who resigned last month after going 21-38 in five seasons as the SEC's first black football coach. Since 2001. tlw Bulldogs have had only eme winning season. 
Meyer told reporters after the SEC championship game that Mullen was in contact with Mississippi State athletic din~c­tor Greg Byrne~ about the job. 
The hiring was first rcportnd by tlw Clarion-Lc~dgnr of .Jackson and tlw Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal in Tupelo. 
Byrno interviewed other can­didates for the job. Chris Peterson of Boise State and Louisiana Toeh c:oaeh Derek Dooley both denied inte~rnst in the joh and Byrne also appears to haw talked with Oklahoma offensive coordinator Kevin Wilson. 
Croom left tlw program Nov. 2<J arter the~ Bulldogs suffprml a humiliating 45-0 loss to arehri­val Mississippi. lie said in a rec:cml. tnlnvision intnrvinw that lw was prPparnd to make changes to his coaching staff in 
order to please fans, boosters 
and Byrne, but that Byrne 
wanted to head in a new direc­
tion. 
While Croom was credited 
with improving the overall tal­
ent at Mississippi State despite 
NCAA sanctions he inherited, 
the former NFL assistant coach 
and All-American center at 
Alabama could never get his 
complicated and conservative 
run-first version of the West 
Coast otl'ense into gear. 
The Bulldogs never cracked 
the top 100 under Croom and 
finished 113th out of 119 Bowl 
Subdivision teams with 274.9 
yards per game of total offense 
and 115th in scoring with 15.3 
points per game this season. 
Byrne said he was looking for a coach who could jazz up that woeful offense and got him. Mullen led the Gators to a team record for points in a season this year and has Tebow in the running for a second Heisman Trophy. 
I le also helped develop quar­
terback Alex Smith into a No. 1 
overall pick in the NFL draft as 
quarterbacks coach at Utah. 
The Gators led the nation in 
scoring last year and are third 
this season with 45.5 points per 
game. Mullen directs the 
nation's No. 18 offense (442.4 
yards per game) and No. 11 
rushing offense (229. 7 ypgl. 
The Gators run a spread option offense, the kind of attack that would match the skills of incoming quarterback Tyler Hussell of Meridian, the Bulldogs' top recruit who has left his nonbinding oral commit­ment to Mississippi State in place despite Croom's depar­ture. 
Mullen is expected to begin recruiting immediately in an attempt to hold together the promising class Croom put together before resigning. 
Mississippi State's new coach spent two seasons apiece as wide receivers coach at Wagner and Columbia from 1994-97 after graduating from Ursinus College in Collegeville, Pa., whnrn he played tight end.

HOUSTON -Texas defensive end Brian Orakpo won the Rotary Lombardi Award on Wednesday night, the first Longhorn to take home the tro­phy in 24 years. 
Orakpo is the first Houston native to win the Lombardi, awarded by the city's Rotary Club to the nation's top college lineman or linebacker. He's the third Texas player to win it, and the first since offensive tackle Tony Degrate in 1984. Texas defensive tackle Kenneth Sims won it in 1981. 
The 6-foot-4, 260-pound Orakpo already won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, awarded by the Charlotte Touchdown Club to the nation's top defensive player, and was the Big 12's Defensive Player of the Year. Orakpo finished the regular season with 10.5 sacks, 
15.5 tackles for loss and four forced fumbles. 
Orakpo beat out Ohio State linebacker James Laurinaitis, Southern Cal linebacker Rey Maualuga and Alabama offen­sive lineman Andre Smith. At a banquet before the announce­ment, the other finalists practi­cally conceded the award to Orakpo, who played at nearby Lamar High School. 
"They've been saying, 'Give the award to 'Rak' already,"' Orakpo said. "It's just fun to be out here. I started my career here in Houston and for a major collegiate award to be presented in Houston, it's a 1-2 combo. You can't beat that." 
The Longhorns (11-1) face the Buckeyes (10-2) in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 5, but Orakpo said he's still upset that Texas won't get to play for the national championship three days later. The Longhorns beat Oklahoma earlier in the season, but the Sooners will face Florida for the title because they finished ahead of Texas in the Bowl Championship Series standings. 
"It was very unfortunate, but we have to move on," Orakpo said. 
Maualuga can relate. An early loss to Oregon State ruined Southern Cal's champi­onship hopes and the Trojans (11-1) will play Penn State (11­
1) in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1. 
"We can't show how good we are when we can't play teams like Florida or Alabama or Texas," said Maualuga, the Pac-10's Defensive Player of the Year. "Hopefully, down the line, there's a playoff system. As for now, we're just happy we get to play in the Rose Bowl."

Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.­The New York Giants have refused to pay suspended receiver Plaxico Burress a $1 million portion of a signing bonus from a contract signed in September. 
NFL Players Association union spokesman Carl Francis confirmed Wednesday evening that the Super Bowl champions decided to not make the pay­ment, which was due Wednesday. 
"We will file a claim in the appropriate forum to enforce his right to receive and keep the moneys· entitled to him under his player contract," Francis said in an e-mail. 
Giants general manager Jerry Reese waved his hands earlier in the day when asked whether the team would make the pay­ment. 
The union on Tuesday filed a grievance challenging the Giants' decision to suspend and fine Burress last week, just days after the Super Bowl hero accidentally shot himself in a Manhattan nightclub on Nov. 29. 
The union said the team vio­lated the collective bargaining agreement placing Burress on the reserve-non football injury list, suspending him for the final four games of the regular season and fining him an addi­tional week's salary for conduct detrimental to the team. 
Placing Burress on the non­football injury list also will keep him out of the playoffs. The Giants (11-2) won the NFC East title last Sunday. 
The grievances will be heard by an arbitrator after the sea­son ends. 
Agent Drew Rosenhaus did not return either an e-mail left by The Associated Press seek­ing comment. 
The union file~other griev­ance on Burress' behalf earlier this year after the Giants sus­pended him for a game and fined him two weeks pay for missing a team meeting in September. The two sides even­tually agreed to cut the fine in half, saving Burress about one game's pay -more than $200,000. 
The shooting was the latest run-in that Burress has had with the Giants since signing as a free agent in 2005. He has admitted to being fined dozens of times for violating team rules. In addition to his suspen­sion in September, he also was fined $45,000 by the league for abusing an official and throw­ing a ball into the stands in a game with San Francisco on Nov. 19. · 
Burress accidentally shot himself at the Latin Quarter nightclub, less than 48 hours before the Giants played the Washington Redskins. The 31­year-old was not going to play in the game because of a ham­string injury. 
Burress faces charges of criminal possession of a weapon relating to the shoot­ing. He pleaded not guilty. He is due back in court on March 31. 
The focus· of the investigation the past week has been on the role of Giants middle linebacker Antonio Pierce. He talked to investigators on Friday about the shooting. Neither Pierce's attorney nor the police would reveal what was said.
