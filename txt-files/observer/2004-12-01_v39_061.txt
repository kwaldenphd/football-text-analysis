Despite outside belief, Tuesday a sad day for Irish 

My first conversation with Tyrone Willingham was brief. 
I nervously introduced myself, made small talk and quickly walked away. It was the shortest of conversa­

Maybe it was the firm Joe Hettler handshake. Maybe it was 
the way he Sports Writer took time out ofhis busy day to speak with me. Maybe I was just awestruck at meeting 
Notre Dame's football coach. In any case, I've always rooted for Willingham to succeed. 
That's why I believe Tuesday was a sad day for the Notre Dame family. Not because I felt Willingham shouldn't have been fired. He should have. The blowout defeats, the inconsis­tent performances, the poor recruiting, the terrible home record -all justified this firing, even if it was after only three seasons. 


Tuesday was a sad day because too many people rooted for this move. Too many people rejoiced in Willingham's fall. Too many people think ridding the 
University of Willingham and bringing in a head coach from Utah will magically turn every­thing around for the fallen Irish. 
The truth is, it won't. 
There is no quick fix to Notre Dame's problems. 
People blame Willingham for tions, but it was long enough to leave an impression ­I liked this man. I liked him a lot. 
Notre Dame's struggles the past several seasons. There is obvi­ous reality to those criticisms. He didn't produce -bottom line. But it wasn't completely his fault. He was expected to imple­ment a radically different offense and do so against one of the nation's toughest schedules. To make matters worse, he won his first eight games, raising expectations to a level unfair to any coach. Former Irish head coach Lou Holtz once said, "Notre Dame fans expect a minor miracle every Saturday and a major one every now and then." This isn't far from the truth, and by winning early, Willingham indirectly set him­self up to fall hard. 
Aside from football,

Willingham did much more for the University than many people realize. He pushed his players to succeed in the classroom, and the players responded with some of the highest GPAs this football program has ever seen. 
He indirectly increased minor­ity enrollment at a school com­prised of mostly white, upper­middle-class students. 
And he restored respect and character to a Notre Dame pro­gram that was reeling with embarrassment after the George O'Leary debacle. 
As the losses mounted, Willingham was criticized for the smallest aspects of his char­acter. He didn't show enough emotion, critics said. He didn't supply enough answers to the team's problem, they claimed. He didn't care about Notre Dame, people argued. 
But what outsiders saw as shortcomings, I saw as qualities. Willingham always kept the same even-keel demeanor, never letting his emotions get the best of him. He joked with reporters and made us feel com­fortable. Most importantly, he did care -not just about his players, but about people. 
I remember a story Willingham told a group of stu­dents when he was first hired. He recalled ordering a meal at a nearby fast food restaurant. Before he could finish ordering, the person taking the order asked, "Aren't you Tyrone Willingham?" Willingham intro­duced himself, then spent the next 20 minutes standing out­side and signing autographs for a number of people. 
Situations like this show Willingham understood peoples' passion for this University. That's why he was reportedly distraught when athletic direc­tor Kevin White informed him of the firing. Willingham is a proud man. He wanted to succeed at­Notre Dame, to show his doubters he was the right choice three years ago. 
But sometimes things don't work out. Willingham couldn't stick around for another year or two because too many alumni, too many students and too many Notre Dame administrators and trustees felt he was the wrong man for the job. Another season that produced just seven or eight wins would not have been enough to keep the critics at bay. 
So Willingham was fired

Tuesday, near the end of a sec­ond disappointing season in three tries. He didn't expect the news -neither did his assistant coaches, who were on the road recruiting. 
A man that stands for every­thing that is right about this University, a man that made this school better during his three years in South Bend, a man that did everything he could to return Notre Dame football to glory, is now a part of the past, joining the ranks of recently dis­appointing Irish coaches Gerry Faust and Bob Davie. 
While many Notre Dame's fans celebrated Willingham's firing, the coach silently sulked into the background, into a fraternity of failed Irish football coaches that no one wants to join. 
But contrary to popular belief, Tuesday was a sad day in Notre Dame's rich football tradition. 
That's because, Tuesday, Notre Dame abruptly said good­bye to one of its own.

Silent reaction. not unexpected 
Quiet and calm, Willingham remains in control despite ups and downs 
Willingham's assistant coaches currently wait in limbo 

Baer Den brock Diedrick Gonzales Mattison 
By MATT LOZAR Sports Writer 
Tyrone Willingham stepped to 
the podium on Jan. 1, 2002 and 
took over perhaps the most 
demanding coaching job in col­
lege football. 
The way Willingham got there 
was quiet and not flashy-just 
like his personality. 
Growing up in Jacksonville, N.C., Willingham faced many problems because of his race. The city was integrated when Willingham was 12. On his high school football team, instead of complaining or quitting about the lack of playing time, Willingham kept working hard and eventually got his chance at quarterback when the starter got hurt. 
During th(' coaching search to replace Bob Davie in December 2001, Willingham was one of the mid-range candidates, according to the media and fans. When George O'Leary had to resign, Notre Dame athletic director Kevin White went back to the man who he called first -Willingham. 
But nobody knew about that initial phone call until Willingham was hired. 
After not getting the job the first time, Willingham stayed focused on coaching Stanford in the Seattle Bowl. 
Many people saw Willingham as a candidate White settled on at the end of the coaching search. Willingham wen,t his own way in demanding the respect of his players, fans and students. 
The well-known. PowerPoint presentation with the team at the first players' meeting in January that ended with a slide saying "WIN" set a precedent from Day 1. 
When Willingham went to the dorms in spring 2002, he con­nected instantly with the Notre Dame student body by having the right answer to every ques­tion and saying he had one goal

numerous lopsided losses and 13 
wins in 28 games. 
But looking past that. there's a 

man people won't see. 
They won't see a coach who 

had the support of many of his 
players Tuesday, despite the sub­
standard results of the past two 
years. Just like their coach, the 
players stayed silent in another 
period of turmoil in a program 
that has seen more than its fair 
share. 
They won't see a coach who 

had only three seasons to take 
players recruited for an option 
offense and put them in a pro­
style attack. Willingham never 
complained about not having his 
players in the system and nei­
ther did his players. 
They won't see a coach who was as good a representative of the University as anyone in a leadership position at Notre Dame. Willingham was just as concerned with his players' aca­demic and spiritual development as he was with their football development. He led by example on the field and in the interview room. But he didn't do it in high­profile events or in front of the media -it was about quiet pro­fessionalism. 
As surprising as Tuesday's fir­ing was to almost everyone ­players, media and students -Willingham didn't stoop to the level of spouting off about how unfairly he was treated and dis­agreeing with the administra­tion's decision. 
He didn't hold his own hastily arranged press conference and vent against his management. 
He didn't release a statement voicing displeasure. 
Silent, professional and in the background, Willingham left the Notre Dame program Tuesday. 
If you didn't expect that, then you don't know Tyrone Willingham.

While Notre Dame head coach Tyrone Willingham was removed of his duties as football coach Tuesday, the fate of his assistant staff is still up in the air. 
"Everybody will be retained until we have a new head coach in place," Irish athletic director Kevin White said at a press conference Tuesday. 
According to Ivan Maisel at ESPN.com, seven of Willingham's assistants were not even aware of the firing because they were traveling on business trips. It was not clear 
· who those seven assistant<;; were. Irish defensive coordinator Kent Baer and ommsive coordinator Bill Diedrick are among those coaches whose jobs are cur­rently in limbo. Offensive line eoaches 
Mike Denbrock and John McDonnell, defensive line coach Greg Mattison, wide receivers coach Trent Miles, running backs/special teams coach Buzz Preston, linebackers coach Bob Simmons and defensive backs coach Steven Wilks are the other assistant coaches on staff. 
At this point, it is unclear which coaches, if any, will be retained after the hiring of a new head football coach at Notre Dame. Of the current Irish assistant coaches, all but Mattison were either brought over from Stanford with Willingham in 2002, or have been hired during Willingham's tenure. 
Mattison was the defensive coordinator under Willingham's predecessor Bob Davie, and was retained as a member of Willingham's staff. 
There have been speculations that Baer might be a prime candidate for the vacant head coaching position at Utah State, Baer's alma mater. He began his Division-[ coaching career with the Aggies, serving as Utah State's outside linebackers coach from 1977-82, and then as the team's defensive coordinator from 1983-85. 
The members of the assistant coaching staff are not the· only employees of the football program whose jobs are currently in limbo. Among one of the more impor­tant figures that might have to be replaced is Jimmy Gonzales, Notre Dame's· director of player development. 
Gonzales ha..'i worked directly with mem­ber~ of the coaching staff in recruiting, and is seen as one of the most important recruiting gurus under Willingham's pro­gram. 
There have been several rumors sur­rounding the firing of Wilfingham that White might have first asked the coach to make changes to his coaching staff. White all but denied those rumors Tuesday. 
"We never really got to that conversa­tion, and I think I have a history of not being a micromanager," White said. "And I don't think Father Malloy has spent a whole lot of time spending a lot of associ­ates athletic directors to hire and I haven't spent a whole lot of time tolling our coach­es who they need to hire to serve as their assistant..'>. 
"At the end of the day. the end game is we really have to do a good job on Saturday, and we have to get back to the elite. Coach Willingham knows how to hire a staff and put together a staff, and he's a professional. And so no, we didn't spend a whole lot of time having those conversa­tions."

"As a player, you think it's our fault. We didn't get the job done. I think coach Willingham was a great coach, and I enjoyed play­ing under him." 
Players met later Tuesday night to discuss whether or not they wanted to participate in the Insight Bowl. Notre Dame has already accepted a bid to the bowl set for Dec. 28, but the team did not release a· state­ment finalizing the decision. 
"We're still trying to take this in," Zbikowski said. "It's going to be tough. We're a little shocked, a little disappointed. We just have to stay focused. It's not something you want to go through but it's the way college football is going."

Three years ago, when Notre Dame fired head coach Bob Davie after five seasons, players talked the day of the firing and conference, most players refused to comment about losing their head coach. 
Players found about Willingham's firing during a team meeting in the early after­noon. 
"I met with a core group of the seniors at two o'clock, and I know our seniors are meeting early this evening," White said. ''I'll converse with them again. But I did want their input for obvious reasons." 
Only free safety Tom Zbikowski, a sophomore recruit­ed by Willingham from Illinois, commented on his feelings con­cerning Willingham's dismissal.

ND unsure if team will 

go to bowl 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 
Notre Dame associate athletic 

director John II~isiPr al~rted the 
media Tuesday the Irish have not. 
yet made a decision on whether to 
still attend the Insight Bowl in the 
wake of head coach Tyrone 
Willingham's firing. 
At a press conference Tuesday 

afternoon at the Joyce Center, 
Notre Dame athletic director Kevin 
White stated the players would 
meet to discuss the bowl situation 
in a meeting at 6 p.m. No decision 
was made after the meeting, but 
Heisler suggested a decision might 
be reached sometime today. 
White said in the press confer­

ence Tuesday he still believes the 
players on this year's team should. 
have the ability to attend the 
Insight Bowl in Phoenix if they so 
desire. 
"The young people in our pro­

gram have earned the right to play 
in a bowl," White said. "If they 
want to go to the bowl, then we'll 
support them." 
Notre Dame finished the season 

6-5 after a 41-10 loss to USC 
Saturday in the team's last game of 
the regular season. But with six 
wins, the Irish are still bowl eligi­
ble and the team agreed to partici­
pate in the Insight Bowl on Dec. 
28. 
Notre Dame officially signed the 

contract for the bowl Sunday. 
White said Notre Dame agreed 

to' the decision to attend the bowl, 
even with the possibility of a 
coaching change looming on the 
horizon. 
"There were two separate tracks there," White said. "We had a con­tractual obligation with the sec­ondary bowl package and the Big East conference, and we felt that we needed to participate in the way that the contract suggested." 
Notre Dame, if it elects to partic­ipate in the bowl, will face a Pac­10 opponent in the Insight Bowl at the Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix, the home of Major League Baseball's Arizona Diamondbacks. Potential opponents for the bowl are Arizona State, Oregon, Oregon State and UCLA -with a decision expected Dec. 5. 
The bowl would be Notre Dame's 26th postseason bowl appearance in the team's history, and its first in the Insight Bowl, which has been in existence 16 years under various names. 
"I think we want to do what's right for the players," Heisler said at Tuesday's press conference. "They've spent six months, if not four years, to try to get to this point. And we're not prepared to just take this away f'rom them if they want to go to Tt~mpe and play in the Insight Bowl." 
Shawn Schoeffler, vice president of media relations for the Insight Bowl, said he still expects Notre Dame to attend the bowl and has not even considered a backup plan if the Irish decide not to partici­pate. 
"We haven't even diseussed [the possibility of Notre Dame not attending)," Schoeffler said. "It's never happened in the history of college football so we're not even planning for it to happen. 
"Right now it looks like it's going to be Notre Dame versus UCLA, which is a matchup that should bring a lot of excited fans, and we're excited to put on a good game for them."

White acknowledges vocal alumni influence 

By PAT LEONARD Associate Sports Editor 
Following the firing of coach Tyrone Willingham, the influence of one of the country's widest and most powerful alumni bases is as evident as it has ever been. 
''I'd like to say that all of the noise around the program has no impact," Notre Dame athletic director Kevin White said. "But I'm not sure I can say that objectively." 
White announced the removal of Willingham as head football coach at a 4 
p.m. press conference Tuesday, just one and a half hours before a scheduled rally to protest Willingham's tenure as coach. 
The rally, publicized and organized by the Irish fan website NDNation.com, called for participants to lay "Return to Glory" shirts on the steps of the administration building. 
White did not cite any specific reason for his timing in relieving Willingham of his coaching duties, but he made it clear that alumni dissent is difficult to ignore. 
"I think what makes Notre Dame Notre Dame is the fact that people care about it and are so passionate about it and so emo­tional about it," White said. "That's what makes Notre Dame football what it is, and something very special." 
Rumblings about the state of the program resumed across alumni message boards during the 2003 season. Then, in the winter of2004, the alumni went public. 
Alumnus Tim Kelley helped author a letter to the Board of Trustees signed by more than 400 alumni criticizing how the football program was managed. 
"I personally feel that the Notre Dame alumni should be the most important ~on­stituency of the University," Kelley said. "The administrators and the Board of Trustees should be in fact seeking out what alumni feel about major issues." 
The letter produced mixed reaction, but Kelley saw hints of alumni influence on White's decision Tuesday. 
"[White] made some comments to the effect that the football program felt was important to the school, to something of the respect of what we thought when we com­posed that letter," Kelley said. "If those words represent what the real decision makers feel, then I am heartened." 
White insisted that, at the end of discus­sion between administrative oflicials includ­ing University President Father Edward Malloy, alumni response was not a defining factor in his decision. 
"Everything matters, and everybody mat­ters," White said. "And l don't want to dis­count that or shy away from that response, but at the end of the day I think we did put ourselves in a position to take somewhat of a private reflective viewpoint and see if what we we're doing matches up with our expectations." 
Notre Dame's expectations, in the end, demanded better than the records Willingham produced. Former Notre Dame player Mike Golic (1981-84) said on ESPN's Pardon the Interruption the recently removed coach may not have fully realized the situation he was entering when he accepted the head coachingjob in 2002. 
"Everybody has to understand !the situa­tion] when they sign their name on that dot­ted line," Golic told ESPN. "And while Ty Willingham said he understood the pres­sure, I don't think he fully knew how pres­surized it was until he got there, and any­body who goes there is now going to have that weight on their shoulders."

Willinghan firing stirs emotions at ND 

By CLAIRE HEININGER News Editor 
Unlike his wins and losses on the football field, Tyrone Willingham's impact on the Notre Dame community can't be spelled out in statistics. 
As the University's first black head coaching hire in any sport, Willingham inspired a sense of pride in many people, said Mel Tardy, assistant prOfessional special­ist in the First Year of Studies program. 
"I sensed a hope when he was hired," said Tardy, whose personal connection with the coach runs deep. 
"It's difficult to be African­American and male at Notre Dame, and you never see any­body who is like you," he said. "To see someone of his stature, one of the biggest symbols of Notre Dame, to be somebody like you, there's no way to put it into words ­that's what I think will be a big loss to the Notre Dame community." 
Many minority faculty mem­bers and students likely felt a similar bond with the coach, said University spokesman Matt Sturin. 
"It was very encouraging to them to see him leading the Notre Dame football team, very reassuring," Storin said. "I think internally he was a champion for diversity at the University." 
The national visibility of the football program elevated Willingham's stature above that of other minoritit~s in prominent University posi­tions, said Iris Outlaw, direc­

tor of multicultural student programs and services. 
Officials such as assistant to the president Chandra Johnson and associate dean of graduate studies Donald Pope-Davis are known inter­nally at Notre Dame, Outlaw said, but lack the external recognition of an Irish foot­ball head coach. 
"I think he did provide a lot of visibility and exposure for the institution," she said.

Protesters demand explanation, others applaud decision 
By MADDIE HANNA News Writer 
Students both protesting and supporting the firing of Notre Dame football coach Tyrone Willingham clashed in a heated gathering outside the Main Building Tuesday. 
About 30-40 ethnic minority students gathered on the build­ing's steps to contest the University's decision and carried posters reading "$ cost ND its integrity," "Never before, never again" and "We want Ty bark." 
The demonstration coincided with a cancelled student rally planned to call for Willingham's mmoval. However, some students involved with the original protest still showed up at the Main Building, which led to arguments

Going ... home? 

Like most students, in just 18 short days I will be finishing my last final, packing up my dorm room and going home. 
The only difference is that I will not be coming back next semester. On Jan. 15, I will board a plane headed for Rome, 
Kelly Meehan 

Italy, which will be my home for the next four months. News 
I have been Production aware of the fact I Editor would be going to Rome since late last year, but it has just recently hit me that I am not going to see so many ofmy friends and family for a good amount of time. To help me make the transition from South Bend to Rome, I recently have been thinking of the things I will not miss when I am abroad. 
I believe that the idea ofthe things I will not miss really came to mind when I was informed last week that Saint Mary's would be closing the beloved under­ground tunnel system. The tunnels were always a beacon ofhope during to help me avoid the sometime harsh South Bend weather. 
I certainly will not miss the dinning hall -a girl can only eat cereal and salad for so long. I am fairly confident the Italian cuisine will far surpass even the best din­ner at Noble Family Dinning Hall. 
Snow is certainly something I will not miss. According to my Italian professor, Rome only gets one inch of snow every 15 years. This is amazing, and I think I will be excited for winter for the first time in 19 years. 
I also will not miss the fact that the campus construction zone has created a mess of the sidewalks, resulting in the world's deepest mud puddle. This extremely vast mud puddle i<> not walka­ble, no matter what one may think. I learned my lf~sson the hard way last night. When I was attempting to walk to the parking lot last night I took one step and the next thing I know my feet are completely engulfed in mud, completely ruining my shoes.

Woman performs C-section to save puppies 
CEDAR CITY, Utah -A quick-thinking EMT per­formed a Caesarean section on her dead Chihuahua to save the lives of three pup­pies. Carolyn Shaw was at work two weeks ago when she received a call from her husband, saying their long­haired Chihuahua, Annie, was in labor and whimper­ing under the bed. 
Shaw asked her ambu­lance partner Kori Baker, who also is her daughter­in-law, and a student intern riding along if they could stop by the house and check on the dog. "After I did a quick check I realized she was dead," Barker said. 
Shaw's instincts as an EMT and nurse kicked in. She pulled out her stetho­scope and listened to Annie's heart to search for some sign of life. There was no heartbeat but there was movement. "I felt the babies moving inside of her," Shaw said. 
Men arrested for dumping dirt in a forest 
COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho -Two men have been arrested for dumping dirt in a national forest. The Kootenai County Sheriff's Department said the men, whQ have not been publicly identified, were arrested at a garage in Coeur d'Alene where the dirt had been removed and the base apparently prepared for paving.

Gomez said he asked the two men about dumping dirt in the national forest "and they went off on a tirade about Mother Earth."

Seniors reflect on loss of yet another coach 
By EILEEN DUFFY 
News Writer 
Notre Dame was abuzz Tuesday afternoon with the news of Irish football coach Tyrone Willingham's firing, but for some students that excitement was all too famil­iar. 
"I was excited when Ty was hired," Morrissey senior Andy DeVoto said. "That excitement wore away pretty quickly. He wasn't able to perform as well as we'd expected." 
After four football seasons as Notre Dame students, sen­iors must now bid farewell to the third head football coach in four years. Willingham's termination follows the University's decision to fire former head eoach Bob Davie in December 2001. 
Several seniors they said they felt the firing was justi­fied, based on Willingham's performance. 
"I definitely think that with­in the past three years, he's had time to make quality wins," senior Kathryn Kinner said. "He's on his own recruit­ing class and still hf1's been unable to make good deci­sions in key games." 
''I'm glad to see him gone," added senior Terry Brown of Farley Hall. "The man was 

given three years and all he did was take [former head coach Bob[ Davie's team and then make it progressively worse." 
Kinner said that, while Willingham had a good char­acter, he didn't fulfill his responsibilities. 
"I feel badly because he is a respectable guy with very high moral and social integri­ty, which is good for the University," she said. "(But) they had specific goals and expectations, like in any other job, which weren't met." 
But other seniors, including Steve Salwierak and Bill Kern, disagreed completely with these views. 
"I think he was a success," said Salwierak. "He was hired to change our offense from a power-style to a West Coast style, and he accomplished that. He changed our of"fen­sive philosophy." 
Kern credited Willingham with solid improvements to Notre Dame's offense. 
"Watching games a fresh­man, compared to now, our offense has come a long way," Kern said. "When we were so good in 2001, our defense was scoring two touchdowns a game. Now the offense is actually putting some points on the board." 
Salwierak said Willingham

Protests

between the protesters. 
"We are standing in solidarity with Ty because we feel that his termination was unjust," junior Ukachi Okoronkwo said. 
Students said further explana­tions for Willingham's removal would be necessary. 
'There are a lot of issues here that make his termination ques­tionable," Okoronkwo said. 
Sophomore Krystal Hardy said the University didn't give Willingham an adequate chance. 
"It was really, really unfair," llardy said. "Notre Dame has had a series of losing seasons before Ty." 
She also emphasized Willingham's role as a positive fig­ure in the black community. 
"He contributes to the African­American clubs on campus as well as other clubs and is really a great loss to the Notre Dame community as a whole," Hardy said. 


The student protest on the steps of the main building was organ­ized in a last-minute effort to "channel emotion," according to Hardy. 
While only around 40 students were actively protesting after the press conference announcing Willingham's dismissal, Okoronkwo said she believed most black students on campus would support their actions. 
"This is bigger than a race issue -this is about a man with a fam­ily," sophomore Frank Duerson said. 
Despite the vocal animosity towards the administration, many students came out in support of the decision to terminate Willingham. 
Junior Mike Fremeau, involved in ndnation.com's Call for Change movement that helped organize the original protest, said while Willingham's removal was a start, more action was needed to improve Notre Dame's football record.

tion. At the same time, we have to make sure that we get a top-flight coach to get back to champi­onship football," Frcmeau said. 
Senior John Hamburger said the "Student Rally for Excellence" planned by the Call for Change a week ago intended to show the administration students still cared about the quality of the football program. 
"The rally was designed to ask the administration to take proper steps to return Notre Dame's pro­gram to historical standards of excellence," Hamburger said. "Notre Dame strives for excel­lence in everything -football should be no different." 
Although he supported Willingham's termination, Hamburger expressed regret about the student backlash Tuesday afternoon. 
"It's very unfortunate, the way this has turned out," Hamburger said. "We're happy to have a very active African-American commu­nity at Notre Dame. But my impression is that they seem to think race came into considera­tion, when this had absolutely nothing to do with it." 

He said the football team's poor performance and decreased level of donations because of it led to Tuesday's announcement. 
Despite being surprised by the press conference, Hamburger said he thought the dismissal was meant to preempt the planned student rally, which was cancelled after the firing announcement. 
"I don't think the timing of the announcement was a coinci­dence," Hamburger said. "I don't think it would have been good public relations to have students protesting the administration." 
According to Hamburger, ESPN radio and local South Bend media were aware of the rally, leading him and Call for Change to believe that there would also be press coverage. 
Graduate student Elizabeth Moriarty stopped by to support the students protesting the administration's actions. 
''I'm very sympathetic to what the black students are doing standing out here today, and I want to show support for them as fellow Notre Dame students. I think their voices should be heard," she said. 
Moriarty said the protest was not predominantly related to race or even football, but derived from broader issues. 
"For most of them, the issue is not football. The issue is losing a good friend and that he didn't get a fair chance," she said. "It's about members of this communi­ty feeling like they don't belong and that it's our job to make them feel like they belong."

INTERNATIONAL NEWS 
Netherlands euthanizes babies 
AMSTEHDAM, Netherlands -A hospital in the Netherlands -the first nation to permit euthanasia -recently proposed guidelines for metcy killings of terminally ill newborns, and then made a startling revelation: It has already begun carrying out such procedures, which include administering a lethal dose of sedatives. 
The announcement by the Groningen Academic Hospital came amid a growing dis­cussion in Holland on whether to legalize euthanasia on people incapable of deciding for themselves whether they want to end their lives -a prospect viewed with horror by euthanasia opponents and as a natural evolution by advo­cates. 
In August, the main Dutch doctors' associa­tion KNMG urged the Health Ministry to create an independent board to review euthanasia cases for terminally ill people "with no free will," including children, the severely mentally retarded and people left in an irreversible coma after an accident. 
Ukranian compromise talks end 
KIEV, Ukraine -Opposition supporters on Tuesday abruptly broke off compromise talks over Ukraine's disputed presidential election after pro-government lawmakers blocked a no­confidence motion seeking to topple the prime minister, who was declared the victor in last week's vote despite allegations of massive fraud. 
The opposition's rejection of the talks raises pressure on Ukrainian authorities, while Russian President Vladimir Putin said the crisis in the former Soviet republic must be resolved without foreign meddling. 
The Supreme Court was wrapping up a sec­ond day of hearings with no sign of a decision on an opposition appeal to annul the results from the Nov. 21 runoff election, which put Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych ahead by 871,402 votes.

University President-elect Father John Jenkins joined Poorman and Jarret at the altar, and Charlie Ebersol's friends offered up readings and intentions during the serv­ice. Afterwards, all in atten­dance were invited to sign a card of condolence to be sent to the Ebersols. 
Looking out amongst the sea of somber faces, Jarret stressed the importance of their gathering. 
"The fact that we have come together to pray is so impor­tant," Jarret said. "Our prayers for Charlie and his family are translated by God into grace and strength, and any prayer we say, God prays with us."

IN BRIEF 
AIG accepted independent monitor 
WASHINGTON -Insurance giant American International Group Inc., which is paying $126 million to settle federal authorities' allegations of aiding accounting fraud by other companies, has accepted an independent monitor but will avoid criminal prosecution. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department announced Tuesday that they had reached formal settlements with AIG, which disclosed last week it had agreed to make the payments. The insurer agreed to pay $46 million in an accord with the SEC to settle alle­gations of civil securities fraud over three 2001 transactions it made with PNC Financial Services Group Inc. that allegedly helped the regional bank artificially inflate its earnings. The money will go to shareholders injured by the alleged fraud. 
AIG also agreed to pay $80 million in an accord with the Justice Department that allows it to avoid prosecution and resolve an investiga­tion into the PNC matter and one involving cell phone distributor Brightpoint Inc. 
One in three vehicles gets repaired 
WASHINGTON -Timothy Michaud died last May after falling from the tailgate of a Chevrolet pickup and suffering severe head injuries. 
The 19-year-old from Maine never knew that General Motors Corp. had recalled the pickup two months earlier because the tailgate cables could corrode and snap. At the time of the acci­dent. Michaud's employer -who owned the used 2000 pickup -hadn't received a recall notice, said StPphen Schwarz, an attorney for the Michaud family. 
The pickup was one of the millions of recalled vehicles that go unrepaired each year. Sometimes, vehicle owners arc at fault for not getting repairs. But some safety experts say· automakers and federal regulators shar~ the blame because they haven't developed a better system to track whethf'r a vehicle has in fact been repaired. 
"California requires that wheneV<w you go in for registration, they check what emissions recalls have been done," said Clarence Ditlow of the Center for Auto Safety, an advocacy group. "If you can do it f<>r emissions rncalls, you can do it for saf(ty recalls ... 
Tariffs on shrimp imports upheld 
The Bush adminstration set duties on shrimp arriving from China and Vietnam 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Bush administration on Tuesday upheld the imposi­tion of penalty tariffs on shrimp imports from China and Vietnam, handing a victory to beleaguered U.S. shrimp producers. 
The action affirmed with slight modifications a pre­liminary ruling by the Commerce Department's International Trade Administration last sum­mer. The penalty tariffs have been collected by bor­
. 
der agents since July. 

The department is sched­uled to make a final deci­sion on shrimp imports from four other countries _ Brazil, Ecuador, India and Thailand in late December. 
Together, the six coun­tries provide about 75 per­cent of the shrimp that Americans eat. U.S. food distributors contend that the penalty tariffs will drive up shrimp prices at restau­rants and grocery stores. 
In the decision Tuesday, the government set duties on Chinese exports of frozen and canned warm­water shrimp at levels ranging from 27.9 percent to 112.8 percent. Vietnamese shrimp exports will be hit with duties rang­ing from 4.1 percent to 
25.8 percent. 
The tariffs were imposed because a government investigation found the shrimp from those nations was being sold in the U.S. market at unfairly low prices, a practice known as dumping. 
The ruling came in a case brought by the Southern Shrimp Alliance, which has been dealing with rock-bot­tom prices for shrimp since 2001. It alleged that the 
U.S. industry was on the brink of destruction because of the flood of cheap foreign shrimp. 
"Dumping is cheating, and we thank the Department of Commerce for offsetting this illegal practice and leveling the playing field for U.S. shrimp fishermen, farmers, 

processors and all fairly trading countries," said Eddie Gordon, president of the Southern Shrimp Alliance. 
But the Shrimp Task Force, composed of the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition and the American Seafood Distributors Association, complained that the penal­ty tariffs will mean higher prices for consumers and will not help the domestic industry. 
"Thousands of family­owned restaurants and businesses will now be forced to pay these duties," said Wally Stevens, chair­man of the Shrimp Task Force and president of the seafood distributor Slade Gorton Co. "The U.S. busi­nesses that rely on access to imported shrimp ... together employ thousands of U.S. workers, 20 times those employed in the domestic shrimp industry." 
Foreign shrimp produc­ers have denied they are selling shrimp at artificially low prices as a way to win a larger share of the U.S. market. 
They contend the United States needs foreign imports because the domestic supply is not large enough to meet demand for shrimp, the country's No. 1 seafood. 
Officials from Brazil have said they are studying whether ·to bring a case against the United States before the World Trade Organization, contending that the penalty duties vio­late international trade rules. 
The eight states repre­sented in the Southern Shrimp Alliance are Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, . Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas. 
The cases against all six countries will go back to the U.S. International Trade Commission for a final ruling early next year on the issue of whether shrimp imports are harm­ing the domestic industry. 
If. as expected, the com­mission upholds its prelimi­nary finding of harm, the anti-dumping tariffs will become final and will remain in effect for five years before they are reviewed again under "sunset" provisions of the 
U.S. dumping law. 

Georiga gives corporate merger approval 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA-After landing a $126.5 million pledge to improve rural health care in Georgia, the state gave its approval Tuesday to a corporate merger that will create the nation's largHst health insurance company. 
With Georgia's approval _ the last state to sign off on the deal _ California-based WcllPoint Health Networks, Inc. and Indiana-based Anthem, Inc. are cxpccted to soon close on their merger. 
Georgia Insurance Commissioner John Oxnndine said he seeur<'d the money, which will be spent on a rural health initiative in the state over 20 years, through merger negotiations with both companies. WeiiPoint owns BlueCross BlueShield of Georgia. 
Officials at Anthem did not immedi­ately return telephone calls seeking comment Tuesday. WellPoint oflicials referred inquiries to Anthem. 
To win the statf~·s approval, Anthem agreed to finance telcmedicine cen­ters at 36 rural Georgia hospitals, dinies and the state's four teaching hospitals and tli cover tnlemedicine proc<'dures in its insurance benefits, Oxendine said. Through telcmcdicine, a patient in a rural part of the state can be diagnosed by a specialist in a larger hospital via teleconferencing tPchnology. 
"What we're trying to do is equalize the quality of hPalth care available to

area. 

The insurer also agreed to help rural Georgia health centers expand, renovate and upgrade equipment by purchasing their bonds and other debt instruments over the next 20 years, Oxendine said. 
Anthem also promised that the merger would not lead to higher insu­urance premiums for Georgia BlueCross policyhold('rs, Oxfmdine said. 
Earlier this year, California's insur­ance regulator droppPd his objections to the planned merger after the com­panies agreed lo pay $600 million to h('lp cover the costs of trf'ating that state's uninsured n~sid('nts.

As the snow begins to fall and we adorn campus with colorful lights, many hearts and minds turn to the babe in the manger, a source of fresh hope in these frigid, dark days of December. We are inclined to beautify this birth narrative, but imag-Peter Quaranto ine if things were a bit different. A Call to Action 
Imagine a babe born in Bethlehem, lying in a manger, his arms swathed with scabies, his stomach bloated and his legs covered in his uncon­trollable diarrhea. Imagine an under­weight child, crying because he cannot eat, can barely breathe and feels pain throughout his entire body. Yes, imagine a baby Jesus \vith AIDS. It is not too difficult to imagine in our day, where more than 39 million people, including more than 2 million children, live with HIV/AIDS. 
Today the world commemorates World AIDS Day, a fitting day to reflect upon the inadequacy of our action in the face of the deadliest modern pandemic. Just in 2004, AIDS killed 3.1 million people, while 4.9 million people became infected with HIV. Worse yet, there are no signs ofthe pan­demic abating. Prevention eflorts have been meager and under-funded. All throughout the world, especially in sub­Saharan Africa and pockets ofAsia, IIIV/AIDS is growing, tearing apart fami­lies, communities, economies and whole nations. The enormity of suffering has driven many to defeatism, but there is much that can be done to effectively fight the pandemic and save lives. A successful fight against global AIDS requires only political will and effective policy -two things to which the United States, the world's major superpower, must commit. 
During the last decade, AIDS awareness and attention have increased significantly thanks much to the activism of conserva­tive political and n~ligious groups. Pictures of innocent women and childnm dying have sparked the consciences of millions. In this spirit of "compassionate conservatism," the Bush administration has given increasing priority to foreign aid for AIDS treatment. In 2003, the United States government passed the United States Leadership Against I IIVIAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act, which set a funding goal of $15 billion over the next five years. President Bush deserves praise for this initiative. 
Yet, just as intensely a.'i he pushed for the initiative, Bush has· sought to undercut it. In his 2004 budget, Bush asked for only $2 billion for global AIDS, $1 billion less than authorized. On a larger scale, United States foreign aid has decreased signifi­cantly over recent years. The United Nations asks that each of the Security Council members gives 0. 7 percent of their GDP in non-military foreign aid. The United States now gives about 0.1 pf'r­cent, and even that is · decrea.'iing. Finally, the United States refuses to cancel massive debts owed

I-IIV/AIDS. 

While much credit is due to social conservatives for their activism on this issue, the involvement of such groups in shaping AIDS policy has been problematic in developing AIDS-prevention strategies. The largest shift in United States AIDS policy ha..;; been a shift away from preven­tion towards service for those currently living with HIV/AIDS. The 2003 global AIDS law, diverging ma..;;sively from past United States policy, ensures that more than 55 percent of funds be spent on treatment activities, while only about 20 percent be spend on prevention activities. 
Further, conservatives, inspired by the "ABC" (Abstinence, Be Faithful and Use Condoms) program used in Uganda, have called for more emphasis on abstinence and less on condoms. Hecently, the I louse adopted an amendment, ensuring that at least one-third of prevention funds would go only to "abstinence-until-marriage" programs. These policy shifts may be ide­ologically pleasing, but they run against the existing scientific and medieal data that shows condom distribution and edu­cation to be the most effective way to combat the spread of HIV. 
Even in the area of treatment strategies, the current policymakers have fallen short. While some conservatives have fought valiantly to increase availability of anti-retroviral drugs, the same policy­makers have pushed trade policy that exacerbates the pandemic by hindering the ability of poor nations to purcha..;;e cheap generic AIDS medications. The White House has put the profits of phar­maceutical companies before the lives of millions suffering from AIDS. The clearest example of this was when, last year, the 
president nominated

powers must pledge to fund 
the newly-established 

Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Second, major powers, along with the wro, must work with pharmaceutical companies to loosen intellectual property rights in order to decrease drug prices and increase the availability of ARV medicine. Third, world leaders must utilize the available scientific data to employ the most effeetive preven­tion strategies, even if those strategies face ideological opposition. Finally, each of us must use our own power, whether that be through activism, letter writing to representatives, education campaigns or donations, to contribute to the fight against IIIV/AIDS. To be silent in these urgent times is to be complicit in the deaths of millions. Let us be silent no more.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Let the Pride Week t-shirt go 
Though I am simply a former member of the Saint Mary's community; and some may perhaps write me ofl' in my opin­ion on this matter for that reason, I would just like to say that I find it ridiculous that there is such a negative reaction to the new Pride Week shirts on campus. One of the former shirts depicted the generic "girl" that is posted on bathroom doors nationwide. Does that girl represent me? Were they trying to say that I have to wear a skirt to be considered a woman? If I wanted to, I probably could have sought out an apology from Student Activities as well, since the shirt was so ofl'ensive in its lack of representing me as a person. But I did not do so. Why? Because I know in that common-sense part of my brain that the creators of the shirt were not trying to say that this symbol is how women really should look. It was thought to be a cute idea that would make a nice shirt at a women's college. And that is all they have done this year as well.

Is the photograph of a woman on the bill­board for Saint Mary's College along the Indiana toll road also offensive then? I happen to be Irish, and I do not believe the girl on the board shares my ethnicity. In the line of rea­soning put forth by the people leading this campaign against the shirt, I should have been highly oflended as a Saint Mary's student. However, I was not. Thk t.ype of argument taking place on Saint Mary's campus is lt)()king for a problem where there is no problem. The Pride Week shirt is simply depicting a pretty painting that looks nice on a shirt at a women's college. If anyone needs a cause to fight for, there's a war in Iraq you might have heard about. Let this one go.

The 'coming of the kingdom' in the media 
Christians constantly look to images of Jesus to order our lives, actions and beliefs. In our time, people have a con­siderable amount of sources in a variety of mediums from whieh to contemplate our spiritual founder. From Kamaria Porter paintings, films, songs, literature Breaking the and politieal rheto­Habit ric, Jesus, appar­ently, is everywhere. In our Notre Dame community, we find ourselves even more immersed in the different images of Christ around campus. 
Across the country and on campus, debate and discussion over Mel Gibson's "Passion of the Christ" brought us back to the pivotal moment in our faith lives and in religious history. After viewing the movie, something beyond the horrific violence left me uneasy about the por­trayal of Jesus. While Gibson reaches for authenticity in showing the manner .of Homan torture, the film offers little con­cerning why Jesus was executed. 
The prominent Jesus scholar Marcus Borg faults the film for completely sepa­rating Jesus' death on the cross from what Jesus was passionate about in life. This follows a close and politicallyori­ented reading of both the Hebrew 
Scriptures and Gospels. The God of the 
Hebrew Scriptures is highly concerned 
with issues of justice, primarily economic 
justice. For example, the pivotal event of 
the Torah, the Book of Exodus, if:' lis of 
the Israelites deliverance from slavery in 
Egypt-an economic, political and 
racial oppression. In this and countless 
other stories, we can conclude the God of 
our faith is extremely concerned with 
economic injustice of God's creation. 
In the Christian Scriptures, we find the 
same concern in Jesus. In the Gospels, 
Jesus preaches hope and help to the 
poor, calls people to give up their posses­
sions and establishes an unlikely and 
unpopular c-ommunity of outcasts as 
close friends and followers. Jesus as 
solely teacher, healer and miracle work­
er is hardly worthy of the brutal execu­
tion of the state. Even. as the Passion 
film proffers, Jesus being brought to trial as a blasphemer seems a bit unlikely to ·warrant the attention of Roman authori­
ties. In a serious reading of the Gospel 
story, what Gibson and many miss 
becomes clear. 
Jesus spoke often of the "Kingdom of 
God" and its eminent coming. This refers 
not to heaven. but of what the Earth 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Saying goodbye to Ty 
A wll1ning attitude 
The firing of Tyrone Willingham, unless there was something behind it that we don't know about, was simply ridiculus. Let us remember the sorry situation of this football program when Ty took over. It was in com­plete chaos. lie molded this team, in his very first year, to play with a new and winning attitude. He was also in the process of mold­ing this team's philosophy as well as its heart-and in order to do this he had to reruit his kind of player, have time to mold this player and get that player needed expe­rience. 
Tyrone Willingham was fired just as this molding process, which was mainly taking place on the offensive side of the ball, was coming to fruition. Next year his quarter­back would have been an experiencedjun­ior throwing to very experienced wide­recievers and tight-ends. The offensive line showed dramtic improvement over last year and would have been even better next year. He finally has a west-coast type tail-back and played now has a full-year under his belt. The truth is that the offense was a 
machine the last part of this season -an<:! 
was set to dominate next year. 
Of course, this team's problem all year was the terrible recuiting of Bob Davie sev­eral years ago in the secondary. Despite hav­ing one of the best front sevens in the nation, this team was burnt, in all its losses, by teams that took advantage oftqat lone, yet glaring, weakness. Should Ty have been fired for the results of this weakness ­something for which he was not responsi­ble? Of course not. 
Next year would have been the telling year. Not this one. Next year Ty would have had no excuses. And with an offense ready to dominate, a front seven largely intact and a secondary that had nowhere to go but up -I don't think he would have needed any. Now, of course, we will never know.

EDITORIAL CARTOON 

would look like if God were on Caesar's throne. Through Jesus' parables, that world was a stark contrast to the Homan Empire -one in which all would have what they need<~d. Jesus was a political treat to the aristocracy and power struc­ture of his time. I lis passion for God's desire for economic and social justice on Earth made I lim a threat and caused His death. Further, the early church was a contagion to Homan Empire since its leaders, Paul, Peter and James, were also executed. 
So, Gibson misses the mark in captur­ing the zeal of Jesus, yet Hollywood on the whole does poor job in this regard. Popular films dealing with faith and spir­ituality, like "Saved < or "Dogma," enter­tainingly critique empty and hypocritical Christian ideologies, yet offer to replace them with an empty and unchallenging spirituality. In these depictions, Jesus is not the advocate for the poor and disen­franchised we find in the Bible, but a tamer person merely concerned with moral squabbles and relationship ticks. These three films differ in theme, mak­ing us laugh or cry in anguish or in hor­ror, but in their effect on American view­er spirituality, they are similar. All divorce Jesus from what He was passion­ate about: a new social order ofjustice. 
In the current Ameriean Christian con­text, such depictions hardly surprise me. Christian voices in the forefront mainly represent morally conservative views and largely neglect the economic impli­cations of following Christ. Additionally, Christians-particularly Catholics ­find themselves in the higher social classes and in positions· of power and influence over many. The culture wars and financial interests have re-shaped the image of Jesus to serve their own self-interest. This warm and fuzzy Jesus of personal salvation lacks the commu­nal justice aspect found in the Gospels and early Church. 
People of faith must re-connect with the Jesus of Gospels and continue the social movement he began two millennia ago. God's passion for economic and social justice calls us to action. We must be pro-active in ending poverty, econom­ic exploitation and injustice.

Apologizing to offended community 

On Friday, Nov. 19, we, the members of the Student Activities Board, issued a campus-wide apology for any SAB programs, events and/or pub­lished materials this past semester that a member of our student com­munity may have found offensive in any way. 
The apology was written in order to address concerns that were brought to our attention during the SAB Feedback Session the previous evening. While there were specific examples of programs, events and/or published materials that were directly addressed during the Feedback Session by those in attendance, we recognize that there might have been other programs, events and/or published materials that students who were not at the Feedback Session might have taken exception to. We also recognize that while some students might have taken issue with these programs, events and/or published materials, there are students on this campus who were not offended and who respectfully disagree with those who were. 
As such, the decision was made to issue a non-specific apology, as we did not wish do disenfranchise our student community. 
We recognize that the Pride Week shirt was a catalyst that has since brought forward larger issues on our campus. It has also created an opportunity where respectful dialogue of divergent views, thoughts and opinions held on campus can be voiced and shared. 
We feel that awareness and understanding of these opposing views regarding these issues are vital in order to advance the educational enrichment of our student body. 
As student leaders, we know that students can best take advantage of this opportunity by participating in the Identify Forums, sponsored by the Board of Governance, where we as a community can share our opin­ions, express our concerns and engage in respectful dialogue. 
In conclusion, SAB would like to assure our student body that we are constantly reviewing our programming methods in an effort to bring the highest. quality programs onto campus. We are also taking steps to better identify programs, events and/or published materials that might be seen as offensive or insensitive to anyone on campus in an attempt not to fur­ther offend. We again encourage students to attend the weekly SAB meetings which are open to the entire student body and to share your thoughts as we continue to provide the best programs possible .

Sparta rocks out at Chicago's Metro theatre 
El Paso, Texas band's recent performance gave Windy City audiences an opportunity to experience its unique sound and interesting new album 
By CHUY BENITEZ Scene Writer 
Sparta's Jim Ward has always talked highly of playing to great crowds in Chicago, so the Nov. 23 show at the Metro came as no surprise to Sparta fans and Chicago music-hipsters alike. The show marked Sparta's third trip to the music­hungry city of Chicago, and it almost seemed like a long awaited reunion for 
· Sparta and it's Chicago listeners. For the past month Sparta has been on its latest tour promoting its sophomore album, Porcelain, which was released July 2004. For Sparta, both the album and the tour symbolize a progression and a sense of stability in their careers and personal lives. Although the tour includes two other up-and-coming bands, Further Seems Forever and Copeland, which also have excellent musical creativity, Sparta is the clear headliner and driving force of the tour. In the past it was Sparta who would either co-headline tours and festi­vals like Coachella with great bands like the Pixies, or open for largely established bands like Incubus and Pearl Jam. With their new stability as Texas rock frontrun­ners, the spotlight on Sparta is something they've been wanting and working for since they started the band. Sparta's formation came from the untimely divorce of at the drive-in, which was F.l Paso, Texas· pride-and-joy rock band of the 1990's. The breakup of at the drive-in split the band down the middle, with guitarist and vocalist Jim Ward, gui­tarist/bassist Paul Hinojos and drummer Tony Hajjar moving on to Sparta and singer Cedric Bixler Zavala and Omar Hodriguez moving on to their band, the Mars Volta. The breakup left at the drive­in fans wanting to hate no one and sup­port both efforts. Ward, Hinojos and Hajjar also asked El Paso bassist Matt Miller to join Sparta and create a com­plete sound by being able to have two gui­tarists. Both bands have been critically acclaimed since they have gone their sep­
arate paths, and El Pasoans have been glad to realize that they now have two great hometown bands to support instead of just one. 
With Sparta's newest album, Porcelain, Ward took a big step in writing the vocals for the album, but the payoff has been wholly positive for Ward and the rest of the band. The other band members agree that Ward's lyrics for the album exemplify the maturity level that both Ward and Sparta as a whole have reached· in the past few years. The concept for Porcelain came largely from the revisiting of their hometown of El Paso, Texas and from Ward's new position in life as a married man. Several of their songs reference both El Paso ("Guns of Memorial Park," "La Cerca") and Ward's growing relationship with his new wife ("Hiss the Villain," "Breaking the Broken," "Lines in the Sand"). All of the lyrics to these songs are 

written  openly and cleanly enough  for  
them  to  be  seen  as  personal expressions  
of Ward  and  as  having relevant content  

fans can relate with. 
Sparta's musical sound has also taken a walk back to their musical past in El Paso, which was largely refined and represented by· the now classic cmo sound of at the drive-in. Sparta's opening song, "Guns of Memorial Park," starts with a techno-stat­ic-guitar intro much like they did in their ATDI days. Many of their songs also rock on at a constant feverish but changing pace that never lets the listener feel set­tled. Jt is a pace and structure that can largely be heard and found in the local El Paso music scene. 

The final thought on t.he Porcelain album as a whole is that it resonates on the fundamentals of holding onto your roots and your relationships because in thP end they will be the things you can always count on, and Sparta must be applauded for pulling off such a solid sophomore album that exemplifies the fundamentals that rock-listeners every­where should think about.

Martinez weighs numerous offers 

I . 

University of Notre Dame Department of Music Presents 
University of Notre Dame Chorale & Chamber Orchestra Alexander Blachly, Director 
George Frideric Handel's 
Messiah 
Yankees, Mets among suitors aiming to take pitcherfrom Boston 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK-While Mets 

fans discussed whether their 
team has a chance to land 
Pedro Martinez, former New 
York closer Armando Benitez 
found a new club, agreeing 
Tuesday to a $21.5 million, 
three-year contract with the 
San Francisco Giants. 
Cincinnati, meanwhile, retained a key part of its rota­tion, agreeing to re-sign ex-Met Paul Wilson for $8.2 million over two years. 
Martinez isn't close to making a decision on where to sign, a person close to the free-agent ace said on condition of anonymity, and is likely to wait until the New York Yankees determine their level of inter­est. That could hinge on whether they acquire Randy Johnson from Arizona in a trade that could send Javier Vazquez to the Diamondbacks. 
The Mets, trying to make a splash in the free-agent market, offered a $37.5 million, three­year contract last weekend, an agent with knowledge of the proposal said, also on condition of anonymity. The offer contains an option for a fourth season that could make the deal worth $50 million over four years, the agent said. 
Boston has offered a two-year deal to retain Martinez and must decide by Dec. 7 whether to offer salary arbitration, which would extend the win­dow for the World Series cham­pion Red Sox to re-sign him until Jan. 8. 
Martinez's agent, Fernando Cuza, would not comment on the Mets' proposal, which was first reported Tuesday in sever­al New York and Boston news­papers. New Mets general man­
ager Omar Minaya didn't return 
a telephone message. 
Yankees owner George 
Steinbrenner met with Martinez 
in Tampa, Fla., on Noy. 18, and 
Martinez also met in Florida 
with New York third· baseman 
Alex Rodriguez. 
But the Yankees' primary 
interest in recent days appears 
to be Johnson, the 41-year-old 
left-hander who would prefer to 
leave the rebuilding 
Diamondbacks and play for a 
contender. The Yankees and 
Diamondbacks have been dis­
cussing a trade involving the 
five-time Cy Young Award win­
ner for several weeks, but talks 
haven't gained any momentum, 
several baseball officials said. 
Steinbrenner met in Tampa 
with top aides Mark Newman 
and Billy Connors on Tuesday. 
Benitez bounced back from a subpar 2003 season to save an NL-leading 4 7 games in 51 chances for Florida last season and lead major league relievers with a 1.29 EHA. 
"He's the prototype," general manager Brian Sabean said. "He has been and will be a dominant force at the end of the game.... He's a guy we had our eye on." 
Since Robb Nen was sidelined with a serious shoulder injury following the 2002 World Series, the Giants have pieced together their bullpen. Tim Worrell closed in 2003 before leaving for Philad~Iphia as a free agent and San Francisco struggled at the end of games last season. 
Matt Herges started the year as closer before being replaced by Dustin Hermanson in August. Hermanson saved 17 games but couldn't hold a three-run lead on the final Saturday of the season against Los Angeles, helping cost San Francisco a playoff berth. 
''I'm excited he's on our side," manager Felipe Alou said. "We had to make a change in the middle of the season and it was not easy."

Parcells benches Henson, Testaverde given starting nod 
Associated Press 
IHVING, Texas -Bill Parcells isn't worried about the long­term future and the Dallas Cowboys are still in playofT con­tention in the miserable NFC. So the coach's decision was easy and expected. 
Hookie Drew llenson, whose starting debut lasted only a half, is going back into watch­and-learn mode. And 41-year­old Vinny Testaverde is the starting quarterback again for the Cowboys (4-7). 
"He gives us the best chance to win," Parcells said Tuesday. "That's what I'm interested in doing, if we can." 
Henson got his long-awaited first start against Chicago last Thursday after a sore Testaverde was limited in prac­

! 
\ tice. But Testaverde returned ~ after halftime in a tie game, and the Cowboys won 21-7. While Henson is the quarter~ 
,\ back of the future, Parcells remains focused on winning now. 
, I "My mind only works basical­\ ly this week, this season," he ) said. "That is what my respon­\ sibility is, to try to get the most ~ out of this team this year. You don't necessarily set things up in the future by altering that. You might do things that act as a deterrent for the future.' By beating the Bears, the Cowboys snapped a three-garrie losing streak and became one of 
seven 4-7 teams in the NFC. 
Even while trying to avoid playoff talk, Parcells made it cleq.r he's aware of his team's standing, even though the Cowboys have already lost more games than in his 10-6 debut last season. 
Take out the four division leaders, and there are just three other teams with more wins than Dallas in the chase for two wild-card spots. The Cowboys play Monday night at NFC West leader Seattle (6-5). 
''I've been around long enough to have seen teams recover," Parcells said. "I think someone in this NFC, and I could be wrong, could make a run at this that doesn't appear to have had a chance."' 
A .500 record may just be enough to get into the NFC playoffs this season. So Parcells figures why not the Cowboys? 
"We have an opportunity,"he said. "If we play well Monday, a lot of things will have changed probably in our favor." 
Henson hadn't played quar­terback, not even in three blowout losses before then, until the fourth quarter Nov. 21 at Baltimore when Testaverde took a hard hit that left him with a sore shoulder and back. That also limited Testaverde during the shortened week before the Bears. 
With the Bears committed to pressuring Henson (4-of-12 for 31 yards and an interception returned for a touchdown) into

bad plays and doing things the rookie didn't recognize, Parcells went to Testaverde. 
Owner Jerry Jones expressed disappointment after the game that Henson didn't finish. He insisted, however, that he was­n't second-guessing Parcells and that he left in-game deci­
sions to the coach. 
"I just viewed it as him say­ing what his opinion was. That's fine. No problem," Parcells said. 
The players return to prac­tice Wednesday after having four straight days ofT. The extra time should be beneficial for Testaverde. And Henson, finally with some game experience, will go back to getting limited snaps. 

"Hey, I'm rooting for the guy. I really am," Parcells said. "He just needs more experience. You say, 'How's he going to get that?' I can't forsake everything to do that. I couldn't do it .''

Ultimate team wins second place 
Women win five of six to claim runner­up at Invitational 
Special to The Observer 
The ultimate club's women's squad enjoyed a very success­ful weekend, winning five of six games to place second at the Chattanooga Invitational. Behind the stellar play of Christina Hegdes and Rachel Meeks, the youthful Irish opened by dominating Tennessee Chattanooga, 13-2, and College of Charleston, 13­
4. The third-round match-up with Michigan State provided many highlights as the Irish edged the Spartans, 11-10. Nancy Powaga controlled the long field and endzone with many catches. Saint Mary's junior Stephanie Snyder, Kristine Dube and Jennifer Pruchnik all were pivotal in securing the win. 
In the semifinals against UNC Greensboro, freshmen Elizabeth Lee, Shields Duss and Shannon Morrison sup­ported Mary Klinkhammer, Loretta Brown and Megan 
Davisson as the Irish rolled 13-5. The Irish were upended in the finals by Emory, 13-5, despite several defensive plays by Davisson. For the tourna­ment, SMC's Stephanie Snyder was runner-up fur the UTC Spirit Award, awarded for friendliness and sportsman­ship. 
Bowling 

Notre Dame fielded a women's team for the first time this weekend, as it joined the men's squad in Ann Arbor as Michigan hosted the American Heartland Intercol­legiate Bowling Conference tournament. In their debut, the women finished sixth among the nine competing women's teams. Allison Klein posted a 153.4 average to lead a closely bunched line-up. Kim LaVigne followed at 152, with Denise Trgovich just behind at 
151.4. Daniele LaFramboise and Rachael Schermitzler posted very solid averages of 
140.8 and 132.4 respectively. 
The men's squad continues to make progress, moving up to 19th among 26 teams. Pavan Sadarangani had the fourth highest average of the tournament at 231, with a 
high game of 259 and a low game of 199. Van Koppersmith also averaged over 200, at 209.4, posting a high score of 
257. Vance McClenton rolled games of 218 and 200 to pick his average up to 187, and JB Bertumen's 231 improved his average to 180.3. 
Tom Talamo and Jim Talamo averaged 166.3 and 174.8 as the Irish continue to improve their scores throughout the lineup. 
Women's Ice Hockey 
The Irish women's hockey team suffered two tough loss­es this weekend at Lindenwood University in St. Louis. 
The rookie-filled Notre Dame team struggled against the veteran Lindenwood play­ers, falling 15-0 on Friday night and 14-0 on Saturday night. 
The Irish women played with great effort until the end of each game, with the third period being the strongest for the Irish each night. Coach Dave Olson was satisfied with the hard work of the young team and expects better results as the season pro­gresses.

year tenure with Notre Dame, after leaving the head coaching position at Cincinnati Moeller High School in Ohio. During his 18 years at Moeller, Faust tal­lied a career 174-17-2 record, including five state titles and four national championships. 
Faust's dream was to coach at Notre Dame, but once in South Bend, the coach had hard­ships on the field. 
Faust said Tuesday he believes Willingham knew the expectations of coaching at Notre Dame when 
taking the job before the 2002 season. 
"I don't think anybody likes to be a part of something like this," said Faust, who resigned in November 1985. "But it's the reality of the sports world and that's how the sports world operates. You've got to under­stand that as a coach. That doesn't mean you're not a good coach, that doesn't mean you're not a great coach, it just means maybe the circumstances that prevailed are schedule they play with the academic requirements they have with their players, I think it's unrealistic to be a nine, 10 or 11-win football team every year," Davie said.

"Scheduling is tough and it should be like that," Faust said. "Everybody gets up for Notre Dame. Other schools, they only have two big games on their schedule every year; Notre Dame ends up with 11 because everybody's ready for them." 
Faust also said he understood the disappointment Willingham is likely experiencing after being let go.

"I felt we were in a place that I could no longer say that we could actually stand up and say that we were putting together a program in place that could contend, if not win, a national championship," White said in a Dec. 2, 2001 press conference. "I really believe we need to restart this thing." 
In 2001, it was White who recommended to University President Father Edward Malloy that Davie not be rein­stated in his sixth year, shortly after signing him to a five-year extension. Malloy agreed with him, and Davie was notified that day, as was the public. 
This year, it happened differ­ently.

Notre Dame won the AFCA Academic Achievement Award for gradu­ating 100 percent of its play­ers, the first time that number had reached 100 percent since 1988.

Davie's teams were academi-has exceeded all expectations in every way," White said. "As I just indicated in the statement, the academic performance is at a fever pitch; it's never been better. Tyrone has done some wonderful things." 
But, for both coaches, it came down to his on-field per­formance. Although both coaches went to a bowl game, neither came out with desir­able results. Davie took the Irish to the Fiesta Bowl in 2000, where they were blown out by Oregon State, 41-9. Willingham took the Irish to the Gator Bowl in 2002, where they were also blown out by North Carolina State, 28-6. 
In both firings, White empha­sized the need for both on and off-the-field performance. His sentiments were expressed again Tuesday. 
"And I do feel we've made some progress, as I've tried to articulate that in a statement," White said. "Just haven't made enough on game day.

Irish to three bowl games, including the BCS Fiesta Bowl at the conclusion of the 2000 season. But Davie also struggled in leading Notre Dame to two losing records, which eventually led to his fir­ing in 2001. 
Davie said Notre Dame coaches must win despite play­ing a rigorous schedule year in and year out. This puts any coach at Notre Dame at a sig­nificant disadvantage, Davie said.

Willingham firing compares, contrasts with Davie's; former coaches give opinions

available for comment, was the first Irish football coach to be fired without finishing his first contract, as he coached just 
three of the six years of his ini­tial contract and finished with a 21-15 record. 
Athletic director Kevin White attributed Willingham's short tenure to the high expectations at Notre Dame. 
"I think the best way I can respond to that is -there's very high expectations, compet­itive expectations relative to Notre Dame football," White said at Tuesday's press confer­ence. "I think everyone in the room realizes that, and we just were not meeting those pro­grammatic or competitive expectations on Saturday." 
It was similar but also differ­ent from 2001, the year Bob Davie was fired after five sea­sons and a 35-25 record. Then, White attributed the change in coaching to a need to start over.

If anybody understands what Tyrone Willingham is going through one day after being fired as Notre Dame's head _ football coach, it's Gerry Faust and Bob Davie. 
Faust coached the Irish from 1981-85, compiling a 30-26-1 record before resigning after his five-year contract expired. Davie took over the program ·after Lou Holtz resigned in 1996, leading the Irish to a 35­
25 record from 1997-2001. 

Both coaches didn't expect Willingham to be fired Tuesday, after three years as Irish coach. 
"I was surprised just like everybody else," Faust said. "When they accepted the bowl, I figured he'd keep his job because there's always talk. You lose a game there's talk, you win a game there's no talk and you're doing a great job. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with that. It's worth it at Notre Dame to go through that because of what Notre Dame is." 
Davie agreed. 

"To be honest, I'm sur­prised," Davie said in an inter­view with ESPN's Dan Patrick Tuesday evening. ''I'm sur­prised that Tyrone did not get the opportunity to finish his five years at Notre Dame." 
Willingham became the first Notre Dame coach to lose his job before fulfilling the terms of his initial contract. 
Faust endured a rocky five-

Another close road game ended in another victory for the No. 3 Irish, improving the team to 2-0 away from the Joyce Center and 7-0 on the season.

the free throw line to seal the lead as the Crusaders pulled to within a field goal with two minutes remaining.

Charel Allen and Teresa Borton each pulled down nine rebounds and scored six apiece in the team's second road vic­tory.

the team's first 13 ·points. Notre Dame would never relin­quish the lead, but the Crusaders remained within striking distance, cutting a 1 0­point lead to five with 13 min­utes remaining. 
In her second career road game, Allen came through with a crucial offensive rebound with 11 minutes to play. 
"She had a really big offen­sive rebound late in the game that we really had to have," McGraw said. "Then she got fouled and made the free throws." 
free throws were the bright-

est part of the Irish offense. The team shot just 41.7 per­cent from the field and 37.5 percent from beyond the arc. Notre Dame committed 10 turnovers to the Crusaders' seven. 
But the team came up strong when it counted. McGraw 
called  a  timeout  when  
Valparaiso  was  within  two  
points.  

"We ran a play for Jackie to score land] she made a nice shot," McGraw said. "She was able to convert it, that was big, we got [the lead] up to four and they never got any closer." 
DufTy connected on four free throws down the stretch to seal the win. 
Last year, Notre Dame start­ed 0-4 on the road. This year, the team has yet to register a loss. 
"I think its better leader­ship," McGraw said. "Megan and Jackie are playing so well right now, they're carrying the team. They made all the big plays and we're still looking for some other people to step up and help us."
