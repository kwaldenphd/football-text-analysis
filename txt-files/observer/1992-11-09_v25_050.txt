Right-to-Life members protest Chicago clinic 
By ALICIA REALE Assistant News Editor 
ND/SMC Right-to-Life partici­pated in a Chicago "rescue mis­sion" Saturday and demon­strated south of the Hesburgh Library yesterday. 
Notre Dame students Claire Johnson, Bill Keen, Dan Hoff­man and Alicia Scheidler, all members of the campus right­to-life group, were among 104 people arrested during protest at the Albany Medical Surgery Hospital in Chicago. 
Protesters were charged with resisting arrest and mob action, according to Johnson, group co­president. Four pro-choice people were also arrested. 
Protesters blocked entrances to two abortion clinics during the demonstration, which was organized by Operation Rescue­Chicago and Collegians Ac­tivated to Liberate Life (CALL), 
Clinton prepares for transition 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Bill Clinton will soon summon business leaders and economists to Little Rock, Ark., to advise him as he cements plans to stimulate the stagnant economy, leaders of the presi­dent-elect's transition team said Sunday. 
Part of the discussions will fo­cus on Clinton's plan to create a high-level council to coordinate economic policy, transition chairman Vernon Jordan and Warren Christopher, director of the transition team, said in separate television interviews. 
Clinton made the weak econ­omy the prime issue of his suc­cessful election campaign against President Bush, and has vowed to focus on it im­mediately after being sworn in as president. 
"Some time very soon ... the governor will convene in Little Rock business leaders, economists, a variety of people with expertise in the economy and international economy," said Jordan. appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press." 
Jordan said the meeting would be "about priorities and about his approach and about his new approach of having the economic security council very much similar to the National Security Council." 
On CBS's "Face the Nation," Christopher said the Little Rock meeting is "very much in the planning stage" but he expects it to happen in the next few weeks. 
He said the gathering will in­clude "people who run big companies or who are well known in the economics field." 
Christopher also said mem­bers of Congress would either be included in the meeting or consulted separately in Wash­ington. 
Jordan and Christopher said details of how the economic policy council would work re­mained undecided. 
But Christopher said, "Economic decision making will be given a higher priority,

according to Hoffman. 
Johnson said the protest was in response to a 13-year-old who died after having an abor­tion at the hospital. 
"Rescuers only seem radical because they are getting ar­rested," said Hoffman. "There is nothing radical about saving lives. It is radical for Christians to allow someone to die," said Johnson. 
"Four preborn babies were definitely saved," said Johnson. 
Participting pro-lifers met at the abortion center at 5 a.m. Saturday morning and blocked the doors to the clinic, said Johnson. Three rows of pro-lif­ers blocked entrances with locked arms, said Hoffman. Pro-life people locked them­selves to gates using neck and ankle locks. 
Participants also blocked the parking lot so the doctor could

INSIDE COLUMN 
Viewpoint won't 'candy coat' the real world 

One month ago, I wrote a column defending Irish singer Sinead O'Connor's freedom of expression. Individuals within and outside the Church 
Monica

applauded my defense of 

Yant

O'Connor's actions, 
Editor-in-Chief 

saying to deny her the 
right to express her -------­views, however inflammatory, would be to deny her the basic Christian tolerance and accep­tance we all require,. 
How quickly things change. 
A guest column in Thursday's Viewpoint 

section has incited the Notre Dame and Saint 
Mary's community for its anti-Semitic tone and 
content. The responses express utter disbelie 
that we would put hateful, discriminatory 
comments in print. 
But we did. 

To understand our reasoning, recall that The Observer is a student-run college newspaper, designed to provide a forum for free expression and to promote thoughtful inquiry -a goal tantamount to the University's mission, if its television commercials are true to form. As such, the publication is editorially independent of the Church and both academic institutions. 
For that matter, our readers are equally independent of the moral and ethical beliefs o the institutions The Observer serves. This is made painfully obvious every day by the spirited letters from faculty members urging the ordination of women, students protesting Church restrictions on pre-marital sex, and readers across the country engaging in an ongoing abortion debate. 
The Viewpoint section, unlike any other in the newspaper, is a home for these arguments. Its pages belong to our readers, to their thoughts, reactions and cynicism. If Viewpoint does anything, it empowers our readers; giving them something to think about and a pretty good chance to tell the world just what they're thinking. 
So by nature and by design, Viewpoint must be a forum for all issues-even those we as editors don't like very much. This unfortunately includes letters making racial slurs, gender stereotypes or condescending remarks about our staff: All are in some way, to some individual, painful -yet all deserve to be heard. 
Yet some argue today that Observer editors should be the moral arbiters of the Viewpoint pages, imposing our ethical judgments on others' opinions. 
This is a most dangerous suggestion, in light of its consequences. Professors: gone would be your anti-administration crusades which fly so swiftly on the pages of our publication. Students: gone would be your youthful revolutionizing. Readers: gone would be your Viewpoint section. 
Instead, if we give anyone the benefit of doubt, it's our readers. We'll feed you a stomach full every day, and leave it to you to digest accordingly. 
We won't candy-coat the world, for many of us realize we're already living in a sheltered environment. And if you're angered or repulsed by what you see in Viewpoint, you have our word that your response, or those similar, will have its day. 
So if something on the page carried with it a shock value that left you speechless, don't fret. You're probably not alone. But somewhere, someone like you might find the words. When they do, you'll see them in Viewpoint. The day you don't is the day we print nothing at all. 
The views expressed in the Inside Column are those of the author and not necessarily the views ofThe Observer.

Journalists spat upon 
 PARIS -Extreme rightists spat upon and beat journalists covering a political rally Sunday marking the 20th anniversary of the National Front. Reporters refused to cover the party leader's closing speech in response. A lightman for the television network TF-1 was knocked unconscious by assailants as other National Front supporters cheered and yelled "media fascists" at 50 reporters, photographers and television crews. The National Front has grown from obscurity to the third­largest political party in France on a platform of anti­Semitism and calls for expulsion of immigrants. Recent news reports have been critical of the group. Journalists, including AP photographer Jacques Brinon, said they left the rally because of anger and fear of more attacks. Several thousand people, including tattooed skinheads, turned out for the rally at a convention center.

Jordan tops highest paid athlete list 
 NEW YORK -Playing basketball is only an income supplement for superstars like Chicago Bulls guard Michael Jordan, who tops Forbes magazine's third­annual ranking of the world's highest-paid athletes. The really big bucks come from product endorsements, which earned Jordan an estimated $32 million in 1992. That's on top of the $3.9 million he made dribbling and slam dunking, Forbes said in its ranking of 40 top athletes, released Sunday. Jordan's contract with athletic footwear maker Nike Inc. for about $20 million is the most lucrative in sports.

Sports attorney to lecture today 
By GEORGE DOHRMANN News Writer 
Renowned sports attorney Leigh Steinberg will be speak­ing at Notre Dame today on the issue of sports marketing and key issues in professional sports. 
The presentation, organized by the Notre Dame MBA Mar­keting Association, will begin at 
4:15 and will be held at Hayes­Healy, room 120. 
Steinberg is considered by many to be the nation's leading professional sports attorney. He represents a wide array of athletes from the National Bas­ketball Association (NBA). Na­tional Football League (NFL) and Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Key issues which will be dis­cussed in the lecture are con­tract negotiations and the busi­ness of sports including TV, ca­ble, pay-per-view, merchandis­ing, specifics about clientele, and topical issues in football, basketball, and baseball. 
Although highly successful in other areas, Steinberg's success in negotiations with top NFL draft picks in recent years has created a high interest in sports representation. 
Over three of the last four years Steinberg has repre­sented the top pick in the draft. Jeff George, Troy Aikman and Russell Maryland all signed record-breaking contracts with NFL teams behind Steinberg's negotiating. 
Steinberg has also been suc­cessful in developing a number of charitable organizations with his famous clients. Each con­tract Steinberg negotiates in­cludes a clause for the players or team to benefit the area in

Dole seeks pardons for Iran­Contra scandal defendants 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Senate 
Minority Leader Robert Dole on 
Sunday called for an investiga­
tion of Iran-Contra prosecutor 
Lawrence Walsh and said Pres­
ident Bush should consider 
pardoning all defendants in the 
scandal. 
Dole called Walsh's office "a Democratic hotbed of Demo­cratic activist lawyers." A spe­cial prosecutor from the Justice Department should be brought in to determine "whether or not politics played any part" in a new indictment of ex-defense secretary Caspar Weinberger, Dole said on CBS's "Face the Nation." 
Walsh, a Republican, was deputy attorney general in the Eisenhower administration. 
Walsh denied there was any 
political motivation in the sec­

The protesters were arrested at approximately 9:45 a.m., ac­cording to Hoffman. They spent about 11 hours in jail cells, she said.

Dole said the Oct. 30 grand jury charge against Weinberger was obtained by a newly hired Walsh aide, James Brosnahan, who contributed $500 to Bill Clinton's campaign and whose law firm contributed $20,000 to the Clinton campaign. 
Dole suggested Clinton's campaign got advance notice from Walsh's office about the new Weinberger charges, be­cause a Clinton-Gore press re­lease reacting to the indictment and focusing on Bush was dated Oct. 29 -the day before the indictment. 
to "lay the seed for this sort of thing to happen more," according to Butrus. 
Overall, student reactions to the workshop were very posi­tive. 
"I was surprised it was as good as it was," said Lena Jef­ferson, a staff member in the Office of Campus Ministry, "No matter how well-learned we think we are, we can always broaden our horizons that much more." 
"It gave me an experience to live out for the rest of my life," said sophomore Dirk Bedford. 
Student Government plans to train about twelve people who attended the workshop to be facilitators who will be able to lead more Prejudice Reduction Workshops. Next year, they 
sign a pledge of non-violence, both physical and verbal." 
Many prayer supporters and counselors present were not arrested, according to Hoffman. 
Yesterday the group staged a visual demonstation to the south of the Library, titled "Graveyard of the Innocents." There are 1,800 crosses dis­played, "one cross for each aborted child in South Bend each year." Johnson said most are aborted in a clinic three blocks from campus. 
"I think people were startled and distressed by the display," she said. Usually the group puts up 100 crosses; they have never before used a number that means something, according to Johnson.

Name-reading begins at Vietnam memorial 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Read­ing of the 58,183 names on the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial began Sunday in a moving tribute marking the lOth an­niversary of the black granite monument. 
At noon, the first of 1,000 volunteers stood at the memo­rial, known as the "wall," and began reading the names of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. The reading will continue around the clock until 9 a.m. EST Wednesday, Veterans Day. 
Among the volunteers were activist Jesse Jackson; CNN correspondent Peter Arnett, who covered the war; ABC cor­respondent Jack Smith; and Jan Scruggs, a Vietnam veteran who worked to get the memorial built and organized the lOth anniversary cere­monies. 
Some Vietnam veterans visit­ing the wall were choked with emotion. 
Stewart Green, who served from 1967 to 1968 and again in 1969-70, said, "It was a very traumatic experience for me.... My fellow schoolmates that we went with ... the four of us that went over there, three of them didn't come back. It was like really moving for me." 
Another veteran, William Wright, told a reporter, "I can see troops in formation and it all comes back.... It hurts; it hurts a lot." 
Some 2.5 million people visit the wall every year, making it the most-visited memorial in the nation's capital. It also has become an emotional shrine for many Vietnam veterans and their relatives and friends. 

The reading of the names is among the events planned for Veterans Day and the memo­rial's lOth anniversary. Activi­ties will include a parade Wednesday and reunions for servicemen and women. 
In 1979 Scruggs, haunted that those killed in that war would fade into obscurity, vowed to build a memorial that would list every one of them by name. 

And for the past year Scruggs, now 42, has worked full time orgamzmg the 10-year commemoration, which began Friday. 
"Last summer I began thinking about the lOth an­niversary of this memorial, and how this was really an oppor­tunity to finish the job I had started -this whole idea of healing the nation's wounds, of doing something positive to help the nation put Vietnam behind it," said Scruggs, who lives in Columbia, Md. 
He now makes his living as a motivational speaker. 
One project that makes it easier for people to be reunited is an electronic database set up near the memorial and at ho­tels. 
Veterans can register their names, addresses and where they're staying in the Washing­ton area so their friends can lo­cate them. 
Anti-violence rally draws 350,000 
BERLIN (AP) -A call to arms against rightist violence in­spired 350,000 people to rally in the capital Sunday. But the day was spoiled by radical left­ists who threw rocks and eggs at Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Richard von Weizsaecker. 
The biggest demonstration since German unification two years ago was largely peaceful until Germany's top leaders joined the masses who marched from opposite sides of the city and converged for a huge rally in east Berlin's Lustgarten plaza. 
As the nation watched on television, a dozen police with shields and a pair of aides with umbrellas protected Weizsaecker from a flurry of objects hurled by leftist radicals as he spoke to the vast sea of people. 
Earlier, police had to whisk Kohl out of one of the marches when he was greeted by insults and boos, and eggs and stones flew from the crowd. Neither leader appeared to have been struck. 
The disruptions were another embarrassment for a govern­ment so rattled by a frightening surge in attacks on foreigners and Jewish monuments that it had to urge its people into the streets to denounce it. 
"I think it is tragic that the si­tuation is so bad that we have to go into the streets," said east Berliner Doris Schmid, 48, wearing a picture of famed Holocaust victim Anne Frank pinned to her jacket. "I think it is too late for us." 
"A firebomb must not become the symbol of our land," said Martin Steinbrecher, 56, a laid­off chemist who took a bus from the depressed east German Baltic port city of Wismar to attend the rally. 
Kohl blamed right-and left­wing "mobs" for trying to dis­rupt the rally. However, it ap­peared the disruptions were the work of the far-left anarchist scene, which advocates nothing less than the dissolution of Germany. 
The small, well-organized groups, with their trademark black hoods and Arab scarves, frequently try to disrupt official government functions. 
The rally was held one day before the 54th anniversary of Kristallnacht, or Crystal Night, the Nov. 9, 1938, Jewish pogrom that left streets littered with the glass of Jewish shops. 
It also came on the eve of the third anniversary of the open­ing of the Berlin Wall, which led to German unity and a con­

founding surge in nationalist violence by neo-Nazi groups and, increasingly, regular Germans. 
The rally was boycotted by Kohl's archconservtive Bavarian coalition partner, the Christian Social Union, which derided the demonstration as a weak and meaningless gesture. 
The party instead demanded that the government tighten the nation's asylum laws to stem a record tide of foreign refugees who have born the brunt of the more than 1,600 rightist attacks on foreigners this year. Eleven people have been killed. 
Kohl also is seeking to toughen the country's liberal asylum law, but the opposition Social Democrats so far have refused to give their support to the constitutional change that would be required. 
Many of the marchers -and Weizsaecker himself -blamed the fevered tone of the political debate for encouraging the vio­lence against foreigners. 
"I want the government to help save my life," said Due Ho Dao, 37, a Vietnamese guest worker from east Berlin who says he has been beaten and cursed by young neo-Nazi hoods. 

L.A. hopeful and skeptical about election's outcome 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -Some in the South Central community are hopeful that Bill Clinton will inspire racial unity, but others don't trust Democrats to do much for America's cities and say it's up to residents. 
A local race energized voters in the neighborhood that was ripped apart by riots last spring. And city propositions inspired by the riots had mixed results. 
Former U.S. Rep. Yvonne Brathwaite Burke narrowly de­feated her longtime friend, state Sen. Diane Watson, in a runoff for a county supervisor's seat, although Watson has challenged Burke's 775-vote victory margin, charging voting irregularities. 
Some absentee ballots also remain to be counted, and elections officials were expected to have further comment on the contested election this week. 
The race between the former sorority sisters who grew up in South Central brought people to the polls. Nearly 400,000 peo­ple cast ballots, compared with about 250,000 in the last su­pervisor's race, in 1988. 

Burke is known as a staid ne­gotiator in contrast to Watson's firebrand style. Both are Democrats and political fixtures in Los Angeles, and the winner becomes the first black elected to the nonpartisan board. 
"That race rallied the com­munity and got a lot of people involved in politics," resident Sylvia Perkins said of the Burke-Watson matchup. 
Burke served as a county su­pervisor in 1979 and 1980 as the appointed replacement for a supervisor who died. 
The presidential win of Bill Clinton had others in South Central optimistic. 
"We're the type of nation that's always bounced back ­and this is the first time (since the riot) that I've felt that way too," resident Robert Johnson said of the Democrats' victory.

Angry voters attempt recall of La. governor 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) -Gov. 

Edwin Edwards, who claimed 
the governor's mansion for an 
unprecedented fourth time last 
year when the choice was be­
tween him and David Duke, is 
facing the second recall drive of 
his scandal-plagued career. 
"Elect the Crook -It's Im­

portant" urged bumper stickers 
displayed during the 1991 
campaign by people who found 
the prospect of Duke as 
Louisana's governor repellent. 
Duke is a former Ku Klux Klan 
leader. 
Now the state is dotted with 

bumper stickers urging "Recall 
the Crook -It's Important." 
"We were faced with a non­

choice," Steve Lindsley, state 
coordinator for the recall drive. 
"Neither of those guys should 
be in office, so we said, 'Why 
don't we recall the one who 
wins?~ 
Edwards, once renowned for his wheeling, dealing, woman­izing, gambling and colorful quips, vowed that he was a changed man after his landslide victory over Duke. But his critics say it's the same old Ed­wards. 
"After Edwards won, some people wanted to wait and give him a chance," Lindsley said. "Well, he hadn't changed. So here we are." 
Leaders of Recall-92, angered in part by Edwards' support of casino gambling, have until Dec. 14 to submit 7 40,000 sig­natures, or one-third of the state's 2.1 million voters, to force an election. They claim they already have more than 400,000 signatures. 
Ted Schirmer, a Baton Rouge attorney, launched the recall drive in June, soon after the Legislature approved a bill 
backed by Edwards to allow 
casino gambling in New Or­
leans. 

Critics say Edwards rammed 
the bill through and accepted a 
vacation from Christopher 
Hemmeter, a developer who 
won the right to build a $415 
million casino. State ethics offi­
cials said Edwards and other 
officials who took trips did 
nothing illegal since they reim­
bursed Hemmeter. 

Edwards says the recall drive doesn't worry him. Asked if he thought it would be successful, he said, with a laugh, "I think not." 
A French-speaking Cajun and the son of sharecroppers, Ed­wards, 65, built his political ca­reer with the support of blacks, labor and New Deal Democrats. 
Louisianians found Edwards a loveable rogue. But the mys­tique wore thin as the state's economy soured and investiga-

Ex-presidents' pensions costing taxpayers $17.2 million 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Presi­dent Bush is about to join the nation's most elite group of pensioners -and the costliest to taxpayers. 
With the inauguration of Bill Clinton as his successor Jan. 20, Bush will bring to five the number of former presidents ­joining Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in comfortable, taxpayer-provided retirement. 
The cost, including Secret Service protection, totals $17.2 million this year for the first four. Congress will have to provide more money next year to cover Bush's retirement. 
"The budget did not contem­plate him becoming a former president," said Bill Early, budget director for the General Services Administration. 
Even without the security, the taxpayers' bill for a generous, six-figure pension, office space, staff and travel expenses ap­proaches half a million dollars for each of the former presi­dents -and more in the case of Reagan: $770,900 this fiscal year. 
But security is the most ex­pensive item. Only Nixon among the former presidents does not have full-time Secret Service protection. He waived all Secret Service protection in 1985. 
Congress has provided $15

million for Secret Service pro­tection of the other three former presidents this year. 
"It's 24 hours a day," said Early. "That's expensive -and it's forever." 
The cost of protecting former presidents drew notice when Reagan made a highly publi­cized trip to Japan in 1989. He collected $2 million in hono­raria from a Japanese corpora­tion while U.S. taxpayers paid for his traveling security agents. 
A provision added to an ap­propriations bill this year at the behest of Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., requires the director of the Secret Service to meet with each of the former presidents by next spring to dis­cuss their protection and its cost. The idea is to find ways to cut or eliminate the security. 
"I am convinced that there are many viable alternatives to the current protection program which will ensure a commensu­rate level of security for former presidents and their families at a much lower cost to the taxpayer," he said. 
DeConcini, chairman of a Se­nate Appropriations subcom­mittee that oversees the upkeep of former presidents, sought a provision that would have eliminated Secret Service protection 10 years after a president left office, unless otherwie necessary. 

But that drew opposition from the former presidents and was eliminated in a House-Senate conference this fall, according to congressional aides. DeConcini said Bush showed no interest in trying to cut the costs. 
By law, former presidents are provided with a yearly pension equal to that of the current salary of a Cabinet secretary. This year, the amount is $143,800. 
In addition, the government provides for the rental of office space and staff salaries for the rest of a former president's life. 
N.Y. state judge arrested in extortion scheme 
ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -Sol Wachtler, chief of the state's court system, frequently has been mentioned as a potential Republican candidate for gov­ernor or a possible U.S. Supreme Court nominee. 
On Sunday, he was being held in a hospital psychiatric ward, charged by federal authorities with threatening a former girlfriend and her daughter in an extortion scheme. 
"It's so out of character," said Mary Bourbon, spokeswoman for the state's Office of Court Administration. She said Wachtler attended a dinner for court employees just last week. 
"He was cordial, dignified ­his usual self," she said. 

Wachtler, 62, was arrested Saturday by FBI agents on charges he harassed his former lover, tried to extort money from her and threatened to kidnap her 14-year-old daughter. He was picked up while driving to his home on Long Island. 
Wachtler faced a bail hearing in federal court Tuesday, said FBI spokesman Joe Valiquette. Valiquette wouldn't say why Wachtler was being held in the psychiatric ward. 
As chief judge of New York's seven-member Court of Ap­peals, Wachtler presides over the state court system and its more than 5,000 judges. 
His term doesn't expire until

1999, although he could volun­tarily suspend himself from the $120,000-a-year post pending the outcome of the case, or be suspended by the other mem­bers of the court. 
As of Sunday, the court had taken no action, DeBourbon said; the court is not scheduled to meet until Nov. 17. 
Wachtler was accused of making threatening calls since April to a New York woman and sending sexually explicit letters to her and her daughter. 
He acted out of anger after his relationship with the woman ended about a year ago, authorities said. 
Wachtler has been married for 41 years and is the father of four. His wife, Joan, told a Daily News reporter outside the fam­ily's Manhasset condominium she knew nothing about the charges. 
"I don't understand any of it," she said. She also said there were no difficulties in their marriage: "No problems at all." 
While the criminal complaint identified the other woman only as "J.S.," several news organizations said she was Joy Silverman, a wealthy socialite and major Republican fundraiser. 
She once was nominated by President Bush to be ambas­sador to Barbados, but the Se­nate Foreign Relations Commit­tee killed the nomination after Democrats claimed her only qualification was as a GOP fund raiser. 
There was no answer Sunday at her Manhattan home. 
Authorities said Wachtler demanded $20,000 in exchange for "embarrassing" tapes and photographs, purportedly of the woman and her new boyfriend. 
Wachtler, a liberal Republi­can, has frequently been touted as a potential candidate for governor. He was named chief judge in 1985 by Gov. Mario Cuomo, a Democrat. 
"For all the years I have 

known Sol Wachtler his in­
tegrity and character have been 
beyond question," Cuomo said. 
"His life has earned him the 
presumption of innocence that 
the law guarantees him." 
State GOP Chairman William 

Powers said he felt "shock and 
dismay." He said he knew 
nothing of an affair between 
Wachtler and Silverman. 
Sources familiar with the probe, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sunday that Wachtler had been tailed by agents after a caller had told the woman to leave $20,000 in the basement of a Manhattan building.

Heavy fighting hinders relief efforts Greenpeace ship collides 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herze­

govina (AP) -Relief flights into 
Sarajevo were temporarily 
halted Sunday by heavy fighting 
near the airport. The city was 
without water and electricity 
for a third straight day. 
Government radio said there 

also was continued fighting in 
central Bosnia and renewed 
clashes in the western part of 
the country. 
The head of the local Red Cross, meanwhile, appealed to the United Nations to provide escorts for more than 6,000 people trying to flee the be­sieged capital. Winter is setting in, and food and medicine are in short supply. 
A 10-truck aid convoy bound for Sarajevo was stopped near Mostar because of the fighting, a U.N. official in the Croatian port of Split said, and a group of Danish U.N. peacekeepers were stopped by Serbs on the road from Belgrade. 
In Belgrade, Yugoslav federal Premier Milan Panic urged the West to ease sanctions imposed in May against Yugoslavia for fueling the Bosnian war. He said this would give him politi­cal leverage to defeat Slobodan Milosevic, the hard-line nation­alist president of Serbia, in Dec. 20 elections. 
"Time is running out," said Panic, a U.S. citizen who formerly headed a California pharmaceuticals firm. "If (Western nations) don't help, they will soon have more Bosnias in the Balkans, but I will not be here to prevent it." 
Panic, named premier in July in a bid by Yugoslav leaders to improve the country's image, has quickly built his popularity. Panic could either challenge Milosevic directly for the Ser­
bian presidency, or head a 
party list for either the federal 
or Serbian parliaments. 

Milosevic, a former Commu­nist who advocates a "Greater Serbia," has been widely blamed for supporting the Bosnian Serb rebels, as well as for pushing for attacks by Yu­goslavia-now comprising only of Serbia and Montenegro ­against Croatia and Slovenia last year. 
Bosnia's civil war began in April after minority ethnic Serbs rebelled against a vote by Bosnia-Herzegovina's Muslims and Croats to secede from Yu­goslavia. More than 14,000 people have been killed in the fighting. 
Serbs have taken control of two-thirds of the country, with much of the rest occupied by ethnic Croats, who the past month have broken from an al­liance with the Muslim-led gov­ernment. The government now controls only about a half-dozen cities and towns. 
Heavy artillery barrages erupted about 5 a.m. near the Sarajevo airport and subsided about two hours later, U.N. of­ficials said. 
A French U.N. officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the airport was closed to incoming flights. But Mike Aitchinson, a U.N. flight officer in Zagreb, the staging point for the relief missions, blamed bad weather and said flights resumed 90 minutes later. 
Iran has sent at least three planeloads of food, clothes and other essentials to Bosnian Muslims, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Sunday. The Islamic nation also plans to open an aid office in the Croat­
ian capital, Zagreb, to speed 
distribution, the report said. 

There has been concern about Iranian aid since September, when Croatian of­ficials seized a planeload of arms and ammunition sent from Tehran in violation of a 
U.N. embargo. 

Government radio said Bosnia's heaviest fighting Sun­day again was in Olovo and Maglaj, towns north-northwest of Sarajevo. Clashes also were reported in Mostar and Capljina, both predominantly Croat areas of western Herze­govina. 
Olovo has been the scene of intense battles for weeks, as ethnic Serbs seek to take Tuzla, a key point in the Serb supply line. 
Apart from the western sur­burbs near the airport, Sara­jevo was relatively quiet Sun­day, with only occasional gun­fire echoing off surrounding hills. 
On Saturday, ethnic Croats frustrated by repeated delays of a promised evacuation convoy tried to walk out of Sarajevo but were turned back by armed guards. 
Pava Barisic, head of the Red Cross head in Sarajevo, ap­pealed for U.N. escorts for the convoys and asked the Inter­national Committee of the Red Cross to use its influence. 
The army originally approved the evacuation effort but changed its mind, fearing able­bodied men would flee and thus reduce the pool of eligible fight­ers, Red Cross organizers said. 
An agreement was reached over the weekend to resume convoys this week. 
IU students given consumer survey 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP)­

Student leaders at Indiana Uni­
versity are working to make 
critical consumers of other stu­
dents in the wake of the rising 
costs of going to college. 
For the first time, the IU Stu­

dent Association says it plans to 
survey students on their expe­
rience with course registration, 
which sometimes means long 
lines and leaves some students 
without courses they want. 
IU Student Association repre­sentatives also plan to ensure that most students get faculty course evaluation reports at registration time. 
The books, which contain student evaluations of teachers, have been available at various locations in the past, but have not been passed out while students are signing up for courses. 
"We're trying to be more pro­active," said Lia Ozolins, 23, a senior from Edmond, Okla., and IUSA vice president for administration. "Maybe students are beginning to won-

Ozolins said the efforts should help students think more about the quality of teaching, some­thing many feel has become secondary to research at IU. 
Student fees at IU and many of the nation's colleges have in­creased at a higher rates than the consumer price index. At the Bloomington campus, the problem in part is tied to state support failing to keep up with costs such as library materials and research equipment. 
Ozolins said she was able to get the schedule she wanted this semester, but has heard others who have had problems. 
Randy Parker, who coordi­nates course offerings at IU's College of Arts and Sciences, said the school had run out of intensive writing courses, but three more have been added. 
Parker said he has funding available to add more sections as needed and when possible. 
"We're trying very hard to meet the demand, not just by putting the money forward, but by watching it carefully and re­sponding where the need is," he said.

with Japanese escort ship 
PARIS (AP) -A Japanese escort ·sqip collided Sunday with a Greenpeace boat track­ing a freighter laden with highly toxic plutonium, the Greenpeace crew said. 
Japan is shipping the pluto­nium home to fire up a new generation of nuclear fast­breeder reactors. Greenpeace opposes the shipment and is tracking it, saying the pluto­nium poses huge dangers ranging from a spill to an at­tack by terrorists seeking nu­clear bomb-making material. 
The freighter Akatsuki Maru, carrying 1.7 tons of plutonium, slipped out of the French port of Cherbourg late Saturday after a day of violent clashes between security forces and environmentalists. 
The vessel's route on its two­month voyage to Yokohama is secret. But Greenpeace said the freighter and its armed escort, a Japanese warship, were sail­ing southwest in the Atlantic and could reach Portugal's Azores Islands by Wednesday. 
The sideswipe collision in the English Channel damaged the helicopter landing decks of the warship Shikishima and the Greenpeace boat Solo, the group said. There were no re­ported injuries. 
"Those guys are pirates. It's unbelievable," said Greenpeace spokesman Eloi Glorieux, con­tacted by radio from Paris. "They rammed into us from the port side." 
Japanese officials in Tokyo re­fused to comment. 
Greenpeace Capt. Albert Kuiken said the Shikishima was badly dented on the starboard side. He said a side railing also was ripped off. Damage to the Solo was described as light. 
France, a leader in nuclear technology, treats fuel for sev­eral countries. The Akatsuki Maru's plutonium was ex­tracted from spe,nt Japanese reactor fuel at a plant near Cherbourg.

The Observer is the independent newspaper published by the students of the University of Notre Dame du Lac and Saint Mary's College. it does not necessarily reflect the policies of the administration of either institution. The news is reported as accurately and objectively as possible. Unsigned editorials represent the opinion of the majority of the Editor-in-Chief, Managing Editor, News Editor, Viewpoint Editor, Accent Editor, Photo Editor, Sports Editor, and Saint Mary's Editor. Commentaries, letters and Inside Column present the views of the authors. Column space is available to all members of the community and the free expression of varying opinions on campus through letters is encouraged. 
Cheney's fascist drivel isn't historically factual 

Printing column serves no good 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to L. Clifford Cheney' s Guest Col­umn, which was entitled "Jewish Slave Law must be abolished before it destroys" (The Observer, Nov. 5). 
It is absolutely disgusting that any newspaper would ever lower itself to print such sophomoric, xenophobic, fascist drivel. 
Obviously, the staff of The Observer has decided for the Notre Dame community that Cheney' s statement of hate and idiocy should be heard above the din of more important matters such as the filming of Rudy or yet another statement of the University's mission. 
Perhaps Cheney is so dis­gruntled because his white hood and sheet were lost at the cleaners. 
Where on earth did the Ob­server discover this guest columnist? The David Duke Guide to Closet Racism? 
Since when did the Jewish people start WWI? Whatever happened to factual history? Two questions for Mr. Cheney: 
A) What history book has he been reading and B) Did he burn it after he read it? 
Nazism is as much against Catholicism as it is against Ju­daism. What sort of sense does Cheney have sending this trash to a newspaper at a Catholic University? 
Some clues for Mr. Cheney: 

1. 
Eva Braun died years ago; you aren't impressing anyone. 

2. 
Public cross burnings get this type of point across more effectively than a collegiate newspaper does. 

3. 
Mein Kampf doesn't make sense no matter how many times you read it. 


Hopefully in the future, The Observer will be able to find something better resembling coherent writing to place in the Guest Column. 
The world does not need any more racists and certainly does not need any periodicals spreading their divisive opinions. 
Karl Scheidt 
Stanford Hall 
Nov. 5, 1992 Dear Editor: 

I am writing in reference to the Viewpoint article of L. Clif­ford Cheney, "Jewish Slave Law must be abolished before it destroys," (The Observer, Nov.5). Cheney's tract was an unspeakably anti-semitic pas­tiche of innuendo and historical distortion, ill-camouflaged by quotes from scripture. 
Its inclusion reflects badly on both The Observer and the University. The editors should be ashamed of themselves for having accorded it the sixty square inches of newspaper its publication required. 
As an example of the essay's intellectual irresponsibility, consider its opening sentence. There, Cheney says that "[t]he American Civil War was fought to try to rid Jewish Slave Law from American soil". 
That Lincoln fought the Civil War for this reason, rather than to abolish chattel slavery or to preserve the Union, is a histor­ical claim too ludicrous to be seriously entertained. (The au­thor's infelicitous expression of his idea itself betrays the fuzzi­ness his thought. 
Cheney's syntax suggests that he thinks Lincoln wanted to get American soil off the Jewish Slave Law; presumably Cheney means things the other way 'round.) Indeed the only thing to be said favor of the essay's opening claim is that, bad as it is, it is the high point of the article. 
The rest of the author's "argument" does not merit a response, and I have no inten­tion of dignifying it with one. I do, however, want to point out the serious lapse of editorial judgment shown by those on The Observer staff who decided to print Cheney's article. 
It is very hard to see what good purpose could possibly be served by printing Cheney's article. Did someone on The Observer's editorial board seri­ously believe that this essay could promote reasoned debate on campus about how to solve America's economic problems? 
Did anyone think that Ch­eney's premises are plausible historical or economic theses that deserve examination at a center of higher learning? 
Did anyone at The Observer really believe that political discussion at Notre Dame could be advanced by an argument so utterly without merit and so obviously motivated by the most unconscionable bigotry? 
The editors of any publication have to weigh a number of re­sponsibilities in deciding what to print. Among their responsi­bilities is the dissemination of ideas, including ideas which stimulate, provoke or even outrage. 
Perhaps this is a duty that weighs especially heavily on publications at universities, since universities themselves exist for the exchange of ideas and for the discovery and transmission of truth. It surely does not follow, however, that The Observer or any other publication has an obligation to publish every outrageous or provocative editorial that it re­ceives. 
What editors should consider is the statement they make about their readership when deciding what to publish. 
Printing Cheney's essay is an insult to the Notre Dame community since it suggests that the editors think there are people in our community who would find Cheney's piece worth considering. 
It reflects very badly on Notre Dame since some outside the University might make the mistaken assumption that the editors are correct in their assessment of their readers. 
Moreover, Vatican II wrote in 1965 that the Church "deplores all hatreds, persecutions and displays of anti-semitism leveled at any time or from any source against the Jews". 
By printing Cheney's article and thereby suggesting that some Catholics might deem it worth considering, The Ob­server recalls the unfortunate incidents of Catholic anti­semitism that the Church meant to repudiate. 
It also suggest that some of its readers reject the Council's teaching on this question. The Observer thus fails American Catholicism as well as Notre Dame. 
The right to free speech is absolutely necessary, and I would not want the government to prevent Cheney's exercise of that right. But I see absolutely no reason why The Observer should provide him an opportunity for that exercise and a great many reasons why it should not. 
urge the editors to apologize, to state how this essay was submitted to The Ob­server, and to explain their edi­torial policy regarding submis­sions of this kind.

By JIM MALLOY 
Literary Critic 
"Travels With Ted and Ned," is a book written by Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, giving an account of the 18 months he and Fr. Edmund Joyce spent traveling around the world after their retirement. 
In 1987, Hesburgh ended his 35 years as President of the University of Notre Dame. Joyce, Hesburgh's Executive Vice President and close friend, retired with him and the two decided to travel. Their adventure was anything but common and most importantly it gave the two friends time to really get to know each other. 
From June, 1987, to December, 1988, Hesburgh and Joyce visited the western United States, Latin America, the Caribbean, the South Pacific, Africa. Asia, Australia and Antarctica. "Travels With Ted and Ned" is a published version of the daily diary Hesburgh kept during his journey. 
Hesburgh and Joyce were con­stantly on the move during their prolonged vacation, returning to Notre Dame on only a few occasions. 
The adventure began with a western cross-country trek in a recreational vehicle or RV. Hesburgh and Joyce seemed to have as much fun discovering the intricate workings of their RV as they did viewing the wonderful scenery around them. 
Throughout the book, Hesburgh displays an engaging, self­deprecating sense of humor, explaining how his close friends and associates wagered that he and Joyce would never make it past Gary, Ind. They managed quite well. however, logging over 11,000 miles on the road and over 6,000 in the air on the Alaskan portion of their trip. 
The second leg of the journey was a tour of the countries of Latin America. This section of the book includes brief descriptions of conversations with several Latin American dignitaries, including President Duarte of El Salvador, a former Notre Dame student and President Aylwin of Chile, who spoke at Notre Dame's commencement last year. 
But Hesburgh spends less time on the political aspects of Latin American society than he does skillfully describing the history of the people and the culture. 
The third and fourth phases of the trip took place aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2 (QE2), one of the largest and most luxurious ocean liners in the world. The first trip aboard the QE2 was a "warm-up drill"-a three-week Caribbean cruise. The second trip was a cruise across the world, covering more than 30,000 miles and lasting more than 100 days. 
Hesburgh and Joyce earned their keep by serving as chaplains aboard the QE2. Their duties as chaplains included celebrating daily Mass, counseling the troubled, comforting and anointing the sick, and even herding a few lost Catholics back into the fold, according to Hesburgh. 
The last leg of the journey involved sailing to the South Pole and Antarctica on the Society Explorer, the ship which carried them across the Amazon River during their visit to Latin America. 
"Travels With Ted and Ned" is filled with enough information to nearly qualify it as a text for both a history and a geography class. It also has ROignant moments, especially Hesburgh's tribute to Joyce. The renewal of old friendships Hesburgh has formed around the globe and the amazingly frequent encounters with ND alumni all over the world are also touching. 
The main purpose of the book other than recounting the travels of Hesburgh and Joyce is to prove to people who are about to retire that there is a wonderful, exciting adventure awaiting them in retirement. 
Hesburgh writes, "This book, therefore, isn't just about travel, as much fun as travel can be. Fundamentally, it's a book about totally changing one's ordinary, lifelong way of living without coming apart at the seams. It's a book about enjoying, not dreading retirement. And yes, it's about stopping-stopping, at long last, to smell the roses. We've done just that." 

Saint Mary's to celebrate aspects of women's education 
By MARA DIVIS 
Saint Mary's Accent Editor 
Saint Mary's College will cele­brate and examine aspects of women's education this week as different academic departments focus on Mary Wollstonecraft and her work, according to English department faculty and students. 
Mary Wollstonecraft, a late 18th century feminist writer, was noted for her work, "A Vin­dication of the Rights of Woman," which centered on the need for further advancement and education for women, ac­cording to Assistant Professor of English Laura Haigwood. 

The focus of the week is "very appropriate for our school and its focus on women's education," she said. "Any advancement of women depends on greater education." 
The week's events are actually a collaboration of several departments and their particular ideas, according to 
Tom Bonnell, chair of the English Department, who co­coordinated the week with senior Renee Young. 
The week will include lectures and panel presentations both from within the college commu­nity and from noted Woll­
stonecraft  and  feminist  
scholars,  according  to  
Haigwood.  

Speakers include Frances Sh­erwood, of the English Depart­ment at Indiana University South Bend. Sherwood, a well-
known author, is a past recipient of the 0. Henry prize for short fiction and will read from her forth coming novel about feminism today. 
A faculty panel will concentrate on "Feminism and the Family" on Tuesday. Ann Clark of the Philosophy De­partment and Mary Caputi of the Political Science Department speak and debate on the ways in which feminism fits into today's image of family life, Haigwood said. 
Diana Meyers of the Philosophy Department at the University of Connecticut, will address philosophical aspects of women and the Wollstonecraft legend in her talk, "Beyond impartial reason, different empathy and rights" on Thursday. 
Moira Ferguson, of the de­partment of English at the Uni­versity of Nebraska, will speak tonight on "Gender and Politics of 'Race'," in Stapleton Lounge at 7:30p.m.

Brooks reaches milestone in sterling effort

The run was nothing spec­tacular. 
Reggie Brooks swept left and used a couple of solid blocks to squirt forward along the side­line and pick up about nine yards. 
But with that second-quarter gain, Brooks reached a signifi­cant milestone, becoming only the fourth Notre Dame player, and the first since Lou Holtz

Irish stay put, Miami alone at top 
Miami, which has lost the No. 1 ranking twice this season, regained the top spot again in Sunday's Associated Press col­lege football poll. 
The Hurricanes had the weekend off, -but moved up a notch after then-No. 1 Wash­ington lost to Arizona 16-3 Sat­urday. 
Miami is only the fourth team to be No. 1 three different times in one season. The others were Notre Dame (1947), Tennessee (1951) and Alabama (1962). 
The Hurricanes (8-0) re­ceived 61 first-place votes and 1,549 points from a nationwide panel of sports writers and broadcasters. The other first­place vote went to Alabama (9­0), which rose one spot to No. 2 after beating LSU 31-11. 
If Miami and Alabama go 11­0, they will meet in the Sugar Bowl for the national title. Mi­ami is trying to become the first team to win consecutive championships since Alabama in 1978-79. 
"I feel pretty good, but the season isn't over yet," Miami receiver Horace Copeland said. "We still have to play Syracuse and San Diego State. I'm not too happy yet." 
Miami lost its No. 1 ranking for the first time after strug­gling to beat Arizona 8-7 in late September. But Arizona helped the Hurricanes on Saturday by ending Washington's 22-game winning streak. 
"It makes our one-point vic­tory over Arizona look real good," Miami defensive tackle Mark Caesar said. "There should be no doubt who's No. 1." 
Michigan (8-0-1) climbed one place to No. 3 after beating Northwestern 40-7, and Texas 
· A&M (9-0) moved up a notch to No. 4 with a 40-18 victory over Louisville. Florida State (8-1) rose one spot to No. 5 after routing Maryland 69-21, and Washing­ton (8-1) fell to No. 6. Nebraska (7 -1) remained No. 7 after overpowering Kansas 49-7, and Notre Dame (7-1-1) re­mained No. 8 after handing Boston College its first loss, 54­7.

to bring down, Brooks showed off both his agility and speed Saturday in gaining 174 yards, 73 of them on one second-quarter touchdown run. 
On third down and 20. Brooks punched through the middle and was met by a gathering of Eagle tacklers near the Irish 30-yard line. Boston College linebacker Tom McManus, the Eagles' defensive leader, put a hit on Brooks but couldn't wrap up the slippery tailback. 
"I spun off one guy (McManus) and looked upfield and there was a big open hole," said Brooks, who scampered toward the goal line, outrun­ning every Boston College de­fender and putting the Irish up 34-0. 
Rather than his strong legs, Brooks used his soft hands for his other touchdown run Sat­urday. Rick Mirer, running the option to the right on a play from the Boston College one-yard line, waited an eternity before flipping an awkward pitch toward Brooks, who guided the ball toward his body with his left hand, kept his other eye on the goal line and dancing into the end zone. 
Despite Brooks' overwhelm­ing success this season, he was seen as a major question mark entering this year's football season. Following the departure of Reggie's brother Tony and fellow senior Rodney Culver to the NFL, the tailback position was the subject of much worry entering fall practice. 
Brooks, junior Willie Clark and sophomore Lee Becton were the only candidates for the starting tailback position. Brooks, with his experience and emerging skills, as well as improved confidence, outplayed the other backs in practice and earned the spot. 
But doubts still lingered about Brooks as a runner. After all, his career total for carries was 31, about the number that a typical Reisman trophy candi­date gets in a single game. 
Despite his place as part of a 
Lou Holtz offense which stresses balance, between both the run and the pass and be­tween players, Brooks has earned the right to be men­tioned in Reisman Trophy talk with the Marshall Faulks and Garrison Hearsts of the world, who as their respective teams' lone offensive weapons, get to earry the football dozens upon dozens of times each week. 
"It goes to show what our re­eeivers and our line are capable of doing," said Brooks, ever slippery when it comes to self­praise. "We came out Saturday with an attitude that we had to capitalize on all our opportuni­
ties."

The Notre Dame volleyball team swept a conference dou­bleheader over the weekend, setting the stage for a battle of Midwestern Collegiate Confer­ence unbeatens against Loyola. The 21st-ranked Irish (24-5, 4­
0) defeated Dayton and Xavier and will travel to Chicago to face the Ramblers on Thursday. 
Notre Dame finished off both matches in three games, taking extra points to do so in one game each night. The Irish beat Dayton 16-14, 15-1, 15-6 and Xavier 15-9,15-1,19-17. 
With Notre Dame favored heavily on Friday night, Dayton (24-6, 5-2) proved it would not roll over and die by taking a 14­8 lead in game one. Irish head coach Debbie Brown was natu­rally concerned, but she put her finger on the problem im­mediately. 
"We really had trouble block­ing in the first game," Brown assessed. "We weren't antici­pating well and could not stop their hitters. A little over halfway through the game, we made the adjustment and played well throughout the rest of the match." 

The Irish played well enough, in fact, to complete a stunning comeback and win the first game. The eight unanswered Notre Dame points took the wind out of the Flyers' sails. The Irish cruised the rest of the way, led by a balanced offense. Outside hitter Marilyn Cragin unleashed eight kills, and mid­dle blockers Jessica Fiebelkorn and Molly Stark added seven and six, respectively. 
Saturday's contest against Xavier (19-11, 3-4) was never in doubt. The starters racked up big wins in game one and two, while the second team fought out a nail-biter in the third. Brown stayed with her non-starters late in the game, and they responded. 
"We played everyone and didn't put the starters back in," she said. "I felt it was impor­tant to get the substitutes some playing time, especially playing time under pressure." 
Shannon Tuttle, the backup for starting setter Janelle Kar­lan, took over in the second and third games. Brown lauded both setters for performing well. She was also impressed with the play of outside hitters Alycia Turner and Nicole Coates. 
"Alycia had some key kills down the stretch," Brown said of the senior captain, "and Ni­cole's jump-serving was the best it's been all year. She served 12 or 13 times and had four aces with no errors. " 
Every player on the Irish roster notched at least one kill in the match, led by Fiebelkorn with 11. Molly Stark had 12 digs.

Ling and Davide DaiGrande (1 assist) had exceptional games," said Notre Dame's coach. "We've improved in a specific area each week and we've given an honest and solid effort each game. 
"Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes, become better conditioned and avoid breakdowns." 
Throughout the first three weeks of the season, the Irish have kept games close into the final period. Their opponents have pulled away late in their games, which Shafer attributes to a lack of experience. 
Their next contest will be Friday at 7:00 PM in the Joyce Fieldhouse, when the Irish host CCHA foe Illinois-Chicago.

additional yards on 11 more carries. 
Foley, the nation's fourth­rated passer, struggled to com­plete 11-for-28 for 121 yards. Notre Dame pressured Foley all day, sacking him three times. 
"Defensively, our attitude is getting better," said linebacker Devon McDonald. "We knew if we played tough defense, our offense could put up the points. We worked on our pass rush all week. I'm sure we've doubled our sacks from last year (11 last season, 23 this season), and hopefully, we'll triple it by the end of the year." 
BC got their initial first-down on their third possession of the game. But on the next play, Irish linebacker Karl McGill's hit Foley popping the ball loose. Brian Hamilton recovered on the Eagles' 21, and Mirer scored on the option play to put the Irish up 21-0. 
Foley admitted being sur­prised by Notre Dame's pass rush. "They did some different things. They stunted and sent different guys on different plays, and even when they didn't send people, there was a lot of pressure," said Foley, who also gave credit the quick Irish defensive backs. 
Notre Dame also dominated on the offensive line of scrim­mage, amassing 576 total yards, 340 on the ground. Reggie Brooks found huge holes behind his offensive line, cutting and slashing through the Eagles secondary for 178 yards on 18 carries. 
Brooks took a Mirer handoff and broke linebacker Tom McManus' tackle, then broke away from the pack and ram­bled 73 yards for a TD, to make the score 34-0 with 9:53 re­maining in the second period. Brooks scored from one yard out on the previous possession. 
Jerome Bettis, hobbled by an ankle injury, was limited to just 26 yards on five carries. 
"Brooks and Bettis played very well, but we also had to worry about Becton, Lytle and Mirer," lauded Coughlin. Lytle picked up the slack at fullback, carrying eight times for 43 yards. Becton added 35 yards on seven rushes, while Mirer went 13 for 18 with 180 yards and three TD's. 
Mirer utilized his backfield as pass receivers, accounting for all three scores. The first came when Mirer faked a handoff to Bettis at the nine yard line to freeze the Eagles defense, and hit wide-open tailback Lee Bec­ton streaking for the right corner of the endzone on a perfectly executed timing pat­tern. It was the first reception of Becton's career. 


On the next possession, Mirer hit Bettis cutting across the field. Bettis eluded cornerback Joe Kamara at the ten yard line and scampered in for a 37 -yard TD. 
Jeff Burris' first career pass 
reception, 
a nine­
yard TD 
grab at 
11:16 in the third, made the score 44­
0. Before Saturday, the Irish backfield 
had accounted for only 14 receptions, 11 from Bettis. The new wrinkle in Holtz's playbook emerged in last week's game against Navy, when Brooks caught a 24-yard TD pass. 
Holtz also displayed punter Craig Hentrich's open-field running talents. "We came into the game knowing that we were going to run the fake punt," said Holtz, who called for it on Notre Dame's first possession of the second half on fourth-and­one. 
Hentrich faked as if to pass, then bolted to the vacated right side for a 16 yard gain. It pre­served the drive and set up the Burris touchdown. 
Boston College entered Notre Dame territory only three times all game. 
A Dukes fumble on a Demetrius DuBose hit thwarted a 58-yard Eagles drive at the Irish 25 earlier in the fourth quarter. 

And a Burris interception in the endzone stopped the Eagles in the third quarter. They got the ball at Notre Dame's 13 off a fumbled punt by Mike Miller, but couldn't get anything started. Under heavy pressure from McDonald on fourth-and­11, Foley tried to hit Ivan Boyd. But Greg Lane tipped the ball and Burris grabbed it. 
The Eagles averted the shutout on a four yard TD pass to tight-end Pete Mitchell with 
1:46 remaining. Greg Grice caught a 48-yard bomb two plays earlier to set up the score. 
"Boston College is a good team, and you really can't eval­uate them based on today's performance," said Holtz, who lead a team possessed. "Everything went our way, and we were just emotionally ready to play football today." 
McDonald concurred. "Emotion was the key today. Some days you just do every­thing right on defense. All of the hype of playing against Boston College just added fuel to our fire." 
Even the characteristically pessimistic Holtz could find no faults in his team's perfor­mance. "I was really disap­pointed in our punt returns," cracked Holtz as he entered the press conference. 
Holtz then took a more seri­ous tone, boasting, "This is one of the few times I can come up here and say that our team was outstanding in a number of ar­eas." 
Notre Dame's most epic per­formance since winning the Sugar Bowl last January thrust the Irish back into national championship consideration. 
Still, they remained a not-so epic eighth in the polls.

Breech's last-second field goal continues Bear's dreadful season ­
Kicking overtime field goals is old hat to Jim Breech. 
He upped his career record to nine in a row Sunday night when a 36-yarder with 6:21 left in overtime gave Cincinnati Bengals 31-28 victory ov the Chicago Bears. 
Breech's firs overtime field goa also was against Bears, giving the Bengals a 17-14 victory in 1980. 
Coach David Shula had so much confidence in his little kicker that the Bengals went for the win on a third-down play. 
"I would have had him kick on second down but we lost a couple of yards on the previous play," Shula said. 
"They asked me where I wanted the ball and I told them a little to the left," , Breech said later. .. "I was comfortable =;:= ...· ::,,::: :~:d.~ hit it real 
The Bengals (4­
5) had tied the 
game with 59 seconds left in regulation on Boomer Esiason's third touchdown pass, a 23-yarder to Carl Pickens. That Cincinnati made it into overtime was due as much to the height as to the hands of the 6-foot-2 Pickens, who outleaped 5-9 defensive back Lemuel Stinson in the end zone. 

"I was supposed to be on the right side," Pickens said. "But coach Shula told me to go to the left if I had Stinson one-on-one. There was no doubt that I could make the big play." 
Bills 28, Steelers 20 

Thurman Thomas carried a career-high 37 times and ran for 155 yards and Jim Kelly threw three touchdown passes as Buffalo (7-2) remained tied with Miami for first place in the AFC East. The Bills and Dolphins play each other next

Injury ends Taylor's final year prematurely 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -Lawrence Taylor's stel­lar career with the New York Giants appears over. 
The perennial All-Pro linebacker and NFL career leader in sacks completely rup­tured his right Achilles' tendon in the third quarter of Sunday's 27-7 victory over the Green Bay Packers. The recovery period for such an injury is about four months. 
Taylor announced earlier this year that he was retiring at the end of the season. He left Giants Stadium before the end of the game wearing a cast. 
"It was a complete tear," team physician Dr. Russell Warren said. "We'll perform the surgery early this week. 
"I would expect a full recov­Monday night. James Lofton caught two of Kelly's TD passes and offensive lineman Mitch Frerotte caught his second scoring toss of the season on a tackle-eligible play. The host Bills held Barry Foster, the AFC's leading rusher, to 77 yards on 22 carries. Pittsburgh is 6-3 and has five of its last seven games at home. 
Broncos 27, Jets 16 

John Elway threw an SO­yard touchdown pass to rookie Arthur Marshall for the longest regular-season completion of his career, and Denver overcame four turnovers to win. Wymon Henderson returned an interception 46 yards for another score as Denver (6-3) won its eighth straight home game. The Broncos are 18-2-1 against AFC East teams at Mile High Stadium since 1969. The Jets (2-7) trailed 20-16 when they recovered a fumble at midfield in the fourth quarter, but Freeman McNeil fumbled away that chance. 
Dolphins 28, Colts 0 

At Indianapolis, the rematch was a mismatch. Miami (7-2), surprised by Indianapolis (4-5) two weeks earlier, used a pair of touchdown passes by Dan Marino and short TO runs by Mark Higgs and Tony Paige to beat the Colts. "Everything worked," Miami quarterback Dan Marino said. "We had a solid day offensively, and we needed it, because we had been struggling a little bit the last two weeks." The win snapped a two-game losing streak for the Dolphins. 
Chiefs 16, Chargers 14 

Nick Lowery kicked a 36­yard field goal with 54 seconds remaining and Kansas City (5-4) stopped San Diego's four-game winning streak. Lowery's third field goal of the game was the 300th of his career. Chargers quarterback Stan Humphries, sacked four times in the first 
jury. It shouldn't be the reason he does not come back." 
Taylor was carted off the field with 1:14 left in the third quarter. He blocked a pass by Green Bay's Brett Favre and did not get off the turf. Players gathered around Taylor, then he was taken away, to chants of "LT" from the crowd. 
"He was in a lot of pain," de­fensive lineman Leonard Mar­shall said. "He was screaming and complaining and worried about his leg." 
Taylor, playing his 12th sea­

son with the Giants, had two 
tackles, two assists, one sack 
and blocked two passes against 
Green Bay. 
Taylor was an All-Pro for his 

first 10 seasons in the NFL. He 
did not make the team last year 
for the first time in his career. 
"She's got a ay about her."

Injury sidelines Colt's Emtman 

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -Indi­anapolis defensive end Steve Emtman, the first player taken in the NFL draft last spring, went out with a sprained left knee Sunday in the Colts' 28-0 loss to the Miami Dolphins. 
Emtman was injured late in the first quarter and taken on a cart to the Colts' locker room. Later he returned to the sideline on crutches. 
"Emtman has a sprained knee. They'll take an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and we'll know more," coach Ted Marchibroda said. 
The test was to be taken Sunday. It was uncertain when the results would be known. 
The 6-foot-4, 290-pound Emtman had made one tackle and assisted on one tackle be­fore the injury. 
"It's very sore right now," he said. "I don't really know much." 
Two weeks ago, Emtman was the AFC's defensive player of the week in the Colts' 31-20 victory over Miami. 
half by Derrick Thomas, directed two second-half touchdown drives as the visiting Chargers (4-5) erased a 13-0 deficit. 
Browns 24, Oilers 14 

At Houston, Cleveland rebounded from a loss last week and improved to 5-4. The game was highlighted by a 73­yard fumble return by Stevon Moore and two touchdown passes by Mike Tomczak. "We've been told we're so bad, we've started believing it," Houston coach Jack Pardee said. "We can't do that. Everything they've heard is how bad they were, I think we've bought into it." The Oilers, who have lost two in a row to AFC Central foes, are also 5-4. 
Giants coach Ray Handley said Taylor "was disappointed he won't be able to play golf on Tuesday." 
"I lost sight of Lawrence (on the play). It looked like he was in traffic and I don't know if anybody fell on him. 
"He was in a lot of pain. Ini­tially, I heard when Carl (Banks) came off the field, he mentioned what he thought the injury was, or what Lawrence diagnosed himself." 
Dr. Warren said it was the first time in the last 10 years that a Giants player had suf­fered a torn Achilles' tendon. He added that the artificial turf had nothing to do with the in­jury. 
Former Giants coach Bill Par­cells, now an announcer on NBC-TV, said "in deference to all the great players I have coached, I would have to say that Lawrence Taylor is the greatest player I ever coached." 
"I'm saddened that Lawrence has to end his career on a golf cart going out of Giants Stadium," Parcells said.

JENNY MARTEN 
On Top of Sports 
Apologies needed after unmerited prediction 
I stand corrected. 
I would like to apologize to any member of the Notre Dame community who was offended by my comments in this column in Friday's paper. 
I am sorry if my prediction caused you excess grief, but please understand that I am not apologizing for what I said. I made that comment based on the knowledge I had on the two teams as a sports writer. 
On paper, the Notre Dame and Boston College football teams matched up very well. The offenses were both capable of scoring a large number of points and the defenses were both capable of stopping a scoring drive. 
I saw the emotional aspect of this game as the decisive one. The B.C. team just seemed more emotional about the game, and hence I thought the final score would be very close, and that the winner would be the team that made less mistakes. I, like many people, did not expect the lopsided 54­7 victory. 
Since that column ran in the paper, friends have accused me as being unloyal to the team. What they and most people don't understand is that Jenny Marten, average Notre Dame student, has different views than Jenny Marten, Observer sports writer. 
Notre Dame is my school. When I got up on Saturday morning, I went to the game to root for the Irish. Some would (and did) call me hypocritical, but, sitting in section 31 of the student section, I was not a sports writer. 
A sports writer must be objective. If I wanted to, it would be very easy to write only pro-Notre Dame fluff about the football team and any other team here, but my columns would be incredibly one-sided. Plus, I like to rile people up a bit. 
I like and respect all the guys on the football team that I have encountered in my work for the Observer as athletes and as ~eople, but I can't praise them all the time . 
It is necessary to prevent overlap in my columns between sports writer and student. My column on Friday was a personal column and I erred when I allowed my cynical views as a sports writer to enter the column in the last paragraph. I apologize because it was a poorly written column in that respect. 
I would like to congratulate the Irish football team on an excellent game. All components of the team, offense, defense and special teams, turned in top-notch performances and that is why we won. The Boston College had an all-around bad day and that is why they lost. 
What the two teams proved is that sports writers can predict, prognosticate and analyze forever, but they really won't know the outcome until the game is over.

Notre Dame humiliates BC, 54-7 
By JIM VOGL Assistant Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame football team scored touchdowns on their first four possessions against Boston College on Saturday en route to a lopsided 54-7 victory at home on Saturday afternoon. 
All week, experts had been tabbing the game as an epic matchup, the eighth­ranked Irish (7-1-1) versus the number­

nine Eagles (7 -0-1), running backs Reggie Brooks and Jerome Bettis versus Chuckie Dukes, quarterback Rick Mirer versus Glenn Foley, and coach Lou Holtz versus Tom Coughlin. 
Yet on gameday, it turned into an epic mismatch. 
"All the credit goes to Notre Dame," conceded Coughlin. "The game was won and lost in the first half. They did what they wanted, and whatever we did was not effective." 
An inspired Irish defense took the field on the first play of scrimmage and dictated the flow of the game. BC managed only eleven total yards and two first downs in the first half. 
"Our main concern was to stop the run, and we pretty much accomplished that," said Holtz, whose defense held the BC rushing attack to under 100 yards. Dukes, the nation's eighth leading rusher (120 yards per game), gained only 74 yards on 17 carries, while the rest of the 
Eagles  backfield  managed only  25  
Reggie Brooks runs for one of his two touchdowns. Brooks became the first Notre Dame

Irish remain optimistic after winless weekend 

By DOMINIC AMOROSA Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame hockey team failed to gain its first victory of the season this weekend at Miami University, OH. The Red skins ( 4-0 in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, 5-1 overall), ranked number 10 in the nation, was the third top-ten team the Irish have played this season. 
On Friday night, the Irish lost 6-4; and on Saturday the final score was 6-3. Although they lost, Irish coach Ric Shafer said, "I'm disappointed in the outcome, but I cannot fault the effort of our team." 
In Friday night's game, Notre Dame

Ling 2:55 into the game. 
Miami bounced back with two power play goals. Sophomore Matt Oates scored his fourth goal of the season and senior Brian Savage netted his fifth of the year. 
The Irish tied the score on Sterling Black's first goal of the season. Black, a senior right wing, scored from in front of the net on an assist from sophomore Brent Lampp a with 11:43 remaining in the first period. 
The score remained tied until 1:44 into the second stanza. Miami senior defenseman Joe Cook scored an unas­sisted goal, which started a three goal outburst for the Redskins. Cook's goal 
was followed by an unassisted Justin Krall score and a power play goal by Andrew Backen.

Dave Bankoske by Ling s: 12 into the third period. Miami increased the margin to 6-3 at 
8:28 on a goal by senior Chris Bergeron. The Irish closed the scoring with 1:16 left on a power play goal by Ling, who was assisted by senior Curtis Janicke. 
Shafer praised the play of Ling, who had two assists and a goal to increase his team leading point total to 11 (4 goals, 7 assists). "We're a young team and still learning," said Shafer. "It's just a matter of time before we win." 
Their quest continued on Saturday, with five freshmen in the starting lineup. Co-captain Dave Bankoske scored his first goal of the season two minutes into the game. Black and freshman Chris Bales assisted Bankoske for the score. 
Miami countered Bankoske's goal with three of their own. Centers Enrico Blasi and Kevyn Adams scored a goal each to close out the first period. Krall then tallied the only goal of the second period and the Irish were staring at a 3-1 deficit entering the final period.
