The St. Mary's Social Com­missionyesterday announced 
a St. Nicholas Bazaar will be held Dec. 8th and 9th in the lobby of LeMans Hall. The bazaar will include the selling and exhibiting of arts and crafts, plants, Christmas gifts and imaginative articles.

Lepsio, a Maryknoll sister, and two Jesuit priests, Patricio Cariola and Ferdinand Salas. 
Rev. William M. Lewers, provincial of the Indiana Province of the Congregation of Holy Cross to which Whelan belongs, said the priest is being kept in solitary confinement and faces possible military trail. 
~'our of those involved, including Whelan, are Chilean citizens and Maroto and the two Jesuits, ac­cording to Lewers, are prominent members of the Chilean clergy close to Santiago's Cardinal Raul Silva Henriquez. Whelan and Devlin and two of the sisters were administrators in St. George's School, which was seized by Gen. Augusto Pincohet 's junta shortly after its September 1973 coup. Both 
Holy Cross priests had continued to work on educational projects in Santiago, one of them under Cariola. In all, there are 18 Holy Cross priests in the country. 
"Apparently no one arrested or sought is accused of sedition," Lewers said. "In effect, they are 
charged with an act of Christian ministry--helping the wounded." 
Lewers said he was working through the United States Catholic Conference, Vatican authorities and the U.S. State Department to secure release of those arrested as well as the safety of those soulo'(ht. 
Theodore Hesburgh, president of Notre Dame, criticized Chile's military government. Hesburgh said this week's actions "reveal a shocking pattern of religious repression which can only further isolate Chile's government from that of any nation respecting 'tiuman freedom and dignity. "I think the state is declaring war on the church." 
It is a real tough thing," Hesburgh continued. "About a half dozen members of the Holy Cross congregation have been thrown out of Chile. We have the best school in Chile--rather we had the best school. The military government has taken control to use it for their own goals." 
Hesburgh spoke of efforts to solve this problem with Chile's military government. "I have talked with the president con­cerning the government's actions with the church. But what can we do? Not much can be done when the government has their guns in their own country." 
Exile at Notre Dame 

Martin Garate, a gradutate st­udent in economics at Notre Dame who was exiled from Chile two years ago, commented on the recent arrest and searches for clergymen. Garate said that

Faculty protected 

Confidentiality assured recommendations 
by Vickie Zimmer 
Starr Reporter 
Notre Dame has taken steps to 
assure the confidentiality of 
faculty recommendations, Dr. 
William Burke, assistant provost, 
announced recently. 
These steps have been taken due 
to the recently passed Buckley 
Amendment that opens all of a 
student's confidential records to 
his inspection. 
As a result of complaints from 
universities across the nation, the 
original law was amended to limit 
the law to records gathered by 
universities after Jan. 1, 1975. 
Parents' Confidential Statements 
of financial status were an ex­
ception; under the amendment 
these continue to be confidential. 
The original measure and the 
amendment of it, both introduced 
by Sen. James Buckley, Cons­
N. Y., prohibit colleges from demanding waivers· in connection with services which are required by the college. The University is, however, requesting waivers for letters of recommendation. 
At nine locations on campus, a stamp reading, "I hereby waive any rights I may have to examine this confidential recom­mendation," will be available to faculty members wishing to use it. The stamp carries a space for the student's name to be printed and for the student's signature. Use of the stamp on the covering sheet of a faculty recommendation will insure that the student subject of the recommendation 1 will not 

Business morali to be discussed 
"lllusions, Delusions and Some 
Hevolutions in Business Morality," 
will be the topic of the final address 
in the St. Mary's Contemporary 
Issues in Business and Economics 
lecture series. 
Dr. Ronald N.M. Horning, chairman and professor of sociology at St. Mary's will present the lecture at 7:30p.m., Tuesday, Nov. 11, in Carroll Hall, located in the Madeleva Memorial Building. 
A member of the Society for the 
Study of Social Problems, Horning 
is also affiliated with the American 
Sociological Association and the 
North Central Sociological 
Association. His research and 
publications have been in the areas 
of blue collar crime, and black 
business and black enterorise. 
Horning received his B.A. 
degree from Kalamazoo College, 
and his M.A. and PH.D. from 
Indiana University. 
The lecture, sponsored by the 
College's Department of Business

Grim and White­Faced Test? 
Dear Editor: 
Dean Roemer's fumbling efforts 
to justify his invasion of the 
privacy of student rooms and his 
interference with freedom of ex­
pression provide perfect 
illustration of the reason why 
Notre Dame administrators can 
not be trusted with discretion in 
ti}ese areas. 
with -that kind of interpretive 
sleight of hand at work, very little, 
if anything, remains of his 
theoretical acknowledgement that 
the University does not have an 
absolute right to enter room. 
In this connection, one wonders by 
what stretch of the imagination the 
standards of our usually absent 
President and those of Mr. Stephan 
can be equated with those of te ND 
community, especially in view of 
the fact that signs of this nature 
have been endemic on ND-USC 
weekends for the past eight years. 
Apparently,no thought at all was 
given to the opinion of the most 
populous element of the com­
munity --the student body. It 
would have been more relevant, 
but obviously less helpful to 
Roemer, to have cited the tests 
utilized by the Supreme Court at 
various times to justify govern­
mental intrusions upon freedom of 
expression. 
To that gallery, which ranges 
from the "bad tendency" test 
through the "gravity of the evil 
discounted by the improbability of 
its occurring" test to Justice 
Holmes' "clear and present 
danger" test, Dean Roemer has 
added a new star: At Notre Dame 
we now have a "does it make 
Hesburgh grim and white-faced" test. 

Even a casual glance at the television listing for any evening of the year gives one the intellectual hives. And the actual viewing of several prime time shows brings on an intense moral indigestion. 
There may be people who actually like the idea of having all sorts of garbage dumped into their living rooms via the "idiot box", but let us hope there are not very many. At least, let us consider both the realities and future possibilities for television programming before we thoughtlessly allow ourselves to become Hollywood's latrine. 
We do not have to be educational television freaks to feel offended at the juvenile ~ubject matter of the current talk shows, situation comedies, variety shows, and social-commentary-while-keeping­them-laughing programs (e.g. All in the Family). It really does not take long to grow weary of the double-meaning one-liners. <Unless of course, one is a big fan of those oh-so-witty placecards hung from the dorm windows all over the south quad on a recent football weekend.) 
Now, there are a number of people who have challenged this recent trend toward 'anything goes' broadcasting. (For example, Anthony LaCamera, the T.V. critic for the Boston Herald­American) Typically the response to any challenge reeks of pseudosophistication. We must accept all this garbage in the name of "realism". The poor naive puritan must open himself up to the real world of perversion and bigotry and rampant immorality. The Hollywood hot-shots have to open up our eyes to the "real world". How can we expect to "mature" without occasionally lapping up all the grossest aspects of human existence? How can we dare to criticize vices until we have viewed them in all their darkest manifestations? 
These are the kinds of questions which presume to ask us why we ever reject evil once we recognize it. Following this ludicrous logic, we find it necessary to wait until our flesh has half rotted off before we go to the doctor. After all, how can we condemn the disease before we really see it fully?!? 
Not since early childhood have most of us needed to rely on only personal experience to teach us what is good and what is bad. The conscientious objector (as opposed to the cowardly draft-dodger) does not feel obligated to experience the evil of war before he refuses to get involved with it. Nor do we need to stomach detailed rape scenes, criminal glorification, and obscene language on the screen to know that rape, crime, and obscenity exist and are bad. 
What about the "realism" in the family programs? Certainly, it is not as disgusting as that advocated by the yellow press film makers. However, it is just as phoney, Unlike the "reality" presented by the networks, the real United States includes people who love their spouses (one spouse for life), want many children, go to church, and work forty hour weeks. And no matter what the 'beautiful peeople' think, these people who have the courage to live decent lives are the glory of this country. Our television heroes have personality, but they are absolutely devoid of character..It is the man of character who leads a life worth viewing. If we have a soft spot for good humor then we should prefer the noble wit of a man of substance to the strictly slap-stick (both verbal and physical) clowning of a foolish jester. The former gives us real comedy, the latter "real" guffaws. 
-The fact is that right now the greatest means ot mass com­munication in this nation is being manipulated by an essentially amoral gang of Hollywood money mongers. Some of us would like to know why we should sell out on our most fundamental human decency. As St. Thomas More says in A Man for All Seasons, "For 
Wales? Why, Richard, it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world ... But for Wales!" All we get are cheap thrills in exchange for our invaluable human dignity. 

Lawrence J. Bradley, J.D., Ph.D. 



Once upon a time, when I was a young child, there was a boy named Christopher in our neighborhood who was adopted by a butterfly. As I remember the creature, he had large, yellow wings tipped in brown. Among butterflies, I don't know if there are male and female of the species, but from the size of ours, he looked as though he could father whole fleets of butterflies, and grand-sire lesser moths as well. He certainly adopted Christopher. Out of all the children playing in the field that July morning, it was Christopher's shoulder he lighted upon. Christopher had the burden and the glory of bearing him through the heat of the day, though any one of us kids would have died with pleasure for the honor of being chosen to have his shoulder used as a sanctuary where butterflies might rest their wings. 
The butterfly came mto Christopher's life in the first hour of our morning playtime, though none of us except Christopher noted his arrival. We just became aware that Christ had dropped out of our little war game matching bat­tleships against the submarines of the Kaiser. He was sitting perfectly-still in a patch of wild flowers, and we couldn't guess what business he might have there among the devil's paint brushes and the (~ueen Anne's lace. 
"Hey, Chris," we yelled, "what the hell's the matter?" In our group, hell, used as a swear word, was as salty as our idiom ever became. 
"Shhh," he said, and then added, "Look." There on his shoulders was the butterfly, seemingly intent upon an errand of resting; he could not have seemed more content if he were napping on chrysan­themums. But he wasn't sleeping, because the great, yellow wings were in motion, as though he might flutter off tobrightercolors than the faded plaid of a boy's shirt. 
"Where did you get him?" 
"Shhh," he said again; then, in a whisper: "I didn't get him anywhere. He just came." 
It was obvious that Chris didn't dare to move lest his uninvited, much wanted guest should be startled into Winging off, t­hus ending Chris's ecstatic experience of being trusted by untamed beauty. We quickly understood the need of gentle movement. Whatwe couldn't understand was why one of us kids should be con­sidered .worthy of a butterfly's faith, t­hough we felt honored by those shy wings that folded themselves into shapes that our hands might make if we were casting sh­adows in a game with the wall. On other mornings, we might have chased those win!ls and captured them in a net. Some child might have taken them home to be

mounted in a frame, though after en­slaving the fragile being that beats upon the sunbeam, he would never feel so in­nocent agian. Birds would never come and sit on our shoulders, unless it were a gray, strutting pigeon gorging itself on pop corn in a city park, but a butterfly had done it. As the day wore on, we began to think that a butterfly loved a boy, and we were sure it had never happened before since the meadows were begun. Our little world that day centered on a miracle, and its name was butterfly. We were reverent with joy over the spectacle 01 w1td beauty making us a gift of its freedom. 
All morning long we watched with 
Christopher as the butterfly drowsed on his sleeve. At first, Chris didn't dare to move, but a seven year old boy must stretch himself sometime, and scratch the places on his legs where the ants have travelled. But even when Christopher stood up, the butterfly hung on his shoulder like 
an epaulette; it was clear he had found a crash pad he wouldn't abandon. We tried to be supportive in all the ways that we could: we brought flowers to the creature, attempting to feed it; and sweet grass to make it feel at home. One lad even offered a wild strawberry he found growing, but when it didn't tempt the butterfly to ap­petite, the lad ate the strawberry himself. None of us knew anything about but­terflies, except that we had one, and we were afraid that some larks who were watching might lure him off. Whatever invitations the breathing, growing things of earth and air offered him, the butterfly strayed with Christopher. He never even quivered when this head-turning moth fluttered by on !:liaphonous oars in silver and black; she could have been the high priestess of the butterfly tribe. There were no signing sounds made, no covert glances exchanged; we could have sworn to that. Hopalong Cassidy clinging to his horse eouldn't have been more inattentive to the school marm from Boston than Christopher's butterfly was to those ballerinas of the meadowland, and they eouldn't have been more inattentive to him. It seems like a silly point to make; but children have lost puppy dogs to a passing pooch. As children not wanting their miracle to end, we were jealous of the natural relationships that make creatures more at home with each other than they are in the company of kids. 
At noontime, Christopher decided he had to risk going home for lunch. We tagged rlong with him, for it was our butterfly too, and we couldn't trust Chris not to grow weary of hosting an insect more wonderful to us than an angel on the head of a pin. It seemed terribly risky to take the butterfly 
into a place as confining as a house, but Chris's mother declined the suggestion that she should feed him. a picnic lunch on the back porch. She took a picture of Chris with the butterfly, and then a picture of all of us with Chris and the butterfly. She said that the butterfly had to leave some time, at least by winter; she wondered if it wasn't feeling sick to its stomach, or suffering from a wrenched wing. We knew the butterfly wasn't sick, and its wing was as healthy as any the meadow has ever seen. Each of us privately thought that Chris's mother's attitude was slightly agnostic. We wondered if she were worthy to have a son that was chosen to be befriended by butterflies. Our mothers would never have suggested that the butterfly was sick, or tired in its muscles; we were sure of that.

Fmally, ~hr1s smother got t~r~d of the colloquy gomg on between the dmmg room and the porch, and she sent us home for our own lunches. So off we ran, shouting the story of boys and butterflies. When we came running back, bringing brothers and sisters with us, Christopher was sitting on the porch, waiting. During that long af­ternoon, we sat with him, showing off the butterfly to people who had justheard the news. 
At nine o'clock in the evening, Chris's dad decided that the boy and the bug had to part. The boy was exhausted, his father said. What the condition of the butterfly was, nobody never really knew. Christopher cried when his father insisted that he take off the shirt to which the lepidopteran had attached itself. It had been a strange, wonderful, and terrible day for Christopher. It is a terrible responsibility to look after a beauty that can elude you by the merest lift of its wing. When that beauty is fragile and unsure of itself, it can break apart before your very eyes. 
Chris's dad said: "We will leave your 
shirt right here on the chair beside your 
bed. First thing in the morning, you can 
look after your pet." In the morning, the 
chair was still there, the shirt was still 
there, the butterfly was still there. But 
sometime in the darkness , its wings had 
stopped fluttering; and that wonderful 
creation, half bird and half flower, had Someone remarked that they were shaped like butterflies. 
Early in 1944, Chris died in England 
while returning from a flight mission over 
Germany. Survivors said that the 
damaged plane, trying to find a meadow to 
land in, had crashed in the darkness. After 
the war, his body was shipped home for 
burial, and I was one of the friends who 
met the train that carried his coffin. It 
seemed like a plain, wooden box which 
couldn't be opened; of course, no one 
really wanted to open it.

On the editorial page today Pat Kearns, in his column, rhapsodizes over the terrible state of modern-day television, and in view of this week's continued disasters <poor viewing, I'm afraid, dominates the "boob-tube" again), the Observer Feature page must condescend to agree with the · editorial page, at least on this point, at least for today. 
Movies 

The movies this week (depending on your taste, or lack of it, of course) are generally cause for this further pessimism. They include <at worst) The New, Original Wonder Woman battling and beating those "nasty Nazis" (tonight at 8 on 28) and Hey, I'm Alive starring Sally Struthers (worse than ever) as a Brooklyn snot stranded for 49 days in the Yukon (a shame, isn't it, that they bother best the films are The Sugarland Express. Stephen 'Jaws" Spielberg's 1974 debut as a directpr. The film's plot concerns the struggle of a couple attempting to regain their child from his foster parents. The only other notable film is. Walking Tall, that box-()ffice bonanza of 1972 about Buford Pusser and his fight, as sheriff, to clean up his small Tennessee town, despite the awesomeness of the task, and repeated attempts on his life. Good flick, but not a great movie. Powerful melodrama. (Sunday at 9:00 on 28)' 
Series and Specials 
The best of the serialized shows· this week are M-A-S-H, in which a man believes he is Christ; The Mary Tyler Moore Show on which, finally, Ted Baxter ties the knot with Georgette; Maude and 

The week in specials includes a Flip Wilson Show, with guests Bob Hope, George Carlin and Ruth Buzzi (9:00 Tuesday on 22) and "The Grand Ole Opry at 50", a ninety-minute special which includes over twenty songs sung by such country-music rnotableSc as Johrtny Cash, Chet Atkins, and Loretta Lynn (8:30 Tuesday on 28). Liza Minnelli will join Mac Davis at 8:00 Thursday on 16. 
PBS's Classic Theater presents Henrik Ibsen's tragi-eomedy The Wild Duck this week, Thursday night, the story of a poor Norwegian family whose complacency is disrupted when an outsider visits them intending to reveal a secret from the mother's past. It has been called, by scholar Rolf Fjelde, "One of the great 
works of the modern theater." There will also be a "Hall of Fame" grieving children wanted to have a but­terf!y's funeral with hymns and homily, but Chris refused. He preferred to put the butterfly away in a box which he kept among his treasures. He promised to show it to us one day, but he never did, he would never speak of the butterfly either, though he must have wondered why it had chosen him as though he were someone very special. 
During World War II, Chris joined the Air Force. When he came home on leave, he was wearing wings of his own, and there were gold leaves of a major's rank that he wore on the shoulders of his uniform.

I  c~~!~et ~~~~~:~~. ~~~:~~~~~·~re~.  

'  
I  Several Notre Dame professors  
reacted yesterday to the changes  
t  in President Ford's Cabinet. Professors Peri Arnold of the  
~ J  Government Department and Michael Wise of the Law School  
l  seemed convinced that the reasons  
I  for Ford's decisions were mainly  
~  political in nature.  
~  
~  Arnold felt that "There was no  
l  one reason" for the change, but the  
political implications were  
~  dominant. Two overriding reasons  
 ,  were cited. First the replacementof Secretary of Defense James  
Schlesinger was termed a move to  
clear the way for Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to move  
forward with detente.  
The second reason was that the  
removal of William Colby as  
Director of the Central Intelligence  
Agency would "kill two birds with  
one stone" according to Arnold.  
Colby's removal would be looked  
upon as a cleaning up of the CIA whom had embarassed the White  
House with claims that their  
orders had come from the White  
House.  
Wise summed up the CIA  
situation saying that Ford wanted  
"to isolate the White House from  
the transgressions of the in­ 
telligence community."  
Colby's removal also would  
enhance the power of Henry  
Kissenger. Colby was hurting  
Kissinger by releasing secret State  
Department information to Senate  
committees, according to Arnold.  
Reactions varied to Vice- 
President Nelson Rockefellers  
notice that he did not want to be  
considered as a vice presidential  
contender in 1976. Prof. Charles  
Rice of the Law School was "very  
surprised" at Rockefeller's action  
and said he will believe it "only  
when Rockefeller is not chosen as a  
vice-presidential candidate."  
Wise and Arnold felt that  
Rockefeller was tired of being left  
out of policy making and saw  
himself becoming a political  
liability. With Rockefeller gone  
Ford hopes to appease the con­ 
servatives running to the support  
of Ronald Reagan.  
Some policy reasons were  
brought up. The main emphaiss  
seemed to be in the area of in­ 
ternational relations.  
Schlesinger's ouster would  
enable Kissenger to operate freely  
in detente without the outcries of  
Sr.hlesinger. This would  
probably hurt Ford within the  
Republican Party because Reagan  
would point out that Ford was  
becoming too liberal, according to  
the professors.  
The significance of the men  
chosen to fill the vacant posts is not  
very great, but there is a wealth of  
potential. vice-presidential can­ 
didates among them. Wise felt  
that the purpose of bringing Elliot  
Richardson into the Cabinet was to  
bring him back onto the American  
political scene.  
The political effect of the  
changes this week will probably be  
an increased in the detente effort  
of Kissenger with the absence of

Staff Report.Pr 
Investigations mto educational testing, toy product safety as well as plans for an off-campus housing manual were discussed at Wed­nesday night's InPIRG meeting. 
The Educational Testing Ser­vice, responsible for most stan­dardized tests such as SAT's, Achievements and LSAT's, is being investigated throughout the nation. 
St. Mary's InPIRG chairperson, Debbie Hale, explained the problem, "Because of the large effect these tests play in people's lives, we feel the complaints are worth looking into." 
Most of the complaints concern test scores arriving late or never being sent. Another frequent complaint is the scoring level difference of 60 points. 
"In many cases a difference 
of 10 points can determine admittance to a school. If the Testing Service considers a 60 point difference nothing, it should be checked," Hale said. 
Notre Dame and St. Mary's are currently working on a joint toy safety survey. InPIRG is using the criteria set by the Consumer Protection Agency to determine the hazardous toys in area stores. The survey will be completed before the Christmas rush. 
InPIRG has to complete the off­campus housing handbook by spring. They are compiling questi­
naires of the most frequently asked questions about off-campus housing. Organizaton members will bring these surveys to 10 percent of apartment residents at Campus View, Turtle Creek and Notre Dame Apartments. 
"If you put the surveys in the mail people tend to forget about them," Hale said. The project needs 10 volunteers to carry the 
door-to-fooP.

Pheromones are chemicals which serve as communicators between organisms of the same species. Pheromones are most commonly thought of as being sex attractants. Over the years more and more evidence has ac­cumulated which points to the possibility of the occurrence of pheromones in humans. 
The possible functions of pheromones in humans would include male-female attraction, male-female bonding during pregnancy and adult male-male dominance. 
Pheromones are near-universal in occurrence in all social mam­mals. This includes the primates which are biologically very similar to man. Humans are known to react to other mammalian pheromones. For example, both men and women are attracted to 
by Chris Hopkins Starr Reporter Beginning next semester the 
Student Union will initiate a renewed film policy concerning the use of films by different organizations. In a memo from Thomas Bursic, Director of the Student Union, he states: "This film policy was adopted last year in an effort to relieve the problem of film saturation. The procedure for selection of clubs eligible for the spring semester will follow the lottery system outlined in the film policy." "The number of film dates available to all groups is reduced in the spring semester due to the high level of activity planned in other areas. No films will be run against the SLF, Mock Con­vention, Hunger 'Conference or Black Culture Week This leaves us with a limited amount of dates overall. The final number of dates that will be set aside for clubs has yet to be determined, but the number of clubs having an op­portunity to show a film will be between 10-20," he said. '_'All clubs wishing to apply for a film must sign a film request form between Nov. 10-14. Forms will be made available Monday morning at the Student Union receptionist desk," stated Bursic. After careful consideration ths Student Union has decided that some regulations of club sponsored filmshowing must be instituted for the 1975-1976 calendar year. The following are considerations which entered into the decision: ll The large number of bogus clubs being formed for the expressed purpose of advancing the personal gain of the club's organizer. 2) The reduced level of profits and high number of organizations encount­ering losses has evidenced the fact

Approximately 70 students are working with the aged in nursing homes, at nutrition sites and in private residences in South Bend in connection with psychology courses in aging, death and dying and personality develooment.

Santos said. "The programs are all in­terrelated and coordinated by my
assistants," Santos explained. Vivian Hayes, a graduate student
and registered nurse, contacts the 
nursing homes, Dave Walters organizes and supervises volun­teers and Dick Hubbard coor­
dinates the Mental Health Outreach Program.
"The program allows us to develop a breed of 
paraprofessional gerontolobists with both academic training and practical experience," Santos said. 
"The size and organization of the program at Notre Dame is very exceptional," he noted. While 
touring universities in New Mexico for the Gerontological Society, Santos found only about 15 percent of the psychology departments had any sort of volunteer or practical component. 
Santos sees an increasing awareness of the problems of elderly at Notre Dame. "Besides the 70 or so volunteers in the psychology program, other campus groups including CILA, CAUSE, Community Services and others are contributing over 100 volunters in this area," he added. 
"I think Notre Dame as a Christian institution has an obligation to be concerned with people who are vulnerable," he declared "A mesure of a society's value is how it treats the aged," Santos stated. He is encouraged by the fact that mental health centers now are mandated by law to provide services for the elderly. "To look at an old person is to confront our own destiny," Kline commented.

The Story Of College Football's Greatest Coach As told By The Men Who Played For Him by John D. McCallum and Paul Castner 
WE REMEMBER ROCKNE is far more than a book only for sports fans. It is for everyone who believes in per­fection and the struggle to reach that goal. Knute Rockne was many men; a fascinating mix of vigorous activity and talents. He was a no-nonsense man with the highest of standards; making every minute of every hour count. 
Rockne has been dead for nearly 45 years, and there have been many books in the past ... so why another book? To share his spirit, ideals, determination and unfor­gettable personality with younger generations not lucky enough to personally witness this legend. And to rekindle the neglec.ted feelings of pride and accomplishment en­joyed from a job well done. 
No other book has been able to capture the intimacy of his spirit quite like WE REMEMBER ROCKNE. And none will ever again be able to relate the behind-the-scene stories and emotion as have the "Men of Rockne." 
This is THE book about the man, his philosophy, prin­ciples and the game he loved. And it's told by the men who knew him best. Get to know him well! II And make l sure ~our children and grandchildren get to know him; ' · men hke Rockne are hard to find! 296 pages, clothbound

Rare books are available for use 

by Phil Cackley 
Starr Reporter 

The Department of Rare Books and Special Collections is a valuable but rarely used source of research materials available to both faculty members and students on the first floor of the Memorial Library. 
The collections offer more than just opportunities for scholarly research. The department has exhibits on a variety of topics utilizing parts of the collection. In 
addition, any person is welcome to browse through the books look at the coin collection, or exa~ine the immense sports and games collection. 
The collection can be broken down into several categories. The first is the manuscript collection. This contains a small number of ancient manuscripts, dating to as early as the second century A.D.; a large number of medieval and renaissance manuscripts including works by Pope Pius II and St.

concluded, could be national policy twenty years from now. George McGovern was more popular on campuses than anywhere else. 
Gallup said that although Americans tend to call themselves "conservative," this seems to apply to more to their personal lifestyles than to their political views. 
In the four decades of Gallup polling, a dramatic increase has been recorded in the proportion of people willing to vote for 
Catholics, Jews, and blacks for president. And only 20 percent of the electorate--an all-time low-­consider themselves members oft­he generally more conservative Hepublican Party. 
President Ford, said Gallup, has not reversed the fortunes of the GOP. "Tile President's support in the minds of the nation has to be described as lacklustre," he said, adding that Ford's frequent political trips may hurt him by destroymg his "nice-guy" image. 
"l<'or a Republican candidate to win." the pollster said, "he must make great inroads among in­dependents and even win the support of some dissident Democrats." Although incumbent presidents are usually reelected, Gallup continued, "History tells us nothing about an appointed president who leads a minority party." 
The Democrats are "off and walking"--no candidate in Gallup's estimation has captured the imagination of electorate. Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D--Minn) leads the available candidates, with Gov. George Wallace <D-Ala) second and at the peak of his popularity. 
Sen Birch Bayh <D-Ind) is gaining support. But Gallup said that "When we add the name of Sen. Edward Kennedy <D-Mass) to the list there is no contest." 
Inflation and unemployement are currently the national issues of most concern, Gallup said. However, crime is the hottest local issue. One-fourth of Americans <one-third in big cities) say they 
are  afraid  to  leave their houses  
after dark.  
Americans  doubt  their  in­ 

stitutions can deal with the problems and are losing con­fidence in their leadership. When Gallup's organization tried to det­ermine who was the nation's most admired living citizen, half of those surveyed could name no one they deeply admired. 
"In case you're interested ," Gallup added, "I would have put Fr. Hesburgh right near the top of my list." 
The Gallup Poll was founded by George Gallup Sr. in 1935. Its results are carried twice weekly in 130 newspapers. It maintains branches in 28 foreign countries. 
The polls are conducted ran­domly; each American is thought to have an equal chance of being among the 1,500 interviewed for each survey. In the last six presidential elections, the poll has come remarkable close to predicting the actual final results.

Caterina da Siena; and a large number of modern manuscripts such as autograph documents and letters. 
A second major collection is of 
rare books. The department has 
approximately 15,000 works 
ranging from books printed in the 
1400's to modern editions. 
Included in this collection are 
editions from such early presses as 
Gutenberg and Koberger. There 
are works from authors including 
St. Thomas Aquinas, Dante, and 
Tetrarch. In addition, there are 
first edition works of Copernicus 
Galileo, and Newton. ' 
The Notre Dame collection is a third category. In it is contained the entire production of printed material by Notre Dame. This includes books, magazines, yearbooks, periodical offprints and other types of materials. 
Other significant collections are the International Sports and Games Research collectian, which contains over 500,000 articles covering practically all sports, both American and Foreign; and the Numismatics collection which has over 100 American Colonial coins, a large number of foreign pieces of currency, medals and decorations. 
There are additional major collections on Descartes, Romance langu_ages and literature, Amencan newspapers, Franklin 
D. Roosevelt, and Dante. The current exhibit is on paleography, and is titled "Selections on the Art and History of Writing." The exhibit traces the development of different alphabets and styles of writing. It includes original examples of clay tablets showing cuneiform, the writing used by the Sujmerians and the Babylonians as early as 2400 B.C. Other pieces on display incude 
codes manuscripts done in Gothic and lettre batarde. In addition

there are Greek papyrus manuscript fragments showing cursive Greek writing; examples of the Carolingolian script; and two manuscripts written in Pali and Tibetan. 
The exhibit will be shown until the end of November, at which time it will be replaced by a Bicentennial display featuring presidential documents, early American imprints, newspapers, and books This exhibit will focus on early American history up to and including the Revolutionary period. 
Anton Masin, head of the department, listed two major problems affecting the depart­ment. The first was external in nature: very few people use the collection, or even seem to know it exists. 
"We're at the service of the student body and the faculty," Mason said. But so few students or faculty use the department that "I don't think they know about us," he commented. 
Masin stressed his department's role as a service bureau, at the disposal of the entire Notre Dame community . "But what good are all the things in our collection if no one knows about them," he said. 
The second major problem was of an internal nature. Masin said the cataloguing of the collection was proc£;e::<Jing at a slow rate. He estim<~ted that at present ap­proximately 50 percent of the entire collection was not listed in the main card catalogue in the library. 
There are temporary cards on file in the department of Special Collections itself, he said, but these have not been placed in the library's files yet. Masin listed cataloguing as the chief organizational goal for the near future.

Tech wishbone to invade ND 
By Tom Kruczek Te Notre Dame defense will run up against its stiffest challenge of the season this Saturday, when the Ramblin' Wrecks of Georgia Tech come to South Bend to wage war. The Wrecks, under the guidance of Pepper Rodgers are leading the nation in offensive rushing with an average of 376.4 yards per game, running predominantly out of the wishbone. The Irish on the other hand will make an attempt to put together an offense--any kind of offense. Against Navy, the defense did what the offense is supposed to do, put points on the board. The defense accounted for 2 touchdowns while setting up 2 more of the 31 total points against Navy last week, while spending a majority of the game on the field. Clearly this week will have to be a turnaround for the ·lackadaisical offense, they aren't picking the best week to do it. Georgia Tech has held its op­ponents to 138 yards per game rushing averageand hasn't allowed a touchdown in the past two games. . .Add their offense and

going to sophomore Jeff Weston who was named UPI lineman of the week after being credited with 22 tackles an intercepting a pass off fake punt and rambling 53 yards for a touchdown. 
"Jeff's performance was darn good day's work for any lineman," said Devine. "He had been an offensive tackle part itme in high school, and when he came here we gave him a good deal of individual attention. He did a superb job aginst a tough Navy team, and I'm sure you'll be hearing a lot more from Jeff in the next two years." 
The linebackers are nearly all well, with Jim Stock, Doug Becker and Bob Golic strating. Steve Heimkrieter is also healed and will be ready to fill in when needed. 
The secondary spots will be filled by Luther Bradely, adn Tom Lopinski at corner backs with Mike Banks and Randy Harrison at the safeties. 
The Irish offense is not so healt­hy, however. The number one in­jury is to starting quarterback Joe Montana. Montana injured his hand last week in practice and reinjured it early in the first quarter against the Midshipman. In all probability it looks like he will be out for a minimum of two weeks due to bone chips in his index finger of his throwing hand. 
Filling in for Montana will be Rick Slager. Slager on the season, hasthrown69 passes, completing 33 for a .478 completion percentage and 360 yards. He has also thrown 3 interceptions. Slager will be backed up by Frank Allocco and Gary Forystek. 
The rest of the offense remains the same, with the exception that guard AI Wujciak is listed as a doubtful starter due to injury and may be replaced by Mike Carney. Also Jerome Heavens or Jim Browner may start at the fullback spot, with neiter getting the nod as of yet. 
Joe Restic will be the starting punter, and with the injury to Montana the usual back-up punter, Tony Brantly will be ready to play if needed. Pat McLaughlin will handle the kicking-<>ff duties and Dave Reeve will take the field goals and extra points. 
Georgia Tech has an identical record to the Irish 6-2. The dif­ference between the two squads is 
in  offensive  performance,  with  
Tech  clearly  superior  in  that  
respect.  

"Tech runs the wishbone ex­tremely well amd one of the reasons for that is their quart­erback Dnny Myers," Devine~ explained. "He is an excellent option quarterback and he also is a great runner when he keeps the ball. They haven't passed much because of their great rushing game, yet St('ve Raible (tight end) has caught four touchdowns, so t­hey can throw." 
Running in the wishbone will be Pat Moriaty (84 rushes-334 yards) and Bucky Shamburger (46 rushes­268 yards). David Sims (68 rushes­578 yards for 8.5 ave.) and Tony Head (78 rushes-393 yards) were injured several weeks ago and may not see acton this week. 

Things were a little closer than expected in the Big Ten, though declining Michigan State was the only victim of an upset. Ohio State and Michigan both turned in lackluster performances against surprisingly tough Indiana and Minnesota teams. The Buckeyes could only manage a 24-14 victory over the Hoosiers, while the Gophers gave Michigan a good game before bowing 28-21 to the olverines. Michigan State lost its chance for an encouraging season by losing 20-10 to Purdue. 
The Big Eight maintained its status quo, with both Nebraska and Oklahoma remaining unbeaten as they head for their match-up two weeks from tomorrow. Alabama and Florida seem headed for a tie in the SEC, since they do not play each other. The 
Gators have been particularly surprising, moving to 7-1 after last week's drubbing of Auburn. 
The big upset of the day however was out in Berkeley, California, where John McKay's an­nouncement that this would be his last year as 
Southern Cal's coach had the opposite effect than expected. Instead of going out and winning for their departing coach, the Trojans ran out of luck, getting beat 28-14 by a powerful California team. 
Here are this week's Irish Eye picks: Georgia Tech at Notre Dame: Though Tech has the nation's number one rushing offense, the Irish have the defense to stop it. Rick Slager, starting for the 
injured Joe Montana will have to keep the defense off the field at least for a little while, and the Irish secondary must shut off the pass to make Tech's running less effective. It's the last home game for the seniors at Notre Dame, and they have a lot of pride. Irish by 7. 
Alabama at Louisiana State: Even on a Saturday night in Baton Rouge the Tigers are out of luck. This year's State team is not a typical Charley MacLendon team, and even that wasn't enough to 
beat the Bear. Tide by 20. North Carolina State at Penn State: The Nittany Lions ·,;taved off a near upset by pulling out a last­minut(' 15-12 win over .Maryland last week. The Wolfpack can be real good <they've handed Florida their only loss this season) but they're too in­consistent. Penn State by 7. SMll al Texas A9M: The Aggies have a score to settle with the Ponies, hoping to avenge last year's 18-14 defeat. Their excellent defense won.t have too much trouble stopping what has been a less-than­explosive SMU attack. Aggies by 17. Baylor at Texas: Texas is still smarting grom losing their dominance of the SWC and the Cotton Bowl to the Bears last season. Baylor whipped the Longhorns 34-24 and went on to win their first SWC championship in 51 years. They're not about to improve the percentage this year, and Earl Camp­bell and the Longhorns will show them who's boss. 
Texas by 14. Pittsburgh at West Virginia: Tony Dorsett and a potent Pitt offense should score enough to beat the Mountaineers, who somehow managed to beat 
California and Boston College. Assuming their magic isn't at work tomorrow, Pitt will win by 6. 
Kansas at Oklahoma: The Jayhawks may just be the third best team in the Big Eight. That means they might come close. But the Sooners are used to close calls. Oklahoma by 12. 
Arizona at San Diego State: If you dismiss the Western Athletic Conference as second-rate Arizona is one team that doesn't quite fit. They're at least good enough to play in the Big Ten (they creamed Northwestern>. They take a 6-1 reeord into this match with the Aztecs, who are a fine team in their own right. True, neigher team plays anyone worthwhile (except for Arizona's match with Arizona St>, but it should be a good game. Wildcats 
by 10. . Ohio State at Illinois: Even if lllinois plays like it did t":o weeks ago when it beat Michigan State, and even 1f the Buckeyes play like they did last week when they nipped(?) Indiana, the word 'rout' will still apply to this game. State by 30. Northwestern at Minnesota: GJpher quarterback Tony Dungy leads the Big Ten in total offense and he set the Minnesota record for most TD passes in a season last week. With Ron Kullas, the conference receiving leader, at end, he should get a few more. But Randy Dean, Greg Boykin and Scott Yelvington give the Wildcats a decent threat too, probably enough to edge the Gophers in a game that rivals the Iowa-Wisconsin game as the least significant in the Big Ten this week. Northwestern by 7. Michigan State at Indiana: Well, if the Spartans can lose to Purdue then a loss to the Hoosiers is feasible too. MSU has gone from a legitimate preseason contender to a 1-4 record in the Big Ten. The Hooseirs are coming off baffling 24-14 defeat (but moral victory) at the hands of Ohio State, but it was only baffling because they are the Hoosiers. State has got to save some pride. Spartans by 10. Purdue at Michigan: It was 51-0 last year at Purdue when the clock mercifully saved the Boikermakers from real embarrassment. The home field ad­vantage won't really be a factor then, because the Wolverines won't have time to score much more than that, although Gordon Bell would hwe no trouble doing so. Michigan by 45. Stanford at USC: California made the Irish feel bad last week by showing that a little bit of offense can beat. the Trojans. Stanford! has a really good passmg attack that boasts M1ke Cordova, one of the nation's best passing quarterbacks. But Ricky Bell and the Trojans learned their lesson last wwek, and should put the ball in the end zone enough to trip up .the Cardinals. USC by 10. Upset of the Week: Georgia over Florida. The Gato~s· number one quarterback, Don Gaffney, is out w1th a broken leg, and although Jimmy Fisher filled in admirably aganst Auburn last week, he will be missed. It might be just quat the questionable Bulldog defense needs. With ·QB Matt Robinson leading a strong attack, and with the game being played in no-mans land (Talahassee), Georgia could pull this one out. Last week, 11-4 for .733 per cent. Season 89-27 for .767 per cent.

Many have said that there is no place on earth like Colorado Springs. Located high in the majestic Rocky Mountain region, Colorado Springs, the fastest growing community in America, abounds in halcyon beauty. The air exhibits a remarkable freshnesss, and Coors, the most sought after brew in America, is always in plentiful supply. 
But for Lefty Smith and his young Irish hockey team the tempting lures of Colorado Springs must be put aside. For Notre Dame is in town to playColoradoCollege a club experts think will be so good that they are already rated eighth in the nation by the Vollmerth National College Hockey Poll. That might not seem all that impressive save for the fact that the Tigers have yet to play a game. 
"This is going to be a very competitive weekend," em­phasized Lefty Smith, coach of the 0-2 Irish. "Even though we lost both games at Michigan State last weekend, we played good hockey. This weekend will once again prove a tough test for our hockey club. But our play at Eat Lansing has given us a boost." 
The Irish are going to need quite a boost if they are to come away with a weekend sweep. Thirteen lettermen return from last year's 23-14 Tiger team, a mark good enough for third place in the WCHA. 
"It will be tougher for us this season," admits Colorado College coach Jeff Sauer. Last year we were picked to finish last in the WCHA. After our stong finish, everyone will be looking for us. We won't catch them napping this year." 
Opponents will not need a supply of No-Doz when they face Colordo College. Last year's freshman sensations Jim Warner, jim Kronschnabel and Mike Haedrich 
are oacK tor return appearances. 
Warner paced the squad in scoring 
last season with 30 goals and 55 
points, while Haedrich and Kronschnabel scored 43 and 49 points respectively. 
Senior Jim Mitchell returns to anchor the defense. Mitchell scored 17 goals and 40 points. His experience will be a plus to a young defensive corps. 
"Based on its play last season, Colorado College has to be rated among the league's top four teams," Smith cautioned. "They are an excellent hockey team and have most of their squad back. The 
have fine forwards and the 
defensemen are very good. Then, 
there's Eddie Mio." 
Indeed, Eddie Mio is the om­nipresent backbone of the iger defense. The senior All-American net-minder, who always plays well against the Irish, had a 3.95 goals­against average in 21 games last season. 
Meanwhile, the Irish came away virtually unscathed from their double-dip season baptism last weekend at Mchigan State. Allen Karsnia and Kevin Nugent will not participate in this weekend's festivities. Karsnia suffered a brused shoulder at East Lansing and Nugent is just getting over a bout with mononucleosis. Both are expected to be back skating on Monday. . · 
Notre Dame hopes to get some scoring from the dormant Brian Walsh line. The trio of Walsh, Clark Hamilton and Alex Pirus were expected to carry most of the scoring load for the Irish. But they failed to dent the net last weekend. Second line center Don Fairholm leads the Irish in scoring, with two goals and one assist. 
Both games will be broadcast back to South Bend via the services of WSND and WNDU. Face-off will be at 10:00 p.m. EST both nights.
