Congressmen join protest 
WASHINGTON (UPI) -A diehard throng of up to 1,500 demonstrators led by antiwar congressmen swarmed up to the locked main entrance of the House of Representatives Wednesday demanding an im­mediate U.S. pullout from In­dochina. Police made mass arrests. 
While protesters chanted ob­scenities, sang, laughed and smoked marijuana on the Capitol steps, a youth stripped naked. Rep. Ronald V. Deulums, D. Calif., scuffled with a policeman and a small band of "human flies" peered into Speaker Carl Albert's second floor office from a narrow ledge. 
Police arrested the demon­strators one by one on charges of unlawful assembly on the Capitol ~rounds, and hauled them away m dozens of vehicles ranging from patrol wagons to rented panel trucks.

Letter invites Tracey to Zahm 
Extending best wishes and congratulations to Ann Marie Tracey for her recent victory in the Student Life Council election, the residents of Zahm Hall have invited Miss Tracey to spend "a few days" living in the hall and become acquainted with the hall community, in an open letter dated May 3, 1971. The letter follows: 
Ann Marie Tracey 
The members of the Zahm Hall community would like to extend their congratulations to you on your election tothe SLC last weekend. The change to coeducation involves many growing paics for our two in­stitutions, especially from the administrative viewpoint. Your election to the SLC on Friday is in the spirit of uniting the two schools in as short a time as possible. We are confident in your abilities to represent the interests of all students while serving on the board. However, the con­troversy stirred by your can­didacy may have prevented you from campaigning as much as you desired. Zahm Hall would like at this time to extend an

protests in the capital coincided with supporting demonstrations in other major cities across the country, including New York, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Kent State where four students were killed in a protest a year ago. 
At the University of Maryland 10 miles away from the Capitol in suburban College Park, state police moved in under orders of Gov. Marvin Mandel to clear nearly 1,000 demonstrators blocking busy U.S. Route 1 ad­jacent to the campus. Mandel also put 1,200 National Guard­smen on standby alert. 
Tear gas was finally used at the Maryland campus, and police fired about 20 canisters to disperse an unruly crowd of nearly 5,000 college and high school students at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.

NEW YORK (UPI) 
-One rally was moved to save newly seeded grass, another ended prematurely with a bandshell takeover and a suburban savings and loan association found itself the target of a "bank run." 
In all, thousands of New Yorkers, most of them young, marked the anniversary Wed­nesday of the shootings of Kent State and Jackson State Universities with antiwar protests of a variety of sorts. Most were peaceful. 
The largest began late in the afternoon, when some 5,000 persons assembled on a one block stretch of 4oth Street in midtown Manhattan that was banned to traffic. The rally originally was scheduled to be held in nearby Bryant Park, scene of a number of antiwar rallies in recent years, but city officials moved it to the street at the last minute to save 

SU plans 'Festival of Lzfe' at SMC 
The Student Union Social Commission has announced plans for a "Festival of Life" to be held tomorrow and Saturday on the West Campus <SMC). 
The activities will begin at 4:30 Friday, outside Madel eva Hall with "music till dark." Mter dark, four hours of movies will be shown. 
At noon Saturday, there will be music by several different groups. An art and photo gallery is to be set up near LeMans Hall and a water balloon fight is planned for the Saint Mary's tennis courts. 
The purpose of the festival is to provide students will free, out-the newly seeded park grass. 
Earlier, about 1,500 persons, most of them high school students, grouped for a rally at the Central Park bandshell. But that gathering ended prematurely when a group of some two dozen black high school 

students mounted the stage wrestled briefly with rally 
organizers for their bullhorns and began shouting black power slogans. 
Although a few fistfights erupted, there were no known injuries or arrests. In suburban

door social events so that they can enjoy themselves while getting away from dating situations. 
The security department has asked that there be no drinking during any of the event. The Social Commission urged that the students comply with this request so that the program could be continued in the future. 
Any student musician in­terested in participating in the concerts should contact the Student Union Social Com­mission, to make arrangements. In the event of bad weather the "Festival of Life" will be held indoors. 
and raised clenched fists while senators below them debated police tactics in handling street confrontations. 

But outside, on'the House side of the Capitol, hundreds of helmeted policemen began arrests a scant half hour after the demonstrators swarmed onto the Capitol grounds and up the east front steps of the House, led by Dellums and Rep. Bella Abzug, D.-N.Y. 
Police began dragging the protesters down the steps even as Mrs. Abzug, one of four antiwar legislators to address the cheering crowd, was saying that it was a "very wonderful moment to see the police and the people demonstrating here together." A few moments later, she was calling the arrests "an outrage." 
Speaker Albert emerged from the building an hour after the arrests began and shook hands with some of the demonstrators on the sidewalk. He told newsmen he had authorized the arrests. 
"Trying to tame the Republic" or "How to get through the year without hating Yourself" will be the topic of a lecture tonight night by James A. Goode. The talk will be held in the library auditorium at 8:00.

New hall key policy outlined 
A five-point plan to "bolster the security" in the halls through a new room key distribution policy was revealed yesterday by Ombudsman Paul Dziedzic. He added that the Office of Student Residences, along with his office, urges hall rectors and presidents to comply with the following guidelines: 
Only one mailbox and one key should be made for each student resident of a dormitory. 
A five dollar deposit should be required when a student picks up his key in the fall. 
A record of the deposit will be kept and the five collars will be refunded at the year's end. 
Should a key be lost, the deposit will pay for a new lock on a door 
Glee Club concert to support tour 
The Notre Dame Glee Club, in the final stages of its fund-raising drive, will present a European Tour Benefit Concert Sunday, May 9, at 8 p.m. in Washington Hall. Student tickets are priced at $1, adults $2. 
The benefit concert will culminate a ten-year effort to make a tour of Europe. The tour will last three weeks with wtops scheduled in Amsterdam, Brussels, Munich, Vienna, Inn­sbruck, Venice, Rome, Milan, Zurich, and Paris. 
Several formal and informal 
concerts have been scheduled in 
many of the cities. In addition, 
the club will appear on Italian 
national television, tape a half­
hour show on Belgium national 
T.V., and is scheduled to sing in 
the world-famous Vienna Music 
Festival. 

The European tour will climax 
a year of extensive travel for the 
Glee Club. They have performed 
in various cities from Boston to 
Los Angeles. 

The club returned last month 
from the largest tour in its 
history, a western swing through

or mailbox. New keys should be issued to anyone else using the lock. The person who lost the key will be required to pay another five dollar deposit for the new key. 
Accumulated deposits may be placed in the hall treasury or in time passport certificates at the discretion of the hall.

Give US Back the Rock 
Some day, when all the leaves have fallen from the Indiana trees and they stand shivering naked against the harsh Indiana winds, some Notre Dame Freshman, battered by the combined forces of man and nature, baffled by the Freshman Year's ever-constant demand for academic excellence, cut to the quick in his quest for a meaningful relationship with one of the coy maidens at St. Mary's, or set back by any of the preceeding will come to LaFortune Student Center in search of the man who led the ta-dah Fighting Irish to undefeated season after undefeated season and got a ta-dah gym named after himself. And he'll find nothing. Somebody stole LaFortune's eight-by-ten photographs of the Rock. 
Oh, he may find a few things. He may find Tom Dooley, but that's not the same. After all, how many undefeated seasons can you have in Southeast Asia? Or he may find a brand new photograph of Father Burtchaell. That may inspire him to buy a new set of suspenders, but precious little else. There's a photo of Father Hesburgh in there, which may move him to see the world, but as much of an institution as Fr. H. is, he still ain't the Rock. 
The Rock was our one link with the past, and, by virtue of his per­
manence, our one link with the future. Long after Dave Krashna, John 
Barkett, and, lo, even Don Mooney fade into obscurity, the Rock will be 
here. But now his pictures are gone. Hell, we still have pictures of Pat 
Dowd at the Observer office! 
The Observer, then, recommends that the Rock's pictures be returned for the following reasons: 
1.) If they aren't then everyone will forget what he looked like. Fresh­
men might take his nickname literally, and really believe him to be a 
mineral composite. With only that bust in the Rockne Building to go on, 
that conclusion would be entirely justified. 
2.) If they aren't, people will stop believing that the Rock really 
coached here. They will combine their knowledge of his reputation with 
the reputation of a ND sports department slick enough to convince 
people that a certain well-known iquarterback of a couple years previous 
had an IQ in double figures, and logically conclude that the Rock never 
stepped foot on this campus, much less coached here. 
3.) Finally, if they aren't, that Freshman of the future, looking for 
solace, comfort, and inspiration, would be forced to look at Burtchaell, 
Hesburgh, and Dooley, and God knows what would happen after staring 
at that troika. 
Give us our Rock back! And on that supplicatory knute, we end this 
plea. 

Fr. Burtchaell IS Called 
For those of you who missed it WSND last night featuredl the profound depths and at least half the subtle wit of University Provost (that's Prah-vist) James Tungstead Burtchaell. During the course of his in­tellectual discussion with L. Franklin Devine and others Fr. Burtchaell, (or, "his holiness-to-be" as he's known to his friends), was heard to comment that he would raze the fieldhouse if it had the Observer staff in it. 
We feel that it should take more than a Fr. Burtchaell Dictum to demolish the fieldhouse. Accordingly, we propose a contest. A member of our staff is the six-and-under arm wrestling champion of Roosevelt, Arizona. He will meet Fr. Burtchaell in an affair of honor in front of the fieldhouse at twelve midnight, Friday, May 7th, 1971. The loser of the arm wrestling match will be forced to enter the fieldhouse while the winner gets to demolish it about his ears. 
Fr. Burtchaell, we're calling you. out!

Fr. Raymond Runde===== 
Isolation on the Prairi~ 
Some months ago Cardinal Suenens told a Parisian interviewer that 
the Church should settle the question of celibacy and get beyond to the 
major problems of Church reform. The Cardinal said that the idea of 
celibacy is a minor concern in comparison to the concept of what the 
priesthood itself should be. Frequently enough, the same situation 
occurs over and over again where the accidental is allowed to 
supercede the essential. "A genius for the periphery" is the curse of 
the dilettante, and apathy is the disease of the self satisfied. In both 
cases the prospect of being on the cutting edge of substantial reform is 
blunted by misdirected emphasis, or by no activity at all. 
I think there is an analogous situation in our academic community of 
Notre Dame University and St. Mary's College. In the three years that 
I have been teaching here the major educational reform that has taken 
place is coeducation. Such a change is hardly a sign of being in the 
vanguard of creative experiences, especially since coeducation really 
is an accidental aspect to the total concept of education in itself. While 
I believe that a coeducational environment is much healthier for 
students, I don't think anyone holds it to be essential before learning 
can take place. Also since the announcement of the merger and thus 
the impending coeducational situation, the academic community here 
seems to have lapsed into a state of lethargy that reeks of apathy. 
While the dilettante is understandable as one who is generally young and inexperienced, the smugness of the self satisfied is much more difficult to digest. Why we feel that all is well in our academic situation is really incomprehensible. One doesn't have to ponder for long what exists here and what is possible in higher education, to realize that soon we could be inhaling the dust of the reformers. Sometimes I wonder if the "isolation of the prairie" hasn't brought about a great degree of stagnation, for anyone who would state that there is a dynamic academic milieu at ND-SMC hardly has his finger on the pulse. 
Before essential change in the educational process can take place tho.ugh, there has to exist a structure that is capable of bearing the weight of such reform. The present centralized model based on American corporations has left us with much to be desired. This system has taken us to our present place in time but leaves little doubt that it is inadequate for the future. Such an organization has taken away decision making and a sense of responsibility from those who need it most, deans of schools and heads of departments, and it con~rols programs, appointments, and appropriations generally from an Ivory tower. 
Thus it seems evident that we need a decentralization of the academic bureaucracy, and more freedom and responsibility given to those administrators who are closer to the academic situation. Schools withi~ the university should be given more real license to develop creative programs and have the autonomy to move freely in their spheres by governing their own fiscal affairs. Power is in the hands of the person who controls the money. So no change in the present structure can take place until the schools in the university are given the responsibility of controlling, at least partially, their own finances. This certainly would have to be one of the first steps in any serious reform. 
For a positive direction, I believe that Notre Dame should resurrect the experimental college concept and give it sufficient fiscal and academic autonomy to be able to succeed. The experimental college concept should not become stereotyped and formalized but remain open and free with enough structure to keep it from developing into a mentality of license to do anything or to do nothing. The University should allow variations of the program to arise naturally in time, and encourage creativity from faculty and students alike. But we do have serious problems in the development of such a change, for we cannot expect an academic community to find the seeds of such a sweeping change within itself. They can make some minor changes in areas but no overall structural reformation is possible without outside help. Talented persons from without have to be brought into the University, and they have to be given the power to reform even against the long guarded concerns of those high in the organization. 
It seems quite apparent though that the present structure of Notre Dame wasn't prepared for the experimental college and thus it remains only a dream. 
So I suggest that Notre Dame hire a team whose task would be to organize the transformation of the University, in order to allow the greatest amount of academic excellence to ensue. What is needed are some young Dr. George Shusters. Such men will need creative vision and an enthusiastic vitality for the job certainly won't be easy. The reformers will need total backing from the powere that be, and they will have to remain insensitive to the verbal blasts which will definitely come from some in the academic community itself. 
For Notre Dame to continue on its present ocurse seems an un­fortuante circumstance. For St. Mary's College to enter at this junc­ture into the University's structure without substantial change taking place seems even more unfortunate. Merger under these conditions just increases the number of students who will getting a rather mediocre education. What is sad is to be unable to discern any movement toward real reform. Most appear satisfied. While it seems very true that St. ~ary's College had no future alone, it causes no joy to bury the dead without much hope that a reincarnation will bring a higher form of life. 
To ape the minor reforms of other universities only after they have proven somewhat successful is not the way develop an academic yi!~lity. Still to~ay, private institutions have a great opportunity to 1mtiate change smce they are free to develop different responses to the dynamics of man. To do this involves risk, a high degree of un­certainty at times, and the possibility of failure. Only to taking such chances though will Notre Dame inch forward to the cutting edge of leadership in higher education.

THE OBSERVER. 

rev. robert griffin 

a gleam of light 
Springtime, '71, has been the season of secular Lents. In an age when the Church has mitigated the discipline of fasts that fed that fishmonger's daughter, and almsgiving has become principally a matter of deductions between a man a'nd his tax­collector, students have vowed hunger as a protest to napalm and renounced their discophilia as a thrifty means of raising money for the purchase of balms in Gilead for a suffering Asian village. They mourn the death of Messiah fallen in Memphis and the slaughter of the innocents on the greens of Kent State. They follow a Via Dolorosa that leads them not to Calvary or an empty tomb, but to en­campments at the seats of power. On the lawns of Washington, they protest the alliance of Herod with Pilate; on the steps of the Pentagon, they turn their anger against Annas and Caiphas, plotting together as conspirators in the palace of the high priest. 
In the early hours of a recent Saturday, reports came in from the night marauders of a group of munchkins huddled under blankets on the steps of the Administration building; it was snowing a bit, and the air was icy with the night winds of March; but still the munchkins waited for the coming of Sunday evening, when their hunger strike would end. Only old gluttons know how touching this form of war-protest really is; but in the end, I fear, it did not affect anything. Only if, like Gandhi, they were prepared to fast until death, it seems to me, could their self-punitive suffering make the slightest dent in the moral composure of the military-industrial complex. 
The difficulty with our secular Lents is that they involve a postponement of Easter. The passiontide of the world began with its birth. Vietnam-for all of its wounding of the contemporary Christian con­science-is only a single gasp of pain in the agony of the generations that have been nailed to a cross of fire in all the wars of history. Every date on the calendar of time is encircled with the blood of victims who bear the marks of a crown of thorns. 
But the energies of living men must not be spent in counting the bodies of the unjustly dead. 
At Easter this year, at the Mass for the moppets in Urchinsville, each child was given a plant to take home and care for: it was the gift of a green and living thing in celebration of the Feast of Life. 
Vietnam is all of the obscene crimes its critics have called it: organized murder, genocide, capitalistic exploitation, atrocity of the first dimension. I reverence on my knees all the efforts of the gentle people who commit themselves to ending the horror. But as a Christian priest, I beg that their peace movements not be those of penitents who starve themselves in the darkness, but as children who care for green and living things to celebrate the Feast of Life. 
War is the ultimate denial of the sanctity of human life. Ideally as a way of affirming the

If a hundred thousand students would observe May 5th as a day spent in the symbolic act of planting trees in the plundered forest of America, then the peace movement could be seen as reflec­tive of the creative mood of the children of beauty. If a thousand students at Notre Dame could plant a garden on the quads-a place where lovers could walk, and dreamers have visions-it could endure forever as a sacrament of peace: the external sign of the internal grace of a generation's decision to work, in the midst of war, as the sons and daughters of the Father of Life. 
A peace garden on the quads ...in this Ave atqu.e Vale of my scribblings in the Observer this year, this frivolous nothing represents my hope for the direction in which the energies of the peace-makers might go: not to Washington; not to rallies in Stepan Center; not to futile, somewhat doubtful, acts of civil disobedience ... but to the work of caring for green, living things that affirm that Easter is as eternally present in human affairs as the outrages against innocence that seem, like the life of God Himself, to occupy an eternal now. 
A final thought: the question is onen asked of Notre Dame: is it Catholic? Is it Christian? by which is meant: do the students go to Mass? The question itself represents a topsy-turvy view of hierarchical function. Notre Dame can be Christian only if it has a true moral vision of what a Christian university should be: a witness to itself and to the world community of the implications of truth as revealed in the Incarnation of the Son of Man. 
If being Christian adds a dimension of insight to the function of being a university, it is to be hoped that our leaders can define the goals of Notre Dame facing a post-ghetto world where science, operating without ethics, is manipulating more and more the forces of life; for a heaven created on earth by science could end by being more terrifying then the extra-terrestrial hell as conceived by theologians. 
In the meantime, to the least of all the children in the Kingdom, a gleam of light is given ... maybe, if the gleams given to all of us are collected, they will coalesce into a vision of what Notre Dame should be. 
Wounds are not healed by protest; service to suffering is not rendered by rhetoric. Maybe peace can begin only when a generation of students called to bayonets declares an armistice to plant roses in an earth that is in need of gardens. 
Peace! If you are in the neighborhood of St. Malachy's, W. 49th Street, two blocks north of Times Square, during July and August, drop in for Sermonette. And remember: Darby and I never said we didn't love you. 


man's greatest fault 
On completion of my daily chore, Reading the events of the day before, I laid the newsprint on the shelf to rest To ponder the world beyond my nest. 
I thought of mankind's greatest fault, Of his inability of hate to halt Before it grew and grew so great That destruction of the world would be his fate. 
I wondered why men were so full of hate, 
Like impulsive fisherman, hungry fish and bate. I wondered why men could not live in peaceAnd learn how their happiness this would increase. 
Then I thought of mighty Niagra, Roaring as it rushed toward the sea. The sea itself · Breaking and brushing against the shore. The shore, windswept, Slanting upward as far as the eye could see. 
I thought of the majestic Rockies Pointing heavenward ­And of the Grand Canyon floor ­Of the flatland plains, the crystal lakes, the sun-dried deserts ­The tempests, the quakes ­And all that lies in nature's creative wake. 
I thought of how I had felt upon beholding these-nature's monuments! So small, so lost, so insignificant, So much in need of anothzr humane's sentiments\ Yet I did not feel the need for power, money or fame, Or any of those trivial things that drive men so insane. 
Then I thought, if everyman could so feel. The world surely would be healed. Then what need of war, of prejudice, of hate; Of impulsive fisherman, hungry fish and bate!

Dear Brian: 

:sorry that I haven't written in such a long while especially in light of your faithful and very in­teresting correspondence. 
I'm just getting out of the hospital after having been hosed by the "enemy" (whoever and whatever they are). It's really ironic that they are giving me a Purple Heart Medal for shedding blood for my country when in reality I wouldn't even be proud to shed a mouthful of saliva for the the U.S. 
I got hit over a place called An Hea (the press is calling it the battle of Due Due) which is a mere 17 miles west of Danang. Nixon's Vietnamization program rhymes with castration. As we pull out more and more of the "enemy" is just taking over the places that we have been fighting over for 6 
 years. 

I was very lucky in my accident. Got all the troops out alive but I caught shrapnel in the neck, chest, and arm. The real clincher is that an AK-47 round went through my survival vest and radio and stopped at the butt of my .38 pistol which was worn over my heart. I'm either an immortal or the luckestt bastard alive. Probably the latter is more correct. What saved me was the "Superman" T­shirt that I wear under my flight suit. 
I have 16 days and a wake-up until my unit with­draws to Okinawa for six months. I hope I get a job like passing out volleyballs so I can devote all of my energies in dealing with the Black Market and organizing a first class whore house. 
I will really be estatic about getting out of here. They blew up part of my orphanage last week and so there is really nothing constructive left for me to do. 
Spring has always been a good time at N.D. hope you're enjoying it. ' 
I almost forgot. Spent my R and R in Sydney Australia. Definitely the best place I've eve; visited. Thinking about going there again for a couple months after I'm paroled or exiled from the military.  
Peace and friendship.

Colombo claims police harassment 
NEW YORK (UPI)-Since 1963 when Joseph Colombo Sr. was accused by federal authorities of heading a Brooklyn crime family, he has lived with what he terms "the nightmare" of being referred to as a Mafioso. 
Colombo said in an interview that the federal government's organized strike force has been "harassing" his family. Colombo himself has been indicted for income tax evasion, conspiracy in a jewel robbery and handed a jail sentence for perjury, which he is appealing. 
Law enforcement officials scoff at this Colombo martyr image and maintain he has engaged in a publicity campaign to dupe the public by establishing a "veneer" of respectability. 
Colombo, 47, not only denies the

charges against him but also accuses the federal government of fabricating "the myth of the Mafia" to harass Italian Americans and of using unfair tactics against him. 

The most recent indictment charges Colombo with running a multimillion dollar gambling operation. Colombo admits to deriving revenue from gambling operations but maintains they are outside the United States where such activities are legal. 
"Now my activities are gambling in London and all these big enterprises," Colombo said. "I don't need anybody to protect me there." 
Before the recent charges were filed against him' Colombo had been arrested about a dozen times. primarily for running crap games. consorting with known criminals, disorderly conduct and vagrancy. But he served only a 30 day sentence on a contempt charge for refusing to answer grand jury questions about mob 

infiltration  into  legitimate  
businesses.  
Until  recently,  Colombo  

greeted charges that he was a powerful Mafia chieftain and member of the Cosa Nostra council with complete silence. 
Then last year, federal crime fighters arrested his son, Joseph 
Jr., on charges of conspiring to melt down silver coins into more valuable ingots. That's when Colombo founded and organized the Italian American Civil Rights League, whose members began picketing FBI headquarters in Manhattan. This form of protest failed to shake the conviction of those who call Colombo the boss of a Cosa Nostra family that profited from loan sharking, labor racketeering and gambling in Brooklyn, England and the Bahamas.

at any time, or exploit him in a 
variety of ways. 
These illegal immigrants aid the U.S. economy by providing cheap labor, Samora pointed out. However, the presence of great numbers of Mexicans depresses wages in the entire border area, creating the displacement of citizens and legal aliens. 
The wetbacks are also used to 
break strikes, most recently in 
efforts of farm laborers to 
organize into a union. Since the 
aliens have no legalrights, they 
cannot be organized themselves. 
Mexico has fostered the wet­back migration by not enforcing laws which prohibit the illegal border crossing, Samora added. Apparently, he explained, Mexico believes the money sent back by the wetbacks is good for the economy. Also, the officials believe that the aliens are at least employed in the U.S., where they would remain jobless in Mexico. 
However, Samora contends, most of the money the wetback earns is spent in the United States. Also, the personal misery and degradation caused by the illegal migration is damaging to a great many Mexican families. 
To discourage the wetback flow, Samora suggests an identification card should be carried by all citizens and legal aliens. Employers hiring anyone unable to produce such a card would be severely prosecuted. This would remove the incentive for employers to hire wetbacks, at the same time removing the mojor incentive--jobs--which causes Mexicans to make the dangerous journey across the border. 
Samora also stressed that 
smugglers who traffic in human 
lives should be prosecuted 
severely. 
Rock~taken 
from LaFortune 
Arthur Pears, director of Notre Dame security, has confirmed the report that several pictures had been stolen from LaFortune Student Center. 
The eight photographs, of football teams coached by Knute Rockne, were removed recently. 
Pears said that the main value of the pictures was the en­tertainment they gave to those that visit the Student Center, and he could not understand the value they would have for any in­dividual. Because of this, Pears hopes that the person responsible will return the photos to LaFortune where everyone will be able to enjoy them .

'This is the place to be'-Phelps 
by Jim Donaldson 

Observer Sports Editor 
In his first year as a college basketball coach, Dick "Digger" Phelps inherited a team that had a 10-15 record and didn't have a starter taller than 6'5" Phelps was able to win 26 of 29 games with that delegation, an ac­complishment that earned him the runner-up spot in the United Press International "Coach of the Year" voting. 
Next season, Phelps will take over the reins of a Fighting Irish basketball squad that has just two returning lettermen, neither of whom started during the past year. The task before him is a difficult one, but "Digger" is anxious to get started. At a press conference yesterday morning in the Monogram room of the ACC he seemed as thrilled with Notre Dame as a freshman the first week in September. 
"I'm very excited about being here," Phelps said. "I just can't believe it. I've always wanted to coach at Notre Dame. I think that this is the place to be." 
"There are great people here," Phelps continued. "Notre Dame has a winning tradition, tremendous facilities, a fine academic atmosphere and what I

Carolina, Phelps remarked that "to be the best you have to play the best". 
"We'll go step by step and take each game one by one. The kids will have to play the best they can," Phelps continued. 
While discussing his coaching philosophy, Phelps commented that he wasn't a "hold the ball coach". "College basketball is a spectator game and it's got to be exciting," he felt. He said that if other teams play a slow-down type of game then, "we'll go out after them early. We can't afford to play into their hands."

admitted. "You know, I came uphere and I was afraid that they'd all be monsters. And during the early part of the freshman season everyone shot out in front of me. But after a while everything started to fall into place and I started to get the feel of things a little better." Freshman coach Denny Murphy must have thought that things fell into place for Pomarico immediately, because Frank started at of­

Many of t~e worlds leadmg amateur tenms players and the ~ation's top collegiate teams will 
mvade Notre Dame for. the 8?th annual NCAA ChampiOnships June 14-19. . 
Notre Dame tenms coach Tom Fall~n ~a.s announced that over 250 IndiVIdual players and 42 teams will participate in the six-day tournament. Notre Dame, NCAA co-champions under Fallon in 1959, will be hosting the event for the first time. 
"We'll have an opportunity in see some of the best amateurs in the world," said Fallon, who indicated the tournament mat­ches will be played on Notre Dame's 24 courts. Ticket prices will be announced at a later date. 
Gene Sullivan, Dee's assistant who had sought the head coaching post,spoke briefly at the conference and wished Phelps and the Irish good luck in the future. 
Phelps let it be known that he signed a 4-year contract with Notre Dame and said that "I hope it turns out to be 40". 
Phelps also revealed how he got his nickname. "My father is an undertaker," he said with a smile. 
I guess if the Irish intend to bury their opponents next year, "Digger" is the man that can do it for them. 
thing." 
Frank Pomarico, despite all his early successes, is aware that his position is anything but secure. 
"It depends," he said, "on how much I work out during the summer. With the kind of players that we've got at Notre Dame, it's a day-by-day challenge to keep your position. You've got to try to look good on every play; you just can't afford to get beat. I'm pretty confident right now that I'll have my position in Sep­tember, but I know it's going to be different in the fall. I'll have to 
go ~ut and prove myself all over agam." Thinking ahead to the up­coming season, Pomarico ven­
tured an opinion that may not be born out until the Irish are well into their '71 schedule. 
"We'll have a great defense, but our offense is kind of young and it could take a few games for us to gell. But if we get through our first three or four games without a loss then we'll be hard to stop." 
Last year's team did just that, and a key factor in their early­season spurt was the per­formance of number 56---guard Larry DiNardo. If next year's team is going to enjoy the same success, it's just possible that much of the responsibility will fall on another number 56---guard Frank Pomarico. 
think is the finest alumni association in the country." 
Notre Dame was not the only school that sought Phelps' ser­vices. He mentioned Minnesota, Utah, Rutgers, Penn and Virginia Tech as schools that had felt him 
out  on  coaching  jobs  but  he  
rejected their offers.  
"One offer,  at least,  was  for  

much more money, but you can't buy happiness , " the 29-year old coach said. 
The first order of business for Phelps will be to wrap up the recruiting of next year's fresh­man ballplayers, begun by ex­coach John Dee and his assistant, "get the most out of the material at hand". 
"If I can build confidence among the kids, there's no limit to what we can accomplish," Phelps said. 
Offensively, Phelps figures to use a style that best suits the ability of his players but on defense, he let it be known that he was strictly a man-to-man ad­vocate. 
When the difficulty of the 1971­'72 schedule was pointed out to him, including the fact that NYU had been replaced by a Madison Square Garden date with North 

however, that he wouldn't at­tempt to recruit any high school prospects who had committed themselves either verbally or in writing to Fordham, nor would he encourage any of his Fordham players to transfer to Notre Dame. 
Phelps was also anxious to contact his new "kids". 
"It's important that the kids believe in themselves," Phelps commented. Knowing that most of next year's Fighting Irish will be inexperienced, Phelps ex­pressed the hope that he could

The 1971 Fighting Irish football team will be the eighth team that Ara Parseghian has produced since coming to Notre Dame, and this team, like no other, promises to be a blend of experience and youth. No one needs to be reminded that the Irish roster for next seasorr will be loaded with names such as Gatewood, Patulski, Creaney, and Ellis, but there will also be some new 

blood, after losing to the netmen by an identical score at the convo earlier this spring. 
They left the ND campus in March complaining that the Irish had an advantage on the indoor courts. 
So this time the raqueteers stuck it to 'em outdoors. 
Coach Fallon singled out Captain Bernie LeSage as the hero of the match as he won a tie­breaker in humber four singles in the final set for his victory. 
And that tie breaking point proved to be the margin of vic­tory. 
Besides LeSage, Allare, Walsh and Schefter all won their singles matches, and the duo of Brown­Allare recorded the only Irish doubles victory, while clinching the win. 
The raqueteers will travel to Kalamazoo for matches with Western Michigan on Friday and Kalamazoo College on Saturday. 
The netters will also host a doubleheader on Sunday when

names on the list. Names like Brown, Hill, Devine, Casper, and Rudnick. 
One of the most promising of these young players is Frank Pomarico, a 6-2, 240 pound of­fensive guard who very likely will be holding down Larry DiNardo's old position when the Irish open against Northwestern in Sep­tember. 
Pomarico, who like DiNardo, came to Notre Dame from St. Francis Prep in Brooklyn, is something of a "born" offensive lineman. 
"I've been playing on the of­fensive line since I was 10 years old," he said. "And I've always played at guard, too, except in high school where I played a little tackle." 
Apparently he did no injustice to the memory of DiNardo at St. Francis for during his last year there Pomarico was a rather heavily wooed prospect. He was approached by the likes of Boston College, Michigan State and· North Carolina, as well as Notre Dame. But according to Pomarico, there was never any choice. 
"I'd wanted to come to Notre 
Dame ever since roy sophomore 
year in high school. Oh, sure, I 
was recruited by other places, 
but I always knew that I'd come 
here if I got the chance. I guess 
I'd have to say that Larry 
<DiNardo) was one of the big 
reasons, too. We talked about the 
school a lot, and he didn't leave 
much doubt in my mind." 
One doubt that did confront 
Frank Pomarico last fall was game last year, and he even went both ways in the season's finale against Michigan. 
The freshman season ended 
some two weeks before the 
Thanksgiving holidays, and as 
soon as Pomarico returned to 
South Bend after that semester 
break he began a weight-training 
program for the '71 season. 
"I made up my mind right 
away that I wasn't going to end up on the prep team again," he said. "All I really wanted to do was be sure that I made the traveling squad, and I decided to work my butt off until I did." That bit of off-season con­ditioning paid off handsomely. For not only did Pomarico achieve his goal of making the · traveling squad, but he also found himself, at the end of his fresh­man year, as the team's first 
string right guard. 
There was an added bonus, too. 
At halftime of last week's Blue­
Gold game, Pomarico was one of 
the fifteen players--and one of six 
freshmen--to receive Hering 
Awards for superior per­
formances during spring prac­
tice. Pomarico's award came for 
being the Outstanding Freshman 
Offensive Lineman. 
"Winning that award was 
something of an inward goal that I set for myself at the beginning of practice," he said, "and I was really glad to get it.. .but I wouldn't have been demoralized if I hadn't. This is something special for me, though, because Larry won the same award his freshman year, and it's an honor .for me to have done the same

Lah calls for Ecology camp volunteers 
Four volunteers are needed to help staff an ecology camp for sixth graders from May 10 to May 14, Community Relations Commissioner Dave Lah an­nounced yesterday. 
The volunteers will "lead nature walks and discussions and act as camp counsellors in general," Lah said. He added that they are looking especially for students knowledgable of forestry, biology, astronomy, geology or camping. They will accept students who can only make it for one or two days. 
The camp, which is only 40 miles from Notre Dame, is funded by Model Cities. There is no pay involved for the volun­teers, but everything is free at the camp. 
Anyone interested should contact Dave Lah at 1535. 

DePaul Society collection Tuesday 
Tuesday, May 11, has been proclaimed "St. Vincent DePaul Society Day" by Student Government and the Hall Presidents Council. 
On that day, section leaders will go from room to room collecting used clothing, shoes, and athletic equipment. Books, furniture, rugs, refrigerators, book cases, lamps, old TV's and radios can be left inside the loading dock door of each hall for pickup by the society early Wednesday morning. 
Collected articles will be sold in the St. Vincent DePaul Store downtown. All money eventually goes to some charitable use. 
Jack Candon is coordinating the drive at SMC, with Dave Lah charge of the Notre Dame 
project.
