Student Union plan for change debated 
By TIMOTHY GIANOTfl 
News Staff 
Student Union Director Dave Drouillard said last night he thinks joni Neal, assistant director of Stu­dent Activities. may be "rushing things too much" with her plan to have a major Student Union reor­ganization proposal ready for a vote in the Student Senate on Monday. 
"There are still a lot ofgrey areas to be cleared up," Drouillard noted after yesterday's me~:ting of the Stu­dent Union Steering Committee. 
Calling the proposal "rough," he said that the committee needed more time to investigate before it could forward the plan to the senate. 
Neal acknowledged "a few dis­crepencies" on some specific issues but remained confident that the Friday meeting ofthe Steering Com­mittee would be the last one needed to finish the proposal. 
The original plan was drafted by Neal after consulting Drouillard, Stu­dent Union Comptroller Bob Bondi, liirector of Student Activities Jim McDonnell and Student Body Presi­dent Brian Callaghan. 
i 

· The purpose of the proposal is multi-leveled. Neal stressed one partcular objective: social unity. "It appears to me that most ofthe social activity on this campus takes place in the halls," she said. 
The new plan calls for a more campus-oriented social program, replacing present commissions with more comprehensive committees. Including representatives from each hall, these committees would theoretically lead to significant in­creases in social interaction for the entire campus, said Neal. 
She also noted that the new com­mittees would cut out much of the wasteful overlap between current Student Union commissions, thus producing a much more efficient operation. 
Another issue the plan addresses is the changing of the Student Government working year from an April-to-April calendar to a February-to-December schedule. This modification would have a great impact on the current election process and political term sevice. 

Drouillard explained that the main reason for this constitutional change focuses on the prevention of "second semester drag" a problem in student government. "Students just aren't as motivated in their second semester," he said. 
Another constitutional change in­cluded in the plan is the changing of the comptroller's position to a con­troller's. This reform is more than a pure semantic twist. 
Under this change, the respon­sbilities of the present office of comptroller would be reduced to a purely record keeping and "paper shuffling" post, said Drouillard. The responsibility of financial manage­ment would fall on the director's shoulders, significantly increasing the director's workload. 
Drouillard said that changes of this nature are the difficulties of this proposal. Any modification of the student government constitution re­quires the approval of the Student Senate, the Hall Presidents' Council, and all hall councils. It is in this stage that bills of the past years have run aground, he said. 
But Drouillard is optimistic. "We (the Student lhion) have a good relationship with Student Govern­ment this year," he said. "I think this will go through." 
Holding two year's experience in the Student Union, Drouillard is in full support of the proposal. "This is what we think will work the best," he said.

District 2 Student Senate can­didates Doug O'Brien and Pat Browne hold similar views on the use of alcohol on campus, the final exam policy, and the need to look into bookstore prices. 
O'Brien, a Cavanaugh junior, says a decision to restrict alcohol use on campus to those students 21 and older would be "unenforceable and impractical.'' He adds,"Some R.A.'s 


Conclusions same in French, U.S. ishops' letters on nuclear weapons 
ByJOHN NEBLO 
StaffReporter 
"There is no essential difference of opinion between the French and American bishops' letter on nuclear arms," said Father Gerard Defois, former secretary general of the French bishop's conference. "The differences in the letters lie not in the conclusions drawn, but in the methodology used," he said. 
Defois, who is credited with writing the bulk of the controversial French bishops' statement, said the American bishops' letter is a "120­page overview of the problem which analyzes theological, scrip­tural, traditional. and pastoral im­plications." 
U.S. critics ofthe French letter say the document is too conservative because it does not challenge direct· ly the French government's posses­sion of nuclear weapons. 
Defois says such criticism is unfounded. 'lbe I ';-page letter. he said was onl · intended to "make a French bishops examined "the , tion, said Defois, adding, "nuclear political realities of today and then deterrence is not peace, it is only a inductively arrived at the moral im-: rightful means ofself-defense until a plications ofthe nuclear weapons." true peace can be realized.''

renunciation of violence as a means  
of self-defense, or the maintainance  
ofa credible deterrent to war.  
According to Defois, the first op­ 
tion  requires,  "an  extreme  moral  
heroism, a saintliness on the order of  
Gandhi, which simply cannot be ex­ 
pected  from  the  population  as  a  
whole." Thus. pacifism  on  the  na­

By comparison, said Defois, the  legitimate only as an interim solu­ 

would be stricter than others" in enforcing the policy, and this would 
be unfair. 

Browne, a Stanford sophomore, agrees that a change in the alcohol policy would be "totally ridiculous." Browne says, "It would turn R.A.'s into watchdogs, and people wouldn't trust each other." Accord­ing to Browne, students would simp­ly hide their drinking, and plan "illegal parties" despite the rule. 
Both O'Brien and Browne predict more underage students in local bars and an increase in drunk driving accidents as a result of more off­campus parties. Also, both agree that adjustments could be made in party . room regulations rather than forbid­ding alcohol altogether. 
In regard to the proposed final ex­am policy change, O'Brien says, "It makes you wonder what a student is expected to get out of a class when all there is to worry about is the final exam" According to O'Brien, rcquir· ing a final exam to account for one­third to two-thirds of one's final grade is unfair. "A steady progres­sion of work throughout the semes­ter is the most accurate way to evaluate a student," says O'Brien. 
Likewise, Browne says, "No one's performance can be judged for an entire semester on one test.'' He adds, "the discretion of whether or not to make finals accumulative should be up to the teacher or the department.'' 
O'Brien, a history major, says, "A good student senator knows what's going on in hall council.'' O'Brien has been on Cavanaugh's Hall Coun­cil for two years as both a council member and a social commissioner. and , if elected. he plans to regularly attend hall council meetings in his district. 
O'Brien says, "It's important for the administration to know how the students feel,"and he say heintends to relay exactly what the con· stituents want. 
O'Brien says a senator's job is to "analyze and propose new policies," and that it is "unrealistic to promise to change already existing univer­sity policies.'' 
According to O'Brien, the Student 
Union is out of touch with the Uni­versity, and he says he would like to see more interaction between the two. He also sees a need for more interaction between senators and their constituents. "People trip right over their senators without knowing who there are," he says. 
O'Brien says, "We need senators who are not afraid to say what they think." If, collectively, "the senators exemplify strong leadership and voice, as a union we can get things done.'' 
Browne, an accounting major, was a member of the Freshman Ad· visory Council last year and is presently a member of the Sopho­more Advisory CounciL He is also a social commissioner on the Stanford Hall Council. 
Browne says he likes the idea of District 2 consisting of a quad with

the dorms in such close proximity to each other. "I would like to promote unity on North Quad through ac­tivities,"says Browne. Some such ac­tivities would be a "progressive party with just the district and a movie or two shown at Haggar Hall." 
He says he would also like to "set up a District 2 Advisory Council with hall presidents and random students in which I would compile views of students in the district and carry them to the senate." 
.Browne sees a present problem with student/rector relations. He says he would work towards "better communications between students and their rectors.'' He would like to "motivate rectors to get involved with the students in their dorm." He says this could be accomoplished by encouraging rectors to help stu­dents in coordinating social ac· tivities. 
If elected, Browne says he will do the best job he can do and "make the best ofthings" himself. Says Browne,

Two of three students at the University receive 
some form of financial aid, according to a preliminary 1983-84 report from the Office of Financial Aid. A total of 6,175 students averaged S'i,319 in assistance. Forms of aid, which are expected to total S52.8 million this academic year, include scholarships, grants­in-aid. loans, campus employment, federal assistaP.ce progrmes, Res<:rve Offin.·r Training Corps awards, and non-federal funds.

After violating university policyconcern­
ing liabilities, sanitation, and contracts with vendors last spring, 
Ohio State students came to an agreement with Dean of Students 
Mitchel Livingston. The problem arose from students illegally selling 
bakt.·d goods in the dorms to raise money. Livingston got vendors to agree to the sale of products they weren't presently offering, and showed students what they had to do to meet the sanitation laws. While the new policy makes food sales possible, it doesn't make tht.·m easy. Sales of homemade food are still prohibited. And while fruit, nuts, and popcorn may be sold raw, cookies, donuts, and the like must be individually prepackaged. The policy keeps students from having to buy expensive state and local licenses, but a lot of campus paperwork is involved. In addition, vending machine owners insisted that student food sales be at least 30 feet away from tht. :r machines. -The Obsen,er

Clarification 

In an article which appeared in yesterday's Observer, Doug Wurth, a candidate for Student Senate dis­trict 1, was quoted as saying "there is not enough information" to take a position on the alcohol proposal. Wurth was referring to the yet-to­be-released proposal being drafted 

by the Provost's Committee for the Responsible Use of Alcohol. 
Wurth said last night that he is opposed to the idea of a dry campus. "Banning alcohol would be an unwise and irresponsible move on the part ofthe administra­tion," he said. 
The article also stated that the administration has a policy to ban alcohol from the campus. In fact, there is yet no such policy. Ban­ning alcohol is only one of many options that the committee is studying, according to the latest statements by Father William Beauchamp, chairman and ad­ministrative assistant to the ex­ecutive vice president.

Decision to remove troops to help Reagan politically despite attacks 
Associated Press 
SANTA BARBARA, CA. · Prt>sident Rt·agan's order to move U.S. Marines in Bdrut to the sakty of ships off­shore was a dream come true for politkal strategists plotting his rt·· dt·ction campaign en·n tbough it escalated the ll.S. military role in Lebanon. 
Suggtstions now have been raised that Reagan reneged on his word not "to cut and run" from Lebanon. And Democrats stepped up their attack on him for keeping the troops there as long as ht· did. 
Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said he would have been rductant to withdraw; "I think that the consequences ofsomething that is perceived to he an American withdrawal under pressure in the face of the opposite statements that have been made (by Reagan) for weeks is likely to be quite serious throughout the Middle East and maybe other parts ofthe world." 
Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., said, "I'd rather lose a little face than lose a half-million men." 
Still, Reagan's decision seems sure to help him politically. 
As Electioft Day approaches, the media will not show Marines in hunkers or stretchers carrying woundtd and dead servicemen from bombed-out shelters, but U.S. warplant·s streaking over Beirut and warships offshore pounding Syrian­hacked artillery positions. 
At Reagan's campaign headquar­ters in Wa.'ihington, advisers had hoped for just such a decision.

Doctor joins patients in picketing copper co. 
Associated Press 
CLIFTON, Ariz.-Dr. jorge O'Leary not only treats his patients' ills, he has become a leader of their strike against Phelps Dodge Corp., the cop­per company that used to employ him. 
He walks the picket line. He offers free medical help to needy pickets. He calls the seven month-old strike by miners "our cause." 
"We are on the right track," O'Leary said, "we arc hard-working people and I think that sooner or later God is going to help us, or society, or whoever." 
O'Leary, 43, runs the People's Clinic in a converted feed store in Clifton, seeing 30 to 35 patients a day, many of whom don't pay. 
Only a few months ago, he was a company doctor working at a hospi· tal owned by Phelps Dodge. During 12 years there, he had delivered some 2,500;babies. But, he said, he became radicalized when the com­pany usd its hospital and the hospi­tal's medical staff "to break the strike" that ha.~ torn this town. 
In October, during chaos result­ing from the worst flooding in CJif. ton in nearly a century, Phelps Dodge terminated him from his S50,000-a-year posrtlon on its Morenci Hospital staff for what management called his "inflammatory behavior." 
He had accused the hospital of

The hospital administration denied the allegations and declined his offer. After he was tired, he said, he was told he could rent office space at the hospital for several thousand dollars a month. He declined the offer. But he retains visiting priileges. He was evicted from his company-owned housing. 
Within a week or so of his firing, 
O'Leary, with the help of strikers, 

opened the Pl'ople's Clinic in this 
town of 4,200 people. While many 
of his patients pay nothing, O'Leary 
said his 10 to 15 private patients and 
those enrolled with the state's ex­
permental ACCESS health care 
program for indigents haVl' allowed 
him to become "self-sufficient, al­
most." 
O'Leary, a native of Hermosillo, Mexico, is the son of a Yaqui Indian and an Irishman who ran a large Mexican brewery. He is beloved by his patients, and has also drawn praise from the Arizona medical es­tablishment. 
He said he has received hundreds of supportive letters and an es­timated S3,000 to 55,000 in dona· tions that have paid for medical supplies and equipment.

Congressional leaders are worried 



Who's who in Beirut 
over use of naval force in Beirut 
Associated Press 
DRUSE militia; Druse remain in 
something extra special 

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Congres­sional leaders yesterday expressed relief over the planned withdrawal of Marines from Beirut but some worried about President Reagan's broadened rules for the use of naval guns and planes against Syrian­backed forces. 
"The situation is still very fluid and very dangerous," said Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Commit­tee. It will "be a matter ofgreat con­cern to us," he said. 
Senate Majority Leader Howard H. Baker Jr., R-Tenn., said he has asked his staff and the White House to look into whether naval bombardment of Druse forces in Lebanon under Reagan· s new "rules ofengagement" requires additional authority from Congress. 
Baker told reporters he thinks the 

bombardment is covered by the war 
powers resolution Congress passed 
last fall, but added that he has not ex­
amined the ques~ion closely. "I have 
asked White House counsel for a 
· 

briefing on the subject," he said. 
Reagan announced Tuesday that he has ordered U.S. Marines gradual­ly withdrawn from their station at the Beirut airport to U.S. ships stand­ing off Lebanon in the Mediter­ranean. 
He also shifted U.S. strategy to permit naval guns and warplanes to strike at Syrian-backed factions even if American forces have not come under attack. Until now, the Marines ftred in self-defense, with the ships authorized to join in the retaliation. 
The resolution passed by Congress in September authorized the administration to keep Marines in Lebanon for up to 18 months, but required the president to seek con­gressional authority for any sig­nificant change in the mission ofU.S. forces there. 
Baker said new congressional authority presumably would be needed for the stepped-up training and equipping of the Lebanese armed forces which Reagan also an­nounced.

has been considering a resolution 
urging  a  quick  pullout  of  the  
Marines.  
Rep.  Morris  K. Udall,  D-Ariz.,  

praised the decision to withdraw but said he was "dismayed that the withdrawal is being accompanied with increased shelling of M:>slem positions by U.S. warships." 
Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum, R­Kan., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said withdrawing the troops was at least "a step in a different direction" but questioned whether putting them on the ships "is not just another ver­sion ofbeing a sitting duck." 
Navy SecretaryJohn F. LehmanJr., told the House Armed Services Committee that the U.S. mission in Lebanon "remains one of peacekeeping, there has not been an escalation." 
Baker commented, "We're not going to abandon Lebanon. We will support (Lebanon) with naval ar­tillery and airpower." 
Asked whether he agrees with some in Congress who say the troops should be brought home, Baker replied, "Maybe so, but I'm not willing to say that yet. I think there is still a chance, maybe a slight chance, that we can have an inde­pendent and viable government" in Lebanon. 

Legal drinking age of 21 is target of state legislatures across country 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The highway death toll among young drinking drivers, especially under-age youngsters who cross state borders to drink legally, is the target of scores of bills in state legislatures aimed at raising the legal drinking age. 
"There is a tremendous amount of interest in raising the drinking age throughout the country," saidJohn !Vloulden ofthe National Transporta­tion Safety Board as he scanned a 
computer  printout  of  alcohol­ 
related  legislation  being  debated  
across the country.  ·  

He estimates more than 200 proposals have been introduced in various state legislatures. 
The problem of teen-age drinking was cited by President Reagan's commission on drunken driving, which urged in December after an IS-month study that Congress set a legal drinking age of 21 and cut federal highway funds to a state that fails to enforce it. 
"There is evidence ofa direct cor­relation between the minimum

Here is an outline of the deploy­ment of troops and militias in 'Lebanon: 
AMAL shiite militia; the largest of the Shiite Moslem militias has taken control of Moslem west Beirut and the southern suburbs and is joined by Druse militias and defecting units of the Lebanese army. They appear to have stopped shooting, and the militiamen have been ordered off the streets. 
LEBANESE army; sixty percent of the 37,000 enlisted men are Shiites. Many ofthe units appear to have dis­persed or defected. Part of the 8th Brigade was in the central moun­tains battling Druse. The Sixth Brigade has defected to the rebels and said it will assume security duties in west Beirut. The remaining Lebanese soldiers are scattered and refusing to fight. 
SYRIAN forces; Syrians occupy the northern and eastern sections of Leb t anon and support the Shiites and the Druse in their fight against the government and the army. 
U.S. MARINES; 1,400 men in bunkers at their headquarters at Beirut International Airport at the southern edge of the city await or­ders for redeployment to ships of the U.S. 6th Fleet off the shores of Lebanon. 
the central mountains overlooking Beirut, and. are reported firing on Christian-held east Beirut. Their ar­tillery positions have been reported hit by shells from the U.S. Navy bat­tleship New Jersey. Druse have joined the Shiites controlling west Beirut. 
CHRISTIAN militia; the military wing of the Phalange Party, which is headed by President Amin Gemayel's father, controls east Beirut and an area to the north. 
ITALIAN forces; some I,400 are in the Shiite and Palestinian slums of Beirut, north ofthe airport. On Wed­nesday Italy ordered a gradual withdrawal. 
FRENCH forces; more than 1,800 men, headquartered at the racetrack on the old green line frontier be­tween east and west, remain at their posts but patrols outside their sector have been halted. 
BRITISH forces; all 115 men have been pulled out of their suburban position in an abandoned tobacco factory and moved to a Royal Navy ship offthe coast. 
ISRAELI forces; Israeli troops are deployed in south Lebanon, behind a line at the A wali River in an area inhabited largely by Shiite Moslems.

The ballet of devils in Central America 
Tht· great tragedy of American foreign policy is that it is formulatnl and conducted by lwartless cynics who masquerade a~ realists. This is pnfl-ctly illustrated in an ar­ticle on El Salvador by Robert Tucker, a professor of international law and diplomacy, 
John Murphy 

Guest column 
appearing in the October issue of The New Republic. 
Tlll"ker states that an American defeat in El Salvador would have no significance for our actual national security, hut he asserts that it would alt'cct that amorphous, abstract quan­tity known as "the credibility of American power." 
Tuckl·r weaves his arguments with words like submission, demands, humiliation, con­demnation and nmtt·mpt. lie even terms military intervention in El Salvador lasting a year or more a "modest enterprise." 
Yet never once docs he speak ofthe conse­quences for the Salvadorans. Not so much as a tip of the hat to a people who have suffered immense hunger, torture and violent death for years. No consideration ofthe implications his alternatives would have on human life in the country called "The Savior." 
This same cold, rational calculation is seen in the recently released report of the Kissin­ger Commission. By now the fact thar the roots of Central American unrest lie in poverty and social injustice is common knowledge, even to Kissinger. So naturally the report recommends extensive economic aid to the impoverished region, and incidentally to its people. It only makes good strategic sense. 
Similarly the commission recommends continued aid to the contra rebels battling Nicaragua; this despite the influence that the contra raids have had on the general well­being of the Nicaraguan people. 
As detailed by Richard M. Garfield in the New York Times these "freedom fighters" have killed more than I000 peasants, created 56,000 refugees and the disease and malnutri­tion which usually accompany them, and have destroyed 22 rural health posts and hospitals. 

In the process of that la~t one they succeeded in killing 19 health workers and abducting, torturing and raping 26 more. But then it all makes such good strategic sense. 
Of course this administration also has dis­played its concern over human rights abuses in El Salvador. "Abuses" such as the report that 83 young people and children whose decapit· ulated bodies were found in August 1981 had been beheaded by security forces, as detailed in the 1982 Amnesty International annual report. 
So on his recent visit Secretary of State George Shultz stressed to the government that Congress would never approve more military aid unless things like that ceased. In­cidentally he added human rights progress would benefit the people too, because "who wants to live in a country where murder takes place on such a scale and isn't punished." It would be funnier ifit weren't so pathetic. 
Napolean Duarte, a Notre Dame graduate, voiced some words of wisdom on this subject once. He said, "If the people of my country only believed that tomorrow would be better than today, that their children would live a better life than they did, then the communists could bring all the guns they wanted into El Salvador and there would be nobody to pick them up." 
Maybe his people would bt· justified in 
believing that tomorrow will be better if only 
an American politician (or voter) could be 
found who gave a damn about them. 
Instead it's as Gustav Ha~ford wrote after 
returning from Vietnam: 
"Politics is a ballet ofdevils, and politicians, with paper roses falling out of their mouths, cannot conceal the blood from distant wounds that stains their neckties -but they do try, and millions do listen and believe, and choose not to sec." 
Or to care for that matter.

Seeond leading scorer 
NBA Standin·gs
Parsons setting and getting goals 
ByJOHN MENNELL 
Sports Writer 
Adam Parsons came to Notre 
Dame four years ago to get an educa­
tion. But he's al'io getting goals for 
the hockey team. 
Parsons is the second leading 
scorer on the team, already having 
netted 18 goals and 26 assists this 
season, but says modestly, "I'm 
doing all right." 
He still has five games plus the 
Central States Collegiate Hockey 
League tournament left to increase 
those stats. 
The CSCHL is the third league Par­
sons has played in with the Irish. 
"First we played in the Western Col­
legiate Hockey Association," Par­
sons says. "That was good. We flew 
everywhere. It was also the best 
competition." 
The next league for Parsons was 
the Central Collegiate Hockey As­
sociation. "It wasn't that bad, but we 
had to take the bus a lot," he says. 
Parsons' sophomore year had its share of ups (winning the Great Lakes Invitational Tournament in Detroit) and downs (beating Bowling Green in the semi-finals oJ the CCHA Tournament, only to watch Bowling Green go to the NCAA Tournament while the Irish stayed home). But Parsons had a goal in that upset victory over Bowling Green. 
"As seniors we have seen a lot of changes through the years," he says. "The biggest disappointment wa~ the change to club. 
"The change hasn't been as bad as I thought it would be. Lefty (Smith) has made it fun. We take it seriously,

although pressure-wise, this year has 
been more relaxed." 
Coming into the season Parsons had goals for himselfand the team. " I wanted to go undefeated to show the administration," he says. "I wanted to do the best I could per­sonally. I didn't have any particular numbers I was trying for. 
"We, as seniors, wanted to go back to varsity just as badly as the rest of the team. I'm glad it's going back. I have a lot offriends on the team." 
Parsons sees his role on the team 

as one of responsibility. "As seniors 
we try to lead by example both on 
and off the ice," he says. "We're 
supposed to be more experienced 
and depended upon. I always looked 
up to the seniors and now I accept 
that role." 
Parsons hopes to win the rest of 

the season's games and the CSCHL 
tournament. 
After that his plans aren't so definite. "I'd like to try to play pro hockey, If not I'll try to ftnd a real job," he says. "Lefty has talked about (my) possibly playing in Europe. I'd like to try out for an NHL club and

"I just don't want to get a job and 
wonder five years from now if I 
could have made it. If I try out at 
least I can say I tried." 

In his four years at Notre Illme, 
Parsons admits that he has matured, 
having gotten used to the freedom of 
college. "I don't think I could live at 
home," he comments. "Lefty has 
done some disciplinary things to me. 
I didn't like them at the time, but it 
was for my own good." 

Parsons chose Notre Dame for more than its hockey program. "I came here because ofthe education, " he says. "A lot of the schools that I talked to talked only about hockey. I wanted to go where I could play and graduate." 
Parsons has no complaints about his time at Notre Dame. "I've enjoyed myself," he says. "They say college is the best time of your life but you don't realize it until it's over. I think I've started to realize it. 
"I've got friends now that I'm going to have for the rest of my life. Sometimes coming over to the rink is :1 real pain but when you don't have it you really miss it."

SARAJEVO, Yugoslavia -Just one game into the Olympic hockey tournament, Team USA is in an all or nothing situation. After the emotion­packed gold medal performance in Lake Placid four years ago, the 1984 Olympians may not even be in medal contention this tine. 
Already 0-1, the Americans' op­ponent today is powerful Czecho­slovakia, a close runner-up to the Soviets in the World Champion­ships. 
There are six teams in each divi­sion in the hockey competition and the two that have the most points in each group will advance to the medals round. For the Americans to

game. Other front-line players will be Steve Perry ( 4. 3 ppg, 4.6 rpg) and Aundra Bell (3.9 ppg, 5.5 rpg). 
On defense, the Knights probably will play a match-up zone, and they also may employ a zone press against the Irish. 
The Irish wiJl be led once again by captain Tom Sluby. The senior swingman is averaging 16.6 points per game.

loss, and even a tie in any of the remammg four games would probably eliminate them from con­tention. 
Czechoslovakia entered the Olympics as the favorite in the B group. 
"They are an excellent team and they should have beaten the Soviets in the World Championships," said 
U.S. Coach Lou Vairo, whose team 
dropped  its  opener  Tuesday  to  
Canada 4-2.  
Canada  lost two  players  in  an  

eligibility dispute spurred by Fin­land, but blamed on the Americans, and that turned out to be an in­centive in the first game. The Czec­hoslovaks also have an incentive ­
Last Monday, Kempton sat out the game against Vermont with a calf in­JUry, while Buchanan was nursing tendinitis. The two regulars were replaced in Monday's lineup by Donald Royal and Joe Howard, both ofwhom should see a fair amount of playing time tonight. 
Another player who has been playing well off the bench is sopho­moreJoseph Price, who is averaging 
7.1 points per game. 
According to Phelps, there are two things Notre Dame must do to stop the Knights. 
"We just have to do the things we 
didn't do on the road last weekend U.S. in the 1980 Olympics. 
"We are a new team," said Ludek Bukac, coach of Czechslovakia. "We are not the same team that lost in 1980. 
"The Americans have a good team. They did not play their best against Canada. We expect them to play their best against us." 
.Czechoslovakia belted Norway 
I 0-4 Tuesday in its first game. 
In other games today, Canada plays Austria, the Soviet Union takes on Italy, Poland plays West Ger­many, Finland faces Norway and Sweden opposes Yugoslavia. The Soviets, West Germans, Finns and Swedes also won the openers. 
(at South Carolina)," Phelps says, "which are, one, rebound and get of­fensive rebounds, and, two, get the reversals and penetration and get it inside." 
Another thing the Irish probably will try to do is shut down Battle. Notre Dame's defense, which is ranked second in the nation, already has shut down several high-scoring players this year. 
Most of those fme defensive per­formances have come at the ACC, however, and South Carolina's Jim­my Foster showed that the Irish defense can be less successful on the road. Foster had 19 points in last Saturday's game. 
Phelps is not too concerned that his players will relax against the Knights. 
"Knowing that a lot ofthese guys are coming back home (Kempton and Dolan)," he says, "and that we lost back there last year to Fordham, we will be ready to play." 


The Observer Thursday, February 9,j984 -page I 0 Spirit and dedication 

Junior Suess handles her roles well 
By DAVE WILSON 
Sports Writer 

The I 9H3-84 basketball season has been tough on Saint Mary's, tes­ting the players' efforts on and at­titudes off the court. The Belles have struggled to just four wins in seven­teen contests, playing teams that are sometimes stronger, and always tall­er. Elaine Suess, a junior from Grand Blanc, Mich., is one player who has learned to handk the frustration. 
"It takes a lot of dedication to hang in there when you lose so much," says Suess. "We're playing teams with more experience and more talent. and that's when you just learn to do the best you can and be happy with that." 
Perhaps that dedication has developed from Suess' lifelong inter­est in sports. A co-captain and start­ing wing for the Belles (along with senior Cyndy Short), Suess played four full years ofboth basketball and softball in high school, and received athlete-of-the-year honors her senior year. Following the basketball season, she will switch gears to 
assume her position on the Saint Mary's varsity softball team. 
"I can't imagine not playing bas­ketball," she says. "Being involved in sports means missing out on other aspects of the college experience, hut that's how important basketball is to me." 
Despite the awkwardness of having to play out ofposition, as well as the frustration of losing many games, Suess is in the midst ofan out­standing season. She has scored in

steal to put Illinois State back up by five. 
It looked like lights out for the Irish, but Dougherty still had some magic left. The junior guard quickly hit a short jumper, then followed an Illinois State turnover with an off­balance ten-footer to bring the Irish back within one at 60-59. 
On the ensuing Redbird posses­sion, Dougherty quickly fouled Tur­ner, who went to the line to shoot one and one with 17 seconds remaining. Turner hit both, hut a Redbird lane violation nullified the second shot and gave the Irish a chance to play for overtime. 
Dougherty drove the lane, but ran into heavy traffic and the hall deflected off to the right side to Bas­ford. The sophomore guard got off a hurried 20-foot shot that bounced off the side of the rim as the buzzer sounded, signaling another heartbreaking defeat for the Irish. 
Dougherty, who for the second 
consecutive game finished with a 
team-high 19 points, cited some 
positive factors in Notre Dame's per­
formance. 
"Sometimes when we're in a close 
game like this one we'll justroll over 
and die. Tonight, we came Ick well, 
even though we were dow by five points with only 34 second left. We showed a lot 'f>f confidenn in com­ing hack, and we had a grc chance to win. But they (Illinois St· te) did a good job defensively on the la.~t 
play." 
Nor are the Irish, now H-12, ready to roll over and die this season, according to Dougherty. 
"We're hungry for the nex t game (Villanova comes to the ACC on Saturday). We're not going to give up on ourselves. We really could've won tonight, but we'll still turn things around. Once we win that first really close game, things will start falling our way." 
They certainly deserve it after coming up empty last night.

Another heartbreaker 
ND women fall short of Illinois St. 
By lARRY BURKE 
Sports Writer 
Coming off a heartbreaking 73-72 loss at Michigan State lao;t Friday, the lao;t thing the Notre Dame women's basketball team needed was another narrow defeat. 
lltat's exactly what they got last night, however, as the Redbirds ofIl­linois State th'l"'lartcd a spirited Irish rally and held on for a 61-59 victory at the ACC. 
lltisdefeat was especially frustrat­ing for Notre Dame because they were forced to play catch-up from the outset. In the opening minute, the teams traded bao;;kets as llliois State guard Cathy Becsely hit a 12­foot jump shot and Notre Dame's Laura Dougherty scored on a layup. But then the Redbirds' Dawn Hallet scored three straight baskets and the Irish were down 8-2. 
Junior center Mary Beth Schueth, who finished with 1 5 points, then got things going for the Irish, scoring Notre Dame's next three baskets, hut Illinois State was up to the task. Becsely hit a 15-foot jumper to put the Redbirds up I 5-8, and it looked like the beginning ofa long night for the Irish. 
Notre Dame hung tough, however, and began to chip away at the lead. With 3:09 left in the half, sophomore guard Lynn Ebben hit Carrie Bates with a pinpoint pass un­derneath. Bates, who had 1 5 points on the night, convened the layup to bring the Irish back within two, 25­23. 
The Redbirds regained their com­posure, however, and scored the last six points ofthe halfto take an eight­point lead. 
The Irish made things even more difficult for themselves in the second half, letting Illinois State score the first stx points for a 37-23 lead. 
But once again Notre Dame regrouped and staned to come back. 
At the midway point ofthe secon half, the Irish went on a 6-0 spun (four by Bates) to pull within five, 49-44. 
llte Redbirds regained command at that point, and took a seven-point lead into the final three minutes of 

Irish on the road again to try to end streak 
By PHIL WOLF 
Sports Writer 
llte Notre Dame men's basketball team ha<; definitely had its problems on the road this year. In fact, only one of the team's six losses this year has come at the Athletic and Con­V<)(."ation Center. 
Tonight the Irish will be on the road, again -this time against Rut­gers at the Byrne Meadowlands Art·na. 
Notre Dame has never won a game at tht· Meadowlands in three attempts. hut the 1 5-6 Irish have a good chance to end that streak tonight. 
'Jltc Rutgers S<:arlet Knights arc a relatively young and inexperienced team compared to last year's 23-8 squad, which played two games in the NCAA Tournament. 
Tom Young's Knights have only a 8-I I record this seao;<>ll, and his team has dropped five of its last six con­tests. 
Rutgers still poses a threat to the Irish, however, according to Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps. 
"Tommy Young has always done a lot ofgood things with Rutgers' bas­ketball program," Phelps says, "to have it where it's one ofthe teams in the nation that can give anybody a battle on a given night. 
"And I'm sure tonight will be a given night for Rutgers," the Irish coach continues. "This is a game where they'll come into it with everything to gain and nothing to lose, knowing that if they win, a win like this would give them nothing hut momentum." 
Trying to gain some of that momentum will he the Knights' leading scorer, junior john Battle. Battle has averaged 20. 1 points per game this year on 51 percent shoot­ing from his guard position. 
Rutgers' other scoring threats are guard Brian Ellerbe and forward Chris Remley, both of whom are averaging almost ten points per

play. The Irish refused to quit, however. Dougherty hit a 15-footer and backcoun mate Denise Basford convened a layup off a steal, and suddenly Notre Dame was within a point at 56-55. 
Following a &dhird timeout, the visitors regained the momentum as Hallet hit a shon bank shot and guard Tammy Turner scored off a

Irish avenge only loss against Lake Forest 
By ED DOMANSKY 
Sports Writer 
The Lake Forest Foresters did not rank high on the popularity list of the Notre Dame hockey team after they handed the Irish their first loss of the sea'i<>n Jan. 25 at Lake Forest. Last night at the ACC, however, Notre Damt.· got its revenge by defeating the Foresters, 6-4. lltc win also enabled the Irish to reach the 20-win plateau as they upped their scao;on record to 20-1-0. 
Adam Parsons scored the hat trkk 
for the second game in a row to lead 
Notre Dame scorers. Bob Thebeau 
added two goal-;, and t.'o-captain 
Brent Chapman had a goal and two 
assists. 
The Irish hopes for revenge looked bleak early in tht· game as Lake Forest grabbed a quick 2-0 lead on goals hy Ken Spencer and Mike Browne. 
Notre Dame finally got on the scoreboard at 14:43 of the opening stanza as Thebeau raced in all alone on Forester goalie Stuan Frye and put a backhand over the sliding goalie's outstretched stick. 
That cut the Lake Forest lead to 2-1 just 19 seconds after it had capitalized on a powcrplay with joe Bowie of Notre Dame off for charg­ing. 
Sloppy play was a problem for the Irish through most ofthe first period as they tried to adjust to the fast, scrappy Forester style ofplay. 
"At the beginning we were having a tough time adjusting to the quick­ness of Lake Forest," said Head Coach Lefty Smith. "It takes some time to get on track after playing some of the slower club teams that we do." 
Notre Dame knotted the score at 
4:53 of the second period when Par­sons tipped home a pass from Chap­man on a two-on-one break 
Just over three minutes later Lake Forest's Steve Pinciak stole the puck from Irish goalt _.t·nderTim Lukenda and put it in the net to put the Fores­ters back in front, 3-2. 
lltebeau and Parsons hoth pickl·d up their second goals of the night to round out second period scoring and givt Notre Dame its first kad of the night at 4-3. 
As things turned out, the lead was never to he rdinquished. Two Irish powerplay goals in the third period provided a 6-3 margin with just six minutes remaining in the game. 
Parsons completed the hat trick with an unas.o;isted goal at 6:05 put­ting Notre Dame up 5-3. Chapman then hanged a rebound off Frye's pads at I 3:4 2 for the final Irish tally of the contest. 
"Revenge is sweet," said Chap­man. "We owed this one to tht·m. Tht·y were laughing at us after the game up tht·re lao;t time." 
Tim Locke picked up the fourth Lake Forest score on a powerplay at 14:32. 
"Getting psyched up had a lot to do with the last game against them." said Mark Benning. "(Tonight) it wa<; a hard-hitting game, and you can really get into a game like that." 
Lukcnda had 21 saves in earning the victory. Frye had 42 for the losers. 
Lake Forest now drops to 9-9-1 on the season. 
lltc next action for Notre Dame is this weekend as the team travels to Penn State to take on the Nittany Lions. 



The 1984 Recruits 17 prospects sign with Gerry Faust 
By MIKE SULLIVAN 
Sports Editor 

Yesterday was the first day that high school seniors coulc;I sign lettersofintent to play football at the college of their choice and Notre Dame once again received commitments from some highly-recruited prospects. However, unlike the past three years, Gerry Faust did not rule the recruiting world. He got signatures from 1 7 players, far below the levels of previous years. He also grabbed four Parade Magazine All-Americans, a high number for most colleges, hut the lowest total of his four years ofrecruiting. 
There is no reason to panic, though. With three ex­cellent recruiting years in a row, Faust did not really need another great year. Also, while the number was lower than usual, the incoming players fill some impor-tant hOles at linebacker, defensive back, and fullback. 
Terry Andrysiak  QB  6-1  
Mark Antonietti  OUDL  6-3  
James Baugus  c  6-4  
Tim Brown  WR  6-0  
Tom Byrne  QB  6-4  
Matt Dingens  LB  6-6  
Tony Eason  P/DB  6-4  
Cedric Figaro  LB  6-3  
Darrell Gordon  LB  6-3  
Jeff Kunz  DL  6-6  
Pat Pesavento  QB  6-2  
Wesley Pritchett  LB  6-5  
Tony Roos  OUDL  6-6  
Duke St. Pierre  QB  6-2  
FrankStams  FB  6-4  
Reggie Ward  WR  5-10  
Brandy Wells  DB  6-0  

"Our freshman class for 1984 features quality instead of quantity," said Faust. "We didn't have as many im­mediate needs this year because of the number of players coming back and the depth we have at certain positions. Consequently, we had fewer individuals visit and we didn't expect a large class in terms ofnumbers." 
The four players who were honored by Parade are defensive back Brandy Wells from Montclair, N.j., ful­lback Frank Starns from Akron, Ohio, wide receiver Reggie Ward from tong Beach, Calif., and linebacker Cedric Figaro from Lafayette, La Another player to watch is linebacker Matt Dingens, the brother of cur­rent Irish lineman Greg Dingens. 
It is also possible that a few more recruits could sign
