Government report calls for better ways of avoiding teen pregnancy 
WASIIINGTON (API -The fnderal government spent more than $21.5 billion last ynar on welfare programs for families started by ttwn-agers. aer.ording to a report released Sunday. 
The amount is $1.7 billion higher than for 1988 -partly because of inflation and expansion of Medicaid benefits, but also due to an increase in births to teen­agers, said the Center for Population Options report. 
Thn figures illustrate the nned for greater efforts to prevent teen-age pregnancies -including sex education, family planning counseling, support for delaying sexual activity, access to contraception, and medical services, including abortion, the report said. 
"We can no longer let our youth stumble into parenting, a course that should be em­barked on only when one is ready, willing and able to be­come a parent," the report said. 
The costs of teen-age preg­nancies go far beyond those of public support, the report said. 
"Too-early childbearing often impoverishes ... the lives of girls brought too soon into the rigors and responsibilities of motherhood, of boys bewil­dered and unable to parent and provide adequately, of babies not planned or welcomed," the report said. 
"It places a heavy burden on families and communities and contributes to our country's unconscionably high rates of low birthweight and neonatal mortality," it said. 
The most alarming increases in teen-age pregnancies are occurring among 15 to 17 year olds, the report said. 
After a downward trend in births among this age group from 1970 into the mid 1980s, the rate began increasing. It jumped from 30.6 per 1,000 teen-agers in 1986 to 33.8 in 1988, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.

Roadtripping: a learning experience? 
On the road again, I just can't wait to get on the road again ... 
Ahh. what a wicked web we weave when we commence to roadtrippin.' The Irish went to East 


Lansing this weekend John O'Brien 
and won big-on the 
field and off. I, as an Managing Editor upstanding member of the University media, decided it was my job to file a report from an exotic place. 
As that was not possible, I settled for MSU. From this trip, I acquired a plethora, no-a myriad, no-make that a cornucopia of knowledge. 
First, my colleagues on this roadtrip pro­vided me with the most useful knowledge. With this being the Year of Women and all, I decided to venture north with five -count 'em FIVE-young ladies. When they can­celled out, I was stuck with 5 ND chicks. 
The old saying says, "When in Rome, do as Romans do." While none of these ladies were actually Roman, I decided to spend the roadtrip being just "one of the girls." Thus, before I left, I learned all the words to "I Am Woman" by Helen Reddy, bought some "coolers," and even got some of those Leprechaun face tattoos for the big game. 
I spent Friday night in a room at the Knights Inn with all five of the women, or more accurately on the floor of a room at the Knights Inn while the other five hogged the prime sleeping space (If you're reading this, Mom, don't worry-they're all in the convent program here and it was totally­almost painfully-platonic.) 
Let me tell the men out there that I've been to the other side and I now know that women are just like us. Yes guys, they snore, they have cottonmouth breath in the morning, and in what must be the God-given equalizer, they pass gas. I'm serious. 
Second, I learned that streets in East Lansing, and probably Michigan in general, are really weird. In three days, we drove for about 13.6 hours on a street called "Saginaw." I have come to the conclusion that all streets in East Lansing are actually one street-"Saginaw." 
For example, to get to Dooley's Bar from the Knights Inn, you take "Saginaw" north to "Saginaw," and follow that for two miles until you hit "Saginaw." Turn right and there you are-Dooley's-1034 S. Saginaw. 
Next, I discovered that the only way to get around East Lansing is in an open convert­ible packed with five women. People who saw us cruising down "Saginaw" in the car probably thought I was a pimp, or at the very least, a stud. As anyone who knows me will attest, neither of these is true. 
What is true, however, is that roadtrip­ping can be both fun AND educational. If you have never gone on a roadtrip, do it be­fore it's too late. You never know what you might learn. And if you're considering going to the Tennessee game, call me. I have rela­tives there. They live on "Saginaw."

Newlyweds Kenneth and Stephanie Miller did not have the marriage made in heaven that they had envi­sioned, but they were in good spirits after the hot-air balloon they exchanged their vows in crashed into a tree in Nevada last Saturday. The balloon, with six people aboard, was launched at Gardnerville, Nev., 15 miles east of Lake Tahoe. An unexpected easterly breeze caught it and sent it west. The balloon deflated after it struck a tree and landed in Kinsbury Grade. The basket fell slowly to the ground, and no one was hurt. The reverend who performed the service commented, "We do specialty wed­dings but we don't guarantee such exciting landings."

Sheriff Charles Mulligan said that the marijuana harvesters who flock to Newton County, Indiana on weekends could wind up staying much longer than they planned. Seventy­eight "pot pickers" have already been arrested and jailed since the illegal plant became ready for harvest in July. Mulligan said authorities are pa­trolling fields continuously. Most of the pickers are charged with the possession of more than 30 grams of marijuana, a class d felony charge punishable by two years in jail and a fine of up to $10,000.

"The Cosby Show" drew more than twice the num­ber of viewers than a repeat of Fox's cartoon clan, "The Simpsons," national Nielsen audience estimates showed Friday in New York. Bill Cosby's TV family averaged a 
19.8 rating on Thursday night. Fox, which startled the industry by scheduling "The Simpsons" opposite Cosby's series, got only an 8.3 rating for its show. Part of Fox's lower rating is due to the fact that it only has 13 3 affili­ates, compared to more than 200 each for NBC, CBS and ABC. Another new series premiering Thursday, CBS' "The Flash," was second to Cosby's show in head-on competi­

Witness describes Doe's grisly death 
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -Grisly details emerged Sunday about the torture­slaying of former Liberian Pr11sident Samuel Doe, who dind earlier this month at the hands of rebels led by Prince Johnson. 
In Liberia's capital of Monrovia, meanwhile, a eease-fire continued to hold between two rebnl factions, a West African army and soldiers of the deposed leader. 
In an account in London's Sunday Observer newspaper, a Lebanese merchant from Monrovia said he watched Johnson's men torture Doe aft1~r thn president was cap­tured during a battle Sept. 9 at the headquarters of the West African army. 
"Doe's hands were cuffed to­gether and he had been shot in both legs and was bleeding heavily. They were abusing him," said the merchant, identifind only as Joseph. 
"Then one of Johnson's men took a knife, a machete, and cut off his ear. Then they cut his face like this," he told the nnwspaper, indicating diagonal slashes across the cheeks. "lie was crying and the blood was running down his cheeks from his face and head." 
The man said Doe at one point blew on the blood that had pooled on his body, and "one of Johnson's men thought he was trying to do some kind of juju (magic), blowing on himself to make himself disappear." 
"So he shot him again," the merchant continued. "He was nearly dead then, anyway, from loss of blood." The man said that was the last he saw of Doe. 
The Observer also quoted a Liberian teacher, identified only as Oliver, as saying he saw Doe's body later in the day. 
"They had him in a wheelbarrow and were pushing the body around the town. They were shouting, 'We've killed Doe,' and firing their guns in the air. 
"People were coming up to the body and cutting it with knives. Slashing at him. He had two fingers, maybe three, missing from one hand and they had cut off his testicles," the teacher said. 
"Then they took his body to the Island Clinic. For the first two or three days a lot of peo­ple were going to see it, but then the smell got too bad," Oliver said. 
Both witnesses were inter­viewed in Freetown, Sierra Leone. 
Their description was remi­niscent of an October 1985 scene when Doe put the muti­lated body of Brig. Gen. Thomas Quiwonkpa on display in an open car that toured Monrovia. 
Quiwonkpa was a mentor of Johnson, who served under the former army commander when Quiwonkpa tried to overthrow Doe and was captured.

IU's trustees will study proposal to ban ROTC over program's homosexual policy 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP)­Indiana University trustees have agreed to study a request from students to ban the ROTC program if military policy toward homosexuals doesn't change. 
The Bloomington student Senate approved such a resolution last week by a 16-3 vote. 
The students are seeking a ban on the student military organization if the U.S. military doesn't begin allowing homosexuals into the service by 1995. 
lU-Bloomington Student Association President Jerry Knight presented the request at the trustees' business meeting Saturday morning. 
Trustee John Walda said the panel wants feedback about ROTC from student groups on other campuses. They also need information about the effect of such a ban on military science classes and student scholarships. 
Trustee Robert McKinney noted that IU has about $2.5 million worth of Department of Defense grants in health areas "and we'd hate to lose those." 
About 300 students are in ROTC on the Bloomington campus. Although gay stu­dents may take ROTC classes, they may not enlist as many students do after the first two years of classes, and are not eligible for ROTC scholarships.

"The oil areas in Saudi Arabia and in other states of the region, all the oil installa­tions, will be rendered inca­pable ... and Israel will be transformed into something different from what they are now," said an Iraqi government statement broadcast by state-run Radio Baghdad and monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus. 
"America must realize clearly that it is pushing the entire region . . . in fact, even the whole world ... to the brink of a bottomless abyss, from which the region will never see light for dozens of years," said the statement, translated from Arabic by The Associated Press. 
Iraq's decision to stay away from the General Assembly session was reported by the official Iraqi News Agency. It said Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz told U.N. Secretary­General Javier Perez de Cuellar that Iraq's delegation would not come to New York unless restrictions on Iraqi Airways, its flag carrier, were lifted.

ronmental issues through the conference, according to Amy Jenista, Chairperson of the Board of Directors of the EAC on campus. "We have a lot of energy in this club. This confer­ence will help us to know what we can do and how we can get organized." 
The ND club has been at­tempting to affect the environ­mental issue through both edu­cation and action. EAC spon­sors speakers around the University and keeps students informed about some of the most pressing issues. 
The group has attempted to designate some of the land owned by the University as wilderness areas, to support recycling, and to reduce the amount of paper waste on campus. The club is also push­ing for an environmental audit of ND in order to determine problem areas. 
The EAC hopes that the con­ference will lead to direct talks with the Administration about issues on which the club is working and an increased awareness of students on cam­pus. 
"I think everyone should be aware," said Jenista. "It (the environment) should be some­thing that everyone should feel personally responsible to find out about." 
She encourages all students to attend the conference. "Going to a conference like this will really shock a lot of people into understanding how press­ing the issues are." 
"I don't think it's a fad ... the issues are real and they're not going away," Jenista added. 
Anyone interested in attend­ing the conference or joining the Environmental Action Club should contact Jenista.

Among the first scheduled to speak was French President Francois Mitterrand, who dis­patched troops to the gulf after Iraqi soldiers violated French and other diplomatic compounds in Kuwait earlier this month. 
The Iraqi Foreign Ministry Sunday apologized for the Sept. 14 raid. It said its soldiers had not realized they were entering the French ambassador's residence because the house was outside the diplomatic quarter of Kuwait City. Iraq previously had denied the raid took place. 
The first units of a French rapid deployment force arrived in the gulf region Sunday, joining tens of thousands of U.S. troops deployed in the Saudi Arabian desert. 
Secretary of State James Baker said that despite the huge deployment, the United States was still seeking non­military means of forcing Iraq out of Kuwait. 
Baker, interviewed Sunday on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," was asked about the possibility of war. "We have said many times we hoped there won't be," he replied, but added that President Bush was not ruling out any

Meanwhile, a charter flight carrying 112 evacuees from Iraq and Kuwait left London for North Carolina on Sunday. The passengers had left Baghdad a day earlier aboard what the State Department said was the last U.S.­chartered airlift planned from Iraq. 
At the London stopover, the exhausted evacuees told of hardship and terror in Kuwait and Iraq. Western women and children have been allowed to leave, but the Baghdad gov­ernment has kept foreign men captive to serve as human shields at strategic sites.

Motorists were spending an average of 135.44 cents a gal­lon for gasoline on Sept. 7, Lundberg said. 
Fear of war in the Middle East in the wake of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of neighboring Kuwait and a subsequent mili­tary buildup have caused oil prices to fluctuate greatly in recent days, said Lundberg. 
"The fears are that a war could create a serious supply upheaval and that supply re­placement could be difficult," she said. 
Those fears are causing the price of crude to go up and, in turn, pushing up gasoline prices, she said . 
Analysts cited continued fear of war in the Middle East among reasons for the surge in crude oil prices during late futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Friday. 
The price of crude oil for October delivery rose $1.53 a barrel, to $34.71.

Firing of Dallas police chief highlights city's racial woes 
DALLAS (AP) -A black county commissioner's threat that a violent street war would erupt if the city hires a "good old boy" police chief exposed festering racial tensions that some say threaten to tear Dallas apart. 
"The problem in Dallas is not the minority community and the Dallas Police Department," said Pettis Norman, a former Dallas Cowboys football star who is now a successful local businessman. "The problem is the institutionalized racism we have in Dallas." 
As the talk turned last week to who would replace the ousted Mack Vines as police chief, minority activist and County Commissioner John Wiley Price issued a call to arms. He warned that Vines, a white whose policies were praised by minority leaders, had better not be replaced by a "good old boy" -a traditional Southern white. 
If that happened, Price said, 
a violent street war would 
follow in which he and others 
would shoot at police and 
"take this whole city." 

Although shocking, Price's 
words were only the latest of 
several indicators that all is 
far from well in this city of 
nearly 1 million residents, of 
which about a third are black: 
The southern suburbs are 
. threatening to secede amid reports that more tax money is spent in affluent, mostly white North Dallas. 
In 
December, residents go to the polls to vote on a referendum that would eliminate at-large City Council districts, which a judge ruled dilute minority voting strength. 

Last 
month, a Dallas Times Herald survey of 1988 sentencing revealed killers and rapists whose victims were white received harsher punishment than those whose victims were black or

A Dallas Morning News survey in 1988 reported that 44 percent of the city's black population and 44 percent of its white population agree race relations have deteriorated within the past five years. 
"Change must take place now that lessens racial po­larization and bridges the gaps between our people," a task force called Dallas Together concluded last year. The force was formed after a record number of police shootings of citizens, most of them black or Hispanic, in 1988. 
Norman said the racism extends beyond the police department and includes churches that don't denounce racism and a business community that makes it hard for black business people to get loans. 
Israelis debate Arab retaliation 
JERUSALEM (AP) -Israeli Cabinet ministers recommended Sunday that Israelis be allowed to shoot more freely at Arab rock­throwers and retaliate forcefully for the death of a reservist stoned and burned in his car by Palestinians. 
For the fourth day, the army clamped a curfew on the El Bureij refugee camp in the oc­cupied Gaza Strip, where Capt. Amnon Pomeranz was slain Thursday. 
Vengeful Jews stoned cars of Arab laborers leaving for work in Israel Sunday morning, forcing many to turn back, Israel radio said. A 47­year-old Gaza man was hospitalized with head wounds, Arab reports said. 
"This is a murder that cannot be ignored or regarded as statistics," said the right­wing agriculture minister, Rafael Eitan. 
"The  punishment  they  
deserve  is  ...  that  today,  
tonight,  we  need  to  go in  

there, grab 200 local youths and deport them to Lebanon," he said in an interview. 
"No stone should be left standing around the gutted car; the residents should be prevented from going to work or traveling on the roads until they decide if they want war or not. If they do, they will get it," said Eitan. a former army chief of staff. 
Health Minister Ehud Olmert said on Israel radio and television that any civilian or soldier surrounded by Palestinians "must feel he can use his gun and kill those who want to kill him, plain and simple." 
The comments reflected the shock felt in Israel over the killing, which came at a time when many believed the 34­month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands was waning. 
The Palestine Liberation Organization on Sunday called for the escalation of the upris­ing in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to confront "a new Israeli plan to step up the use of fire and gas bombs."

Krushchev critical of Castro in memoirs 
NEW YORK (AP) -Nikita Khrushchev, in memoirs dic­tated in the late 1960s but just now released, called Fidel Castro hotheaded for advocat­ing a nuclear strike against the United States during the Cuban missile crisis. 
Khrushchev, who was ousted from power in the Soviet Union in 1964 and who died in 1971, also thanked Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for helping the Soviet Union develop the atomic bomb. 
Khrushchev made a series of tapes as he lived out his last seven years under virtual house arrest in the village of Petrovo-Dalneye, on the outskirts of Moscow. Many of the tapes were smuggled to the West and two volumes of memoirs, "Khrushchev Remembers" and "Khrushchev Remembers: The Last Testament" were pub­lished in the 1970s. 
But Khrushchev's friends and relatives withheld some of the tapes, fearing that he had been too candid. Last year, Time magazine acquired the tapes. Excerpts were published in the Oct. 1 issue and another book, "Khrushchev Remembers: The Glasnost Tapes," is due out in October from Little, Brown. 
In the memoirs, Khrushchev said Josef Stalin was grateful to the Rosenbergs, who were executed in 1953 after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage by spying on American atom bomb secrets for the Soviet Union. 
Khrushchev said: "I was part of Stalin's circle when he mentioned the Rosenbergs with warmth. I cannot specifically say what kind of help they gave us, but I heard from both Stalin and (Vyacheslav) Molotov, then Minister of Foreign Affairs, that the Rosenbergs provided very significant help in accelerating the production of our atom bomb. 
"Let this be a worthy tribute to the memory of those

people. Let my words serve as an expression of gratitude to those who sacrificed their lives to a great cause of the Soviet state at a time when the U.S. was using its advantage over us to blackmail our state and un­dermine our proletarian cause," he added. 
On the Cuban missile crisis, Khrushchev said the Soviets decided to place missiles in Cuba to deter the United States from an invasion. 
Khrushchev said President Kennedy "understood that in spite of the American advan­tages, the missiles we had al­ready installed could strike New York City, Washington and other centers." 
Then, Khrushchev recalled, intelligence reports indicated that the United States was preparing to strike Cuba and that an invasion was unavoid­able. 
"Castro suggested that to prevent our nuclear missiles from being destroyed, we should launch a pre-emptive strike against the U.S.," he said. "My comrades in the leadership and I realized that our friend Fidel totally failed to understand our purpose. We had installed the missiles not for the purpose of attacking the U.S. but to keep the U.S. from attacking Cuba." 
Khrushchev said Kennedy then sent a message "somewhere between threat and prayer; he both demanded and begged that we remove the missiles. We agreed to remove the rockets and warheads if the president would publicly give assurance, in his own name and that of his allies, that their armed forces would not invade Cuba." 
Kennedy did. 

"Castro was hotheaded. He thought we were retreating ­worse, capitulating. He did not understand that our action was necessary to prevent a military confrontation." Khrushchev said.

City officials unhappy with Census figures 
WASHINGTON (AP) -From the great cities to the small towns, America's municipalities are telling the federal government they can't possibly be as small as census takers say. 
By the thousands, local officials are demanding something be done about the 1990 Census. Even states are contesting the preliminary figures, aware that the more residents they are credited with, the more federal aid they will get and the greater their representation in Congress will be. 

Some voices from the na­tionwide chorus: 
"Unadulterated 
nonsense ... statistical grand larceny," said New York Mayor David N. Dinkins. 

 
"There are errors ev­erywhere," said Detroit re­search director Juliette Okotie-Eboh. 

"It 
really stretches credibility to the breaking point," said Hartford, Conn., Mayor Carrie Saxon Perry. 

"They

Irate New Jersey taxpayers protest governor's record-high tax hike 
THENTON. N.J. (API ­Thousands of New Jersey tax­payers gathered at the StatehousP on Sunday to protest $2.8 billion in tax hikes. 
Protestnrs focused their anger on Gov. Jim Florio ­hanging his likeness in effigy, hawking $2 posters of Florio disguist~d as Adolf Hitler and singing anti-Florin songs. 
The eVfmt was organized by Hands Across New Jersey, the group leading a stah~wide tax revolt. 
"Wn need accountability in govt~rnment and criminal proseeution for those who rip us ofT," said John Budzash, a Howell mailman and Hands Across New Jersey co-founder. "I>o we have efficient spending in government? No." 
State Police Sgt. Peter Hinkle said that the 4 1/2 hour rally peaked at about 4,000 
Washington Post defends reporter arrested while interviewing youths for curfew story 
WASHINGTON (API -The managing editor of The Washington Post says a staff reporter broke no law when hn was arrested for allllgedly contributing to the delinquency of a minor while working on a story for the newspaper and called the police action "unwarranted." 
"Based on the information we have, the arrest of a Washington Post reporter while he is reporting a story and breaking no law himself appears unwarranted to us," said Leonard Downie, Jr., Managing Editor of the Post. 
''I'm particularly concerned that the police pursued this people. Budzash disputed the police estimate, saying at least 10,000 attended the event. A similar rally in July drew about 6,000. 
The $2.8 billion tax hike, the largest in state history, was passed by the Democrat-con­trolled Legislature less than seven months after Florio took office. The governor is a Democrat. 
"Politicians will not budge until you make yourself heard," said Ken Chiampou, a talk show host on WKXW-FM, a Trenton-area radio station which publicized the anti-tax movement. "This is about get­ting pqliticians to respond to the people." 
The $2.8 billion tax package is designed to close a budget gap of more than $1 billion, provide $1.1 billion in new state aid to public schools and ease some property taxes. The 
after the reporter identified himself and his purpose and that the police took his notes," Downie said. 
Michael J. Ybarra, 23, a re­porter with the Post's Metro staff was arrested late Friday while working on a report about a new curfew for minors in Quantico, Va. 
Ybarra's supervisors said the reporter was not available for comment concerning the incident. 
Ybarra was taken into cus­tody and his notes confiscated while conducting an interview of two 12-year-old boys in a restaurant in the Virginia town about 30 miles south of state's income tax will be in­creased for those in the top 17 percent of the tax bracket. 
Florio also raised the state's sales tax from 6 percent to 7 percent. The sales tax also was expanded to include some previously exempt items such as alcohol, cigarettes, telephone bills, soap and disposable paper products. 
Budzash said his group is seeking four goals: the repeal of the tax increases, the right to recall the governor and legislators, the right to use initiative and referendum to make laws, and a more efficient state-government. 
Florio declined an invitation to attend the rally, instead speaking to supporters at Trenton State College. Florio spokesman Jon Shure said the governor "remained convinced that what he did was right." 
the nation's capital. 
The Quantico Town Council recently imposed a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew for youths under age 18 following recent vandalism in the area. 
Ybarra is the second adult charged in connection with a curfew violation, but no youths have been arrested. 
"I believe that the reporter was trying to do his job and just got mixed up at the wrong place and the wrong time," said Leo Rodriguez, Quantico Police Chief. 
Rodriguez said the reporter's notes were held as evidence but a copy would be made available to the Post. 
page 7 Comment shows Japan's prejudices 
TOKYO (AP) -A Japanese Cabinet minister's offhand suggestion that American blacks ruin white neighborhoods reflects the deep prejudices and provin­cialism that still hinder Japan's much-touted interna­tionalism, analysts say. 
Justice Minister Seiroku Kajiyama's public comments Friday, in which he compared blacks to prostitutes, were the latest to aggravate relations between Japanese politicians and U.S. minorities. Blacks also have heard themselves belittled in recent years as illiterate and financially ir­responsible. 
Each incident has drawn howls of U.S. protest. Yet such comments keep cropping up because Japan, for all its export savvy and love of Western goods, remains in many ways as isolated from Western thinking as it has for most of its long history, observers say. 
"Japan is a society of funda­mental discrimination against other ethnic and racial groups," said Patricia Steinhoff, former head of the University of Hawaii's Center for Japanese Studies. 
"Japanese politicians used to be able to get away with this kind of thing, but now all of a sudden they can't" because of adverse publicity, she said. "I don't really think they know where to draw the line." 
At a news conference fol­lowing a police roundup of foreign prostitutes in Tokyo, Kajiyama commented Friday that such prostitutes "ruin the atmosphere" of neighborhoods when they arrive. 
"It's like in America when neighborhoods become mixed because blacks move in, and whites are forced out," said the newly appointed minister, who previously held two other key Cabinet posts, including head of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
Shortly afterward, the Justice Ministry issued a statement from Kajiyama, who said he meant to convey that people living in that district of Tokyo feel insecure. 
It said the 64-year-old minister's comments con­tained "expressions that may cause misunderstanding." But it did not offer an explicit apology. 
Ralph Neas, executive direc­tor of the Leadership Conference on Civil Bights in Washington, ealled Kajiyama's co~m~nts "reprehensible and 
racist. 
Japanese analysts say racism here often reflects the nation's pride in its own supposed racial purity. In 1985, for example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a report attributing Japan's economic successes to its racial homogeneity. 
"Japanese are continuously being reminded of the unique­ness of their culture ... by their teachers, newspapers and TV programs," Dutch author Karel Van Wolferen wrote in a much-discussed recent book, "The Enigma of Japanese Power." 
Even Japanese who have been partially educated abroad "are actively dis­criminated against and are often the object of teasing and class bullying" when they return, Van Wolferen said. "They are invariably made to feel they are contaminated." 
Black athletes and enter­tainers are popular on Japanese television, along with others who seem to satisfy an everlasting hunger here for things Western. And officially, the government continues its policy of "intern a tionalization" urging companies to hire more foreigners. 
But in Japanese eyes, for­eigners always remain "gaijin"-"outside people."

Voters may be lying to pollsters, recent primary surprises indicate 
BOSTON (AP) -Democrat John Silber's unexpected vic­tory in the Massachusetts gu­bernatorial primary is renew­ing questions about whether voters lie to pollsters. 
The same questions followed the careers of Barry Goldwater and George Wallace, whose support was understated in some polls. 
Silber, on leave as president of Boston University, defeated former Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti by a com­fortable 9-point margin, win­ning 53 percent of the vote in Tuesday's Democratic primary. 
Polls published just before the election showed Bellotti ahead and "surging." One poll gave Bellotti a lead of 50 percent to 39 percent. An election-eve survey showed Bellotti leading 49 percent to 35 percent. 
Gerry Chervinsky, whose polls at KRC Communications Research in Cambridge showed Bellotti in the lead close to the primary, believes some poll respondents hid their support for Silber. 
They liked Silber's combative style and confrontational rhetoric, but weren't willing to admit it, he believes. 
"I don't think there's any question at all that voters were not forthcoming about voting for Silber," Chervinsky said. "It was socially unacceptable to say, it was impolite to say, 'I'm voting for Silber.'" 
Other factors also con­tributed to the polling problem, such as the difficulties of predicting turnout in a primary and of determining whether in­dependent voters will take a Democratic or Republican bal­lot, Chervinsky said. 
But Silber, in a television in­terview Sunday, said his and election results elsewhere in the nation reflected a growing "anti-media sentiment." 
On ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley's' program he said he believed one of the polls was "slanted in the sample that it took." 
Silber had warned weeks before the primary that some pollsters would be "looking for work" after Sept. 18 because they were missing his support­ers. He speculated that his backers viewed questions from pollsters as "an invasion of privacy." 
The polls were off only in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. Other Massachusetts races, some of them close and volatile, were predicted accu­rately. 
Exit polls indicated as many as 20 percent of the voters made up their minds in the last days of the campaign and went overwhelmingly for Silber. But Chervinsky said voters who concealed their support for Silber could have skewed polls by as much as 10 points. 
Experts differ on whether voters willfully mislead poll­sters. 
"If I believed that people lied in the telephone interview process I'd have to get out of the polling business and get a broom," said John Becker of the Sudbury-based Becker Institute Inc., which conducted some early polls. "It's all speculation. No one ever produces any evidence that people lie." 
University of Virginia politi­cal scientist Larry Sabato says lying "is more of a pollster's excuse than a reality."

The Observer is the independent newspaper published by the students of the University of Notre Dame du Lac and Saint Mary's College. It does not necessarily reflect the policies of the administration of either institution. The news is reported as accurately and objectively as possible. Unsigned editorials represent the opinion of the majority of the Editor-in-Chief, Managing Editor, News Editor, Viewpoint Editor, Accent Editor, Photo Editor, and Saint Mary's Editor. Commentaries, letters and Inside Column present the views of the authors. Column space is available to all members of the community and the free expression of varying opinions on campus through letters, is encouraged. 
Ticket distribution not fair to students 
Tickets to last weekend's Michigan State football game were advertised and distributed in an unfair, inconsistent and arbitrary manner. 
In a September 18 Observer ad, the Student Union Board instructed interested MSU spectators to "bring Student ID" with them when receiving their lottery numbers. The ad, however, did not specify that students could only get lottery numbers with Notre Dame student IDs. Since The Observer serves both the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's communities, SUB should not have assumed the only "students" who read the student newspaper are those who attend Notre Dame. As a result of SUB's ambiguous ad, several Saint Mary's students waited for lottery numbers--along with their Notre Dame peers--only to be turned away at the head of the line. 
In addition to the advertisement, itself, being misleading, the policy behind the ad was blatantly inconsistent. As both Saint Mary's and Notre Dame students are granted equal access to student tickets for all home football games, the ticket office's failure to abide by a similar standard for away games is contradictory. 
Furthermore, when the ticket office learned that an additional 150 MSU tickets were available, a representative from the office asked The Observer to publish a notice relaying the surplus in the following day's paper. Because the tickets went on sale at 9 a.m. the following morning, however, and most students read The Observer at lunch, individuals who were aware of the sale before the newspaper was distributed on Thursday were given an unfair advantage to get tickets. By the time most students learned of the surplus, the ticket office was already sold out. 
To avoid this dilemma, the ticket office logically should have postponed the ticket sale to mid-afternoon, giving all students an equal opportunity to learn about the surplus and take advantage of the sale. 
All students deserve an equal shot at acquiring tickets to away football games--particularly when demand exceeds supply and fair distribution is well within the University's reach. Publishing ambiguous advertisements and releasing privileged information about the sale of extra tickets to only a select group is unfair and undermines the credibility of both the Student Union Board and the ticket office. 
A commitment to integrity is imperative in Persian Gulf 

By Michael Masone 
In a joint session of Congress on the Persian Gulf crisis last Tuesday night, President Bush declared that, "America and the world will not be blackmailed" by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. "Vital issues of principle are at stake," Bush said, "and America will not be intimidated." Such a firm stance is precisely what Hussein's recent aggression calls for; in fact, Bush has promised that the United States will not recall its forces from the Gulf until Iraq has pulled its own out of Kuwait. But the stark reality is that this theory is being put into practice at the risk of thousands of young lives, and it compels one to ask: At what price is the U.S. willing to get what it wants? 
To a generation too young to remember the horrors of Vietnam, the thought of full­fledged war involving conventional weapons appears unfathomable. Today's college students have been raised on a sort of false arrogance about the dominance of the United States and its military forces. But rest assured, a war with Iraq, which appears to be more of a reality everyday, would not be won easily. To begin with, our military buildup-the largest in any one place since 
Vietnam-still  leaves  us  
outnumbered  in  both  
manpower  and  equipment,  

such as the armored vehicles which are imperative for desert warfare. The U.S. has always relied on superior technology as its military advantage; however, it is a fact that warfare in desert conditions creates difficulties with the high-tech our tanks. As a result, U.S. troops would be forced to go outside their tanks in the heat of battle in order to clear out sand which would cause malfunctions. Our soldiers, most of whom have never seen actual combat, are fighting on our opponent's own terrain against rivals who would benefit from eight years of intense battle experience from Iraq's war with Iran. In essence, our troops, who do not subscribe to the same union of religion and country that their adversaries do, are fighting against individuals who are not afraid to die. 

Naturally, most hope that a diplomatic solution will be found. Unfortunately, however, rational thinking is not one of Hussein's trademarks, and the man who has been described as no more than a "ninth-century barbarian" will not withdraw his forces from Kuwait unless he is forced out. Our troop face an enemy whose leader has not hesitated to use chemical weapons, an act forbidden in the world's military community, on his own people. As a result, our fighting men would be forced to don burdensome protective gear which hinders movement in battle and causes excessive perspiration in the sun. Bush has called the Iraqis "isolated" and has said that this crisis is a "struggle between Iraq and the world." But while the U.S. does enjoy the verbal support of nearly the entire world, no nation capable of offering substantial manpower assistance has done so, and other U.S. officials have been forced to plead for financial assistance from economic su­perpowers Germany and Japan. 
What it comes down to is a crazed Arab dictator who will not be moved back and the most influential leader in the world who stands firm in opposition. My aim is not to predict a victor as one would in a prizefight. But before we become content to accept the policies of one man, let us at least understand what will be the consequences of our actions. Let's not be fooled into becoming glassy-eyed, flag­waving American supporters, so sure of predominance in world affairs. A commitment to integrity is necessary in this situation; unfortunately, however, firm stances are much more easily taken in plush offices that on a desert plain by men and women no older than we here at Notre Dame. 
Michael Masone is in the Freshman Year ofStudies.

In 1890, Price Waterhouse opened its first U.S. office. Already recognized overseas for innovative account­ing and business services, our goal was to introduce these new strategies to the American market. The response was phenomenal. Before long, we were one of the nation's most respected and fastest-growing firms. Today, we face a new century -not only as a respected worldwide public accounting firm, but also as a premier consulting firm offering the full range of quality technical and business services. 
The Office of Government Services (OGS) in Washington, D.C. is a vital part of our nationwide information systems consulting practice. Our clients include Federal, state, and local civilian government agencies, as well as select private sector clients. Our engagements typically involve the development of financial, human resource, and manufacturing man­agement information systems and information sys­tems auditing. While the majority of our staff members are based in the Washington, D.C. area, our engagements are nationwide; subsequently, all staff must be willing to travel. Wherever and whatever your initial assignment may be, be assured you will be designing and implementing systems using such powerful tools and technologies as:

DB2, Oracle, UNIX or C 

 
Structured Methodologies

NEW YORK -Tom Bolton, starting instead of Roger Clemens, lasted only 1 1-3 in­nings Sunday as New York beat Boston 5-4 to send the Red Sox to their eighth loss in 10 games and drop them out of first place in the American League East.

The biggest decliners this UCLA 7, Georgia Tech 5, Mississippi 4,week were the Trojans (5th to Fresno State 3, Texas 3, Alabama 2, 13th) and Colorado, which fell Penn State 2, Stanford 2, Toledo 1, from 14th to 19th despite its Iowa 1.  Luck continued from page 20 two-yard line Saturday against Michigan State. Jarrell's catch set up the winning touchdown with 1:30 left in the game. An unscientific sampling of Irish players who had a part in the victory drives of the past two weeks reveals that the team believes that luck has been an integral part of these victories. "I thought it was over," Mirer said of the pass which bounced off Murray's chest. "I thought, 'Man, there's no way I should have done that.' but we got for­tunate, or lucky, or whatever you want to call it and Adrian was right there to make the catch." Jarrell, who also caught the winning touchdown pass against Michigan a week ago, subscribes to the Divine Inter­vention theory. "There's definitely someone looking over us," Jarrell said. "It makes you wonder." Senior quad-captain Ricky Watters downplayed the impor­tance of luck in the victories. "I don't like to think about luck. I like to win going out. I think it's more like we're putting ourselves in a position to win," Watters said. "It's when everyone is running their patterns right and we have great concentration out of our receivers that we get a great play like that. "On the deflection, you couJD  say that was luck, but then he caught it, he had the concentra­tion to catch it. Same thing last week-Lake Dawson had the concentration to watch the ball into his hands after the deflec­tion off Rocket (Ismail). I guess you could say it's luck, but the players are putting themselves into a position to do it." Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz admits that the Irish have been lucky, but agrees with Watters when he says that Notre Dame players help make their own luck. "There's no doubt we were lucky in some respects, but with some people it would have hit the guy's chest and been an in­completion. One thing a Notre Dame player did do was go to the ball. That's one thing that they're taught. That's twice that we have done it. Yeah, we're lucky, but I also think we played well in some areas," Holtz said. Holtz does think that Notre Dame has a certain mystique. These past two games appear to have reinforced that belief. "I really and truly believe it," Holtz said. "I believe there's a special thing about Notre Dame, I really do. Is it true? I can't say. All I can say is that I believe it." It seems that Holtz has con­vinced his players to believe it, too. And as long as they are re­solved to preserve that mys­tique, the Irish will be tough to beat regardless of whether they are good, lucky, or blessed by God.

Improved defense holds MSU to 117 yards rushing 
Hawkins' seven catches a problem for NO, Lyght missed in secondary and on punting team 
By GREG GUFFEY and KEN TVSIAC Sports Writers 
EAST LANSING, Mich.­Notre Dame outside linebacker Scott Kowalkowski said he noticed an overall improvement In the Irish defense. Nose guard Chris Zorich said he thought the defense improved about 70 percent. 
But both agreed that the de­fense is still not where it should be. 
"We want to totally dominate an offense and a game," Kowalkowski said. "We're not to that point yet, but we will be." 
Michigan State gained 117 yards on the ground, but 32 of those were on a cutback by Hyland Hickson in the second quarter. Michigan gained 253 
' 

yards on the ground last week. 
"Other than a couple of cut­backs, we played the run pretty well," Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz said. 
Said Kowalkowski, "We shut them down for the most part. We were much improved over last week. Overall, I thought in our attitude and fundamentals, we made great strides. We're still not where we want to be." 
Zorich recorded 11 total tackles, including one sack for a loss of six yards. 
"I think we made about a 70 percent improvement compared to last week," Zorich said. "I think it's coming along." 
It was obvious that Notre Dame missed All-American cornerback Todd Lyght in the secondary. Freshman Greg Lane, who replaced Lyght, had a hard time covering Michigan

State star Courtney Hawkins, 
who caught seven passes for 94 
yards. 
Lyght's absence was less ob­
vious, but just as critical, to the 
punting team. Michigan State 
almost got to punter Craig 
Hentrich early in the second 
quarter, and then managed to 
block a kick through the end­
zone for a safety with 8:13 re­
maining in the first half. 
"We lost Todd Lyght in the kicking game and had to make a few changes, and we had a missed call," Irish coach Lou Holtz said. "On the one before we had one guy miss (a block) and we corrected him, and the next play another guy thought, 'Well, gee, I must have been wrong,' and we ended up with a blocked kick and those things are disastrous." 
Lyght made the trip to East 
Lansing but did not dress for 
the game. 
Irish quarterback Rick Mirer is making a name for himself as a clutch player. For the sec­ond straight week he completed five of six passes on a late fourth-quarter touchdown drive. Mirer says his teammates help him keep his cool down the stretch. 
"I think what sticks out is the senior leadership. The guys who have been through it all before don't get uptight and don't get nervous. They just

say, We've done it before and 
we'll do it again, that's part of 
our job,' " Mirer said. "We have 
guys like Ricky Watters and 
Tony Brooks who have been 
through this before and they 
carried us through again." 

Senior quad-captain Ricky Watters explains that the se­niors have to keep their emo­tions under control. 
"What a senior has to do is just keep everyone calm," says Watters. "We have to have a lot of enthusiasm, but we can't be all radical and everything. The seniors are the ones who have to say, 'Hey, relax, everything's cool, we're just going to do like we always do.' We feel like we're the champs, and we just have to play like that." 
Michigan State coach George Perles lived up to his promise that he would keep kickoffs away from Raghib Ismail. 
Ismail was back deep for four kickoffs but fielded only one. He picked that one up on the bounce and returned it 12 yards. 
"It doesn't bother me at all," Ismail said. "You expect it now." 
Ismail returned two punts for 30 yards. 
Perfection usually comes with practice. The success of Notre Dame's late drives must be at-

The Spartans had one last chance with 34 seconds remain­ing, but could not put anything together. 
"There were a lot of breaks in the game," Michigan State coach George Perles said. "Some went with us and some went against us. Obviously, we think we can play with anyone

Saturday Stonebreaker sacked Enos once and had eight tack­les and one interception as well. The Irish senior last faced the Spartans two years ago in East Lansing.

"We came out strong but then we died down a little bit in the second quarter," Mirer said. 
Michigan State got on the board early in the second quar­ter when John Langeloh con­nected on a 43-yard field goal shortly after a Tom Carter in­terception was called back be­cause of a roughing the passer call against the Irish. The Spartans added a safety on the next series when Murray blocked a Craig Hentrich punt into the endzone. 
Michigan State made it seven points in less than 10 minutes after receiving the free kick from Notre Dame. The big play was a 32-yard run by Hyland Hickson to the one-yard line. Hickson, who finished the day with 63 yards rushing, scored the touchdown three plays later. 
The Spartans tallied their fi­nal score on their only posses­sion of the third quarter, an 88­yard drive on 12 plays. Enos did the damage in this series, completing four of five passes for 75 yards, a third of his total 196 yards passing. Tico Duckett scored the touchdown on a one-yard run.

Bengals, Giants and Bears win 
Montana leads San Francisco over Atlanta 19-13 
(AP) -The Bengals, Giants and Bears remained unbeaten in. varying fashions on Sunday. Cincinnati used quick-striking offense, New York did it with overpowering defense and Chicago won with special teams. 
The 49ers and Los Angeles Raiders also won their third straight games, San Francisco doing it on the wing of Joe Montana, naturally, while the Raiders continued their hot play at home under Art Shell. 
Montana threw for 398 yards and two scores in a 19-13 victory over Atlanta. Roger Craig tied Walter Payton's record for career receptions by a running back and Dave Waymer intercepted two passes. 
The Raiders, now 8-0 under Shell in games at the LA Coliseum, got TDs from Marcus Allen and Mervyn Fernandez 
2:31 apart in the fourth quarter in a 20-3 win over punchless Pittsburgh. 
The Bengals and Giants cruised over New England and Miami, respectively. The Bears, however, got a big break and converted it into Kevin Butler's 52-yard field goal with four seconds remaining for a 19-16 victory over Minnesota. 
Vikings punter Harry Newsome fumbled a snap with 25 seconds left. The Bears recovered on the Minnesota 39, failed to make a first down, and Butler kicked his fourth field goal of the game. 
With just 1:55 remaining, the Vikings (1-2) tied it on a 17­yard pass from Wade Wilson to Hassan Jones. 
"It ranks right up there," Butler said of his game­winning kick. "Any kick that wins a game ranks right up there." 
The Bengals grabbed a 31-0 lead on the way to a 41-7 rout of New England, which fell apart with four fumbles, two interceptions, two blown coverages on defense, a botched punt and an end zone interception nullified by a holding penalty. Cincinnati's Jim Breech hit a 46-yard field goal in the first period that gave him a league-record 152 consecutive games with a score, surpassing the NFL mark set by Fred Cox of Minnesota. 
"I was glad to get it out of the way early," Breech said. "When l saw it fly through l said, 'Yeah!' It got that over, and it got us off to a quick start." 
The Giants completely shackled Miami's offense, which managed only 39 yards rushing. Dan Marino had a mere 115 yards passing and New York kept the ball for 40 minutes, 18 seconds in a 20-3 win. Ottis Anderson scored on a pair of 1-yard runs as he became the NFL's No. 8 all-time rusher with 9,433 yards, moving ahead of Earl Campbell. 
In other games, it was Philadelphia 27, the Los Angeles Rams 21; Denver 34, Seattle 31 in overtime; Washington 19, Dallas 15; Houston 24, Indianapolis 10; Kansas City 17, Green Bay 3; New Orleans 28, Phoenix 7; San Diego 24, Cleveland 14; and Tampa Bay 23, Detroit 20. 
Buffalo visits the New York Jets on Monday night. 
49ers 19, Falcons 13 
At San Francisco, the defending champions didn't get many points, even though Montana was on fire. He made 24 of 36 throws, hitting Jerry Rice for a 35-yard score and Brent Jones for 67 yards. Jones carried Deion Sanders on his back the last 10 yards. 
Craig tied Payton's record of 492 catches with a second­quarter reception that lost two yards. 
Raiders 20, Steelers 3 
As Pittsburgh's attack continued to sputter -the Steelers have not scored an offensive touchdown this season -the Raiders kept up the defensive pressure. They have yielded only 25 points so far and had six sacks of Bubby Brister. 
Allen scored on a 1-yard run with 11:03 remaining and Fernandez caught a 66-yard TD pass from Jay Schroeder with 
8:32 left for only the third and fourth touchdowns by the Raiders' offense this season. Fernandez had five receptions for 130 yards. 
Bears 19, Vikings 16 
At Chicago, Butler had field goals of 23, 51 and 32 yards before his winning kick, while Donald Igwebuike connected on three kicks for Minnesota. 
Neal Anderson had an 8-yard touchdown run in the first half and the Bears controlled the ball with 17 straight running plays at one point in the second half. But Wilson completed five passes on an 80-yard drive to the tying touchdown. 
Then came Newsome's bobble. 
"I let down 4 7 guys, I let down the coaches," Newsome said. "I just wonder why it happened. I always considered myself to have good hands. I practice that 30 to 40 times a day. Now, it will stick in my mind the rest of my life. It was a wobbly snap and it went through my hands." 
Bengals 41, Patriots 7 
At Cincinnati, Rodney Holman scored two touchdowns, one on a shovel pass from holder Lee Johnson on a fake field goal, and the Bengals held New England to 34 yards rushing. Boomer Esiason had two TD passes, but none to Tim McGee, who still managed six catches for 163 yards. 
Marc Wilson, starting in place of the injured Steve Grogan, had his first pass intercepted and things never got any better for the Patriots (1-2). 
Giants 20, Dolphins 3 
The first meeting between the Giants and Dolphins since 1972 -and only the second ever ­was a disaster for Miami. The Dolphins got into New York territory only once and their running game, ranked second in the league, was invisible. Sammie Smith, whose 215 yards rushing led the league, went for nine on five carries. 
"This was the first big game we've played in a while," said Dolphins coach Don Shula, whose team was trying to start a season 3-0 for the first time since 1984. 
Eagles 27, Rams 21 
At Anaheim, the Eagles finally got going after two losses. Randall Cunningham threw for two touchdowns and Andrew Toney ran for 103 yards in a matchup of last year's NFC wild card teams. 
The weak running game was bolstered by Toney, who became the first Eagle since 1987 to rush for 100 yards. Tight end Keith Jackson caught four passes for 77 yards just four days after ending a 50-day holdout and Cunningham had scoring throws to Calvin Williams and Robert Drummond. 
Broncos 34, Seahawks 31 
At Denver, John Elway and David Treadwell reworked their magic six days after rallying the Broncos over Kansas City in the final moments. 
This time, they needed to go into an extra period. Elway completed three passes and Bobby Humphrey ran 26 yards on a draw play, setting up Treadwell's 25-yard winning field goal. 
Redskins 19, Cowboys 15 
The Cowboys couldn't duplicate their last two trips to Washington, when they won. Chip Lohmiller kicked four field goals, one from 55 yards, and Darrell Green ran an interception back for a touchdown.

Notre Dame pulls off second comeback miracle 
Jarrell grabs deflected pass to set-up Culver's touchdown as Irish beat Michigan State 20-19

The Observer/Patrick Kusek Rod Culver barrels past Spartan linebackers Dixon Edwards during Saturday's game against Michigan State. Culver had 39 yards rushing and scored the game-winning touchdown. 
ND is more than lucky in two late-game victories 
EAST LANSING, Mich.-For the sec­ond straight week a tipped pass was a 
pivotal play in a nailbiter of a Notre Dame football victory. Is ·the hand of God steering these key passes into the hands of Notre Dame receivers? Are the Irish just lucky? Or is this just another case of a team making its own breaks? 

We will never know the answer to that first question. We do know that Ken Tysiac theologians generally frown on the Associate Sports Editor 
concept of Divine Intervention in Football Games, but we cannot be cer­tain in this life whether God really made Notre Dame number one the past two weeks. 
But how much of a part does luck play? 
In last week's game against Michigan, freshman receiver Lake Dawson plucked a Rick Mirer pass out of the air for a 45-yard gain on a key third-down play late in the third quarter. Normally, that would not seem unusual. But that pass had already bounced off the hands of Irish flanker Raghib Ismail, the intended receiver. 
As if that wasn't enough, sophomore Adrian Jarrell caught a Mirer pass which caromed off the chest of Spartan cornerback Todd Murray for a 34-yard gain down to the

EAST LANSING, Mich. ­Another weekend, another miracle for the Notre Dame football team. 
The top-ranked Irish over­came a 19-7 fourth-quarter deficit Saturday to defeat Michigan State 20-19 before 80,401 fans in Spartan Stadium, the largest crowd ever to watch a MSU game. 
Notre Dame turned in a near repeat performance of last weekend's 28-24 victory over Michigan in improving to 2-0, while Michigan State fell to 0-1­1. 
"We just have to find a way to win each and every week," Irish coach Lou Holtz said. "It looked bleak. Once again, we were down by two scores late in the football game but we found a way to win." 
Rodney Culver scored the game-winning touchdown on a one-yard run with just under one-minute remaining in the game, but it was an improbable deflection that put the Irish in position to get the victory. 

On second-and-five from the Michigan State 36, Notre Dame quarterback Rick Mirer threw a bullet near the right front corner of the endzone. The ball bounced off the numbers of Spartan cornerback Todd Murray and into the hands of Irish receiver Adrian Jarrell, who went out of bounds at the two-yard line. Culver scored three plays later. 
"I was ready to make the tackle," said Jarrell, who caught the winning touchdown pass against Michigan. "It just hit him in the chest and I caught it. I was in the right place at the right time and I just stayed in bounds." 
Said Mirer, "As soon as I let go of it, I saw the defender. I hadn't seen him coming. Adrian was right there again, making another great play. We were just trying to make something happen. I thought I was going to have to play defense for a second." 
The Irish made little happen until late in the third quarter when Mirer orchestrated a 16­play, 66-yard drive that ended when tailback Rick Watters ran two yards for the touchdown. That pulled the Irish within six at 19-13. 
The Spartans retaliated quickly, moving into Notre Dame territory on just four plays. But on second and 16 from the 39, Irish linebacker Michael Stonebreaker inter­cepted a Dan Enos pass at the Notre Dame 26 and returned it 23 yards. That was Stonebreaker's second inter­ception in as many games. 
After the teams traded punts, Notre Dame took over for its final drive with 5:15 left in the game on its own 19. Mirer opened with a 19-yard pass to Derek Brown, but then offen­sive holding negated a 12-yard run by Tony Brooks.

Dilucia beats Coleman in finals

The return of All-American David DiLucia to the N()tre Dame men's tennis team brought a surge of confidence that helped the Irish dominate this weekend at the Tom Fallon Invitational. 
Rainy conditions forced the tournament inside to the Eck Pavilion ·and South Bend Racquet Club, which hurt some teams but allowed Irish team­mates DiLucia and Chuck Cole­man to reach the A Flight sin­gles final, which DiLucia won 6-2, 6-4. The two also paired up to take the A Flight doubles championship, 6-3, 7-5 over a Ball State duo that beat the Notre Dame team of Ryan. Wenger and Paul Anthony in the semi-finals. 
The Sunday night singles matchup was tough for both, who had played eight previous matches over the course of the tournament. DiLucia, after an All-America performance last season, is on the pace for an even better showing this year. 

"DiLucia played extremely well," said coach Bob Bayliss. "He's playing at a level above where he was last year. He just mixed in high loops and short chips, and ran everything down. 
Coleman reached the finals by beating two of the best players in the tournament. An impressive 6-3, 6-2 win over West Virginia's Patrick Westoo, the singles champion at last week's Navy Tournament, was only the start for Coleman. He went on to an even more impressive 6-1, 6-2 semi-final victory against Michigan's Dan Brakus before facing DiLucia in the finals. 
Neither player admired the task of facing a teammate to determine the winner, however. 
"We play each other so much in practice and we know what to expect from each other," said DiLucia, who played much of the tournament with a broken toenail. "After playing so many matches this weekend, it was kind of hard to get motivated for a Sunday night final, but I think we brought out the best in each other." 
Coleman, able to play with the help of a stellar performance by the Irish trainers, was pleased with the overall team effort that was lacking last week. 
"The Navy tournament woke us up and made us realize how bad we could actually play," said Coleman. "It was great to come back from last week and make it to the finals, but play­ing Dave was a tough situation to be in." 
After an opening tournament last week on the road, the young Irish squad relished the chance to compete on its own courts. 
"I was really nervous at the Navy tournament and just wasn't able to play my type of game," said freshman Tommy
