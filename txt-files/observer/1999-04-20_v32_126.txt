Native American powwow draws members from 30 nations 
IOWA CITY. Iowa 

With a jingle and a jump, partici­pants at the annual University or Iowa Powwow presented their lwr­itage through dance. 
The powwow. which startod ou April 16 and lasted through Sunday, hosted American Indian cultures from around the country. American Indian vendors lined tlw· uppor love! of Carver-Hawkeye Arena with a unique bhrnd of urt, costumes, jewel­ry and decorations from nearly 30 different nations. 
The arena's basketball court wcl­comed hundreds of' dancers, who competed in categories broken down by grmder and age. 
"I've been doing this for more than 30 years." said Annamae Pushetuncqu,a, a member of the Lakota nation, a branch of Sioux, who is originally from South Dakota's Hosebud Reservation.

Program corrects Title IX violations 
MADISON, Wisc. 

In what some charactr,rized as a last-ditch effort to force the University of Wisconsin-Madison Athletics Department to prioritize gender equity and comply with Title IX, the Athletic Board Friday gave the department admin·istration one week to devise a plan that eliminates inequity between office space for men's and women's sports. Tho Planning and Equity Committee released an annual status report Friday on the 13-point equity program, which was designed to bring UW-Madison in line with federal anti­discrimination law known as Title IX. The report said the department has already met or will soon meet 10 of the 13 points, but a resolution to the equal-office-space issue is nowhere in the near future. Committen Chair Dennis Dresang's surprise motion passed at Friday's meeting by an overwhelming margin after intense and relativnly argumentative discussion.

NEW HAVEi\, Conn. 

The New Haven Police Department posted new flyers on 
campus Sunday which offer $50,000 l'or inltmnation leading 
to the arrest and conviction of the person or people respon­
sible for the murder of senior Suzanne Jovin. The flyers, 
which featured a never-before-published picture of Jovin, 
were staplnd to trees on both sides of' College Street slmtch­
ing from Phelps Gate to Trumbull Street and all throughout 
Old Campu-s. University Secretary Linda Lorimer said the 
intent of the police was to "try and have anyone, particularly 
those who may have been in the vicinity of Elm and Collegn, 
call the police nven if they don't expn<'.t their recollections to 
be valuable." Police wrote on the flyer that .Jovin's murder 
occurred on friday, Dec. 4 at 9:45 p.m. Jovin was last seen 
that night around 9:30 p.m. The flyer directs anyone with 
information to call the New Ilavnn Police Dcparlmenl's

The U.S. Navy controls about 7 5 percent of Vieques for mili­tary mancuvers and weapons storage. The island is 21 miles long and four miles wide, locat­ed about eight miles f1ast ol' Puerto Hico.

Despite continuing defiance by Yugoslav President Slohodan Milosevic and his military forces in Kosovo, NATO's chief spokesman expressed confidence the allia11<;c's strategy will pay off. 
"Since when was a dictator defr.ated in 24 hours?" Jamie Shea said at the N/\TO briefing in Brussels, Belgium. "It took six years to defeat fascism in the middlr. of Europe in the 20th century. I think w11 can take two or three months to cir.feat President Milosevic." 
The bombings aim to force Milosevic to accept a peace plan for Kosovo, a province in Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.

Another Man Waits for Justice on Death Row 
I've got a small cross on my wall. It's made of wood from near Jesus's tomb. Below it, an eye-catching poster with a man in dreadlocks reads, "On August 17 they will execute Mumia unless ... •· 
Aaron Kreider 

Mumia Abu-Jamal began his FBI file at age 15 for protesting against racist pres­idential candidate George Wallace. As a teenager, he wrote for the local Black Panther Party newspaper. He continued writing about police brutality, covering issues like the Philadelphia police's May 13, 1985 attack (tear gas, 10,000 rounds of ammunition, and eventual fire-bomb­ing) of a house of MOVE, a revolutionary and spiritual organization that the police persecuted, which killed 11 people !including five children) and burned down a row of 60 houses. Mumia strong­ly syrnpalhized with MOVE. 
In the earlv hours of Dec. 9, 1981, Mumia was driving a taxi and came upon police oflicer Daniel Faulkner beat­ing his brother with a flashlight. What happened rrnxt is open to question, but Mumia was wounded and Faulkner killed. Mumia was convicted of killing him and has lived on deathrow for 17 vears. 
• However., many people have strong doubts as to whether Mumia is guilty. llere am some reasons why. Eleven of tlw 12 jurors were white (Philly is NOT 92 p1m:ent white). Possible non-white jurors were struck by the prosecution ber,ause of their race. Judge Albert Sabo has slmtenced over :~o 1wople to death, more than any other judge, and all but two were people of color. Judge Sabo is a life-Jong member of the Fraternal Order of Police which is actively cam­paigning to execute Mumia. Mumia had a bad public defender who has since been disbarred. Several eyewitnesses saw a different man shoot Faulkner and run away, The ballistics evidence is very controversial. Mumia's involvement with the Black Panther Party was used to con­vict him -he was painted as a "cop­killer" in court. So some radicals think he deserves a retrial. 
Four years ago l joined the Vancouver Coalition to Save Mumia. I worked with members of the Canadian Communist Party, International Socialist Organization {ISO), Spartacists, Third World Alliance (a student grqup) and various independent socialists who had coalesced to save Mumia's life. 
We met at a local communi­ty college. Governor Tom Hidge had just signed a death warrant, and the state was scheduled to execute Mumia on August 17, 1995. During a little over a month of activism, I grew to respect the communists, ISOers and other people in the group for their complete dedication to the cause. Quite often it is only the radicals who act. Liberals couldn't care less that an inno­cent man might die. Liberals say little and do less while the U.S. bombs inno­cent civilians in Kosovo or Iraq or cuts welfare. Liherals are hypocrites (but that's another topic). I didn't like the 
Spartacists because they tried tu disrupt our efforts (but that too is another topicl. 
So we had meetings and discussions. We also leafleted and protested. We marched on the U.S consulate. Without a permit. On the street. And much to my surprise, no one was arrested (and all of our protests were completely non-vio­lent). The consulate closed for the after­noon. People were protesting all over the U.S., Canada, Italy. France, Scandinavia and beyond. Everywhere people were mobilizing. I illegally postered downtown 
Vanf'.ouver, covering telephones poles, walls and even a couple bus-stops. We were orga­nizing a big rally on 
Aug. 10 as part or a global last­
ditch 
attempt lo stop the exPcu­tion. I really thought Mumia was going to die. On Aug. 7, Mumia got 
a stay. On Aug. 10, Mumia was still on death row, and we marched through downtown Vancouver. I remnm­ber marching down Robson St. (the busiest commercial street in Vancouver) at night with the blazing torches that we'd made by stapling cloth and dipping them in wax. 1 remember blocking off two intersections, passing out leanets and getting soaked in the rain. 
I don't know what impar.l the 100 prayers I said had, nor that of' t!w 100 or 200 protesters who took over tlw strl'1'ls of Vancouver. 1do know l\1umia is still alive. 
Unf'ortunatcly, Mumia's latest appeal was denied in October and lw may soon be executed. This Saturday a ton of' pl'o­ple are going to Philadelphia for llrn biggest political prisoner protpst ever in the U.S. Buses an\ leaving from cv1,ry­where. See if the corporatn-controllt>u media dares to cover it. 

This story is notjusl about Mumia. It's about the 3,:iOO peoplP on dPath row. It's about people of color being dispropor­tionately jailed. It's about approximatl'ly 45 p11rc1mt of' prismwrs !wing African­Amcrican. It's about political prismwrs existing in a country that rlairns lo lw a democracy (Leonard Pc\ltiPr anyrnw''). Why am ov1\r a million Aml'ricans in fl'd­eral jails? It's about onc' justic1' system for white rich pnoplP and onn of' inj11sticl' and persecution for thi, poor and pcoplt· of color. And it's about libPrals who are complacent in this oppression through tlwir inaction. 
Mumia might be in jail b!'1:aus1• lw's a revolutionary ancV1,r bncaus!' !m's black. Probably not lwn1usP lw's pro-lifo. No matter. WhatnVl'r tlw casP, lh1• solution that he •1spouses and I share is to ovc•r­throw this racist. sPxist, IWtl'roS1'xisl. capitalist systPm that is cr1•ating its own Third World within thn U.S. by roloniz­ing, exploiting and KILUNC pP1>jJII• ol' color and the poor. 
Tlrny will execuh\ Mumia anti many more Mumias unless ... Hcvolution now!

¦ LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Is Anyone Listening? 
I was saddened to road the woll-writtnn Viewpoint lcttnr concerning the unsupported firing of the emiriently popular facully nrnmher, Professor Blanchard. Whal. most disturb1>d me as I read tho distressing column ubout t.trn architecture professor is that l have read that same letter too many limes In this Viewpoint section -letters about. the inconsequential weight given to student input in student matters. 
Often times. we hear and read about the Notre Dame fam­ily. I willingly bought into that idea from the lirst time I set foot on this campus. It's hard not. t.o when ono is surroundod by students who am so excitnd to be a part of something special -this University. To a large extent. I continue to boHevo in this imngl:l. But, the evonts or this academic ym1.r have crystallized for me the sad rnality of tho modern Notre Dame family. 
This family functions with Monk Malloy assuming the rolo of the father (no pun inhmdt~d). The fathnr that knows what's best for his children, period. Although our Big Ton inclusion was subverted in the linal hour, for weeks Monk .actively ignon,d the undeniably uni.lied and unwavnring SM· timont of students and alumni. This intormi11ahlo debato over the nondiscrimination clause, which ha!.i come to define the Viewpoint section of The Obsnrwir OVP.l' th,~ past !'ow years, shows a Monk who is complntely indiffer1int to Urn majority student and faculty opinion, And more recently. the grossly unjust and unjustithid Blanchard firing. which oul.­mged his former students, is just another chaptfll' in this redefinition of the Notre Dame family. 
Presid<rnt emf\rltus Father Theodore llesburgh is quotPd a& saying that this Univnrsity exists for ils alumni. Our cur­rent president contends that Notre Dame exists for her stu­dents. lf one or both are true, then why are such i'undamcn­tal policy decisions made wholly lndepnndont of' thosn pPophi who arc immediately affected? Basod on rocont observa­tions, my conclusion is that this university exists not for its students or nven its alumni. but for its endowrrnrnt. its Board of Trustees and l'or those pnoph~ sitting behind tho desks and redundant nameplates in the corporate labyrinth of Hayes-Healy. Jhope I'm wrong.

as St. Thomas tliaclrns, may not be morally binding. The decision ol' tho slate on war, as on other ques­tions. lwwPver, carries a strong presumption of validity. But tlrnre can be a moral duty. in excep­tional circumstances. to refuse to serve in an armed conllicl whntlwr or not a legal nxemption is granted: "IDluring ajusl war," wrote Fallrnr John Hardon, "a citizen must aid his country to gain victory, but Im may not voluntarily provide help if his nation's cause is evidfmtly unjust ... (T]hose conscripted or in military Sl'rvice when war (beginsI may, if tlrny doubt the justit:1' of' tho war, assume that lheir nation is right and so 1mgage in the conllict. The reason is that they do not have complotn knowledge of the facts to warrant making a contrary judg­ment," The Catholic Catechism (1975), HCJ-50. Similar considerations apply to a potnntial draftee. 
As the Calnchism (no. 2311 l suggests, tlrn slate should makn "equitable provision" !'or selective pacilists, provided limy "serve the human communi­ty in some other way." It may be practically impossi­ble, however, to provide such an exemption without encouraging wholesale fraud. Even if tho law does not nxcmpt tho selective objector, at some point, Im (or sho) may have the right and even tho duty to rdusn to servo. \V(i are all obliged to be sP!ective pacifists, reserving the right to submit, with pru­dencn, any act of the state, cv1m a war. to the higher standard of tho natural law and tho law of God. 
Tho principles are clear. Ilowevcr. the situation is ,norn complicat.ml than it was not too long ago. With a certified liar in tho While House, our gov\irnnHmt has l'mharked on· lornign adventures of dubious constitutionality and dubious relevance to the dofonsn of Hw common good of the American people or of' anyone nlso. That govr.rnmr.nt. too. has spon­sored an cxtcnnination of the innocent unborn that has produced a body count at. least six limos I.hat or thf' Holocaust. At some point, a citizon will have to facfi the issue of' whether his duty to avoid proxi­matn and unjustili1id cooperation with evil prevents his active participation in the military adventures, otlwr than nvidently genuine defonsn, of' such a regimn. So let us not be too severe in our judgmPnt of' llie pacifist. Wf'. may lrnvo lo share a cdl with him soml'day.

AnTostal'99soothescampuses with a bit of Hollywood 
By MICAELA LARKIN Scent' \'<1riter 
midst the April showers, spring has arrived 
in South Bend, bringing the r1mlization that 
summor is just around.. thn cornnr. But thn 
idea of' Lhe approaching summer is still a dis­
tant dream to :-.iotrc Dame and Saint Mary's 

students who still face an onslaught of term papers and 
linals. The group of events collcrtively known as AnTostal 
will mark the end ol' the linal full week ol' classes and will 
help students enjoy themselves one more time before the 
semester ends. 
AnTostal has been the last hurrah for students for :rn 
years. This grand tradition came to Notre Dame, like so 
many other traditions, f'rom Ireland. The name of tho fes­
tival derivns from the Gaelic term nrnaning "muster," 
··pageant" or "array." AnTostal began in Ireland in 1953 
as an effort to save the country l'rom its sagging economy 
and ebbing patriotism. For the Jrish. it was a chance to 
havA a good time whilr. reawakening the Irish culturn and 
creating unity and a sense of homo among the Irish peo­
ple. The tradition started in Northern Indiana as a way to 
celcbrntn unity and a sensp of home herP for on!' last 
time before the craziness 
A 
Tim contest to ser. who can lrnst cl1;nss up as a f'amous pc)rson in thn Notro Darno univnrsn should be entertain­ing with its different categori1is. (;iris will have tlw chance to show their bost costunrns as Marilyn Monron, Madonna, Princess Leia and the various "Cltwlcss" char­actors. Austill Powors, Indiana .Jones, Stove Austin and otlwr WWF wrnstlers are sonrn ol' tlrn catogorins for Notrn Dame mo-n. If the security of a group is prof'erabln, gather a bunch of fri1rnds and entnr as the Spicn Girls, the BPatles or everyonn's favorite family, tlw Brady Bunch. 
Once again the dining halls will reflect the theme of the day with a candlelight meal, complete with cobwebs. The themes of sei-fi favorites like "The X-filt~s." "Men In 13lack" and "Star Wars" will 11cho over the air waves. For those who still seek more adv1rnturn allnr din,wr, vnnt11rn over to North Quad to view a movie on an outdoor scre<)fl. "Arachnaphobia" will be playnd at <J p.m. Thursday. VicwPrs should nxpcct some internsting surprises that will make thr.ir time thrilling and memorable. 
Thursday also includes SMC Tosta!, whir.h lrngins at :1 
p.m. with can<rn races at. Lakll Marion. Following tlw races, students can return to Library Green for dinner, which is titled SMCnic. Not.1:e Dame students am wel­come, as co-ex t.ick1its will hn available at tlrn picnic. 

of finals week. Over the years, AnTostal has con­tinued to combat lethar­gy and apathy with heavy doses of fun and camaraderie. 
This tradition has con­tinued at Saint Mary's as well. in the form of Thursday's SMC Tosta.I, which will lake place on the Saint Mary's Library Green. 
AnTostal '99. with its theme of "J\n Tnstal Goes to Hollywood," will carry the tradition into the new millennium. Tobin Finwall, 1999 AnTostal coordinator, said that Notre Dame students should feel proud of this unique tradition. 
"We arc one of the few universities that has a long-standing tradition like AnTostal," she said. "II hope! that the stu­dents continu{" lo !\njoy /\nTostal for years to comn." 
One change for this year is that AnTostal is an action-packnd, thren­day {!Vent instead of tlrn usual week-long event. This change is mainly due to budget con­straints. Each day cele­brates a different aspect of llollywood: 
Wednesday is Comedy The Observer/Palrick Quigley Day, Thursday is Sci-Fi A child enjoys a snow cone while drawing on the sidewalk at Fieldhouse Mall during AnTostal '98. Day and Horror Night This week's AnTostal events provide opportunities for students to rediscover the child buried deep 

and Friday is Movie inside their souls. Soundtracks Day. 
Tim f'un begins Wednesday with Comedy Day./\ campus "Singled Out" game will take place at Fieldhouse Mall al 4 p.m. Playing "Singled Out" during AnTostal has bcconw somewhat of a minor campus tradition. This time around, Malt Quirion and Kathy Klos will emcnn tho nv{n1l, attnmpting to SPt up ".Singl1\d Out" guPsts .luslin Dunn. Evan OlivPr, Lindsay Williams and Melissa Trujillo. 
In addition to tlrn entenainmnnt of tlw ganrn, Troop J\if) and l<'irst Class Stcppt•rs, whirh irwltrdtis nnwly picknd ll'prndiau11 Mik,1 Brown. will also pt!rl'orm. Th<~ tiH~nw o[' Wcdnosday's moal in both '.\lotre Dame dining halls will lw circus dinner. Cotton randy and crazy decorations will creat1~ a comedic atmosphnrn that stud{ints havn ol't1rn ,~njoyr.d during cir!'.us lunclws. lnst11ad ol' tlw almost psy­chotic circus music playing ovnr and ov!'r again. students will Im treat1,d to tlw soundtracks from comodies liko "/\ustin l'owors." Tim PVPning will come lo a closn with a l'rcc showing of' Urn 1:omody classic "'l\alional Lampoon's Animal llous<>" in Lushing Auditorium. 
Sci-Fi Day and llorror Night will provid11 studtinls with ex1:iting clivnrsions Thursday al'tnrnoon and ovnning. (;alactic Cal'<i will t.akP plarr. at tho Hncknrs patio from 4 to (i p.m. The (;alactic C:ar6 will l't:attm\ campus bands, prizes, a drnss up-ns-sorn<H)lw-famous cont1)st and ol' 1'.oursr. a litth• "Intnrgalactic" Boasti1) 13oys. Tim Mntcors, 1,vho hail from Planet Knonan, will p1,rl'orm. Tim Dillon llall band SPxual ChrH'olat{i is also schndulnd to play. 
Throughout tlrn al'ternoon, st.udnnls can partil'ipatii in such games as a bungee run, a rlimbing wall and hippity­hop bouncy balls. Music will also bl' playPd throughout the day and into tlw r.vnning. SMC Tosta! wrnps up with a showing or "Arrnagnddon" at IO p.111.

llPspite llw pn•ssurn of' such a high-prnfilt\ tournamPnt. Mustilli c•nl.1•rl'd tlw l11urna1111!11l as rPlax1•d as possible. 
"I put 110 prPssun• on mys1dl"," slm said. ··1 had no 1•xp1•ctations. I w;intl'{J lo do wl'II, but I just wanL1•d lo havP fun." 
With her win ow1r the third­ranked Rnrtholomcw, ninth­rnnknd Mustilli named a r.ritical I000 points in her quest lo narn a spot in the World Championships. The top four fencers -based on points earned through lhe season -Harn a spot in the WC>rld Championships. Sincn she l"ocuscd on fonc:ing l'or tlrn Irish this winter, she rniss11d many matdrns and will have to Pam lmck thn points this summnr. 
M11stilli. how,•Vf\r, has rnwer shied away from a challenge. DuP lo lrnr style which she ri1isnibcs as bdng full of Ma Int or lwarl and a lot of aggrnssive­noss," she has met nverv chal­lPng" in hPr f(•ndng t;an;er and excelled. Ilf'r sucrnss is impart dun to her detPrmination. 
"Sim dm\sn 't evPr give up on lwrself." foil captain Nicol11 l'aulina said. "No matter what happens. slu\ always has a smile and is ready for the next bout. Sim is verv dndirated and works lmrdr.r tlu~n anyom! I know." 
Af't1ir having only foncod for four years, "vluslilli arrived at Notre Danrn and immediately made an impact in one of tho lop collegiate r,mcing programs in tlw country. Teaming with classmates Sara Walsh. Myriah Brown and Paulina for 274 wins in a single season, Mustilli proved that she could succeed at llw mHPgiate Jpvel. 
While she was mainly a foil foncer in high school, she had begun foncing both epcc and sabre near the end or her prep car<H\r. lfolwcen her freshman and sophom1>r1\ seasons, she was called upon by the team to 

switch from foil to cpee. With 
Walsh and Hrown both earning 
All-American honors as fresh­
men, it became clear that the 
foil team had a solid foundation 
for four years. 
Thus. Mustilli was moved to 
thu epee team in order to spread 
CJut the talent. Mustilli was at 
first relu,ctant to make the tran­. sition. 
..That was a really hard dtici­
sion for me because I kind of felt 
I was giving up and not sticking 
with what I had come here to 
fonce." she said. "I didn'l really 
know how it was going to go. 
Epee was a little bil harder for 
me to fence as well. There was a 
lot more pressure to fence well in cpec." 

The pressure of a new weapon did not seem to effect Mustilli on the strip where she led the epce team with 84 wins -good for third most all ~ime. Mustilli enjoyed even greater success in her junior year when she scored 69 wins and earned a spot in lhe NCAA tournament. 
In her first trip to the t(mrna­ment. she finished fourth and earned first team All-American honors as she helped the Irish to a second-placn finish. 
As a senior she proved that her success went far beyond just her fencing skills by leading lhe epce team as captain. She led both in her words and her 
actions. Picking up important points and calming ttiammates down in close matches. she guided the epue team to a third­place finish in the Midwest. 
"She really took control of lrnr squad this year and rnally made them come together as a t1\am," Paulina said. ''They had a lot of problems but they fought through them and really did well in the end." 
Closing her career with 304 earner wins -sflcond all-time at Notre Dame -Mustilli will be rnmembered as not only a great fencer, but also as a person who always put the team first and gave the Irish fencers their best chance for success.

tht• half. NotrP Dame had sev­<'ntl chancPs lo s1·Drl' in tlw 01wning momtints but wen•

After Notrt' Dame's leading srnrr.r L,wl ()'Shaughnessy put lwr lPam on the score­board. the Irish shut down Dukp's attack and closed the gap betwPPll the teams to 4-3 with 45 seconds left in tlrn half. 
ChanPY thPn stonewalled an Irish free position shot with nine seconds left to preserve Duke's 4-:-l IPad into halftime. 
"Tlw way we played in the first half' is proof that we can play with the top teams in the countrv," said Irish head coach T°racy Coyne. 
In tlw second half though, the Blue Devils outscored the Irish 10-2. Duke scored nine straight goals to open the sec­ond half. In that time. Tricia Martin put four goals past Notre Dame goalie Carrie Marshall. 
With a little under oighl mi11t1I.Ps rPmaining in t.hn gam1~. Notre Dame captain Kt•1-rv Callahan ,·radll'd the ball ;m tlw right side of tlH' goal and with a quick move to her h•ft blew past her defend­er. pulting the ball into the back or the net for the 2Mh straight game.

"Dukr, l'inislrnd their scoring chancns better in the second half' and showt->d wl1y they are tl11• third-ranked team in tl111 country," said Coyne. 
Sunday. tlw lrish looked to stop their two-game losing streak as they took on Yale. Tim Bulldogs scored two goals in the first 50 Sl'COJH!s, but the Irish rallied back witlr goals by O'Slrnughnessy and Maura Doyle. 
Yaln's Kate Flatley then 
lrnded  goals  with

Yal.l' went Dn to se1irP four goals,. taking a 7-3 !Pad, but Callahan answ!lrcd with two goals to cul into the lr,ad. 
Hain then made playing conditions almost impossible. Yale scored during the del­uge, taking an 8-5 lead into halftime. 
As soggy wcathr,r contin­ued, referees ordered players to finish the game at the Loftus Sports Center. When the game resumed, Notre Dame scored quickly and cut the deficit to two goals, but Yale responded with two of its own goals, making the score 
10-6. 

The Bulldogs and Irish went back and forth for the next 20 minutes, ending in a 14-10 final. the smallest deficit the Irish have incurred to a ranked team since losing 19-5 to Duke last year, 18-11 to Syracuse this year. 18-9 to Vanderbilt last Tuesday and 14-5 to Duke Friday.

Everyyear, a lot of people make a huge mistake on their taxes. They wind up sending Uncle Sam money they could be saving for retirement. Fortunately, that's a mistake you can avoid with SRAs-tax-deferred annuities from TIAA-CREF. SRAs not only ease your current tax bite, they offer an easy way to build retirement income -especially for the "extras" that your pension and Social Security benefits may not cover. Because your contributions are 111:ade in pretax dollars, you pay less in taxes now. And since earnings on your SRAs are tax deferred, your money works even harder for you. 
Today, we offer other before-and after-tax financial solutions, including IRAs and mutual funds. They're backed by the same investment exper­tise, low expenses, and personal service that have made TIAA-CREF the choice of America's educational and research community. 
Why write off the chance for a more rewarding retirement? Stop by your benefits office or call us at I 800 842-2776 and find out how TIAA-CREF SRAs can help you enjoy happier returns.

Sports W ritcr 
En FuPgo \'vasn't l'irr.d up <'nough to pull off a win Monday night in tlw round of 64. 
Unranknd Versatility, with playPrs Chris Dillon, Jo~i Lillis. Jason Childrnss. .lanws Cochran and John lliltz. was hot both offensively and clPf'PnsiVPly, downing tlrn No. 4 ser.d 2 I -5. 
"We were hitting our shots from the outside all game," said Di IIon. "Our offensive 
strategy was basically if you're open, shoot it." 
Versatility had a formidable stop on the way lo the round of 32 in the form of senior Irish starting center Phil llickey. A key player for En Fuego, Hickey played huge in 
· the lane. but VPrsatilitv han­dled him well. • "Ewiry time Phil caught the ball we wprr. doubling him," said Dillon. "And we rebounded against him pretty well." En Fuego, with Justin Meko, david Allen, Rufus 
Jackson and Scott-Fagan found itself in foul troublP late ia the game. A dnfonsiv<) foul against the team sent Cochran to the Jin<' with a scorn of 20-15. A silenced crowd looked on as Cochran sank the clutch shot for tlw win. 
ln otlrnr tournament action, top-ranked Primetimn was in prime form as it took on Trcs es Bueno. With quick olT-the­ba II movement and sharp passes, Prirnetirne was too much for Jason Thompson, James Malloy, Neil Friery, Nick Wilson and Tim Welsh to handle. 
Primetime controlled the ball for most of the first half. leading 11-6 at the break. The top-seed with Kevin llughes, Haam Jani, Mike Empy, Garret Ganske and Steve Craig was unstoppable on offense, utilizing the screen to lind the open man. 
"It was une of' those nights where we made a couple of' passos, set a couplr. of' sr,reens and were able to get our shots off," said Craig, "and tonight i,ur jump shots wnre falling." 
.Jani, usually a deadly offen­sive weapon, was r,old from the outside, scoring only once each half. Craig stepped up and was the driving 01T1msivc force in the first half, scoring six points !'or a total of' a team-high seven. llughes kept Primetimn on offense, coming down with nine rebounds. 
Empy's scrappy dcfensivn play at the guard position kBpt Tres !is Bueno on edge. Stealing tho ball four timPs, Empy was a key to Primetime's fast-breaking transition game. 
"We like to play man-Lo­man defense and be as physi­cal as \•Ve can," said Craig. "We like to put a lot of pres­sure on the ball." 
Tros es Bueno refused to succumb to the prnssure of' µlaying the top-ranked team 


and played a solid game. Wilson led the team with fiv11 baskets and White added !'our in its 21-13 loss. 
"They were definitely the toughest team we'v<) faced so far," said Craig. "They were good athletes -vnry physical players," 
Primetime is roady for the heightened competition the next.round will provide. 
"The t~rnms have gotten tougher car,h game," said Craig. "From hore on out it's going to be a war." 
At the No. 2 spot, Keyplay.com came up with enough key plays to Barn a win and a place in the round 
of' :{2. Taking on Tnam Viagra in an intnnsc match-up, Alex Gesn, John Tl1asdal11, l'aul Moorn, Tom l>nitrich and Cas Schn1dlnr combinnd for 11 steals and rnlicd on a givn­and-go l'asl-br<)ak offense in the 21-11 win.
