New Senate convenes, committees list aims 
by Milton Jones 
Acknowledging organization as the first consideration of the student senate, SBP Dave Krash­na opened the first senate meet­ing of the present school term. In order to acquaint all present with the organizational format of the meeting, Krashna outlined several basic points of procedure for each session. 
· Next, Stay Senator Tom Thrasher described the Student and Human Affairs committees and canvassed members for both groups. According to Thrasher the Student Affairs committee, headed by Fred Giuffrida, deals with various phases of student life, while the Human Affairs Committee deals with minority problems not covered by the student committee. 
Following Thrasher, Stay Senator Ron Weber outlined the structure of the Student Union and Academic Affairs commit­tees, and solicited senators for each. Weber stated that the Aca­demic Affairs Committee will deal with academic problems such as pass-fail systems and student-teacher conflicts, while the Student Union committee will act as a watch-dog type of board which controls the Stu­dent Union, investi!]:ates finances and student government, and performs other similar tasks. 
With the resignation of Glen Corso, SLC representative for Planner and Grace Towers, the Senate was assigned the task of finding a replacement to fill the sixth student representative posi­tion on the SLC. The Senate decided to fill the vacant post by holding an election in the towers. This action will be taken by the election board of the Student Senate. 
Before closing the meeting, Krashna announced a list ·of pro­posals to be submitted to the Board of Trustees from the Committee for Social Under-standing. This board is function­ing at present in place of the University Forum. Some of the suggested proposals included coed dining . halls, a mall and shopping center, more minority student programs and funds, and a reformed University Forum which will be more alive, bene­ficial and functional.

St. Mary's Department of Counseling is on an expansion course, with Miss Mary Martucci as director. 
When Miss Martucci came to the college three years ago, there was no counseling department as mch, but a number of places on campus where that type of help was available. Her job was to bring these resources together to .;reate a central office. 
"My interpretation of a coun­seling center is an area that handles developmental types of concerns which students this age have," Miss Martucci said. She stresses the prevention of stu­dent difficulties as well as the

solution to them. 

The department director de­veloped the advisor program at SMC -· upper class advisors are assigned small groups of fresh­men to help them in adjusting to academic and other aspects of college and community life. 
"The advisor program is the key in this contemporary world," Miss Martucci said. "The society is complex and a peer group can help much more effectively ... there is no deep therapy; if the need is there, the freshmen are recommended to the Notre Dame psychological services." 
Miss Martucci is the only pro­fessionally trained person in her department and a "department of one cannot do all the things that a counselling service should do." She said that freshman year is a center of concentration for counseling help because it is the most difficult time in college life, but she is also responsible for the other three classes. 
"Counseling is based on stu­dent needs. It is concerned with developmental functions, cor­rective and preventive -counsel­ing can't be an end in itself, it has to be a service."

Can Parietal Rights Bring Happiness? 

The second most serious problem currently facing our troubled campuses is the problem of parietal rights. (The first most serious problem of course is the recent outbreak of moult among sorority house canaries.) 
Let us today look for answers to the parietal rights problem, for that is the purpose of these columns: to analyze the dilemmas that vex our colleges, to seek feasible solutions. I write them for the brewers of Miller High Life Beer. In return they pay me money. That is the American way. It has made this country great. 
But I digress. A parietal right, as you know of course, is the right of a student to keep a parietal in his room. A parietal, as you know of course, is a· small North American marsupial somewhat like a chip­munk in appearance but actually a species of fur-bearing herring 
(mutatis mutandis). 
Naturally you all want to keep a parietal in your room. Not only are they endlessly cheerful-always romping and frisking and wagging their little binaries-but they're smart too. They're not as smart as dogs of course, but they can readily learn simple tricks like fetching your slippe~s or parsing a sentence. 
But the main reason you want a parietal is because they eat noth­ing but beer cans. I promise you, friends, you get yourself a healthy adult parietal and you'll never again have to lug empties to the trash barrel. And of course the better the beer can, the more he'll eat, which of course accounts for the popularity of Miller High Life on every campus. Obviously a beer as good as Miller is bound to come in a can of the same superb quality. And that's what Miller has-superb qual­ity. Also malt and hops and water and a marvelous brewing formula that's been kept secret for generations. In fact, this formula is so secret that it's known only to the chief brewmaster and he is never allowed to leave the brewery. So if you ever find yourself in Milwaukee, look up his wife. 
But I digress. A healthy adult parietal, I was saying, will eat his weight in Miller beer cans every day. However, if you drink your Miller in bottles-as millions do, and no wonder, for who is not tempted by such sparkling amber goodness in such crystal-clear bottles? Eh? Who is not?-if, I say, you drink your Miller in bottles, I have to tell you that parietals won't help. They don't eat bottles. In fact, the only pet that does is the scaly bursar (paramus newJersus), but take my advice: don't get one. The scaly bursar at best is a beast of sluggish demeanor and uncertain temperament. Oh, sure, sometimes it will play a little Monopoly when it's in the mood, but mostly it just lays around grooming its addenda. Moreover, it's given to sudden fits of pique and may tusk you without warning. 
But I digress. Why, you ask, won't the dean let you keep a parie­tal in your room? I'll tell you why: the parietal, a nocturnal animal, sleeps only by day. At night it is always awake and-here's the rub­during its waking hours it utters a loud, guttural croak approximately once every 21'2 seconds, a sound something like: "Prock ... Prock ... Prock." 
~ 


Well, naturally when "Prock . .. Prock ... Prock" starts booming down the corridors, every proctor in the dormitory leaps out of bed and comes running. Last year alone more than 30,000 of them were killed tripping on their nightshirts. 
And so, dear friends, you see that the dean does have a point. Won't you put down your grenade and have a meaningful dialogue with him? Sweet reason can still save your college. Don't let it go the way of so many others-abandoned hulks today, stark and silent ex­cept for ghostly sounds echoing in the night: "Prock ... Prock ... Prock."

We, the brewers of Miller High Life Beer, disregarding all prudent advice and sound advertising prcu:tice, will bring you more of these columns later if we are still in business.
