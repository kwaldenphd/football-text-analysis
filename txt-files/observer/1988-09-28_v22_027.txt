GREENWOOD, S.C. -A teacher who was wounded. while trying to stop a gunman during a fatal shooting spree in an elementary school, and then held the man for police, "thinks about others before herself," colleagues said. 
An 8-year-old was killed and two teachers and eight students were wounded in Monday's at­tack at Oakland Elementary School. A 7-year-old who was shot in the neck was returned to surgery Tuesday because of complications and was in criti­cal condition.

Police Chief James Coursey said James Wilson walked through the school's front door Monday morning, went to the cafeteria and opened fire with a .22-caliber, nine-shot revol­ver, wounding one teacher and three students. 
He left the cafeteria and en­tered a girl's restroom to reload.

ND may host political debate 
By JIM LANG News Staff 
The 2000 students who regis­tered to vote in St. Joseph's county could play a crucial role in the upcoming 3rd District Congressional race according to Ed Jordanich, one of the Stu­dent Government liasons to the Hall President's Council. Jor­danich, speaking to last night's council in Lewis Hall, said that in the last congressional race the outcome was determined by a mere 47 votes. 
Because of the large amount of student voters, Jordanich said, and the small amount of votes dividing the two candi­dates in the last election, chal­

Shroud thought to be burial cloth of Christ could be a clever forgery 
Associated Press 
ROME -Laboratory tests show the Shroud of Turin was made in the 14th century and could not be the burial cloth of Christ, the scientific adviser to the archbishop of Turin said he learned on Tuesday. 
Professor Luigi Gonella said he has not yet seen the official report from the three laboratories that conducted the carbon-14 dating tests, but that all the leaks to the press dated it to the 14th cen­tury and "somebody let me understand that the rumors were right." 
"It is quite evident some­body sold out to the press," said Gonella in an interview from his home in Turin. 
He refused to identify who had told him about the results of the tests at Oxford University, the University of Arizona and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technol­ogy at the University of Zurich. 
The shroud, 14 feet, 3 inches long and 3 feet, 7 inches wide, bears the faint, blood-stained image of a whipped and crucified man. 
Some have maintained the herringbone patterned linen is the burial cloth of Christ, while others have dismissed it as a clever forgery. 
The shroud was removed April21 from the silver chest where it is kept wrapped in red silk on an altar in the cathedral in Turin. 
A strip, four-tenths of an inch by 2.8 inches, was cut from the cloth and then divided into three smaller pieces for the labor~•ories, each of which got one piece, in addition to another piece of cloth of a known age.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Teaching has few bucks but many great rewards 
Room 110 was empty at 8 a.m. Monday mor­ning, but by 8:10 the students began filing in, taking their respective seats. Strangely, the stu­dents were smiling and laughing, seemingly un­affected by the early hour. 
This was definitely not freshman calculus or physics, notorious for meeting at similarly obscene hours of the morning. The conversa­tions in the room were not of the weekend's tailgaiting or romance, but rather of Sunday's trip to grandma's house and the latest Saturday morning cartoon. 
These are the students I encountered in a first grade class at a South Bend elementary school I visited as part of an education class which is taught at Saint Mary's. 
Education 201F, Teaching As a Profession, the course I am taking as an elective this se­mester, is designed to give students first-hand, practical experience and knowledge of the field. 
This first day brought back many memories of grade school. Itis not the subjects we studied that I remember so well, but saying the Pledge of Allegiance, the ritualistic lunch count, smile faces on papers, words of praise, and the ever­present threat of my name on the board for not following directions. 
The three short hours of my visit to the class I encountered all these things and more. 
The children took great interest in the topics they were discussing. Questions were met with enthusiastically raised hands reaching for the sky, and at times accompanied by appropriate sighs, groans, and exclamations. 
When a child's mother surprised the class with a recently captured praying mantis, the students observed it with the fascination and curiosity unique to childhood. For these children their teacher helped them to meet new discoveries in a fearless and open-minded man­ner. 
Teaching is not a highly esteemed profession in our society. Most view it as a career with few rewards. Yet, my visit to the first grade class reinforced my interest in the education of young children. The rewards are often over­looked because they are not of a monetary na­ture. 
However, the satisfaction one receives in seeing a child grasp a new concept, cannot be measured. The open and trusting nature of children is a welcome change to adult world threats of cut throat competition and false al­legiances for material or personal gain. 
Those with an interest in teaching should not

be put off by the prospect of a lower starting salary, for teaching can provide one of the hig­herst degrees of job satisfaction. The future of our country is dependent on raising the quality of education. There is a need for creative and motivated people who will be dedicated to making the present system more successful and workable. Those entering the field today will most likely be involved in exciting reform movements of the educational process. 
It is true that teachers are underpaid. Con­sider the responsibilities of the teacher to not only educate, but to instill values, supply guid­ance, and provide encouragement. Teachers play a large role in the development of a child as an individual who will become an asset to society. For these reasons teaching should be a more highly paid profession, if for no other reason than to attract the most qualified can­didates. 
Teachers deserve our utmost respect for their efforts. Most everyone has fond memories of a favorite teacher who has inspired them to demand more from themselves and to fulfill their potential. Each of us is in some way is indebted to teachers in their past. After all, without them you would not be reading this column.

Lecture discusses move of C.hile to democracy 
By KELLEY TUTHILL 
News Staff 
Veronica Montecinos, a Fac­ulty Fellow from the Kellogg Institute for International Studies, spoke yesterday about the transition to democracy in Chile. 
The lecture began with Mon­tecinos making the point that, "the opposition to the military government in Chile expects to defeat General Pinochet in the coming plebiscite of October 5." Montecinos said that this would be a vital event in the transition to democracy. 
"In the last few years, many government and opposition leaders in Chile have suggested that the transition to democracy should result in the building of a 'modern and sta­ble' democracy," said Mon­tecinos. 
For those in the government, a modern democracy consists of the "depoliticization" of politics with more of a tech­nocratic approach to decision­making, said Montecinos. 
Montecinos spoke of the increased importance economists have in the party politics since the coup. "Economists have played leading roles in the design of institutions and strategies in­tended to bring parties of the Center, Right, and Left to­gether," said Montecinos. 
Montecinos said that in the majority of the parties' policies there is a consensus that dem­ocratic economic development should realize "the importance of markets in the economy, the right of the state to adjust mar­ket signals to policy goals, the importance of integration in the international economy

through the development of the export sector, and the impor­tance of assuring the competi­tiveness of national production through efficient import sub­stitution." 
She also insisted that, "Production should be mainly in the hands of the private sec­tor, although with active par­ticipation by the state, and that to overcome extreme income inequality and poverty, a more active social policy is neces­sary. 
"I would like to argue, however, that the political role of economists may be an in­dicator of more profound changes in Chilean politics," said Montecinos. Montecinos said, "Technical expertise had been growing in government agencies well before the mili­tary came to power. But Congress, and parties, espe­cially on the Right and the Left, had lagged behind in this trend towards professionalization." 
"Perhaps the process of transition to democracy will foster a change in the 'culture' governing the relations be­tween political leadership and those who understand the con­straints of implementation," said Montecinos. "And this in turn will be reflected in the or­ganizational context of policy­making. 
The transitional moment may be a privileged point to ob­serve how a new regime is shaped and consolidated by an increased attention to the tech­nical aspects of political deci­sions," said Montecinos. 
Montecinos said that many of the institutional policies used by the authoritarian regime, such as changes in the labor code and government centralization, will become a legacy to the democratic gov­ernment. "Depending on whe­ther the new government is a center-left or a center-right coalition, it will attempt more or less drastic changes." 
"The centrality of parties in the Chilean political system has inspired a lively debate on whether or not the party sys­tem was responsible for the breakdown of democracy," said Montecinos. 
She also said, "Parties as or­ganizations react differently to changes in the political envi­ronment : first to the collapse of democracy, then to aut­horitarian repression, exile and democratic reconstruc­tion." 

Speaking about party profes­sionalism, Montecinos said that, "increased profes­sionalization of party struc­tures could make it more diffi­cult for bureaucratic teams in government to ignore party criticisms of policy options." 
She said in conclusion, "It could also make it more diffi­cult for opposition parties to concentrate on taking advan­tage of every setback in government policies." 
Two seniors from Alumni on their way to becoming bridge masters 
By Florentine Hoelker 
News Staff 
Two Notre Dame students recently entered and won a regional bridge tournament. Yet, they say they have quite a distance to cover before they are really successful bridge players. 
Matt Beuter and Fred Heidenreich, senior room­mates in Alumni Hall, com­peted September 16-18 in Indianapolis. 
As winners, they each received a plaque and both

••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••.. 

came closer to reaching the ul­
timate goal of bridge players: 
becoming "life masters." 
Although Beuter and Heiden­
reich have been playing bridge 
as partners for well over a 
year, Beuter says "we're con­
stantly learning new things. 
Tournament bridge is likely the 
most complicated card game 
there is, and can't honestly be 
compared to any other card 
game. It takes months just to 
play proficiently." 
Once proficiency is reached, 
the next step is to accumulate 
points by winning and, when 
ready, to join the American 
Contract Bridge League 
(ACBL). 
There are degrees of points 
which depend on the size and 
prestige of each tourna­
ment/game: national tourna­
ments award gold points, 
regionals award red points, 
sectionals award silver points, 
and ordinary club games 
award black points. 
To obtain the status of life master, a total of 300 points is needed, but there are provi­sions. Of the 300 points, 25 must be gold, 25 must be red, and 50 must be silver. The remaining 200 may be a mixture of any of the four colors. 
This was not the first win for Beuter and Heindenreich. "We've won before, but that was in novice games. Now we're one step up. We hope to play at the Grand Nationals in Nashville, which is a week-long tournament over Thanksgiv­ing." 
But the two are far from being life masters: they only received 3.54 points at the regional tournament. "Becom­ing a life master is a long process," reported Beuter. Bridge is apparently not very popular among Notre Dame students. Although there was an official Bridge Club last year, its weekly games at Alumni Hall stopped this year. 
Beuter said, "No other stu­dents play tournament bridge, or we would see them. I just wish more people played." 
Weatherman just carrying on his 'family tradition' 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -A volun­teer weather observer at Shoals who received national recognition for his efforts said Tuesday he is just carrying on a family tradition. 
William Keller has been reading thermometers, gauging rainfall and watching the level of the White River for 32 years-the same amount of time he served as a rural mail carrier. 
"My grandfather had (the job) and after he died, I took it,'' said Keller. ''Mter a couple of years, I had to report for the service, and my dad took it for a couple of years." 
Keller spent six years in the Army during World War II, in­cluding 18 months overseas, mostly in England and France. 
"My dad had the job until 1958. Then I took it back, and I've had it ever since." 
The National Weather Ser­vico honored him Monday with the John Campanius Holm award for outstanding ac­complishments in meteorologi­cal observation. It is the second-highest award a cooperative weather observer can receive.

Ind. man held for murder of woman 
Associated Press 
CARMEL, Ind. -A Carmel man was jailed on a charge of murder Tuesday after leading authorities to the nude and bat­tered body of a woman who had been missing three days. 
William Wallace, 26, was being held without bail Tues­day night in the Hamilton County Jail in Noblesville after being arraigned in the after­noon. 
Dr. Michael Clark, pat­hologist for the Marion County coroner's office, said the vic­tim, Carla Auda, 21, had been asphyxiated. She was last seen leaving a bowling alley Friday night. 
The bowling alley, Woodland Bowl, is about 10 miles down 96th Street from body was found early Tuesday along the White River on the Hamilton­Marion county line. 

Deputy Marion County Coroner Jack Lyday said the body was face-down under three logs and that grass had been pulled up and scattered on the logs to help conceal it. 
Wounds on the victim's face suggested she had been beaten, he said. The body could have been there since Friday night, he added. 
The victim's clothing was found in a tree about 15 feet away, Lyday said. 
Sgt. Mitch Russell of the Hamilton County sheriff's de­partment said investigators recovered a Burger King uni­form of the kind Auda was wearing when she disappeared Friday night.

St. Mary's Road 
lighting installed 

Dear Editor: 
Last semester I circulated a petition in an attempt to strengthen the security aspects on the St. Mary's Road, con­necting Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. The lighting was very poor and some­thing needed to be done. I would offi­cially like to thank Fr. Tyson and Mr. Rakow of Notre Dame, Sr. Karol Jack­owski and Mr. Chlebek of St. Mary's, and The Observer for their quick and cooperative response to the petition. Thanks to various efforts, the road now boasts several new and brighter lights. The new lights represent a safer way to bring the two communities together, and Notre Dame need be applauded for their quick response and remedy of the situation. Thank you.

Tragic death shows importance of safety 
Dear Editor: 
Hello. Approximately two weeks ago many of you had your lunches inter­rupted by a disturbing Observer article announcing a tragedy: the death of a friend of mine, and a fellow member of the class of '88, Judith Anne Wrappe. 
Although I got to know Judith only during our senior year, hers was the type of personality which left a lasting impression on you immediately. She was witty and attractive, but most of all she was devoted. Devoted to a dream of cultivating her artistic talents to their fullest potential. Judith was unique to Notre Dame in the sense that she did not follow any sort of career path predetermined by her parents or fiscal needs, but rather Judith followed something much more important, her heart. She died on the streets of Brook­lyn, New York, in the pursuit"of her dream. I'm confident, though, when I say that Judith's courage, determina­tion and strength will endure in the souls of all those people who were for­tunate enough to have her touch their lives. 
I spoke to Judith for a short while outside my Manhattan office building on the day she died. Barely 10 hours 
Doonesbury 
later, I saw her tarpaulin-covered body, lifeless, on the television news. It was then that I realized how fragile and pre­cious life really is. At about this same time I decided to write this piece as a tribute to Judith's memory, and in the hope that such a horrid situation will never befall any of you. 
I realize Mom and Dad pave taught 
all of you basic safety precautions, but 
I hope now you will follow their advice 
a little closer. For the large group of 
you who will be moving to large cities 
next year, such basic rules as not 
walking alone past 9 p.m., and never 
walking down a deserted street, might 
just save your life. Remember also, that South Bend is not exactly Dis­neyland, either. A drunken walk home from "the bars" can be just as danger­ous as getting lost in the South Bronx in the middle of the night. Believe me. I've done both, and I know. Good luck to all of you, and remember, your life is the most precious thing you control; treat it that way.

ND becomes pivotal voting block 
Dear Editor: 

Last Friday afternoon there was an interesting addition to the excitement that always blankets the Notre Dame campus during the autumn weekends. The four hundred plus people who gath­ered on the Fieldhouse Mall were treated to a spirited discussion with Bruce Babbit, the 1959 Notre Dame graduate who is currently the governor of Arizona and formerly a Democratic presidential candidate. His presence at that gathering on the mall is signifi­cant, for it is one event among many that symbolize the beginning of stu­dents at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's taking an active role and exercising an effective voice in the upcoming Novem­ber elections. 
It had been our intention from the beginning to register and inform Notre Dame students for the November elec­tions. However, our original goal has expanded to a greater and more excit­ing reality. That is, between the two campuses almost 2500 students have registered as St. Joseph County voters. In actuality these student bodies have

now become a powerful voting block in 
this state and this community. Recog­
nizing that the last congressional elec­
tion was decided by a mere 47 votes, 
our voice as a block could most likely 
become the deciding factor in many of 
these elections. With this in mind the 
time has come for the candidates for 
city and state offices to finally take 
notice of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's 
students and their concerns in this com­
munity. Therefore, student govern­
ment and Student Union Board will in­
vite local candidates to come to our 
campus and speak to our issues--issues 
such as crime, the use of police force 
(police dogs at off-campus parties), 
quality of student housing, and ~ host 
of oth~ concerns. Let it be clear that 
most of these races on the community 
level can be decided by a few hundred 
votes. Our numbers demand that the 
local politicians take notice of our con­
cerns. For the first time in many years, 
we have the ability to make a difference 
in the environment in which we live. 
In addition to invitations that SUB 
and student government will extend to 
the local candidates, a voter informa­
tion campaign will begin in October. 
This program will seek to inform stu­
dents about who is running for the 
various offices and what that can­
didate's responses are to the issues ar­
ticulated above. 
The time has come for the South Bend 
community to take students seriously. 
The way to do that is for students to 
speak loudly, and with one unified voice 
on election day.

ND computing needs revamping 
Dear -Editor: 

It is with disappoinlment that I read Michael Wells' article on the state of computing at Notre Dame in the Sept. 2 issue of The Observer. It all sounds so wonderful: a new office of comput­ing, new labs, new uses for computers, and greater accessibility for students. But has anyone taken a really close look at what is happening to computing on campus? As a Notre Dame graduate and former employee of the Computing 
Garry Trudeau 
Center, I feel it is necessary to point 
out that all is not as it seems when it 
comes to computing and the current ap­
pn~ach currently being undertaken at 
the Office of University Computing. 
Many people familiar with Notre 
Dame can see the "typical" solution 
being applied to computing: just throw 
money at it and the problem will go 
away. It is the same type of attitude 
which led to the purchase of the first 
publicly available microcomputers on 
campus in 1982. It was an idea with a 
lot of potential, but somewhow those in 
charge "forgot" to budget money for 
software or the staff necessary to sup­
port this additional load. This type of 
thoughtless attitude towards serving 
the users, the Notre Dame community, 
is what has hampered the advancement 
of computing all along and what threat­
ens the current plans to finally bring 
computing at Notre Dame to a nearly­
respectable level for an institution of 
its claimed academic excellence. 
If computing is to advance out of the dark ages at Notre Dame, the Univer­sity must recognize that the people in­volved in the support structure-the front line people and the student employees, not the managers-are the most important resource they have. If the University does not take the steps necessary to hire and retain competent, caring and unselfish staff members in the future, no number of new machines, labs or networks will ever advance the educational use of computing at Notre Dame. Without first recognizing and addressing this basic principle (many things can be done to improve upon this situation without a great expenditure of funds), greater numbers of comput­ing resources only threaten to increase the chaos which already runs rampant in University computing support. 
As a last word to those who remain in the battle to provide the type of com­puter support Notre Dame has always discussed, but has yet to achieve, I wish vou the best of luck and leave you with 
this bit of advice from Father Hesburgh (Time, May 1987): "The very essence of leadership is that you have to have a vision. It's got to be a vision you ar­ticulate clearly and forcefully on every occasion. You can't blow an uncertain trumpet."

WSND a sound alternative for music lovers 
HAO TRAN accent writer 
or most of us at NotreF Dame, classical music is not first on our list of listen­ing favorites. Consequently, classical radio stations such as 88.9 FM WSND are easily overlooked. Yet look again, this University FM station has much to offer the Notre Dame community and only a part of it is classical music. 
WSND is officially certified to promote education and fine arts through the mode of radio. This station which broadcasts from .the clock-tower of O'Shaughnessy Hall began several decades ago. It airs from 7 a.m. until 2 a.m. The channel's listening radius encompasses about 50 miles, which means it attracts audiences in three different states. 

Students and a few volun­teers from the Michiana area run the station. Tara Creedon, the student manager of WSND, said, "The station's primary goals this year are to make students aware of where we are and what we have to offer them." What WSND has to offer is not only abundant but also unique and diverse. 
Primarily classical music is played during the day from 7 a;m. until 10 p.m. Three spe­cial shows add a little spice to the day programming. They are called Daybreak from 7 a.m.to 9 a.m., Meridian from 12 p.m. to 1 
p.m., and Tafelmusik from 5 
p.m. to 7 p.m. A Jazz show is featured on every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 10 p.m. until midnight. This show varies from classic to contemporary jazz. The Mon­day show highlights audience requests which may be called in at 239-7342.

New musical organization sounds clear as a bell 
COLLEEN GANNON accent writer 
S
tarting a new organiza­tion at Notre Dame is not an easy task to perform. Senior Paul Waguespack could attest to the validity of this statement. Waguespack tried to form a Notre Dame handbell choir two years ago, but he was unable to put it all together. It was not until this year that the handbell choir established itself as a per­manent Notre Dame activity. 
Handbell choirs originated in Europe, where they syste­matically rang large power bells. Instead of practicing and disturbing the entire town, they used handbells to practice without disturbing anyone. The bells ranged from the size of a basketball to the size of a tea cup. 
Currently, the handbell choir has 25 bells giving it two octaves. When Waguespack began organizing the choir, the University had two octaves of Dutch bells, but these bells are not good for choir use. Last year, the choir had to borrow bells from a local church. 
Over this past summer, the choir managed to sell the old Dutch bells and to purchase two octaves of American Schulmerich bells. The choir is hoping to get a third octave next semester and to eventu­ally have a total of five oc­taves. Unfortunately, the bells are very expensive. The two octaves the choir ob­tained cost $2,200. 

The handbell choir per­forms at a variety of weekend Masses at Sacred Heart Church and at special Masses, such as this year's opening Mass. The choir will also be performing around the Notre Dame campus during the Christmas season. 
The choir is currently made up of ten members ranging from freshmen to seniors. Steve Warner, the Director of Liturgical Music, has been very supportive of the hand­bell choir from the start. Warner helps the choir with paperwork and booking their performances. 
The choir usually holds two practices a week in which Waguespack leads the choir. Senior Claire Harbeck said, "Paul is very patient. He has an ear for music, and he is able to pick up the choir's mistakes and correct them." 
Harbeck had never played handbells before joining the choir last year. She found it very easy to learn to play the handbells with her strong mu­sical background. She feels rhythm and the ability to read music are essential in learning to play the hand­bells.

SMC tennis wins, runs record to 7-0 
By JANE SHEA 
SMC Sports Editor 

The Saint Mary's tennis team breezed by Tri-State Univer­sity Monday, continuing its un­defeated season. The Belles' record now stands at 7-0. 
"Tri-State has just returned to the district after a five-year absence," said Head Coach Deb Laverie. 
In singles, the Belles lost only two games. Charlene Szajko, a senior, led the team with her exceptional play. Szajko, who played in the number one posi­tion, easily won her match 6­1,6-0. 
"We hope to dominate the Districts," said Laverie. "That is what is fueling us to keep con­centrating and working." 
Jennifer Block and Sarah Mayer have also been .playing well and both won their singles matches 6-0,6-0. 
"We should beat Taylor Uni­versity," said Laverie. "Our team is looking very good and working hard." 
The Belles play at Taylor Friday.

NEW YORK -All-Pros Lawrence Taylor and Bruce Smith and three other players who were suspended for 30 days when they failed NFL drug tests during the preseason were reinstated by the league Tuesday. 
NFL spokesman Joe Browne said that Taylor, the star linebacker of the New York Giants, and Buffalo Bills defen­sive end Smith were reinstated along with linebacker Emanuel King and cornerback Daryl Smith of the Cincinnati Bengals and receiver John Taylor of the San Francisco 49ers. 
All five players were on their teams' non-football illness list and missed the first four games this season. Taylor's suspen­sion was due to end Tuesday, while the other four were al­lowed to return a. few days early "as an accomodation to the players and their teams," Browne said. All of them were eligible to play this weekend once the suspensions were lifted. 
The respective teams can ask the league for a one-game roster exemption for the reinstated players. The players will "continue to receive appro­priate counseling and treat­ment, and reinstatement is on the condition of their totally refraining from further viola­tions of the NFL substance abuse policy," Browne said.

Olympic gold In record time. Johnson's use of 
Olympic games with his recent disqualification stanozolol symbolizes the universality of steroids from the 100 meter dash final In which he won In athletics. A related story Is at right. 
Soviets stun USA 82-76 
Associated Press 
SEOUL -The U.S. basketball team lost the second game in its glorious Olympic history Tuesday, bowing to the Soviets 82-76 in a grudge match that has brewered for 16 years and three seconds. 
The U.S. went into its semi­final game against the Soviets trying to avenge the only loss on its 85-1 Olympic record, but now the best the Americans can do is a bronze medal while the Soviets go for gold. 
In 1972 at Munich, America met the Soviet Union for the gold medal, and, after the final three seconds were played twice because of referee error and a scoreboard malfunction, the Soviets won 51-50. 
So angered was the U.S. team that it refused to accept the sil­ver medal. 
"Every day Russian people and Russian journalists and TV talk about historic three seconds in Munich," said Alex­ander Gomelsky, who is coach­ing his sixth Olympics for the Soviets. "This is a good story, and I like it to be same here." 
Steve Lewis led a 1-2-3 sweep of the 400 meters, just one­hundredth of a second off the 20-year-old Olympic record and three more boxers ad­vanced to the semifinals, as­sured of at least a bronze medal.

Lewis won the 400-meter gold in 43.87 seconds, and favored teammate Butch Reynolds, who holds the world record of 43.29, was second in 43.93. An­other American, Danny Everett, took the bronze in 
44.09. Lewis' time was just .01 seconds off the Olympic mark by Lee Evans of the United States in Mexico City in 1968. 
Three more U.S. boxers, 
meanwhile advanced into the 
semifinals, where they are as­
sured of at least a bronze 
medal. The United States has 
eight of its 12 boxers still in ac­
tion, including six in the semi­
finals. 
Those advancing Wednesday 
morning were Kennedy McKin­
ney of Killeen, Texas, and Ken­
neth Gould of Rockford, Ill., 
and Ray Mercer of Jackson­

McKinney scored a 5-0 vic­tory over Stephen Mwema of Kenya in the 119-pound divi­sion, and Gould was a unani­mous winner over Joni Nyman of Finland at 147 pounds. Mer­cer knocked down Italian Luigi Gaudiano and stopped him in the first round of their 201­pound fight.

Johnson scandal is 'tip of the iceberg' 
Associated Press 
SEOUL -Ben Johnson is gone, 
but his shadow will forever 
remain a dark Olympic monu­
ment to the use of drugs in 
sports. 
Johnson's dramatic dis­
qualification, perhaps the big­
gest embarrassment in Olym­
pic history, hung heavy over 
the Games Wednesday, shift­
ing attention from remarkable 
individual performances to a 
shocking drug scandal. 
Johnson was stripped of the 
gold medal and his world 
record time of 9.79 seconds for 
the 100-meter dash after his 
urine sample revealed traces 
of the anabolic steroid 
stanozolol. 
"The sport is getting wild 
with ,so many people on drugs 
and those not on drugs are 
trying to keep up with those on 
it. It's very difficult to keep 
up," said American Calvin 
Smith, who moved up to take 
the bronze in the 100. 
And Dr. Arne Ljungqvist, 
head of the IAAF's medical 
commission, said the problem 
might stretch well beyond the 
Canadian sprinter. 
"We only test the top inter­
national athletes in the top in­
ternational competitions," he 
said. "We must consider that 
this is the tip of the iceberg." 
Drew Harrison, a Canadian 
rowing coach, said: "so much 
sponsors' money is involved. So 
much depends on getting the 
highest performance, that a 
small percentage of people will 
always try and hope to get 
away with it. Money always 
talks." 
The Johnson revelation · rocked the Games, which until 
then had been celebrating mul­
timedal sweeps by athletes like 
swimmers Kristin Otto of East 
Germany and Matt Biondi of 
the United States. 
Johnson's gold medal went, 
instead, to rival Carl Lewis, 
who finished second in the 100­
meter race, and it belatedly 
kept alive Lewis' hopes of 
duplicating his 1984 four gold­
medal sweep. Lewis already 
has the long jump gold and was 
going for more in the 200 and 
the 400-meter relay. 
Lewis appeared at a church 

. 
service Tuesday mght and was upbeat, repeating a story about a dream his mother had the night before he lost to Johnson. 
"My mother had a dream ... about my (late) father. He said everything would be all right. And today, it was." 
Johnson's positive test remained on the minds of ath­letes long after the Canadian sprinter fled the Games in dis­grace, flying first to New York then to his home in Toronto. 
Roger Kingdom, the U.S. gold medalist in the 110-meter hurdles, did not see drugs as a widespread problem, but did question the testing procedure. 
"The bottle only had a screw cap on," he said. "It was not sealed.... In Los Angeles and at the trials, the bottle was sealed so there could be no tam­pering with it. Here, you could unscrew it yourself. The kind of bottle they had made it pos­sible for tampering to take place. 
"It should also be made clear that the kinds of drugs people use in sports are performance­enhancing drugs, so it is differ­ent from cocaine or heroine." 
Kingdom said it was frustrat­ing for a "clean" athlete to compete against one on drugs. "You work hard to get in shape and be the best and then some­one goes out and does it the easy way," he said. 
Wildcats

......
The Irish maintained their composure in game four and won as much by strategy as by skill, jumping off to a 6-1 lead before Northwestern fought its ·way back to a 6-6 tie. 
Notre Dame then traded points with Northwestern before pulling away to win the game 15-10 and ensure Lam­bert his birthday victory. 
"We can feel ourselves com­ing, together," said Irish assis­tant coach Patti Hagemeyer. "Our passes are improving and we're hoping we can really score big."

Future of ACHA cloudy as Kent State hockey cut

Presents A Lecture By Professor Michael Olivas Director, Institute For Higher Education Law and Governance University of Houston On "Immigration 'Reform' and Education: The Changing Legal Status of Students in the U.S." Noon Friday, September 30 Room 220 Law School Courtroom 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Assistant Sports Editor 

The future of the American Collegiate Hockey Association has yet to be determined fol­lowing Kent State's one year suspension, conference com­missioner Brian Boulac stated Monday. 
Kent State's program was suspended for a year following an alleged hazing incident ear­lier this month. That leaves just three teams--Notre Dame, Michigan-Dearborn and Lake Forest--in the conference. 
"I'm in the process of con­tacting Dearborn and Lake Forest, and we'll discuss with them the future of the confer­ence," said Boulac, who also serves as Notre Dame's assis­tant athletic director and wo­men's softball coach. "As for the future of the conference, we have to take a look at what di­rection all three schools want to go with their hockey pro­grams." 
Kent State University presi­dent Michael Schwartz an­nounced the suspension last Thursday after an investiga-
Swim teams practice at Rockne as Rolfs undergoes construction 
By ROB PIERCE Sports Writer 

"A four-and-a-half million dollar hole in the ground ... " 
That is how senior swimmer Bill Schmitz describes the cur­rent state of the Rolfs Aquatic Center at the JACC. 
An error in the original con­struction has left it unused since July and forced the men's and women's swim teams to adjust their training schedules and fight for pool time. 
According to Dennis Stark, directer of the Aquatic Center, the problem stems from im­proper caulking at the expan­sion joints, allowing water to leak out from under the pool. 
The trouble was first dis­covered in 1987, but a commit­ment to the International Spe­cial Olympics prevented repair work at that time. 
This summer, work began in late July and was expected to be completed in three weeks. However, the repairs have taken much longer than an­ticipated and have now con­flicted with the start of swim practice. 
tion concerning an off-campus event on Sept. 16. The situation involved 12 members of Kent State's hockey team taking five freshman players to the base­ment of an off-campus house, where the freshmen had their hair cut in a Mohawk style and were forced to drink a mixture of rum and beer. 
One of the freshmen had an allergic reaction to the alcohol and eventually was taken to an area hospital, where he was submitted for observation before being released. 
"The party was not an offi­cial university function... not authorized or known by any university officials or hockey team staff members," re­ported university police chief John Peach. 
Criminal charges have been filed by the city police depart­ment against the 12 team mem­bers. Five were charged with undergage consumption, and two for furnishing an intoxicat­ing liquor to minors (both first­degree misdemeanors). The other five players were charged with hazing, a fourth­degree misdemeanor. The 
The teams have been forced to share a limited pool time at the Rockne Memorial, which includes practicing from 11 
p.m. to 1 a.m. every other week. 
"The effect on our schedule has been dramatic," says Irish head coach Tim Welsh, "but the staff at the Rock has been wonderful. Everyone worked together to make the best of a difficult situation.'' 
However, some still fear ad­verse effects when the swim­mers finally are able to return to Rolfs. 
"It could have an effect," predicts junior sprinter Kath­leen Quirk, "especially on those swimming longer dis­tances. They need more pool time to build up endurance." 
"The Rock is like swimming in a bathtub," said senior back­stroker Eric Bohdan. "The depth of the pools is different, and that may cause a problem
for the freshmen who have not 
competed at Rolfs when they flip-turn at the wall." Practicing into the early morning has already become a 
players will appear in court Thursday. 
"Based on the information provided to me, I do not believe that this program is an accep­table representative of our uni­versity or of our athletic pro­gram in general," Schwartz said in his official statement. "Consequently, I have suspended the program for a year and will review the future of it at a later date." 
Kent State joined the ACHA with the league's inception two years ago. In the 1986-87 season, the Golden Flashes finished second in the confer­ence with a 7-5 regular season ACHA record. Last season, however, Kent State failed to win a conference game and slumped to an 11-26-3 overall mark. 
In the meantime, the ACHA, which thrived on its balanced competition two years ago, be­came essentially a two-team conference during the 1987-88 season. Michigan-Dearborn won the regular-season title, and Notre Dame won the post­season conference tournament. All of Lake Forest's conference 
drudgery for some team mem­bers. 
"The late hours hurt the body schedule," claims Schmitz. "After practice, the pulse rate is up and it sometimes takes two hours to wind down and fall asleep." 
But with no other alterna­tives, the team has made the most of the situation. And the wait is almost over. 
"We should open sometime next week," said Stark. "The first home meet is not until the Notre Dame Relays on Novem­ber 4th." 
The homecoming cannot ar­rive soon enough for the swim­mers. They will all be ready to dive right in. 


The Observer 
...........................~ 
wins came against Kent State, as the Foresters posted an 0-8-1 record against Notre Dame and Dearborn. 
The conference was estab­lished on June 4, 1986, under the notion that each of the member schools shared similar philosophies educationally, athletically and financially. At the time, Notre Dame was not offering hockey scholarships, but that position has since changed. Starting this season, Notre Dame is offering 10 hockey scholarships in the next four years. 
Dearborn also has shown signs of wanting to upgrade its program, but as an NAIA school, that would involve a restructuring of its entire ath­letic department. Lake Forest currently competes at the Divi­sion III level. 
Further complicating mat­ters for the ACHA, the 1988-89 post-season tournament is scheduled to be held at Kent State on March 3-4. 
"We've got three teams, and we know who the two strongest teams are, or at least we think· we know," said Notre Dame co­ach Ric Schafer, who guided 
his team to a best-ever 27-4-2 
record last season. "The weekend (of the tournament) is the weekend of spring break. It wouldn't matter to me if it's carried off or not. I'd just as soon go recruiting." 
Notre Dame has games scheduled against Kent State on Nov. 4-5 and Feb. 17-18. Schafer indicated that it would not be much of a problem ad­justing his team's schedule. 
"It may mean an extra game with Merrimack, which we wouldn't mind, and it may mean two extra games with Dearborn," the second-year Irish coach said.

Ho: a handy example of what's right 1n sports 
One look at the Chicago Tribune headline told all that was wrong in sports. 
The fastest man in the world used drugs. 
One half hour of conversation in Cavanaugh's par­lor told all that was right in sports. 
Here was a hard-working student and a hard­working placekicker who was polite, down-to-earth, intelligent and wanted to spend his life helping other people. 
Oh yeah, and he was probably mentioned in every newspaper in the country on September 11 after kicking four field goals, the last of which put the winning points on the board for the Irish in their season opener. 
The world is a different place now, three weeks later, for Reggie Ho. Or is it? 
The bright lights of TV cameras have been inces­sant. But they don't blind Ho, who is still, like he was three weeks ago, a top pre-med student and an "average guy." 
But for an average guy, he sure is stirring up a lot of attention. The reasons are simple. He ac­counted for 19 of Notre Dame's first 25 points on the season. He is a walk-on. He works hard. He is excessively polite. He is a model student. 
And he looks a little different on the field. 
"One person I know gave me a theory on why all 
this is happening," says Ho. "He said that everyone 
who becomes famous has some sort of gimmick to them, something that sets them apart. For Joe Mon­tana it was his 'luck.' For me, it's that I'm small. I'm not the average size of a football player. People tell me I look like a little kid out there and I guess that is kind of appealing to the crowd." 
And appealing to Sports Illustrated which did a story on Ho in last week's issue. And appealing to the CBS Morning News show which interviewed Ho live via satellite from New York last Friday.

While the lights of the camera don't blind him, they do at times leave him a little uneasy. He is a reluctant hero. He could never think of being on scholarship and taking money from the University. In post-game interviews he can be heard singing the praises of Tim Grunhard and Pete Graham, who snap and hold the ball Ho kicks through the uprights. 
"It was probably my fault," said Ho when describing a mishandled snap during a field goal attempt at Michigan State. 
He didn't call the signals, snap the ball or try to 
catch it. But it was probably his fault. That reaction is consistent with the persona of Reggie Ho, who is himself the model of consistency. Don't take too much credit ·and don't avoid the blame. Practice every day, sun, rain or snow. Go to the library after practice. Line up for a kick the same way every . time. And take any opportunity to say how honored you are to be playing for the same school as Knute Rockne, George Gipp, seven Reisman Trophy win­
ners, Tim Grunhard and Pete Graham. 
He's not acting. He means it. Though his polite 
attempts to distract attention from himself are 
repetitive, they are refreshing in an age when so 
many athletes think they have something coming 
to them solely because they are atheletes. 
It is ironic that the same guy who will probably 
need a pedestal to accept post-season accolades is 
the first to avoid the pedestal society is giving him 
right now. 

But Reggie Ho knows his roles--kick field goals 
and study hard. The first will help Notre Dame win 
and the second will help him become a doctor. 
That's all he wants. 
Oh, there's one more goal. 
"Instead of hearing 'Hey, that's Reggie Ho, the 
kicker,' I'd like to hear 'Hey that's Reggie Ho, Kevin 
Thomas' roommate. 
He just never stops.
