Pathologists examine shuttle crew remains, sea search continues 
AMMiated PrHS 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. ­Pathologists yesterday examined remains of Challenger's crew, sources reported, while high winds and seas hampered the ocean search for more body parts and debris such as data tapes that might pr~JVide clues to the disaster. 
Some remains and crew cabin wreckage were brought ashore secretly Saturday night by the Navy salvage ship USS preserver, which entered port without running lights, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. · 
In announcing Sunday that the cabin debris and remains had been found on the ocean floor, NASA did not say whether anything had been recovered. The agency said it would respect family wishes and not comment again until the opera­tion was completed. 

NASA spokesman said nothing yesterday. The Navy, which is con­ducting the search, said the 213­foot Preserver was at the scene where the cabin debris was found but declined to say whether divers were on the ocean floor. 
Recovering cabin wreckage and body remains depends on weather and sea conditions, NASA said, and could take days. The search was slowed yesterday by winds up to 20 mph and waves as high as eight feet. 

Private boats were barred from an area two miles around the search site and private planes were kept five miles away. Sections of the cabin were found approximately 18 miles northeast of Cape Canaveral at a depth of 100 feet. 
Five men and two women died in the fiery explosion 73 seconds after Challenger left its launch pad here Jan. 28. 
Data tapes that were in the cabin could shed light on the cause of the explosion, but it was not known how well the tapes survived. 
The sources did not know if re­mains of all seven had been located. They said recovered body parts had been taken to a hospital at Patrick Air Force Base, 25 miles south of here, where they were ex­amined yesterday by forensic ex­perts from the Armed Forces In­stitute of Pathology. 
The condition of the bodies was not known by the sources, but they said "we're talking about remains, not bodies." 
The examinations were not only

Test turnS tables on 200,000 Texas teachers 
Associated Press 
AUSTIN, Texas -Approximate­ly 200,000 teachers, principals and other Texas aducators faced their own no-pass no-play rule yesterday as they took a test to determine whether they read and write well enough to keep their jobs. 
Texas approved a public school reform law in 1984, joining Arkan­sas and Georgia in requiring teachers and other school officials to take literacy tests. 
The measure included a no-pass no-play rule that bars students from extracurricular activities if they fail any class. 
Texan educators who don't pass the test by June 30 will lose their teaching certificates and jobs. A se­cond test for those who failed the first exam will be given June 28. 
National Computer Systems Inc., an Iowa testing company, will grade the exams and teachers will be told by May 1 only if they pass or fail. 
State education officials predicted approximately 10,000 teachers would fail the first test. The commissioner of education may grant a one-year emergency waiver to teachers who fail both tests, but any other appeals would have to be made through the courts. 

Most educators said the test -55 multiple choice questions, 30 on writing skills, and a 150-work essay -was easy. The passing grade is 75 percent. 
"Piece of cake," said fourth­grade teacher Patti Turman of Austin, the first to finish, "I feel a lot of my students could have answered a lot of those questions.'' 
Students had the day off while their teachers were tested. 
"Honestly, I don't see how a per­son who fails this test could have ever gotten a degree at any college," said A1 Martin, a Texas Education Agency employee. 
Many teachers were insulted at taking a test to keep their jobs. 
State teaching certificates were issued for a lifetime before the 1984 law. 
"After graduating from college and taking all those tests, why go back and take and eight-grade test?" asked Houston high school teacher Linda Savell. 
Some teachers wore protest but­tons or stickers yesterday, and special education teacher Judy Boston collected names on a protest petition outside Austin High School. 
One teacher was exempted from the test Friday when State District Judge R.L. Eschenburg ruled she had earned her teaching certificate before the reform law was passed. 
University's highest honor awarded to trustee, wife 

Special to Tbe Observer 
Notre Dame Board of Trustees Chairman Thomas Carney and his wife, Mary Elizabeth of Lake Forest, Ill., have been awarded Notre Dame's 1986 Laetare Medal, University President Father Theodore Hesburgh announced recently. 
The medal is the University's highest honor and the oldest award given to American Catholics. 
In announcing the honor, Hesburgh noted that Carney, presi­dent of Metatech Corporation in Northbrook, Ill., has had almost every possible relationship with Notre Dame since he graduated from the University with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering in 1937. 
"As a student, an alumnus, a parent of students, a benefactor, a counselor, a lecturer, a trustee and finally as chairman of the board, Tom Carney has consistently ex­emplified the qualities and values Notre Dame holds dearest," Hesburgh said. 
Following his graduation from Notre Dame, Carney earned master's and doctoral degrees in organic chemistry from Penn­sylvania State University and did post-doctoral work in medicinal chemistry at the University of Wisconsin. Before forming Metatech Corporation in 1976, he had spent more than 35 years in the pharmaceutical industry's research, development, planning, operations and administration. 
Carney's work at the Eli Lilly and G.D. Searle companies was in­strumental in the developme'nt of many of the drugs which have af­fected 20th century life, including a wide variety of antibiotics, an­tihistamines, barbituates, analgesics, cancer chemotherapies and anesthetics. At Metatech he is 
developing new instruments and devices for use in the medical field.

Root of marijuana problem stems from outlaw of forbidden weed 
The recent raids on student dorm rooms by Notre 
Dame Security and subsequent Observer articles about 
drugs on campus have prompted dismay on the part of 
many students. "I didn't know that kind of stuff went 
on here," has been a typical comment. 
But of course, "that kind of stuff" goes on here, and 
why shouldn't it? According to an August 1985 U.S. 
News and World Report article, the government 
estimates that more than one in 10 Americans use 
marijuana. Notre Dame and Saint Mary's are not 
quite so isolated as to be devoid of marijuana users. 
More serious drugs such as cocaine also can be found 
around campus, but marijuana probably is most 
prevalent. 
But the recent investigations of student rooms for evidence of drug use or selling bring into question the same old debate over making the use of marijuana legal. Although legalizing marijuana would be the best method of decreasing drug use in America, our country's historically conservative mind-set, which seems determined to force human nature to change for the better, as usual is the main obstacle blocking any constructive advancements in the eradication of drug problems in the United States. 
One obvious reason for legalizing marijuana, whose 1984 retail value as a homegrown crop the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws estimates at more than $16 billion, is the increased tax revenues. But in legalizing marijuana, the government would gain control over a much more crucial area than money in the fight against drug use. It would be in a position to influence drug users where it counts the most -in their very attitudes toward the use of drugs. 
If marijuana were legal, then the government would be able to regulate its quality and sell it much like a prescription drug, thus requiring that people wishing to purchase marijuana attend drug education seminars before theyweredlowed to buy the drug. In this way, users would be presented with information with which they could decide for themselves whether the health hazards of marijuana were severe enough to give up the drug. 
Last summer Attorney General Edwin Meese head­ed a nationwide raid on marijuana plantations, destroying less than one-fifth of the U.S. pot crop. With the great demand in this country, marijuana growers won't be idle long. They will find a way to supply the drug as long as there are profits to be made. Similarly, the United States has been putting pressure on Latin American countries to combat drug shipments from their countries to the U.S., but leaders of these countries rightly complain that the problem is rooted in Americans' desire to buy the drugs, not in the producers who are merely answering a demand.

That's why tactics like Meese's are wrong. Americans have shown a historical tendency in trying to force certain ways of acting on their countrymen without regard to the subtleties of human behavior. Prohibition didn't work; people are going to drink despite any arbitrary man-made constraint such as a law. Many people do not view abortion as murder; women have had abortions when it was illegal and they still continue to do so. 
The point is that people are going to do what they're going to do. If someone is genuinely concerned with changing someone else's behavior for his betterment or the betterment of society, merely outlawing an ac­tion will only provoke stubborn resistance in those who feel that the right to make their own decisions is being taken away. Consequently, the best anyone can do to redirect someone else's habits is to make educa­tional information available and let others make their own choices. 
Current government policy of trying to clip the drug problem at the flower instead of the roots is typical of a more pervasive national attitude. Ultimately, a per­son is going to have to decide for himself how to con­duct his life. In trying to eliminate marijuana crops, Meese is refusing to face the problem in a practical manner. When will Americans see that the long-term answer to curbing drug use lies not in the elimination of the means but in the non-forcible remodeling of the desire?

No abortions or no support for school, says Cardinal 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York has threatened to drop its support of the New York Medical College unless two city hospitals affiliated with the school stop performing abortions, according to reports published yesterday. 
Cardinal John O'Connor, the ar­chbishop of New York, said in an interview with The New York Times that if Lincoln and Metropolitan hospitals did not stop performing abortions, the Valhalla-based college either would have to give upits$24 million a year contract to supply them with medical services or drop its ties with the archdiocese. 
The archdiocese saved the college from financial failure eight years ago. 
With more than 700 students, New York Medical College is the third largest private medical school in the country. It provides medical services to more than 35 hospitals in the metropolitan area, many of them Catholic insitutions, and was ranked as Westchester County's 24th largest employer in 1982. 
The chairman of the college's board of trustees, John Castle, declined comment on the cardinal's statement.

Author claims feminism increases hardships for modem-day women 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Somewhere in the midst of marrying, having four children and a miscarriage, teaching college and working at a think tank, Sylvia Ann Hewlett decided feminism hadn't made life easier for the 1980s woman. 
So she added to her workload. She wrote a book. 
In "A Lesser Life: The Myth of Women's Liberation in America," Hewlett pleads the case of middle­aged women who are divorced and cast adrift without alimony, and of young women who are forced to juggle jobs and children. 
She blames the American social system for these problems, but she also blames an unlikely villain: the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s, which she says wasted effort on the Equal Rights Amend­ment and radical causes while giv­ing short shrift to day care and other family issues. 

Award 
continuedfrom page 1 
Carney, author of several articles and essays, has written three books. 
Carney has received several other honors at Notre Dame, including election as president of the national Alumni Association, membership in the Advisory Council for Science 
and  of  Engineering,  centennial  
awards  from  the  Colleges  of  
Science  and  Engineering,  and  


Mary Elizabeth and Thomas Carney 
honorary doctor of law degree awarded in 1969, the Alumni Association's Sorin Award, and designation as the Nieuwland Lec­turer at the University. 
A member of Notre Dame's Board 
of Trustees since the establishment 
of that body in 1967, Carney was 
elected chairman in 1982. 
Carney married Mary Elizabeth 
McGuire on Oct. 3, 1942. They 
have four children, Thomas Jr., 
Sheila, James and Janet, all of 
whom have graduated from Notre 
Dame. Mrs. Carney is a native of 
Brazil, Ind., and grew up in in­
dianapolis. She has been active in 
the League of Women Voters and 
has served as president of the Lake 
Forest and Lake County units. 
She has been a member of the 
lake Forest Caucus and serves on 
the board of the Gorton Communi­
ty Center. Mrs. Carney has, with 
her husband, served as hostesss to a 
wide variety of official functions at 
the University over many years. 
"She has been Notre Dame's first 
lady for the past four years." said 
Hesburgh. 
The Laetare Medal is so named 
because it recipient is announced 
each year on Laetare Sunday, the 
fourth Sunday of Lent in the 
Church calendar. Established in 
1883, the medal was conceived as 
an American version of the 
"Golden Rose," an ancient papal 
honor. 
Only three other couples are among the 108 men and women who have received the Laetare Medal. 
Hewlett claims to be a feminist, but acknowledges many women's leaders have been "quite hostile toward the book," published by William Morrow. 
Ms. magazine editor Robin Morgan, for example, panned Hewlett's ''tediously familiar right­wing anti-feminist accusations... Hewlett's premise -that the U.S. movement is 'anti-motherhood'-is true in terms of fabricated media image but false in terms of reality." 
But Hewlett notes the case of a California woman who tried un­successfully to return to her bank job 25 months after giving birth. The woman has sued; opposing her suit are the bank · and the National Organization for Women, which argues that women should not receive special treatment. 
"Does NOW realize that women, are not men? It is true, only women can have babies; it is both the privilege and the responsibility of the female sex," Hewlett writes.

Professor McGuire was formerly Vice President--Planning of the University of CalHomia Statewide System, Dean of the College of Commerce and Business Administration, University of Illinois, Urbana, and Dean of the School of Business, the University of Kansas, Lawrence. 
"To ignore this biological dif­ference, as many American feminists chose to do, is to commit a double folly." 
Children are victimized, she says. Ifa mother stays home because of a lack of affordable day care, the family's circumstances suffer; more often, both parents are forced to work, and the children are passed along a network of babysitters, friends and grandparents. 
The livlihoods of women also suffer, according to Hewlett. 
Ninety percent of women have children during their lifetimes, but more than 60 percent of those who work have no maternity leave; most have to leave the work force for some period after they give birth, often stunting careers that had just begun to flower, she says. 
She cites statistics indicating the gap between the earnings of men and women can be pinned to family responsibilities .

astronauts were burned to death, poisoned by fumes, died from sud­dent loss cabin pressure, were killed by flying debris or by impact with the water, or drowned. 
Exact cause of death might be difficult because the bodies have been in the water for six weeks and may have been the victims of sea scavengers. 
Those killed in the accident were commander Richard Scobee, pilot Michael Smith, Judith Resnik, Ellison Onizuka, Ronald McNair, Gregory Jarvis and Christa McAuliffe, a New Hampshire schoolteacher who was flying as NASA's first "ordinary citizen" in space. 
The sources also reported several of the crew members' private ef­fects had been recovered, including personal tape recorders on which they had planned to record their impression of the flight. 
The crew cabin is a 2,525-cubic­foot, three-level structure made of 2,219 aluminum alloy plates welded together to create a pressure-tight vesset. It has no special rein­forcements to better withstand the force of an explosion, but it is stronger than much of the fuselage because it is a single welded unit.

NO alumnus to discuss minority issues today 
ByJOEMARXEY 
StaffReporter 

Percy A. Pierre, 1961 graduate of Notre Dame and president of Prarie View A & M University since 1983, will discuss South African apartheid and minority issues on campus today. 
Pierre, who will speak at 4 
p.m. at the Hayes-Healy Auditorium, also will discuss his career in education, govern­ment, and engineering since his graduation from Notre Dame. 
Pierre, whose presentation is titled "Issues in Higher Educa­tion," is speaking as part of the Distinguished Alumni Lecture Series. 
With more than 20 years of experience in engineering educa­tion and research, university and government administration, and technical and policy ad­ministration, Pierre's lecture should prove to be interesting and thought provoking, accor­ding to Ed Lenard, Student-Alumni Relations Group 
(SARG) member and organizer 
of the series. 
According to Lenard, the idea for the Distinguished Alumni Lecture Series "developed last year when we were thinking of activities that SARG and stu­dent government could combine efforts in." 

The lecture series was adopted with the intention of bringing noted alumni in contact with students, he said. "There are so many prominent alumni out i 
.,
there," said Lenard. "The alum­

I
ni are very helpful and en­.. 
.. 
I
thusiastic about the series, 

"1
generally because they like to come back and share with the students," he added. 
Dr. Pierre, who is known for his influence in shaping the future of engineering education, has kept in close contact with Notre Dame, Lenard said. Pierre is a former member of Notre Dame's faculty and serves on the Board of Trustees.

MARILYN BENCHIK 
features .writer 
Imagine a serene, tropical sunset, , or gliding down a mountain full of fresh fallen snow. These visions of
r 
spring vacations offer a reprievet 
r· 
for students during the bleak In­diana winter. 
There are three spring break trips that the Student Activities Board is planning right now. One excursion includes Breckenridge, Colo., which is currently filled with the maximum of 32 people, according to representative for the SErvices Commission, Don Dickinson. 
The other two trips include Daytona Beach and Fort Lauder­dale. 
"The ski trip runs at $249 and this includes lodging and lift tickets to Copper Mountain, Araphoe Basin, and Keystone," commented Dickinson. Each of these areas are at most 25 minutes from Vale,a dn the shuttle service is provided in the cost of the total ticket price. 
The only major setback to think of is that transportation is not in­cluded in the package. "Really that's no problem because Greyhound is running a special for college students during their respec­tive breaks. It only costs $99 to get there by bus," added Dickinson. 
"As far as making a profit is con­cerned, we recouped our in­vestments which means we broke even. That's no problem because we're a non-profit organization," Dickinson added. 
At this time, the Daytona and Fort Lauderdale trips have 45 and 30 vacationers scheduled respec­tively. According to Dickinson about 100 people will ultimately go to Daytona while the total for Fort Lauderdale will reach approx­imately 180. 
"It's such a headache for us because the majority of the people will wait until the last minute before deciding whether or not they want to go. This year the deadline for each of these trips is Feb. 28," said Dickinson. 
The Daytona trip is $129 if the student drives, and $209 if he or she decided to take the round trip bus. The Fort Lauderdale trip is $225 without the bus and $309 with it. 
"Personally I think that Fort Lauderdale is overrated. Daytona is more economical and in Daytone there is 23 miles of beach whereas in Fort Lauderdale there is only three miles," commented Dickin­son.· 
Dickinson added that the Car­riage House Hotel, where the Daytona tourists will be lodged, is right in the center of the 23 mile long strip. Every other day students have the opportunity to visit Disney World. Fishing excursions are also being planned in and around Orlando. 
"We have the opportunity to run more activities with the Lauderdale group because the Alumni support is greater there," said Dickinson. This group will lodge at the Riviera, which is on the beach. 
In addition to Easter Week ser­vices, there will be a bike tour of the Everglades, and a notre Dame and Saint Mary's party on the hotel grounds or at Penrods. An Inter­Costal cruise is also scheduled, ac­cording to Dickinson. 
"The advantages of the SAB trip as opposed to traveling through a travel agency are that the prices of these trips are cheaper than most agencies. You know what the hotel and the arrangements are months in advance, and you are with peo­ple from the same school," added Dickinson. 
Gloria Eleuteri, a junior at Saint Mary's won a trip to Daytona last year. "I had a great time. I found everything to be really up to par as far as accomodations were con­cerned!' Chris Fortin, another Saint Mary's junior summed up her sentiments with, "If I ever get the chance to go to Daytona again, baby I'm there!" 
Steve Morita, a Notre Dame 
sophomore, who went on the Fort 
Lauderdale trip last year had this to 
say. "I really had a great time. The 
hotel wasn't the most luxurious int 
he world, but then I didn't go to 
Florida to sleep,." 
Ann DuCharme, a senior at 
Notre Dame offered an opposing 
view. "I didn't go to Lauderdale on 
the same trip as everyone else, but I 
visited the hotel where some of my 
friends were on the SAB trip. It was 
really gross; there was beer, it 
wasn't comfortable, and there were

New drinking age 
won't hinder fun in Florida 
SHEILA McDANIEL 
features writer 

With spring break less than two weeks away, it's time to start pack­ing those shorts and shades. But if you're going to Florida, don't forget your "21" ID. 
In response to threats from the federal government to cut highway funds by 10 percent, Florida, like most other states, has raised its legal drinking age to 21. However, Florid2 is phasing in the law over a two-year span. In other words, if your 19th birthday was before July 1, 1985, you will not be subject to the law this spring break. 
This exemption clause does not just apply to Florida residents; if you will be be an out-of-state visitor to the Sunshine State's beaches and bars, you also qualify for the exemption. 
For those not included in the "grandfather clause,, don't despair. Daytona Beach has not forgotten you. This renowned spr­ing break party city is hosting the first annual National Collegiate Sports Festival -four weeks of

athletic competition involving students from the entire United States. According to NCSF's direc­tor of events, Mike May, this tour­nament is an important attempt to change the image of spring break in Daytona Beach. 
The sports wants to capitalize on the national trend toward fitness, May said. "We're not purists," he added, "But there are other fun things to do in Daytona Beach besides the beach and the beer." 
Non-alcohol and non-tobacco­related organizations will sponsor competition in nine sports: basket­ball, flag football, golf, rugby, run­ning, sailing, softball, ultimate frisbee, and volleyball. All events will take place either on the beach or within a 10-minute car or public transportation ride from it. 
"Daytona Beach is trying to establish itself as a 'sports capital,' " 
said May. "Here's a chance for the average studP.nt, who's a pretty good athlete, to challenge other universities in a national competi­tion. Here's the one place ­

Daytona Beach." 

The NCSF will take place from March I 0 to April 4, typically the most concentrated weeks of spring break. Since Notre Dame's break falls during the third week, Domers can challenge schools like Santa Clara (Calif.), the universities of Florida, Wisconsin and Tennessee, Virginia Tech, Brown, Cornell, Harvard, Kent State, Ohio State, Ohio University, Bowling Green, and even Slippery Rock State University (Penn.). 
Winners of the weekly competi­tions will return to Florida for the NCSF Championships. The final contest will be held either April 5 and 6, early June or early September. 
For all those Florida sun seekers and sports enthusiasts under 21 or over, Daytona Beach is providing an opportunity for fun in the sun and a chance to be a national sports champion. Those interested in com­peting in the NCSF should call 8­800-244-NCSF for more informa­tion. 

Special to The Observer 
Spring Break vacationers who couldn't decide whether to go to a snow-covered mountain ski resort or to a sunny beach will have the opportunity to do both when Busch CitySki brings "snow" skiing to Miami Beach and Daytona Beach during the last two weeks of Mar­ch. 
They'll be able to experience the thrill of snow skiing without leav­ing the Sunshine State, or even straying far from the warm sand and surf, when areas in Daytona Beach and Miami Beach are transformed into "Busch Moun­tain" ski slopes for Busch CitySki. 
Hundreds of tons of crushed ice will be used to build slopes in Miami Beach on March 18 and 19, and in Daytona Beach on March 25, 26, and 27. 
Busch CitySki features open ski­ing for the public, the use of equip­ment and professional instruction-­all provided free of charge com­pliments of Busch beer and the cities of Daytona Beach and Miami Beach. 
Skiing equipment (or both events will be provided by the Killington Mountain ski area in Vermont. 
The Busch CitySki series was developed in 1984 by World Sports Promotions, Inc., based in Man­chester Village, Vt. Busch CitySki began with events in downtown Boston and Albany, N.y. Those successes mspired return engagements and an expanded 1985-86 tour with events in Atlan­ta, Chicago, Rochester, St. Louis, Columbus, and now Daytona Beach and Miami Beach. 
The Busch CitySki slopes in Daytona Beach and Miami Beach will be constructed with shaved ice. The ice will be delivered in the form of 300-pound blocks and then shav­ed and crushed and turned into "Busch Mountain" by snowmaking experts from World Sports Promo­tions. The Miami Beach event will be held on the public beach near the intersection of Ocean Drive and 14th Court. In1 Daytona Beach, the event will be held on a site close to the beach near the 700 block of Atlantic Boulevard.

Florida isn't the only place to spend break 
LISA YOUNG 
Features senior staff 
Aaaaah . . . Spring Break. 
Thoughts of Daytona Beach and 
Fort Lauderdale come to mind. 
Thousands of college students flock to Florida every year. But you want to be different don't you? You're not a crowd follower. 
Can't imagine break without a beach? Try Myrtle Beach or the South Pares. Need to see a big city again? Boston could prove an ex­citing vacation. Some suggestions follow for planning a slightly out of the ordinary break. Whichever you chose, plan early. And of course, have fun. 
South Padre Island, Tex. 
Located just off the southeast coast 
of Texas, this 110 mile long island 
is the longest isle in the U.S. Stret­
ching from Corpus Christi to Port 
Isabel, it is hailed by travel 
brochures as a "top coastal vaca­
tion spot." Spring temperatures are 
usually in the 70s-80s. 
Miles of sunny beaches are the 
main attraction, but Padre offers 
much, much more. Options for 
daytime fun include deep sea 
fishing and excursions to Mexico. 
Mexico is within an hour's drive. 
Here you'll find inexpensive liquor 
and other goods. 
Remember, however, that it is il­
legal to transport alcohol across the 
border. Island Sailboat Rentals of­
fer charters for $12-25 an hour. A 
beach travel tip: leave your metal 
detector at home. They became il­
legal after a team of treasure 
trackers discovered lost treasure 
worth $3 million. For those of you 
who are reptile fanatics, you might 
want to visit Port Isabel, home of a 
private collection of giant sea 
turtles. 
Nightime fun shouldn't be hard to finj:the Texas drinking age is still 
19. Students also find it amusing that alcoholic beverages are legal in moving automobiles. 
Flights to the Padres are current­ly running about $200, depending on airline, time of departure, and time of reservation. Air time is ap­proximately four hours. Airports are located in Brownsville and Cor­pus Christi, and limousine service runs to South Padre. If you choose to drive, it will probably take about a day. 
Hotels, motels and condos are available in about every price range. Popular among ND students are the Yacht Club Hotel ($38-58 a night) and the Tiki Condominiums ($60-70 a night). 
Myrtle Beach, S.C. 
Myrtle Beach is the focal point of the Grand Strand, a 55-mile strip of beach. It is called both the "Sun Fun Capital" and the "Camping Capital of the World." 

The average high temperatures for March to May are in the 70s, accompanied by plenty of sun­shine. 
The city ·is an endless strip of amusement parks, wild animal kingdoms, and miniature golf courses. There are also 26 prestigious gold courses within a half hour of the city. 
Nightlife closely resembles the Lauderdale scene. Bars, nightclubs, and motel parties abound. The drinking age used to be 18 for beer and wine, but legislation has been pushing it back yearly until it reaches 21. 
Flights to Myrtle Beach are ap­proximately $158, again depending on various factors. South Bend to Myrtle Beach driving time is about 14 hours, considerably shorter than even Dayton. 
Bring your tent and build camp­fires at one of the many cam­pgrounds in the "Camping Capital of the World." If you're not quite so outdoorsy, lodgings range from the Econo Lodge ($16 a night) to the Arcadian Condos (2 bedroom, $480 a week). 
Boston, Mass. 

If a tan isn't your main concern, and you don't mind Haaahvaaad accents, spring break in Boston of­fers as much excitement as any tropical paradise. Boston has enough sight s to keep vacationers busy for months. 
Being college students on break, the first thing you'll want to do is v1s1t other college campuses. Boston University, Boston College, Harvard, MIT, Stonehill College, and Holy Cross are among the many nearby colleges. Visit old friends, or make some new. Who knows, maybe you'll acquire some free accomodations. 
Boston contains plenty of history, if you're so inclined to spend your break. Spring temps average in the 60s, perfect for sightseeing. Boston, as a cultural center, offers a Chinatown, museums, aquariums, theater, and music opportunities. 
Shoppers should definitely visit Quincy Market, an 18th century dock building converted into mall. It is also hailed as the ...,.1,tPrr of the city's nightlife. Massachusetts drinking age is 21). Especially recommended is Houlihan's. Other recommenda­tions include Jack's and the Oxford Ale House, for mingling with the Ivy League type. TV buffs might want to visit Cheers; it seems that the outside is much more authentic than the inside. No Names is a seafood restaurant with an unusual twist. You are requested to bring your own beverages. Understandably, there is often a wait to get it. 
Tennis burrs may want to catch the Virginia Slims of Roston Tennis Championships held at Boston University near the end of March. 
Flights to Boston are about $250 (a comparison price) and take under two hours. Driving time between the Dome and Boston is about 17 hours. 
As these alternatives suggest, sometimes the most fun isn't found in following the crowd.

Men's tennis sweeps three matches 
By PETE S.KIKO 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's tennis team tuned up for its spring trip to texas by impressively disposing of three opponents this weekend at the ACC. 
The Irish defeated Illinois-Chicago, 8-1; Wisconsin-Oshkosh, 9-0; and Ohio, 6-3. The victories bring the team's total record to 8-2, and both the meet and the team's progress thus far have Head Coach Tom Fallon smiling. 
"I was quite pleased with the meet overall," said the veteran coach, "especially the win over Ohio. They play in a tough con­ference and are always near the top of it." 
Fallon is getting good play from his young team so far, and he credits the freshmen for taking on a tough role and stepping into varsity positions. 
"We're young. and that was a question mark early on," he said. "But our team, especially the freshmen, have proven that they can play with quality, division one teams. We're really looking for­ward to going down to San Antonio next week." 
Notre Dame travels to Texas next week to take on nationally ranked teams, and Fallon is confident that the team's play of late is an indica­tion of good things to come. 
Number one singles player Dan Walsh had a successful meet, winn­ing two singles matches and team­ing with sophomore Paul Daggs to defeat an Oshkosh doubles team. In his singles match against Ohio. Walsh split the first two sets. Nor­mally, a third set would be played to decide the outcome, but last weekend the four teams in the meet agreed to experiment with using a 12-point tiebreaker instead of a whole new set. Although he won his match, Walsh does not like the idea.

Questions about these posit1ons should be d1rected to Dennis Corrigan at The Observer office. Personal statements and resumes ore due Thursday. March 13. ot7p.m. 
"No, I'm not thrilled with it," said the sophomore. "I don't think that the players will give it too much support; I thing they'd want 
.to see the match played out. But I 
guess it's up to the coaches whether 
it becomes permanent or not." 
Currently, the idea is on a ·trial basis and its permanence is being considered by the NCAA. Fallon is in favor of the proposed ruling, mostly because of the amount of time that is saved when it is im­plemented. 
"Our match against Indiana (earlier this year) took five hours to play," added Fallon. "This weekend, the meet averaged between three and three and a half hours. Playing in this climate, where it gets dark early, some of these matches have to be finished by the light of the cars' headlights. I think this idea is a step in the right direction of lessening the length of college meets." 
The Irish took to the idea of playing a tiebreaker instead of a third set pretty well last weekend. Notre Dame players won four out of five of them against Ohio.

The Irish were down 4-0 before Tom Mooney put them on the board in the first period. John Welsh scored twice for .Notre Dame in the second but the Bisons scored three of their own in the period. Erik Grafstrom scored twice in the final stanza to match scores by Notre Dame's Bob Bilton and Waldbillig to make the final9-5.

Volleyball Club splits pair 
The men's Volleyball Club pulled another Jekyl and Hyde routine last week, defeating Miami (ohio) while losing to IUPU-Fort Wayne. 
On Wednesday the Irish traveled to Fort Wayne to take on the 12th-ranked Mastadons. It was a rough homecoming for Bill Anderson, Notre Dame's head coach, as his former team dumped the 
Irish in three straight games.  
But  the  team  regrouped  on  Friday  against  
Miami, beating the Redskins  15-18, 15-6, 13-15,  
15-3.  

"When we play together we do alright," said Club President Ed Abt. "It's a question now of get­ting it together at the end of the season." 
There is no better time than now for more con­sistent play from the team. The Irish are fighting to repeat as club-level champions of the Midwest In­tercollegiate Volleyball Association. Early season losses to Wisconsin and Calvin College have hurt the team's chances, but it plans revenge in upcom­ing games this week. 
The club was to travel to Grand Rapids, Mich. last night to take on Calvin College. On Saturday, 

Pete Gegen 
Club Corner 
the Irish will take on the Badgers in Madison. . 
"Tht;re is nothing I would like better than to beat Wisconsin," said Abt. "Those earlier games (against Calvin and Wisconsin) should not have even been close." 
Sandwiched between those two road contests is a match against Ball State at the ACC Pit. This is a prime opportunity to see the Irish face the Car­dinals, who are ranked in the Top Twenty. The match begins at 7:30. 
The only other club in action this week is the Gymnastics Club, which will be traveling to Eastern Michigan this week for a meet. Saturday's home meet against Miami was postponed.
