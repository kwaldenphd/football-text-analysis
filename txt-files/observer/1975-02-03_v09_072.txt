To help alleviate hunger 

Hesburgh calls for Senate lobby 
by Kathy Mills Staff Reporter 

Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, president of the University announced yesterday plans for forming a national anti­hunger lobby to spark government action toward allieviating the world food crisis though a major increase in U.S. food aid. 
The announcement came during the homily of a mass for the hungry held in the A.C.C. 
The Mass was one part of Anti-Hunger Day, held at the Athletic and Convocation Center. Other portions of the day's program included an address by Senator Richard Clark <D.-Iowa) and a rice and tea supper.

Results of poll on new fall calendar to be released 
by Jeff Arndt 
Staff Reporter 
Notre Dame Student Govern­ment is conducting a random survey of student and faculty on the new fall academic calendar 
which marked the earliest start of classes in University history. The results of the poll should be released by the end of next week. 
James Ambrose, director of the opinion study, stated that a computer program arrived at a random sample of 7 per cent of the student body who received the questionnaire. This number in­cluded both undergraduate and graduate students, excluding only those part-time students with two or three credit hours. 
About 37 per cent of the potential respondents live off-campus, corresponding with the . actual percentage of the student body who reside there. This method of selection helps to insure a more accurate gauging of student opinion by the survey. 
A separate poll was also distributed to faculty members. Similar processes were used to obtain a random sample of 20 per cent of the faculty. ·

Student apathy blamed for Hesburgh veto 
by Robert Jacques Staff Reporter 
Last Wednesday University President Theodore M. Hesburgh vetoed tile Student Life Council's proposed revision of the Univer­sity's sexuality rule. The proposal would have placed into the hands of the hall rectors the con­sideration of cases of sexual misconduct which were not "flagrant, perverse, or repeated after previous warning." 
Paul Conway, a faculty member of the SLC, said that all the members on the council knew that the veto was imminent. He added, "Everyone was fed up with the issue. They passed the best compromise they could come up with." 
Conway stated that the Council was so frustrated, especially during the last two of the four sessions during which the issue was considered, that he doubts a new proposal to modify the present sexual code can come in one of the meetings in the near future. 
He asserted that half of the problem was student apathy. "The SLC was not and is not sure of student body backing. The students don't care. There has been no rallying of support behind a student position." 
Conway stated that if students were to openly express their desire to see the sex code changed, Fr. Hesburgh might be more inclined to compromise. While Conway was uncertain as to whether Hesburgh would compromise on this issue, he cited examples when the President did so. 
These include his consent as a member of the amnesty board not to demand absolute clemency for all draft evaders. "He can reach a compromise if it is in the bset interest of the situation," Conway added. 
Looking to the future, Conway sees a time when student organizations such as the SLC and the student government will have power on the same level as the University president, limited only by the Board of Trustees. "This will only come about," he added, "if the students take interest in student government and life." 
Walter Nicgorski, also a faculty member of the SLC, said, "On the whole, I think the veto was reasonable for Fr. Hesburgh. I am impressed with the reasoning in the veto message. A majority of the SLC agrees with Hesburgh in wanting this Catholic university to uphold a standard in sexual morality." 
He stated that although he was in sympathy with those members of the SLC who favor individual hall jurisdiction, he fully supports the rule as it now stands. "Individual jurisdiction is used as a means of undermini:::lg hall rules. When variations amongst the various dorms develop, there are cries against non-uniform justice. Students would want to see the most liberal policy prevail." 
Nicgorski feels that the SLC has 
injured itself by having spent so 
much time and energy on the two 
proposals only to end in failure. 
"The present sex rule isn't causing 
enough of a problem to warrant 
the attention it has received. The SLC should go on to other problems," he reasoned. 

Fr. Carl Ebey, member of the SLC and rector of Fisher, is satisfied with the current rule and pleased with Hesburgh's ruling and the reasoning behind his ac­tion. Ebey stated taht, "Everyone basically can know that some Christian standards are being enforced on the campus." 
He expressed uncertainty as to whether the issue would come before the SLC again this semester. "That is the rules committee's perogative. Then the council would have to reach a compromise acceptable to Hesburgh." He added that Hesburgh ahd been invited to speak with the council on the matter of compromise, but that he did not respond. 
Arguing against the recent proposal of Student Body President and SLC member Pat McLaughlin's proposal to grant the council the powers to override presidential vetoes, Ebey con­tended that the SLCis only an advisory committee to the president. "The SLC should never be more powerful than the president," he added. 
From the viewpoint of a hall rector, Ebey maintained the same stance. "There will be no change in the enforcement of the rule in Fisher due to the veto. The rule was passed several years ago. It's still the rule today," he concluded. 
In view of the recent attempts of the SLC to amend the existing sexuality code, several rectors were asked if their vikews or in­terpretations of the rule had in any way changed.

As to whether the existing rule could be improved upon, Gorski felt he lacked competence to comment on it, though he stated that "most areas in hall life can be improved upon." 
Fr. William Presle of St. Ed's Hall finds no need to change what he considers an already am­biguous rule. He sees any attempt to change it as a motion towards more ambiguity.

'Slasher· strikes lD Los Angeles 
LOS ANGELES <UPI) None of the nine victims of a knife-wielding "slasher" terror­izing sections of Los Angeles was drunk or incapacitated although most were physically weak, according to coroner's reports.
The report strengthened the belief that the killer being sought Sunday in one of the most intensive manhunts in the city's history is unusually strong. Victims have been beaten by the "slasher," who then cuts their throats through to the spinal cord. 
Pathological records indicate only one of the first seven victims, most found in the skid row section, had been drinking at all. 
Ht>ports on the latest two victims, residents of middle dass Hollywood apartmens, wt>re not yet available, but tht>re were no indications they wt>re drinking before their deaths. 
The body of Clyde C. Hay, 34, 
the latest and youngest victim, 
was found Friday in his apartment. A post mortem set the time of death between late Thursday and early Friday. 
It was earlier thought he had been killed Tuesday, and police said the time element further added to the mystery. 

lf Hay did not die until Friday, his whereabouts for two days is unknown. His employer, National Cash Register Co., said he was a man of regular habits, but had been missing from work for two days with no word. 
Darby celebrates fifth 
In case you haven't heard, today, Monday, February 3, is a very special day for Notre Dame. Darby O'Gill, man's best friend and University Chaplain's best roommate, is celebrating his fifth birthday today. 
Although this important historical date has not yet been named a national holdiday, a celebration of appropriate proportions has been planned. Fr. Robert Griffin and Darby invite all members of the ND-SMC community to a birthday party tonight, at Darby's Place, during regular business hours. 
All are welcome to wish the birthday boy a joyous occasion, and to share a piece of delicious birthday cake. Also, anyone wishing to liven up the evening and salute the honored guest by providing entertainment is cordially encouraged to attend.

Washington Hall, although still in use for lectures, classes and concerts will not be available for dramatic productions which require extensive and complicated lighting until repairs to the elec­trical system have been made. 
Professor Reginald Bain, chairman of the speech and drama department, explained that Washington Hall's lighting system cannot take the extreme loads and heavy equipment a play demands. "The present electrical equipment s just doesn't meet drama and safPty needs," he stated. 
Bain would also like to see the rigging system which supports hanging lights and sets revamped. "Washington Hall simply needs some work to become a com­fortable and safe place," said Bain. 
Brother Kieran Ryan, C.S.C., assistant vice president of business affairs, stated that deteriorating t>lectrical equipment and in­creasing needs of modern theater, not provided for in older buildings such as Washington Hall, make dramatic productions an im­possibility there in the near future. 
Some improvising of lighting had been tried in recent productions, according to Ryan, but did not mPet with the approval of Board of ll<>alth inspectors. 
Hyan described the stage lighting system of Washington Hall as inadequate for anything but activities requiring only the most basic lighting. He stressed, however, that the hall is quite safe and is being used for classes, as wl'll as lectures and concerts. 
Performances of the upcoming play, "Medea" by the ND-SMC Theater have been switched from Washington Hall to OLaughlin Auditorium at St. Mary's College with only minor difficulties. 
Repairs are now being planned for Washington Hall. A lighting consultant has looked over the 94­year old hall and will make recommendations to the University . The matter of renovations is now before the of­ficers of the University. There will be a review of the whole bwilding, includjng the auditorium. 
One estimate for the electrical repairs, Ryan said, runs from $30,000 to $33,000 . If that much money is going to be spent on the lighting system, he stated, it may be wise to make other im­provements on Washington Hall to make the building as a whole better equipped to handle more activities in the future. 

The autopsy, completed late Saturday, also disclosed he had been beaten before his head was nearly severed. 
The eighth victim was George Frias, 45. His body was found Wednesday, also in a Hollywood apartment he kept. 
The killings began last Dec. 1 and for a period of time the slasher only struck on Wednes­days and weekends. Then his pattern changed and the two bodies were discovered in Hollywood, about a half-mile apart. 
Police denied reports that a convict who escaped from prison last November while serving life terms for slaying five members f a family 16 years ago was among the suspects. They said the convict, Carl A. Eder, used a method different from the Los Angeles slasher. 
Police have established a telephone center to receive calls and tips about the slasher. 
About 500 telephoned tips have been screened since a composite drawing, taken from several i n t e r v i e w s, was released Friday. Based on those tips, the slasher is pictured as a six-footer with long dirty blond hair. 
A psychological profile de­~cribe!;) him as a "sexually Impotent coward, venting his own feeling of worthlessness on hapless derelicts and down-and­outers." 
That profile was developed, ho~ever. before the killings of Fnas and Hay, both described as conscientious and hard­working men.

All of the north quad hall presidents contacted felt that the students in their dorms had a good time and that there is a good possibility of a similar parties in the future. Zahm hall president Doug Cox said the Hall Pre­sident's Council was initially afraid such a party might flop, but due to the success of last Satur­day's party it might be feasible to hnld one once a month. 
Farley's president, Sue Swiatek, stated that the closeness of the dining hall to all the dorms

Presiding over the competition were Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, Judge William 
E. Doyle, of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, and Associate .Justice Mary S. Coleman, of the Michigan Supreme Court. 
The case argued, Lincoln vs. Swt'etwater College and Film ('omJiany, was similar to the eontroversial DeFunis case, in which a student was denied ad­mission to a college solely on the basis of a racial quota system.

WASHINGTON <U P ll President Ford sends Congress his $349 billion 1976 budget Monday. warning that its peacetime record of $52 billion in deficit spending cannot be avoided ''in times like these." 
The budget faced certain opposition from conservatives dismayed by the red-ink spen­ding. liberals angered by proposed slashes in welfare spending and Democrats al­n·ady fighting some of its key Pnt'rgy and economic provi­sions. 
Undergrads can attend ND Law School classes 

Tom Demko, President of the Pre-Law Society, announced today that undergraduate students may begin to visit classes at Notre Dame Law Sch(;Ol starting Mon­day, February 3. The program began last semester and was considered extremely successful. 
"Many undergrads sat in on more than one class." Demko commented, "and now have a better idea of what a law student must do." 
Participants are not limited to the members of the Society or to any specific year of study. Because of the limitations of space in the classroom, howwever, only five undergraduate student will be allowed per course at one time.

prompted people to walk over. McGuire adde<l that the free ad­mission for north quad residents provided an incentive. 
While the free admission and beverages made the party inviting to attend, it will also tax the hall treasuries. $670 was collected at the door from partiers outside the 
north  quad,  whereas  total  ex­ 
penses for  the evening  were  ap­ 
proximately $1760.  

From this amount $1100 went for renting the facility and for free refreshments, $550 for the band, and another $110 was spent on publicity and police. The hall will pay out the deficit on the basis of hall size; the towers will chop in the most and the smallest dorm the least. 
Earlier last week the HPC went through university channels at­tempting to get a "21" bar set up at the party. The request was

Ford sends proposed budget to Congress 

rejected by Brother Just Paczensy for a number of reasons. The university didn't want liquor served in a public campus facility; it might have created an "armory party" type atmosphere; and the administration also felt the resulting mess and lingering odors would be offensive to students. 
The hall presidents felt the band, Eden Rock, made a big difference in the success of the party. Swiatek said the dancing was "infectious" and even those who stood around the edges of the room eventually ended up dancing. She was also pleased to see the dining hall being "used for more than eating and organic tests." 
Cox said the success of the party was due to its providing "something that's missing here," and McGuire stated that the big turnout "proves there's nothing to do around here."

Rep. AI Ullman, D-Ore., t'hairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, said Sunday it was "highly doubtful" Congress would ap­prove many of Ford's proposed welfare cutbacks, on the one hand, or his increased defense expenditures on the other. 
Ullman was interviewed on NBC-TV's "Face the Nation". 
He disclosed that about $6 billion of Ford's proposed $17 billion in spending cuts would affect welfare programs.

Irish smother Xavier; Dantley hurt 
Sopb forward suffers lacerated eye and deviated nasal septum in second half collision 
by Bill Brink 
Unlike most of their games this 
season, the biggest problem for the 
Irish during the closing minutes of 
play was not winning the game. 
Their biggest problem, in fact, was 
not l.'ven on the court. 
As Notre Dame was taking care 
of the visiting Xavier Musketeers, 
sailing to a 96-58 romp, the trainers 
and doctors were taking care of the 
Irish's super forward, Adrian 
Pantley. Dantley was injured late 
in the gamP when he collided with 
Xavier's Paul Deidrick ua­
d(rnPath the ND basket. 
With a little over seven minutes 
ldt in thP game A.D. received the 
hall to the left of the Irish basket 
and wht-eled to his right to drive 
along the baseline. He ran head­
first into Deidrick. butting heads 
or possibly calching an elbow from 
the Musketeer defender. Dantley 
was forced to retire to the ND 
locker room where he received 
sevt-n5titchesover his right eye. He 
was then taken to have X-rays 
taktn on his nose. 
Doctors determined that the 
young star suffered a deviated 
nasal septum. but that it seemed to 
be in good alignment. Dantley 
spent Saturday night in the in­
firmary. He is expected to par­
ticipate in practice this week, but 
the decision as to whether he'll be 
ready for Wednesday night's 
contest with Michigan State will 
not be made until early Wednesday 
afternoon. 
"I thought maybe he faked to the 
inside and then went back to the 
baseline." said an obviously 
concerned Digger Phelps after the 
game. "The kid didn't take the 
fake ant:l they butted heads." 
Fortunately for the Irish, the 
injury occurred long after the 
Musketeers had any chance to take 
advantage of Dantley's absence. 
A.D. left the game withthe Irish ahead 71-47 , and Coach Phelps had long since gone to his bench. In fact he probably used more 

combinations Saturday than in any previous game this year. 
The game started slow, both teams being bothered by mistakes and cold shooting. It was not until 
17:41 of the first half that the Irish opened the scoring on a layup by Dantley. Another drive by A.D. and two quick buckets by Dwight Clay gave Notre Dame a s-o lead, but the Musketeers found the mark and fought to within one point, 13­12 at 11:55. 
That was a close as they came, however. as the Irish gained momentum and employed a harrassing press that disrupted Xavier's game and forced them into a number of costly mistakes. Dantley. meanwhile, was un­stoppable, hitting layups and short jumpers. and connecting on five of six free throws en route to his 19 first half point total. 
Phelps began substituting early, and received encouraging per­formances from freshmen Dave Batton and Don "Duck" williams, who contributed seven and six points respectively in the first half. With the press completely bewildering Xavier, the Irish ran up a 54-25 halftime lead. 

"The first seven or eight minutes of the game were pretty close," said Digger. "We took our press off and when we do that we're not aggressive defensively. We lost · our momentum. They began to come back, so we felt we had to press them." 
"But we had a good first half," he added. "Anytirr.e you are leading by 25, it's a good half." 
The Irish continued their domination and extended their lead in the second half, much of the contribution coming from the reserves who have seen little action this season. Every member of the squad played and scored, to the delight of the 10,080 fans in the ACC. Despite the lopsided score, ND did not look real sharp, com­mitting 24 turnovers. 
Before he left, Dantley had 23 points, nine points below his season average. With North Carolina State's David Thompson scoring 38 in a losing effort against Maryland 
yesterday, Dantley has probably relinquished the nation's scoring lead to the Wolfpack forward. Dantley now, however, has 1,042 points in his college career, the seventh player in ND history to better the 1000 mark and the first to do it as a sophomore. Only two

The Irish hockey team finally broke the jinx of the Denver Pioneers, winning their first game ever in the mile-high city. Saturday night the Fighting Irish handed Denver a 4-o blank. The last time the Pioneers were shutout was by Michigan 'J'ech. Friday night Notre Dame again continued its stream of defensive errors resulting in a 5-3 loss. 
The combination of Irish defensive mistakes in their own zone and the excellent goal tending of Bob Lieg, .spelled loss for Lefty Smiith and his youthful squad Friday night. 
The Pioneers' opened up the game's offense exactly four minutes into a very long period, due to ice repairs and fisticuffs. The ND defense gave wing Jim Miller one too many chances from in close on John Peterson. Peterson made the initial save on Miller's five foot wrister, but two rebounds later Miller hit the upper corner of the net to the glove side, for a 1-o 
Denver lead. 
The Irish really were the Fighting Irish Friday night. Brian Walsh and Campbell settled their dif­ferences with fists at 4: 18 of the first period. Both sat out Saturday's contest. Geoff Collier joined Walsh for an early shower at 10:55 of the closing periodand was also on the bench Saturday. 
The Irish quickly evened the score early in the second period, on the power play advantage. Pat Conroy skated into the Denver zone and passed to Alex Pirus, waiting on the point. Pirus pulled the string from 60 feet, Lieg made the initial save, but Clark Hamilton was there for the rebound goal at I :50. 
Denver responded at 4: 12 of the third session with their fifth tally, to put the game on ice. ND ended the game's offense at 13:43 of the last period on 4-3 man advantage. Pat Conroy beat Lieg, with the assist going to Alex Pirus. 
"If there could be an exact opposite of Friday night's game, it was tonight's <Saturday)," explained Smith. "The defense played well all night, especially in front of our net. The offense was able to hit the open man much better, giving us good shots on net." 
"Definitely the turning point of the game was the killing of that two-man advantage for Denver," continued Smith. "The defense was blocking shots, as well as the forwards up front, Olive, Karsnia, Guisti, and Hamilton." 


ADRIAN DANTLEY writhes in pain after colliding with Xavier's Paul Deidrick. Dantley suffered a nose injury and took seven stitches in his right eye. Dantley's status for Wedensday's MSU game is 
questionable. other players in collegiate basketball history, Pete Maravich of L.S.U. and Fly Williams of Austin Peay have exceeded the 1,000 point mark as a sophomore. 
Musketeer coach Tay Baker praised all the Irish ballplayers, but singled out Dantley as the standout for Notre Dame. 
"Adrian Dantley does so many things well," said Baker. "He makes great use of his body, shoots well, and gets up and down the court quick. We probably did as wdl as we could against him defensively." 
Meanwhile, Phelps and the Irish must wait on a daily basis to see how Dantley progresses. They are hoping he will be ready Wednesday night when the Irish host the Spartans of Michigan State. 
ND icers split with Denver 
The turning point of the game Lefty referred to was a stretch in the second period, 12:02 to 16:02, when the Irish were down anywhere from one to three skaters. Tim Byers and Dave Bossy were whistled off at 14:02, putting ND at a two man disadvantage. 
The wealth of ND infractions was not the only feature of the second period. Senior Pat Conroy scored the winning goal at 7:45. Conroy took a pass from Pirus in the slot and scored from 10 feet out. An assist was also given to Clark Hamilton, but not to 
Dick Howe who hustled well in keeping the puck in play at the point. 
Again the shots attempted (47), stopped by the defense (10), off the mark (19}, and stopped by Moher <18), showed the excellent work of the Irish, never giving in to seemingly the hopeless situation of an endless penalty-kill. 
Jack Brownschidle gave Notre Dame an insurance ,--------------------------­
power play goal at 1:50 of the final period. Pirus slipped the puck to Brownschidle, who beat Lieg on an unscreened bullet from the blueline. Assists were given to Pirus and Kevin Nugent. 
Mark Olive made the game 3-o, with much thanks to the good hustle of Nugent. Karsnia flipped the puck down ice into the Denver zone and Nugent was the first back. Nugent passed to Olive alone in front of the Denver net. The junior from Richfield, Min­nesota scored at 8:43. 
The final goal came at 15:31 on a power play breakaway marker from the stick of Alex Pirus. Pirus and linemate Hamilton skated in on Lieg un­checked, with Pirus taking the pass from Hamilton and scoring for the 4-o final total. 
Where do you start with the play of freshman goalie Len Moher? Well, Pioneer coach Murray Armstrong said, "That kid <Moher) was unbeatable outthere, even though our kids played their hearts out." 
The Denver fans also appreciated the efforts of Moher with an assortment of awards-popcorn cups, hotdogs, and an uncooked chicken. 
Notre Dame is now 9-14-1 (12-l5-1overalJ), which puts it in seventh place in the WCHA, led by red-hot Minnesota who swept Colorado College this past weekend. Other games around the league saw Michigan Tech sweep Michigan State, Michigan and Minnesota-Duluth split, and Wisconsin win one and tie one with North Dakota. 
Next opponent for the Irish is a home series with the Michigan State Spartans, a team well-known for their physical style of play. 
Swi1n1ners unbeaten; take weekend pair 
by Ernie Torriero 
There are some pretty exciting things happening at the Rockne Memorial Pool these days. Coach Dennis Stark is leading a bunch of talented and spirited swimmers toward a goal that every athelete dreams about, an undefeated season. By posting two wins this weekend, the Irish swim team is now 7-0. Yes, there is an un­defeated team on campus and yes, it might be worth going over to the Rock to find out what is going on. 
Friday, the Domers downed Wayne State of Detroit, 68-46, in a late afternoon match at the Rockne Pool. Notre Dame finished first in the opening six events. But Wayne State finished strong, winning five out of the last seven events. 
The Irish burst out of the starting blocks, winning the first event, the 400 Yard Medley Relay, 
quite handily with a time of 3:50.1. The onslaught continued until Wayne State's Mark Makkonea easily won the 200 Yard Butterfly, posting a time of 2:10. But the
Wayne State drive proved too 
little, as the Irish came up with enough second and third place finishes to secure the meet. 
Saturday, Notre Dame repeated Friday's performance by dumping Marshall University of Hun-­tington, West Virginia, 68-45. The 
Irish again posted six straight first place finishes. In all, six meet records were broken, three by Notre Dame. 
The meet was highlighted by some great individual efforts. Freshman Fritz Shadley came out of nowhere to nail down second place in the one meter optional diving after having copped third place in the compulsory one meter diving. Captain Jim Kane con­tinued his domination of Notre Dame opponents by nabbing first place in the 50 Yard Freestyle. 
Stark commented on his team's excellent weekend performance saying, "We were about due. We really exploded." Jim Kane echoed his coach's sentiments, "This weekend represented a great team effort. These are the kind of performances that we have been getting all year. It is those second andthird place finishes that help us keep our early leads." 
This week, the Irish take their undefeated mark on the road, traveling to Bowling Green on Thursday night and St. Bonaventure on Saturday af­ternoon. "St. B rivalry. We really get psyched," bellowed one swimmer. But Stark quickly warned, "We have a toughie coming up against Bowling Green first." A little guarded optimism never hurt anyone.
