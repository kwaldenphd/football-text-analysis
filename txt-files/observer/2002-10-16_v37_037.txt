The band Laura Fuentes y Calicanto entertained students at the College-sponsored Brown Bag Luncheon Tuesday that helped to close celebrations of Hispanic Heritage Month at Saint Mary's. 
The trio played Latin American music that had African, European and pre­Columbian influences. 
"We're calling on these roots, music that was hidden for a long time," said Fuentes. "Latin American music is too big and varied to fall under

music. 
T h e band's songs included sounds from countries such as Chile, Mexico and Venezuela. Laura Fuentes, Pedro Villagra and Tomas Gonzalez Jansana combined their own styles and expressions of music into their performance, creating a sound that brought together a diversity of cultures. 

Along with entertaining, Fuentes provided information about the history of the music and its origins. The performers also explained the roots of the instruments. 
"[foday's music] may be mod­ernized, but the roots are still there," Fuentes said. 
Laura Fuentes y Calicanto gave an interactive perfor­mance. Students participated with the artists, playing percus­sion instruments. 
Participants were able to see the combination of many cul­tures through songs and discus­sion. 
At the end of the performance, there was a question-and­answer session in which audi­ence members were able to express their thoughts about the event.

NEWS ANALYSIS 


Prospect of war looms 
By NATASHA GRANT 
News Writer 
Ever since Congress voted 
to give President Bush the 
power to declare war on 
Iraq, many people have wor­
ried about the prospect of a 
military conflict. 
Notre Dame political sci­ence professor Daniel Lindley, considered an expert on the military, sees Congress' decision as a step toward an inevitable war. 
"In some ways they had very little choice," he said, "If you are for the war, you vote for it. If you are borderline against the war, you still vote for it to give the United Nations a strong hand." Lindley sees this as essential to avoiding war altogether. "Ifyou want the U.N. process to work, give Bush the vote. The best hope to avoid war is through the U .N." 
The motivation behind the war would be neither eco­nomic nor political, Lindley said. 
"It's a combination of a sense of threat from weapons of mass destruction and after 9/11, the opportunity giving the right-wing hawks a lot

Saint Mary's funds social change trip 
By ANNELIESE WOOLFORD 
News Writer 
Taking advantage of the upcoming fall break, Saint Mary's Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership is spon­soring a six­day trip for faculty, staff, students and Michiana­area women leaders to visit three social change pro­jects in Ohio a n d Tennessee. 
The trip is phase two of the Catalyst Project, a yearlong experiment designed to link Saint Mary's women with women in the community. The first phase of the project took place Sept. 26 in a workshop Juanita Campos, who introduced the Participatory Learning in Action method of research, evaluation and plan-ning. Participants are supposed to apply principles of PLA on the trip. 


Thirty-three women from vari­ous backgrounds were chosen to participate on the outing from Saturday to Oct. 25. Of the 33, two are Saint Mary's faculty members, and seven are Saint Mary's students. 
For three days, CWIL partici­pants will be joined by Sister Linda Kors. director of Saint Mary's volunteer resource cen­ter, and nine students bound for a service project in Appalachia. 
"I think student participation is really critical." said Bonnie Bazata, CWIL director of com­munity connections. "Not only will they gain a lot from the trip by being in the company of strong community women lead­ers, but they also will have much to contribute." 
The first project destination is Grailville, a women's spiritual retreat center in Loveland, Ohio. Grailville prides itself on ofTering

Taco Bell policy criticized 
By MATT BRAMANTI 
News Writer 
Upset with the plight of migrant farm laborers, members of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers spoke at Notre Dame Tuesday, renewing their call for a boy­cott of Taco Bell restaurants. 
The group was organized in 1997 to advance the inter­ests of migrant tomato pick­ers in Florida and has grown to include students at college campuses across the coun­try. including an active group at Notre Dame. As farm laborers-turned­activists spoke, students handed out bumper stickers that read, "Yo no quiero Taco Bell." a reference to the company's popular advertising campaign. 
Lucas Benitez, speaking through a Spanish-language interpreter, recalled his expe­riences picking tomatoes in the fields of Florida. He had harsh words for the state of high-volume production. 
"The history of agriculture is a history of exploitation," Benitez said. 

He said pickers' wages have been stagnant for the past 20 years at, "40 to 45 cents per 32-pound bucket." Benitez expressed optimism that mar­ket pressure can force compa­nies such as Taco Bell to pay higher wages to their suppli­ers. 
"We should democratize these corporations ... it can be done," Benitez said.

the occasional X­BOX to make them feel comfortable, but it's the more creative "fixtures" or adorn­ments that go the extra mile to help you 
_ adjust to life without Morn and your old room. Perhaps you will decide to garnish your entire ceiling with hundreds of cellophane flowers you meticulously make on Saturday nights, hang up an oversized map and check offeach state from where your previous hook ups claim to reside or just put an oversized concrete gargoyle on your roof. All of these ideas and thousands more are performed by college students everywhere because it allows them to make their residences uniquely theirs. To help make us unique in a dorm of 250 students, my T-wing has decided to take up blasphemy and keep a section idol. Apparently, someone was quite taken with his appearance at the Salvation Army shop in town, and after paying $1 for him; this object went from trash to divine status. Being the stereotypical Italian cook with a full moustache and chefs hat, the fig­urine looks like a washed-up Nintendo Mario trying to make a dent in the culinary field. By his outward appearance with spaghetti pouches and blue ascot, he looks like he may have found a new niche. He may be just a baker, or actually a ceramic foot-tall rendition of one, but in some respects, he has become the section's gold­en calf, allowing us to be original. Unfortunately, he is presently on hiatus somewhere in our common room, but when he isn't hiding from his worshippers, he prefers being in the glamour of the camera. His main purpose in life is to be a trophy that is photographed with friends and well-wishers in the section. We've actually created a collage of pic­tures of visiting alumni, friends from back home and other members ofthe section carrying the esteemed James like some sort of hunting trophy. There's only one rule when taking your picture with James, though: Once a pose has been taken, it cannot be used twice. Thinking of a new pose can be half the fun ofa section idol. Cradling, shaving and using him as a protective barrier in front of some guy's privies have been taken since Jan1es has arrived, and every week a handful of new poses are added to the list. Sooner or later the cream white wall in our section will be papered with a colorful assortment of humorous picture, and little James smiling away in each photograph. Having a section idol is only one of an endless assortment of ideas out there to allow you to make your home for the year unique. Originality and humor are key to keeping your sanity in college. And ifa ceil­ing covered in cellophane flowers makes you feel special, then by all means start buying that plastic wrap, but then again worshipping an idol is also acceptable.

Students predict fashion trends 
By JUSTINE DACOSTA & 
SYLVIA LIM 
Sparran Daily 
SAN JOSE, Calif. 

Sure. clothes are practical. They cover certain parts of the anatomy, but they expose something else too. 
Clothes give us the opportuni­ty to turn ourselves inside out. and to display our personality to the world. Fashion becomes us, and is a personal statement of who we are. 
As students at San Jose State University face the awkward climate transition from summer to fall, most of us are reaching in to the farthest terrain of our closets for items that carry on this form of self-expression fur­ther. 
Tank tops are 
and belts are making their annual come­backs this time of the year, with new looks and colors. 
Fashion is in the eye of the beholder. and there are as many styles on campus as there are students. 
The Spartan Daily looked to the various birds of different feathers on campus for fashion predictions. 
We managed to stop some bright peacocks and ruffie their 
feathers for fashion tips. Basically, this is what they see in the crystal ball. 
Accessories. the salt and pep­per of fashion. can add spice to an outfit by dressing it up or playing it down. Earrings and bracelets decorate the body while belts and glasses can be both practical and indulgently fashionable. It's the little things that make the difference, but some students predict next sea­son's accessories will be all about the big things. 
Liz Breen, a senior manage­ment information systems major who said she expects to see wider pants with slits in the side, said her favorite accessory is her belly-button ring.

Harris, a junior illustration major...Pants will get wider." 
Harris said she expects to see students layering their clothes and wearing more scarves this fall season. 
Liz Herrera, a junior sports management major, said she also foresees the popularity of scarves, and said she thinks button-up collared shirts and pointy-toed boots will become fashionable. 
Herrera, whose favorite place 
to shop is clothing store 
Express. said she doesn't like 
spending a lot of money on 
clothes. 
'Tm a bargainer," she said. 
"My best buy was a suede jack­
et for $30." 
When it comes to fashion, fru­
gality is not only economically 
advantageous. Thrift stores and 
garage sales are a good way to 
find rare and unusual items. 
Holly Valencia, a music edu­cation major. said her favorite places to shop are thrift stores and vintage shops. 
"When I find something for 99 cents. that's the appeal." she said. 
Valencia said her favorite accessory is her chain wallet and that patches and buttons are a must. 
"I like chains. belts, jewelry. lunch pails, and I love having fun with makeup," she said. 
Vincent Calvetti, an unde­clared student, said he pur­chases the majority of his clothes at thrift stores for the novelty of it. 
Calvetti said his fashion sense is "uncoordinated, like a poor student's," and he said his favorite accessories are his jelly bracelets and his glasses. 
"I won't leave home without my glasses because I kind of need them," he said. 
Maybe peacocks grow more feathers in colder weather. Since we cannot really do that, a trip to the mall would suffice. 
Have that credit card ready to charge.

more ability to go against Iraq," he said. 

Lindley also believes the season would be a driving force behind the urgency for the potential war. 
"The war has to happen at winter time because it's too hot for our troops in sum­mer," he said. The United States would prefer to move sooner rather than later, he said. 
Lindley compared the war to a bet, saying, "It's a bet on a number of dimensions. Will the Iraqi army fight or not fight? If they fight, it will be bloody. If they don't, it will be easy." 
Yet, he said Iraq's threat was minimal when compared to Russia and Pakistan. 
"Why are we focusing on Iraq at the risk of hurting the campaign against terrorism and downplaying more pressing threats within Russia and Pakistan?" he said. Because Russia offers a bigger threat of holding nuclear weapons, Lindley said, the United States should be invading there instead of Iraq. 
"Strategy is the art of prior­itizing, of weighing costs and benefits." he said. "The threat from Iraq is out­weighed by other threats. and an Iraq war will hurt more important U.S. priori­ties." 
Lindley said Bush will choose to attack Iraq instead of the bigger threats because Iraqi President Saddam Hussien is tied to economic threats, including higher oil prices, and attempts to assassinate several foreign presidents. 
Economics student Edward Faustin agreed that Iraq is a hostile threat because of its military capabilities. "They're probably harboring weapons of nuclear destruction over there," said Faustin, a senior. 
Faustin, however. did not agree with Congress' deci­sion to give Bush power to declare war on Iraq. 
"War is not resolution," he said. "I feel like any decision for war is made with haste." 
Diplomacy and an attempt at reaching a peaceful out come have not been fully considered, according to Faustin. 
"You'd assume that we've explored every avenue of diplomacy to come to some sort of peace, but it doesn't seem the case here," he said. 
Political science major Veronica Berger shared opin ions similar to Faustin's and said she didn't see a clear reason for the United States to attack Iraq. 
"In order to declare war on Iraq, there needs to be a credible and immediate threat," she said. "If the U.N. is the organization that has a problem with Iraq, then the 
U.N. needs to act multilater ally against Iraq, not the U.S. alone." 
U.S. involvement in the conflict would be a means to prevent Iraq from acquiring nuclear weapons and using them irrationally, Berger said. She said having nuclear weapons could cause Iraq to become "a hegemony in the Middle East."

FBI terrorism analyst is latest D.C. sniper victim

FALLS CHURCH, Va. 
An FBI terrorism analyst was 

identified Tuesday as the ninth 
person killed by the Washington­
area sniper. shot in the head in an 
attack investigators say has yield­
ed the most detailed clues yet. 
For the first time. witnesses were able to give information about license plates on vehicles seen fleeing the scene, including a light-colored Chevrolet Astro van with a burned-out rear taillight. 
A law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymi­ty, said another witness gave a description of a dark-skinned man. possibly Hispanic or Middle Eastern. in a white van. 
"There was some additional information that we were able to get from last night's case. and I am confident that that informa­tion is going to lead us to an arrest in the case," Fairfax County Police Chief Tom Manger said. 
Law enforcement sources said there was no indication the sniper targeted Linda Franklin because of her job. She worked for the FBI's Cyber-Crimes Division. cre­ated last year to focus on comput­er crimes as well as intellectual property cases. 
Montgomery County {Md.) Police Chief Charles Moose, the head of the investigation, empha­sized that Franklin was not work­ing on the sniper case. 
Franklin, a 47-year-old mother 

of two grown children, was killed 
Monday night as she and her hus­
band loaded packages into their 
car outside a Home Depot store. 
Ballistics evidence Tuesday con­
nected the slaying to the gunman 
who has killed eight other people 
and wounded two more since Oct. 
2. 
With the terrifying spree nearly two weeks old, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld agreed Tuesday evening to provide mili­tary surveillance aircraft in the hunt for the killer, a Pentagon spokesman said. Sources said fed­eral agents on the plane will relay any information they collect to authorities on the ground. 
The Army also has started searching its records for people with sniper training. 
Separately. Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge said investi­gators are hesitant to rule out the possibility that the slayings are the work of a terrorist because there is no hard evidence about motive. 
Friends who gathered at Franklin's Arlington home said she and her husband were plan­ning to move to a bigger home in the area and were at The Home Depot to buy supplies for the move and the new house. 
Franklin recently had a double mastectomy following breast can­cer and was still in physical thera­py at the time of her death, according to her friend Paul Hulseberg. He called her coura­geous.

IRAQ 
Iraqis vote for unopposed Saddam in referendum 
Associated Press 
TIKRIT 
Stuffing ballots into boxes by the fistful, citizens in Saddam Hussein's hometown of massive compounds and narrow lanes joined millions of other Iraqis on Tuesday for a vote choreographed as a show ofsup­port for their leader. 
"All Iraq is for Saddam. He is our leader and our father," said one voter, showing off a ballot stamped "yes" in a thumbprint of blood. 
Surface-to-air missile batteries and artillery outside Saddam's hometown, Tikrit, underscored the other message in 
Iraq's one-candidate presidential referen­dum: defiance of the United States in the face of possible war over Iraq's alleged weapons ofmass destruction. 
"I came to put my paper in the box and to say I don't want America to come here, and to say I hate Bush, because he wants to attack me," Dr. Ahmed Jawad, a para­sitologist, said in a village outside Tikrit. 
Iraq projected more than 11 million of Saddam's 22 million people would turn out for the referendum. The vote was a "yes" or "no" on Saddam's staying president for another seven years and on continuing the coup-installed, three-decade reign of his party. 
The White House dismissed the one-man race. "Obviously, it's not a very serious day, not a very serious vote and nobody places any credibility on it," press secretary Ari Fleischer said in Washington. 
At home, Iraqis have spoken of besting Saddam's 99.96 percent "yes" vote the last referendum, in 1995. In the capital, Baghdad, Saddam's Baath Party staged neighborhood drives to get out the vote ­with many projecting a 100 percent "yes" this time. 
Officials said results would be announced at a news conference Wednesday morning. In a vote run with little show of impartiality or doubt about the outcome, however, it was impossible to tell if announced turnout or results would have any relation to votes cast. 
Iraq limited reporters to state-escorted stops at polling places. There were no independent observers. 
The true turnout seemed likely lower than the official projection. Some in Baghdad said privately they had no plans to vote. 
Tikrit, 95 miles north of Baghdad, is a stronghold for Saddam, who comes from what were poor, settled Bedouin in the region. 
Saddam's actual birth village ofAl Aouja, outside Tikrit, is off-limits to foreigners.

IRA commanders remained silent about Britain's resumption of authority in Northern Ireland after nearly three years of local power sharing between two British Protestant parties and two Irish Catholic parties, including the IRA's Sinn Fein. Most politicians and commentators blamed the political breakdown on the IRA. 
Israel releases chief Muslim cleric: 
Jerusalem's chief Muslim cleric was questioned by Israeli police Tuesday about a newspaper interview in which he was quoted as endorsing suicide bombings. Ikrima Sabri, 63, was detained at his home and held for three hours at a police compound in Jerusalem before being released without charge. In an interview after­ward, Sabri said he was misquoted. 
NATIONAL NEWS BRIEFS 
m. to hold death row clemency hearings: 
Illinois opened a marathon series of clemency hear­ings Tuesday for nearly every prisoner on death row in what could be the most sweeping review of capital punishment in U.S. history. In all. more than 140 petitions for clemency will be heard by the end of the month. The hearings for all but a few of the state's 160 condemned inmates come after Gov. George Ryan said earlier this year that he intended to review every death penalty case before he leaves office in January. 
High court passes up rebel flag case: 
The Supreme Court refused Tuesday to settle a free-speech skirmish over the Confederate battle flag, which the federal government all but bans from national cemeteries out of worry that it is racially divisive. The court had been asked if a descendant of a Confederate soldier may fly the flag daily at a Maryland Civil War cemetery. 
Accused cell member pleads innocent: 
A man accused of conspiring to fight U.S. troops in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 attacks pleaded inno­cent Tuesday. A federal indictment accuses Ahmed Bilal and five others, including his brother Muhammad Bilal, of conspiring to wage war against 
U.S. forces in Afghanistan and to provide material support to the Taliban and al-Qaida. The indictment says three of the suspects never made it to Afghanistan to carry out their plan; it does not say whether the others did. All had ties to Portland. 
Utah woman charged in polygamy case: 
For apparently the first time in more than 100 years, Utah prosecutors are going after a woman on polygamy-related charges. The woman, Suzie Stubbs Holm, 36, is part of a polygamous household in rural Utah. But she is not directly charged with polygamy. Instead, she is accused of getting her 16­year-old sister to marry into the household.

national popu­lation totaled more than 5,200 for the fall 2002 semester, with the vast majority of them in the country on the F-1 student visa. 
Colleges across the United States scrambled to enter infor­mation on internationals into the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, known as SEVIS, as the deadline to regis­ter approached. 
SEVIS collects information on international students and other exchange visitors, such as their name, date of birth and country of origin, said Lawrence Gower, director of the Office of International Students and Scholars at UClA. 
SEVIS, implemented by INS, also wanted to know whether the student was achieving full­time student status. If not. INS wanted to know the reasons why. The program also required schools to update student infor­mation on whether their inter­national students planned on working and whether they moved from one residential area to another or changed visa sta­tus. 
Schools with international populations greater than 250 needed the batch-mode version of the program, said Dixon C. Johnson, executive director of the USC Office of International Services. 
The batch-mode version allowed for bulk entry of student information. 
INS had been continuously reissuing new batch-process regulations, however, and so far had yet to publish the final regu­lations, Johnson said. 

"We are attempting to prepare to comply based on the proposed regulations, and we are prepar­ing to respond and fully comply with regulations which have yet to be finalized," he said. 
This would make admission of international students much more complicated, said Wendy Yao, president of the International Students' 
Assembly.

"If you apply for recertification of the program 7 5 days before the compliance day (of Jan. 30, 2003), (the government) will guarantee that you will have at least conditional approval," said Dianne Walker, systems manag­er at Services for International 
Students and  Scholars  at  
University  of  California­ 
Berkeley.  

The total international popula­tion, including undergraduate, graduate and exchange visitors, numbered approximately 4,700 for fall 2002. 
Loyola Marymount University, with more than 300 internation­al students, progressed toward the deadline, said Denise Folga, director of LMU's Office of International Students and Scholars. 
"We're doing everything that we can," said Folga, who also said INS conducted site visits to schools that have international students before the school could be recertified. 
LMU had begun working with their information technology department and also planned to host a conference by the National Association of Foreign Student Advisers on Dec. 6 for schools that had already gotten "precertified and using SEVIS," she said. 
In addition to the conference at LMU, schools were also prepar­ing for the deadline by attending a four-day NAFSA Region XII conference in San Jose, Calif., in two weeks for SEVIS training.

Baylor U. teachers change formats 
By KRISTEN HARDGRAVE 
The Lariar 
WACO, Texas 

Learning is not limited to lectures and textbooks any­more. Several Baylor University professors have gone beyond the books to make classroom material more interesting. 
Professors are incorporating things from role-playing to rock 'n' roll. 
"I like to use a format that students can relate to," said Dr. John Thorburn, assistant professor of classics. 
In a freshman honors clas­sics class, called Law, Love and Laughter, Thorburn explores fifth-century Greek drama. Instead of taking notes from a play script, Thorburn summarizes his plays in a comical, musical way he refers to as "Weird Al Yankovic style." 
"I want to do anything I can to get students to remember the material and be able to repeat things," Thorburn said. 
When studying "The Medea," Thorburn related the play to the song, "The Funky Cold Medina," and in his Latin classes, Thorburn has students conjugate verbs to the tune of "The Good Ol' Baylor Line." 
"Songs get stuck in your head, so this is a way to get Latin and Greek stuck in your head too,'' Thorburn said. 
Dr. Julie Sweet, who teaches American history, makes the subject come alive for students through active role-playing. 
'Tm not a big fan of history, but she's always doing some­thing creative that really keeps me interested." Belinda Stewart, an Arlington senior, said. 
Sweet gives each student a character from a particular event in history which they act out without any additional out­side research. She selects a variety of characters of differ­ent races and genders to give students a diverse perspective on history. 
"I think it really helps stu­dents understand how history is relevant to their own lives," Sweet said. Sometimes the dis­cussions get intense with con troversial topics like the rebels defending their cause in the Civil War, one of Sweet's favorite events to debate. 
Another teaching method, designed by Dr. Mark Morman, an assistant profes­sor of communication studies, allows students to learn about relationships through involve­ment with classmates. In his class, interpersonal communi~ cations, students are able to understand and diagnose ele­ments of relationships rather than just learn definitions from a textbook. "The project allows students to put theory into action," Morman said. 
One of the requirements for the class includes the dyad project. In this activity stu­dents set up an outside, infor­mal class meeting with one other person in the class.

He remained free on bail until his sentencing in January. He could face a total of 65 years in prison and millions of dollars in fines, although his sentence will likely be far less. 
In outlining the accusa­tions against Waksal, Schachter issued a stinging attack on the disgraced ex­CEO, charging he had used his family members as "human shields" to try to save himself from prosecu­tion. The government has accused Waksal of tipping off his father as well, although he did not plead to that charge Tuesday. 
The former ImClone CEO was arrested in June on and Drug Administration would not review his com­pany's experimental cancer drug, Erbitux. 
"I am aware that my con­duct, while I was in posses­sion of material non-public information, was wrong," Waksal said in court. 
The bank fraud charge, which alone carries a pos­sible 30-year sentence, stemmed from Waksal forging the name of ImClone's top lawyer to a document securing a line of credit. 
"Rather than have the ImClone general counsel sign the letter, I signed the letter," he told the judge. 
ImClone prosecutors con­tinue to focus attention on Stewart and her stockbro­ker, Peter Bacanovic. The home decorating entrepre­neur and Bacanovic, a Merrill Lynch broker, have denied wrongdoing and have not been charged. 
The Justice Department is investigating whether Stewart knowingly lied to lawmakers about her stock sale. Stewart sold nearly 4,000 ImClone shares on Dec. 27 -one day before the FDA publicly announced its Erbitux deci­sion. She has maintained she had a standing order to sell the shares if the stock dropped below $60. 
Stewart spokeswoman Allyn Magrino issued a statement, attributed to Stewart's legal counsel, saying, "Sam Waksal's guilty plea has nothing to do with Martha Stewart."

Neither side would comment early Wednesday about the prospects of an agreement, which has proven elusive despite years of sporadic negotia­tions. 
"This is quite a sensitive issue," said Queenie Chan, a spokeswoman at Hong Kong's Economic Development Bureau. 
In previous sessions, the Americans had reportedly offered to let Hong Kong's largest car­rier, Cathay Pacific Airways, put its flight num­bers on some services offered in the United States by its alliance partner, American Airlines. The practice is known as "code-sharing." 
But in return, American negotiators wanted greater rights for U.S. carriers to fly into Hong Kong and onto points in other markets -which would pose a strong competitive threat to Cathay and Hong Kong's No. 2 airline, Dragon air.

TORONTO 

Talks on a new contract between DaimlerChrysler and the Canadian Auto Workers continued Tuesday into the final hours before a midnight strike deadline, with a union spokeswoman denying a report that a tentative agree­ment had been reached. 
The Canadian Press reported an agreement was struck Tuesday evening a few hours before the deadline. Union spokeswoman Jane Annstrong said the talks were continuing, focused on non­wage issues. 
The 1:\.vo sides planned to announce a deal an hour before the deadline, pend­ing final approval by the union's bar gaining committee, Canadian Press reported, citing an unidentified source. 
Earlier, union president Basil "Buzz" Hargrove said the almost 13,000 DaimlerChrysler workers appeared headed for a strike despite progress made in talks through the afternoon. 
'There's a strong possibility the plants will go down at midnight," Basil "Buzz" Hargrove told a news conference. 
Hargrove said reduced demand has DaimlerChrysler planning to idle some plants for a week or two later this month, regardless of whether there is a strike. That makes the automaker will­ing to push for concessions at the cost of a strike, he said. 
''There's some slack time in the pro­
duction system," Hargrove said. 
"Someone has decided now is the time 
to try to take advantage of it." 
A strike would cease DaimlerChrysler's North American pro­duction ofIntrepid and Concorde sedans made at a Brampton, Ontario, plant, and also halt production of Dodge Caravans at a Windsor, Ontario, factory. Caravans also are made at a U.S. plant in St. Louis. 
Hargrove previously rejected a week­end offer from the company because it lacked a guaranteed plan to save 1,200 jobs at the Pillette Road factory in Windsor, which is scheduled to close in July.

WASHINGTON 

President Bush does not sup­port the recent days· push for firearms "fingerprinting" that has grown from the Washington-area sniper shoot­ings, a spokesman said Tuesday, saying Bush is uncon­vinced of the technology's accu­racy and is concerned about gun owners' privacy. 
Besides, added White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, when it comes to new gun con­trols generally, "how many laws can we really have to stop crime, if people are determined in their heart to violate them no matter how many there are or what they say?" 
But White House officials sen­sitive to Bush's image amid the local sniper crisis later called a meeting with officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and asked them to study technological and feasibil­ity issues that would be involved in a national fingerprinting sys­tem, as well as the experiences of the only two states -New York and Maryland -that cur­rently require such ballistics data to be kept on handguns sold in those states. 
A sniper has struck in the Washington area 11 times in the past 13 days, killing nine people and seriously wounding two others at random. The rifle attacks have revived interest in a national system of "finger­printing" for guns -requiring gun makers to file into a law­enforcement database the dis­tinct markings that each gun leaves on a test-fired shell cas­ing. Police could then possibly use the recorded etchings to trace crime-scene slugs to the weapon that fired them. 
"Ballistic fingerprinting increases the chance of you get­ting a lead that can take you one step closer," said Eric Gorovitz, who tracks gun laws for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. 
Sen. Herb Kohl. D-Wis., and Rep. Robert Andrews, D-N.J., are among those in Congress trying to pass legislation to cre­ate a national system. The National Rifle Association and other gun-rights lobbyists oppose such a system, fearing it is one step down a path to a national database of gun own­ers. 
Bush, too, is resistant as long as he has questions, Fleischer said. 
"There are some issues that are raised with this that deal with the accuracy of the ballis­tic fingerprinting that need to be explored and reviewed before any final determination can be made," Fleischer said in response to three days of ques­tions from reporters. 
Federal and state law officers investigating the Washington­area sniper killings have used such markings to confirm the linkage among the 11 shootings. 
Bush also has concerns about privacy and liberty questions surrounding a national data­base, which Fleischer likened to the prospect of fingerprinting every American. 
"There is an issue about fin­gerprints of course as a very effective way to catch people who are engaged in robbery or theft,'.' Fleischer said. "Is that to say that every citizen in the United States should be finger­printed in order to catch rob­bers and thieves? And these same issues are raised here. The president does believe in the right of law-abiding citizens to own weapons." 
Maryland state Sen. Christopher Van Hollen, who pressed for passage the Maryland law and now is a Democratic candidate for Congress, countered that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms itself testifies to the technology's usefulness. He blamed Bush's resistance on an alliance with the NRA. 
A July 2001 report by ATF found that even the limited computerized ballistic finger­prints currently available to fed­eral law enforcement officials had produced during the pre ceding 15 months 8,800 match­es linking 17,600 crime scenes. 
Gary Mehalik. a spokesman for the Newtown, Conn.-based National Shooting Sports Foundation, elaborated on the gun lobby's accuracy concerns that Bush evidently shares. 
"Fingerprints and DNA don't change, but the interaction of firing a cartridge under terrific pressure with high tempera­tures and forcing one piece of metal through another changes the metal with each pull of the trigger," said Mehalik. "Every time you fire a gun you change the barrel." 
Gorovitz said such changes are inconsequential. and the value of ballistic imagery has been proved repeatedly in tri­als. 
As for the assailant terroriz­ing Washington and its suburbs, the president's spokesman said: "In the case of the sniper, the real issue is values. These are the acts of a depraved killer who has broken and will contin­ue to break laws and so the question is not new laws." 
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle said he is open to hav­ing the Senate look at a national fingerprinting system. 
"I don't think there's any question that it's important for us to review all of those laws and find ways to ensure that law enforcement has every tool available to them," said Daschle, D~SJ).

ISRAEL 
Israel releases chief Muslim cleric 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM 
Jerusalem's chief Muslim 

cleric was questioned by 
Israeli police Tuesday about a 
newspaper interview in 
which he was quoted as 
endorsing suicide bombings. 
lkrima Sabri, 63, was detained at his home and held for three hours at a police compound in Jerusalem before being released without charge. 
In an interview afterward, Sabri said he was misquoted. 
'That newspaper published words that I never said. From the beginning of the uprising, I have been interviewed by more than 1,000 journalists ... and most of them asked about attacks in Israel. My response was that I had no position toward that." 
However, Sabri has often made comments that have outraged Israelis and prompt­ed police to detained him. Incitement to violence is a criminal offense in Israel. 
As mufti of Jerusalem, Sabri is influential, often preaching to thousands at the Al Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's most important reli­gious sites. 
Police questioned Sabri about a June 1 interview in the Dubai-based newspaper Al Bayan. The Arabic news­paper quoted him as saying he "did not see any religious prohibition" against suicide bombings. 
"On the contrary, it is self­defense and one of the suc­cessful types of resistance," he was quoted as saying. 
Omar al-Omar, head of Al­Bayan's international section, said the paper accurately quoted Sabri, ascribing Sabri's denial to Israeli pres­sure. 
"What he said is expected, because he was arrested and forced to say that so he can be freed," al-Omar said. 
There is no consensus in the Islamic world about whether the religion sanc­tions suicide bombings. While some prominent clerics have endorsed them. others have rejected such tactics. 
Sabri's views are generally in line with the Palestinian Authority, which condemns suicide bombings in Israel, but is vague about attacks on Israeli civilians in the West Bank and Gaza. 
Israel argues that the Palestinian leadership bears ultimate responsibility for the attacks and has not made a serious effort to prevent them. 
Sabri, appointed to his post in 1994 by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, was detained briefly by Israeli police in September 2001 and ques­
tioned about a sermon and a 
meeting with Lebanese guer­
rilla leaders. 
At the time Sabri described 
the Palestinian uprising 
against Israel as a "holy war" 
and said that suicide bombers 
and other Muslims killed in 
the conflict were "martyrs." 
"The issue is decided," Sabri said then. "Muslims believe in the Day of Judgment and that dying as a martyr has its reward ­going to heaven -and that a martyr is alive in the eyes of God." 
In other developments Tuesday, an 18-year-old Palestinian was killed in the West Bank town of Tulkarem when Israeli troops opened fire to enforce a curfew, Palestinians said. The Israeli military had no immediate comment. 
Also, Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben­Eliezer said Israeli troops could pull out of the West Bank town of Hebron by the end of the week if the situa­tion there remains calm. 
"I hope that around the weekend this will happen, if the conditions are right." Ben-Eliezer told Army Radio. 
The United States has been pressing Israel to pull out of at least one of the six West Bank cities It still holds after taking over seven cities in June. It had already pulled out of Bethlehem, but main­tains a military presence and often tight curfews on the rest. 
Israeli troops blocked streets leading to a disputed holy site at the edge of Bethlehem on Tuesday, a step toward connecting the area to Jerusalem, witnesses said. 
The Israeli military said sol­diers blocked paths and roads Palestinians had used to sneak around a roadblock and enter Israel illegally. 
Israel decided Sept. 11 to include the West Bank site, where Jews believe the bibli­cal matriarch Rachel is buried, inside a security fence that is to surround Jerusalem. just 500 yards away. That would involve moving the main Israeli army checkpoint between Bethlehem and Jerusalem to the West Bank side of the tomb. A Muslim cemetery is next to the tomb, which was once the site of a mosque. Palestinians reject Israel's claim to the site, though free Jewish access is guaranteed by interim peace acc;ords. 
Also, Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said Arafat would appoint a new Cabinet by the end of the week. Arafat's Cabinet resigned Sept. 11 as the par­liament was poised to vote no confidence in his government.

Indonesian officials interro gated a security guard and another man Tuesday about the deadly nightclub bombing in Bali and said traces of C-4 plastic explosives were found at the scene of the blast. 
With Indonesia under increasing international pres­sure to combat terrorism, a violent Muslim group with ties to Indonesia's military dis­banded -the first apparent sign the government was get­ting serious about moving against Islamic extremism.

Indonesia to crack down on al-Qaida terrorists and local allies blamed for the bombing. President Bush said Monday he planned to talk to Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri about the need to stop terrorism. 
"You cannot pretend it [ter­rorism] doesn't exist in your country," Secretary of State Colin Powell said, adding he hoped the attack "reinforces Indonesia's determination to deal with this kind of threat." 
Police spokesman Maj. Gen. Saleh Saaf said police have questioned at least 47 people about the blast -and that a security guard and another man were being "intensively interrogated." He denied reports the two had been arrested. 
The second man was the brother of a man whose iden­tification card was found at the blast scene. intelligence officers said on condition of anonymity. 
Traces of the military explo­sive C-4 -a puttylike plastic explosive used in the attack two years ago on the USS Cole in Yemen -were found at the scene, National Police Chief Da'i Bachtiar said. Richard C. Reid, the alleged al-Qaida­trained shoe bomber thwarted on an American Airlines flight, packed explosive that appeared to be C-4 into his shoes. 
In past cases in Indonesia, whenever C-4 has been found in any bombing it has been traced to the military, raising speculation the explosive was bought or stolen from military stocks. 
Days after the explosion ripped through the jammed Sari Club, Bali was still strug­gling to cope with the corpses. 
At the island's main hospital -now largely used as a morgue -dozens of volun­teers cared for the bodies, icing them down or loading them into refrigerated con­tainers to slow decomposition in the tropical heat. Australia, which lost dozens in the attack, was arranging for the bodies of its citizens to be repatriated. 
Two American deaths have been confirmed: · Steven Brooks Webster of Huntington Beach, Calif.; and Deborah Snodgrass, who had been liv­ing in Bali. 
U.S. officials said four Americans were injured and between one and four were missing.

as among the missing. 
Dozens of shoulder-high flower wreaths were left at the edge of the morgue, where hundreds of people waited, watched over by armed Indonesian soldiers. 
Indonesia's intelligence chief, Mohamad Abdul Hendropriyono, told reporters his organization was cooperat­ing with foreign agencies in the investigation. 
"This attack has been well planned and it required exper­tise in handling high-tech [bombs]," he said. "It is a very complicated task and is out­side the ability of local hands." 
Megawati's government is in a delicate position -looking for ways to prevent terrorism without sparking further attacks or unrest in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation. 
Laskar Jihad's dissolution is a relatively easy way for Jakarta to show its to extremist violence. 
In recent months, the activi­ties of the group, which has deep ties to Indonesia's mili· tary, have become an increas· ing embarrassment for authorities. 
As the Bush administration pushed to re-establish ties with the Indonesian military -cut in 1999 in the wake of abuses in East Timor -Laskar Jihad's military con­nection was cited by congres­sional critics as proof the mili­tary continued to represent the main threat to the coun­try's fragile democracy. 
Achmad Michdan, legal adviser to Laskar Jihad, which has waged sectarian warfare against Christians on the out­lying Maluku islands, told reporters in Jakarta the group was disbanding. 
Michdan insisted the deci­sion was not connected to the bombing and was rooted in theological issues. "It is an internal matter," he said. 
In Australia, Prime Minister John Howard said his nation 
would  seek the  listing  of  
Jemaah Islamiyah  -a shad­ 
owy  pan-Asian  network  

believed linked to al-Qaida and suspected of involvement in the nightclub bombing -as a terrorist organization. 
Australian officials "have received indications from other countries ... that that move will be supported," he said in Parliament. 
The suspected spiritual leader of Jemaah lslamiyah said he would voluntarily sub­mit to police questioning. Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Bashir planned to meet with police Wednesday in Jakarta, said his brother Umar Bashir. 
The meeting was in connec­tion with a libel case Abu Bakar Bashir has filed against Time magazine, which recent­ly published allegations that implicated him in other terror­ist activities, his brother said. Abu Bakar Bashir has denied involvement in Saturday's blast. 
Jemaah Islamiyah is believed to have four tons of ammonium nitrate, a chemical that has been used to make bombs, purchased by a sus­pected Malaysian member accused of allowing two of

Around campus, the invisible army of campus workers is busy making this school one of the most beautiful places in the world. The bathrooms are spotless, rooms are clean and the food service staff has given us two 
Paul Graham
of the best din­ing halls on any college campus. 

Their work, Another unfortunately, Perspective goes unnoticed and unappreci­ated. Most stu­dents and faculty are unaware of dif­ficulties and problems that most staff people face. Through discussions with workers, I have heard repulsive sto­ries about what it is like to work for this University. 
Last spring, Notre Dame had a meeting with its entire maintenance staff, notifying them that the school will no longer replace maintenance employees who retire, quit or are fired. This creates more work for the remaining staff; not only do they still clean their original sections, but they also have to clean new sections. Maintenance workers are then expected to handle their old duties, which used to take the whole 8-hour day, and add in the new areas and duties from past employees without a raise in wages and the same high standards of quality. 
I spoke with two workers on the night shift in one of the larger build­ings on campus, and they went on for their entire break about how this pol­icy has made working seem like tor­ture. They have more than twice the area as they had before and are still expected to keep the building shiny. I talked to them again later, and they complained during another break about the lack of livable wages. One of them said that she would quit if there were other jobs available (but the unemployment rate was 5.2 per­cent in August and is still growing). 
Another worker from the library broke out into tears, sobbing for the entire length of her break about how she is unable to move to the day shift. She works nights, which puts a strain on her home life. She never sees her husband and her kids. and has had to pick up a second job to help support her family. She wants to start taking night classes, but Human Resources will not allow her to move to days. 
Workers in food service are similar. One worker told me that all she want­ed was to feel as if she was a part of the daily operations. She wanted to have more control over her station so that she could be more efficient and a part of the process. She didn't feel valued and appreciated. This employ­ee also told me that the Staff Advisory Council was just a token bone thrown to the workers. The SAC has the _ power to advise Human Resources, but no actual power for change. 
Our campus employees are paid less than livable wages for the work that they do each day. Most of the staff are paid at level 1, 2 or 3 out of 20 on the University's pay scale. This translates to an hourly wage from $6.29 to $10.78 an hour with many workers earning around $8 .10 to $9.65. At these pay rates, many workers are forced to work two or more jobs. 
These problems should not exist at a Catholic institution like Notre Dame. The Catholic Church has more than 100 years of social teaching that speak of the importance of work and unions. Starting in 1891, when Pope Leo XIII issued "Rerum Novarum," the Church has put a strong emphasis on the rights of labor, including the right to join unions. Work is not a commodity to be bought and sold. The Church teaches that people are more valuable than profits and capi tal. Pope John XX:111.. in "Mater et 
Magistra." declared work as "the 
immediate expression of the human 
personality ... and must not be 
regarded as a mere commodity." 
Pope John Paul II stated in his 
encyclical, "Centesimus Annus," "the freedom to join trade unions and the effective action of unions ... are 
meant to deliver work from the mere condition of 'a commodity' and to guarantee its dignity." 
Workers on campus have attempted to organize in the past, but each drive stopped when workers were fired or the school gave the workers a sudden raise to quiet the voices. Two major occurrences were in 1977 with the grounds crew and in 1996 with the secretaries -in both cases the actions taken by Notre Dame were illegal according to federal law. Most of the workers that I have spoken with want a union, but are too afraid to fight for one. 
Workers on this campus deserve a good union. a voice in their work­place and a chance to have a good job where they are not forced to take on more employment elsewhere. Write a letter to Father Edward Malloy and Father Tim Scully asking for a state­ment of neutrality, which is a state­ment asserting that the school will not hire union busters or fire workers who try to organize. Please consider the workers on campus and write a letter to Malloy and Scully asking them to affirm Catholic social tradi­tion and to support workers' rights here at Notre Dame.

The games people play 
It's amazing the games people play in relationships.

it nostalgia for our youth? Or are we merely filling the void left by afternoons of Twister and Chutes and Ladders with carefully calcu­lated maneuvers meant to confuse, deter and baffle the opposite sex? 
As much as we'd like to hit the jackpot and finrl true love, we spend so much of our time strategizing against the other team and trying to sink everyone else's battleship that it's surprising that any­one dates at all. 
\Ve seem to be caught in an endless power struggle. It has become more about our scoring record and our win­loss statistics than anything else. In all of our efforts of playing not to lose, dating has become less of a splendid notion than an odd game of wits and strategy. We're influenced by friends and spurred by the fear of rejection. We may be hold­ing four aces, but we are often so afraid of showing our hands to anyone else that we end up folding before we even get to show our cards. 
What's amazing is that, as much as we hate to admit it, we all play. We specu­late endlessly and make sure that we compete, but act like we don't put any effort into it. It's the eternal game of one-on-one, but does anyone really win in the end? 
The classic example is the phone call tug of war. We tend to keep tabs on the number of calls we've received or made to the object of our affection. Often, we wait a certain amount of days to return calls, and when we do, we feign unavail­ability, thus making the subtle point that, yes, we have a life, and no, they are not crucial to its existence. It's a back and forth effort that can be tedious, if not exhausting. 
And then, of course, there is the ulti­mate playing field -the Friday night social scene. Rather than immediately striking up a conversation with our intended, we take interest in any other person at the party, all the while keep­ing an eye on our prize. We wait and we watch and when we finally catch that person's attention {casually, of course) we act like we didn't know they were there. At this rate, we're all going to end up the weakest link. 
Even when we're in a relationship, we still play games. It's just round two. For example, when any "talk" in a relation­ship comes up, we often answer in the form of a question: 
"What do you want?" 
"I don't know, what do you think?" 
And it just goes on and on. Obviously, 
this is a technique that really should be 
left to Alex Trebec. 
Relationships have become a game of wits confusing enough to make anyone crazy. It's practically Darwinian. Do we play these games as a way to weed out the weak? Do only the strong survive? \Ve're so busy trying not to be voted off the island that we forget why we were there in the first place. Dating. in theory, isn't about winning. It's something that should be looked at as a team effort. There are only two people involved, both with the same goal. However, rather than joining forces with our intended, we put on our helmets and head out to the battle field. 
Dating should not be about who has the most points or the least whammies. After all, when we play our games and winning becomes our first priority, does it really make sense to want to date the loser? There's no fun in that. 
It can be so exhausting that we're not 
even sure if we want to find out what's 
behind door No. 3. We don't want to 
take that chance anymore. It's like a 
never ending game of Bingo. We may be 
a mere B-15 away from true love, but 
we're still waiting for our number to be 
called. Nevertheless, we keep on play­
ing. 

And luckily, sometimes the price is 
right. We find someone who ends up on 
our team after all. It's like we landed on 
Boardwalk with a hotel on Park Avenue. 
We let our guard down and finally get a 
teammate. It's not about winning or los­
ing anymore. We give up the power 
struggle, throw the Darwin factor out 
the window and forget about a final 
answer. 
We may have had to play the game to get there, sinking a few battleships and folding a few hands along the way. But in the end, it just may be worth it to roll the dice and take that chance. 
Let the games begin.

CONCERT REVIEW

1ence

By DANIEL McSWAIN and SARAH 
SCHNEIDER 
Scene Music Critics 

"I want to have a good time like everybody," seemed to be Adam Duritz's way of connecting with his audience of mainly exhausted, over­worked and midterm-frenzied students during The Counting Crows concert at the Morris Performing Arts Center Tuesday night. 
Although the Counting Crows have never worn the label of the grunge era that they grew out of, they're not exactly a good-timing band either. In the wake of Nirvana and the angst rock revolution of the early '90s, a hole was left open for a more cerebral yet equally emotionally charged style to move into the scene. Enter Counting Crows. A group whose roots were equal parts folk and rock, the Crows' style was unique, mixing morose, somber melodies with intensely personal yet welcoming lyrics. Their first album, August and Everything After, was a multi-platinum overnight success. 
With the help of an MTV hit single, August propelled the band into the forefront of a scene that seemed to eagerly accept their folky style of angst despite its departure from the norm at the time. With their sophomore album, Recovering the Satellites, Counting Crows moved in a pop-wardly direction, putting a lit­tle more glitter and shine into their songs than before. Although the album did not receive the same critical or public embrace as August, it was by no means a disappointment for the band, or for their quickly growing fan base. 
The band's third album, This Desert Life, showcased the band's finely honed talents as. musicians and songwriters. All the songs sprung from improvisational jams in the stu­dio, a feat that shows the truth and power of the emotions in their songs in a very honest way. 
Their latest album, Hard Candy, has been met with the most critical acclaim since their debut. Enlisting the help of veteran songwrit­ers, Ryan Adams and Matthew Sweet, the Crows put together a spotless amalgam of pop sensibilities and engaging lyrics. 
The seven-man band has grown to move seamlessly together, no small feat in an indus­try full of line up changes and ego clashes. The use of underrepresented instruments like the accordion, mandolin, banjo, and upright bass give the Counting Crows a musical depth that is rarely encountered in the form of a tradi­tional songwriting band. It is this, the band's multifaceted arrangement that makes the Counting Crows music complex yet accessible. 
Such was the Crows' performance, ranging from subdued and anticlimactic to emphatic and alive. Their stage setup was a perfect example of this dichotomous existence in which their music thrives. The band took their places before a backdrop of projected wild flowers, with sea of lavender light soaking the stage and setting the mood for their opening lullaby, "Goodnight Elizabeth." Although it is a perfect example of the Crows skillful songwrit­ing, it was an unexpected choice as an opener. But as Duritz soon explained in his first of sev­eral aside, the band had decided on a slightly unorthodox approach to the show that night. 
Perhaps feeling that on this, a Crows tour that concentrated mainly on college towns such as South Bend, a laid-back approach would be more fitting, the band prepared acoustic arrangements of songs that tradition­ally were more upbeat and musically complex. 
While this formula served the band's trade­mark songs like "Omaha" and "Mr. Jones"

NHL 
Wasted opportunity doesn't end Islanders 
Associated Press 
UNIONDALE, N.Y. 

The New York Islanders wast­
ed a rare opportunity in over­
time -and won anyway. 
Adrian Aucoin scored just 3 
seconds after Brad Isbister was 
stopped on a penalty shot, cap­
ping a three~goal comeback as 
New York beat the Nashville 
Predators 4-3 in overtime 
Tuesday night for its first win of 
the season. 
Shawn Bates won a faceoff, 
and Aucoin moved from the 
right point to the center of the 
ice and let go a low slap shot 
that beat goalie Tomas Vokoun 
-who squeezed Isbister's 
penalty shot between his pads 
just seconds before. 
"Players get a mindset that 
something big is going to hap­
pen when you have one of those 
instances," Aucoin said. 
Vokoun was screened 
Aucoin's shot. 
"I couldn't see the shot, and I 
was moving to my right side," he 
said. "He just shot it left." 
Aucoin felt lucky to score. 
"It had eyes -its own eyes"' Aucoin said. "It didn't have my eyes because I missed the net about 15 times tonight." 
Isbister was awarded a penal­ty shot at 1:47 of overtime when he was cut down from behind on a breakaway. Isbister, Vokoun and the puck all crossed the goal line as the net came off its moorings on the play. 
"To tell you the truth, I thought that might have been a goal even before they called the penalty shot," Isbister said. "I honestly thought they were going to go upstairs and look at the tape." 
Instead, Isbister broke in unimpeded on Vokoun, who stood up and squeezed his pads to stop Isbister's five-hole attempt. 
"There was an opening there"' Isbister said. "I just didn't hit it." Vokoun's strategy was to stay patient. 
"Ninety percent of the time, if the shooter makes the first move, the goalie makes the save"' Vokoun said. "I just tried to stay patient and wait for him to do something first." 
Alexei Yashin tied it at 5:56 of the third period when he tipped Raffi Torres' cross-ice pass past Vokoun. 
"I didn't really see the puck coming," Yashin said. "Raffi made a nice play, he just threw it over." 
Dave Scatchard and Mark Parrish also scored for New York, which avoided losing three straight games to start the sea­son for the first time in its 31­year history. 
Chris Osgood had to make 
only 10 saves for the victory. 
Former Islander Andreas 
Johansson scored twice and 
Karlis Skrastins added a goal for 
the Predators, who also picked 
up their first point of the season 
in three games. Vokoun made 
26 saves. 
Johansson scored two power­
play goals to give the Predators 
a 2-0 lead. Scott Walker set up 
both goals. 
The Predators scored 3:01 in 
when Johansson took Scott 
Walker's pass and sent a one­
timer through Osgood's legs for 
a power-play goal. 
Johansson scored again while 
the Predators were up two men 
when Walker's cross-ice pass 
deflected off an Islanders player. 
The puck went right to 
Johansson at the left side, and 
his quick wrist shot beat Osgood 
at 6:16. 
The Islanders dominated the 
second half of the period, and 
had several chances, but 
Scatchard was the only one to 
beat Vokoun, as his rebound 
shot from a sharp angle found 
an open net at 12:56. 
Scatchard had two of the three 
goals the Islanders scored in 
their first seven periods this sea­
son. 

Nashville made it 3-1 on a 3­on-5 short-handed goal 21 sec­onds into the second period. Skrastins moved the puck up to the Islanders' blue line, and using defenseman Kenny Jonsson as a screen, wristed a shot that cleanly beat Osgood to the glove side. 
"I didn't see it," Osgood said. "It was still a bad goal. I didn't give myself a good chance to stop it." 
Parrish answered back with a power-play goal at 7:07. He tipped in Mattias Timander's slap shot. 
Rangers 5, Maple Leafs 4 
The New York Rangers were struggling to find some offense -until Pavel Bure hit the ice. 
Bure had two goals and an assist in his season debut, help­ing the Rangers break out of a two-game scoring slump with a 5-4 victory Tuesday night over the Toronto Maple Leafs. 
New York was outscored 10-1 in two losses following a 4-1 vic­tory over Carolina on opening night. The Rangers went 143 minutes, 28 seconds without a goal. dating to Friday, until Matthew Barnaby scored on a breakaway at 12:24 of the sec­ond period.

has three points this season. 
"It's a funny game," Bure said. "Sometimes you can score lots of goals and sometimes you can go without it. If you ask me what's the difference, I don't know. Sometimes you shoot and it goes in." 
The Maple Leafs dropped their third straight following a 6-0 victory over Pittsburgh to start the season. 
The Rangers scored all their goals after top center Eric Lindros was ejected for board­ing in the second period. 
Bure helped set up Tom Poti's first goal of the season with 2:20 left in the period. New York made it 3-1 at 18:21 when Bure took a perfect pass from Barnaby at the bottom of the right circle and swept a shot into the net. 
Bure made it 4-2 with another power-play goal at 6:49 in the third, when he took a pass from Brian Leetch and scored a near­ly identical goal -putting the puck in while dropping to his left knee.

first home game on Friday and a game at Pittsburgh -both loss­es -due to strep throat. 
"I don't remember when I was sick so much in my life. It was really bad," Bure said. "I couldn't even talk, I couldn't swallow, I couldn't turn my head. And then I had a really big fever as well. It wasn't good." 
Even if he felt up to it, Bure couldn't watch his teammates play without him on television because he hasn't been able to get his apartment wired for cable. 
He took his first shift 49 sec­onds in and helped the Rangers snap a 1 · 1 tie in the second period with an assist. Then he made it 3l with a goal 41 sec­onds later.

51.1 percent of its shots. Miller led the way with 10 points. Magloire had 11 for New Orleans. 
Rookie Ryan Humphrey hit a jump shot at 11 :47 in the sec­ond quarter that put Orlando in the lead for good at 33-32. 
Raptors 93, Cavaliers 76 
Vince Carter scored 19 points, and Jelani McCoy added 18 as the Toronto Raptors beat the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
Alvin Williams added 10 for the Raptors (1-3). who outscored the Cavs 32-12 in the third quarter to turn a two­point deficit into a 7 4-56 lead. 
Ricky Davis led Cleveland with 13 points and Darius Miles had 12 _ all in the first half. Zydrunas Ilgauskas also scored 12 for the Cavs (0-3), the only team without a victory in the preseason. 
Carter made three great plays -two of them passes -in a 12-0 run that put the Raptors ahead 68-54 with 4:15 remain­ing in the third. 
He started the surge by bank­
ing in a layup over Ilgauskas 
and Davis after switching the 
ball from his right to left hand. 
Carter then threw a two­
handed pass over his head to 
Antonio Davis for a dunk and 
an alley-oop to Morris Peterson. 
Toronto made 13-of-20 shots 
in the third quarter. A 14-of-39 
performance in the first half 
put the Raptors behind 44-42. 
Miles, acquired from the Los 
Angeles Clippers in a July for 
Andre Miller, played well for a 
half. He had two dunks, showed 
quick moves in the low post and 
made a nice shuffie pass in the 
paint to Carlos Boozer for a 
dunk. 
He didn't do much of any­
thing after halftime, and the 
Cavs quickly fell behind by dou­
ble figures and couldn't recov­
er. 

Pistons 106, Mavericks 102 
Rookie Mehmet Okur led a 
balanced attack with 14 points 
and 10 rebounds as the Detroit 
Pistons overcame a 37-point 
performance by Dirk Nowitzki 
and beat the Dallas Mavericks. 
The Pistons (3-0) had six players in double figures, including Chucky Atkins with 16 points and Richard Hamilton with 15. 
Nick Van Exel added 14 points for Dallas (2-2), which played without head coach Don Nelson, who didn't make the trip because of back spasms. The Mavericks were missing players Michael Finley (knee), Popeye Jones (ankle) and Tariq Abdul-Wahad (knee). Donnie Nelson coached the team in his father's absence. 
Detroit led 7 4-71 after three quarters, but Corliss Williamson had six points in a 9-3 run that made it 85-78 with seven minutes left. 
Nowitzki hit consecutive 3­pointers to make it a one-point game with 6:14 left, and Van Exel added Dallas' third 3 in a row to put the Mavericks ahead. 
The teams traded the lead until a putback by Okur and two free throws by Williamson gave Detroit a 94-90 lead with 
2: 10 to go. After a Dallas 

turnover, Okur scored on 
another offensive rebound. 
Two 3s by Nowitzki brought 
Dallas within 103-100 and then 
a missed free throw by Detroit 
gave the Mavericks the ball 
with 11 seconds left. 
This time, Nowitzki shot an 
airball and Atkins put the game 
away from the free throw line. 
Nets 104, Celtics 92 
Richard Jefferson and Jason 
Kidd helped New Jersey open a 
21-point lead early in the third 
quarter, and the Nets used an 
inside advantage to beat the 
Boston Celtics. 
Jefferson and Lucious Harris 
has 14 points apiece, and Kidd 
and Rodney Rogers added 12 
each as the Nets (3-0) beat the 
Celtics (2-1) in their first meet­
ing since New Jersey took 
Boston in six games in the 
Eastern Conference finals. 
Paul Pierce had 21 points and 
eight rebounds for the Celtics, 
who struggled inside handling 
Dikembe Mutombo. He had 11 
rebounds in leading a 55-40 
advantage on the boards for 
New Jersey. 
The rebounding edge helped 
New Jersey enjoy a 20-1 advan­
tage in fast break points. 
Pierce didn't have much help. Bruno Sundov had most of his 15 points in garbage time and Antoine Walker had most of his 14 points in the second after the Nets took a big lead. 
The Celtics also sustained a 
couple of injuries. Center Tony 
Battie bruised his knee and for­
ward Vin Baker sprained an 
ankle in the third quarter. 
Neither returned, although the 
team said the injuries were not 
considered serious. 
What was obvious was that the Nets looked like they had improved underneath since the last season and the Celtics seemed to be looking for answers at the point guard spot and help on the boards. 
Rogers, who helped the Nets open the preseason with two wins by scoring late in those games, had six of his 12 points in a 13-4 second-quarter spurt that led New Jersey to a 52-41 halftime lead. 
Jefferson and Kidd took over in the third quarter, combining for 13 points in a 16-6 spurt that gave the Nets a 68-47 lead. 
There were seven technicals fouls in the game, six against Celtics. 
Wizards 87, Nuggets 82 
Jerry Stackhouse scored 29 points and the Washington Wizards scored the last six points of the game for a victory over the Denver Nuggets. 
Forward Kwame Brown 
added 15 points and 10 
rebounds for the Wizards (3-0). 
Michael Jordan has yet to play 
for Washington in the presea­
son as he rests his right knee. 
James Posey led the Nuggets 
(1-2) with 20 points. 
Denver took an 82-81 lead on 
Vincent Yarborough's 3-pointer 
with 1:52 to play but didn't 
score again. 
The Nuggets turned the ball 
over on each of their last three 
possessions, and the Wizards 
took the lead for good on two 
free throws by Stackhouse with 
55 seconds remaining. 
Tyronn Lue and Etan Thomas 
each added 11 points each for 
Washington, which shot 50.8 
percent from the field. 
Juwan Howard scored 11 
points for Denver and Kenny 
Satterfield and Chris Andersen 
each added 10 for the Nuggets. 
who shot 42.9 percent. 
Brown and Brendan Haywood 
each blocked three shots for the 
Wizards, who also played with­
out veterans Charles Oakley 
and Byron Russell. 
The Nuggets rested their 
starters in the fourth quarter. 
Timberwolves 127, Bulls 101 
Kevin Garnett was once 
where Tyson Chandler and 
Eddy Curry are now, and on 
Tuesday night he gave the 
Chicago Bulls' young forwards 
a few lessons. 
Garnett scored 27 points as 
the Minnesota Timberwolves 
beat the Chicago Bulls. 
Garnett, entering his eighth season, was guarded primarily by second-year forwards Chandler and Curry, who like Garnett came to the NBA directly from high school as unpolished works in progress. 
He took control of the game early, scoring 15 points in the first 15 minutes and finishing 12-of-l 5 from the field with nine assists and eight rebounds in 29 minutes. 
"I approach a preseason game like a regular season game," Garnett said. "You want to play hard. I don't see any­thing different between these games and the regular season." 
The Wolves, who were play­ing without three starters, used 14 players. All of them scored. Seven Minnesota players scored in double figures, as the Wolves improved to 3-0 in the presea­son. 
Troy Hudson added 15 points for the Wolves. Hudson, signed in the off-season as a backup for Terrell Brandon, is likely to start the season at point guard as Brandon continues to recov­
er from surgery to repair carti­
lage damage in his left leg. 
Hudson had scored 19 points 
in the team's last preseason 
game, a 90-85 win over Miami. 
Timberwalves coach Flip 
Saunders likes the energy he 
brings to a young, athletic 
team. 
"I like what I've seen of 
Hudson so far," Saunders said. 
"He gets the ball up the court, 
and can get us into our offense 
quickly. He moves the ball 
well." 
The Wolves also got strong 
games off the bench from 
guards Randy Livingston and 
Kendall Gill, both of whom 
were also acquired in the off­
season. Livingston scored 13 
points and Gill scored 12 points. 
Livingston scored 11 of his 
points in the fourth quarter 
after sitting for much of the 
first three. 
Minnesota, which beat the 
Bulls by a franchise record 53 
points last November, put this 
one away early as well. The 
Wolves led by as many as 16 
points in the first half and 63­
51 at halftime. They extended 
the lead to 29 points with a 28­
11 run to start the third quar­
ter. 
"Our defense was terrible, 
especially in transition," Curry 
said. "We were a step slow." 
Jamal Crawford led the Bulls 
(1-3) with 20 points and Jay 
Williams added 18. 
Rockets 96, Spurs 93 
Cuttino Mobley scored 18 of his 22 points in the second half to lead the Houston Rockets to a 96-93 victory over the San Antonio Spurs in a preseason game Tuesday night. 
Kenny Thomas had 13 points, Terence Morris 12 and Glen Rice and Maurice Taylor 10 each for the Rockets (2-0). 
San Antonio (2-2) was led by Tony Parker with 15 points, fol­lowed by Tim Duncan with 14 and Stephen Jackson with 13. 
Houston led 62-61 with 5:37 left in the third period. Mobley then scored nine of Houston's next 16 points to boost the Rockets to a 78-69 advantage at the end of the quarter. 
A 3-point shot by Jackson cut the Houston lead to 91-89 with 
1:40 left, but a 3-point shot by Taylor and a basket by Mobley gave Houston a 96-91 edge with 1 :03 left and secured the victory. 
Houston took a 20-14 lead with 5:05 left in the first period after outscoring the Spurs 13-2. The Rockets led 30-24 going into the second quarter.

Associated Press 

DETROIT 
Kirk Gibson returned to the Detroit Tigers on Tuesday, joining manager Alan Trammell's staff as a bench coach on the team he led to a World Series title.

The Tigers also have hired former Detroit catcher Lance Parrish as bullpen coach and retained Juan Samuel as a third base coach. Both signed two-year contracts. 
Last week, Trammell -also a former Tigers star ­became Detroit's fifth manag­er since Sparky Anderson's 17-season tenure ended in 1995.

"The situation is not per­fect, but with baby steps, we're headed in the right direction. I'm so excited." 
With veterans that didn't 
perform as well as expected and prospects rushed to the major leagues, the Tigers tied Tampa Bay for the worst mark in the majors with a 55­106 record. It was Detroit's ninth straight losing season. 
"Gibby has seen this up close, so he knows what it's going to take to get it back," Trammell said. "And really, we all know what it's going to take: a lot of hard work." 
Gibson, who was not avail­
able for com­m e n t Tuesday, was an analyst on Fox Sports Net's broad­casts of Tigers games for the past five seasons and a host on 
WXYT's 
radio's "The L o c k e r Room" show. 
Gibson spent 12 of 17 seasons in the major 

leagues with the Tigers from 1979-87 and 93-95. He batted .268 with 255 homers and 870 RBIs. 
The outfielder provided some memorable moments in the World Series. 
In 1988, with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, Gibson hit a two-run, pinch homer off Dennis Eckersley to give Los Angeles a 5-4 victory over Oakland in Game 1 of the World Series. Gibson, who did not start because of a strained left knee, limped around the bases as the Dodgers won one of the most dramatic games in Series his­tory and went in 
runs to lead 
Detroit to an 

8-4 victory and the World Series in five games over the San Diego Padres. 
The Pontiac, Mich., native was drafted by both the Detroit Tigers and the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals after a standout career as an out­fielder and wide receiver at Michigan State. He was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1999.

White Sox drastically cut Thomas' s 

Associated Press 
CHICAGO 

The Chicago White Sox invoked a contract clause that drastically reduces Frank Thomas' salary, clearing the way for the two-time MVP to become a free agent. 
The White Sox sent Thomas a letter on Oct. 6 telling him they were invok­ing a "diminished skills" clause in his contract, a lawyer with knowledge of the talks said Tuesday on condition of anonymity. That clause would reduce his base pay to $250,000, and defer most of his nearly $10 million salary. 
Thomas' contract says he had seven days following the notification to choose whether to become a free agent, although the sides have discussed extending that deadline, possibly to the end of this week.

Thomas said last month he intends to stay with the White Sox, with whom he's spent his entire career. 
"I expect to be back next year, fully," he said after the last game of the season at Comiskey Park. 
Thomas' contract calls for him to be paid $9,927,000 in each of the next four sea­sons, including $3,827,000 deferred with interest. But because he didn't make the All-Star team and isn't

going to finish among the top 10 in MVP voting or win a Silver Slugger this season, the White Sox can cut his salary. 
They would then have to pay him only $250,000 plus $10,125,000 deferred over 10 years without interest. 
Thomas can choose to ter­minate the contract and become a free agent. If he does, he would then have 45 days to explore the mar­ket or return to the White Sox contract. 
The Chicago Tribune reported Tuesday that the White Sox intended to invoke the "djminished skills" clause. 
Thomas signed the con­tract Sept. 30, 1997, after winning the AL batting title. He'd hit at least 20 home runs with a .300 average and 100 walks, 100 runs and 100 RBIs for seven straight seasons. 
He was runner-up for the AL MVP in 2000 after hit­
ting .328 
and reach­

to the AL 

Central title. 
But he missed most of last season after tearing a tri­ceps and was batting just .239 before the All-Star break, the lowest average of his career. 
He was also the center of controversy just before the All-Star break when, unhappy about being benched, he skipped a pregame stretching session. 
But he picked up his game in the final month, and fin­ished the season with a .252 average, 28 home runs and 92 RBIs.

Holiday no longer cause for concern 
By KATIE McVOY 
Associate Sports Editor 
For the first time in three weeks, Notre Dame quarter­back Carlyle Holiday's shoul­der isn't the cause for too much concern. Neither is his status as the starter. 
After passing for 145 yards against Pittsburgh Saturday, the junior signal caller is back as the unquestioned Irish starter. And his health is fine. 
"My shoulder is really fine," he said. 
Holiday played a more ten­tative run game Saturday, running less risk of get­his hands a little bit more. 
High ball 
The Irish will be playing high Saturday, high altitude that is. Air Force, situated high above sea level in Colorado Springs, may offer Notre Dame some added diffi­culty as the team adjusts to the mountain air. But the Irish coaching staff believes that their team is prepared. 
"I think you're in good phys­ical condition," Diedrick said. "I think if you hydrate really well, I think most of it is more mental-mind kind of thing."

Despite limit­that he has ing Holiday's used all options, the Bill Diedrick season and

injury may offer Holiday an opportunity to practice patience in the pocket. 
"I think in some ways it really does kind of help him." said offensive coordinator Bill Diedrick. "It's kind of like one of those choke collars -you start to do something and it grabs you back. I think in a way it's made him be a little bit more, not only patient. but I think also get the ball out of

making 

any adjust­ments based on the altitude. 
"As long as both teams have to play at the same level, I am okay," Willingham said. " ... I think we have been rotating our guys pretty much at all of our key positions, those positions especially that we feel like we have the abili­ty to rotate, and we'll contin­ue that." 
Battling back 
Although coaches say he's still learning, Arna.z Battle is becoming a weapon for the Irish. In Saturday's game against Pittsburgh, Battle had 10 receptions for 101 yards, just one reception short of the 11-reception total he had for the entire rest of the season heading into the game. 
"I think Arnaz Battle has done a great job of slowly learning the position," Willingham said. " ... In my estimation he's really just starting to learn the position ... so, participating and play­ing every week is allowing him to grow and learn the position better." 
In addition to growing each game, Battle has ha,g some successes that have boosted his confidence. The game­winning touchdown reception against Michigan State was the first in a string of success­ful performances. 
"I hope that every small and every large success that he had just allows him to grow immeasurably so we can get, hopefully, the kind of offen­sive play that we think could come out of our offense." Willingham said.

rival Brigham Young University. 
"They basically run the option to perfection," Irish safety Glenn Earl said. "If you want to watch a training tape on how to run the option, watch what they're doing." 
One thing that can make a triple option offense deadly is the quar­terback who runs it. He needs to be smart, quick and calm on the field to read opposing defenses and exploit missed assignments for the big plays. 
Air Force has one of the best in Chance Harridge. The junior aver­ages 102.5 yards per game on

Keenan picked up its first win of the season in convincing fashion, pounding O'Neill 20-0 behind a solid all-around effort. 
The win keeps the Knights' playoff chances alive for at least one more week. 
The difference in this week's game was improvement in Keenan's tackling ability, said captain Brent Morlok. 
"The key this week was our

"That's what makes the wishbone such a good offense with a quarterback like Air Force has, because every one of the 11 guys has to play their technique, or he's going to find a crease and break it off for big yardage." 
If the Irish are to stop the option Saturday, they are going to need to limit Harridge.  
"Their leading ball carrier is the quarterback, and he seems to want to carry the ball more than pitch it," Baer said. "I don't think you can defend everything in this. You've got to get off blocks, get off the ground and get after the ball, and that's basically how we're approaching this."

Backup quarterback Josh Gentine started in place of injured starter Patrick Downsey and had a good performance. He threw for a touchdown and also ran one into the end zone. · 
"[Gentine] only had two prac­tices," Morlok said. "He did really well and kept his cool." 
With the loss, O'Neill ended its season at 0-4.

After being ranked as high as No. 5 in polls this season, Notre Dame hit hard times on the road in Big East play. Despite playing very solid against St. John's and Rutgers, Notre Dame could manage only a loss and a tie dur­ing that weekend. The next setback came against Pittsburgh in overtime. But the team regrouped and has won 
its last two games, 
both 1-0 victories.

begins. If the Irish don't get an automat ic bid, they could still receive a regional invitation to the tournament by doing well against regional foes, including Michigan State. 
"This game is just as big because it's a regional game," senior co-captain Justin Radcliffe said. "There are only so many spots for the NCAA tourna­ment and a win could help us." 
The Irish also have the luxury of playing at home for the first time in weeks. Not having to travel is a nice change of pace for the team, Radcliffe said. 
"We really haven't been home since the beginning of the season," Radcliffe said. "So it'll be nice to be home, and the Boston College 
game was even big­
ger," Radcliffe said. " We were playing well but not getting the results we wanted. Against Boston College we played well and we deserved that win." 
Radcliffe also said the team will not change its game plan against the Spartans or any opponent the rest of the season. 
"I think we're at the point where we go out and we try not to change any­thing for our opponents," Radcliffe said. "If we do that, we think that we'll get the results we want."

The Saint Mary's soccer team will seek revenge against conference rival Albion College today, after los­ing 4-2 earlier this season. 
Captain Lynn Taylor said the team should be confident and ready to play in front of a home crowd. 
"It will help playing this team at home this time," Taylor said. "It's easier to get excited playing at home with our fans there." 
The home game gives the team, who has not won since Sept. 28, a chance to get back on the winning 

track.
