Provost defends '74-'75 calendar at SLC meeting 
by Jeanne Murphy Staff Reporter 
"I feel the calendar will justify itself next year. It should be reviewed after spending one autumn semester to see what it is like," contended Father James Burtchaell as he addressed a full audience at the SLC meeting last night in the CCE auditorium. 
The newly proposed calendar for the 74-75 school year was the topic of the meeting. Approximately 250 members of the Academic Council, administrators, faculty and students attended the meeting to hear Burtchaell speak about the complexities of the calendar, its history, and its objections. 
Burtchaell stressed that the calendar is a cohesive decision already made. It was passed and abandoned by the Academic Council and passed again after reconsideration. "I am not prepared to say it can't be undone," he ·said, but he believes it would be better to review it after trying for one semester. 
The proposed calendar passed by the Council on December 14, 1972, starts classes before Labor Day with a ten-day break in mid-October and terminates the fall semester by December 20. The calendar was passed by the Council by a 20..19 vote, with twenty eight members absent. 
return to 72 days 
The Provost enumberated several complexities which surround the new calendar. He realizes that because of these complexities or variables, everyone will be displeased with some feature of the calendar. With this in mind, he cited the "Crosson Rule" coined by Dean Crosson which states that "no calendar will be pleasing to everybody." 
The Hall Presidents Council in turn has offered a 
substitution for the "Crosson Rule" by stating that "all 
calendars should be pleasing to at least somebody." 
The first problem in making a calendar is the that 
the first semester must end before Christmas, he said. 
In 1968 the Academic Council changed the previous 
rule in which the fall semester ended in mid-January. 
The trouble with cramming in a full semester's work 
before Christmas, he claimed, is the lack of an ap­
propriate break or rest time. 

He explained that the student body population at 
Notre Dame is a "national" one. Only fifteen percent 
of the student live in Indiana, and thus, the remaining 
eighty-five per cent must make use of pulbic tran­
sportation or automobiles. This is one reason why the 
exam period was reduced from 'l to five days, so that 
students have ample time to get home for Christmas. 
Up until 1968 there was a five and a half day class 
week, Burtchaell continued. Since then, classes have 
not been scheduled for Saturday. Thus, in making a 
calendar, it is necessary to keep a five day class week, 
creates the second problem. 

The third complexity effecting the calendar is 
retaining parity with other accredited institutions. 
Burthcaell claimed that there should be a "unified 
class experience" among institutions. Thus, 
"anything under the average seventy-two class days 
per semester is under par," he explained. 
He called attention to the fact that the 74-75 calendar 
has only seventy one days in the fall semester and 
baled this to negligence. "We're not satisfied with that 
and we're working our way back," he said. "Our goal 
is to return to a seventy two class day.'' 
no Thanksgiving break 
Student reactions t,o Burtchaell's talk were by no 
means favorable. John Mazza, student member on the 
Academic Council, claimed that losing two academic 
days is no excuse. He believed that ND accreditation 
would not be effected by having a seventy-day class 
semester. 

Mazza also stated that following the "trend" of other 
institutions in starting before Labor Day, as Burtchaell 
mentioned, ND isinconsistentin still maintaining their 
policies of "in loco parentis" and other traditional 
ideals. 

Burtchaell also cited a need to have a common 
calendar with St. Mary's College if the co-ex program 
iscontinuedand expanded. "The program would break

GPA marks CPA course students 
Account dept list sets priorities
~ 
Butch Ward and Tom Drape 
A mimeographed list of names and grade-point averages of Notre Dame's senior accounting majors was released to those seniors Wednesday for determining which seniors would be eligible for a CPA coaching course. 
The list, which included the grades of two-thirds of the department's seniors, was distributed to the group during pre-registration by Dr. Ray Powell, Accounting Department chairman, according to one accounting major. 
That senior, who wished to remain unnamed, credited Powell with describing the list as con­fidential material, and as stating that no alternative method could be found for determining which of the department's 167 seniors would be eligible for the 105 available positions in the course's three sections. 
The CPA course is offered as preparation for those students intent upon taking the Certified Public Accountant examination, to be offered in May, 1974. Those who pass all five parts of the exam are then certified as CPA's. 
Sources in the Accounting school cited a shortage of available teachers as the reason behind the depart­ment's inability to provide all senior accounting majors with the opportunity to take the course. But there existed dissension concerning Powell's decision to make the list of grades public to accounting majors. 
Dissension over publication of the list arose from reports that the G.P.A.'s were released without the consent of those seniors included on the list. 
According to tworectorscontacted Thursday night, the registrar has ceased to release outright semester reports to hall rectors because of the rising call for confidentiality with regards to G.P.A.'s. 
One member of the law school also commented that pressure from prospective employers was ignored during a confrontation regarding the law school's release of grades to those employers two years ago. That student stated that student opinion prevented 'he release of any grades. 

down if we can't bring the calendar into harmony," he said. "We must secure the acquiesence of St. Mary's College." 
The last problem in formulating a calendar ac­cording to Burtchaell, is what is an appropriate break? When should a break be scheduled? And how long should the break last? 
In answering these questions Burtchaell talked about the stringent class cutting system in the past versus the lenient cut system today. Because professors are not as strict on attendance today, students "erode" breaks before holidays. 
Personally, Burtchaell is in favor of a long October break with only one day off for Thanksgiving Day it­self. He feels that a break should not be a "guilt period" for students to catch up on work but rather a rest time away from the books. 
The breaks should be long enough so that students can travel to the East coast without spending a large · portion of the time in their cars. 
Mazza and other members of the SLC impressed the fact that seventy-four percent of the student would prefer a long Thanksgiving vactiaon instead of an Octobe break. Students would rather spend Thanksgiving with family .and friends instead of a week in October when there would be nothing to do. 
One faculty member expressed a desire for a week off atrhanksgivingand sympathized with the students. He finds that ttle rhythym of his courses are in­terrupted because of the two break periods. It is almost "anti-intellecutal" having to plan a semester around two break periods.. He also compared the cutting of classes before each break and concluded that there was more of an erosion of the October break than at Thanksgiing. 
After he finished his comments, he was applauded by the students in the audience and the SLC. Burtchaell recounted the history of the new calendar beginning in 1968 when major revisions were made in

Presently the University registrar refuses to release any grades without the consent of the student. 
Transcripts are issued to employers and graudate schools only upon thestudent'sjirective and endorsed application. 
When contacted Thursday night about the grade release, Powell responded to News Editor Tom Drape's request for comments by hanging up the phone. Fath~r Ja~1es Burtchaell, University Provost, had no Immediate comment on the incident. 
Vincent Raymond, Assistant Dean of Business Admi.nistration s~id .that he had "every confidence that It (the publication of the list) was not an ar­bitrary decision and there was a well-thought out rationale for it." 
Disse~sion also continued over the inability of the accountmg department to provide all seniors with the coaching course. Raymond, in commenting on the issue of whether the people near the bottom of the accounting grade list needed the course more than those with high grades, said "I just don't know''

Student reactions vary 
by Mike Dewey Staff Reporter 
-Emotions ran high at yester­day's Student Life Council meeting concerning the controversial new calendar adopted by the Univer­sity. As the meeting was ad­jow·ned, several students offered 
reactions  to  what  they  had  just  
witnessed.  
Mark Farrell.  a  freshman,  did  

not like the new calendar. "I see no reason why the break can't be taken at Thanksgiving. If there was such a mandate of 2300 people in 1971, why did they even bother to adopt a new calendar?" h·~ asked. 
"I can't see staying at a place wn1ch doesn't respect nine-tenths of the students opinion," sophomore Kevin Price said. 
"I'd like to see how much progress the University makes before Labor Day if 89 per cent of the students decide not to come," Vincent Ravaschierre, a sophomore commented. 
John Salveson, a freshman, suggested that "varsity football

"I don't see why the University can't have the Thanksgiving bnak like everybody else wants it to be," freshman Mike Welsh said. 
Gary McDonald, a sophomore, commented, "I just question whether there's any form of democracy whatsoever." 
Junior Bob McCreevy suggested that student pressure might be misdirected. "The only thing we can do now, as I see it, is to put pressure on the Academic Council to revise the calendar. The pressure should not have placed on Father Burtchaell. I think he took an undue amount of abuse tonight from some of the students," he said. 
Fred Graver, a sophomore, called the calendar "irrational." "I think Fr. Burtchaell showed a lot of reason and rationality in a lot of the things he said. But the biggest irrationality of all is the fact that he insists on inflicting tt.is calendar upon us. This is after we have shown what we think about it. 
I think even members of the Academic Council, which he relies upon so heavily, have shown what theythink of it," he said. 
"There's another meeting of the Academic Council coming up-­maybe it's time for a re-vote. Fr. Burtchaell 's insistence that this calendar is permanent is non­sense," Graver suggested. 
Law school star1~s summer prograr.o.

Bud Drinkers, can you figure this out? 
Ralph bought a 6-pak of Budweiser,., and invited four friends over to share it. Since he bought, he expected to have two cans to himself, but unfortunately when he returned to the refrigerator for his second, he found it missing. So he asked who took it. AI said, "Joe drank it." Joe said, "Dan drank it." Dan said, "Joe, that's a lie!" And Bill said, "I didn't drink it." If only one of these statements is true, who really drank it?

To centralize photocoping 
Dept. of Printing, Publications formed 
by Claude Devaney Staff Reporter 
A Department of Printing and Publications is in the process of being set up at NotreDame. The department, headed by Ronald Parent, will centralize the control of printing and photocoping done on campus. 
The department will offer printing and publications assistance to all departments of the University. 
Parent, director of publications since 1970, said, "The department will not play a disruptive kind of t·ole in what other people are doing." 
Specifications, placement, cost, and graphics of all University publications, except student publications and University Press books, will be controlled by the new department. Parent stressed the fact that flexible procedures would be set up. He said his department would not interfere in any way With the editorial in­tegrity of other departments. 
According to Parent, the publications department would be the logical place to make production decisions, because its staff has the experience and knowledge for this type of work. 
The objectives of the department are to maintain a uniform level of high quality in all publications effi_ciently and at a low cost. 
The department, which is now under the Office of Public Relations and Development wiU expand its staff to include a full­time designer and an assistant designer effective January 1. Design was previously done on a free-lance basis. 
Photocopying and duplicating will also be under the new department in order to insure proper, efficient and economical operation of these services. 
A consulting firm study found 
that the University spent $222,000 
last year on photocopying. 
Although high, this figure is noi out of hand according to Parent. ·He said it was fairly reasonable. Parent plans to meet with all those concerned in this matter before making any final decisions on the photocopy matter. He plans to find alternatives in terms of cost and efficiency. These alternatives would come from a review of the cost and present technology of these machines. The department would inform deans and department ~eads of the technology and op­twns. The final decisions would lie with the various deans. The consulting firm also studied the relationship between Notre Dame and the Ave Maria Press. Parent stated that they found the University was getting high quality printing at much cheaper prices than outside the University. Printing on this campus is very well handled by Ave. It is a very good_ product for the dollar, ac­cordmg to Parent. 
Lack of commuters terininates off-campus shuttle bus service 
by Tom Kreney 
Staff Reporter 
The off-campus shuttle bus will end service today, Student Body Vice President Mike Geisinger announced yesterday. Geisinger cited the cost of the shuttle as the reason for cancellation. 
"To make it economically feasible or at least worth our while, we needed about 400 riders a day," said Geisinger. He explained that approximately 70 students rode the shuttle each day. 
The shuttle bus, which began its run November 7, was an attempt by student government to service outlying campus areas of high student population. 
"We were trying to provide some service to off campus students," said Geisinger, explaining the original rationale for the ex­periment. "They pay the same student government fee." 
Geisinger pointed out that those 
students who rode the bus 
regularly were very enthusiastic. 
Some students had suggested 
changes in the bus route and 
schedule. But Geisinger 
concluded, "People have found 
other ways of getting to campus." 
Geisinger does nor foresee 
shuttle sevice being resumed next 
semester. He discounts the 
possibility of the administration 
providing funds for continuing the 
bus. 
"Since· we weren't able to make 
it a success I don't think the ad­
ministration will give any money," 
he noted.

It is with deep regret that Student Government must announce the can. cellation of the Off campus Bus Shuttle. The bus shuttle was initiated on an experimental basis as a service for the Off Campus student; unfortunately, there does not appear to be enough interest in the service to make it economically feasible. We had con­sidered several revisions in the route and the time schedule in the hope of increasing ridership. Perhaps, if the 
, ·initial response to the bus service had IJeen more substantial, we might have instituted fseveral. of these changes, but it appears as though no amount of revision will increase ridership enough to make the project a suc·cess.

Although we must discontinue this particular service to the Off Campus students, we have every intention of continuing our efforts to provide new and expanded serrvices. We are, 110wever, at a loss for ideas on how to accomplish this and, therefore, welcome any ideas that you may have. 
Please feel free to stop by the Student Government Office at any time to discuss any of these ideas. We took a risk with the shuttle bus and we were not successful, but we are willing to take new risks and we need your input. 
Thank you for your interest in Student Government.

Parent feels the department will produce high quality materials. He bases this opinion on the past performance of the present publications Office from which the new department was formed. Its reputation comes_from doing good publications, such as The Notre Dame Magazine, Parent said. The magazine, has become one of the top ten college magazines in the country in less than two years time, an achievement which Parent finds incredible.

The Calendar 
j seth 
The 74-75 academic calendar is presenting a problem we may be failing to fully comprehend or at least recognize. Both the students and the administration want what is best for Notre Dame. Neither of us however will admit the other's definition of "Notre Dame." The administration seems somewhat muddled in its definition, while the students appear quite clear in theirs. 
The students define Notr" Dame as essentially the people who study, teach, and live in the academic community of this place called Notre Dame duLac. We feel our voice should be sincerely listened to and taken with some credance\sinceit is the students that are being most immediatelyaffected by such things as a change in the academic calander. Some of us see work days cut short and much needed moey not earned. Some of us see that week at the end of the summer set aside for vacation disappear. Some foresee being stuck here for the midsemester breaks without the dining halls or the Huddle being open. 
Others have different reasons and few will say they would rather start heforeLabor Day There :!efinitely is a student ~,.;nited front on this issue. 
The administration would define "Notre Dame" in a much ex­panded form ancl therefore less concrete. The administration would add to the students definition all the people that lived and will live in this community. It is on these grounds that it justifies not acting on sincere and expressed student rationale. The adminstration is mainly concerned with the consequences ofof a post-Labor Day start. By starting before Labor Day we will no longer have a four day mid­semester break. The administration will therPforeremove from the professors the problem of forcing students to stay here until the ap­pointed time and day. The semester willendless cramped and less full of a strain. More time will be spent away from the University making the lime spent here more fertile. All ofthese "benefits" improve the academic quality of Notre Dame the institution and so indirectly the people now here and those of the past and future as well. 
But what of the new morality this Umversity is trying to develop in the men and women that are maturing here in the light of a desperate lack of marality in our nation's leadership" The administration is working at crosspurposes One wants to increase the development of the students here--the University going co-ed, the attempt to impress on the faculty the need to teach more than the academics of a subject by the necessary morality of man's existence as well, student members on most of the llniversity's councils. The other wants to improve the University to the degree that education would become nearly tape recorder-like if the student 711-235438 puts in four years of academics at Notre Dame then he is among the top 50 per cent of the country. This "other"type of Notre Dame does not allow student imput to the issues that concern them. 
All want the best possible education NotreDame~an provide. Each student makes Notre Dame his home for four long years. It becomes our community in that we are concerned and anxious over what it does and what happens to it. We share in its successes voice on an issue that directly affects them where is the morality of failing to hear what is being said. If need be, make us suffer the consequences our voices dictate. Let us learn more than what is the acadmeic of this com­munity of Notre Dame.

Accusecl of misconduct 
CHICAGO (UP!) -Former 
U.S. 
Attorney Thomas A. Foran Thursday accused Chicago Seven defense lawyer William 

M. 
Kunstler of fomenting courtroom disturbances during the 1969-70 riot conspiracy trial. 


Foran, who was chief govern­ment prosecutor at the trial, testified as a witness for the government which is trying five of the original Chicago Seven and their two attorneys on contempt citations imposed at the end of the trial on Feb. 14, 1970. 
Foran said Kunstler was to 
.blame for an outburst which ended in the gagging and shackling of then Black Pan­ther Party Chairman Bobby Seale.

"There have been some favorable com­ments about this idea. It would make the atmosphere more con­benial," Aronson suggested.

He added, "This should not have any substantial effect on the workload of the student workers."

Knevel summarized the com­mittee's opinion saying, "I want to see the project completed and I think the students want it to." He 
added that he would continue working on the project. 
"Mr. Kunstler took Seale down the primrose path by leading him and the court to believe he was Seale's lawyer," Foran testified. 
Kunstler did not reveal he was not representing Seale until after the trial had started, Foran said. 
Seale testified earlier in the current trial that his outburst 
was  triggered by  the  refusal  of  
U.S.  District  Judge  Julius  J.

Panel discussion in Farley Hall 
by Jane Thornton 
Staff Reporter
"Signs of our times: Sacraments as Practical" will be the topic for a panel discussion led by Fr. Dick Conyers, Assistant Keenan Rector, and Frs. Carl Dehne and Giles Pater, doctoral candidates in the liturgy depart­ment, at 7:30p.m., Sunday night, in the Farley Hall chapel. 
Farley residents had requested 
penance services and other forms 
of liturgy. Farley junior and 
coordinator Barb Budde said, "We 
felt the need to explore the 
sacraments as an expression of 
man's basic needs and relationship 
to God." 
All students are invited. 
Calendar survey 
(continued from page 3) 
questioned the validity of Burt­chaell's reasoning: "We did not see any vote or poll publicized nor were we ever approached as a group of individuals. We therefore question the validity of this can­vass. We would like to know exactly who was polled and precisely what was asked of them." 
McLaughlin complained that the overwheliming results of the HPC survey are not being given proper considera tiom. "The hall presidents object to the facttha tthe student poll was lightly dismissed as being less than what Fr. Burt­chaell had expected." 
"We welcome the AcadeJi1ic 
Council to match their canvass 
against the poll conducted through 
the HPC," he concluded.

from 
ANNAPOLIS, Md. (UPI) -A hearing that could result in former Vice President Spiro T. Agnew being barred from practicing law is scheduled to begin in Anne Arundel County Circuit Court Dec. 18. 
Attorneys for Agnew and the Maryland Bar Association agreed on the hearing date this week. i 
The bar association filed a petition last month seeking a disciplinary hearing for him as a result of his no contest plea to a charge of income tax evasion on Oct. 10. He resigned from office the same day. 
The bar charges that Agnew's no contest plea is proof of professional misconduct. A three-judge panel appointed by the Maryland Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, will preside over the hearings. 
The panel will recommend to the court what action if any should be taken against Agnew. The court of appeals has the final say on disciplinary action against attorneys in Maryland. 
Washington County State's Attorney Daniel Moylan, one of three lawyers representing the bar association, said he be­lieves that Agnew's attorneys will request a suspension rather than disbarment. 
But Agnew's attorney, Leon 
H. A. Pierson, refused com­ment.

sunfish and several species of minows. After completing the survey Morgan intends to select one species for a detailed analysis. 
The biologist, an authority on what communication, believes the study may eventually lead to sonic means of identifying fresh water fish species, estimating populations, and attracting or repelling fish. 
"If we can build a catalog of who 
are in a lake just by dropping an underwater microphone overboard and listening," Morgan said. "We might also be able to attract desirable fish into our nets and repel undesirable ones." 
The so-ealled "silent world" is a lot noisier than most people think, according to the fish behaviorist. "If you stick a hydrophone (un­derwater microphone) down there during certain times of the year, such as the mating season, you're really in danger of getting your ears blown off," he suggested. 
Fish generate sound in a variety of ways. The methods include rasping teeth on food, rubbing one part of t.he anatomy against another, much as a cricket chirps, lind vibrating a membrane by shifting air in the swi bladder, the hollow sac which many fish have to regulate buoyancy, Morgan ex­plained. In general, sound is employed by fish for such purposes as mate attraction, prey or predator detection, species recognition and defending territory. 
For his detailed single species analysis, Morgan is seeking a fish which generates sound both in the wild and in the lab during most of

the year. The fish als() must have value as a species harvested. by man or as food for those species. 
Amont the many things which he hopes to learn are how the fish produces its characteristic sound, what purpose the sound serves, and how important it is to the fish's total behavior. 
To determine the meaning of the various sounds, Morgan will simultaneously record the fish sounds and his description of their behavior on a two-track tape recorder. 
"If the fish are performing behavior "a" when S()Und "b" is produced and the correlation continues throughout the tape, then we cansay that sound "b" has something to do with hehavior "a". 
This correlation can he checked by playing the sound back to the fish underwater to see if it eliits the same behavior," he said. 
"It's a lot like translating B language. Once you knowwhat two or three sounds or words mean it's easier to learn what the others on either side of them mean," Morgan added.

ND swimming teammeets Waterloo in 1913 opener 
The 1973-74 season for the Notre Dame swimming team begins this weekend at home wil~h the In­vitational relays and a duel meet against the University of Waterloo. 
Returning from last year's 7-5 squad are 11 lettermen, but four valuable letter winners were lost through· graduation. Picking up the slack left by the graduated John Sherk and Gene Krathaus will be the biggest problems facing Coach Dennis Stark. Last season, the Irish equaled or broke every varsity record except two, as well as a number of Roekne Pool records. 
Although Sherk and Krathaus will be missed in the distance freestyle, butterfly and freestyle 
' sprints respectively, Coach Stark can turn to a number of veteran swimmers for leadership this season. Captain for the Irish is senior Ed Graham the team's top performer in the individual medley. Jim Kane, a junior from Owings Mills, Md., nearly qualified for the na tiona! cham pionsillips last season in the 100-yard freestyle. He has been named twice as the most valuable swimmer, and should once again provide leadershp in the freestyle sprints. Coming along very strongly in the late stages of last season to set both Notre Dame backstroke records was Bob Thompson. Thompson, a North Olmstead, 
Busy weekend 
faces wres,tlers 
Coach Fred Pechek faces a busy first week on the job,. as the new Notre Dame wrestling coach leads his team into three maltches. The Irish opened up Tuesday with a home match win, 45-9, over Chicago State, and will leave Thursday for a week-end swing in upper New York State. Thursday night the grapplers are at Oswego, and over the week-end they will compete in the Rochester In­vitational Tournament. The Irish don't return to their home mat until Sunday, December 11th when they host St. Joseph's of Indiana. 
Pechek is not quite sure what to expect from the early opponents but he is optimistic about achieving a winning record, something that eluded the Irish last year when they finislhed 6-11. Pechek is also hopeful some of his better wrestlers can claim 
regional championships and place in national competition. 
Pechek comes to Notre Dame after a successful four-year tenure at West Liberty State<W.Va.) that included a 17th place finish at the NAIA Championships last year and first or second place con­ference finishes all four years. He is a graduateof Notre Dame where he wrestled on the varsity team two years and holds graduate degrees from both Notre Dame and Purdue. 
Six lettermen return to he team including AI Rocek who needs only 14 wins (he won 22 last year) to become the all-time career leader. In two seasons Rocek has won 35 
matches  at  both  190  and  
heavyweight.  
Other  outstanding  returnees  

include Dave Boyer who won 17 matches as a freshman last year, Rich Gilloon who has posted a winning record over the last two seasons, and Joh Dowd who tied a record for most reversals in one season. A group of fin1~ freshmen could break intothestarting line-up especially in the lighter weight classes where first-year men Skip Mondragon and Dan Heffernan figure prominently. 
Ohio junior incurred knee surgery last October, recovering well enough to letter by the season's end. Joe O'Connor, ND record holder in the 440 freestyle returns in the middle distance freestyle again this season, as does Jim Fischer who last season broke the six-year standing records in the breastroke. Ed Strack in the butterfly as well as Mark Foster, Dan Makielski and Chris Payne in the diving competition will help provide the needed leadership for the many young Irish tankers. 
Six freshmen make their initial appearance for Notre Dame this weekend. Expected to make the biggest contribution right from the start are Bob Reilly in the but­terfly, the Virginia state cham­pion, and Bob Ebel in diving, a seventh place finisher in the Missouri state diving finals. 
1973-74 marks the 16th year for Stark as head coach of the Irish. Thus far he has compiled a lifetime record of 92-81-1 and among other goals for the coming season in­cludes the achievement of his lOOth career victory. 
Stark commented, "Although this is the smallest team ever at this stage depthwise, we have our goals set on a couple of different targets. We hope to send Notre Dame's first representative to the NCAA finals as well as repeat as the champion of the Motor City Invitational. As for this weekend, I hope we will be able to repeat as champion of our. Invitational Relays. We lack depth so I hope that everyone is ready." 
The Irish will be competing against the same five opponents of last year's relays. Also par­ticipating will be Bradley University, Drury College, Oakland University, Wayne State University and Valparaiso. The 1972 relays required first place finishes in each of the final two relays to enable the Irish to edge Drury 95-91, for the crown. 
Coach Stark looks at the com­petition this way, "Drury gave us the most competition last season and undoubtedly will be the most powerful opponent again this weekend. I think we're in shape as staying here over the Thanksgiving break was very beneficial. I can't really say how we'll do though since time trials don't give a good idea of what to expect. 
On Saturday, the Irish will host the University of Waterloo <Canada). Notre Dame dominated last year's away meet with W~terloo, winning handily 71-42. This Saturday's meet will begin at 2:00p.m. at the Rockne Pool with Friday's Invitational starti~g at 7:00p.m.

our opponent before the game even starts. Here at Notre Darhe we cruit many good players, so the people on our prep team are usually as od--and sometimes better--than our actual opponents. This gives our st and second stringers a chance to test plays against the different 
ngs our opponent will do--and usually if we can stop the prpes we can lp our opponents. fhe job of the prepper is a very thankless job with no glory and little )gnition from the public. There is no satisfaction at all except within ~player himself--and that comes from the thought of having prepared ! team to the best of his ability, and the knowledge, really, that the 
m couldn't do without him. 
know that most of the first and second stringers realize how hard the ~tppers work and how little they receive for their efforts. rhere is another bright side though--and that is that for most of the ~ppers it is only a matter of time until they will be playing full-time at a ·ce where thousands and thousands of boys dream of playing part-time. res, the preppers are a big part of our team. They are usually the 1rk that sets off our first and second units after a long weekend lowing a game. They're usually very high·spirited and they really Jove · game they've been playing for so long. I have a great amount of .pect for all of them because they didn't have to play football and they in't have to come to Notre Dame--but they chose to come here and they )Se to play and they took on a challenge not many other people would 
~ept. ~ooking now at Miarni, they are a very physical, tough team--a team ic1 has always g" .1 us a run for our money and whi<:h has aways ·.de us pay the price I feel, however, that this year's ND team can pay .t price and still ha-~plenty left over for a nice fat Bear Burger. ;o Irish, Beat Miani! 
couple of long punt returns and a fumble on their 10 put the game away. 
"They're dangerous," Ara concluded, "and we're well aware that we're going t.o have our hands full." 
And the Irish are going tohave thier hands full, on both sides of the line of scrimmage. 
Defensively, Notre Dame must throttle a Hurricane offense which is averaging over 300 yard~. per gaem. Junior quarterback Ed Carney (6-3, 196) leads the Miami attack, and it washe who gave the Irish defense fits in last year's game between the two teams. But this year Carney is not alone. He has a trio of bruising, bullish runningbacks behind him in Woody Thompson (6-2, 214), Johnny Williams {5-8, 185), and Tim Morgan. And in wingback Walt Sweeting (6-2, 180), and split end Steve Marcanatonio (6-4, 194) the 'Cane QB has a pair of better­than-adequate passing targets. 
It's not the Miami offense, though, which has been the main tor­mentor of Hurricane opponents throughout the '73 campaign. It's the defensive platoon which C)ach Pete Elliot has put together in his first year at the Coral Gables School. 

That defense allowed only 15 points against Texas and only 24 against Oklahoma, and is as big and as strong as any defensive team the Irish have faced this season-with the possible exception of USC's Trojans. 
The Hurricane "D" is anchored by an interior line which is second to none. Senior noseguard Tony Christiani (5-10, 215) and junior tackle Rubin Carter (6-2, 255) pose a threat to anything the Irish will attempt between the ends, and Carter, who owns 4.7 speed in the 40 is well on his way to gaining All­American recognition. 
"He's a super athlete," beamed the Miami coach, "the best defensive tackle in college football today. He just does it all. He's big, he's strong and smart, and oh, that speed. Rubin is to defensive tackle what Ted Hendricks was to defensive end when he was at Miami." 
And backing up Carter and Christiani are a trio of talented juniors: linebacker Rich Griffiths (6-2, 218), defensive back Ernie Jones (6-4, 195), and reoverback Paul Horschel (6-0, 190). 
Miami, though won't have a corner on the talent market in tomorrow night's game. The Hurricanes will have to contend with a Notre Dame team which left Air Force thoroughly impressed in the wake of last week's 48-15 victory. 
"Tom Clements (the Irish QB) is the most dangerous quarterback 

· we've played against this season," said Academcy coach Ben Martin, whose club has also seen Penn State, Colorado, and Arizona. Defensive roverback Steve Heil was just as complimentary. "They demonstrated the best play execution we've seen all year," he said. 
Falcon quarterback Rich Haynie had his own comment on Notre Dame's capabilities-particularly on defense. "Their's was the best pass rush I've had all year," he said. "I ate a lot of dirt all day." 
Tomorrow, then, at 7:30p.m. in the Ornage Bowl, Notre Dame's football team will play one of its biggest games of the year. And ND's opponent, upset-minded Miami, is out to make it one of the roughest of the year. 
But regardless of what Miami does tomorrow night, little of it will surprise the unbeaten, fourth­ranked Fighting Irish. Because Notre Dame's coach is a man who has travelled this route before. And is a man who remembers.
