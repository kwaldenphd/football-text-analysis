Football program among highest ranking 
By MARCELA BERRIOS 
Associate News Editor 

Notre Dame tops the list of Division I schools with the highest number of perfect scores in the N~s 2007 analysis of gradua­tion rates for student athletes. 
The NCAA figures, released Oct. 3, track the graduation success rate (GSR) -the percentage of student athletes that graduate from the school within six years of enrollment-at 318 Division I colleges and universities across the country. Eighteen of the University's 22 athletic programs received a GSR score of 100 per­cent. 
Notre Dame received a perfect GSR score in all of its women's sports -basketball, fencing, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field and volleyball. This is a slight improvement from last year, when soccer received a 94 percent GSR score, making it the only women's sport without a perfect mark. 

Seven men's sports (baseball, fencing, hockey, soccer, swim­ming, tennis, and track field) received perfect scores. And while the basketball, football, golf and lacrosse programs failed to receive 100 percent GSR scores, none received a grade below 90. 
They received scores of 91, 93, 91 and 97, respectively. 
The football program saw its 2007 GSR drop from 95 percent in 2006, while the golf program slipped from 92 percent last year.

Panel to address immigration debate 
Speakers include government officials, archbishop; organizers expect strong attendance 
By LINDSAY SENA 
News Writer 
The national immigration debate will come to a localized head today as the topic of the University's annual forum. 
University President Father John Jenkins selected immigra­tion as the forum's topic last spring. Classes will be eancelled today from 3 to 5 p.m. for the event. 
Ray Suarez, senior correspon­dent of The News Hour with Jim Lehrer, will moderate the Forum. The forum members are: Sen. Mel Martinez (R-Fla.), who emigrated from Cuba at 15 and is the first Cuban-American to serve in the Senate; Cardinal Roger Mahony, the Archbishop of Los Angeles appointed by Pope John Paul II in 1985 who has been an advocate for the protection of immigrants; Arizona Gov. Janet A. Napolitano; and Louis Barletta, mayor of Hazleton, Penn., where the City Council passed the Illegal Immigration Relief Act, which makes it difficult for illegal immigrants to reside in Hazleton. 
Timothy Matovina, Forum Committee chair and director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism, emphasized that it was impor­tant for the panel recruitment committee to have representa­tives from several levels of gov­ernment. 
"At the national level we have a senator, at the state level, a governor; we have a mayor for the local level, and an archbish­op to represent the religious aspect," he said. 
The panel will also represent a variety of geographic regions and political views. 
The panel will discuss and address various questions perti­nent to the immigration debate, including the economic, social, legal, religious and human rights issues. The goals of this forum, as stated by Matovina 

ND students run Chicago marathon 
Elevated temperatures, fatigue cause obstacles for some competitors

In scorching 90 degree heat and sweltering humidity, nearly 30 Notre Dame students and alumni competed in the 30th annual LaSa\le Bank Chicago Marathon Sunday. 
However, not even months of

ND supports Mahony's presence at conference 
By KAREN LANGLEY 
News Editor 
Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles, a speaker at today's Notre Dame Forum 
on  immigration, leads  an  
archdiocese  affected  in  
recent  

years by significant controver­sy. 
In July, the arch­diocese reached a $660 mil­


lion settle-Mahony ment with victims of hundreds of clergy abuse cases. In 2002, multi­ple news sources reported Mahony acknowledged know­ingly transferring a pedophile priest among parishes. 
In September, the Los Angeles Times reported that three nuns whose work includes counseling, translat­ing for and otherwise helping poor, undocumented immi­grants were sent eviction notices by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. The nuns were reportedly notified they had to leave their convent, which will be sold to help pay the multimillion-dollar court set­tlement, by Dec. 31.

New Web site benefits aspiring investors 
UpDown called 'Facebook for Wall Street' 
ByJENNMETZ 
Assistanr News Editor 
The UpDown, a growing Web site that gives members virtual money to play the stock market, is giving a community of investors the chance to earn real money for their free online portfolios. 
The Web site, which has been called the "Facebook for Wall Street," went live Sept. 4 on CNBC's "On the Money." 
Junior Patrick Martin, who uses the site, said the UpDown is a "simple way of seeing how others go about making their investment decisions." 
"The idea of a Facebook-like site for investors to pick stocks and see both what [others are picking and whyl is a novel idea that might revolutionize invest­ing," he said. 

Like Facebook, students from Harvard University founded the UpDown. Michael Reich, the chief executive officer, is a Harvard Business School student, as is chief financial officer Georg Ludviksson. Phuc Truong, the chief technical officer, is a 1998 graduate of Harvard. 
Brendan McManus, a Notre Dame junior from the Boston area, works for the Web site and contributed to its launch in September. 
"We've reached a solid critical mass.... We're still growing very fast, which is encouraging," he

The naked lunch issue sur­faced this week when Town Manager John Simko pre­sented the Black Frog's appli­cation to renew its liquor license. Simko said he had been approached about the nudity and suggested that Police Chief Scott MacMaster speak to tile owner. 
Turner did not attend the selectmen's meeting, but said he would remove the free lunch offer ifasked to do so.

Victory pro111pts celebrations 
Students rush to Stonehenge after Irish get 1st win of season 
By THERESA CIVANTOS 
News Writer 
Saturday had a different feel on campus after Notre Dame beat UCLA, winning its first game of the 2007 season and ending the longest losing streak in Notre Dame football histo­ry. 
As the game ended, hun­dreds of students poured 
outside  to  celebrate the  
victory.  
"I  sprinted  to  

Stonehenge," sophomore Caitlin Shannon said, "and the rest of campus seemed to be doing the same thing." 
Students swarmed into and around the Clarke Memorial Fountain known informally as Stonehenge -to commem­orate the win. A Facebook group entitled "I swam in Stonehenge: 10-06-07" boasts nearly 400 mem­bers. 
Once at Stonehenge, stu­dents crowded together to cheer "We are NO" and 
"Here come the Irish." Students sang the Victory March and Alma Mater. Mostly, how­ever, stu­d e n t s screamed and shouted. 
"We were letting out all this pent-up excitement that

freshman  Shannon  
Kiernan said.  

"I mean, not only did we win a game, but we beat a ranked team, which shows that we can definitely con­tend with the big guys," junior Jack Thornton said. 
After crowding into Stonehenge, students ran to the reflection pool in 
standing by 
front of Hesburgh Library to further cele­brate. 
"It was so cool because the whole community came togeth­er," fresh­man Ginny Varraveto said. "Even if you were someone you 
didn't know, cheering together really made you feel together."

"The University lets il'i commit­mmlt 1.11 academie exenllence inform il<; athletic programs too," he said, "and so you have here coaches, administrators and an academic support stall' dedicated to the sup­port <Uld the advcmcement of that mission."

Notre D<Ulle reclaimed this year thn highest pnrcentage of perfect GSH scores in the NCAA's study 
(81.8 percent of thn Univnrsity's ath­letic progrmns received 1 <Xl percent seores), a title that belonged to the 
U.S. Naval Aeademy in 2006 and to Notre Dame in 2<Xl5, when 16 ofil'> 20 athletic programs earned top marks. 
Bnfbm 2005, colleges and univer­sities relied on federal graduation rates for these studies. The NCAA develop11d the GSR two years ago "in response to college and universi­ty presidents who wanted gradua­tion data that more accurately reflect the mobility among eollege studenl<> today," the NCAA. Web site said. 
The GSR improves the federally mandated graduation rate by adju<>ting for students who may be omitted or arbitrarily included in the f(~dera.l calculation. 
"The GSR measures graduation rates at Division I institutions and includes students transferring into the institutions," the NCAA Web site said. "The GSR al<>o allows institu­tions to subtract student-athletes who leave their institutions prior to graduation as long as they would have been aeademically eligible to compete had they remained." 
The federal graduation rates peremptorily account f(>r students who transfer to other colleges or drop out to pursue professional careers as non-graduates. 
"You may have a star athlete with a 4.0 GPA who decides to leave to start playing professionally, and rather than treat this as a case of a student who voluntarily left in good aeademic standing, the federal rate sees it as the school's failure to graduate thL<> athlete," Heisler said. "That's why a school's federal grad­uation rates are usually lower than il<iGSR<>." 
Notre Dame's federal graduation rate for football players is 79 per­cent, while for men's basketball and golf the figures are 57 m1d 75 per­cent, respectively. for women, the federal graduation rate of basket­ball is 82 percent, the lowest of any women's sports.

Due to dangerous heat, the race was ol'lieially closed after four hours and all runners were urged to walk or take the available buses to the fin­ish line. Approximately 10,000 of tho 45,000 enrolled partici­pants didn't even start the race, due to the heat. One Michigan man died in the race, at least 50 people were hospitalized, and 300 runners were treatnd for serious dehy­dration. 
A final tally for the number of finishers is still being calcu­latnd. 
Nearly all of the runners from Notre Dame finished the 26.2-mile journey -but not without some hardship. 
Senior Joanna Bea experi­enced serious complications, including intense hip pain and dehydration. 

"At mile 23, I had to get an IV, wait for my heart rate to return to normal and then beg the medics to let me finish," she said. "I promised them I would walk if they would let me keep going, but then I ran anyway. I had gone that far and I just had to finish it." 
Bea was sore, she said, but satisfied that she finished.

The oppressive heat caused seniors Ben Hoesch and Anthony Dayrit, who ran together, to scale back their finish time goals. 
Between miles 12 and 14, 
Hoesch realized he was mov­
ing slower than he had 
planned. 
"There lwasl no way we were going to make it in the time we were hoping for, but quitting still wasn't an option," Roesch said. "Fortunately, the parts where I was feeling pretty bad, Anthony IDayrit] was doing better and vice versa so we were able to keep each other going." 
Hoesch and Dayrit finished in 4:20. The pair ran in the race to raise money for the Ameriean Cancer Society. 
"We each raised over $950," Dayrit said. After the race, Dayrit and Roesch went to the American Cancer Society tent to receive free massages.

Indiana reduces deer population 
WAHSAW -This northern Indiana city has hired archers to hunt deer inside city limits, an effort aimed at reducing the deer population. 
Some residents in the Spring Hill subdivi­sion say they see dozens of deer in their yards everyday. 
"Every year you see deer hit on the road. And I don't just mean one or two, I mean many," said resident John Harman. 
The city's Deer Task Force killed 18 deer last year. This year, oflicials are expanding the hunt to last three months instead of one, and hope the 24 archers kill more deer.

Iowa crucial for Democratic hopefuls 
Hillary Clinton leads in polls, but race is close with Obama, Edwards for start of primaries 
Associated Press 
NEW HAMPTON, Iowa­
llillary Hodham Clinton has 
taken the lead among 
Democratic presidential can­
didates in an Iowa poll, an 
encouraging sign of progress 
toward overcoming a big 
hurdle in the race. 
Although the New York 
senator is the clear front­

Iowa has remained an elu­

tight race with John 
Edwards and Barack Obama 
in the state that begins the 
primary campaign voting in 
three months. 
But her campaign has focused on boosting her appeal in Iowa, including two visits with her husband, for­. mer President Clinton, by her side over the summer. The effort appears to have paid off, according to the poll of likely Iowa ca~cus-goers that was published in Sunday's 
Des Moines Register. 
Clinton was supported by 
29 percent of the 399 
respondents to the poll con­
ducted Oct. 1-3, compared 
with 21 percent in May.

Bush plans children's insurance plan 
WASHINGTON -President Bush's health secretary said Sunday he does not expect Congress to override a veto on children's insurance and warned that the popular pro­gram could be at risk unless Democrats restrain spending. 
In an interview with The Associated Press, Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt said Bush would be willing to provide more than the $5 billion increase over five years that he first proposed. He declined to say how much additional money was possible. 
But in a warning to Democratic leaders who have pledged to stick with their $35 billion increase, Leavitt said Bush would not waver despite attempts to override his veto last week. 
An override requires a two-thirds majority in the House and Senate. The Senate approved the increase by a veto-proof margin, but the House fell about two dozen votes short of a two-thirds majority. The House has scheduled an override vote for Oct. 18.

Bush challenges death penalty ruling in Texas

WASIIINGTON -To put it bluntly, Tnxas wants President Bush to get out of' the way of the state's plan to execute a Mexican for the brutal killing of' two tennage girls. 
Bush, who presided over 152 nxecutions as governor of Texas, wants to halt the exe­cution of .losn Ernesto Medellin in what has become a confusing test of presiden­tial power that the Suprome Court ultimately will sort out. 
The prnsident wants to 11nforco a doeision by the International Court of Justiee that found the convictions of Medellin and 50 othnr Mexican-born prisoners vio­lated their rights to lngal courts turned him down because he had not objected at his trial.

Texas argues strenuously that neithnr the international court nor Bush, his Texas ties notwithstanding, has any say in Medellin's case. 

Ted Cruz, tlw Texas solicitor general, said, "(The adminis­tration's position( would allow the president to set aside any state law the president believes is inconvenient to int11rnational comity." 
The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case Wednesday. 

Medellin was born in Mexico but spent much of his child­hood in the United States. lie was tS in .June 1993, when he and other members of the Black and Whites gang in Ilouston encountered Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Pena on a railroad trestle as the girls were taking a shortcut home. 
Ertman, 14, and Pena, 16, were gang-raped and stran­gled. Their bodies were found four days later. 
Medellin was arrested a few rlays after tho killings. lie was told he had a right to remain silent and have a lawyer pres­ent, but the police did not tell him that he could request assistance from the Mexican consulate under the 1963 trnaty.

Two weeks after the memo, Bush said the U.S. was with­drawing from an international accord that lets the world court have the final say when citizens claim they were ille­gally denied access to their diplomats when they are jailed abroad. 
The treaty had been used by the United States in its law­suit against Iran for taking Americans hostages in 1979. 
The Supreme Court weiglwd in next, dismissing Medellin's case while state courts reviewed Bush's order. Texas courts again ruled against Medellin, saying Bush overstepped his authority by intruding into the affairs of the independent judiciary. 
In April, the Surpeme Court sl!~pped in for a second time, putting Bush and the state he governed on opposite sides and setting up an unusual alliance of interests. 
Foreign inmates on death rows in California, Florida, Texas and up to a dozen other states could be affected by the outcome. 
Four of Medellin's fellow gang members also received the death penalty and one, Sean O'Brien, was executed last year. Two others had tlwir death sentences com­rn uted to life in prison in 2005 when the Supreme Court barred executions for those who were age 17 at the time ol" their crimes. Another dnfendant does not have an execution date. 
A sixth participant, Medellin's brother, Vernancio, was 14 at the time. He was tried as a juvenile and is serv­ing 40 years in prison. 
Ertman's parents said they want to see the older Medellin brother put to death. pointing out in court papers that his ease has been going on longer than tlwir daughter lived. The case is Medellin v. Texas.

her home in Gloucester after a 
two-year battle with the disease. 
Davis, 57, became Virginia's first Republican woman elected to Congress in 2000, and she was a member of the House Armed Services Committee and the Foreign All'airs Committee. 
"Her determination to fight the disease is an inspiration to all of us," President Bush said in a statement. 
"She was a line example of a public servant who worknd hard to cut government waste to ensure the people's money was used wisely," Bush said. "Her common-sense values will be missed on Capitol Hill." 
Gov. Timothy Kaine, a Democrat, will schedule a special election, probably before the end of the year, to fill the remaining year of Davis' term, Kaine spokeswoman Delacey Skinner said. 
Her first piece of legislation, passed by the House in 2001, increased the life insurance ben­efit paid to survivors of military members killed on duty. 
Before Congress, Davis served four years in the Virginia House of Delegates. 
A conservative who came from modest means, Davis was known for her unquenchable inquisi­tiveness and how quickly and deeply she learned about any legislative issue. 
"I always admired Congresswoman Davis' strong conVictions and the tenaeity that she brought to bear in acting on them," said U.S. Sen. John W. Warner, a fellow Virginia Republican. 
Davis called in August 2006 for the resignation of Donald Rurnsfeld, defense secretary at the time, and expressed second thought'> about her support of the war in Iraq. 
"All of the int!llligence we were given says we should be over there," she told a military comp­trollers organization at the time. "If I had known that the intnlli­gence they gave us wasn't cor­rect, I don't know how I would have voted." 
She underwent chemotherapy treatments and a mastectomy when her cancer was first diag­nosed in 2005.

Tovvn burns dovvn; 15,000 flee 
Village in Darfur razed in retaliation for attack on peacekeepers 
Associated Press 

KHARTOUM -A Darfur town under the control of Sudanese troops has been razed in appar­ent retaliation for a rebel attack on a nearby base of African peacekeepers. U.N. officials who inspected the town said Sunday that about 15,000 civil­ians had fled the area. 
International aid workers and United Nations o!'ficials dis­missed claims by some rebel chief's that 100 people had died in the North Darfur town of Ilaskanita. The oflicials said the town emptied as the army moved in last Sunday, and troops ·started burning it on Wednesday. 
A U.N. statement did not say who set fire to the ethnic African town but said Sudanese government forces took control after suspected Darfur rebels attacked the nearby base of African Union peacekeepers a week ago, killing 1 0 peacekeep­ers. 
Haskanita, "which is current­ly under the control of the gov­ernment, was completely burned down, except for a few buildings," said the U.N. mis­sion to Sudan. 
A U.N. official who had just returned from I-Iaskanita said it was clear that the army or its allied militias of nomad Arabs known as the janjaweed were behind it. The Arab-dominated government and the janjaweed militias are accused of regularly burning ethnic African villages as part of their counterinsur­gency campaign against rebels. 
The oflicial said a full army battalion of 800 troops was sta­tioned at the entrance of the smoldering town, which was otherwise empty. 
"There's absolutely no doubt the army and janjaweed did it," the oflicial said on condition of anonymity because the Sudanese government regularly expels observers who speak out against abuses. 
An Associated Press reporter saw Haskanita intact last Sunday when the army moved in, though plumes of smoke could already be seen rising from several nearby villages. The town had about 7,000 peo­ple, and the other thousands fled from surrounding areas, said Orla Clinton, a spokes­woman in Sudan for the U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. 
The rebel attack on the base came amid a government offen­sive that had been raging for two weeks in the same region. Some rebels have said the attack on the AU peacekeepers may have happened because some rebel groups suspected the AU of collaboration with Sudanese forces, something the AU sharply denies. 
U.N. spokeswoman Radhia Achouri said it would be up to the African Union to investigate who was behind the town's destruction. 
"The U.N. has no mandate to investigate security incidents," she said in an e-mail to the AP. 
Sudan's government denies backing the janjaweed, who have been accused of the worst atrocities in Darfur. More than 200,000 people have died and 
2.5 million have been chased from their homes since ethnic 
African rebels took up arms 
against the central government 
in February 2003, accusing it of 
discrimination. 
The AU said was investigating 
last week's attack on its base, but could not say whether it · would expand the inquiry to the 
town's destruction. 
Gen. Martin Agwai, the com­
mander of the 7,000-member 
AU peacekeeping force in 
Darfur, vowed last week that he 
would rebuild Haskanita's base 
and resend troops there soon. 
Large quantities of ammunition 
and several vehicles were loot­
ed from the base when rebels 
raided it. 
The underfunded and ill­
equipped AU force has been 
overwhelmed in its efforts to 
quell Darfur's bloodshed. A 
joint AU-U.N. force of 26,000 
peacekeepers is due to takeover 
on Jan. 1, also to be headed by 
Agwai. 
Darfur rebel groups have 
traded accusations on who 
attacked the AU base. 
Peacekeepers told the AP last 
week that they had identified 
the assailants as belonging to a 
splinter group called SLA-Unity, 
which has been invited to the 
peace talks. 
But Sunday, Mohammed 
Osman, a local chief of SLA­
Unity, told the AP by satellite 
phone that his group had no 
role in the attack, blaming it on 
the Justice and Equality 
Movement. 
JEM leader Khalil Ibrahim 
dismissed that claim. 
"I swear on the Quran neither 
I nor any of my men took part," 
Ibrahim said, referring to 
Islam's holy book. 
TAIWAN 


Typhoon kills 4, cuts povver to thousands 
Associated Press 
TAIPEI -A typhoon lashed Taiwan Saturday with intense winds and rains, killing four people and cutting power to thousands of homes. But the storm weakened as it moved Sunday toward mainland China, where authorities ordered more than 1 million people to safer ground. 
Two people were still miss­ing in Taiwan, the Disaster Relief Center said. 
Typhoon Krosa was forecast to strike China's southern Zhejiang and northern Fujian provinces late Sunday, China's national flood control office said in a notice on its Web site. 
On Sunday morning, the typhoon was centered at sea about 80 miles northwest of Keelung on the northern tip of Taiwan. It weakened to a tropical storm with sustained winds of 66 mph, down from 114 mph, the Central Weather Bureau said. 
Two men were killed in a Taipei suburb Saturday when their house was buried by a landslide, the Disaster Relief Center said. Another man died after falling from his balcony during the storm in northern Hsinchu, and a woman was electrocuted after falling from her motorcycle in Tainan. 
Two men were missing, including one who was buried in debris after a hostel was hit by a landslide in Hsinchu. 
At its peak, Krosa caused a massive· power cut blacking out some 2 million homes in 
Taiwan. But electricity has 
since been restored. 
Cathay Pacific Airways can­
celed flights from Taipei to 
Hong Kong, Japan and South 
Korea. Dragon Airlines also 
canceled flights between 
Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
The Central Weather 
Bureau said Krosa could con­
tinue to dump heavy rains 
across Taiwan on Sunday as it 
moved toward eastern China. 
On mainland China, more 
than 1 million people from 
low-lying coastal areas, 
including more than 500,000 
tourists who were at beach 
resorts for the National Day 
holiday week, were evacuat­
ed, the Chinese government's 
Xinhua News Agency report­
ed. 
Early Sunday, China's coast 
guard rescued 27 sailors from 
a Hong Kong freighter that 
suffered mechanical failure 

after it was hit by Krosa off 
the southeastern port of 
Wenzhou in Zhejiang, Xinhua 
reported. 
In Shanghai, where the 
Special Olympics is taking 
place, the city government 
canceled vacations for flood­
control workers and was 
drafting plans to drain compe­
tition sites. 
In Vietnam, the death toll .from Typhoon Lekima ­
which hit the country's central 
coast late Wednesday -rose 
to 46, with another 29 people 
missing, oflicials said Sunday. 
Lekima, named after a local 
fruit, also damaged about 
77,000 homes, the govern­
ment said.

cent topic in Mr. Hall's 
the Jtlse 

debate class would soon be on the forefront of political debate nationwide? The University of Notre Dame has even gone as far as dedicating this entire academic year in promoting conversations on immigra­tion. 
This year's topic of conversation is highlightnd with Notre Dame's annual Academic Forum, which is being held this al'tnrnoon. With the prnsidential nleetions right around the corner, immi­gration is not only a hot topie on the campaign trail, but also it is being dis­eussnd around campus and throughout the country. The prominence of the immigration discussion was evnn men­tioned this past weekend during the ND 
v. UCLA game with a commercial high­lighting Notre Dame's interest in immi­gration. Because immigration is sueh a popular and important issue today, overyone should take advantage of the Academic Forum and immigration-cen­tnn~d events happening around campus throughout the year. 
I know that classes are cancelled this afternoon. I realize that many of us would rather go shopping, take a nap or play Zelda than sit inside the JACC for two hours listening to various speakers. llowever, these "speakers" have a lot to contribute to the ongoing conversations eoneerning immigration.

Barletta and Los Angeles Cardinal Roger 
Mahoney are this year's featured guests, 
and they all have a profound interest 
and first-hand experience with the 
issue. 
These professionals, intellectuals, reli­

gious leaders and students will be dis­
eussing various aspects of immigration. 
Issues like amnesty, wages, taxes and 
health care should all be covered during 
the Forum. And, if not covered explicitly, 
Notre Dame is offering several other 
opportunities to get involved with immi­
gration conversations. The University 
has provided a suggested reading Jist as 
a way of bneoming informed about the 
issues, as well as implieatcd an immi­
gration film series in DeBartolo 
Performing Arts Center. Also, thern arc 
online courses and resident hall 
debates. Immigration is a much more 
eomplieatcd issue than many people 
think, and I resp1~et and applaud the 
University for highlighting this signifi­
cant politkal, economkal and soda! 
issue. 
Many United States citizens, myself 

included, are very ignorant and 
unaware of the issues surrounding 
immigration. Illegal immigrants can 
have signifieant eiTects on health eare, 
public schools and the economy. Is it fair 
that illegal immigrants can come to 
Ameriea and receive health earn in our 
emergency rooms? Can it be justified 
that illegal immigrants take part in 
Ameriean public sehooling without pay­
ing taxes? These are just several of the 
economic and politieal questions that 
surround the issue of immigration, and ·questions that will hopefully be dis­
cussed today. 
Immigration also calls for a discussion 

regarding human rights. Many immi­
grants working in America are earning 
despicable wages for grueling labor. 
However, as a result, we Amerieans are reaping the benefits. Goods are cheap and serviees that were once eonsidered luxuries are now middle dass norms. Is it ethieal to allow a human being to work long hours in a sweltering hot Florida orange orchard just so eon­sumers can purehase oranges at a somewhat lower cost? Americans need to focus on what is actually important in the long run, and diseover that dignity and the worth of a human being far out­weigh the worth of several saved dol­lars. 
That is just my opinion, however. People throughout campus and through­out the country have difl'ering opinions and ean oll'er eonvineing viewpoints on the issues attaehed to immigration. The University is taking a huge Jirst step in beginning the discussion on immigra­tion, and hoppfully the rest of the coun­try will soon jump on board. Only then ean change truly begin to take plaen. 
Now I realizn that it is an impossible task to eonvince the entire student body to attend the Academic Forum today. Until recently, I myself was not own interested in going, and I understand how tempting a fpw extra rounds of Wii bowling ean be on a Monday aftnrnoon. But even if you don't quite make it to the .JACC today, at least hop on the Web site or check out a movie at the DPAC. As students, we have been given an out­standing opportunity to become involved in this extremely important issue, and, as citizens, it is our duty to take advan­tage of it.

Looking for an exciting job? 
Ever dreamt of getting away with murder, or of living in a world with no laws? Do you think that $15,000 is fair price to pay for a life lost, and do you think, in the words of one of our employees, that war is so fun that we John Everett probably shouldn't even be paying you?

be paying you; you should see how much the State Department is paying us). Have you ever wanted to see Iraq up close and personal, but felt the U.S. military's emphasis on the rule of law was too button-down and inhibiting? Than Blackwater USA might be for you. 
llere at Blackwater we believe in, and are truly committed to, the burgeoning industry of privately conducted warfare. We train our private military contrac­tors in the arts of "peacekeeping" (wink, wink) and security provision. (Note: We say "private military contractors" around here so as to avoid using the term "mercenaries" as there is a sur­prisingly negative connotation to sol­diers involved in a conflict for financial gain. Thankfully, by refusing to sign the part of the Geneva Convention that makes mercenaries illegal, the U.S. has shown it's not afraid to stand by us). 
These are great days for the private military industry. With a president com­mitted to an unpopular war, and with sagging enlistment numbers in the U.S. armed forces and a slow process of turnover to Iraqi-led security, the demand for our services has never been higher. Luckily for us, by hiring ex­Pentagon and CIA officials with the right contacts, we've been able to secure no­bid contracts to the tune of $1 billion over five years. We're not going to let any upstart mercenary companies, I mean, private military contractors, cor­ner in on our fun. 
Being as needed as we are by are a State Department and an administration unwilling to admit how thinly-stretched the regular forces (you know, the ones that have to live under congressional oversight) are has enabled us to provide our employees with benefits that I feel safe in saying are better than in any other industry. 
For instance, did you know that as an employee of Blackwater USA you will be allowed to kill people? We don't just mean your normal, everyday, warfare killing, although if that's your boat, we've got plenty of that for you, too. But no, if you want to get drunk on Christmas Eve and randomly decide to shoot the bodyguard of Iraq's vice-presi­dent, go right ahead, although you'll lose points for lack of originality, as one of our employers has beat you to that one. Yeah, you may be asked to leave 

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Rights of the sidevvalk 
I am the Rosa Parks of the Notre Dame sidewalks. 
As I was walking to class the other day, I saw a female student walking my way. A few moments later, we collided. This collision was by no means inevitable; either one of us could have moved out of the other's way. Nervously, she apologized for the accident. I didn't. I'm not sorry it hap­pened. More importantly, I'm not sorry that I didn't move to let her pass. After all, she was the one walking on the left-hand side. She was the one not paying attention. I was the one diligently watching her approach, anxiously waiting for the perfect moment to lower my shoulder. Why should I move out of her way? Because she is a woman? Nay, I will not yield my right to walk on the right. Not to any man or woman, pedestrian or cyclist. I will hold my course, barreling on toward freedom and knocking down all who stand in my way. 
So the next time you see me coming toward you as you walk down the left side of the sidewalk, stop to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do you. Notre Dame?

Speak for yourself 
I'm really tired of men speaking for women in The Observer. This eating dis­order debacle is a perfect example. By dictating to us what is right and wrong about an eating disorder, men are perpetuating the idea that women should do and be what men say. We have minds, morals, and common sense to think for ourselves. If you want to be a woman's ally, be there to support her. Don't speak for her.

the country, (bummer, I know), but you'll not be charged with any crime under U.S. or Iraqi law, thanks to the pressure we put on Paul Bremer to sign Order 17, giving our employees com­plete immunity for their actions in Iraq. And hey, that $15,000 payment to the family of the victim, which will totally make up for the premature and unnec­essary death of their husband and father, don't worry about it, it's on us. 

(I'd like to take some time here to thank all the boys down in accounting who got the State Department to lower its recommended wrongful death pay­ment from $250,000 to $15,000. Great work, guys. I've got to admit. I'd have never thought of arguing that the higher payment might induce Iraqis to pur­posefully get themselves killed by our staff. Genius). 
If holiday-coordinated violence isn't your thing, why don't you try one of our other patented civilian-killing tech­niques. Don't you hate it when someone else's car is too close to yours? With Blackwater, you don't have to stand for such insolence; go ahead and shoot the car. Heck, why stop at one? Just last month on a single security detail our employees shot and killed eleven Iraqi citizens. Sure those phony bleeding heart liberals in Congress may be trying to make a big deal out of this with their "hearings" and "pointed questions" for our beloved CEO Erik Prince, but some­how I think, with the State Department on the hook to us for about $700 million more, we'll pull through. Besides, it's not like the American public is up in arms over us. They're so disenchanted with the war that all the bad news from the front just sort of blends together, and they'd certainly rather have us over there than their sons and daughters, so in a way, we're doing them a favor. In exchange, they seemed to have agreed to pay more attention to Britney Spears' child custody hearing than to the fact that the government which they support with their taxes is currently employing soldiers who are under no legal restric­tion not to needlessly or suspiciously murder civilians. 
If you find yourself thinking about an exciting career in our field, send us a resume. And hey, don't forget to ask about our prospective expansion into Iran!

Welcome to Pilot Season. With the changing leaves and cooler temperatures of fall come a slew of television's best new offerings, leaving viewers to decide which newbies will make the cut. "Reaper," "Cavemen" and "Dirty Sexy Money" are only a few of the numerous options on the 2007-08 schedule. Some new shows are stronger, funnier and better-written than others. In light of the wide selection now gracing the networks and the Nielsen ratings, let Assistant Scene Editors Cassie Belek and Analise Lipari guide you through the best and worst of this season's pilots. 
Shows to Watch 
These are our top picks for this season's best new pilots. Some of our choices aren't surprising-"Pushing Daisies," for exam­ple, has gotten a lot of critical hype -but others are more unexpected. "Aliens in America" and "Reaper," both airing on the CW, are major ratings underdogs. Keep your schedules open for at least one of these solid new shows. Trust us -you won't regret it. 

Shows to Avoid 
Ladies and Gentlemen: We regret to inform you that not all of TV's new offer­ings are of the highest quality. To be honest, some of them just aren't worth your time. Maybe they'll improve; maybe they won't. Maybe they'll get cancelled after two episodes; maybe they won't. Regardless, we don't suggest that you invest in these new shows this fall. Don't worry-you're not missing much. 
STORIES BY CASSIE BEL 
PUSHING DAISIES (WED., ..8 P.M., ABC) 

Takings its stylistic cues from intlu­ences as diverse as Tim Burton's "Big Fish" and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's "Amalie," ABC's "Pushing Daisies" is a delightfully dark fairy-tale romp through the life of Ned (Lee Pace), a pie maker with the power to bring the dead back to life with a single touch. 
CHUCK (MON., 8 P.M., NBC)

For further proof that funny. adorable nerds are the hot commodi­ties in new television series, look no further than "Chuck." In this new light-hearted spy series, Chuck (Zachary Levi) becomes a human computer filled with government secrets after ro e CIA nt (and 
CARPOOLERS (TUE., 8:30 P.M., ABC) 
Despite the fact that much of the action takes place in a moving vehicle, "Carpoolers" feels stagnant, tired and boring. It's unfortunate to see stars like Faith Ford and Jerry O'Connell investing in this boorish, unfunny new show. The main focus of "CarpooJers" is, shocking­45-minute ride to and from work with Gracen (Fred Gross), Dougie (Tim Peper), Laird (O'Connell) and Aubrey (Jerry Minor). The show switches back and forth between the men's lives inside and outside of their car, but the story­lines and characters aren't quite com­pelling enough for audiences to care. Playing into stereotypes can, with good, smart writing, be done with irony and intelligence. But here, it's just unin­spired. Gross's Gracen, for example, feels insecure when he thinks his wife (Ford) makes more money than he dolls. He then resorts to snooping around her finances to get his faets straight. The problem with Gracen, and, really, with the rest of the characters, is that it feels likfl the writers are traveling down a well-worn and oft-trodden path of TV autopilot. Blech.

Chuek finds himself in the middle of a battle between beautiful CIA a·gent Sarah (Yvonne Strzechowski) and psPudo­psychotic NSA agent John (Adam Baldwin) as they go undereover to protect him and win him over to their respective sides. 
While the series is 1~ertain ly filled with its fair share of spy drama. it is half comedic as well.

Irish linebacker Maurice Crum leads Notre Dame to its first win of the season 
By CHRIS KHOREY Sports Editor 
LOS ANGELES -Notre Dame's ofl'ense sputtered and stalled, but the Irish defense picked up the slaek -and then some -as the Irish earned their first win of the season Saturday night, 20-6 over UCLA at the Rose Bowl. 
"I wa..<; hurting the first 
' five games, but I could get used to this feeling," fifth-year senior defensive end Trevor Laws said. 
Aftor a raucous celebration with the more than 20,000 Notre Dame fans in attendance, the Irish bounced, danced and high-lived their way back to their locker room, where senior linebacker Maurice Crum led them in singing tho "Victory March." 
"It feels really good," head coach Charlie Weis said. "It's been a long time since we've had a chance to sing that light song in tho loeker room." 
Notre Dame (1-5) gained just 140 yards on offense, but it didn't matter. The Irish forced seven turnovers, had five sacks. scored a dnl'ensive touchdown and knocked Bruin starting quarterback Ben Olson out of the game in the flrst quarter because of a knee injury. 

Late in the first quarter, Olson dropped back to pass and was lev­eled by Notre Dame ftfth-year sen­ior safety Tom Zbikowski.

LOS ANGELES-Notre Dame's offense is in shambles. The offen­sive line needs seven or eight men in protection to stop a rush, and open receivers are a rarity. The running backs haven't estab­lished proficien­cy with any con­sistency; rushes of a yard or two are a welcome change from the all-too-familiar scene of a defender stuff­ing a tailback for a loss. And Jimmy Clausen is painfully slow going through his reads, missing wide-open safety valves underneath while staring down wide outs.

Crum Jr. has a night to remember 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Wri[er 
LOS ANGELES -When Maurice Crum Jr. came to Notre Dame, his dad, a for­mer All-American linebacker at Miami, told his son the two couldn't even com­pare achievements until the younger Crum returned an interception for a touchdown. 
It might be time to revise those stan­dards. 
The senior middle linebacker had a game for the ages Saturday, leading Notre Dame to its first win of the sea­son. Crum forced four turnovers. had 80 return yards, made seven tackles, and scored the first touchdown of his career. The Walter Camp Football Foundation named him national defensive player of the week. but Crum's score was on his second forced fumble and subsequent recovery -not an interception. 
So can Crum finally argue with his dad about who played better? 
"Definitely," Crum said after the game. ''I'm most happy because I haven't had a chance to talk to my dad yet, but I want to talk to him to tell him I finally scored and he ean get off my back. "I got a message board on my door in n't want to score too soon."

Bears tight end Desmond Clark runs over Packers safety Nick Collins to score the game-winning touchdown in Chicago's 27-20 win over Green Bay Sunday. 
Turnovers hatnper Packers in loss to Bears 
Associated Press 
GREEN BAY, Wis. -The Green Bay Packers coughed up five turnovers and their chance to remain· undefeated, blowing a sec­ond-half lead and handing a 27-20 victory to the Chicago Bears at Lambeau Field Sunday night. 
Bears quarterback Btian Griese threw the go-ahead touchdown to tight end Desmond Clark with 2:05 left. Brett Favre drove the Packers to the Bears 31 and called the Packers' final timeout with 13 sec­onds remaining, but Favre threw an incomplete pass and an interception to Bears safety Brandon McGowan in the end zone to end the game. 
Favre had marched the Packers (4-1) up and down the field in the first half, shredding , a Chicago defense that continued to look nothing like the unit that led the Bears (2-3) to the Super Bowl last sea­son. 
But the old Favre reared his ugly head late in the third quarter, when he threw a head-scratching interception to Bears line­backer Brian Urlacher that let Chicago back into the game. 
Griese made the Packers pay for Favre's mistake right away, throwing a 19­yard touchdown pass to rookie tight end Greg Olsen to cut the Packers' lead to 
IN BRIEF 
Gordon wins Talladega by
employing risky strategy 
TALLADEGA, Ala. -It's not in Jeff Gordon's nature to go slow, and asking the four-time series champion to ride aimlessly around in the back of the pack is unheard of. 
But with all the unknowns sur­rounding Sunday's race at Talladega Superspeedway, it seemed to be the safest strategy. Still, he resisted, and even told car owner Rick Hendrick he wouldn't do it. 
He apparently had a change of heart, agreeing to turn parade laps for much of the race before surging past Jimmie Johnson on the final lap and holding off his teammate to become the career victory leader at restrictor-plate tracks. 
"It was the hardest race I've ever had to be in. I've never had that type of mind-set before," Gordon said. ''I've never done that before." 

20-17 with 4:19 left in the third quarter. Olsen caught the pass out of bounds, but officials ruled he had been pushed out by Packers safety Atari Bigby, a call that is not subject to replay review. 
Green Bay held Chicago on its next possession, but the Packers' Charles Woodson fumbled on a punt return to give the ball back to the Bears at the Green Bay 41. Chicago drove for a 36-yard field goal by Robbie Gould, tying the game with 14:13 remaining. 
The teams traded defen­sive stops deep into the fourth quarter, when the Bears appeared to convert a third-and-4 at the Packers 42 with 3:13 remaining. Packers coach Mike McCarthy challenged the spot and got the ball moved, just not enough to take away the first down. 
After a 7-yard run by Cedric Benson, the Bears faced third-and-2 at the Packers 34, Griese faked a handoff and threw down the seam to Clark, who had broken free from safety Nick Collins and linebacker Brady Poppinga. Clark ran to the end zone, giving the Bears a 27-20 lead. 
Griese, playing his sec­ond game as the Bears' starter after Rex Grossman was benched, finished the game 15-of-25 for 214 yards with two touchdowns and one interception. 
Former Duke coach and 
player reunite on field 
PROVIDENCE, R.L -They're on dif­ferent teams now, but Mike Pressler and Reade Seligmann still greeted each other with a hug before the game and a friendly handshake afterward. 
They found time for some friendly banter, too. 
Seligmann, one of the three former Duke lacrosse players falsely accused of rape, recently transferred to Brown. Pressler, who built Duke into a top national program before being forced to resign as coach more than a year ago, is in his second season leading the Bryant team. 
They reunited Sunday as Brown and Bryant, a Division II program in near­by Smithfield, faced each other in a scrimmage. Seligmann is playing col­lege lacrosse for the first time since the spring of 2006, when Duke's sea­son was cut short by rape allegations that prosecutors later determined were false. 
Pettersen defeats Ochoa in 
playoff 

DANVILLE, Calif. -Suzann Pettersen made her way to the 18th green for the third time in 45 minutes, telling herself she had better fmish off Lorena Ochoa before it got too dark and they had to come back for more Monday. 
Then, with another spot-on playoff putt as the sun was going down in the distance, Pettersen put her name above top-ranked Ochoa's at long last. She made an 8-footer for birdie on the second sudden-death hole Sunday to win the Longs Drugs Challenge. 
"I don't know if we could have played much longer," PettBrsen, said. "I probably hit my best putt, the last putt I had in the playoff. That was really nice." 
Pettersen, who began the day with a bogey, watched as Ochoa just missed a 20-foot putt before calmly making the winner and pumping her list several times.

bit of concern through the crowd," he said. "It's just it's impossible to run." 
Ivuti, competing in only his second major marathon, was timed in 2 hours, 11 minutes, 11 seconds in the closest fin­ish in the race's history. He was the fifth straight Kenyan to win the race. 
"I had never seen a marathon finish up close that was like that," head referee Pat Savage said. "This was really close, but at the same time you could see that one man was ahead ofthe other." 
Adere finished in 2:33:49 after passing a surprised Adriana Pirtea, who had a comfortable 30-second lead after 24.8 miles. 
lvuti and Gharib surged ahead of defending champion Robert Cheruiyot and Daniel Njenga at the 22-mile mark to make it a two-man race. Gharib led for much of the final 4 miles before Ivuti made a push on the final mile. 
"One thing I had in my mind was that everybody is going to face the same heat," Ivuti said. "I had no problem with that because everybody was going through the same thing as me." 
The duo traded leads on the stretch run down Columbus Avenue before Ivuti's final push at the line. The race was so close that it took organizers several minutes to determine the winner. 
Njenga finished third and Cheruiyot fourth. Cheruiyot was in position to contend but stomach craps forced him to drop back after 22 miles. Cheruiyot, who last year slipped on the finish line and banged his head on the pave­ment as he raised his hands to celebrate, finished in 2:16:13. 
Pirtea waved to the crowd as she listlessly approached the finish line. But a final push on the last mile by Adere caught the Romanian in the final stretch. 
"At 40 (kilometers), I could see she was going slowly," Adere said. "l knew if I started working from that point on, there was a possibility to catch her."

CIIICAGO -In a race run in scorching heat that left one man dead, Kenya's Patrick lvuti won the Chicago Marathon by a fraction of a second Sunday. At least 49 runners were taken to hospi­tals and another 250 were ti·eated at the site. 
The 88-degree heat and sweltering humidity were so draining that organizers shut down the second half of' the course four hours after the start.

Chad Schieber of Midland, Mich., 35, collapsed while running on the South Side and was pronounced dead shortly before 1 p.m. at a Veteran's Affairs hospital, the Cook County medical examiner's office. An autopsy was sched­uled for Monday. 
"Obviously very sad news. and our thoughts and prayers are with the individual's fami­ly," said Shawn Platt, senior vice president of title sponsor LaSalle Bank. 
George Chiampas, the race's medical director, said witness­es reported seeing Schieber collapse and become unre­sponsive. "It sounds like he lost his pulse very fast and died on the race course," Chiampas said. 
There was another running death Sunday in Arlington, Va. An unidentified runner from Virginia died during the Army Ten-Miler, collapsing near the finish at the Pentagon. The race started in 70-degree heat and high humidity. 
These were record tempera­tures for the Chicago Marathon, topping the mark of 84 degrees in 1979. Runners were diverted to the starting area, where they were provid­ed with medical attention and cooling misters. Shortages of water and energy drinks were reported along the 26.2-mile route. 
Race director Carey Pinkowski said organizers were concerned that emer­gency medical personnel wouldn't be able to keep up with heat-related injuries. 
"We were seeing_ a high rate of people that were strug­gling," Pinkowski said. "If you were out there at 1 o'clock, it was a hot sun. It was like a summer day. It was just a bru­tally hot day." 
At first, organizers hoped those who passed the halfway mark could complete the run. But eventually even those recreational runners were told to turn back. 
Still, some runners perse­vered, although organizers said they didn't know how many completed the course. Helicopters hovered over the race course while police offi­cers shouted through a bull­horn and warned runners to slow down and walk. 

About 10,000 of the 45,000 registered runners chose to not race in the heat despite more mist stations, cooling buses and water-soaked sponges, while another 10,934 started but didn't finish, offi­cials said. 
Lori Kaufman, a runner from St. Louis, said she was told to start walking at mile 
14. She said the fire depart­ment turned on hydrants to hose people down along the course.

Senior Katie O'Brien posted llw best score of the weekend for Saint Mary's. She finished with an 85 on Friday and an 83 on Saturday for a total of 168 strokes, good enough for third place in the tournament. 
O'Brien's strong showing in the Championships cemented her position as a season nwdalist in the MIAA confer­ence, with a final scoring aver­age of' 80.25. She narrowly edged !lope College's Julie lloogerhyde for the honor, who finished with an 80.5 average.

Stastny's five points put Aves over Sharks 
Associated Press 
DENVER -Paul Stastny put together an impressive rookie season, and now he is working on an even better sophomore campaign. 
Stastny had a goal and four assists, and Milan llejduk scored twice and set up another tally as the Colorado Avalanehe broke open a tight game with four third-period goals and beat the San Jose Sharks 6-2 Sunday night. 
Avalanche captain .Jon Sakic had a goal and an assist to move past Phil Esposito into eighth place on the NHL career points list with 1,591. 
Stastny, the runner-up to Pittsburgh's Evgeni Malkin for rookie of the year honors last season, has four goals and four assists in Colorado's first three games. lie had a hat trick in the Avalanche's season-opening win against Dallas on Wednesday. 
"I don't think th1-1y're com­ing easy. I've gotten a couple of good bounces," said Stastny, who had 28 goals and 50 assists last season. ''I'm playing with some good linemates." 
Hejduk scored late in the first period, Jess than three minutes after Sakic notched the 611th goal of his 19-year career. Sakic's goal moved him out of a tie for 14th place with Bobby !lull on the career list. 
"Obviously, I've been around a long time," Sakic said. "For me to have played this long and get to those guys who mmtnt a lot to the game, it's an honor." 
The Avalanche poured it on in the third after Hyan (:Jowe scored the first of his two goals to make it 2-1 after two periods. Just 52 seconds into the final frame, llejduk found Stastny in front to give Colorado a two-goal cushion. 
"I thought last year he was at a pretty impressive level, and to just keep getting bet­ter is a great sign," Avalanche coach Joel Quennevilln said. "With the puck, his patience level is at the highest end of thn game." 
llejduk scored 1:55 later, and the rout was on. Marek Svatos and Hyan Smyth scored 18 seconds apart mid­way through the third to make it 6-1 and chase goalie Evgeni Nabokov. 
"We were pushing the paee in the second, and we were aggressive and going down and they didn't hj.lve much," Nabokov said. "The third period starts, and we give up a 3-on-2, and that made the momentum for th1~m."

Parbhu loses in consolation round 
Senior co-captain drops match in straight sets, 6-3, 6-3, to No. 38-ranked player in nation 
By KATELYN GRABAREK Sports Writer 
Senior co-captain Sheeva Parbhu lost in the consolation round of the Polo Halph Lauren All-American Championships Sunday in Tulsa, Okla. 
Parbhu, ranked No. 30 in the country, lost to No. 38 Clancy Shields from Boise State in two straight matches 6-3, 6-3. 
Parbhu's singles record dropped to 2-4 this year and 96-30 all time. He needed one more win to pass Hyan Simme for ninth place on the all-time Irish singles win list. Simme graduated from Notre Dame in 1997. 
''I'm looking to play at a high level and keep the good streak going," Parbhu said. 
Parbhu fell in the opening round of the tournament 
Thursday to No 22 Bojan Szumanski of Texas Tech 6-3, 6-0. 
"Brett (Helgeson), and Parbhu are co-number one's," head coach Bobby Bayliss said. "I don't want to peg either one as the number one. Parbhu comes to net bettor, but does­n't have the power Brett does." 
Parbhu did not play any matches last weekend in order to rest up for the tournament. He was the only representative Notre Dame sent to the tourna­ment. He wanted to stay fresh for dual meet matches later in the season. 
Parbhu will return to South Bend this weekend and prac­tice with the team. The Irish will travel to the ITA Midwest Championships in Minneapolis, Minn. on Oct. 18.

Fischer's hat trick topsSMC 
Belles score with 25 min. remaining 
By MEAGHAN VESELIK Sports Writer 
Hope senior forward Julia Fischer picked up a hat trick to lead her Flying Dutch past Saint Mary's 3-1 in an MIAA conference game Saturday. 
Fischer netted two goals in less than five minutes in the middle of the first half, then another one in the 53rd minute to give the Dutch a 3-0 lead, which the Belles couldn't overcome. The first and third goals mirrored each other; both came on set corner kick plays assisted by freshman Lauren Miller. 
Fischer capitalized off of a Belles' turnover directly in front of their own net for the second goal and was unassisted on the play. 
Saint Mary's freshman Julia Gragtmans was able to get her team on the scoreboard with 25 minutes remaining in the game, but it was too little, too late. Sophomore Samantha Goudreau picked up the assist by crossing the ball from snven yards out to an empty Gragtmans, who buried the shot. 
Senior goalkeeper Amy Mahoney made five saves in attempt to keep the Belles in the game, but could not get in the way of Fischer's three shots on the day. 
Leading Belles scorer Lauren Hinton, who has been recovering from an injury for the past few weeks, again made an appearance Saturda~ She got off three shots, but couldn't find the back of the net. 
The Belles were unable to get a shot on net in the first barf. and picked up only eight in the second frame for one of their lowest totals of the season. Gragtmans had four of the team's eight shots. 
Hope outshot the Irish 10-0 in the first half and picked up four more in the second. 
The Belles have been idle the past week and seemed rusty against the Flying Dutch. 
The team was not able to . come back after a slow first half and respond to Hope's sizable lead, giving Saint Mary's its first conference loss. 
Saint Mary's dropped to seventh place at 1-1-2 in the MIAA and 5-2-4 overall. Hope is over .500 for the first time this season with an overall record of 7-6. The Flying Dutch are 3-1 so far in conference play. 
The Belles continue with conference play Tuesday when they take on Adrian athonw.

Pac-10 turned upside down by losses 
Associated Press 
LOS ANC;EI,ES -Whnn this goofy c:olloge football season bngan, the game or thn ymtr on tho West Coast was supposnd to be Sou thnrn Cali l'orn ia at Calil'ornia on Nov. 10. 
That's still a big one. But the game that might dncide the l'ac­1 0 is ... Cal at Arizona State. 
Cirdo the date: Oct. 27. 

Tho soeond-ranked Golden Boars (5-0, 2-0 l'ac:-10) and 14th-rankml Sun Devils (h-0, 3­0 l'al~-1 0) aro thn eonferonee's only remaining unbeatens aflnr Stanford's stunning 24-23 victo­ry over USC, which fnll from No. 2 to No. 10. 
Cal plays Oregon State and at UCLA bel'or·p it gots to tho Sun l>ovils. who faeP Washington at home and have a bye week. 
Cai-ASU for thP Pac-1 0 title? It became a possibility af'tnr a strango Saturday night in Los Angnles. 
The Golden Bears had taken tho wonk oil'. and thn Sun I>Pvils had survived at Washington State when the Cougars missed a last-second field goal. 
Then Stanford beat USC, and the result from the Los Angeles Coliseum sent shock waves across town and across the country. 
At the Hose Bowl in nearby l'asadpna, the crowd at the Notre Damn-UCLA game began to roar as word of the l'inal seore spread. The Trojans might be the bittemst rival of both the Fighting Irish and thn Bruins, and tlwir loss united fans of both teams. 
"ListPning to the crowd, I knnw there was at least one upset." Fighting Irish coach Charlie Weis said. 
A l'nw minutes later, Charlie Weis .Jr.. approached his father on the sideline and told him the score, which soon llashnd on the vidooboard, prompting another long dwer. 
"ll didn't hurt my feelings," WPis said. 
Tlw Bruins fans wenm't cele­brating for long. UCLA's 20-6 loss to the Fighting Irish, who had dropped seven straight games, was made no more bearable by the Trojans' defeat. 
The Bruins lost to a team led by freshman quarterback Jimmy Clausen, making his fifth start. 
USC, meanwhile, lost to a tnam led by sophomore quarter­back Tavita Pritchard, who had played only a handful of snaps. 
It's not as if John Elway had magically reappeared for the Cardinal, or Joe Montana for the Irish. 
UCLA (4-2, 3-0 Pac-10) entered this season with dreams of challenging for a national title. But the Bruins, who have mustered a total of four field goals in losses to Utah and Notre· Dame, are beginning to look like a quintessential Pae-10 softie. 
In fairness, UCLA lost starting quarterback Ben Olson to sprained kneo ligaments in the first quarter, and coach Karl Dorrell turned to walk-on McLeod Bethel-Thompson, a redshirt freshman who had not thrown a pass in college. Bethel­Thompson committed five turnovers in the second half. 

As bad as UCLA looked on Saturday night-and seven turnovers is mighty bad -the Bruins still control their own Hose Bowl destiny. They're tied with Arizona State for the con­ference lead. If the Bruins win out, they'll celebrate New Year's Day on their horne field. 
"We're in pretty good shape in conference," Dorrell said. "We have to evaluate where we arn." 
That won't padfy Bruins fans, who were seething as the Irish and thousands of their faithful celebrated Notre Dame's f'irst trip to the Hose Bowl since Jan. 1, 1925. As the clock ran out, chants of "Fire Dorrell" went up in the grandstand below the press box. 
That's right: fans of the Pac-1<) co-leader were calling for their eoach 's dismissal.

Start with their records: Arizona won ·the NL West with a league-best 90-72. The Hockies, who had to defeat San Diego in a one-game playoff to earn a wild card berth, fmished 90-73.

The playoffs have been sweet for two teams that have strug­gled in recent years. 
Colorado, which lost 94 games in 2004 and 95 in 2005, posted its first winning record since 2000. The Diamondbacks went 51-111 three years ago, and this year they broke a streak of three consecutive los­ing seasons, longest in the fran­chise's 10 years.

Jaguars stop Chiefs' ground game in victory 
Keith's two touchdowns lead Colts over Buccaneers; Tomlinson has 140 total yards in win over Brooncos 
Associated Press 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -For 59 minutes and 59 seconds, Jacksonville dealt Kansas City a humiliating shutout. 
As the final second ticked off the clock, the shutout vanished, but the humiliation is going to stick around a while. 
Controlling the line of scrim­mage and stopping everybody wearing a Kansas City uniform except tight end Tony Gonzalez, the Jaguars held the Chiefs to a shocking 10 yards rushing Sunday en route to a dominat­ing 17-7 victory that had Arrowhead Stadium rocking with boos. 
Two-time Pro Bowler Larry Johnson had only 12 yards on nine carries, 126 fewer than he rolled up on this same field last Dec. 31 in Kansas City's 35-30 victory over these same Jaguars. The 10 yards rushing were the second fewest in the history of a franchise whose roots go back to the inaugural season of the AFL in 1960. 
"You can't ask for anything more," said cornerback Rashean Mathis. "Our key com­ing in was to stop (Johnson) because he's a great back. We knew if we stopped him, they'd have a long day." 
Maurice Jones-Drew sped 52 yards for one touchdown and David Garrard hit Dennis Northcutt for 40 yards to set up another as the Jaguars (3 -1) won their third in a row and dropped the Chiefs to 2-3. 
Only Brodie Croyle's 13-yard pass to Samie Parker on the final play enabled the Chiefs to avoid their first shutout at home since 1994. Until then, the closest they came to scoring was Dave Rayner's missed 32­yard field goal attempt. 
''I'm so glad we didn't get shut out. So glad," said Gonzalez, who had eight catch­es for 100 yards. 
The meaningless touchdown didn't give left guard Brian Waters much solace. 
"That didn't take any light off the terrible performance we had," Waters said. 
The Chiefs had 271 yards total offense, with 70 coming in the last-minute drive that Croyle led because starting quarterback Damon Huard had gone out late in the fourth quarter with a bruised shoul­der. 
"We were out there talking to (Johnson) and having a little fun," said Jacksonville line­backer Clint Ingram. 
"For a guy of his caliber, his style of play and the way he plays, a big physical running back, one of the best running backs in the league, to hold him to (12) yards, that's a good job as a defense. We take pride in something like that." 
David Garrard was 20-of-27 for 218 yards and one touch­down, and has not been inter­cepted since Ty Law picked him off last Dec. 31 and caused coach Jack Del Rio to bench him. Just after his 40-yard gain, Northcutt wiggled into the end zone with a 3-yard scoring pass. 
The Chiefs, who have had poor field position all year, began their first three second­half possessions on their 3, 20 and 8. In the first half, they started only one drive beyond their 23. 
It was the Jags who sustained things. In an 18-play, 77-yard march in the first quarter that netted only John Carney's 20­yard field goal, the Jaguars tied a team record for number of plays on a scoring drive. At 10 minutes, 55 seconds, it was the second-longest scoring drive in team history. Donnie Edwards stopped Jones-Drew on third­and-goal from the 3. 
In the second quarter, Jones­Drew, held to no gain his two previous runs, burst through a big hole and quickly hit full stride. Twice he turned safety Jarrad Page with quick stutter steps and then outran 33-year­old cornerback Ty Law to the end zone for the Jags' longest run of the year. 
"He did a little Barry Sanders move there and spun the guy around," said Garrard. "When you have stuff like that, it takes so much pressure off your quarterback and so much off your offensive line when guys can make big plays like that. Everybody is doing a good job right now." 
Colts 33, Buccaneers 14 
No Marvin Harrison and no Joseph Addai proved no prob­lem for the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday. 
Playing without five injured starters, including two key players in their high-scoring offense, the Colts dominated the clock and their improving defense never gave Tampa Bay a chance in a blowout. 
Super Bowl MVP Peyton Manning made it look easy by throwing two touchdowns, while first-time starter Kenton Keith rushed for 121 yards and two more scores. 
"I have been proud of our team on many, many occasions, but this is one of the best," Colts coach Tony Dungy said after beating his former team. "I thought the backup guys did­n't try to do too much. Everybody just did their job." 
Conventional wisdom sug­gested that without Harrison, the eight-time Pro Bowl receiv­er, and Addai, the Colts' feature back, the offense might be sus­ceptible against Tampa Bay's usually strong defense. 
It was no contest. 
Manning finished 27 -of-39 for 253 yards and simply used other players to replace the missing parts. Pro Bowl receiv­er Reggie Wayne, tight end Dallas Clark and first-round draft pick Anthony Gonzalez each caught seven passes. Gonzalez entered the game with only six catches all season. 
The magnitude of the rout wasn't even reflected by the score. 
Indianapolis held the ball for an astounding 38:15, including all but 90 seconds in the third quarter when the Bucs ran three plays. Tampa Bay (3-2) finished with 17 yards rushing after losing Carnell "Cadillac" Williams for the season last week and then losing backup Michael Pittman in the second quarter Sunday with a sprained right ankle. It was the lowest rushing total allowed by a Colts team since 1971. 
After three quarters Tampa Bay had 7 4 yards of offense ­56 coming on its only meaning­ful scoring drive in the second quarter -and was outgained by the Colts 400-177. 
The 40 offensive plays run by Tampa was the third-fewest ever allowed by a Colts team. The New York Jets had 34 in November 2003 and San Francisco had 39 in September 1963. 


"You do the math there," Bucs coach Jon Gruden said. "You're not able to do a lot when you don't have the ball." 
The bad news for the rest of the NFL is the Colts now have two weeks for most of their injuries to heal. 
It's the third straight year Indianapolis has gone into the bye week with an unbeaten record, and the Colts believe Addai (shoulder), Harrison (knee), linebacker Freddy Keiaho (concussion) and safety Bob Sanders (ribs) will all be healthy when they start their toughest stretch of the season at Jacksonville in two weeks. 
Linebacker Rob Morris, the other starter missing Sunday's game, will miss the. rest of the season with a torn tendon in his knee. 
Chargers 41, Broncos 3 
The San Diego Chargers fig­ured the formula for turning their season around included holding onto the ball and get­ting a tide-turning takeaway on special teams. 
They did all that and much more in handing the Denver Broncos their worst home loss since 1966 with a drubbing fueled by reigning MVP LaDainian Tomlinson and his trusty backup, Michael Turner. 
L. T. amassed 140 yards, including 73 on three recep­tions-, and Turner added 147 yards on 10 carries, highlighted by a 74-yard touchdown trot along the Broncos' bewildered sideline in the fourth quarter. 
Quarterback Philip Rivers even got into the act with the first rushing touchdown of his career. His 2-yard run on a naked bootleg was followed 11 seconds later by San Diego's second score. 
Brian Clark, re-signed last week after the Broncos gave up on kick returner Domenik Hixon, failed to follow his blockers and fumbled on a hard hit by Carlos Polk follow­ing Rivers' TD. Brandon Siler snared the ball in the air and sprinted to the end zone, punching it past the left pylon for a quick 14-0 lead. 
"It was big," Tomlinson said. "It definitely gained some confi­dence and momentum for us·. Something we definitely need­ed. We had talked about it last night, possibly hoping to get a turnover on special teams. But we did better than that; we got a touchdown. 
"So that got us off on a good start. I think they never recov­ered." 
Chargers coach Norv Turner, heavily criticized during his 1-3 start with basically the same team that went 14-2 under Marty Schottenheimer last sea­son, said Tomlinson's 36-yard gain on a screen pass after two rushes netted minus-2 yards on the Chargers' first drive loos­ened up his tight team, as did Rivers' TD run. 
"Then, the big hit on the kick­off return, we score bang-bang. You can feel our guys' confi­dence come back," Turner said. "We have more work to do, but we made progress.. " 
And the Broncos (2-3), losers of three straight, slipped fur­ther into a funk that threatens to spoil their season. The fans braved the cold and windy weather at Invesco Field, but could not deal with Denver's dismal defense, emptying out before the fourth quarter had begun. 
One week after committing four turnovers, the Chargers (2-3) had none in ending their three-game skid by winning consecutive games in Denver for the first time since 1967-68. 
They handed the Broncos their worst home loss since the Kansas City Chiefs' 56-10 thumping on Oct. 23, 1966. 
"I don't know if I've ever been more embarrassed," Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. "I don't think our players have ever been more embar­rassed to put on that type of show." 
Philip Rivers, who had nine turnovers coming in, played keepaway, throwing for 270 yards and two touchdowns on 13-of-18 passing for a nearly perfect quarterback rating of 151.4. 
The Chargers amassed 484 yards of offense and limited Denver to one field goal on 11 drives. 
"Whatever the Chargers did, it worked. Whatever we did, didn't," Dre' Bly said. ''I've never been a part of something like this where everything we did went against us, and not for us. They ran the ball, threw the ball, played defense, they played special teams. They won all four phases. We didn't win any."

Shutout 
continued from page 28 
Ten minutes later, senior defender Ryan Miller scored the game's lone goal by head­ing in a Joseph Lapira corner kick. Lapira, who also foreed the corner kick, had great services all night on Notre Dame's eight corner kick opportunities. 
The connection was Miller's fourth goal and Lapira's fourth assist of the season -both team highs. Miller had two goals in a 3-0 win over Michigan earlier in the week. 
"He was one of our strongest players last year and to this date and time, he has main­tained that," Clark said. "But, I think it was really a team per­formance on Saturday." 
Clark was pleased with the developing chemistry between middle defenders freshman Matt Armstrong and junior Michael Thomas, who was playing in only his second game of the year due to a bro­ken jaw. 
The defense held West Virginia to 12 shots and only one corner kiek, while allowing the Notre Dame attackers to put up 23 shots of their own. 
The stingy Mountaineers defense had allowed slightly more than 11 shots per garno 
to its opponents prior to Saturday night. All six of West Virginia's wins have come in 1­0 shutouts and it has only allowed four goals through its first 10 games this year. 
"They defend very well," Clark said. "They have five players who rarely ever leavo their defensive duti!~s." 
All five West Virginia defend­ers are returning starters from last season and all. except for sophomore Alex Erwin, are seniors. 
The Mountaineers goalkeep­er, redshirt freshman Zach Johnson, has also been out­standing for West Virginia so far this year. 
"Their keeper had several excellent saves, at least four or five of them," Clark said. 
Lapira had two great chances taken away by Johnson, and Armstrong was also robbed on a nice shot from well outside of the box. But one goal was enough for the Irish. 
With the win, Notre Dame (8­1-2, 5-0-1 Big East) stayed atop the Big East Blue Division, and it is now the only unde­feated team in the conference. 
The Irish will take a break from eonfereneo play this week when they take on regional rival Michigan Stato W(~dnesday in East Lansing.

Three Notre Dame golfers aro at even-par in a tie for 23rd place. The most surpris­ing of the group is freshman Tyler Hoek, who is starting in his first collegiate tournament. Iloek, a powerful driver off the tee, followed up a four-over par first round with an impres­sive 68. 
"Tyler is a very talented young player," Kubinski said. "lie has great imagination for a player his age. He will be a great contributor for us." 
Joining Hock at even-par are snnior Greg Rodgers and junior Josh Sandman, who both had impressive starts to the event. Rodgers shot a two-under 70 and Sandman a one-under 71 in the first round, but each tal­lied a few bogeys in the second round to return to even par. 
Senior Eddie Peckels had the toughest day of the Irish play­ers, shooting rounds of 77 and 
79. Peckels is tied for 80th at 12-over. 
The Irish will start the third and final round today in Durham with tee times begin­ning at 8:30 a.m.
