Leader's slides highlight professors' night 
by Ann Gales Senior Staff Reporter 
A lecture and slide presentation on the treasures of King Tut's tomb given by Robert Leader, professor of art, highlighted the First Annual Farley Professors' Night held last evening in Farley Hall. 
Debbie Bieber, academic com­missioner of Farley Hall and organ­izer of Professors' Night, explained that the event was intended to "get the professors into the hall and give them a chance to talk with students outside of the classroom.'' 

"Hall fellows and other profes­sors were specially invited, but all were welcome," she explained. Approximately 25 professors, many of whom brought their families, attended the open house and lecture. 
Leader addressed an audience of approximately 100 students and professors, emphasizing in his presentation the importance of the discovery of Tut's !tomb. "The great significance of the tomb," Leader pointed out, "is that it is the only tomb that has ever been found with the burial chamber still sealed." 
The tomb, which was excvated in the 1920's by Howard Carter and Lord Carnavon of England, is located on the west bmnk of the Nile

Commission offers to hang your posters 
by Bill Delauey 
The Student Union Services Commission will post advertise­ments and posters for campus clubs and organizations at the rate of 10 cents per poster, according to the commissions new distribution guidelines. The service, which is offered for both Notre Dame and St. Mary's will continue to be free for organizations within Student Government. 
"Basically, we offer the service for Student Government organiza­tions," said Gary Luchini, Service Commission advertising director. "This doesn't include clubs and organizations that receive Student Union funds but are not part of Student Government. They have to pay for the service," he added. 
The new guidelines specify that anyone who wishes to take advan-
Madrigal Dinners feature comic opera 
The St. Mary's Music Depart­ment will present its annual Madri­gal Dinners in the North Lounge of Regina Hall the evenings of December 2 through December 5. Tickets may be obtained by calling Mary Gerber. director of special events and programming at 4-5787. 
Recreating a Renaissance atmos­phere, the evening will feature entertainment be wandering min­strels, medieval dancers, and Instrumentalists followed by a fes­tive dinner, which will include wassail and other medieval dishes. 
The Madrigal Singers will per­form in a short concert after the dinner, followed by the St. Mary's Opera Workshop. which will pre­sent a short comic opera. 

tage of the service must sign up on the calender outside the Commis­sion's office on the second floor of LaFortune Student Center. They must also notify Luchini by tele­phone at 8774 or leave a note in his mailbox in the Services Commssion office. 
This should be done 48 hours 
before the posters are delivered for 
distribution. Weekends do not 
count as part of the 48 hour period. 
The posters will usually be posted within 24 hours after the Service Commission receives them. 
"Posters are only taken over to St. Mary's on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, "Luchini said. 
The Services Commission is a branch of Student Government, Luchini explained. "Its function is just what its name implies," he said, "to provide services for students, such as summer storage, refrigerator rental, the freshman register, a plant sale, a record sale later in the semester, plus this poster service." 
"no one could get in through that 
door, unless someone from the 
inside let them in." 

Lenz has posted a sign urging 
residents to lock their doors and to 
be more careful. "We should be 
more cautious of strangers in the 
hall and not hesitate to question 
them to fmd out if they really 
belong here," the rectress com­
mented. 

Kathy McElroy, tho~ fourth floor 
RA in Farley, said, "The main 
thing is that everyone should lock 
their doors at night. It's a pretty 
easy precaution to take." 
"The problem is that there is a false sense of security in living in the dorm," McElroy noted, "and we really have to urge the people to lock their doors." 
"In my three other years here. I've never locked my door at night," Lopez stated, ·"but you can be sure I will after this." 
Karen Yaeger, another Farley resident, said, "I ente1red the dorm around 3 a.m. and noticed a guy outside. I remeber thinking how strange it was because' he was just standing there. gazing into the bushes.'' 
Yaeger said that the man. a Caucasian with wavy. dark hair. "was wearin navy sweat pants with white stripes down the sides on either leg." 
"He also had on a short dark jacket that didn't go with the outtit at all,'' she added. ··He just didn't look like he belonged at Notre Dame."

in the "Valley of the Kings." It 
was built some 3500 years ago for 
Tutankhamun, a minor 18th Dyn­
asty king who was only 18 or 19 
years old at the time of his death. 
Approximately 5000 items were found in the tomb, according to Leader. Each item was carefully catalogued and diagrammed by Carer and Carnavon. About one­third of the items are included in the "Traveling show" which has attracted this past year "literally millions of Americans who have stood in line hour after hour to see the collection." 
Leader stated that the intrinsic value of the gold items found in the tomb was estimated at $25 million 15 years ago. 
"We have an old saying that you can't take it with you," Leader commented. "The Egyptians. however, did take it with them. I don't know how far they got with it. but they at least took off with it. .. 
According to Leader, the fact that Tutankhamun was onlv a minor king is important to reallhe. "If they built tombs like that for a boy king who was a nobody. can you imagine what a burial must have been like for a real king?" he aksed the audience. 
Leader discounted the widely 

publicized "curse of the pharoahs, 
"saying that the argument for such 
a phenomena is "rather flimsy at 
best." 

''The press claimed that every­body who was present at the· opening of the tomb died shortly afterwards," Leader stated. "This is true, but the press failed to point out the circumstances under which they died." Most of the people present at the tomb died in their: 70's or 80's, Leader said. "One gentleman was shot by his wife' when she found him in bed with' another woman. Whether or not' that has anything to do with the curse of the pharoahs, I don't know." 
· Leader also remarked that one could easily be misled into thinking that the Egyptians were a morbid people. because of all the pyramids and tombs that are associated with Ancient Egypt. In actuality. how­ever, the Egyptians were "Not always thinking about the under­taker." Only funerary things haw remained of their civilization. Leader explained. because the~ were the only things made of permanent materials. "The Egypt· ians were in fact a happy people. a~ evidtnced by the tact that they mad good beer."

That's why so many of today's newly-married couples stress quali-lre~tle<:ticon

Now, the question remains: does "name brand" have any effect on the quality of your engagement diamond? (Note: They're also pro­moted in those same publications.)

Notre Dame Chaplain Fr. Robert Griflin labeled the S percent rate of alcoholism as "probably conserva­tive." Griffin went on to say that alcoholism was a problem of the individual and that those most susceptible were the lonely. 
I Jnmarried people are open to akoholism because of the absence of the family unit according to Griffin. In any individual, he stated. "unused energy" leads to stress. thus increasing the chance of alcoholism for priest~. 
r,·ggy Cronin, an alcohol and drug counselor for Psychological Services, also felt that the statiistic was probably too low. Cronin added that alcoholism among the Notre Dame community was not an open subject and that it was difficult to get information on it.

Notre Dame shoots Falco111s 
byTooyhce Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame football team closed out their home schedule on Saturday by whitewashing the Air Force Academy, 49-0. The Irish completely dominated play as the Falcons never mounted a serious scoring threat. 
After the game, Notre Dame received and accepted a bid to play in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas on January 2, 1978. Their opponent will be the winner of next Satur­day's game between Texas and Texas A&M. 
Any prospect for a close contest with Air Force van~shed early in the 
,. 

 
ND icers drop two decisions 
quarter points. 
The Irish were driving toward another score early in the second period when a Montana pass, intended for Ken MacAfee, was intercepted in the end zone by cornerback Kelly Miller. Air Force then drove into Notre Dame terri­tory for the first time in the game, aided by a 28 yard run on a fake punt by Schafer. However, a third down sack of Falcon quarterback Dave Ziebart by defensive tackle Case forced the Air Force to punt. 
Later in the second stanze, Ferguson racked up his third tally of the day on a two yard plunge. This score culminated a five play, 64 yard drive which featured a 27 

game. After the Falcons punted, Notre Dame had the ball on their own 44 yard line. On the first play from scrimmage, tailback Vagas Ferguson veered off right tackle and raced 56 yards for a touch­down. Split end Kris Haines threw a block at the Air Force five yard line which allowed Ferguson to score. Dave Reeve added the point after touchdown and the Irish quickly led, 7-0. 
Less than four minutes later. Ferguson had his second score of the day. Following the lead block of guard Ernie Hughes, the sopho­more speedster scooted nine yards to reach paydirt. This run capped a 59 yard, seven play drive which was highlighted by a 23 yard pass from Joe Montana to Ferguson. With Reeve's point the score was 14-0. 
Minutes later, Notre Dame's Jay Case forced Scott Schafer to rush his punt and the kick traveled only 13 yards. This gave Notre Dame the ball on the Air Force 39 yard line. Using Ferguson and fullback Jerome Heavens exclusively, Mon­tana then directed the Irish to their 
'third score of the afternoon. This time it was Heavens : ho.odid the honors, hulling over the goal line from one yard out. Ferguson went over the 100 yard rushing mark on this drive. Reeve's conversion was the last of Notre Dame's first

Denver -The Mile High City has \ never been an easy place for the \ Notre Dame hockey team to win. And the task becomes increasingly I difficult when the Denver Pioneers 1 are the top-ranked team in the country. As a result, the Irish winless streak continued as they were swept this past weekend by 
Denver by scores of 8-4 and 8-2. 
Very simply, Notre Dame didn't have the depth to skate with the Pioneers for six periods. Injuries to yard scamper by Terry Eurick. Reeve's fourth placement boosted the Irish margin to 28 points. 
Free safety Joe Restic gave Notre Dame another chance to score late in the first half when he intercepted a Ziebart pass. Mon­tana then moved the club from the Irish 31 to the Air Force 33, where he tossed a scoring strike to Haines. "It was just a simple up and out pattern and Joe put the ball 

 on the Money," Haines explained after the game. Reeve's extra point gave the Irish a 35-0 halftime lead. -Head Coach Dan Devine merci­fully removed the starting offensive backfield from the game after the first half. Ferguson left the game with 128 yards on ll carries, his best game for the Irish. Heavens had accumulated 48 yards in nine rushes and one touchdown. Mon­tana had 11 completions in 15 passing attempts for 172 yards and one touchdown. Early n the third quarter, with Rusty Lisch at the Irish helm, Notre Dame again drove deep into Air Force territory. However, a fourth down pass from Lisch to Dave Waymer fell incomplete. When the Irish got the ball back, they scored their first points of the second half. Steve Schmitz's 24 yard punt return set the ball on the Falcon 26. From there it took six plays, the best being a 16 yard gallop by freshman Jim Stone, to score. This time it was Eurick who scored from two yards out. Reeve booted his sixth placement of the day and the score ballooned to 42-0. The final Notre Dame score of the afternoon came on the first Irish possession of the fourth period. With running backs Stone and Pete Pallas doing most of the work, Lisch directed the team to the Air. Force 11 yard line. There he passed to Schmitz for the only fourth period score. Reeve's seventh extra point of the day. which gave him the Notre Dame career record for extra points with 124, made the final count 49-0. The final statistics for the game indicated the total domination of the Air Force. The Irish had 32 first downs while the Falcons were held to five, all of which came in the first half. Notre Dame had 680 total yards for an average of over seven yards per offensive play. Converse­ly, Air Force had only 102 total yards on 51 offensive plays for an average gain of exactly two yards -[Continued on page 7]

Irish out-fire Russians 
by Paul Stevenson Sports Editor 
The Fighting Irish basketball 
team opened up their 197.7-78 ' campaign with a convincing 101-80 thrashing of the Soviet National Team. 
Dave Batton put the first Notre 
Dame points on the board with only 
25 seconds elapsed in the season. 
The Russians fought back less than 
a minute later when Aleksandr 
Belostenny connected on a reb0und 
goal for the USSR. 
Then, for the next ten minutes, 
the game was a seesaw battle, with 
each squad either exchanging 
points or turnovers. Finally, with 
8:34 left before intermission, Bill Laimbeer hauled in a rebound and then scored to give the Irish a 23-21 advantage, a lead Notre Dame would never relinquish. 
Tracy Jackson then hit from the left comer and Gilbert Salinas tallied on two free throws to give the II ish a six point edge. Notre Dame then added five more points to build a 34-21 lead with only 4:58 remaining in the half. 
The Russians revolted with a few noints of their own, but the Irish :ontinued to out-score their physi­c·al opponents. With only one ;ccond left before halftime, Batton (pund the range on a 17 foot jumper from the top of the key to give 114otre Dame a commanding 52-34 
nargin at intermission. 
The second half was a constant 
exchange of p0ints, with the Irish 
maintaining their 20 point margin. 
With 7:40 remaining in the battle, . 
Duck Williams came up with a 
steal, then dunked the ball to give 
the Irish a 89-63 lead. Rich· 
Branning connected on a ten foot 
'· t from the right baseline, giving 
the Notre Dame cagers a 28 point 
advantage. But, that was as wide 
as the Irish lead was· to be as the 
.i:':ussians came back to narrow the 
ilnal margin to 21 markers. 
Tht. story of the game was one of an unhelievably balanced attack by the Irish and one of turnovers for the USSR. Batton led the Notre Dame cagers with 18 points, while Williams followed with 14 markers. _Branning, Laimbeer and Bruce 
Flowers each added 12 points. 
In addition, the Irish had 11 players who logged playing time in double figures. Notre Dame also ' Yes, keeping the players fresh 
and rotating the defenses helped 
the Irish overcome the Russians. 
The USSR gave up 35 turnovers, 
while Notre Dame suffered only 11. 
By alternating defenses, Notre 
Dame was able to tire and frustrate 
the large Russian team. Vladimir 
Tkachenko, who tallied 41 points 
and grabbed 15 rebounds the night 
before against Indiana, was only 
able to score 15 markers and 
register five caroms. 
Leading the Soviet attack was 

Vladimir Derguin, who connected · 
on eight of 11 field goal attempts 
and six of seven free throws for 22 
points. Tkachenko was the only 
other Russian player who reached 
double figures. 
Laimbeer led the Notre Dame 
cagers with eight rebounds, while 
freshman Orlando Woolridge be­
came an instant crowd-pleaser with 
his spectacular blocked shots and -six caroms. 
"I think the Notre Dame team is 
very powerful." Russian Coach 
Aleksandr Gomelsky stated via his 
translator. "They have good 
technique, shooting, rebounding 
and physical strength ... 
The USSR coach agreed that his team may have been tired from all of their traveling and the difficulty caused by playing under collegiate regulations. But, he was quick to stress the strength of the Irish cagers. 
"I think we lost to a very powerful, strong and classy team," Gomelsky remarked. "Notre Dame does not only have good players, they have a good overall team." 
Notre Dame has led the nation in 
rebounding margin over their op­
ponents the past two seasons. 
However, the Irish were out­
rebounded by their competitors, 
41-38. But, Notre Dame Head 
Coach Digger Phelps witnessed 
several positive aspects in Friday 
night's contest. 
"We're very happy with the balance we had," the Irish mentor commented. "We just really pressured them, and that made them look bad. We're just happy to have our depth. We have 12 or 13 guys and that's going to be our team." 
The Irish's next clash will be this Saturday against the University of Mississippi at home. The Russians
