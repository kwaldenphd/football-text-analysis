Some of the more resiliant banners still swing in defiance on the quads, but many more have fallen, vic­tims of rectors and and a protest movement that switched from passion to reason. 
Exams begin in five days, and August seems a whole summer away. But when we return, the alcohol policy will be here to greet us, 99 percent ofit intact, just as we saw it on April I 7 when the party really ended. 
So what have the protests done? Infuriated some, for sure. We made a few chuckle -such as Dean of Stu­dentsJames Roemer-who wondered ifwe had better things to do. 
By the way, have you ever noticed that many of the people who claim that we are such an intelligent stu­dent body are the first ones to disown us when the tide turns? Last spring, Dean Roemer said he was impressed when hundreds offriends ofa senior rushed to his aid at a meeting in the Morrissey chapel. The student was appealing his dismissal for an incident at a bar in Ft. Lauderdale. 
After a one hour discussion, Roemer changed his mind, and he lauded the students' concern. The semi­staged event ended wirh Roemer holding an alternate proposal in the air, looking like a model of justice, and announcing the student would stay. 

Now, just one year later, Roemer plays up to the na­tional media, saying how embarrassed he is for ·us. Not a single administrator had the nerve to admit that the stu­dents had a legitimate gripe, but simply were going about protesting the wrong way. 
Yet, the sad fact is that most administrators know that the students have a point, but they were so caught up in maintaining their "immorality of drunkenness" shroud that to recognize the students would be to suggest com­promise. 
The morality line is getting a little hard to stomach now. Ifdrunkenness is so immoral, why not emphasize a crackdown in other areas, too, including Morris Inn,

Corby Hall, Green Field and the Monogram Room. Let's hold our breath waiting for the first parent or alumnus censured for drunkenness on campus. I suppose the ul­timate punishment would be to expell the violator from the Alumni Association. The real issue is University liability here, and don't believe otherwise. 
Some positive signs from the protest, however, are appearing with the haste with which the University is proceeding with plans for an enlarged and upgraded student center. Word from under the Dome suggests that Father Hesburgh has given a carte blanche to the project, and preliminary sketches are already being composed by a local architect. 
Such plans are long overdue for the place that few students call their center. The additions sound interest· ing -a bowling alley, shops, an undergraduate club ­but the center will not be any social panacea It lacks and will always lack the one thing that students need: a party room. 
For che underlying issue in this whole embroglio is the idea of the party. Not a single "alternative" that has been mentioned so far will be able to replace it. The peculiar combination of music, dancing, plenty of people, and yes -alcohol, ha~ been the standard social highlight for years. And in a great majority of cases, it has been a tradition that has allowed people to meet others and enjoy themselves while not necessarily get­ting drunk, as the Alcohol Committee mistakenly con­tends. 
Underclassmen will carry on the tradition -on or off campus -not necessarily to he rebellious, but because parties are truly good, not inherently evil. 
What the University seems to be attempting is to change students' attitudes toward socializing, not just their attitudes toward alcohol. Good luck. It will be years before that attitude will change, if it ever does, and the transition years will be quite tough on those underclassmen. 
The Alcohol Committee did recommend that a com­mittee look into the whole social life question and come up with a plan. To date: no committee, no plan. Would someone like to come and clean up the mess that the alcohol policy has left? Father Beauchamp, Father Tyson ...you both have a little free time now, don't you?

St. Mary's Director of Campus Ministry Reid to relocat~ to Seattle 
By MARY PADDEN 
News Staff 
Tom Reid, Saint.Mary's director of 
Campus Ministry for four years will 
be leaving in June for Seattle where 
his wife has accepted a clinical inter­
nship. 
During the past four years the department saw substantial growth in staff and student involvement. In addition, Reid said a "team orienta­tion" developed within the depart­ment. 
Reid's wife, Molly, currently working on her Ph.D. in psychology at Notre Dame, has been accepted into a clinical internship at the Uni­versity ofWashington in Seattle. 
Reid decided to make the move as this year marks a four-year cycle at Saint Mary's. The area of relocation was advantageous as two of Reid's brothers are Washington residents. "We knew the move would come eventually, but we weren't expect­ing it to be so soon," Reid said. 
Reid praised the quality of Saint Mary's programs, and the acces­sbility of both faculty and ad­ministration. 
His time at Saint Mary's enabled him to gain new insight. "Working at a women's college has helped me to grow in a number of ways. Being a man in a predominantly female at­mosphere helped me to become more sensitive to the needs ' of women." 
Reid is pleased with the direction that Campus Ministry at Saint Mary's is taking. He said increased involve­ment in programs such as the Fast for a World Harvest, Three Minutes to Midnight, and other peace­oriented functions of this spring

show that Campus Ministry has 
become a vital part of the Saint 
Mary's community. 
After leaving. Reid plans to con­tinue hisworkwith Retreats Interna­tional by offering spiritual growth programs and consulting with people in retreat ministry. He hopes to expand his work to include those ofall ages. 
Family and premarital counseling are two areas in which Reid would enjoy beinginvolved. He believes by extending his ministry to these areas, he would be able to help people relate better to family needs. 
His relationship with Campus Minstry as a specialization has come to a close, but he feels his work in human and spiritual development has only begun. 
Both Reid and Sister Karol Jack­owski, dean ofstudent affairs at Saint Mary's, have a great deal of con­fidence in his replacement. 
Mary Feely has been named to the position, and will assume duties as director August 1. 
Feely is currently director of Lay Formation, and associate professor of Pastoral Theology at the St. Francis Seminary in Milwaukee. She has had previous involvement in the South Bend area as director of religious education at Holy Cross parish and through teaching theol­ogy at Notre Dame during the spring '>emester of 1982.

By the end of 1983, however, Domino's, Inc., reported sales of al· most $370 million, or approximate­ly $450,000 per store, and currently is planning to construct a 30-story corporate headquarters, using a design by architect Frank Lloyd Wright that was never built, in Ann Arbor. 
And Monaghan sees no saturation point in sight. Pizza Hut, Domino's top competition, has 4,000 stores nationwide "and they're doing fine," he said. "We can· build our stores closer to each other than they can." 
Monaghan said Domino's doesn't concentrate on building franchises near college campuses. "We started out that way," he said, "but we used to lose a lot ofmoney in the summer. Military bases are a different story, though. They're like campuses all year long."

Some anti-abortion groups dis· agree with the Justice Department's interpretation of the PDA. James Bopp, Jr., general counsel to the the National Right·to·Life Committee, stated in a letter to the NRLC's Legislative Director Douglas Johnson, "I have concluded that the Justice Department has taken an ex· tremely narrow interpretation ofthe abortion exception in the PDA not warranted by the plain lang1.1age of the statute .... The PDA does not require the payment of travel or per diem expenses to Peace Corps employees seeking abortions."

Loret Ruppe's stand on abortion policy 
The following is an excerpt from Loret Ruppe's testimony before the House of Representatives Foreign Affidrs Commit­tee on Feb. 8, 1984. Ruppe is director of the Peace Corps and will speak at the Notre Dame commencementceremonies onMay20. 
Loret Ruppe 
Guest column 
I appreciate the opportunity to clarify some of the irresponsible and inaccurate charges which have appeared in the press regarding the Peace Corps' policy on pregnancy. 
First ofall, I want to make it absolutely clear that, as an individual, I have been and con­tinue to be, an active opponent ofabortion on demand. I believe my record in the pro-life movement speaks for itself. 
However, my current position as the Direc­tor ofthe Peace Corps requires me to take an oath1to uphold the law. Therefore, I am not free l:o implement policy based on my per­sonal beliefs without regard to legal require­menfs. 
Consequently, since my appointment, I have directed my efforts toward achieving the administration's pro-life policies, but have been limited in my ability to do so by the re­quirements oflegislation and the decisions of the Supreme Court. 
When I became the Director of the Peace 
Corps, I found that I had inherited a policy under which, I was pleased to learn, the Peace Corps did not pay for abortion procedures. However, it did pay for the transportation and per diem to volunteers who wanted to return to the ·United States to have the procedure 
performed. 

Some counseling was provided, but no ef­fort was made to emphasize trainingfor medi­cal staff and volunteers which might help prevent unwanted pregnancy, or to insure that all volunteers were well informed of available alternatives to abortion. 
Finally, there was no established limit to the 
number of abortions a volunteer could have 
and still remain in service. 

Needless to say, I found this situation less than satisfactory from both a personal and ad­ministrative point of view. However, I realized very early on that any changes in the policy would have to conform to a complex of legislative and judicial mandates which have grown up in this area ofthe law. 
Therefore, in early 1981 I directed my General Counsel to provide me with a sum­mary ofthe legal bases for the existing policy, an examination of how Federal agencies which provide health care can handle the problem, and an analysis of the legal options open to me to change the policy so that it more closely related to the administration's goal and objectives. 
This analysis was not encouraging in that it 
indicated that current authorities appeared to 
require a continuation of the Peace Corps 
policy of paying for travel and per diem for 
volunteers seeking abortions. 

In an effort to satisfy myself that we 'Yere indeed required to continue this policy, I directed the General Counsel obtain an opinion from the Justice Department, as to whether our continuing payment of travel costs, violated the Congressional ban on pay­ment ofappropriated funds for abortions, and whether, ifit did not violate the ban, we were at liberty to discontinue the practice, or in­stitute other restrictions in this situation. 
I directed that this request for an opinion clearly indicate that my objective in askingfor guidance was to quote from the letter, "the well-known position of this administration regarding abortion, with which we want to comply." 
The response received, did not, in the view of my legal advisers, leave room for doubt. The payment of transportation costs did·not violate the Congressional ban. Further, failure to provide the transportation costs incident to the abortion procedure would constitute a violation of Pregnancy Discrimination Act 
(P.L. 95-555) unless the Peace Corps discon­tinued the praotice ·of medevacing other Volunteers suffering from other medical con­ditions requiring their return to the United States for treatment. 
Since we have full responsibility for any medical condition developed by volunteers while overseas, many of which require evacuation, I believe I had no choice under the law but to pay similar expenses for preg­nant volunteers returning the U.S. 
I was then faced with determining in what other ways I could modify the policy to reach my goal ofsubstantially reducing -hopefully eliminating -the incidence of unwanted preegnancies among the Peace G:lrps volun­teerpopulation. My answer, which I commun­icated to the field in a memorandum to all Country Directors and volunteers in family planning and sexual responsibility, and re­quested an upgrading of the counseling skills ofour medical staffin this area 
Second, I had the counseling of pregnant volunteers both in-country and in the United States redesigned to emphasize alternatives to abortions and the prevention of future preg­nancies. My medical staff is also interviewing these individuals to try and learn if there are correctible deficiencies in our present system which result in unwanted pregnancies. 
Finally, I determined that any volunteer requesting a second abortion during her tour of service with the Peace Corps was acting with such a degree of irresponsibility that automatic separation from the Peace Corps was warranted. 
I hope that I have now made my position 
clear. I am neither trying to promote abor­
tions among Peace Corps volunteers nor 
attempting to subvert the administration's 
pro-life position. The record shows, I have 
made every effort to reorient Peace Corps 
policy toward what I believe is a responsible 
and legal goal -the prevention of unwanted 
pregnancy. 
I am trying to do so under the legal con­straints, as outlined by the Department of Justice, in manner which does not infringe on the rights of individual volunteers or endan­ger their health and safety.

Let's play taps for ROTC at Catholic colleges

potential officers in its armed forces be exposed to a liberal education. 
The benefits of this sort of wisdom are less than obvious (we now know that guards at Auschwitz listened to Mozart and had read the works ofGoethe), but all societal at­tempts to check the horror of war, even clumsy ones like ROTC and the proposed Peace Academy, deserve a measure of ap­plause. 
Nevertheless, ROTC is not an institution which fits easily into the mission of Catholic education and is certainly not an institution which should be uncritically accepted on a Catholic campus. 
The mission ofCatholic education, accord­ing to Pope john Paul II, a former professor at the Catholic univc::rsity in Lublin, is to con­struct "a community whose sincere commit­ment to scientific research goes together with a deep commitment to authentic Christian living." Catholics can't glide easily past those adjectives "sincere," "deep" and "authentic." 
Asincere commitment to research requires (at the very least) an honest look at Catholic tradition and teaching; a deep commitment to authentic Christian living, it could be argued, requires an unnervingly absolute pacifism. 
It requires, in any case, a wholehearted at­tempt to imitate the life of <heist, who managed to impress all four of the Gospel writers with his failure -even refusal -to allow the use of a sword against his ex­ecutioners. Those scriptural passages Oohn 18:11, Luke 22:49, Mark 14:47-50, Matthew 
26:51) are harsh and complex. Good men and women disagree on th~ teaching they contain. 
But the thing that recurs in Catholic teach­ing on the use of violence is simple: The church abhors bloodshed. 
Catholics can't glide easily past that teach­ing either. (Of course the church abhors bloodshed, they might say, but blood will al­ways be shed, and as long as there are nations, they'll need armies. 
Catholics seldom ask themselves if, per­haps, the church's abhorrence of bloodshed next to the customary bloodiness of nations does not present them with a radical and un­comfortable choice.) 
The church abhors bloodshed, and that ab­horrence is the basis oftheJust War doctrine, the vague but astonishingly restrictive set of criteria into which awar must "fit" before it can escape condemnation by the church. 
The presumption ofthejust War doctrine is against war, and traditional Catholic teaching places the burden of proof not on the person who refuses to take up arms, but on the person who wants to take up arms. It is not easy to understand how ROTC became accepted in institutions commissioned to advance tradi­tional Catholic teaching. 
The fact the ROTC bas been accepted by such institutions does not change that teach­ing and does not change the responsibilities of Catholic higher education. This is not to say that a Christian cannot be a soldier, not to say that pacifism is a prerequisite for salvation. 
It is, nevertheless, at least inconsistent and arguably dishonest for a Catholic university or college to claim that it abhors bloodshed while it includes war preparation in the cur­riculum. Ifa Catholic school were that sloppy in its presentation of church teaching on sex ... well, you can imagine. 
ROTC, for many Catholic university stu­dents, is the only affordable access to an education. That is a shame, in the fullest sense of the word. It would be much more consis­tent with Catholic tradition for a Gttholic col­lege to set up special scholarships specifically designed to offer such students an alternative to military entanglements. 
This would make Catholic higher education more costly and perhaps more controversial, and that would make greater sacrifices neces­sary, but sacrifice is what the church is all about, and the church's first task is not to preserve the society by enhancing its armies but to transform the society by presenting it, even challenging it, with the person of Our Lord, who seems at least chary about the use ofweapons ifnot absolutely opposed. 
I said heseems to be chary. A glance around the contempory church indicates that some of our co-religionists are clearer on this issue than were the evangelists and the first Chris­tians. In El Salvador, for instance, Bishop jose Eduardo Alvarez ofSan Miguel enjoys the rank ofcolonel in an army which has received little acclaim for its defense ofthe innocent. 
In Nicaragua, priests in a military govern­ment defertd the infliction of violence on recalcitrant · Miskito Int:ians as regrettably necessary for the advanc,~ment of the San­dinist revolution. 
· Elsewhere in Latin America, a resurrected just War doctrine is employed by proponents of guerilla wars of national liberation. In this country the debate between pacifists and militarists extends even to the conference of bishops. It is not easy to understand how all of these peop_le can be right. 
But a Ca'tholic college or university which 
accepts an ROTC program at least implies that 
the case is closed, that the mission of the church and the training of armies (our armies . . . Britain's and Argentina's, for in­stance; both include large numbers of Cat­holics) cannot be contradictory. 
A community "with a deep commitment to authentic Christian living" is a community called to imitate Christ and should reflect a little more of Christ's ambivalance towards the use ofswords. Secularcolleges and univer­sities have no such responsibility. Let ROTC flourish in them as long as the taxpayers per-" mit. 
But Catholic and Christian institutions serve sterner constituencies, and among those looms large the figure of One who has already conquered the world without those legions of angels his Father would, if asked, deploy (Matthew 26:5 3 ). 
It is easy to understand how people who happen to be soldiers may serve Christ. Their lives are recorded in Catholic tradition. (Interestingly, most of them witnessed by laying down their arms.) What is less easy to understand is how a Catholic university or college serves Christ by including in its course ofstudy the science ofbloodletting. 
I have wondered lately if the Catholic Ar­gentines and the Catholic Britons who killed each other in the South Atlantic were products of ROTC program equivalents. To their respective armies, their religion means little if anything. Of the universities and col­leges which might have graduated them the same could be said.

I 
get nervous with authority 
figures, a sign that I had a very 
strict father. He died when I was a 
collegefreshman, at a time when we 
weren't talking much, because we 
disagreed on religion. In becoming a 
Catholic, I hurt him badly. He was a 
good father who deserved more 
from me than defiance. Joining the 
Holy Cross order, I found I had 
futhers in Christ. Religious authority 
often comes, like a deputy deity, in a 
father's shape. The great blessing of 
my ordained life waslearning to love 
my futhers more than I feared them. 
Now that I am old enough myself, I 
feel embarrassed to be treated as a 
futher figure, though I am pleased 
when students treat me with affec­
tion and respect. 
Nature has no law prohibiting 
children from being smarter than 
their elders. My father gave me an 
example to follow: though he would 
have died to make me happy, he 
wouldn't consent to my making a 
mistake. It's tough to love a child, if 
love means you have to stick by your 
guns as a way of protecting a fool 
from his folly. It turned out all right,. 
because I was lucky. My dad 
wouldn't have been so opposed, if 
he hadn't thought I was hurting 
myself. Who could begrudge him a 
love so paternal? A man pays a price 
in suffering for being so paternal. 
Love clings like the ivy to the walls ofthis place. Caring becomes part ofone's lifestyle. On this campus, over which the Dome spreads like an umbrella, you are judged, ifyou work here, by the quality of your commitment to the students. Some seniors, graduating in anger, never forgive Notre Dame. Others, years later, arc still thinking it over. I hear daily conversations full ofpassionate caring. Yet, ad­ministrators are denounced as though they were different from other Christians capable oflove. 
Notre Dame has come through a rough winter. Everyone Is tired, and it's time for the school year to end, before our tempers and anger flare any higher. Something wonderful happens on this campus: young people living here go through a remarkable period ofgrowth and 
development. Wherever they were when they came as freshmen -in late childhood or adolescence or burgeoning adulthood -by the time they leave they are grownups, free as birds to begin their ad­ventures in the real world. In becoming proteges ofthe real world, they are giving up as much as they are getting, ifthey only knew it. Yet it would be a sin to clip young wings, to keep birds grounded. Here would be an offensive needing for­givcnness. 
In the argument ofpaternalism versus freedom, I'm a traditionalist in favor ofgiving inexperienced virtue the support ofauthority. Per­sons like me, who make a career of parenting, have an instinct for cau­tion that makes them protective, brought on by watching young people careless with the gifts oflife. In the division oflabor between the young and the old, senior persons make the rules, and junior persons, doing their own thing, ignore the rules they don't like. Everyone does what is expected ofhim in this im­perfect universe. Neither the rule makers nor the rule breakers have God entirely on their side. There is no such place as the infallible side of an argument. 
This is a confrontational age. There have been a thousand dress rehearsals for the spring festivals that begin with shouts from a dorm window at midnight, followed by a thousand lads rushing the quads, shouting for blood; and ending at high noon, with speeches lecturing Father Hesburgh on the steps ofthe Administration Building. It would feel like I'm talking down to you to suggest that you have a good time, and be careful ofyourself and the property, because things get broken, and students bleed. Nothing attracts attention more than a crowd making the same kinds ofnoises. I offer no criticism ofcrowd behavior when exacerbated students bring their grievance publicly to the seat of power. 
In every relationship, the par­ticipants deserve a cooling off period, a time for thinking things over. Congress takes a break, and the lawmakers go home to talk with the voters. Generals retire from·tne 
army, and write their memoirs, 
wiser offthe battlefield than they 
were in any war. The Lord God Him­
self, fmishing creation, felt entitled 
to a holiday. Maybe, like a coach on 
Monday morning reviewing the 
situation, He revised the game plan. 
If, in the time spent by yourself this 
summer, considering the semester, 
you overlook the caring for you that 
goeson here at Notre Dame, you are 
still very youngto be exposed to the 
indifference ofthe real world, which 
never makes a commitment to love 
anybody. Some miracle oflove has 
happened at Notre Dame, piling 
stone upon stone, making the place 
possible. The bloodofsaints and sin­
ners who gave their lives in service 
are in these bricks. The love, sweat, 
and tears ofworking people, whose 
names are known mostly to God, 
have redeemed the green acre of 
this Emerald City. 
In totalitarian systems, Big 
Brother watches dissenters with 
hate. In empires and fiefdoms, 
where there are masters and slaves, 
the name ofthe game is power. You 
can tell that you're in the real world 
when you see dog eating dog. Pater­
nalism is the fault ofa gentler king of 
establishment subject to the insights 
ofgrace. Paternalism has become a 
dirty word on this campus. I say, 
three cheers for paternalism! 
I hope the real world is good to 
you. It never did me any harm, but 
St. Paul in the Epistles never speaks 
well ofit. Ifit hurts you, you can al­
ways get together with a thousand · others as injured as yourself, run 
through the strets shouting slogans, 
hang sheets covered with protests 
out your windows, and hold a public 
rally telling offits leaders. Perhaps 
you will be patient with the real 
world, forgiving its fuults, though 
you realize it offers you no hiding 
places. 
An older generation gets part ofits 
identity from trying to help you 
realize your potential for greatness. 
However limited you think their vi­
sion is, keep in mind that they wish 
you well. Have a happy summer. 
Darby O'Gill II and I never said we 
didn't love you. After the middle of

Energy of 'Godspell' gives old story new life 
by Mary Feider 
features stqfl writer 
I 
went to "Godspell" expecting to see a 1960'srendition ofa modem musical. What I saw was a contem­porary experience. The familiar musical became spontaneous and refreshing under the direction of Betsy Quinn. 
As part ofan ensemble often characters, innocent and unassum­ing Bill Boraczek Oesus Christ) coaxed to the stage the Gospel according to St. Matthew through musical parables and improvisation­al vignettes. Throughout most ofthe show the energy generated by the ensemble was reflected in the audience response. 
Incorporated on the stage was a five-piece band whose music kept the atmosphere upbeat and the production Bowing. Under the choreography ofBetsy Quinn and Ann Mariejanero the ensemble was strong and exciting in their dance. 
Though the music throughout the show was captivating and alive, the ensemble's energy level during the first few numbers was not as high as in the rest ofthe performance. The initial Jackofenc:rxywas quicklyfor­FUm by rhe reapliYe aldknce. 
:nwlbow...,..cnrcnaJIYc·¥ilually,
'· .. 
The construction ofa colorful and movable set added spacial variety and enhanced the musical move­
ment on a sometimes overbearing 
O'Laughlin stage. Brightly colored wooden blocks, cut like pieces ofa puzzle, were moved about with ease by the ensemble costumed In egual­
ly vibrant colors, although a clearer 
distinction between each in­dividual's costuming would have created more variety among a cast with much dimension. 
Maintaining an upbeat through­out the show, the ensemble kept the audience response changing as the mood swung from dramatic to humorous. The contemporary inter­pretation ofthe Gospel stories showed insight and creativity. The actors used present day language and humor to tell astory written two thousand years ago. Although this could be awkward, it was received 
focmance. The color and energy on the stagecreatesa visual excitement seldom seen in O'Laughlin. Godspell Is definitely an experience well worth witnessing. 
Godspell is showingat O'Laughlin Hall May 4,5, 17 and 18 at 8 p.m. Tickets are SI and are sold at the door only.

.,I Irish lacrosse team meets MSU still having· shot at MLA crown 
By MIKE SULLIVAN 
Sports Editor 
When Notre Dame lacrosse coach Rich O'Leary traveled to East Lan· sing. Mich., on Wednesday to scout a game between Michigan State and Ohio Wesleyan, he expected to get a good picture of the Spartans ­Notre Dame's opponent tomorrow -as they were being dominated by conference leader Ohio Wesleyan. 
O'Leary did get a good look at Michigan State, but he also received a pleasant surprise when the Spar­tans pulled off a big upset, beating Wesleyan, 7-6, and putting Notre Dame in an excellent position to emerge as Midwest Lacrosse As­sociation champion. 
The Michigan State win left Notre Dame, Denison, and Ohio Wesleyan with identical 7-1 marks in the con­krence. A Notre Dame victory over the Spartans would clinch the Irish a tie for first place. In the case of a tie, the decision about who is champion would be left to a three-man com­mittee. 
Assuming Notre Dame continues its winning ways tomorrow, the· decision could well rest on the outcome of tomorrow's Dt.-nison­Ohio Wesleyan game. The Irish lost to Wesleyan, 12-5, early in the sea'iOn, but defeated Denison, 12-11, last week. A Denison win tomorrow would knock Wesleyan out of the picture, helping Notre Dame's <·hances immensely. 
"I would guess that, if Denison 

beats Wesleyan, Wesleyan would be 
out of the picture because they'll 
have two losses," explains O'Leary. 
"After all, almost every champion­
ship in the country is decided on the 
win-loss record. 
"I also think that if it was a two­way tie and it came down to head-to­head competition, whoever won the game would win the championship. So, if it came down to Denison and us, I would think that we'd win it." 
All ofthis hinges on wins by Notre Dame and Denison, of course, but because both teams have the home­field advantage, the scenario is quite probable, especially this season when the home team has won nearly every big MLA game. 
"Because the teams in the con­

ference are becoming more equal, 
it's always an advantage being at 
home," says O'Leary. "There are bet­
ter teams in the league now, and 
more teams are capable of beating 
the top teams, so the home field is 
becoming even more important." 
The Irish players are understan­dably excited about their chances, but they first have to get past the much-improved Spartans. 
"Michigan State is a very physical, very aggressive team," says O'Leary. "They're definitely better than they were last year. They just challenged Ohio Wesleyan all the time. They're pretty strong at attack -especially one guy who's very talented -and

they were able to control the ball a lot." 
Notre Dame will be looking to control the tempo just as it has done in every game of its six-game win streak. In nearly every game, the Irish were able to jump out to a large, early lead, and then hold off the opponent in the second halfwith a tough defense. O'Leary does not 

The Notre Dame track team returns home this 
Track team at home 
It has been a long time since the Notre Dame track team la~t com­peted on its home track -March 31 to be exact -but, this weekend,Joe Plane's Irish will return to the Monogram Track to play host to the Midwest Catholic Championships. 
The competition features teams from Catholic colleges in the Mid­west like DePaul, Loyola, and Marquette. Notre Dame, which goes into the meet as the favorite, expects the toughest competition to come from DePaul, whose strength is in the sprints, and Marquette, which boasts some good distance runners. 
Plane plans to use some ofthe runners who have not competed in recent weeks while the team travelled to meets in Iowa, Tennessee, and Illinois. However, he also hopes to allow some ofhis better nm­ners to compete in races they normally do not run. 
The meet also gives the Irish runners one more chance to qualify for the prestgious IC4A Outdoor Championships. Last week at the Drake Relays, three Notre Dame runners qualified: Mark Wozniak in the 10,000 meters,JeffVanWie in the 800-meter run, and jim Tyler in the I500 meters.

Associated Press 
MONTREAL -Bryan Trottier's power-play goal and Brent Sutter's shorthanded score in the first period carried the four-time National Hock­ey League champion New York Is­landers within a victory of the Stanley Cup finals last night with a 3-1 decision over the Montreal Canadiens. 
The Islanders. who were man­handled here in the first two games ofthe best-of-seven Prince of Wales Conference final, used a staunch defense and the goaltending of Billy Smith to grab a 3-2lead in the series. Ifthey win at home tomorrow night, they will advance to the champion· ship round against the Edmonton Oilers, who New York swept in last year's finals. 
The opportunistic Islanders took advantage of their only first-period power play when Trottier banged in a rebound of his own shot. Defen­seman TomasJonsson broke into the Montreal zone and fed Trottier, whose deflection wa'> stopped by Montreal goalie Steve Penney. The puck fell directly in front of Penney and Trottier lifted it into the net at 3:55. 
The Islanders' penalty killing was perfect in the flrst period, stopping four Montreal power plays. And, on the second of those power plays, Sutter broke out of his zone, moved around the Canadiens' Steve Shutt and sent a wrist shot past Penney's stick at 9:36. 
A sloppy second period featured just four shots on goal for each team and just one good scoring oppor­tunity. Montreal's Mark Hunter slipped a wrist shot past Smith, but it bounced off the goal post and harm­lessly away from the net. 
The victory was just the second in the Montreal Forum for the Islan­ders in nine playoff games.
