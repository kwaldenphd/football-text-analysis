Potential candidates for class offices, senate gear up for elections 
By CLIFF STEVENS 
News Staff 
As the student body president contest comes down the stretch to­day, potential candidates for the class offices, Student Senate and off-campus commissioner races are lining up at the starting blocks. 
Mandatory candidate meetings were held last night by Om­budsman to register names, distribute petition forms and discuss campaign rules. 
The class officer, senate and off­campus commissioner elections are slated for March 18, with run-offs on March 20 if necessary. 
Nine possible sophomore class office tickets, one possible junior class ticket, and two possible senior class tickets attended. Three possi­ble off-campus commissioner can­didates also were present. 
Ten possible candidates for the senate attended, with one from district I, three from district 3, two from district 4, and four from off­campus. 
No potential candidate attended from district 2, which includes Stanford, Keenan, Zahm, Cavanaugh, Breen-Phillips and Farley. 
Class office tickets and off­campus commissioner candidates must return 100 signatures, accor· ding to Ombudsman election rules. Senate candidates must return 75 signatures to become official can­didates on the ballot. Students may only sign petitions for a candidate in their own district. 
Candidates technically must have attended last night's meeting to ap­pear on the ballot, said Om­budsman Director David Stephenit­ch. Whether late candidates for district 2 senator will be write-ins or allowed on the ballot will be deter­mined by the Ombudsman Election Committee, he said. 
Possible sophomore class office tickets in attendance, listed in the order of president, vice president, treasurer, and secretary, were Stephen Shake, Mike Kletzly, Susan Rosenthal and Gretchen Schauer; Liam Brennan, Mary Mc­Carthy, Tim Lake and Jeff Utz; George Molinsky, Karen Ruff, An­dy Kinney and Carolyn Aylward. 

Other tickets in attendance that may run, listed in the same order as above, include fatdck Creadon, Erica Hinkle, Sam Bailey and Tom DiResta; Kris Malaker, Brian DiBona, John Ofenloch and Melissa Houk; Michael Moynihan, Christopher Sullivan, PatriciaFann­ing and Timothy Cummins; Michael Keegan, Matine Beamon, Ellen Nichols and Peter Hartweger; Pat Cooke, Theresa Barnhart, John Ruhlin and Chris Anne Downes.

I'm on mission from God, says Apollo 15 astronaut

Colonel James Irwin once went on a mission to the moon. His mis­sion today, however, concerns the Son-Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

"Jesus walking on the earth was more important than man walking on the moon," he said. "I've had my highest flight, but the Lord has given me a new mission, to be your servant, to share the love of Christ."

A new computer store opened Monday in Room 25 of the Computing Center to replace the General Micro store which closed in December. Two 



New campus computer store opens 
By MARY REYNOLDS 
Staff Reporter 
The University opened a com­puler store in the Computing Center Monday to replace the General Micro story closed last December. 
The new store, located in room 25 and open weekdays 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., became necessary after the store, formerly in the basement of LaFortune, was closed because General Micro went bankrupt. 
In opening the new store, the University is fulfilling an agree­ment with Apple Computers, Inc. Under this agreement, known as the Apple Consortium, Notre Dame faculty and students can buy Apple computer equipment at 
reduced prices as long as the University provides a store to sell and service the equipment. 
When the University initially entered the consortium in 1983, it contracted General Micro for this service. But when General Micro filed for bankruptcy last semester the University was forced to replace the firm. 
"We were faced with the decision of whether to get another outside company or do it internally," said Jim Wruck, director of the Com­puting Center. "Ultimately, we felt it would be better for students and the University to do it internally," he said. 
"We will look at financial opera-lions of the store much more close­ly than we were able to when it was done by the outside firm," Wruck said. 
The University has assumed G eneral Micro's financial obliga­tions to members of the Notre Dame community, said Vice Presi­dent for Business Affairs Thomas Mason. 
"There were only a few students that had orders in process, and as far as I. know no students have suf­fered in the transaction," Mason said. 
By having the University operate the store at the Computing Center, students and faculty who buy equipment will receive more com­plete service, said Kelly Havens, assistant director for User Servies at the Computing Center. 
With the old store, Havens said, it was difficult to coordinate the store with the services available at the Computing Center. "For exam­pie, a lot of people didn't realize that there were demo units at the Computing Center," she said. 
"By having it all in one spot pea-pie will be able to make better deci­sions in the first place and know where to go for help afterwards," Havens said. 
"Since the consultants at the Computing Center aren't connected to the store, they can give unbiased advice to people who buy equip­ment," said Wruck. 

Another advantage of the new store is that the University will have greater control in promoting pro­ducts that will be in the long-range 
interests of students, Wruck said. 

Wruck said that prices in the new store will be comparable to those in the old store. "The store is just another service that the University is providing. We don't want to lose money, but we don't want to make a profit. That way we can sell equipment to faculty and students at the best possible price," he said.

said. 
Then disaster struck in 1961. While training a pilot in a small airplane, he crashed. Irwin surviv­ed, but was critically injured. Doc­tors assured him that he'd never fly again. 
But Irwin was obsessed with fly­ing, he said, and began wondering what he'd do with his life. Irwin started praying. And he realized that he had drifted far from the Lord. 
With new determination based on a new faith, he reenrolled in the F-12 program. And when the space program blossomed in the mid 1960's, he decided "space was the highest, fastest I could go." 
In 1966 he was picked for the astronaut training program. He trained for five years and finally went to the moon as part of the Apollo 15 crew. 
Irwin narrated a movie which detailed the mission, saying that he and fellow astronaut Colonel Dave

Aquino releases communist rebels 
Associated Press 
MANILA, Philippines -Presi­dent Corazon Aquino freed two former communist rebel leaders yesterday despite reservations from the military, and paid her visit to the palace in which Ferdinand Mar­cos lived for 20 years. 
Meanwhile, attorney Lupino Lazaro said two men cleared in the 1983 murder of Aquino's husband, Benigno, had given sworn statements admitting involvement and implicating the former presi­dent, his wife Imelda and four former Cabinet ministers. Gen. Fa­bian Ver, Marcos' military com­mander, was among the 26 people acquitted. 
"I'm sorry for the delay," Ac­quino told Jose Maria Sison and Bernabe Buscayno when they were ushered into her temporary office less than an hour after being freed from military prisons. Two alleged members of a rebel assassination squad also were released. 
Aquino had pledged to free all political prisoners held by Marcos, who fled the country a week ago, and the four were the last on the list. Most of the prisoners have not yet gone home because of required medical checkups and paper work. 

Presidential spokesman Rene Saguisag said the four men were released after a "candid, cordial, and vigorous exchange of views" with military commanders, worried that they would take up arms again. Her top military advisers had argued the four men should not be freed unconditionally. 
Sison acknowledged at a news conference a few hours after his release that he found the Com­munist Party of the Philippines in 1968 and led the armed struggle against the Marcos government un­til his capture in November 1977. He had refused throughout his im­prisonment to answer questions about his party role. 
Buscayno, who was captured in August 1976, was the alleged com­mander of the party's New People's Army guerrillas and was known as Commander Dante. 
The two other men released were Alexander Birondo and Ruben Alegre. Both were arrested within the past two years. 
Cardinal Jaime Sin, archbishop of Manila, said in Rome that the estimated 12,500 insurgents might surrender this month because "there's no reason for them to stay in the mountains" with Marcos gone. Sin, who led the nation's Roman Catholic bishops in support of Aquino, was on a visit to the Vatican.

Stop worrying about restructuring, start worrying about real concerns 
Student government ... why? Andy Looney is not the only one who could be ask­ing that question these days. 
Constitutions have become as commonplace as the flu around campus. There are different interpreta­tions of the rules for every student leader you talk to. And "restructuring" has become a household word. 
In short, mass confusion reigns in student govern­ment. 
Last week, the Committee on Restructuring was all set to implement its long-planned and carefully work­ed out constitution, designed to enlarge the senate, as soon as the Hall Presidents' Council or the students ratified it. Only they didn't. 
If"Committee of Restructuring" has a familiar ring to it, it may be because just one year ago, the Committee to Restructure Student Government (known as CREST) came out with its own proposal for a drastic overhaul of student government. This too, quickly died. 
And don't forget last October's insta-constitution, by which Student Body President Bill Healy and four other student leaders attempted to disband the senate and restructure the Campus Life Council overnight. 
The latest attempt to cure the ills of student govern­ment was just three days ago, when yet another con­stitutional proposal was brought before the senate, this time to toss out the senate except for five members who would sit only on the Campus Life Council. Lob­bying is already going full speed ahead both for and against this new proposal. 
Neither is the restructuring syndrome peculiar to students currently at Notre Dame. The senate has only existed since 1980, when a new constitution created it. Another senate, way back in the sixties, was disband­ed in 1972. In between eras of the senate, there was a Board of Commissioners which was completely restructured every two years or so, under a new con­stitution. 
Confused? So am I. 

Somehow among all the committees, the proposals, and the arguing over rules, the same basic thing always emerges. It is a group of organizations that ac­complish many valuable things every year, but fail to make an impression on either the administration or most students. 
Student government seemed to have hit new lows in terms of student respect last year. One presidential ticket was disqualified for election violations and reinstated by a secret vote of the senate. Then the senate extended its term to finish the restructuring which nev·er came through anyway. But this year has been even more laughable. Why else would 20 per.cent of the vote for student body president have gone to the candidate whose platform promised "a national cam­

paign to change macaroni and cheese to cheese and macaroni?" 
What is the cause of all the restructuring mania? It always seems to occur when there has been a plunge in student government's credibility. The proponents of each new constitution seem to believe this is the one that will really make student government effective, respected and efficient. This is the one that will make the administration listen and the students get involv­ed. 
But the overhauls, no matter how drastic, don't really make a different in terms of getting things done. Countless manhours are spent researching, rewriting, and publicizing new constitutions, but what is there to show for it? Simply a differently-structured organiza­tion. 
Those hours could be spent far better by working within the structure that already exists. Student government already has enough to do without con­stantly trying to revise itself. There are always issues that need to be addressed (like parietals, divestment and WVFI-AM). The administration needs to be con­fronted with student concerns. And student input needs to be collected, not to mention running all the day-to-day programs and events. 
One of the main tasks of the new student body president should be to restore the badly shaken con­fidence in and respect for student government. It has little to do with how many senators there are or who can propose amendments. It has to do with how effec­tively it responds to students and makes their voices heard to the administration.

Little Sister's Weekend returns to Saint Mary's 
By ELLYN MASTAKO 
&nior Staff Reporter 
After a year's absence, Little Sister's Weekend has returned to Saint Mary's College. 
The annual event was cancelled last year because of lack of interest, according to Karyn Ruesch, the weekend's chairperson. 
"People really missed the event last year," she said. "I guess they just took it for granted and once it was gone, they realized what they missed." 
Attendance has surpassed the committee's best expectations, Ruesch said. "We had planned for 80, and hoped for 100. As of today, we have 360 little and big sisters. That was a real pleasant surprise," she said. 
Although there is no age require­ment for the little sisters, the com­mittee has geared most of the vents toward the 10-to 16-year-old age bracket, said Ruesch. 
"In the past, they have planned events for all age ranges," she said. "This year we tried to make the events interesting for the most popular age group. 
"Of course, sisters of all age ranges are welcome, Ruesch add­ed. 
Planned events begin tomorrow with registration in Haggar Parlor from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., a Merle Norman cosmetics makeover from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. in Carroll Hall, and an ice cream boat in Haggar Parlor from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. 
On Saturday, a fashion show and brunch will be held in Regina north and south lounges from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Fashions are courtesy of Maurice's located in the University Park mall. 
Other events to be held Saturday include a sports festival in Angela and Regina pool from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., a pizza party from 7 p.m. un­til8:30 p.m. in Haggar Parlor, and the showing of the movie "Footloose" at 9 p.m. in Carroll Hall. 
The weekend's events will con­clude on Sunday with a Mass in Holy Cross Chapel at 11 :30 a.m. followed by a brunch in the dining hall.

Although last year's Government Career Day was cancelled because of the Valentine's Day blizzard, this is the eighth time the event has been held, according to Paul Reynolds, assistant director of Career and Placement Services. 
Two years ago there were ap­proximately 250 to 300 students who participated in the event, Reynolds said. 
Fewer agencies will be attending the career day than in past years, Reynolds said. He added, "In the past five or six years there has been a slight decrease due to the lack of hiring on the agencies' part." 
Reynolds said the event was mainly an information gathering session. "I think it's an excellent op­portunity, especially (for) underclassmen who are interested in careers in government." he said. 
"Originally the day was started as an instrument to aid liberal arts ma­jors," Reynolds said. "But now ... all students can benefit from this, not just liberal arts majors." 
He added there are a variety of employemt opportunities open to business, science and engineering majors as well.

Researchers link service in Vietnam to increased suicide rate 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -Vietnam veterans are nearly twice as likely to commit suicide as men in the same age group who avoided the war, a new study concludes. 
Researchers say they believe their work is the first to show a cause­and-effect relationship between military service in Vietnam and an unusual risk of suicide. 
"I think it demonstrates the ex­perience of being drafted during the Vietnam era had profound, long-term psychological effects on people," said Dr. Norman Hearst of the University of California, San Francisco. 
The study concludes that Viet­nam veterans were 86 percent more

likely than non-veterans to die of suicide in the years after the war, and they were 53 percent more like­ly to die in traffic accidents. 
The research was based on a survey of death records of men who were involved in the draft lottery from 1970 to 1972. They concluded that military service during that three-year period was directly link­ed to an estimated 1 ,250 non-war deaths throughout the United States in the years that followed. 
"If the draft affected men in the same way through the whole viet­nam era as it appeared to affect them for these three years, then the number might be in the tens of thousands," Hearst said. 
The study, directed by Hearst, was published in today's New however, because a low lottery number didn't necessarily mean military service. In fact, only 26 percent of the draft eligible men entered the military during the three years, while 9 percent of draft-exempt men served as volunteers. 
When the researchers took into account the percentages in each group who actually served, they projected that the suicide rate was 86 percent higher among the veterans.

Four million Americans served in Indochina during the Vietnam War, and 800,000 were assigned to combat. Some studies have found higher levels of depression, drug abuse, marital problems, criminal charges and other difficulties among the veterans. 
However, some critics speculate that the veterans have trouble because they were poorer and less educated than those who avoided the draft, not because of any linger­ing effects of military service. 
The new study was based on a review of death records of 14,145 men in Pennsylvania and Califor­nia who were born between 1950 and 1952 and died between 1974 and 1983.

Between 1970 and 1972, the military lottery randomly assigned these men on the basis of their birth rates into two groups -those with low lottery numbers who were eligi­ble for the draft and those with high numbers who were exempt. 
The researchers noted that because of the random lottery the two groups were identical except for their draft status. So any dif­ferences between them in later years must be caused by the draft. 
"We've hit upon what we call an experiment of nature," Hearst said. "When we see a difference, it's clear a cause-and-effect relationship."

The coffins were lowered into the pale, sun-scorched ground of the nearby hillside cemetery after the service. Some mourners threw in ragged bits of clothing as gestures of remembrance. 
Police reported earlier yesterday that three more blacks were slain in overnight violence in black townships, including a woman kill­ed by a grenade tossed into her home. Her son, a rights activist, was seriously wounded. 
Authorities said a limpet mine, a favorite weapon of the outlawed African National Congress, caused the explosion at Johannesburg police headquarters Tuesday that wounded two policemen and two passers-by.

"I use the incident as an example of God's guidance," Irwin said. Later in the mission, he felt com­pelled to recite the first verse of Psalm 121, the only scripture quoted on the surface of the moon. 
He said the future of space travel looks good, despite the fact that "we've lost our ability to go into space for a while" because of the shuttle accident. 
Like most people, he said, he follows the shuttle investigations in the media, and has no connection with the investigation. He predicted NASA will continue, perhaps with new leaders. 
Irwin said we need to re-prove the safety of our space program, and predicted a space station, more reliable space transportation and journeys back to the moon and to Mars within 20 years. 
Why does he make such presen­tations, mixed with religion and science? 
"It's a good experience for these cadets to meet me and hear about my experience in the Air Force." He said we all need to learn from others, adding "We all need heros," in whose footsteps we can follow. 
After the presentation Captain Roger Overturf said the leadership labs are designed to teach cadets practical and operational matters of military service. He said Irwin's emphasis on his relationship with God is a unique part of his presen­tation about service as an astronaut. 
Correction 
Because of incorrect informa­tion supplied to The Observer, an error was made in yesterday's station manager story. WSND­FM Station Manager Eileen Ridley has performed her duties as station manager before her resignation became official.

30,000 mourn black riot victims, demonstrate for end to apartheid 
Black-power chants and
Associated Press 

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa­At least 30,000 black mourners, joined by hundreds of whites, turn­ed a mass funeral for 17 black riot victims yesterday into a vast demonstration of opposition to apartheid. 
The throng packed a soccer stadium in Alexandra, a squalid black township wedged among the richest white suburbs of Johan­nesburg. In the crowd were activist Winne Mandela and diplomats from seven-Western nations, in­cluding the United States. 
Among clergymen of all races was the Rev. Beyers Naude, 70, an Afrikaner whose spiritual journey from faith in apartheid to the strug­gle for black rights has made him a symbol of white liberalism. 
"Nn nne is free in this country as long as the black man is not free," Mike Beea, president of Alexandra Civic Association, told the mourners. ''We are simply saying, dismantle apartheid." 
"When is this brutality going to stop?" he asked. "When is this bar­barism going to end?" 
Police with rifles manned all en­trances to Alexandra and searchd incoming cars, ·including that of -Betsy Spiro, political counselor of the U.S. embassy. They stayed well away from the stadium, but a helicopter circled overhead. 
With most other forms of protest banned, the crowd -which some estimates put at 50,000 or more ­transformed the service into a huge rally against the offical apartheid race policy that reserves privilege for South Africa's 5 million whites and denies rights to the 24 million hla..:ks.

Songs From the Film, Keene's first Geffen LP (and not a sound­track at all) is an excellent collec­tion of hooky, moody pop songs 
The lyrics to ."As Life Goes By" exemplify his style: 
As far as you know, the feeling's over now Now you can say, "We watch as life goes by" You see the hand move on the wall You feel alone and not so tall 
always sound nice. He's not one of those guys who suffers from the "sensitive singer /songwriter" syn­drome, and he's not one of those self-important tunesmiths who get big heads when they get too many good reviews. Keene is honest, modest and most important, he's talented. 
Combination of beats makes strong debut 
TOM Tlt:RNEY 
features writer 

The day the breakup of the English Beat occurred, late in 1983, was a sad one for many people. The band that epitomized the racially­mixed two-tone movement and who so skillfully infused politics into their reggae-influenced brand of pop music split up when the two singer-songwriters left to form General Public. 

Records 

him to jom their new band, and together they formed the Fine Young Cannibals. 
Now, two years later, their debut album is out on IRS Records, and it is simply titled Fine Young Can­nibals. The FYC's style is much more jazzy than the Beat ever was, and they use a combination of organ, horns, and vocals to com­prise the melody, with the guitar used sparsely, and usually only to keep rhythm. 
The one aspect of their sound that sets them apart from some of the other new pop bands that bor­

This left the rest of the Beat high and dry without the creative forces that kept them together for those four years. Andy Cox, the guitar player, and David Steele, the bass player, though extremely bitter, decided to carry on and write some new songs for a new band they were planning to put together. 
The only thing they Jacked was a singer, until they spotted Roland Gift singing in the clubs around London. They liked him, and asked 
Sade and Everythmg But the G1rl, is Roland's unique style of singing, in which he distorts the words, as if in pain, rendering them almost in­telligible. As a result, he uses his voice more as a source of melody than as a vehicle to recite lyrics. 
This is best illustrated on the first, and finest, song on the album, "Johnny Come Home." This song has the familiar theme of the boy who leaves the small town for the intoxicating decadenccf of the city, except Roland blames himself for causing Johnny to leave, expresses his sorrow, and urges him to come home so Roland can get on with his life without this guilt. 
What is wrong In my life that I must get drunk Every night? Johnny, We're sorry, Won't you come on home. 
One other rather unique song is a cover version of the old classic, "Suspicious Minds," which my roommate thinks Elvis Presley used to sing, as I could not recall who did it. 
"Funny How Love Is," however, 
is more typical of the rest of the 
songs on the album. It is a slow, 
Caribbean-influenced song, featur­
ing an almost classical guitar riff and the searing saxophone of Saza, the elderly Jamaican man who hasn hasn't been seen since the Beat's last album. The lyrics focus on the politics of the personal, as Roland expresses his desire, because of the very pain involved, not to see his former girlfriend for a very long time.

Some of the other good rhythms never quite break into the 
songs on the album include "Blue," spontaneity that the Beat enjoyed.

The Blind and ~ \, the Naked

\'\ \ *** 
(outollour) 

The group was an underground 
hit in 1983 with their own brand of dance music comprised largely of acoustical instruments. "Blister in the Sun" and others are still party favorites today. 
Where the first album oozed with teenage frustration over girls and 
life in general, this, the band's third album, sees the group moving toward a more mature stance both 
musically and lyrically. Unfor­tunately, the band has failed to channel their maturity onto both sides of the album. 
The first side sputters along never really getting into ~my kind of groove. "Old Mother Reagan" is 
typical of the first side in that the song is too choppy and fails to grab one's attention. 
The second side redeems this album. Here the band gains the focus that was lacking on the first side by going back to what Gordan 
Gano does best, that is, wrestle with frustrating relationships. Each song borders on the frantic with its 
desire to end the pain of relation-)~ ships gone wrong. f:. In "Good Friend" Gano sings: ·~, 
Seems like every time I turn around l  My heart's on the mend M 'cause I don't think yo~ want me 31 to be your good frtend. .,...

After the fighters exhcanged blows equally for most of the first two rounds, Loughran was able to land three sucessive rights in the third to capture a unanimous deci­sion and set up a final with Thoms "Thunder and Lightning" newell, an earlier victor. 
"(Seals) was tough to beat. As for the final against Newell, he is an excellent fighter, one of the best we have," said Loughran. "I am looking forward to the fight a lot." 
By far the most crowd-pleasing fight of the evening was provided by a 175-pound matchup between Ignacio "BAng-Bang" O'Donnell and Michael "Spike" Renaud. For three straight rounds, these two ex­changed heavy-handed blows, go­ing toe-to-tow for the last two and bringin the 3,331 fans in Stepan Center to their feet. 
By the end of the fight, each fighter was having trouble keeping his feet, although neither one was willing to be put away. In the end, it was REnaud who would get the extremely close, split-decision vic­tory. 
"My right is what won it for me," said an exhausted Renaud after the fight. "He was going with left-left­right and left-right combinations, and I just countered with my right and tried to keep my hands up. I

Defending champions also fared 
well on the evening, as Joe· 
"Smokin' Joe" Collins and Donald 
"Transpo" Antrobus were suc­
cessful defending their titles, in the 
147-pound and the 165-pound divi­
sions, respectively. Antrobus was 
especially impressive, stopping 
Dennis "The· Menace" Coleman 
with I: 15 left to go in the second 
round. 
Some strong combinations in the corner and a walloping right hand hurt Coleman before the referee finally stepped in. Antrobus will take his power-punching and skillful boxing into the ring in the hopes of a second straight title Fri­day. 
"When I came out this year, I hoped to learn to box better, but when you get out there you forget that sometimes," said Antrobus. "Denny is a tough kid, we fought last year and I reallly tought it would go longer." 
When it was all over, all of the defending champions advanced to the finals along with some strong challengers who will be getting their first chance to win a championship jacket. Most of the emotional, fired-up crowd will be back as well for Friday night's finals, but some tickets will be on sale today at Gate 10 of the ACC fro the 7:30 p.m. event.

Previous NAIA All-American· 
Rafferty feels nervous excitement 
By ANDREA LaFRENIERE 
Sports Writer 
The first round of the NAIA Na­tionals begins today, and Saint Mary's swimmer Meghan Rafferty admitted that she is a little nervous from all the excitement surroun­ding the three-day event taking place at Whitworth College in Spokane, Wash. 
"We've been working towards Nationals all season, and it should be a good meet, but I'm starting to get nervous," said the sophomore from New Canaan, Conn. 
Rafferty, one of nine Belles par­ticipating in the competition, met the Nationals qualifying times for six events, including the 100-yard and 200-yard backstroke, the 200­yard and 400-yard freestyle relays, and the 200-yard and 400-yard medley relays. The sprinter/backstroke will swim the 50-yard freestyle event on optional time as well. 
If last year's results at Nationals are any indication, Rafferty should do well at the event. Last season she gained All-America status in the 200-yard backstroke and the 200-yard, 400-yard, and 800-yard freestyle ·relays. The english/history double major hopes to see similar results this weekend. 
"I'd like for our relays to make All-America (status), and I'd like to make the All-America team in one of my individual events," Rafferty said. 
Belles head coach Nancy Kuz­mitz is confident of Rafferty's suc­cess at the competition. 
"I'm sure she'll place in both in­dividual backstroke events," said Kuzmitz. "She'll be a big help with

the relays too. Meghan's a strong swimmer." 
According to Kuzmitz, Rafferty was a strong finisher throughout the regular season in individual events, as well as in relay events. 
"Meghan's been the highest scor­ing person on the team," she said. "She's either had a first or second­place finish every meet, and that's where the points are." 
Although Rafferty may be somewhat apprehensive about her own performance at Nationals, she said that the team results will be positive. 
"We have a pretty strong team," she said. "Our relays are strong, and I think we'll do well."

"Calloway really helped us in the second half," Knight said. "Steve' (Alford) played well." 
Spartan Coach J ud Heathcote called it a ''very disappointing per­formance," by his team, which entered the contest with a mathematical chance of winning the conference. 
"We played so poorly, it made (Indiana) look good," said Heathcote. "Maybe they played so good that it made us look bad. Maybe we were due for a poor 
game, because we've been playing 
so well." 
Skiles needed 21 points to break Gregory Keiser's old school scoring record of 2,014 points and got ex­actly that in the first half. 
The 6-1 scoring whiz from Plymouth, Ind., hooped a 15-foot turnaround jumper 1:59 before halftime to move one point ahead of Keiser, who starred for the Spar­tans from 1976-79. 
"I've scored a lot of points, but all I can think about right now is this loss," said Skiles, who turned 22 yesterday. "Records are nice, but they don't mean anything to

Skiles, the Big Ten scoring 
leader, exited the game after his

"I turned to make a pass and it

worried about it. I'd say chances of

The victory gives Tulsa, 23-8, an automatic berth in the NCAA tour­nament. Bradley, with a 31-2 record, also is expected to receive a tournament bid.

Beginning her career by accident 
Hynes becomes premier fencer 

By MIKE CARDINALE 
Sports Writer 
To start as a freshman in any varsity sport is a special challenge, but Notre Dame fencer Janice Hynes has handled the tasl.. of adapting to the pressures of college and the pressures of a major col­legiate fencing program equally well. 
Hynes has nailed down a starting position as a number two fencer, compiling a record of 61-14 this season. In addition, she has qualified for the individual NCAA Championships by winning the Midwest Regionals last weekend with a 12-2 mark. First-year Irish women's coach Yves Auriol praised Hynes' outstanding performance. 
"Last weekend, she realized she could be as good as any girl on the cotlege level," Auriol said. "She really went for it and she did a great job." 
Hynes has been a major factor in the most successful season in women's fencing history, but at first, she worried about how she would fit in as a freshman starter. "I wondered what the other girls

would think, but they've made it a lot easier," she said. 
"Janice has adapted very well," said Auriol. "Coming in this year, she has brought a lot of power to the team. The power of Janice and Molly (Sullivan) is what we needed for the team to do well nationally." 
Hynes began her fencing career almost by accident about six years ago. When she failed to make her school's basketball team, her mom suggested that she give fencing a try. Her initial reaction was not one of fascination. 
"I. thought it was weird," she said. But Hynes stuck with it, and she began to fence in small com­petitions in her home state of Massachusetts. She also took private lessons from fencing in­structor Joe Pechinski. 
The  highlight  of  Hynes'  pre­ 
Notre  Dame  career  was  a  fifth  
-place  finish  in  the  1985  Jti"nior  

Olympics in Tampa, Fla. The na­tional attention given this competi­tion thrilled Hynes and helped her to realize her potential. She decided that she wanted to attend a school

with a fencing program and Notre Dame fit the bill. 
Coach Auriol had known Hynes for three or four years from her participation in national events. "I knew she would be a great asset to our team," he said. 
Hynes has found the team em­phasis at Notre Dame to be the big­gest adjustment to make. "I never had been on a team before," she said. "Here the team is always the first priority." In terms of mechanics, Hynes feels that Auriol has done a lot to help her improve her foortwork. 
According to Auriol, Hynes' determination and confidence will help her to go a long way in her career at Notre Dame. She has made an immediate impact this year, and should continue to be a solid starter in the years to come. 
Hynes will join sophomore Mol­ly Sullivan and juniors Cindy Weeks and Vittoria Quaroni as the women's team travels to Princeton, N.J., for the NCAA Champion­ships, March 25-29. The team qualified by placing first in the Midwest Regional, capping off an undefeated 23-0 regular season, the best in women's fencing history.

Exciting 56th Bengal Bouts set up interesting last round 
By SCOTT INGLIS 
Sports Writer 

"Never a dull moment," is a phrase that best characterizes the 56th annual Bengal Bouts. That is, unless you are counting the ten-minute intermission coming halfway through the semi-final round last night. On either side of that intermission, however, the crowd of 3,331 fans was treated to 29 contests and some thrilling action. 
Providing a great deal of the early excite­ment was Thomas "HAmmerin' Hank" Hayman, a 132-pound junior, who pum­meled an overmatched Wilson Walter from the opening bell in the third match of the evening. 
Landing three successive rights and drawing blood early in the first round, Hayman continued to pound Walter, with the crowd on its feet until the fight was stopped at 1:11 to go in the second, as Hayman advanced to the finals. 
Shortly thereafter, in the 138-pound divi­sion, Anthony Bonacci, a former cham­pion and great finesse fighter, went three rounds to defeat a difficult opponen\, Timothy "The Soccor Psycho" Hartigan on a split decision. 
"He was really tough to get to early," said Bonacci. "I was a little rusty starting out, but I have to give him credit, he fought a great fight." 
Bonacci's victory, coupled with the win of his friend Edward "Fast Eddie" Bornemann over Steven Slaughter in the other semi-final, should make for one of the more interesting final match ups Friday. 
Bornemann and Bonacci are best friends and have been sparring and working out together six-days-a-week in preparation for the Bengals. 
Ifyou like to pull for the underdog, then you would have been pulling for the 147­pound Robert Harig after the first round of his bout with Robert "Nikita" Prebenda a few fights later. 
Prebenda came out swinging in the first round, landing numberous right leads on Harig's head, drawing blood from his nose, and forcing a standing eight-count. Things continued to look grim for Harig in the se­cond round until he suddenly landed a right-left combination that stunned Prebenda. From there on, the table was truned, as harig staged the greatest com­eback of the night, pounding his opponent with a strong left for the remainder of the bout. 
"This was by far the toughest fight I've ever been in," said Harig, still bruised and bleeding after the match "I was so excited at the start that I was forgetting to use what I learned in practice. After a while, though, things started to go as I thought they would." 
One of the most promising matchups on the evening, a fight between Pat "Joe Man" Loughran and Mark "night Train" Seals, lived up to its billing in the 145-pound weight division. Seals, who scored a 14­second knockout in his opening bout Sun­day, could not overcome the powerful pun­ching of Loughran in this one.
