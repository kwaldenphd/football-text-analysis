At SMC commencement 
Brademas to deliver speech 

by Marti Hogan Asst. St. Mary's Editor 

Indiana Congressman John Bra­demas has been invited to deliver the 1976 Commencement Address at St. Mary's College on Saturday, May IS. 
"Congressman Brademas is a felicitous selection for our com­mcnccmcnl speaker," said St. Mary's President John M. Duggan. 
"During his years on the House Education and Labor Committee, Congressman Brademas has play­cd a principal role in helping to write most of the major legislation concerning elementary and secon­dary education, higher education and vocational education." Duggan commented. 
"It is appropriate that we, an institution of higher learning should honor a man who has been such an ardent supporter of educa­tion," Duggan added. 
The decision to invite Brademas, however, has met with consider­able criticism from St. Mary's seniors who pointed out that Brad­
BRADEMAS emas was not on the list of 
suggested speakers that the seni­ors voted on last September. 
"We just got a newsletter saying Congressman Brademas was going to be our commencement speak­er." said Mary Egan, a St. Mary's senior. "They didn't explain it to us. 
According to several seniors it was rumored that Brademas had asked to be the speaker for politcal reasons. 
However, it was the decision of the Academic Affairs Council to invite Brademas, explained Gail Mandell. assistant to the vice-pres­ident of Academic Affairs. 
"We approached him. He didn't ask us," Joan McDermott. student representative to the Academic Affairs Council. said. "We chose Brademas because our chances of getting him were pretty good." 
According to McDermott the three people on the list who had received the most votes were unable to attend because of prior committments. The remaining choices had received such a I,ow

Academic Council changes CAP appointment, promotion methods 
by Terry Keeney Editor-in-Chief 

The Academic Council voted yesterday to require formal consul­tation among a dean, department chairman and a departmental l"llmmittec on appointments and promotions (CAP) in cases where then· is disagreement over a CAP rcl"Ommcnda lion. 
The Council rc.iected a proposal to establish an appeals procedure to handle cases of differences between a departmental CAP and the president or provost. 
The Council action revises the Academic Manual provisions for all faculty appointments, promotions and tenure. Under current proce­dures, all departments have a committee on appointments and promotions which makes recom­mendations to the department chairman. Both the CAP and the chairman report to the dean on appointment and promotions mat­ters. 
Under current procedures the CAP may not know whether the chairman or dean agrees with its recommendations. The revisions passed by the Council assure that the CAP formally consults with the dean and the chairman when they disagree. 
''The purpose of the revision was to give the CAP a greater voice in the whole tenure and promotion process". said Paul Conway, chairman of the Faculty Senate which proposed the revisions. 
Conway believes the changes make the deans and chairman more accountable to the CAP. "Depart­mental committees should know better than anyone else who should be promoted," he said. 
Fr. James Burtchaell, University provost. believes the major pur­pose of the Faculty Senate proposal was to weaken the authority of the administration in appointments, promotions and tenure;: matters. 
"The purpose was really to weaken the Administration. mean­ing to include the deans, the provost and the president." Bur­tchaell said. 
During the Council meeting, Burtchaell released figures from academic year 1974-75 which noted that 97 per cent of the CAP recommendations were approved by the department chairmen. deans and provost. In only ten cases were CAP recommendations on ap­

Gassman-Casey elected SBP-SVBP 
by Ken Bradford Copy Editor 
Mike Gassman and Mike Casey 

overwhelmed their two opposing 
tickets yesterday and secured a 
resounding victory in the student 
body elections. 
Gassman and Casey received 

2,062 votes, well over the simple 
majority necessary to avoid a 
run-off election. Tim Boyle and 

Peter Gaa placed second with 590 
votes and Mike Sweigert and Bill 
Walsh received 535 votes. 
In getting over 64 per cent of the total vote, Gassman carried every hall except Grace and St. Edward's halls. The Gassman ticket also won a simple majority of the votes in 18 of the 22 voting districts. 
Gassman's greatest support came from his home hall, Stanford. where he received 231 votes, 92 per cent of the hall's total. Pangborn, Casey's home hall, provided the winners with 160 votes. Four other halls chose the Gassman ticket by near -80 per cent margins. 
Voter turnout was also best in Stanfrord and Pangborn --both halls had 88 per cent of their residents vote. Alumni Hall's participation was 80 per cent. 
Only 141 off-campus students voted --about ten per cent voter participation. Overall voter parti­cipation 49 per cent. 
The Boylc-Gaa ticket showed sur­prising strength in winning in St. Edward's and Grace, Gaa's home hall. Sweigert and Walsh also did their best in Grace but were unable to win any halls. 
Gassman, a junior, was a candi­date in last year's student body elections but his ticket was elimin­ated in the primary. In that election, he finished third among eight candidates but carried four halls. 
Casey, also a junior, was not a candidate in last year's elections but served as Pangborn Hall presi­dent this year. 
Gassman and Casey attributed their victory to a superior campaign organ\zation and to the hard work of their campaign workers. Gas­sman said he had over 90 people working for him in the dormitories and had influential hall leaders -­like hall presidents --spreading his name around. 
Gassman said his platform was based on their experience in camp­us government, and he said this was the only real issue in the campaign. Gassman received most of his name-recognition from his leadership in a struggle with the University administration over the calendar issue. 
Casey agreed that the key to the election was in "getting the right people to work their tails off for us.'' 

Casey added that the Observer endorsement may have helped in increasing their margin of victory. "The endorsement helped by get­ting our some of the people who normally might not vote," he said. 
The losing candidates agreed that it was the Gassman-Casey cam­paign organization which decided the election. 
"The Observer endorsement could not have made much dif­ference in the election," Sweigart 
stated.  "Gassman was just  too  
well organized."  
Walsh  said  his  ddt:<tl  in  the  

election did not represent a reject­ion of his ticket's platform. "There really wasn't anv difference in till' platforms," Walsh said. "Mr. Gassman succeeded in cstabli~hing one issue --his experience in Student Govc'rnment." 
Only time will tell if "experience in leadership" is a valid lTill'rion for selecting a student body pres­ident. Walsh said. 
Boyle, who campaigned with the slogan "I may he crazy but J' m not stupid". said he was ·pleased with his showing in the election. "This prov~s that everybody here is not as straight-laced as most people think."

"We literally had no choice," commented Terry Kerley, another senior. "Even our senior class officers didn't know of the decision until a little note appeared outside of Dr. Duggan's office." 
''Time was close and a decision had to be made,'' McDermott said, explainingwhy seniors were not involved with or informed of the decision.

SLC finals tomorrow 
by Ken Bradford Copy Editor 

Elections will be necessary in all three voting districts of the Student Life Council (SLC) after no candi­date received a majority vote in yesterday's primary. 
Jeff Simnick and peter Haley will battle for the South Quad seat and Len Moty and John Steinman will vie for the Off-Campus seat. Mary Charchut and Ed Van Tassel reached the Wednesday election 
without  oppostion  for  the  North  
Quad seat.  
Simnick  and  Haley  eliminated  

Pat Russell from the South Quad race by collecting 42 and 32 per cent of the quad vote, respectively. 
Simnick carried nine of the 14 halls on his quad in receiving his 614 votes. Haley carried only three halls but received 102 of his 469 votes in Alumni, his home hall. Russell carries two halls, including his home hall of Dillon, but finished well out of the race with 364 votes. 
In the off-campus elections, Moty and Steinman moved to the run-offs by defeating Tom Digan and John Kinney. Steinman collec­ted 51 votes, Moty got 48, Digan got 24 and Kinney got 13. 
No off-campus candidate receiv­ed more than four per cent of the total off-campus contingent. 
Elections chairman peter Gott­sacker said the SLC run-offs will be Wednesday at the same times and locations as the primary balloting. 
Gottsacker added that his com­mittee's attempts to increase off­campus student participation in the elections have proved fruitless. The committee had extended off-
ND marriages termed 'remarkably stable' 
Despite a rising national divorce rate, the marraiges of Notre Dame alumni are remarkably stable, ac­cording to a recent survey of the University's graduates, 
The average divorce-separation rate for Notre DAme's undergrad­uate alumni is only 5.6 per cent. Ninety-three per cent of Notre Dame's graduates are still living with their first spouse, and slightly more than 1 per cent are living alone or have remarried after the death of their first spouse. 
The divorce-separation rate is the lowest for the marraiges of two Notre Dame alumni--3.3 per cent-­and only slightly higher for mar­raiges between Notre Dame alumni and graduates of nearby Saint Mary's College--3.8 per cent. Eight per cent of alumni first marriages to spouses . without a college education have been foun­dered, compared to 4.9 per cent of those to spouses graduated from institutions other than Notre Dame and St. Mary's. 
In terms of religious affiliation, the divorce-separaton rate is low­est--4.4 per cent--for Catholic a­lumni of Notre Dame and higher for alumni having other religious affil­iations or none. 
Women's B-ball pep rally tonight 
A pep rally will be held tonight for the Notre Dame women's basketball team in preparation of their game with St. Mary's on Wednesday. Featured speakers include Head Coaches Jeanne Earley and Sally Duffy, co-captains Mary Clemency, Patti Coogan and Becky Banasiak. The rally will begin at 10 p.m. in the basement of Farley.

campus voting hours, but the turnout did not improve. "The off-campus delegate seat in the SLC may be in danger if· the off-campus students don't show a greater interest," he warned. 
This year's election proceeded without any major compalints from candidates about campaigning vio­lations, Gottsdacker said. He credited the Ombudsman Office, the hall co-ordinators and commit­tee members Margo Pallardy, Tim O'Connell and Tim Cawley with doing an extremely efficient job in the ballot handling this time.

Washington-Lockheed Aircraft has just developed a new supersonic Bribe that can fly two times the speed of sound. The Bfibe, which took 10 years to get off the drawing board, is called the Kickback 1100. Lockheed salespeople are claiming it is the most modern, versatile Bribe vehicle of its kind. 
One of the people involved in the project told me in strictest confidence the Kickback 1100 can carry a payload of up to $10 million to any corrupt official in the world. 
"Northrop Corp. doesn't have anything to compare with it," he said proudly. 
"How does it differ from the Bribe vehicles of the past?" 
"Speed for one thing," he said. "We can now Bribe an Italian general in three and a half hours, whereas it took us seven hours to get the bag to him in the past." 
"Boy, what will you space people think of next?" I said. 
"The Kickback also has special navigational equipment which is so accurate it can land $1 million on a Swiss bank vault with less than a 10-foot ceiling." 
"You say it, but can you do it?" 
"We did the other day. An African high government official asked us for $1 million to okay a contract for several of our air buses. He gave us the name and the number of a Swiss bank account. The Kickback 1100 took off from Nassau and landed in Geneva in a safe at three o'clock the next morning. The African official was so pleased he ordered another Kickback for his brother." 
My informant who had too many drinks or he never would have talked so much said, "The old defense Bribes were too noisy. Everyone heard about them. We told our engineers to completely redesign the Bribe so no one would recognize it. We wanted a model that would be smooth, fast, safe and so quiet that nobody in 
Congress could complain about the sound. It also had no odor.  The  
worst thing about a Bribe is that it eventually smells fishy."  
"That  must  have  been  a  tall  order  for  the  research  and  
development people."  

"We underestimated the cost of what it would take to develop a new Kickback by $40 million." 
"How did you get the money to make up for the overrun?" 
"We took several people from the Pentagon to our duck hunting club and explained the problem." "That was good thinking. It's hard for a guy in a duck blind to say no to someone who has an overrun." 
''Anyhow, we now have all the bugs out of the Kickback 1100 and we predict it will be the Bribe of the future. Everyone wants one. We have an order for three from a Japanese war criminal in Tokyo. He wants his painted gold. A South American president has asked for one decorated in German marks, and a member of a European royal family wants his covered with Dutch guilders." 
"Some senators have complained about the dangers of the Kickback particularly as it's related to the ozone level. Are you certain the new Lockheed Bribe can stand an environmental study?" I asked. 
''I'm certain of it. We tested our Bribes against those of France and England and many other foreign aviation companies. Not only were our Kickbacks larger and more comfortable but we have a five-year guarantee behind them. You don't have to take my word for it. Ask any· Arab prince in the Middle East."

Tuesday, Feb.ruary 24, 197b the observer 
the search for god leads to a retreat 
christie herlihy 

Within each one of us is a yearning for celebration. The urge to "grab all the gusto you can,·' goes back to our caveman ancestors. Though in these sophisticated times we may not dance around the tamptirc in bear skins after a victorious hunt, we do the next best thing--swarm onto the basketball lloor, screaming, yelling with toilet paper llying, to cut down the nets. We measure our lives by blowing out camlles, drinking toasts, passing out cigars, serving the turkey and the dress­ing. 
When there is a party in the air, we are sparked with anticipation. Work becomes less burdensome for soon we will have some mental relief. We look forward to being with friends and our minds wonder, considering who we'llmect, what we'll talk about, and the food and drink that we'll pass around together. 
What makes a good party'! No doubt some morning after you have kicked this around with your roommate and discovered that the night before was an experience shared with others; you recall a certain warmth, a fraternity the next morning and when you see those friends again. 
In just this same intimate way, the Partners-In-Dialogue retreat at Old Col­lege. Jan. 25 became a sharing experience. 
It was a celebration which sprang from retlecting on the Eucharist as a celebra­tion. Father John Gallen and his staff from the Murphy Center of Liturgical Research, as well as Sr. Jane Pitz campus ministry staff gathered with interested students early Sunday morning downstairs in the kitchen. 
Entering Old College is like going back home, coming in from the snow and cold and then twisting down the narrow staircase to the warm kitchen below to where all the laughter is. But when I entered the kitchen, and saw people in sweaters clustered around the coffee urn, gathered around the yellow contact paper­ed table, munching powdered doughnuts, sipping coffee, laughing, and talking, I felt uneasy ... (l don't know anyone here, is this the right place?) I got a cup of coffee and then recognized faces from the dining hall, my theology class, Father Toohey, and good old Sister Jean. We carried our coffee upstairs and sat in a large circle, leaning our backs against the wood paneled walls or proping ourselves on pillows. Father Gallen introduced the discussion by defining what is meant by "celebration". How gathering for a reason gives an inner meaning which carries on after the party's over. He then read off lists of names, separating us into small groups and I was dissappointed that I was not with the only two people I knew. 
As the others left for different rooms, mv group materialized. Sr. Cathline Hughe"s welcomed us and said that we would learn each others names in the course of the

-----who are these guys? 
Like most other papers, the OBSERVER 

procures the records it reviews from a 
variety of sources. This year, the most 
common source has been sev"eral local 
record dealers who give us access to new 
releases in exchange for some sort of 
recognition in the article. Quite often, the 
reviewer will just get a record on his won 
out of personal interest. This is the second 
most common source. 
Record companies also supply us witl1 

promotional copies, not unlike they do a 
radio station. Unfortunately, they usually 
seem to send all the good albums to WSND 
and supply us with nothing worthwhile. At 
least, that's the way it usually is. This year 
the OBSERVER has been proud to pick up 
such classics as Bible Music of the Old 
Testament, The Greatest Hits of Shock and 
Musical Themes of the Late Fifties. 
Sometimes we get lucky--somebody 

must have made a mistake when they sent 
us Carole King's Thoroughbred. Or very 
rarely, one of the new "artists" they send 
you will turn out to be more than a burnt 
out politician, ex-footbaH player or Indian 
snake charmer. This did not originally 
seem to be the case when an album titled 
The Tufano and Giammarese Band showed 
up. The album was recorded in Canada 
and the band looks very streetwise in the 
album shots so it looked like we were 
dealing with a bunch of Canadian hit men 
or the Italian Doobie Brothers. 
However, th·e album got more than the usual once over, probably because it came in the same packet as Carole King's album and Joan Baez's newest release. For the sake of these two artists, it is safe to say they would not be embarrassed by the presence of the Tufano and Giammarese Band (TGB)--as a matter of fact, they might be quite pleased for this group offers a very listenable, pleasant brand of music. 
To answer the.obvious question of "Who are these guys?". the TGB is a five man band if you go by the album shot and a six man group if you read the credits. All discrepancies aside, they are led by lead guitarist and vocalist Carl Giammarese and Dennis Tufano, who also sings lead vocals in addition to playing guitar and key­boards. These two also write all of the groups original material. They co­authored every song on the album except for a pleasant redoing of J. Holvay's "Kind Of a Drag." 
Tufano and Giammarcse write songs that accent their vocal harmonies. The instrumentation is geared to compliment the vocals and act as tiller between the singing. It is never meant to be overhearing. However, Jack Richardson's production work is so llawless, that one linds himself (herself) admiring the overall sound of the songs instead of concentrating on one aspect. This tends to make each song flow into the next and seems to make the album's playing time fly by. This might be one reason why the production work can be called "too slick," for it seems concentrated on overall presentation in­stead of catering to the individual cuts. This concept is really quite welcome, for so many first albums are a collection of possible singles with garbage inbetween. 
This is not to say that there aren't any standout songs on the disc for the TGB offers quite a few different types of songs within their basic framework. The opening cut, "Let in the Light," starts with an Italian sounding guitar that provides a quick pace for. Tufano's throaty vocal. The song actually sounds a little schmaltzy when orchestration is added at the end. Regardless, the song starts the album off on an upbeat. 
"Heartbreak" sounds like its off the Doobie Brother album Stampede. Tufano plays a Billy Payne ragtime piano through­out and it blends perfectly with Giam­marese's background guitar solos to pro­duce a hard driving song. 
"Gone like the Wind" is the antithesis of "heartbreak". It is a regular old-fashioned 

love song with lyrics like: 

IT MAY BE A DAY IT MAY BE A YEAR BUT I KNOW THAT I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN 
Giammarese's lead singing and Tufano's harmony sound so sincere that the ortho­dox lyrics come to life and make you feel for the singer. This mood is helped and promoted by some very pretty synthesizer work which seems to underline the sincerity of the singers. Tufano and Marty Grebb combine on keyboards throughout the album and are more of a force than Giammarese's guitar. This makes sense because keyboards always seem to com­pliment vocals better than guitars. Since this is what the TGB is after, one can see 
gregg b. bangs 
why the guitar is not the main instrument 
in most songs. 

The two songs where the guitar is 
featured depend on it enormously. 
"Honest Man" is a common man's 
complaint against the rigors of society. 
Giammarese's cutting, blarin"g solos seem 
to represent the anger held against soc1ety. 
It is responsible for the bitter quality of the song. A completely different kind of solo predominates "Summer Night." The song is an· excellent dance song that is moved along by an Isaac Hayes guitar solo off of "Shaft." This mixes with an acoustic guitar and orchestration to produce what sounds like a lavishly produced disco sound. 
The only cut not written by T & G is "Kind of a Drag." The pace is slowed down, orchestration is added along with a very effective sax solo and Giammarese sings yet another emotional, but believable vocal. The song was once relegated to the classic pop list--this version makes it to the classy pop list. 
The best two songs are both on side two and they also happen to be the best produced. "Times Change" is once again based on the vocal harmonies of T & G which are, once again, excellent. However, the highlight of the song is the way the instrumentation is perfectly coordinated so all the parts compliment each other. Both an acoustic and electric guitar are featuredf and they mix perfectly with Grebb's sax solo and the congas of Darryl Wilson. This is all backed by orchestration and Tufano's synthesizer. Each is heard, but none takes away from the other. It is perfectly mixed. 
"Hypnotizen-love" is sung by a man who professes to be in a daze when he is not with his lover. Therefore, the lyrics sound somewhat at a distance except at the chorus which is clear because he sees his lover at that moment. An excellent guitar solo ensues because it intensifies the mood of the song by remaining distant a:1d removed. A variety of percussion instru­ments are used to also keep this mood: a sandpaper block gives the impression that someone is sleeping. Once again, fine arrangements make this song. 
Perhaps this group does have a few things going against it. It is very unknown and the lack of promo material sent along with the disc I isn't going to help any. Whatever, with a name like the Tufano & Giammarese Band and the brand of fine music they play, this group could become something. They deserve to.

I blurted out my thoughts feeling my face redden as I noticed some staring at me, others shifting on pillows, but it was soon over. I felt so relieved. But for all of my false starts and redness, I discovered that others had shared similar experi­ences--Jim, camping in the Rocky moun­tains, Cathy, walking back from the library 
'in the snow. I felt so relieved. I could talk to someone about God. Breaking down the barriers, looking into their eyes. 
Although we talked excitedly and got to know ourselves better, the aroma of melted cheese and ham submarines became too much too much and we went downstairs to share lunch together. There was much Polish joke bantering going around. I fell for the Polock of the Year award. a joke trick which didn't fool Father Gallen. It was great to be back together again and to share what other group's had discussed. 
The lightheartedness at lunch contrasted with the solemn private reflection which followed. Some played the guitar, others, like me, took a walk in the snow, hut all of us concentrated on a gospel passage from St. Mark, the one in which Jesus says "Con.1; after me; I will make you fishers ·of men. 
Once reunited we discussed what makes a Mass meaningful, joyful, one of celebra­tion. And with these thoughts in mind we created our own Mass. Father Gallen led us in a discussion of the gospel reading, we shared the sign of peace, and then hurried through the snow, carefully carrying the wine and protecting the loaf of bread, to the log chapel. Father Gallen. said the consecration and then he, who had been with us all day, eating, joking and discussing broke the bread and gave it to each one of us. We passed the cup around with those to whom we had confessed very intimate thoughts. We felt the warmth of the wine. We felt bonded together. We experienced the Eucharist together. We celebrated.

mendation: "We feel ·that the opportunity for this type of discus­sion at Notre Dame is far too limited. We would like to see .this experience offered on a large scale to those students who are interest­ed because this type of sharing of mutual problems and concerns will promote understanding and growth in areas where it has heretofore been seriously lacking." 
The program was thus expanded this year, explained Mary Claire McCabe. Director of Student Dev­elopment. Students Jack Kasel, Sue LeFevre and Chris Datzman revamped the format making the atmosphere less formal and the talk more spontaneous. 
·'The students do · not feel 
threatened by the authority of 
parents or faculty or by a situation

McCabe said. McCabe found a 
surprisingly large number of stu­
dents who never visit the people in 
town. 
''There is another side to the 
program which students and staff 
members aren't completely aware 
of. and that is the attitude of the 
couples. Many of them never get

Film critic evaluates '75 films  

by Barb Breitenstein Staff Reporter 

"Movies have gotten too effi­cient at getting big audiences," Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times film critic, said in an "informal" lecture last night. "They are making blockbusters and taking the action away from where it belongs in American films." 
Ebert. the first film critic to receive a Pulitzer Prize, spoke before a crowd of about 200 people in the library auditorium on "Ex­tremes in American Films: Jaws and Nashville," using the two film as a "starting point" for his critique of American film of 1975. 
"Nineteen Seventy-five was an indistinguished year for film," Ebert commented. "American movies are afraid to take a chance. Nashville was a movie that touched us, that was ambitious. It was the kind of movie you could be proud of. But Jaws was the movie everyone went to see instead of Nashville," Ebert said. 
The audience's laughter in re­
sponse to Ebert's many witty 
comments and stories drew more 
people into the audience as the talk 
progressed. 
Drawing a contrast between "art movies which enlarge our exper­ience" and "commerical movies which enhance our experience," Ebert commented on the direction of American films as "efficient money-making machines." 
"Nashville was an artistic ex­treme," he explained. "On the other had, Jaws was the mass communal experience of the cen­tury. It was so planned out that by the time the people went into the theatres, they were simply plugs. An art film tries to speak to us mbre personally." 
"It's all based on money rather than art now," Ebert continued, "because it's easier to see. In this country, it's the money and where it comes from that determines what will go before the public." 
Ebert commented on the current trent of "disaster movies," and

"Jaws was great trash and Nashville was great art,'' Ebert concluded, "and Americans have cast their vote. It was a very bad year for movies and yet more people went to see more movies in 1975 than in any year since TV was popularized. And what finally got them out of the house was trash." 
In a question and answer period which followed the lecture, Ebert commented on the role of the film critic, saying that critics do not want to influence people as much as "have a voice in the dialogue." "They want movies to get the audience they deserve." he said. 
Ebert also expanded on the lack of females in the movie-making business. "I don't know why we don't see better roles for women," he said. "The studios are all run by men and they just won't risk the money.''

Varsity Sports Summary 
Fencers extend streak 
bJ Paul Stevenson 
The Notre Dame fencing team, the 
number one rated team in the 
countrv. returned from Ohio St. 
thi~ ~·cckcnd after chalking up 
their sixteenth and seventeenth 
wins of the season. 
In their tirst contest, Notre Dame 
downed Ohio St. 18-9. The Irish 
fencers won foil and sabre 7-2, 
while bowing to their hosts S-4 in 
epee. 
After defeating Ohio St., the 
Irish then out-dualed Michigan St. 
21-6. winning sabre (8-1). foil (7-2) 
and epee (6-3). 
Coach Mike DeCicco was ex­tremely happy with his team's performance. "Ohio St. has been a snake pit in recent years for us," DeCicco remarked. "I can recall twice in the last five years whep they've .. spoiled our undefeated season. 
Individual stand-outs were Mike McCahcy and Pat Gerard who were both 4-0 for the weekend with the foil, Sam Ditiglio and Mike Sullivan who were S-0 with the sabre, and Tim Glass who was 4-0 with the epee. Sullivan's five wins over the weekend upped his season's record to 38-1. as he continues to 'lead the unbeaten Irish. 
DeCicco believes his team is fencing exceptionally well. "We have leadership and depth in every position." he stated, "To my knowledge of Notre Dame fencers, which dates back to 1945, we have never had nine starters that were so productive and consistent." 
The Irish are now 17-0 and have accumulated 35 straight victories. With just over one month until the NCAA tournament. DeCicco is confident in his team's ability to cap1 urc their tirst undefeated sea­son since 1967. 

This weekend the Irish take on 
the University of Wisconsin and the 
University of Illinois at home. 
The matches will 
be held in the auxiliary gym of the 
ACC beginning at 9 a,m. The 
contest is open to the public free of 
charge.

end as they dropped two meets to 
Illinois State and Purdue by scores 
of 70-43 and 72-51, respectivey. 
The tankers will close out their dual 
meet season at the Rockne Memor­
ial on Friday when they host 
Bradley at 7:00p.m. 

On Friday the Irish .received fine 
performances from Bob Ebel and 
Mark Foster in the diving as well as 
a first place in the SO-yard free­
style. 

·Ed Fitzsimmons continued his 
fine swimming as he captured two 
first in another losing effort, Sat­
urday, this time adding the tOO­
yard freestyle to his list of firsts. 
Freshman Paul Hesse also starred 
as he won the 200-yard breast­
stroke with a time of 2:24.0. 

Friday's meet will begin at 7:00 
p.m. with admission free and open to the public. 
Wrestlers bow 

The Notre Dame matmen of Coach Ray Sepeta closed their dual meet season last week with a disappointing 24-11 defeat at the hands of reigning National Catholic Champion John Carroll University. The loss dropped the Irish,' s record to a dismal 5-16. the ,gteatest 
number of dual meet defeats in 
Irish wrestling history. 
But, with a strong >howing in 
the National Catholic Champion­
ships three weeks ago. several Irish 
wrestlers arc looking toward the 
upcoming regionals with confiden­
ce. NCAA qualifier of a year ago, 
Pat McKillcn. leads the Notre 
Dame contingent to Cleveland 
State for the regionals to be held 
Friday, February 27th. McKillen 
carries a 16-3-2 slate with him to 
the tournament. 
Bob Golic, National Catholic 
Champ at heavyweight, will take a 
12-0-1 to the regionals in his quest 
to make it to the Nationals in his 
first try. 
After the regionals at Cleveland 
State, there will be a two-week rest 
for the qualifiers, as the Nationals, 
held at the University of Arizona 
will begin March I ith and last 
through to the 13th. 
Tracksters 12th 
The Notre Dame track team 
placed 12th out of a field of 18 of 
the strongest teams in the country in tll<" Central Collegiate Confer­ence Championships held at East­ern Michigan this past weekend. ·Pre: meet favorite Michigan took team honors followed bv Penn 
State in second place. ­
For the second week in a row, an· outstanding performance from freshman ru··ncr Jay Miranda highlighted the showing by Irish thinclads. Miranda covered the 1,000 yard run in a time of 2:11.3 to finish third behind winner Andy Johnson of Michigan who estab­lished a meet record of 2:08.5 in the process. Other notable performan­ces for the Irish were turned in by Jim O'Brien who placed sixthin the 600 in a time of I: 12.9 while Bill Allmendinger ran the 880 in 1:54.9 to come in fifth. 
The Interhall Basketball regular season comes to an end this week with many teams jockeying for a playoff spot in Division I and Division II play. 
DIVISION I 
Fisher I defeated Howard I 66-57 
to extend their undefeated streak to 
seven games and clinch a playoff 
spot in League I. Tim Spangler. 
Luther Bradley and Jerome heav­
ens scored 17. 14 and 14 points 
respectively to lead the way for 
Fisher. Bill Guappone poured in 17 
points for the losers. 
Morrissey I clinched their playoff 
spot by downing Grace I. That 
upped their record to 7 -I giving 
them sole possession of second 
place one half a game behind the 
league leader. Dillon II owns the 
third playoff spot. They remained 
6-2 on the season as they didn't see 
action this week. Alumni I, with a 
5-3 record, is in the best shape of 
the remaining teams that ate 
competing for the fourth playoff 
spot. A win over Holy Cross this 
week will sew it up for them. 
Off-Campus III continued to 
dominate League II as they turned 
back Zahm 163-54. O.C., III held a 
slim 35-33 halftime lead but blew it 
open in the third quarter. Team 
high scorer, Tom Monaghan, led 
the way with 21 points a piece. 
Mark Meyer took game scoring 
honors with 23 points in a losing 
cause. O.C., III is now 8-0 and is 
the only team in League II that has 
clinched a playoff spot. 
Keenan I. St. Ed· s I and Grace II 
are all 6-2 and arc vying for the 
three reamining playoff spots. 
Keenan I romped over Flanner II 
62-31 behind a stellar performance 
from Jay Ball (23 points). St. Ed's I 
also won easily over Pangborn I by 
a score of 48-33. Dave Schlichting 
and John Dziminski led the way 
with 17 and 14 points respectively. Grace II stayed at the top by trouncing Morrissey II by a score of 82-60. Randy Harrison played brilliantly, scoring 25 points, while 
Jim Weiler scored 20 points in a 
losing cause. Dillon II had to hold 
off a late fourth quarter surge by 
Stanford I to hold onto their 46-45 
win. Keenan I and St. Ed's I meet 
in an all important game this week. 
Flanner Ill made it eight in a row 
by trouncing Off-Campus IV by a 
score of 52-41. This earned them 
the first playoff spot in League III. 
Steve Dover scored 17 points and 
Mike Schuff added 14 points for the 
winners. The loss for O.C. IV 
virtually eliminates their chance for 
a playoff spot. 

Dillon II scored the only major upset of the week by rolling over previously unbeaten Cavanaugh I. Ed Condon led the way with 18 points while Pat Kennedy took game honors with 23 points for Cavanaugh I. Both teams now own a playoff spot. Sorin I must defeat Dillon Ill this week to take the remaining spot. Otherwise off­Campus VI and Grace III have the outisde shot. 
DIVISION II 

There were no games played in League IV this week. Alumni II (9-0) owns the first playoff spot. Off-Campus VI and Flanner IV are both 7-2 and claim the second and third spots. Keenan III is one game back at·6-3 and is presently in the best shape for the remaining _playoff spot. but they must go up against Flanncr \V this week. This gives Sorin I an outside shot at the playoff birth. 
Cavanaugh I and Pangborn II both remained tied for tirst place in League V with 8-1 records as neither team saw action this week. They're both assured of a playoff spot. Grace V is 7-2 and a game ahead of the rest of the team in League V. but they must face Cavanaugh I later this week. Off-Campus VII and Stanford III are both 6-3 and are competing for the last playoff birth. Stanford will determine its own fate when they go up against Flanner V while O.C. VII will sti back and wait for the results.
