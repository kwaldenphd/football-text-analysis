Construction starts on water system 
Students respond to flood 
Volunteers sought to clean local Food Bank 
By EMMA DRISCOLL 
News Writer 
After a Feb. 14 pipe break at the Food Bank of Northern Indiana damaged 15,000 pounds of food, Notre Dame students have responded -or are planning to respond -to the request for volunteers to help salvage what's left. 
The pipe break occurred in the corner of an unheated room on the northwest side of the second floor of the Food Bank's warehouse, said Dennis Brown, the executive director of the Food Bank. 
When a Notre Dame student heard about the flooding, he encouraged students to help. 
Senior Ryan Daily, the com­munity volunteer request coor­dinator for Notre Dame's Center for Social Concerns sent out a notice to "hopefully every dorm service commissioner" last week so they could inform their residents about the situa­tion and see if anybody would want to help out. 
Daily felt that if students received the request from their dorm service commissioners, they would be inclined to vol­unteer. 
"I presume students have helped out. and if not, they will be helping soon," he said. 
Daily was right, as Welsh Family resident assistant Shelly Heger heard about the pipe break and the need for volun­teers from her service commis­

PEPYND fundraises for school 
Group to hold dinner for Cambodia effort 
By ROHAN ANAND News Writer 
A group within the Student International Business Council (SIBC) hopes to raise $1,000 at a fundraising din­ner tonight to help a not-for­profit organization build a school in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. 
Notre Dame Class of 2002 alumna Daniela Papi helped found Protect the Earth Protect Yourself (PEPY) Ride, an organization that supports education projects in develop­ing areas and encourages adventure travel. Senior Tim Rann met Papi while he was volunteering in Cambodia two summers ago, and he decided to establisb a PEPY chapter at Notre Dame within the SIBC. 
"Our Notre Dame chapter helps PEPY by providing busi­ness consulting, financial statements and ideas on how to improve their operations," Rann said. 
PEPYND held a fundraising dinner in December and raised nearly $850 to fund this new project. Since then, the organization has increased that figure to approximately $19,000. Rann said he hopes to raise roughly $1,000 more during tonight's dinner to reach their goal. 
"We're grateful for the very generous donors who have come forth helping us raise the money for this project," Rann said. "Now, we're rely-. ing on the students to help us

Construction began Monday on the chilled water system between the Morris Inn and the former Notre Dame Post Office in prepa­ration for the construction of the new Law School this summer, said University Utilities Director Paul Kempf. 
Preliminary utility work is "typically required" before actual construction on a project begins, Kempf said in an e-mail Monday. In this case, the work is necessary because the chilled water system for the area sur­rounding the Law School conflicts with the planned 
construction and must be relocated. 
"Further utility construc­tion work will likely also occur prior to the start of the building construction later this year," he said. 
The system, which. oper­ates primarily from April until November, is responsi­ble for delivering chilled water from the centraUoca­tion at the Utilities Complex to specific points on cam­pus, Kempf said. Because the Law School construction is scheduled to begin in the summer -when the chilled water system is needed ­the system must be relocat­ed prior to the start of the season.

The Coca-Cola Foundation recently awarded Notre Dame a $290,000 grant to support two distinguished programs at the Kellogg Institute for International Studies, the University announced Monday. 
The funds will go toward the Notre Dame Prize for Distinguished Public Service in Latin America and will expand the Kellogg Institute Internship Program, which will benefit 20 students during the next two summers. 
The Coca-Cola Foundation -which has given more than $155 mil­lion to educational issues 
over the last 10 years ­focuses on improving quali­ty of life in different com­munities and enhancing individual opportunity through education. 
"Our programs support scholarships for aspiring students; encourage and motivate young people to stay in school; and foster cultural understanding," according to the Coca-Cola Foundation Web site. 
Nearly $180,000 of the grant will go toward the Notre Dame Prize, which is awarded to some of the leading political, civil and religious figures in Latin America. The money will provide three years of sup­port for the prize, accord­ing to a press release. 
The Notre Dame Prize for Disting.uished Public Service in Latin America was established in 2000 and is given annually to an individual from that region who has effectively and substantively furthered the public good in one or more countries of the region. The award focuses on an indi­vidual's accomplishments in areas like government, religion, .education and media. 
"[The Notre Dame Prize] is the only award of its kind to recognize the efforts of public figures to enhance the region's wel­fare by strengthening democracy and improving the well being of its citi­zens," the press release·

Survivor already? 
I lost my ID card thi'l weekend. The impact ofthis loss didn't quite hit me until dinnertime, when, realizing I only had 61 cents in cash, I took out a package of my room's seemingly endless pile ofCup of Noodles and put some water on to Jennifer Metz boil. Our water heater might be ille­

times call for desper­ate measures. 
Editor 
While stressing out, I did what I do best-put in a DVD box set and sit and watch. For hours. Inspired by their second turn on The Amazing Hace, I recently pur­chased the eighth season of Survivor to pay tribute.to my favorite couple, possibly ever -Boston Rob and Amber. 
(You can request online that they come to events. Whoever it is that organizes big events here, I'm just putting it out there. I'm sure they're not that expensive. I'd go.) 
My ridiculous collection of box sets, in retrospect, is probably the reason for my untimely shortage of funds. 
For one day, at least, I am playing my own version of the show-Survivor 25: Indiana. I can boil water. I rely on my Cup of Noodles for sustenance. I make alliances with my fellow "tribemates" to gain access to their valuable FlexPoints. 
Rewards won today: a coffee at Starbucks, three yogurt-covered pretzels and a water bottle. Challenge lost: my fight with the card swiper at the Hock who ju'lt couldn't believe I was a Notre Dame stu­dent on my way to volleyball class. 
Honestly, who would lie to go to volley­ball class? 
I watched my Survivor while I wa'l study­ing for an anthropoioh'Y test. It was appro­priate, I thought, since I saw the castaways make tools, create .culture and find their niche in the group. 
I also watched my Survivor when I wa'l hungry because I knew, luckily, I wasn't as hungry a'l them. 
But was I really luckier? In my box-set season, the Survivor cast members get to live with Rob and hear that lovely accent every day. And they participate in what might possibly be one ofthe most fun and challenging experiences ever. 
Which brings me to a recent addition to my life goal list: to win Survivor. 
I shouldn't really have a problem achiev­ing this goal, I don't think. I swam in high school, and on every season except Africa, most challenges involved some form of swimming. I'm very good atjigsaw puzzles and the Jumble. I can cook a Cup of Noodles. That's instant-so is rice, right? All of these skills make me worthy ofthe game to which I have, in effect, devoted seven years of my life. 
Is that pathetic? 
The UPS delivery man who brought me Survivor All-Stars thought so. When I leapt from my loft, thrilled to hear, "Barnes and Noble for Jenn Metz," he was curious as to what wa'l in my package. When I told him, his face showed that he didn't expect me to order something like this. 
He didn't understand how I could watch a reality show, let alone re-watch a reality · show. I think he threw some air quotes around the word "reality" a few times. 
But my stress-induced box-set watching has its purpose. I have so many strategies in the works that I have the potential to be the best survivor ever. I'll learn how to make fire with sticks before I go to the island. I'll work out. 
And when pretty boy Probst calls my name, I'll be ready.

Boutique receives 20 pounds of marijuana 
PIIILADELPHIA Workers at a downtown boutique called police after unexpectedly receiving two buckets of marijuana worth $90,000. Police were called to Fusion on Saturday after employees received the two packages of marijuana totaling about 20 pounds. 
"Officers received a call that the manager of the store had received a pack­age from FedEx and when he opened it there was a five-gallon bucket inside," said Capt. Chris Werner. Inside that bucket was 1 0 pounds of marijuana. The second package arrived 
about an hour later, this one from a diiTerent deliv­ery service but with similar contents. 
Both paekages were from California and addressed to the store, but there were no names on the address labels. 
"It was obviously intend­ed for someone in the Philadelphia area," Werner said. "We are trying to find out who." 
Dog saves man from bear 
CATAHACT, Wis. -Jason Schindler says he wouldn't be alive if it were not for his dog, Dude. The 27-year-old rural Cataraet man said the 8-year-old mixed-breed hound jumped between him and an attacking black bear Thursday night, saving his life but giving up his own. The animal sustained at least 28 puncture wounds to his ehest and neck, he said. 
"I'd hate for someone else's dog to go through what mine did," he said. 
Schindler and his wife, Kimberly, buried the dog with a blanket and pillow the next day, using a rented jackhammer to dig the grave in the frozen soil. 
lie said he heard the dog yelping loudly Thursday after dark and went out to see what was happening.

Cambodia is a country with a high population of impover­ished and uneducated chil­dren. Seventy-five percent of them do not complete school beyond fifth grade. But through fundraising and vol­unteering initiatives, PEPYND has already helped build one school for children in Siem Reap, about 40 minutes out­side Phnom Penh.

Cambodia dur­"!have huge ing spring expectations for the

ond school -as

well as to inter­act with Cambodian chil­Sahil Rajvansh dren. When he freshman 
first marketed the idea back at December's dinner, Rann said he received 30 signatures from interested students. 
"We got the process rolling back in January and we've helped build an itinerary leav­ing on Friday, the ninth of March and returning the fol­lowing Sunday," he said. "For the most part, we'll be split­ting time between Phnom Penh and Siem Ram, the loca­tion of the first school." 
Each volunteer will be spending approximately $850 in airfare to travel to Cambodia, plus an additional $300 for their personal expenses during their stay. Although this may seem a lit-· tie steep -especially in lieu of pursuing a vacation back at home or at a popular beach destination -the volunteers are nonetheless excited to go. Freshman Sahil Hajvansh said the trip will be expensive, but is for a good cause. 
"I have huge expectations for the trip', and I'm looking forward to working with the kids," Rajvansh said. "It's also incredible that Tim's done everything from scratch, and so I know we'll be able to work together comfortably." 
Rajvansh, who is from New Delhi, India, said he has seen the poverty and orphans that exist in his native country. Still, he thinks that it will be interesting to compare the sit­uation he's seen in India to what he will experience in 
Cambodia. 
"I want to see if the conditions vary in attitude and intensity in Cambodia," he said. "Even though I live in an exotic country, I think that visit­ing Cambodia will be just as cultur­ally interesting." 
One of the major projects 
that the volunteers will tackle includes taking 40-50 of the children to see Angkor Wat, a pristine Buddhist temple con­sidered to be one of the Seven Wonders of the World. 
"It's a symbol or pride for Cambodia," senior volunteer Alex Harty said. "It's sad that these children are so close to it, but cannot afford the jour­ney to visit it. I'm glad that we're going to help them see something that will teach them more about their cul­ture." 
The dinner will be held in the Sorin Room in LaFortune from 6-8 p.m. tonight. A $5 donation is suggested.

said. 
The award carries a cash prize of $10,000, with an equal sum to be given to a Latin American charitable organization chosen by the recipient. 
The inaugural award was given in 2000 to Enrique V. Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development Bank. Other recipients include former Chilean President Patricio Ay Iwin Az6car, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Latin American Cardinal Oscar Andres Hodrfguez Maradiaga. 
The remaining $110,000 of the grant will go toward supporting 20 students par­ticipating in the Kellogg Institute's international internship program for the next two summers. 
The Institute's internship program gives "undergradu­ates opportunities to gain hands-on experienee with international poliey insti­tutes, non-governmental 
organizations and busi­
nesses, including micro-finance groups in Uganda, 
U.S. embassies in Argentina and Chile, small farming operations in Mexico, and healtheare faeilities in the Dominican Republic," the press release said. 
Though the program already sends students to dif'f'erent loeations in Asia and Africa, the grant will help to expand the pro­grams on those continents.

T h e K e II o g g I n s t i t u t'e focuses its academic and research activities around the themes of democratiza­tion and the quality of dflmocraey, growth and democracy, public policies for soeial justice, religion and soeiety, and social movements and organized eivil soeiety. 
The internships share these same goals, as senior Claire McArdle said about her 2006 summer internship with the Minnesota Advocates for Human Hights. 
"We didn't necessarily work on issues of democrati­zation or religion specifical­
ly, but we focused more on social justiee issues, specifi­cally for refugees and immi­grants from other coun­tries," McArdle said. "They sought political asylum because of issues with lack of democracy or religious persecution so that conneet­ed back very well to the goals of the Kellogg Institute." 
McArdle said the Kellogg Institute gave her a grant that was deposited directly into her Notre Dame Federal Credit Union account and left her in eharge of lodging, transportation, food and any other costs for her summer. 
The internship, MeArdle said, gave her insight into what she wants to do in the future working in immigra­tion services. 
"Especially with all the emphasis that the University is putting on international issues and original research, this type of grant is very beneficial to the University as a whole, to the Kellogg and the undergraduate stu­dent body," McArdle said.

Iran's Ahmadinejad faces criticism 
TEHRAN, Iran -President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad faced a new round of sharp criticism at home Monday after he said Iran's nuclear program is an unstoppable train without brakes. Reformers and con­servatives said such tough talk only inflames the West as it considers further sanctions. 
The criticism came even as new signs have arisen that Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is growing discon­tented with Ahmadinejad, whom he is believed to have supported in 2005 presi­dential elections. 
Last week, Khamenei voiced rare criti­cism of the domestic performance of Ahmadinejad's government, and the presi­dent was notably absent when a group of Cabinet members and vice presidents met with Khamenei, who has the final word in all political affairs in Iran, including the nuclear issue. 
NATO takes over Afghan security 
CONAKRY, Guinea -Guinea's president named a new prime minister Monday from a list approved by union leaders, replacing an ally whose appointment sparked protests that have killed scores of people in recent weeks. 
In a decree read on state radio, President Lansana Conte appointed Lansana Kouyate as prime minister. Kouyate, who has worked for several international groups serving West Africa, takes over from Eugene Camara, a longtime Cabinet member whose appoint­ment angered the unions, which said it vio­lated a power-sharing deal. 
Scores died in clashes with security forces and subsequent rioting after Caniara was appointed earlier this month.Unions restart­ed a nationwide strike in protest and called for Conte to step down.

Governors address global warming 
WASIIINGTON -Fed up with federal inac­tion and convinced of the dangers from glob­al warming, five governors from Western states agreed Monday to work together to reduce greenhouse gases. 
Their promise to target global warming was the latest of a rush of new ideas shared this week as states push ahead on climate change and clean or alternative energy. 
"Thankfully the country has reached a tip­ping point on this issue. I wish we had done it 20 years ago," said Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican who last week signed into law a requirement that utilities generate a quarter of their power from renewable sources such as wind, water and the sun by 2025. "Governors, members of Congress and others are now scrambling to be bold." 
Judge dismisses Libby trial juror 
WASHINGTON -After the judge dis­missed one of its members, the jury finished a fourth day of deliberations Monday with­out a verdict in the perjury trial of former White House aide I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby. 
Most of the morning was consumed by deciding what to do about an art historian on the jury who saw or read something over the weekend about the trial. After inter­viewing her in private along with lawyers in the case, U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton ruled that "what she had exposure to obviously disqualifies her."

Shiite leader escapes explosion 
Vice President Adel Abdul-Mahidi survives assassination attempt in Baghdad

BAGHDAD -Iraq's Shiite  vice president narrowly escaped assassination Monday as a blast ripped through a government meeting hall just hours after it was searched by

"I think it's really cool that the service commissioners brought it to our attention," Heger said. 
An article from the South Bend Tribune about the pipe break was attached to the e­mail from her service commis­sioner, which inspired Heger to want to help. 
"I read the article from the South Bend Tribune and it seemed like such a horrible thing that happened to them," she said. "They lost a significant amount, maybe a 'majority, of food that they had available ... We have time and we are able, so why not?" 
Since people depend on the canned goods stored by the food bank for their daily food vacs and had eight men work­ing for eight or nine hours straight pulling water off the floor," Brown said. "Then we had volunteer crews, service workers and staff trying to res­cue as much food as we could." 

One of the difficulties caused by the water damage was that wet can labels were no longer legible and it was impossible to tell what the original contents were. The food bank had to get rid of these cans, along with the paper goods supply, Brown said. 
Beside the food supply, the food bank will need to replace the furnace in the corner where the break occurred. A supply vent and insulation will also be needed, Brown said.

The pipe burst occurred when cold from a fresh air vent made the cast iron clamp that holds three pipes together to clamp. Due to the water pressure in the pipes, water immediately escaped and "there was a tor­rential downpour." 
"We had water coming down the walls, through the ceilings and down the stairs from that corner area and we ended up with about three inches of water in a 40,000 square foot area [where food was kept]," Brown said. 
Since the lower level of the warehouse is about 82,000 square feet, Brown said the water affected close to half the warehouse. Although the fire alarm sounded, Brown said "by the time they were able to turn off the water to the building, the damage had been done."

Volunteer Coordinator for the Food Bank Beth Graham said while she has had "a lot of offers [of assistance! from Notre Dame students," she has not scheduled all of them yet because it can be difficult to train new people under such circumstances. 
"Sometimes it's almost over­whelming because we're kind of restricted in some ways on the hours we can have volunteers. ... It can be kind of hard to manage a lot of different people and we have to teach every new person [what to look for]," she said. 
Graham also said the Notre Dame students who have already helped with the damage are either regular volunteers or are completing community service hours.

IN BRIEF 


Large deal brings hope to Wall Street 
NEW YORK-Wall Street extended its decline Monday as concerns about a market correction offset investor optimism that acquisition activity is on pace to set a record this year. 
The $45 billion buyout of electric utility TXU Corp. injected confidence into the market that merger and acquisition activity could surpass last year's record $4 trillion level. The deal, led by a COIL'iortium of buyout shops that include Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Texas Pacific Group, would go down as the largest leveraged buyout in 
U.S. history. 
Other deals included Station Casinos Inc., which agreed to be bought by a private equity firm start­ed by the company's founding family. Temple­Inland Inc., a conglomerate that offers everything from packaging material to financial services, announced it plans to separate itself into three standalone public companies. 

Engraver sentenced to federal prison 
WASHINGTON -A former Treasury Department employee was sentenced to nine months in federal prison Monday for steal­ing more than $67,000 in uncut sheets of $1 00 bills that he tried to launder through casino slot machines. 
David C. Faison, 56, was also ordered to pay back the government $37,200-the amount he fed to slot machines in Atlantic City, West Virginia and Delaware between May and August last year. 
The rest of the money -nine sheets of partially printed $100 bills-was recovered at Faison's house in Largo, Md., hidden inside a roll of Christmas wrapping paper. 
Faison was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman less than a year after he admitted to the scheme and pleaded guilty on Sept. 6 to federal charges of mate­rial for counterfeiting purposes. Additionally, he will be put on supervised release for three years after serving his prison term. 
Faison had worked as a stock control recorder, distributing currency paper within the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, when he stole 21 sheets of partially printed $100 bills. Each sheet contained 32 bills, which were missing serial numbers and Treasury Department seals.comment. 


WellPoint announces new CEO

Angela Braly, who joined the nation's largest health insurer executive ranks two years ago, will take the CEO post on June 1 while Glasscock stays on as chairman of the board. 
Glasscock, 58, is also stepping down as president and Braly will assume that post as well. 
Glasscock cited family reasons for his retirement as president and CEO and did not elaborate during a morning conference call with analysts. But he did say the Indianapolis-based company considered "a very wide range of possible succession options and sce­narios" before choosing Braly.

As a columnist for The Observer, I have to try and come up with something inter­esting to write about every two weeks, and I've had many conversations with other columnists about the dilliculty of !in ding topics which you, the reader, would be inter­ested in. This is a tough problem, and my approach is to read the letters you send to the editor, take the issue and put forth my view on the matter in a rea­soned and respectful way. This approach, however, requires me to read Viewpoint almost every day, and in the course of doing so I see that very few of the debatns in this section end with compromisn. Most of the time, the rhetoric only gnL'i worse and both sides fmd as sharply divided as they were when the discussion began. 
American society in this respeet is not far removed from the Notrn Damn com­munity. In our society there are many issues on which both sides hold nearly irreconeilable differences. I highly doubt that we will nver reach a societal conson­sus on drug policy, the role of religion in public life or abortion. Positions on these issues depend on foundational principles, and as such, are not easily changnd. 
Different areas of the eountry hold vary­ing predominant foundational prineiplns, and debates on controversial issues often begin when communities enaet laws based on these prineiples. Soon afterwards, the actors involved in the debate turn to the national stage where they seek to see their policy enacted at the federal level. In 1973, abortion supportnrs were able to force the legalization of abortion on the entire country, induding communities which were fiercely against the practice. Though abortion was a state issue before

Hoe v. Wade, the pro-life movement focused on winning national victories to limit or eliminate the practiee. Because of the initial nationalization of the issue in 1973, members of both sides of the debate not only seek to advance their cause in states that support their stanee, but seek to enact their policy in states that do not. 
The drive to resolve most, if not all, issues at the fi)derallevel threatens to standardize /\rnnrican politics and culture in thn same way that McDonald's has stan­dardized fiH>d and Wal-Mart has standard­iznd retail shopping. Though I strongly believll that my dassiealliberal and Christian principles arc true, I would rather win or losn debates in the several states than in one centralized federal leg­islature. People bnlieve difl'enmt things in difl'ernnt areas, and the current trend towards nationalization unneenssarily raisns the stakes and thus adds to the growing sense of polarization in our nation. 
Our economy is increasingly national­ized and globaliznd, and li>r the most part, inereased trade has provided Amerieans and pnopln around the world with higher wages. greatnr access to goods and a lower eost of living. Unli>rtunatnly, the widening scope of our economy has allownd a "winner-takes-all" homogeniz­ing eonsumnr culture to emerge in tho 
U.S. Our greatnr mobility and access to goods has bmwlited us m:onomieally, but it also threatens to destroy the values, local sentirmmts and cultures that help us to define our lives. 
II' we are to onjoy the fruits of globaliza­tion and a groatly expanded economy, we also need to take deliberatl) efli>rL'i to pre­serve local culture and our sense of identi­ty. According to Tom friedman, the author of "The Lexus and the Olive Tree," "Evon if we can get the right polities ... fi>r sustain­able globalization, there is another, less tanhrihle set of polieies that nm~ds to be kept in mind -the need for community, for spiritual meaning and for values which with to raise our children." Even if people in California drive Volvos, play Japanese computer games and wear clothes pro­duced in China, they need to know what they believe and what makes them differ­ent from Chinese, lloosiers and Texans. 
The beauty of our federalist system is that it allows for the preservation oflocal culture while providing the economic and security benefiL'i of a larger government. Alexis de Tocqueville wrote, "No one can be more indined than I am to appreciate the advantages of the federal system, whieh I hold to be one of the combinations most favorable to the prosperity and free­dom of man." Our federal system is one of our greatest asseL'i, and it is wPII-suited to take on our age's great challenge of pro­teeting local identity and culture. 
I don't think it would be a surprise to anyone if I said that the peoph~ of Calililfnia and Indiana had divergent views on marijuana, the role of religion in public lifiJ and abortion. Instead of trying to make the whole country likn Indiana or Caliii>rnia (depending on your foundation­al bnliefs) citizens of each statn should be able to legislate on these controversial issues as they see fit. We need to work to presnrve both the values and 1:ultural praetices that give our lives meaning. By unleashing the power of federalism, we can do that in a way that reduces contro­versy and increases community autonomy. Let California be California, and let Indiana be Indiana.

The new residency requirement for Saint Mary's students that was decided upon without diverse input from stu­dents and faculty will be disastrous to the future of the college. President Carol Ann Mooney has said that the college is currently facing an enroll­ment crisis and has set the goal to increase enrollment by 15 percent with the Class of 2011. Unfortunately, I strongly believe this new residency requirement will drop the number of applicants to an all-time low. Had stu­dent input been gathered on this issue, such a decision would have never been made. 
Karen Johnson, vice president of stu­dent affairs at the College, said that 

current students were not consulted because the requirement would not affect them. Current students should have been asked for advice because current students are the most knowl­edgeable about the wants and needs of prospective students having been there just months ago. 
When high school seniors are making a college decision, they look at a num­ber of factors, with student life being of great importance. When students enroll at Saint Mary's and see that dorm living is the norm for three years, many choose to follow this path of on campus residency. However, without this knowl­edge of the norm, high school seniors will not choose a campus that requires them to stay on campus for three years over a college that does not. 
The trend among American college students is to move off campus and Saint Mary's should not go against this.· More students want to live off campus than on campus and if a college denies students of this right, prospective stu­dents will seek an education elsewhere. Applicants to Saint Mary's will drop with the consequence of an even fur­ther decline in enrollment. Furthermore, this is creating an identi­ty for the college that is similar to a girls' boarding school, not an open­minded, progressive women's college. 
Johnson stated the single positive attribute of the requirement when she 
said, "Students who live on campus have been shown to be more successful -both academically and co-curricu­lary." However, it should be up to the students and their parents -not administrators -to decide whether or not they should stay on campus for per­sonal development. I would encourage administrators to reconsider how prospective students will perceive this residency requirement before there aren't any students to fill the residence halls at all.

Eucharist com_ic not inappropriate 
Paper should uphold 'free trade of ideas' 
Erik Bootsma, I, for one, hope you are the only student in this fme institution who took offense at the cartoon published in this paper making light of the Eucharist. You argue that while we can debate the presence of God in the Eucharist, "all of [the institution's] organs should point to the truth" and that the Eucharist is not "an acceptable form of ridicule," ("Eucharist comic was blasphe­mous," Feb. 26). 
I'm not going to quote Bible verses back at you, but do you really think that The Observer should censor its content from a religious point of view? Notre Dame, as you may have noticed, isn't a hotbed ofdiversity, especially when it comes to religious views. I can't imag­ine this image would be improved by quash­ing satire that pokes fun at the Catholic faith. One day, you may have to accept that not only does everyone not share your views, many of us don't want your views being forced upon us, even though we attend a Catholic universi­ty. 

To quote Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, "But when men have real­ized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own con­duct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas -that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the mar­ket, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out."

Cartoon funny, not improper 
I do not understand why people are offended by comics. Comics are meant to be a quick chuckle in between hours of work. 
In responses to Michele E. Sagala ("Cartoon crossed the line," Feb. 26), "making fun of the Institution of the Eucharist, especially in this season of Lent" is funny. I laughed. I also feel that God has a sense of humor and is secure enough to take a joke. 
In response to Erik Bootsma ("Eucharist comic was blasphe­mous," Feb. 26), please turn and look at the top of the front page of your Observer, where it says "The Independent Newspaper SerVin-g Notre Dame and Saint Mary's." 
Perhaps you should look at the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: "Congress shall make no law ... prohibiting the free exer­cise thereof; or abridging the free­dom of speech, or of the press." I think the comic is pointing to another truth, that people like to laugh. I have found far more truth in Carlos Mencia, Dane Cook and Jerry Seinfeld than in Catechism 2148. 
I pose this question -can you really respect someone you cannot joke with and make a joke about?

2007 0SCARS IN REVIEW 

Latest Oscars shines with flair and fashion 

Director Martin Scorsese, second from left, finally receive~ his Oscar in the com­pany of fellow greats Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. 
By ANALISE LIPARI 
Assistant Scene Editor 
The 2007 Academy Awards brought nearly one billion viewers more than the usual amount of surprises and whimsy this Sunday night. Complete with interpretive dancers, a sound effect chorale and newbie host (and goofball extraordin aire) EII en DeGeneres, this year's quirky Oscars felt surprisingly fresh and more than a little entertaining. With its fair share of glamorous fashion and several unpre­dicted upsets -especially that of perennial "bridesmaid-but-never-a­bride" director Martin Scorsese -the 2007 Oscars shot a lively jolt of energy into the arm of the nearly 80-year-old broadcast. 
Red carpet arrivals were the talk of multiple channels during the hour and a half before the official broadcast began, with E! Entertainment, TV Guide and others dissecting and schmoozing with the Hollywood elite on what is often considered fashion's most widely­seen runway. Pop culture pundits like Joan Rivers and Ryan Seacrest

down the red carpet. 
Oscar fashion in 2007 saw an inter­esting mix of standards -legendary designers like Valentino and Armani justifiably remain widely worn on Hollywood's biggest night -and risk­takers, with fewer stars taking the safer route in their attire choices in favor of "fashion roads less worn" like feather­accented skirts and gold bodices. One such risk-taking star was "Dreamgirls" Supporting Actress winner and "American Idol" alum Jennifer Hudson, who paired a stunning Oscar de Ia Renta chocolate brown frock with what appeared to be a silver-plated jacket abandoned by an extra from "Barbarella." 
While some, like Hudson, may have had less success with risky fashion, oth­ers, such as respective· Supporting Actress and Best Actress nominees Cate Blanchett and Penelope Cruz, absolute­ly shone in their more unique choices. Cruz, for example, wore a flowing, fem­inine pink gown with enough yards of fluffy, feather-heavy skirt to clothe the entirety of Angelina .Jolie's growing international brood, but pulled off the potentially overwhelming Versace cre­ation with her typical ease. 

Other stars to note were Kate Winslet, in a very feminine celadon-colored, one-shoulder Valentino; "Babel" new­comer Rinko Kikuchi, who was sporting a form-fitting, black lace-laden Chane!; Gwyneth Paltrow in her pleated and peachy gown from hip newcomer Zac Posen; "Little Miss Sunshine" herself, fifth grader Abigail Breslin, in a sweet, pink fluff-fest of a dress; and Best Actress winner Helen Mirren, who left audiences pleasantly surprised with her gold-embroidered gown from classic designer Christian Lacroix that was anything but matronly. 
Once the broadcast got underway, it was first-time host Ellen DeGeneres who put her own unique spin on the often-stuffy awards ceremony, leading a sizeable gospel choir through the 
aisles of the Kodak 
Theater within the 
host the Oscars and 

her decision to, this year, celebrate the nominees rather than just the winners. A subsequent short film featured a series of endear­ingly awkward interviews with the 2007 band of nominees, summed up succinct­ly by Supporting Actor winner Alan Arkin's thoughts on winning and los­ing."Losing builds character," Arkin ~said with a smile. "Winning is easy. 
Anyone can win." 
The statement was ironic coming 
from Arkin, who won the Supporting 
Actor prize for "Little Miss Sunshine" 
over predicted favorite and Golden 
Globe winner Eddie Murphy. 
Arkin's win was one of several sur­
prises at this year's Oscars, with the 
seemingly heavily favored "Pan's 
Labyrinth" losing the Foreign-Language 
film award to "Das Leben Der 
Anderen," a critically-favored German film about the complexities of the East German Secret Police. Another such surprise was the environmentally-con­scious fable "Happy Feet," which won in the Animated Film category over Disney and Pixar's wildly popular 'Cars." In the seemingly innocuous Best Original Song category, AI Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth" found unexpected Oscar gold with an original Melissa Ethridge song, "I Need to Wake Up," over a record three tunes from the night's lone musical, "Dreamgirls," marking the first time in recent memo­ry that the Original Song winner came from a documentary film. 
Other 2007 winners came with far less surprise. Both Forest Whitaker ("The Last King of Scotland") and Mirren ("The Queen") had won an impressive series of critical prizes between them since award season began, and despite an impressive breadth of competitive talent in both categories, the two were rewarded a final Oscar cap to their respective growing lists of accolades. 
Sofia Coppola's controversial "Marie Antoinette" won the prize for Costume Design, hardly a surprise given the sheer volume of gowns worn by Kirsten Dunst in the film. Jennifer Hudson's win for Supporting Actress was also some­what expected, given her win for the role at the Golden Globes in January. 
The ultimate surprise, however, was that of Scorsese's Best Director win ­Scorsese, effectively the Susan Lucci of the Academy Awards since 1981's "Raging Bull," finally got his prize for his frenetic and fantastic Best Picture winner, "The Departed." Presented by a trio or venerable directing legends, George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola and Steven Spielberg, Scorsese's long­awaited trophy seemed nothing short of totally deserved. 
Other highlights of this year's Oscars included a hysterical song-and-dance number featuring Will Ferrell, Jack Black and John C. Reilly lamenting the fate of the oft-ignored comedian come Oscar season; the pairing of youngsters Abigail Breslin and .laden Christopher Syre Smith to present both short film awards; and "Little Miss Sunshine" stars Steve Carrell and Greg Kinnear's cheeky take on the importance of sound editing. 
Ultimately, the 2007 Oscars will be remembered as the year of Scorsese and "The Departed," of what DeGeneres called the "most internation­al" grouping of nominees the Oscars have ever had, and of an overall rejuve­nation of Hollywood's most storied night.

Associated Press 
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -Roger Federer struggled to a first-round victory at the Dubai Open on Monday, the day he broke Jimmy Connors' streak of "consecutive weeks at No. 1. 
Federer, who broke Connors' 30-year-old mark with his 161st week at the top of the ATP rankings, defeated Kristian Pless 7-6 (2), 3-6, 6-3 in his first match since taking a month off after winning the Australian Open. 
Federer's reign began more than three years ago, when he took over No. 1 on Feb. 2, 2004, after win· ning his second career Grand Slam title at the Australian Open. Federer said defeating Andy Roddick in the 2004 Wimbledon final was "a huge moment for me." 
"Looking back, maybe that was the most impor­tant match for staying at No. 1," the Swiss star said during a conference call. "If he would have won that, I think he might have gotten it back." 
Connors set his record from July 1974 to August 1977. Connors won eight Grand Slam titles in his 20-year career. . "I haven't heard any· thing from Jimmy," Federer said, laughing. "I 
IN BRIEF 
Islanders strengthen roster 
for playoff run 
NEW YORK -The New York Islanders bolstered their offense on Monday, acquiring winger Hichard Zednik from the Washington Capitals for a second-round draft pick in 2007. 
The Islanders entered Monday tied with Montreal for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East, although both teams were only six points behind third-place Ottawa. 
Zednik has six goals and 12 assists in 32 games for the Capitals this sea­son. He missed 31 games with wrist and groin injuries. 
"Richard is a proven offensive tal· ent," Islanders general manager Garth Snow said. "When you can add don't know if he's going to talk about it. It's a great record to break, he's had it so long." 
Connors now coaches Roddick, who won the first set against Federer in Shanghai in November and had three match points in the second set before falling 4-6, 7-6 (8), 6-4. 
"That actually guaran· teed me to break the record today," he said. 
Federer has another connection to Connors. 
When Federer was growing up in Switzerland, he was presented with a watch by Connors during a ceremony recognizing Federer as the best under· 14 player in Basel, his hometown. Federer had been a ballboy for an exhi· bition between Connors and Mansour Bahrami. 
"I walked on court, had a picture taken with both of them, and then walked off," Federer recalled. "I was so nervous. Whoever would have thought I would have broke the record? Looking back, it is quite an amazing story." 
To commemorate the milestone, a Roger Federer stamp will be issued April 10 in his hometown. 
Federer needed time to get up to speed against the 86th-ranked Pless, but extended his career-high winning streak to 37 matches. 
Bad~ers lose Butch in loss to Obio State 
MADISON -Wisconsin forward Brian Butch is expected to be out at least four weeks after dislocat­ing his right elbow in the Badgers' loss to Ohio State. 
The team's leading rebounder had a dislocation and an associated fracture, and his anticipated recov­ery time is four to six weeks, the team said Monday. 
The injury occurred when Butch crashed to the floor while battling under the basket in the first half of the Badgers' one-point loss Sunday to the Buckeyes in Columbus. He watched the second half from the bench with his arm in a sling. 
Boston's Matsuzaka faces 
Ortiz in Spring Training 
FORT MYERS -When Boston slugger David Ortiz stepped in against pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka on Monday, hundreds of spectators pressed up against the fence and dozens of cameras clicked to capture the moment. 
Ortiz, who led the AL in homers and RBis last season, is confident about one thing: ''I'm pretty sure he's going to do well." 
Ortiz faced 12 of the 54 pitches, all from the stretch, in Matsuzaka's sec­ond batting practice session of spring training. He let nine of them go by, fouled one into the batting cage, hit a grounder to first base

Fouls played an important role in the game. Two quick ' fouls on Allen limited her

"When your best scorer is on the bench, it makes it a little more difficult to get in a rhythm offensively," McGraw said. The game was physical. DePaul committed 12 fouls in the second half, while Notre 
Dame committed 10. 
"It wasn't any more physical than we expect­ed," McGraw said. 
Guard Tulyah Gaines left the game with a shoulder injury early in the sec­ond half, and Allen left later in the half with problem. 
"[Gaines] got hit with a really hard screen and she hurt her shoulder," McGraw said. 
Both Gaines and Allen returned later in the game.

Notre Dame kept the game close in the first half, leading by seven with 5:52 remaining. The Blue Demons went on an 11-3 run to take the lead 34-33 with 
an ankle 3:02 remaining in the half, led by 3-pointers from 
five points with 
15:37 remaining. The Irish would again pull to within five after Allen converted a layup, and then a jumper, with 12:57 left. At this point, Smith took over as the Blue Demons pulled away. 
The loss dropped Notre Dame to the No. 7 seed in the Big East tournament. The Irish will face No. 10 seed DePaul again Saturday at 6 
p.m. in the first round of the Big East tournament.

really fighting for." 
With a bye in the first round, the lrish will most likely face Syracuse, No. 20/21 Marquette or West Virginia in the second round depending on how the final week of the season plays out. 

Notre Dame defeated the Golden Eagles Saturday, the Mountaineers 61-58 Jan. 9 and the Orange 103-91 Jan. 30. 
That means if Notre Dame fin­ishes with the same record as any of the above teams, the Irish will get the higher seed. 
Marquette, West Virginia and Syracuse are within one game of each other in the standings, and any of them could end up in fifth place in the conference during the final week of play. 
Since the Big East tournament has 12 teams -with the top four getting a first-round bye ­the No. 5 team plays the No. 12 team in the first round. The win­ner of that game then plays the No. 4 seed in the seeond round. 
A<> of now, Syracuse would play St. John's in the first round, with the winner earning a date with the Irish. 
The Hed Storm defeated Notre Dame 71-68 Jan. 23 in New York. 
But Bn~y said there is one team in particular he does not want to face in Madison Square Garden. 
After Notre Dame's 66-63 vie­tory Jan. 27 against Villanova, Brey said he was happy his team did not have to face the Wildcats for a third time in Big East play. 
'Tm glad we're done with them," Brey said in his press conference after the game. "We don't play them a third time. We'll probably see them in the· !Big East] tournament knowing my luck." 
As things stand right now, Brey's luck does not look that bad. 
The Wildcats, who currently sit in eighth place in the confer­ence standings, will have to wait until the semifinals for a possi­ble third meeting with the Irish. 
Villanova would have to win its first-round game against either DePaul or Providence, then a second-round game against Pittsburgh or Georgetown before facing the Irish in the semifinals. 
Should the Irish make it to the semifinals and fmals, they will most likely face the Panthers or the Hoyas. Georgetown defeated the Irish 66-48 Jan. 6 in Notre Dame's worst oll'ensive output of the season, while the Irish did not have to face Pittsburgh dur­ing the regular season.

Smith coming out slightly ahead for the win. 
Joseph "Money" Meares def. Terry "Don't Blink" Howell 
Meares won in a split deci­sion over Howell after three grueling rounds. 
Meares, a freshman from St. Edward's, appeared to take the first round, pinning Howell in the corners and shutting down Howell's quick feet. The fight turned into a brawl in the second, with Howell, a fresh­man from Knott, exchanging hooks with Meares. Each fight­er took his turn taking the advantage and pounding away. Howell and Meares each con­nected with strong punches in the third in a match that came down to the final bell. 
Hunter "The Wonder" Land def. Nicholas Ponzio 
Land, an O'Neill junior, won in a unanimous decision over Ponzio. 
Land seized control in the opening round, forcing Ponzio to box defensively for the majority of the first. Ponzio, a freshman from Keenan, was able to regain some ground at the end of the second, but Land still had the advantage going into the third round. Land displayed his toughness in the third, showing few signs of fatigue in a strong finish. 
Parfait Mwez def. John "The 
Highlighter" O'Connell 
Mwez defeated O'Connell, a sophomore from Fisher, by unanimous decision. 
Mwez, a Zahm senior, and O'Connell each chose their spots carefully in a very clean first round. Mwez took the upper hand in the second, fighting more aggressively and connecting with a few solid blows. O'Connell countered with some hard jabs in the third, but Mwez was able to hold on for the win. 
Chris "Camp the People's Champ" Calderone def. James "Turkey" Creighton 
Calderone won over Creighton in a unanimous decision. 
Calderone connected with a huge right in the first, tem­porarily stopping the fight and knocking Creighton's mouth guard out of the ring. The fight was much more even in the second, but Calderone, an off-campus senior, still held the advantage. Neither fighter faded in the third, but Creighton, a sophomore from Fisher, took several strong right hooks that bloodied his nose. 
Bryan "Kielbasa" Marek def. 
Matt Kernan 
Marek, a senior from Knott, defeated Kernan by unani­mous decision. 
Kernan and Marek fought a very even first round, with the two fighters trading punches. In the second Kernan, a soph­omore from Alumni, began to corner to finish the round on a strong note. Marek came out aggressively to begin the third, bloodying Kernan's nose to stop the fight temporarily and earn the win down the stretch. 
Nazur "Naz Tee Nasty" Ahmed def. Matt Gimlett 
Ahmed defeated Gimlett by split-decision in a very tight contest. 
Gimlett was able to effective­ly counter Ahmed's rushes in the first, and appeared to take the round by a narrow margin. Ahmed, a sophomore from Alumni, was successfully able to blitz Gimlett at the begin­ning of the second, but Gimlett's agility kept him out of too much trouble. Gimlett, an O'Neill freshman, battered Ahmed at the beginning of the third, but Ahmed was able to recover well, continuing his aggressive style to seize the victory. 
Alex "Spider Monkey" Duffy def. Patrick "The Chicago Drago" Salvi 
Duffy defeated Salvi, an off­campus law student, by unani­mous decision. 
Duffy, a sophomore from Dillon, and Salvi traded blows in an even first round. The match continued to be close until near the end of the sec­ond, when Duffy knocked down Salvi with a huge right hook. In the third, Duffy proved too strong defensively for Salvi to make up any ground. 
Preston "Punch Throwin' Idahoan" Carter def. Jeff 
"Delaware Destroyer" Skorup 
Carter, an off-campus senior, defeated Skorup by unanimous decision. 
Carter controlled the first round, using his footwork and agility to attack and duck out of range of Skorup's blows. Skorup, a freshman from Knott, was more aggressive in the second, but failed to solid­ly connect with any punches. Carter maintained his control in the third, finishing up a very clean and dominant per­formance. 
Matt "I'm Gonna" Decker def. Joe "The Red Rocker" Langenfeld 
Decker took the win over Langenfeld by unanimous decision. 
Both Langenfeld and Decker, a Keough junior, came out with offensive mentalities in the first. Decker broke through towards the end of the first to knock Langenfeld down with a hard right hand. Langenfeld, a sophomore from Morrissey, failed to make up much ground in the second, held off by many of Decker's left jabs. Decker finished strong in the third, connecting with a flurry Qf punches near the end of the round to clinch the win.

We recognize the need to update an aging facility; however, plans to renovate the main floors of Hesburgh Library are dependent on significant funding. 

 
We are currently renovating the Graduate Study Area of the 1oth floor. 

 
With the OIT, we will be relocating the Computer Cluster to the 1st floor and adding higher quality furniture, equipment and services. 

 
Quiet study space can usually be found in the Lower.Level, the NE corner of the 2nd floor, and on tower floors. 


!Users have difficulty using our web site to find articles.! 
 
We have stepped up our efforts regarding user-centered design, usability studies, log file analysis, and other processes of continuing improvement. 

 
To make it easier to find articles, a redesigned interface called "Find Articles" is now available from the Libraries' home page. 


Faculty and students alike want stronger enforcement of the Libraries' recall policy. 
 The Libraries have introduced a new recall policy that went into effect at the beginning of the 2006/2007 academic year. 
Stay tuned for more results ....

HOROSCOPE 

CELEBRITIES BORN ON THIS DAY: Taylor Dooley, 13: Erykah Badu, 35: Mark Dacascos, 42: Michael Bolton, 52 
Happy Birthday: Don't question yourself l;r hold back because someone doesn't agree with what you want to do. Satisfy your own needs in order to find happiness. Life isn't about passing the time away --it's about doing something rewarding that you can be proud of. Your numbers arc 10, 17, 28, 34, 39,45 ARIES (March 21-April 19): Mingle and network today--an opportunity will take you by surprise. Let others know your aspirations and how you plan to get what you want. Your involvement in active groups will allow you to demonstrate your talents. **** TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Partners may cause you to lose sleep, money or both. Cover yourself from unpredictable offenses. Do not sign contracts unless you are sure of what you are getting. Someone will use it against you if you are open about personal problems. ** GEMINI (May 21-June 20): You'll be more relaxed and find it easier to take care of matters that relate to projects you want to pursue. A problem with an acquaintance or pru1ner may leave you wondering if you need to make a change. Begin to enhance your physical strength with exercise. ***** CANCER (June 21-July 22): Don't take what others think or say to heart. Holding back or not following through with your goals because of someone else would be a mistake. Take a chance on yourself and your abilities and you won't be disappointed*** LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Stop second-guessing what to do or who to do things with. Make a commitment. Pleasure trips will turn out to be better than anticipated. You can catch up on your correspondence and reading and pick up valuable information. *** VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): A relationship is likely to cause you some concern today. Consider if this person is worth all the aggravation. If you are single or wanting to move on with your life, now is a great time to get out and meet people who interest you. *** LIBRA (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): Be careful how you handle friends and family today. You may give the wrong impression if you are too friendly or not friendly enough. You will walk a fine line so maintain balance and you will probably end up pleasing everyone. ***** SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Don't take on too many responsihilities. Getting involved in the personal lives of others will lead to double-trouble. Protect yourself from those who would like to meddle. Be careful what you say to whom. ** SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): A little time spent with friends or traveling about visiting will do you some good. The information you acquire will help you make a personal decision. Someone in your family is likely to divulge information about your past you were trying to forget. **** CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Talk about your plans and gather all the feedback you can. The more information you gather, the better equipped you will be to make the right decision. You can make extra cash with small investment opportunities.*** AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Family issues and personal matters will surface. Don't let your emotions run wild or you will make a mistake that can't be rectified. Assess your situation without overreacting or blaming others. *** PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Using force or emotional manipulation isn't likely to get you very far today. You will have to tell it like it is and suffer whatever consequences come your way. Being insincere or skirting issues will only make matters worse. *** ­Birthday Baby: You have a very vivid imagination and the ability to envision the impossible and tum it into reality. You are creative, innovative and very pushy when you want to get things done.

Fight Night: Round Two 
By FRAN TOLAN Spons Writer 
Senior Dan Ward unleashed a flurry of punches on Joshua Hammack late in the third round, before the fight was called by the referee Monday in the quarterfinals. Ward landed jab after jab in the opening round to set the tone for a fight he would later dominate. In the second, he unleashed several power punches on Hammack and the stage was set for the knockout.

Ryan "Seoul Man" Smith defeated James "Cupcake" Devereaux by split-decision in one of the closest matches of the night Monday. 
Smith, an off-campus senior, and Devereaux chose their spots in the first round, with neither seizing a sizable advantage. In a back-and­forth second round, Smith started aggressively and appeared to have the edge. 
Devereaux, a sophomore from Morrissey, rebounded quickly, taking control of the end of the second with a series of strong lefts. Both fighters took a beating in a very even third round, with

MEN'S BASKETBALL COMMENTARY 
Notre Dame not looking past Big East tourney 
Not only is Mike Brey Notre Dame's head basketball coach, but he also acts as the team's press secretary. 
Brey jokingly sidestepped questions after No. 17/22 Notre Dame's 85-73 win over Marquette Saturday about his team's chances of earning its frrst NCAA Tournament berth in four seasons. 
"We are playing for Big East seeding," Brey said. He also won't let his players

speculate past the Big East tour­nament. 
"I'm glad you tried !asking the players]. Ilopefully, you didn't break anybody in the locker room. I threatened them," Brey said. "Certainly I'll say this, our profile is very solid, but we're trying to chase a bye down." 
The Irish have a couple days off before their final confernnce matchup iigainst Rutgers. A win Saturday in New Jersey would clincl! a bye in the first round of the Big East tournament. 
"We feel like we were lighting for a spot, for a first-round bye in the Big East tournament," Irish guard Tory Jackson said after Notre Dame's win over Marquette. "That's what we're
