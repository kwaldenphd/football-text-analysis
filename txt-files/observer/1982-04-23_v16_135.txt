Sunday, March 28 
We did several large circles over the capital city of San Salvador and were amazed at that hour to see lines offeople waiting to vote, many o these lines being four or five blocks long, some as long as a mile. That was a good augury. 

Atter hovering over the city so that the television cameras could get some sense of what was happening there, we 
headed off across Lake 
Ilopangi, just east of the city. 
Our pilots flew rather high, about 4,000 feet, so that it would be more difficult to shoot us from the ground. We soon passed over San Vicenti, another large city whose 
streets were fiJJed with people lined up for voting. Another good augury. We moved on to the east towards San Miguel and, finally, landed there about 45 minutes after leaving the airport 
at San Salvador. We were met

A ''very dissapointing ' fifty­
six percent of those eligible 
voted in hall elections at Saint 
Mary's College yesterday. 
The system is set up so that 
students must initial the dorm 
room they will live in next year 
before voting, according to 
Election Comissioner Monica 
Gugle. 
''This involves paging through 
the housing list untd a part 
ticular room is found, which 
holds everything up," Gugle 
said. 
I'd like to find a more efficient system.'' 
Gugle noted that in many cases, students refused to vote. ''One girl said she would not vote because the candidate in 
her  hall  (Holy  Cross)  ran  
unopposed.''  
Students were  able  to  vote  

between 7 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. in the Le Mans Hall lobby and during all meals in the dining hall. 
The Ladner Georgen ticket will face Lorenzini Clarke in a runoff election for LeMans Hall Monday. 
Patricia Sigler and Mary Pat Hoffman were the uncontested winners in Holy Cross Hall, with ''well over'' the 50 per­
cent plus one requirement, 
according to Gugle. 
Michele Manion and Patricia 
Nolan were elected to McCan­
dless Hall office. 
The Augusta Hall officers, all except President Vice Presi­dent elected individually include: Sarah Clark, Presi­dent; Karen McCarter, Vice­President; Mary Jane Hart, Secretary; Mary Ososkie, Treasurer; Ellen Placey, Ju­dicial Comissioner. 
The office of Augusta Hall Social Comissioner will be de­cided in a runoff election Monday between Sandy Eitel and Deirdre Grant. 
tion yesterday a plan seem as a final, long-shot attempt to avoid new bloodshed with Ar­gentina. 
As Foreign Secretary, Fran­cis Pym outlined London's latest proposal to Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr., British destroyers and troops were reported ready to strike at South Geaorgia, the Falklands dependency defended by an estimated 300 to 500 Argentine invaders. 
South Georgia is 800 miles east of the Falklands, and about 1100 miles off the coast of Argentina. It was captured by Argentine forces a day after the invasion of the mail islands April 2. 
British defense sources said the entire 61-ship armada in the South Atlantic would go on full war alert tonight when it came within striking range of Argentine aircraft. 
Pum said upon his arrival in Washington that Britain is committed to a peaceful out­come, if at all possible. "We will do everything we can to try to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute," he told reporters. 
But he also said there are "real differences and real obstacles" to a solution. 
'Campus Scream ' erupts on South quad 
By DAVID SARPHIE 
News Editor 
Notre Dame exploded in a near-riot last night as several ~undred students rampaged through the campus, shouting msults at dorms along the way. 
.Ushering in An Tostal's Frivolous Fridar, the campus­wtde. screal!l began shortly before midmght. A group fevensh excttement, soon headed past LaFortune on its way to the South Quad. 
Arriving .at Alumni Hall, the North Quad mob found representatives from the South Quad waiting and a screamiqg . confrontation ensued. After the tw~ groups exchanged msults for several minutes, they joined forces in a loud tour of the South Quad dorms, aiming various insults at each dorm along the route. 
Third-floor residents of Howard Hall were the only ones who countered the attack, splashing water on unlucky screamers passing under the archway. 
Heading pas~ the Ad.ministration Building the group hoped to find Untverstty Prestdent Fr. Theodore Hesburgh working late in his offtce. ''We want Ted!'' the group chanted. It was to no avail, however. 
An Tostal event will continue this afternoon with various activities planned on the South Quad.

A TIME-BOMB EXPLODED in a rush-hour crowd near the· Champs Elysees yesterday morning, killing a pregnant woman and injuring 68 other people in a 
fi~eball that sent chunks of a car soaring eight stories htgh. The bomb also soured French-Syrian relations and raised speculation that the terrorist Carlos had struck again. Police said the bomb went off at 9:02a.m. under a rented orange Opel park~d in front of an anti-Syrian, pro-Iraqi Lebanese newsweekly, AI Watan AI Arabi. The blast shattered storefronts and windows and sprayed glass shards and twisted metal in a radius of 150 yards along the crowded Rue Marbeuf. ''I had just gotten to work when I hear a deep explosion and sa~ a tremendous ball of fire rise right up outside my third-floor office window," said Charles Torey, senior partner for Doudert-Freres, an American law firm with offices 50 yards from Al Watan Al Arabi. He said he was told debris from the blast was found on the roof of his eight-story office building. -AP 
RICHARD NIXON· SPEAKING at ·a lavish GOP fund-raiser, said the Soviet Union has gained an adv~ntage o.ver the United States in military strength, parn.cularly m n~cle~r weaponry. Appearing yesterday

''When president Carter, wuh the best of IntentiOns, scrapped part of our pro~ra~ and the S<_>viets responded by building up theirs, the U.S. disadvantage resulted, Nixon told about 800 republicans who paid $800 a plate. ''With .the edge on their side, the Soviet Union could be in a 
position to launch ~ war -which is unlikely-or, more hkely, to engage 10 nuclear blackmail. President Reag~n must never let that happen again,'' Nixon said, drawmg prolonged applause. -AP

I'm mad, Indiana Bell 
"I'm Eddie Chiles, and I'm MAD, mad about ... " 
So began a series of radio spots a few years 
back by the crusty and self-made Dallas oilman ·Eddie Chiles. Every morning Chiles would be mad about something, usually the plagues of "big gov'ment." Nary was there a subject that escap~d. Chiles' scrutin>:; his gripes ranged from 
the mmtscule to the umversal. . 
Many disagreed with Chiles' anti-big govern­
ment stand; however, it seemed that many more 
concurred with him, for soon after the commer­
cials began, motorists in my hometown Houston 
b<;gan sporting ''I'm Mad Too, Eddie" bumper 
suckers by the thousands. I found it hard not to 
listen to C~iles my~lf, for even though I thought 
s<_>me of h1~ complamts were minor, I respected 
him for tak10g a stand -for having ~he courage to 
speak up. 
Chiles' minor complaints had an effect on me that I only now understand. They convinced me that Chiles was a realist, someone who can get as mad as I can about problems that require so li~tle to corre~t if .o~ly someone would get hts/her r~specuve tatl10 gear. The effective part about.Chiles' touches of down-to-earth griping is that lt made me respect his. more serious complaints that much more. After all, this was a person as they say, "just like you and me " not some idealist who only drops off Cloud' 9 for meals. 
At Notre Dame, I had thought that. the small gripe was indeed an honorable one, for I felt that the concern shown by both students and faculty towards arms reduction, Third World exploita­tion. and the like more than proved our concern for Issues and moral questions outside of Notre Dame. 
Apparently,. some do not agree. A recent letter to the editor called on students to attend to ''more pressing issues'' than kegs or the student ~.enter or. the Nestle boycott. Said the letter, 
Overacnng on self-centered, minor causes wil only endanger our integrity as a student force when acting on the major issues." 
On the contrary, I believe activity of any kind lends to the respectability of the Notre Dame student voice especially in these apathetic times. The first step towards becoming socially aware a~d. concerned on a global basis is becoming similarly aware on a campus basis. 
Such campus gripes, such as kegs and a student center do not reflect badly on students, nor are they selfish, as. the letter suggested. These campus complaints show an honorable attempt on the students part of examine the issues and get involved. 
What about overacting? I'm not asking anyon~ to be a martyr for the sake of a keg, but sometu:nes one must be a bit more pointed to get the pornt across. Personally, I think Edward Konrady and Randy Fahs' idea to pile a weekeJ?.d'.s worth of empties on the steps of the Ad Budd10g might be very effective in showing the tremendous waste that occurs as a result of the keg policy. 
p,.nd n~w it is my turn to gripe, because, like Chdes, I m mad. You know the scenario. The time is approaching 11 p.m. -_ dialimr fin~er

ready~.3... 2 ... 1...go$ Dial9, and then l...Busy. 
Busy for the next hour, maybe an hour and a 
half. 
~he problem has eclipsed being merely a 
nmsance. Some students are finding themselved 
arrangi~g their e~tire evening schedule so to be 
pho~estde at .11 10 order to gef one of the few 
precious outside long distance lines. 
More irritating. is the fact that we students pay 
the. same long distance rate as anyone else in 
Indiana, only .to receive pitifully poor service. 
And some of us manage to nng up quite a bill, 
too.] ust down the hall,. someone IS paying well 
over $100 to Ma Bell this month, and I certainly 
pay more than a modest sum. 
The point is that students spend quite a bit of 
mon.ey on t~e telephone at Notre Dame, a 
portwn of whtch ··Indiana Bell should have been 
usins towards maintaining excellent service, 
and If ne~essary, expanding service. 
Bro. Kieran Ryan, Asst. Vice President for 
Business Affairs, handles the phone system at 
Notre Dame; however, he says there is nothing 
the Administration can do. 
''E~en if we as~e.d, the phone company would 
not. gtve us addit;wnal tru~~ l~nes (the lines 
ava.dable .for outgo10g calls), said Bro. Ryan in 
an rn!ervtew a ~ew 'Yeeks ago. 
Evidently, this gnpe will have to be aired by studen~ voices alone. These voices can become q~ite powerful ones, though, especially consid­enng the sums ~ent towards Indianapolis every month.'The key ts to act in unison. I propose only a few courses.of action, which I hope at the least will get Indiana Bell to recognize that the problem exists, and that we Notre Dame students are vocal and active enough to demand an explanation. 
Firs~, the. next tim.e you receive your Indiana B~ll btll (I JUSt received mine), tuck in a note With the ~ayment asking why the service is so bad. Nothrng elaborate -but ask specifically for a reply. 
Seco~d, the next time ~ou find yourself dialing 9 ... 1. ..rncessantly one mght to no avail, dial 9 and call237-8400. This is Indiana Bell's general complaint number. Calmly tell the O{>erator that you are not pleased with Bell's service. 
These are not irration~ suggestions, but ways that we can act responsibly. 
That letter proposed that we abandon such alledgedly self-centered fi~hts as this one but I ask, "Who will air our gnpes if we do no~?" 
I share the author's concern that not enough ~mention is no.t ~aid to more pressing worldly tssues, but belittling local campus issues is not the way to foster more concern. Involvement lea?s to more involvement, and, as in the Eddie Chiles ~xample, people will listen to you if your compla10ts show a legitimate and serious concern, no matte what the issue.

Judge claims company created monoply 
GRAND RAPIDS  Mich. 
(AP) -A federal judge ruled 
vesterday that the nation's 
largest supplier of health care 
products illegally conspired to 
monopolize its market, and he 
said the antitrust decision 
might lead to lower hospital 
costs. 
In a case flled by four smaller competitors, U.S. District Judge Douglas W. Hillman ruled that a contract American Hos~;>ital Supply Corp. signed w1th Voluntary Hospitals of America was anti­competitive. 
Hillman awarded $430,638 in damages to the smaller compe­titors of American Hospital, saying the contract was an attempt to monopolize or re­strain trade in medical and sur_gical supplies in Michigan, Oh10, West Virginia, Kentucky and Indiana. 
American Hospital Supply, based in Evanston, Ill., sells 48,000 products ranging from syringes to sur~ical greens to 7000 hospitals nationwide and also does business in Europe and the Far East. It had 1981 earnings of $163.1 million on sales of $1.5 billion. 
"If the opinion sends a message to the hospitals that they have an obligation to be highly competitive in buying their supplies...it may well be that (it) will have some general impact in reducing hospital costs," Billman said in an interview yesterday. 
Because most medical ex­penses are paid by insurance companies and the govern­ment, ''people generally have not been concerning about costs," the judge said. 
George Ransdell, president of Ransdell Surgical Inc. of Louisville, Ky., one of the plaintiffs, said the lawsuit was ''a battle for the industry as a whole.'' 
He said consumers were the winners, adding, "A compet­itive environment brings bene­fit to the consumer.'' 
The ruling ''is beins studied to see if an appeal ts desir­able,'' American Hospital Sup­ply said in a statement. 
We would respectfully dis­agree with Judge Hillman," said W. Donald McSweeney, a lawyer for American Hospital group of non-profit hospitals in the nation, with 31 hospitals in 22 states. 
Under its contract with American Hospital Su_.eply, rebates were to be paid ifVHA facilities bought large quanti­ties of goods. The rebates were based on total purchases by the group, so ind1vidual hospitals did not know at the time of purchase whether they would get rebates. 
confront any new Israeli mili­tary move in Lebanon," ac­cording to a statement from the Soviet-backed government broadcast on State radio in Damascus. "Arab skies will not be open to enemy arro­gance irrespective of costs, 
sacrifices  or  whatever  it  
takes."  
The  Syrians  maintain  a  

30,000-man army in Lebanon under an Arab League man­date to police a civil war armistice between rightist Christians and an alliance of leftists and Palestinians. 
Israel said Wednesday's air assaults were a retaliation for a chain of alleged PLO violations of the cease-fire but the PLO and the Lebanese government said the attacks were unpro­voked.

WASHINGTON (AP)-House, Democrats have indtcated they will asree to a three-month delay m this summer's Social Security cost-of-living increase as part ofa budget compromise if President Reagan takes the lead in proposing it, congres­sional s'Jurces satd yesterday. 
In addition, House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr. said Democrats have outlined to White House and congression­al negotiators several steps to shore up the Social Security System, including transferring revenue from excise taxes into the pension system. 
That proposal "didn't see the light of day with regard to the opposition," O'Netll said, who added, "I'm not-optimis­tic'' about chances for a budget compromise. 
There was no indication how the suggestion for delaying the inflation increase scheduled for ] uly was received, although administration officials have said Reagan will not accept any change in Social Security with­out a strong bipartisan agree­ment first in Congress.

Richard Blling, D-MO., had floated several ideas at a White House bargaining sessions Wednesday night led Senate Majority Leader Howard H Baker, ] r. , to tell reporters that negotiators were making pro­gress. 
''I say that because I think there's been some movement on both sides, " said Baker, R.-Tenn. 
Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, another negotiator, also said he was hopeful, adding, "Something h~1.s .t.o be done about the deficits. 
Sources, asking not to be identified, said none of Bol­ling's proposals were in writing and administration and Repub­lican bargainers were expected to press for details at a n_lld-afternoon bargaining ses­swn. 
Ironically, the new ideas surfaced as : some negotiators discussed dropping efforts at drafting a detailed compromise in favor of a simt>ler approach to reducing deficits. 
Under this approach, the White House and Congress would agree on a deficit target for each of the next three years and on how much spending should be cut and taxes should be raised to reach the goal. Congress would then pass leg­islanon to meet the targets. 
Until now, negotiators have been attempting to agree on a detailed J?lan to reduce deficits to $98 btllion in 1983 and $40 billion in 1985. Without action by congress. The deficits will reach $180 billion this year and $240 billion in 1985, officials say. 
Elements of a proposal under discussion include a 4 percent inc<?me tax surcharge for up.Per mcome taxpayers, an oil tmport fee or other tax on energy products and other measures to help raise about $125 billion over three years. 
Reagan's defense buildup would be out by $28 billion over three years and hundreds of domestic spending programs would either be frozen at existing levels or cut. 
In addition, there would be a three-month delay in the cost­of-living increase for Social Security, and the increase itself would be limited to 4 percent.

Woodcock then spoke on his role as the first ambassador to the People's Republic of China, and the history of U.S. China relationship since the 1949 Communist takeover of china. ''China was shutoff from the 
U.S. after the · takeover and a year later was considered the enemy withthe start of teh Korean War,'' said W oodcoclk. "In 1972, the door was once again open to China by Presi­dent Nixon. But U.S. only held the door until 1978, when President Carter endorsed me to begin normalization talks with the Republis."

offered the prayers for the dead and a final blessing for the burial. At that point, they opened a window in the front of the coffin, a kind of gruesome Spanish practice, 
and there looking out at me was the lifeless face of the young man, badly shot up, scarred, cut, bleeding, a horror to his mother, I am sure. The poor woman took one last look, and I had to embrace her as she collapsed in shock. We had few words, and then I gave her my rosary, the one the Holy Father had blessed in -~orne j_ust two weeks ago. 
They closed the window on the coffin, and the procession proceeded on the cemetery, somewhat more at ease because at least the dead man had had a priest's blessing before being put into the ground. The mother was a strong woman, and I could not help but think of Jesus meeting the widow mother of Nairn whose only son was being buried. It was not exactly a good way to start the day, but I was glad I was there and able to help. The soldiers in San Miguel told us there had been fighting all around the perimeter of the city that morning, but that, finally, they had repulsed the guerillas and now voting was going on in earnest, with many people standing in long lines to vote. 
I should perhaps explain at this point that there are many departments (like our states( in San Salvador and that from San Miguel and including it, there are four departments that go north to touch the border of Honduras. These four 
departments, Morazan, San 
Miguel, Cabanas, and 
Usulutan are the four most 
harassed by the guerillas. In 
fact, Morazan is claimed by the 
guerillas as their land; ans 
most of the roads leading 
north have been completely 
closed down for the past few 
months. 
Our strategy was to fly to 
the northernmost town next to 
the Honduran border and to 
put in apperance the to see 
whether or not the people were 
really voting, even in guerilla 
land. The town that they lay 
most claim to is Perquin, and 
we finally decided to go there. 
We could not land because the 
mountains are very high 
around this town. We would 
be fired on from this high 
ground, and if our helicopter 
was disabled, we would very 
likely be killed. We put some 
fuel aboard and headed for 
Perquin. The mountains kept 
rising higher and there was no 
way we could stay above 
because even flying at 4,000 or 
5,000 feet, the mountains rose 
to meet us. We finally arrived 
at the northernmost town of 
Perquin and circled it several 
times, noting that people were 
in the streets outstde the 
voting, booths and even in this 
guenlla-held town, voting 
was going on, despite guerilla 
opposition. We then turned 
south again towards a town 
called Jocoro below the high 
hills, assuming we could land 
there without being shot upon 
from above. Even at that, I 
think we could all admit to 
some trepidation as we came in 
to land at Jocoro, not knowing 
what would be awaiting us 
there .

While we were waiting there, a strange event happened which reminded me for the unpteenth time of the comfort pnestly ministry can impart at the least likelly of moments. A group ofpeople came down the road in fromt of the military post carrying a coffin. Since they were out in the 
boondocks, there was no priest present. This young soldier had been killed several hours before, and in a crowd was his very desolate and crying mother. 
Since I had my collar on, I walked out to the procession, introduced myself as Padre Teodoro, and was, of course, most welcome. Everyone gathered around the coffin and we recited the ''Our Father'' and the "Hail Mary," and I

A tradition of grace 
"Hookers" is their trade name. "Lilies of the alley," James Joyce called them. "Pavement princesses'' is the snickering euphemism favored by Johnny Carson. Paules is the French word used by Hemingway. "Tarts" is how they are crisply designated by the English. Gen­erally, the hope is high they're going to make it home. In world literature, they get a better press chan priests do. 
Rev. Robert Griffin 
letters to a lonely god 
A Protestant once said: "The Catholic Church is the only respectable organization in the world that isn't beastly to tarts." That isn't a bad credential for the Catholic Church to have. Much can be forgiven an organization that isn't beastly. It doesn't help minority groups to sentimentalize them. The back street lives of prostitutes can be as vicious as any jungle; r.imps drop them from hotel windows, they say, 1f they get out of line. But the Church is kind to them. Bless the good heart of the Roman Catholic Church. 
When you think of it, the Church gets deeply involved 10 the sadness of the world. A couple of years ago, I was in a parish where a man, believed to be notoriously evil, with Mafia connections, was shoe to death. He was Sicilian, and we knew at the rectory his family would ask for Catholic burial; we waited for the funeral home to call, asking for the services of a priest. You have to understand that such lapsed Christians are an embarassment to the diocese. Newspapers love to play up the fact that clerics have publicly prayed over criminals, asking God to have mercy on their souls. 
In the case of this Mafia overlord, the Church had to refuse him an elaborate send-off because of the scandal, to say nothing of the contradic­tion between his personal lifestyle and the Chrisrianhope.Nevertheless,aprieswasthere­a personal friend, the papers said, acting in a pnvare capacity -to pray at the wake, and to pray at the graveside. 
You can make of it what you will. For me, it was another example of the Church's not being beastly.
There is a moral darkness that covers the earth like night. Any single priest might be the biggest fool on earth; bur within Christianity, there is a tradition of grace that understands the mystery of evil, insofar as evil is unintelligible. If corruption is the handiwork of the father of sin, then mischief, in irs cold-blooded maliciousness, may be as cleverly plotted as the cosmic dance of the planets. The priest, in his daily insouciance, 
may offer redemption, all-knowingly, to the 
heart of darkness, declarin~ by his rituals an 
infinite pity and an unrelentmg mercy, causing 
the Thin~ that corrupts us to weep for itself, 
because It eternally hates what it everlastingly 
loves. 
On Ash Wednesday, in Catholic cities, women come from the fancy-houses to be smudged on their foreheads with the dust of penance. On First Fridays, aging madams arrive at early Mass, hopmg for grace, through Margaret Mary, from the Sacred l-ieart, that will open their way to heaven. In execution chambers in prisons, chaplains keep the death watch with condemned murderers. In a bleak Russian winter, Sonya, prostitute and saint, sits reading the Gospel with her only friend, Raskolmikov, who has killed an old pawnbroker and he sister with an axe. In seedy, back-alley dives of Asia Minor, assassins and taxi drivers with death in their eyes ask monastic mercenaries for the sacrament that absolves them. Souls in torment, who have made bargains with the devil, pray to see Christ's blood streaming over the firmament. The room clerk at the Metropole, the Phoenician sailor, and Madame Sosostris, the wickedest clairboyante in Europe, wait, like Mrs. Porter, for the coming of Sweeney in the spring, and the sound of April rain, signifying grace, among the dry stones of the mountam. 
For a number of summers in New York, the rectory where I was living had neighbors known to be ladies of the evening. Late at night, I would run into them, having a coffee break at the counter of the Broadway Muffinburger in Manhattan. They had seen me often enough to know who I was, even in mufti. I would listen to them making shop talk, or offer them the benefit of any news I had heard -about the races at Belmont, for example, or the weather that I thought would help them. 
After a number of weeks, the counterman mentioned that the girls really thought they were helping me. "A lonely middle-ager, looking for company, needing someone to talk to," he said, that's who they thought I was. "They feel sorry for you," he said. "They know you don't mean anything bad." 
That's the way it is in New York: of all the street people with professions that bear watchin&[ the hookers are most polite to the 

priests. hey show very little respect for guyswhom they consider cheap sports, and their-idiom can turn salty and beastly. 
I think we represent some truth about God to 
one another. Hookers have a favored place in the tradition of grace; the Lord seems to have loved them more than anyone. I have some senti­mental idea that His gentleness in judging us depends on our kindness to the street people He himself bel ed.

I hope you enjoyed last week's change of pace in the rock trivia. My editor was kind enough to allow me to 
carry out a photo quiz. 
Tim Neely 
trivia quiz 
Things return to the normal state of affairs this week, but first, heR: are last week's answers. You will have to check last Wednesday's paper for the pictures with each. 
1. Beggar's Banquet by the Rolling Stones. 
2. Thick as a Bnck by Jethro Tull. 
3. Chicago XI. 
4. Nazzby Nazz (this late-60s group included Todd Rund­gren) 
5. Beauty and the Beat by the Go-Go's 
6. Back to the Epg by Wings 
7. Greetings  from  Asbury  
Park,  N.J.  by  Bruce  Spring­ 
steen.  

B. Pictures at an Exhibition 
by Emerson, Lake, and Palmer. 
9. Here and There by Elton John. 
10. Yesterday and Today by the Beades (original issue known as the ''butcher cover': to Beatie fans and other collect­ors.) 
So much for that; now on to new business. This week I offer you a quiz the idea for which came once before, but not with these questions. You must answer the eternal question: "Who am I?" 
1. 
I was once a member of the all-girl group based in Los Angeles called The Runaways. That band broke up after some limited success, and I became a solo artist for one album. Not satisfied with that, I formed a band of men to back me up ... and had a number one smgle and tor,-ten album. 

2. 
I wrote' Joy to the World" and "Never Been to Spain" for Three Dog Night, and "No NO Song'' for Ringo Starr; despite this songwriting success I have never even come close to hav­ing a hit record even though I have released many, many LPs. 


3. I  was  the  original  lead  
singer  of the  Jefferson  Air­ 
plane.  

4. I was known in Britain as an outstanding session bassist, having played on many hit records of the sixties. (I also recorded a single of my own, ''Baja''/''A Foggy Day m Viet­nam," which went nowhere.) In late 196B, I joined a heavy­metal supergroup, and the rest is history. 
5. 
I left the Monkees before they officially split up. 

6. 
Speaking of the MOnkees, I am the man responsible for them. I am also responsible (at least in part) for the success of the Archies, Neil Sedaka, Kan­sas, and more rock acts than you could name quickly. 

7. 
And still speaking of the MOnkees, I auditioned for them but was turned down. How­ever, I went on to more lasting fame than those four moptop nnttators, as I became a mem­ber of The Buffalo SprinWield and later a "supergroup.' 


B. I was the first member of the Eagles to leave the band. 
9. 
There are two prominent rock stars with my name. One of me is a Foreigner; the other of me is a member of The Clash. 

10. 
I am the last original member of the Doobie Bro­thers.

Primavera Quartet blends sounds 
Playing a program of 
diversilled moods and styles, the Primavera String Quartet
from Manhattan entenamed a 
crowd of 175 people last night in Saint Marys Little Theatre. 
Violinist Martha Caplin was outstanding as she led the four through Mozart's "Quartet inC

Seeger's "String Quartet," and 
Beethoven's "Quartet in E minor, Op. 59 No. 2."

mus1c rev1ew 
The group, comprised of Caplin, violinist Mitsuru Tsubota, violist Diann Jezurski and cellist Melissa Meell, brought a subtle energy to the Mozart piece. The selection is one ofsix the composer dedicat­ed toFranzJosefHaydn, whose Quartets influenced the formu­lation of Mozart's works. 
The piece builds from a sharply dissonant first move­ment to an increasingly forceful, harmonious blend of the four instruments, and "Primavera" handled the transformation beautifully. The artists were ~uite successful in bringing to life Mozart's con­cepuon of a musical conver­sation in four equally resonant voices. 
The group's next offering, a 20th century piece by Ruth Crawford Seeger, presented a stunning contrast to the Mozart selection. More akin in emot­ional quality (and perhaps ina tonal sense as well) to the protest songs that made stepson Pete Seeger a force in folk music than to the harmony of Mozart's piece, Seeger's work is a study in contrapuntal tension. 
"Primavera" worked master­fully through the varying forms of disunity in the quartet's movements, which seemingly protest against an age in wh1ch harmony has become im­possible. The four instruments worked in a kind of unity of disunity in some cases, with each taking a equal part, while at other times a single instru­ment, usually Catlin's violiln, dominated. 
Beethoven's quartet, played afte a bried intermission, was a welcome emotinal break from the draining discord of Seeger's work. Cellist Meell brought her graceful, yet powerful play to the fore here, just right for Beethoven's intensely emotional, energetic selection. 
Tsubota and J ezurski performed skillfully in balanc­mg the changing moments of power and gentleness that give the piece its emotional impact. 
As always throughout the evening, each member of the group played her role to per­fection, dominating or blending with the others to bring the most out of the selection. 
''Primavera,'' founded in 1975 when the artists were in their early 20's, won the Naumburg Foundation Award for Chamber Music and have performed extensively on the East Coast and in New York.

Riding out on my own 
"Like Mother, Like Daughter'' may be a way of life for some, but without a daugh­ter's conscious examination of how her mother has influenced her throughout her life, a young woman may not emerge into adulthood with her won iden­tity. 
Mary flgnczs Carczy 
features 
As a 22-year-old ready to graduate from college, uncertain of what my life will be, I've thought extensively about my mother's life when she was my age. 
After high-school graduation 
my mother was ready to leave 
Star City and head directly to 
Mishawaka (both Hoosier 
towns) for nursing school, an. 
unusual a~tion for a far~ girL 
whose fnends were etther 
marryin~ or staying at home to 
help wtth the crops. After 
nurses training she made her 
home in Kokomo, Ind., for . 
three years before choosing to 
marry and raise eight boys and , 
yours truly. . 
College wasn't the rebellious 
step for me as it was for my 
mother, but her eagerness to 
establish her independence 
away from her family is 
a trait 
I'm to share. 
nine children, however, ts another issue. 
One of the· most interesting things to watch while I was growing up was my mother's treatment of the boys and myself. Although I tended to receive more domestic duties than my siblings, the work was equally divided. 
Everyone had turns with the dishes. Sometimes I helped out in the yard or with cleaning the storm windows. We all carried newspaper routes at one time or another and were expected to work through high school and college summers to defray education expenses. When college and careers were dis­cussed-, my goals and dreams were (and still are) just as important as the boys'. ralways know that I can ''go for broke" in my mother's eyes; she doesn t expect me to. feel inhibited in any area because I am a woman. 
My mother, however, has made traditional choices for her life: family over career (yet her medical training helped greatly in J!!.9!~rhood) and a male­dominated household wher~ my father (usually) had the last word. I respect her decisions ­she made them and has enjoyed the years. 
More opportunities are open to women now as they burst into·· fields they never thought they'd have a chance in. Mother didn't dream oftrekking cross-country­for employment, a reality I face in journalism, my chosen profession. Personal desire as well as basic economics compel me to continue my career into marriage, J:>robably even after 
having children. 
My_ vision of parenting, too, is different. For me it's more of a 50-50 proposition with dad helping out in the delivery room,. through the ni~ht feedings and during totlet training all the way through to adolescence and beyond. I'd like to show my children a marriage where dad helps with the housework and mom under­stands the family car while we both take an active interest in each other's outside careers a well as family life. 
In Gail Sheehey's book Passages she describes how many women plan their lives until their early twenties, expecting a man to symbolically carry them off on . a white stalhon. · galloping into the futui-e. My mother never waited for that and neither will I. 
Although I;m sure our lives will be different, she's taught me· that it's time to get my own horse. 
Book dispels myths ofsexuality 
Nancy Friday's research on male and female sexuality has recently pushed her to the forefront of authorities on a popular American topic, "the 
search for self.'' Subtitled The Daughter's Search for Identity, My Mother/Myself was , released in 1977. Ori~inally intended to be a senes of interviews with mothers and daughters, the study evolved into a deeper work with the inclusion of professional advisors and the author's story of her won search for identity. 
Stacczy Wikcz 
book review 
~ i 
\ 
Friday's opinions give the study subjective overtones which contribute to My Mother I Myself's main strengths and weaknesses. Her personal anecdotes add interst and unity yet, prevent scientific objectivity. Thts lack of objecti­vity is admitted by the author, . though, and does not prevent it from being a valid analysis of the subject. 
The illusion ofperfect mother 
love is cited to be the key 
obstacle in a daughter's search 
for identity. Friday expounds on the idea that society sees a mother's love as being a uni'l-ue kind oflove that is immune ' to error, doubt or to the ambiv­alence of ordinary affections." Another facet of the mother­love myth is described as the mother's often unconscious denial of her own sexuality in order to protect her daughter from the hazard of sex, preg-
The inability to fulfill the impossible mother image causes a woman to feel incom­plete. This dissatisfaction arises becaus she is only loved for playin~ the madonna and not for bemg herself. Yet, the woman strives futilly in all her relationships to combine the woman she feels she should be and the woman she is. Friday concludes that the basic re­quirement in a daughter's search for identity is the separ­ating ofoneself from the illus­ionary requirements imposed bymother. Once this is accom­plished a more authentic love can be established between mother and daughter. 
The author also discusses a mother's proper role concern­ins the issue of body controL Fndayquotes sex educator, Dr. Mary S. Calderone stating, '' ... mothers tend to ... get between their child's body and the child's self They msert themselves because they ap­parently feel they own the child's body." The importance of helping a daughter realize and socialize her own control of her body is clearly related to her body image and later acceptance of menstruation. Friday also claims that a girl has more difficulty in developing a healthy body image because unlike boys, their toilet training involved minimal contact with their genitals. Consequently; girls feel they have less control over their sex organs and feel more detached from them. 
Competition and woman's relationships with other women are also defined by our relation­ship with our mother. Friday uses the Oedipus complex, opposite sex plus competitive dnves against parent of same sex, to explain the basic drive in women to compete for men. This idea is expanded, though, by claiming, "It is the girl's struggle for recognitio!) for the 
limelight, for he }'face in the world with or without daddy's presence." The link has been · 
made once again and competi­tion among females is ultimate­ly rooted in their search for identity. 
In the search for identity, other adolescent girls "appeared in our lives like life rafts, bright welcoming alliances to carry us away into a new identity.'' Friday suggests that these friends take the place of our mothers and this explains why young girls demand ''tight intense friendships which are such a famous feature of the latency period.'' These friend­ships provide self-confidence and yer, often when an adoles­cent girl wants approval, she receives what the author labels, "The Rules." "THE Rules" put limits on sexual behavior, thereby reducing the threat of sexual encounters. Friday ex­plains that this is different from adolescent boys treatment of sex; "Men are tremendously reinforced by sexual talk. ' ' Girls, on the other· hand, are extricated from their friends if they surpass the limits clarified by "The Rules." 
My Mother/Myself explodes the myths about a mother's love and in the process sets women 
and  men  free.  Mothers  are  
ultimately  freed  from  the  
impossible  standards  of  the  

madonna image, which in turn freed generations of women 
THEATRE 
Tired of the Bookstore bleachers, sitting out in th'e cold, rain and gusting winds? If you are in desperate straits and want to find a better pair of seats try out the bleachers at O"laughlin Auditorium. Beginning this weekend and continuing next weekend, The Card Index written by one of the foremost contemporary playwrights in Poland will be presented by the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Theatre. Seating is limited due to ~he spectator seats comonly known as bleachers. 
Off campus, The Prisoner ofSecond Avenue continues af the South Bend Civic Theatre. Neil Simon is the in thing this season (sort of like aJligators) and seeing as how we are all such fashio c0nscience people, it would be highly suggested that no one miss this theatrical experience. We wouldn't want to be ostracized from society now, would we? 
MUSIC 
Zing! It hits you in the face like a flash of light and a spark ofmusical genious. Chatauqua has the dubious honor of presenting a group of musicians this Friday night that have that rare quality of being able to do more than just play together. Dr. Zing and the Mojohandlers come to the stage with their unique music that comes from the heart and soul. And there is lots of soul in their music. Take an hour or two out and listen to these guys. I hear that an architect built this group well and strong. Doesn't take knowing too much about structures. Just a little feel for the beat. 
Oompa, oompa, oompa! Do you hear those seventy-six trombones playing in the middle of the night? Do your neighbors think you are from another time, like cut time or 6/8? If you have a penchant for brass and must hear th metallic sound of a trumpet blasting forth, at Washington Hall, Friday and Saturday the Department of Music will be presenting a Festival oj Brass. At 7:30 p.m. Friday and continuing at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. Saturday, the Notre Dame Brass Ensemble will welcome the University of Michigan, the University of Illinois, Grace College, Michigan State University, Clarion State College, Eastman School of Music and the University of Akron will perform free of charge. Bras~ ensembles have existed for a long rime for secular and sacred use. This weekend will prove why. 
NAZZ 
Magicians are a dime a dozen (and who isn't these days?) but Mark Davis is one of rhe best and the Nazz this weekend p~es~nts the Mark Davis Show to close out its year. The h1ghhg~t of the show will be his prediction of the final two teams 10 Bookstore Basketball. On the same ticket, The AII-J?uf/alo Band,_ that great jamming group, coming stratgpt from the1r s~ccessful engagement next to the Washmgton Hall stage 10 American Buffalo last month will be gracing the stage with their sound. Check it' out 
beginning at 8:30. 
MOVIES 
This is not the weekend to take the nieces and nephews to 
the movies. Both widely successful in their original runs,. 
Arthur and The Godfather, Part II will probably continue 
that success bur only with your help. Godfather is showing 
at the Engineering Auditorium Friday and Saturday at 7 
and 10 p.m. If you are getting claustrophobic because of 
Emil or Biology in Cushing Hall, take a stroll over to Carroll 
Hall at Saint Mary's and see Arthur. Friday and Saturday at 
7, 9 and 11 p.m. Take your pick but whatever you do, pick 
one. 
LOOKOUT 
If you are extremely interested in the newest innovations 
in traditional . chamber instruments and music, the 
Michiana New Music Ensemble, a group of professional 
musicians who specialize in the performance of music 
written in this century, will flresent their debut concert on 
Thursday, Apri129 at 8 p.m. 10 Moreau Hall's Litle Theatre 
at Saint Mary's Collese. The instrumentation will include 
the use of the electnc flute, electric cello, and electric 
piano. One work; inspired by the sounds of whales, is 
entitled, oddly enough, ''Voice of the Whale''. In addition, 
the group has in. their repertoire a piece called "Blake 
Songs," ten poems by WiJliam Blake, set to music by 
English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams. Check this out 
is the academic scene begins to get you down.

BEN OGUVIE belted a two-run homer and Cecil Cooper lined a bases-empty shot, powering the Milwaukee Brewers to a 7-0 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays last night behind Mike Caldwell's four-hitter. Caldwell, 1-1, pitched his first complete game since last June 8, walking only one batter and striking out none. In other major league action yesterday, Chet Lemon hammered a tape-measure, two-run homer into a rarely­reached section of Yankee Stadium and Jack Morris scattered six hits to lead the Detroit Tigers to their sixth straight victory, a 3-1 triumph over the New York Yankees. The Yankees have lost all three home games this season. Reserve outfielder Joe Charboneau and center fielder Rick Manning each drove in two runs to power the Cleveland Indians to a 4-3 victory over the Texas Rangers. Cleveland starter Len Barker, 2-1, held Texas hitless until a single by rookie Mike Richarkt in the fifth. Barker left after opening the seventhy by surrendering two walks and a single, and Dan Spillner came on to record his first save of the season. 
Jim Essian drilled two hits and drove in two runs to highlight a seven-run third inning and Richie Zisk added a two-run double in the same inning as the Seattle Mariners defeated the Minnesota Twins 8-4. Mike Moore, 1-2, the nations's number one selection in last June's amateur free-agent draft, registered his first major league career victory as he pitched 5 2-3 innings and gave up three runs. ­

The following season, Milwaukee won the National League pennant but lost a seven-game World Series to the Yankees after loading three games to one. Bob Turley won Game Seven for the Yankees, and the Braves went 11 years before winning another champ­ionship. 
In Atlanta and with a new divisional setup, the Braves won the NL west in 1969 with 93 victories, but they lost the league playoffs to the miracle New York Mets, who went onto win their only World Series. That was 13 years ago. 
It has been a long, dry spell for the Braves. 
There have been some historic moments at Atlanta­Fulton Counry Stadium. Aaron hit record-breakins home run No. 715 in the stadmm on April 8, 1974. Pete Rose's 44-game hitting streak ended in the park in August of 1978 when Gene Garber struch him out in his last at-bat. 
These respites from frustra­tion have been little consolation to baseball fans who have asked for just one thing -a winner. 
The month of April, 1982 finally has produced some hope for a new era. the Braves broke the modern major league record by winning the!t 12th game in a row at the start of the season last Tuesday. In amassing the dozen victories, they scored an average of 5.16 runs per game while holding the opposition to 2.58. 
Chris Chambliss, Claudell Washington and Dale Murphy have provided the substance of healthy offense, while waiting for slugging third baseman Bob Horner to overcome his normal spring slump. Sophomore right­hander Rtck Mahler and­veteran reliever Garber have supplie.d pitching. 
Atlanta fans are now asking, 
''How Ions can this last?''

Drake Relays

Notre Dame's track team
liiJICtll [()Ufl"~ ()a4j Vlll 
travels to Des Moines, Iowa, to 
compete in the prestigious 

Drake Relays this weekend. 
Without the services of Paul 
Doyle, who would be a slight 
favorite in the decathalon, the 
Irish probably do not have a 
chance to win any events, but 
hope to place in several. 
Doyle, who currently has the second-best collegiate decatha­lon score in the nation, is nursing a damaging achilles tendon. "He would be our best chance for a medal,'' says sprint coach Ed Kelly. 
Notre Dame appears strong­est in the 4 x 400 relay and the sprint medley relay where Steve Dziabis, Jacques Eady, Mitch Van Eyken and Van Pearcy will run in both events. 
The four-mile relay team of Andy Dillon, Tim Cannon, Jim Tyler and Jim Moyar also has a chance to reach the finals in the hotly-contested meet. ''This and the Penn Relays are the m~st prestigious relay meets 10 the country," says Kelly, "and any time you get to the finals it is an accomplishment. It's hard to predict because I don't know where the other teams are strong and where the talent will be stacked up." 

Other Irish relay entries include the 4 x 100 team consisting of Eady, Bill Ribera, Van Eyken and Pearcy. The shuttle-hurdle relay team con­sists of John McCloughan, Ribera, Jun Christian and James Patterson. 
Moyar, Tim Macauley, Rick Rogers and Tyler will run the two-mile relay for the Irish. The distance medley relay will be comprised of Macauley, Ribera, Moyar and Cannon. 
The Irish have a chance to place in two individual events. Freshmen Patterson and Chuck Constable, who both placed third in the Indiana Inter­collegiates last weekend, will compete in the Ion~ jump and high jump, respectively. 
The balance of the team travels to Southwestern Mich­igan where they will compete in an open meet .

day in the air, finishing 5-of-10 for 65 yards. O'Hara completed 3-of-5 for 56 yards with the first offense, marching 70 yards for a touchdown opposite the second defense. 
Tomorrow's format will resemble last week's -the scrimmage will be controlled, giving the coaches a chance to create a particular game-like situation. 
The playbook hasn't changed either. "We just hope we're better at the same things we did last week," Lichtenberg said. ''The offense moved really well at times, but I was really disappointed in our mental mistakes. We need to improve on that. 
"We were moving the ball, and then a holding call, a late smap, an offsides penalty ­those mistakes killed us. There's no excuse for that." 
Tony Hunter, Tim Marshall and Greg Bell all missed the 
· action last Saturday with injuries. Hunter is still nursing an ankle sprain, but Bell and Marshall are expected to play. Freshman Tom Doerger, who sat out last fall and the first halr of the spring following knee surgery, returned to the field this week and may see some time at center. 
After tomorrow, the receiver picture may look a little clearer. Juniors Mike Favorite and Bumper Schiro are battling for a clatm to the split end job. And because of injuries to Hunter and Pete Buchanan, fullback John Sweeney is doubling at tight end as well, and is pushing Mark Bavaro forD playing time there. "John has done a good job at both positions," offered Head Coach Gerry Faust. "He's intelligent enough to handle both." 
The Irish practice Monday, Wednesday and Friday next week before windin~ things up in the 52nd annual mtra-squad clash next Saturday .

continued from page 16 against the Five. Jeff Lueken and Steve Cichy also provide inside muscle. Point guard Mark Curley will have to slow things down for this club to win. TAKE THIS BALL AN SHOVE IT II · Any team with Mike Mitchell has to be respected. But this is by no means a one-man show. Mitchell is averaging seven points a contest. The rest of the scoring is evenly divided among the other four. Mike Kelley, a sophomore gridder, gets tough under the boards. Sophomore Geoq~e Marget is 13-of-22 for the tournament, while classmate Mike Spath is 19-of-36. Junior Chris Beaman scored mne in their first victory. This team wil probably be a crowd favorite because there are several frustrated Mike Mitchell fans on campus who want to see the senior exit in style. TALK PLENTY S ... AGAIN. What can be said about a team that allowed only 14 points in the first three games? These guys are quick, strong and dominating. But can they play as a team? Some people think not. But they may not have to, considering their wealth of talent. With Greg Bell back in the lineup (he was sidelined for foutr games), they are even more of a threat. Mansel Carter and Stacy Toran usually lead the scoring, but any one of the five can burn a team when he gets hot. Duane Dickens and 1981 Mr. Bookstore Tim Collins are the non-gridders. 
US · Last year It was "Tequila White Lightning," this year it's "US." This upstart "group of guys" defeated "Tequila ... " 21-7 on Wednesday. But the real shocker was a 27-25 victory over "Macri's Monkey Men." Freshman Casey Newell (a name to remember) scored 11 in that game and averaged nine points a game over the tournament. Sophomores Bubba Cunningham and Barry Fay and juniors Paul Deangelis and Rob McGarry provide an excellent supporting cast. 
Well, there you have them, the eight best teams in this year's tournament. And, now, time for the show.

Hardly the 'ultim.ate season' 

Sports fans everywhere are on the ed~e of their collective seats this week, as the "ultunate season" continues. Take a look at the sports pages and you'll see what I mean. 
NHL Playoffs-after an 80 game season, who are we left with? Montreal is gone, Edmonton is gone. Minnesota is gone. The Islanders are struggling. The Bruins are in trouble. What's going on here? 
As if this pitiful excuse for a league doesn't have enough problems, it is now faced with the possibility ofa Vancouver-Quebec final. Ah yes. The world's ugliest uniforms, never having won a playoff series and a ridiculous name wasn't enough for the Canucks. They want to win. 
And at the other end of the map, there are the Nordiques. This team is built around three Czechi'ISlovakian brothers, is a refu~ee from the WHA (remember them?), and 1s about as exciting as a gray polyester suit. 
So instead of Gretzky versus Les Canadiens, we get Ed Muskie versus Steve Martin, Dan Akroyd and the cast of Saturday Night Live. 
NBA Playoffs-Does anyone really think they can beat Boston in a seven-game series? Philadelphia and Milwaukee have the only legitimate shots -so why not let them play for the right(?) to face the Celtics. It's just a waste of time to have to suffer through a New Jersey-Washington or a Denver-Phoenix series. Let's just give it to Boston by default and let 
· the players get to work making commercials. NFL Off-Season-Well, somebody has to be on vacation. But what a vacation this is. Let's see, Ed Garvey says the players want to strike. Lynn Swann says Ed Garvey doesn't know what the players want. A New York Times poll says the players don't even know what the players want. It's all simple to decipher. Pay attention, and we'll straighten it out here. Ed Garvey wants

more money -for himself. The players want more money -from the owners. The owners want more money -than ever. 
See? 
Baseball -Finally, some sanity. The Braves are undefeated and the Orioles have lost eight in a row-at least as of last night. Pittsburgh wants to beat Denver -maybe before the season is over The Cubs and The White Sox have new uniforms, new scoreboards, new players, and new hopes. Games were snowed out at the beginning of the season rathers than during The World Series. 
There are rumblings that the Yankees might change managers. Fernando is pitching without a contract, Reggie is back in California, and The Twins lose just as well indoors as they did outside. 
Get your All-Star ballots and start punching. Cabell, Hrbeck, Hoffman, might be there, and mirabtle dictu. Yaz might, too. 
But there is more, if you look for it. Beyond the "Big Four" there is other news. Notre Dame will play night football. The Chicago Sting had to go to overtime to beat Indiana's soccer team. Bjorn Borg won't be allowed to play at Wimbledon. Pete Couture topped Earl Anthony and Don Carter to win the King Louie Open. 
It's enough to make any self-respecting sports fan take up reading the stock reports.

Reaching the ''Sweet Sixteen" in Bookstore Basket ball is quite an accomplishment but it carries significance for the Notre Dame football team as well. 
Saturday, Notre Dame reaches the 16th of its 20 scheduled workouts, and it'll be as important a practice as any this spring. The Irish will conduct their second -and final -scrimmage before next week's Blue-Gold contest, and player performance tomorrown will weigh a little heavier on the coaches' minds when it comes time to separate the first string from the second. · 
"We still will try to give everyone a look with the first team,'' explained offensive coordinator Tom Uchtenberg. ''And we want them all to feel like they still have a chance to be first. But yes, after this scrimmage, we'd like to be able to sit down and say who's number one and who's number two." 
And there's no position the coaches would like to settle on more than the quarterback spot.
