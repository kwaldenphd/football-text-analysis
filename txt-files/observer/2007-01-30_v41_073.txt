Peer advocates give pre-hearing advice 
By EILEEN DUFFY Assistant News Editor 
Following the University's deci­sion to suspend star basketball player Kyle McAlarney, the Notre Dame community has reignited an oft-inflamed debate over dis­cipline. Fueling the fire is wide­spread confusion about Notre Dame's policy-confusion which a group of 10 students known as Peer Advocates can straighten out. 
Unfortunately, most on campus don't know they exist. 
Dating back to the 1970s, the Peer Advocacy Program provides a student facing charges from the Office of Residence Life and Housing (ORLH) with a student advocate to counsel him as he prepares to defend himself. While advocates are available for basic meetings (termed "confer­ences"), students most often employ them when they've com­mitted more serious infractions and are facing a hearing-com­plete with two ORLH representa­tives, a rector and witnesses. McAlarney, for example, under­went a hearing before his sus­pension. 
Under the watch of Judicial Council President James Leito and Vice President of Peer Advocacy John Trippi last year, the program strove to bring itself more attention. Twelve advocates were hired and a publicity push drew many more cases than the year before, said Gina Dolan, who took the reins of the pro­gram this year. 
"[Leito, Trippi and I] kind of looked at this program and real­ized it was an untapped resource," Dolan said. "We real­ized there was a lot of influence and power a group of students could have on our student body." 
Despite last year's efforts, most students remain in the dark about the Peer Advocacy Program -and the program's leaders are quick to explain why. 
First, although 90 percent of ORLH cases result in the minor conferences, said Judicial Council President Liz Kozlow, ORLH only sends information about the Peer Advocacy Program to students facing the more-serious hearings. 
A second reason, Dolan sug­gested, could be that students receive a referral to the Peer Advocacy Program from ORLH itself -meaning they associate it with the disciplinary heavy hand. 
"Sometimes, then, they're hesi­tant to get involved with us, in terms of not trusting us, or think­ing we're biased or not on their level," Dolan said, noting that some of this year's advocates have themselves been disciplined by ORLH. "We want to make

Jenkins encourages truth, holiness 
By JOHN-PAUL WITT News Writer 
The importance of seeking both spiritual and intellectual satisfaction was the main theme of the homily University President Father John Jenkins delivered Monday at the annual Mass in celebration of the feast of St. Thomas Aquinas. 
"Many universities speak about their goal being truth, but our goal is love," Jenkins said. 
More than a hundred people filled the Basilica of the Sacred Heart to commemo­rate the feast day of Aquinas, the patron saint of Catholic universities and students. 
Jenkins asked the University community to remember "while we seek the truth, we also seek to be holy." 
"At this Catholic university, let us be reminded that we are oriented toward truth in our faith, truth that we should witness in our lives," he said. 
Jenkins drew from his back­ground as a philosophy pro­fessor, explaining that he studied Aquinas for many years because the writing was "simple, but powerful." 
"He pursued truth, but through faith and hope," Jenkins said. 
Recalling the words of Pope Benedict XVI in the encyclical "God is Love," Jenkins said the teachings of Aquinas draw students to "a deeper faith." 
"We are reminded that we are called to the pursuit of truth," he said, "not just to inspire the mind, but to love God and one another."

Return hard for abroad students 
Reverse culture shock affects some as they re-adjust to campus life 
By JENNIFER METZ News Writer 
For students who study abroad, returning to the famil­iar c;ampuses of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's means seeing old friends and professors and walking familiar paths to old classroom buildings. But for some students, returning from abroad can cause a reverse culture shock and lead to feel­ings of alienation and frustra­tion rather than comfort. 
To help students deal with the stress of returning to school, the University Counseling Center offers counseling ses­sions for returnees, said Staff Psychologist Dr. Wendy Settle.

London Program to be updated 
Popular abroad spot will see changes 
By EVA BINDA News Writer 
The London Program, Notre Dame's oldest and largest under­graduate study abroad opportu­nity, will undergo significant changes beginning in fall 2007. 
Director of the London Program Paul Bradshaw said in an e-mail he recognized the need to make certain changes, specifi­cally, modifying the current scheduling system, enhancing residence life and increasing internship opportunities. 
In the past, there have been problems coordinating breaks and start dates that correspond to those at Notre Dame, he said. 
"The principal motivation behind ]these changes] is to bring [the program] more in line with the dates of the semesters on campus," he said. "In the future, we shall begin and end our classes each semester within a few days of the beginning and end of classes on [the main] campus." 
The mid-semester break in London will shift to the same time as fall break in South Bend, "opening up the possibility of London students meeting up with students from campus and traveling together through the United Kingdom and Europe," Bradshaw said. 
These calendar changes, he said, will also provide advan­tages to the British faculty teach-

Essay contest held on Pope's 'God is Love' 
By EMMA DRISCOLL 
News Writer 
The Office of the President aims to spur discussion of Pope Benedict XVI's encyclical "God is Love" with an essay competition and a student conference in the spring to discuss the work. 
The encyclical was chosen because it addresses issues that face not only the church, but the world as a whole, said Sabine MacCormack, the Rev. Theodore Ilesburgh C.S.C. Professor of Arts and Letters. MacCormack is the faculty advisor for the competition and the committee that will run the conference. 
"It's the first encyclical of this papacy," MacCormack 
said. "It is on a topic that is a very broad concern not just in the church, but I would say in the world in that it has two parts. The first part is theo­retical, philosophical, theolog­ical and the second part is practical." 
The essay contest will award prizes for essays submitted by students in three categories ­freshmen and sophomores, juniors and seniors and grad­uate students. The guidelines for the contest are open-ended so students can consider the encyclical in a way that suits their interests, MacCormack said. 
"Basically, students are encouraged to think about the encyclical in the context of the

INSIDE COLUMN 

Dear Selena Roberts, 
A few weeks ago, you boldly stated that 'the 
vibe out ofNotre Dame was that Charlie Weis 
was surprised by the demands ofthe job and 
that he wants to leave. 

I'd venture to guess that the nation's most rep­
utable paper doesn't · 
encourage its writers look-Ken Fowler 
ing like clueless fools. You 
must have missed the 

Sports Editor 
memo. 
On Sunday, you, a New 

York Times reporter, wrote a piece about how 
black coaches aren't getting opportunities to 
prove their worth and bashed Notre Dame for 
the Ty Willingham situation. 

Funny story, Selena. Notre Dame gave 
Willingham a shot so many other black coaches 
are denied. But he failed. 

The problem I have with you're argument 
stems from my velrement support for the notion 
that seven black head coaches at 119 schools is 
pathetic. But you do more harm than good to the 
cause by complaining about a school that indeed 
gave a black head coach a chance. 

Willingham got his first head coachingjob at 
Stanford after being only a position coach for the 
VIkings. He had no coordinator position experi­
ence. Of all the people to reference about minori­
ty hirings, it's not him. He didn't earn it as much 
as a guy like Ron Prinee at Kansas State, and it 
shows in the fact that Washington is struggling. 
Roberts should have talked to Prince, who 
earned the Kansas State head job a year ago 
thanks to an impressive interview. He did his 
homework and pitched a business-like presenta­
tion to the school. I Ie got the job after serving for 
three years as VIrginia's offensive coordinator ­
an assi<>tant position Willingham never got. 
Hoberts claims in her column that 

"Willingham wa<> forced out ofNotre Dame in 
2004, not by the president or the athletic direc­
tor, but by four-leaf boosters and trustees who, 
deep down, craved one oftheir own." 

Imagine ifevery school in the country could 
expect talking heads and faceless columnists to 
ba<>h them ifthey had the audacity to fire a black 
head coach who in three years lost more games 
by 30 points than any other coach in the school's 
history. 

Guys like Prince wouldn't have a job-not for 
fear ofdiversity, but for fear for the school's 
image in case they failed. 
On to Willingham. 

"It's access to power," Willingham said in the 
article. "It's about asking, 'Is my access to power 
diminished because ofdiversity?"' 

No, Ty. It's about asking, 'Is my head coach 
spending two hours perfecting the back nine at a 
golf course or spending two hours solidifYing his 
front five at a combine?' 

That's the sad part about Willingham. The guy 
who's gotten more opportunities than anyone is 
the one who doesn't have the fire to try hard. 
Guys like Ron Prince do. Willingham doesn't. 
Example No. 1: "When you don't meet your 
own expectations, you won't meet the expecta­
tions ofothers"-Willingham after his firing at 
NO. 

Actually, people who succeed in life have high­
er standards for themselves than others do for 
them. ifyour bosses' expectations for you are 
higher than your own, then you're unprepared 
and unqualified for your job. 

Example No.2: Washington just lost a recruit 
because no one from the football stafftalked to 
him for two months. That's just lazy. 

Willingham bashed Notre Dame on ABC last 
year to John Saunders. Now he did it again to 
Roberts in the Times. The association of 'classy' 
with 'Ty Willingham' has been replaced with ·'bitter.' 
He couldn't get the job done at Notre Dame 
and was rightfully fired for that. Now he com­
plains about his treatment. That's the sad part. 
A lot ofguys who deserve to get their feet in 
the door don't. He ha<> gotten the opportunity 
others would die for. And now he complains to 
others when he fail<>. and threatens the opening 
ofthe door with every slander.

Podcasts transform education 
Professors integrate iPod technology with lesson plans and projects 
By LAURA WILCZEK News Writer 

The iPod has changed the way people think about music and videos, and now it's altering how Notre Dame students plan course projects. 
Last semester, professor Christopher Clark, an associate professional specialist in the Kaneb Center, had students in his Applied Multimedia Technology course cre­ate podcasts for one of their five projects. 
Podcasts are portable audio files that students may play with an MP3 player and are similar to tele­vision or radio broadcasts, but uti­lize a different channel. 
Their popularity gave Clark the idea to have his students make "Snitecasts" about an artwork in the University's Snite Museum, a project meant to challenge students and keep them up to date in the growing world of technology. 
The popularity of podcasts prompted Clark to challenge his students with a project that would keep them up to date in the grow­ing world of technology. 
"The objective [of the project] was for students to gain experience using audio editing in a practical project," Clark said. 
Students began their podcast projects with just the title of the artwork and a short description. 
"The next step for students was to formulate a review about the piece of artwork as well as set their pod cast to music," said Ann Knoll, associate director of the Snite Museum. 
For senior Erik Flores -whose podcast discussed traditional Japanese masks known as Okames -writing the review was the most difficult part of the project, not fig­uring out how to record the pod­cast and use the equipment. 
"[The project] took about four hours to complete [and theJ actual recording took about half an hour," Flores said. 
A grant from Notre Dame's Center for Creative Computing allowed students to use high-tech digital audio recording equipment to create quality three to five minute-long podcasts. 
The grant is awarded each year to faculty, groups of faculty mem­bers or faculty-student teams with the intention of "supporting new and innovative initiatives with digi­tal technologies that contribute to the integration of new media into the research or teaching environ­ment," according to the Center for Creative Computing Web site. 
The high-end technological equipment did not intimidate stu­dents in Clark's class, who said they found it rather simple to use. 
"It wasn't really difficult at all," junior Zach Labrecque said. "Professor Clark arranged for us to use portable recording equipment and we edited the sound files using software called Audacity. We were also required to add back­ground music from garageband.com or a similar free­domain site." 
Labrecque's project was on Chakaia Booker's free standing rubber sculpture titled "Latent 
Emissions." 
The Snite Museum is likely to continue support of such projects in the future, Knoll said, and plans to upload the "Snitecasts" to the museum's Web site. 
Clark said he is also pleased with the success of the podcast projects and plans to incorporate podcasts in future projects. Next year, he said he is considering a series ·of podcasts about sculptures on cam­pus. 
"In the end, people could down­load them and take a walking tour," Oark said. 
Students in the class said they are excited their work will be avail­able on the Snite Museum's Web site and that Clark will continue to assign podcasts as a project in the future. 
"I would gladly participate in a similar project in the future because I think that using technolo­gy to support the arts is something that could be very beneficial to today's tech-savvy society," Labrecque said. 
In the meantime, students may listen to their peers' podcasts for free through the iTunes Web site. 
The term "podcast" -coined by Apple Computer, Inc. -was derived from the combination of the words iPod and broadcast. In 2006, an estimated nine million people listened to at least one of more than 40,000 available pod­casts, according to the Snite Museum Web site. $80 million was spent on podcast-based advertising.

ing at the Notre Dame Centre in London. 
"British universities typi­cally do not begin their autumn terms until some­time in September, and so to ask British academics to start teaching for us in mid­August has sometimes been something of a problem, as that is the height of the sum­mer for them," Bradshaw said. 
About 130 Notre Dame students travel to London each semester to focus on more than 20 different fields of study, and Bradshaw said many of those students want to travel before beginning classes. 
"If students still want to come earlier and travel around before the semester begins, we will now be able to make arrangements to store their luggage for them in London," he said. 
Notre Dame's London accommodations are also under consideration. Students currently live in a block of apartments in cen­tral London, about 45 min­utes walking distance from the Centre. Students from other non-Notre Dame pro­grams and professionals who live in London year-round also share the building. 
"It would be more desir­able to have just Notre Dame students [in the residence)," said Geraldine Meehan, associate director for recruit­ing for the London Undergraduate Program. 
Notre Dame's lease will expire in spring 2008, mak­ing change not just a possi­bility, but potentially a neces­sity. 
"We're anticipating the possibility that !the resi­dence] will no longer be available and we are looking into other options," Meehan said. 
Another major change to the program primarily affects business students. Starting next fall, business students will be able to go to London for either semester, Meehan said. Until now, those students have been confmed to the spring semes­ter. 
More internship opportuni­ties will also be available for London-bound students. In the past, some of the most popular and prestigious internships have been with members of Parliament, Meehan said. Recently, the program has added intern­ships in the areas of Catholic Social Teaching and social justice. 
"That's the major unique feature of the London pro­gram -the variety of intern­ships and the number acquired," Meehan said. "Over the years, we've devel­oped internships in business. However, the newest intern­ship opportunity will be in an art gallery starting in the fall. There's a certain group of students that are very inter­ested." 
"Maybe by the fall, we'll have even more [internship opportunities)," she said.

sure they know we're not out to get them. We're on their side; we're there to give them support. There's no harm or risk in seeking out advice." 
So far this year, seven students have sought out that advice (though, Dolan noted, they have received countless questions via e-mail and telephone that aren't filed as official cases). Infractions have ranged from alcohol viola­tions to breaking parietals to pos­session of marijuana and/or more serious drugs, she said. 
When a student receives ORLH's letter informing him of the date for his hearing, he has just five days to prepare -so when a stu­dent requests an advocate, a meeting is quickly arranged. At that meeting, Kozlow explained, the advocate clarifies the rule that's been broken and urges the student to go into ORLH to exam­ine his case report, a documenta­tion of all evidence that will be presented against the student, which ORLH makes available for students facing hearings. According to Kozlow and Dolan, from there, advocates set the pre­hearing wheels in motion.

professional qualifications they may be getting or hoping to get -like law, business, medicine -or in the context of one of the humanistic disci­plines, or in the context of any one of the social or natural sciences," MacCormack said. 
An example of a practical application of the encyclical would be the discussion of charitable works. MacCormack said. 
"[The encyclical] talks about the work of Catholic charities, but it also talks about charita­ble activities broadly speak­ing," MacCormack said. "The pope emphasizes that it's important to live the faith by one's actions as well as speak­ing [the faith] in one's words. You can call that a practical application." 
Students who are not Catholic can also explore the meaning of the encyclical, MacCormack said. 
"For those people who are not Catholics or Christians, we thought the document of the encyclical could be a basis for dialogue on a number of vital issues -like war and peace, poverty" MacCormack said. 
She added that students can also submit short stories. 
"It would be difficult to think of anything that would­n't be welcome," she said. 
The first place winner in each group will receive a $1,000 prize and the runner up in each group will receive $500, MacCormack said, for a total of six prizes in all. 
There has also been some discussion of awarding addi­tional prizes in the arts. MacCormack said, although she said she was not sure how this would happen at this time. 
A student conference will also be held April 27-28 in the Hesburgh Center, MacCormack said by e-mail. 
"A group of students is organizing a conference where they will present 

hol assessment? Has he proven himse.lf community-oriented by discussing the case with his rector and parents? Is his Facebook account clean? 
While specific punishments for specific transgressions are not laid out in du Lac, peer advocates can predict a punishment "based on severity and past cases," Dolan said. 
As the number of cases on file grows, Dolan said predicting a punishment is becoming easier ­students can compare their own cases with past ones. So while Kyle McAlarney's mother Janice McAlarney and others said they were surprised at Kyle McAlarney's punishment, Dolan -who has served as an advocate for other athletes -certainly wasn't. 
"A lot of students expect ath­letes to get off easier than other people. But this was an example of our school being considerate and applying rules equally to ath­letes and students," she said. "For marijuana possession, the stan­dard protocol is suspension. It's not surprising it was two because he was driving, and the University takes that very seriously. 
"I think a two-semester suspen­sion is very on par with what you'd expect at Notre Dame." 
Come the hearing, the peer advocate may be present and take 
papers [about the encyclical] and they are right now work­ing on inviting a couple of keynote speakers," MacCormack said. 
As far as MacCormack knows, holding essay contests with high monetary prizes is a new practice at Notre Dame. 
"It's certainly new in the experience of any student who is at Notre Dame now," she said. "They might have done it ten years ago, but I'm not aware of it." 
Individuals have not yet been appointed to judge con­test submissions. 
"The essays will be judged by a faculty committee and that hasn't been appointed yet," MacCormack said. ''I'm going to try and get as widely representative a group as pos­sible in that there is somebody from the humanities, some­body from the social sciences, somebody from law and busi­ness and somebody from the natural sciences." 
MacCormack said she could­n't make a good guess about how many students would submit entries for the contest. 
"I've had questions from maybe a total of fifty or sixty students who are interested, but it's hard to say whether they will actually get around to writing an essay and sub­mitting it," MacCormack said. 
She said she suggested to some students that they dis­cuss the contest with profes­sors to see if they could get class credit for contest sub­missions. 
"Obviously it would be nice if lots of people get interest­ed," MacCormack said. 
Winning essays and essays written by runners-up may be published in a booklet. 
"I think the booklet will either be given out free or 
sold  at  a  nominal  price,"  
MacCormack said.  
The deadline for  contest  

entries is May 4. MacCormack said contest winners will be announced either at or before commencement.

Warlord to face war crimes court 
THE HAGUE, Netherlands -The International Criminal Court on Monday ordered an alleged Congolese warlord to be tried on charges he recruited child soldiers and sent them into battle, making him the first suspect to stand trial at the permanent war crimes court. 
The evidence against Thomas Lubanga was strong enough to "establish substantial grounds to believe" that he was responsible "for war crimes consisting of enlisting and conscripting children under the age of 15,"said presiding judge Claude Jorda of France. 
The children were forced to take part in armed conflicts, the three-judge panel found, issuing its findings from a prelimi­nary hearing in November. 
Lubanga faces three charges of recruiting and deploying child soldiers in the bloody conflict in the lturi region of eastern Congo in 2002-03. If convicted, he faces a maxi­mum life sentence.

BAGHDAD, Iraq -Iraqi officials said Monday that U.S.-backed Iraqi troops had tar­geted a messianic cult called "Soldiers of Heaven" in a weekend battle that left 200 fight­ers dead, including the group's leader, near the Shiite holy city of Najaf. A military commander said hundreds of gunmen planned to disguise themselves as pilgrims and kill clerics on the holiest day of the Shiite calendar. Authorities blamed the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known as the FARC. At least 10 police officers were missing and four civil­ians wounded, said Jairo Lopez, the top securi­ty official for Cordoba state, where the attack occurred.

Hubble Space Telescope camera fails 
BALTIMORE -The primary camera on the Hubble Space Telescope has shut down and is likely to be only marginally restored, NASA said Monday, a collapse one astronomer called "a great loss." 
While other scientific work can still be done by the aging observatory, the unit that failed, the Advanced Camera for Surveys, is the one most scientists depend upon. NASA scientists say they expect to be able to restore just one­third of its observation ability, probably by mid-February. 
"We're not optimistic at all" about returning it to full function, said Dave Leckrone, a sen­ior scientist on the Hubble at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt. 

Fleischer: libby knew about Wilson 
WASHINGTON -Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer testified Jan. 29 that then-colleague I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby told him over lunch that the wife of a prominent war critic worked at the CIA. 
Fleischer said the conversation happened July 7, 2003, days before Libby told investigators he was surprised to learn about the CIA operative from a reporter. That discrepancy is at the heart of Libby's perjury and obstruction trial. 
Fleischer, who was the chief White House spokesman for the first 2 1/2 years of President Bush's first term, said Libby invited him to lunch to discuss Fleischer's planned departure from the White House. He said it was the first time he and Libby had eaten lunch together.

Indiana House approves ISTEP bill 
INDIANAPOLIS -Students wondering how to prepare for the statewide ISTEP exams could get some answers under a bill a House commit­tee approv~d Monday. 
The legislation would require the Department of Education to give schools a study guide of sorts -information about what academic standards are included on the test, and how many questions will be asked about each standard. "It is now time for me to join David Long and work together as a team to achieve the goals that I had originally set out for me and our caucus," Weatherwax said, quoting from his letter.

Scientists to assess global warming 
Report expected to confirm temperature changes, raise environmental concerns 
Associated Press 
PARIS -Scientists 
from around the world 
gathered Monday in Paris 
to finalize a long-await­
ed, authoritative report 
on climate change, 
expected to give a grim 
warning of rising temper­
atures and sea levels 
worldwide. 
The Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change 
is to unveil its latest 
assessment of the envi­
ronmental threat posed 
by global warming on 
Friday. 
As the panel meets, the 
planet is the warmest it 
has been in thousands of 
years -if not more ­
and international concern 
over what to do about it 
is at an all-time high. 
"At no time in the past 
has there been such a 
global appetite" for reli­
able information on glob­
al warming, the panel's 
chairman, Rajendra 
Pachauri of India, told 
the conference. 
Scientists are keeping 
quiet about the contents 
of the report, but say it is 
both more specific and 
more sweeping than the 
panel's previous efforts.

IN BRIEF 
Verizon adds 2.3 million customers 
NEW YORK -Verizon Wireless added 2.3 million customers, most of them prized monthly subscribers, to put a shine on a fourth quarter when Verizon Communications Inc.'s profit was cut by restructuring costs. 
In reporting the 38 percent drop in quar­terly profit Monday, Verizon also emphasized that growth in its DSL and new high-capacity fiber-optic Internet businesses has outpaced the loss of traditional telephone customers. 
In the final three months of 2006, Verizon earned $1.03 billion, or 35 cents per share, down from $1.66 billion, or 59 cents per share, in the fourth quarter 2005. 
The latest figures reflect a charge of $541 million, or 19 cents per share, for taxes trig­gered by the sale of Verizon's operations in the Dominican Republic. It also included 3 cents of costs related to the spinoff of the company's phone book and online directories business, as well 5 cents in charges for sev­erance, pension, merger and headquarters relocation expenses. Excluding those charges, Verizon earned 62 cents per share, edging past the average forecast of 61 cents among industry analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. 
McDonald's chooses healthier oil 
CHICAGO -McDonald's Corp. has finally s"elected a new trans-fat-free oil for cook­ing its famous french fries after years of testing, the fast-food chain said Monday. 
While it has developed a healthier new oil, the company is still not saying when it will be used in all 13,700 U.S. restaurants. It already trails competitors in committing to a zero-trans fat oil. 
Spokesman Walt Riker said the oil is cur­rently in more than 1,200 U.S. restaurants after extensive testing. but declined to pro­vide details on timing or locations. 
The choice of a new oil comes as McDonald's and others face a July 1 dead­line to begin complying with an ordinance passed by New York City last month making it the first U.S. city to ban all restaurants from using artificial· trans fats.for the con­victions to be overturned, saying there was a lack of evidence. But the judge disagreed.

Over the last semester, Amnesty International's fair trade coffee campaign has made great progress on campus, most notably through the Student Senate's Oct. 18 resolution, which demanded that only fair trade cofl'ee be served on campus and that students be educatP.d about the value of fair trade products. I had the privilege of attending Amnesty IntP.rnational's meet­ing at the CSC Cofl'ee House last week, and I was moved by the group's genlline com-Forward the mitment to improving Revolution human rights and the condition of fellow men. According to the group's Web site, its push for fair trade cofl'ee on campus is driven by Pope Benedict's encyclical "God is Love," as well as the American Conference of Catholic Bishops' endorsement of fair trade purchases "as an effective and easy way for the faithful to demonstrate their charity." 
Fair trade organizations demonstrate an innovative approach to charitable giv­ing through the use of business to raise money for their beneficiaries/producers. Ten Thousand Villages, a retailer of hand­made crafts that follows fair trade princi­ples, is a great example of what fair trade can provide to the world's disadvantaged people. Ten Thousand Villages uses the proceeds from its sales to pay the produc­ers of its goods a good wage and provide them with technical and financial train­ing. The artisans who supply Ten Thousand Villages are often able to then attain the capital and knowledge needed to start their own independent businesses. Purchasing crafts and other handmade items from fair trade organizations is in most cases an easy and fun way not only to get a first-rate product, but also to help people in the developing world become independent and free from poverty. There are few charitable organizations operating that use the free market so effectively to help those in need as Ten Thousand Villages, and we should cer­tainly make a concerted effort to educate ourselves and others about the value of such organizations and their products. 


The reasoning fi:>r fair trade coffee is slightly difi'erent than that for handmade items. According to the Society for the Advancement of Education, in 2003 15.5 billion pounds of co flee were produced while only 12 billion pounds were con­sumed. A'i a result, eoll'ee prices are lower than the cost of production and many eom~e farmers are sullcring. The root cause of low eofloe prices is oversup­ply in the market, and without enr.ourag­ing farmers to diversify their crop produc­tion bnyond eoiTee, there will be no long­term improvement. Unfortunately, I could lind no mention of diversification among the materials provided to me by Amnesty International or on tho Web sites of our campus fair trado eollce suppliers. Pura Vida, which gives away all of its profits (unlike other fair trade suppliers), is dearly committed to helping farmers but it must do mom to address eomlll over­supply. We have the ability to all'ect change most by voluntarily drinking Pura Vida, and there is no need for the University to make that decision fi)r us. 
Most Notre Dame students are dndicat­ed to doing the right thing, and our University's commitment to service and faith is part of what makes Notrn Dame special. Unfortunately, the fair trade cof­fee campaign shares two assumptions that weaken many proposals for change. First, the lack of focus on the market­based reason for low coffee prices demon­strates a belief that capitalism and com­petition are somehow inherently unjust. Second, the insistence on removing coffee options rather than expanding them reveals an underlying belief that mean­ingful change cannot be accomplished through i~dividual choices, but only through forcing everyone to act in a par­ticular manner. 
Global economic competition is a tremendous force that has raised wages, improved standards of living, cultural exchange and created bonds of peace. Though CNN's Lou Dobbs may throw a daily tantrum about his perceived "out­sourcing of America," the non-partisan Congressional Hesearch Service reported that the US actually experienced a net gain of 1.9 million jobs from outsourcing from 1977-2001 and that the presumed global "race to the bottom" in wages has never begun. A'i workers are empowered in emerging economies through free and litir trade, they earn higher pay and rnceive improvements in working condi­tions. Well-intentioned but irresponsible proposals, such as congressional efforts to obstruct new fren trade agreement<; and ClAP's living wage, only serve to delay global economic development and distort the connection between productivity and earnings. This only harms the intended beneficiaries of such policies. 
There are certainly problems within the system, including the problems of exploitative regimes (which lack competi­tive or open markets) and unbalanced negotiations between producers and buy­ers, but capitalism is what we make it and cannot coerce us to do anything. Like the mirror which serves as "the heart of the Wai-Mart" in South Park, we determine what companies do through our purchas­es-for good or evil. Whether we boycott Wal-Mart because of labor standards, refuse to shop at Target because they say "I Iappy Holidays" instead of "Merry Christmas" or purchase crarts from Ten Thousand Villages, our individual deci­sions shape the face of the capitalist sys­tem. That force for change is closed when the opportunity to choose other products is removed as the Student Senate resolu­tion demands or through protectionism. Instead of blaming capitalism and restricting choices, we should fight for more open markets and make wiser choices that form a more -compassionate economy.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Women's basketball deserves more support 
Women need crowds as well 
While it is wonderful to see the enthusiastic crowds at the men's bas­ketball games and hear about high ticket sales, I'm disappointed in the lack of support in general given to the women's basketball team. The point was made that supportive crowds create a homecourt advan­tage and help teams win. I think the women could use and deserve the same support. 
Tara Pillai freshman Pasquerilla East 


Students called to attend more games 

As a long-time ND fan and additionally, a women's bas­ketball fan, it's truly disappointing to witness the lack of student body support for this year's women's team. These ladies are representing your university and they deserve your support. 
The local community shows up, game in and game out, to cheer our ND teams and they certainly appreciate our ladies on the court. These women work out, practice and travel countless hours in addition to their studies. Can't you give up a few hours once every week or two to cheer them on? Other than our loyal, enthusiastic band mem­bers and a handful of students who sit directly in front of them, there really is no student section to speak of. 
Contrast that to the men's games and it's a sad compari­son. These ladies truly know how to play basketball too! They work hard, they sweat, they dive and they get injured. All to wear the Blue and Gold. 
Please come out and let them know that you appreciate their efforts. Home court advantage can make a difference and you can help make that happen, but only if you're in the stands, cheering and making your presence known. Because these women are your friends, classmates and fellow students and some of you know these ladies. And if you don't, you should! They are fine representatives of our University and our athletic programs. So bundle up and get over to the JACC. I challenge you to come out to the next women's home game and prove that "We (truly) are ND!" Go Irish!

What about a student Catholic fil111 festival? 
For anyone who happened to miss the 2007 Notre Dame Student Film Festival: I hate to tell you, but you missed an amazing show. This was my first year attending the film festival and I was truly impressed with the quality and creativity of the 13 student productions. 
My sincere complements and con­gratulations to the student directors, actors, production teams and profes­sors for the pleasant mix of great humor, captivating dramas, insightful documentaries and provocatively chal­lenging student productions. Thanks to the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center for showing the films. My hats off to all for the countless hours of hard work that definitely shined through in these short films. These film projects are a great testament to the students and the Film, Television and Theatre program here on campus. 
With all the talk at Notre Dame in recent years about "Catholic identity," I wonder if there might be a way to truly inspire such student talent and amaz­ing creativity to share the beauty, blessings and spirit of our Catholic faith. Now don't get me wrong, but I loved the 2007 student productions. I am especially grateful for the thought­provoking discussions I have been deeply engaged in thanks to the provocative, challenging, and enter­taining student films. 
As Notre Dame continues to promote openness to a multiplicity of opinions, diversity, student creativity, dialogue and academic achievement, I hope that we can also find respectful ways to authentically and creatively share our Catholic faith as well. I would love to find a way to inspire these talented and gifted students to share our Catholic faith in a way that more authentically speaks to college student today. How can we support and encourage these inspiring directors, actors and artists to seek out our Catholic faith and creatively express the beauty and mystery of faith for example through films on the life and faith of our NOMOI partners in Uganda, of student volunteer work, of Notre Dame peace and justice efforts to bring about the reign of God, of faith-filled stories of hope or joy-filled experiences of God's love in the reality of our lives today. 

The Notre Dame FTT students, with their amazing gifts and talents, will find their own unique, awe-inspiring and creative ways to expres~ and cele­brate the mystery of God working in our lives and the richness of our Catholic identity. And Notre Dame can likewise find authentic ways to contin­ue to support these student produc­tions while more actively encouraging creative expression of faith.

CD REVIEW 

Band releases landmark retrospective album 
ByJAMES RUDY 
Scene Writer 
Oasis has been a rock icon for nearly a decade, headlining the world stage with a comfortable and cocky attitude. On Nov. 20, 2006, the clo.cks stopped to ref1ect upon the tremendous contribution that Oasis has made and continues to make to rock and roll. Often incorporating release dates directly into its albums, Oasis marked the day as time to celebrate its first ever retrospective collection, pulling together the years of multi-platinum albums. number one singles and ­unique to Oasis -instantly familiar B­sides into one 18-track double album, "Stop the Clocks." 
Oasis vowed on multiple occasions it would never release a greatest hits album unless the band was about to split, so "Stop the Clocks" created immediate ­and understandable -concern among the band's fans. To address the specula­tion, Oasis issued a press release at the same time as the album, affirming that they are merely taking a well-earned sab­batical following the end of its recording contract with Sony BMG Music Entertainment before starting work on new material. 
"Stop the Clocks" focuses on Oasis' most popular albums. "Definitely Maybe" (1994) and "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?" (1995) are represented with five tracks each, including "Supersonic," the band's debut single, "Wonderwall" and "Champagne Supernova." Also a major contribution is the band's platinum B-side album, 1998's "The Masterplan." Four songs are taken from "The Masterplan," including "Acquiesce," arguably the great­est B-side ever. Oasis' most recent album, 2005's "Don't Believe the Truth." only received two nods, while "Standing on the Shoulder of Giants" (2000) and "lleathen Chemistry" (2002) contributed ono track each. 
Not surprisingly, the only album not represented is "Be Here Now" (1997), which failed to live up to massive expec­tations at the height of Oasis' popularity. 
It also created mixed feelings among 
the band members

chose all of the tracks for "Stop the Clocks." Arguments about the track listing sprung up in typieal Gallagher fashion, but in tho ond Noel cast the deciding opin­ion. 
Noel Gallagher also told Billboard Magazine he was approached about including previously unreleased songs, but saw their addition as taking the focus away from the band's intention of releas­ing a retrospoetive album. 
In an exdusive Hadio 1 interview, Limn Gallagher said he was happy with the selections, although he would have liked to include "Hockin' Chair" and "))'You Know What I Mean?" Noel Gallagher wrote all of the tracks featured on "Stop the Clocks" except for "Songbird," which was written by Liam. 
To further celebrate the release of this dream set list, Oasis began to unveil its first full-length lilm. "Lord Don't Slow Me Down," shot during its last world tour for "Don't Believe the Truth" in 2005 and 2006. The lilm is set to be released in 2007, but until then, the band continues to showcase it at private screenings around the world to winners of fan competitions. 
With "Stop the Clocks," the members of Oasis continue to use what has made them the "kings of Britpop" to fmd similar levels of success around the world.

DVD REVIEW 



Oasis joins classic ranks with 'rockumentary' 
By JAMES RUDY 
Scene Writer 
With the successful release of its ret­rospective collection, "Stop the Clocks," Oasis has begun to define the eoncept of longevity for both '90s groups and current acts. Like other international bands before, Oasis has wrapped up its sound and continues to package it over and over again without missing a beat. With the release of its full-

Unveiled to coincide with the release of Oasis' best-of album, "Lord Don't 
Slow Me Down" premiered in the 
U.K. on Channel 4 on Nov. 19, 2006 at 11:50 p.m.-10 minutes before "Stop the Clocks" was released. Various fans-only private screenings took place in 2006, and a future DVD release has yet to be settled. However, the band said it would be in 2007. Other bands that can be seen in the film include Jet and Kasabian -two groups that took part in the "Don't Believe the Truth tour" -as well as Girls Aloud, a new British pop group that appears in a cameo. 


The best-of album and full-length "rockumentary" both mark an epic moment in Oasis history, but whether the band can become any bigger than what it has already been remains to be seen. Oasis will receive the prestigious BRIT Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, with the impres­sive list of previous winners including The Beatles, John Lennon, U2 and The Who. But while the award is an honor, it's also a sign that the band's populari­ty could stay grounded in the U.K. For whatever reason, the U.S. has been reluctant to crown Oasis as the next Beatles, even though the group's pres­ent drummer happens to be Zak Starkey, son of Beatles drummer Ringo Starr. 
Fans who c,ontinue to indulge in Oasis' musie will be more than con­soled by this well made and fascinating documentary, despite what "Stop the Clocks" lacks in fresh material. The outstanding "Lord Don't Slow Me Down" reaches heights of intimacy and power with its source material, giving audiences both phenomenal concert viewing rrs well as a rare glimpse behind the curtain.

Commercials take center stage at Super Bowl 
Every first Sunday in February, mil­lions of Americans and others from around the world tune in to see the best that the National Football League has to offer. Staggering linemen, swift tailbacks and rocket-arm quar­terbacks amaze and awe every man, woman and child who watches the epic clash of football's best. 
However, there is that little part of the Super Bowl that everyone tunes in for beside the brilliant displays of courage on the gridiron: the com­mercials. The most expensive advertising time of the year often inspires the best marketing minds to cre­ate a mere 30 seconds of fame for their company. 
Some companies have become Super Bowl commercial staples by bringing their A-games every year. Beer corpora­tions like Miller and Budweiser are often among this class of commercials, airing spots that inevitably become future clas­sics. Other companies have.had "one-hit­wonder" Super Bowl ads, such as Apple's famous "1984" piece and the '90s-era McDonald's ads starring Larry Bird and Michael Jordan. 
These commercials are, for some peo­ple, the exclusive reason to watch the Super Bowl. As this year's game of cham­pions approaches, it's worthwhile to look back at where the Super Bowl commer-

Marty Schroeder 
Assistant Scene Editor 
cial came from, and where it might be going. 
1984: Apple Computers 
One of-if not the most -famous commercials in history is the Apple Computers advertisement during the 1984 Super Bowl. Directed by famed filmmaker Ridley Scott, the commercial depicted a large "Big Brother" -type character directing masses of grey­garbed workers from a large television screen. A lone woman runs in, dressed in colorful clothing, and throws a ham­mer at the huge screen to destroy Big Brother and free the masses. 
The "Big Brother" character was meant to represent IBM, one of Apple's main competitors during the early years of the home computer. With the ending line, "On Jan. 24, Apple will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 wont be like '1984,"' Apple's statement was clear. The literary reference and the cinematic nature of the commercial make it one of the most memorable in Super Bowl history. 
1993: McDonald's 
This commercial features Larry Bird and Michael Jordan having a competition to see who can make the most difficult shots. At first the contest seems normal, but then they start adding outlandish shots such as "around the nioon," "off the Space Shuttle" and "nothing but net." Bird's usual on-court rival, Magic Johnson, had retired from basketball at this point, so current superstar Jordan was brought in for the ad. 
Before fast food and healthy eating were at all connected, it was interesting to see super-athletes advertising for one of the companies at the center of the American obesity debate. Also curious was the fact that Bird had retired a year earlier and was now working as an assis­tant in the front office for the Boston Celtics. As something of a "passing of the torch," it must have been exciting to see the star of old and the star of new play­ing.on the same court. 


Others in the Super Bowl's history have been just as memorable, such as the "Bud. Weis. Errr" ad. featuring the Budweiser frogs and chameleons in 1995. "Terry Tate: Office Linebacker" also terrorized offices for Reebok in 2003, back when the Raiders were actu­ally good. 
Hopefully this year's Super Bowl will be a great game on the field. Even more importantly for some people, the com­mercials had better be up to snuff. Like last year's "magic fridge" that gave everyone an ice-cold Budweiser, this year does not seem like it will disappoint. Enjoy the game and enjoy watching the commercials on YouTube afterward.

DVD REVIEW 
Cheesiness, horror reign in 'Snakes on a Plane' 
By BRIAN DOXTADER Scene Edi ror 
"Snakes on a Plane" wasn't quite the blockbuster hit that New Line Cinema was hoping for, but -like most cult classics -its reputation could grow with the home release version. The DVD edi­tion of the movie that's so bad it's good isn't fancy or loaded with extras, but like Samuel L. Jackson's character in the film, it gets the job done. 
The plot follows Agent Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) as he works to pro­tect Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips), a surfer dude who witnesses murder at the hands of crime boss Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson). Flynn accompanies Jones on an overnight flight from Hawaii to California, but little do they know that Kim has released poisonous snakes onto the plane in order to prevent Jones from testifying against him. 
Sound silly? It is. Actually, though, "Snakes on a Plane" really isn't as bad as it might appear to be. In fact, as a

explicit. 
The DVD is pretty much what could be expected. A movie like "Snakes on Plane" doesn't need a slew of pure thriller, it's quite a bit better than a lot of films that take themselves too seri­ously ("Speed," anyone?). "Snakes on a Plane" may be a bit kitschy, yes, but it never feels forced. The actors, especially Jackson, play it with a straight face, though there's the slightest hint of a wink behind Flynn's scowling facade. The plot's semblance of logic works for the most part, and the characters have the good sense to question it when it doesn't. 


In reality, though, the plot is jut an excuse to get Jackson on a plane with snakes. Sure, it's goofy, but it's also fun, an element that's missing in a lot of modern action movies. Director David R. Ellis' previous work was mostly as a stunt coordinator, and he puts that expe­rience to good use. The film has a nice blend of action and humor, and several of the action set pieces are surprisingly well done. 
The film is also surprisingly violent, with several memorable death scenes and a few particularly graphic sequences. Some of the violence is 
excessive, and 
although it's hard 


fancy special features as long as the image and sound quality are acceptable, and New Line's DVD edition is better than decent. The 6.1 DTS track is sur­prisingly immersive, with strong use of surround and deep bass. The special features include a commentary, a dis­pensable "making-of' featurette, deleted scenes, music videos and a blooper reel. None of the features are particularly outstanding and most are for "Snakes on a Plane" enthusiasts only. It's hard to imagine that a film like this requires a "special edition" DVD, so the current edition should be more than adequate for most casual fans. 
"Snakes on a Plane" is by no means a great (or even a good) film, but it obvi­ously doesn't want to be. Like a thrill ride, it's cheap, fun and expendable. It's self-aware enough to know it shouldn't be taken seriously, but it's not self-con­scious to the point of distraction. "Snakes on a Plane" does what it does very well, and in that regard, it should be taken on its own terms. Besides, what's really more fun than watching Samuel L. Jackson ward off poisonous snakes with a spork?

KENNETT SQUARE, Pa. -So many people felt a stake in Barbaro's recov­ery. They imagined his pain, grimaced each time he faltered, took heart as each day passed and he was still alive, making painfully slow progress. 
The 2006 Kentucky Derby winner's fight for survival was their fight, a symbol of strength, courage and comfort ­and, more than anything else, a source of inspira­tion. 
He was, after all, win­ner of the world's most famous race, in a sport desperate for a superstar. 
IN BRIEF 
Bonds finalizes one-year deal 
with Giants 
SAN FRANCISCO -Barry Bonds and the San Francisco Giants com­pleted a $15.8 million, one-year con­tract Monday night after the slugger spent hours at the ballpark being examined by team doctors. 
A baseball official confirmed the deal, speaking on condition of anonymity because the Giants had not yet announced it. 
The contract was finalized nearly two months after the sides reached agreement on fmancial terms Dec. 7, the final day of baseball's winter meetings. Bonds had to pass a physi­cal, and the parties had to work out complicated language regarding Bonds' behavior and what would hap­pen if the slugger were to be indicted. 
A federal grand jury is investigating whether Bonds perjured himself when he testified in 2003 in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative steroid distribution case.. 

For months he seemed, remarkably, to take everything that came at him: good and bad. 
Finally, it was too much. 
Barbaro was eutha­nized Monday after com­plications from his grue­some breakdown at last year~ Preakness, ending an eight-month ordeal that made him even more of a hero than he was as a champion on the track. 
"Certainly, grief is the price we all pay for love," co-owner Gretchen Jackson said.

Army football coach Ross 
retires after three seasons 
WEST POINT, N.Y. -Bobby Ross retired Monday as Army's football coach, and without a victory over Navy in his three seasons with the Black Knights. 
The former NFL coach, who had a 9-25 record at Army, will be succeed­ed by offensive line coach Stan Brock. 
"I think there's a point in time when you feel like it's your time to retire, and I think I've reached that time," the 70-year-old Ross said in a state­ment. "I think there is an issue of having a certain degree of energy, which I feel is very important for any­one leading a college football pro­gram. I feel that I was lacking in that area." 
Army athletic director Kevin Anderson said Ross told him of his decision on Thursday night. 
"He came back from a recruiting trip and had to go home because he was ill," Anderson said. 
well as new laminitis in both front feet -proved too much for the gallant colt. Barbaro was given a heavy dose of a tranquil­izer and an overdose of an anesthetic and put down at 10:30 a.m. 
"I really didn't think it was appropriate to con­tinue treatment because the probability of getting better was so poor," said Dr. Dean Richardson, chief of surgery at the New Bolton Center. 
Richardson, fighting back tears, added: "Barbaro had many, many good days." 
The bay colt underwent nearly two dozen surger­ies and other procedures, 

Raiders hire Knapp as 
offensive coordinator 
ALAMEDA, Calif. -The Raiders hired former Atlanta offensive coordi­nator Greg Knapp to fill the same job in Oakland, giving first-year coach Lane Kiffm an experienced coordina­tor to ease his transition from college to the NFL. 
Knapp spent the previous three sea­sons with the Falcons before being let go when coach Jim Mora was fired after the season and replaced by Bobby Petrino. Knapp ran a West Coast offense in Atlanta that struggled at times to work with quarterback Michael Vick. 
"I've been familiar with his success coaching in this league for some time now," Kiffin said in a statement. "He shares the same vision and passion for what it will take to bring an explosive offense back to the Raider Nation." 
Kiffm said at his introductory news conference that he would call the plays in Oakland. 
including cast changes under anesthesia. He spent time in a sling to ease pressure on his legs, had pins inserted and was fitted at the end with an external brace ­extraordinary measures for injuries that most horses never survive. 
Weeks of positive reports turned into months. Barbaro was eyeing the mares, nicker­ing, gobbling up his feed and trying to walk out of his stall. But Richardson warned there still could be trouble, and by mid­July, his greatest fear became reality -lamini­tis struck Barbaro's left hind leg.

Pittsburgh tops 'Nova to reach 20-win mark 
Cambell, Green lead way for Butler, allow starters some rest in Bulldogs' win over Illinois-Chicago 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA -With its inside game stifled, Pitt got its transition offense going just in time. 
Levance Fields scored 20 points and Aaron Gray had 14 points and 10 rebounds, leading No. 7 Pittsburgh over Villanova 65-59 on Monday night. 
Antonio Graves had 13 points, including a clutch 3-pointer in the closing minutes, to help the Panthers {20-3, 8-1 in Big East) win for the 1Oth time in 11 games. Pitt set a school record by reaching the 20-win mark for the sixth consecutive sea­son. 
"It was great to make some adjustments," Pitt coach Jamie Dixon said. "We were playing stationary. We got better move­ment and more penetration in the second half." 
Curtis Sumpter scored 21 points for Villanova {14-7, 3-5). The Wildcats were seeking their third victory over a ranked opponent this month. 
Fields' fastbreak layup broke a 4 7 -all tie with 6:03 left and Pitt led the rest of the way. Another layup by Fields follow­ing a turnover made it 51-4 7. 
Mike Nardi's layup cut it to 54-51. After a turnover, Nardi banked one in just before the shot clock expired to cut the deficit to 54-53. 
But Graves hit a 3-pointer and Fields added another 3 to give Pitt a 60-55 lead with 51 sec­onds remaining. 
The 7 -foot Gray then blocked Sumpter's shot and Graves iced it with a pair of free throws.

Everyone is welcome and confidentiality is assured. 
"We had great defensive pos­sessions there," Villanova coach Jay Wright said. "A couple times they were stuck, but they just kicked it out and those two (Fields and Graves) bit big shots that were contested." 
Villanova beat then-No. 21 Notre Dame on Jan. 17 and defeated then No. 21 Texas three days later. The Wildcats used a matchup zone most of the game, and trapped quite effectively in the first half. 
But Pitt turned to its little man -Fields -in the second half instead of relying on Gray. 
Gray credited the backcourt for making tough shots at cru­cial times. 
"We're not a team of just Aaron Gray," he said. "They should get a lot of attention. I would never underestimate them." 
Pitt took its first lead since before the midpoint of the first half when Keith Benjamin hit a 3-pointer to make it 38-37 with 12:21left. 
Benjamin sank another 3 to extend the lead to 43-37 a few minutes later. Nardi finally ended Pitt's 12-0 run with a 3­pointer, and Scottie Reynolds' driving layup tied it at 45. 
Villanova turned the ball over on five of seven possessions during Pitt's run. 
"A couple breakdowns here or there is the difference," Nardi said. "They never stopped playing." 
Butler 71, Illinois-Chicago 45 
Getting its starters some needed rest was Butler's moti­vation and its reward. 
ORE CO NCIL 


Pete Campbell scored 17 points, Mike Green added 16 and the No. 13 Bulldogs, play­ing the third of four games in a seven-day stretch, routed Illinois-Chicago on Monday night. 
"That was pretty important," Campbell, the Bulldogs' top reserve and a 3-point specialist, said of the shared playing time in which all 12 players saw action. "It kind of feels like we're in the NBA now. You get an understanding how those guys feel playing a game every other night. 
"But enough of us did our jobs so the starters could get some rest. It was just a good team effort," Campbell said. 
The Bulldogs (20-2, 8-1 Horizon League), reaching 20 victories in the fewest number of games in school history, fin­ish their busy stretch Wednesday night at Youngstown State. Butler beat Youngstown 67-39 two weeks ago. 
Against UIC, the Bulldogs hit their first five field goals, 3­pointers by five different play­ers, took a 39-16 lead at half­time, built it to as many as 33 points in the second half and coasted the rest of the way, eas­ily avenging their only confer­ence loss of the season. 
Nobody played more than 29 minutes for Butler. 
"I hope that's the case," coach Todd Lickliter said of the benefit of being able to rest his players. "That's the way we saw it at the time. We thought it would be a good thing. There's been a lot of travel." 
Kansas 76, Nebraska 56 
Nebraska fans were urged to show up early and make Monday night's game against sixth-ranked Kansas a "red out." 
It turned out to be a blowout. 

The Jayhawks held Nebraska scoreless for almost 14 minutes in the first half, using a 27-0 run to fuel a victory. 
Kansas owns the record for most lopsided win by a Nebraska opponent -102-46 in 1958 -and it looked as if the Jayhawks would threaten that 56-point margin after going up 39-6. 
As the game got further out of hand, fans began to sarcasti­cally cheer Kansas' missed shots and Nebraska's rebounds. When Jay-R Strawbridge's layup ended a scoring drought that lasted nearly 14 minutes, much of the crowd rose to cheer the occasion. 
"We didn't plan to come and blow them out," said Brandon Rush, who led the Jayhawks with 20 points. "They weren't making no shots, and our shots were falling. The first 17 min­utes the crowd was quiet. They were happy when they made a shot at the end. It was kind of funny." 
The Jayhawks (19-3, 6-1 Big 

12) won for the 13th time in 14 games. Their 16th win in 17 meetings with Nebraska gave them a half-game lead over Texas A&M and Texas in the conference. The Huskers (12-8, 1-5) lost their third straight. 
Nebraska's first appearance in 11 years on ESPN's "Big Monday" had fans in a partying mood. The school's athletic marketing department encour­aged them to show up early and to wear their red. 
The Jayhawks took the crowd right out of the game. 
Julian Wright, who had 13 of his 17 points in the first half, scored the first eight for Kansas. Then Rush hit two quick 3s to break open a 12-6 game and start the decisive run. 
"That's about as well as you can execute," KU coach Bill Self said. "That's about the best 17 minutes a team can play. We didn't play as well after the first 17-18 minutes. We kind of lost focus." 
Ryan Anderson made six 3­pointers and led Nebraska with 19 points. There were no other highlights for the Huskers, who managed only one offensive rebound and were outrebound­ed47-21. .. 
"I thought we were ready to play someone like that. The fact of the matter is, we were scared," first-year Nebraska coach Doc Sadler said. "I've never had a team that was scared. I don't know if it was because it was on TV or what it was." 
Nebraska played KU on even terms much of the second half. The Huskers, who trailed by 35 points in the first half, got the deficit down to 20 in the final minute. 
Aleks Marie, Nebraska's sea­son scoring leader, missed his only two shots of the first half and was held to nine points. 
"We wanted to take them out early," Rush said. "We wanted to take the head off by attack­ing Aleks, which we did."

SuPER BowL 
Tested Grossman at ease 
Bear's up-and-down quarterback under Manning's bright spotlight 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -Rex Grossman's base­ball cap was on backwards and there was some beard stubble on his face. Less than a week before the Super Bowl, the Chicago Bears quarterback was relaxed and at ease. 
''I'm having a blast," he said Monday. · 
Grossman was thoughtful as he answered questions during a press conference. After all, there's prac­tically nothing he hasn't been asked this season. He's absorbed criticism, heard the calls to bench him and then did enough to help the Bears get to the NFL title game. 
"When I was drafted, one of the first things that people told me was that the backup quarterback was the most popular player in town," he joked. 
Despite Grossman's up-and­games, but I'm happy where I'm down season -excellent at times, at.

player of the month for September and the Bears rushed to a quick start. Some even whispered he was on the path to an MVP season with the offense looking so potent. 
But in a Monday night outing at Arizona -the Bears' sixth game -Grossman threw four intercep­tions before Chicago rallied to win 24-23. He also had shaky games in losses against the Dolphins and Patriots, and another weak one against the VIkings, when his QB rating was 1.3. 
Despite the boos raining down at Soldier Field and cries for backup Brian Griese increasing, Bears coach Lovie Smith stuck with Grossman. 

Montoya proves multi-talented 
Columbian Formula One star grabs first-ever NASCAR victory 
Associated Press 
CHARLOTTE, N.C.-When Juan Pablo Montoya grabbed his first major victory since fleeing Formula One, it solidified just what a special talent the Cololilbian is. 
But the win Sunday by his Chip Ganassi Racing team in the Rolex 24 at Daytona -the most presti­gious sports car event in North America -also raised questions about what reasonable expecta­tions there should be on Montoya during his first full season in NASCAR. 
Maybe he won't struggle nearly as much as everyone expects. Perhaps the switch to stock cars will be fairly seamless. 
And maybe, just maybe, Montoya will be pretty darned good. 
Slow down just a little bit, car OWIJer Chip Ganassi warned Monday, and don't start engraving Montoya's name on the Nextel Cup trophy just yet. 
"In terms of his stock -car career, we are still in the bottom of the second inning," Ganassi said. "That's just being realistic of where we are at." 
Give Ganassi credit for refusing to get sucked into the Montoya hype, which was ratcheted up after the Rolex win tied Montoya with Mario Andretti as the only drivers to win the Indianapolis 500, a CART title, a Formula One race and the Daytona sports car endurance event. 
And as the racing world debated just what this victory actually proves, Ganassi matter-of-factly rebuked any notion that it will translate into a blazing start to the NASCAR season. 
"This was a big win, no doubt, a huge feather in his cap," Ganassi said. "And maybe this shows that he's a fast learner. But I really don't think there's much of a con­nection between the Rolex and Cup. He's still learning a new craft and he's still got a long way to go." 
That tempering of expectations has been limited to the Ganassi camp in the six months since Montoya made the radical deci­sion to leave F1 for NASCAR, which is widely ridiculed in the European racing circles that made Montoya both rich and famous. 
After all, going round and round in circles can't really be that diffi­cult, right? At least that's the atti­tude seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher took when asked about Montoya's move. 
"Personally, I wouldn't do it," Schumacher told the New York Times. "What do you do in NASCAR? What is exciting there? I can't see that, running around on ovals." 
If it's as easy as Schumacher believes, then Montoya should be an instant success. But Montoya has tried to put the brakes on that notion. 
"People don't understand what a big challenge this style of racing is," he said. "It's not an easy tran­sition." 
No, it isn't. Which is why anyone who truly understands racing realizes that Montoya will have his ups and downs in NASCAR, and winning a road course event at Daytona will have little carryover into the season-opening Daytona 500. 
To be successful in the 500, Montoya will have to master the intricacies of restrictor-plate rac­ing, understand the draft and learn the dangerous art of bump­drafting -something only a handful of NASCAR drivers are truly adept at. 
Assuming he can figure all of that out, Montoya still must con­vince his fellow competitors that he has not· only grasped it, but that he won't screw it up over the 500-mile event. If he can't do that, and no other driver trusts him enough to work with him on the track, then Montoya won't stand a chance at Daytona. 
Jeff Gordon, a three-time Daytona 500 winner, smartly tried to gauge Montoya's skill during preseason practice there earlier this month. Although he thinks Montoya understands it, Gordon said the verdict will be out until Speedweeks.

wins alone. They have separat­
ed themselves as one of the 
truly legitimate teams that have 
the ingredients necessary to 
make a run for the national title 
game, with their suffocating 
defense, well-rounded forward · lines and Hobey Baker gem, 
goalie Dave Brown. 
Ever since the Irish drop­
kicked No.1 Boston College into 
Boston Harbor with a 7-1 
trouncing in their third game of 
the year, the team has steadily 
ground up each traditional 
hockey powerhouse it encoun­
tered -both at home and on 
the road. The only hiccup came 
in a 2-0 road loss to top-1 0 
Michigan State -hardly a rea­
son to jump ship. 

And on Saturday night with an 
Indiana snowstorm swirling out­
side the Joyce, the Irish forced 
last year's regular season cham­
pion RedHawks to glumly wade 
through post-game chats with 
family and friends before board­
ing the bus for what must have 
been a never-ending drive back 
to Oxford, Ohio. 
The game that night ended in 
a 2-2 tie and was everything 
that Friday's thrilling 4-1 win 
wasn't-slow, uninspired and 
boring -but the fact that it 
ended in a draw at all is reason 
enough to throw some money 
down on the Irish to make it to 
the Frozen Four in St. Louis. 
It just shouldn't have hap­
pened. 
Miami played well enough to 
take advantage of a sloppy Irish 
turnover for a goal in the first 
period, and then pressured 
offensively until right wing Brian Kaufman broke through -or life -to even score one for the 2-0 lead late in the sec­goal, let alone get two and near­ond period. The Irish were lost ly score in the ensuing overtime well into the third period and period. But it did. The Irish couldn't get anything past goalie clawed out of the grave and won Jeff Zatkoff.

back memories of the 2004-05 season. The electrical buzz of the Coke machine on press row battled the falling snow for noise dominance. 
In short, everything about the night was deader than Knute Rockne's ghost. 
Then Irish center Mark Van Guilder redirected a shot from defenseman Wes O'Neill past Zatkoff, and suddenly the Irish thrust a hand through the coffm and began to dig past six feet of dirt. Freshman center Kevin Deeth, who only minutes before had been benched by Irish coach .Jeff Jackson for poor play, made amends for a night of missed passes and lost chances, burying a rebound for the tying goal with just over two minutes left to play. The Irish Frankenstein had been zapped back into the world of the living on a stormy winter night. 
Nothing about the previous two and a half plus periods would have given any indication that Notre Dame had any shot winning, and they have done it all year. 
They have rou­tinely won games over veteran teams with hockey tradi­tions thicker than a law textbook. 
And the most telling part of it all? 
A majority of those ranked teams that fell hard to the Irish have remained firmly entrenched in the 

national rankings, months of play against the rest of the nation has affrrmed that Notre Dame did not benefit from a front-loaded schedule by playing over-hyped teams early. Boston College, Michigan, Michigan State, Miami and Lake Superior State are, barring a major slump, almost all guaranteed a berth in the 16-team NCAA Tournament come March ­along with their Irish masters. 
Saturday may have been as ugly to the Irish as the mug of Frankenstein's monster, but the comeback proved that no mat­ter how pretty or nasty Notre Dame plays its opponents, those teams have learned that nothing that emerges from the North Dome is ever safe to poke a stick at -even if it looks dead.

bles point at hand," Irish coach Bobby Bayliss said. 
Bass took a 6-3, 7-6 (1) win at first singles, but had to put in a fight to knock off No. 48 Bubenick. Bass was able to regain composure and win a decisive tiebreaker after hav­ing his serve broken at 5-3 in the second set. 
Parbhu had an easier time of getting past Dara McLoughlin, and he eventual­ly won 6-3, 6-4. Parbhu fell behind 3-2 in the opening set but bounced back to take three of the final four games of the set enroute to a match victory. 
Junior Andrew Roth put in the toughest fight for the Irish at number six singles against Peter Antons. Roth dropped the first set 3-6 but came back to win the second and third sets 6-2, 7-5, respectively. 
"In all of those matches we had to overcome some adver­sity and that's a good thing for us," Bayliss said. 
The Irish kept the pressure on after jumping out to the early advantage -an accom­plishment Bayliss was espe­cially proud of. 
"I think they ability to finish off a pretty tough opponent when we had them down is a great sign for us," Bayliss said. "We've had some trou­ble in the past when we have a team down putting them away but today we handled that job very well." 
The win over the Hoosiers improves Notre Dame's record to 2-1 for the season and 1-0 at home. The Irish will look to stay on the winning streak at home. The team takes on No. 15 Florida State and No. 7 Duke starting Friday at home and will look to walk away 3­0 at home. 
"Our goal is to try to be undefeated at home and we have several top-10 teams here that we would have to beat in order to be able to ful­fill that goal so I guess it starts this weekend," Bayliss said. "Winning the first one was a good start."

No. 10 men's volleyball falls in five set match 
Men Is and women Is bowling host annual Blue and Gold Classic 
Special to The Observer 
Saturday, No. 10 Notre Dame ventured north to St. Joseph's, Mich. to challenge powerhouse Michigan State. The annual exhibition game, dubbed "The Battle in The House of Noise", serves as a fundraiser for Lake Michigan Catholic High School. 
The Sparta,ns ultimately prevailed in a hard-fought contest, 25-20, 19-25, 25-22, 23-25, 15-9. 
In the first game, the Irish quickly fell behind 6-1. Despite strong play from sen­ior Drew Williams, the slow start proved to be too much to overcome, as Notre Dame lost 25-20. 
After switching sides and resetting the score, the Irish looked like a different team. 
They formed an early rally of their own, shifting the momentum towards them­selves. Junior James Ward led the way with a long string of serves before having to roll the ball under the net. Never trailing in the set, the Irish closed it with a win, 25-19. 
For the first three games, starting middle blocker Joe O'Connell provided firepower at the net, keeping the Spartans on their toes, prior to his night-ending knee injury suffered during the third game. 
The team, however, didn't miss a beat as Tim Goldsmith jumped in to keep the set close. Untimely errors even­tually caused the game to slip away for the Irish, resulting in a 25-22 loss. 
With the Spartans one set away from sealing the match, the Irish held their ground. 

The set was tied at its mid­way point until the Spartans made a surge forward and the Irish found themselves in a four-point hole. 
Freshman Alex Lewis entered the game and provid­ed the spark for Notre Dame, leading the Irish on an 8-2 run, that resulted in a 25-23 win for the Irish. 
Just as the previous year, The Battle in The House of Noise went into a fifth and decisive set to 15. Behind the attacking of outside hitter Dan Zibton, the Irish jumped to an early lead. 
However, the lead quickly faded as the Spartans rattled off eight consecutive points. Though the Irish picked up their play and ended the rally, it was too little, too. late as the Irish lost the final set, 9­15. 
Bowling 

Notre Dame hosted the 
annual Blue and Gold Classic at Beacon Bowl this weekend. The event is one of the largest national collegiate tournaments, with sixty-eight teams participating. Of those teams, 44 are men's and 22 are women's squads. 
The tournament featured the defending NCAA National Men's Champion Saginaw Valley State, and defending Women's National Champion, Lindenwood, as well as many other top teams in the coun­try. 
The men's event was won by Saginaw Valley State. The entire Saginaw Valley State team averaged over 200 for nine games. Lindenwood, Purdue, Wichita State, and Morehead State rounded out the men's top five. 
High game scores for the men's event included games of 286, 284, and 278. 
Wichita State captured the women's championship, with 
their top bowler averaging 201. 
Lindenwood, Newman, Morehead State and Purdue completed the women's top five. 
Jim Talamo paced the Irish with a 184.9 average, a 208 high game, and a 1664 total for nine games. This was good for 69th place in a field of 296 in the men's competi­tion. 
Pavan Sadarangani rolled five games for a 166.6 aver­age, and posted the high game score for the Irish, at 
224. Kim Lavigne averaged 
164.6 with a 211 high game, while Nick Manieri totaled 1237 for eight games, a 154.6 average. Adam Lacock was just behind with a 152.2 aver­age. 
James Breen rolled an 819 total for six games, and fresh­man Ryan Pantanges chipped in with a 470 total in his four games.

pens I think their best bet is to probably just hold on to those they already have." 
National Signing Day is Feb. 7, at which time players can sign binding letters of intent. 
Defenders with current offers from Notre Dame include cornerback Ronald Johnson of Michigan, safety Major Wright of Florida and safety Michael MeN eil of Alabama. 
Notre Dame's best chance at a late pickup may be in Wright, who attends the high school of current Irish fresh­men offensive linemen Dan Wenger and Sam Young. 
But stealing a prospect from another school might be even easier. Frank said Notre Dame offered a scholarship to Brian Smith, a 6-foot-2 linebacker from Kansas who committed to Iowa in December. Smith's father, Chris, played at Notre Dame. 
"He's always wanted to go to Notre Dame, and whether that happens or not, we'll still find out," Frank said. "I think that they've got a shot to get him." 
Frank said the Irish are also hoping to take Ohio kicker Brandon Walker away from Louisville. Walker is expected to visit Notre Dame this week­end.

On the road, again 
Irish looking for first win at Syracuse in over two seasons 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Sporrs Ediror 
Nos. 19/21 Notre Dame has­n't won a true road game this season. It hasn't won at Syracuse since 2004, and hasn't won two games in a row in two weeks. 
Coach Mike Brey's squad will try to break all those streaks tonight when it takes on the Orange in the Carrier Dome at 7 p.m. 
Notre Dame (17-4, 5-3 Big East) moved into a tie for fourth in the conference with a 66-63 win over Villanova Saturday. Brey said the low­scoring, physical game with the Wildcats will help the young Irish against Syracuse and its aggressive 2-3 zone defense. 
"It was important to us to muck one out like that," Brey said. "It's a step forward for this group."

FOOTBALL RECRUITING 
Notre Dame loses battle for recruit 
By KEN FOWLER Sporrs Ediror 
Four days after star defen­sive end Justin Trattou de­committed to Notre Dame and announced he would instead play football at Florida, the Irish saw another defensive line prospect go elsewhere. 
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Monday that 6-foot-3, 255-pound defensive end Jason Peters of Baton Rouge committed to coach Chan Gailey and Georgia Tech. Peters visited Louisiana State, Oklahoma and Florida this weekend before deciding 9n the Yellow Jackets, the Journal­Constitution reported. 
Peters was one of the few remaining targets on Notre Dame's board. although nab­bing thfl Catholic Junior High School product from the South seemed unlikely. 
"He was a guy that they 
recruited for a while and seemed like he was interest­ed," said Mike Frank, who covers Notre Dame recruiting for Irisheyes.com, a member of the Scout.com network. "But for whatever reason, he didn't seem to have an inter­est in visiting here.... They came on a little late for him." 
Notre Dame has offered scholarships to several other players, but it is believed that Peters was the last defensive lineman with such an offer ­though Irish coach Charlie Weis could make last-minute offers. 
''I'm not sure they'll go after another defflnsive end, to be honest with you," Frank said. "I think they'll just kind of stick with what they've got. You just can't overcome not having a relationship with guys.
