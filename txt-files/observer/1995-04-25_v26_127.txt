Oil firms gain in working with EPA 
By MATTHEW LOUGHRAN 
News Writer 
Oil companies have got to find a way to challenge the envi­ronmental movement in Amer­ica in a positive way, according to William Douglas Ford, the Executive Vice-President of American Oil Co. (Amoco). 
Ford, a 1966 graduate of Notre Dame who spoke yester­day in DeBartolo Hall, said that trying to find new ways to cre­ate a product in a market lim­ited and regulated by sensa­tionalist media and an ignorant public is a challenge to oil com­panies. Problems for the oil companies started with the release of "Silent Spring," a novel about environmental cat· astrophe in 1962. The media hype of this book set off a string of legislation resulting in the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Earth Day in 1970, the same year that Amoco began produc­ing unleaded gasoline, accord­ing to Ford. The legislation con­tinued every year from then on to produce stronger limits on the emissions of pollution by re­fineries. It has recently brought forth the Clean Air Act of 1990, the most expensive and limiting of all. Estimates by the EPA put the cost of cur­rent regulation at about 99 bil­lion dollars. It has been pro­jected that this cost will balloon to two hundred billion by the year 2000. 

Ford stated that many of these expensive regulations are not necessary, and he cited re­cent Amoco efforts as proof. "We tried a joint project with the EPA at a refinery in York­town, Virginia. We were able to drop costs because of site specific changes and scientifi­cally valid alternatives," he said. Among these alternatives are ethanol and compressed natural gas. Regulations by the EPA have forced many states to institute alternative fuel laws. Among these is a law which re­quires ethanol to be used in heavy smog areas, according to Ford. 
"Ethanol increases smog cre­ating chemicals," said Ford, "and we have research to back this up." Thus he indicates that the most efficient alternate source is compressed natural gas. 
Another problem the industry faces is the supply of misinfor­mation. "Often the media over­hypes things because villains and victims make good stories," said Ford. He also cited the fact that, "only about five per­cent of the population has the scientific knowledge to under­stand the data." These prob­lems give the environmental movement more power at the expense of the oil companies who also have to deal with unregulated competition in the Middle East. Ford said, "the best way for regulations to be met at a low cost to taxpayers and oil companies is for the oil companies to work in coopera­tion with the EPA to find new, scientifically valid ways to rid the world of pollution."

' drove up behind them. Two men jumped out of the car and took money from them. 
The individuals involved in that robbery were not appre­hended. 
However, the three incidents occurring last fall in the same area were solved when S.ecurity arrested two suspects on November 7, 1994, who confessed to all three robberies during police questioning. 
The robberies were all simi­lar in nature, involving male students walking alone in the area, with matching descrip­tions of the suspects by the vic­tims. 
Rakow did stress that stu­dents should still be extremely cautious when in the area, and to avoid walking in the vicinity if possible. 
"We would ask that students walk in groups or get a ride," he said, "or call Safe Walk and have them walk you to the edge of campus." 
"If you see a car with its en­gine idling or people standing around suspiciously, you might want to go a different route," he added.

"We are also trying to keep vehicles out of it," he said. "This is intended to be a pedes­trian zone." 
Although there will be an ef­fort to decrease cars on cam­pus, plans are underway for an increase in parking space to accommodate the new quad. 
According to Smith, 300 addi­tional parking spaces will be added to existing lots. 
Smith also mentioned the possibility of a new "hospitali­ty" area on the West Quad. He said that this may include a new bookstore/visitor center and a hoteVconference center. There is also speculation that The Morris Inn will be reno­vated for graduate student housing, according to Smith. 

Smith said that the develop­ment of the new quad was a main concern for the Univer­sity. 
"Two years ago, Father Mal­loy issued a colloquy for the year 2000, and all the needs and wants have been col­lected," Smith said. "Expansion made a lot of sense." 
The CLC also addressed the 
issue of on-campus dance 
space. Locations that have been 
investigated include The 
Knights of Columbus building 
which may be available, and the Architecture Building and The Center for Social Concerns, both of which will not be avail­able for dorm dances.

sued a trespass warrant and released, he added, which gives Security the right to pros­ecute for the charge. 
Chlebek said that Notre Dame, South Bend and St. Joseph County police had been contacted to see if the man was wanted on warrant for any­thing else. 
"The incident is still under investigation," he said.

Bomb death toll to pass 200 
By DAN SEWELL 
Associarcd Press 
OKlAHOMA CITY 

Searchers found the body of a Marine today, still in uniform and sitting at his desk in the ruined federal office building, and the White House said it feared the death toll might pos­sibly top 200. 
The hunt for more suspects in the bombing stalled as two leads that investigators were chasing overnight didn't pan out. White House ehief of staff 
Leon Panetta, speaking at The Associated Press annual meet­ing in New Orleans today, said it was possible the final toll might surpass 200. He said he based that on a report from federal emergency officials that 150 to 160 people were still missing and presumed to be "still within the building." It might be Saturday before all bodies were pulled out of the rubble, he said. Hopes of reach­ing the wreckage of a second­floor day care center were pushed back yet another day until Tuesday. Hansen said it would take workers with chain saws and jackhammers at least that long to remove a three­story high pile of rubble pan­caked on the area where the center had been. As the nation observed a day of mourning on Sunday, there was more bad news. Besides those killed in the bombing, another person, nurse Rebecca Anderson, 37. died Sunday from head injuries suffered trying to help after the blast. More than 400 were in­jured in the bombing.

As I sat in room 401 Le Mans Hall, I felt a part of the folklore tradition at Saint Mary's. It occurred to me that there may be some truth to the haunt­ing legends of this nineteenth-century dorm. This goes beyond late night tales of trick-or-treating gone bad, graveyard spirits and Christmases past. This is a story of two residents' per­sonal encounter with a ghost. 
It's a ritual for freshman to hear Saint Mary's imaginative folktales. These stories give students a plea­surable thrill. They create an identity within the dorm through imaginative

fantasy of the past. Yet, not all women regard the folktales as fiction. The women in room 401 confirm some folk­tales as fact. 
It goes back to first semester on a cbld November night. At precisely mid­night, Saint Mary's juniors, Maureen Bransfield and Michaela Corcoran were awakened by a loud banging noise. "It sounded as if someone had a hammer and was pounding on our ceil­ing," said Bransfield. Passing off the noise as pipes, the two ignored the dis­traction. That is until two nights later when the same occurrence happened again, then again, several nights later . 
It seemed that whenever Bransfield and Corcoran went to bed at the same time, after midnight, the noise began. Soon the noise turned from sporadic banging, into a rhythm with a gradual vibrato. "We called security when the banging formed a pattern," Bransfield said, "That's when we realized our

noise might be more than just the pipes." 
Then Saint Mary's security entered the scene. Equipped with walkie­talkies and flashlights, several security men investigated the crawl space above the top floor room. Still, the banging continued and a source for the noise could not be found. The pipes were silent and the space, free of rodents. 
Bransfield and Corcoran feared they were not living alone. Security was at a loss. And whenever the women went to bed, at the same time, after mid­night, the banging began. Soon Bransfield and Corcoran became locked into a nightly pattern of repeti­tion, believing they were dealing with something from the past. Naive ro­manticism, maybe. 
Stranger occurrences were yet to come. In December, Bransfield and Corcoran left their room at the same time to take showers. When they re­turned to their room, it was locked from the inside. The lock is a dead-bolt that can only be locked with a key from the outside. Both the women's keys were found by a Resident Director in­side the room. 
There is also the saga of the black glove. Bransfield had found a mysteri­ous glove on her dorm room floor. She left it there as she and Corcoran fell asleep. After a night of banging, the glove disappeared along with other ob­jects such as an angel pin and pendant made of Italian glass. 
Officially, Saint Mary's has declined to comment on the issue, but neither the college nor the women can find an explanation. Other women living on the fourth floor in LeMans believe there may be an answer-the man in denim overalls. 
For years, residents of the fourth floor have shared a concern about a certain presence, namely an elderly man who has been spotted roaming the halls. 
The man, whose identity is unknown, has been described as tall and lanky, with a pale complexion, dark circles under his eyes, and dirty light hair cut in a bowl shape. He has only been seen in a "milky" form, after midnight. I must clarify. no official documentation of this man exists on college records. 

The legend of the man in overalls is a 
tale of cultural inheritance.  A tale of  
the past, brought in as  a  possible  
explanation for the present.  With the  

banging that frequently occurs in room 401, this character has now gained recognition by some as a permanent resident of Le Mans Hall. 
Hypothetically speaking, lets say the banging is an act of this man. Overall, his haunting form appears to be rela­tively harmless. Neither Bransfield or Corcoran have been possessed. The ghost has not taken control of their ac­tions-so far there has been no sign of either going into convulsions, showing extraordinary strength, or yelling excessive curses. The only harm done has been a loss of sleep. Plus, Bransfield and Corcoran can prevent the noise by going to bed at separate times before midnight. 
The ghost of Le Mans is part of fourth floor culture, woven into the hall's folk­lore history. Looking beyond the belief of ghosts, it's important to note what this legend tells us about the women ofSaint Mary's. It shows the women have a sense of history, that they're concerned with holding on to the iden­tity of a dorm that is over a century old. The ghost keeps folklore tradition alive, which is not an easy trick. 
Next year I will live on the fourth floor in Le Mans. Perhaps I will have the privilege of encountering the man in denim overalls. This would enable me to experience the richness of Le Mans folklore legend not as fiction, but as fact.

hat makes your dorm the place that it is? Is it the structure itself? Or the num­
ber of people living in the dorm? Is it the rector and hall stall'? Or the friend­ly and hard-working housekeepers? 
After seventy years of experience, the men of Morrissey Manor would tell you that a dorm is all of the above and mueh more. Pew dorms on campus can c!aim a life as long as Morrissey's. And as the dorm celebrates its seventieth birthday this year, the entire campus ean take a glimpse into the character that makes the Manor the place that it is. This character arises from the com­bination of the building, traditions, and residents. 
Built in 1925 as a dorm for sopho­mores, Morrissey Manor was one of three buildings referred to as the "Gold Coast" at the time. Morrissey, like Howard llall and Lyons llall, was very unique architecturally. According to rector Joe Boss, CSC, this unique architecture is one of the many things that makes the Manor the dorm that it is. 
Morrissey's Gothic design includes a square tower rising through the cen­ter of the dorm with a copper cross in one corner, a trait the dorm shares with the law school building. The bal­cony above the front entrance is much like that of a medieval manor, and a Latin inscription above the balcony proclaims that the Manor is a house of God. In addition, the east and west exteriors of the building sport copper­framed windows, and the stonework on the tower and chapel walls pro­claims the Christian nature of the dorm with carvings of fish, pelicans, crosses, and the sacred heart of Jesus. 
Named after Reverend Andrew Morrissey, CSC, President of the University at the turn of the century, the hall is alive with character inside as well. The lobby consists of wooden panels, including several painted with the seals of the schools of Oxford and Cambridge, and a fireplace. Sitting in the lobby, one can almost hear the voices of the many young men who have spent time conversing there over the years. The Morrissey chapel also seems to be a special place. Dedicated to Saint Therese, the chapel, with its noticeable lack of chairs, promotes the idea of family. The cross found in the chapel was designed by well-known Notre Dame artist Ivan Mestrovic. 
Traditions are taken seriously by the residents of Morrissey Manor. Whether old or new, traditions passed down from class to class are important in promoting dorm unity and furthering the sense of community that already exists in Morrissey. Some of the older traditions include the Breakfast Club, Film Pest, and Christmas SYR. Every football season, the residents of Morrissey gather for cereal and song at Breakfast Club on the morning of the first home game. The Christmas SYH is undoubtedly Morrissey's pre­mier social event every year. 
Some of the newer traditions unique to the Manor include the Polar Run and Morrissey Unplugged. The Polar Hun, a mile dash around campus in February wearing only shorts, was begun several years ago to raise money for the Beeler!Hipp scholarship fund. This year, the residents of Morrissey ran to raise money for the newly established Joe Claussen Memorial Scholarship fund. Morrissey Unplugged, an evening of music by mostly Morrissey performers, occurs at least once a semester. This past week­end marked the first time this event was held outside. 
Morrissey resident Dominic Tocci explains, "The traditions we have here in the Manor are what makes living here great. The rooms are small and there is no air conditioning, but we are comfortable here. Morrissey is always a place where an individual can feel at home." 
A tradition of service also exists in Morrissey. The dorm has a long­standing relationship with St. Hedwig's Outreach Center, a place for children on the west side of South Bend. Morrissey men visit the center every Monday and Thursday to provide sup­port for the kids there. Many 
Manorites also choose to do service on their own or after they graduate. T y I e r Farmer, a senior resi­dent of Morrissey, is planning on teaching in the South next year as a partici­pant in the Alliance for Catholic Education program. This spirit of service that exists in 

Everything you never wanted to know about yeast infections 
By JOHN GALVIN Accent Medical Writer 
Morrissey seems to improve the spiri­tual life of most residents of the dorm. 
While the buildings and traditions certainly have a lot to do with the iden­tity of the dorm, the people of Morrissey are what really makes the place unique. Morrissey men are all about community. Morrissey men are all about family. 330 men come togeth­er every year and form a family of fun, a family of support, but most of all, a family of God. 
Never was this more apparent than over Christmas break when 1994 grad­uate Joe Claussen, a former resident of Morrissey, died from injuries suffered in a train accident. The word about his death spread quickly, and soon Joe was in everyone's thoughts and prayers, even those residents who had not known him well. This Sunday, the Morrissey community will come together as a family and honor Joe with the dedication of a bench and tree in his name in front of the dorm. 
The Morrissey community has been blessed with strong and caring leaders over the years. During the 1960s, Morrissey was often perceived as the center of the anti-war movement on campus, with rectors Father Bortell, Father Burrell, and Father Gerber leading the way. Father Bob Pelton, rather Charlie Corey, and Father Tom Streit, now a missionary in Haiti, spent time as able leaders of the Manor in the past. Father Joe Ross is currently rector of Morrissey, a position for which he has proven himself very tal­ented. Father Pat Gaffney of the Anthropology department is a welcome addition to the dorm as a priest in resi­dence. 

rrissey is proud of the di­
ersity of its residents. 
espect for others is stressed in the dorm's unique living agreement "Life in the Manor." This includes respect for all races, religions, and orientations at all times. 
Perhaps sophomore Angela Cataldo sums it up best when she says, "While Morrissey has a strong sense of family, it is not an exclusive family. The peo­ple who live in Morrissey readily accept newcomers." 
Indeed, Morrissey's diversity, many different people brought together into one community, is one of the many keys to the character it possesses today. 
Forget the stories about haunted towers and rats in the basement. Morrissey is obviously a place where a community of believers live together, study together, and compete together. What is important to the men who live in Morrissey is the camaraderie that won this year's Fisher Regatta or last year's Interhall Football championship. And that is what being a dorm at Notre Dame is all about. 
So, next time you look at your dorm, think about the many things that give your dorm character. Think about the traditions, the people who have come before you, and the people who will come for years after you to inhabit the place you now call home. 
H
ave you ever had a sore throat, swollen joints, irritability, constipa· tion, fatigue, headache, athlete's foot, or just an itch? Well, chances are, you've had some sort of yeast infection. But don't worry, yeast is our friend. 
Yeast occurs naturally in our bodies, in balance with the rest of our Internal flora and fauna. Strictly speaking, yeast are a member of the plants known as fungi or molds. Given the right conditions for replication, yeast has the dangerous risk of explosive growth (like when bread rises). A mildly acidic environment can trigger such an outbreak. Slightly acidic places include the mouth, throat, foot, intestine, or genitals. An infection in the mouth and throat is called Thrush. An infection on the feet is called athlete's foot, and a genital outbreak is called a yeast infection. 
Genital infection is the most common case of infection. Specifically, the vulvar and vaginal environment is a preferred domain for yeast replication. The symp~ toms which signal an infection include redness, itching, and a whitish. clumpy discharge. For women with recurrent yeast infection, the symptoms tend to flare at the same time during each men­strual cycle. Some women have burning urination and painful intercourse. 
If you think you are breeding some yeast, don't be so sure. Occasionally, yeast infections mask other infections, or may mirror other vaginal problems. So, don't diagnose it yourself, go to a provider or Health Services and get a cul· ture done. 
If you suspect any kind of infection, immediately act to protect yourself and others. If diagnosed with a genital or oral infection, it is essential to n'ltify those with whom you have intimate contact. If contained, yeast infection is very treat­able. Most cases will disappear with over­the-counter topical ointment or medica­tion. 
Here are protective measures you can take to prevent yourself from an infection or a recurrence of infection: 
•Wear 
flip-flops in the shower . 

•Rinse 
skin with plain water frequently. 


•Use 
mild soap when showering (Neutrogena, Basis, Pears, Dove). 

•Use 
natural oils for sexual intercourse (Astroglide). 

•Use 
100% cotton underwear, and do not wear pantyhose, tights or other tight fitting clothes 


Dietary changes also help prevent a recurrence of yeast infection: 
•Drink eight ounces of unsweetened cranberry juice every day. (acidities sys· 
tern) 
•Cut 
down on your simple sugar intake 


•Cut 
down on your eafTeine intake (cof· fee, tea, pop, chocolate). 

•Cut 
down on alcohol intake. 


•Drink 
a lot of unsweetened liquids (herbal tea, juice, water ... etc.).

Olympics next for NBA's winningest coach 
By ED SHEARER 
Associated Press 

ATLANTA 
Lenny Wilkens wasn't invit­ed to try out for the Olympics in 1960. On Monday, he was invited to coach the team at the 1996 Atlanta Games. 
The announcement, rumored for months, came at the end of an NBA regular­season in which Wilkens moved ahead of Red Auerbach to top the NBA list for coaching victories. 
"I do look forward to participating in this huge event," the Atlanta Hawks coach said. "Certainly, being an assistant coach on the 1992 team whetted my appetite to do it. It's just a tremendous honor." 
USA Basketball president 
C.M. Newton said three assis­tant coaches will be chosen in June -one from the NBA .and two from college -and the first group of players will be picked in late July or early August. 
called the end of his college career with the Friars when he was the MVP in the NIT, but wasn't invited to try out for the Olympic team. 
"It was a big disap­pointment at the time," he said. "Every youngster in col­lege would have loved to be on the Olympic team. I never thought much about it later." 
Wilkens will have input in completing his staff and se­lecting the players for the '96 Games, but Newton said the same committee that picked Wilkens the USA Basketball men's senior national team committee ­will make the final determi­nation. 
"We're committed to select­ing the best team," Newton said. "It probably will be all NBA players, but it will truly be open to every player in the nation." 
Magic Johnson, the former NBA star who played on the 1992 gold medal team after revealing he had HIV, has said he would like to be on the 1996 team as well. 

West looks best in playoff race 
By WENDY E. LANE 
Associated Press 

For the second straight year, the Seattle SuperSonics could get bounced out of the playoffs in the first round. So could the defending NBA champions. 
The toughest road to the NBA Finals is the one leading from the West, where four of the league's five best teams play. 
There's the San Antonio Spurs, who at 62-20 have the league's best record, and the Utah Jazz, who won 60 and fin­ished the season with a seven­game winning streak. Both are having the best seasons in fran­chise history, and despite a his­tory of playoff failures are con­sidered the teams to beat. 
But not the only teams. 

"I definitely think it's the best and most even situation I think I've ever been around," SuperSonics coach George Karl said. "There's going to be some great basketball played here and a lot of close, intense series." 
The intensity starts Thursday with Seattle's opening-round set with the Los Angeles Lakers, who return to the post­season after staying home last year for the first time since 1976. 
A late-season stumble by the Sonics not only cost them a sec­ond consecutive Pacific Division title, it dropped them to the No. 4 seed and into a bracket with the team no one in the confer­ence wanted to play. 
The surprising young Lakers beat the Sonics in four close games before Seattle ended the season series with a 16-point victory at the Forum on April 
18. Karl calls it a "nervous matchup" for his team, which entered the playoffs last year with the NBA's best record only to lose in five games to eighth seed Denver. 
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich doesn't blame Karl for being nervous. 
"You look at the four teams with the home court advantage -San Antonio, Phoenix, Utah and Seattle -and they are all solid teams," Tomjanovich said. "But I believe no one can take the Los Angeles Lakers lightly." 
The sixth-seeded Rockets have their own difficult matchup to worry about. To 
avoid becoming the first NBA champion to lose in the first round since Philadelphia was eliminated in the opening set of the 1984 playoffs, Houston must find a way to stop Karl Malone and the Jazz. 
Utah, which has the No. 3 seed in the first round, holds a 3-2 series edge and twice de­feated the Rockets by at least 19 points. 
"Being an underdog doesn't disturb me," Tomjanovich said, "because I know the competi­tive nature of our team and be­cause of the great experience we had last year, I'm confident we will be very competitive." 
Despite recent injuries, the Rockets take confidence from Utah's relative lack of playoff experience. The Jazz have never gotten past the confer­ence finals, where they were sent home by Houston last year in five games. 
"They're the world champs," Utah's John Stockton said. "They earned it. It's unfortu­nate we have to open against them. It's a tall order because the home court advantage is not that great in a five-game series."

The answer to the test que~tlon 
1-800-KAP-TEST 
By LORI GADDIS Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's softball sea­son is slowly winding down. The Belles have decided to restate their goals for the rest of the season in the hopes of bettering their record through its duration. 
Saint Mary's came off of a disappointing weekend, falling to North Central College in both games of their double header on Sunday with scores of 1-0 and 6-2. 
Saint Mary's seemed to fall into a slump at the plate and made some mental errors that prevented them from defeating North Central. Senior left fielder Seanne Patrick led the Belles by hitting 2-2 in the first game, including a triple and a single. Patrick scored both runs, one of which was off of a sacrifice hit by junior first baseman Laura Richter. 
Senior April Rhoades went 2­3 in the second game against North Central. But it was not enough for the Belles to add two wins to their record. 
The Belles felt that they were somewhat sluggish at the plate, a problem they have struggled with several times throughout the season. "We were in a hit­ting slump and made too many mental errors," junior short­stop Shannon Heise stated. "We really need to focus on basic fundamentals and finish the season on a good note." Saint Mary's has seven games remaining on their schedule, including,match-ups against Kalamazoo College, Calvin College and a rescheduled game against cross-town rival Bethel College. 
The Belles had a team meet­ing to try to determine exactly what was needed to complete the season victoriously. 
"We will continue to play tough teams the rest of the season," Patrick said. "We are physically capable of perform­ing well, but I think much of the problem is mental. We need to start having fun and the rest will come." 
Freshman Debbie Dziekan voiced her opinion about the team's last few games. "I real­ly think that we have a great mental attitude. But we really need to come out these last few games. I am confident we can do it, but it will take effort on every one's part." 
The Belles will begin their journey down that path when they take on Kalamazoo College on Tuesday at 3:30 in Kalamazoo.

• WOMEN'S TENNIS 
Despite loss, NCAA hopes alive 
By TIM SHERMAN 
Associate Sports Editor 
Second chances don't come along very often in the world of athletics. Usually, it's do or dje. 
Fortunately for the Irish women's tennis squad, such was not the case on Sunday. Notre Dame died, but the quirky thing is, they may still have life. 
In a match that probably would have secured an auto­matic bid to the NCAA Tournament, the Irish fell to 25th ranked Indiana in Bloomington by a rather lop­sided 6-3 count. 
"We just didn't play very well," Irish coach Jay Louderback said. "We strug­gled, especially in our singles play." 
Notre Dame won just two of the six singles matches against refPonal rival Indiana. Junior All-American Wendy Crabtree (no. 1) and senior captain Laura Scwab (no. 3) provided the only two singles points. 
"We really dug ourselves a hole with our poor play in the singles," Louderback noted. "I'm just glad we played better in the doubles." 
Even the improvement was not enough though, as just the team of Crabtree and classmate Holyn Lord was able to emerge victorious, as they swept Rachel Epstein/Megan

Intensity up as field goes down 
By DOMINIC AMOROSA 
Sports Writer 
In NCAA Basketball, teams compete all season to reach a tournament referred to as March Madness. At Notre Dame, Bookstore Basketball teams play three or four games to reach the round of 64. Now, games are played with referees in front of hostile crowds. The large crowds become attracted to underdogs, but the favorites tend to step up their game. Ranked teams might finally be challenged as Bookstore's Road to the Final Four at Stepan gets serious today. 
"Now the tournament gets competitive," said Bryan Corbett of no. 2 seed Rebel Alliance. "Every game will be a battle and the concentration levels will be a lot higher. These types of games deter­mine who is going to be there in the end." 
"Teams will need more skill instead of brute force," added Jean Joseph of no. 5 seed Pink Sky in the Morning. "The ref­erees come into play and teams won't be able to get away with anymore funny business." 
A 558 team field has dwin­died down to sixty four. The winners of these games will advance to the round of 32 and be guaranteed a seed next year if three players remain on the team. However, many of the ranked teams are senior domi­nated and play for the moment. 
Some of these teams rely on size and strength, while others need speed and quickness to compete at this level. Some of the teams press full court, while others walk the ball up and pound it inside. Others don't even feel like they belong at all. 
"We put our team together to have a good time," commented Vanilla Thunder's Brian Ford. "We're looking forward to the game, but I don't think we're that good." 
Ford's squad, led by offensive tackle Chris Clevenger, will face no. 10 Malicious Prosecution in the last game of the night at 
11:00 PM. 
Teams win Bookstore Basketball games with strong defense and timely baskets. Great players create awe among the spectators, but teams win basketball games. 
"Which ever team can run and play the best defense will win it," said Kerbdog's Davide Delgrande. "It will be physically tougher with all of the athletes competing." 
"You have to play tough de­fense to win Bookstore," echoed Corbett. "You can't rely on comebacks in the second half as much because the com­petition is better." 
Sweeter Than Candy, a sec­ond sixteen team, relies more on outside shooting and fast­breaks than a physical pres­ence. 
"Size is a big factor," ex­plained Colin Rittgers of Sweeter. "We need to compen­sate with fast-breaks and team play." 
Yesterday, no. 6 seed DOS KLOSKAS found out what it's like at this level. In a game de­fined by physical play, KLOSKAS clawed away from Voodoofreaks 21-17 to be the first team in the field of 32. 
The guard brother tandems of Mike and Jeff Kloska versus Voodoofreaks' Chris and Benji Hammond ended in a standoff, but KLOSKAS size on the inside made the difference in the game. 


Irish net last MCC championship 
ByB.J. HOOD 
Sports Writer 
The shorthanded Notre Dame men's tennis team claimed its seventh MCC championship over the week­end. Despite the absence of five key players, the Irish won five of the six singles matches and one of the three doubles matches. 
"I think everyone came to­gether," J akub Pietrowski said. "We had some guys missing, and we went out and got the job done." 
At number one singles, Mike Sprouse defeated Northern Illinois Sunu Thomas 6-0, 6-3 to claim the title. After defeating Butler's Nathan Schaffner, John Jay O'Brien was bested by Marty Engel of Northern Illinois in the number two match, 6-1, 6-2. 
Jakub Pietrowski defeated Northern Illinois's Peter Berka 6-2, 6-3 for the number three singles title. At number four singles, Steve Flanigan was victorious over Wisconsin-Green Bay's Willie Cakans 6-7, 6-1, 6-3. 
Ron Mencias had a great weekend at number five sin­gles, with two 6-0, 6-0 victo­ries. Andy Chmura claimed the number six singles title with a victory over Mark McGrew of Northern Illinois 6-2, 6-3. 
The tandem of Sprouse and Pietrowski won number one doubles. Freshmen Danny Rothschild and Christian Jordan won third place for the Irish at number two dou­bles, and junior Marco Magnano and freshmen Vijay Freeman also took third at number three doubles. 
The final standings of the ten teams had Notre Dame at number one, followed by Northern Illinois, Butler, and Wisconsin Green Bay. 
Sprouse, Pietrowski, Flanigan, Mencias, and Chmura were named to the All-MCC team. On being named to the team, Pietrowski said, "It was a great honor. It will be my only chance to play in the MCC (because of the move to the Big East)." 
Pietrowski said he feels ev­eryone is playing well and fo­cusing on regionals that take place the first weekend of May, which will be the next action for the Irish. "Everyone just needs to try to play their best. On any given day, any team can win."
