Continental Airlines resumed some of its flights at discount rates Tuesday three days after going to bankruptcy court, while a union leader denied claims hy Eastern Airlines that it must chop wages by 15 percent to avoid Continental's fate. 
The first Continental DC-9 took off from Houston in the fog at 7:31 
a.m. with six passengers aboard. Billie Tafelski, who checked in the passengers for the flight, said she wished she had .their addresses "so I could write them a thank you let­
ter." 
Pilots were working at less than half salary and the airline was flying to fewer than one-third of its pre­vious destinations. Only 35 percent ofits 12,000 employees were on the job. 
Continental on Saturday filed for protection from creditors while it reorganizes under Chapter I I of federal bankruptcy laws. It cited $471.9 million losses since January 1979 and blamed low-cost competi­tion, reservations systems con­trolled by two other carriers and labor costs. 
The Houston-based airline, once the nation's eighth largest, offered S49 one-way fares on domestic flights until Friday, and after a slow start Tuesday morning, travelers began queuing up for the cut-rate tickets. 
"We'r having to go roundabout but we'll get to spend some time in 
San Francisco," said Michael Gerlich of Houston. He and a companion, Connie Harrison, also of Houston, were planning to travel from Hous­ton to Portland, Ore., one of78 cities Continental served until Saturday ·when it trimmed its destinations to 
25. 
On Monday, Eastern Airlines 
Chairman Frank Borman said in a 
videotaped message that without 
across-the-board pay cuts, the 
Miami-based carrier will he forced 
to go to bankruptcy court or cease 
operations altogether. 
But Charles Bryan president ofthe 
13,000 member union of Eastern 
machinists, said: "we do not accept 
his doomsday remedy." 
"We've done extensive research 
at Eastern Airlines and they're not 
about to go bankrupt," Bryan said. 
"The only reason they would go bankrupt is if they did it the same as (President Frank) Lorenzo at Con­tinental to destroy the unions," he said. "The company is not in that bad ofshape." 
Bryan suggested Eastern boost 
revenues by limiting discount fares. 
Eastern spokesman Tom Myers said, "We're not going to debate. The tape will do all our talking." 
Eastern lost S I 06 million during

The questions continue 
Perhaps this column is overdue ... 
After watching Notre Dame get abused on national television Saturday night, and realizing that the Irish have lost five of their last six games, many people are asking some probing questions. 
Why? Why is it that a football program that has had three of the best recruiting years in NCAA history (according to the experts) has gone 12-12-1 over the past three seasons? When dozens ofParade high school All-Americans are assembled, shouldn't they at least be able to stay above the .500 mark? 
Why is it that a program that was one win away from a national championship in 1980 has literally fallen apart? Were John Scully, Scott Zettek, Tom Gibbons and Pete Holohan (the four starters who graduated after the 9·2­1 1980 campaign) so valuable that the team's record should fall to 5-6 the following season? 
Why is it that a team with the benefit of some of the greatest coaching minds in the college ranks looks so disorganized week after 
week? 
And, finally, the crucial question -is it time that Father Joyce admits that he made a mistake? 
When Dan Devine an­nounced his resignation in August, 1980, speculation about the identity of Notre Dame's next coach came from all over the country. People like Don Shula, Joe Restic and George Welsh were nominated. We even heard that Lou Holtz was in­terested. 
But what everyone didn't know was that, in the eyes of 
the only man who counted, there was only one man for the job. And so, after a couple of months of toying with the media, Father Joyce announced that Gerry Faust would be Notre Dame's next head coach. 
As everyone knows, Faust took the campus by storm. He visited every dorm, male and female. He played fris­bee with the students. He ate pizza with the students. Everyone loved him. Compared to Dan Devine, he looked like Knute Rockne. In fact, people (including Digger Phelps) started comparing him to Rockne. All of this before he ever led the Irish onto the field. 
Now, three years and 25 games later, Faust would be lucky to have the respect that Dan Devine had on campus. The mystique, the luster, the enthusiasm has all worn off. That sort ofthing happens when a team loses. 
Students and alumni are tired ofhearing about a great school, about a great student body, about a great tradi­tion. They want to hear about some great wins. 
Coach Faust's first dorm appearance came at Morris­sey Hall. Anticipating, like everyone else, that Faust was

destined for greatness under the Dome, I tape-recorded the speech, which quickly turned into an impromptu pep rally. 
When asked what the most important job a football coach must do, Faust had a concise answer. Keeping the team on an even course, he said, is the most important thing a coach can do. A team won't be successful if it's psyched up for only a few teams on its schedule, he said. The object is not to get too high for the good teams and not too low for the poor teams. 
But now, in assessing the 

year. quickly 
ended each season. 
Not only have Faust teams been unable to rebound from disappointing losses, they have been unable to rebound from big wins. 
Obviously, something has been wrong with the Notre Dame football team for the past three seasons. Some people suggest an attitude problem. I disagree, but even if that argument is accepted, the finger still points at one man. Ifthe coach can't motivate the team, who can? 
However, don't look for Father Joyce to swallow his pride and ask Faust to resign ifthese problems continue. The image Faust portrays is everything that Notre Dame wants in a coach. To remove him from the job would be tantamount to admitting that winning is everything at Notre Dame. And as Father Hesburgh makes perfectly clear whenever he gets the chance, winning is not everything at Notre Dame. 
Or, at least, it's not supposed to be. 
problems of the past few seasons, one glaring fact shines through -·Faust teams have been incredibly inconsistent. 
In each of the three seasons, the Irish have posted highly impressive and enthusiastic victories in the opener, only to encoun­ter a myriad of problems thereafter. LSU in 1981, Michigan under the lights in 
1982, and Purdue in 1983 were all indicative of the wealth of talent the Irish possesed. Talk of a national championship was rampant each But it

Computer snooper caught 
Associated Press 
STILLWATER, Okla. -A student who raided a computer that operates a university message hoard and threatened to make it display "anything we please" was lured into a trap with the promise of more computer codes, authorities say. 
"I got pretty scared there," said Sean K. Riddle, 18, a freshman at Ok­lahoma State University who was ar­rested at a pay telephone in the lohhy of his dormitory. 
Riddle is accused of using his home computer to gain access to a computer and enter messages that could have wound up on a display at a husy Stillwater intersection. 
"You thought 'WarGames' was a movie, hut it is a reality," read one message. Another warned, "There:: is no way to catch us." 
Riddle, an electrical engineering major from Oklahoma City, was ar­rested in the lohhy of his dormitory Sept. 20, the day after school officials noticed the cryptic messages on their computer screens. 
He pleaded innocent to unlawful procurement of telecommunica­tions services and larceny of com­puter time, hoth misdemeanors, and was released on S500 hond pending an Oct. 26 preliminary hearing.

Reagan says he would seek accord 
AsNOciated Press 
WASIIIN<iTON President Reagan said Tuesday he would ask for congressional approval of any substantial expansion in the role of 
U.S. troops in Lebanon and would seek agreement with Congress if he think~ they must stay for more than 
IH months. 
Reagan gave the assurances to anxious congressional leaders in a letter designed to calm fears that the adminiMr;ttion may not live up to its end of tht compromise struck with Congress. 
Tl10~e fears were aroused when Secretary oft State <ieorgc P. Shultz refused to tell a congressional panel what the administration plans to do wirh the troops after 18 months. 
The compromise, which Reagan has said he will sign with reserva­tions, is scht·dulcd for a vote Wed­nesday or Thursday in the Senate. Majority Leader Howard II. Baker Jr., R-Tcnn., has predicted it will he ap­proved after a possible close vote on a move to reduce the 18-month period. 
It will tht·n move to the House, where tht· deeply divided Democratic majority met in closed session on the issue Tuesday with­out reaching agrecmt·nt. 
The: compromise recognizes that a timetable: for removal ofthe troops h;ts been triggert·d under provisions ofthc 197:~ War Powers Act because tht· troops arc in a hostile situation. In return li>r this, it authorizes the administration to keep the I,600 Marines at their peal·ckecping posts t<>r up to a year and a halt:

other concessions later. 
But labor is adjustable and most 
airlines have taken steps to bring 
costs down. Continental's petition

most radical, hut some analysts say it

Eastern Airlines, which lost $94.4 million in the first half of the year, has demanded that all its employees take a I '; percent pay cut or the airline may have to shut down, or file for h;lnkruptcy protection. 
Frank Borman, the Eastern chair­man, has frequently asked his employees for concessions. "Whether this is the time he means it or not, I don't know," said Patricia Fink, h:adt·r of the flight attendants' union, which has an Oct. 12 strike deadline. 
Other airlines have sought similar concessions, hut they have tended to result more from negotiations rather than ultimatum. 
At Western Airlines, for example, all of its five major unions have ap­proved a I 0 percent pay cut, along with a stock ownership and profit­sharing plan. 
Many ofthe new airlines, general­ly non-union operations, began with higher employee productivity from the start. 
When a People Express pilot is not flying, for instance, he may serve as dispatcher, work in marketing and recruiting, or handle some other ad­ministrative chore.

Miss Manners 
The well-mannered toddler 
by Judith Martin 
I)ersonally, Miss Manners has always believed that the purpose of r summertime leisure was to allow her to lie back against the cus­hions of the porch swing and ruminate, while everyone else ran about for their health, being sporty. 
In principle, she has nothing against the idea ofusing the time for self-improvement, ifonly she could think ofsomething to improve. Others may certainly do so, and children probably should. So you would think, given Miss Manners' crusading spirit when she begins to think, in the fall, that she would be pleased beyond measure to hear ofAmerican children having spent their summers attending eti­
quette camp. 
Indeed she was, at first. With all her heart, she believes that man­ners must be taught by parents to their children, 14 hours a day (nine hours for sleep, and no shouting instructions to them while they're in the bathroom) in order to be effective. But she has also noticed that there is a lot ofremedial work to be done, and is heartily grateful for all assistance in this noble effort. 
Imagine her horror, however, when she found out some ofthe 
things that were being taught at the etiquette camps. There was one story about 3-year-olds having been trained to kiss ladies' hands -tune to invest money in it. So in the song, "It's sick but I like it." The

Michigan State, is out for the season. The junior that he broke last year against Purdue. See story fullback suffered a fracture in the same ankle belowfor more details. 
Bell is out for remainder of season 
The playing days of junior Greg Bell could be over. The Irish fullback fractured his ankle in last Saturday night's loss to Miami, and he will be out for the season. 
"I feel really bad for Greg," said Irish coach Gerry Faust. "After everything that has happened to him, you just have to feel for him." 
Bell broke his right ankle last season against Purdue sidelining him for the rest of the campaign. This year's injury is a cracked bone just below the 1982 break. 
Bell sustained the injury just before the end of the first half, though he did see action in the se­cond half returning kicks. He end­ed the game with only four yards on four carries against the Hur­ricanes. 
The severity of the injury was not discovered until after extensive x­rays were done on Monday. 
In other games this season, Bell racked up four touchdowns against Purdue and then added 114 yards to the loss to Michigan State. 
An economics major in the Col­lege of Arts and Letters, Bell could opt to graduate this May. He has a year of eligibility left after being red-shirted last year. 
The 6-0, 210-pound Columbus, Ohio native was the fastest member of the Notre Dame team. He was clocked at 4.4 in the 40-yard dash. 
The loss of Bell means two things to the Irish backfield. First, sophomore Allen Pinkett who previously shared playing time with Bell will bear the b runt of the rushing responsibilities. And two, freshmen Hiawatha Fransisco and Byron abraham will compete for the No. 2 spot. 
Non-varsity office introduces new Century Club for physical fitness 
By JEFF BLUMB 
Sports Writer 
Under the theme "Fitness for everyone," Non-Varsity Athletics has created a new organization devoted to the promotion of health, fitness, and personal exercise pro­grams. This organization, known as Century Club, provides informa­tion, support, and encouragement to all persons in the Notre Dame­Saint Mary's community who wish to have their own personal exercise program. 
"We are trying to encourage health and fitness," says Sally Derengowski, Coordinator of Recreational Services. "But we are also trying to provide for those who already exercise and to encourage those who are not." 
One aspect of Century Club will be to help those persons who have exercised infrequently or not a! all in the past, and sho would now like to set up a personal exercise pro­gram with no commitment involv­ed. 
"We call it a club, but it is really closer to a service," says Derengowski. "We are trying to create a club low on committment and high on resources," she con­tinued. "There will only be as much structure as you like." 
Century Club is also for those people who would like to add a bit more organization and structure to their present individual exercise programs. 
"The club can be a complement to one's own individual program," says Derengowski, "because we have a lot of information and resources to help you run a better exercise program. Eventually we hope to have a resource center of fitness literature. 
"By providing log cards and keeping a progress chart in the fieldhouse we hope to add organization," said Derengowski. 
But Century Club entails more than log cards and progress charts. 
In addition, the club offers maps showing routes and distances for jogging and bicycling; performance sheets to record daily workouts; group workout times for interested persons; t-shirts for those in-

Can the Irish stand up to the Buffaloes? 

Irish Items 
Hello again, everybody! 
This week Notre Dame takes the advice of Horace Greeley to "Go West" and take on the Colorado Buffaloes in Boulder. Originally, this game was looked at as a cakewalk for Notre Dame by many experts, but now that the Irish have lost five of their last six outings the viewpoint has changed dramatically. Gerry Faust and the Irish must regroup and retain their own confidence, as well as the confidence of the student body. It won't be an easy task, as the Buffaloes are 2-1 and would like to stampede the Irish before the home folks. 
Rocky Mountain Lows ... Ifyou think the Irish have had things bad during the last few years, you won't get any sympathy from Colorado fans. In 1979, Colorade made Chuck Fairbanks one of the highest paid coaches in college football in hopes he would turn the program around. Chuck coached more like Douglas Fair­banks, guiding the Buffaloes to a 7-26 record in three years. Exit Chuck Fairbanks, and enter Bill McCartney, former defensive assistant at Michigan. McCartney led the Buffaloes to a dismal 2­8 record a year ago, but has already equaled that victory total this season. Unfortunately, Colorado has Nebraska and Oklahoma in their conference, which means the only way the Buffaloes will be at the top of the Big Eight is if they list the teams alphabetically. 
A Word About Astroturf ... Since this is the first of three con­secutive games the Irish will play on Astroturf, it seems a good time to make a few comments about this surface. It seems strange a state as renowned for its natural beauty as Colorado would have a stadium with a synthetic surface. Be that as it may, you won't hear any complaints from Notre Dame. The Irish have had great success on Astroturf, losing only twice since 1978 in stadiums with carpet. In fact, some of the greatest Notre Dame wins in recent years ('78 Cotton Bowl, '80 vs. Alabama, '82 vs. Pitt) have come on Astroturf. 
In the Buffs ...For the fourth week in a row, the Irish will face a team that likes to move the ball through the air. Junior quarter­back Steve Vogel has improved his consistency this season, com­pleting 37 of 67 passes this season. He has three fine receivers in tight end Dave Hestera, split and Loy Alexander, and wingback Ron Brown, who had a big day in last week's 38-17 win over Oregon State. 
On the ground, the Buffaloes look to either junior fullback Lee Rouson or sophomore halfback Chris McLemore. Both backs have already had 100-yard games this year, and both backs love to dish out punishment. 
On defense, the Buffs sport an outstanding secondary, spearheaded by All-American cornerback Victor Scott. Scott is rated highly by pro scouts, and is a sure bet to go quickly in the draft. He is supported by two fine inside linebackers, Barry Rem­ington (38 tackles) and Terry Irvin (44 stops). The weak spot in the Colorado defense is the front line, where the Buffaloes are inex­perienced. So ... 
Guess What the Irish Will Do? ... Somewhere Woody Hayes is smiling broadly. Notre Dame has brought "three yards and a cloud of dust" back to college football. Allen !Pinkett should run a marathon against Colorado, but with Greg Bell out for the year with an ankle injury, fullbacks Chris Smith and Mark Brooks will have to pick up the slack. Blair Kiel will get the starting nod at quarterback, despite an impressive performance by freshman signal-caller Steve Beuerlein last week against Miami. Kiel will have to shoulder the responsibility of getting the Irish passing game back on track. Another problem for the Irish has been penalties--25 in three contests is way too many. 
It may sound like a recording, but would someone please wake up the pass defense. Bernie Kosar is still waiting to see an Irish lineman, and the secondary has seen more passes that a USC cheerleader. A shoulder injury to Joe Johnson does not help mat­ters. The situation must improve by Saturday or Vogel will have a field day. 
Buffalo Chips ... Former Notre Dame All-American Gerry DiNardo is now an assistant coach with Colorado ... Last week was the first time the Buffs posted back-to-back wins since 1979 ... This is the first meeting between the Irish and Colorado ... Add Milt Jackson to the injury list. The Fairfield, Iowa sophomore was seen hobbling with a heavily bandaged leg yesterday.

Pick of the Week ... After getting off tQ a 2-0 start, one can't deny the Irish cross country team of Coach Joe Piane is worthy of being this week's "Pick of the Week". The Irish harriers will try to capture the title in the National Catholic Invitational at beautiful Burke Memorial Golf Course this Friday at 4:00p.m. 
The Irish have finished second to Marquette for the last three years but this looks like the year Piane's runners may dethrone the Warriors. A solid starting five, led by co-captains Tim Cannon and Andy Dillon have been impressive in dual meet wins over Ohio State and Northwestern. With the return of freshman phenom Mike Collins from a leg injury, the Irish will be at full strength and raring to go.
