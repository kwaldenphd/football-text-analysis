No new director for 0-C 
By MICHELE DIETZ 
StaffReporter 
<>ff-Campus Housing will not get a 

nc.·w full-time director, according to 
Stmknt Body President Don Murday 
in his address to the Student Senate 
last night. 
The Campus Life Council passed the Student Senate proposal for a full-time director two weeks ago. Fr. John Van Wolvlear, vice president for Student Activities, however, makes the final decision, and rt•jectc.·d the proposal. Fr. Van Wolvlear sent a kttc.~ to the Senate saying he disagrees with a full-time director, that a part-time director Is sufficient, and that the present situa­tion will be improvc.·d. 
The main point Van Wolvlear hrought against the proposal was the insufficient amount of work warranting a full-time position. Bro. Edward Luther will finish the rest of the school year in his present capacity as part-time Off-Campus Housing Director. A new part-time director will be appointed over the summer. 
According to Murday, the Student Senate will not sit idle. "If the new director can fill the re4uiremc1Us of the joh on a part-time basis, fine, but I don't think he can do it. Our best course of action is to show the Uni­versity that this is a full-time position hy coming up wth some concrete ideas so they can implement them." 
Another topic discussed by the Senate was the formation of a Com­mittee on Tenure. The purpose of the committee is to thoroughly study the tenure process focusing on the student's perspective. This will entail researching the validity of the claim that "puhlishing is· more important than teaching ifone wants to be tenured." 
The goal ofthe committee will be

Fr. John Van Wolvlcar, vicu-presi­dent for Student Activitit:s decided that a full time Off-Campus Housing Director will not be appointed. 
Fr. Van Wolvear feels that there will be no implications as far as the decision is concerned. The decision was made because the job is seasonal, one that peaks at the begin­ning of the year and then levels off. Another reason for the decision is that most students by-pass the housing office in their search fo housing. 
Although 2,385 students live off­campus this year, Fr. Van Wolvlear docs not feel that next year's num­ber will be affected by this decision as off-campus housing is used mostly by graduate and transfer students. Those swdents that move off-campus receive most of their housing information from their frit:nds and never consult the housing office. 
According to Don Murday, Notre Dame Student Body President there is enough work for a full time direc­tor. .'\-1urday stated that the option left for those who feel that a full time director is needed is to prove that nc:ed. The current part-time Direc­tor, Brother Edward Luther, is also the rector of Morissey Hall. 
. Murday commented that since the position is currently part-time it is hard to show that a full time: direc­tor is needed. According to .\turday, it is one vicious circle and "we have to break into the circle:." 
The acquisition of a full time director was the subject of the Stu­dent Senate meeting last night and will be the topic of the Campus Lift Council meeting tomorrow. 
to develop a report that will con­clude whether Notre Dame is still an excdlant teaching institution, or if it has become more oriented to research and publishing.

Polish strikers stand firm on delllands 
WARSAW, Poland ( AP) -Provin­cial authorities balked yesterday at ratifying an agrc:ement to end Poland's biggest regional strike since the independent labor move­ment Solidarity was formed 14 
months ago, a union spokesman said. The tentative bargain would have ended a 19-day wildcat strike by 160,000 workers in Zidona Gora that has affected nearly every walk of life in the farming province 230 miles west of Warsaw. At Solidarity's national headquar­ters in Gdansk, meanwhile, union leader Lech Walesa and other ranking Solidarity officials drafted a six-point agenda for talks with the government about Poland's economic and social ills. A union spokesman said Solldarity would like the talks to begin Friday. He said Solidarity wants mass media access, free local elections, judicial independence, creation of a social­economic council, economic reforms, and compensation to low­paid workers to offset price in­creases. Solidarity's spokesman in Zielona Gora, Marion Podsada, said a tentative settlement to the wildcat strike had been hammered out in a "grueling" all-night bargaining ses­sion that ended early yesterday. But he said provincial authorities failed to appear at the appointed hour to ratify the agreement, and were trying "to torpedo the deal" by reopening bargaining on vital por­tions ofthe accord. "In this situation, there is no chance of ending the strike very soon," said Andrzej Berlak, a local 
Solidarity official. 
The strike began Oct. 22 with demands by local Solidarity officials for the removal of three state farm managers for what the union called incompetency. It eventually spread to all parts of the regional economy except health services and utilities. 
Podsada said the strike need not have been so extensive, "But the au­thorities here dug in their heels, and their resistence bred radicalism here, which is the normal chain of events in Poland." 
He said the draft agreement provides for the dismissal of the three managers, the reinstatement of a Solidarity leader fired from the state farm where the strike began, amnesty for the protesting workers, and strike compensation calculated at vacation-pay rates. 
If accepted, it would end the one oflwo remaining strikes in a wave of wildcat walkouts that swept Poland last month, idling 250,000 workers and raising the the threat of a government martial law decree. 
The other wildcat strike still un­derway is in the coal mining city of Sosnowiec, 155 miles southwest of Warsaw. Miners are protesting a chemical throwing incident at a mine shaft last month in which 60 people were injured. The miners claim it was a provocation by the governmc:nt and want time on state television to present their case. 
Government officials say the fre­quent strikes and slowdowns in Poland are a major contributing fac­tor in the Communist country's fal­ling production and widespread food shortagc.·s. 

Changing face 

Chinatwon continues to grow 
By DAVID EINSTEIN 
AssociatedPress Writer 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-Chinatown. It glitters with restaurants and open-air markets, bazaars and jewelry stores that make it a must stop for every visitor to San Francisco. ,,. 
Yet it is also a ghetto, a dark, cramped place ofsweat­shops and gang violence and old people who live in fear. 
This is the changing face ofChinatown. What started as a neighborhood for those who had worked on the gold mines and railroads in the mid-1800s has grown to become the largest community of its kind outside the 
Orient.  ·  
And it's still growing. When  TUESDAY18~~  
the lid was lifted on immigration from China in  ~FOCUS  
1965,  20,000  

people per year began to flow into the 40-square-block area bordered by the city's financial district on one side and Italian North Beach on another. 
Today the population of Chinatown stands at about 65,000, a mixture of Cantonese-speaking elders and an influx of middle-and upper-class immigrants speaking Mandarin. 
Ernest Chann, president of the Chinese Historical Society of America, says that for newcomers, Chinatown is a necessary way station on the road to the American dream. 
"It's a community in flux. There are immigrants who learn the language and learn the ropes and move out," he said. 
"However there are also old folks who insist on staying, and you'll see many of them sitting around the few open parks, whiling away their twilight years." 
The elderly live in what Chann calls a "subculture. 
They only speak Chinese and never venture out of the area, even for a day's vacation. They live and die in Chinatown." 
Chinatown itself nearly dit:d before it had a chance to live, said Chann. 
Most ofits first settlers were men. In 1872, the federal government passed an act halting immigration for all but relatives of people who were living in America at that time. 
The supply of brides cut-off, Chinatown became a 
bachelor's haven littered with opium dens. 
What saved the community was the very event that 
destroyed it -the great earth4uake of 1906. Many 
records were lost in the fire that swept through the city, 
freeing Chinese residents to purchase fraudulent iden­
titit:s of people who had lived in Chinatown before 
1872. The tide ofimmigration resumed. 
Chinatown took on its modern character in the 
1920s, when the first shops and restaurants catering to 
tourists opened. It remained largely unchanged until 
1965, when the wave of immigrants gave it a new face. 
"The culture has been diluted in certain ways," Chann said. "For instance, the food is no longer strictly Cantonese. The chefS are borrowing elements from each style. And the movies are sometimes in Mandarin, sometimes in Cantonese." 
Throughout its history, Chinatown has lived with violence. In the old days it was the Tong Wars. Today it's youth gangs. The violence reached a peak in Septem­ber 1977 when five diners died in a hail ofbullets at the Golden Dragon restaurant. 
"We're concerned about it. There's always the poten­tial for problems," said police Sgt. Mike Pera. He said the most common problem is extortion of small busines­smen. 
The police operate a gang task force that tries to head_ off trouble before it starts. "Somebody finally gets fed up by being extorted and

Government statistics released yesterday show Yugoslavia's inflation, the worst in Europe, is growing. The Con­sumer Price Index showed the cost of living at the end of October was up 3.7 percent from the month earlier and 42.6 percent higher than the same time a year ago. The increase appeared to reflect recent price hikes for oil, electricity, bread, eggs, milk, meat, mass transit and rents, statisticians said. Yugoslav inflation hit a rate of 40 percent last year. -AP

"The wheel lug nuts were properly torqued during vehicle assembly," said Robert H. Transuu, manager of the Service Engineering Office for Ford's Parts and Service Division. But if a wheel has been replaced "using the specifications in the owner's guide," he said, the lug nuts could loosen and the wheel could come off. -AP

She ran through a medley of "Lipstick on Your Collar," "Who's Sorry Now" "Where the Boys Are," preparingfor her return to Westbury, a Long Island community where she gave her last concert on Nov. 8, 1974, and where she was raped in her motel room after the show. "It's risky," admitted Francis, who at 42 still sings with the voice of sweet, sad adolescence. "I'm not going to get through the show with­out breaking down. But I'm a gutsy girl, and once I've done it there (Westbury) I can do it anywhere." -AP 
A U.N. team probing alleged use of toxic chemicals by Vietnamese forces has extended its investigation for four days after hearing of new cases among Laotian refugees in northern Thailand, an Interior Ministry spokesman said yesterday. Six tribesmen who escaped from Laos claimed they were attacked with toxic chemicals. Thai authorities detained the refugees in Udon Thani province, 300 miles northeast of Bangkok, the spokesman said. He quoted mem­bers of the U.N. team as saying they had recorded testimony by al­leged victims ofthe chemicals but have found no material evidence. The eight-member team was sent here following reports by the U.S. State Department that Vietnamese were using poison weapons in Indochina. The team was supposed to leave Saturday but will intead return to New York today to report to the U.N. General Assembly later this month. -AP

'Indian~first, 


Native American speaks 
ByJULIANNEJONES 
News Staff 
The legal and cultural problems faced by American Indians in modern society were the subject of "American Indians: Forgotten Americans in Transition," a movie­lecture presentation by Ronald Andrade, executive director of the National Congress of American In­dians, delivered yesterday in the A V Theater of the the Center for Continuing Education. 
As Executive Director of the NCAI, Andrade, a member of the Luiseno tribe ofsouthern California, hold~ one of the most influential positions in Indian affairs. The NCAI, the largest and oldest organization representing Native Americans, lobbies in Washington, D.C., for the protection of Indian rights. Ninety­nine percent of American tribes are members ofthe NCAI. 
The presentation began with an hour-long movie. depicting the ac­tivities of another national Indian group, the Native American Rights Fund. NARF provides counseling for Indians facing legal issues such as land and water rights, discrimina­tion in public schools, and basic human rights such as free religion. 
The movie studied several case histories, the actions taken by NARF, and the results of these actions. The film also expressed concern over the ability ofthe federal government to abrogate any treaties made with Indian tribes. The treaties, drawn up during the nineteenth century, can be terminated without renegotia­tion if Congress feels there is an over-riding reason to do so. 
Andrade regards this as a violation of basic human rights, the basic respect between parties implicit in a treatv. 
The major problem is that reservation land is not owned by In­dians, only held in trust for-them by the government, who can take it back whenever it wishes. 
Other areas of concern ex­pounded by Andrade were the ex­ploitation of Indian lands for natural resources, the need for bilingual education for Native Americans, and the basic human rights of Indians. Both· the movie and Andrade stressed the growing exploitation of Indian lands for cheap natural resources. Although only 25 of the 500 North American tribes own resources of any value, large cor­porations view Indians as "the easiest and cheapest shot" for natural resources. Many tribes are beginning to realize this and take ac­
tion against it. 
Concerning bilingual education, Andrade explained, "We see bilin­gual education as a way to conserve our culture. Language has to stay or culture dies." In this modern, politi­cal society, bilingual education is a must. 
The status of the Native American 
disturbs Andrade. "We are not es­
sentially human in US belief. We 
were considered animals at first, and 
I do not think this has changed." 
Reflecting the Indian concept ofthe 
tribes as sovereign states, he said, 
"We have not really reached the 
level of being equals yet, but we're 
not really sure if we want it." When 
~ked if he would rather be con­
sidered an American or as a member 
of a sovereign state, Andrade 
answered, "I'd rather be Indian. I'm 
Indian first." Andrade cannot under­
stand why Americans think it is such 


a privilege to be a citizen. "One per­son once told me if I didn't like it here, why didn't I go back where I came from." 
Andrade is co-chairman of the World Assembly of First Americans to be held in Canada this summer. The Assembly will include representatives from all indigenous populations ofthe world, particular­ly ofthe Western Hemisphere. 

Andrade warned, "Unless we can get the rest ofthe world to intercede in our behalf, we will see violence." Andrade concluded by explaining the purpose of the NCAI: raising the level of understanding of the rights of Native Americans both inside and outside the US. "We will not exist long, we cannot exist long; we can­not hold up alone...Unless the tribes generate interest among external groups, they will cease to exist." 
Andrade's lecture, attended by ap­proximately 50 people, was or­ganized by Professor Sharon O'Brien and sponsored by the Departments The full moon, seen in such a position only by those awake in of Government, Sociology, and the wee hours, made its appearance in the night sky.

Study uncovers possible treatment 
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -Some West African societies seem to protect themselves against the worst effects ofsickle-cell anemia by the food they eat, a Stanford Univer­sity anthropologist said yesterday. 
And, according to Stanford's Wil­liam Durham, the West Africans gain protection against malaria through the combined effects of their religious observances and the sickle-

cell anemia in their blood. 
Doctors in the United States are trying to learn whether the Africans' diet can lead to a treatment for sickle-cell anemia, a genetic disease suffered by many black Americans and many Americans of Mediter­ranean descent. 
The West Africans have an un­usually high rate of sickle-cell anemia but live longer than most other victims ofthe disease. Durham wanted to know why. · 
First, he discovered that sickle­cell anemia was more common in societies that grew yams than in neighboring societies that grew and ate rice. 
No one could explain the dif­ference, Durham told a science writers' seminar sponsored by the 
Council  for  the  Advancement  of  
Science Writing.  
But  Durham  said  he  knew  of  

research that seemed to indicate that sickle-cell anemia would protect victims against malaria, which is common in West Africa. 
The malaria parasite, which causes disease by working into red blood cells, cannot live very well in the sickle-shaped red blood cells of sickle-cell anemia sufferers. The cells, because of their shape, can become trapped in the capillaries. The blood cells then rupture, and the malaria parasites die. 
But sickle-cell anemia is also a daJ1gerous disease. The cells that

collect in the capillaries eventually block the flow of blood, causing blindness, pain in the extremities and death in severe cases. 
So the advantages the Africans gained by surviving malaria would be lost if they died from sickle-cell anemia. But Durham discovered their diet gave some protection against sickle-cell anemia. 
The Africans eat primarily the yams that grow in the region. The yams contain a chemical called thiocyanate which prevents cells from developing a sickle shape, and thus protects those who eat it. 
That explained why the Africans survived sickle-cell anemia. But if the yams kept the Africans from developing sickle cells, how were the Africans fighting off malaria? 
The answer was found in their 
religious beliefs, which provide that 
newly harvested yams cannot be 
eaten during the rainy season. 
The Africans were developing 
sickle cells during the rainy season, 
because they were not eating yams, 
and the sickle cells were protecting 
them from malaria, Durham dis­
covered. 
The rainy season is the time they 
most need protection from malaria, 
he said, because the disease is 
carried by mosquitoes that multiply 
in the wet months. If you ate yams 
during the rainy season, you would 
lose your resistance to malaria, Dur­
ham said.

Students complain 

about distribUtion 



By MICHAEL WILKINS 

News Staff 
As the excitement from the last home football game of the season slowly dies away, the Irish eyes on campus turn hopefully to the upcoming home basketball season. 
Last week, the first step in starting 
that season began with the distribu­
tion of season tickets to students. 
For many freshmen students, the 
first event of the season was an un­
happy one. 
A large number of freshmen stu­dents complained about the distribution process they had to go through in order to get certain tick­ets. Freshmen were offered package A or package A and B but were not 

allowed to purchase package B with­out buying package A. 
This limited availability of tickets angered several freshmen who believed they had the opportunity to buy one package or the other or 


Ruling of obscenity constitutes closing 
WASIIINGTON (AP)-States and local communities cannot shut down stores or theaters displaying sexually explicit materials before getting a court ruling that the materials are obscene, the Supreme Court ruled yesterday. 
Hy a 6-3 vote, the justices upheld rulings that a Washington state law which would allow such closings without a court hearing was an un­constitutional "prior restraint" on free speech. 
In separate actions, the court refused to protect parents of public school students from having to pay for schot•l property vandalized by their children and agreed to decide whl·ther the NAACP must pay for a I960s boycott of white-owned businesses in Mississippi. 
The court's affirmance in the Washington case was issued without a written opinion and without oral arguments being held. 
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, joined by Justices Lewis F. Powell and William H. Rehnquist, said the lower federal courts and the Supreme Court should stay out of the case until the law was used and until state courts could rule on it. 
Similarly broad public nuisance laws apparently arc rare. According to court papers filed in the Washing­ton case. only Idaho has a similar law on its books. It has been upheld by that state's courts but now may come under new lc:gal challenges. 
ND student named top senior cadet 
The commander of Notre Dame's Army ROTC cadet battalion, Gregory Brophy of Fort Dix, N.J., has been named winner of the coveted Gt:orgc C. Marshall Award as the top senior cadc:t and for bc:st represent­ing the idc:als of professional exccl­lc:nn.: of thl· World \\'ar lllc:ader. 
Brophy, who is majoring in electrical engineering and will be commissionc:d a~ an Army second licutl'nant at Notre: Dame next May, has also receivc:d a plaque from the· commanding general of the Second 
Region tbr outstanding achieve­
ments during a summer training 
program at Fort Riley. 
A cadet lieutenant colonel, Brophy added to his trophies when he was named winner of the I 70­pound divison in Notre Dame's charity boxing exhibition, the Ben­gal Bouts. 
Laws allowing similar closings were struck down in Alabama. California, Georgia, Louisiana and North Carolina, court papers said. 
The Washington law declares business establishments to be "moral nuisances" if they exhibit "lewd films or publications." It provides for confiscation of all money from sales or admissions, and permits court orders to close the business for as long as one year. 
In striking down the law, the 9th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said, "The ability of a court to close a place temporarily because obscene materials 'may' have been sold, dis­tributed or exhibited on the juries to trim money awards for acci­

premises is an impermissible prior dent victims. Now, five companies restraint." that ran such ads face the possibility The justices also took these ac­ofhaving to pay money damages.

Nancy Reagan faults parents in drug abuse 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Nancy Reagan all but blamed drug addic­tion on the nation's parents yester­day and advised them to get tough, even if it means "losing your child for awhile." 
The first lady, embarking on a new anti-drug crusade, labeled addiction "the most democratic illness there is," because it cuts across racial and economic lines. 
"I believe parents are the answer to it all," Mrs. Reagan declared during a meeting in the state,.dining room with about 40 members of the National Federation of Parents for Drug Free Youth. 
"I think for a long time parents weren't involved," the first lady said. "They shifted it to the schools or the police or the government, anybody but themselves, because it took time, it took effort, it's not pleasant. 
"Sometimes you run the risk of losing your ('hild for awhile," she added. "You have to be tough and you have to learn to say, 'no.' 
"It's great to be your child's friend and pal," she said. "But sometimes, you've got to be their parent." 
Mrs. Reagan said she has believed "t<>r a long time that parc:nts have not been involved the way t;Jey should be. I think that in the final analysis it's the parents who are going to turn this thing around. I think they're the most potent force there is." 
She asked the participants at yes­terday's meeting how she could help and they suggested she speak out publicly and visit parent groups and school programs in addition to drug centers. 
"We're all in a lot of hot water," she declared. "There's a danger of losing our whole next generation." 
Mrs. Reagan said that during her visits to drug treatment centers she was fascinated "to hear these young people talk very freely, very openly, with very little embarrassment, which I expected, about what has happened to them.... All of them mentioned the parents." 
After talking with the group, Mrs. Reagan said she was now "very, very encouraged about the parents and their involvement." 
In recent months, the first lady has held eight private meetings with ex­perts on drug and alcohol abuse and has visited two residential treatment programs.

both packages and had decided to purchase just package B for whatever reason. These people claimed the ticket distribution rules had been changed in the middle of distribution and claimed the new process was unfair. 
According to Steve Orsini of the ACC ticket office, the distribution procedure was not changed. "Freshmen and sophomores were to be offered tickets based on their availability after purchase by seniors and juniors," Orsini said. "We decided to offer freshmen package B only with package A because of the limited availability ofpackage B." 
Though this system of distribu­tion may seem unfair to some, it did ofti:r more tickets to freshmen who were originally going to be offered only the remainder of ead1 of the eight game packages. Under this method, freshmen were offered up to 16 tickets instead of possibly receiving less than eight. 
With the limited number of seats 
available to students in the ACC, 
there will always be students who 
will be disappointed at not getting 
tickets for a ('ertain game. Hopefully, 
support at the games will be as great 
as the competition to get tickets.

"I'm upset that they weren't here to see me Saturday," Tripp con­tinues while discusing the subject most dear to him. "They were here last week, but they couldn't make it up this week because my mother had to work -she's a nurse." 
They may not have been in Notre Dame Stadium, but Mom and Dad still took part in Son's biggest thrill. 
"When she's not here, she listens to our games on the radio, all of them. She watches us on the Sunday morning replays, too. She said she tried to call after the game. As a mat­ter of fact, I called her not five minutes after she had just tried to call me. They were both pretty thrilled, although the first thing my dad asked was 'Are you all right?'"

and I can't say enough about )im Stein." The Irish will lose only Phil Swcester and Stein at the fullback position to graduation next year. In fact, a total ofonly six players will be lost to graduation, four ofthem start­ers: Stein, Kahale, Ed O'Malley, and John Milligan. Midfielder Steve Kraemer and Sweester are the other two seniors. 
Milligan turned in a splendid year in the nets, surrendering only 1.14 goals per game. A consistent goalkeeper is essential to a quality soccer team and the Irish were cer­tainly not lacking in that aspect this past season. 
The biggest key to the success of the team had to have been the balanced scoring attack. The top five scorers: Kahale, Rob Snyder, O'Malley, Herdegen, and Mario Manta combined for a total of 56 goals on the season. 
Kahale had 12 goals and 1 S assists 
to lead the team for the season. He 
ranks second on the all-time scoring 
list, behind Kevin Lovejoy ( 1978­
80) with 35 goals and 30 assists. O'Malley moved to fourth on the all­time list while sophomore Rob Snyder is fifth after only two years. 
Kahale also viewed this season as a 
great success. 
"This year, we just had better general skills and better ball control than in the past. We played head-to­head with the big teams and we won the close games." 
O'Malley agrees, adding, "I think a key factor this season was the character and dedication of our players. The confidence level was also higher than it's ever been before. We played our game this season instead ofadjusting our style in order to contain teams." 
Although the season has just 
ended, preparations for next season ' 
arc already underway. "We've al­
ready contacted over 100 players 
for next season," comments Hunter. 
"Wc will be attempting to 
strengthen our midfield next season 
and work on the technique of our 
forwards in the penalty area." 
So. with all this improvement, what does the future hold for Notre Dame soccer'..... Quite frankly, a playoff bid will be tough. 
"It's very difficult for a non­scholarship team to make the playoffs," explains Hunter. "We may look to revise our schedule in the future to include more teams with programs comparable to our own." 
Indeed, it is virtually impossible 
to foresee a non-scholarship team 
play at the level ofan Indiana Univer­
sity, for example, which gives all of 
its players free rides. 
One thing is certain, though: Hun­ter and his troops will be there creat­ing excitement and fielding quality soccer teams in the years to come.

also hard to believe and Bowling Green lead, 2-0. 
The general feeling of the players is that the call~ were terribly.biased. There is a feeling ofbitterness on the team toward the situation, but as senior Sami Kahale puts it, "We know in our hearts that we deserved a bid." 
Stein came back to score a goal with about seven minutes left to close the gap to one, but it wasn't enough. The result of the protest will be determined in the next few days. 
Hunter is determined to do some­
thing about the incident. "I will do everything I can within the law to make sure something like this never happens again," says the fifth-year coach. "I think the Bowling Green coach acted unethically. He realized the situation beforehand." Neither the Bowling Green coach nor the referee would discuss the issue with Hunter. 
Nonetheless, the season as a whole must be viewed as a huge success. 

The question mark at the start of the season was the defense. However, the defense turned out very strong this season. "I couldn't be more pleased with our defense this season," praises Hunter. "All of our fullbacks played consistently,

Irish soccer team ends fifth season 
By RICK KRIST 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame soccer team wound up itsfifth year ofvarsity play in style Saturday, as it rolled over Louisville, 4-1. Freshman Richard Herdegen tallied twice to wind up with 11 goals for the season. Junior Mario Manta and senior midfielder
-
Ed O'Malley also scored for the Irish who, in the second half, played what coach Rich Hunter descr.ibed as "the best we've ever played." The win was an impressive one, especially coming off the bitter outcome of the Bowling Green game on Thursday. Although the Irish lost, 2-1, Hun­ter protested the game and there is a glimmer of hope. If the NCAA rules in favor ofNotre Dame, a playoffbid is still a possibility. The controversy surrounding the game concerns Dr. Michael Long, the referee for the contest, who called two penalty kicks against the Irish within one minute of each other, both of which resulted in Bowling Green goals. While this in itself may not seem unusual, there has been a history of this type of thing happening when­ever Long referees a Notre Dame game. Long has refereed .four Notre Dame games since 1978, and has isst.ed a total of six penalty kicks against the Irish. Until the Bowling 
Green game, Notre Dame had not been called for a single penalty kick this season. Also, last year against ·Michigan State, Long gave out a total of five red cards (ejections) in a game which got completely out of hand and turned into a total disaster. 
As a result of last year's incident, 
Hunter sent a letter to Great Lakes 
Regional ChairmanJerry Yeagley, of 
Indiana Univ., explaining the situa­
tion and suggesting that Long not be 
scheduled to do Notre Dame games, 
in light of the events which had 
transpired in the past. Hunter also 
sent a letter to Bowling Green coach 
Gary Palmisano explaining the situa­
tion. 
In NCAA soccer, home team 
coaches have a say as to who the 
referees will be. Apparantly, Pal· 
misano had knowledge ofLong's his· 
tory ofconflict with Notre Dame but 
went ahead with Long as the referee 
anyway. 
The first call went against center 
fullback Jim Stein. "I never touched 
their man. When I heard the whistle, 
I thought the call was against 
Bowling Green," claims Stein. The 
referee, when asked what the foul 
was, said that Stein "kicked" the 
Bowling Green man. The result: 
Bowling Green takes a 1·0 lead. 
Exactly one minute later, Joe Hol· 
terman was called for a foul while 
jumping for a headball. This call was

FCA gaining in popularity

EVERYONE WELCOME 
--~ 

Notre Dame participating with over 140 other campuses 
ship of Christian Athletes, but it is true. At a school probably best known for both athletics and its Christian roots, the FCA is a relative­ly small and obscure group that is finally being lead into the campus spotlight. 
Dale Fronk, a sophomore from Columbus, Ohio is the president of Notre Dame's FCA and seems to think that this campus is ready for the outlet that such an organization provides. 
"All we're trying to do is to promote Christian · fellowship through either athletics or academics. " explains Fronk. "You don't necessarily have to be both an athlete and a student to like what we have to offer." 
Already, the FCA has offered two speakers of campus prominence in an open forum setting, and both have worked out well. 
Both Irish assistant football Coach Tom Uchtenberg and head baseball Coach Larry Gallo have met with in· terested students to discuss the role of Christianity in sports, and both meetings seemed to have made their mark on those who attended. 
"Both speakers have done an ex· cellent job ofgetting across to the students, mostly with just stories 'from their lives or their. personal view of Christian athletics. We've been very happy with our progress, and we're looking forward to the rest ofour forums." 
The next speaker in the series will be Irish basketball Coach Digger Phelps, and FCA organizer Rich McLaughlin hopes to have a good turnout in the chapel ofHoward Hall this tomorrow night at 8:30p.m. 
"We hope that people will show up to see what he has to say, because he usually can be pretty entertain· ing," offers McLaughlin. "A good tur­feet." 

This is by no means the first at· tempt at a FCA organization on the Notre Dame campus, as Fronk is quick to explain. "About eight years ago, there was a rather large FCA movement here on campus. At that time, they did a lot of charitable ac· tivities during home football games. I don't know why things died out, but they did, and that's why we're trying to renew interest." 
"All we're trying to do 
is promote  Christian  
fellowship  through  
athletics  or  
academics.,,  

I f the FCA does attract a suitable number of members, Fronk intends to actively pursue the type of ac· tivities that will make the FCA a helpful group in the South Bend area. 
"We hope to do some community service work as soon as possible. Hopefully, the Christmas season will give us the opportunity to help the needy of the community, while having a meaningful experience at the same time." 
For those who have interest in getting involved with an organiza­tion ofthe FCA's nature and national stature, you are urged to attend the forum this tomorrow night or any of the following meetings that will transpire this year: Jan. 20 -ticket manager Steve Orsini at the Farley Chapel, Feb. 17 -track Coach Ed Kelly at the Dillon Chapel, March 3 -Athletic Director Gene Corrigan at the Walsh Chapel, and April 7 ­hockey Coach Charles 'Lefty' Smith
