THE INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER SERVING NOTRE DAME AND SAINT MARY'S 
Fellowship available to students 
By CHRIS HANIFIN 
News Writer 
For a few industrious upper­classmen, the Echoing Green Public Service Fellowship, an exciting post-graduate oppor­tunity, will provide vast experi­ence in the business world and the opportunity to help others. 
"This fellowship is one way to learn amazing skills that you can take anywhere," said Dolly Saengswang, program director for Echoing Green. "It is a one­year fellowship applied for in your senior year which allows you to go out and start a public service program. We want to help you create your own vision of social change." 
The fellowship consists of a $15,000 stipend, which is to be used in some type of non-profit venture to benefit the commu­nity. Saengswang characterized the stipend as "seed money" which a young entrepreneur could use in fund-raising , staff development, or any other necessary endeavor. "Think of this fellowship as a springboard," she said. 
"I know it is a hal"d time and there are a lot of options," Saengswang said. "This is an opportunity to do something very different from what most of your friends are doing." 
"Fund raising is intimidating, and it takes up a lot of time. It's especially hard for a twenty­two year-old with no track record to get money. As a foundation, our stipend gives you some backing, some credi­bility in attempting to solicit more funds from other sources," she said. 
According to Saengswang, the fellowship does not stop there, however. "Unlike many other fellowships, we also at­tempt to give advice and access to technical expertise in addi­tion to money. We try to get you hooked up with other fellows, and also try to help you develop relationships with more experienced non-profit leaders through conferences." 
"They are extremely good at making sure that what you want to do gets done," said Curt Peterson, '87. Peterson is currently participating in an Echoing Green Fellowship at

In the spirit of Christmas 

Kim Thornton, an off-campus senior, gets into the spirit of the Christmas season by taking part in a tree-trimming celebration yesterday in LaFortune Student Center. 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The 
White House unveiled food la­
beling rules Wednesday that for 
the first time will enable 
consumers to directly compare 
the nutritional value of every 
packaged food in the grocery 
store. 
Labels on all processed foods 
will not only show calories, total 
fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, 
sodium, carbohydrates and 
protein, but will also put them 
all in the context of a daily diet 
of 2,000 calories and 65 grams -of fat. 
Such designations as "low­
fat," "high-fiber" and "light" 
will be based on federally im­
posed definitions. Serving sizes 
will be uniform. 
Health and nutrition groups 
praised the decision, but a meat 
industry official said the labels 
would confuse people. Raw 
meat and poultry are not in­
cluded, but any products con­
taining meat and processed 
meat, such as bologna, are 
covered. 
Currently, high-fat foods 
rarely carry nutrition informa­

Possible revisions of the date rape policy and changes regarding residence hall semi-formals are the changes now being discussed for the up-coming summer revision of du Lac. 
The administration will also examine trends of incidents that have occurred throughout the year that du Lac may need to be amended or revised to accommodate during the spring. 
Thus far, there are no trends or incidents of concern to the administration, according to Bill Kirk, assistant vice president for Student Affairs, but he said they will be in a better position to analyze the school year late this spring. 
Currently, the Campus Life Council (CLC) is investigating and discussing issues they and students would like to see addressed during the revision process.

sands of labels would cost in­dustry about $2 billion. 
"While we do not agree with each and every decision, we will now start the enormous job of providing this new information to consumers as soon as possible," said C. Manley Mol­pus, president and chief execu­tive officer of the Grocery Manufacturers of America. 
The labeling rules will not apply to restaurant menus, but any restaurant that posts a sign advertising a "low-fat" food must make sure the food com­plies with the government's definition.

Officers: Students must always stay alert 
By THERESA ALEMAN 
News Writer 
Students must stay alert to their surroundings said Rex Rakow director of Security along with South Bend Police Department Sergeants George Gherardi and David Chapman in a safety lecture yesterday. 
Although crime is relatively low in apartments rented by Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students, simple measures such as keeping track of the serial numbers of valuable items will greatly reduce incidents of theft, said the officers. 
They said that residents of off-campus houses can spend as little as nine cents per night to light the outside vicinity of houses to discourage burglars. 

Befriending neighbors is the most effective means of crime prevention in apartments and houses, said Gherardi. 
In addition to urging safety for off-campus residents, Offi­cers warned students to safe­guard themselves against crime at off-campus parties and bars. 
According to Gherardi, major crimes which generally vic­timize students include as­saults, robberies, and automo­bile accidents outside parties or bars where students have been drinking and judgement is im­paired. To minimize these, Gherardi suggested students appoint not only a designated driver but a designated alert person. 
Chapman, acknowledging tension between students and 
police, agreed "'ith the idea of appointing a designated alert person, but added that students should also drink responsibly to avoid confrontations with the law. 
"Most students are arrested for disrespect to officers, re­gardless of the charges," said Chapman. Excessive drinking causes students to act out of character, challenging police authority, according to Chap­man. 
He said that while police exist to protect and serve, their powers are limited and they need help. He concluded, "We're people too. When you see us, go ahead and wave... Just make sure you use all five fingers to do so."

INSIDE COLUMN 
University and freedom not on speaking terms 

Have you noticed that there are some things we ·ust don't talk about around here? Have you noticed that people are actually afraid to talk 
about these things? 
When Gerhard Casper, former dean of the law Becky Barnes school and provost at the Asst. News Editor University of Chicago, accepted the position of'--------­university president at Stanford in October, he gave an inaugural address that outlined the freedoms of a university. 
"A university's freedom must be the freedom of its members, faculty and students to think and speak for themselves. A university must not have dominant ways of thinking. No university can thrive unless each member is accepted as an autonomous individual and can speak and will be listened to without regard to labels and stereotypes," he said. 
Does this sound like the place you go school? 
A recent Scholastic article highlighted the problem. A member of Gays and Lesbians at Notre Dame and St. Mary's College, who wished to be identified only as "John," said homosexuals on campus feel that "we are not allowed to tell the truth about who we are." 
When Pax Christi wanted to circulate a petition addressed to the National Conference o Catholic Bishops asking the bishops to support legislation protecting the civil rights o homosexuals, Student Activities refused them permission to solicit signatures. Not only are homosexuals discouraged from speah.ing, but others can not even speak for them. 
The Scholastic article also discussed the issue of teaching verses research, or tried to. But "five (junior) faculty members refused to comment on that subject, and two spoke on the condition of anonymity." Do untenured professors feel they are risking their career to speak on this issue? 
A Student Government survey on sexuality done in 1989-90 revealed that only 5 of 21 date rape victims reported the incident to Notre Dame authorities because of "fear of either the University response or lack of confidentiality." 
These victims perceive an authority, real or imagined, that would harm them. They are afraid to talk about their experience. 
I was also told that the University Health Center can not give out information about birth control. I didn't know whether that was true or not, so I called over there to find out. But the director of the center was out for the day. and no one else would tell me anything. 
So I still don't know whether the center will tell you anything about birth control, but it was probably more revealing that it seemed to be such a sensitive topic that no one but the director would even discuss it. 
Casper said that a University must not have a dominant way of thinking. But it looks to me like people who find themselves outside Roman Catholic teachings, associated with that taboo word "sex," or dependent on the University for their career, don't always feel free to speak.

Princess Diana favorite royalty in poll 
LONDON-The Duchess of York, who was photographed topless with an American businessman, has done the most damage to the royal family, according to a poll published Wednesday in the Daily Express. Seventy-one percent of those questioned blamed the duchess for damage. Prince Charles placed second, with 20 percent saying he had done the most harm to the family, and 14 percent blamed Princess Diana. Diana remains Britain's favorite royal, according to the poll. Fifty percent thought Diana had done the most to improve the standing of the royals during the past two years. More people -57 percent -sympathized with Diana than with her husband, Charles, who polled 12 percent. Sixteen percent said they took no sides in their marital problems and 10 percent had no sympathy for either. The poll questioned 1,003 people Nov. 19-20 and has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.

Bol charged for stealing garbage truck 
P 
RU, Ind.-A 13-year-old boy on probation was charged Wednesday with stealing a city garbage truck and driving it through town hitting cars, trees and a fire hydrant. The youth, who wasn't identified because of his age, was charged with auto theft, criminal recklessness and drunken driving in Miami Circuit Court, said chief deputy prosecutor Dan Banina. Police reports show the garbage truck damaged at least four cars, a fire hydrant and several trees. His blood-alcohol level was measured at .22 percent -well above the .1 0 percent definition for drunkenness. Mark Pyeritz, city street and sanitation foreman, said the 1992 GMC truck may be a total loss. It was worth $69,000. Pyeritz said he doesn't plan to keep keys in the trucks anymore. "We line the trucks up on the east side of the building, and would leave the keys in the trucks in case of a fire," he said. "We never thought too much about it because who's going to steal a garbage truck?" The youth had been scheduled to appear in court Wednesday on a charge of violating probation by skipping school, Banina said.

Gaidar defends free-market reforms 
MOSCOW (AP) -Acting Prime Minister YegDr Gaidar told a jeering Congress on Wednesday that the Russian people are smarter and more patient than the hard-liners who are trying to dump his government and block reforms. 
But conservative lawmakers simply returned the fire against Gaidar and President Boris Yeltsin during an inconclusive second day of debate in the Congress of People's Deputies, Russia's highest legislative body. 
Neither side yet commanded enough votes in the 1,041­member body to prevail in the battle over Gaidar's adminis­tration, which hard-liners say is leading the country to poverty and collapse. Yeltsin and Gaidar call the current troubles a painful but necessary step toward a market economy. 
Gaidar conceded the gov­ernment's program had failed to tame inflation, now 25 per­cent a month. But he said a de­dining number of strikes and public protests indicated grow­ing public acceptance of the switch to a free-market econ­omy. 
"There is no threat of hunger and cold. We have passed through the period of adapta­tion to reforms without social upheaval," Gaidar said. 
"Despite all the hardships re­sulting from the changes, de­spite all the obstacles that still must be overcome, the Russian people turn out to be smarter than politicians think." 
"The people clearly under­stand the need for reform and are ready to work, rather than rock the bmit of our well-being and future," he said. 
The opposition was not swayed. 
"Gaidar is a con man," said Mikhail Astafiyev, a leader of the hard-line Russian Unity faction in Congress. 
"He will almost certainly have to resign," said Dmitri Stepanov, another Russian Unity member. 
Hard-liners want to slow Yeltsin's economic changes and drop Gaidar, the architect of the reforms. 
Yeltsin has resisted lawmak­ers' demands that he nominate a prime minister for approval by the Congress. Because Gaidar is only "acting" prime minister, Yeltsin has not had to submit his nomination. Yeltsin has said he will not submit it unless forced to by Congress. 
Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister, said Yeltsin would stand by Gaidar if forced to nominate a prime minister. 
Gaidar's speech was met by jeers and stony faces from the rows of burly, middle-aged former Communists holdovers from the old regime who were elected in March 1990, 17 months before the coup attempt that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. 

Tiny town cuts employees to the bone 
SAN JUAN BAUTISTA, Calif. (AP) -The police chief is gone. So are the police and all the other employees of this small Spanish mission town. 
Faced with a budget crunch and a growing stack of bills it couldn't pay, the City Council fin~d the city's 12 employees. 
Since the public works de­partment shut down, volunteer fire chief Rick Cokley does the yard work around his two­engil'le fire house. Volunteers run city hall. A contractor picks up garbage. 
"There was no way out," said Robert Paradice, a city coun­cilman who now doubles as a front-desk volunteer at City Hall. 
"Hopefully, with volunteer help, we'll be able to keep our heads above water." 
The money problems in San Juan Bautista, a town of 1,650 about 60 miles south of San Jose, are facing local govern­ments around the country. 
"The revenue base for cities is just dwindling," said Debbie Thornton, spokeswoman for the League of California Cities, which represents the state's 469 municipalities. 
Many cities are "sticking their heads in the sand," said John O'Sullivan, whose Municipal Resources Consultants firm in Westlake Village advises cities on their financial condition. 
However, he said, "I don't know of many that let it get quite as bad as San Juan Bautista." 
Interim City Manager Russ Carlson, hired in September under a six-month contract to fix the fiscal mess, was on the job three days when he discov­ered how bad it really was. 
Officials were waiting to see how much came in from public sewer bill payments before writing checks to pay the debts, he said. 
Of the $800,000 annual bud­get, $300,000 was going to meet payroll. And the city was spending $12,000 to $15,000 a month more than it had, he said. 
At his recommendation, the council laid off its three full­time police officers, two office workers, a public works em­ployee and six part-time work­ers. 
Except for-Carlson, whose contract expires in March, the city now is functioning with about a dozen volunteers, in­cluding retirees and unem­ployed people. 
The San Benito County Sher­iff's Department is now policing the streets of San Juan Bautista. Residents say it helps that the sheriff lives in the city.

FORT KNOX, Ky. (AP) ­President-elect Clinton plans to lift the ban on gays in the mili­tary, and most soldiers at Fort Knox and Fort Campbell say they'll accept the order from their commander-in-chief, al­beit reluctantly. 
"Clinton is the president-elect, and when he takes office, whatever he does I'm bound by oath to support," said Maj. Frederick Washington of Fort Knox. "Anybody in the Army should feel that way. I don't see any problem as long as we uphold the oath we took.... I think most people in the Army are professionals." 
Some soldiers said that sexual orientation would make little difference during an int~nse

battle. 
"If the going gets tight, you're going to forget about it in a time of war," said Col. Willie Pollard, who is the Army's senior adviser to the Indiana National Guard and was visiting Fort Knox recently. "But it's really going to disrupt the peacetime." 
That's what those in the mili­tary are worried about. And it's not easy for some to adjust to the change of the longstanding policy that bars gays from the military. 
When he pledged to lift the ban during his campaign, the president-elect said he would consult high-level military ad­visers, who reportedly are mostly against the idea.

The application process in­volves constructing a prospec­tus discussing one's proposal. The University will select the top five to seven applications which will then be further evaluated by the Echoing Green Foundation, which conducts telephone interviews. 
Eighteen schools currently are involved in providing fellowship candidates, said Saengswang.

"We help them [the fellows]

added. Fellows send a progress 
report on their project to the

The program originated through the efforts of several venture capital firms based in New York. According to Saengswang, each firm had been making individual contri­butions to public service. " 
Each hoped to do in non­profit organizations what it had been doing in business: Provide seed money for project de­velopment. They soon realized that a greater impact would be made if resources were pooled," she said. 
The fellowship was made available for graduate students three years ago; the undergraduate program is two years old.

"grounded in empirical facts." 
Kirk said that Student Affairs 
is interested in working with 
the CLC on revising the policy 
governing semi-formals. , "We will look at whether or 
not they (semi-formals) are 
fulfilling the social life needs of 
students at Notre Dame any­
more," said Kirk. "We will look 
at the running of off-campus 
formals as well." 

Kirk said there are also areas 
of concern that the administra­
tion looks at very closely every 
time du Lac is revised. 

"We always look at judicial 
procedures to make sure that it 
is a fair and efficient process to 
address concerns," said Kirk. 
"We also look at trends of inci­
dents that occur and see if pol­
icy needs to be amended or if 
we are missing something in du 
Lac to deal with the incidents." 
The judicial branch of student 
government is gathering in­
formation to examine the hall

completed sometime in March, 
said Rich Delevan director of 
policy in the legal division of 
student government. 

Student government and the 
administration both emphasized 
that it is too early in the 
revision process to speculate on 
how much du Lac will be al­

The best D.C. advice: 'If in doubt, don't do it' 
WASHINGTON (AP) Washington is a town that seems to get a lot of people in trouble, so new House mem­bers spent some time Wednes­day learning how to avoid it. 
The best advice, one said: "If in doubt, don't do it." 
Pointing to an inch-thick ethics manual that was handed out to all 110 freshmen, newly elected Rep. Cynthia McKinney, D-Ga.. said, "The thickness of this book demonstrates that there are a lot of things that can trip you up." 
The newcomers heard private presentations from veteran colleagues on the maze of rules and regulations that govern the life of a Washington politician. 
There was this advice from Rep. James Hansen of Utah. the senior Republican on the ethics committee: 
"Please don't call a judge and tell him how to decide a case.... You can imagine the hot water you'd get into." 
The panel's chairman, Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, admon­ished newcomers not to take honoraria checks from groups to which they speak. New rules require that any speaking fees be mailed directly to a charity and not be handled by a mem­ber of Congress. 
Among other pieces of advice: don't accept campaign checks in your congressional office and don't mix official and campaign functions. Freshmen were given a phone number to call where three lawyers wait to answ.er their ethics questions. 
Stokes said his overworked committee wasn't looking for new business. "We're there to keep you OUT of trouble," he told freshmen. 
It's not a theoretical· exercise. The last several years on Capi­tol Hill have been dominated by news of scandal. House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas was forced from office over fi­nancial irregularities.

Shuttles sailing smoothly, but future is up in the air 
CAPE CANAVERAL. Fla. (AP) ''I'm hopeful that that will -NASA has finally mastered come to pass, that people will the art of launching shuttles on realize the space shuttle is a time, but it may be too late: good vehicle and it's good for Funds are down, costs are up, the country and we'll continue the military is out and a White-to fly it for a long time," said House task force wants the fleet deputy shuttle director Brewster 
replaced with something new. 
"The evidence has been building for years and years and years. There's just nothing for them (shuttle astronauts) to do up there, at least nothing that's worth the risk and the cost of putting them up there," said former NASA historian Alex Roland, now a history pro­fessor at Duke University. 
Wednesday's launch of Dis­covery capped a stellar year of eight shuttle missions, the most since the Challenger explosion. 
And all but one of the launches took place on the scheduled day -a big improvement over past years in which launches were frequently delayed by days or even weeks. 
For NASA, it seems too cruel an irony that the program may be outdated just as it is finally becoming reliable.

Shaw, an ex-astronaut. . 
Two weeks ago, the Whrte House -task force recommended a new launch system ­manned and unmanned -that would be cheaper, safer and more reliable than the shuttle, which is based on 1970_s tech­nology. To pay for thrs new family of rocKets, the panel recommended reducing shuttle flights as soon as possible. . 
"The shuttle is very expensrve relative to its role in the U.S. space program," the task force said. 
NASA estimates each shuttle 
mission costs about a $500 mil­
lion, assuming a rate of eight 
flights a year, the goal for the 
foreseeable future. Some ana­
lysts, however, say the cost is 
closer to $1 billion. 
NASA is spending $5 billion this fiscal year on the shuttle program, less than last year but still more than a third of the agency's total budget. 

Report says home sales took a dive 
WASHINGTON (AP) -New home sales took their biggest dive in seven months in Octo­ber, the government estimated Wednesday in a report analysts said had become so unreliable that they expected the plunge to be revised upward. 
"Here we go again!" ex­claimed economist David Sei­ders of the National Association of Home Builders after seeing the preliminary report that sales fell10.3 percent. 
If so, it would be the steepest drop since an 11.5 percent decline last March, with sales slipping in each of the country's four regions. 
But the initial estimates by the departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Devel­opment have been adjusted upward, often substantially, ev­ery month since September 1991. 
In fact, the 1 percent decline first reported for sales in September 1992 actually turned out to be a 7 percent increase, according to Wednesday's report. 

Estimated sales for October totaled 600,000 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, which would be down from 669,000 a month earlier. 
Until October, sales had in­creased each month since May, which analysts attribute in large part to relatively low mortgage rates. 
In a related report Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers As­sociation said the number of Americans behind on their mortgage payments edged up slightly in the July to September period to 4.8 percent from 4.77 percent in the spring quarter. 
The association blamed the deterioration on a large in­crease in delinquencies in Cali­fornia, much of which still suf­fers from the recession Still, delinquencies were well below the 5.07 percent of a year ago. 
Analysts expect a modest housing expansion to generate moderate job growth in the construction industry. Nonethe­less, some of the nation's top business economists contend there will be little improvement in the overall unemployment rate next year even with Presi­dent-elect Clinton's economic stimulus program. 
The National Association of Business Economists said Wednesday the median expec­tation of 41 professional fore­casters surveyed in late November was for economic growth of only 0.2 percent more than if President Bush had won re-election. As a result, they predicted the jobless rate would average 7.2 percent next year, slightly below the current 
7.4 percent. 

Teens and smoking: Think they can't quit 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The government has found what parents already knew: Kids who smoke are too sure of their ability to stop. They misjudge the addictive power of ci­garettes. They want to quit but can't. 
In fact, almost none of them kick the habit, said Abigail Moss, who led the research team for the National Center for

"It's depressing," she said Wednesday as the government released its findings. 
The study, based on interviews with 9,965 teen-agers, found that kids whose friends smoke were far more likely to become smokers than those who hung out with non-smokers -3 percent in the non-smoklng crowd versus 50 percent for those with smoking friends. 
And older brothers and sisters were more likely to be a bad influence than parents. "Thirty percent of adolescents reported currently smoking in homes where only older siblings smoked, compared with 15 percent of teen-agers f,rom homes where only their parents smoked," the study said. 
Experimental smoking has risks, the study said. People who tried it as teen-agers were 16 times more likely to wind up as smokers when they became adults. 
"Even with the vast body of information now available re­garding the adverse effects of cigarette smoking and recent efforts to encourage smokers to quit and young people not to start, smoking continues to ap­

peal to millions of teen-agers," the study said. "In fact, teen­agers are beginning to smoke at younger ages, with the age of initiation decreasing especially among girls." 
Some of them have nice things to say about smoking: That it helps them relax, that it keeps them from getting fat. And they think smoking for a year or two will do no harm, according to the study. 
The center, which is part of the Public Health Service, esti­mates that some 3. 7 million teen-agers smoke but that 92 percent of them say they don't plan to be smoking in another year. Only about 1.5 percent of them manage to quit, Moss said. 
"Teen-agers greatly under­estimate th~ addictiveness of tobacco and greatly overesti­mate their ability to control it," Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said in a statement. 
Overall, the prevalence of teen-age smoking declined dur­ing the 1970s and was stable through the 1980s, said the re­port. The interviews for the study were conducted in 1989.

Khmer Rouge troops h.old U.N. peacekeepers 



PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) ,_.IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIJIII-'I nomic sanctions on the Khmer 
-Khmer Rouge guerrillas refused Wednesday to release six unarmed U.N. peacekeep­ers, escalating tensions that threaten an accord on ending Cambodia's 13-year civil war. 
U.N. officials said a helicopter sent to look for the truce moni­tors was hit by gunfire, and a French officer on the craft suf­fered a back wound. 
"This is very unfortunate and very surprising," U.N. spokesman Eric Fait said. "Certainly the eyes of the world, the international community, are going to be looking at this episode very carefully. I'm sure (the Khmer Rouge) understands that it will have repercussions." 
In another development, Fait said six U.N. police were wounded Wednesday when their vehicles ran over newly laid anti-tank mines on a road near Siem Reap, 140 miles northwest of Phnom Penh. He said Khmer Rouge and gov-
Food relief cut off as battle rages in Bosnia 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herze­
. govina (AP) -No food relief reached Sarajevo on Wednes­day as fighting raged in the city's outskirts, and Bosnian defenders battled what they said was one of the heaviest Serb tank offensives. Outside the capital near the Croatian-held town of Kiseljak, a Danish U.N. peacekeeper was reported kidnapped by uni­formed men. The Dane, a corporal whose name was not released, was seen in the back of a car ac­companied by two identified men wearing combat fatigues, said Sgt. Antonio de Frutos, a spokesman for the peacekeep­ers. The car failed to stop when flagged down, he said. The worst fighting was in Otes, a suburb north of the air­port, where government forces have been under attack for three days from Serb artillery, tanks and mortars. Bosnian officers claim Serbs used a Nov. 12 cease-fire, which has since collapsed, to move at least 10 tanks into po­sition to attack Otes from three sides. They said the Serb strat­egy was to forge a link between Ilidza to the west of Sarajevo and Rajlovac to the northwest. About 6,000 people live in Otes, many of them refugees. Evacuation is difficult because of sniper fire and a shortage of cars. Among the residents holed up in a dark basement Wednesday were Habiba Hrgonja and her 3-year-old son, Ersan, whose thigh was injured Tuesday as

The Khmer Houge also have refused to give U.N. monitors unrestricted access to the 10 percent to 20 percent of the countryside they control, and its leaders are boycotting the U.N. effort to organize democratic elections in May. 
Further undermining the U.N. mission is a surge of political violence in the past month aimed at opposition politicians and their families. Many people blame the government, which denies responsibility. 
But the main fear is that the civil war could erupt again be­cause of the worsening rela­tions between the Khmer Rouge and .the 22,000 U.N. peacekeepers and officials sent to carry out the peace accord.

Senate votes to indict Collar 

BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -The Senate voted Wednesday to in­dict suspended President Fer­nando Collor de Mello, paving the way for a trial that could lead to his permanent ouster. 
On a 67-3 vote, the Senate approved a report accusing Collor of gross corruption. Eleven senators did not appear for the vote. 
The Chamber of Deputies impeached Collor on Sept. 29 and suspended him from office for six months after a probe showed he took more than $6.5 million from an illegal slush fund run by Paulo Gesar Farias, his 1989 campaign treasurer. 
The Senate will rule on Dec. 22 on whether to remove Collor from office permanently for the constitutional crime of "lack of decorum" stemming from his alleged links to the kickback scandal. 
If 54 of Brazil's 81 senators find Collor guilty, he will be of­ficially removed from the presidency and barred from holding public office for eight

Collor, who took office in 1990 as Brazil's first freely elected leader since 1960, has denied any ties to Farias, who is accused of extorting millions of dollars from businessmen in return for government favors and contracts. 
Collor, who was replaced by Vice President Hamar Franco, also faces criminal charges of corruption and criminal asso­ciation, crimes punishable by up to eight years in prison. 
Wednesday's vote was harshly criticized by Collor's supporters. 
"The vote was a great farce," said Sen. Lucidio Portella of the conservative Social Democracy Party. "It was purely political." 
Collor's lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to delay the Dec. 22 vote on grounds that 29 senators are biased against Collor because they took part in the three-month probe. 
No date has been set for the Supreme Court's decision.

Clinton to open inaugural festivities with trademark bus trip 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Presi­dent-elect Clinton will start his inaugural celebration with a trademark bus trip and end it with a White House open house, mixing invitation-only affairs with lots of free events for ordinary Americans, organizers said Wednesday. 
Clinton wants "an open in­augural, an accessible inaugu­ral and a dignified inaugural," said Democratic National Committee Chairman Ronald Brown, who also chairs the Presidential Inaugural Commit­tee. 
"It very much reflects the kind of campaign that Bill Clinton and AI Gore ran." 
The five days of festivities ­running Jan. 17 to 21 -will cost less than $20 million, paid for by private contributions and sales of tickets and souvenirs, Brown said. 
There will be at least eight free events, including a concert and fireworks at the Lincoln Memorial, an outdoor festival nearby on the Capital mall, as well as several events aimed at young people. 
At a Jan. 18 "American Gala" that is open to the public, the price of admission will be a donation of food or clothing to the homeless. 
Clinton will cap Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, with 10 invitation­only, black-tie balls for about 65,000 people. Tickets will sell for $125.

The ride will begin at Thomas Jefferson's Virginia home, Monticello, and be a mini­version of Clinton's campaign bus tours, complete with stops along the way and a well­publicized route so crowds can gather by the roadside. 
The decision to begin the festivities outside the capital was designed to show the inau­gural is not just a Washington insiders' affair, committee members said. 
"It is not just meant to signify what touched the American people during the course _of the campaign but to really touch American history and the fact that it is more than just what happens in Washington but how we bring our nation and our people together," said Brown. 
When Clinton arrives in Washington, he will go to the Lincoln Memorial for a public concert and fireworks. 

Bush to reach 1,OOOth Point of Light on New Year's Eve 
WASHINGTON (AP) -In the 
twilight of his presidency, Ge­
orge Bush's schedule has been 
shorn of all but a handful of du­
ties. But the White House still 
puts out one announcement 
without fail: Bush's daily Point 
of Light. 
Bush will honor his 1,OOOth 
Point of Light on New Year's 
Eve, thus fulfilling what began 
as a rhetorical flourish in his 
1988 convention speech and 
became a signature program to 
acknowledge community ser­
vice. 
C. Gregg Petersmeyer, who has shepherded the project from the beginning, once har­bored visions of all 1 ,000 points marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in Bush's second inau­
. gural parade. 
Now Petersmeyer -and 
presumably the program -will 
exit office with Bush in 
January. 
Those singled out for White House recognition have ranged from a Houston girl who spends lunch hours with disabled schoolmates to a volunteer ambulance squad in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant to Doris Tate, mother of murdered actress Sharon Tate and an advocate for victim's rights. 
Wednesday's Point of Light ­the 971st -lauded volunteers of the Edgehill Community Center of Nashville, Tenn., for

their efforts to make inner-city 
Nashville "a decent, drug-free 
and safe place to live." 
A wall of Petersmeyer's office is filled with cartoons with a point-of-light leitmotif. Many are sardonic, like one depicting a hobos' village of cardboard shacks, each burning a lonely candle. 
Petersmeyer views them all as evidence that Bush's message -government alone cannot solve the country's social ills ­has taken hold. 
At first, there was some ridicule. But more recently, he says, "I have not met one per­son who has found Points of Light amusing or silly." 
That means he hasn't met Garry Trudeau, whose "Doonesbury" comic strip has lampooned the program peri­odically. But Petersmeyer, like the program itself, looks on the bright side of things. 
"This relentless storytelling, a parable a day, has been a very powerful communications device," he said. 
Petersmeyer faced bureau­cratic resistance at the outset. There were fears the White House might end up honoring a secret child-molester. But the points have been largely scan­dal-free. And no one has ac­cused the White House Office of National Service of favoring Republican do-gooders.

Aholiday story with atwist 
Planner-Siegfried Players bring pre-finals cheer with their Christmas production 
By JENNIFER GUERIN 
Assistant Accent Editor 
They've tackled mystery-master Agatha Christie's "Mousetrap," and "NUTS" by Tom Toper, which was brought to life on the big screen by Barbra Streisand a few years ago. Last year they took a different approach, performing a rendition of the timeless favorite, "A Christmas Carol." 
This weekend, the Planner-Siegfried Players will attempt to inject some pre­final holiday cheer into the campus veins with "The Importance of Being Uncle Roscoe," a modern comedy of errors that throws a monkey wrench into the traditional holiday stories. 
"It's not a typical Christmas story," said director Greg Ripple, "but it has a Christmas message behind it." 
The play revolves around Mindy Kendall, played by freshman Alex Mensch, a 12 year-old cynic whose youth is sadly tainted by an inability to anticipate things, even during the Christmas season. Transforming her character becomes the project of Dexter Holly, the conman with an altruistic edge who takes shelter in the Kendall household while dodging the police. 
Dexter happens to enter the household while its members are encountering a series of their own problems. Taking advantage of the unusual situation in which he finds himself, he pretends to be Uncle Roscoe, a long-lost relative whom Mindy's mother Mary Ann, played by sophomore Ann Lillie, has not seen in over ten years but was expecting for a holiday visit. Mary Ann's husband Carl Kendall, played by Senior Bert Koehler, returns from work one afternoon to announce he lost his job, and to meet 


'The Importance of Being Uncle Roscoe' will run December 3 through 5 at 8:10 p.m. in

"Uncle Roscoe," whom he has great suspicions about. 
Impersonating Roscoe proves to be relatively easy for the expert Dexter and his sidekick, Kenny, but as events unfold, the situation becomes more and more complex. The arrival of the real Uncle Roscoe is only one of the many subplots developed in the course of this short, comedy-packed play. 
"Dexter is a 'magical' person who pulls the family together," said producer Bert Koehler. The path the Kendall family and their companions take to reach happiness, however, is a long and unusual one, full of comical incidents, a certain degree of deception, and the 
Victoria's Real Secret has a unique sound and lively concerts 
By MEGHAN KING 
Accent Writer 
"Tell NO we're not gonna eat their green eggs and ham," says Steve Sostak, lead singer for Victoria's Real Secret(VRS). 
VRS is a band of five Notre Dame sophomores that has gained campus­wide recognition over the past year and a half due to its unique sound and lively performances. "We're not looking to do what other people want us to do." 

Sostak finds that some people misinterpret the aim of VRS. He says, "Most of the people who have fun when we play are the ones who are willing to look at it like that: fun. Most people who are intimidated are people who see us and think we're trying to be hard." 
Sostak believes that VRS offers "a positive release of frustration." Says the former bassist, "The biggest thing is release. I can find a way to release emotion through music. People should try it." According to Sostak, "A lot of people don't understand how to release emotions in a correct way." 
"The stage, jumping around-I'm not really like that," says the singer, ''I'm pretty laid-back and soft-spoken." 
Besides release, Sostak believes VRS offers a variety of music. "There's nice variety," says the vocalist, "You don't get the same thing song after song. You get different ideas, but the same basic excitement." 
The music reflects the varying personalities in the band. VRS, made up of Sostak, Chris Daly and Ryan Halford on guitars, Marty Mennes on drums, and Paul Phillips on bass "reaches out to a universal crowd," says the singer. "You get your typical Darners and then your punk crowd. We act as a medium between both." 
Sostak describes the group's music as "fast-paced, but not killer sound" and refers to the lyrics as "sarcastic seriousness." The lead singer and songwriter claims, "If you wanna sit down and listen to our stuff, there's substance." He calls the lyrics to "The Green Iguana," one of the band's originals, "a totally serious rip into the bitter life." 
Another one of the band's originals, "Fish," contains lyrics that seem funny on the surface, but are serious underneath. The lines, "Put your line in the waterffest your bait for worms/ Do you like my pole?/ Can your lure me in?" are about a "playing-with-your-mind­type person," says Sostak, but also "a person who got kicked out of NO because he couldn't afford it." 
Despite the fact that Sostak and Daly wrote "Fish" in one day, Sostak claims, "It is probably our best overall tune," and it will be featured on the campus CD due out in the spring. 
The band's original sound earned them 

undeniable power of the Christmas "spirit." 
Koehler emphasized the good timing of this play for the students on campus. "With finals coming up, you often lose sight of Christmas," he said. "This is the University's only Christmas play." 
Both Koehler and Ripple stressed the need for easing students into the holiday spirit. Ripple, a junior, expressed his opinion that "The Importance of Being Uncle Roscoe" promotes traditional Christmas themes in a non-traditional manner. "The bad guy here is actually a good guy," he explained. In the spirit of the holidays, Ripple continued, "the emphasis of this play is not on taking or getting, but on giving." 
Except for covering overhead costs and saving enough money to put on next year's production, the Planner-Siegfried Players will donate all proceeds from the performance to Dismas House, the group's charity of choice since their first production four years ago. 
The Dismas House, with which many Notre Dame groups have developed close connections, is a halfway house intended to provide a supportive environment for ex-prisoners beginning to readjust to society. 
Koehler, who is producing the play for the first time this year, emphasized the hectic lifestyle that comes with putting together a quality performance. "We have a challenge cut out for us, but we like challenges," he said. Behind-the­scenes work has turned out to involve a tremendous commitment on the part of the crew, who built, painted, and moved the set. "Essentially, our cast is our crew," he admitted. 
Auditions for "The Importance of Being Uncle Roscoe" were held in September, and rehearsals began at the end of that month. After October break, the group began meeting three times a week, and last Monday, they moved into Washington Hall. 
With the exception of a select few cast members, the Planner-Siegfried Players is comprised entirely of underclassmen, and all but Kathleen Campbell, a junior who portrays Mindy's sister Charlene, are non-theatre majors. Ripple stressed the group's desire to offer students who enjoy theatre but do not have the opportunity to work on productions on a regular basis, the ability to participate in this year's production. 
Tickets for "The Importance of Being Uncle Roscoe" are-$3 for students, $5 for

the opening spot for the They Might Be Giants concert earlier this fall at Stepen Center. 
"It was definitely the height of everything so far. It was the rush," says the lead singer, who "honored the night with baldheadness" along with drummer, Mennes. "We played like 8 songs in 30 minutes. The whole thing was just playing in front of so many people," says Sostak. 
VRS also opened for Sea of Words in September, a local band trying to make it outside of campus. Says Sostak of Sea of Words, "The thing I like about bands like that is that they're supportive. They see some potential, I think." "We're going for it, definitely," says Sostak, ''I'm pretty sure everyone is serious about taking a couple of years off after we graduate and travelling." 
Sostak claims survival is the main goal of the group, "As long as we're surviving that's fine. I'm not looking to be a millionaire musician." 
VRS is determined to maintain their musical career. Says the singer, "We had a big meeting in my room and decided we were gonna practice really hard and work as waiters." 
Says Sostak, "We're in it for ourselves-to be good musicians for ourselves-and if that pleases other people, that's good. We're not gonna slow down. Hopefully the university will be supportive, and if they're not we're gonna have to work things out the hard way." 
Lately, VRS has been hibernating. "We're taking some time off to meditate and catch up on homework and act crazy," says the sophomore philosophy major. The group hopes to hit the road next semester and recently sent a 3­song, self-produced tape and a video of the They Might Be Giants show to several places in Chicago, Michigan, and Indiana.

Dancing to the top 
Dedication and discipline bring Julie Showalter fame in the world of Irish dancing 
Madrigal Dinners recreate the Renaissance-era 
By MARY SCHULTZE AND AMY 
BENNETT 
Accent Writers 
While many students were able to relax over the Thanksgiving break, Saint Mary's junior Julie Showalter had a very exhausting weekend. Over break, Showalter qualified for the North American National Irish Dancing Championship and earned $500 toward her trip to the World Championships in Ireland. 
For the third year in a row, Showalter, a member of the Dennehy School of Irish Dance in Chicago, won the "Senior Ladies 18 & Over" division of the Oireachtas, the Mid-American Irish Dancing Championship held November 27-29 at the Wyndham Hotel in Itasca, Illinois. 
This solo competition involved three rounds. The first two rounds consist of dancers competing two at a time in the reel. a soft shoe dance, and the treble jig, a hard shoe dance. 
After the scores from these rounds are tabulated. the top half of the competition is recalled to do two set dances. The set dances, performed in hard shoes, must be based on both a jig and hornpipe air. Through the movement of the feet and the sounds of the shoes, the set dances reflect some aspects of Irish life and history. 
After receiving the memorial cup for the ladies championship, Showalter and the "Senior Men's" Champion, John Timm of Ohio, showcased their talents at the annual Oireachtas dinner d<.mce, where they each received money for their traveling expenses from the Mid­American Irish Dancing Teachers Association. 
Showalter became interested in Irish dancing through a friend at the age of seven. "I took gymnastics, ballet, and horseback riding at the time, but as I got more involved [in Irish dancing] I dropped these because of the time

Are you in the mood for some unique food and entertainment? Saint Mary's College department of music has the answer: the 20th annual Madrigal Christmas Dinners. 
The dinners, a tradition for the departments of Music and Dance, as well as a Renaissance-era feast, are scheduled for this weekend and according to Indi Dieckgrafe, professor of Dance, will feature traditional Renaissance entertainment. 
A variety of performers will provide the entertainment during the meal, Dieckgrafe said. The Saint Mary's Women's Choir and the Saint Mary's­Notre Dame Collegiate Choir will perform pieces from the 16th century. Aside from the choirs, there will also be festive dancers and instrumental musicians. 
Many of the dances will focus on Rennissance-era work, according to Dieckgrafe. "There will be three different types of court dances representing the RenaissancL, · she said. 
These dances include the Bransle, a French selection; the Galliard, a livelier piece; and the Pavan, a dance that resembles a peacock's strut. 
A great deal of work has gone into this extravagant presentation of the Renaissance-era holiday feast, and the dances are representative of the way of life of the people of Renaissance times, according to Dieckgrafe. 
The ten major dancers have been rehearsing since September, Dieckgrafe said. Four Renaissance court dancers who represent the aristocracy of the era will perform more serene and serious dances, typical of the era. 
In addition, six peasant dancers do a dance representative of Renaissance

commitment Irish dancing requires," said Showalter. 
Before college, Showalter practiced between four to eight hours a day but the demands of school now limit her practice time to two to four hours a day. 
On weekends Showalter goes home to Chicago to practice with the Dennehy School, where she spends six to eight hours a day practicing. "My teacher, Marge Dennehy, comes to South Bend once a week with my mom, and on those

days I usually practice for five or six hours," Showalter says. When she isn't dancing, Showalter exercises for an hour and a half. 
peasant life. 
The dinners, according to Saint Mary's Public Relations Director Brett McLaughlin, are a re-creation of a traditional Renaissance-era holiday feast. They include a combination of the traditional meal as well as the traditional entertainment. 
The feast will include roast beef au jus, roasted potatoes, glazed carrots, a winter salad of apple, celery and nuts, wastylbrede, plum pudding, and wassail, a hot cinnamon-spiced Christmas punch. 
The dinners, are held December 4, 5 and 6, in the North Lounge of Regina Hall. Seating begins at 6:30 p.m. and the festivities begin at 7 p.m. each evening. 
Tickets are $22.50 and can be purchased at the Saint Mary's box office in O'Laughlin Auditorium, open 10 a.m. to 4 
p.m. Monday through Friday. Ticket order forms can be made by calling the box office at (219) 284-4626. 


Irish dancing requires much more discipline and practice that most people realize. "People don't understand what the big deal is until they watch me practice. You always have to keep your arms at your sides, even during leaps," stated Showalter. 
Irish dancers compete in soft shoes and hard shoes. "The leather soft shoes are similar to toe shoes worn for ballet, but you're still required to be up on your toes," said Showalter. "You end up with a lot of crushed and broken toes, especially when you have to practice a lot." The hard shoes are heavier and have firmer soles than the soft shoes. "They look like the old Pilgrim shoes, but they have Fiberglas on the bottom." 
Competing in Irish dancing can be very expensive. "Costumes range anywhere from $100 to over $1000, and that's not even including shoes," said Showalter. The soft shoes run about $30, and Showalter goes through two pairs a month. The hard shoes cost around $80 a pair and have to be re-tipped every 
three months, a process which costs $40. 
Showalter's parents have paid for most of her traveling expenses and have supported her in every endeavor. "My parents are very supportive, in fact they're probably the most supportive parents in Irish dancing," stated Showalter. "They go with me to competitions as often as they can. And it's really great to have your parents behind you." 
Showalter's hours of practice and devotion have given her great success. She won the "Senior Ladies" division of the North American National Irish Dancing Championships in Florida in the summer of 1992, competing against over 90 women. 
She has placed first in her division of the National and the Oireachtas for the past seven years. This Easter, Showalter will travel to Ireland in hopes of being the first female American champion. 
"I want to be the first American in my division to win the World Championships," said Showalter. "When I achieve this, I'd like to retire and be teaching Irish dancing in about two years time." 
Although she devotes much of her practice time to her solo dances, Showalter also competes in group dances and participates in numerous performances around Chicago. Saint Patrick's Day is a busy time of year for Showalter and her fellow Dennehy dancers. 
The dancers perform between seven and 11 shows a night during the time around Saint Patrick's Day. "It's kind of wild, everyone's throwing green beer and by the end of the night you're exhausted." 
Despite the time commitment, Showalter says Irish dancing is worth what she puts into it. "The people you meet and the places you get to go ­that's what I like best about it," concluded Showalter. "It's really neat to have friends all over the world."

The Challenge of Adult Christianity 

During these days, and until the end of the semester, students are signing up 
with Campus Ministry to take part in a program called "Communities NO." If you are an undergraduate, we hope you will join . 
Designed for first year, sophomore, and junior class students, the program will begin with a "Rally" in the LaFortune Ballroom on the first Saturday of second semester, January 16, and then involves a further commitment by the participants to meet together six times during the Spring semester of 1993. Each meeting will provide opportunity for prayer, reflection upon Scripture, discussion about issues of life and faith, and investigation into the teachings of our religious traditions. After these first six meetings, the group will decide whether to continue its life into the year(s) to come. 
Campus Ministry will work with the names and schedules of all those who sign up for the program and will match up the groups. Campus Ministry will also propose a format for the meetings and suggest the opening topics for discussion. 
Each group, a mixture of men and women, will meet in the dorm rooms or study lounges of the participants. Leadership will rotate among the members. 
Hopefully, over time, through the experience of shared prayer and honest discussion, trust will grow and the members will discover a safe place to talk about their lives, their questions, and their hopes. 
"Nobody goes to heaven by themselves." This time-honored saying wants to teach us the need for community. It reminds us we need friendship and support; we need challenge and direction. We need companions for our journey, for we travel through a world often unfriendly to our professed values and hostile to our faith. "Communities NO" hopes to answer these needs in a way suitable to our time and our location. 
How often it feels like no one listens to our concerns. How often it feels like we are struggling in our lives alone. How often it feels like our faith floats somewhere, out there in the clouds, while our lives trudge along down here in the muddy trenches. 
Perhaps a deeper experience of community and a stronger grasp of our 
traditions can change some of that. 
Notre Dame is a high-pressure place, where just about everybody works too much. Lots of people deal with stress. A typical answer to the question "How are you?" is "Fine, I guess; I'm surviving." Maybe a regular chance, twice a month, to speak confidentially with eight or nine other people we trust can bring new energy and perspective to our many and various pursuits. 
Graduating seniors often face their future lives beyond the stop light at Angela and Notre Dame Avenue with an awkward worry about how they will live rightly in the world. They have probably heard a zillion sermons through their four years here and taken at least a couple of theology classes. Maybe they have gone to Appalachia over some Break or done an Urban Plunge, Perhaps they have been involved in some kind of volunteer service, or helped organize the liturgies in their dorm chapel. Now as they set off into their adulthood, diploma in hand, they ask "What does my Christianity have to do with it all? How is it shaping my life? How is it guiding my choices?'' A couple of weeks before graduation is a tough time to wrestle with such demanding questions. A couple of semesters with a program like "Communities NO" might be a better approach. 
And so, the invitation is before us. The experience of Christians throughout the years and around the world tells us that the formation of community is an essential element of living faith. A group of faculty, rectors, and students have worked for several months preparing a program that would foster the growth of small communities of faith here on our campus. They have tried to tailor it to the needs and behaviors of Notre Dame undergrads. I think the program will be a good one. 
Memo to the members of the classes of 1994, 95, and 96: please sign up for "Communities NO" at the Campus Ministry office in the Library or in Badin Hall before you go home for Christmas. Santa will be good to you if you do.

Reggie Lewis leads Celtics over Jordan-less Bulls 
BOSTON (AP) -The Chicago Bulls couldn't stop Reggie Lewis, and Boston didn't have to stop Michael Jordan as the Celtics won 101-96 Wednesday night. 
Lewis scored 16 of his season­high 32 points when the Celtics surged ahead in the third quar­ter with 68 percent shooting. 
They outscored Chicago 57-45 in the second half as the Bulls floundered without Jordan, sidelined with a sprained left foot he injured in a 112-75 loss at New York Saturday. 
Jordan missed just three other games in seven seasons, and Chicago lost them all -104-95 to Boston in 1988-89, and 126­114 to Phoenix and 115-100 to Cleveland last season. He was hurt in two of them, and served a one-game suspension at Phoenix for bumping a referee. The first of those games broke his streak of 235 straight games. 
With Boston trailing 66-60, Lewis' 18-footer with 4:40 left in the third quarter started an 18-4 run that put the Celtics on top 7 8-70 with one period left. Lewis had 10 points during the surge. 
McDaniel had 10 points as the Celtics outscored Chicago 34-19 in the third quarter. They hit 17 of 25 shots, with Lewis making 8 of 9, while the Bulls sank 9 of 23. 
Horace Grant led the Bulls with 20 points. 
Blazers 112, Pacers 1 03 
INDIANAPOLIS-Reserve forward Cliff Robinson scored a career-high 31 points, rallying Portland from a 16-point deficit to victory over Indiana. 
The Blazers outscored the Pacers 18-6 in the first 5:19 of the fourth period to pull ahead 95-86. 
Portland rallied despite having only one starter, point guard Terry Porter, on the floor in a three-guard alignment and getting only four second-half points from Clyde Drexler, who

teams, rather than the number of strong teams in each region, was considered in Stanford's placement. 
"It was predetermined that the West's number two team (Stanford) would be moved to the region of the lowest ranked top team,~ Noonan remarked. Hence, the Mideast was chosen since Illinois, its top team, is ranked below Long Beach State and Florida, the top teams in the other regions. The relative weakness of the Northwest out­side of Long Beach State was irrelevant, as were the Mideast's strong teams ranked close behind Illinois. 
The bottom line is that Notre Dame is in for a tougher match finished with 15. 
Porter, who scored 21 points, gave the Blazers the lead for good at 81-80 on a drive with 
10:39 left. 
Reggie Miller led Indiana with 27 points, while Detlef Schrempf had 26 points and 11 rebounds for the Pacers. 
Nets 122, Hawks 115 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.­Chris Morris scored 19 points, including a midcourt shot to highlight a 20-5 run against Atlanta that led New Jersey to its fourth straight victory. 
The win put Nets (8-7) over the .500 mark for the second time this season, a stark con­trast from a year ago when the club opened the season 3-12. 
Derrick Coleman, who missed the last two games with back problems, led New Jersey with 21 points, and Drazen Petrovic had 20. Stacey Augmon topped Atlanta with 22, while Do­minique Wilkins scored 18 on 5­for-22 shooting. 
The loss was only the second in seven games for the Hawks, who played the final 26 minutes without second-leading scorer Kevin Willis. The big forward was ejected by referee Joe Crawford in the first half. 
Spurs 98, 76ers 82 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) -David Robinson had 27 points and a season-high 21 rebounds as San Antonio handed Philadelphia its fifth consecutive loss·. 
Antoine Carr had a season­high 25 points for the Spurs, who won for only the second time in seven road games. Kenny Payne had 17 points and Hersey Hawkins 14 for the Sixers, now 1-6 at home. 
The Spurs led by nine and scored the first eight points of the period for a 78-61 lead. San Antonio built its margin to 93­76 on a 3-pointer by Robinson with 3:45 to play.

Several standout players will take the floor for both teams. Notre Dame is led by senior middle blocker and All-America candidate Jessica Fiebelkorn. Fiebelkorn set school records for digs in a season and a ca­reer, while leading the team in blocks and placing second in kills.

Whether or not Notre Dame is ready to upset the lions, the NCAA berth itself is a move forward for the whole program. 
"This is a real important step toward establishing ourselves as a top program," Brown ex­plained. "We want this (playing in the NCAA) to become a habit, and this is a good start."

Pats' Zolak loses starting QB job to healthy Millen 
Popular QB expected change 
FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -Scott Zolak has shown he can be a winning NFL quarterback. Now he's back on the bench of one of the league's losingest teams. 
The second-year pro who brought excitement and victo­ries to a New England Patriots team that had neither, will be replaced by Hugh Millen for Sunday's game against Indi­anapolis. 
Millen said Wednesday his separated left shoulder, which sidelined him for the last five games and six of the last seven, is well enough so he can throw in his usual rhythm. 
"The biggest decision, as it always has been in this matter, is Hugh's health," Patriots acting coach Dante Scarnecchia said. "Up until this week, he hasn't been ready to play." 
The club is adhering to its pol­icy that a starter can't lose his job through injury. Scarnecchia said Millen, who may need mi­nor surgery in the offseason, is no more susceptible to injury than he would be next season. 
In his first NFL start, Zolak guided an 0-9 team to a 37-34 overtime victory over the Colts. He completed 20 of 29 passes for 261 yards and two touch­downs. He bowed to the crowd after one scoring pass and showed more emotion than Millen. 
"He's proved that he can play in this league," Scarnecchia said. "The three weeks that he was our starter was in many respects a blessing for him." 
Zolak's production dropped in his second game, a 24-3 victory over the New York Jets in which he threw for 102 yards. Then last week he completed 9 of 15 passes for 58 yards, two interceptions and no touch­downs in a 34-0 loss at Atlanta. It dropped the Patriots to 2-10, tied with Seattle for the NFL's worst record. 
Zolak said Millen would have regained the starting spot Sun­day "if I'd have thrown for five touchdowns against the Fal­
{;Ons." 
Although he'd like to remain the starter, ''I'm not going to cause any trouble," Zolak said. "Everybody knows now. The fans, the coaches, the front-of­fice people, they know I can play. 
"I feel I'll be back in there before the year is over," Zolak' added. Millen· "is one hit away" from being hurt. 
Zolak said he expected to be benched when Millen was healthy but was surprised to find out it would be next Sun­day. 
"He was the main man at the beginning of the year," Zolak said. "There's nothing you can do about it." 
Millen started 13 games last year, his first full season as a starter after signing as a Plan B free agent from Atlanta. In six games this season, he com­pleted 119 of 192 passes for eight touchdowns and 10 inter-

ceptions. ·The shoulder injury he sus­tained in the opener became more severe in the fifth game against San Francisco, and sidelined him for a five-game stretch after the seventh game against Cleveland. 
Tommy Hodson played the next two games before a frac­tured thumb gave Zolak his shot. 
"My shoulder's healed to the 

point where it doesn't affect my passing motion," Millen said Wednesday. ''I'm eager to play. It's my job." 
Asked if he thought he'd be. playing Sunday if Zolak had done better against Atlanta, Millen said, "I don't know.... If pigs could fly, how high would they go? The circumstances are what they are." 
Wide receiver Irving Fryar said, "Scott is more flamboyant than Hugh" but that livelier spirit may not have contributed to the wins. 
"We just came together as a team," Fryar said. "We were long overdue." 
Millen started just four games in his first five NFL seasons be­fore being signed by the Patri­ots. He was 5-8 in his 13 starts in 1991, completing 60.2 per­cent of his passes for 3,073 yards. 
Ditka's surprising decision fuels more controversy in Bears' camp 
LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) ­Now there is a quarterback controversy. 
Coach Mike Ditka finally cre­ated one Wednesday when he announced that Peter Tom Willis would start next Monday night at Houston instead of Jim Harbaugh. 
Willis was given his first start last week at Cleveland where the Chicago Bears suffered a fifth straight defeat by losing to the Browns 27-14. 
Harbaugh, who had started 28 straight games, took that decision in stride, playing the part of the "Good Soldier" and saying he would do everything he could to help Willis and the 
team to win. But this time it was a different story. 
"I'm extremely disappointed and surprised," said Harbaugh. "I just want to play. I'm prepared for everything. I felt like I was going to play. No, he (Ditka) didn't give me a rea­son." 
Because the game is in the Astrodome where noise is a factor, it was expected that Harbaugh, because of his ex­perience, would regain the starting role. 
"P. T. will start," said Ditka. "It's just a decision, it's my de­cision. I thought P. T. did a good job, he performed okay. He had one bad play but everybody has a bad play. He deserves another chance to start." 
Ditka said he told both quar­terbacks to be ready to play but "it is hard to please everybody." 

Ditka added that a lot is said about quarterbacks but "the main thing depends on what the team does. We don't want to put too much emphasis on the quarterback. Our first goal is to win a football game." 
Willis, who completed 19 of 26 passes for 285 yards and two touchdowns against Cleveland, also threw an interception that David Brandon returned 92 yards for a touchdown in the frrst quarter. 
"I'm happy over the decision," said Willis about his second start. "I can see it either way. I'm not worried about being· surprised or not surprised." 
Asked if he would do anything different, Willis said "''m going to try not to throw an intercep­tion in a tight spot. Other than the interception, I thought I played well." 
As for the noise factor, Willis said "I've played in a lot of noisy places in college." 


If the Bears lose at Houston it will be their sixth straight, matching their longest losing streak under Ditka when they lost their last six games in 1989. 
Shortly before that streak, Ditka had exploded after a loss and said "This team is in disar­ray, I don't think we'll win an­other game." 
The team record is eight straight losses in 1978. With three of their last four games

Bonds negotiating blockbuster deal with Yankees 
NEW YORK (AP) -Barry Bonds' agent and the New York Yankees talked late into the night and are set to negotiate again today as they try to com­plete a contract for the most prized free agent of the season. 
Dennis Gilbert negotiated in Los Angeles Tuesday night with New York general manager Gene Michael. who had traveled to Las Vegas earlier in the day to meet with free agent pitcher .Greg Maddux. No contract was agreed to when talks ended just before midnight PST, sources 
said. 
Several sources, speaking on 
the condition of anonymity, said 
Gilbert wanted to complete a 
deal prior to the winter meet­
ings, which begin this weekend 
at Louisville, Ky. 
The Yankees, the Atlanta 
Braves and the Los Angeles 
Dodgers are said to be the 
teams most interested in sign­
ing Bonds. Los Angeles' starting 
outfield was completed Tuesday 
after the Dodgers re-signed Eric 
Davis to a $1 million, one-year 
deal. 
Atlanta Braves president Stan 
Kasten on Tuesday said he 
didn't believe the Braves would 
be able to meet Bonds' price, 
although Braves general man­
ager John Schuerholz said early 
in the evening, "We're still 
talking." 
Last month, Bonds won his 
second National League Most 
Valuable Player Award for the 
Pittsburgh Pirates. He hit .311 
last season with 34 homers and 
103 RBis. 
The 28-year-old Gold Glove 
left fielder, who also won the 
MVP award in 1990, has driven 
in 100 or more runs and hit 25 
or more homers for three con­
secutive seasons, leading Pitts­
burgh to three straight NL East 
titles. 
Bonds made $5.15 million in 1992, the fourth-highest income in baseball. But the Pirates said they couldn't afford to sign him to a long-term deal. 
Since the end of the season, the Pirates have traded second baseman Jose Lind, watched Doug Drabek sign Tuesday with Houston and released pitchers Bob Patterson, Roger Mason and Vicente Palacios, and out­fielders Cecil Espy and Gary Varsho. In addition, Danny Jackson and Alex Cole were taken in the expansion draft. 
New York, gearing up for owner George Steinbrenner's reinstatement, is going in the other direction, attempting to sign a high-priced starting pitcher. 
The Yankees made large . offers to Drabek and Jose 
Guzman, but both went else­
where for less money. 


Free agent signings highlight a busy off-season for baseball 
NEW YORK (AP) -Doug Drabek and Jose Guzman have new teams and Barry Bonds may not be far behind. 
Drabek and the Houston As­tros agreed Tuesday to a four­year contract worth $19.5 mil­lion, and Guzman and the Chicago Cubs agreed to a four­year deal worth $14.35 million. Eric Davis, meanwhile, re­turned to the Los Angeles Dodgers a big cut fromn the $3.1 million he made last sea­son, agreeing to a one-year deal for $1 million guaranteed and the chance to earn another $1 million if he's healthy. And infielder Scott Fletcher and the Boston Red Sox agreed to a $1.2 million, two-year contract. Also, Cincinnati claimed first baseman Tommy Gregg on waivers from the Atlanta Braves and Gregg agreed to a one-year contract worth $375,000. And Greg Swindell became the first free agent of­fered arbitration this offseason.

He and the Cincinnati Reds may now continue to negotiate through Jan. 8. 
In other baseball news on a busy day, the San Francisco Giants fired manager Roger Craig and hired Bob Quinn as general manager. Quinn was fired by the Cincinnati Reds last month. 
The two big deals for pitchers came a day after John Smiley's $18.4 million, four-year con­tract with the Cincinnati Reds. They left Swindell, Greg Mad­dux, David Cone and Chris Bo­sio as the top available free­agent pitchers. Maddux met Tuesday at Las Vegas with Michael, while Swindell pro­posed a contract to the Astros. 
Houston said Drabek's deal was prompted by a change in owners. Drayton McLane's purchase from John McMullen was finalized on Nov. 2. 
"This is the most significant acquisition this club had made in quite some time, possibly a

. decade," Astros general man­ager Bill Wood said. "Hopefully we'll be able to get back to­gether soon for another an­nouncement or announcements, dep-ending on how things break." Drabek, who earned $4.5 mil­lion last year, wanted to play close to his home in The Wood­lands, a Houston suburb. In May, he rejected a $19.5 mil­lion, four-year offer to remain with the Pirates. In the deal he agreed to, he gets a $1 million signing bonus, $4 million in each of the next two seasons and $4.75 million each in 1995 and 1996. The Astros have a $5 million option for 1997 and must pay a $1 million buyout if they don't exercise it. "When the new management took over, I could tell from The Woodlands the excitement that was building and the planning for the future," Drabek said. The 30-year-old right-hander, who won the NL Cy Young 

Cubs won't attempt to re-sign Maddux, the National League Cy Young Award winner. 
"Our offer is off the table," Cubs general manager Larry Himes said.· 
Guzman, who has spent his entire career with the Rangers, had two strong years after missing 1989 with a torn rota­tor cuff and spending 1990 in the minors on injury rehabili­tation assignments. He made his major league debut with the Rangers in September 1985. 
"We talked about a contract right until the end," Rangers general manager Tom Grieve said. "I thought it was in the ballpark, but it obviously wasn't good enough. Maybe it was in the bleachers and they were at second base." 
Guzman, who made $1,465,000 last season, gets a $1.5 million signing bonus, $3,125,000 in each of the next two seasons and $3.3 million each in 1995 and 1996. He said

Davis, who completed a $9.3 million, three-year deal last season, will get a bonus of $5,494.50 for each day he's on the active roster next season and available to play. The Dodgers also agreed to let him become a free agent again after the 1993 season. 
The 30-year-old outfielder, traded to the Dodgers from Cincinnati after the 1991 sea­son, played in a career-low 76 games in 1992 and hit just .228 with five home runs and 32 RBis. He was disabled May 23 because of a separated left shoulder and on Aug. 2 because of a fractured left wrist. 
Fletcher, who made $300,000 last season, gets a $50,000 signing bonus from Boston, $650,000 next season and $700,000 in 1994. 
In other free agent news, Kirby Puckett met with the Philadelphia Phillies. Dave Winfield's agent rejected an of­fer from the Toronto Blue Jays and said he's begun serious talks with other teams, and the Atlanta Braves said they were interested in reliever Todd Worrell.

Saint Mary's basketball squeaks by Hope College 


·:.~#~~~~;,,,:.=:==A~I~~:t: 
By EILEEN MCGUIRE 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's basketball team (2-2) traveled to Holland, Michigan Monday night and it turned out to be a worthwhile trip as they defeated Hope Col­lege 77-72. 
"It's always nice to win away from home," stated Coach Marvin Wood. "And this was a big win for us. We have about four or five key games which 
Byrd's spinal surgery successful 
HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP)­Dennis Byrd underwent seven hours of surgery Wednesday that successfully stabilized his spinal cord. He remains without motion in his legs and fingers and other portions of the left side of his upper body. 
"The goal was to stabilize the spine, and that was achieved," said Dr. Elliott Hershman, the New York Jets' physician. "The longterm prognosis has not changed." 
Byrd broke the fifth cervical vertebra when he collided with teammate Scott Mersereau while trying to make a tackle last Sunday. He has had no vol­untary motion in his legs since then, although he does have some sensation in his legs. 
"There was extensive dam­age," Hershman said. 
Asked if Byrd might walk again someday, Hershman said, "That's very difficult to answer. I prefer to use the term we are hopeful." 
He did say that it probably would be within two years that the ability to walk would return -if it ever does. 
"The overall amount of im­provement that may occur will 
SPORTS BRIEFS 
take some time to determine," Hershman said. Walking again depends "strictly on his ability to heal, time and his body's ability to heal." 
After removal of disc material in the region of the break, a piece of bone from the pelvis and two plates with nine screws were inserted into the neck to stabilize the area, Hershman said. 
Byrd also was given doses of Synex, an investigational drug to promote healing of the spinal cord. Synex is not approved for use in the United States and Hershman said permission was needed from Byrd's family and the drug's manufacturer to use it. It was the first time Lenox Hill Hospital had used Synex, he said. 
"He tolerated the drug well," Hershman said. "The benefit of it is to promote the healing of the spinal cord. We don't know how much effect it has." 
Hershman said there were no known side effects from using the drug. 
For the next 48-72 hours, Byrd will be watched for signs of infection and monitored for will determine what kind of season we'll have and this was one of them." 
The Belles were ahead the entire game, but could never separate the score by more than seven points. The Belles had a tough time keeping Hope's Katie Kowalczy's three­pointers in check. 
"Every time we had a nice lead she would bang in one of those three-pointers," explained Coach Wood. "It was pressure-packed from beginning to end." stated Coach Wood. "In the end 

"It was a total team effort," of the game we won because we stated Co-Captain Julie Snyder. worked harder than them." "They would catch up and tie Four of the Belles scored in but we came right back at double-figures with co-captains them." Snyder and Kim Holmes leading 
Offensively, the Belles made the scoring with 18 and 15 excellent decisions. They played points respectively. like a team, giving the ball to Co-Captain Kristin Crowley the open players and committing no turnovers in the ever-so-critical last four min­utes of the game. 
"We played extremely well," 
immobile for so long. 

Byrd will begin rehabilitation after that and should be re­leased from Lenox Hill within two weeks. He then would go to a rehab center for several months. 
Byrd, 26, did not sever his spinal cord. 
"The prognosis is somewhat better for patients with incom­plete lesions," Hershman said. "That's not to say all people with incomplete lesions heal." 
The defensive lineman has use of his deltoid muscles and his biceps. His right triceps are "fairly functional, but his left are not," Hershman said. 
Byrd has right wrist function, but none in his left wrist. He has no finger flexion in either hand. · 
"He can bring his arms from side to side, forward and back," Hershman said. 
In the ambulance on the way to the hospital from Giants Sta­dium, Byrd said all he wanted to do "was hug my girls again." 
He should be able to hug wife Angela and 2-year-old daughter Ashtin again, Hershman said.

A few predictions for the college hoops season 
Dec. 5-In the big game against Kansas University, Indiana loses 87-84. Beloved IU coach Bobby "I was too cruel for West Point" Knight throws two chairs, eats his own sweater and slams dunks a referee into a Gatorade container.

Dec. 8-For fear of structural damage to the J.A.C.C., the Notre Dame-IU game is cancelled.

Fencing prepares for optimistic upcoming season 
Irish volleyball heads to NCAA's 
By DAN PIER 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's volleyball team likes to face a challenge. Aft P,~ falling just short of making NCAA Cl:ul~r.f-' pionships last year, the Irish did that. earning its second-ever trip to the tournament this season. Now Notre Dame is treated to a greater challenge: a first round road match against ninth­ranked Penn State. 
The Nittany Lions rolled up a 27-3 regular season and placed second in the Big Ten behind Illinois. The Irish opponents are particularly tough to handle at home, where they are 183-8 since 1980, including 69 wins in their last 70 games at Rec HalL 
The difficult draw is made more frustrating for Notre Dame since the Irish anticipated a fourth seed in the Mideast Regional part of the tournament, consistent with their pre-tournament regional ranking. That spot would have secured a first-round match pitting the Irish against fifth-seeded Colorado. 
However, the NCAA had determined to move one team out of the very strong West Region. That team was Stanford, which the selection committee placed first in the Mideast, dropping all the other teams one spot. The move forces Notre Dame, now the fifth seed, to meet the Nittany Lions, now number four in the region. 
"I thought that Stanford would go to another region," said Irish head coach Debbie Brown of the move. "The Mideast has three teams in the coaches' top ten, so I thought they would go to the Northwest. But there were pros and cons involved in every option (the NCAA) had." 
Donna Noonan of the NCAA explained that the ranking of the regions' top

firmed by the NCAA. Because Panyi is an international stu­dent, the NCAA is currently going through the process of confirming her eligibility by verifying her amateur status and her having met academic requirements. 
In the meantime, Panyi has been getting the job done both on the fencing strip and in the classroom. After a month and a half of hard work in practice, Panyi and her teammates are anxious to begin the season. 
And the individual talent possessed by this team should provide some excellent results against the difficult opponents found on the Irish's schedule.

Although the Notre Dame fencing squad has the month of December off as far as meets are concerned, the fencers are working hard each day to prepare for the winter season. 
The dual meet season will open when the Irish head to Evanston, Illinois on January 16 and 17. This opening meet will include 1992 NCAA seventh-place finisher Wayne State, along with MIT and Cal State Long Beach, and feature some very strong men's fencers and a tough women's squad from Temple.

A good indication of how last night's Saint Mary's swim meet went is the fact that Belles coach Dennis Cooper was so angry h'O' refused a post-meet interview. 
That's how bad it went. 
Albion College routed the Belles 186-101, winning 14 out of the 16 total events. 
"The lack of enthusiasum and expected depth made a win impossible,"noted junior Jen Gustafson. 
Laurie Beth Kerns and Jill Cooper, both freshmen, took first place in the 100 yard breaststroke and the 200 yard breaststroke, respectively, for the Belles' only two winning events. However, several others made good showings. 
Maura Sullivan, a first-year swimmer, swam her first ever 100 butterfly in 1:17.72 and placed third in the 200 yard freestyle. Other outstanding personal achievements were junior Katie Northrup's time of 

2:26.46 in the 200 butterfly and freshman Katie Rose's second-place time of 1:07.15 in the 100 yard backstroke. 
Though there were no divers to compete in either the one meter or three meter diving events, the Belles had hoped to make these points up in other events. 
Unfortunately, with several swimmers stricked with .the flu and the lack of training over Thanksgiving break this was not possible. Albion's 13 swimmers had the enthusia­sum and the depththat the Belles lacked to come away with the win. 
The Belles still have high hopes as they travel to Val­praiso to compete in a tri-meet this Saturday.
