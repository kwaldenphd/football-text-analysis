The University has proposed closing Juniper Road and

While the safety of pedestri-. ans crossing Juniper to reach campus buildings and parking lots is one· reason for closing Juniper, University officials also say they want to maintain the relatively small, pedestri­an nature of the campus. "It's not just about safety; we want to keep campus small," said University archi­tect Doug Marsh. Officials say closing Juniper would allow a campus devel­opment boundary to be creat­_ed, so that new buildings are constructed within the current footprint, rather than expand­ing the campus, which offi­cials say they have no desire

Gay marriage rulings m.ay affect ND housing

The University Office of Residence llie and Housing could face allowing same-sex marriage partners to reside in campus mar­riage housing residents if Massachusetts' ruling allowing same-sex marriages becomes a national trend.

While students were vacation­ing over winter break, the Office of Information Technology was hard at work on the largest net­work upgrade ever at the University. A team of engineers visited each residence hall and replaced the approximately 220 switches that connect students to the network, in addition to other improvements. 
The upgrade was implemented not only to quicken the speed of the network, but to improve the reliability and manageability of the network, as well, officials said. 
While the network received approximately a tenfold improve­ment in raw speed, from 10 megabits to 100 megabits for each student's computer, Dewitt Latimer, Notre Dame's chief tech-marriage, but does not specify that the couples must be male and female, which would create a loophole if Indiana acknowledged gay civil unions. 
However Mary Gude, assistant vice president of student atTairs and standing committee chair for gay and lesbian student needs, said she was not concerned about the Massachusetts ruling having any immediate effect on the Indiana marriage law, nor did she consider the contract inflexible. 
"Indiana would be at the end of the line on [changing the mar­riage law]," Gude said. "If and when the day ever came ... [the contract] would probably change to specify that the marriage must be between a heterosexual cou­ple. " 


As a Catholic institution, the University is required to uphold the teaching of the Catholic Church that does not grant or acknowledge gay marriage. This extends to University housing, as well. 
"The official doctrine of the Church is that marriage is between a man and a woman," said Gude. "The wording [of the contract] would have to be changed." 
According to the mission state­ment of the Office of Resident llie and Housing, "The University encourages a way of living conso­nant with a Christian community and manifest in prayer, liturgy and service. Residential life endeavors to develop that sense of community that is at once more human and more divine."

nology officer, emphasized other advantages. 
"This upgrade replaced 5 year­old equipment that was costing us a lot of money to maintain <i:nd repair," Latimer said. "The switches we put in are easier to maintain, can be managed remotely, and overall will cost us less money to run." 
The switch closet'i -7 5 of them in 62 buildings -were upgraded, as well. Many air conditioning units were not adequate, and some buildings had no air condi­tioning. potentially allowing equip­ment to overheat and suffer dam­age. Where necessary, those sys­tems were replaced or new ones were installed, Latimer said. 
Uninterruptible power supplies, or battery backups, were also installed in each switch closet, allowing the campus network to continue to function for some time should the power go out. Dust and dirt were cleaned out of the closets that had accumulated over the years as well, reducing the possibility of it causing problems. 
This is not the only thing OIT has been doing, Latimer said. During the fall semest~r. network equipment was upgraded in DeBartolo, Grace and Flanner halls, and the wireless network 
continues  to  be  expanded,  
Latimer said.  
"We  obviously  have  more  

desires than we have dollars, and we're trying to pick the most cost­effective improvements to the net­work. This major upgrade to ResNet kept coming up, and so we did that over break -but that's not all we're doing," he said. "We're hoping to make more upgrades to the campus network, including offering more bandwidth and more flexibility for everyone who uses the network."

ND starts dialogue program 
By MATTHEW SMEDBERG News Writer 
The signs began to go up in September: "Had enough talk? Engage in sustained dialogue." Others asked "What do Princeton and UVA have that Notre Dame doesn't? Sustained Dialogue." Students won­dered what they might mean. Thursday night, in the Coleman-Morse lounge, they found out. 
In the course of the town hall meeting commemorat­ing Martin Luther King Jr., Tessa Garcia, student gov­ernment's diversity chair­person, stood up to announce the inception of a new initiative called Sustained Dialogue meant to help break down diversi­ty barriers on campus. 
The program involves small groups of eight to 12 individuals, each of whose background is different. These people will meet twice a month over the course of a semester or year. After agreeing to con­fidentiality, they will dis­cuss issues surrounding their own experiences with diversity; if all goes according to plan, they will be able to share very per­sonal information so that others can learn to value them and what they stand for. 
Sustained Dialogue developed out of work done by Harold Saunders, a U.S.

"Father of the Bride" it wasn't.

Alexander's spot­light-craving high school ex-girlfriend onto prime time 
entertainment news. 
The worst part was what the 55-hour debacle inadvertently pointed out: While Britney's celebrity was enough to merit a legal annulment, her heterosexuality was enough to merit an equally legal marriage. 
The debate over whether Britney's or any other marriage should be labeled "holy matrimony," "civil union" or some­thing in between reached its boiling point over the holidays, when the release of a New York Times/CBS News poll showed 55 percent ofAmericans to be in favor ofa proposed constitutional amendment to restrict marriage to a union between a man and a woman. 
VVhile most supporters acknowledge that an amendment won't automatically make the "straight lightbulb" go off in homosexuals' heads, the promise that the gay lifestyle will remain in the shad­ows instead of on the altars is enough to win their support. Most of the 55 per­cent likely feel guilty about outright intolerance but have no qualms telling gays to keep their "confused" hands off a "sacred institution" and thus their commitment out ofsight. 
President Bush has publicly endorsed the idea of an amendment and plans to stress it as a major issue of the 2004 election campaign, most likely under the exploitative assumption that his Democratic opponent would refuse to sign it into law. As the party lines become entrenched and the shouts on each side get louder, it becomes easy to overlook the question at the root ofthe debate-whose job is it to decide? 
Is it the President, Congress, the Supreme Court? Or is it the two people who are enough in love that they are willing face the daily disapproval of announcing that love for all to hear? Is the sanctity of marriage truly more threatened by homosexual couples' per­ceived lack of"normalcy" than it is by the lack a seriousness and loyalty -a problem undeniably rampant in the tra­ditional man-and-wife match? 
If amendment supporters truly believe that it is up to the government to pre­vent homosexuals from marrying, they have every right to propose it. But it would serve them well to find a better disguise for their discomfort with gays -tellingly the poll found the strongest support for~ay marriage among those who actually know gays personally­than to blame them for tarnishing a "sacred institution." Britney, her base­ball cap, and her limo driver escortjust trampled that bit of wishful thinking for good.

Brain sandwiches still on some menus 
EVANSVIU.E, Ind. -Fear of mad cow disease hasn't kept Cecelia Coan from eat­ing her beloved deep-fried cow brain sandwiches. 
She's more concerned about what the cholesterol will do to her heart than suf­fering the brain-wasting dis­ease found in a cow in Washington state. 
"I think I'll have hardening of the arteries before I have mad cow disease," said Cecelia Coan, 40, picking up a brain sandwich to go at the Hilltop Inn during her lunch hour. 
The brains, battered with egg, seasoning and flour, puff up when cooked. They are served hot, heaping outside the bun. 
They are traced back to a time when southern Indiana newcomers from Germany and Holland wasted little. Some families have their own recipes passed down over the generations. 
Streakers watch as their car Is stolen 
SPOKANE, Wash. -Three men who went streaking through a Denny's restaurant were chilled and chagrined when they spotted a thief drive off in their getaway car,. their clothes inside. 
Naked in the 20-degree weather, the three young men huddled behind cars in a parking lot until police arrived. 
The three entered the restaurant before daybreak Wednesday, wearing only shoes and hats. They left their car running so they could make a quick escape. 
But the streakers watched through the windows as a man who had been eating inside the restaurant drove off in their car. 
No charges were brought against the streakers.

The Shirt selection process 
continued this week with final 
design submissions sent to Katie 
Crossin, president of the project. 
The winner will be notifi~d in 
the upcoming weeks, at which 
point he or she will receive a 
$200 award and assist Crossin 
and the rest of The Shirt produc­
tion staff with the project. 
The winner's design will be 
used for the 2004-05 Shirt, ·although there will be some nec­
essary alterations made to 
accommodate moving the design 
from paper to fabric. 
And the color of the 2004-05 
shirt? 
"[That's] the thousand dollar 
question," Crossin said. 
While participants were requested to submit at least one design in the familiar kelly green color, the committee has not definitively chosen that color for the new shirts. 
Eight designers were chosen to be finalists from a first round of submissions turned in Nov. 
26. This preliminary design was very general. left up t'? the cre­ativity of the applicant. Some submissions were just concepts or ideas rather than full designs, Crossin said. 
The competition attracted a variety of individuals from dif­ferent majors, although contest­ants were not asked their majors when applying, and roughly 50 percent of the designs exhibited 
some previous graphic design 
experience, Crossin said. 
This is the 14th year of The 
Shirt tradition at Notre Dame, 
which began as an independent 
student project initiated by 
Brennan Harvath to cover med­
ical costs for a graduate student 
injured in a hit-and-run acci­
dent. The Shirt's purpose was to 
unify students as well as raise 
funds for the unexpected costs. 
The 1990 home opener foot­
ball game versus Michigan fea-. 
tured 85 percent of the student 
body in The Shirt and 9,500 
shirts were sold that season. 
After its first two years of pro­duction, the Hammes Bookstore, along with other campus stores, picked up The Shirt, which con­tributed to increased sales. 
This year's Shirt continues in its tradition with a student-run focus said Crossin, and much of the decision-making is left to students, although The Shirt project is now joined by mem­bers of the Alumni Association, the Student Senate, the Hammes Bookstore and the Financial Management Board. 
Proceeds from shirt sales are divided in two. Half of the money supports student clubs and· organizations, and the other half fulfills the original purpose of covering unforeseen medical costs for students, Crossin said. Within the latter half there is also a "rector fund," which is given to the care of rectors to dispense to students in financial

With The Shirt's continued success, there has been discus­sion about increasing compensa­tion for the selected designer, which is now $200. However, with the history of the project as a social service and the fact that positiuns within the project, including that of the President, are completely voluntary, no decision to increase the prize amount has been made, Crossin said.

Other residents raised con­cerns about students crossing an improved Ivy Road from Turtle Creek to campus, saying that there are currently no crosswalks, and students dart in and out of traffic to cross the road. Marsh said a pedes­trian crossing will be studied. 
"I don't think we're planning on a traffic signal just for pedestrians ... We need to find a way to get a properly desig­nated pedestrian crossover that [students] can't even screw up," Marsh said. 
In the next months, the University will continue to conduct traffic modeling and develop a draft layout of road improvements. Eventually, Notre Dame will bring its plans before the county coun­cil for approval, but Marsh said the University does not have a timeline in which it hopes to close Juniper. 
The University is also study­ing two other changes, in con­junction with county officials:

easily, the matter boils down to principle. Gay rights advocates seek to foster a community where homosexuals are free to be open with their lifestyle. 
But ifsuch changes to the resi­dence contract became neces­sary, the task would fall to General Counsel upon word from the University administra­tion. Associate Vice President and Counsel Jill Bodensteiner said that, if the contract were to be changed, it wouldn't neces­sarily take very long to com­plete. 
"The process [of changing a contract] could take a day or a year depending on its impor­tance," said Bodensteiner. 
Bodensteiner said that, as a private institution, the University is not bound by normal constitu­tional law. The anti-discrimina­tion clause of the University, stated on the graduate policy contract, does not include a sec­tion on sexual orientation or lend itself to gay rights. 
"[As a private institution the University] cuts away on a lot of indirect freedoms," said Cory Irwin, Notre Dame student and member on the Standing Committee for Gay and Lesbian Student Needs. 
Even if the contract loophole remained, gay advocates would have to seek an amendment to the non-discrimination clause which does not apply to homo­sexuals. However, the clause has been challenged before and was last rejected by the Board of Trustees in 1998. 
For Irwin, a change in the near future seems doubtful. 
"We basically haven't been able to move on it. Even now, it would get shot down," said Irwin. "A lot of that also has to do with publicity. Boston [College] is a Catholic school that did it and took a lot of criticism for it, and Notre Dame already has more of a conservative tra­dition than it does." 
Irwin said that a change to the clause would have to be passed through the Board of Fellows, which is required to vote on cer­tain policy changed. The Board consists of three priests and three laymen who already serve on the Board ofTrustees. 
"For anything to pass, you have to have majority vote," said Irwin. 
Gude said that part of the rea­son that the University didn't adopt the sexual orientation sec­tion as part ifits anti-discrimina­tion clause was precisely to avoid getting caught in a situa­tion that would place University policy and the Church position at odds with each other. 
In order for the University to smoothly adopt a sexual orienta­tion section to its anti-discrimi­nation clause it would have to be in response to a change in Church teaching. However, Gude acknowledged that the Church stance on homosexuality remains a controversial issue on which many Catholic academics remain divided. 
"Who knows in the future?" Gude said. "But you can imagine this is going to take sometime; the stance is founded on gospel," 
Gude speculated that the Massachusetts ruling would take about four or five years for the courts to fully work through, and she emphasized that much remains unsettled. 
Indiana is one of 37 states that have laws prohibiting recogni­tion of gay marriage. Of the 13 states without such a law, two are in the Midwest, Wisconsin and Ohio, eight are on the east coast and the remaining three are Wyoming, New Mexico and Oregon.

Acquittal sought for 9/11 suspect HAMBURG, Germany -Lawyers for the second Sept. 11 suspect to go on trial argued Thursday that the Moroccan was unaware of the plot by hijack ringleader Mohamed Atta. 
Abdelghani Mzoudi, charged with more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and membership in a terrorist organization, knew al-Qaida cell members but was not part of the plan to attack the United States, lawyer Guel Pinar told the Hamburg state court during closing arguments. 
"Abdelghani Mzoudi belonged to the group of students around Mohamed Atta. He spent time in Afghanistan. The evidence shows that-but no more than that," Pinar argued. 
Prosecutors last week sought the maximum 15 years in prison for Mzoudi, 31, arguing evidence showed he assisted the Sept. 11 plotters.

Kernan line-item veto questioned 
INDIANAPOLIS-Lawmakers have given an early, bipartisan response to Democratic Gov. Joe Kernan's call for the power of the line-item veto on spending: Forget it. 
After deadlines passed in the Senate and House this week, not a single legislator had flled a joint resolution with language allowing a governor to strike individual items from the budget without killing the entire bill. 
Giving the governor such power would require amending the Indiana Constitution, a process that usually takes at least three years. 


Bush visits Martin Luther King's grave 
Between 700-800 demonstrators protest Bush's appearance at MLK.site 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Looking for election-year support from black voters in the South, President Bush was greet­ed at Martin Luther King's grave here Thursday by noisy demonstrators who chanted "Go home, Bush!" after receiving a warmer reception at a run-down church in New Orleans. 
As Bush placed a wreath on King's crypt, a low cho­rus of boos could be heard from across the street where an estimated 700 to 800 protesters beat drums and waved signs bearing slogans such as "War is not the answer" and "It's not a photo-op, George." 
Bush's four-stop swing through Georgia and Louisiana allowed him to court two important con­stituencies -religious con­servatives, who make up 
· his base of support, and black voters, only 9 percent of whom supported him in 2000. Events in both states were paired with fund-rais­ers, which raised $2.3 mil­lion for his campaign account, already brimming with more than $130 mil­lion. 
In this year's presidential race, Bush probably will garner only slightly more of the black vote, predicts David Bositis, a political analyst in Washington who focuses on black issues. 
''Nine percent is the low­est for a Republican candi­date since Barry Goldwater," he said. ''When you get a zero on a test and you take it a second time, 
·the odds are that you're going to do a little better." 
The president, standing silently, his head slightly bowed, appeared unfazed by the protesters at King's tomb, where he laid a wreath of red, white and blue flowers to mark what would have been the civil rights leader's 75th birth­day. 
King Center officials said they extended no formal invitation to Bush but accepted his offer to come.

licly at the grave, but earli­
er at the black church in 
Louisiana, Bush said King understood that "faith is power greater than all oth­ers," and that it was impor­tant for America to "honor his life and what he stood for." 
Bush was at Union Bethel 
A.M.E. Church, in a high-crime area of downtown New Orleans, to push his faith-based initiative. He typically uses black church­es for faith-based events, but Bositis of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a think tank in Washington said Thursday's events were tai­lored to winning white vot­ers too. 
"They're aimed at white Christian conservative sup­porters," he said. "Appearing in black churches makes him look like he's doing all these things for black people. It makes him look less con­servative, and that's a potential plus for white, suburban swing voters." 
At the church, where pews are broken and the sky can be seen through holes in stained glass win­dow panes, Bush announced that the Justice Department has finalized just such regulations affect­ing $3.7 billion in funding, primarily for programs that help crime victims, prevent child victimization and pro­mote safe schools. 
"That's why I'm here ­to get involved with the faith-pased initiative," said David Shelton Jr., minister from a poor church nearby that has fed 400,000 peo­ple the past 17 years. 



Rover rolls onto planet's surface 
Associated Press 
PASADENA, Calif. -To the great relief of NASA scientists, the Spirit rover rolled onto the surface of Mars and trundled across the salmon-colored soil Thursday for the first time since the vehicle bounced to a landing nearly two weeks ago. 
The slow maneuver was a nail-bit­ing moment for scientists who had feared that Spirit might become yet another casualty in the star-crossed history of Mars exploration. 
"This is a big relief," said Rob Manning, manager of the entry, descent and landing portion of the 
mission. "Our wheels are finally dirty." . 
The six-wheeled vehicle had been perched atop its lander since its arrival on Mars on Jan. 3. On Thursday, it finally rolled down a ramp onto the surface of the Red Planet, covering a mere 10 feet, as planned. The trip took 78 seconds. 
Engineers had worried that the golf-cart-size vehicle might become snagged on its ramp or damaged beyond repair, ma~ing it impossible to complete its mission. Scientists said the roll-off may have been the riskiest step the rover would ever take on Mars. 
NASA engineers and scientists 
were misty-eyed and choked-up as they described the success of the maneuver, and raised a champagne toast at an early morning news con­ference. 
"Mars now is our sandbox, and we are ready to play and learn" said Charles Elachi, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
Spirit is to spend three to four days parked beside its lander, giving it time to find its bearings and per­form some preliminary analysis of the soil and pebbles around it. Then it will set ofT a meandering journey to prospect for geologic evidence that the now-dry planet was once wetter and hospitable to life.

Panel nixes reducing radioactive testing 
WASHINGTON-The Energy Department has not done the necessary tests to justify relaxing the testing of radioactive waste shipments bound for a New Mexico storage site, a panel of scientists said Thursday. 
The department has argued that safety checks required on shipments to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, N.M., cost $3.1 billion and create delays. Changing the require­ments would save time and money, the department said in petitioning for changes last week. 
A report by a panel of scien­tists appointed by the National Research Council -a division of the National Academies of Science -said Energy has not done adequate studies to support its argument for easing regulations

during nuclear weapons making -in ancient salt beds 2,150 feet below ground. 
Under the Energy Department's proposed changes, instead of testing each shipment of waste, records kept ort each drum of radiop.ctive material would be used to determine whether the waste inside is eligi­ble to be buried at the site. 
There is no deadline for the state to act on the Energy Department application. 
Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., who objected to the Domenici provision, said the scientists' report shows that Congress should only pre-empt state regu­latory authority "after a trans­parent process has taken place -a process that yields thought­ful and careful analysis." · 
The law cannot 
be undone, 
and· signed into law last month by President Bush orders the Energy Department to request that New Mexico relax its testing requirements and restricts the state's ability to refuse the request. 
"This is another example of the management failures coming from the highest levels of DOE," said New Mexico Environment Secretary Ron Curry. "It is another example of DOE putting the cart before the horse and making unfounded assumptions to the detriment of New Mexicans." 
The Carlsbad facility buries transuranic waste -such as gloves, rags, tools, dried sludge and other debris contaminated Domenici defend­
ed the provision. "Experience has shown us that intrusive sampling techniques have shown to have little envi­ronmental, public safety or health benefits," he said. 
The National Research Council panel said that when the Carlsbad plant became the first operational waste facility of its kind four years ago, it made sense for regulators to be cau­tious and impose rigorous meas­ures for screening waste. 
Today, the site's track record could help identify changes that could be warranted. However, a systematic analysis is needed before the Energy Department can make its case that changes are justified, the panel said. 


King's legacy discussed 
By MATT SMEDBERG 
News Wmer 

Students, faculty and staff met in the Coleman-Morse Center lounge Thursday night for a "town hall meeting" as part of the celebration of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. discussing issues of campus diversity, respect and other topics related to King's legacy. 
The event drew a large audience who did not hesitate to voice their ideas -and their frustration at the ways they see the Notre Dame envi­ronment stifling real diversity. 
The event's moderators, professor Carolyn Nordstrom of the anthropology depart­ment, and J. Roberto Gutierrez, University vice president for communication, asked the assembled students open-ended questions which had been put together by the event's four student organiz­ers. The questions were framed in terms of King's life and legacy. but student answers dealt with the histor­ical aspect only in passing, preferring to cut straight to their ideas on the state of the campus. 
Students voiced concerns that ethnic groups are sequestered into their own areas of campus life, rather than being seen as participat­ing in all that Notre Dame has to offer. White students men­tioned being apprehensive that they would be seen as patronizing if they tried to mingle with minorities. 

Elena Lacayo, a sophomore from Howard Hall, described her experiences coming from her homeland of Nicaragua to Notre Dame. 
"I found that there are rules, unspoken rules, that make it very difficult to deal with someone from another culture, someone who is dif­ferent ... I think I break the rules a lot without even know­ing it, because I grew up in a different culture," Lacayo said.

Small cigarette companies sue La. 
Three small cigarette makers filed a lawsuit Monday accusing Louisiana of enacting legisla­tion aimed at preserving Big Tobacco's market share and artificially propping up the major pro­ducers' settlement payments to the states. 
Plaintiffs said the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in New Orleans, asked the court to declare Louisiana law unconstitutional. Lawyers for those filing the suit said 18 other states, includ­ing Indiana, have similar laws. 
The National Association of Attorneys General says such laws closed a loophole that gave upstart cigarette companies a price advantage over companies that signed a settlement with 46 states in 1998 and agreed to pay more than $200 billion over 25 years to resolve state claims for reimbursement for the costs of treating sick smokers. 
Toyota car able to park itself 
TOKYO -Your hands don't even need to be touching the steering wheel for it to start spin­ning back and forth aggressively, all by itself ­slowly guiding the car into the parking spot. 
Parallel parking is designed to be a breeze with the Intelligent Parking Assist system, part of a new $2,200 option package for Toyota Motor Corp.'s Prius gas-electric hybrid in Japan. 
This is a bold and somewhat unnerving con­cept, a car that parks itself. As a driver, you've got to wonder as the Prius eases back toward the curb: What is this machine thinking? 
It's also difficult not to be gripped by a "Look Ma, no hands" thrill -even if the system only partially fulfills its promise.

Yahoo making big comeback 
Company beats MSN and A1nerican Online as number one Internet destination

SAN FRANCISCO They're cheering again at Yahoo! Inc. 
The dot-com bellwether has recovered $21 billion in shareholder wealth by astutely anticipating the habits of Web surfers -so much so, in fact, that it now outranks MSN and America Online as the Internet's top destination. 
After a mortifying two­year slump, the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company made a $238. million profit in 2003, impressing disillusioned investors who had written off Yahoo· as another Internet has-been.

Kroger employees sue for family leave 
.Three Indiana women file class-action suit 
Associated Press 

CINCINNATI -Three Kroger workers in Indiana have filed a class-action lawsuit accusing the grocer of violating the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
Kroger placed the employees in jobs with reduced health care cov­erage when they returned in 2002 from leaves protected by the law, or forced them to pay their own health care bills for the time they missed, said Ann Lugbill, a Cincinnati attor­ney who represents the workers. 
"The more we dug into it, the more it became apparent this is a systemic problem," Lugbill said Wednesday. 
The lawsuit was filed Monday in 
U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, where Kroger is based. 
"For two months, we've tried to work with top management and legal counsel at Kroger to avoid a lawsuit," Lugbill said. "But all we've seen is foot-dragging and threats against us if we file such a lawsuit. That left us with few other options." 
Kroger spokesman Jeff Golc said it is the company's policy not to comment on pending litigation. 
The plaintiffs -Jacqueline Buckley of Crawfordsville, Jane Carrington of Indianapolis and Karla Quillen of Danville -are members of United Food & Commercial Workers Union Local 
700. The union represents nearly 4,000 Kroger workers in central Indiana.· 
Thousands of Kroger employees nationwide could join the lawsuit if they have had similar experiences upon returning to work after an FMLA leave in the past three years, Lugbill said. 
The lawsuit is not part of contract disputes between Kroger and union workers that triggered strikes in several states last fall.

Halliburton has denied doing anything wrong and called crit­icism of its actions unfair and politically motivated. 
The Defense Contract Audit Agency on Tuesday asked the Pentagon's inspector general to investigate a "suspected irregu­larity" involving the Halliburton 'contract to provide gasoline to civilians in Iraq. Auditors had said last month that Halliburton and its Kuwaiti fuel supplier, the Altanmia Marketing Co., may have overcharged the Army by $61 million between May and

September. 
The referral to the inspector general indicates the auditors suspect illegal activity. The investigation will center on actions by government work­ers, not the company. a senior defense official said Thursday on condition of anonymity. 
The Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees the contract, has backed Halliburton. Corps officials I<ist month ruled that Halliburton subsidiary KBR didn't have to justify the price it was paying Altanmia for fuel. 
The latest document to sur­face is a Corps of Engineers memo to DCAA last week called a "business case" justifying the fuel costs. Halliburton charged the Army more than double the cost for fuel it trucked into Iraq from Kuwait than for fuel it bought in Turkey. 
Halliburton has claimed that Altanmia was the only compa­ny approved by the Kuwaiti government to sell fuel in Iraq. 
But the Corps of Engineers document doesn't say that. It says Altanmia had to get Kuwaiti government approval for its sales to Halliburton because it had never sold fuel before. The Army document does not mention any demand by Kuwait that only Altanmia could be used as a supplier. 
Halliburton got a contract to repair Iraq's crumbling oil industry as part of its contract to provide emergency construc­tion and other services to the Army. On May 4, military com­manders in Iraq told Halliburton to start supplying gasoline in Iraq because crowds in long lines at gas sta­tions were becoming unruly.

Howard, whom Pero described as a crack abuser, had crack, a gun and $1,200 in the car when he was arrested, authorities said. Police said he confessed to using the gun to shoot both brothers after Jamar Hooper accused him of stealing the drug.

Police said Howard told them he argued with Jamar Hooper on the top floor of Hooper's home and shot him during a fight. As Howard was coming down the stairs he realized Ondrea Hooper was downstairs and shot him, police said. 
Police said Howard was sus­pected in the shootings of Moyer and Knight, but had not been charged. 
Autopsies showed all the vic­tims were shot in the head. Moyer and Knight were also shot in the chest and neck. 
Moyer and her daughter were last seen alive on Monday, and investigators believe they may 
have been killed that day. Two friends of the daughter found the bodies Wednesday when they stopped by the home worried because the girl hadn't been in class, Pero said. 
Howard was being held at the 

Allegheny County Jail. It was 
unclear whether he had an attor­
ney. 
Phillisa Hooper said her sons 

had been friends with Howard. 
"My boys, they were always together. They were always around each other, just like-they were that day," said Hooper, who was making plans Thursday for their funerals.

QUOTE OF THE DAY 
..In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on." 
Robert Frost poet 





How ''Saved by the Bell" prepared me for life 

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Exchange what? 
A couple of days ago, two friends and I. swaddled in the folds of Brobdingnagian jackets. slid onto the sidewalks of South Bend. My friend wanted nothing more than to convert some hundred-odd pounds sterling into its pea-colored American equivalent. Braving Boreas huffing and puffing against us, we walked from Washington to Colfax, across Michigan to Main, etching rectangular paths throughout the city's streets. What we discov­ered was that South Bend's finan­cial district is the soul of the city. For a lovely overhead view of South Bend, visit Key Bank. For a wide array of travel magazines to pore over while the wind whips and whirls out­side, pop into the TCU. Need to see some green fronds after the monotony of snow? First Source has plants. But should you ever need to exchange curren­cy, should you by some fluke of fate 
come from a distant, little-known kingdom called England, or for that matter, come from anywhere but here, you'd best get thee to Chicago before the bell tolls five on Friday. Not even the Notre Dame Federal Credit Union performs this feat of metamorphosing pounds into . dollars. No, in matters of Midas, no bank can change shining sterling to gleaming green. (Or they will do it, but it will cost $17-25 U.S. dollars for the exchange and lo get the money can take up to 10 days.) I inquire of a University begun by· Frenchmen, adopted by Irish, offering the Keough and the Kellogg, boasting the instruc­tion of Chinese, Arabic, and many oth­ers, why it can't get its 
hands on the money.

EDITORIAL CARTOON 
Like so many others of our generation, I would rush home from middle school every day to settle into the couch cushion and watch perhaps one of the most influential television shows of my childhood: "Saved by the 
Bell." Bill Rlnner 
Despite its dearth of realism, its cookie-cutter character stereotypes and its overwhelm­A Voice of 
ing corniness, "Saved by the Reason Bell" nevertheless provided wisdom that I still carry today. For the small handful of you who never watched the show during your adolescent heyday, it featured six high school students, led by the ineffably cool Zack Morris, who planned their schemes in the principal's office at.Bayside High, ate lunch at The Max every day and learned every harsh lesson to emerge as better people and closer friends at the end of each 30-minute installment. 
Parents and critics alike panned the show as an unrealistic portrayal of high school life, and they were largely vindicated when we realized that the lines between the jocks, nerds, feminists and cheerleaders were more blurred than "Saved by the Bell's" depic­tion. I felt particularly disappointed when my high school experience did not include a dance contest ref­ereed by Casey Kasem, but my enlightenment would 
J come in due time. Now that we have grown up since the awkward and ignorant years ofjunior and senior high school, we can evaluate the show to recognize the positive effects lurking amidst its flaws. I'll start by referencing an old classic, one that for­ever lingers in the memory for those fortunate enough to have viewed it. Entitled "Jessie's Song," the episode features the overachieving Jessie Spano, who later drops out of Stansbury University to pursue a career as a stripper, in the midst of a nervous breakdown only amplified by her addiction to caffeine pills. I'm willing to wager that every student familiar with the episode recalls the horrendous image of Jessie screaming 'Tm so excited! I'm so ... scared!" when they contemplate taking a No-Doz pill during finals 
week. 

Not only did the episode offer a sentimental lesson on the nature of drug addiction, but the group's inter­vention after A.C. Slater discovers her secret proves that a friend in need is a friend indeed, and Jessie ultimately recovers from her traumatic experience. 
When not facing internal adversity, the group's con­frontations with societal injustice opened a young gen­eration's eyes to problems ranging from sexism to the destruction of the environment. 
Who can watch the tragic moment when Zack's pet duck Becky dies from an oil spill and not be enraged at the greed and utter inhumanity of oil compa­nies with virtually no regard for the environment? Fortunately, the group overcomes the plot of an evil corporation and all other bounds of simple rationality to thwart the attempt to turn Bayside High into a giant oil rig at the expense of a duck pond. 
Protecting the environment from evildoers was only the beginning of the group's inspira­tional movement for social jus­tice. When the new girl Kristi tries out for the wrestling team, she faces the institutionalized sex­ism inherent in the athletic world where females are not encouraged to utilize their physical talents. Her ardent supporters intervene, and she receives her chance to prove her ability on the wrestling mat, shocking the after-school tel­evision world with the stunning pin of a rival wrestler. 
The episode proved a worthy allegory for the real­
,' ·life introduction of Title IX, which has benefited countless college students who can look no further than the gym of Bayside High for internal justification of the controversial provision. 
None can forget Zack's encounters with his friendly nemesis, Mr. Belding, the bumbling principal. 
Remembering their rivalry and Zack's string of moral victories against repression, a generation developed the courage and confidence required to question high­er authorities. Notre Dame students, in particular, could benefit from a crash-course review of Zack's antics, lest we forget that authority is not so much a permanent obstacle as a temporary inconvenience to our goals. 
Finally, as we prepare ourselves to venture out into the business world, the lessons about the glories and pitfalls of capitalism that ''Saved by the Bell" presents are more relevant now than ever before. One needn't major in business to learn basic marketing skills. Look no fur­ther than the episode "Model 
Students," when Zack and compa­ny rejuvenate the failing student store by selling a women's swim 
team calendar. As they discover, sex sells. Despite the moral or ethical downside to objectifying the body, we live in a beauty­oriented world where looks can be crucial to success. 
"Saved by the Bell" offered a 
dose of idealism to an otherwise apathetic generation. proving that even nerdy students have their day 
and jocks can ultimately attain the elusive yet attractive feminist. We lucky few who witnessed its brilliance should never regret the valuable time spent on the couch after school when we should have been doing our homework.

'Eye.' on the Snite this weekend 


By MARIA SMITH Scene Editor 

"My Eye:_," an exhibition of paintings by award-winning artist Rick Bartow, will open this Sunday at the Snite Museum of Art. Bartow, who is Yurok in origin, draws on._ his. Native American ancestry in his paintings, which explore mythological themes from all over the world. Originally from northern California, Bartow now lives and works on the coast of Oregon. 
Bartow is currently on a two-year national tour, funded by an endowment from The Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde and by the Oregon Arts Commission, the National Endowment for the Arts and the Oregon Council for the Humanities. An exhibition guide with an introduction by Oregon writer Harry Lopez, an extensive biography of the artist and a critical essay by curator Rebecca Dobkins will accompany the exhibition. 
"Premeditated: Meditations on Capital Punishment" 

opened last Sunday. Artist Malaquias Montoya, a leading figure in the political Chicano movement on the west coast, conceived the protest during the 2000 presidential election after the focus on George Bush's home state of Texas brought greater media atten­tion to the issu~ of the death penalty in the United States. He uses his imagery to protest a practice that he considers an atrocity. 
"We have perfected the art of institutional killing to the degree that it has deadened our national, quintessentially human response to death," the Snite Museum Web site quoted the artist as saying. "I want to produce a body of wo...rk depicting the horror of this act.." 
"Premeditated: Meditations on Capital Punishment" will run through Feb. 22. "My Eye" will run from Jan. 18 to March 
14. Both exhibitions are free and open to the public.

With a leprechaun as the mascot, Irish as the team name, bagpipes on football mornings and a fair share of students with red hair, freckles and last names prefaced by "0" and "Me," Notre Dame can pretty much claim itself the hub of Irish Americans in the United States. So, with the new live music bar Legends on campus, it is only natural that in a place where

Wilkens joins Knicks, replacing Chaney as head coach 

Associated Press 
GREENBURGH, N.Y. Lenny Wilkens was wrapping up his introductory news con­ference Thursday when a grin­ning Stephon Marbury strode over to the dais. 
"Here comes another Brooklyn guy," the New York Knicks' new coach said before receiving a big hug from the team's point guard. 
Marbury delivered the warmest embrace to Wilkens as the Knicks welcomed aboard another of the best playmakers ever to come out of New York. First, new team president Isiah Thomas traded for an All-Star (Marbury). then he hired a Hall of Farner (Wilkens).

NOTRE DAME VOCATION INITIATIVE 
Wilkens ran a brief practice 

in the afternoon, preparing the 
revamped Knicks to play the 
Seattle SuperSonics on Friday 
night. He replaces Don 
Chaney, fired Wednesday. 
"The opportunity to come 

back to New York is just 
tremendous. It's not anything 
that I thought could happen." 
said Wilkens, who had been 
out of work since being fired 
by the Toronto Raptors at the 
end of last season. 
The Knicks are the sixth 

team coached by the 66-year­
old Wilkens, who has made the 
playoffs in 19 of his 30 seasons 
on the bench. His challenge in 
New York will be to guide the 
Knicks (16-24) back to the 
postseason after a two-year 
absence. 
New York is 2 112 games 

behind Philadelphia for eighth 
place in the Eastern 
Conference. 
"We've got our work cut out 

for us, but I'm an optimist," 
Wilkens said. "It's still early 
enough. We can make the 
playoffs." 
He plans to prod the Knicks 

to refocus on defense and 
hopes to tweak their offense ­
all while growing accustomed 
to a roster that, until 
Thursday, he had only seen a 
handful of times on television. 
Wilkens .said he welcomes 
input from Thomas, who drew 
up a wish list of coaching can­
didates before settling on the 
gray-haired gentleman from 
the Class of '56 at Boys High 
School in Brooklyn. 
"I feel like it's my team right 
now -or I should say 
Stephon's team," Wilkens said. 
Wilkens, owner of the most coaching victories and losses in NBA history, will have to make adjustments on the fly. The Knicks enter a stretch of six games in nine days that includes a matinee matchup with the Raptors on Monday. 
Several Toronto players criti­cized Wilkens' coaching meth­ods after he was fired in April. Vince Carter said Wilkens doesn't understand today's game. 
Wilkens said he was sur­pri.sed by Carter's comments and defended his tenure in Toronto, citing the team's numerous injuries during his three seasons there. 
"I don't pay it any mind because many players will say things to distract from them­selves," Wilkens said. 
After· being fired, Wilkens spent time at home in Seattle playing golf and tennis. 
"I never gave much thought to whether my coaching days were over or not. When I left I said I still had a lot of coach­ing left in me," Wilkens said. "When the season started, I started missing it. And I start­ed to watch a lot of games. And when this opportunity came, I jumped at it."

NFL 

Delhomme brings spirit, enthusiasm to Panthers 
Associated Press 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -Jake Delhomme sprinted onto the football field and into the hud­dle, words of encouragement tumbling out of his mouth faster than his teammates could com­prehend. 
The Carolina Panthers trailed 17-0 in their season opener and Delhomme was sent in to turn it around. 
He did. That day he rallied the Panthers to the biggest come­back in franchise history and has continued to do so, bringing them within one win of a trip to the Super Bowl. 
"To me, this game is no differ­ent than the first game of the season," Delhomme said. "The goals are still the same: Play your best and win." 
No one knew what to expect from Delhomme when he relieved Rodney Peete in the second half of the Sept. 7 season opener. He failed to unseat Peete for the starting job in training camp, but Peete played so poorly that day against Jacksonville there was no way the Panthers could leave him in. 
So they sent in Delhomme, then crossed their fingers and hoped he'd be able to pump some life into the offense. ­
"He came running in as if it was 0-0 and we had a shot," receiver Steve Smith said. "He was screaming and yelling and telling us we were going to win. He really came in with some fire." 
It was the chance the feisty Cajun from Louisiana had been waiting for his entire life. 
He'd spent five years as a backup for his homestate New Orleans Saints with no chance to unseat Aaron Brooks for the starting job. Although he loved being close to his home and family, Delhomme knew he needed to leave if he was ever going to play in the NFL. 
He was courted by Carolina and Dallas, and picked the Panthers hoping he'd be start­ing by opening day. 
Although it didn't happen the way he planned, his big chance was in front of him and there was no way Delhomme was going to blow it. 
"I just told myself' Don't try to win it all at once. This is what you've wanted to do all your life,"' Delhomme recalled. 
The Panthers fed off of his enthusiasm as Delhomme threw three touchdown passes -the final with 16 seconds to play ­to rally them to a 24-23 victory over the Jaguars. 
"It was like with the snap of a finger, everything changed,"

fullback Brad Hoover said. "It was weird. There needed to be a change and he comes in jok­ing, saying, 'Don't worry. We're going to do it.' Then, Bam! Bam! Bam!" 
It's been Bam, Bam, Bam ever since. 
Delhomme has led Carolina to eight victories this season by engineering the game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter or in overtime. 
His most recent heroics came last week in St. Louis, when he threw a 69-yard touchdown pass to Smith on the first play of double overtime to beat the Rams and put the Panthers into the NFC championships. 
Delhomme is far from the next Joe Montana, John Elway or Dan Marino. 
But his ability to stay calm in the waning moments of a tight game have earned the 29-year­old some comparisons to the great fourth-quarter comeback quarterbacks. 
So how does a guy in his first season as a starter not panic with the game -and now the season-on the line? 
"In those situations where we do have to come back, I just tell myself, 'OK, don't try to do something you can't, don't try to be anybody you're not, don't try to take something that's not there,'" Delhomme said. "The main thing for me is to get the ball into the hands of our play­makers. I know if I get too riled up, if I try to do too much, then I will only hurt the team.'' 
That's a lesson Delhomme learned the hard way with the Saints. 
Given an opportunity to prove himself in 1999, Delhomme couldn't eat or sleep before the preseason game. It was between Delhomme and Danny Wuerffel for the starting job and Delhomme flopped when he got out onto the field. 
. "I had to play well and then some, probably, to win that job," Delhomme said. "I put a lot of pressure on myself and came in and stunk it up. I hated the feel­ing that I had, feeling like, 'Oh, you've got to make a play.' 
"From that point on I swore that I would never, ever do that again." 
Instead, Delhomme hits the field like an eager kid who just got his first pair of shoulder pads. He's passionate and eager and excited, but determined not to make the same mistakes twice. 
But it's the intangibles -the lift he gives the offense, the spark he brings to the entire team-that make him invalu­able. 


Lopienski contributes for Colts 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Colts full­back Tom Lopienski waited all season to touch the football and tight end Joe Dean Davenport went seven games without having a pass thrown his direction. 
Both delivered when given the chance. 
With players like Lopienski and Davenport, Brandon Stokley and Reggie Wayne now on Peyton Manning's radar, opponents look almost defense­less against an Indianapolis offense that finds new contrib­utors every week. 
"They have weapons all over the place," Patriots cornerback Ty Law said. "They have the big three, Brandon and Reggie are stepping up. You have to go out and play good, sound team defense to stop them." 
The 15-2 Patriots' biggest challenge of the season could come Sunday when the Colts bring the league's hottest offense to chilly Foxboro, Mass. 
Indianapolis (14-4) scored 79 points in its first two playoff games, has yet to punt and seems to be improving as the stakes increase. 
Manning, the league's co­MVP, has a near perfect passer rating of 156.9 after throwing eight touchdowns and no inter­ceptions in a 41-10 victory over Denver and a 38-31 win at Kansas City. Five-time Pro Bowl receiver Marvin Harrison has 13 catches for 231 yards and two touchdowns, while Edgerrin James has rushed for 203 yards and two TDs. 
The other part of the equa­tion is the Colts' supporting cast. 
Stokley has become a big­play threat in the playoffs with eight catches for 201 yards and three touchdowns, including an 87-yarder -the longest pass play in the franchise's postsea­son history. Wayne also has emerged as a primary threat with 11 catches and two touch­downs the last two weeks. Even little-used players like Lopienski, an undrafted rookie, and Davenport, a blocking tight end, are making an impact. 
Lopienski's first touch of the season came on a 2-yard touchdown reception at Kansas City, and Lopienski and Davenport each had as many catches as James last week ­one. That's by design. 
"In this offense, you just have to stay with it," Manning said. "Joe Dean? Now there's a trend-breaker right there. Tom Lopienski, there you go.'' 
The offensive mastermind is Tom Moore, a man who has run some of the best offenses in league history, including those of the high-scoring Detroit Lions teams that featured Barry Sanders and Herman Moore. 
In Indianapolis, Moore has made some adjustments, such as using double-tight end for­mations, but has continued to rely primarily on one-back sets. 
With all the options -a quarterback adept at reading defenses and changing calls, a receiver defenders must focus on stopping and a power run­ning back -Moore has tested defenses by putting more stress on them. 
The Colts don't hesitate to send tight end Marcus Pollard deep over the middle, and Wayne and Stokley can be used short or deep. And just when defenses think they've figured it out, Manning crosses them up by going to Davenport or Lopienski. 
"Marvin sets the tempo for us in the passing game. We see how people are playing him and how they're going to try and take him a way," coach Tony Dungy said. "Then it's a matter of everyone being ready. In our offense, you have to be able to produce when your number is called." 
For these Colts, that call could come at almost any moment -given their injury history. 
Harrison, who hurt his ribs last week, had already missed one game this season with a strained hamstring. 
James sat out three games after breaking two bones in his lower back and rookie tight end Dallas Clark missed the last 6 1/2 games with a broken right leg. 
Now Stokley, who was signed to be the team's No. 3 receiver but didn't get healthy until December, may not play Sunday because his infant son was hospitalized. 

Yet the Colts have continued to win because of The Unknowns -players such as Troy Walters, who had a career-high 36 receptions and 456 yards before breaking his nose and then being dropped to No. 4 after Stokley's emer­gence. 
"Everybody's making plays, everybody's reading it when it's called," Walters said. "Stokley's made several big plays, Reggie and Joe Dean, every one has made a play." 
The Colts are hopeful that Clark, who was not placed on injured reserve, may be healthy enough to play in the Super Bowl, if they make it.

Marino becomes Dolphins' VP of football operations 
~sociated Press 
MIAMI -He spent 17 years running the huddle for the Dolphins. Now, he'll run their front office, which means enduring fickle fans, carping columnists, endless 
 hours of game film a n d December trips to Buffalo. Why would Dan Marino want that? 
The office, desk and other trappings that come with joining the mun­dane 9-to-5 world will all be new to Marino, now that he has become Miami's senior vice president of football oper­ations. 


The job title may be long, but it lacks the luster of the posi­tion he played so well. The best, most popular player in Dolphins history, Marino puts his reputation on the line by taking charge of a team that won its most recent Super Bowl title 30 years ago. 
'Tve had people say to me, 'Why take this risk?"' he admits. 
His answer: While working the past four years as a net­work TV analyst, Marino missed the Dolphins. ·He missed chasing the NFL title he never won. He especially missed the rush of adrenaline that comes with having a stake So Marino will give up his make the final decision on per­in the outcome of every game. three-days-a-week, $2 million­sonnel.

"I wouldn't have taken the job just to make it look good," Marino says. "It's not a PR position.... I think Wayne is 
-looking for another set of eyes that played the game for 17 years that can look at it from a different perspective." A handful of standout NFL players have moved to the front office, with results rang­ing from first rate (Ozzie Newsome in Baltimore) to last place (Matt Millen in Detroit). "It's very difficult to go straight from the field without any experience in that role," former Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson says. "But there are enough quality people within the organization that Dan will have time to learn in the job, and I'm sure he'll do a great job." Marino's judgment could prove particularly beneficial regarding the passing game that has been Miami's weakest area since he retired. The receiving corps and offensive line need to be upgraded, and the Dolphins must decide whether to stay with inconsis­tent, injury-prone Jay Fiedler at quarterback. The presence of Marino also means another year of shaky job security for Wannstedt, who narrowly avoided being fired after this past season. He became coach in January 2000 and is widely perceived to have nudged Marino into retirement two months later. At the news conference Monday where Marino was introduced as the new boss, Wannstedt stood off to one side, back literally against the wall, wearing an expression he usually reserves for losses to the New York Jets. He and Marino claim there's no strain in their relationship. "Dave told me [in 2000] if I wanted an opportunity to come back, I could," Marino said. "But it didn't feel right. It was time for me." He retired reluctantly, and now the master of the fourth­quarter rally has staged anoth­er comeback. An hour after his hiring was announced, there were 40 congratulatory mes­sages on his cell phone, reflecting a good vibe that's sure to last awhile. The Dolphins are Marino's team again, and they'll remain undefeated until at least September.

Associated Press 

AL Cy Young Award winner Roy Halladay, 2001 NL Rookie of the Year Albert Pujols and New York Yankees second baseman Alfonso Soriano were among 65 players who filed for salary arbi­tration Thursday, the fewest to submit their names since 1999. 
Houston pitchers Wade Miller, Roy Oswalt and Octavia Dotel also filed, as did Chicago Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood. Anaheim pitcher Jarrod Washburn and Florida pitchers Brad Penny and Carl Pavano. 
Two free-agent pitchers who accepted arbitration offers from their former teams also were in the group: Philadelphia's Kevin Millwood and the New York Yankees' Gabe White. 
Clubs have made an effort in recent years to force deals with non-star players well before mid­January, threatening not to offer them contracts unless they settled before filing. 
Seventy-two players filed last year, down from 90 in 2002 and 102 in 2001. Just 62 filed in 1999. 
Many of those who filed are expected to settle by Tuesday when players and teams exchange proposed salaries -just 34 players swapped figures with their teams last year. For those who don't settle, hearings before three-arbitrator panels will be scheduled during the first three weeks of February. 
Just seven cases went to hearings last year, with owners winning five and increasing their record to 259-194 since arbitration began in 197 4. 
Players have not won a majority of a year's hear­ings since 1996, but own­ers complain about arbi­tration because of the huge raises many players receive in the process, which is largely limited to those with at least three but less than six years of major league service. 
Three players who had been eligible agreed to contracts Thursday, with San Diego right-hander Adam Eaton getting a $5.25 million, two-year deal, Cubs closer Joe Borowski receiving a $4.3 million, two-year agree­ment and Seattle catcher Ben Davis getting a $1.4 million, one-year deal. 
Philadelphia shortstop Jimmy Rollins settled shortly after filing, agree­ing to a $2.4 million. one­year contract. 
IN BRIEF 

MLB hopes to find home for the Expos 
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -Major league baseball hopes to pick the future home of the Montreal Expos by the All-Star break, vowing to make a decision this season follow­ing two years of missed deadlines. 
The Expos were bought by the other 29 teams before the 2002 sea­son, and the commissioner's office originally hoped to relocate the team by 2003. 
Following a two-day owners meet­ing, Expos president Tony Tavares said baseball's goal was to "hopefully have a decision by the All-Star game." 
Commissioner Bud Selig expressed confidence the Expos would be relo­cated by the start of the 2005 season. He said remaining in Montreal was not an option. 
"They've had a hard time finding local ownership once Charles Bronfman left in 1989. It's been a terrible struggle up there," Selig said. "I'd like to get the club sold. It would be one less thing for us and for me." 
Baseball officials have spoken about the Expos with groups from Las Vegas; Monterrey, Mexico; Norfolk, Va.; Northern Virginia; Portland, Ore.; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Washington, D.C. Last year, owners told the groups they wanted funding for a new ballpark in place before making a decision. It was unclear if baseball still holds to that. 
"Whoever gets the team is going to have a ballpark situation struc­tured." Selig said. Wie two over at SonyOpen 
HONOLULU-Michelle Wie hardly looked out of place Thursday at the Sony Open. Give her time, and the 14-year-old might prove she belongs on the PGA Tour. 
Michelle Wie just missed on a few long birdie putts Thursday. 
Wie, believed to be the youngest player ever on the PGA Tour, made three birdies in a respectable round of 2-over 7 2 that left her nine strokes behind early leader Carlos Franco and in need of her best round to make the cut. 
Still, the ninth-grader from Punahou made quite an impression. 
"She hits it long enough to play any golf course," said Craig Bowden, her playing partner who posted a 70. "I looked at her today as another player." 
"We don't have a lot in common," Bowden said. "I asked her when she was going to get her driver's license." 
They were different in other areas. too. 
Wie twice hit drives longer than 300 yards, and routinely knocked it some 20 yards beyond Bowden. Her only weakness was her irons. Despite length that would fit right in among the men. she rarely gave herself good birdie chances.

ND TRACK AND FIELD 
Irish travel for indoor opener 
Special to The Observer 
Notre Dame's men's and women's track and field teams will begin the indoor portion of their 2004 schedule this weekend at the Central Michigan Opener in Mt. Pleasant, Mich., today at 5:30p.m. 
After this weekend's opener, the Irish will return to the Loftus Sports Center for three consecu­tive weekends of home meets. Notre Dame will take on Western Michigan and Ball State in a tri­angular meet on Jan. 23, fol­lowed by a quad meet with DePaul, Marquette and Michigan State on Jan. 30. The Meyo Invitational follows on Feb. 6 and 7.

looked at his mm. they knew they wanted him to have the ball in his hands." 
Nate Lyles, a hard-hitting, 6-foot, 185 pound corner­back, and cornerback Junior Jabbie (5-foot-11, 175 pounds), a late prep-school find out of Parlin, N.J., are two other defensive backfield prospects. Lyles would most likely play safety due to his style of play, and, according to Frank, Jabbie is now talk­ing about switching his inten­tions to playing running back. 
Lyles is one of Notre Dame's initial offers from the begin­ning of the recruiting process. Also making visits are offen­sive guard Jaimie Thomas, running back Samson Taylor and linebackers Maurice Crum, Ronnie Palmer and Justin Brown. 
Thomas, a 6-foot-4, 320 pound guard from Bishop McDevitt High School in Harrisburg, Penn., has visited Maryland and Tennessee already. 
Notre Dame has already 
offered Crum a scholars-hip, although the Florida native is still deciding between the Irish, Michigan St~te and Tennessee. 
Frank thinks the weather in South Bend could be a factor in possibly shying away the 6­foot, 214 pounder. 
"Crum is looking forward to visiting," Frank said. "But with a Florida kid, it's always hard to know how they'll accept the environment." 
Palmer is a middle line­backer out of Houston who Frank believes will be a chal­lenge to lure. 
"He just visited Arizona and came away very impressed," Frank said. "Notre Dame has to really impress him, [because] he's the type of guy you want on your team. He's a middle linebacker with good size and good speed." The final visitor, 6-4, 215 pound linebacker Justin Brown could have potential at linebacker or defensive end. His size reminds Frank of Justin Tuck as an incoming freshman.

Belles look to regain form against Alma 
By STEVE COYER 
Sports Writer 
A tough stretch of games over the winter has hurt the Belles' overall record, but the team looks to rebound Saturday against Alma College. 
The Belles (4-10) have lost their last five games and are 0-4 in the MIAA this year. After a close loss Tuesday against Adrian College, the Belles are eager to pull out a win against Alma. 
Despite the setbacks faced over the past month, the Belles remain con­fident about

Belles coach 
"We are as hungry as ever to get a win and get things on track," coach Suzanne Bellina said. "We are still focusing on getting the little things done as well as getting an aggres­sive mentality for 40 minutes rather than just parts of the game." 
Alma College (8-5) has tra­ditionally been a tough oppo.. nent for the Belles, and thi~ year looks to be no exception. Forward Karen Hall, who recently was named MIAA player of the week, should be a strong presence in the post for Alma. 

The Belles will try to count­er Alma's good shooting and inside game with a deter­mined defense and a com­bined team effort. 
"We feel that our depth, defensive intensity and rebounding are our big keys in winning this game," Bellina said. "The key to turning this season around is getting _all of our players on the same page at the same time." 
Center Emily Creachbaum probably has been the most consistent player for the Belles this year, but the team has done best in

that have stepped up at different times throughout the season." 
The Belles will play nine of their last ten games against conference teams. With a win against Alma, the Belles can snap their losing streak and gain their first conference win of the year. 
The Belles will play at home against Alma Saturday at 3 p.m.

Pace are unorthodox guys. To their credit, they stay to their strengths." 
On the other hand, Brey is anxious to see his team return to a student-filled Joyce Center for the first time since a loss against Indiana. Then, in December, Notre Dame had dropped to a losing record for the first time in the Mike Brey era and the Irish were reeling. Now, having gone 6-1 since that loss, Brey wants to see how his squad responds to a boisterous crowd. 
"Sometimes the energy in our building, we don't handle that well," Brey said. "I talked to them about using the crowd to our advantage.... 
"We have to use the energy to play defense and not try to do something on offense that's not us." 
Surprisingly, Notre Dame has had little trouble playing well on the road. The Irish rallied from a six-point deficit with three minutes left to beat Villanova and nearly snapped Pittsburgh's two-season-long home winning streak. 
That road-warrior attitude is one the Irish want to bring into the Joyce Center. 
"We have a road identity where we are real focused on the road," Quinn said. "We have to carry that over to our home court and use the crowd for dif­ferent things to our advantage." 
Saturday's game is the frrst in a string of matchups against ranked foes. Notre Dame still has to play Kentucky, Pittsburgh, Syracuse again, Providence and No. 1 Connecticut twice. Beating any of those teams would help Notre Dame's quali­ty-win component and improve their RPI ranking, which was 11Oth in the nation this week.

MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Brey wants Quinn to be aggressive from tip-off 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 
His shot wasn't falling, his game was suffering and Chris Quinn was struggling. 
So after Notre Dame's loss to Indiana Dec. 10, Irish coach Mike Brey made Quinn the team's sixth man for Notre Dame's next six games to shake up the Irish lineup. 
The results were impressive. Quinn shot 33-for-57 over the stretch, averaged 16 points a game and went four straight games without a turnover. 
Convinced that Quinn had shaken whatever ailed him, Brey re-inserted the sopho­more guard into the lineup against Pittsburgh and said Quinn will start Saturday against the Orangemen. 
"There was a change in his dynamic a bit, his awareness was heightened and it jump­started his play," Brey said of the initial switch. "That's great. But now I want him going out with 19:59 on the game clock." 
Quinn, for his part, took the switch in stride. While his min­utes didn't drop, he feels ready to be back on the floor during the opening tip. And Quinn is willing to take what Brey told him to heart. 
"He has been impressing upon me all year not to pass up any shots," the sophomore said. "He wants me to be aggressive because for our team to be successful, I'm going to have to get off some shots." 
In his element 
At the beginning of the sea­son, senior Torrian Jones felt ready to explode. He'd worked all summer on improving many different aspects of his game, and Jones -a three-year role player for the Irish -relished the opportunity to see his first extended minutes. 
But in his last three games, Jones has averaged a double­double-11.7 points and 10.3 rebounds -in part because Brey said Jones has returned to doing what he does best ­playing tough defense, slashing to the basket and tipping in rebounds. 
"You gotta let a guy try a lit­

tle bit of everything," Brey 
said. "But when it comes down 
to it, that's who you are and 
that's who he is." 
Jones, one of Notre Dame's most vocal leaders. knows the Irish often key off 'his play. That's why he feels it's his responsibility to help set the .tone in big games like Saturday's clash against 
Syracuse. 
"My play on the court is 

going to reflect the rest of the 
team's play, and they are going 
to look to me for guidance and 
leadership on the court," Jones 
said. "When I'm out there, I'm 
staying within myself, doing 
the small things to affect the 
team in a positive way." 
New member 
With Notre Dame's big men 

beset by injuries, Brey started 
looking for another body to 
help the Irish in practice. 
So he turned to the football 
team. 
Enter 6-foot-6, 230-pound tight end John Carlson, who joined the basketball team over Christmas Break with football coach Tyrone Willingham's blessing. Carlson is the first athlete to play both football and basketball since wide receiver Javin Hunter walked onto the basketball team five years ago. 
''It was completely out of the 
blue," the freshman· said. 
"Coming into break, I expected 
to stay home for awhile and 
come back for off-season train~ 
ing. I didn't expect it at all." 
Carlson, who was recruited by a handful of schools to play basketball, said that the foot­ball team was fine with his dabble on the hardcourt as long as he maintained his training regimen and kept his grades up. 
He knows there's. little chance he'll see significant ­or even any -playing time ­this year. But Brey has been highly complimentary of Carlson's play. 
"If he had to go in a game," the coach smiled, "he'd handle himself OK."

"That game was a great confi­dence booster for us," Le'Tania Severe said.

"We know that UConn and every Big East team is going to be a battle," Severe said. "So, the non-conference schedule has prepared us for the Big East." 
West Virginia will test the Irish, as they travel to Huntsville, W.Va. where they face the Mountaineers, who gave the Irish two tough g~mes last sea­son. 
In the first meeting last year, Notre Dame knocked off West Virginia 66-59 at the West Virginia Coliseum. After that, the Irish held on for a 69-64 victory at the Joyce Center. 
Game time is 4 p.m. Saturday.

stout defense, allowing an aver­age of 2.42 goals per game. That defense is backed by two solid netminders in junior Morgan Cey and Brown. 
Each goalie has at least two shutouts this season (Cey with two, Brown with four), and Brown has the third lowest over­all goals against average (2.36) and second highest save percent­age (. 920) in the CCHA. Cey would also be· ranked highly in both lists, with an overall GM of 
1.79 and a save percentage of . 944, but he has not played in enough games to be counted on the official statistics. 
"I think the confidence is really high among our goalies," Poulin said. "When you have two guys back there, I think they help each other. They drive each other, and I know that each of them wants to play every game, but they know the most impor­tant thing for the team is [a win] and they play that way." 
The Irish face a dangerous foe in the Badgers, who sent three players to the U.S. Junior National Team that won a gold medal in Finland in December. Wisconsin coach Mike Eaves was also the coach of that team.

HOCKEY 
No.4 Wisconsin awaits Irish 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 
The Irish hope the third time will be the charm when they face yet another ranked opponent in a grueling non­conference schedule when they meet No. 4 Wisconsin in a two-game road series this weekend. 
Notre Dame has already knocked off two ranked non­CCHA opponents this year on the road, beating then-No. 1 Boston College 1-0 Oct. 24, 
.and defeating then-No. 3 Maine Dec. 28. 
The Irish are actually facing their fourth ranked non-con­ference foe of the season this weekend, with the team losing to then-No. 14 Cornell Dec. 27. 
Irish coach Dave Poulin sees 
many positives in playing a 
difficult schedule. 
"We've played a grueling non-conference schedule and have picked up some big wins," he said. "1 think this

Irish hope to continue winning ways 
11 recruits visiting 
By HEATHER VAN HOEGARDEN Sports Writer 

Mter upsetting two ranked teams in a row (No. 16 Virginia Tech and No.4 Connecticut), Notre Dame looks to continue its play traveling to face West Virginia. 
The Mountaineers, 10-5, 2-2 Big East, come off their first win on the road since Feb. 2, 2001, defeating St. John's Tuesday night, 69-67. 
In the game, six-foot-one center Michelle Carter led West Virginia shooting 8-of-1 0, good for 16 points. Sherell Sowho scored 16 as well, including 4-for-7 from beyond the arc, to go along with 10 rebounds. 
The Mountaineers are also home to the Big East assist leader Yolanda Paige, who averages 7.3 per game and dished out 14 assists against St. John's. 
Meanwhile, Notre Dame (9-6, 2-1 Big East), comes off what were two of arguably its best games of the season.

campus this weekend 
Hoskins, offensive tackle Chauncey Incarnato and defen­sive back Tregg Duerson are all players who have committed verbally but are still making the trip on the first of three week­ends the coaches have remaining to sell Notre Dame. 
Cornerback Courtney Grixby headlines the remainder of the visiting players. 
Grixby, 5-foot-9, 160 pounds, was an explosive quarterback at Central High School in Omaha, Neb. He threw for over 1,200 yards and ran for 800 yards, scoring 14 touchdowns. He also played defensive back on third­and-long situations. In fact, Grixby's versatility already has coaches brainstorming. 
"Notre Dame has started to talk to Courtney about playing receiver," Frank said. "With the ball in his hands, he is just a deadly player. After the staff

Tyrone Willingham and his coaching staff secured a top-five recruiting class last winter. A 10­3 season and the coined 'Return to Glory' of the Notre Dame foot­ball program was attractive enough to lure the talent of immediate impact players such as starting quarterback Brady Quinn and defensive end Victor Abiamiri. 
The 2008 Notre Dame football recruiting class contains few players like an Abiamiri or Quinn who could have such an impact save maybe Grand Rapids, Mich. running back Justin Hoskins, according to Irish Insider colum­nist Mike Frank. 
This weekend the Irish contin­ue to plug away at the remaining talent pool, welcoming 11 play­
