Truck hits goHers' van on Toll Road 
No. 1 player injured, ND vehicle totaled as freshman tries U-turn 
By CLAIRE HEININGER 
News Editor 
A University-issued van driven by a freshman on the Irish men's golf team was hit and totaled by a semi truck on Interstate 80 Thursday afternoon, injuring one of the six team members present in the vehicle. 
Scott Gustafson, the team's top-ranked golfer, was the sole passenger injured in the crash. He was transported to St. Joseph Regional Medical Center with lacerations to the elbow caused by broken glass. Indiana State Police said. 
Gustafson, a junior, was in sta­ble condition at the hospital Thursday night, nursing supervi­sor Stella Ford confirmed. Though University athletic offi-



Rising football ticket prices don't hurt sales 
cials declined to offer details about Gustafson's treatment, golfer Eric Deutsch said his teammate underwent surgery. 
The van was traveling to a team practice session at Lost Dunes Golf Club in Bridgman, Mich., the site of Friday's open­ing round of the Notre Dame Invitational and approximately a 45-minute drive from South Bend. 
Police said the crash occurred at the 69.9 westbound mile marker of I-80 at approximately 
2:20 p.m. The van's driver, fresh­man golfer Gregory Rodgers, reduced his speed in the free­way's left lane as he prepared to make an illegal U-turn, said State Trooper Tim McCormick. 
To avoid plowing into the back of the van as it approached from behind, the semi "had to take

evasive action to avoid collision," McCormick said. He added that several witness accounts con­firmed Rodgers was "driving extremely slow" and therefore was at fault. Rodgers was ticket­ed at the scene for attempting a U-turn on the interstate. 
As the semi sideswiped the van, both vehicles veered into the left median, McCormick said. 
"It was pretty much a blur to me. I'm still kind of shaken up," said Deutsch, a junior who was one of the van's passengers. "We actually got pretty lucky because the semi was empty -if it's full we're not walking." 
Head coach John Jasinski, who was waiting for his team in Bridgman at the time of the crash, said he was unable to visit

Though the time-honored rit­uals of football Saturdays stand out as a special part of the Notre Dame experience, some students seem to be opting out of that tradition -by simply not purchasing football tickets. 
"Defmitely there's the money issue," said Saint Mary's soph­omore Courtney Rusnak, who did not purchase tickets last year. "I understand why the tickets are more expensive, but I also understand why Saint Mary's girls are upset about the prices being so high." 
Notre Dame junior Anna Nussbaum won't be attending football games this year either.

and sophomore years. "For me personally it wasn't a good investment." 
This year, a Notre Dame stu­dent season ticket cost $159 while Saint Mary's students paid $212 for each season tick­et -a 20 percent increase compared to four years ago, when season tickets were $114 and $173 respectively. 
"Quite a few of my friends didn't get tickets," said Saint Mary's sophomore Lindsey Anderson. 
Last year, Anderson split a season ticket with her sister but chose not to purchase a season ticket this fall. Though she hopes to purchase a single ticket for one of the home games, Anderson cited the high cost of the ticket com­bined with low interest in the

INSIDE COLUMN 


Movin' on up 
Three years ago, my family upgraded from a 100-year old house to a brand-new townhouse complex. 
This fall I moved from one of the oldest dorms on 
campus, Lyons Eileen Duffy Hall to, as my former rectress News Production called it, "the Editor 
first world"­the sparkling 
new Welsh Family Hall. 
Guess what? This time it didn't 
cost a thing. 
My old house contained two bed­rooms and one bathroom. Do all of you out there know what it feels like to pull the shower curtain shut when you are taking a bath so another member of your family can go to the bathroom, or to "call" the bathroom on the way home from family outings, like you might call shotgun, or to hold your toothpaste spit for abnormally long amounts of time and finally run downstairs and spit it in the kitchen sink? 
Well, I do. That's why moving to a new house with three bedrooms, four bathrooms and the third floor all to myself is so much more rewarding. 
That's not to say I don't love and miss my old house. After all, it had so much character-my new house looks the same as the other 29 con­nected to it. And my sisters and I will never fall asleep in such close proximity to each other again. 
Living in an old dorm last year was oddly reminiscent of being in my old house. 
In our basement quad I would get out of my top bunk by leaning over and grabbing my roommate's wardrobe, which was on the oppo­site wall. We would change by announcing, "Don't turn around". When I hadn't done my laundry in awhile, it would take up approxi­mately one-fourth of our room. We were in such close quarters that I thank God neither of us broke pari­etals-it could have been a bit awkward. 
Moving into Welsh Family was truly like going from Motel 6 to The Hitz Carlton. I danced around the first day as we set up our futon, which actually fit in the room, loft­ed our beds in two minutes flat and strained to cover that very top inch of our massive wall space. 
Heck, I think Michael Jordan could stand in our room and jump without touching the ceiling. 
Again, that's not to say I don't 
Jove Lyons. I still reminisce about curling up with three of my room­mates in one twin bed to watch "Sex and the City" on a rainy after­noon, and I feel a pang in my heart when I walk under that arch. 
But then I remember that they and I are paying the same fee for two strikingly different living situa­tions. The same rate does not apply at a Motel 6 and a Ritz Carlton. 
I'm not suggesting we tear down the Motel 6 -just charge its patrons less. I speak from experi­ence, and I'm telling you, it's only fair:

Hairpiece theft comes off all wrong 
HARRISBURG, Pa. -A man has been fined and sen­tenced to probation for a hair-raising stunt that left a man bald. 
Paul Goudy, 25, of Lemoyne, pleaded guilty to snatching the hairpiece off the head of another man at a restaurant as part of a dare. 
He was sentenced to 23 months' probation, fined $500 and ordered to write a letter of apology. 
The victim, Edward Floyd, was sitting in the Fisaga restaurant in Harrisburg on Jan. 1 when Goudy ripped the hairpiece off his head, taking with it a gold chain that hung from his neck.

Talk about racing to the altar 
GREENWOOD, Neb. ­Matt Simmons was one of the stars Sunday at Nebraska Raceway Park, but not for his driving. 
Simmons, 29, got the attention of the crowd dur­ing intermission of the Outlaw Vintage Lites Racing Series, when he and fiancee Shannon Fulmer, 24, got married at the track. 
The Davey couple had set two earlier wedding dates, but the traditional nuptials never happened, Simmons said. So about two months ago, they decided they should just get married at the track. 
That solution made sense, Simmons said, since most of his Sundays are spent racing his five-eighths scale replica of a 1932 Chevrolet coupe.

For the first time in 22 years. students. faculty and members of the community will partici­pate in the traditional Domer Run and Walk in honor of a specific individual. 
This year the event is being held in memory of Barbara Ann Link, who battled ovarian can­cer before ·passing away last November. 
Link was one of the first female graduates of Notre Dame and the wife of David Link, dean emeritus of the Notre Dame Law School. 
"[The Domer Hun] is a more traditional event that started as a campus run for students," Bill Heagan, RecSports' assis­tant director of instruction, special event and family pro­gramming said. The event originated as an activity for students to participate in dur­ing one away-game weekend during football season. When RecSports began to sponsor the event in partnership with the Alumni Association in 1997. however, it evolved into a fundraiser for cancer aware­ness and aid programs. 
This year. all proceeds will go to organizations that deal with ovarian cancer in Link's honor. 
All three races that comprise the run -the three and six mile runs and the two mile walk -begin at the north end 
of the stadium and end at Library Quad. 
Over its 22-year evolution, a breakfast for the runners has been added. After completing the course, participants are invited to a pancake breakfast under a tent on Library Quad, where awards will be distrib­uted to the winners of the cate­gories each race. 
There are awards for male and female divisions in each race, and in each gender sub­set there is an award for the undergraduate, graduate stu­dent and faculty and staff win­ners. 
The money raised from the registration fees of the partici­pants and donations by local organizations is collected and distributed by the Alumni Association to local organiza­tions, like the Women's Cancer Task Force. 
A $6 pre-registration is avail­able until 5 p.m. today. Participants can also register for $10 fee at 10 a.m. Saturday before the race begins, under the tent located on Library Quad. 
These fees include the pan­cake breakfast and t-shirt that participants are awarded for completing the course. 
Participants can begin arriv­ing at the tent on Library Quad at 10 a.m .. with the races starting promptly at 11.a.m.

Malloy's book recounts travels 
Special to The Observer 

Father Edward Malloy has circumnavigated the globe for the past 17 years as the University of Notre Dame's president -from th.e Holy Land to Ireland, Chile to Iceland, Tibet to Ground Zero. 
In "Monk's Travels: People, Places, and Events," a new book published by Andrews McMeel, Father Malloy recounts his impressions of the places he has visited and the people he has met in more than two dozen nations and locations world­wide. The book is the prod­uct of the diaries he has pro­duced in the aftermath of his many presidential journeys.

He wants to guaran­tee his safety and security by making sure that everything is predictable and familiar.

Insurgents take three hostages 
Gunmen kidnap two Americans, one Briton in morning raid ofIraqi capital 
Associated Press 

BAGHDAD -A team of kidnappers grabbed two Americans and a Briton in a dawn raid on their home on a leafy Baghdad street Thursday _ a bold abduc­tion that underlines the increasing danger for for­eigners in the embattled capital as violence soars ahead of national elections planned for early next year. 
West of the capital, U.S. forces launched attacks Thursday in the Sunni insurgent strongholds of Fallujah and Ramadi, killing up to 60 insurgents in strikes against allies of terror mastermind Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a mili­tary statement said. The military said that the "for­eign fighters" were killed near Fallujah, but hospital officials there said the city was calm and that they had not received any casu­alties. 
The military launched what it called a "precision strike" against a house in Fallujah and followed it with a second strike in a nearby town. The second strike destroyed three buildings allegedly used by Zarqawi's network.

Lethal injections tnay be banned 
Lawsuits seek to nix means of capital punishment 


Missing evidence Marine resurfaces 
Attorney says Iraqi man's larynx is found in freezer in Germany 

Associated Pres 
LOUISVILLE, Ky. -Lethal injection, when used for the first time in Texas nearly 22 years ago, was touted as a more humane way to execute prison­ers than the firing squad, hang­ing, the gas chamber or even the electric chair. 
Today, though, death penalty opponents are challenging that notion based on the Constitution's Eighth Amendment. which prohibits "cruel and unusual punish­ments inflicted." 
Attorneys in at least a dozen of the 37 states that use lethal injection have filed lawsuits seeking to ban the procedure, which they say puts inmates through excruciating pain because the anesthetic wears off before the two other drugs are injected. 

Prosecutors and victims rights advocates call the lawsuits "the appeal du jour." 
"It is clear that no method would be acceptable to those who oppose capital punishment in principle," said Pete Adams, executive director of the Louisiana District Attorney's Association. "It should be remembered that anti-death penalty advocates see their cause as a long-term campaign to be waged on many fronts." 
The most recent anti-death penalty action was brought in civil court in Kentucky. Earlier this year, New Jersey stopped lethal injections after an appeals court found insufficient medical knowledge to support the procedure. 
The Kentucky case involves two convicted murderers, 
Thomas Clyde Bowling and Ralph Baze. Their lawyers argue that Bowling and Baze "will ... be tortured to death" if the state executes them by lethal injection. 
A lethal injection is comprised of an anesthetic, a paralytic drug and potassium chloride, which causes cardiac arrest. 
Pennsylvania state Rep. Daylin Leach has proposed eliminating the paralytic drug from that state's lethal injec­tion. Not using it may show whether inmates are uncon­scious when receiving potassi­um chloride or if they are awake and just unable to speak, Leach said. Someone squirming and screaming in pain as the lethal dose is administered could be enough to prompt states to refine the procedure, he said. 
Associated Press 

SAN DIEGO -Missing med­ical evidence taken from the body of an Iraqi man beaten by Marine prison guards resurfaced this week, a defense attorney for an officer charged in connection with the man's death said Thursday. For months, the military had insisted the evidence was lost. 
An Army medical examiner found the larynx of Nagem Hatab in a freezer in Germany, said Keith Higgins, a civilian defense attorney. The examin­er, Col. Kathleen Ingwersen, conducted Hatab's autopsy in Iraq and concluded he died from a broken bone in his neck. 
Higgins represents Marine Maj. Clarke Paulus, who ran the jail at the prison camp and is accused of ordering one of his men to drag Hatab by his neck after the Iraqi suffered a severe bout of diarrhea and collapsed while in custody. 
Paulus, 35, faces up to 4 1/2 years in prison if convicted of aggravated assault, dereliction of duty and maltreatment of prisoners. Court-martial is scheduled to begin in November at Camp Pendleton, the Marine base north of San Diego. 
Last week, a military judge delayed the start of the court­martial because of the missing evidence and ordered prosecu­tors to redouble their efforts to find the items. The judge, Col. Robert Chester, threatened "some extreme measures" to correct what he viewed as serious problems interfering the case. 
Biggins said it was "dis­heartening and extremely troubling" that military doc­tors would act so carelessly with evidence that he deemed crucial to clearing his client's name. 
!Iiggins also said an Army criminal investigator found a rib cage that may belong to !latah in a refrigerator at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington, D.C. Ingwersen's autopsy found that !latah had six broken ribs. Hesults from a DNA test to determine whether the ribs were from !Iatab's body are expected Friday, Higgins said. 
Christopher Kelly. a spokesman for the institute. said he was unaware of the specifics of the case and could not comment. 
Marine guards have testified Hatab was targeted for rough treatment because they believed he had a role in the ambush of a U.S. Army convoy that killed 11 soldiers and led to the capture of Pfc. Jessica Lynch and others. 
The missing bones are just one of several errors in the investigation that became known at a hearing last week. !latah's organs, removed dur­ing the autopsy. were destroyed when they were left for hours in the blazing heat on an Iraqi airstrip. 
Marine Sgt. Gary Pittman was convicted earlier this month of dereliction of duty and abuse of prisoners at the prison camp, but was cleared of assaulting Hatab. Pittman was sentenced to 60 days of hard labor and demoted to private.

Martha Stewart to report to prison 
NEW YORK-Martha Stewart said she would miss her many pets and hoped to be free in time for her cherished spring gardening. 
Otherwise. she seemed determined to get her ordeal over with when she announced Wednesday she would surrender within weeks to begin serving her five-month prison sen­tence. 
Speaking at a choreographed news confer­ence before a brilliant array of color swatches, Stewart said she will continue to appeal her conviction -but will head for prison anyway to end what she called a personal nightmare. 
"I must reclaim my good life," the 63-year­old millionaire businesswoman declared. "I must return to my good works and allow those around me who work with me to do the same." 
Stewart was convicted March 5 of lying about why she sold 3,928 shares of ImClone Systems Inc. stock on Dec. 27. 2001. the day before a negative announcement about the company that sent the price plunging. 
She was sentenced in July to five months in prison and five months of house arrest. The judge allowed her to remain free pending appeal ,.--but defense lawyers have now asked the judge to lift that order.

Stocks show signs of promise 
Though volatile oil prices loom, Wall Street begins to gain momentum 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Stocks regained some momentum Thursday as fresh economic data suggested inflation remains well under control. but volatile oil prices gave investors some pause late in the session. 
Analysts are closely watching stocks for signs that the market will stabi­lize in the second half of the year, but choppy trading has made it difficult to build confidence among investors. particularly given recent fluctuations in oil prices.

Bush visits South on fundraising trip 
Incumbent seeks women's votes 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Bush is dusting off his fund­raiser-in-chief hat and resum­ing the task of collecting cam­paign cash for himself and other Republican candidates. 
lie was raising money Friday in Washington and North Carolina and, while down south, was holding an event designed to boost his standing among women vot­ers. 
Bush last appeared at a fund-raiser Aug. 13 in Seattle, and has spent far less time raising money in recent months than campaigning. 
Both he and Democratic challenger John Kerry have accepted $75 million in tax­payer money for the general campaign, but the GOP and Democratic parties will spend tens of millions more and the candidates continue to help raise that cash. The parties can spend roughly $16 million each in coordination with their presidential nominees, and unlimited amounts inde­pendent of them. 
Bush was to attend a Republican Party fund-raiser at a Washington hotel before another at the Charlotte, N.C., home of C.D. Spangler Jr., a retired banker and former president of the University of North Carolina system. The Charlotte fund-raiser also will benefit the campaign of GOP Hep. Richard Burr, who is run­ning for an open Senate seat against Democrat Erskine Bowles, a former chief of staff to President Clinton. 

In between, Bush was to talk up the benefits to women of his policies on comp time, job training, welfare-to-work, medical malpractice lawsuits and other issues. 
The event has Bush cam­paigning in the home state of Democratic vice presidential nominee John Edwards, a sen­ator from North Carolina. The Kerry-Edwards ticket has been campaigning aggressive­ly there in hopes of putting the state's 15 electoral votes in play, though it was last car­ried by a Democrat in 1976 and Bush easily won there in 2000. 
Polls last month showed Bush with a narrow lead in the state. 
Bush, who aims to put North Carolina out of contention before Kerry boosts his adver­tising spending there, was last in the state in July, for anoth­er fund-raiser. 
From North Carolina, Bush was traveling to his family's compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, where he was spending the weekend. He leaves Sunday to visit hurricane-rav­aged Alabama and FLorida before returning to Washington.

AP John Wilhelm, left, president of Hospitality Industry Unite Here, appears before demonstrators on the beach In Atlantic City, N.J. 
Associated Press 
ATLANTIC CITY. N.J. ­Waving signs that read "No Contract. No Peace" and "Contract Now," an estimat­ed 5,000 casino-hotel work­ers Thursday marched along the Boardwalk and onto the beach in a boisterous show of union solidarity. 
There were no arrests or reports of violence, police said. 
Most of the marchers were members of the 17.000­member Local 54 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees union, which has been working without a contract since mid­night Tuesday. Union mem­bers have voted to authorize a strike. but one has not been called. 
"We don't want to strike, but we will if we have to," said Mary Walsh. 43, a buffet server at Resorts· Atlantic City. "Here, we're trying to show we're all together." 
The union, which repre­sents bartenders, cooks, cocktail servers, housekeep­ers and other rank-and-file casino employees, is embroiled in a bitter dispute with the casinos over the use of nonunion subcontractors in casino restaurants and bars. 
They were joined by mem­bers of the union's interna­tional affiliate, and by con­struction trades workers and other union supporters from neighboring states. 
Starting at opposite ends of the Boardwalk, two groups waved signs and chanted slo­gans, squeezing bystanders to the storefronts and rail­ings that line the Boardwalk. 
The union last struck in 1999 with a three-day walk­out that forced casinos to curtail some services and put executives and managers to work in the vacated union jobs. 

Iraq inspector to find no WMDs 
Report draft concludes Hussein did not stockpile 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Drafts of a report from the top U.S. inspector in Iraq conclude there were no stockpiles of weapons of mass destruc­tion, but say there are signs the fallen Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had dor­mant programs he hoped to revive at a later time, according to people familiar with the findings. 
In a 1, 500-page report, the head of the Iraq Survey Group, Charles Duelfer, will find Saddam was importing banned materials, working on unmanned aerial vehicles in violation of U.N. agree­ments and maintaining a dual-use industrial sector that could produce weapons. 
Duelfer also says Iraq only had small research and development programs for chemical and biological weapons. 
As Duelfer puts the finish­ing touches on his report, he concludes Saddam had intentions of restarting weapons programs at some point, after suspicion and inspections from the inter­national community waned. 
After a year and a half in Iraq. however, the United States has found no weapons of mass destruction -its chief argument for overthrowing the regime. 
An intelligence official said Duelfer could wrap up the report as soon as this month, but noted it may take time to declassify it. 
Those who discussed the report inside and outside the government did so on the condition of anonymity 
because it contains classi­fied material and is not yet completed. 
If the report is released publicly before the Nov. 2 election, Democrats are likely to seize on the docu­ment as another opportunity to criticize the Bush admin­istration's leading argument for war in Iraq and the dete­riorating security situation there. 
Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry has criticized the president's handling of the war in Iraq, but has also said he still would have voted to author­ize the war even if he had known no weapons of mass destruction would be found there. 
Duelfer's report is expect­ed to be similar to findings reported by his predecessor, David Kay, who presented an interim report to Congress in October. Kay left the post in January, say­ing, "We were almost all wrong" about Saddam's weapons programs. 
The new analysis, howev­er, is expected to fall between the position of the Bush administration before the war portraying Saddam as a grave threat ­and the declarative state­ments Kay made after he resigned. 
It will also add more evi­dence and flesh out Kay's October findings. 
Then, Kay said the Iraq Survey Group had only uncovered limited evidence of secret chemical and bio­logical weapons programs, but he found substantial evi­dence of an Iraqi push to 


Nickel gets make-over 
Jefferson head bigger, bolder on coin 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Thomas Jefferson appears bolder and bigger on new five-cent pieces, marking his first makeover since he landed on the nickel in 1938. 
The maker of the nation's coins, the U.S. Mint, revealed designs for two new nickels to be issued in 2005. The unveil­ing Thursday was the latest in a series of design changes for the coins. 
A new likeness of Jefferson will be on the front of the two revamped coins, giving the third president a "fresh, con­temporary look," Mint Director Henrietta Holsman Fore said. The "tails" side also gets updat­ed. 
With the makeover, Jefferson will move from the center of the coin to the side, where he gazes in a close-up profile that shows more detailed features of his face. 
"I wanted an image that was large enough so that you could see the determination and intel­ligence in his eyes. The kind­ness of his mouth. His sense of humor. The main thing that was guiding me ... I wanted you to get a sense of the character of the person," said artist Joe Fitzgerald, who created the design for the front of the new nickel. 

boost the range of its ballis­tic missiles beyond prohibit­ed ranges. 
He also said there was almost no sign that a signifi­cant nuclear weapons proj­ect was under way. 
Duelfer's report doesn't reach firm conclusions in all areas. 
For instance, U.S. officials are still investigating whether Sad dam's fallen regime may have sent chem­ical weapons equipment and several billion dollars over the border to Syria. That has not been confirmed, but remains an area of interest to the U.S. government. 
The Duelfer report will co me months after the Senate Intelligence Committee released a scathing assessment of the prewar intelligence on Iraq. 
After a yearlong inquiry. the Republican-led commit­tee said in July the CIA kept key information from its own and other agencies' analysts, engaged in "group think" by failing to chal­lenge the assumption that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and allowed President Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell to make false state­ments. 
The Iraq Survey Group has been working since the sum­mer of 2003 to find Saddam's weapons and bet­ter understand his prohibit­ed programs. 
More than a thousand civilian and military weapons specialists, trans­lators and other experts have been devoted to the effort. 
Also on the front of both new coins: The word "liberty" will appear in script -as Jefferson once had written in his own hand. The phrase "In God We Trust" remains as well as the year. 
Daniel Jordan, president of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which owns and administers Jefferson's Virginia home, Monticello, described the new likeness as "truly impres­sive and it is entirely appropri­ate." Besides being a founding father of the nation, Jefferson was an avid coin collector, he said. 
The back of one of the new nickels -which will be released early next year -fea­tures an American bison on a grassy patch, a design that is reminiscent of the buffalo nick­el first issued in 1913. The words "United States of America" wrap around the top of the coin, above the bison's image. The phrase "E Pluribus Unum" is below the bison as is "Five Cents." 
The tails side of the second new nickel features a view of the water from a rocky coast­line dotted with trees. There's the phrase "Ocean in view! 0! The joy!" That's a quote from explorer William Clark's jour­nal, a reference to the Lewis and Clark expedition's quest to reach the Pacific Ocean.

LOS ANGELES -Each year, 
January and February bring an 
escalating rush of red-carpet 
exciwment with the Golden 
Clotws, Screen Actors Guild 
Awards and Oscars. 
Tlwn comes September and 
litth~ orphan Emmy. 
lntPnded to serve as the stan­
dard-bearer for the opening of 
the fall TV season, the 
Academy of Television Arts & 
SciPnces awards are far 
rPmoved from the convergent 
frenzy of other Hollywood self­
love pageants. 
But what if Emmy's isolation 
e1Hkd? After all, the traditional 
fall-to-spring TV season has 
bPen declared passe by at least 
o1w broadcast network and is 
little observed by cable chan­
lwls. 
Could an earlier Emmy cere­
mony juice viewership, which 
last year measured just under 
18 million? That's compared to 
nearly 27 million viewers for 
this year's Golden Globes and 
43 million-plus for the Oscars. 
For actors, the shift from Los 
Angeles' typically sizzling 
September to a cooler month 
amounts to a health and safety 
iSS LIP. 
"At that time of year, it's 4 in 
the afternoon in Los Angeles 
and it's 98 degrees and they're 
sweating in their tuxedoes," 
observed analyst Bill Carroll of 
Katz Television Group. 
Most importantly, a spring­time awards show could benefit worthy but ratings-challenged shows that need a boost. 
"Emmys have a noble history of saving shows," said Tom O'Neil. author of "The Emmys" and host of GoldDerby.com. an awards prediction Web site. 
"All in the Family" was mired in the ratings cellar after it debuted in January 1971. The Emmys were held in the spring that year and the sitcom received the best comedy series award as well as the best new series trophy [no longer given] and went on to become an invaluable part of America's culture. 
This Sunday, when the 56th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards are held [airing 8 p.m. EDT on ABC]. the critically lauded yet low-rated Fox sit­com "Arrested Development" could be the beneficiary of Emmy largesse. 
After evading cancellation, its best comedy series bid could draw audience attention to its charms. 
Emmy's impact on endan­gered programs would be even greater if the awards came early in the year when they have a chance to affect viewer­ship for struggling shows. 
More than a few series can­celed in May, when the fall schedules are announced. have enjoyed the empty honor of an Emmy nomination in July. 
Those wary of change should consider the evidence: Until 1976 the awards were usually held no later than May, at the TV season's conclusion. They moved to September in 1977 after a split between East and West Coast factions of the TV academy. 
20,1999. 

The grand jury said it didn't hand up any indictments because all the witnesses claimed to know nothing about the missing sher­iffs records. The records involved a draft search warrant for Harris' house a year before the attack. 
Salazar took the case to the grand jury after the sherifl' asked him to investigate last fall. 
The grand jury report said the draft affidavit, never submitted to a judge. was the subject of "a pri­vate meeting of high-ranking Jefferson County ofTicials and law enforcement officials" called a few days after the attack to dis­cuss the document and its "potential liabilities." 
As a result of that meeting, sheriff's office decided agai discussing the affidavit in an 30, 1999, news conferenc state district judge ordered affidavit's rnlease in 2001.

DENVEH-Authorities decided soon after the Columbine High School massacre to withhold a document showing deputies knew one of the killers had been accused two years earlier of mak­ing death threats and building pipe bombs, according to a grand jury report released Thursday. 
The grand jury also said it was "troubled" by still-missing docu­ments in what remains the dead­liest school attack in U.S. history. But it did not hand up any indict­ments, closing at least the third investigation that has elected not to place any blame for the slaughter of 13 people by suicidal teens Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. 
Victims' families said the report confirmed their suspicions that the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office covered up mistakes that could have led authorities to the killers as much as two years before the attack. 
"Clearly Columbine never should have happened and they don't want the public to know that," said Brian Hohrbough, one of several family members who met Thursday with Attorney General Ken Salazar. Rohrbough's son. Daniel, was among the students slain on April

Officer accuses panelists of bias 
Hurricane Jeanne 
Dismissals suggested in Guantanamo Bay hearings 

ravages Caribbean 
Associated Press 

SAN JUAN -The presiding officer in charge of U.S. mili­tary commissions in Guantanamo Bay has recom­mended that two panel mem­bers be dismissed from hear­ing cases of suspected terror­ists because they could be con­sidered biased. 
t\rmy Col. Peter Brownback made the recommendations in a letter to commissions' appointing authority and obtained by The Associated Press on Thursday. The recom­mendation for their dismissal came after defense challenges last month at preliminary hearings for four Guantanamo prisoners charged with war crimes. 
The two men Brownback said should step aside were Air Force Lt. Col. Timothy Toomey, an intelligence officer who was involved in capture of suspects in Afghanistan, and alternate panel member, Army Lt. Col. Curt Cooper, who admitted calling Guantanamo prisoners "terrorists." 
"Specifically, his comments that the detainees in Cuba were terrorists. or words to that effect, might cause some to believe that he has pre­judged the cases," Brownback wrote in the letter dated Sept. 15, 2004. and made in response to a series of chal­lr.nges. 
·Toomey's activities in Afghanistan could be seen as problematic, wrote Brownback, who recommend­ed keeping panel members Marine Col.· Jack Sparks Jr. 
and Marine Col. Thomas Bright -two members indi­vidually challenged because of their links with the war on ter­ror. 
Sparks lost a reservist work­ing as a firefighter in the Sept. 11 attack on New York City, and Bright assembled lists of detainees bound for Guantanamo. 
Brownback's recommenda­tions came after an unexpect­ed challenge from the govern­Brownback to evaluate his suitability. 
Brownback worked with the commission's appointing authority, John Altenburg, in Fort Bragg, N.C. He also spoke at a retirement roast for Altenburg and attended the wedding of Altenburg's son. Brownback's wife also worked in Altenburg's office. 
"We request that he [Brownback] closely evaluate his own suitability to serve as 

the presiding officer ... with particular attention focused on whether his impartiality might reason­ably be ques­tioned," Swann said in his filing.

Jeanne's heavy rains reached to the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo, where a 4-month-old child died when a landslide crushed part of her family's house, said Jose Luis German, spokesman for the National Emergency Committee. 
At least eight people were injured as trees toppled and floods struck parts of the east and northeast, officials said. Crashing waves pounded the north coast, along with high winds that knocked over palm trees. 
Telephone service and elec­tricity were out in some areas. Some airline flights were can­celed. 
"We're all afraid," said Julie Acosta, 17, helping her father tie down their tin roof with rope as winds and rain intensi­fied around Samana, a coastal town popular with European tourists about 60 miles north­east of Santo Domingo. 
More than 8,200 Dominicans were evacuated and took refuge in shelters set up in schools and churches, officials

said. 
"I had to come here because at night this becomes scary," said Mario Vasquez, a 40-year­old farmer crowded with 150 people into a school in blacked­out Samana. "People could die out here." 
Beachside hotels and restau­rants closed along the north coast, while authorities ordered boats into port. 
Jeanne hit the Dominican Republic with 80 mph winds before dropping 70 mph, just shy of hurricane strength. 
The storm raged across Puerto Rico on Wednesday, dumping up to two feet of rain. flooding hundreds of homes, snapping trees and downing power lines. 
"It left a wake of destruction that we now have to face," Puerto Rico's Gov. Sila Calderon said Thursday. She asked President Bush to declare a disaster to speed the release of federal aid. 
About 3,600 Puerto Ricans remained in shelters Thursday, dozens of roads were blocked, most of the 4 million islanders were without power and some 600,000 without running water for a second day. Calderon said. 
One Puerto Rican woman was kille·d Wednesday when winds flung her from a hammock and smashed her into a neighbor's house, and a man putting up storm shutters died when he fell from a roof, police said. 
At 8 p.m., Jeanne's eye was over the northeast Dominican Republic, about 65 miles north­east of Santo Domingo. The storm was drifting, with storm­force winds stretched out 70 miles, and expected to remain near the Dominican coast through Friday. A slow west­northwest turn was expected in 12-24 hours. 
In the U.S. Virgin Islands, debris littered streets and some residents shoveled mud from homes. Two prisoners escaped from a St. Croix jail during the storm, though it was unclear how, police said.

QUOTE OF THE DAY 
"Suppose you were an idiot, and suppose you were a member ofCongress: but I repeat myself" 
Mark Twain author 




the most productive Americans will fund the swarm of costly social programs he proposes. How often is Bush asked to elab­orate on his plans to revamp the tax code? I try not to hold my breath when I turn on CNN. 
Instead of policy debate and positive campaigning, Bush and Kerry are locked in a prisoner's dilemma that neither serves the electorate nor gives either candidate the upper hand. lifted from the tradi­tional game theory appli­cation, a prisoner's dilemma occurs when both sides would bene­fit from cooperating, but a defection allows one side to gain an advantage until the other follows suit, ending in an "equilib­rium" with a payoff inferior to the possibili­ty of mutual coopera­tion for both players. 
In the election game, each side faces the option of strictly positive campaign­ing or allowing and engaging in cheap partisan attacks, and four possible states can ensue. One, Bush and Kerry scarcely discuss each other's shortcomings while focusing on chiefly on how to achieve their vision for the future, and independent attack groups keep their dogs in the pen. Two, Bush takes hit after hit from Kerry. Edwards, Gore, Moore and Whoopi Goldberg, while no one fires back in Kerry's direction. Three, Kerry somehow halts the seething rage against Bush from fomenting and spilling over as Republicans and angry swift boat veterans target the Kerry punching bag. Or four, both sides clash in juvenile name-calling and fear-mongering that overshadows the most crucial issues facing the country. 
In a perfect world, the hand-holding love­fest scenario would be ideal for voters to form an informed opinion, but the unaffiliated 527s, diminutive 
Vermont governors, and angry documentary filmmakers are an unchecked force 
that make that equilibri­um unattainable. Both 
of the lopsided scenar­ios are possible for a brief period, but the 
moment one side gains the upper hand in attacks, the opposi­tion will strike back with equal or greater 
vigor. Events from the last 
month and a half sup­port the idea of a political prisoner's dilemma, though 
the candidates themselves have played little role in the proceedings. liberal-leaning 527 
groups and political action committees had already spent tens of millions on televi­sion ads trying to depict the president as a blundering idiot or diabolical madman. but their messages rarely swayed the inde­pendent and moderate voters who view over-the-top portrayals as misleading. 
Conservative or anti-Kerry groups were scarce, until the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth crashed the Massachusetts Senator's convention salute with allegations of duplicity, forcing him to revise his "Christmas in Cambodia" claims and admit that his first Purple Heart may not have come from combat. Suddenly. members of Kerry's naval division who disapproved of him outnumbered his supporters 154-12. Most claims remain unsubstantiated, but their unwavering case certainly hurt Kerry in the month of August. 

Sensing that the traction gained by anti­Kerry forces has not been matched, Kerry's campaign staff is now in turmoil as insiders have questioned campaign manager Bob Shrum's effectiveness. Clinton-era advisers Paul Begala and Jim Carville have stepped up their consulting as Democrats urge Kerry and Democrats everywhere to attack. 
Already the angle of choice is Bush's national guard service, which was seem­ingly exhausted in the 2000 cycle but strikes a contrast between Bush's service at home and Kerry's service in Vietnam. As Democrats vamp up the negative cam­paigning to reach a stable equilibrium, they may succeed in tarnishing Bush's image beyond that which their partisan allies have attained in the past four years. Nevertheless. as both sides scrape the bot­tom of the character defamation barrel. the clear loser is the American voter who may only be left choosing between the lesser of two evils.

Defining true community 
This letter is in response to Brian Moy's Sept. 15 letter, "ND lacks true community." We are not denying that Notre Dame should have a strong community atmosphere, but community should never be a force directed against outsiders. 
First, let us discuss Moy's reaction to the "pompous" alumnus. We are not sure why it is inappropriate for this man to have proceeded with his transaction with the Michigan fan after Moy had already rejected his offer. Asserting that the alumnus should have backed out of an agreement merely because Moy is a Notre Dame student seems worthier of the label "pompous." Following through with the transaction shows a level of maturity that Moy clearly has not reached. 
Furthermore, everyone remembers the way Michigan fans treat­ed Notre Dame fans last year at Ann Arbor. We are proud that Notre Dame fans had the dignity to treat Michigan fans with humanity and respect when they visited South Bend last weekend. No one likes to see people wearing "Rudy Sucks" T-shirts in front of them. but ignoring the slogan and focusing our attention on the game exhibits the tolerance of which we, as educated adults, should be capable. Moy spoke of Sept. 11 in his letter; tolerance is one of the most important lessons that day should have taught us. No one would argue against strengthening the sense of Notre Dame com­munity, but unity can be dangerous when it is used as a tool of dis­crimination. That is yet another lesson from the Sept. 11 attacks on our country, freedom and beliefs that apparently has eluded Moy. 
Finally, it is important to note that the two Michigan students attacked by Moy and his fellow Dillonites did nothing other than wear semi-offensive T-shirts, to provoke the onslaught they received. In fact, after Moy began to taunt the students, he encour­aged his band of Dillonites to join in. Since two Notre Dame students had sacrificed their tickets so their visiting friends could watch the game, why Moy felt his personal space was invaded is unclear. The two "troublemakers" simply defended the visiting students' right to be there. How better to spread the sense of Notre Dame community than to invite outsiders in? Moy needs to learn the true definition of the Notre Dame community and realize that ours is not one of arro­gance and exclusivity.

U-WIRE 
Policy cripples tnilitary 
In my last few columns, I refrained from using Sept. 11 to convince anyone that Kerry is the right man for the job of president. 
However, this week the partisan gloves are coming off, and attacks on President Bush's claim of being more capable of making M tth America safer will be made. ew
;k

First, let me defend the sitting uya president on a particular issue. It Iowa State is true that during the Sept. 11 Daily attacks, Bush showed exemplary leadership. From the evacuation of the vice presi­dent and congressional leaders to Air Force One fly­ing to the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Nebraska, Americans knew that our government was still in charge. 
Second, Michael Moore attacks the fact Bush sat in a classroom for seven minutes before taking action. All I can say is that I would be worried ifhe had not shown any human reaction to what was a tragic day in our nation's history. No one attacks Rudy Giuliani for shedding tears; some could call that a sign of weakness. So for me, Bush demonstrating a seven­minute period where his body exhibited the fight-or­flight response to danger is not a concern. 
In my view, Bush was a powerful rallying point for our country during that time, and it's clear that at the end of the seven-minute period he chose to fight. Having said some nice things about Bush. I will not hold back on my criticisms of his policies and values. 
In Nov. 2002, CBS News reported on the military's desperate need for interpreters during a time of a tragic shortage of skilled linguists. Yet, despite this fact, the military saw it necessary to discharge nine qualified linguists, six of whom were capable of translating Arabic, due to the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy. 
In the latest issue of The Advocate, a report shows that 3,000 gay and lesbian military personnel have been discharged since 1998 under this policy. In 2001, there were 1,273 discharges, and in 2003 there were 787. Do the math, and it's easy to see that more than two-thirds of the discharges since 1998 occurred on Bush's watch. 
I'm sure someone out there might find it amusing to claim that those service members are cowards unwilling to fight the war on terror, but that would be a disservice to the estimated 50,000 service mem­bers who hide and lie about their sexuality on a daily basis in order to continue fighting for our country. 
How can we as an electorate claim that Bush will be a stronger leader more capable of protecting America from terrorists when he so willingly casts aside qualified and patriotic soldiers? How can we claim a better capability to fmd and root out terror­ists when the vital challenge of the language barrier is more difficult to overcome due to a shortage of interpreters only made worse by casting aside quali­fied gays and lesbians? 
The true measure ofleadership is doing what is in the best interest of the country. When John Kerry testified against the "don't ask, don't tell" policy. something he did during an apparently "nonexist­ent" Senate career, he knew that it would weaken our military. 
Republicans like to hold up distorted interpreta­tions of Senate votes to say John Kerry has consis­tently voted to weaken our military, but in this case, who is really weakening our defenses? 
Why then would Bush not use the bipartisan sup­port after Sept. 11 to repeal this unwise Clinton poli­cy? The Republican platform passed during their convention gives insight into their agenda by stating that homosexuality is incompatible with military service, in addition to stating opposition to discrimi­nation laws. same-sex marriage and civil unions. 
It's easier to make an argument that homosexuals don't deserve equal rights when there are no gay heroes in the public eye. IfAmericans knew the number of gays who died protecting them from ter­rorists, it would be harder to hold the divisive posi­tions the Bush administration apparently supports. 
This is why John Kerry. who welcomes the gay community into the American mainstream, is more qualified than Bush to protect our country. He passes the test ofleadership.

F 
or those of us not luc:ky nnough to win tickets to the Michigan State game this Saturday night, the Student Union Board is kicking ofT their concert year with a students-only show at Legends featuring The Clarks. Longtime favorites of the college circuit, the Pittsburgh-based band has been touring and playing their unique but classie mix of rock, pop. punk, coun­try and a littln bit of everything else for years. Its blend of styles fits well with the vision of SUB. "We would like to see a wider variety of talent this year that will appeal to a greater number of students, rather than a select few," concerts programmer Hich Fox said. Coming off a successful summer of tour­ing. The Clarks has had an exciting past few weeks. With the release of its tenth album, "Fast Moving Cars." and a recent appearance on "The Late Show with David Lnttennan." the band is riding high and happy to have the opportunity to play for more people and continue to gnt t1111ir music out 
tlwre. 

"Wn love playing colleges and univer­silios," tour manager John Williams said. "That's what it's all about. stu­dents who !war us and tldl their friends at other schools. Beforo you know it you have people all ovnr the place lis­tl'ning to thP albums. It's great to play somewhere completely n11w and have a lm o s t tlw w h o I e c r o w d k n ow tlHl lyri1:s." 
While it is The Clarks' first show at Notn~ Dame. Pittsburgh-arna students are wnll awar11 of' the talented group. which routinely sell out 13,000 seat vnntws in its hometown. Many other studnnts might recognize the band l'rom various tours over the years. The Clarks averagl' 150 shows a year and has play11d with John Mayer and O.A.H .. as well as two artists who played at Legends last year. Gavin J>p,Graw and Ari I Jest. 
"Fast Moving Cars" features the songwriting and musical talents of all mHmbers of the band: Scott Blasey on lead vocals and guitar, Robert James on guitar and vocals, Greg Joseph on bass and vocals, and Dave Minarik on drums and vocals. 
"It's bHfm a really good thing," Blasey said on the band's Website (www.elark­sonline.com). "It's allowed us to put out a new album every two years." 
The Clarks has built a strong follow­ing nationwide without necessarily becoming mainstream or basking in the limelight. 
Famous or not, with the new CD and continued exposure on national tours, The Clarks is definitely one of the most talented and most notable bands around. 
"SUB is excited to bring a well­known, up-and-coming band to kick ofT our season at Legends," Fox said. 
The next big event for tlw band is perhaps Ollfl of the most fun concerts any band could play. Boarding a Caribbean cruise ship with almost a dozen other performers, including Cowboy Mouth, Gavin DeGraw, and Hello Dave, 'The Hock Boat' will take passengers and music fans from Miami to the Cayman Islands and back,while featuring some of the best new music performed live. 
While they are excited about the cruise, tour manager Williams said coming to Notre Dame would be a 

great opportunity for the group to reach a new audience in a great venue. Now in it's second year. Legends had alrnady featun~d Chicago band Lucky Boys Confusion and hostnd thn first "Best Of Acousticafe" last night. SUB hopes to continue using tlw Legends stagn for exciting young bands, as well as to feature campus talnnt with A co usticafe. 
Thn show begins at 10:30 PM aftPr the game watch sponsored by the Classes of 2006 and 2007 at Legends. 
The Clarks brings a little bit of every­thing and pulls from songs written over the last several years, as well as new ones from "Fast Moving Cars."

Performing Arts Center opens with a bang 
By MARIA SMITH 
Scene Editor 

The opening of the Debartolo Center l'or the Performing Arts is a momen­tous occasion for the Film, Television and ThHatre departments, as well as l'or the campus as a whole. In celebra­tion of this major move l'rom Washington Hall to the new centPr, the faculty l'rom the FTT departments will stag11 a costumed parade in celebra­tion of' thnir move from their old l'aeili­ty to the new building. 
Th11 Campus Open House for the PAC will kick ofT at 4:00 p.m. on the steps of Washington Hall, where the Notre Dame marching band and the faculty of FTT in costume will start a proces­sion to the new building. 
The procession, which will include banners bearing the messages "FTT On the Move" and "Farewell Washington Hall, Hello PAC," is meant as a theatrical representation of the theater department's move to a new home. 
"We're moving from a 19th century building to a 20th century building," said FTT chair Peter Holland. "Washington Hall was much loved, but it doesn't meet our needs." 
Continuous entertainment in the five performing spaces of the PAC from 
4:00 to 10:00 p.m. will give the com­munity a chance to see the spaces in use. Maps will be provided for self-guided tours, and faculty and staff members will be available to answer questions about the building. 
The Leighton Concert Hall will host performances by the Notre Dame glee club, liturgical choir, folk choir, chorale, symphony orchestra, jazz band, and other campus musical groups. Student dramatic performanc­es and monologues will be hosted in the Decio Mainstage Theater and the Philbin Studio Theater. Performances by faculty members and graduate stu­dents will give people a chance to hear the new Fritts organ in the Reyes Organ and Choral Ilall. The Browning Cinema will be used to give sound demonstrations and show student lilms from past years. 

The PAC has been open on a limited basis for concerts and lilm screenings in the Browning Cinema. The open house is the first opportunity for the general public to tour all the main performing spaces in the building and has caused great excitement in the university community. 
"The arts have been kind of an odd stepchild. and have often have been leapfrogged in terms of priority for buildings," said glee dub and sympho­ny orchestra director Dan Stowe. "But now !the University hasl made up for it in a spectacular fashion."

AMERICAN LEAGUE 


Rogers finally loses at Coliseum, A's win 

Infante each hit two-run 
homers off Sabathia (11-1 0) 
and Detroit's bullpen stayed 
busy all night to help the Tigers 
take their second of three in the 
series. 
Sabathia, who as recently as 
Sept. 6 shut out Seattle on five 
hits, failed in key spots to put 
away Tigers hitters and paid 
for it. He allowed five runs and 
six hits in five innings -a 
respectable line but not the one 
he or the Indians need from 
him. 
Boston 11, Tampa Bay 4 
Curt Schilling got his 20th 
win on the eve of Boston's big 
series with the New York 
Yankees. Now he wants much 
more. 
"In a couple of weeks, hope­fully, it will get a lot better," he said after becoming the first 20-game winner in the major leagues with a win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
By that time, he hopes, the Red Sox will have clinched the AL East title. They trail the Yankees by 3 1/2 games, but the teams have six meetings left -three in New York this week­end and three in Boston begin­ning next Friday. 
"This is a great warmup," Johnny Damon said, referring to Boston's 24th victory in 29 games. "This is the time to shine. I think this is the best assembled team in the league and it's time to show it." 
The Red Sox have slashed a deficit of 10 1/2 games on Aug. 15, but the Yankees are coming off back-to-hack shutouts in Kansas City. 
"It's not like it's the first time we've played them," Jason Varitek said. "We have to con­centrate each day on each game. Whatever happens the first day, put it aside." 
Boston leads the season series 8-5, but New York has the best home record in base­ball, 50-21. 
Tampa Bay manager Lou Piniella was too concerned about his own problems to dis­cuss what advantage Schilling (20-6) and Pedro Martinez (16­
6) might give Boston in the playoffs. 
"The Yankees and Red Sox can settle their own affairs," Piniella said. "Good luck to whoever comes out on top." 
On Thursday, Damon and Kevin Millar each homered and drove in four runs, and Boston scored at least nine runs for the fifth time in Schilling's last six 

starts. The right-hander has 
won seven straight starts for 
the first time in his career. He 
has 20 wins in three of the last 
four years and is 11-1 at home 
this season. 

"He has not let us down one 
bit" since being traded by 
Arizona last November, Boston 
manager Terry Francona said. 
"He's been tremendous and he 
will continue to be." 
Baltimore 9, Toronto 5 

Rodrigo Lopez is still trying to 
figure out how to handle 
Vernon Wells. At least he finally 
beat the Toronto Blue Jays. 

Lopez won for the first time 
in seven career starts against 
Toronto and Rafael Palmeiro 
homered, lifting the Baltimore 
Orioles to a victory over the 
Blue Jays. 

Wells hit two home runs off 
Lopez, including a two-run 
homer in the third that landed 
two rows into the fifth deck of 
SkyDome -just the 13th time 
a ball has reached the upper­
most tier. 

"I've never seen somebody 
hit one in the upperdeck. Today 
was my turn," Lopez said. 

"He's a good hitter. I've always had a problem with him. I made a mistake and it landed almost in the hotel." 
Palmeiro's homer in the ninth did not reach the upper deck, but was equally impressive for different reasons. His shot over the right field wall was his 547th homer, leaving him one behind Mike Schmidt for lOth place on the career list. 
Wells is hitting .391 (9-for-23) in his career against Lopez, who is 1-4 with a 8.27 ERA in eight career games against Toronto. 
"They get pretty comfortable against me, but today I got good movement on my fast­ball," Lopez said. 
Minnesota 10, Chicago 1 

Kyle Lohse is making the most of his last chance to sal­vage his season. 
Lohse pitched seven sharp innings, Michael Cuddyer went 3-for-4 with a homer and the Minnesota Twins beat the Chicago White Sox for their ninth straight victory. 
The streaking Twins are quickly closing in on their third consecutive AL Central title. 
They reduced their magic number for clinching the divi­sion to four. 
Lohse (8-11) once appeared to be the odd man out in the Twins' postseason rotation, but 
he's finishing strong with a 3-1 
record in his last six starts. On 
Thursday, he gave up one run, 
four hits and one walk, lasting 
seven innings for only the third 
time since the All-Star break. 

''I've just been putting things 
together, and today I felt like I 
had a pretty good fastball and 
slider," Lohse said. "That's my 
style. It's just been one of those 
years, where one start I'll have 
it, and the next I won't. 
Hopefully, I can put together a 
strong finish and people can 
forget about the rest of the 
year." 

Lohse, competing with Carlos Silva for the third spot in the rotation behind Johan Santana and Brad Hadke, had three 1-2­3 innings and got help from his defense throughout the game. Catcher Pat Borders threw out Willie Harris on a pitchout in the first after Harris led off with a single, and second base­man Augie Ojeda turned a nice double play to end the inning. 
Anaheim 6, Seattle 1 

The way things have gone for the Seattle Mariners this sea­son, perhaps something like this was bound to happen. 
Still, it was simply beyond belief. 
The Anaheim Angels took advantage of two errors by Gold Glove second baseman Bret Boone, scoring four times in the eighth inning en route to a 6-1 win over Seattle on Thursday night. 
"You never know what's going to happen," Seattle starter Jamie Moyer said. "We're find­ing ways to have things happen that no one's ever seen before. We',;e bringing them full cir­cle. 
The Angels remained within 5 1/2 games behind Boston in the AL wild-card race. They trail Oakland by two games in the AL West. 
Anaheim led 2-1 in the eighth and had runners at second and third with one out when Darin Erstad grounded to Boone, who tried to get Adam Kennedy coming home. Kennedy thought he was about to get nabbed. 
Incredibly. the throw hit Erstad's bat -just in front of catcher Dan Wilson. 
"I told Bret we're going to get 100 balls tomorrow and lay a bat at home plate," said Moyer (6-12), who lost his 10th straight decision despite 7 1-3 solid innings. "I told him I'll bet he can't hit it once. He just laughed." 
Associated Press 
OAKLAND, Calif. -Rich Harden and Bobby Crosby had­n't even started high school the last time Kenny Rogers lost at the Coliseum. 
The Athletics' youngest regu­lars were the biggest contribu­tors to Oakland's 5-4 victory over the Texas Rangers on Thursday, with Harden pitching into the seventh inning and Crosby hitting a three-run dou­ble. 
Neither Hogers nor the A's cared much about the left-ban­der's streak of 18 victories and 35 appearances in Oakland without a loss stretching back to Aug. 7, 1994. The playoff race is a bigger concern for both teams-and with a much­needed win, the A's maintained their slim AL West lead. 
"You try to put it aside, but it's always in the back of your mind." said Harden, who had seven strikeouts while becom­ing Oakland's fifth 10-game winner. "It's coming down to the last few series here, and everything is magnified." 
Crosby, who was 14 when Hogers last lost in Oakland, provided a clutch fifth-inning hit that allowed the Athletics to salvage a split of the four-game set. He and Harden (10-6) were teammates at Triple-A Sacramento last summer, but they're thriving in a major league race this fall. 
"It's incredible for a rookie to be in this type of situation," Crosby said. "I'm not even thinking about it. I'm just tak­ing it like it's the middle of the season, a regular old (at-bat)." 

Crosby was unaware of Rogers' decade of dominance at the Coliseum. 
"Sometimes it's better not to be aware of that stuff," he said with a grin. "That can put bad thoughts in your mind." 
The Rangers had several dis­appointments in the finale of the four-game set. In addition to the end of Rogers' streak and a wasted chance to move within three games of the division lead, Texas might have lost Alfonso Soriano with an injury to his left leg. 
Soriano was hurt in an awk­ward headfirst slide while stealing third base in the eighth inning. His left foot got caught under his right leg, and he left the game after consulting with trainers. He'll undergo tests Friday. 
Detroit 6, Cleveland 4 

Slumping in his recliner, C.C. Sabathia had a pained look of disbelief. He struggled for the right words to explain what went wrong. 
None ever came. 

Another bad night and anoth­er bad loss had Cleveland's pitcher searching for answers. 
"I don't know what I'm going to do," Sabathia said. ''I'm lost right now." 
Sabathia's up-and-down sea­son hit a new low point when the left-bander lasted just five innings in a loss to the Detroit Tigers.

NEW ORLEANS -The San Francisco 49ers were almost as relieved as the home team when New Orleans got nothing more than a bit of rain from Hurricane Ivan. 
While the Saints spent the week working out and worrying in San Antonio, where they moved on Tuesday to escape the approaching storm, Niners coach Dennis Erickson and his players were grateful Sunday's game will be safe and dry. 
"It reminds you how impor­tant football is-not very," said Erickson, whose Miami home was destroyed by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. 
Ivan left New Orleans largely unscathed, so the game will go on despite early fears it might be moved to Texas or even post­poned. 
That means the Superdome should be as inhospitable as ever for the 49ers, a favorite target of derision for New Orleans' loyal fans in the long­standing NFC West rivalry. 
"It's always tough for us down there," said 49ers cornerback Jimmy Williams, a Louisiana native who got most of his fami­ly out of town before Ivan approached, "They love the Saints, and they don't love the 49ers. Whether there's a storm or not, there will be fans who don't fike us there." 
The Saints spent the early part of the week tending to fam­ily concerns, sending their loved ones north to Shreveport or west to Texas. But the trip to San Antonio seemed to help the players focus on business after last Sunday's 21-7 home loss to Seattle. 
Even coach Jim Haslett, a notorious control freak, seemed

So the Saints will do everything pos­sible to harass Ken Dorsey, the 49ers' promising second-year quarterback. He's expected to make his first NFL start unless Tim Rattay's separated shoulder heals much more quickly than expected. 
Haslett knows all about Dorsey: Haslett's son, a big fan of the University of Miami's championship-winning quarter­back, has an autographed ball from Dorsey on a shelf at home. 
"I get an earful all the time about how good he is," Haslett said. "He's got a good offensive mind. He's got a good release." 
The 49ers also have a healthy respect for Aaron Brooks, who excelled against San Francisco in past meetings. After facing Atlanta's Michael Vick in their season opener, the 49ers hope they've got a bit of insight into mobile quarterbacks. 
San Francisco limited former defensive coordinator Jim Mora's Falcons to 227 total yards in an encouraging start for its talented defense. The 49ers' linebackers are the

of the 49ers' schemes. The former star line­backer is a big fan of All-Pro Julian Peterson, who lined up everywhere from the secondary to the defensive line against Atlanta. 
"He's 100 miles per hour," Haslett said. "He's full speed. He's a heck of a pass-rusher. He's tough and physical. To me, that is a guy on defense you have to account for all of the time." 
After watching the Falcons' success with numerous blitzes against San Francisco's mediocre offensive line, the Saints are expected to do the same. Haslett and his staff for­mulated the game plan in a marathon 17-hour workday before heading to San Antonio. 
The Texas trip could have been a big distraction. but McAllister believes it provided a breather after the opening loss and several days of worry over Ivan. In fact, once McAllister got his loved ones out of town, he had no concerns about his house and belongings.

NEW YORK -No shots, no saves, no goals. The National Hockey League locked out its players Thursday, threatening to keep the sport off the ice for the entire 2004-05 sea­son and perhaps beyond in an effort by management to gain massive economic change. 
After the long-expected decision was approved unanimously Wednesday by NHL owners, commis­sioner Gary Bettman repeatedly belittled the union's bargaining posi­tion, talked about the pos.­
sibility the confrontation could extend into the 2005­06 season and said the conflict has jeopardized the NHL's participation in the 2006 Winter Olympics. 
"When we ultimately make the deal that has to be made, we will then see whether or not there is time for a season or some semblance of a season," he said. "If there is, great, and if there isn't, then we'll deal with the next season when it comes along." 
Bettman claimed teams had combined to lose more than $1.8 billion over 10 years, and said manage­ment will not agree to a labor deal that doesn't include a defined relation­ship between revenue and salaries. 

"Until he gets off the salary-cap issue, there's not a chance for us to get an agreement," union head Bob Goodenow said in Toronto, adding that play­ers "are not prepared to entertain a salary cap in any way, shape, measure or form." 
Far apart on both philos­ophy and finances, the sides haven't bargained since last Thursday and say they are entrenched for the long run, echoing words of baseball players and owners at the start of their disastrous 7 112 ­month labor war of 1994­95. 
There is almost no chance the season will start as scheduled on Oct. 13, and Bettman told teams to release their are­nas for other events· for the next 30 days. Bettman said the season can't extend past June, and the lockout threatens to wipe out the Stanley Cup final for the first time since 1919, when the series between Montreal and Seattle was stopped after five games due a Spanish influenza epidemic. 
IN BRIEF 'Monday Night Football' to 
use five-second delay 
NEW YORK -"Monday Night Football" will be broadcast on a five­second delay for the rest of the sea­son, a reaction to the furor caused by last season's Super Bowl halftime show. 
The move is just a precaution, an ABC spokesman said. 
At halftime of New England's win over Carolina in the Super Bowl on Feb. 3, Justin Timberlake ripped off part of Janet Jackson's brassiere, a wardrobe "malfunction" that exposed her right breast to a TV audience of some 90 million. The Super Bowl was broadcast on CBS. 
A pre-game concert before the sea­son opener between New England on Indianapolis was broadcast with a 1 0-second delay on ABC to prevent a repeat of the Super Bowl embarrass­ment. 
After the Super Bowl, the Federal Communications Commission received more than 500,000 com­plaints about the broadcast. 
The commission is reportedly con­sidering a fine of $550,000 against CBS for violating broadcast decency standards. Oakland rookie Gall~ry starts first game at right tackle 
ALAMEDA, Calif. Robert Gallery's future is certain to be at left tackle, but for the time being he'll have to settle for playing the right side for the Oakland Raiders. 
Gallery, the second overall pick in the NFL draft, will make his first start Sunday against Buffalo. 
He replaces third-year player Langston Walker, the right tackle in Oakland's season-opening loss to Pittsburgh. 
"It's what I came here to do," Gallery said. ''I'm glad they decided what they're going to do. Now I'm ready to play. I was going to be ready to play if I was starting or not, but now I know I can go out and play." 
The decision to start Gallery at right tackle ends, at least temporari­ly, the Raiders' experiment with the rookie. Drafted to play left tackle, Gallery worked at both tackle and guard during the preseason but failed to supplant starters Barry Sims and Frank Middleton. Soriano hurts leg in headfirst 

slide 
OAKLAND. Calif. -Texas Rangers star Alfonso Soriano left Thursday's game against Oakland in the eighth 
·inning after injuring his left leg on a headfirst slide, putting the rest of his season in doubt. 
The All-Star second baseman will have an MRI exam Friday. 
"It doesn't look very good," manag­er Buck Showalter said after Texas' 5-4 loss to the Athletics. "But we won't comment until the MRI." 
Soriano was hurt while stealing third base. He easily beat the throw, but appeared to get his left foot caught under his right leg as he reached out for the bag. 
Soriano felt pain behind his left knee. "I don't know what happened," he said. "Right now, I can't feel the ten­
. don behind the knee. About three or four feet before I got to the base, I started my slide, and I felt some­thing."

NATIONAL LEAGUE 

Bonds stuck on 699, Giants shutout Brewers 

Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE -Not in the city where Aaron played, he won't. But get ready, kayakers: Barry Bonds will get the chance to hit another historic homer at home. 
The San Francisco slugger remained one shot shy of join­ing Babe Huth and Hank Aaron in the 700-homer club Thursday. but did go 3-for-3 with a walk in the Giants' 4-0 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. 
"I still have a lot of baseball left," Bonds said. "It will come eventually." 
And chances are it will come at SBC Park. where the Giants begin a nine-game homestand Friday night against the San Diego Padres. his favorite long­ball victims. 
lie has 78 homers off the Padres. more than any other opponent. including two off right-hander Jake Peavy. whom he'll face first. 
Bonds' three line-drive hits Thursday backed rookie Brad Hennessey (2-2). who allowed two hits over seven spectacular innings as the Giants remained a half-game ahead of the Chicago Cubs in the NL wild­card race. 
Bonds certainly got his chance to reach the milestone in Milwaukee, where Aaron started and ended his career on the way to a record 755 home runs. 
Bonds took 21 swings in the three-game sweep during the Giants' only trip to Miller Park this season, going 3-for-9 with four walks -one intentional. lie hit an RBI double and two singles in the final game. 
"They pitched to him," Giants manager Felipe Alou said. "He hit the ball hard, but they kept the ball down. He can do it at home now." 
Bonds has long saved his most historic homers for home. where they often splash into McCovey Cove in San Francisco Bay. 
He hit career homer No. 660 -to tie godfather Willie Mays -and No. 661 at home off the Brewers earlier this season. He also hit his SOOth in San Francisco in 2001, and later that season broke Mark McGwire's season record by hit­ting Nos. 71-73 at home the final weekend of the season. 
After hitting his 699th homer Sunday in Arizona, Bonds was challenged by the Brewers, who didn't groove many pitches. He saw 56 pitches in Milwaukee, 23 of them strikes. including two called. 
"I swung at more pitches. I took more chances," Bonds said. "Today it was hits. hits, hits and that's it." 
Bonds called it a successful series despite not homering. 
"That's all that matters," Bonds said after the Giants won their fifth straight. "That's the key. We've got to keep winning. We're not playing for 700 home runs. We're playing to win." 
Arizona 8, Colorado 5 
PIIOENIX -The Arizona Diamondbacks won their third straight game Thursday, their first such streak in over three months. 
Danny Bautista drove in a run with his second double of the game in the seventh inning and scored on Alex Cintron's sacri­fice fly. lifting the Diamondbacks to an 8-5 victory over the Colorado Rockies. 

Rookie Chad Tracy added a two-run homer in the eighth off Chin-Hui Tsao to help the Diamondbacks rally from an early 4-0 deficit and win three straight for the first time since sweeping San Francisco from June 1-3. 
"That shows the character of the guys on the team," Tracy said. "None of these guys have ever given up during a game, and that's why they're here ­because we've always been competitors." 
Chad Durbin earned the win despite walking three in his only inning of work. With the game tied at 4, Durbin (1-0) walked Todd Helton and Jeromy Burnitz before giving up a two­out RBI single to Garrett Atkins, who drove in three runs. 
Mike Koplove worked a score­less eighth, and Mike Fetters earned his first save of the sea­son. the lOOth of his career. New York 9, Atlanta 4 
NEW YORK-The New York Mets heard all about highly touted Jose Capellan and his hard fastballs, so they expected to see some right away. 
They made sure the Atlanta Braves' rookie wasn't around to throw any more of them after the first inning. 
Richard Hidalgo and Todd Zeile hit back-to-hack homers in New York's seven-run open­ing inning against Capellan. leading the Mets to a 9-4 victory Thursday night. 
"It was a good feeling," Hidalgo said. "He threw a lot of fastballs and threw them hard. but everybody hit them." 
Mike Cameron had three hits and drove in two runs for the Mets, who took three of five against the Braves. A day after manager Art Howe was fired, effective at the end of the sea­son. New York won its first series since taking two of three at Colorado on Aug. 17-19. 
"That was a great first inning and we won a series. so that's good," Howe said. 
Steve Trachsel (11-13) allowed four runs -two earned -and eight hits in six­plus innings to win for the first time since beating Houston on Aug. 10. He had lost five straight decisions and was win­less in his last six starts. 
"It was very nice because I had runs to work with," Trachsel said. "It gives you room to just trust in your pitch­es." 
The Braves knocked Trachsel out in the seventh when Eddie Perez, Charles Thomas and Mark DeRosa all singled to load the bases. 
"When you play the Braves, I don't care if you have a 15-run lead -they're going to find a way to get the tying run to the plate." Howe said. 
Heath Bell came in and got Wilson Betemit to ground to first for the first out, but Perez scored to make it 8-4. Bell struck out Marcus Giles before

walking Wise to load the bases. Pinch-hitter Julio Franco struck out swinging to end the inning. 
Florida 4, Montreal 3 
MIAMI -Dontrelle Willis knew there wasn't much room for error against Livan Hernandez. 
The Montreal right-hander came into Thursday night's game with an 8-3 record against the Marlins and had wins in his last two starts. 
This time Florida finally got to Hernandez, overcoming a 3-0 deficit and defeating the Expos 4-3. Willis won for the first time in five starts. 
"I knew going against Livan that he isn't going to give up a lot," Willis said. "I kept us in the game and put the pressure back on him. We need every single game we can win." 
Juan Encarnacion hit a two­run triple to tie the game in the fifth, and Jeff Conine drove in the go-ahead run with a sixth­inning single. The Marlins earned their 25th comeback victory and remained 3 1/2 games behind San Francisco in the NL wild-card race. 
Hernandez (1 0-14) took the loss despite pitching his major league-leading eighth complete game. He gave up eight hits and five walks. striking out three. Tony Batista hit his 28th homer for the Expos. 
Willis (10-9) allowed three runs and five hits in seven innings. He was lifted for a pinch-runner after his leadoff single in the seventh. 
Guillermo Mota worked a scoreless eighth, and Armando Benitez got three outs for his 42nd save in 45 opportunities. 
"This game showed what this team is made of," Marlins man­ager Jack McKeon said. "We were down 3-0 but we didn't quit and bounced back." 
Florida took a 4-3 lead in the sixth when Conine's one-out single drove in Paul Lo Duca from second. Lo Duca stumbled slightly rounding third but evaded catcher Brian Schneider's tag and touched home plate with his left hand. 
The Marlins tied the score at 3 in the fifth. Hernandez walked Conine to open the inning, then gave up a single to Damion Easley. Encarnacion followed with a two-run triple and scored on a sacrifice fly by Alex Gonzalez. 
"Encarnacion has come through with some clutch hits for us the last three weeks" McKeon said. "He's also done a great job with his glove." Chicago 5, Cincinnati 4 
CINCINNATI-The Cubs were hardly concerned when Kerry Wood let the lead slip away in one wild inning. 
Why fret when Aramis Ramirez was going to bat again? 
The third baseman homered three times for all of Chicago's runs Thursday, and the Cubs kept pace in the playoff race with a 5-4 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. 



Barry Bonds flies out Wednesday night against the Brewers. He Is currently third all-time with 699llome runs. 
Without Ramirez, Chicago would have lost precious ground in the wild-card chase. The homer binge kept the Cubs a half-game back of San Francisco and revived them at the start of their final regular­season road trip -four cities, 12 games. 
"One-man wrecking crew," Reds starter Josh Hancock mar­veled. 'If I had the kitchen sink in my back pocket, I would have thrown it up there and he prob­ably would have hit it." 
That's how helpless he made them feel. 
Ramirez hit a two-run homer and a solo shot off Hancock, then put the Cubs ahead in the seventh with a two-out. two-run drive off Ryan Wagner (3-2) for his second three-homer game of the season. Ramirez also hit three against Philadelphia on July 30. 
He is the first player to have two three-homer games in a season since 2001, when Sammy Sosa had three. Barry Bonds, Jeromy Burnitz and Carlos Delgado also did it twice that year. 
Twelve major leaguers have hit three homers in a game this season. 
"We know what he can do," Cubs manager Dusty Baker said. "We got six hits and he got four of them, dr-ove in all the runs. This is what you need. You need somebody like that ­or somebodies -in different games to put the whole team on his back and carry it. which he did." 
Houston 8, St. Louis 3 · 
ST. LOUIS -Suddenly. the St. Louis Cardinals can't do any­thing right. 
Jeff Kent had two doubles and four RBis. and the slumping Cardinals committed a season­high four errors to help the Houston Astros snap Jason Marquis' 11-game winning streak with an 8-3 victory on Thursday night. 
"You don't want to sugarcoat it," manager Tony La Russ a said. "Bad ballgame. Good for them, bad for us." 
The Astros took two of three from the NL Central leaders. staying two games behind the Giants in the wild-card race and keeping the Cardinals' magic number for clinching the divi­sion at four. 
"The bottom line is we still have to win," Astros manager Phil Garner said. "They've made a mockery of the division race and to take two of three is very important." 
LaRussa said he wouldn't use this game as a motivational tool. 
"This is not TV or the movies," LaRussa said.

By STEVE COYER Sports Writer 
In their first large race of the year, the men's and women's cross country teams will com­pete today in the 25th annllal National Catholic Invitatio1al held at Notre Dame. 
The Irish runners ha.ve enjoyed great success at 1.he invitational over the years with a total of 20 individual titles and 26 team victories. In 20J3, both Notre Dame squa.ds walked away with team titles. 
The Catholic Invitational includes schools from across the nation with 34 teams com­peting in the women's field a.nd 32 on the men's side. However, only 10 of the teams have Division I status. 
"We will not face the type of competition we expect do·Nn the road," women's head coHch

Although the Irish have more important meets on their upcoming schedule, the team will put forth a complete effort. 
"With our schedule we don't race that often," Connelly said. "So when we have a meet we're going to compete."

MIAA matchup to test Belles 
Saint Mary's faces Adrian today in a conference game 
By JUSTIN STETZ Sports Writer 
This Saturday the Belles will play their first confer­ence game against Adrian College, which is currently in fourth place in the MIAA. 
The Bulldogs come to Saint Mary's with a record of 2-1 in the conference and 6-7 overall. The Belles are 1-4 in the league and 1-6 on the year.

been a force on defense, recording 92 digs. Elise Rupright along with Shelly Bender have consis­tently performed well on offense, leading the way for the Belles' scoring attack. 
The Belles schedule is com­prised of mostly conference opponents now that it is just about halfway complete. Even with the slow start, Saint Mary's still has the ability to gain ground and secure a berth in the league tournament, which begins in early November. 
After Saint Mary's faces the Bulldogs, the Belles next game will be played at the University of Chicago on Wednesday evening. Saint Mary's dropped its first scrimmage of the year to the Maroons. This time around, the Belles will be looking to avenge the loss now that it is the regular season. 
The Adrian game is set for 4 p.m.

Stonn awaits LSU, Auburn 
Associated Press 

AUBURN, Ala. -Aubu'nl and LSU have played several nickname games in recent years: The Fire Game. The Interception Game. The Cigar Game. 
The latest entry might be The Hurricane Game. 
Saturday's high-stakes matchup between No. 14 Auburn and No. 5 LSU is in limbo because of Hurricane Ivan. The storm plowed into Alabama and Louisiana and left concerns about safety, travel plans and available sup­port personnel. 
Auburn officials will likely decide Friday morning whether to reschedule the afternoon game. 
Hurricane Ivan already has forced the postponement of two Top 25 games. No. 10 California was scheduled to play at Southern Mississippi on Thursday night and No. 24 Louisville was slated to play Tulane at the Superdome in New Orleans on Saturday. 
Auburn-LSU is one of two heavyweight contests in the Southeastern Conference on Saturday. No. 11 Florida is at No. 13 Tennessee, with the winner clearing a major hur­dle toward an Eastern division title. 
In other Top 25 action on Saturday. No. 1 Southern California is at BYU: No. 2 Oklahoma plays host to Oregon; and No. 3 Georgia faces Marshall, which gave Ohio State a scare last week. The ninth-ranked Buckeyes are at North Carolina State. 
No. 4 Miami gets a bit of a break after its big win over Florida State by hosting Louisiana Tech. while the eighth-ranked Seminoles also step down in competition with a home game against UAB. 
No. 7 West Virginia looks to break a four-game losing streak to No. 21 Maryland in a Big East vs. Atlantic Coast Conference matchup. 
Elsewhere, No. 12 Virginia hosts Akron; No. 15 Utah is at Utah State; No. 16 Iowa visits Arizona State; No. 17 Michigan plays host to San Diego State; and No. 19 Fresno State, com­ing off an impressive win, plays Portland State. 
Two ranked Big Ten teams face potentially tricky road games with No. 20 Wisconsin at Arizona and No. 22 Minnesota visiting Colorado State. 
No. 23 Boise State is at UTEP and No. 25 Memphis, playing its first game as a ranked team, is at Arkansas State. 
As usual, the Auburn-LSU rivalry combines a dramatic story line with SEC title impli­cations. The two Tigers are the favorites to win the West. 
"They compete hard against us and that's what makes a rivalry great," LSU defensive end Marcus Spears said. "No matter what the situation is when we play each other we want to play our best game.

In 1994, Auburn returned three of its five fourth-quarter interceptions for touchdowns to rally for a 30-26 win. 
In 1996, the Auburn Sports Arena burned just outside Jordan-Hare Stadium, smoke billowing above the bleachers. LSU won 19-15 as Auburn missed three field goals and an extra point. 
In 1999, Auburn punctuated a 41-7 win at Baton Rouge with coach Tommy Tuberville and his players firing up victo­ry cigars on the game. Before the game, they danced on the eye of the tiger at midfield. 
Since 1998, the average margin of victory has been

No har111 for officials 

Two men convicted in bribery scandal get neither jail, fine 
Associated Press 

SALT LAKE CITY -The only two men convicted in the Salt Lake City Olympic bribery scandal were let off without penalty at their sentencings Thursday. Both cooperated with prosecutors in an unsuc­cessful attempt to bust two key officials in the city's bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
Salt Lake businessman David Simmons and former 
U.S. Olympic official Alfredo La Mont _ who have been on probation since pleading guilty in 1999 received no jail time, no fines and no proba­tion. · 
The two had been expected to receive leniency in return for their testimony against the two key figures in the case, who ended up being acquitted last December by a judge halfway through their trial. 
Tom Welch and Dave Johnson had been accused of plying International Olympic Committee members with $1 million in cash, gifts. medical care and other favors to help bring the 2002 Olympics to Salt Lake City. 
Simmons, a telecommunica­tions executive, hired the son of a former IOC member from South Korea and was secretly reimbursed by Salt Lake City Olympic boosters. He pleaded guilty to tax fraud for disguis­ing those payments. 
"I received no personal ben­efit from my actions, but was motivated by my desire to assist the bid committee," he said. "What I did was wrong." 
Outside court, Simmons said he wasn't complaining that he got a misdemeanor conviction while the bid leaders were convicted of nothing. 
"No regrets," Simmons said. "I tried to take full responsi­bility from day one haven't deviated from that." 
La Mont was an internation­al relations director for the 
U.S. Olympic Committee who moonlighted as a Salt Lake bid consultant when the city was trying to persuade the IOC to select the city for the games. lie pleaded guilty to tax evasion and conspiracy to evade taxes. 
La Mont made "two really stupid decisions" _ taking a consulting job that conflicted with his USOC duties and not paying taxes on the income. said Lee Forman, his lawyer. 
"The first decision cost him his job; the second made him a felon." he said. 
Both men have since paid the evaded taxes, Justice Department attorney Richard Wiedis said Thursday. 
Wiedis said the Justice Department was unable to convict the main players in the scandal because "there were many forces that wanted to bury the facts of Olympic corruption." 
lie said the Salt Lake Organizing Committee was too willing to pay Welch and Johnson's legal defense, and 
· that its trustees offered testi­mony at trial that undermined the federal case. La Mont had faced up to a year in prison. 
Magistrate David Nuffer said he had no choice but to assess Simmons $25 in court fees. La Mont was assessed $200.

on the defensive line are some Sigfried players to watch. Offensive lineman Kevin Phipps will provide bulk upfront for the Hamblers. 
"lie is a force to be reck­oned with," Hughes said. 
On the Juggs side, Joe McCarthy, Jesse Greenwood and Mike Peters will lead the way. Along with those three, are two third-year returnees who have been called "unsung heroes" by their captain. They arc offensive line members Patrick Varley and Jason Creek. 
Both halls arc pumped and prepared for the game this Sunday. It should be a great battle between these two rivals. 
St. Edward's vs. Zahm 
Both St. Edwards and Zahm would like to get their season off to a good start, as last year they were looking up at Siegfried and Knott at the top of the Blue League standings. St. Edward's and Zahm both feel as if they have improved immensely this year, and are ready to give the Ramblers and Juggernauts a run for their money this season. 
Defense should be the strength of the Stedsmcn this year. 
"We have a good overall team defense," Stedsmen Matt Webber said. 
Nick Stober and Mike Giampa, both returning four­year starters, will be playing on both sides of the ball this Sunday. 

"Those two guys are the anchor of our team," Webber _said. 
Also be on the lookout for captain Joe Pomeranke, who is a leader for the Stedsmcn. 
As for Zahm, captain Kyle Jones feels that the Habid Bats will be much improved this year. "We seem to have a lot of freshmen and seniors on the team this year, but we still expect to be a lot better than before," Jones said. The Habid Bats have been knocked out of the playoffs in the first round three years in a row.

Remen believes that the offensive and defensive lines are the strengths of his team. The Dawgs return six key starters along the lines. including senior standouts Dan O'Connor and Pat Higgins. 
Outside of excellent line play, Alumni will rely on the leadership and expe­rience of several seasoned veterans. Remen, a senior cornerback, and sopho­more linebacker Matt Augustine will anchor a stingy Alumni defensive unit. 
On the other side of the ball, the Dawgs will rely on several fresh faces at key skill positions. Freshman quarterback Brent Locey will lead Alumni's attack. 
"Locey is a real big kid with great potential," Remen said. 
Freshman wideout 
Willie D. Williams and freshman running back Bret Shapot will join forces with Locey to form a potent offensive threat for the Dawgs. 
Slowing down this Alumni offense will be a focal point for Keough. 
"The big key to the game is going to be our defense," Kusper said. "If we can make them throw the ball1 we feel we will have a real good chance." 
Kusper is not as concerned with Keough's offense. and for good reason. Kusper, Degen. and returning wide receiver Nick Dobbertin lead an expe­rienced and talented Kangaroo attack that could provide problems for the Alumni defense. 
As the season rapidly approaches, both squads are concentrating on one goal ­the chance to play for the championship in Notre Dame Stadium. 
"We are looking to make the playoffs and hopefully get a game in the stadium," Degen said. Remen also cited a sin­gle objective for Alumni this season -to get to the cham­pionship. 
With both teams clearly focused and confident. the meeting between Alumni and Keough should make for quite a battle. Fisher vs. Sorln 
A new year of Notre Dame interhall football kicks off this Sunday. with Fisher taking on Sorin at 1 p.m. at Riehle field. 


The Green Wave will look to avenge last year's loss to the Otters in a closely contested game that came down to one kick -a game winning field goal as time expired. The 3-0 final score truly reflected the struggles that each offense had against two very tough defenses. 
Statistically speaking, Fisher dominated last year's game, but untimely intercep­tions essentially led to Sorin's final and decisive possession. 
Several Sorin freshmen stepped up then, and they will look to do so again after a year's experience under their belts. 
Both teams will likely try and get the offenses going early. while trying to avoid the mistakes and m isscd opportunities that plagued each during the last meeting. 
Fisher captain Jerremy Moreno and returning Sorin captain Collin O'Keefe will try to lead his respective team to victory in this opener.

Honsheim. whose team went 3-0-1 and beat Zahm in the opening round of the playoffs last year. said. "We want to make a statement this year." 
As for the Mob, they come into this fall looking to improve on last season's 1-3 record. 
"Our goal this year is to win at least two games and get into the playoffs, which O'Neill's never done before," Mob captain Michael Milligan said. 
In order to start their resur­gence, however. O'Neill will have to deal with a Morrissey squad that is expected to be as potent offensively as it is stingy defensively. 
The Manorites return seven starters from a defense that didn't allow a point until their eIeventh quarter of football last year, although they did lose middle linebacker Brian Dinsmore to graduation. 
Nevertheless, Ronsheim is optimistic. 
"Our defense has been the strongest part of the team since I've been here," he said. "Our defense carries us. We hope it can cause turnovers and put our offense in a strong position." 
Offensively, last year's start­ing quarterback, Marty Mooney now plays for the 
Notre Dame football team, but 2002 starter Pete Sprietzer returns from a semester studying in France to lead the Manorite offense. Sprietzer's who can play where yet," Milligan said. 
Offensively, O'Neill is expected to be conservative and try to control the clock with halfback Bradon Turner and fullback Brian Stein. 
"We're going to try to estab­lish the run," Milligan said, "If that works. we'll open things up and try a few pass­
es." Keough vs. Alumni 
A huge loss is never easy to forget. Keough learned this the hard way last season after being crushed by Alumni 27-0 last year. 
With the teams set to butt heads again in Sunday after­noon's 2 p.m. season opener. the Kangaroos will take the field with one thing on their mind -revenge. 
"We brought [last year's loss] up to our players," Keough captain and quarter­back Brian Kusper said. "They know that that can't happen again. We had more intense practices this week because of that. It's our turn this year." 
The Kangaroos feel that the key to securing this revenge on Sunday will lie in the trenches. Keough wants to dominate the line of scrim­mage on both ends of the ball. 
"If we can control the line, 
we can control the game," senior fullback Dan Degen said. 
This might be easier said than done. Alumni captain AJ

Traditionally, the Spartans have notched wins again >t the Irish. holding the advantage in the series record 7-3. 
On Saturday, Notre Dame was scheduled to face 1'1/o. 2 USC. University officials announced Thursday th~.t the Trojans were withdrawing from this weekend's invita­tional due to "safety i1:sues and travel difficulties as a result of the severe weather conditions in the Southeast caused by Hurricane Ivan and the upcoming Hurricane Jeanne." 
Host South Carolina (5-2) will bring a great presence to the court on Sunday when they meet the Irish. Competing in front of a home crowd, the Gamecocks are playing for pride and are expected to impress. Wake Forest (3-1) and Duke (3-0) were the only teams to beat the Gamecocks this season. Last year, South Carolina bested No. 15 Notre Dame last season in four close matches, 30-26, 30-27, 24-30, 31-29. 

This whirlwind weekend should be an opportunity for Notre Dame to prove what a solid and capable team they are. 
At the Cal Poly Invitational last weekend, the Irish cap­tured the championship title over Fresno State, Cal Poly, and Sacramento State. Statistically, the Irish were at their best this season, record­ing 59 kills -almost 20 per game -and registering a .311 hitting percentage. 
Junior middle blocker Lauren Brewster earned the title of tournament MVP after registering 3.82 kills per game and recording a 3.72 hitting percentage. She also con­tributed 28 digs, 18 blocks, and four aces during the two matches. 
Her efforts in the invitation­al also demonstrated to Big East officials that she was deserving of her fourth Big East player of the week honor. Last week, Brewster tallied three double-doubles in four matches last week, totaling 60 kills on a .336 hitting percent­age. She also averaged 1.62 blocks and 2.56 digs per game. 
Junior outside hitter Lauren Kelbley was also named to the Cal Poly All-Tournament team after notching 4.00 kills per game and seven service aces. 
With talented individuals like Brewster and Kelbley leading the team, the Irish should be a formidable force this weekend.

University. The three-day event will kick off Friday at the Lost Dunes Country Club in Bridgman, Mich., before returning to the Warren Golf course on campus for the 36 holes Saturday and Sunday. 
Serving a-s host should serve as a great advantage for the Irish. Surprisingly, Notre Dame will likely have a much more pronounced advantage at Lost Dunes, where they have played a few times, than at Warren, where they play every day. 
"At Lost Dunes, the diffi­culty lies in the greens, and it takes a lot of time to figure out the greens," Irish assis­tant coach Chris Whitten said. "Our advantage at Warren should be minimal." 
Whitten hopes for good things to come from going up against such strong com­petition this early in the sea­son, especially coming off N6tre Dame's trip to the NCAA Regionals last season. 
Rodgers and Mike King. King and Sigsbee will be competing in their first tournament as part of the Irish scoring lineup this sea­son, after competing as indi­viduals at an event hosted by Bowling Green last weekend. 
Whitten is excited about the progress the team has already shown this season. 
"Everyone is working on the right things," he said. 
Also, five more members of the Irish squad will com­pete in the tournament as individuals. Seniors Steve Colinitis and KC Wiseman will lead the group, joined by juniors Tommy Balderston, Mark Baldwin and Daniel Klauer. 
Irish coach John Jasinski said Thursday night that it was too early to tell if Gustafson will be out for the season.

"You aim to win every game, and then after that. you've just got to get on with in," Clark said. "Once you start talking a score ­what you think it's going to be ­that's when you start getting into problems." 
Part of that approach encom­passes a focus more on the Irish style of play than what the I Ioyas will be trying to do Saturday night. 
"We've got to concentrate and play our game," Clark said. "You've got to be aware of the other tnam -that's key -but at the same time you've got to make sure you don't forget to play your game. That's going to be very important." 
The Irish suffered their first loss of the young season Wednesday night in Bloomington, dropping a 2-0 decision to soccer powerhouse No. 1 Indiana (5-0-0). 
"I was disappointed with the final outcome, but there were a lot of positives," Clark said. "It was a tough game [with] both tnams working very hard." 
Notre Dame hung tough with the nation's top squad, nearly matching the Hoosiers in total shots -Indiana registered ten while the Irish drilled nine­and out-cornering them six to one. 
However, shots and corner kicks don't factor into the final score. 
"Soccer is a funny game­there's really only one statistic that counts and that's goals," Clark said. "It's disappointing, but we've actually scored more goals at this point in the season than we did last year." 
Clark points to the youth up front and undefined roles as pos­sible explanations for N.otre Dame's inability to capitalize on quality scoring changes thus far this year. 
"We made a decent amount of chances that we didn't convert," Clark said. "It's a young team and guys are still just fighting out exactly where they all fit in." 
After the Irish nearly took an early lead on a ninth minute run by defender Jack Stewart, Indiana forward Jacob Peterson put the Hoosiers on the board eight minutes, fifteen seconds into the second half. 
Uncorking a shot just inside the box, Peterson's ball deflected off Stewart's foot and into the net, staking Indiana to a 1-0 lead. 
The Irish refused to give in, nearly converting a pair of scor­ing opportunities before Indiana took advantage of Notre Dame's aggressive play and effectively put the game out of reach on a fast-break goal by midfielder Brian Plotkin. 
The 2-0 Hoosier shutout marked the fifth consecutive time that a Notre Dame/Indiana con-. test has ended with at least one team faj}jng to score. 
The Irish downed tile I Ioosiers 1-0 at Alumni Field last season on an overtime goal by defender Kevin Goldthwaite. 
Following the Georgetown con­test, the Irish travel to Morgantown, W. Va., next Thursday to face West Virginia.

for those teams that we take for granted a little bit," she said. "A big team like UConn is always a great team against us ... [but) we haven't played [Syracuse] in a long time so you tend to forget about teams like that." 
This will be the first game Notre Dame has played with the distinction as the top­ranked team in the country. Tancredi feels that now opposing teams have even more motivation when they play the Irish. 
"It doesn't matter what number we are, we always seem to have good competi­tion against us," Tancredi said, "[But] it's always going to be a hard game, each game we play [ranked No. 
1]." . 
Despite the challenges of playing for a targeted team, Tancredi was named the Big East Defensive Player of the Week for the second consecu­tive week. However, she attributes her own accolades to a tougher mentality of team's defense as a whole. 
"Our [team has] dedication to not allowing teams to hav­ing any shots on goal, taking that seriously, taking it to heart when we actually get scored on," she said. 
The Irish have more good news as well. After a rash of injuries, slowly but surely, the team is getting healthier. Irish forward Candace Chapman, who missed all of the 2003

I can. You just have to work harder every minute that you get." 
Notre Dame will also see the return of a promising freshman, Jannica Tjeder, who has also been sidelined with an injury for the better part of this season. Waldrum, for one, is anxious to have her back on the field. 
"We're going to try and get her some time this weekend. She looked good in training this week," he said. "I don't think she's completely healthy, but she's close." 
Goalkeeper Erika Bohn will likely return to the Irish net this weekend as well. Waldrum started freshman Lauren Karas in last week's game against Arizona State. and is leaving his options open for the coming weekend. 

"We'll probably start Erika on Friday and then just see how it goes," Waldrum said. "It's really easy to put young players in games that don't mean a lot, but we wanted to see her in a meaningful game. I think the competition has been very close. I don't know if we'll split games or split halves but the games will dictate that."

The Spartans appeared to be the perfect medicine for a beaten-down Irish tnarn. 
But holding true to recent history, the Irish couldn't solve the Michigan State mystery, losing 22-16 at home in a game no one thought the Irish should lose. 
for some 

unexplain­able reason, the Spartans always seem to play their best game against the Irish. 
Holiday said the close­ness of the games stays in the back or your mind. Kyle Budinscak can't put his l'inger on it. 
But Brandon Hoyte "couldn't care less" about the past-whether it's the losses to the Spartans or last week's win over Michigan.

"It's going to be their 2004 team against our 2004 team. It simply will eome down to this: the team that plays the best will win." 
That's the attitude this team needs to take. 
The Irish did it last week against the Wolverines. They were the best team on the field and didn't focus too much on the opening-week loss. 
Now they have the chance to continue their season turnaround. 
Once again, that game comes against Michigan State. 
Once again, the Spartans will have a major impact on which way this season heads.

Darius Walker wears the number 3 and lifts the hopes of the Irish faithful

lie did not request the hype. lie didn't <wen want it. But when Darim; Walker got to Notre Dame, he received a jersey with the number three -and, some would say, the expectations that r;une with it. 
"I guess it worked out for me," Walker said. 
The situation is too much of<L coin­cidence. The true freshman from Georgia jumped from promising nuuit to cdebrity status after ignit­ing the Irish running game n last week's 28-20 upset of No. 8 Michigan, wa'>ting no time in display­ing tho big-game potential of former number three wearers Joe Montana 1u1d Hkk Mimr.

"I li~lt all along at some poi 11t this year he would have some impact on a f(KJtball g<Uille," head mach 'l'yrone Willingham said.

The number three 
Even sub-par Notre Dame CUllS­the ones who think Rocket Ismail W<l'> the name of a NASA spar~~ shut­tle -know the significance of the number three. Montana, Mirur and Hon Pow!us are only some of thn leg­rmdary Irish alums to sport tim sym­bol. l'laymaker Arnaz Battle graduat­ed in the spring of 2003 and no one stepped up to CNry the torch. 
Then Walker arrived in :'iouth Bend. obliviou<; to the number'~ avail­ability. but it did not matter. l11e jer­sey found him. 
"I actually wanted a singlE~ digit number," Walker said. "I was 1\o. 7 in high sch(KJI and that was some bing I W<l'> pushing to get. Carlyle lloliday decided to keep the number and thrne W<l'> tho only single digit num­ber loll."

"I had the opportunity lin pr.J.etice] to watch hi'> style, watch his ability to see things, and just make yardage out ofthings that didn't seem tu have much yardage," Willingham said.

But tl1e parallels between W. ~ker's timely Saturday performance and those of p<l'it great number three's are eerily similar.

game during his freshman year of high school. Walker's Buford High School went on to win the Georgia M state title in his final three sea­son'>, dominating opponents by wide margin<;. And though Walker was an integral part of the offense, the team didn't need to heap all of the respon­sibility oniheir star back's shoulders. 
"It was very seldom Ito carry the ball 30 times in high school]," Walker said. "So the [Michigan] game was very rough." 
Walker carried the ball 31 times again<;t tl1e Wolverines. He hit open holes and gained solid yardage. solid especially for a team that had rushed 22 times for just 11 yards in the pre­vious weekend's 20-17loss to BYU. 
"He loves playing the big game," running backs coach Buzz Preston said. "He's hungry to do great things." 
Walker was able to score a remrd 46 touchdowns in high school, break­ing the Georgia state rushing remrd of 45 held by former NFL running back Herschel Walker-no relation. 
But Darius Walker's familiarity with the endzone did not show when he commented on the two he put past the Michigan defense Saturday. 
"It was my first [two] college touch­down[sl, so it was a little sentimental for me," he said. "I couldn't believe that I wa<; out there at first, and then to score a touchdown made it a little crazy for me." 
Walker became the first freshman to rush for two touchdowns since quarterback Matt LoVecchio did in a November 2000 win over Southern California. He was also the first fresh­man running back to notch a pair of scores since Autry Denson scored twice in a 44-14 Notre Dame win over Air Force on Nov. 18, 1995. 
All of the statistics, all of the prai'i!l, and what does Walker's coach have to say? 
"It was just about what I expected to see from hinll," Willingham said. 
Willingham saw Walker in practice and felt eonfident in the ability of hi'i recruit, but even some of the players dosest to Walker on the field had lit­tle due about what impact he muld have. 
"I wasn't sure what to expect," quarterback Brady Quinn said. "Obviously I give him the ball and [wei ran the ... plays for him [to] see what he [muld] do with it." 

I try to do the best I can in every­thing." 
Handling the spotlight 
Walker's early season accomplish­ments have brought unprecedented m.edia attention to the wide-eyed freshman. But that attention -and sharing the weight of a program's expectations -is no strange concept to one ofWalker's teanlffiates. 
"You have to [handle yourself well]," said Quinn, who threw 59 ·passes in his first start as a freshman last season. "No matter who it is [talking about you], this is Notre Dame. Every time you have a good game, the [media] are going to be saying stuff. You got to stay level­headed, grounded and working hard." 
Walker's performance does not establish hinl1 as the only threat for Notre Dame, either. Grant wa<; still remvering from his hamstring injury during the Michigan game and could get the start Saturday at Michigan State. 
Walker welcomes Grant as the 
Behind an offensive line that showed improvement from the weekend before, Walker jumpstarted a rushing attack that keyed a Notre Dame victory. 
The sweeping effect 
Ask offensive coordinator Bill Diedrick if he has reached a point where he is comfortable with the in<;tallment of the West Co<ist offense and he will reply in a blunt state­ment. 
"Definitely not," he said after beat­ing Michigan. If the offense isn't there yet, Walker ha'i del,initely brought it closer. 
The struggling Irish could get notll­ing going against the five-defensive back set of BYU in the first game of the season, and the play-calling resorted to unsuccessful short pa'iSes and runs. 
Notre Dame maches started soph­omore Travis Thomas (six carries, two yards) at tailback. They used senior Marcus Wilson (nine r,arries, 22 yards). They even inserted junior Jeff Jenkins to block on passing downs. With Ryan Grant out with a sore hamstring, coaches were scranililing for options. 
Walker traveled, but he never saw the field. Part of the reason muld be coaches' concern about Walker's pass blocking abilities. 
"The most difficult thing, when you talk about a passing offense -and this is everyone involved -is the word 'protections,"' Willingham said. "I don't have any idea what Darius had to pass protect against in high school, but I know it wasn't a 246­pound middle linebacker." 
Walker may have to work on his pass protection, but Diedrick believes the advantage an improved running game gives to the entire rest of the team is indisputable. 
"There's a tremendous advantage in having and maintaining good field position both for the offense and the defense," Diedrick said. "You can start all the way back on your own goal line and get into single digits of percent of teams who are able to drive the length of the field." 
Wearing a single digit on his chest and back, Walker's rushing prowess muld make Notre Dame one of those statistical single digits. 
"I try to be a back that can do it all," Walker said. "I want to be a back that has the power to run over you, but I also want the speed to outrun you. I want to be an all-p1,1rpose back. 
senior back. 
"Ryan and I talk all the time," the freshman said. "We are very dose. He tells me to keep working hard and is just a great person and a great back. It is unfortunate tlllat he has his ha.Jru.tring problem, and I hope that he comes back and does well." 
The maturity and intelligence Walker displays during interviews indicates the type of player Willingham has professed recruiting since he signed his five-year mntract. 
"He's a good young man," Prn!>ion said. ''[He's] very intelligent. sharp; as folks can tell he can articulate. He really has a bright future if he can keep it going in the right direction." 
Walker will try hi'> hardest to keep it going as Michigan State approach­es with its eyes focused nowhere else but on the source of Notre Dame's offense. 
"I am a used to [being a target] from high school," he said. "I guess I have a bit of a target on my back after that last game." 
Walker now wears a target along with his number three, both symbol'> of what he has meant to the Irish thLL'ifar.

Walker had an impres­sive debut against Michigan Saturday, rushing for 115 yards and two touchdowns. Grant will probably see playing time as well, and both Powers-Neal and Wilson are other options in the running back rotation. 
The Spartans have the worst rushing defense in the Big Ten, having allowed 410 yards on the ground so far this season. Smith and Harmon rank second and third on the team in tackles-consid­ering both are safeties, that's not a good thing for a rushing defense.

Willingham's team showed tremendous improvement in its win against Michigan, while his staff demonstrated innovation in the offen­sive playcalling. As a graduate of Michigan State, the Irish coach will be hoping uj get a win over his alma mater.  
Smith is in just his sec­ond year at the helm of the Spartans, going 8-4 in the regular season last year including a win at Notre Dame. He had considerable suc­cess at Louisville before corning to East Lansing.  
Smith engineered an upset over then-No. 4 Florida State while at Louisville in 2002. His team did lose at Rutgers to open thjs season, how· ever. Willingham has shown he too can upset teams (Michigan), but his Irish also had an opening letdown.

SPARTANS RUSHING 
The Irish stuffed Michigan's rushing attack, even while focusing on covering the Wolverines' wide receivers. Notre Dame's defensive line caused chaos in the Michigan backfield, stop­ping the running backs bnlore they could even get going. 
Teague has rushed for 160 yards on 33 Carries, and the Spartans have averaged 4.8 yards per carry. However, they have yet. to face a defen­sive unit that is the cal­iber of Notre Dame's sixth-ranked rushing defense. 

SPARTANS PASSING SPECIAL TEAMS 


INTANGIBLES 
The Irish seem to have all the momentum on their side, facing a team that lost to Rutgers in its opening game. But the fact remains that Michigan State has been a thorn in Notre Dame's side for years. 
The Spartans have won six of the last seven against the Irish, and the lone Notre Dame win required a last-second miracle from Arnaz Battle. Smith's team has been preparing for this game for a while, and should come ready to play. ;

RuNNING BAcKs 
The Irish running attack came alive Saturday with the suc­cessful debut of true freshman Darius Walker (above). Walker's 115 yards on 31 carries added an extra dimension to Notre. Dame's offense that seemed to catch Miehigan ofT guard. 
With Hyan Grant hopefully returning from an injury this week, the Irish could have a tandem of speed and power in Walker and Grant. 
Going up against one of the poorer rushing defenses in the country Saturday, the Irish need to show they can move the ball on the ground. 
MICHIGAN STATE 
RUSHING DEFENSE 
The Spartans' rushing defense will have to show that it is better than its current 96th overall national ranking if Michigan State L'i to have any hopn of beating the lrL'ih. 
Ronald Stanley (above) lnads the team's line­backer corps with 27 total tackles, and the sen­ior will have to provide leadership to a unit that has allowed 410 total rushing yards to Rutgers and Central Michigan. 
l,;tst year, the Spartans held .Julius .Jones to just 32 yards on 14 carries. They'll need similar sue­cess against Walker and the other baeks Saturday if' they want to beat the Irish.

Sports Editor 
The big play has historically decided these games. 
The· last five contests between Michigan State and Notre Dame have been decided by game-winning touchdowns coming from 40 or more yards out late in the fourth quarter. 
The Irish will face a Michigan State (1-1) team who is coming off a 24-7 win over Central Michigan. 
Notre Dame, meanwhile, faces the Spartans after a big win at home over then­No. 8 Michigan. But the Irish are not wor­ried about a letdown. 
"The win against Michigan was great but it means nothing right now," defensive end Justin Tuck said. "We have to go up there and if we are not focused they can easily embarrass you. So that's our focus right now. 
"That's what our·leaders are preaching and that is what our coaches were preach­ing yesterday during our meetings. I don't think we are going to let this one slip by mentally. We are going to be geared in and ready to go." 
The Irish must prepare for Spartans quarterback Steven Heaves, a redshirt freshman, who will get the start according to coach John L. Smith. 
Heaves started last week against Central Michigan, going 9-for-19 for 183 yards and one touchdown. However, he was replaced in the fourth quarter by Drew Stanton, who went 1-for-3 and ran for 43 yards on two carries. 
Jason Teague and Jehuu Caulerick, who rushed for 7 4 yards and 68 yards, respec­tively, against the Chippewas, lead the Spartans in the rushing gamP. Receiver Kyle Brown ~;aught six passes for 123 yards and a touchdown. 
But the story of the game was the Spartans' rushing defense -they gave up 236 yards on the ground, including 170 

Fantastic finishes mark lrish-Spartans rivalry 
yards to Jerry Seymour. 
Despite the numbers, the Irish know Michigan State will play them tough, espe­cially when looking back to the history of the rivalry. 
Last season, the Irish were ousted at home, 22-16, when Greg Taplin returned an interception 40 yards with 6 minutes, 55 seconds left in the game. 
Notre Dame linebacker Mike Goolsby said he knows the Spartans always come to play against the Irish. 
"I think just talking about it [Sunday) it's just one of those cases where they just play their hearts out against us and they give us everything they got year in and year out," he said. 
Michigan State defensive back Tyrell Dortch called this game a "must-win" for the Spartans. 
"It is a big game for us," Dortch said of the matchup against the Irish. "We need to win the game." 
And the Irish know what they will be in for when they travel to East Lansing, Mich., to face the Spartans Saturday evening. 
"It seems like the whole time I've been here they've been great games coming down to the wire," said Goolsby, a fifth­year senior. "Hopefully that won't be the case this year but we're preparing for another tough game." 
For Willingham, it is special to play against his alma mater for the third straight year, but that doesn't mean he will show his fondness for the school during the game. 
"It's not just another team," Willingham said. ''I've got some pretty good memories from my days at Michigan State. You have a fondness for that, you have a fondness for the University and you have great n~spect for it. 
"But, once again, when the official blows that whistle, there will be no thoughts about the fondness of Michigan State."

Be bold in your relationships. *** TAURUS (April 20-May 20): This is the perfect day to go after a better position or find a way to make some extra cash. You will have a much better idea what you need to do in order to feel, look and do better. *** GEMINI (May 21-June 20): You have more going for you than you realize, so start moving in a direction that will benefit you. You have been doing too much for others and forgetting about doing for yourself. ***** CANCER (June 21-July 22): Don't be too quick to make a decision; chances are someone is feeding you false information. Emotional matters will surface, so stay composed. ** LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Get involved so you can meet new people or develop a relationship you are already in. Talks will lead to beneficial results. Your persuasive personality will also charm someone. **** VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Question your earning ability and you will discover that there are other ways to make money.

The No. 14 Irish hope to rebound from Wednesday night's 2-0 loss to in-state rival No. 1 Indiana when they welcome Big East rival Georgetown to Alumni Field Saturday night at 7:30p.m. 
The contest marks the first of a limr-game stretch against con­femnce opponents for Notre Dame ( 3-1-1). 
Last season, the Irish edged the Iloyas 2-1 at Alumni Field on a cold Snptember afternoon behind a pair of goals from graduated seniors .Justin I>ntter and Devon Prnseod. The c:ontest turned U!{ly late in the second half.

Notre Dame begins a new chapter of the season this weekend as they debut in both Big East conference play and as the No. 1 team in the nation according to Soccer America magazine. 
The Irish (6-0-0) travel to the East Coast this weekend to begin their conference sched­ule at Connecticut on Friday and then at Syracuse on Sunday. Notre Dame defeated Connecticut 2-0 last year and did not play against Syracuse. 
Irish coach Handy Waldrum said that conference play means that his team is now playing for more than just a ranking, but for positioning in the conference. 
"You look at the season in phases," he said. "This is the second phase of the season and it takes on a little bit high­er level of interest." 
Defender Melissa Tancredi sees the elevated play as rais­ing the stakes for Irish oppo­nents.

Challenges await Irish 
Spikers travel to Gamecock Invitational 
By ANN LOUGHERY Sports Writer 

The Irish aren't ones to shy away from a chal­lenge. 
Already this year, the team held its ground versus preseason No. 2 Nebraska (3-0, 3-2), nearly upsetting the team in the second game. The Irish (4-3) will take on rival Michigan State Friday and host South Carolina Sunday. 
Neither team looks to be a pushover. 
Michigan State (5-1) started the season !law­lessly, winning its Coca-Cola/MSU Volleyball Invitational and sweeping opponents Ohio, St. John's and Florida A&M. No. 6 Washington handed the Spartans their only loss of the sea­son 3-0. 
The team earned a bid to the NCAA Championships last year before losing to Dayton in the opening round. Coach Chuck Erbe Jed the Spartans to a sixth-place finish in the Big Ten Conference and posted a 19-12 record. Ironically, he coached Irish coach Debbie Brown at USC, when the Trojans collect-
