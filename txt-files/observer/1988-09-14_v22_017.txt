Honor code to 
be modified 
By KELLEY TUTHILL News Staff 
After the first meeting of the year, the Honor Code Commit­tee has set its goals on clarify­ing and modifying the code un­til it is accepted by the student body. 
The primary goal of the Com­mittee is "to publicize and cause an awareness of the honor code ... (to discuss) and ... educate the campus com­munity about the positive and negative aspects," as stated in the Minutes of the Academic Council meeting on April 28, 1987. The Committee is led by Chairman Kristen Stamile and Father Oliver Williams, Asso­ciate Provost of the University who serves as the Active Ad­ministrator of the Honor Code. 
Stamile said that the first meeting was on Sept. 1 and resulted in the formation of three groups within the Com­mittee. One group is concerned with the continuing education of the community on the Honor Code, another group is dedi­cated to assessment of the Code, and the third group is working on the issues of non­tolerance and clarification, said Stamile. 

"I think that the Notre Dame student body needs some op­tions concerning the idea of nontolerance, there is no cut and dry way to deal with it," said Stamile. Nontolerance is the idea that a student should not tolerate the dishonesty on the part of anyone else in the student body, said Stamile. She also said that this is the most controversial part of the Code among students. 
Williams said that the faculty assessment has been ex­tremely positive among those who used the Code last year. He also said that the student feedback has been "largely positive" as well. Williams said that the, "faculty will be more willing if they perceive that the students understand it and are

The LaFortune Student Cen­ter information desk and the Buzz Bus have been upgraded this year by the Office of Stu­dent Activities. A new shuttle service to Chicago has been added as well. 
"An information desk is an integral part of a student cen­ter," said Ceil Paulsen, Assis­tant Director of Student Activ­ities for facilities and programming. "Visitors on campus, as well as students need a center that provides ser­vices consistently throughout the academic year," added Paulsen. The new Information Desk is located conveniently in LaFortune Student Center. 
The information desk hours are Monday, Wednesday, Friday from 12-9p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 12:30-9 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 1-9 p.m. The desk hours will be extended during special events, said Paulsen. 
The information desk pro­vides several major services: 
•Ticket 
sales for the "Windy City Shuttle"; 

•Value 
Check Coupon Book sales which provide discounts for local restuarants and enter­tainment; 

•U.S. 
postal stamp sales; 

•Newspapers 
and magazines for student facilitation 


(Chicago Tribune, New York Times, Life, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated); 
•Box 
Office Service which sells tickets to all Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students for func­tions in Washington Hall, Stepan Center and O'Laughlin Auditorium; and 

•Campus 
maps and scheduled events. 


Although Joe Cassidy, Direc­tor of Student Activities, and Paulsen collaborated on the services provided by the desk, Paulsen is the direct super­visor over the information cen­ter.

Freshman calls Miami's Johnson 
By MARK MCLAUGHLIN Senior Staff Reporter 
Notre Dame students are apparently "beating the rush" by sending letters and making phone calls to Miami head football coach Jimmy Johnson. 
"We've had maybe three or four phone calls and some letters as well," said Miami Sports Information Director Rich Dalrymple. "They're mostly good-natured kid­ding around." 
"We did have one caller who made a very rude remark to Coach Johnson's secretary," he added. 
The Miami-Notre Dame football game is at Notre Dame Stadium on October 15th. 
A personal classified ad, published in The Observer on August 30th, read in part: "Beat the rush. Send Jimmy Johnson hate mail now." Also listed was the address of Miami's Sports Informa­tion Office and a phone num­ber to call. 
Douglas Browne, a fresh­man in Keenan Hall, called the Miami Sports Informa­tion office last week and asked for Johnson. "I talked to him for about a minute and a half," Browne said. 

''I told him we'd kill them and he said I was dreaming. Then he told me there is no chance of them losing." 
"I told him he was dream­ing,'' Browne added. 
Dalrymple said that let­ters and phone calls from Notre Dame students have been going on for several years. The calls "stopped being funny about three years ago," he said. "We all get them."

Goldrick speaks on SYR policy at HPC 
By MAURA KRAUSE Staff Reporter 
The Hall Presidents' Coun­cil's weekly meeting was held last night at Keenan Hall. After an opening prayer, attendance was taken and a brief senate report given. The floor was then turned over to the keynote speaker John Goldrick, Associ­ate Vice President for Residence Life and Student Af­fairs. 
Goldrick, a spokesman for the University Task Force, al­though he "did not have one word with the Alcohol Task force last year," answered questions dealing with hall SYRs and semi-formal dances. 
When asked about the rule of 70% attendance, Goldrick was, "not sure why that magic num­ber was picked. I suspect that one reason is because they (dances) are an all-hall event and a majority is needed for an

IN BRIEF 
Two clowns who fell in love at a clowns' convention took a shot at tying the knot in a ceremony that was a regular circus. "I take Chubby Cheeks to be my awful wedded husband," Sparkles the clown said in the weekend ceremony. "I promise to love, honor, and bathe him ... And I will not nag at him for eating candy bars, ice cream and cookies." The bride clutched fake flowers and sported gold tinsel hair, twinkling gold eyelashes and size 18 shoes. Before the vows, Chubby Cheeks, trembling from matrimonial jitters, tried to make a run for it. "My mother cooks better than her!" he shouted as he tried to wobble to freedom in his white baggy pants and oversized shoes. He was headed off and returned to the side of his bride, where he said: "I take Sparkles to be my lawful-wedded wife, I promise not to eat peanut butter and cookies b~fore going to bed I will help with the housework, I promise to take out the garbage and hang up my clothes every night, and I promise to visit her relatives without any argument whatsoever." Chubby Cheeks, whose real name is Ed Savage, and Milly Fantucchio, who plays Sparkles, met at a Clowns of America International meeting three years ago. Sunday's ceremony at Castle Land amusement park, where the couple works as clowns on summer weekends, was a dress rehearsal for a more traditional ceremony later this month. -Associated Press 
Green tennis shoes earned a public defender a weeklong jail sentence after he wore the colored sneakers in court. Superior Court Judge William Scholl ordered Ralph Malanga last month not to wear ~is green tennis shoes in court. But Malanga showed up m the shoes the next day. "If you're a member of the Boston Celtics, it's OK," he told Malanga. "But this is Superior Court." The judge sentenced the lawyer Monday, saying the shoes detracted from the court's dignity. He further prohibited the attorney from seeing other lawyers during his jail term. Malanga, wearing brown leather shoes, asked Scholl Monday to drop the matter, saying the issue was moot because neither he nor anyone else is wearing sneakers any more. He apologized, but Scholl was unmoved, ev~n when Malanga told him that he was supposed to go to tnal today, representing a defendant in a first-degree murder case. "The attitude of a lawyer to the court must be one of respect," Scholl said. When a l~wyer comes ~?. ~ourt wearing green sneakers after he IS told not to, It s no longer funny. It's contempt," Scholl said. Malanga said he probably would try to get the state Court of Appeals to stay the sentence, then added: "maybe I'll just let him put me in jail if he thinks that's appropriate." -Associated Press

INSIDE COLUMN 


Youth are responsible to vote in future election 
As you may have noticed (if you have been alive the past 18 months and have seen a TV or newspaper), this is an election year. Through the processes laid down in the Constitution 201 years ago, we will go about choosing our elected officials, at every level from precinct commit­teeman all the way up to President of the United States. 
For the majority of the undergraduates at Notre Dame, 1988 represents our first chance to influence the outcome of national elections. Even many of the seniors were too young in 1984 to cast a vote in the Presidential election. 
And the sad fact is that most of us probably won't vote on November 8. Actually, many stu­dents can't vote on Election Day, because they're not registered. 
Young people such as ourselves are tradition­ally the least likely to vote. This perplexes me; we have the most to lose. 
The man who is elected President, whether it is George Bush or Michael Dukakis, will al­most certainly guide our country for the next four years (barring death or scandal). These next four years will be the ones in which we will be finishing our educations, searching for jobs, and establishing careers. The man who leads our country and the policies he pursues will directly affect our economic well-being for the rest of our lives. 
Why should I register to vote? This is an easy question to answer. Your "duty as a citizen" and other such responses aside, there is a very practical reason to register and vote: because you pay taxes. 
Each April 15 you mail off a check to Uncle Sam. If you're a normal American, you spend the next 364 days moaning about how much you pay. 
Let's face it: if you don't vote, you can't com­plain. Our system is set up so that you get the opportunity eve!ry four years to help choose the very people who decide how much you're going to pay and how that money is going to be spent. It might happen that the. person you vote for does not win the election, but at least you were able to express your opinion. Taxpayers in most other countries do not have the luxury of being able to elect their own tax collectors. 
Should I register here in South Bend or at home? This one really is up to you. There are good arguments for both. 
You must realize that you do spend the majority of each year (9 months) here at Notre Dame. The decisions of local congressmen, In­diana and locall officials do affect you directly. In particular, the race for U.S. Representative from Indiana's 3rd District is a tight one; in 1986 Republican Congressman John Hiler won by only 46 votes, the smallest winning margin in the nation. '!'his year Hiler faces Tom Ward, his Democratic challenger from 1986. Once 

Matt Gallagher ~ 
again, this race will probably prove tight; your vote might mean the difference in this race. 
Balance this against the fact that you prob­ably pay taxes at home and will most likely move back there once you graduate. However, if you register at home you will have to go through the hassle of getting an absentee ballot. 
How do I register to vote? 
This, of course, depends on where you regis­ter. If you register at home, it depends on your state regulations. Some states allow you to reg­ister by mail, while others require you to be present in your home county to register. You should call your county's Board of Elections to find out specifics. 
If you choose to register here in St. Joseph's county, you must register by September 23. This allows the county time to make sure you're not registered somewhere else. 
Many campus organizations, such as College Republicans and Democrats and the Student Government, are sponsoring registration drives. You should get in touch with them to to register. Alternately, you can go to the County-City Building downtown and register at the Board of Elections office. 
All the registering in the world won't help if you don't actually go out and vote on November 
8. The polling place on Notre Dame's campus is located at Stepan Center. The site at Saint Mary's is Augusta Hall. 
PLEASE VOTE NOVEMBER 8!

Hurricane Gilbert, one of the strongest storms in history, roared toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula Tuesday with 175 mph winds after bat­tering the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the tiny Cayman Islands. 
At least five people were killed by the hurricane Sunday in the Dominican Republic, ac­cording to civil defense offi­cials, and there were uncom­firmed reports of at least 30 storm-related deaths Monday in Jamaica.

"The people who need to be concerned now are those people over on the Yucatan Peninsula--Cancun, Cozumel, that whole area," Sheets said. 
Mexico's news media re­ported beachfront hotels were evacuated in the Yucatan resorts of Cancun and Cozumel Island. 
They gave no figures on the numer of evacuees, but said people in Cancun were being sent from the hotel zone into the city center, about 6 miles away. 
Cozumen is south of Cancun and the reports said hotel guests also were being moved to more secure areas away from the shoreline. 
Mexican officials expected the storm to hit in the early morning hours Wednesday. 
At 9 p.m. EDT the U.S. Na­tional Weather Service said Gilbert was centered near latitude 19.7 north, longitude 
83.9 west, or about 215 miles east-southeast of Cozumel. 
It said Gilbert was moving west-northwest at about 15 mph with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph. 
The center said Hurricane Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure. It said by 8 p.m. EDT it was measured at 
26.13 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys. 
"That's the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western Hemisphere," said forecaster Mark Zimmer.

Notre Dame is the only school that has been pestering Miami lately, Dalrymple said. "We used to get a lot of calls from Florida. You'd expect that from a big in-state rival. They dropped Miami from their schedule, though, so Notre Dame is the only one nowadays. 
"The majority of the calls have been in the last three years, since Miami beat Notre Dame 58-7," he added. 
The calls were mentioned on the CBS national broadcast of the Notre Dame-Michigan game Saturdav. 
The storm later knocked out all telephone service to the Cayman Islands, a British de­pendency of 23,000 people that was expecting 12-foot tides. 
Warren Chase, an amateur radio operator in Fort Myers, Fla., said he received a report of sailboat with seven people aboard missing near the Cayman Islands. 
The hurricane, traveling westward across the Carib­bean Sea, was upgraded Tues­day to a Category 5, the strongest and deadliest type of hurricane. Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage. 
Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., described Gilbert. as "a great hurricane . . . in the top 10 percent (historically) as far as inten­sity, size and destructive poten­tial."

Code into the University. He said also, "We'll be working hard to persuade the student body." The Committee essen­tially has three more years to accomplish this before the Code is officially reviewed by the Academic Council, said Williams. 
In their agenda, the Commit­tee plans to create a new videotape for the class of 1993 which will stress moral educa­tion, honor, and pride. They also plan to continue educating faculty and students on the Code, and sample cases will be used in an effort to issue uni­form punishments. Stamile said, "From my experiences when people learn more about the Code they like it more." 
Also on the agenda is the need for increased faculty and student input. Stamile said thus far there has been no formal student assessment of the Code. Williams said that he received letters of assessment from the faculty members who used the code last year. Repre­sentation from the Class of 1992 is important, according to Stamile. Stamile said that, "A small number of individuals can't come up with a policy that will please everyone." 
The agenda includes options for the issue of nontolerance that will be discussed. Williams said that different universities across the nation have varied methods of dealing with this sit­uation. These are approaching the student first as oppossed to reporting them to the professor or simply warning the student before they are to be reported, according to the agenda. 
Clarifications in the Code also to be discussed are also on the agenda for the year. This includes differing between minor and major offenses, questions of proctoring, 

..

page 5 
penalty discussions, and other 
modifications. Williams spoke 
of the Code as still being in a 
"transition period" that will 
have changes every year. 
The final goal listed on the agenda called for a discussion of the Committee itself. Wil­liams said that guidelines need to be established concerning who is on the Committee and how members are selected. Some schools, he said, hold elections to their Honor Code Committees. Williams hopes that ultimately the Honor Code Committee will be student dominated. 
The Committee presently
consists of Raymond Sepeta, 
Prof. Gerald Jones, Prof. Step­
hen Batill, Prof. Kevin 
Misiewicz, and Prof. Clark 
Power, all of whom were ap­
pointed by the College to which 
they teach and two student rep­
resentatives Michael Shinnick 
and Dan Gerlach. 
Presently the Honor Code is used in all100 level courses and in most 200 level courses, said Stamile. Classes in the 300 and 400 level use the Honor Code if there is a unanimous student vote to use it, said Stamile. "Usually there is not a unani­mous vote," said Stamile. 
"My goal is to focus on hel­ping the students see the wis­dom in the Honor Code, said Williams, "Ifstudents don't see that the Code is in their best interest, then it won't work." Williams said that he is very hopeful that the Honor Code will work at the University of Notre Dame. 

In three years the Academic Council, made up of adminis­trators, faculty, and students will vote on whether to continue or cease the use of the Honor Code, said Williams. "This will depend on whether they (the Council) feels that the students have been persuaded that the Honor Code is a good idea at Notre Dame," said Williams.

The flexibility of the Admin­istration on this rule was also brought up, and Goldrick said it is "discussible, not negoti­able, because 'discussible' will sit better with my colleagues in the Administration." 
Halls are only permitted one SYR per semester because, "where SYR's were last year was unacceptable. It was only with a lot of discussion that there are any at all. One is smack in the middle of the two extremes we could have gone to," said Goldrick. The current policy on SYR's will be

Mary's have another new op­portunity this year. "The Windy City Shuttle is a wonder­ful opportunity for students, faculty and staff to get to Chicago at a reasonable price," said Cassidy. 
"For that matter, it would cost more than the price of the ticket just to park in downtown Chicago." 

The Windy City Shuttle began its trips to Chicago Sep­tember 3. 
Every non-football weekend, the shuttle leaves N.D. Main Circle at 9:45 a.m. The shuttle stops at two locations down­town Chicago --Marshall Fields and Water Tower Place. 
Departure times are 7: 30 
p.m. from Water Tower and 
7:45 p.m. from Marshall Fields. The scheduled arrival time back at N.D. Main Circle is 10:45 p.m. 
Roundtrip tickets can be pur­chased for $10 by Notre Dame and Saint Mary's faculty, staff and students at the Information Desk in LaFortune. Free maps are available upon purchase. 
The Buzz Bus will be pro­vided again by the Hall Presi­dents' Council. "There are more preliminaries to deal with while the Buzz Bus is in its transitional stages. We want better participation and hope the bus will be a feasible option 
for students," said Kerstin White, Hall Presidents' Council Chairman. A committee of interested students and HPC members is being formed to deal with the progress, said White, and will have the Buzz Bus scheduled and running by the middle of October.

Vietnam: the missing soldiers 
The week of Sept. 11-17 has been declared POW!MIA Awareness Week, which hopes to shed light upon an issue which continues to plague the families and friends of a reported 2,383 Americans unaccounted for in Indoc­hina. The Vietnam War's legacy con­tinues to haunt our nation. 
Chris Shank 
guest column 
It is not an easy issue--fueled by emo­tion, speculation and politics. The return of these prisoners and those mis­sing, either living or dead, is not an easy issue reserved only for politicians, grieving family members, or the mili­tary. It is a humanitarian issue, one where the remains of husbands, fathers and brothers are being held captive for mere political ends, and if any of these 2,383 men are alive, they are held prisoners of a war fought 15 years ago. 
This is not a political issue, but one of conscience. Like all emotional is­sues, however, the fate of these missing men has turned political with promises of progress between our country and Vietnam as well as between presiden­tial administrations and the families of the missing. Few of these promises have been kept, but the Reagan admin­istration has done more to resolve the issue than any other. New agreements with the Hanoi government have made it possible for a concentrated three­month joint effort to find some of these missing, while working "under the as­sumption that some Americans are held in captivity." In a speech before the National League of Families, a sup­port group for the relatives, President Reagan made this commitment: "We 
will continue to make progress as long as we stick with the facts, ...keep faith with each other and demonstrate the unity of purpose so fundamental to our cause. All Americans...have a com­mon goal in the endeavor: Freedom for any prisoner who may still be held in Southeast Asia and justice for all the families who have worked so long to resolve the fate of our POWs and MIAs in Vietnam." 
Awareness and public pressure upon the Hanoi government, a government which capitalizes on the frustration of 
Doonesbury 
these families for political ends, helps ease the pain for those waiting to hear any news about their missing loved ones. The sister of Navy Lt. Cmdr. James Mills, one of the missing, summed up her emotions on the issue: "Death you can get over. Uncertainty is a pain you can never get over. And end to uncertainty is what we want--the best possible accounting we can ob­tain." 
During the course of this week, the American Colors on the South Quad of Notre Dame will be joined by the dark POW!MIA "You Are Not Forgotten" flag. Hppefully, as we hurry from class to class, we can all stop for a moment and reflect on what it means to be pris­oner or to be prepared to die in defense of our nation and the Constitution. Also, on Wednesday night at 7:30, Arnold Air Society, the community service organi­zation of Air Force ROTC, will sponsor the film "Operation Homecoming" in the Center for Social Concerns. On Thursday morning at 8: 15 in the crypt of Sacred Heart Church, Fr. Campbell will celebrate mass. in honor of those prisoners of war and missing in action who answered the call of our country for the cause of peace. We will pray that this wound which lingers from Vietnam may soon heal. Then on Friday afternoon our prayer will con­tinue with a Flag Retreat Ceremony sponsored by the three branches of mil­itary service represented here at Notre Dame. The guest speaker for this event is Chaplain Donald Neely, Lt. Col. 
U.S.A. <Retired), of South Bend who served 13 months in Vietnam and is ac­tive locally in furthering the public's awareness of this American tragedy. The Colors, as well as the stark banner of the missing man, will be retired at this time. 
By gammg knowledge of the POW!MIA issue through these events, we may learn to further our dedication to peace and respect of these men who died to serve their country. Also during the course of the week, Air Force ROTC will be selling POW!MIA bracelets with the names of these men and the date they disappeared--gone, but not forgot­ten.

major and an Arnold Air Society mem­

P.O. Box Q 
Students affect off-campus crime 
Dear Editor: 
I was sitting in my office on a lovely Friday afternoon, just before returning home for dinner, when I noticed a pair of articles in The Observer on off­campus crime. Not wishing to be yet another statistic in a local crime wave, I read both with great interest. With this still fresh in my mind, I made the short drive back to my hovel sweet hovel. 
Upon walking in the front door and greeting one of my housemates I was warned, "Don't take the side street, those Domers were out breaking bottles in the road again." This was done with a spirit of youthful exuberance and was all in good fun, I am sure, but no wonder the neighbors might not notice the group ransacking the fun lovers' home. They could be too busy repairing their tires or reminiscing about that 
awesome  party  next door that kept  
them up all nigh t.

Iran-contra: a watershed of evil 
Dear Editor: 
Just when you thought it was safe to say "Irarvcontra," the fallout from this affair raises its unconstitutional head once again. According to the Christie Institute, an interfaith law and public policy center in Washington, D.C., their three-year investigation has uncovered 25 years of illegal and unconstitutional actions by some of the same folks in-

volved with the IraiVcontra affair. The findings of this investigation have led to a lawsuit in a U.S. district court in Miami designed to expose and prose­cute those involved with these actions. 
The Christie Institute's lawsuit iden­tifies such Irarvcontra celebrities as Richard Secord, Theodore Shackley, 
and Albert Hakim  as  members of  a  
"Secret Team" that dates back to  a  
covert air war in Laos in the 1960s.  

The Christie Institute has been no stranger to scandal and successful pro­secution as the Christie's success in the past include the Karen Silkwood case and the Greensboro Civil Rights case. 
The Graduate Student Union and the Center for Social Concerns are hosting Daniel Siegal, the former Director of Public Education at the Christie In­stitute, to speak this Wednesday, Sept. 14, at 7:00 p.m., in the Hesburgh Li­brary Auditorium. Mr. Siegal, having recently spoken at Harvard, M.l.T., and Boston University, will speak on "The Untold Story of the IraiVcontra Scandal." Siegal will focus on the financing of the Iranlcontra "en­terprise." 
Did the congressional hearings un­cover and tell the whole story, or were the hearings just the tip of an uncon­stitutional iceberg? 
We hope you will join us for what promises to be an enlightening affair. Come and listen.

Born in Michigan in 1949, Winston moved from Montana to Mississippi to Florida before high school gradua­tion. He began playing the organ and electric piano after listening to pop instrumental acts like Floyd Cramer, The Ventures, Booker T and The MG's, King Curtis, and R&B artists like Ray Charles and Sam Cooke. The legendary swing pianist Fats Waller inspired his switch to the piano in 1971, when Winston

win the state football crown in more than one state. Add that he's from Michigan and lives in Indiana and the fact that he's competing for the crown in the Land of Lincoln makes the scenario even more confusing. 
Four years ago, the Profes­sional American Kickboxing Association changed the rules to allow fighters to compete in more than one state. For Rob­inson, that new rule meant more fights, more exposure and, ultimately, more titles. 
One of Robinson's most memorable fights was a result of the rule change. He stopped John Poe for the Indiana crown in Elkhart. 
"That was one of the best fights I've ever had," Robinson said. "I had a lot of Notre Dame fans cheering me on. It made me work real hard. I wanted it and I knew I was going to get it. Nothing was going to stop me." 
Robinson, 18-6-1, has hopes of moving up in the world ranking, but realizes that at 34, he may not have that many good fights left. Linares was the No. 7 fighter in the world and a rematch is scheduled for later this winter. Robinson has a non-title fight set for October against an opponent to be named later. 
"If I make a move, I'll have to do it now," he said. "I was planning on retiring in '89." 
Right now he's showing no signs of slowing. Sweet C. works out over two hours a day, six days a week in hopes of ob­taining that goal of being the best in the sport. He runs, jumps rope, lifts weights, works the bag, does sit-ups, shadow boxes and then climbs in the ring for the real thing. Manager Rich Madison keeps a watchful eye on his fighter. 
In the evenings, Robinson devotes his time to training members of the Notre Dame boxing club for the famed Ben­gal Bouts. He says his biggest reward comes from just "help­ing them out. I see a big differ­ence. When they first come in, some can't even get their hands up." 

In 1981, Robinson worked out at the Ali training camp, be­coming close friends with the greatest heavyweight of all­time. He worked out with then unknowns Thomas Hearns, Davey Armstrong and Tony Tubbs. 
While fame and fortune may have inflated the egos of some of those boxers, Sweet C. remains humble. He even gives a portion of his fight proceeds to the Special Olympics. · 
"The kids are so special," Robinson said. "People ought to think of others instead of themselves." 
With the growing popularity of the sport, several young fighters look to Robinson for advice. He offers somewhat different guidance than some people might expect. 
"I wouldn't encourage it be­cause it's so dangerous and you can get hurt," he said. 
Why then, does Sweet C. Rob­inson compete in a sport he wouldn't recommend to a young athlete? 
"I'm not being modest, but I'm one of the best," Robinson said matter-of-factly with a smile on his face. "If I can go in and constantly win, that's why I do it."

NEW HAVEN, Conn.--Yale University has endowed fac­ulty chairs in Near Eastern lan­guages, Old Testament studies and a host of other subjects. Now the Ivy League school's football coach will join that elite company as the Joel E. Smilow Coach of Football. 
Yale announced Tuesday that Smilow, a 1954 Yale graduate and president and chief executive officer of Stamford-based Playtex Inc., had donated $1 million to endow the head football coach's job, the first endowed position in the athletic department. 
"Excellence in football is not a core objective of Yale or any other great institution of higher education," Smilow, whose col­lege football career was lim­ited to intramural touch foot­ball, said in a statement. 
"However, it is my belief that football is an integral part of the very broad objective of at­tracting, educating and motivating persons with the po-
