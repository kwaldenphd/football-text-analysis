l OC causes handicaps, advantages 
Editor's Note: This article Is the first In a two-part series discussing life off campus. Today's article will discuss the advantages, the dis­advantages, and the projected changes In off-campus life, while tomorrow's article will trace the steps which a student might follow 
in making the move off campus. 
by Pat Mangan 

While Edmund Price, director of Student Housing. distinguishes be­tween the "actual" and "virtual" certainty of a housing lottery' the fact still remains that, if the current trend continues, the University could be as much as 150 beds short at the beginning of next year. As the housing shortage seems inev­itable, and a lottery a strong likelihood, many students are seri­ously considering the move off campus. 
As in many controversial issues, there is no simple clear cut answer to the student faced with an impending lottery, and confronted by the big question. "Should I move OC?". But there are many factors which he might consider in making a decision. 
Among many OC students, there seems to be ''two sides to every coin'' attitude about life off campus. While the majority, on one hand, claimed they couldn't be pain to move back on campus, they maintained that they still are faced with various problems. 
Most of the OC students ques­tioned, listed a ''Iact of representa­tion" on campus as a big problem. John Fitzpatrick, Student Govern­ment Off-Campus Coordinator, termed it "taxation without repre­sentation." 
According to Fitzpatrick, al­though there are about 1000 stu­dents off campus who are each charged a $17 Student Activities Fee, there is no OC representative on the Campus Life Council, nor on the Board of Commissioners, which is responsible for the allocation of funds. 
Furthermore, such representa­tion would call for amendments to the two ruling bodies' constitu­tions, and such amendments may only be made with a 2/.l vote of the campus representatives who are already members of the BOC and 
CLC. "Ironically," said Fitz­patrick, "the thousand or more OC students are excluded from the very process which will decide their 
.fate.'' 
Another problem expressed re­garding off-campus living was transportation. People on campus 
'(0C gtudettts atre e~cQuded ...' 
fearing a lottery, as well as OC students, have raised questions in this area. At present, Shannon Neville, part of an OC Ad-Hoc Committee, is investigating the possibility of a shuttle service. 
According to Neville, John Reid, director of Student Activities, and Fr. John Van Wolvlear, vice-president of Student Affairs, are in favor of a shuttle bus service and implied that such a service will probably become a reality. 
Fitzpatric said that there used to be a shuttle service last year, but it was short-lived because of inade­quate planning. He added that as soon as necessary data was in, the possibility of a "semester bus" would be explored. 
. One OC student commented that although not having a car can be a handicap, it is usually possible to get a ride with a friend or house-mate. Fitzpatrick suggested that car-pools might be a viable alternative to transportation prob­lems. 
Another problem OC students have is that even though they live off campus, they spend a great deal of time on campus and have no space designated for them. Ad­dressing this problem, Fitzpatrick said that the establishment of an OC Lounge in the alcove adjacent to the main area of LaFortune was being investigated. He added that its establishment is very probable. 
So far, possible problems have been the focus of this article, but there has also been amny points made for life off campus. Most OC students ,who were questioned cited their increased freedom and living space as advantages to living off campus. 
One student, "a double domer" who spent his first four years 011 campus, and who is now in his second year off campus, said that the increased freedom and privacy of OC life is a big psychological advantage. "Freedom is helpful too because you are faced with living in an unsheltered environ­ment in which you must grow and mature,'' he said. 
Dan D'Antonio, director of Off­Campus Housing, added that many of the students who live on -campus really don't get off campus enought to realize that there is a variety of activities going on off campus as well as on. 
Many on-campus students' atti­tudes can be summed up in the remark of a Pangborn junior.

Instead of store 
SU to sponsor record sale 
by Rob Powers Staff Reporter 

Student Union Director Bill Roche announced Friday the Stu­dent Union will hold a record sale in late January. to compensate for the rejection of the · permanent record store proposal. 
Director of Student Activities Joh? Reid said he "will give formal approval to the basic plan. 
According to Roche, after the Student Union conducts a three week advertising campaign, stu­dents may order records during the fourth week of January throught the Student Union. Student Union will then send the orders on to a discount record outlet, based in Indianapolis. Delivery of the albums should take about a week, Roche added. 

Prices will be "significantly lower" than existing list prices and the average retail price for records in the area, l<.oche said. He said he could not give an exact price for the records at the sale. although he added that the prices would pro­bably vary between $4 and $5, as compared to the price range of Bookstore records ($5,33-9.73), and local record shops (3.99-6.98). 
The· record sale is ''strictly a service to students," and not a "profit-making venture for the Student Union," Roche stated. 
However, Roche still intends to press the Administration for per­mission to operate a record store on a permanent basis. The store. he said, would be the only ''long term 
solution''  to  the problem of  stu­ 
dents  facing  higher  prices  and  
poorer selection of records.  
A permanent  store  would  not  

only be ''a greater convenience for students," but "a learning experi­ence for the people operating the store," Roche said. 
·"ot a.ptro6it­ma/Qu,g ve"hme .:.' 
Reid called the record sale "a fine idea that answers some of the concerns that Father Van Wolvlear expressed.'' On November 21, Van W olvlear, Vice President for Stu­dent Affairs, rejected the Student Union's proposal on the grounds that a record store was not "a serious need of. students," and ''that it is not the main function of the students to get involved in operating businesses.'' 
Reid stated that he sees the record sale as ''similar to the plant sale in concept. This is not an experiment or a first step towards the record shop." 
Reid pointed out one advantage of the record sale over a permanent record shop is that "financially, there's much less risk," since there won't be problems of excess inven­tory.

Russia renegs ongrainpact 
WASHINGTON [AP]· The Soviet Union is lagging far behind in buying U.S. grain under the third year of an agreement calling for it to purchase wheat and corn on a regular basis. Purchases announced so far by USDAare running only about 25 percent of what they were a year ago. The most recent sale officially announced by the department was on Sept. 29. Department officials are not alarmed at this and point out that the Soviet Union ­unlike a year ago -just recently completed a record grain harvest and probably still is assessing its import needs for the coming year. Four years ago, the Soviet Union signed an agreement in which it pledged to buy a minimum of six million metric tons of grain annually-divided equally between wheat and corn -beginning with deliveries on Oct. 1. 1976. 
Jerry Lewis kicks drug habit 
NEW YORK [AP-Comedian Jerry Lewis says he nearly put a bullet through his head five years ago while under the influence of massive doses of pain-killers but recently has kicked his addiction to the drug, according to an interveiw in People magazine. Lewis, the magazine said, became addicted to heavy doses of Percodan after doctors were unable to stop the pain from a spinal injury he suffered during_ a pratfall in an act in Las Vegas in 1965. The famed heart specialist, Dr. Michael DeBakey, whom Lewis had met through one of the telethons, persuaded Lewis to go into the doctor's Houston clinic, where examinatin showed Lewis had a stomach ulcer. DeBakey was quoted as saying the massive doses of the pain-killer had hidden the ulcer symptoms and that if the ulcer had gone undetected a few more weeks it could have l1emorrhaged and ~illed the comedian. 

Fiedler leaves Medical Center 
BOSTON [AP]-Boston Pops conductor Arthur Fiedler was discharged from Tufts-New England Medical Center on Sunday after four days of treatment for exhaustion. Hospital officials did not disclose details of the 83-year-old conductor's condition during his stay. He was admitted Wednesday, and the hospital said he was discharged late Sunday afternoon. Fiedler, who has conducted the Boston Pops for SO years, is scheduled to conduct a nationally televised tribute on his 84th birthday Dec. 17. 

Police investigate shooting 
NASHVILLE,  [AP]-Police are trying to determine whether the bullet that killed songwriter Lee Emerson Bellamy was fired from his own gun or from a pistol that belongs to Barry Sadler, who recorded the hit "Ballad of the Green Berets." Police said Sadler told them he fired one shot Friday night at Lee Emerson Bellamy, 
55. Homicide Detective Jim Sledge said the shooting appeared to be slef-defense and no charges had been filed by Sunday. Sadler, 37, whose song about the U.S. Special Forces sold nine million singles and albums, said he considers himself an excellent shot. because of his training as a Green Beret. "I fired to miss him by two feet," he said. "If I'd been trying to kill him I could have put a bullet in his ear. I guess either his own gun was cocked and went off or my bullet richocheted off the glass." 

Nixon visits the 'Big Apple' 
New York-An entourage of Secret Service men accompanied former President Richard Nixon as he left his hotel for a quiet Sunday afternoon of watching football and visiting with his family. He said he planned a quiet family day visiting his daughter, Tricia, and son-in-law, Edward Cox. The former president said he planned to do some Christmas shopping during his 10-day visit in New York and did not have any public appearances scheduled.

court charges 

KINGMAN, Ariz. [AP]  Charles Dederich, who turned his Synanon alcohol and drug rehabilitation program into a religious cui, was arraigned in his hospital bed yesterday, too drunk to be taken to court, on charges connected with attempted murder, authorities said. 
Dederich, 65, was formally charged at Mohave County General Hospital with conspiracy and solici­tation to commite murder in a bizarre rattlesnake attack on Paul Marantz, 33, a Los Angeles attor­ney. He was held in the hospital's jail ward in lieu of $500,000 bail. 
Dederich was arrested on a fugitive warrant Saturday at his home in Lake Havasu City by Mohave County seriff's deputies, and Los Angeles officials had sought to have him arraigned immediately. 
But Los Angleles district attor­ney's spokesman AI Albergate said, "He was too drunk to be taken to court," and instead was sent by ambulance to the the hospital. 
Mohave County Sheriff robert D. Rathbone said a county psychiatrist examined Dederich and decided he should remain hospitalized for three to five days because he is suffering from depression and a heart condition. He declined to be 
. more specific.

Many halls suffer damage, 
to extenO YOUQ SUBSC~tptton to 
students h.ur·l snowballs 
*Th~ lndQ~~t~fYw@[
by John G. McDermott 

Several halls suffered damage this weekend as snowballs were hurled through windows, shat· tering glass and requiring some students to be taken to the hospital. 
Of the 18 halls that were con­tacted, approximately 55 to 60 windows were broken and seven students hurt. Morrissey, Dillon, Alumni and Keenan Halls were the targets for most of the damage. 
In Morrissey, five students were hurt, two seriously. Sophomores Danny Tarillo and Brian Morris were standing in the Morrissey lobby Friday night when snowballs shattered the window. 
Tarillo said that therewere about 20 to 30 students throwing snow­balls at the hall. "I had no idea it was coming. We didn't do any­thing to proboke this. I just couldn't believe they would throw snowballs at· the window," Tarillo 
said. Both Tarillo and Morris suffered surface wounds from the flying galss but were not seriously hurt. Later on that night, between 
12:30 -1 a.m., the bedroom window of Mike Rhodes was broken. Rhodes and some friends were having a small party at the time. Because of the heat, Rhodes and another freshman, John Gib­boos, ··were standing by the win~ dow. When the window was hit, flying glass fragments were ern­bedded in Gibbons' upper arm and in Rhodes' nose and upper chest. Both were taken to St. Joseph's Hospital where they received stitches. 
Another freshman in the room, Andrea Irnbriaco of Lyons Hall, was also hurt but not seriously. Securit~ was called but by the ti!"e they arrtved, the students throwmg 
. the snow were gone. . Brother Edw~rd Luther, Moms­sey rector, pomted out that the 
serving notre dame & st. marvs much worse. In all, 12 windows 
damage to his hall could have been 
thQOUqh th SPQJnq ·79 SffiSt~
were broken. He estimated that 
damages and repairs wiH be 
between $150 to $200. 
Luther stressed the fact that no 
Morrissey student did anything to 
aggravate the situation. "We were 
not antagonizing anyone." he said. 
Luther speculated that the group of 
students invoh;ed were probably 
from different halls. 
In Dillon, 15 windows were 
destroyed throughout the weekend 
but no one was hurt. Commenting 
on a rumor that Dillon .students 
were involved in the damage done 
to other halls, Fr. Joe Carey, 
assistant rector, stated that "abso­
lutely no Dillon student was in· 
volved in the snowbalJ throwing.

ND prepares for holidays 
by Cathy Santoro 

The Christmas season at Notre Dome is much more than a crowded library and "all nighters" in prep· aration for finals. Students and faculty have planned a variety of activities to celebrate the coming holiday. 
Fr. Robert Griffin, University· chaplain, will begin the celebration with the lighting and blessing of the University Christmas tree on the Feast of St. Nicholas, Wednes­day at 7 p.m. 
When the University issued a directive prohibiting live trees in the dormitories two years ago, the Student Body decided to select a large tree in front of LaFortune to be the official school Christmas tree. According to Griffin,  'Hav­ing just one tree provides a sense of sharing; everyone can see and enjoy it." 
Immediately following the cere­mony, Griffin will host a St. Nick's Party for children of the faculty, staff, and administration. The party will be held in the LaFortune ballroom Santa Claus, a magician, elves, Kris Kringle, and the Glee Club will be on hand to celebrate the Feast of St. Nicholas, who is the patron saint of children. 
Over 400 persons attended last year's party and Griffin expects a large attendance this year. "I'd like to emphasize that everyone is invited to out Christmas celebra­tion," he said. 
The Glee Club will be spreading some Christmas cheer again this year by caroling in the women's dormitories. They are planning a 30 minute Christmas concert in 
each women's residence on Wed­
nesday. Tom Conlin, a member of 
the club, said, "It's our way of 
introducing the Christmas spirit to 
a lot of women, who might never 
have the opportunity to hear the 
Glee Club sing." 

The Glee Club will also host a 
Christmas concert on Wednesday, 
Dec. 13 at 8 p.m. in Washington 
Hall. "We've planned a special 
surprise for everyone to see and 
hear," Conlin added. The one hour 
program will be free. 

The Notre Dame Chorale, Chapel Choir and Glee Club are planning an Advent Vespers celebration for Sunday at 4 and 7;30 p.m. in Sacred Heart Church. The pro· gram will highlight "Carpentier's Magnifica.'' Conlin called the concert "a chance for the Notre Dame music· community to put together a major work related to the Advent season." 
Several dormitories are also planning Christmas events. Sandy Br;mdt, president of Bree-Phillips, described her hall's scheduled week of activities. The girls drew the names oftheir Kris Kringles for a gift exchange in section meetings on Sunday. The door decorating contest begins today. A winner will be judged by the hall fellows and will be awarded a pri.ze at the end of the week. On Tuesday night, the girls will put their shoes out in front of their doors for the Rector's Assistants to fill with candy. 
The activities continue on Wed nesday, St. Nicholas' Day, when each girl will give $0.25 for her Kris Kringle to donate to a special fund. The money was traditionally do· nated to the Hunger Coalition fund, but this year it will be given to a group of Indian children in South Dakota, who are badly in need of eyeglasses. 
The activities wi11 culminate on Saturday with a parade of candles to the dorm mass and a hall dinner in the North Dining Hall. 
Morriss-;:y residents will cele­brate Christmas this coming Fri­day, with their traditional talent show. The activity will be preceed· ed by an informal dinner in each section and a dorm mass. The talent show will feature skits put on by each section. There will also be an emcee, a prize for the best skit, and a guest appearance by Santa Claus, according to hall President Ken Kadleck. 
Badin Hall is having a "Surprise (Screw) Your Neighbor" party to celebrate the Christmas season. Mary Margaret Bleyer, a member of the hall's Social Commission, said that each girl will be in charge of choosing a date for another g1rl to go to the hall Christmas party this Saturday. Bleyer added, ''This is the tirst time we're trying this type of a party. I think it will be a good 'time and we expect good hall participation.'' 
Jim Veraldi, sophomore class president, stated ''Because of the poor response to our class Christ· mas party at the Come and Dine restaurant (scheduled for last night), the dinner was canceled." Instead, the Sophomore Class is hosting an informal get together this Friday night in the LaFortune Ballroom from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. 
'This will be a place to go after studying to meet friends, have refreshments and listen to Christ­mas music," Veraldi explained. 



Sr. Nelligan travels to Rome to attend UISG meeting 
by Margie Brassfl Staff Reporter 

Sr. Kathleen Anne Nelligan, superior general of the Holy Cross Sisters of Saint Mary's, recently attended a meeting in Rome of the Union of International Superior Generals. 550 superior generals from six continents represented their orders and the sisters of their countries at the meeting. 
This is the eighth year that the 
U.I.S.G. has met. It is a means for the sisters to discuss topics dealing with their work, faith and life in relation to their region. They discuss a different topic every year

and different sisters attend. 

According to Nelligan, this year's topic, entitled: "Women Religious at the Service of a New Humanity"' dealt with the role of religious in raising the conscious­ness of the new humanity in their work. 
Based on a q uestionaire the answered before meeting in Rome, the sisters first discussed how they saw the world today in their individual countries and situations. Nelligan remarked there was such a diversified group present that the answers and discussion gnerated a wide variety of ideas and reponses among the sisters. 
Nelligan explained that the meeting was divided into three phases. The first phase looked at past history to see the major changes in humanity and how the Church responded to these changes. 
Nelligan referred to the role of missionaries as an example. "The past thought was the Western Civilization was best, and when the Church went into foreign countries they tried to impress Western ways and life on them, rather than seeing what was good in their own culture and helping them to ad· vance through their culture." Now, because of books and re­search and realizing the mistakes that were made, they can utilize this information so as not to make the same mistakes. 
The meeting dealt with the realization that upon entering the Era of Technology the world has also entered a new era of history and the role of the Church must change in order to bring a relevant Christain dimension to the times. 
The second and third phases of the meeting dealt with how nuns should respond to their awareness of the new humanity, and the new humanity itself·its formative pro· cess and traits. 
The meeting pointed out, accord­ing to Nelligan. ·'that we are living in the time of the Risen Christ, yet no one really knows what that means.'· In discussing the role of

to football rivalry with Dillon\ 
by Leslie Brinkley 

Many incidents of destruction over the \Veekend were linked to the rivalry between Keenan and Dillon Hails. prior to their champ­ionship interhall football game yesterday afternoon. With a score of 10-0, Dillon emerged the victor. although they were blamed for numerous broken windows and the injury of a Keenan resident on Friday night. 
Kevin Dolan, president of Keenan hall, claimed that most of the dorm attended the Keenan Revue (Friday) evening, and when they returned to the hall afterwards they found many broken windows. Students who had remained in the dorimtory explained that a group of people, saying they were from Dillon, pelted the building with snowballs. 
One second floor resident was 

"beaten up," according to Dolan, 
and immediately taken to the 
infirmary. although he sustained 
no serious injuries. 
On the other hand, Dillon Pres­ident, Marty Paulson, cited many broken windows in his hall and attributed them to Keenan. An­other possibly related incident included a power failure in Dillon on Saturday night after someone apparently threw the main switch, 
atcording to Paulson. 
When questioned about the in­jury, Paulson responded, "I got a call about it, but I don't know who did it or if it was a Dillon guy. A group of about 70 guys from here 
went to Keenan Friday night, but·! ·another dorm was after Keenan 
too." 
During the dinner hour on Satur­
day, 200 Dillon residents invaded 
the North Dining Hall. Paulson 
described the scene as a "good 
exhibition of hall spirit. It was 
organized--we staged a little pep rally. but there was no food fight. We tried to keep it under control. I'm sure security is glad the game is over." 
Referring to the football match. Dolan claimed that ''no one in Keenan feels that the team let us down. It's just unfortunate that the 
weather was so bad.  Dillon played  
a good game."  
To  celebrate  the  win,  Dillon  
residents planned  a  victory party  

last night at Kubiak's.

ND Club to show hospitality 
by Michael FraUey 
fhe Texas Club of Notre Dame plans to treat all Dallas-bound ND students to some "southern hos­pitality" during the upcoming Cotton Bowl football weekend. according to Texas· Club president Roman Macia. The Cotton Bowl Student activities will be co­sponsored by the Texas Club and the ND Alumni Club of Dallas. 
"We have a lot of activities planned for the Cotton Bowl week­end that should really make for an enjoyable time for all of the students," Macia said. "I'm very confident that our program will be successful and that we can carry on the ND spirit--Texas style." 
Macia outlined the many activi­ties which the Texas Club has planned for the Cotton Bowl week­end. 
A "Welcome to Texas" cocktail party at the Reunion Tower of the Hyatt Regency in Dallas will kick off the bowl weekend. The party is scheduled for Dec. 30 at 5:30 p.m. The following night, a New Year's Eve party will take place at the Dallas Convention Center. 
Following  the  game  on  New  
Year's Day.  the Texas  Club  has  
scheduled  a  "victory  party"  at  

4804 Dorset Road in Dallas. The 
Conference 
attendees 
to lecture 
A meeting for those interested in "Women in the Church: Ministry/ Ordination" will be held this afternoon in the Memorial Library Lounge at l :30. There will be several presentations by attendees of the Women's Ordination Confer­ence in Baltimore. Bishop McManus, of the Fort Wayne­South Bend Diocese, will also be present. 
 

party will begin at 9 p.m. and all are invited to attend. Head­quarters for ND activities in Dallas will be at the Hyatt Regency, and Macia urges that anyone who has a question about what to do in Dallas to contact the hotel. 
Macia also revealed that a brunch, barbeque dinner, and ND dance are tentatively scheduled for the weekend, but plans have yet to be finalized. Maps of the Dallas area are also to be distributed this Thursday afternoon in Lafortune Student Center. 
"We have planned a lot of fun for our feno·w students at the Cotton Bowl," Macia said. "We hope that through all these activi­ties we can bring the community together while in Texas. 
This is the first year of organi­zation for the ND Texas Club and so far, Macia noted, things have been quite successful for the new group. Along with the scheduled Cotton Bowl activities, the club has sponsored happy hours as well as travel services for the University's Texas students.

Catholics: 

the other religion? 
Dear Editor: 

Allow me to interject some humor to your day. The Office of Campus Ministry, that prized cita­del of liberal thought, in their commendable effort to embrace all members of the Notre Dame com­munity regardless of their reli­gious, political, social, moral, etc. persuasion, have asked students to fill out a form entitled: "Religious Preference Sheet". I quote: ''Campus Ministry Staff wishes to know your religious preference. We feel that your input is an important service for our informa­tion. We can use this knowledge to better meet the spiritual needs of the Notre Dame community. Below you will find a list of different faiths. Please "X" the blank to the left of your preference. There is also a space labeled "Other", in the event that your preference has 
Violence, to Americans has become 
as natural and unavoidable as the 
four seasons. Perhaps because this 
nation was founded by the sword, 
we have lost all respect for violent 
occurrences. Of course we are 
genuinely shocked when five 
people are butchered in an ambush 
in Guyana, but beneath this veneer 
of shock lies a generally lethargic 
view towards the act itself. We cry 
for those dead just as if they had 
died in an earthquake. We see this 
tragedy as "inhuman" and "unciv­
ilized'', yet we fail to realize how 
human it really is. 

Our acceptance of violence evolved from our American value system. A 62 year-old member of the People's Temple responded to the death of his wife who was one of the 900 cultists who participated in the murder suicide in Guyana: "Naturally I felt quite badly about it, but you can't cry over spilled milk." It is this fatalistic attitude towards violence and death in general that reveals the super­ficiality of his--and our--values which represshim from expressing any sympathy towards his wife. To him, she has become no more than a quart of homoginized milk! 
What does it take for the 
not been listed here. In that case, 
we ask you to pleas write in your 
preference ... " 

Imagine my surprise when I read 
down the list, and instead of finding ''Catholic", the list goes from Buddhism to Christian Meth­dist Episcopal. I then thought my religious preference would be listed under the "R's", for "Roman Catholic." But instead, I find the list goes from Quaker to Seventh Day Adventist. Yes, you guessed it, I had to mark the box ·entitled "Other", and then I wrote in Roman Catholic, all the time looking about me lest someone see me marking the "Other" box and thinking that I was a member of 
some fanatical cult! I I 

Some of you may find this 
humorous, others may find it Sikh. 
Speaking of Sikh (sic?), I've never 
heard of that religion, nor have I 
ever heard of Eckankar ... but then 
I'm just a plain old Catholic, at a 
Catholic school, so what do I know 
anyway? 

John Claude 
witnessed a cameraman's brain get blown out of his head and splatter on an NBC minicam? How can we condemn Jim Jones for giving his followers values that led them to their deaths when we do not criticize our own vaiues that led young boys to die in the swamps of Vietnam? To me, both sets of values are equally demented, yet because we ·do not evaluate our precepts and perceive the death mask behind them, we will contin­ue to lead our sons to their graves to the tune of the National Anthem. 
We are told that Notre Dame affords the student with not only a strong academic background but a moral fiber which will guide his life along a just path. This moral fiber should be achieved by a reevalua­tion of our principles and a synthe­sising of those principles which are then deemed morally correct. It saddens me to see students who are blind to those values which enforce the declension of their existence. They continue to men· tally follow the same paths laid down by others just as they follow the wire-enclosed paths on campus. If once in a while they would step over that wire and judge 
Record store decision questioned.. 
Deu Editor: 

I wish to endorse your November 30th editorial: "Better Reasons Needed" for Fr. Wolvlear's deci­sion against the Student Union record store proposal. I urge you to continue pressing the point, re­spectfully, but forcefully. My suspicion is that the real reason was not given you at all, as I do not see it alluded to or countered in your editorial. is the real reason not wanting to cut into bookstore profits? If that is the case, it would be a shame. Such a situation would constitute a monopoly, and the Ch.urch.has some serious things to say against the evils of monopolies. 
Worse than that, it would be a shame to find out you weren't dealt with honestly. Too many intelli­gent people seem to feel the whole story has not been told, truthfully, or that the administration is simply protecting its own by not permit­ting any reasonable competition to the bookstore (whose record selec­tion, even at discount prices, would leave so much to be desired). 
If the above suspicion is wrong on my part, I'd like to hear it plainly and clearly that my unmen­tioned reason was not the real reason in all this. As it stands now, too few people remain convinced by Fr. Wolvlear's reasons. Reason that is clear to so few is generally considered suspect. If there isn't a fly in the ointment here some· where, the burden is now on Father to take whatever pains necessary to make that crystal clear. 
The Church suffers when her people feel her priests have been less than clear and honest. I am not saying Father was unclear intentionally or dishonest. I am saying too many doubts linger about the integrity and honesty of the decision as presented. That's why the decision has to be addres­sed anew. The existence, or lack of it, of a new record store around here isn't going to be remembered for generations to come, really. What is going to be remembered for years to come, however, is whether our students leave this place with the clear impression that her priests were honest and fair and consistent. That's why I urge more clarity from Fr. Wolvlear--to restore his own integrity and that of priests and the Church every­where. If the decision is to stand, let us be told more clearlv, if at all possible. Or, let us· have a retraction of the decision. Either way, I believe some apology is in order for causing such doubts in the minds of so many, which has also reflected adversly on priestly leadership in the Church. 
Fr. Dennis D. Evenson 
...and not left to die 
Dear Editor: 

Sine~ the proposal for a student­run record store has been rejected, being against Father Van Wol­vlear's principles and due to the student's lack of competency to run such an operation (which is obvious unless you look at things like Flanner Records and everything else done by the Student Union), we are left with three choices for buying records. First, we can find a car or take a bus to an off-campus store. This is great if you have an hour or two between classes. Second, we can go to Planner Records, which is on campus. I'm afraid this won't be possible next year, since they've been ordered to close down at the end of the school 
DOONESBURY 

year. The final choice is the 
bookstore's record selection. It is 
located right in the middle of the 
campus, so it's easy to hop in and 
pick up a record. 

This last choice is only accep­table if you can tolerate an operation which often ignores the tastes of college students (I haven't noticed many fighting for Shaun Cassidy or Donny and Marie), which takes weeks to stock "new" releases, and which charges almost full Jist prices on all albums except those which nobody buys. It is obvious that the bookstore is a poor solution to our record needs. (Yes, needs. Try going without music for a week.) 
Since a well-rasearched and feasible Student Union proposal hasn't shown the administration that we want a better deal and improved service in records, I suggest we boycott the bookstore's record department until the situation is improved. In the meantine, we can try forming a record co-op to get improved prices and selection. 
As Bill Roche said, "I don't consider the issue to be dead." We shouldn't let it die. 
Sincerely, 
Brendan Fagan

There are ntany things that stand oat in one's mind after seeing the NDSMCTheatre's production of his 1971 
··drama uAll Over; but perhaps the most powerful is the ''in the round.. staging and the force with which that staging requires the audience to take an active part in a rather uncomfortable subject--death. 
The point of the play is dear. An individual's death is an intrinsic part of his life, and, indeed, the difference between the two may only be one ofdegree. Jnthe. face of another's death, one reflects on ooe's own life in such a way as to lay naked the self-centeredness of those reflections. The characters--in their reflection··all come to some frightening realizations about the emptiness of their own lives, lives that are rushing headlong toward a sometimes obscure, but always present. ultimate conclusion. Albee deals with death and selfishnes sin a fairly non­judgemental way. The judgement is left up to the audience. 
The audience, in fact, is the silent character in the play. Set in the l'ound with actors interspersed among the audience, the action takes place within the close . physical proximity of everyone present. The set on which the audien~e participates is the room of a man who lays dying. The man, and his approaching death for that matter, is quite peripheral to the play. But. even though we never actually see him, he becomes the foil against which the charcters measure their meager, empty lives and rail, moan, whine and weep in a desperation not so much for him as for themselves. 1t is a dark play, and this is the first thing one senses. The presence of death rather quickly takes a back seat to the agony of the dying--a group that includes both the characters and the audience--who realize that "death" is mostly a matter of degree. They are forced to measure theirlives in terms of dreams. hopes nad aspirations that have long since died, and then determine to what degree death has taken hold of them. At issue here, as was pointed out by _the dying man's mistress, is whether the state of death takes a verb of being (i.e. When will he be dead?). She points out that he once corrected her on the matter of grammar-­one cannot "be" dead since it is an absolute condition in which one either Is or Is not.

The Notre Dame student who get bombed on a weekend may reveal more than he/she realizes in the admission, ''I was feeling no pain!" 
Pain is an unavoidable consequence of the human condition. It's painful to be alive; painful to get up in the morning, face the day with its challenges, open up in vulnerability to other people, confront honest questions about yourself and what you're doing with your life. 
C.S. Lewis was right: "Pain insists upon being attended to." We are forced to deal with pain, lh< with it, try to ride it through. 
It's necessary 1.. ~the maturing process. When we can't understand this, we get caught up in all kinds of escape mech­anisms in an effort to kill the pain. But all efforts to avoid the inevitable pain of facing life head-on are doomed to failure. 
Fr. John Dunne tells a fascinating story, the "Parable of the Mountain." In it he describes a man climbing a mountain at the top of which, he thinks, is God. By climbing the mountain, by reaching God, man anticipates that he will leave the pain of his shallow, empty life behind, in the valley from which he has escaped. But while he climbs, God is coming down the mountain, down into the valley, down amidst the toil and grief. In the mists of the mountain, God and man pass one another. 
When man reaches the mountain top he will find nothing. God is not there. What then will he do? He realizes his climb was a mistake. But what now? Agony and despair? Or will he turn to retrace his path. through the mists, into the valley, to where God has gone seeking him? 
"Where God has gone seeking him" ·­this is the key. This is the very heart of our faith. Religion is not so much our quest for God, but God's search for us. That is what it means to be a Chosen People. Not that by some piety or accomplishment we have raised ourselves up over other people t(l a

place of eminence,-but that, in spite of our frailties and betrayals, God reaches out to choose us. 
We object: That's not our experience. being chosen like that. Our experience is just the opposite. We are much more aware of NOT being chosen. Like the seniors who go through the job-interview­routine, and don't get chosen. The many students not chosen formed school, dental, school, law school. The students during room-pick-time who don't get chosen by anyone; or the ones never asked to a formal or hall party or concert; or those who don't even hear an occasional, "Do you want to go over to lunch?" 
All of us know that experience of not being chosen. It's something we endure throughout life. Remember, for example, how it was when you were a child? There were so may occasions of choosing. When boys in grade school, for instance, would choose up sides for softball. 
You'd stand in the schoolyard with a mob of about twenty others, and the two captains would start choosing sides. As names were called out, and yours wasn't one of them, it really got to you. Since selection was on the basis of talent and ability. not being chosen said something about you, what others thought of you. I can remember standing there. praying that my name would be called. The worst experieQce of all, of course, was to be left at the end, especially when the sides were even without you. Then it really got humiliating. One captain would say, "I've got all I need; you talc:.e him." And the other would respond, "No. that's all right; you can have him." 
In the midst of these recollections of how often we are not chosen, God would have us believe that He doesn't operate that way. He chooses each of us by name; we are each chosen first, and there are no condttlons whatsoever. We find this hard 
. to swallow. It's difficult to believe God

most pleasant contrasts to the other'a somber heart wrenching, in their roles as the doctor and nurse. 
Three observations seem in order. First, this is the first all student ND-SMC Theatre production, and, without question, it is a smashing success. Second, the high caliber of the play they have taken on, the acting, directing and set forces one to the realizaiton that this theatre company has arrived in the big leagues. There is little doubt in my ming thafthey could hold their own in comparison to such attention getting peers as the Yale Repertory Theatre.

would choose us, since we have so many experiences of not being chosen by anyone else --even ourselves. 
Of course, there is that strange man, Jesus, who was always choosing "the unchoosable." He constantly sought out the hurting, suffering, featful, ordinary women and men, whose lives, more often than not, appeared futile and directionless. 
Take the good thief. I like to think that, in some way, he stands for each of us. He too had been running away from the pain of life, thinking that this was the way to find happiness. What a mess he had made of it! And yet his yearning, I strspect, was like that of a poet, Anne Sexton, who, in her collection of poems entitled The Awful Rowing Toward God, wrote: 
And God was there like an island I had not rowed to, still ignorant of Him, my arms and legs worked, and I grew, I grew, I wore rubies and bought tomatoes and now, in my middle age, about nineteen in the head I'd say I am rowing, I am rowing 

All the time the good thief had been searching for happiness, he didn't know that Happiness had been looking for him. That's why the story of this bandit is the story of many of us: the quest for happiness (or escape from pain) is the quest for God; but He is the one who always finds us .first. And that is why Christianity is good news: We don't pursue happiness; Happiness pursues us! 
He longs for us, searches us out. We have been found, where we are --in the valley··-because that's where He wants to be, too. He shares our cross (our suffering, confused, hurting humanity). Indeed, He is within us, trying to say, "Hang on, we're going to glory .. together!"

AMA denies 
any conspiracy 

to fix price& 
CIDCAGO [AP]-The President of the American Medical Association vowed yesterday that his organiza­tion will go all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary to overturn a Federal Trade Commis­sion ruling that the AMA has conspired to fix prices. 
Dr. Tom E. Nesbitt of Nashville, Tenn., stated the organization's position as the 336-member house of delegates, the AMA policy­making body, opened its four-day winter session. 
"We intend to fight because the AMA is a private, voluntary associ­ation, and not an involuntary extension of the ITC," he said. 
"We intend to fight because state and local medical societies are free and independent organizations over which the AMA was not, does not, and should not have author­ity." 
He referred to a ruling last week by an FTC judge which held that the AMA has caused medical bills to go up by prohibiting doctors from advertising. 
Judge Ernest G. Barnes said the AMA's policy against doctors' advertising for patients, adopted early this century to stamp out medical quackery, has evolved into a way of assuring big profits for physicians. 
He ordered the 200,000 member

Chicago, to rescing its rules that

Tornado sweeps 



southern states 
BOSSIER CITY, La. [AP] -A tornado ravaged this northwest Lousiana ,city yesterday and other twisters touched down in Arkansas and Mississippi, killing at least four persons and injuring more 
than  250.  About  140 National  
Guardsmen  were  called  in  to  
patrol.  

Among the dead were two young sisters, kiHed here by a car thrown through the wall of their home as they slept. 
The twisters spun out from a band of violent thunderstorms that spread over the Southeast. The damage in Bossier City alone was estimated at $100 million. 
"It's unvelievable the kind of damage we have out here," said Marvin Anding, mayor of the city of 60,000 persons near Shreveport. "It's just total devastation." 
The dead girls were identified as 13-year-old Lisa Currington and her 8-year-old sister, Jana. A brown compact car lay on its back in what had been their bedroom. 
''They were in their room and this car came flying at the house," said a man identified as the girls' uncle. "It came down on their room and crushed them in their bed.'' 
Mike Liles, an Arkansas resident who was in Bossier City, said he was watching television about 2 
a.m. when he heard the tornado. 

"I went to the door and I saw it wrap the gas station around a pole,'' he said. The small self­service station across the street was a pile of rubble.

windows." 
In Alumui, freshman Bill Nortz was struck on the forehead by glass when his bedroom window was broken, all but one of which were bedroom windows. Rozun1 also added thc..t no one was seriously hurt. Rozum estimated that most of the damage was done on Friday between 12 p.m. and 2 a.m. 
In Keenan, 10 windows were shattered and one student was badly beaten up. The student, a freshman, was taken to the infir­mary where he was JC-rayed and held for observation. Fr. Conyers, Keenan rector, felt that the trouble may have been due to the inter-hall football game between Keenan and Dillon. 
Conyers said tl' at he had filed a complaint with tre inter-hall foot­ball office and would also file one w:th the Dean of Students. "There W;tS nothing playful about it," he said. "C\lmpetition is fine but when it comes to damaging proper­
ty or inflicting injury, we have to 
draw the line," Conyers said. 
Most of the damage to Keenan 

happened en Frid<\y at 11:30 p.m. 
and Saturday at 6 p.m. Conyers 
estimates damage ot be about 
$180. 
Fr. Tallarida, Zahm rector, also 

said cha1 Di Ion wa; responsible for 
the damage. "Th : troubl:! started

One windo"' was shattered in Zahm 
but uo one ·va~ hurt. 
In Lyons Hall a small fire broke out this week£·nd which destroyed a mattress and caus{'d some smoke damage. According to Karen Caruso, the second floor R.A., the fire occured at 4 a.m. on Saturday. 
According to reports, one of the student apparently did not extin­guish her cigaretta completely and, in her sleep, knocked the ashtray 
"Onto the bed. When girls above on 
the third floor smelled the smoke 
the rector was notified, as there was not security guard on duty that night. 
The fire department and security were also notified, but fire trucks were not sent out because the fire was quickly put uner control. No one was hurt and security report­edly did not think it necessary to take any of the girls to the infirmary. "We were lucky the girls on the third floor woke up," Caruso said. 

Sr. ViviaJI Whitehead, Breen­Phillips rector, said, "I've never seen the campus quite this way on a Friday nighl. Everyone was on campus. It seemed that no one went out; they stayed here to play." 
Luther said, "students throwing SllVwballs at 1uildings are a very serious problem." He asked that students keep the snowball fights out in the open on the quad and away from windows. He stressed that the potential for real physical damage does exist and that stu­denta should be more careful. 
OC causes handicaps, benefits 
[continued from page 1] "Living off campus would be great," he quipped, "I'd be free to do my own laundry and to buy and cook my own food, and an those other wonderful things I'm not able to do now.'' Speaking in a more serious tone, the student continued, "I spend most of my time trying to stay caught up around here. If I had to take all the extra time involved in traveling, house cleaning, cooking, washing clothes and dishes, my grades would hurt or I'd get no sleep." He concluded, ''I might be a lot freer off campus, but I would like to see the correlation off-campus living has with a student's aver­age." D'Antonio however, a student who finished his undergraduate work on campus but now lives off campus, said that he believed students' grades would get better. He pointed out that when a student lives on campus, the 
academic pressures are constantly 
looming over him or her and 
everywhere he or she look are the 
reminders of the pressures. "Liv­
ing off campus helps to make you 
more than a student; living in a 
total student environment can 
cause you to become stale,'' he 
said. 
D'Antonio also said that living off campus was a good way to unwind since one can break away from the books. ''When you close the books there is nobody around you studying, making you feel guilty or pressured to study, or remind you of your work," he added. . 
He also said that the reason that there has been so much talk about the problems is to show students that they can get help. "Problems are the exception. not the rule," he assured. 
The last time students were Iotteried off campus was 1974. In that case the lottery wasn't final­ized until March. .\ _grad student recalled the campus reaction. "The students' reaction then was much the same as the students' reaction now, only more vocal," he 
said. 
Kevin Rochford, a Jaw student who also spent his ftrst four years on campus, commented, ''Many students are rebelling against the move off campus simply because the idea of having a lottery sug­gests that they're being forced off." 
Rochford added, ''A mistake was made, but not the question is not who's guilty, but what's the solu­tion.'' 
''Five years ago," D'Antonio concluded, "no foresight was exer­cised. so today we have a problem. The University is stuck, and we detinitd!' tH~ed a long-term solu­tion, be~t :-_ should not be half­baked. It should be handled carefully.

Blacks to cast votes on key South African election day 
'HNDHOEK. South-West Africa [APJ  Blacks in this South African-administered territory vote for the first time Monday in elections for a bi-racial legislature. But key opposition groups have called for a boycott of the polls. contl.!nding the balloting is rigged to favor white-dominated oarties. 
South Africa, meanwhiie. sig­naled it is ready to go along with 
U.N. 
demands for later, U.N.­supervised elections. 

U.N. 
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheiin said yesterday in New York that South African officials had told him they would "retain authority" in the territory until such U.N. elections are held there early next year. 


The move apparently was calcu­lated to allay fears that South Africa would turn over power here to the winners of this week's elections, who then might be unwilling to authorize further elec­tions. 
The South Africans had said previously only that they would encourage the new territorial government to agree to a later vote overseen by the United Nations. They say this week's voting is a prelude to independence. 
The United Nations has de manded that South Africa give up 
·control of the territory and put the government into the hands of the black majority through inter~a­tionally administered elections. 
Sam Nujoma, head of the South West Africa People's Organization, has ordered his insurgents to disrupt the voting, claiming the

White-governed South Africa insists the election will be fair and invited about 200 Western corres­pondents to observe it. The liberal, bi-racial Namibia National Front, like SWAPO, has cailed on its followers not-to vote. 
Impartial ~'bservers here believe South Africa decided to go ahead with the five-day elections in the belief that the vote would demon­strate to the United Nations that the pro-Pretoria, white-led but multi-racial Democratic Turnhalle Alliance has the greatest political support.

JERUSALEM [AP]  The majori­ty of the Israeli Cabinet was reported· yesterday favoring a re­sumption of the stalled Washington peace talks based on the U.S.­proposed target date of late 1979 for moving toward ~alestinian autonomy in occupied lands. 
Semi-official Israeli Radio said no formal decision was made at the Cabinet meeting but most minis­ters were inclined toward reopen­ing talks. The question of linking an Egyptian-IsraeH treaty to Pales­tinian self-rule through some kind of timetable has been the major stumbling block to a settlement. 
President Anwar Sadat of Egypt has announced his country's ac­ceptance of the U.S. target date proposal in a letter to President Carter. But the Israelis have balked at setting· such firm guide­lines, saying it could lead the Egyptians to abrogate the entire treaty if a timetable for Palestinian autonomy is not met. 
The U.S. proposal calls for setting the end of 1979 as a target date for moving toward Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank of the 
· Jordan River and the Gaza Strip. It also calls for language in the treaty preamble affirming the two na­tions'· commitment to eventual Palestinian autonomy. Israel has accepted the preamble language but not the target date idea. 
Last week, Sadat sent a secret letter to Israeli Prime Minister Mehachem Begin about the dead locked talks. Begin yesterday began drafting a letter in response.
