UNITED NATIONS (APJ ­Security Couneil ambassadors on Wmlnesday predicted adop­tion of a resolution allowing use of military force to liberate Kuwait if 450,000 Iraqi troops do not withdraw by .Jan. 15. 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told re­portt~rs on arriving in New York, "Either we will build civi­liztHI relations between states, a nnw world order and new pol­icy, or will live by the law of the jungh1. 
"That is the question we must answer tomorrow (Thursday), and I believe we will answer it." 
Cuba opposes the measure hut expects it to pass. "It is quite obvious that the resolu­tion will be adopted," Cuban Ambassador Hicardo Alarcon said. 
The only otlwr time the United Nations sanctioned mili­tary force to counter aggression was in 1950, during the Korean conflict. 
ThirttHl!l of the 15 council members are expected to be representnd by foreign minis­t11rs, making it one of the high­est-love) such sessions in U.N. history. 
China had indicated it would support th11 mnasure but shifted its position Wednesday. Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said he would not vote in favor. 
Tlw statement was widely ViPwnd as a move to win politi­eal eoneessions from Washington. whieh acted to punish Beijing after the June 
Iraq to receive deadline from Security Council members 
by Iraqi authorities since their invasion of Kuwait has posed a direct challenge to the purposes for which this organization was founded .... 
"Iraq's policy must fail. As members of the United Nations we are all bound, by our char­ter obligations, to oppose Iraq's policy, accomplish the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, and to obtain the re­establishment of Kuwaiti authority. May that day come shortly." 
The draft resolution gives Iraq a final chance to withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15. After that, the measure authorizes "all necessary means" to dis­lodge the Iraqi forces. 
The measure also calls on Iraq to free all foreign hostages and restore the rule of the Kuwaiti royal family. 
Baghdad has ignored a series of U.N. resolutions demanding it withdraw from Kuwait, which Iraq overran Aug. 2. 
"There is political will to adopt another resolution," said Canadian Ambassador Yves Fortier. "I predict that an addi­tional resolution will be adopted." 
The British envoy said the measure "provides a breathing space of time for thought by Saddam Hussein to reflect re­ally carefully on what would follow if he didn't come into line with the Security Council resolutions by the date fixed in the resolution." 
Donations needed for 1+1+1 goal

News Writer 
The Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Community has just one more day to donate food, clothing, and books to the nearly 16,000 needy South Bend families through the 1+1+1 Project. 
The goal of this project is to have everyone in the community donate one non­perishable food item, one article of clothing, and one children's book to this cause. This program is designed to provide needy families and homeless people with items to brighten their Christmas. 
Also, in conjunction with Project 1+1+1, a mass for the homeless will be held tonight in the Keenan­Stanford ehapel at 7 p.m. 
The idea for this project came from Student Government Social Concerns Co-Commissioners Barb lzzo, Dave Krier, and Sean Scanlon. It is their hope that this program will increase awareness of the plight of the homeless and needy. 
Donations are still being accepted in the Student Government offices in LaFortune, through Friday. The items will be taken to St. Vincent DePaul's, where they will be distributed.

Chief accuser of 'Keating Five' faces tough questions 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The 
chief accuser of the "Keating 
Five" senators was forced to 
defend both his testimony and 
his honor under rigorous cross­
examination Wednesday. 
Despite the barrage of hostile 
questioning, Edwin Gray, 
former head of the Federal 
Home Loan Bank Board, stuck 
to his previous day's testimony 
in Senate Ethics Committee 
hearings. 
Gray insisted that Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., proposed a deal on behalf of S&L owner Charles Keating and three other senators acquiesced. Gray said the offer was made at an April 2, 1987 meeting arranged by a fifth senator who did not attend. 
The committee is trying to determine whether the five sen­ators intervened improperly on behalf of Keating because of the $1.3 million he and associates donated to their campaigns and causes. 
The other senators are Alan Cranston, D-Calif., John Glenn, D-Ohio, John McCain, R-Ariz. and Donald Riegle, D-Mich. Riegle did not attend the April 2 meeting. 
Gray was still on the witness stand when the hearing ad­journed Wednesday and was asked to return Thursday for a fourth day. 
The lawyer representing DeConcini, James Hamilton, 
often shouted his questions at 
Gray as he tried to cast doubt 
on the alleged deal. Hamilton 
pointed out that all four sena­
tors at the meeting denied that 
DeConcini offered the quid pro 
quo for Keating, who wanted 
Gray to withdraw a rule that 
adversely affected the political 
donor's Lincoln Savings and 
Loan. 
The attorney for Cranston, William Taylor, got more per­sonal. He brought up Gray's acceptance of expense money from the thrift industry he reg­ulated. 
Taylor reminded Gray that he attended one industry-financed dinner for which the tab was $1,158.63, including $300 for wine and $91.45 for cigars. 
"These practices had been standard for 20 to 25 years," Gray said, adding it was wrong for the thrift industry to wine and dine regulators and he stopped the practice. 
And he said of the deal that he insists was offered: "I felt the whole setting and the re­quest itself was wrong. Just plain wrong. I never had seen anything like this in my entire tenure as a regulator, and I feel that way today." 
Hamilton forced Gray to ac­knowledge that he knew more about Keating's S&L problems than he indicated to the four senators.

U.S. takes right position in Gulf crisis 
I saw him the other day when I was out running on U.S. 31. The old soldier sits out there every day in front of his American flags, proud to wear the hat that identifies him as a former sol-Rich Kurz dier for the United States of America. Sports Copy Editor 
He is a symbol of what it means to be an American. He isn't afraid to show his loyalty and devotion to America, and for what this country is all about -freedom. 
The United States has taken flak for some of its recent adventures into foreign poli­tics, and despite the initial near-universal support of Operation Desert Shield, some people have begun to criticize the Bush Administration's decision to involve American citizens in a conflict taking place in some remote desert region of the world. 
Why? Some claim that we shouldn't. be meddling in the affairs of other countnes, or that simply keeping the price of oil low is no justification for putting the lives of our soldiers on the line. 
Anyone who subscribes. to either of these theories is missing the point entirely. The intent of Operation Desert Shield is not to keep us from paying a few more cents per gallon at the gas station. The fact is that the exiled Kuwaiti government wants the support of the U.S. in liberatin9 its. country. 
The true intent of the operatiOn IS to free a small, helpless country which cannot de­fend itself, and to keep an evil dictator from having the world in his hands. I~ Sadd<t:m Hussein is not kicked out of Kuwait he will control the price of oil in the Middle East, and therefore the world economy. 
Traditionally the U.S. has taken a leading role in defending the world against evil, and while that may sound a bit naive, that is ex­actly what we should be doing. 
If the United States of America, the land of the free and the home of the brave, wimps out on this opportunity to defend the 
very principles on which it was created, 
then all of those grand words contained in 
the Declaration of Independence and the 
Constitution mean nothing. 
This country was built on principles. Prin­
ciples of freedom and justice. On the princi­
ple that all men are guarantee? "the rig~t 

to life, liberty, and the pursmt of happi­
ness." 
What kind of hypocrite would the United 
States be if we promised that to our own 
people, but didn't care about the rights of 
any other country? How would that 
advance international cooperation? 
We as Americans should learn to be more 
like that man who sits on 31 all the time. 
We should believe in our country and the 
principles on which it was founded on, and 
we shouldn't be afraid to stand up to people 
who try to take those rights away.

Rep. Barney Frank. D-Mass.. completed his gradual return to work Wednesday as he attended a White House signing ceremony on housing legislation. Frank said his recovery from a mild heart attack on Nov. 17 will require him to give up weight lifting and cigar smoking but won't cut into his work on Capitol Hill. An 

awareness of his family history of heart trouble saved Frank's life when he felt chest pains and took himself to the hospital after working out at the Metropolitan Health Club in Boston. Doctors used balloon angioplasty to open a clogged coronary artery. 
The nation's infant death rate appears ~o be showing little or no improvement, the March of Dimes Defects Foundation said Wednesday. At the current rate of progress, the country will fail to meet the goal of the Public Health Service to reduce infant death to seven per 1,000 births by the year 2000, the foundation said. The_re were 38,910 deaths of infants under 1 year of age m 1988. The overall infant death rate in 1988, though the lowest ever recorded for the United States, conceals sharp differences between blacks and whites. The rate for white infants was 8.5 per 1,000 births while for black 
infants it was 17.6.

The Indiana state government hiring freeze that had been scheduled to expire on Saturday has been extended for three months, an administration official said Wednesday.

Evan Bayh, said the freeze will be ex­tended until March 1 because the current freeze ordered Sept. 5 hasn't produced "the kind of sav­ings that had been targeted originally." 
The Indiana Supreme Court upheld on Wednesday the murder conviction and 6~-ye~r sentence of a Williamsport man found gmlty m the beating death of a retarded man whose body was found buried under a barn floor.

Christmas at the mall 
Ice skaters circled a huge Christmas tree at the Galleria Mall in Dallas last Friday, the traditionally busiest retail day of the year. 
By KATE MANUEL News Writer 
The Indiana Easter Seal Society is selling a limited num­ber of "Christmas at Notre Dame" Ornaments of Hope, to raise money to help disabled children and adults in St. Joseph County. 
The "Christmas at Notre Dame" ornaments, made of gold and brass and showing the Golden Dome of the Administration Building, are limited edition collector's or­naments. Each was handcrafted at the Franklin Mint in South Carolina and comes with a numbered and signed certifi­cate of authenticity. 
The Golden Dome design will be used only on the 1990 edi­tion of the "Christmas at Notre Dame" Ornament of Hope and a new design will be selected each year, according to Richard Janishewski, President of the Indiana Easter Seal Society. 
The number of ornaments minted in future years will never exceed 10,000 of a par­ticular design, according to Janishewski. Because this is the first year for selling the orna­ments, however, he expects that no more than 1,500 Notre Dame ornaments will be minted for the 1990 collection. 
Nearly 500 of the $15 orna­ments have sold already, but additional ornaments could be minted if the Indiana Easter 
Indiana Easter Seal Society sells limited edition 'Golden Dome design' ornament 
Seal Society receives additional orders more than three weeks before Christmas, Janishewski said. "If people want the orna­ments, they should hurry. We could still order more and get them before Christmas." he said. 
The Indiana Easter Seal Society is also selling commem­orative ornaments featuring Purdue and Indiana University, but the Notre Dame ornaments are by far the best sellers, ac­cording to both Janishewski and Stan Williams, the member of the Indiana Easter Seal Society who first approached Notre Dame about the fundraiser. 
"Purdue and I.U. are also do­ing this for the first time, and it has only been done once before, at Penn State. Notre Dame is the best seller by far, the most popular," added Janishewski. 
"We have more freedom to talk about Christmas at Notre Dame. Students at this school really celebrate Christmas, so we are pleased to be able to say Christmas at Notre Dame," said Miller. "Nothing has been received quite so well as this Notre Dame ornament. We've had calls from all over the United States and Canada." 
Although this is the first year the Indiana Easter Seal Society has sold Christmas ornaments featuring Indiana universities, Williams expects sales to in­crease in future years. 
"This is the first year. Next year we expect to add about ten more universities in the state; we also offer city commemora­tive ornaments of South Bend and Mishawaka. We are the first state to fully immerse our­selves into universities. We ex­pect to grow by leaps and bounds next year." 
The first ornament in the series was presented to the University of Notre Dame and University President Father Edward Malloy at a press con­ference before Thanksgiving by Christopher Morris, a South Bend kindergartner who re­ceives help from Easter Seals with his cerebral palsy. 
The Indiana Easter Seal Society provides services that fall into three broad categories: 
•furnishing 
adaptive equip­ment which a family cannot af­ford and governmental agen­cies and insurance will not pro­vide. 

•assisting 
farmers with dis­abilities in returning to their profession. 

•running 
a camp providing camping experiences for per­sons with disabilities. 


Those wishing to order com­memorative ornaments can do so by picking up a brochure at one of over forty retail stores in South Bend, or by calling 1­800-966-4003 and placing a Visa or Master Card order.

STANFORD, Calif. (AP) ­Virginia Velez came to Stanford University seeking a safe place to live openly with her lesbian lover, but a policy expanding the rights of homosexual cou­ples on campus leaves her feel­ing threatened. 
Velez and others in the homo­sexual community fear a back­lash, particularly from religious groups. The policy, which began this fall, guarantees un­married couples the same housing, health care and cam­pus privileges as married cou­ples. 
''I'm getting nervous about what's going on," said Velez, a graduate student in education. "What the administration has done is satisfying. But the fun­damentalist groups -Islamic and Christian -are creating incredible tension, and they can erupt at any time." 
Stanford's effort to build a tolerant. diverse, body of inter­national students has led to verbal clashes and occasional harassment over attitudes about race, religion and sexual orientation. The latest involves the backlash to the "domestic partners" policy. 
"I think Stanford is probably one of the best places to be openly gay or lesbian or bisex­ual, and it's still scary," said Susan Mizner, a third-year law student and gay activist. 
"It's still got a number of people who I would un­abashedly call bigots, and even more people who would prefer not to deal with anyone they

Mid-westerners prepare for possible Dec. earthquake 
(AP)-Tavern owners jammed jukeboxes with earth-shaking tunes and worried residents squirreled away water and flashlights Wednesday as the questionable countdown pro­gressed for a major earthquake as early as next week on the New Madrid Fault. 
The commotion is over a pro­jection made by Dr. Iben Browning, who said there was a strong chance of a major earthquake Dec. 2-3 in an area that includes the New Madrid Fault, from Arkansas through Missouri to Illinois. 
"We're ready for it. I have 13 gallon jugs of water, blankets, two sleeping bags, a pipe wrench, canned food, a flash­light and a radio with extra batteries," said Debbie Brunk of Bonne Terre, Mo., which is about 50 miles from the New Madrid fault zone. 
Others took the projections a little more lightly. 
Bumper stickers saying "It's Iben Browning's Fault" have started popping up on cars in the region. 
One tavern owner has come up with a list of songs having to do with earthquakes. 
Joe Edwards, owner of the Blueberry Hill tavern in St. Louis, said he's filling his juke­box with earthquake songs and serving special drinks to "help our customers cope with any anxiety they might be feeling." 
He had culled more than 150 songs, including "Dancin' on the Ceiling," "Church Bells May Ring," "If We Make it Through December" and at least 13 titles containing the word "shake." 
Meanwhile, Iben Browning's daughter, Evelyn Garriss, stood by her father's projection after San Francisco radio station KCBS reported that she ·said her father believes there's a 50­50 chance of a major quake outside the United States. 
"We are less concerned about (San Francisco Bay area's Hayward fault) recently than we continue to be about some of the other places, like Japan," she said. 
know is gay, lesbian or bisex­ual." 
Two-thirds of the students said in an informal survey they support the new policy. Foreign students, particularly from the Middle East, Asia and Africa, are among the most vocal op­ponents. 
Of Stanford's 12,600 graduate and undergraduate students, nearly 2,500 are foreigners. Foreigners comprise about a quarter of the 6,100 graduate­student population, which dominates the married student housing village. 
University officials say they won't revoke the policy, which allows unwed couples with "long-term commitments" to rent low-cost campus apart­ments, and have "spouse" privi­leges, such as subsidized medi­cal care and access to the li­braries and gyms. 
The policy applies to six cou­ples this term. Officials expect the number to rise to 20 to 30 during the next few years. 
"We have a strong belief that what we did was the right thing to do," said Norm Robinson, dean of student affairs. "I think some of the (objections) that are based on religion also reflect quite a high degree of homophobia."

International Human Rights Day will be celebrated by each chapter worldwide, according to Dan Gallagher, a represen­tative of the local Amnesty International group. 
"On that day in particular," Gallagher said, "everyone on campus should express his or her views on human rights; the write-a-thon is one easy but important way." 
Amnesty International will be selling T-shirts at the write-a­thon. The sale is the group's largest fund raiser of the year. 
The profits will be used to fi­nance other projects, including speakers and international stu­dent panel discussions on tor­ture and human rights abuses in countries.

Intelligence study predicts that Yugoslavia will soon break apart, decline into civil war 
WASHINGTON (AP) -A CIA study predicts Yugoslavia will break apart soon and probably decline into civil war, official sources said Wednesday. 
One source, speaking on con­dition he not be identified, said members of the intelligence community "have been making dire predictions like that for some time" but that they are not shared by other foreign­policy specialists in the gov­ernment. 
An official who has read the most recent Central Intelligence Agency assessment, circulated several weeks ago in what is called a National Intelligence Estimate, said it predicts the

various ethnic groups that make up Yugoslavia will begin fighting each other in a sce­nario likely to lead to civil war. 
But that same official and another who is familiar with administration views on the is­sue said the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade, State Department specialists in Washington and Bush administration policy­makers don't agree the situa­tion is as serious as the CIA re­port indicates. 
These officials and others discussed the content of the CIA report on condition that they not be identified. 
Existence of the report was disclosed Wednesday by the New York Times, which quoted unidentified sources who had read it. 
Yugoslavia was created as an independent monarchy after World War I with the addition of various territories to the old kingdom of Serbia. It became a Communist-ruled federation after World War II, consisting of six republics with a long history of ethnic and economic rivalry. 
The country has more divi­sions among its people than most. Two alphabets are in use, the Roman and the Cyrillic. The Roman Catholic, the Eastern Orthodox and the Moslem faiths all have large followings.

Gray said he had received a memo from one of his staff in September 1986 detailing prob­lems at Lincoln. 
Despite the memo, Hamilton pointed out, Gray told the sena­tors he knew little of Lincoln's problems and suggested the se­nators question the staff mem­bers handling the examination of the failing Irvine, Calif. thrift. 
Each of the Senate partici­pants in the April 2 meeting said he could not recall a deal being offered on Keating's be­half. DeConcini has been most vehement in denying such a proposal was made. 
"Why should the American public believe you and not four prominent U.S. senators?" Hamilton asked Gray. 
"The American public can be­lieve whatever they will," a testy Gray responded. "I had nothing to gain by not telling the truth." 
Hamilton bore in on Gray's comment that "If my life de­pended on it," he could not an­swer senators' questions about the Lincoln examination be­cause he had little knowledge of the investigation. 
After establishing that the memo Gray received eight months earlier from a regulator contained much of the in­formation senators sought to know about Lincoln, Hamilton asked, "In hindsight, was it ir­responsible for you not to have 
Gorbachev asks Germans for emergency shipments of food to prevent shortages 
MOSCOW (AP) -The Soviet capital began dipping into its meat reserves, and President Mikhail Gorbachev met with a German envoy Wednesday to arrange emergency food ship­ments to help the Soviet Union get through the winter. 
Horst Teltschik, a top aide to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, told reporters he met with Gorbachev to ensure that a huge outpouring of German charity would not be wasted. 
In the past, shipments of im­ported food have disappeared into the Soviet black market and spoiled in rail cars for lack of trucks to take them to stores. 
Teltschik said Gorbachev agreed to expedite customs procedures and visas for the aid program. Similar steps were taken to smooth the flow of foreign relief after the December 1988 Armenian earthquake, which killed more than 25,000 people. 
The Soviet president also promised that Germans could accompany the aid deliveries and check that supplies were distributed properly, he said.

given" the memo to the sena­tors? 
Gray said he mentioned the memo to the senators at the meeting and they didn't ask for a copy. 
And he added he did not re­gret his decision, telling Hamilton: "The real purpose (of the meeting) in my mind was not the 55 or 56 minutes" senators asked questions about Lincoln's examination. 
"The real purpose was to get me to withdraw" a regulation that was harming Lincoln, he said, a subject that Gray said DeConcini broached only in the initial moments. 
According to Gray, DeConcini proposed that if the regulators would withdraw a regulation 
Meanwhile, First Deputy Premier Lev Voronin said that despite more and more barren store shelves, Soviet food pro­duction is actually no lower than last year. 
"The amount of food in the Soviet Union has not dimin­ished," Tass quoted Voronin as saying. He blamed a crumbling distribution system and panicky consumers for the shortages. 
Moscow's chief executive, Yuri Luzhkov, told a news con­ference the city is dipping into its meat reserves because daily shipments are below the nor­mal level. 
The reserves themselves, normally totalling up to 50,000 tons, are down to 15,000 tons, enough to last three days if no new shipments arrived, Luzhkov said. 
He also said the city is receiv­ing 40 percent less milk than its usual 2,300 to 2,500 tons per day. He blamed officials outside Moscow who are holding back scarce supplies for their own people. 
Neither meat nor milk has been plentiful in Moscow lately. Until now, a determined shopper could always find some sort of sausage and milk, although perhaps sour. But now, even major stores are running out of such basic supplies early in the day. 
Many republics and regions of the Soviet Union have halted shipments of food and con­sumer goods to other areas to protest policies of the central government. 
Rather than obey the Kremlin's demands for deliver­ies of food to the cities at state prices they consider too low, they are trading directly with factories and regions, bartering for other scarce supplies. 
limiting risky thrift investments, Lincoln would step up its issuance of home mortgages. 
Taylor, in his cross-examina­tion, told Gray repeatedly that reasonable senators could have problems with him because of the negative publicity he re­ceived. 
Taylor cited news stories that Gray spent $50,000 decorating his office and that former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan sought his ouster. 
Gray said he considered it a "badge of honor" that Regan wanted him out, a suggestion that former President Ronald Reagan did not follow. 
The $50,000 was to build new walls in his office and fix the heating system, Gray said.

Investors in mutual funds should wait until new year 

NEW YORK (AP) -Many long-term investors in mutual funds who usually don't worry much about the timing of their decisions are making an excep­tion to that rule right now. 
Heading into December they start picking their spots care­fully to dodge a potential pitfall that can arise from year-end distributions by funds that in­vest for capital gains. 
The strategy they follow, as summarized by the mutual fund specialists at Donoghue's Moneyletter in Holliston, Mass.: "Don't invest any new money in a domestic stock fund from now until after the fund has de­clared its year-end capital gains distribution." 
By law, funds that accumu­late capital gains by selling stocks or other securities at a profit must pass those gains through to their shareholders in order to stay clear of tax problems of their own. 
Until a few years ago, these distributions were commonly made in the year after the gains were realized. Now the law re­quires that they must be de­clared before Dec. 31. 
But many experts on mutual fund investing say the unwary can incur a needless tax prob­lem if they put new money into a fund when a distribution is about to be made. 
To see how that can work against you, consider this ex­ample: On Dec. 15, you invest $1,000 in the Hypothetical Fund at $10 a share, giving you 100 shares. Then, on Dec. 18, the fund declares a $2 per share capital gains distribution, payable Jan. 5. 
You will be credited with a $200 payout, whether you re-· ceive distributions in cash or reinvest the proceeds, and it will be taxable as 1990 income. 
By contrast, if you waited un­til Dec. 19 to make your in­vestment, none of your money would be cycled back to you. After tne pay out, the per-share value would have dropped to $8, and your $1,000 would buy you 125 shares. 
In either case, the net value of the investor's position is the same. But any pre-distribution

Some of the issues that have been recently debated by the council include business ethics, the effectiveness of using eco­nomic sanctions for foreign policy goals and the globaliza­tion of businesses. 
Another important function of the council is to secure in­ternships in foreign nations for students. 
Currently, the council has contacts in Western Europe and Asia and is presently working on opening doors in the Soviet Union and other Eastern European nations. Over the summer about 30 to 35 students will be given a chance to gain one of these in­ternships and will be able to work in one of these countries.

Dear Editor: 
In a recent letter to the editor (The Observer, Nov. 12). ques­tions were raised about the charismatic gifts and their role in the church. As members of a Christian group on campus, Campus Fellowship, we would like to take this opportunity to flxplain our experience of living a life in Christ with these gifts of the Holy Spirit. 
A personal relationship with Christ has challenged us to live a life of committed love to both Ilim and those around us. Just as the Apostles needed the Holy Spirit to empower them to live this life, so too do we need the Holy Spirit. 
John Paul II, at the Sixth International Leaders Conference in 1987, stated, "The history of the church is at the same time the history of two thousand years of the ac­tion of the Holy Spirit." The Holy spirit, then, was not given for the Apostles alone, but for all time. According to Kilian McDonnell, OSB. in his book, ~open the Windows," the charisms of the Holy Spirit are essential to this "perpetual Pentecost." These charisms, as found in I Corinthians 12, the gifts of wisdom and knowledge, faith, healing, prophecy, dis­cernment of spirits, tongues and the interpretation of tongues, belong not to "charismatics," but to the whole church. Indeed, this ex-
DOONESBURY 
perience of the Spirit and its acceptance have been endorsed by Pope Paul VI, Pope John Paul II, and the National Conference of Catholic bishops. 
How do these charisms help us to live the Christian life? They instruct us by giving us new insights into Scripture, and a fuller understanding and ex­perience of the sacramental na­ture of the church. They con­sole and encourage us as we come to recognize God's pres­ence. They empower us to live out in a concrete way our faith with each other. 
The choice to live as Christians includes sharing our lives with others who also have chosen Christ. This community revolves around the necessary encouragement others give us to deepen our personal rela­tionships with Christ. Who would better encourage us than our friends, those with whom we share both this common vi­sion and desire? We can't do it on our own. Together, with the grace of the Holy Spirit, we lead each other on to holiness, and so become the men and women God has created us to be.

Sem.ester at Sea: 
Two ND students' perspectives on a unique method of studying abroad 
Foreign, studies programs have been verv poP...ular among_ college students for years. London Rome, Paris... 
the possibilities are endless and very exciting. Two Notre Dame students have, however, found a new twist to 
the study abroad idea. Diana Barnes and Dan Miller both took to the $eas to satisfy their urge for travel and 
adventure. 
By USA EATON 
Aecent Writer 
Diana Barnes, a senior living in Farley, had the unique experienee last summer of spending her summer at sea through a program offered by the Sea Education Association (SEA). 
Barnes left her home in Pittsburgh, l'a. for Woods Hole, Mass. two weeks after school 11nded last May. She spent the lirst six weeks of her summer in dasses at thn campus of SEA in prnparation for the sea voyage. 
She took one Oceanography dass which was a basic science class in the study of the sea. llnr class in Nautical Science taught her all about sailing and included instruction on such things as navigating a ship by thn stars. 
Barnes also took Maritime Studies as her final "land" class. This was a class which covered the literature, history and public policies of the sea. Of course, a class like this would not be complete without a reading of the famous sea novel Moby Dick. 
AftHr spending the first six wnnks of the summ•~r on land Barnes and her f1~1low sailors got the opportunity to finally take to the sea. There were 35 people, 10 crew and 25 students, on the SSV Corwith Cntm•~r when it set sail from Woods Hole, Mass. on July 13, IIJIJO. 
The time on the boat was very different from the time on land. according to Barnes. One thing that was an emormous adjustment for the students was the eonstant motion of the ship. Barnlls says, "Thlly warned us about the constant motion. Things are constantly going up and down and side to side wlwthllr you're eating, sleeping or in classes." 
While on the ship the students passed their time by doing many things. All of the students were working on a research science project for their time on the sea. Barnes did her project in the field . of physical ocnanogrphy. She studied the different currents and water masses of Nova Scotia. 
The students also attended classes while on the ship. "We had practical oceanography I and II while on the ship. Basically, we learned how to sail." In addition to the research projects and the classes there were also guest speakers who would join the students for a leg of their journey and lecture on a topic relating to their experiences on the water. 
Most Importantly, the students were able to apply what they had learned academically on 'the water. They were responsible for the navigation, sailing, and maintenance of the ship. All of the students were assigned to Watch Duty which entailed early mornings and the actual sailing of the ship. According to Barnes, '"Two days out of three I was up at 3 am and on Watch Duty." 
If they were not sailing the ship or in classes, then the students had galley duty. On any given day the sailor with galley duty would have to prepare three meals for 35 people, which is not an easy task according to Barnes. "We were fed well, though. In addition to three meals a day we got three snacks a day-good things like brownies." 
The ship sailed from Massachusetts up to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and then returned to Gloucester, Mass. on August 24, 1990. About every other week they would stop at a port for about two days. And what were the favorite port activities? "We called home, did laundry and grabbed some fast food." 
The most exciting part of the whole summer for Barnes was when they almost had a run-in with Hurricane Bertha. The ship was forced to go ofT course in its attempt to outrun the storm because Hurricane Bertha was heading straight towards them. Although the hurricane never caught up with them, they experienced some very rough weather. There were waves up to 15 feet high. Barnes recalls, "You looklld out at a wall of water. It was wild." 
Barnes found the SEA program while searching for a summer job. She was looking for a job in an oceanography laboratory when someone directed her to this program. She had always loved sailing and had been thinking about a possible career in physical oceanography when she happened upon this program. 
All that is required for the program is that the student be in college and have some basic science classes. Barnes stresses that it is not important to be interested in sailing or have any experience in studying the ocean because you have the opportunity to learn everything you need to know. "You don't have to have any sailng experience or be interested in oceanography. There was a guy from Indiana who had never even seen the ocean before," says Barnes. 
Life on the ocean was defintiely a different experience for Barnes. She says, "It was another world, it had its own characteristics. It was amazing. It was such a different experience. It is hard to believe that I was at sea now that I am in cornfields, doing homework and looking at trees. " 


While all of the Domers in South Bend are preparing to bundle up and face the unpleasant onslaught of another Indiana winter, Dan Miller, a Notre Dame junior, is preparing to visit the beautiful and sunny country of Brazil. Miller is another sea-going Domer who is currently participating in the Semester at Sea program through the University of Pittsburgh. 
The Semester at Sea program is a 100-day voyage that began on September 14, 1990 in Vancouver, British Columbia on the SS Universe. By the time the semester in finished in December, the 500 students on board will have visited such interesting countries as Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, India, Seychelles, Kenya, Brazil and Venezuela. 
The program is administered academically by the University of Pittsburgh and has existed since 1963 when it was started at Chapman College by the Institute for Shipboard Education. 
Since the beginning, the program has provided students with the opportunity to experience foreign studies from a new perspective. 
Paul Watson, the director of the program at the University of Pittsburgh, emphasizes the global focus of the program. He says, "We emphasize a variety of cultural, economic, and political perspectives. We pay particular attention to Third World and developing countries, so students get a diversity of experience." 
In contrast to the program in which Diana Barnes participated, the Semester at Sea program does not require the students to be involved in the actual navigation and maintenance of the ship. 
The program that Miller is on is mainly an academic program with a liberal arts focus. The classes that the students take while on the ship are very similar to the classes that they would be taking at the university from which they have come. 
Watson says that the classes "are taught from an international perspective. The faculty all possess resident experience in one or more countries. There are also many international faculty members. We try to integrate the courses with the countries that they are visiting." 
Watson feels very strongly about the importance of foreign studies and believes that the Semester at Sea provides the students with an invaluable learning experience. "They [the students] often have life changing expereinces." 
Study at sea programs provide interesting and exciting changes from the routine of spendingjour years in Indiana and are a Tittle more adventuresome than the VITJI popular Western Europe sfutiy abroa P.rograms as Barnes and Miller have both found out. Who knows? Tfiis new twist to the genre of foreign stuay programscould be the wave of the future;

Army, Navy mobilizing for traditional match up 
WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP)­
-Army vs. Navy. One of college football's most storied rivalries began 100 years ago Thursday. And, to no one's surprise, it started as the result of a challenge. Navy began playing football in 1879, but sports were slow to gain a foothold at West Point. A century ago about the only athletic endeavors on campus were fencing and horseback riding. Cadet Dennis Michie contrived to change all that. Michie, born at West Point in 1870, had learned football in prep school before entering the academy with the class of 1892. During the summer before his 
junior year, he met a group of Midshipmen who were itching to play Army in football, no doubt because they figured it would be no contest. 
But Michie (pronounced MIKE-ee) knew a game was out of the question unless Navy is­sued a formal challenge. The Middies did, and it wasn't very difficult for Michie to convince the Army brass to answer that challenge. 
That was the easy part. Now all Michie had to do was form a team from a corps of 271 cadets who didn't know a thing about the game. 
Several agreed to play, but only two had any experience, and they weren't able to gain much more from practices be­cause sessions were staged on those Saturday afternoons when the weather was too mis­erable to drill or parade. And Michie ran them ragged, getting them up every day a half-hour before reveille for morning runs. 
That the Cadets now play at Michie Stadium is no surprise. Not only did Dennis Michie se­cure the proper equipment and uniforms for his team, he even arranged to pay for half of Navy's travel expenses by get­ting each cadet to allow 52 cents to be charged to their cadet store accounts. 
Football came to West Point for the first time on the morn­ing of Nov. 29, 1890, when the Middies arrived at the school's docks along the Hudson River aboard a special ferry boat. According to lore, they ran into an ornery goat on the long walk up to the parade field, thought the beast would make a good mascot, and decided to take him along to the game for good luck. 
As it turned out, the Middies didn't need any. Despite a par­tisan crowd of about 2,000 cheering the Cadets on, Army's first-ever football game and its only game that year was no contest Navy won 24-0 behind the play of Capt. Red Emrich, who scorea wur touchdowns (worth four points apiece in those days) and kicked two field goals for another four points. 
The following November, 17 cadets traveled by train to Annapolis for a rematch. It was the first time any West Point team had gained permission to leave the hill for an athletic event, and the Cadets got their revenge. 
Elmer Clark scored three touchdowns and Michie, the team captain, added a third, passed for another and kicked four goals (after touchdowns) as the Cadets evened the series with a 32-16 victory.

Sledding potentially injurious, say experts 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Think sledding is har-mless fun? Well, it may be fun but it's not harmless. 
"It's a very common misper­ception that sledding is per­fectly safe." said Dr. Robert Dershewitz. chief of pediatrics at the Braintree, Mass.. facility of a health maintenance organization. the Harvard Community Health Plan. "It has its own inherent dangers." 
Dershewitz reviewed the dangers in a brief report in the American Journal of Diseases of Children. The study is based on hospital treatment statistics collected by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health over three years ending Aug. 
30. 1982. but the breakdowns are similar to those in other studies. Dershewitz said. 
The federal Consumer Product Safety Commission reports 31,809 cases in which sledders had to come to hospital emergency rooms in 1989. 
Forty-one percent of injuries in Dershewitz' study were to children ages 5 to 9. and almost two thirds of the total 211 cases he studied came early in the sledding season -in December or January. 
Serious injuries, such as concussion, internal injury or broken bones, took place in 21 percent of all sledding­related cases, often because the sledder ran into a fixed object such as a telephone pole. tree or fence, the study said. Nine percent of all sledding injuries required hospitalization, with an aver­age stay of about six days. 
A separate study of injuries brought to The Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa found 38 percent hap­pened because children fell off the sled. said Dr. Chandra Vaidyanathan, the study's prime author. 
Another 13 percent of the 17 2 cases from December of 1987 to April of 1988 resulted from a collision with another sled, 18 percent from striking a tree. and 13 percent from striking other objects, such as a wall. said the emergency room physician. 
Also. she said, 10 percent came from collisions with an­other person -generally, cases in which one child was walking up the run while another came sledding down. Sled runs should be divided into uphill and downhill lanes to avoid this. she said. 
Dershewitz and Vaidyanathan conceded that their figures don't tell how much risk a child faces. because they had no total number of sledders against which they could compare the numbers of injured. But both say the sport could be made safer if parents and children paid attention to sledding conditions.

Pete Rose will teach school 
Charlie Hustle to be aid in phys. ed. and health classes 
CINCINNATI (AP). -Pete Rose, who was never much of a student in school, will become a teachers aide when he gets out of prison in January. 
Rose has worked out an agreement with the Cincinnati public school system that will take him from jail to gymna­sium. Rose has agreed to help teach physical education and health classes as part of his 1,000 hours of court-ordered community service when he's released from prison. 
"He seems comfortable with the idea," said Cecil Good, an assistant superintendent in the school district. 
Rose is serving a five-month prison sentence for failing to report income from gambling, memorabilia sales and auto­graph appearances on his taxes. He's scheduled to be re­leased from a federal prison camp in Marion, Ill.. on Jan. 7. 
Rose then must serve three months at a halfway house in Cincinnati and perform 1,000 hours of community service at five inner-city elementary schools and a youth center des­ignated by U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel. The judge de­cided last July that Rose should "return to his roots in the in­ner-city" as part of his rehabil­itation. 
It's unusual for a judge to specify community service in the schools. Good drove to the Illinois prison earlier this month to figure out how Rose can fit in. 
The decision to use him as a meeting. 
"I shared our thoughts with him. He seemed real comfort­able with the idea." Good said. "We worked it out mutually." 
Details haven't been worked out. Good said Rose likely will spend one day a week at each of the five schools specified by the judge, working under the direction of teachers. The school district has many such instructor assistants. 
"We've arranged for him to work full-time in the schools," Good said. "He'll be working the same calendar as any teacher in the district. 
"He would be working di­rectly under a certified teacher and do whatever kinds of tasks that teacher determines are most appropriate. For instance. in a gymnasium. if there are games going on. he may take a

small group and work with them in a particular activity." 
The school system was sur­prised when Spiegel specified that Rose work in the five schools for public service. Now educators are looking forward to having him around. 
"We're always glad to have assistants." Good said. "We think with his athletic back­ground he can help us in these schools. He's looking forward to this work." 
He's also looking forward to getting it over. Spiegel specified that Rose must perform at least 20 hours of his community service per week. but Rose is planning to work in the schools full-time. 
"He has 1,000 hours to per­form. Obviously he's anxious to get it over with as quickly as he can." Good said.

there have been injuries and 
the scoring average is down to 24 points per game this year. 
Alabama was shut out against Penn State and rushed for only six yards against the Nittany Lions. 
"They're a completely differ­ent offense this year," Auburn defensive coordinator Wayne Hall said. "The biggest thing is that they've lost a lot of experi­ence at some positions, so they have to be a little more conser­vative in their game plan." 
Auburn's offense is scoring 25 points per game but has been inconsistent. The Tigers had minus-14 yards rushing against Florida. 
Tigers coach Pat Dye is hop­ing the game doesn't become an offensive battle. He said he believes Alabama, a 2 1/2-point favorite, has the best defense in the country. 
"We're in deep trouble if it's a high-scoring game," Dye said. 
The Crimson Tide defense leads the SEC and is fourth na­tionally in scoring defense, al­lowing only 12 points per game. It is third nationally in total defense with 228 yards per game. 
Auburn, on the other hand, is allowing nearly 18 points per game -twice its average o last year. 
Alabama's offense has im­proved since its 0-3 start. Crimson Tide quarterback Gary Hollingsworth has only four touchdown passes compared to 14 in 1989, but Auburn linebacker coach Reggie Herring said the numbers are deceptive.

Orlando Thunder first 
WLAF team 
OHIANI>O, Fla. lAP) -The first entry into the NFI:s new World League of American Football will bn called the Orlando Thunder. 
The team's logo and colors were unveiled Wednesday by World League presidtmt Mike Lynn, who also announced that California businessman Haj Bhathal would be the team's majority owner. 
"Owning a ttHtm in this league might be better than !wing in the NFL," said Bhathal. who founded Far Western Bank in Tustin, Calif. "I Iove. lovt! football. I was inten~stnd in this six months ago.

Happy Hoosiers awaiting Peach Bowl 
BLOOMINGTON. Ind. lAP)­Indiana football coach Bill Mallory will be in Atlanta Thursday to meet with Peach Bowl officials. 
The lloosiers probably will face the loser of Saturday's Auburn-Alabama game in the bowl game Dec. 29. 
The team had Thanksgiving week off but is preparing this week for the Peach Bowl. Mallory will send an assistant to scout the Auburn-Alabama

The World League will have 10 franchises when its season starts March 10, 1991. In addition to Orlando, franchises in Charlotte, N.C.; New York; Montreal; Sacramento, Calif.; San Antonio; and Birmingham, Ala., will make up the North American teams, while London; Barcelona, Spain; and Frankfurt, Germany, will comprise the European entries.

"It's imperative that we go out and have a good year re­cruiting." 
Mallory most covets high­quality running backs, though he already has one in junior tailback Vaughn Dunbar. Dunbar carne back from two junior college seasons and a redshirt year to finish third in Big Ten rushing and 16th na­tionally with 1,143 yards (5.0 per carry, 103.9 per game) and 13 touchdowns. 
"I think next year he can be without a question one of the top running backs in the coun­try," said Mallory. 
Fullback Cal Miller is gradu­ating, and Mallory has only one more year with Dunbar, backup Steve Goodrich and fullback Ernie Thompson. Mallory hopes Dunbar's emergence and the legacy of 1989 Heisman Trophy runnerup Anthony Thompson will make IU an attractive place for aspiring running backs. 
Rocket wins Camp Trophy 
SOUTH BEND. Ind. (AP) -Raghib "Rocket" Ismail, Notre Dame's triple offensive threat who collected 1,726 all-purpose yards and six touchdowns this season, was named Wednesday the winner of the 1990 Walter Camp player of the year trophy. 
"He's the most exciting player we have seen play in many, many years," said Kevin O'Brien, president of the Walter Camp Football Foundation in New Haven, Conn., during a presentation cernmony. 
"It's a tremendous honor, and I feel very privileged," said Ismail, a candidatl~ for the Heisman Trophy to be awardt~d Saturday in New York. 
Ismail beat out Virginia quarterback Shawn Moore. who finished second in the balloting among Division 1-A coaches and sports information directors for the honor, said O'Brien. 
Quarterback Ty Detmer of Brigham Young and Colorado running back Eric Bieniemy fin­ished third and fourth, ahead of quarterbacks Craig Erickson of Miami and David Klingler of Houston. 
O'Brien said Ismail "has demonstrated that he is a dedi­cated competitor who has made effective use of his athletic tal­ent to enhance the great American game of college foot­ball. He is an outstanding young man." 
Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz said Ismail's talents as a return specialist, receiver and tailback are unquestionable. "There's not been any controversy over Rocket this year," he said. "He's an incredible athlete, but he's been an incredible person." 
Ismail declined to speculate on his chances of becoming the eighth Notre Dame player to capture the Heisrnan. "There's nothing I can do going in there Saturday," he said. "Hopefully the best man will win. and that'll be that." 
No. 7 Notre Dame (9-2) fin­ished the regular season Saturday with a I 0-6 victory over Southern Cal. The Irish will play No. 1 Colorado (1 0-1­
1) in the Orange Bowl on New Year's Day. 
Ismail, a junior, is the third Notre Dame player selected for the honor since it was first awarded in 1967 to O.J. Simpson. Ken MacAfee won the award in 1977 and Tim Brown received it in 1987, the same year he became Notre Dame's seventh Heisman winner. 
Indiana's Anthony Thompson won the award last year.

game. 
The 6-4-1 Hoosiers will lose only four starters and the Big Ten's top punter, Macky Smith (42.2-yard average, 13th na­tionally). They finished seventh in the Big Ten at 3-4-1, winning only two of their last seven games. But the 28-14 Old Oaken Bucket victory over Purdue Saturday salvaged the season. Had the Hoosiers lost, the situation could have become critical. 
"It's just such a good feeling going back to a bowl," said Mallory, who recorded his fourth winning season and bowl appearance with the Hoosiers. "It'll be a great shot in the arm for our recruiting. Our program needed it. It kind of had plateaued." 
Mallory was most pleased with his defense. Although the Hoosiers finished sixth in the league in total defense (333.8 total yards per game) -two

coming here, I wouldn't be just another player on the roster. Coming here it was like they cared more about you than winning a national champi­onship." 
Coach Schafer is clearly im­
pressed with the play of his 
young netminder, especially his 
mental approach to the game. 
"It doesn't seem to upset his play (when he's scored on)," says Schafer. "As soon as the puck has been dropped, he's ready to start over again." 
Louder feels that his physical tools are a big part of his suc­cess in goal. 
"My size (6-1, 185) helps a lot," he says. "I use it to my ad­vantage, playing the angles as opposed to reactions." 
His success in high school should have been an indicator of his success in college, but his immediate impact has sur­prised even himself. 
"I expected the transition to take a little longer," he says, "but so far I'm doing OK." 
With accolades and honors piled on him, it seems that Louder has a bright future in front of him and Coach Schafer agrees. 
"It's hard to say with 3 1/2 years of college ahead of him, but he has the tools and proper temperament," says Schafer. 
Louder would. like to play professionally some day, but as a freshman he's not overly con­cerned with his future after college. 
"It'd be nice if things work out (to play professionally), if it's in the NHL or in Europe. It's nice to have that as one of your options. It's pretty much a dream of every hockey player," he says. 
With Louder playing so well, it seems the Irish have found their goaltender of the present and future. For his part, Louder thinks the match is perfect. 
"It's everything I could have asked for," said Louder. "Schoolwork has been going great and hockey's been going great." 
Luckily, Coach Schafer will have a while to wait before he has to worry about who is going to be playing goal when the Irish take the ice.

Indiana defeats Irish 70-67 
Jamal Meeks scores 11 points to fuel late Hoosier rally 
By FRANK PASTOR 
Associate Sports Editor 
Jamal Meeks fumbled his way into Bobby Knight's heart Wednesday night. 
Meeks, Indiana's third guard, recovered from an early sec­ond-half turnover against Notre Dame's full-court press to score 11 second-half points and dish out eight assists in the Hoosiers' 70-67 victory in the Joyce ACC. 
The loss marked the third straight defeat to a top 10 team for Notre Dame (2-3), which lost to No. 3 Arizona and No. 6 Duke last week in the Dodge/NIT. 
The Irish led by as many as 12 points in the second half be­fore the Hoosiers (3-1) rallied to win. Forward Daimon Sweet's two free throws with 14:16 remaining gave Notre Dame a commanding 45-33 advantage, but Indiana rode a 14-4 spurt to draw to within two at 49-47. 
Forward Calbert Cheaney pulled the Hoosiers even at 53 with an eight-foot jumper inside the paint at the 7:09 mark. Cheaney then put Indiana on top for the first time when he rebounded his own missed shot to give Indiana a 55-53 lead only minutes later. 
The Hoosiers' comeback co­incided with Meeks's entrance .into the game. 
"(Meeks) played with a heart 
the size of an elephant's heart 
in the second half," Knight said. 
"When he made a critical error 
and lost the ball against the 
press, he knew it. I like guys 
who know when they screw 
up." 
Meeks played the entire sec­
ond half after watching guards 
Damon Bailey and Chris 
Reynolds struggle to penetrate 
Notre Dame's 2-3 zone in the 
frrst half. The Irish jumped out 
to a 14-5 lead just six minutes 
into the game and led through­
out the half, taking a 35-25 ad­
vantage into the locker room at 
intermission. 
Sweet (19 points) and guard 
Elmer Bennett (18 points). 
Notre Dame's "Texas Express", 
combined for 19 points in the 
first half while the Irish defense 
held Cheaney, Indiana's leading 
scorer at 20.3 points per game, 
scoreless through the first 20 
minutes. 
"I thought we played well in 
the first 24 minutes," Irish head 
coach Digger Phelps said. "I felt 
it came down to the last 14 
minutes. We didn't do the 
things defensively that we 
nAAded to do. We didn't protect 
Irish come oh-so-close in third loss to Top 10 team 
At halftime it seemed like they were finally going to pull it off. The Notre Dame men's basketball team had looked awful in a 91-61 loss to No. 2 Arizona last week. Against No. 8 Duke, the Irish looked a little bit better, and a second-half comeback left them just eight points short as the Blue Devils held on for an 85-77 win. Last night at the Joyce ACC it looked like Digger Phelps's squad was about to bust out of its shell against a Top 10 team. The Irish led No. 10 Indiana 35­25 at the intermission, and everything was going their way. Every time the Hoosiers made a run in the first half, Notre Dame responded. When Indiana cut the Irish lead to four with 6:20 to go in the first stanza, Daimon Sweet hit an off-balance bank shot and Tim Singleton followed with a steal and a rim-rattling breakaway dunk to increase Notre Dame's advantage to 27-19. A free throw by Kevin Ellery and an Elmer Bennett layup pushed the Irish out to an 11-point lead, and things looked glum for the Hoosiers at halftime. But it all fell apart in the second half, as Jamal Meeks and Calbert Cheaney, who wen~ both scoreless at halftime, scored 11 and 15 points respectively. Meeks and Cheaney exploited the middle of the Irish zone defense which was extended out on the wings in order to stop Hoosier guards Greg Graham and Damon Bailey, who had combined for four three-pointers between them in the first half. "There were a couple of holes in the zone," Irish forward LaPhonso

the inside, and we committed turnovers that you can't make in a situation like that." 
Indiana forced eight Notre Dame turnovers in the second half by changing to a tenacious man-to-man defense that forced the Irish into bad passes and hurried shots. 
"We went into our transition game in the second half," Bennett said, "and we just couldn't get the ball inside. Everybody was standing out on the perimeter." 
Meeks, meanwhile had his way with the Irish defense. The junior guard took over the point when Bailey fouled out at the 
5:28 mark and set up Cheaney for 15 second-halfpoints. 
Meeks was left unguarded at the top of the key and hit sev­eral key jump shots down the stretch. He also found Cheaney underneath the basket with with 54 seconds remaining to give the Hoosiers an insur­mountable 63-60. 
"We got a really good lift from Meeks in the second half," Knight said. "He gave us more as a guard than we've had from anybody in a long time. We couldn't ask for better guard

Louder buoys Irish hockey 
Head coach Schafer optimistic about freshman goalie 

RICH KURZ 
Sports Writer 
When the 1989-90 hockey season ended last March, Notre Dame head coach Ric Schafer had a few questions to answer. 
Like how he was going to re­place 56 career wins and 3519 career saves (both Irish records) that deserted him when goaltender Lance Madson graduated last May, joining the Hartford Whaler organization as the holder of five Notre Dame goalkeeping records. 
Enter freshman goalie Greg Louder. 
"Mter graduating Madson, we were concerned about re­placing him. Greg has calmed those fears," says Schafer. 
And he might have even made Notre Dame hockey fans begin to forget Madson. Louder, a native of Acton, Mass., has started all 11 games to date, compiling a 5:-5-1 record. He has turned away 315 shots so far, with an .870 save percent­age, numbers very similar to Madson's. 
In his' freshman season, Madson saved 541 shots in 17 games, with a save percentage 
Greg Louder 
of .878. As far as the most im­portant numbers go however, Louder is ahead of Madson. Madson's record freshman year was only 5-12, while Louder al­ready has five wins just a third of the way through the season. 
Louder doesn't feel much pressure following in the foot­steps of a legend like Madson, however. 
"I heard people talk about him," Louder says, "but I never really considered that I would have to pick up where he left off." 
Those who have followed Louder's career to this point probably aren't too surprised about his success at Notre Dame. He was a four-year starter at the Cushing Academy in Massachusetts, where he was chosen as the Massachusetts Goalie of the Year, as well as the top goaltender at the All-American Tournament in Boston. 
Yet the most important selec­tion of Louder's hockey career took place last spring when the Edmonton Oilers chose him in the fifth round of the NHL Draft, making him the second American goaltender selected in the draft. Despite the obvious temptation of going pro, Louder says that it never really entered his mind. 
"Not right out of high school," he says. ''I'd pretty much decided to go to college, but it's nice to have that (professional hockey) after college." 
Why would a goaltender who had his pick of colleges choose to attend Notre Dame over some of the more traditional hockey powers? 
"The academics with the ath­letics," says Louder. "I felt

The Saint Mary's Swimming and Diving team look to senior Toni Olivieri to provide leader­ship and experience. As the only senior on the team, Toni has quite a position to fill. 
"As a senior I feel that I need to provide motivation for the other swimmers," said Toni. "It's important to have someone there who is always cheering and keeping spirits up. I want to support the others as well as provide an example. I try to show the importance of concentrating in competition to perform my best as well as en­couraging others to do their best. 
While it is important to have senior guidance, Toni credits the other returning swimmers for the leadership that they provide the team. The nine re­turning team members provide a base of experience and strength for the underclass members. 
Toni brings a background in swimming that began at the age of six. She swam in summer leagues until she joined the Saint Mary's team her freshman year. Shoulder injuries forced her to cut down her butterfly events, pushing her strength into the 50 meter and 100 meter freestyle events. The 200 meter individual medley is also a personal favorite which provides variety. As a Saint Mary's swimmer, she qualified for NAIA nationals both her freshman and junior years, and she was selected as a Scholar­Athlete last year. She spent her sophomore year in Rome, and therefore did not participate in swimming. 
This week the Saint Mary's team will compete in the National Catholic Invitational at Notre Dame. The meet places Division III Saint Mary's against a large number of Division I schools. As far as team placement this will be a hindrance, however there is room for strong individual per­formances. 
"This year Saint Mary's should have scorers in both swimming and diving. The meet provides a good opportunity for strong individual and relay performances," predicted Toni. 
Toni remembered National Catholics as her first meet for Saint Mary's. 
"As a freshman I was scared. The meet was large, and I wasn't comfortable with my team yet," recalled Toni. 
She thinks that this year's team, however, will find the meet to be a less threatening, more positive experience. The team has already competed in big meets including the Notre Dame Relays and the Little
