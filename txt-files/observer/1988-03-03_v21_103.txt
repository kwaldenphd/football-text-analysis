Beauchamps' killer faces life jail term 
Associated Press 
PONTIAC, Mich.-A carnival worker convicted of killing the parents of Notre Dame Execu­tive Vice President Father Ed­ward Beauchamp faces man­datory life in prison. 
An Oakland County Circuit Court jury Tuesday deliberated more than two hours before finding Michael Root, 30, guilty in the Sept. 8 slayings of Edward Beau­champ, 75, and Marion Beau­champ, 74. 
Root was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct for raping Marion Beauchamp Oakland County Prosecutor L. Brooks Patterson said. 
"Everything we were able to produce laid this case at the doorstep of Michael Root," Patterson said. "This case was built on circumstantial evidence. That's not to say we had a weak case. The defense was just absolutely incapable of explaining (the circum­stances) all away."

CLC rejects ND jurisdiction limit 
By CHRIS BEDNARSKI 
News Editor 
A proposal to limit the ad­ministration's power to punish students for rules violations when off-campus was defeated Wednesday by the Campus Life Council. 
The proposal attempted to limit University jurisdiction to violations on campus, at Uni­versity sponsored events, or vi­olations when acting as an of­ficial representative of the University. Criminal offenses would also be subject to Uni­versity action, according to the proposal. 
The present policy, accor­ding to du Lac, states all rules, regulations and codes apply to students on and off-campus. 
According to this policy, stu­dents could be held account­able for the actions over spring break, said Student Senator Mike Carrigan. 
Carrigan, along with fellow Student Senators Brian Holst and Steve Viz, sponsored the proposal. 
"There should be some limit to the jurisdiction of the Uni­versity," Carrigan said. 
"When you're acting sepa­rate from the University, act­ing in a role not related to being a student," said Holst, "then your actions should not be sub­ject to discipline by Notre Dame." 
Holst said the policy in du Lac is ambiguous and un­popular with students. Novem­ber's student survey showed dissatisfaction with the policy, he said. 
Holst and Viz were the only Council members to vote in fa­vor of the proposal. 
"It wasn't thought out 
enough," said Father Wilfred 
Borden, Pangborn Hall rector. 
Students shouldn't be permit­
ted to hurt the image of the Uni­
versity even when they are off­
campus, he said. "It's 
important to protect that 
image and improve upon it," 
he said. 

"There was somewhat a con­
sensus that the jurisdiction 
policy should be looked at," 
said Student Body President 
Pat Cooke. "But the proposal

Attractiveness survey reportedly a rumor 
By MARK MCLAUGHLIN Staff Reporter 
Notre Dame is the second best campus in America to find good-looking men. Or so popular campus rumors say. 
Both Playboy and Playgirl magazines, however, deny any connection to stories ranking campus students' attractive­ness. 
"There's no truth to that rumor as far as I know," said Kevin Loud, associate editor of Playgirl magazine. "We've never done a college ratings story. We're running nothing on that in the future, as far as I know." 
A spokeswoman for Playboy Enterprises also denied the rumor. "Apparently it's a rumor that colleges like to start," the spokeswoman said. She said Playboy receives several inquiries about college ratings each year. "We get enough calls that we know it's a popular rumor," she added. 
Many students believe other­wise. "It seems like it's true since everyone's been saying it," said Bill Dunn, a resident of Grace Hall who hung a ban­ner thanking Playboy for the supposed ranking. "I heard (the rumor) from a lot of dif­ferent people. 
"Someone said that Notre Dame women were ranked 152 out of 159," he added. 
Associated Press 
BRUSSELS, Belgium -NATO leaders on Wednesday demanded huge cutbacks in Warsa.w Pact tanks and ar­tillery, and endorsed President Reagan's efforts to negotiate strategic arms reductions with the Soviet Union. 
Defining strategy for a new set of East-West negotiations, NATO leaders said Soviet con­ventional forces pose the threat of a surprise attack and must be slashed to rectify an im­balance in military strength. 
The Soviet cutbacks would entail, for example, "the elim­ination from Europe of tens of thousands of Warsaw Pact weapons relevant to surprise attack, among them tanks and artillery pieces," a NATO com­munique said. 
Meeting behind closed doors at alliance's heavily guarded headquarters, the leaders of the 16 alliance countries at­tempted to accentuate agree­ment. They did not want to highlight differences about the pace of modernizing short­range nuclear missiles left in Europe after the elimination of longer-range weapons covered by a new U.S.-Soviet arms treaty. 
According to his spokesman, Reagan quoted Benjamin Franklin, telling the NATO leaders, "If we do not all hang together, we will assuredly 
hang separately." 
Security was so strict that a 
NATO guard attempted to eject 
a reporter who asked Reagan 
a question as the leaders posed 
for a "family photo." 
Emphasizing alliance unity, 
Reagan said, "There are no 
great fundamental differences 
there. I have never seen such 
harmony and togetherness as 
we have." 
Reagan mixed NATO sum­
mitry with Middle East peace 
efforts. He ordered Secretary 
of State George Shultz to make 
a whirlwind return to the 
Middle East after the summit 
windup Thursday night to con­
tinue his efforts to set up Arab­
Israeli peace talks. 
First, Shultz will stop in Lon­don to see Jordan's King Hus­sein, and on Friday will visit Israel, Egypt and Syria, re­turning to Washington early Saturday morning. 
The NATO meeting is the al­liance's first summit since 1982. 
Accompanied by their foreign ministers, the leaders gathered at a long, walnut­brown oval table in a confer­ence room shortly after noon to hear an opening statement by Lord Carrington, NATO's sec­retary general.

Doctors express concern over boxing dangers 
By REGIS COCCIA Assistant News Editor 
The annual Bengal Bouts boxing tournament has been popular for entertaining stu­dents and aiding the Holy Cross missions in Bangladesh for 58 years. But the event has drawn criticism of late from physicians at Notre Dame. 
Dr.. James Moriarity, of Uni­versity Health Services, opted not to give physical examina­tions to students who partici­pate in the bouts. 
The University's athletic de­partment required Bengal Bouts participants to undergo physical examinations, Moriarity said, but added that University Health Services physicians were given the op­tion of administering the ex­ams. 
"It's strictly a voluntary thing," he said. "I just chose not to be a part of the program. That doesn't mean I won't see boxers or treat their injuries," said Moriarity. 
"There's 22 or 24 varsity sports and I approve of every one of them. I just don't like boxing," he said. "I have given physicals for kids in the Bengal Bouts. I just do not support the concept of boxing," Moriarity said. 
"I don't like the idea of people banging their heads around. But I'm not going to make an issue of the whole thing," he said, adding that other physicians share his views. 
Dr. Bernard Vagner, one of Moriarity's colleagues at Uni­versity Health Services, has been a physician for the Bengal Bouts for 11 years, but said he doesn't like boxing.

J-Council 
By TIM O'KEEFE Copy Editor 
The Judicial Council elected junior Arty Feles as its new co­ordinator for the 198&119 school year Wednesday night. 
Feles said his main goal as coordinator is "to get the coun­cil recognized by the student body." This would be done, in part, by "letting more students know who their (judicial board) chairman is and what gal Bouts were very popular in past years. "It was there then, but it generated as much con­troversy as it does today," Moriarity said. 

This year Bengal Bouts has more participants than ever, said Richard O'Leary, non­varsity athletics liaison, who has helped run the event for the last 18 years. 
"It's been up and down the last 18 years we've been with it. The last two years have been booming years," said O'Leary. 
"I am anti-boxing," Vagner said. "It's supposed to be the manly sport of self-defense. But people are headhunters (in the bouts)," he said. "They have more bloody noses out there than you can shake a stick at. They don't have enough time to learn defense. It's all offense.'' 
Safety is a major concern of the Bengal Bouts' promoters, he said. "We've got to keep in mind we're not talking about professional boxing,'' 0 'Leary said. "We can control the two (fighters) and r~iake sL..7e they're adequat('.iy trained." 
O'Leary said inexperienced students who '-'ant to partici­pate in the bouts are required to enter a four-week novice training program in the fall, followed by six to seven weeks of ring training prior to the event. 
"We're wearing bigger headgear and there's much more protection. The gloves are bigger," O'Leary said. "We are sponsoring both sides. We're not trying to sacrifice anybody for a win for our team," he said. 
"We do have better equip­ment and that has changed," O'Leary said. "Better equip­ment has been developed for amateur boxing and we're cer­tainly taking advantage of that." 
Vagner said he can under­stand why students want to par­ticipate in the Bengal Bouts. "I admire the kids for what they are doing. When I was their age I would have done the same thing. But I wouldn't do it knowing what I know now,'' he said. 
"I'll do the job that I'm hired to do here," Vagner said. "But I just don't like boxing."

· The four-year study will con­clude March 27, when more than 30 scientists from the United States and Canada will meet at Notre Dame to present their findings, said Dr. Morris Pollard, a pathologist and director of Notre Dame's Lobund Laboratory. 
The Lobund Aging Project is an unprecedented attempt to study food intake and aging from a variety of medical specialties, Pollard said Wed­nesday. 
Although some of the re­search remains incomplete, early results indicate rats that ate less lived longer and suf­fered from fewer diseases as­sociated with old age, he said. 
why, Pollard said. "We think this study will contribute sub­stantially to a better under­standing of the mechanism of dietary restriction," he said. 
All the animals in the study 

ate the same food -a high-fiber, 
low-fat vegetarian diet -but 
some were given less. 
The rats that were fed 30 per­

cent less lived an average of 38 
months, an increase of nearly 
20 percent above normal, ac­
cording to study results. 
Several rats lived more than 40 
months and one rat lived 50 
months, Pollard said. · The rats on restricted diets were healthier in their old age, developing fewer cancers of the prostate and liver. Prelim­inary results also indicate rats on restricted diets suffered less disease of the heart and brain and had better-functioning im­mune systems, Pollard said.

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The House overwhelmingly passed a landmark civil rights bill Wed­nesday that would broaden protections for women, minorities, the elderly and the handicapped. President Reagan has vowed to veto the measure. 
The Civil Rights Restoration Act, considered by many law­makers the most significant civil rights measure in 20 years, was sent to the White House on a 315-98 vote. The Sen­ate passed it by an equally lop­sided 75-14 vote in January. 
Both chambers passed the bill by the two-thirds margin needed to override a presiden­tial veto, but it was unclear

The restoration act was de­signed to reverse a 1984 Su­preme Court decision that nar­rowed the scope of four major civil rights laws meant to prevent taxpayer-financing of discrimination. 
Supporters of the act said hundreds of discrimination complaints had been dropped or restricted since the decision.

Associated Press 

PANAMA CITY, Panama ­An opposition leader said Wed­nesday that Gen. Manuel An­tonio Noriega was purging his army of suspected opponents, and doctors joined businesses in a general strike aimed at ousting the military strongman. 
Guillermo Cochez, a national legislator and vice president of the opposition Christian Dem­ocratic Party, told reporters that Noriega apparently had fired two senior colonels and two majors suspected of being disloyal. 
Cochez said they included Col. Marcos Justines, who as chief of staff was No. 2 in the Panamanian Defense Forces and next in line to succeed Noriega.

Study finds one in 500 babies with AIDS virus 
Associated Press 

BOSTON -A study of Massa­chusetts women who gave birth found that one in 500 was in­fected with the AIDS virus, and researchers projecting their findings nationwide say several thousand AIDS-infected babies could be born in the United States each year. 
Most surveys of AIDS infec­tion have concentrated on male homosexuals, drug addicts and others at high risk of catching the disease. Estimating the prevalence of the virus in the general population has . been difficult. 
"This paper gives a more ac­curate way to judge the scope of the epidemic in women," said Dr. Rodney Hoff. "Noth­ing else comes close to this in being able to measure the prev­alence in the United States." 
SELF 
Delvalle struggle 
anonymous telephone callers warned both Tuesday and Wed­nesday that a bomb had been planted in the commission's headquarters. 

Spokesman Franklin Castrellon told The Associated Press that the building, next to the waterway, was evacuated and searched both days but that no bombs were found. 
In Washington, William Rogers, a lawyer for a Panamanian opposition group, said the State Department was preparing to notify U.S. banks where the Panamanian gov­ernment has deposits not to conduct any transactions with Noriega's regime. 
Cochez said he could not "ab­solutely confirm" the firings, but several diplomatic sources said they also had heard the reports and tended to believe them. 

Hoff directed the study at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health using tiny samples of blood routinely drawn from babies to check for phenylketonuria, or PKU, and other diseases. 
The study found that one of every 476 women giving birth, or 2.1 for each 1,000, were in­fected with the AIDS virus. However, this varied greatly, depending on where they lived. 
At three inner-city Boston hospitals, eight per 1,000 were infected. In suburban and rural hospitals, just under one per 1,000 carried the virus.

"Paddy's Racket" celebrates St. Patrick's Day a wee at "Irish Pub Night" at Theodore's. bit early Wednesday night, playing their Irish music 
Campaign heats the South 
Associated Press 

Sen. Bob Dole, bidding to make up ground in the South, said Wednesday the United States should react in any way necessary "including military force" to protect its interests in Panama and the Canal Zone. 
Michael Dukakis began airing a new television com­mercial attacking Richard Gephardt and turning his Dem­ocratic rival's populist rallying cry -"It's your fight, too" -on its head. 
The advertisement says Gep­hardt is taking campaign con­tributions from "big establish­ment power brokers," and adds, "Kinda makes you wonder, is Dick Gephardt fight­ing your fight or theirs?" 
Dole and Vice President George Bush swapped fresh at­tacks in new television com­mercials as the campaign in­tensified for support in a critical round of Southern pri­maries on Super Tuesday next week. 

Fresh public opm10n polls gave Bush a large lead in Texas and Florida, the states with the two biggest delegate prizes in next week's festival of prima­ries. Aides to Dole conceded the outlook is generally bleak for their man from one end of Dixie to the other. 
"We hope to bounce back the following week," in the Illinois primary, said one aide, speak­ing on condition of anonymity. "We'll be heavy in Illinois. I think if Dole doesn't win Illi­nois, it's just about over." 
But Dole sought the offensive during the day, saying the United States should "just say no" to Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega, indicted in this country on drug charges. 
Campaigning in Louisiana, he suggested there might be some connection between Bush's tenure as head of the CIA and rumors that Noriega had been on the spy agency payroll. He refused to elabo­rate, but said he would have a major announcement at a drug conference in Washington D.C. on Thursday. 
In cooler climes, former tele­
vtswn evangelist Pat 
Robertson ran away with a 2­
to-1 victory over the GOP field 
in the Alaska caucuses that 
ended Tuesday night, claiming 
47 percent of the vote to 24 per­
cent for Bush and 20 percent 
for Dole. 
But Alaska's 19 GOP delegates weren't much of a prize stacked up against 712 Republican delegates and 1,307 Democratic delegates in next week's Super Tuesday round of balloting concentrated in Southern and border states. 
Robertson's lawyer said Wednesday the GOP presiden­tial candidate is ready to "pay a substantial amount of court costs" in dropping his libel suit against a former congressman who accused Robertson of avoiding combat duty in the Korean War.

wasn't the correct answer to the jurisdiction policy." 
''Many members of the Coun­cil felt Notre Dame rules should apply to some extent off­campus," he said. "They felt the proposal ties the hands of Notre Dame by saying it could only act on a criminal offense." 
He said, however, there was a general consensus in the Council that the policy is too broad and should be reworded. 
"I think the spirit of the pro­posal is fine," said Farley Hall rectress Mary Luise Gude. "I think that the thing written up was not adequate." She said, however' the policy should utili be studied. "It was a good first start." 
Carrigan said he and Holst would work on a compromise proposal. 
At most schools similar to Notre Dame, Carrigan said stu­dents cannot be punished by ad­ministrators for off-campus of­fenses. At schools where policies allow such punish­ment, he said policies are not enforced.

Cuntras hindered peace process 
Editor's Note: The following is the fourth in a series offive that will coin­cide with President Reagan's visit to 
campus. 
Dear Editor: 
"The Contras are effective because they force the Sandinista government to the bargaining table to negotiate a peaceful resolution." I would like to suggst that this belief held by both the White House and much of the American public fails to consider Nicaragua's wil­lingness to peacefully negotiate with the United States before the Contra movement developed into a full-scale war. 
In 1982, Nicaragua formulated a 13­point proposal to the U.S. demonstrat­ing its willingness to sever ties with the Salvadoran guerrillas, limit its armed forces, and allow international verifica­tion of compliance with these points. 
In July of 1983, Daniel Ortega again expressed his willingness to end Nicaraguan support of the rebels in El Salvador and prohibit foreign military bases on its territory if its own security could be guaranteed. In September of that same year, Nicaragua gave com­plete support to the Contadora initiative and its 21 points. 
In October of 1983, Nicaragua drew up four treaties to the U.S. and Central American governments which would have prevented foreign military bases in Nicaragua and prohibited the flow of arms to subversive movements in other countries. The Contadora countries would stop buying arms and would ask all foreign military advisers to leave if the other Central American governments would do the same. 
It appeared that Nicaragua was ready to discuss two vital concerns of the U.S.: the flow of arms to the Sal­vadoran insurgents and Soviet and Cuban presence in Central America. 
The U.S. responded to these proposals by announcing a massive military maneuver (Big Pine II) with Honduras in 1983. The CIA also spon­sored the destruction of Nicaraguan oil storage facilities and the mining of three of its harbors (only .to have the 
U.S. refuse to recognize the jurisdiction of the World Court when Nicaragua pre­sented its case.) 
In September of 1984, Nicaragua an­nounced that it would sign the Con­tadora draft treaty. However U.S. pres­sure on El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica to object to some if its provi­sions prevented further action on the treaty. 
To say that the Contras force the San­dinistas to the bargaining table implies that the Sandinistas were unwilling to sit at the table in the first place. They were willing.

Look beyond tastebuds 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to Dennis Corrigan's article which detailed his extreme displeasure with the Univer­sity's food policy regarding omission of meat on Fridays. Perhaps Dennis' pro­vided alternative that he leave school should be acted upon. Although February in South Bend can be tough, what Notre Dame certainy does not need is to publish moaners without due cause. Is the University prohibiting any great freedom by not serving meat for six or seven days out of a year? I think not. If we look beyond our tastebuds to reflect on the reasons behind the abstinence, it becomes clear this sym­bolic act is rooted in love. We should count our blessings and not our "restrictions." You who reflect and still believe otherwise, please let me know 
and  I  will  send  you  money  for  
McDonald's.

JPW parents express joy 
Dear Editor: 
This Junior Parents' Weekend was our fourth in just five years. Each of them was as unique as our two daughters and sons. 
While driving home we attempted to analyze the specialness of this particu­lar weekend and to try to explain the deep emotion that we were both feeling. 
Was it because this would be our last JPW? Was it because we somehow felt we had triumphed over the physical ele­ment of "lake-effect" snow for two days? Or perhaps it was the strong af­fection we were feeling for the friends of our daughter. We concluded that it was three things that really accounted 

. for this wonderful peace. 
With Kevin Hurley and his parents in our midst we all not only felt inspired and humbled, but we also experienced a confirmation of the healing power of Jesus Christ, and an answer to months of our prayers, as well as a demonstra­tion of the dedication of parental love as evidenced in Celeste and Dick Hur­ley. 
The affable man affectionately known as "Monk" was accessible to all of us this weekend. The warmth of his handshakes, his hugs and his words touched our hearts deeply. 
And last, it was the realization by two parents that their youngest child has an ease and a joy in giving love to others that is truly a special gift.

'Amadeus' cast, costumes delight audience 

TAMRYN ETTEN accent writer 
I 
It was the Jack Blakey 
hour. Or rather, three 
hours. Jack Blakey, who played 
Antonio Salierl In last night's 
sold-out performance of 
"Amadeus" in Washington Hall, 
never leFt the stage during the 
three-hour performance. 
Salierl. the character who 
reigns over Mozart's life, reigns 
over the performance of 
Mozart's life story. The marat­
hon proves successful. He 
reigns over a brilliant display of 
Notre Dame acting talent. 
It Is a tragic story--the story of the dowmfall of two composers--one physical. the other mental. 
Predictably, the composer who meets his physical fall is the one for whom the play is named, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Played brilliantly by Brian Loefner, the brash, can­did, whining composer charms the audience with his hideous laugh and crude remarks. 
Amadeus' wife, Constanze, Is his suitable match In whim. K. Lynn Berry the actress, his match In talent. 
Mozart pursues fame and fortune in a world that cannot appreciate his brilliance. The only man who can truly appre­
ciate it is Salieri. 
As a child, Salleri,.makes a bargain with God that if God would provide him with talent. he would glorify God in return. But instead God chooses to give the gift of musical compo­sition to the Devil's instrument. Mozart. 
This burns in Salieri's heart. and he decides to devote the remainder of his life to over­seeing Mozart's demise. He must see to it that he "teaches God His lessons." 
Salieri narrates the story for the audience as an old man, an adult. and as a child. As Salierl. Blakey skillfully makes these transitions. He plays to his audience--the only audience that Salieri can captivate be­cause of his mediocre compos­ing. 
Blakey anguishes In his pain, cries in his sorrow, and laughs at his absurdity. He is a multi­faceted, evil man. We pity him, while we rejoice in the perfor­mance of him. 
The costumes and sets add to the brilliance of the perfor­mance. The 18th century dresses, suits, and wigs bring 
the audience back to the days 
of musical domination in 
Europe. The days of kings and 
queens, court composers, 
operas, and cantatas. 
The set. a classical composi­tion with an elaborate drape and sliding glass doors, is built on a slant. away from the audi­ence. Simple placing of chairs and tables lakes the audience into Mozart's home, the opera house, or the Waldstadten li­brary where Salieri learns of Mozart's childish whims from Salieri's upright chair. 
But what would a play about Mozart be without the music of "too many notes," full of the composer's vanity? A sound system, operating from back­stage, provides the small piano pieces and the large operas. 
The music is perfectly timed to the moods, expressions, and lines of the actors. As Salieri drops Mozart's manuscript to the noor in realization of his unreachable talent. the music stops. The line is severed, the damage done. 
Mozart's music went virtually unheard in his lifetime. This performance must not do the same. 

Grammy winners announced 
Associated Press 
N
EW YORK-U2, the Irish rock group with a passion for politics, picked up two Grammys Wednesday for The Joshua Tree, their I 2-mlllion selling album, and declared, ''This Is just a beginning." 
After Joshua Tree won album of the year, lead singer Bono said, "It's really hard to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders." Backstage, Bono added, "We don't see this as a peak for U2. It's just a begin­ning. We've got 12 songs ready for the next album." 
Little Richard revealed the Academy's choice for best new artlst--Jody Whatley, a Madonna sound-alike from the old dance-band, Shalamar. 
Whitney Houston, a winner 
two years ago with her debut 
album, took honors at the 30th 
Annual Grammy Awards for 
best female pop vocalist for 
her effervescent single, "I 
Wanna Dance with Somebody," 
from her LP, Whitney. Narada 
Michael Walden won a Grammy 
for producing Whitney. 
"Somewhere Out There," a sweet ballad written by veteran songwriters James Horner, Barry Mann, and Cynthia Well for the animated film "An American Tall," won song of the year. 
Guitarist The Edge, born David Evans, pulled out a list as he accepted the Grammy for best rock group with vocal The Joshua Tree. He thanked Am­nesty International and luminaries such as Martin Lut­
her King Jr., Bob Dylan, Jimi 
Hendrix, Archbishop Desmond 
Tutu, Dr. Ruth Westheimer, 
Morris the Cat. President 
Reagan and college radio sta­

U2, Houston, Los Lobos, and Michael Jackson each had four nominations this year, but none threatened to equal Jack-son's eight-award sweep in the 1984 ceremony. Jackson's ai­bum, Bad, won an early Grammy for best-produced, non-classical recording. 
Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the South African vocal group featured on Paul Simon's Graceland album, won a Grammy for best traditional folk recording for "Shaka Zulu." 

What would you ask President Reagan? 
Compiled by Cara Anthony and Christine Walsh Photos by Zoltan (Jry 
"I would tell President Reagan that I don't think he should con­tinue to impose economic sanc­tions on Panama. Doing this hurts everyone In the country and in no way will it force General Noriega to leave. Noriega enjoys too much power and ineffective measures such as trade embargos and eco­nomic sanctions are not enough to make him abandon his posi­tion as military leader." 
Alice Lohrer Sophomore from Republic of Panama 



+ "I'd ask what President Reagart 
~ what he thinks he's learned about the Soviet-U.S. arms race, and what that means for the prospects of a U.S.-Soviet relationship by the year 2000. I think Reagan has learned that we can deal with the Russians, or at least he can deal with one particular kind of Rus­sian, and that's the one he's got now. It would be Interesting to hear him address that." 
George Lopez Director of the Institute for Inter­national Peace Studies 
"''d like to thank the President for the greatjob he has done. The economy has improved greatly, which is to his credit, and he has begun the process· of disarma­ment, which is a great achieve­ment." 
Michael Gannon Senior 


"''d tell the President he's a lame duck, and that he should not press for more Contra aid, be­cause the Nicaraguans were satisfied with their situations before we got Involved. He should just go out In style by letting things flow as they would without him interfering." 

Bob White Sophmore 

"It's unfortunate that the Presi­dent is coming here to talk about the Knute Rockne stamp, instead ofreallssues that concern college students in the United States." 
Maureen O'Brien Junior 


"I don't 
think that the President ­will change his foreign policy at this point. I think that under­standing other members In the global market Is very important, and his administration did not do that. In retrospect, I would like to ask him about this deficiency In his foreign policy." 
Cyretha Irving Graduate student

ahead on points in the third round when Kane hit Reardon with a straight left, dropping him to one knee. But luckily for Reardon, he was far enough ahead in the minds of the judges to win on a split deci­sion. 
In the welterweight division, John 'Bull-Bull' Bastian stopped Sean 'The Commie Kil­ler' O'Brien at 1:25 of the second round to score the first knockout of the night. 
Turning to the midleweight division, Steve 'Slim' Reidl staged a comeback from a tough first round to defeat Pat 'The Bleeder' O'Neill in a split decision. 
Favorite Dan 'The Anchor 
Man' Gamache was able to hold off a strong challenge from Marty 'M-Train' Falken­berg to win his super mid­dleweight fight.

The next fight saw short, stocky light heavyweight Chris 'Boom-Boom' Balint win im­pressively over John 'The Legend' Schmit. 
In the other light heavyweight match, Mike 'Hello Holmes' Kelly won over Tom 'K.O.' Cummings in a hard-fought split decision. 
Defending heavyweight champion John Uhll had the strongest showing of the night. 
Mter several shots to the body, a straight right floored Griffin, who was given a standing eight count. Uhll quickly followed with a stinging right to the face, sen­ding Griffin to one knee at the sound of the bell. The referee then stopped the fight to give Uhll the victory. 
In the final match of the night, heavyweight Panos 'The Terminator' Tsicopoulus held on for a split decision victory over Richard 'Richie Rich' Jen­nings.

Notre Dame has managed a

Senior Michelle Dasso picked up both the singles victories, winning from the number-one singles position against both Miami and Illinois. 
In doubles competition, freshman Cathy Bradshaw and sophomore Jacqueline Uhll emerged victorious over Colorado's number-three doubles tandem. Against Miami, Dasso and sophomore Alice Lohrer combined to defeat the Redskins' top-
seeded doubles team.

Southwest Missouri is the re­turning champ. Western Illi­nois was second at last year's meet followed by Illinois­Chicago in third. Welsh says it's hard to pick a favorite in this year's field because of the increased parity among the teams. 
"I think the meet is a lot more wide open at the top," Welsh said. ''A lot of the power has balanced itself out." 
If their record and individual performances mean anything, the Irish are definitely ready for the meet. They finished the season 13-3 in dual meets and took second in the National Catholic Meet to a strong Vil­lanova team. 
Notre Dame is· coming into the meet after winning the Mid­western Collegiate Conference Championships two weeks ago in Evansville. The Irish easily outdistanced the host Aces 589­

357. Brian Rini garnered Most Valuable Swimmer honors in that meet, winning the 200, 500 and 1650 freestyle events. 
"It reaffirmed that our preparations seem to be working for the championship season," Welsh said of that win. 
The women took fifth in the Midwest Independent Cham­pionships last weekend in Chicago, while the men had the weekend off. The women finished the season with a 9-7 ledger. 
The week of rest will prove valuable to the men in this meet. Welsh used the time off to concentrate on becoming mentally, as well as physically, prepared for the meet.

Fencers 
By CHRIS FILLIO Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's and women's fencing teams have selected the participants for this weekend's NCAA Midwest Regionals at Evanston, Ill. 
Irish coaches Michael DeCicco and Yves Auriol had a tough time making the deci­sions, but for DeCicco, it was enjoyable in that he was able to choose from a large pool of excellent fencers. 
"I'm in an enviable position, having to determine who will go to the NCAAs," said DeCicco earlier this week. 
Freshman sabreman Lesek N owosielski and junior epeeist Todd Griffee have already qualified for the NCAAs in their respective weapons. Both fen­cers turned in fine perfor­mances this past weekend at the Great Lakes Champion­ships, taking first in their divi­sions. 
Accompanying Nowosielski in sabre will be sophomore Danny Yu. Yu was chosen just ahead of freshman Chris Bauger, who also fared well this past weekend. The decision once again was extremely dif­ficult for DeCicco. 
"Chris Bauger is coming up now, and I don't think he's leveled off yet," said DeCicco. "He's got a fiery personality. It was definitely a tough deci­sion between him and Danny. But this kind of tournament, we have found, has always favored a Dan Yu. He has demon­

staunch opposition all year, and DeCicco sees their perfor­mances as a key indicator for the team's overall success. 
"How we do in the nationals will depend on which Todd Grif­fee and which Ted Fay show up this weekend," said DeCicco. "If Griffee and Fay give us a performance like they did at the USF A, then we will not con­cede the gold to Columbia." 
Columbia won the men's championship last year. This year they are returning practi­cally the same team and are heavily favored to repeat. 
Senior foilist Yehuda Kovacs garnered the first spot in that weapon after finishing second this past weekend. All season DeCicco has been pleased with Kovacs' consistent fencing, though the head coach con­cedes that at times his captain is prone to become erratic. 
"When Yehuda fences, he takes no prisoners," stated DeCicco. "What we need to do as coaches is to keep his emo­tion from dominating his fen­cing." 
The other foil position will be filled by freshman Phil Leary, who just edged out junior Derek Holeman for the spot. Al­though Leary is only in his in­itial year at the college varsity level, DeCicco senses that he is quite capable of the responsi­bility. 
"He's really been our strongest fencer," remarked DeCicco. "It may be very key for him at this time to have team support around him, es­

Part two of the Notre Dame baseball road show takes place this weekend, as the Irish tour their home state of Indiana. 
Notre Dame plays at Indiana State on Saturday afternoon, then heads to Bloomington for a doubleheader with Indiana University on Sunday. The wee~end trip comes a week after the Irish opened the season in North Carolina, and a week before a Spring Break trip to Texas. 
The Irish come into the weekend with a 1-3 record after splitting two games with Duke and getting swept by Wake For­est. The road does not look to get any easier this weekend, as the Sycamores and Hoosiers both are coming off successful seasons. 
"We face a big challenge this weekend," said Murphy. "In­diana and Indiana State are as good if not better than Wake Forest and Duke." 
Indiana State has partici­pated in the NCAA Regionals in each of the last two years, reaching the College World Se­ries in 1986. The Sycamores are 0-2 this season after getting swept by Alabama last 
,. 
weekend. 
Seven players from last season's 45-18-1 squad have ad­vanced to the professional ranks, but Indiana State still has plenty of hitting. Second baseman Mitch Hannahs (.372 average, nine home runs, 13 stolen bases, 56 runs batted in) and centerfielder Bob Zeihen (.336, 5, 15, 46) combine power and speed for the Sycamores. 
First baseman Jeff Buell is an­other long-ball threat, having hit 10 homers in just 26 games last season. 
Indiana State does not have quite as much depth on the mound. Alabama scored 27 runs in just two games against ISU last weekend. Kurt Olson, who batted .358 as a designated hitter last year, brings a 5-1 1987 record back to the pitching staff. 
When the Irish road show leaves Terre Haute for Bloomington on Sunday, Notre Dame will have to cope with an old nemesis in the Indiana Hoosiers. The Irish lost three games to Indiana this year, and going back to 1984, have lost seven consecutive meetings with the Hoosiers. 
that's what it takes for Phil to be successful, then that's what we'll do." 
For the women's competi­tion, it could be a longer road. At the beginning of the year, the Irish were favored to repeat as national champions. However, some doubt was cast when junior Janice Hynes was declared ineligible. Since then, the women have suffered three team losses to Midwestern rivals Wayne State. 
''Against most of our compe­tition, we can still win without our top fencers," said DeCicco. "But against four good fencers as in Wayne State, you can't afford this luxury. 
"What we need is a super ef­fort from Molly Sullivan and a very good effort from Anne Barreda," noted DeCicco. 
Senior captain Molly Sul­livan returns this weekend after competition in Europe. 
Joining Sullivan and Barreda most likely will be juniors Kris­tin Kralicek and Brenda Leiser. Their performances could spark a big upset for the Irish. 
"IfAnne Barreda and Kristin Kralicek come up with their two or three wins between them, along with Molly's effort, and then at least one or more from our number-four spot, then we could pull off a heck of a surprise against Wayne St.," said DeCicco. "How well the women do will hinge on those individual performances." 
Following this weekend's competition, the Irish will have almost three weeks to prepare for the NCAA championships at Princeton. 
Baseball team back on the road 
If the Irish are to change things this time, they will have to keep Hoosier shortstop Mickey Morandini off the basepaths. The pre-season All­American hit .370, stole 41 bases, hit 10 home runs and was a general pain in the neck to opposing pitchers last season. 
The Hoosiers return some quality pitching from last season's 43-17 club. Indiana's ace, Doug Peters, compiled a 7-1 record and a 2.91 earned run average in his freshman cam­paign last year. 
Notre Dame scored 35 runs in its first four games last weekend, but could not get much success from its pitching staff.

Year of the Boilermakers? 
No. 2 Purdue eager to change its post-season fortune 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Purdue's closest challenger for the Big Ten basketball championship is the same team that kept the Boilermakers from the out­right league title and an auto­matic NCAA berth a year ago. 
Then, as now, Purdue had sole possession of first place in the conference and had only to win the rest of its games to clinch its first outright cham­pionship since 1969. 
But the Boilermakers . stumbled 104-68 in a nationally televised game at Michigan in the season windup. That gave Indiana a share of the· Big Ten crown, and the Hoosiers -not the Boilermakers -were given a first-and second-round ad­vantage with an NCAA assign­ment to the Hoosier Dome in Indiana polis. 
If second-ranked Purdue can hold onto the lead this year, its reward likely would t~ a jaunt upstate to South Bend for a first-round game at No~re Dame. 
"We put a lot of pressure on 
ourselves to win. When we did 
that, it was like somebody 
poked a needle in our balloon 
and let the air out,'' Coach 
Gene Keady says of last year's 
collapse. "We haven't talked 
about the Big Ten champion­
ship (this year); we have 
talked about getting a good 
(NCAA) draw." 
Instead of a trip down Interstate-65 to Indianapolis, Purdue went east to Syracuse and lost to Florida in the second round of the 1987 NCAA tourn­ament. Indiana, of course, swept through the first two rounds at Indianapolis, the regional at nearby Cincinnati and captured its fifth NCAA crown in New Orleans. 
Now the Boilermakers have 
a two-game lead on Michigan's 
lOth-ranked Wolverines with 
four games left, and the two 
contenders meet for the second 
time this season on Saturday 
at West Lafayette. Purdue won

bor.

With the rising of the sun on Friday, 11 Notre Dame men's track team members will begin their journey to the campus of Princeton University and the the Intercollegiate Amateur Association of America Cham­pionships (IC4A's). 
The IC4A conference is the oldest in the country and fea­tures 121 teams. It includes all East Coast teams north of Washington, D.C. Notre Dame remained in the conference when the NCAA created its own version of the indoor champion­ships over twenty years ago. 
"It is a half step from the NCAA Championships," said Irish coach Joe Piane. 
Piane has high expectations for his team this weekend. 
"If we finish in the top 10, then we've done a great great job," said Piane. "Most of our Athletes are from the east coast, s.:. they're really pumped up about going back home. It should be a good meet.'' 
Favorites this weekend in­clude Penn State and Geor­getown, but no one team is ex­pected to dominate. 
The Irish will be sending a variety of athletes to Prince­ton. Sophomore Glenn Watson will run in the 55-meter high hurdles. Watson had his best time of the season (7: 39) at last weekend's Alex Wilson Invita­tional, and he will be seeded sixth in the meet. 
Junior Ron Markezich qualified for the 5000 meters with a time of 14:19 at the Central Collegiate Conference Meet. Markezich will be seeded fourth in the IC4A's. Junior David Warth will compete in the 800 meters after qualifying at 1:50:40 in the Ray Meyo In­vitational. 
Notre Dame also has a pair of freshman jumpers par­ticipating this weekend in John Cole and Jeff Smith. Smith qualified in the long jump with a leap of 23' 11 314". Cole will be competing in the high qual­ifying with a jump of 6 feet 10 314 inches. Smith should be seeded lOth while Cole should be seeded eighth. 
Sophomore Chris Com­ponovo will represent the Ir~sh in the pole vault after vaultmg 15' 3" at the Central Collegiate Conference Meet. 
Sophomore Yan Searcy wi~l run in the 500-meter competi­tion after qualifying with a 1 : 04 time at the Indiana Intercol­legiates. The distance medley relay team, comprised of soph­omore Mike Rogan, freshman Robert Harris, sophomore Mike O'Connor, and senior co­captain Dan Garrett will see plenty of action. They will run in the 800 400, 1200, and the 1600­meter competitions. The relay qualified by running 9: ~7 and will be one of the favontes at the meet.

The close of the 1988 Winter Olympics has left many Americans wondering what happened to the stars of the past Olympics. 
The especially disappointing losses of both Dan Jansen and Debi Thomas crushed the spirit of many Americans. The Americans sadly ended-up with only six medals. 
There were more Olympic stars performing in the broad­casting booth for ABC then performing on the ice and snow for America. 
People always look forward to the excitement of the Olympics, unfortunately that excitement is severely dampened when the total number of medals won in the entire Olympics is less than then some Olympians have won in their single event. 
The Olympic Committee realized the need for a change, so they put George Steinbrenner in charge of an improve­ment committee. Now that change is a big one, but only time will tell if it is a change for the better.

The prominence of Steinbrenner brings more attention to what he will do. The New York Yankees have not won a World Series in a long time, but when they did win they won convincingly. Perhaps Steinbrenner can put America back on that winning track. 
The American Olympians need the support of the country more now than they ever have. The losers always need more attention than the winners. 
Instead of making jokes or whining about how poorly the Olympians performed, people should find solutions. America must never again let their athletes suffer so many 
losses. Lack of money is a problem that needs to be remedied. People love to support a winning team and if people believe that the Americans will win, they will support them. 
Americans can produce the best athletes in the world if the time and money put into them exceeds that of other countries. 
Young athletes need the inspiration of past Olympic greats like Dorothy Hamil and Eric Heiden to encourage them to strive for excellence. 
The 1988 Winter Olympics lacked the heros of the past, and showed the need for improvement by the Americans athletes and people.

Irish douse weak Flames 79-50 
after slow first half performance 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
CHICAGO -Notre Dame head 
coach Muffet McGraw said 
before Wednesday night's 
game at Illinois-Chicago that 
her team needed a big win to 
wash away the after effects of 
Sunday's heartbreaking loss to 
DePaul. 

While .the 79-50 win over the Flames was big scorewise, it wasn't the type of win that she had expected. 
UIC, which fell to 2-25 with the loss, trailed only 29-28 at the half and were down 37-35 with 16:19 to play. That's when the Irish turned up their heat, outscoring the Flames 21-2 for the next 6: 21, to end any hopes of an upset that would have been near biblical proportions. 
"It really wasn't (what we sing shots. Frascati had 14 expected)," McGraw said of points in the half and 21 for the the win which raised her game. At the 13:05 mark, team's record to 19-7.
