PTL trial suspended, Bakker committed 
Associated Press 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -Jim Bakker was committed to a mental institution in handcuffs and leg shackles Thursday after a psychiatrist reported the TV evangelist was halluci­nating and cowering in a fetal position in his lawyer's office. 
U.S. District Judge Robert Potter suspended Bakker's fraud trial and ordered him to the Federal Correctional Institute in Butner for up to 60 days for psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he is competent to stand trial. 
"Please don't do this to me," a sobbing, disheveled Bakker said as he was led from his lawyer's office by U.S. marshals to the courthouse for processing of the commitment order. He curled up in a fetal position in the back seat. 
"Mr. Bakker, I'm going to have to ask you to sit up, please," a deputy marshal said. 
After the paperwork was completed, Bakker, bound hand and foot, was taken to Butner to spend his first night behind bars since the PTL scandal broke. The ,evangelist is ac­cused of fleecing followers of his evangelical empire. 
He was lying in the back seat of a marshal's car when he ar­rived, and a marshal held him on each side as he walked in a slow, stooped shuffle into the prison. 
Dr. Basil Jackson, a psychia­trist who has been treating Bakker for nine months, told the judge that Bakker began hallucinating Wednesday after a former PTL executive testify­ing against him collapsed on

Colombia needs U.S. aid 
By SARAH VOIGT Senior Staff Reporter 
Father Robert Pelton, director of Notre Dame's Institute for Pastoral and Social Ministry, believes that the United States should of­fer aid to President Virgilio Barco's crusade against the drug barons in Colombia in the form of economic sanc­tions and educational pro­grams.
Pelton, who has visited South America 15 times in the last five years, rejects di­rect U.S. military interfer­ence as a viable way to fight the powerful drug barons in Colombia. 
Pelton cites previous U.S. foreign policy blunders as support for his stance. He said, "If you move in with immediate military control, all you get is greater vio­lence. Some people would be happy to move in [to Colombia] with Marines. But in reality, a long term edu­cation process is all that can

be used to help bring about change." 
Pelton, a Holy Cross priest, was a missionary in Santiago for eight years and has worked on Church mis­sions in Peru, Colombia and Bolivia many times since then. This past summer Pelton visited Medellin, where he spent some time with the family of his friend Alvaro Villa, who was kid­napped July 7 and has not yet been released 
Pelton suspects that his friend was kidnapped by common delinquents. Pelton explains, "I was very aware of the violence when I was in Medellin. There are so many kidnapings going on now that the authorities have stopped recording them. " 
Villa, an agronomist who has spent the last thirty years educating the peasants about better agricultural methods, seems an unlikely target for a kidnapping. His disappearance is another tragic event that can be added to the chaotic se­quence of crimes that have plagued Colombia the last few months. 
According to Pelton, Colombia's economic prob­lems are at the root of its drug situation. What Pelton refers to as,"the bad eco­nomic conditions and en­demic underdevelopment of third world countries" en­able the drug barons to ma­nipulate the peasants into growing crops of illegal drugs. 
Pelton said that the U.S. needs to -help the peasants find other crops besides drugs that they could grow and still make a good liveli­hood. This would undermine the power of the drug barons and indirectly help stop the flow of illegal drugs into the U.S.

University to build graduate student housing complex 
By MICHAEL SCHOLL News Staff 
Notre Dame is now in the preliminary stages of develop­ing a 200-apartment housing complex for graduate students. 
The proposed development, to be located north of the O'Hara­Grace Graduate housing com­plex, will be comprised of 33 two-story units, with each unit containing six two bedroom apartments. A community cen­ter will be included in the com­plex, which is designed to house approximately 400 students. 
According to a press release, the complex will be partially underwritten by Notre Dame alumnus Charles Fischer of Fort Worth, Texas. Fischer re­ceived his engineering degree from Notre Dame in 1949 and an M.B.A. from Stanford University in 1952. 
He is currently president and chairman of the board of the Harbison-Fischer Manufact­uring Company, which is the world's leading manufacturer of subsurface oil well pumps. Fischer also serves on the Advisory Council for the College of Engineering. His son, Ken, is a 1988 graduate of the University, and another son, David, graduated last May. A daughter, Teresa, is currently a senior at Notre Dame. 
According to Thomas Mason, the University's vice president for business affairs, Fischer will donate $5 million to the estimated $12 million project. The balance of the money needed for construction is scheduled to be raised through loans that will be paid back with the rent money paid by the students who will live in the complex. 
Mason said that rents for the complex "would be competitive with rents charged for other apartments in the local area.n Rents for two bedroom apart­ments near the Notre Dame campus average approximately $450 a month.

WORLD WAR II: 50 YEARS LATER 
50 years later Germany reflects on the horrors of WW II 
Associated Press 
FRANKFURT, West Germany -World War II began 50 years ago today. One of many events marking the grim anniversary will be a concert in Warsaw, the first target of blitzkrieg, Adolf Hitler's fearsome "lightning war." 
The Soviet Union called the conflict "the most horrible and destructive of all wars." An ul­tra-conservative West German Cabinet minister said Germans should not bear all the blame. 
More than 50 million people were killed in the war touched off by the German invasion of Poland on Sept. 1, 1939. The Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews shocked the world like no other atrocity. 
Major events are scheduled for Friday in West Germany, East Germany and Poland, in· eluding an internationally broadcast concert in Warsaw conducted by Leonard Bern­stein. 
Pope John Paul II used the occasion to declare: "We have a duty to learn from the past so that never again will there arise a set of factors capable of trig­gering a similar conflagration." 
In the statement issued last weekend, he called the Nazi slaughter of Jews something "which will forever remain a shame for humanity." 
John Paul is to address his 
Polish countrymen Friday evening by means of a huge television screen set up in Royal Castle Square in Warsaw's old city. 
Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said Thursday: "The sad jubilee -50 years since the beginning of the most horrible and destructive of all wars ­requires that the world public not only learn the lessons of the past anew, but also determine guidelines for the future." 
Its commentary repeated So­viet calls for a reduction of armed forces and weapons in Europe. 
Neues Deutschland, the offi­cial newspaper of East Ger­many's Communist Party, said: "The most important historical lesson of Sept. 1, 1939, consists of never again letting fascism return." 
In Hitler's native Austria, which he occupied and annexed in 1938 witho'ut firing a shot, the popular tabloid Kurier is running a daily series it calls "Hitler's War." 
"It scarcely ever happened in history that the responsibility for a war was so clear," the newspaper said Monday. "It was, in the end, the work of one man. It was Hitler's war." 
Austria has claimed to be the dictator's first victim. News media, politicians and intellectuals in West Germany 
have used the anniversary for a review of Nazi atrocities. 
Special events included a con­cert Thursday night jn Frank­furt featuring violinist Anne­Sophie Mutter and Polish com­poser Krzysztof Penderecki conducting his "Polish Re­quiem." 
As a gesture of );OCOnciliation, the government said it was willing to return the Polish Em­bassy in Berlin, seized by the Nazis in 1941, to Polish owner­ship. 
The far right in Germany has taken the opportunity to try to shift some of the blame.

NATIONAL BRIEFS 
Oscar-winning actor Marlon Branda says he's made his last movie -and it's a dud. "It's horrible," he said of "The Freshman." "It's going to be a flop, but after this, I'm retiring. I'm so fed up. This picture, except for the Canadian crew, was an extremely unpleasant experience. I wish I hadn't finished with a stinker." Brando, 65, who has been shooting the movie in Canada. for the past 12 weeks, also told the Toronto Globe and Mail on Wednesday that he's fed up with kowtowing to the Hollywood publicity system, detests New York and adores Canada. "I've come from New York, which is a warthog straight from hell. To sing my swan song here is very pleasant," said Brando, who made his name in stage productions in the late 1940s and went on to such as movies as "On The Waterfront" and "The Godfather." "This is my last day," he said at the conclusion of the lunchtime interview as he was called back to the set. "Two more shots and I'm done with this madness ... You can't imagine how happy I 
am.'' 
A male nurse accused of having sex with a patient with multiple personality disorder while she was in a child per­sonality faces a Sept. 21 licensing hearing before the Utah Board of Nursing. Richard Heinecke faces two counts of unprofessional conduct . He faces possible loss of his license. Heinecke, a regis­tered nurse, is alleged to have been intimate with a patient admit­ted to the psychiatric unit of a Salt Lake Valley hospital in March 1988. Heinecke had sex with the woman while she was in the hos­pital, took her to his home after she was discharged, then moved with her into the home she shared with her husband, according to the petition. The husband subsequently discovered his wife in bed with the nurse, the division said. 
The Rolling Stones opened their first concert tour in eight years with fireworks and Mick Jagger's trademark strut as 50,000 fans jumped to their feet and began a night of dancing at their seats. The Stones launched their 29-city "Steel Wheels" tour with concerts at Veterans Stadium Thursday and Friday. Concertgoers paid $28.50 apiece for tickets, which sold out in two hours, 45 minutes. Scalpers were getting as much as $200 a ticket. 
The bears are back. Just ask Betty Klasnya. "I was sitting on my back steps, going through a bag of seeds for planting, when I felt something was out there looking at me," said Klasnya. The "something" was a 200-pound black bear in her back yard relish­ing the aroma of pork chops frying on the stove. She ran inside, replaced the pork chops with garlic and onions to encourage the bear's departure, clapped her hands and made a fuss until the 
f. 
animal sauntered back into the woods. ''I'm not going to fry pork chops or bacon till the bear season is over," she said. Since last week's encounter, police have received more than 20 reports of bear sightings around this Lake Superior city. 
Jerry Lewis says his loss of an unborn child has given him a new understanding of parents whose children die of muscular dys­trophy. "I thought I knew what I was talking about," Lewis said in an interview Wednesday, recalling years of dealing with parents of MD victims. Lewis has been national chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy Association for 40 years. The comedian's 21 1/2-hour, annual Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon begins at 9 p.m. EDT Sunday and will be carried on 200 TV stations in the United States and Canada. Last year's fund-raiser was watched by some 90 mil­lion people. 
More than 50 million useless urinalyses are performed each year with simple chemical "dipsticks" that cost more than $150 million and are unnecessary, medical researchers say. Two studies published in Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association found that dipstick urinalysis -the most commonly used urine test -is unjustified for healthy young men and women, though it may be useful for screening patients 60 years or older for unsuspected urinary problems. 


INDIANA BRIEFS 
The Indiana State Board of Health has declared a measles emergency in Lake County and plans to inoculate at least 20,000 students against the illness, officials said Thursday. The decision to go ahead with inoculations came as officials confirmed three cases of the viral disease and continued studies into several suspected incidents, said David McCarty, director of external ser­vices for the Indiana State Board of Health. McCarty said several factors were used in deciding where to inoculate including proxim­ity to Chicago, where 1,123 measles cases this summer have been reported to health officials. McCarty said the state has 20,000 doses of measles vaccine available and more would be secured if necessary.

Workers, punks and grandmas at the White Hen 
The first week back to school. A period when 
you spend at least 70 percent of the time rack­
ing what few brain cells are left in trying tli put 
names with the faces, and the other 30 percent 
asking the age-old questions, "How was your 
summer? What did you do?" (I admit I ask 
them also.) 
This was the first summer I actually liked my 
job. I've had it for three years, and have tried 
to finagle my way out of it since I started. But, 
since I too must make my annual contributions 
to the ND Bookstore, I had no choice but to go 
back to my job at White Hen. 
No, it's not a farm, and has nothing to do with eggs except for the fact that we sell them. White Hen (where the name comes from is way beyond me) is a convenience store, like 7-11. We sell everything from sandwiches to dog food, from baby food to bug killer. We are a one-stop shop kind of store. People run out to the store to buy just the items they needed immediately, like dog food and maple syrup, or doughnuts and mashed potatoes. Some very interesting combinations have passed by. 
The customers, though, are what made the job a lot of fun this year. We had many regular cus­tomers who would come in at least once a day, usually three or four times, for things like pop or coffee. I converted many to Irish fans, and, of course, I encountered many anti-Irish fans (those are the ones who didn't come in for days after we won down in Tempe). They made for some great arguments to add a little spice to my day. 
Some of these regulars are worth mentioning specifically, these being the construction work­ers. No land around my area was safe this summer from the rampant bulldozers and ce­ment trucks that scurried everywhere, and so at any given time of the day, at least two workers could be found hanging around the store. These guys should have a gender all their own: female, male, and construction workers. They would come in at 10 in the morning --just when most normal people are still enjoying doughnuts and coffee --and buy beer and beef jerkys. I felt sick just selling it to them. The same ones would be back at noon for a beer lunch, and again at 4 in the afternoon for their end-of-the-day case or three. And I thought guys here drank a lot?! Not even close. I don't think I'd feel too safe liv­ing in a house built by any of these guys. But they were always a lot of fun, even if they could turn a very innocent comment into proposition. 
I almost lost my mind with all the little kids that came in. Don't misunderstand, I love little kids, but not when they come in and dump about three dollars worth of small change on the counter and proceed inform me they do not know how to count. They have some kind of sixth sense that leads them to do this when no less than 10 people are in line behind them. These rug rats have one heck of an attitude, too. An "I'm ten, I know all" kind of mentality. Take this for example: after a certain suspi-

cious-acting trio had loitered in the store for over 10 minutes and managed to handle almost every item, I asked them to leave. They had the nerve to tell me that this is a free country and they can do what they want. After suppressing an urge to physically take them out of society right then and there, I informed them that since I was just a wee bit taller and older they had better leave real quick before they were in real trouble. 
What was a real stitch was the thirteen-year boy that tried --unsuccessfully I would like to add--to pick me up. Very scary. 
Many different types of people came in. There was "the dude" as we called him simply because no other name was appropriate. He did repair work for something like Joe's Air Conditioning, and had to wear one of those one-piece outfits in a horrible shade of green. But this guy ap­peared to enjoy wearing it, along with his cow­boy boots, and swoosh hair style (you know what kind I mean: it looks like he spent most of the morning with a blow dryer), and always walked and talked like God's gift to women. We always had to bite our tongues to hold back our laughter. 
The several ladies I worked with made the job even more fun. They were old enough to be ei­ther my mother or my grandmother, and yet were always pointing out prospective dates for me. and always managed to embarrass me until I turned bright red. 
I think the biggest kick was all the junior-high kids who came in attempting to buy cigarettes. The aghast and surprised looks on their faces when asked for ID was simply hysterical {they have to be 18). The classic case being a girl around 16 replying "They don't even card me at the bar!" Yeah, sure, and I'm on Social Secu­rity. 
The job wasn't all fun; there were certain drawbacks. Many of the workers came in with­out shirts and consequently cleared our sinuses for a couple hours. People wanting to buy beer and did not have a valid Illinois driver's license became very irate. Those are some interesting stories, but they are not printable. 
The way it looks I will probably be back over Christmas break for I'm sure I will have spent all my money by then. What's kind of scary is that I'm looking forward to it. Maybe I'll come back here with 13-year old boyfriend ...

By BRADLEY GALKO Staff Reporter 
By the end of this year, a new method will have been devel­oped to test an individual's sus­ceptibility to heart attack or stroke that is quick, more pre­cise, and more convenient than any present methods. 
The new test kit has been de­veloped by American Biogenetic Sciences, Inc. (ABS), a biotech­nology company founded in 1983 in collaboration with Notre Dame. 
"If things go as they should, we expect the kit to be finished around the end of this year," said ABS President Henry Nordhoff. He added, "We should have a test on the mar­ket in Europe and probably in the United States by the end of next year." 
The potential worldwide market could reach $500 mil­lion, according to a statement by ABS. 
The kit works by detecting the level of fibrinogen in a person's blood. According to a University news release, "Initial ABS research led to the devel­opment of a unique monoclonal antibody that targets fibrino­gen in a patient's blood. 
Fibrinogen is the precursor to fibrin, the main component of blood clots, which cause heart attacks and strokes by blocking the flow of blood to the heart and brain." 
An elevated fibrinogen level has been identified as one of the major risk factors to devel­oping coronary artery disease. "It (fibrinogen level) is a marker," said Nordhoff, "a more important indicator for coronary artery disease than smoking, obesity, ... second only to elevated blood pres­sure." 
The finished kit will have two forms, said Nordhoff, a five minute test to gauge if a patient has high levels of fibrinogen and a second quantifying test that would take about an hour to measure the levels of fib­rinogen in the blood. 
Nordhoff estimated that the five-minute version, which can be performed in a doctor's of­fice or hospital bedside, will cost three to five dollars. The longer version, performed in a lab, will cost the patient one to two dollars, he said. 
Because blood is drawn out of the patient, said Nordhoff, the test has no side effects. "(That is) one of the reasons the approval is so swift," he added. Nordhoff estimates the FDA approval time at an un­commonly short three months. 
The kit is expected to be pro­duced in conjunction with Biotrin Research, affiliated with of Dublin. 
Ireland. "The two companies are likely to sign manufacturing and distribution agreements that will result in the kit being manufactured in Ireland," the news release said. 
Labor in Ireland is both good and relatively inexpensive, grants can be obtained from the Irish Development Authority, and imports to Europe and their revenues would be tariff and tax free, said Nordhoff. 
Nordhoff estimated that about half of ABS's 20 full and part-time scientists are dedi­cated to monoclonal antibody research. Research is per­formed at the Reynier's Germ­free Life Building on the north end of campus. 
This diagnostic test is the first of two antibodies ABS hopes to develop for the diag­nosis and treatment of cardio­vascular disease. In addition to the fibrinogen antibody, desig­nated 45J, ABS is working on the development of another an­tibody, MH-1, to detect blood clots on X-rays with a potential world wide market of $600 million. 
MH-1 could also be used to carry clot dissolving drugs to the site of.a clot. The worldwide market for this field is expected to reach $1.7 billion by 1990,

Pavarotti is banished from Chicago opera 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -Tenor Luciano Pavarotti and his high C's have been banished from the Lyric Opera. where officials say they tired of hearing the same old song after he once again canceled his appearances for the season. 
"Lyric Opera is now unwilling to take the risk of one more cancellation by Mr. Pavarotti," said general director Ardis Krainik. "I'm very sad about this.... But I didn't have any choice. A lot of people have been very mad about his cancel­lations." 
The last straw came when Pavarotti, 53, canceled six per­formances as Cavaradossi in Puccini's "Tosca," scheduled at the Civic Opera House for late September and early October, citing an inflamed sciatic nerve, Miss Krainik said. 
Pavarotti has backed out of 
26 of his 41 scheduled perfor­
mances with the Lyric since 
1981, she said. 
Pavarotti's New York-based manager, }lerbert Breslin, said he spoke with the tenor Thurs­day at his home in Modena, Italy, and Pavarotti issued a statement saying that he agreed "there should be no fu­ture collaboration" with the Lyric. 
"It is true that most of the cancellations in my career have happened with the Lyric Opera of Chicago, so I understand very well the disappointment that they have," Pavarotti said. 
"I can say that if I am not good luck to the Lyric Opera of Chicago, then perhaps the Lyric Opera of Chicago is not good luck to me." 
Breslin said he considered Krainik's reaction "a little bit irrational." 


A group of wom~n wielding placards were stopped by police prior to being arrested, in downtown Cape T~~n. South Afnca, on Wednesday. The women emerged from a church and intended to march to the Bnt1~h Embassy to ask that Britain intercede in the South African government's stand on the recent de­tention of students and the three activists that are still being held.

"Mr. Bakker reported that when he left the courthouse Wednesday, suddenly people outside took on the form of frightening animals which he felt were intent on destroying him, attacking him and hurting him," Jackson said.

tion worsened overnight, even after he was given Xanax, an anti-depressant sedative. Bakker was not in court for the hearing. 
On Thursday morning, Bakker "was lying in the corner of his attorney's office with his head under a couch, hiding," Jackson said. "He was express­ing thoughts that someone was going to hurt him." 
"To put it in lay language, the man is stressed out," Jackson said later. 
Prosecution and defense lawyers are under court order not to discuss the trial outside of the courtroom. But during the hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller described the psychiatrist as a "hired gun."

Bakker and other PTL execu­tives are accused of diverting for their own use more than $4 million of $158 million raised from followers who gave $1,000 for three nights' free lodging each year for life at the ministry's hotels. 
If convicted on all 24 counts, Bakker could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined $5 million. 
Bakker's wife, Tammy, told reporters her husband was very distressed by the collapse in the courtroom Wednesday of former PTL executive Steve Nelson, a prosecution witness. 
"I knew when I talked to Jim last night that he was in a ter­rible emotional trauma and I prayed with him and we agreed that we would trust the Lord," she said outside her home in Orlando, Fla. 
Waigel did not say who should share the guilt, but many on the far right claim So­viet dictator Josef Stalin also was responsible. The minister wrote in the latest issue of the Bayernkurier, party organ of his ultraconservative Christian Social Union. 
Franz Schoenhuber, leader of the extremist Republican Party, spoke of the "war guilt of the Soviets, who together with Hitler brought the people of Eastern Europe under their yoke"-a reference to the So­viet absorption of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania under a 1939 pact with Hitler. 
Schoenhuber said an interna­tional panel of historians should be appointed to reassess whether Germans alone were responsible for the war.

E. Germans allowed to leave for the West 
Associated Press 
BONN, West Germany ­Hungarian and West German officials have worked out a plan that will let up to 20,000 East Germans leave for the West over the next few days, government sources disclosed Thursday. 
West German Karsten Voigt, foreign affairs expert for the opposition Social Democrats, told reporters in Budapest se­nior Hungarian officials con­firmed to him they plan to let out all East Germans who want to leave for West Germany. 
"I assume that in a very short time East German citizens (in Hungary) who want to go to West Germany will be able to," Voigt told the West German ZDF television network in an evening interview from Bu­dapest. 
About 10 percent of the 150,000 to 200,000 East Ger­mans vacationing in Hungary are thought to be seeking pas­sage to West Germany, and Bonn and Budapest have agreed to help them, the gov­ernment sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Both Hungary and East Ger­
many are under communist 
governments and are in the So­
viet camp, but Hungary has 
embraced Western-style re­
forms and is seeking closer ties 
to the West, while East Ger­
many has shunned reform. 
In Vienna, Austrian officials 
confirmed that Bonn asked

them to arrange for special rail transportation for up to 20,000 East Germans to West Ger­many. 
Voigt discussed the emigres situation in Budapest on 
Thursday with Hungary's Communist Party president, Rezso Nyers, and Foreign Min­istry officials and later said he was told all would be allowed to leave. 
"I was told this could only be a one-time thing. And it is cer­tainly important for the East German leadership to tolerate such a solution if not support it," Voigt said. 
Hungary will let the East Germans out under the auspices of the Red Cross or some other international humanitarian organization, he said. 
Voigt said Hungary guaran­teed that possessions left be­hind by the East Germans in Hungary could be returned to them. 
The apparent plan to allow East Germans out of Hungary without the usual documents authorizing their departure may have been intentionally leaked by West German officials earlier Thursday to let potential emigres in East Germany know about the rare escape opportunity. 
Most areas of East Germany receive Western radio or TV broadcasts. 
Asked if Austria had agreed to allow the escapes during the next few days, one West Ger­man official told The Associ­ated Press: "I cannot deny that."

For Leona, tax evasion pays 
"Only the little people pay taxes ... " 
...and only crooks go to jail. 
Wednesday, self-professed hotel queen Leona llelmsley was convicted on several counts of tax evasion, among other things. llelmsley managed to dodge a cool $1.2 million in taxes by charging personal ex­penses to her business empire. This is not to say that she merely wrote off a couple of extra lunches at Maxime's. In fact, Leona saw fit to write off everything from her swimming pool, to her palace-like home in Greenwich, Connecticut, to her girdles. Talk about expense ac­counts. 
Mayor Ed Koch called her "The Wicked Witch of the West." After listening to clips of the trial on the news every night in New York this summer, maybe I've come to agree with him. Then again, she could have been misguided by her accoun­tants. In the end, however, she was definitely wrong, guilty, and out of control. 
I can't say that I have any sympathy for her. It was rough working this summer, only to have Uncle Sam take nearly a third of every paycheck. Still, what's $1.2 million when you have a multi-million, if not bil­lion-dollar empire? The answer is: not much. Moreover, it's highly unlikely that the regal Mrs. Helmsley will ever spend a 
single day behind bars. If so, it will certainly be a prison of the country club type, surely lo­cated in scenic Westchester

County, New York, just minutes from her Greenwich estate. It's awfully hard being Leona. 
I'm not saying that taxes are altogether bad and that we shouldn't be taxed at all, but I do think that the current tax structure, and the attitudes that emerge from it are dis­graceful. Where else but in America will a private contrac­tor make several millions less than developer Donald Trump, and be included in a higher tax bracket? Where else do people spend billions of dollars a year to hire accountants to keep their books, all in the effort to avoid paying that same money to the government? Think of all the business majors who would be out of work if this weren't the case. 
It would be a wonderful world if this society could function as well as it does without the need for taxes, but unfortunately, they're here to stay. After all, where would we be without Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, ROTC, and even the grants and loans that enable us to attend this very university? 
Problems arise not because we have to support such pro­grams through taxes, but be­cause these programs have grown at phenomenal rates, so much so, that they have also 
grown out of control. The gov­
ernment has become as adept 
at spending as Leona Helmsley . 
The issue is not whether we 
should have government sup­
ported programs, but that if we 
are to support such worthwhile 
programs, we should learn to 
do so efficiently-or not at all. 
Leona's $1.2 million could re­
ally go to work, but more likely, 
it will be collected and go down 
the drain. 
Mike Dukakis just raised taxes in Massachusetts (again). If the people in that state are willing to put up with such outrageous tax rates, and even more outrageous waste, so be it. I personally would rather move to another state. I'm more than happy to pay my just amount in taxes, whatever that might be, but there has got to be a better way of determining just what that is. Moreover, we must ensure that everyone is made to pay her share. 
When we see people like Leona Helmsley we have to question whether or not our tax system is really serving the citizens of this country. The Helmsley case is a disgrace for this nation. Our tax system, and the way we allocate those taxes, are in need of reforJl!. Otherwise, the Helmsley case will not be a curiosity, but a commonplace sign of the dete­rioration of America.

Treasurer calls for more student involvement in spending funds 
Dear Editor: 
Once again this summer, we received a bill on our University statement for the student activ­ity fee. This $55.00 charge to all undergraduates goes toward payment of many campus-wide events as well as for student run organizations throughout the school year. As Student Body Treasurer, I am account­able for where that money goes, and the manner in which it is spent. 
It is the Treasurer's respon­sibility to see that the money students pay every year is dis­tributed in the fairest way pos­sible. Each transaction pro­cessed must pass three criteria: 1.) it must be legal according to the student government consti­tution; 2.) it must be for an organization that has been ap­proved for funding by the Office of Student Activities; 3.) the organization (be it club or class government) must have money in its budget to receive funds. 
One integral part of this sys­tem, the budgeting process, was completed at the end of last year by members of the Student Senate Budget and Finance Committee. This group consists of members from stu­dent government, the Student Union Board, and the Office of Student Activities. Together, we allocated the 1989-1990 stu­dent activity fee funds to over 120 student clubs,and organi­zations, as well as to student government, the Student Union Board, all four classes, the Hall President's Council 
(representing each dorm on 
campus), and other student 
groups such as the student se­
nators, the Judicial Council, 
and the Ombudsman Society. 
All clubs and organizations which applied for funding for this school year should b1~ re­ceiving official notification of their funding request via cam­pus mail this week. If you do not receive a letter, please con­tract the Treasurer's office immediately. 
Finally, one consistent issue of last year's student body elec­tions was that students were not fully aware of how their student activity fee was being spent. That perception will change this year only if you the student get involved. Talk to your class president or club of­ficers and find out how they plan to spend your fee. By get­ting involved in how these funds are utilized, you will be gaining a real say in how your money is being spent. 
Additionally, look for updates on the student activity fee bud­get here in The Observer as well as at meetings of the Student Senate every Monday evening. However, if you are ever in need of some immediate answers, feel free to stop by the Student Body Treasurer's Office on the 2nd floor of the LaFortune Student Center and we'll do our best to answer any questions you may have.

Norman takes one-shot advantage 1n Milwaukee Open 
Associated Press 
FRANKLIN, Wis.-Greg Norman shot an 8-under-par 64 Thursday in his first ap­pearance at the Greater Milwaukee Open and took a one-stroke lead after the open­ing round of the $800,000 tournament. 
Wayne Grady, Phil Blackmar, Curt Byrum and Steve Pate were one shot behind on a windy, overcast day at the 7 ,030-yard Tuckaway Country Club course. 
Norman, playing the back nine first, started slowly with a bogey-5 on the 444-yard lOth hole. 
But a birdie on the 525-yard 12th got Norman rolling. He finished the round with nine birdies, one on each of the course's four par-5s. 
Grady, playing in the same

mances from them that usu­ally comes after a year of col­lege football. 
Culver and Mihalko saw some time in the Irish backfield last season. Culver, a 6-2, 219 pound sophomore, who, ac­cording the the Notre Dame press guide is nicknamed Cookie, Bull, Tank, Pinball and Fireplug and played with Rock'em Sock'em Robots as a child, played in 11 games and carried the ball 30 times for 195 yards, with a 6.5 yards per carry average and three touch­downs. Mihalko, who played in nine games in 1988, is known for his blocking but also caught two passes from his fullback sopt. The 6-2, 234-pound junior received the Hering award for being the most improved offensive back in spring drills. 
The pair will join returning players Anthony Johnson and Rieky Watters to overcome the losses of Braxston Banks and Tony Brooks. 
Withe the transfer to UCLA of Arnold Ale, Andre Jones steps into the picture. The 6-4, 214­pound Jones, who is a favorite threesome with Norman, kept pace. He made two 40-foot putts and another from 60 feet for three birdies, and holed a sand wedge on the 390-yard fourth hole for an eagle-2. 
Blackmar, Byrum and Pate played the course in the after­noon when the wind picked up and a threat of rain lingered. But all three managed seven birdies on a course known for low scores. 
Alone in third was Steve Lowery with a 66 while seven others were at 67-Mark Lye, Hale Irwin, David Frost, Nick Price, Doug Weaver, Greg Ladehoff and Andrew Magee. 
Defending champion Ken Green withdrew with a sore back after a 1-under-par 71. 
Norman said his early morn­ing tee time was partially re­sponsible for his sluggish start. 
"It took about four or five 
holes to get my body in synch,"

of Irish fans because of his en­thusiasm on special teams, started four games at defensive end in 1988, amassing 18 tack­les and recovering a fumble against Navy. 
Dahl, a junior, will fit in to help bolster the tackle spot. A 6-5 junior, Dahl saw limited time for the Irish in '88, but is expected to fill in in a big way this year. 
Linebacker Donn Grimm may be the Irish replacement with the biggest shoes to fill, those of all-American Mike Stonebreaker. Grimm saw playing time in all games in 1988 with six tackles and two fumble recoveries in 85 min­utes. 
Grimm and tri-captain Ned Bolcar will lead the linebacking corps, one of the strongest po­sitions for the Irish in the na­tional championship season. 
"Don Grimm is a very good football player," Holtz says. "He works hard, he doesn't make mistakes, and I'm sure he'll do an awfully good job for us." 
The typical Irish line, from the players and the coaches, is that 'no one can replace (name one), but (so-and-so) will do a very good job.' 

he said. "You hope to get off to a good start and just continue. Now you have a foundation to build a tournament around." 
Playing with Grady, whom he has known for 16 years, was beneficial for Norman. 
"He's very easy going and he's one of the best putters out here. You see a guy like him and he makes a couple of 40­footers and it's like 'Ho-hum, it's no big deal,"' Norman said. 
"He's very loose and I admire him for what he's done. He stuck to his task and believed he could play in the United States and came over here and finally won. I'm happy for him." 
Grady insisted, however, that despite the one-shot difference, Norman played the course much better. 
"The difference between my 65 and Greg's 64 was about 10 miles," Grady said. "I always 
In their storied history, the Notre Dame football teams have made the most of situa­tions like this, using them as character-building opportuni­ties. Not only that, but, being Notre Dame, there can't a bad football player on the team. The replacements are all quality players, as seen by the fact that the team is considered at least, if not more, powerful and talented than last years'. 
Although the Irish have a lot going against them in the at­tempt to defend their national championship, any failure to do so won't be due to lack of tal­ent. 
enjoy playing with Greg. He just dragged me along. I had a good score but that's all. Tee to green, I didn't know where the ball was going." 
Bryum had five birdies on the front nine while Blackmar had the same number on the back. 
"I'm happy to have a good round in the wind for a change. It was definitely a factor," Byrum said. "But I was hitting as solid as I could and it wasn't affecting my ball that much." 
The 6-foot-7, 240-pound Blackmar said the low scores weren't surprising, despite the conditions. 
"Tuckaway is a good course for the longer hitter, but you can put up some good scores. The greens are soft for the most part and the course is playing good. The scores are low and they will continue to be, particularly if it rains," he said. 
Pate started with two birdies and stayed consistent through­out his round. 

"I was just hoping to shoot something under the par. Usually when the wind is blow­ing, you can have two or three shots that will stray on you. I didn't let anything get away," he said.

"A good defense is the best offense." If this time-honored sports proverb is true, the 1989 Notre Dame men's soccer team is destined to pick up right where last year's tremendously successful squad left off by challenging the top-ranked soc­cer powers in the nation. 
"Defense will be the key for the entire season," says Coach Dennis Grace, "Building from the defense out has always been our philosophy. We're going to have to keep the ball out of our own net if we're going to stay in some of these games early on." 

This weekend Virginia and St. Louis will be the first two op­ponents to challenge Grace's philosophy at the Adidas­Metropolitan Life Classic in Bloomington. The Irish meet the top-ranked Cavaliers today and the thirteenth-ranked Billikens from St. Louis Saturday. Indiana University will round out the four-team field. 
The Irish have some voids to fill in the forward and midfield positions if they are going to rise to .the occasion and knock off the Cavaliers or the 
Billikens this weekend. Last 
year's top five scorers were lost 
to graduation, so although the 
Irish return most of their de­
fensive starters from last 
year's 17-4-2 NCAA 
Tournament team, they have 
their work cut out for them. 
Juniors Dan Stebbins and Tom Connaghan are expected to pick up the scoring load where departed stars Tiger McCourt (111 career points), Joe Sternberg (1 06), and Randy Morris (96) left off. 
In addition, Grace says Steve LaVigne and Mitch Kern are capable of adding punch to the offense, as are promising freshmen Kevin Penden:!ast and Brendan Dillman. Pendergast was a high school All-American as well as the Player of the Year in Connecticut, while Dillman was an all-state per­former for Jesuit High School in Tampa, Fla. 
The Irish will look to co-cap­tains Rolfe Behrje and Dave Augustyn to fill the leadership roles vacated by McCourt, Sternberg and company. Grace will also look for senior goal­keeper Danny Lyons to assume some leadership responsibilities through the course of the sea­son.

Rice shines in first game 
By STEVE MEGARGEE 
Associate Sports Editor 

During Wednesday's pre­
game press conference for the 
Kickoff Classic, the captains of 
Notre Dame and Virginia each 
made some brief remarks. 

Notre Dame quarterback 
Tony Rice stepped to the 
podium and said, "I'd like to 
thank ~est Virginia for coming 
here... 

It was about the only mistake 
he made all week. 

The senior from Woodruff, 
South Carolina, led the Irish for 
five series in the first half. 

All five times. the Irish 
reached the end zone. 

"Tony's a gamer," said full­back and fellow tri-captain Anthony Johnson. "He plays well in practice, but he seems to turn it up a couple of notches for the games." 
Rice carried the ball eight times for· 70 yards and one touchdown Thursday. 
And to impress the few re­maining doubters of his passing ability, he was 7 -of-11 through the air for 147 yards. He had 125 passing yards at half time, and there really was no need for Notre Dame to throw after that. 
If you want to compare the Heisman Trophy race to a presidential election, Rice just captured the New Hampshire primary. 
"I'm happy for Rice because of all critics," said sophomore running back Rodney Culver. "When they say what's wrong about Tony, every time he proves them wrong." 
He fooled the critics at least three times last year. when he outperformed opposing quar­

of eleven passes for 14 7 yards and ran 70 yards on eight car­ries. Ismail, bruised toes and all, caught five passes for 121 yards. 
Once the second half started, Virginia came to life and scored twice. 
The again, by that point, it didn't really matter. Moore threw two touchdown passes on a pair of fourth downs-one to Derrick Dooley, the son of former Georgia coach Vince Dooley and the other to Bruce McConnigal. 
Notre Dame, using plenty of reserves, was unable to move the ball until the first offense led the Irish to a 31-yard Craig Hentrich field goal at 1:46 left in the game.

best goalkeepers in the coun­try," praises Grace, "Danny will never have an average, subpar season," 
Indeed, with a 1.01 goals­against-average last season, Lyons was superb in the net for the Irish, and he should be a bright spot again this season. 
"Overall, this team may be slightly more talented than last year's squad. The difference is that last year we were a much more experienced team. Experienced talent is very diffi­cult to replace, and our young players need playing time," says Grace, but he is quick to add that many of his players have improved tremendously over the winter and should be ready to step in and contribute in the goal-scoring department. 
The Irish will need to click on all cylinders if they are going to beat Virginia today. The top­ranked Cavaliers boast two re­turning first team All­Americans and eight returning starters. Sophomore goalie Tony Meola (0.31 goals­against-average last year) is considered to be the premier goalkeeper in the nation, an­choring a defense which gave

Notre Dame's replacements are a similar pack, thrust into the spotlight by circumstances byeond their controls. A bit inexperienced at times, they take to the field, and while they don't necessarily wing it, they aren't yet the polished performers of their predecessors. 
But unlike The Replacements of the stage, you won't find the Irish replacements stopping in the middle of a play, forgetting their place on the team or not caring about how they perform. They do, however, surpass the band in na­tional following. 
Ryan Mihalko, Rod Culver, Bob Dahl, Andre Jones and Donn Grimm are the Irish replacements, the guys charged with the tasks of trying to fill the shoes of the five Notre Dame players whose departures from the team stunned Notre Dame fans and made the pollsters rethink their picks. 
In addition, to fill out the depth charts, Lou Holtz and the Irish coaching staff have pushed the incoming freshmen, hurrying them along and requiring the type of perfor­
