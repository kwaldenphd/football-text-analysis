Few sex crimes reported annually 
National trends indicate many incidents not brought to police; victims seek other options 

By KAITLYNN RIELY Associate News Editor 
Rape and sexual assault are the most underreported crimes in the U.S., said a rep­resentative from S-0-S of Madison Center, the St. Joseph County rape crisis center in South Bend -and judging from statistics, Notre Security/Police (NDSP) statis­tics from 2003-05 show just one to two incidents of reported sex offenses each year -more recent numbers aren't available, but there were two more just last week -61 students reported "some kind of victimization experience" to the University Counseling Center last year, according to Rita Donley, the Center's associate director.

improvements in sewer systems and other utilities, which will in turn allow for the planned addi­tion and reconstruction of the Joyce Center, he said. 
"The [area] will have grass, landscaping and a nice pedes­trian feel," Lyphout said. "We expect to be done before the first home football game." 
Throughout the project, all entrances to the Joyce Center will accessible, Lyphout said. 
The second project will increase sanitary sewer capaci­ty leading to Notre Dame Stadinm, Lyphout said. Construction will begin immedi­ately east of Breen-Phillips Hall and continue southeast toward Notre Dame Stadium. 
The project was scheduled to begin this week, and Lyphout said they hope to begin con­struction within 10 days to two

Two major campus construc­tion projects -a sanitary sewer job and removal of a por­tion of Juniper Road -are slat­ed to begin this week, accord­ing to a Feb. 12 University press release. 
Both projects will cause mini­mal closures in certain areas on campus, University Vice President for Business Operations Jim Lyphout said Monday. 
On Monday, Lyphout said, snow removal began on the first section of Juniper to be removed -between Notre Dame Stadium and the Joyce Center. 
The road will be eliminated and replaced with a pedestrian­friendly plaza. In addition, the project will make possible

con1bine for meeting 
Shappell, Mcllduff bring groups together 
By KATIE KOHLER Assistant News Editor 
Nearly two months ago, Notre Dame Student Body President Lizzi Shappell and her Saint Mary's counterpart ·Susan Mcllduff scheduled a meeting to engage their student govern­ments in discussion of important issues facing both schools. The meeting will be the first of its kind in over four years. 
Tonight at 5:30 in the Student Government Offices at Saint Mary's, both presidents will for­mally meet for the third time this year, this time alongside the Saint Mary's Board of Governance (BOG) and the Notre Dame Council of Representatives (COR). 
"The meeting was our own idea and we are really using it as a networking session," Shappell said. "There is no set agenda." 
Agenda aside, a Feb. 13 col­umn by Observer columnist Jonathan Klingler attacked the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's rela­tionship, claiming that Saint Mary's is taking more than it is giving back. Shappell and Mcllduff, however, say they scheduled the meeting long before the editorial was printed and plan to keep the focus of the meeting on familiarizing their groups with the student govern-

Senior's portraits adorn local Club's hallw-ay 
By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 
For senior Kelly Hardy, her paintings are far more than something beautiful to look at ­they're a way to give back to South Bend. 
After spending last summer working at the Boys and Girls Club of St. Joseph County, Hardy created seven portraits of the children she had worked with as an assignment for her Multilevel Painting class. 
Hardy worked on the project for the entire Fall2006 semester -a feat that, until recently, she thought she would never accom­plish. 
"I had never really painted people before. It was something that I had always avoided even though I had been painting a long time," Hardy admitted. "[But] I decided ... to dive right in with huge, oversized [por­traits]." 
For Hardy, who first attended a painting class in second grade, art influences the way she inter­acts with kids today. 
"I think the best part about this was getting to know the kids individually by working with them, and then getting to know them at a different level by paint­ing them. .. . It brought a whole new level of meaning," Hardy said. 
Although Hardy did not origi­nally plan to donate the paint­ings, she felt that the Club would benefit most from them.

ND plans Mardi Gras meals, parties 
By MEGHAN WON~ News Writer 
You don't have to travel to New Orleans to celebrate "the feast before the fast" today, since Notre D·ame is bringing some Cajun culture to campus for Mardi Gras. 
French for "Fat Tuesday," Mardi Gras is the day of celebra­tion before Ash Wednesday, a solemn day which marks the beginning of the Lenten fasting season. 
If you want to partake in feast­ing, you can take a trip South ­to South Dining Hall -where chefs have been busy preparing for the annual Fat Tuesday feast. 
South Dining Hall will serve some Cajun favorites for dinner tonight, including rum raisin bread pudding, Louisiana red

Editor

Romans cursed so much. Anyway ... why am I here? Well, I guess the story begins a couple of days ago. 
I had a bad feeling. My flight was sched­uled for 1:30 p.m. on Friday afternoon. I was going home. I thought I should be more excited, but instead all I could think about was a Monday afternoon Theology exam (and 20 percent of my grade) looming in the distance. 
Needless to say, I did not leave South Bend at 1:30 p.m. Instead my fate consisted of delayed flights, a rebooking with another airline and a canceled flight before I finally arrived in Baltimore at 10 p.m. From there it was a short drive to my home city of Washington, D.C. 
I could barely enjoy the weekend before it was Sunday evening and time to head back to the airport. 
Once I arrived, I got through security eas­ily enough. Despite the fact the monitor proudly displayed On Time at my gate, we were delayed in D.C. for an hour. There goes my one hour layover in Detroit. .. 
I was off the plane in Detroit at 10:40 

p.m. My flight to South Bend left the gate at 
10:30 p.m. I was alone and spending the night in Detroit. 
Just as I was about to sit down and have a good cry, I spotted a girl at the gate count­er talking about South Bend. I immediately went up to her and introduced myself. Her name was Laura. 
Just knowing someone else was in my sit­uation and I suddenly wasn't alone in the world calmed me down. We walked togeth­er through the airport and swapped week­end horror stories. 
We arrived at ticket counter to get rebooked. I went first to an agent who said she would put me on a flight to South Bend via Cincinnati in the morning. Soon another agent showed up who helped Laura. 
'Try to get her on the same flight," said my ticket agent. 
As it ended up, Laura's agent must have been faster because she was booked on the flight and I wasn't. 
My ticket agent attempted to whisper to the other agent, "I don't have any more availability." 
I was too numb to be upset. Instead I wit­nessed one of the nicest things a stranger has ever tried to do for me . .Laura pleaded with the agent to cancel her booking so that I could have it. When she was told it would­n't work, she asked ifmy name could be put on the ticket instead. 
I couldn't believe it. She didn't even know me. Despite the reality that we had arrived at the counter together and she had as much right to be first as me, she was gen­uinely sorry about getting the ticket. 
Not only did she attempt to give me her seat, but she did this after being told all flights to South Bend were fully booked for the next day. 
But it all ended up working out. Somehow the agent found a seat for me on a direct flight to South Bend at 12:05 p.m. the next day and Laura kept her reservation. Within an hour, we were on a shuttle to a hotel and the next day, we both returned to Notre Dame.

Couple plans to wed in graveyard ceremony 
PACIFIC, Mo. -It's not the traditional "till death do us part," but Scott Amsler and Miranda Patterson believe getting hitched in a graveyard is just thinking outside the box.

weeks as plans are finalized. 
Pedestrians can expect mini­mal detours in the areas between Breen-Phillips Hall and the Hesburgh Library, and on the Hesburgh Library quadrangle, he said. 
The sewer system expansion is necessary due to recent growth, Lyphout said. 
"The sewer system has been taxed as the campus has grown," he said, noting that in the mid­1990s there was some flooding in Galvin Hall, Hesburgh Library and the IT building related to sewer use at Notre Dame Stadium. The project is intended to reduce the possibility of simi­lar backups in the future. 
They expect the project to be completed in six weeks, Lyphout said. 
Both project completion dates are subject to change due to weather and other factors. Still, weather issues tend to delay con­struction by "only a few days," Lyphout said. 
Lyphout said both projects are part of the University's "long term, master plan." 
The creation of the pedestrian plaza between the Joyce Center and Notre Dame Stadium is part of the scheduled removal of Juniper Road between Edison and Douglas Roads. The removal will continue north in the coming months, leading to construction of new service routes to Hank, Galvin, Friemann and Lobund buildings and reconstruction of the Hesburgh Library circle, including additional parking near the library. Construction to remove the portion of Juniper Road between the Band C park­ing lots south of the Joyce Center and Notre Dame Stadium will begin in March.

Mcllduff shared similar sen­timents about Klinger's column and the reaction it caused within the student body. 
"We don't want to go back [to that issue]. We are just going to focus on issues affect­ing both schools and the com­munity," she said. 
For the past two years, a member of BOG has held the position of tri-campus commis­sioner, attending weekly COR meetings at Notre Dame and also working with Holy Cross. This year, Alanna Cheifari holds that position. 
"Alanna has been coming a lot more regularly than other tri-campus commissioners and her efforts have helped," Shappell said. 
Conversely, a member of COR has represented Notre Dame on BOG in past years. This year, however, no one holds that position. 
"It is not constitutionally mandated by Notre Dame that someone has to sit on our board. This year, Lizzi LShappell] chose not to appoint someone," Mclldufl' said. 
Both presidents have invited all board members to attend, and there have been a few unavoidable conflicts. 
"The meeting is mandatory for BOG members, but we did our best to accommodate as many COR members too so there would be 
many COH members as their schedules allow to attend," Shappell said. 
The groups will also be dis­cussing up-and-coming issues such as the Community Summit at Notre Dame. 
"We just hope this meeting will give our boards the oppor­tunity to get to know how other student government structures work so we can bet­ter understand the other sys­tems," Shappell said. 
Shappell and Mcllduff said they hope this is the first of many meetings between the two groups. 
"I would recommend meet­ing once a semester -once at Notre Dame and once at Saint Mary's," Mclldull' said. "I think that would be really important in beginning to addross issues we both share."

Iranian nuclear construction delayed 
MOSCOW-The launch of a Russian-built nuclear power plant in Iran could be delayed because Iran has fallen behind in payments, Russian officials said Monday. Top Iranian offi­cials swiftly denied that payments had been di'>­rupted, in the latest dispute surrounding the deal at the heart of the two countries' nuclear cooper­ation. 
Last year, Russia agreed to ship nuclear fuel to Bushehr-Iran's first nuclear plant-by March 2007 and launch the facility in September, with electricity generation to start by November. Under a separate deal, Iran agreed to return to Russia all spent fuel from the plant in southern Iran for reprocessing -a move intended to assuage global concerns that the fuel could be used to make nuclear weapons. 
Iran broke the schedule of payments this year under the $1 billion contract, said a Russian offi­cial. He said the Iranians blamed the delay on the need to switch payments from dollars to euros. 
Russia wary of U.S. missiles in Europe 
MOSCOW -In a statement reflecting the grow­ing distrust between Moscow and the West, a top Russian general on Monday warned that Poland and the Czech Republic risk being targeted by Russian missiles if they agree to host U.S. missil1;1 defense bases. 
The stark threat, by missile forces chief GPn. Nikolai Solovtsov. was one of the most bellicose comments yet by Russian officials on the issue, which 10 days ago led President Vladimir Putin to warn of a "new Cold War" in a speech in Munkh that shocked Western governments. 
"If the governments of Poland and the Czech Republic take such a step, the Strategic Missile Forces will be capable of targeting these facilities if a relevant decision is made," Solovtsov told reporters in Moscow, asserting the U.S. plan could upset strategic balance of power in the region.

New Jersey offers same sex civil unions 
TEANECK, N.J.-Hundreds of gay couples won the same legal rights, if not the title, as married couples Monday as New Jersey became the third state to offer civil unions. More than a dozen other couples applied for licenses for ceremonies later in the week. 
The civil unions, which offer the legal benefits but not the title of marriage, were granted automatically to the hundreds of gay New Jersey couples who had previously been joined in civil unions or married in other states or nations.

SAN DIEGO -The Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego said in a letter to parishioners this weekend that it is considering declaring bankruptcy to avoid going to trial on more than 140 lawsuits alleging sexual abuse by priests. 
The pastoral statement, signed by Bishop Robert Brom, said if fair settlements can't be reached with abuse victims, "the diocese may be forced to file a Chapter 11 reorganization in bankruptcy court." 
The diocese is concerned "that settlements not cripple the ability of the Church to accom­plish its mission and ministries," the letter said.

State considers video game restrictions 
INDIANAPOLIS -Lawmakers watched clips of violent beatings, topless strippers and other adult material Monday as they considered a bill that would restrict the sale of certain video games to young people. 
Committee chairman Sen. David Ford, R­Hartford City, took responsibility for the decision to show the clips and said he could have handled the situation differently. But he said lawmakers needed to realize the graphic content of some video games. 
The bill cleared the Senate Technology Committee 5-2 and now moves to the full Senate for consideration.

Summit ends with no new agreements 
Rice calls two-hour talks with Israeli, Palestinian representatives 'productive' 
Associated Press 

JERUSALEM ­A Mideast  
peace summit designed to  
open a new chapter for  
Israelis and Palestinians fed  
up with violence concluded  
Monday with no new agree­ 
ments and a pledge to keep  
talking.  
The United States, which  
had pushed for the session,  
said it was an accomplish­ 
ment merely to hold such a  
get together for the first  
time in six years. After two  
hours of talks with Israeli  
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert  
and Palestinian President  
Mahmoud Abbas, Secretary  
of State Con'doleezza Rice  
stood alone in a bare-bones  
hotel function room to call  
the session "useful and pro­ 
ductive."

immediate success here

JetBlue 'paralyzed' by snowstorm 
NEW YORK -The six-day siege of angry and disgruntled travelers at JetBlue's Kennepy .air­port terminal appeared to ease on Monday as service desks functioned more smoothly and cus­tomer calm prevailed despite flight cancellations. 
The beleaguered company said it was cancel­ing almost a quarter of its flights on Monday but planned to restore full operations on Tuesday, a week after a Valentine's Day snowstorm created a travel meltdown that virtually paralyzed JetBlue. 
The service breakdown "was absolutely painful to watch," said David G. Neeleman, the company's founder and chief executive, on Monday. 
He said the storm problems led to other prob­lems, including an overwhelmed reservations system and many of the company's pilots and flight crews being stuck away from where they were needed. The company didn't have a system in place to track the stranded crews and reroute them, something JetBlue is working to rectify, Neeleman said. 
Wal-Mart to target 'areas in need' 
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -Wal-Mart Stores Inc. announced Monday its plans for nine stores in areas in need of economic revitalization and said it will use those stores to help other businesses in the area develop. 
Wal-Mart Vice Chairman John Menzer, who heads the company's U.S. operation, was traveling to Indianapolis and Pittsburgh to announce that the company is moving into neighborhoods in each of those cities where commerce has faltered. 
Menzer said Wal-Mart is working with local chambers of commerce, business groups and minority-owned businesses with the goal of guid­ing new suppliQrs and helping new or existing shops thrive. 
"We're looking at working families that need us the most," Menzer said. "That's where we want to go." 
As jobs are created around the new Wal-Mart stores, tax revenue will rise and the neighborhood economy will improve, Menzer said. Two of the stores are already open -in Chicago and Portsmouth, Va.

Undeclared lVar and the role of Congress 
Heady for a surprise? A membnr of Congress has introduced, on the Middle East, a bill embodying common sense and constitutional principle. No kidding. 
H.J. 
Hes. 14, introduced by Congressman Waltnr 

B. 
Jones (H-NC), with two Hepubliean and four Demoeratie co­sponsors, provides that no previously enaeted law "shall bn construed to authorize the use of military force by the United States against Iran." The punch line is in the next seetion: "Absent a national emergency ernated by attack by Iran, or a demonstrably imminent attack by Iran, upon the United States, its tnrritories or possessions or its armed l'orees, the President shall consult with Congrnss. and receive specilie authorization pur­suant to law from Congress, prior to ini­tiating any usn of military l'oree against Iran." 


Substantial evidnnee supports a description of' the Iraq war as a mistake in its inception and llawnd in its execu­tion. ILJ. Hns. 14 seeks to prevent a worse replay in Iran, by requiring that a new war must be initiated pursuant to constitutional proeess. 
On Aug. 17, 1787, aceording to James Madison's notes of the debates, the Constitutional Convention gave Congress the power to "deelare" rather than to "make" war, "leaving to the Exeeutive the power to repel sudden attacks." 'The Exeeutive," Hoger Sherman said, "[should] b~1 able to repel and not to eommenee war." Elbridge Gerry said he "never expected to hear in a republic a motion to empower the Executive alone to deelare war." George Mason "was against giving the power or war to the Exeeutive, because Ihn was! not safely to be trusted with it." 

Tlw Constitution created, in Justice Hobert Jaekson'swords, "a zone of twi­light," with coneurnmt war powers in the Prnsident and Congress but no bright line of' separation. Presidents have put l'orees into combat more than 200 times, all with nxplicit or implieit Congressional approval bel'orn or af'tnr the fact. As Alexandor llamilton notod even in 17S7, "the cornmony of a formal denunciation or war has or latn fallen into disuse." Congress has declared war only live times. But it is still true that Congress should deeidn whether to go to war, with or without a formal declara­tion, and tho Prnsidnnt should eonduet it. 
Tho Prnsidnnt is "Commander in Chief of the army and navy" because, as llamilton said, "the direction of war ... demands ... exercise of power by a sin­gle hand." Congress has no right to for­bid the "surge" of mm·e troops to Iraq or to eut oil' funds l'or that "surgo." Congress, lwwovnr, has thn power of' appropriation and could cut ofT funds l'or continuation of the 1m tire war, as was done in Cambodia and Vietnam. If tho Presidnnt vetond a eut-of'l' of funds, an ovorridn of' that veto would require a two-thirds voto in tho llouso and Senate. And impeachment of the President l'or his position on the war would require a two-thirds vote in the Snnatn to eonviet him. The Pnlsidnnt, ineidentally, is "Commander in ChinI' of' the army and navy," not or the country. 
An attaek on Iran would be a new war rather merely an incident or the Iraq war. Opinions differ on whether a war against Iran would bn justified and nee­nssary. But Congress should make that eall. In 2002 Congress gave the President authority to decide whether to go to war against Iraq "as he deter­mines to be necessary and appropriate." That sort of blank check should not be given again. The members of' Congress should make the actual decision whether or not to go to war, and aceount l'or it to their eonstituents. 
"Too many times," said Congressman Jones, "Congress has abdieated its ... duty...... IWihile the Commander in Chief has the power to eonduct wars­only Congress has the power to author­ize war..... !Tihere is ... concern ... that Administration oflieials are eontemplat­ing military aetion against Iran. .. .. We understand the ... thn~ats posed by Iran .... The question is how best to address these threats .... If the President is eon­templating eommitting our blood and treasure in another war -then he and his administration must eome to Congress and make their case. The Congress answers to the American peo­ple .... It is our Constitutional rosponsi­bility ... to hold hearings, ... to 1waluate the throats and to determine the best way to eounter these throats.

The military personnel of tho United States are relativ1~ly l'ew. But thny are the very best among us. They have a moral and legal right to have military power used, and themsolves put at risk, only through a decision made in aecord with the Constitution and therefore made with proper authority. ILl.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Loyal Daughters' humor detracts from true dialogue 
In fairness to the advocates of "The Vagina Monologues," it is a popular play that is part of our modern, nation­al culture. In some sense, it is not unreasonable for it to be considered in a modern university setting, say in a course on gender studies or sexual assault. Although, in my opinion and in the opinion of many others, its content conflicts not only with Catholic values but also with academic values, it never­theless has made a large enough impact to be considered in a limited and appro­priate way by students. 
Now, by "appropriate way" I do not mean an annual performance by ama­teur actresses. The greatest classics of the West, such as Hamlet or Oedipus Rex, are only performed once a decade, if at all. Some of the best plays reach the stage only once or twice a genera­tion, if we're lucky. Even if it is tolera­ble for such a trashy and explicit play (by comparison) to be performed and sponsored at Notre Dame on one occa­sion, there is certainly no reason to jus­tify it being performed six years in a row. 
As suggested by Mary Elizabeth Walter ("Dialogue is not dead," Feb. 19), there are many more effective ways for dialogue about the issue of the equal dignity of men and women. The Edith Stein Conference and the Right to Life Collegiate Conference are great examples of the issue considered in an intellectual and academic setting. She suggested another option, however, one with which I take issue. She seemed to imply that the performance of Loyal Daughters is a better way to explore the issues of sexual assault on campus. This play is pure sophistry and in no way adds to the important pursuit of Truth, to which Walter alluded. Although it is less explicit, it is much more dangerous. It does not address the issues in an intelligent way, but rather uses humor, stories and catchy tunes to attack the Catholic view of chastity and Notre Dame. These attacks are fallacious and have no grounding in reason. They in no way resemble an intellectual consideration of the real problems we are facing. 
The clearest example of this is the skit involving a logic professor who (ironically enough) uses false logic to try to point out a contradiction in University policy that does not exist. Since ihe skit imita,tes a well-known logician on campus and employs exag­gerated gestures, viewers are too busy laughing to actually think, "Wait a s~c­ond: this is terrible logic!" The perform­ance is marked by many such skits that "prove" their points not by reason but by jokes and jabs. 
Now, I don't know if the writers, per­formers and advocates of Loyal Daughters are aware of their error, whether it is done out of ignorance or malice. I do know that because of its humor and seemingly innocuous con­tent it is much more effective in keep­ing viewers from any intellectual con­sideration of the issues than "The Vagina Monologues" was, and therefore is much more dangerous. The reason that Plato argued in The Republic for censorship was not because the poetry and drama in question were explicit, but because they led people away from living by reason and toward living by delight. And since the goal of the uni­versity is to pursue universal truth, anything which hinders students' ability to think clearly and pursue this truth effectively is inconsistent with our aca­demic character. "The Vagina Monologues" was accordingly inconsis­tent and now lacks sponsorship. To a much greater degree, Loyal Daughters mocks these same academic values. University President Father John Jenkins initially saw the inconsistency of a play called "Loyal Daughters" with our Catholic character. If only we real­ized that its offense is first and fore­most against our academic character, then our University would continue its laudable work and deny sponsorship to Loyal Daughters as well.

Positive sibling relationship should be fostered 
Over the past week, we have heard a great many responses from Saint Mary's women in regard to Jonathan Klingler's article "Saint Mary's-we need to talk" (Feb. 13). We believe that the voices of Notre Dame students, however, have been surprisingly mute. On this point, we ~ould like to offer our own humble opinion. In Klingler's article, he refers to the historical relationship between Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross as " ... one of mutual benefit, respect and affection." In Klingler's opinion, this historical relationship has changed to a parasitical relationship in which Saint Mary's, although claiming to be separate and proud, has taken most of the benefits of our relationship. 
Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross were founded as a family of schools run by the priests, sisters and brothers of the esc. respectively. Indeed, the status of these schools as three related, but distinctly separate, entities follows the original vision of Congregation of Holy Cross founder Father Basil Moreau. When he founded the esc. he believed it best to always have priests, sisters and brothers neigh­boring each other and working coopera­tively, but living in separate communi­ties. In this way, we are all a family. 
Yes, siblings bicker. Whether it be for the last bit of pie or a fight for who gets the car, this is inherent in the nature of siblings. If you have older siblings, you know that while you look up to them, the most annoying thing they can do is demand that you be like them. This is true also of our schools. We bicker over football tickets and relationship status. Notre Dame is the big older brother and as such should help its younger siblings grow along their own path. We are three independent and proud schools, but we each have something to learn from each other. 
We feel that class sharing, ticket shar­ing and event sharing can only help our three schools grow stronger. It is possi­ble that through our communion with each other we can grow into three of the finest schools in the world. We do not feel that Saint Mary's students are "taking our seats;" rather, they are beside us cheering on our student ath-· letes as we should do for theirs. We do not feel that Saint Mary's students are stealing the benefits of a Notre Dame education; rather, they are using the opportunities that they have available to become better people, as we should do with ours. 
Finally, we do not feel that Saint Mary's is hypocritical for calling itself "Separate and Proud;" rather, they are growing up as all families have, togeth­er and individually with their siblings. As a family of colleges, we should be encouraging growth and communication amongst ourselves so that we can all broaden our perspectives and grow to be more worldly people. We challenge those who haven't had the chance yet to go out and explore Saint Mary's and Holy Cross, be it through classes, per­formance opportunities or just by mak­ing a new friend. For our part, we wouldn't have met many of our wonder­ful friends if it hadn't been for the close relationship that Notre Dame shares with Holy Cross and Saint Mary's. 
Finally, and on a slightly separate note, we find the written and verbal attacks on the women of our family dis­gusting. The 'inferiority' of a women's college, the 'easiness' of either college's women and the reference to the ugli­ness of the women angers us. Women of our colleges are not gremlins, they are not inferiors and they are not to be stereotyped. While all of us can take a joke, the constant harassment of the female community has gone too far. It is in this vein that we ask all of you to please respect those of differing race, religion and especially gender in the future.

MOVIE REVIEW 
Film adaptation of tale impresses viewers 
By ERIN McGINN 
Assistant Scene Ediror 
It is always a diffieult task when a beloved children's book is adapted into a film. Children's books lock away so many emo­tions and memories for young readers that it becomes both painful and frustrating when a film doesn't live up to its original souree material. "Bridge to Terabithia" by Katherine Patterson is one of those books that has been treasured dearly by young readers since it was first published in 1977. A feature film of the work hadn't been tack­led until now because of the dilemmas in creating the world of Terabithia as well as the intensity of the story. Fortunately the film. scripted by David Patterson (the son of the original author), lives up to the novel and is destined to be a children's classic. 
"Bridge to Terabithia" tells the story of Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson), a fifth grade misfit who deals with problems both at school and home through his artwork. His routine life changes when Leslie Burke 
Bridge to Terabithia 


Director: Gabor Csupo Writers: Jeff Stockwell, David Paterson (screenplay) and Katherine Paterson (book) Starring: Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb 
(AnnaSophia Robb) arrives at school. Leslie is the daughter of two writers and has a wild imagination and an outgoing pArsonal­ity. The two become friends and they create their own fantasy world called Terabithia, where they use their imaginations to escape from reality and find ways to cope with their problems in the real world. 
"Bridge to Terabithia" uses the special effects team that was created by Peter Jackson when he filmed his "Lord of the Rings" trilogy in order to create the world of Terabithia. In the trailers. they promote the special effects as a strong selling point, hop­ing to attract the same crowds that turned out to see "Lord of the Rings" and "The lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe." Even though the lilm plays up the fantasy much more than the novel, the actual scenes make up a small percentage of the whole movie. 
In the novel, only a small amount of detail is given about Terabithia since it exists only in the minds of the children. This is easily the film's weakest point since the computer graphics tend to blur the line between fantasy and reality, which is always clearly demareated in the book. At some points it is clear that the troll they see really is just a tree, but at other points (such as when the "troll" catches Jesse) that dis­tinction doesn't exist. The filmmakers would have done better to model their fantasy sequences after Peter Jaekson's "Heavenly Creatures" in which two girls also create their own fantasy worlds. That film does a much better job of showing that their fanta­sy exists solely in their minds. 

The core of the story, in contrast to the trailers, lies in the human element -in the friendship between Jesse and Leslie. Hutcherson and Robb both do excellent jobs in portraying the children and in dealing with the occasionally dillicult subject mat­ter. They both succeed in endearing them­selves to the audience, who in turn invests their emotions into the charaeters. 
The supporting cast is less noteworthy, with the exceptions of Jesse's father (Robert Patrick) and their music teacher Ms. Edmonds (Zooey Deschancl) who both do great jobs of showing contrasting adult per­spectives to the children. 
Pans of the book will definitely not be dis­appointed by the film version of "Bridge to Terabithia." The film is just as endearing and emotionally powerful as the original novel. Those familiar with the book already know about the tragic twist that the plot takes, and the film is no less heart-wrench­ing. For those who don't know how its ends, be forewarned that it is impossible to leave without emptying a box of tissues.

CD REVIEW 
'Emmerick' has a sound for everyone with 'North' 
By MARTY SCHROEDER Assistant Scene Editor 
Southern rock exists in the popular mind -incarnated by bands such as Lynyrd Skynyrd and .38 Special. The genre is no longer popular for emerg­ing artists to emulate -at least not artists that want to find mainstream success. Perhaps this is because the bands that came before them were just so talented at what they did, they set a benchmark no one can hope to match. 
Tim Emmerick and Cold Front County make a valiant and somewhat successful attempt, but cant quite match what came before them. It's album, "North," is an excellent array of rock, country and the melding of those two genres. It does make some in-roads in combining genres-and it does it better than most mainstream bands. However, it can't match· the greats of either musical genre and falls into the trappings of mainstream pop that should be edgier than Matchbox 20. 
The album opens with the raucous 


roots. This is
Tim Emmerick and 

also the best written song on
Cold Front County 

the album as Emmerick sings

about the fail­ings of his per­
Red One Records 

sonal religion and how faith can be do good in the world but can also be a very dangerous
Recommended tracks: 'Chapter and Verse' and 'Storm' 
tool that some will use to put 
"Black River Bridge," which tears through its surprisingly long 4:49 run time. This song sounds shorter than it is and Emmerick and County keeps the rock gods appeased in this open­ing track. However, the gods will smite the next song, "Fall to the Leaves," that sounds only remotely rock and simpl-y tries too hard with forced guitar solos that seem out of place in the factory-scaled blandness that is this song. 
On a slower note, "Intentions Fade" brings about apparitions of The Eagles and manages to keep a toe­tapping tempo going as Emmerick sings about death and mourning. The bluegrass edge to this song is a wel­come addition to the album as most of the other tracks sound they eould have come from anywhere. This one is unique and the talent the band put into this one shows. 
As the album progresses, the rock and roll punch that made the opening track so fun transforms into straight up steel guitar old-school country on "Chapter and Verse." For the fan of country a Ia George Strait and early Alan Jackson, this song will certainly 
appeal to their 

down others. 

"North" could have closed on a stronger note than "Mercy," which clocks in at 6::34 -far too long for a closing track. This song could have benefited off some of the energy from the opening, which would have been appropriate close to this sometimes loud, sometimes ponderous album. 
With something for everyone, Tim Emmerick and Cold Front County promises something for everyone who are fans of the country rock and what falls in between. The tracks on this album that are good are really good and the tracks that are mediocre are really medioere. There are no horri­ble songs on this album but some are certainly better than others. Its too bad Emmerick couldn't keep up the energy through the whole album that he opened with. They should take a note out of Skynyrd's and George Strait's book -the tradition from both old country and southern rock could make this album much better than it is.

MOVIE REVIEW 
'Illusionist' fails to realiz~ magic potential 
By MARTY SCHROEDER Assistant Scene Editor 
Many films try to recreate the past and immerse the audience into some far distant time with kings, wars and chivalry. Few modern films, though, try to immerse us in a viewing experience as those viewers of the past would have had. "The Illusionist," however, does exactly this. A tale about a magician who travels to Vienna at the turn of the 19th century, this flick is not so much about the past but about the past viewings offilms. 
Starring Edward Norton and Jessica Biel, "The Illusionist" weaves a plot around the peasant who becomes the famous Eisenheim the Illusionist (Norton). He falls in love with a Countess (Biel) who has caught the eye of the crown price of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Rufus Sewell deftly plays Crown Prince Leopold whose unique voice brings an unmistakable men­ace to the character. The hubris that Sewell brings suits the character well and counters 
The Illusionist 


Director: Neil Burger Writers: Neil Burger (screenplay) and Steven Millhauser (short story) Starring: Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti and Jessica Biel Norton's Eisenheim in a way that is not complicated or subtle but works well for what the film is -an entertaining yarn about magic, love and little else. 
The standout in "The Illusionist" is Paul Giamatti who never fails to impress. He plays the ambitious yet righteous Inspector Uhl. The plot revolves around his inspection ofEisenheim and the desire to learn how his secrets are performed. Giamatti's Uhl is the only character with complication and thus is the most interesting. Eisenheim is the peasant angry at the aristocracy, Leopold is the aristocrat who wants people in their place and Biel is the Countess who wishes she could love who she wants but can't-these are all basic stock characters. Only Uhl examines social mores and roles and questions what he is doing and yet still attempts to legitimize his doing it -this isn't an Oscar caliber performance but it keeps the story interesting. 
The DVD has a commentary by the writer and director Neil Burger that is interesting and insightful. The making of the film is also of note due to the highly detailed sets and costumes. This is where the film shines through the most because it seems the art department is one of the few that actually took their jobs seriously. Except for a certain sword that looks like something out of a·cracker-jack box, the sumptuous costumes and varied sets are explored in this making of featurette that is sure to impress. Jessica Biel on "The Illusionist" is nothing too impressive. Her acting was sub-par, as was her interview on the film. It would have been far more inter-esting if they had interviewed veteran film actors Norton or Giamatti. 

Overall, this film is entertaining and high­ly watchable. The ending has some pre­dictable twists alongside some not so pre­dictable twists that keep the plot interesting. This is not a film that deserves a blind-buy but instead should be watched before being purchased. Fans of magic, mystery and period pieces will erijoy it thoroughly. If, however, you aren't into genres of that ilk, this may not be the film .for you. It may have 
.. ,. 
received more credit if it hadn't been released right in line with the similar (and better) "The Prestige" but it still can hold its own. This is not Norton's nor is it Giamatti's best, but each performance is entertaining in its own way. Netflix or Blockbuster deserves your business for this one but per­haps not Best Buy -unless you're a magic lover.

'Rider' takes the fast lane to cinematic trash heap 
By RAMA GOTTUMUKKALA 
Scene Writer 
The first sign that something's gone horribly, horribly wrong with "Ghost Rider" comes 15 minutes into the movie. 
Life is good for young Johnny Blaze, a hotshot motorcycle-riding stuntman ­until he finds a (rather conveniently placed) doctor's diagnosis lying around the house, saying his father has cancer. Fortunately, a mysterious stranger named Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) offers a miraculous cure for his dear old dad. All Johnny has to do, naturally, is sign away his soul. 
He's thinking about it, and while read­ing the agreement, he pricks his finger on a sharp edge of the devilish docu­ment. A small drop of blood splatters on the dotted line. 
"That's good enough," says Mephisto, a crafty old dodger. And that's that ­Johnny's fate is sealed. Too bad Mephisto never told Johnny that his cancer-free dad would ride headlong into the outer rim of a ring of fire the next day. 
Wait, didn't the snazzy tagline on all the "Ghost Rider" movie posters proclaim that, "long ago he made a deal to save someone he loved"? Clearly, the filmmak­ers didn't get the memo when forming this steaming hot pile of hellish tripe. 
Ghost Rider 


Director: Mark Steven Johnson Writers: Mark Steven Johnson Starring: Nicolas Cage, Peter Fonda, Matt Long and Raquel Alessi 
That Johnny never willfully signs the damned paper is the first of many signs that our hero, and this picture, is beyond saving. 
A paper-thin plot gets slimmer still when director/writer Mark Steven Johnson cranks time forward to the pres­ent. When he's not plotting death-defying stunts, grownup Johnny (Nicolas Cage) enjoys eating jelly beans out of martini glasses, jamming to Karen Carpenter and reading dusty old tomes about the occult. But -surprise, surprise -Mephisto comes calling when his vile son, Blackheart (Wes Bentley), wants to move in on daddy's turf. Mephisto unleashes the dormant Ghost Rider and sets Cage -err, the Rider -loose to wreck unholy vengeance on us, err, those who deserve it. 
As comic book properties go, Ghost Rider is the redheaded stepchild of the Marvel Comics family. He'll never have the name recognition of a Spider-Man or Wolverine, but his full head of flames and goth-chic getup of black leather jacket, chains and a wicked hog means he's always trying. Sadly, this Rider careens into a ditch, and the culprits are Cage and Johnson. 
"Daredevil," Johnson's last feature film, was a passable and sometimes genuinely entertaining take on another lesser­known hero in the Marvel Comics stable. But here, his skills seem to have devolved. 
The dialogue in "Ghost Rider" is atro­cious. Many of the zaniest one-liners are left for Bentley's Blackheart to contend with. It's hard enough to fear a villain who dares to proclaim, "I will retire your Ghost Rider. And then I will retire you ... Father." But it's a downright embarrass­ment to villainy when his encore is, "We are Legion ... because we are many!" Pathetic. 

For diehard comic book fans, Joel Schumacher's 1997 film "Batman and Robin" is a registered crime against humanity for how badly it crippled the Dark Knight. Ghost Rider purists have good reason to weep, for Johnson comes dangerously close to dunking their beloved Flamehead under water for good. 
As for Mr. Cage, he seems content to spend his screen time making a mockery of the character and himself. When pro­ducers were looking to land Johnny Depp for the role, Cage stepped in and revealed his deep love -and body art ­for the character. Ironically (or fittingly), Cage had to have his Ghost Rider tattoo covered with make-up to play Johnny Blaze. 
When he's not hiding behind a heinous­ly bad computer-generated skull, Cage ceaselessly points at his victims and ges­ticulates about justice. His Ghost Rider rarely bothers to punch someone with those oven-hot mitts of his, preferring instead to utilize his Penance Stare. After locking eyes with his victim in a short­lived staring contest, Ghost Rider reflects back all of the pain that the wrongdoer has inflicted on other people and increas­es the agony tenfold. 
It is our deep misfortune that the real Ghost Rider is nowhere in sight to save us, for surely he would unleash the Penance Stare on Johnson and Cage, making them suffer the full horror of what they've done.

Fields, not Gray, leads Panthers over Seton Hall 
Pitt notches 11th Big East victory without its injured star center 
Associated Press 

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -Levance Fields scored seven of his 15 points in the final 2 1/2 minutes to help short-handed No. 10 Pittsburgh hold off Seton Hall 71-68 Monday night. 
Levon Kendall had 14 points and eight rebounds and Sam Young added 11 points for the Panthers (24-4, 11-2 Big East), who were without injured 7­foot center Aaron Gray. The victory was the 1 DOth for Pittsburgh coach Jamie Dixon (100-26), who reached the milestone faster than any coach in school history. 
Eugene Harvey scored 19 of his 24 points in the second half, Jamar Nutter had 19 and Brian Laing added 12 points and eight rebounds for Seton Hall (12-14, 3-10). 
The Pirates, who fell behind by 14 with 5 1/2 minutes to go, 
pulled  to  64-61  on  Paul  
Gause's  tip-in  with  1:20  
remaining.  ·  

Fields, who made five free throws in the final minute, hit two to push Pitt's lead to 6 7-61 with 49 seconds left. After Harvey's layup pulled Seton Hall to within three with 16 seconds remaining, Fields made two more from the line less than a second later. 
Nutter then hit his fourth 3­pointer of the game to pull the Pirates to 70-68 with about 5 seconds remaining, and Fields made 1 of 2 free throws to make it a three-point game. Nutter's desperation 3 from inside half court at the buzzer bounced high off the rim. 
Pittsburgh moved one-half game ahead of Georgetown for first place in the conference, and visits the Hoyas on Saturday. 
Gray, who sprained his left ankle in the final minute of a win over Washington on Saturday, was on the bench in warmups with a protective boot on his foot. 
After missing their one free­throw attempt in the opening period, the Pirates made their charge by making 16-for-19 from the line in the second half. 
The teams traded baskets for the first 5 112 minutes of the second half, before Seton Hall pulled to 39-37 on two free throws each by Harvey and Nutter. Keith Benjamin's dunk pushed Pitt's lead back to four.

Schachtner finished with 13 points for the Phoenix, which also got 11 each from Terry Evans and Hyan Tillema. 
Green Bay, which last beat a ranked team in 1998, took a five-point lead in the second half before the Bulldogs changed tactics and tried to speed up the game by pushing the tempo off missed shots. 
A quick run by Butler erased the deficit, and Campbell hit three 3-pointers as part of a 9­1 run to give the Bulldogs' a 47-40 lead. 
Graves, who went 6-of-17 from the field and 3-of-11 from beyond the arc, slashed through the lane and hit a layup to make it 54-46 with just under 6 minutes to play, and Green Bay's drought began after Troy Cotton's 3­pointer made it 55-51.

SAN DIEGO -Norv Turner got his third shot at an NFL head coaching job when he was hired Monday by the San Diego Chargers, a week after the surprise firing of Marty Schottenheimer. 
The hiring came less than 24 hours after the Chargers wrapped up their inter­views. The Chargers also hired Ted Cottrell as defen­sive coordinator. 
Turner, the San Francisco 49ers' offensive coordina­tor, was the only one of the six candidates who's been an NFL head coach, and the only one from the offen­sive side of the ball. 
He inherits a team that was an NFL-best 14-2 last season but melted down in its playoff opener, a stun­ning 24-21 loss to the New England Patriots. 
Last Monday, the Chargers again surprised the NFL when president Dean Spanos fired Schottenheimer, citing a "dysfunctional situation" between the coach and general manager A.J. Smith. 
Turner had trouble win­ning in the regular season, going 58-82-1 in head coaching stints with Washington and Oakland. Schottenheimer had trou­ble winning in the postsea­son, going 5-13 overall and 
IN BRIEF 

Swindal returns to work,
apologizes for distractions 
TAMPA, Fla. -Steve Swindal returned to work at Legends Field on Monday and apologized for becom­ing a distraction. He wouldn't specu­late whether his arrest last week for driving under the influence would alter his role as George Steinbrenner's designated successor to run the New York Yankees. 
Swindal was arrested early Thursday by the St. Petersburg Police, who claimed he was driving 61 mph in a 35 mph zone. Swindal was released on $250 bond and has a March 15 court date. 
"I just wanted to tell you on a per­sonal level how embarrassed I am for my family, for the Yankees, the fans. I know I let a lot of people down, and I promise to do better and put this behind me," he said, stand­ing in front of a photograph of Billy Martin in the Legends Field press box. 
0-2 with the Chargers. 
Turner was San Diego's offensive coordinator in 2001, when LaDainian Tomlinson was a rookie and Smith was the assis· tant to the late John Butler. 
The Chargers still use the same offense Turner installed. 
"This isn't a team where you're rebuilding," Turner said. "We should start fast. We should be good early and we should be good late. Not having to go through the normal things you have to go through when you make a coaching change is going to help the players more than anyone." 
Turner was fired by the Raiders in 2005 after going 

Colts place franchise tag on 
Freeney despite poor season 
INDIANAPOLIS-The Indianapolis Colts made defensive end Dwight Freeney their franchise player on Monday, keeping him with the Super Bowl champions for at least one more season while they work on a long-term contract. 
Freeney, a first-round draft pick in 2002, missed the Pro Bowl this year for the first time since his rookie season. He was held to a career-low 5 1/2 sacks while fighting shoulder and leg injuries. 
Still, the Colts were not going to let him get away. 
"He wasn't going to go anywhere," team president Bill Polian said. "There's no timeline, but we're still talking (to his agent) with the idea of putting together a longer deal. He's a key part of our team." 
Freeney would have become an unrestricted free agent March 2 without a new contract. 
9-23 in two seasons. 
San Francisco's Mike Nolan quickly hired Turner to take over the NFL's 32nd-ranked offense. Turner got remarkable progress from quarterback Alex Smith and an improved offensive line. He helped Frank Gore become the NFC's leading rusher in a breakout season. 
Turner will be able to help with the continued development of quarter­back Philip Rivers, who was voted to the Pro Bowl but saw his play tail off down the stretch. Tomlinson was the league's MVP after setting NFL records with 31 touch­downs and 186 points. 

Federer ties record for 
longest stretch atop rankings 
LONDON -Roger Federer tied Jimmy Connors' record of 160 con­secutive weeks as the top-ranked · player in men's tennis Monday. 
The 10-time Grand Slam champi­on has held the No. 1 ATP Tour ranking since Feb. 2, 2004. The Swiss star is assured of breaking the record next week. 
"Breaking records and doing something that hasn't been done for a long time, it's really nice," Federer said recently. 
Connors was No. 1 "from July 1974 to August 1977. He is now coaching one of Federer's biggest rivals, Andy Roddick. 
Federer, who has won six of the last seven Grand Slam titles, hasn't played since beating Fernando Gonzalez in the Australian Open final on Jan. 28. He returns to action next week at the Dubai Open.

NFL 
Bears won't retain defensive coordinator Rivera 
Assistant coach crafted one ofthe league's top defenses in Chicago 
Associated Press 
LAKE FOREST, Ill. Chicago defensive coordinator Ron Rivera has gone from head coaching candidate to out of a job -a little more than two weeks after Bears were in the Super Bowl. 
Rivera, who has talked with eight different NFL teams about their head coaching positions over the last two seasons, had a three-year contract with the Bears that was set to expire next week. The NFC champions announced Monday he will not be back. 
Head coach Lovie Smith had been pushing Rivera for head coaching jobs, now he's pusheq him off his staff. 
"It's just something that coach decided he was going to shuffle his staff and we'll go from there," Rivera said during a conference call. 
Rivera said he wanted to return and was told a few days ago he wouldn't. 
Was there a personality conflict with Smith? 
"No, no, no, no, please. I don't think there is. I really don't," he said. 
"I believe this is just a foot­ball decision and it was made. Emotionally, I'm disap­pointed in not getting the opportunity to come back in '07 because as I said at the end of the year after the loss that this is a football team that's headed in the right direction." 
Smith, a defensive-oriented coach, insisted there no philosophical differences with Rivera. 
"As much as anything, it's just a fit that we have and right now the direction I would like to go and the direction that Hon would like to go, we're going in two dif­ferent directions," Smith said during a conference call. 
"It's been my goal all along to help Hon, to do everything I could to get Hon an opportu­nity to get a head football coaching job and it's no more than that. We've tried to do that. l{on had a contract. I don't see it as a firing or any­thing like that. llis contract expired and he wants to go in one direction, and I'd like to go in one. No more than that." 
Hivera was a linebacker on Chicago's Super Bowl champi­on team in 1986 and then led a defense that helped the Bears make the playoffs in back-to-hack seasons. Chicago had trouble contain­ing Indianapolis in the Super Bowl. losing 29-17 to the Peyton Manning-led Indianapolis Colts. 
Rivera has been an assis­tant coach for 10 years in the NFL beginning as a quality control coach with the Bears in 1997. lie spent five years with the Philadelphia Eagles as their linebackers coach and then the last three in charge of Chicago's defense. 
The Bears led the NFL with 44 takeaways in the regular season, but the defense was slowed in the latter stages of the season after injuries to 


defensive tackle Tommie Harris and safety Mike Brown. 
Smith did not elaborate when asked if there were things about Hivera's per­formance he did not like. 
"Those are the things Hon 
Do you know about OIS's Summer Programs! 

and I talked about," Smith said. "We feel good about the things wn did together during that time, but no more needs to be said about that. That's between he and 1." 
Hivera was a candidate last season for head coaching jobs in Green Bay and St. Louis. This year he talked with Pittsburgh, Miami, Atlanta and Arizona before the Bears started postseason play. After Chicago lost the Super Bowl, he interviewPd for coaching vacancies at Dallas and just a few days ago at San Diego. 
Smith said he would move quickly to replace Hivera. Linebackers coach Bob Babich is considered a top candidate. 
Even though many NFL coaching spots are already filled, Rivera said he is confi­dent he will get a job. 
"The timing sometimes could have been better or it could have been worse. It is what it is right now," he said.

He can terminate the agreement after the season, forfeit the $72 million owed in the final three years and become a free agent. He also could pressure New York for an extension. 
He said he wants to remain a Yankee, but wouldn't promise that he will. Like Mariano Rivera, he is thinking ahead to the new ballpark scheduled to open in 2009.

PGA TOUR 

Woods shoots for eighth straight Tour victory 
Tiger can reboundfrom overseas loss with win in J!ccenture tourney 
Associated Press 

MARANA, Ariz. -Tiger Woods ran into one player and got two reminders. 
He was zipping along The Gallery during a practice round Monday, his first look at a new course for the Accenture Match Play Championship where he will try to win his eighth straight PGA Tour event. Some people will argue it's not really a winning streak, for Woods has failed to win four times overseas. 
So it was only fitting that he caught up to Shaun Micheel on the second green. 
"Do you think I should wish him luck this week?" said Tony Lingard, the caddie for Michenl. 

Tho streak in its purest form ended Sept. 14 on a gray after­noon in the English countryside when Mieheel, the last seed in the 16-man field of the IISBC World Match Play Championship, pulled off a stunner and beat Woods, 4 and 3. 
That never came up during the next 16 holns of a course that stretehes some 3 miles out into thn desert and eventually

just north of Tucson, with two par 5s over 600 yards and two par 4s that can be reached off the tee. 
It's a new course for all 64 players in the field after the World Golf Championship event left soggy La Cos_ta Hesort north of San Diego. Phil Mickelson was due on Tuesday, and he joked last week that he couldn't remember the last time he played a regular prac­tice round anywhere exeept the majors. 
It is rare for Woods to show up on Monday, but he knew nothing about the course, and didn't learn much except to notice it was green, brown and white with some marvelous vis­tas of the valley below. 
At stake this week is the streak with the asterisk. 
Counting only PGA Tour events, the last time he didn't go home with a trophy was July 9, when he was second at the Wnstern Open. Woods believes his streak ended when he lost to Mieheel. although he also reeognizes that his PGA Tour streak is seven and counting, and each week brings him clos­er to the 11 in a row that Byron Nelson won in 1945. 
More than anything, be real­izes there are no guarantees at the Aecenture Match Play Championship. 
Woods is a two-timH champi­on of this fickle event. but he also has lost in every round except the semifinals. A year ago, hn was bounced by Chad Campbell in the third round. 
And while this WGC ev~mt is played over 18 holes until the 36-holn championship match, even the purest form of match play -36 holes every match ­didn't spare Woods a defeat at Wentworth last September. 
"J eherish my win against him," said Micheel, who lost in the championship match that week to Paul Casey. "It's excit­ing to be playing in the same generation with a guy who arguably is the best ever." 
And what does Micheel think when he hears about. the win­ning streak? 
"''m not too much of a histo­rian," he said, "But I don't think guys were going overseas back in Byron's day. Golf was nothing like it is today. Tiger's streak is a PGA Tour streak, and it's amazing. But this can be the one tournament that gets him." 
Micheel won't face Woods in the first round Thursday -he will play third-seeded Adam Scott, while Woods takes on No. 64 J .J. Henry, who got into the field when Chari Schwartzel withdrew. The former PGA champion would have to win all his matches, and Woods would have to win all his, for them to meet again. 
Micheel already has the end­ing scripted.­
"J think it's interesting that Byron's streak ended in Memphis," he said. "Wouldn't that be something if a guy from Memphis could stop Tiger's tour streak?" 
That's getting too far ahead. Most players know better than to look past Wednesday. 
The only player who should be concerned about Woods ­and vice versa -is Henry. Maybe it was just a coinci­dence, but Henry was on the flight to Tucson with Micheel on Sunday night. 

winds baek through cactus and shrub toward the clubhouse. 
They talknd about the birth of Micheel's daughter, Marin Belle born on Feb. 9, and Micheel asked him if Woods knew what gender his child would be when it comes this summer. 
"We're not going to lind out," Woods told him. "It's got to be one or the other." 
The rest of the round was spent navigating the 7,446­yard course at Dove Mountain

New personnel highlight Irish coaching staff 
Nine hirings include old, familiar faces 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Ediror 
A month after naming Corwin Brown its new defensive coordi­nator, Notre Dame on Monday delineated Brown's position tasks and specified other staff changes. 
In a news release sent to media by e-mail, Irish coach Charlie Weis announced that Brown will lead outside line­backers in the team's new "3-4 personnel" defensive scheme. Current special teams coach Brian }lolian will split his duties between his current position and the inside linebackers. 
With Polian splitting time between his two responsibilities, current tight ends coach Bernie Parmalee will serve as concur­rent special teams coach. 
The Irish added a second intern this year -Kevin Loney -to focus on offense. The status of 2006 intern Jesse Minter, the son of Rick Minter, who was Brown's predecessor before

was cold from the free-throw line, sinking just 41.2 percent of its foul shots. On Dec. 30, the Irish shot well but made only 
66.7 percent of their free throws and forced just 15 turnovers. 
Against Connecticut Jan. 27, the defense created plenty of turnovers but the team shot just 
24.2 percent for the game. 
Sometimes all the factors are present, but still don't add up to a victory. Against Indiana Dec. 3, Notre Dame shot 41.7 percent from the field, 83.3 percent from the free-throw line and forced 21 turnovers, but still lost 54-51. 
But in the past five games, the Weis "went in a different direc­tion" wit)l the defense, was unknown Monday. 
With Ron Powlus promoted to quarterbacks coach, Notre Dame also changed the titles for its director of personnel develop­ment and its coordinator of per­sonnel development. Tim McDonnell, who served in 2006 as coordinator of quality control, will become director of football personnel. Dave Peloquin, who was coordinator of football per­sonnel development, will now be director of football development. 
Nick Mainieri, the son of for­mer Irish baseball coach Paul Mainieri, will take McDonnell's position as coordinator of quality control. 
Notre Dame also hired Patrick Graham as its graduate assistant on defense. He replaces Jeff Burrow, whose two-year stint in the position ended after the 2006-07 season. Director of Football Media Relations Brian Hardin said Shane Waldron, the current offensive graduate assis­tant, might apply for a third year.

Providence Feb. 17. 
"I think overall, we're really putting the ball in the basket a little bit more," McGraw said. "I don't think our shot selection is any difl'erent, I just think we're really confident right now." 
Foul shots 
The free throw line has also been an important source of points for Notre Dame. 
The team set the tone by sink­ing 33-of-39 free throws against West Virginia, a scorching 84.6 percent. What's amazing about this particular aspect is the lack of attention paid to it by McGraw. 
"Its funny, we haven't worked on it at all," she said. "We're pretty good free-throw shooters in general." 
Last summer, center Melissa D'Amico and forward Crystal Erwin were told to improve their free-throw shooting, as both were under 60 percent. The work paid off-D'Amico now shoots 81.1 percent from the line. 
"They both obviously worked on it very well, Mel in particu­lar," McGraw said. "She's shot the ball very well from the free throw line. And I think our freshmen were good free throw shooters in high school and they continue to do that." 
McGraw went on to call this year's team the best free-throw shooting team she's ever coached. 

Turnovers 
Notre Dame has caused prob­lems on defense all season, but the success wasn't always cou­pled with the offensive produc­tion it now enjoys. Villanova's offense was immeasurably ham­pered due to the turnovers the Irish caused, and the 24­turnover performance played a large role in upsetting then-No. 17 Louisville Feb. 7. 
Still, McGraw is not entirely pleased. 
"I was a little disappointed against Providence," she said. "They have very good guards, and they handled our pressure very well. That's the first game in a while that a team hasn't turned the ball over 20 times, so we are really going to focus on that a little bit more, and try to develop maybe a little something different for the stretch run and the Big East tournament." 
With three games left in the regular season, Notre Dame has a tentative hold on the final first-round bye in the Big East tournament. Nothing is guaran­teed, but if the Irish continue to combine the successful elements of their game, it could mean good things for the postseason.

CELEBRITIES BORN ON THIS DAY: Justine Bateman, 41; Seal, 44: Jeff Daniels, 52; Smokey Robinson, 67 ­
Happy Birthday: Your inclination to overdo. overuse and overindulge will gel you into trouble this year. Have no impulsive moves or actions. Restraint and moderation will be what counts and what helps you balance your world the first three quarters of the year. After that. you can breath easy. Your numbers are 7, 13, 19, 25, 27,38 
ARIES (March 21-Apri119): Someone is likely to divulge secret information that will come in handy regarding a legal or health matter. Don't let yourself get all worked up over nothing or you will miss out on something that you want to do. *** TAURUS (Aprii20-May 20): Look for the less obvious and you will get a dearer picture of what's actually going on. Someone will surprise you with his or her interest in what you are doing. Don't take anything for granted--if someone offers you something be sure to get it in writing. **** GEMINI (May 21-June 20): As much as you want to do what's right, it will be ditlicult. Expect someone to cause you worry or cost you dearly. Rely on someone older or who has more experience to help you out. ** CANCER (June 21-July 22): You have to take advantage of whatever comes your way today. A money or investment opportunity is looking good. The chance to make a move that will lead to a better paying position is apparent. Leave some time for a little loving and romancing. ***** LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Someone may be trying to take advantage of you financially. Don't get involved in a dubious get-rich-quick scheme. You are likely to end up with the short end of the stick. Gambling, traveling and being gullible will all lead to losses. *** VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Don't rely on anyone but yourself. Someone you are close to or live with will take advantage of you. Aggressive behavior or actions will not solve anything. Be upfront about the way you feel. *** LIBRA (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): Your emotions will be ditlicult to control. Focus on work and money and leave your personal matters alone for the time being. You need more information and certainly more time to sort through what is going on. *** SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Everyone will be counting on you today. Be honest about what you can and cannot do. A love connection will grow stronger if you put time aside to nurture it today. Get serious about your plans. *** SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): As much as you would like to ignore emotional matters, you must deal with them. Running never solves anything so get to it. It will ease your stress and any guilt you are experiencing if you do. ** CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): It's time for a big change. Travel, the way you earn your living and what you want to do with the rest of your life are all up for discussion. Be true to yourself and your needs and don't give in to what someone else wants. **** AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Don't try to fool yourself into thinking that everything is perfect if you haven't actually reached your goals. This isn't the day to give up or give in. Reevaluate to find a way to get what you want. Take action now.*** PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Listen, observe and take your time making a decision. You may feel the urge to be impulsive but that will only lead you in the wrong direction. Someone you think you know well is not being honest with you. *** 
Birthday Baby: You are sensitive, caring and intuitive. You can imitate, create and invent with originality and ease: You are a storyteller, colorful and persuasive. You are a master at the art of manipulation.

Exorcising Demons 
Irish look for revenge at home against DePaul 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Spans Ediror 
Colin Falls called it the "hardest loss of [his] career." 
Last week, Notre Dame fell to DePaul 67-66 on a dunk in the closing seconds by for­ward Wilson Chandler. Falls had been holding the ball near mid-court when Blue Demons guard Draelon Burns stole it and hit a streaking Chandler for the winning basket. 
Tonight, the Irish senior guard and his teammates have a chance at revenge as they take on the Blue Demons at 7 at the Joyce Center. 
"We owe them," Falls said. "They're a good basketball team but this is a huge week for us and we're really excit­ed." 

The No. 23 Irish (20-6, 8-5 Big East) are chasing a bye in the Big East tournament. They are currently in a four­way tie for fourth place, but control their own destiny. Notre Dame holds tie-break­ers over fellow 8-5 teams Syracuse and West Virginia and plays Marquette Saturday with a chance to earn that head-to-head tie-DAN Observer

FOOTBALL RECRUITING

Observer Staff Report 

Notre Dame landed its first recruit for the class of 2012, the Chicago Tribune reported Monday. 
Mike Golic, Jr., the son of the former Irish d e f e n s i v e See Also tackle and 
"New personnel

show host, verbally page 17 committed to Irish· coach Charlie Weis Monday, the Tribune reported. Golic is a 6­foot-5, 260-pount center from Northwest Catholic High School in New Haven, Conn. 
The commitment is the first since Weis' statements on national signing day Feb. 7, in which he criticized the trend of high school seniors committing to one program while actually keeping their recruitment open. Weis said all new "commits" would have to promise him that they would not take telephone calls from other coaches or travel to other schools for visits after the promise. Three play­ers who had previously com­mitted to Notre Dame decided to go elsewhere in the final three weeks of the recruiting cycle. 
BENGAL BOUTS 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 
Two days before the open­ing blows of the 77th annual Bengal Bouts will resound throughout a darkened Joyce Center Fieldhouse, over 200 boxers crammed into the bowels of The Pit to get in some last-minute condition­ing for what will be the largest Bouts tournament ever. 
The amateur boxers were led Monday by junior and senior captains through calis­thenics in the basketball gym, while others jumped rope, shadow boxed and hit the heavy bag in an adjoining room underneath the Joyce. Among the group were eight returning champions, dozens of experienced fighters and a large number of novice box­ers who will conclude months 
o.f training when the prelimi­nary round of the Bouts begins Wednesday at 6:30 
p.m. and continues at the same time Thursday evening. 
Bengal Bouts President and senior captain Andrew McGill said that the 200 and plus boxers that will compete this year blew away the previous record of 150 set last season. The Bouts captains were faced with so many prospec­tive boxers that they consid­

NO WOMEN'S BASKETBALL -ANALYSIS

Sometimes the formula for winning lies in the little things. 
Since Feb. 4, Notre Dame has won five straight Big East games by an average seore of 
12.2 points per game. Charel Allen has scored 25 or more points in four of those five eon­tests. The Irish defense is better than ever. It oven out-rebound­ed Louisville, the best rebound­ing team in the Big East. But no single faetor is responsible. 
Hegardless of what results may show, field goals, foul shots and turnovers have been Notre Dame's strong points this sea­son. But often they've had one or two and lacked the other.
