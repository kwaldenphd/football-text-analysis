THE 
SMC parkingraises funds for athletics 
By KATIE STAAK 
News Writer 
As ears streamed into South Bend for football games this fall, sports teams at Saint Mary's raised money by coordi­nating parking on the College's campus, said Director of Athletks Lynn Kachmarik. 
The teams raised an average of $6.000 to $12,000 each home football weekend, which goes to cover athletie expenses incurred by Saint Mary's teams. 
Freshman Andrea Sasgen, a volleyball player, parked cars for the Notre Dame-Air Force game date. 
"It was fun, but I don't think we raised as much as other teams," she said. 
Many of the teams spend their fundraising money on team apparel and traveling expenses during away games and tournaments. The money from football parking is divided evenly between the teams. 
"It's a wonderful fundraiser for the whole athletic depart­ment," volleyball coach Julie Schroeder-Biek said. "It raises money for all of our athletes. It helps fund all of our programs and helps to offset all the travel expenses, which were horrible this year."

Student wins state beauty pageant 
Buhler becomes first African-American to hold Miss South Dakota USA title 

By AMBER TRAVIS 
News Writer 
Notre Dame sophomore Charlie Buhler became the first African-American to win the title of Miss South Dakota USA on Nov. 11. 
"It was incredibly important to me," Buhler. 19, said. "I feel as if it was a step for­ward in pageantry, because it shows that you don't have to look a certain way and fit into a certain mold to be a title holder." 
Buhler was the only minori­ty in the pageant. She has participated in pageants for three years, starting with the Miss Teen South Dakota USA contest in 2006. She was in the contest a second time the

Relationship with Potawatomi tribe celebrated during Native American Heritage Month 
By KATIE PERALTA 
News Writer 
While driving around South Bend, students might notice Potawatomi Park, Potawatomi Zoo and Pokagon Street-places all named after former residents of the area, the Potawatomi American Indian tribe and its local division, the Pokagon Band. 
But not all passers-by may be aware that the land upon which Notre Dame was built once belonged to the Pokagon Band. 
As a part of Native American Heritage Month, Notre Dame's Multicultural Student Programs and Services (MSPS) will host a series of events bringing mem­bers of the Potawatomi tribe to campus to relay the history between the tribe and the University. As part of this series, MSPS will host a dinner Dec. 4 featuring members of the Potawatomi tribe to share their history. 
Before Notre Dame founder Father Edward Sorin claimed this plot of land on Nov. 26, 1842, the land had been inhabited by the Pokagon Band, said Kevin following year. 
The Miss USA Pageant doesn't fit the stereotype of other beauty contests, Buhler said. 
"I feel that it's a common misconception that you have to fit a certain stereotype, but the Miss Universe Organization looks for girls from all different back­grounds," she said. 
Buhler began preparing for last week's pageant almost immediately after the 2007 event ended. 
"Everything is a process," Buhler said. "Even after you pick out the dress, it still has to be fitted." 
Preparation for the contest involves rehearsing walks

The Chicago Treaty of 1833, however, ordered the removal of Indians in the northern Indiana region, Daugherty said. Leopold Pokagon, a prominent Potawatomi leader and the spokesperson after whom the Pokagon Band is named, negoti­ated the right to stay on the land and was given a sum of money, Daugherty said. Pokagon used this money to buy land northwest of modern-day Dowagiac, Mich., where Daugherty said many members of the band still reside today. 
During the 17th and 18th cen­turies, Potawatomi land stretched from what is now Chicago to Detroit, Daugherty said. 
Many different villages popu­lated this region and considered themselves Potawatomi, sharing a common language and culture. Such villages had alliances but operated independently on a local level.

Alcohol responsible for Duke game offenses 
By KAITLYNN RIELY 
Assistant News Editor 
Police arrested 21 people and issued 13 more arrest tickets before, during and after the Duke-Notre Dame game Saturday, said Phillip Johnson, director of the Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP). 
Working with the Indiana State Excise Police, the St. Joseph County Police and the South Bend Police, NDSP made 21 custodial arrests for alco­hol-related offenses, most of which were for public intoxica­tion. Some arrests were made for minor consumption of alco­hol and minor intoxication, Johnson said in an e-mail to The Observer Monday. 
Those arrested were taken to the St. Joseph County Jail. 
Three people were taken by ambulance to a local hospital due to high levels of intoxica­tion, Johnson said. 
Police cited four juveniles for underage consumption of alco­hol, and issued 12 arrest tick­ets to adults and the final tick­et to a juvenile; the offenses were for alcohol-related offenses such as minor con­suming and minor in posses­sion of alcohol, Johnson said. 
Four of these people were taken to the St. Joseph County Jail for public intoxication,

Vice Principal Ken Goeken ordered the girls to serve suspensions Tuesday and Wednesday for defying their coach and going ahead with a special cheer they choreographed for the last day of the football sea­son. 
At the end of the cheer, the girls bent over, lifted their skirts and showed the crowd the words "Indians No. 1" on their bloomers.

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 
Group sponsors vvon1an fron1 vvar-torn region 
By ASHLEY CHARNLEY 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's Board of Governance (BOG) will help sponsor a woman from a war-torn region through the Women for Women International organization, BOG missions commissioner Mary Frantz said. 
The organization was cre­ated to help protect the rights of women in strife­laden countries, to provide job training and give small­businesses assistance. The sponsorship is a year-long commitment to donate $30 each month. 
"They are helping women in war-torn regions by pro­viding emotional and physi­cal support," Frantz said. 
The sponsorship may also include direct correspon­dence with the woman in need. 
Women for Women International was founded in 1993. Since its founding, the organization has helped more than 125,000 women in 105 countries -including Afghanistan. Rwanda, Iraq, Sudan and Nigeria. 
Frantz is working to make applications for sponsorship available to students, but currently BOG is focused on a group effort. The idea is still in the early stages, and the group is hoping to send out more information in the com­ing months. 
In other BOG news:

CAMPUS LIFE COUNCIL 



Task forces present progress 
Second to last meetingfocuses on groups' objectives, accomplishments 
ByJENNMETZ Assistant News Editor 
In Monday's penultimate meeting of the Campus Life Council this semester, task force leaders informed the group of the progress made toward their objectives. 
Task Force on Campus Environment chair Sheena Plamoottil announced that the second of three green summits will take place today at 4 p.m. This summit is intended for rectors, but due to scheduling conflicts with a rector meeting, "hopefully rectors will send a representative of hall staff," she said. 
Knott Hall Rector Brother Jerome Meyer said the date of the summit was a "bad choice." 
"This is a week when every­one is busy," he said. The third green summit will take place Dec. 3. Plamoottil gave a brief fol­low-up of Campus Architect 
Doug Marsh's visit to the Council on Nov. 5. She said she asked student senators to ask members of their residences if they would be interested in seeing Marsh's presentation in small groups. The presentation outlined possible future plans for campus expansion and highlighted current construc­tion projects on campus. 
Student body president Liz Brown presented for the Task Force on Student Development in place of absent student body vice president Maris Braun. 
Brown said the Task Force is continuing to plan Honor Code awareness events but will be handing off most of the respon­sibility to the University Code of Honor Committee. 
"We will keep in talks with the University Code of Honor Committee, but it will become less a Campus Life Council issue," she said. 
The Task Force will continue to work on issues of student gambling and Frosh-0 activi­ties outlined in earlier meet­ings. 
Keenan senator Gus Gari presented for the Task Force on Community Relations, which has "finally finalized" the text of Notre Dame's ver­sion of "The Good Neighbor Guide," based on a University of Virginia pamphlet of the same name. 
Gari said a professor in the Law School will be looking over the text from a legal point of view. The Task Force is in the process of hearing about production logistics for the pamphlet from University of Virginia officials. 
The next step will be to take the text to Vice President for Student Affairs Father Mark Poorman's office to "see how to put it all together," Gari said. 
Next week the task forces will convene to finish working on this semester's objectives and discuss goals for the rest of the year.

Merryman acted as the fac­ulty advisor, although the Indiana CPA Society discour­ages outside help from pro­fessors and other profession­als. 
"I acted as a coach for the girls and a resource," she said. "It was their work that got them to the f'inals." 
Of the participating schools, six were chosen to advance to the finals and present their case study to a panel of practicing CPAs in Indianapolis. 
Saint Mary's came in third behind the University of Southern Indiana, which has won the competition the past four years, and Valparaiso. Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), Butler and Manchester College filled out the rest of the finalists. 
"Southern Indiana really has it down to a science," Merryman said. 
Typically, the Saint Mary's team is composed strictly of seniors. 
"It is such a big time com­mitment for seniors, so I thought it would be a good idea to include juniors who are willing to put in the time and effort," Merryman said. 
She said Southern Indiana's continuity-enhancing practice of including juniors and sen­iors on the team has aided in its success. 
Noreen hopes for continued success with Saint Mary's participation in this event. 
"This is the best showing we have ever had," she said. "It was truly a great experi­ence that helped build my teamwork and leadership skills."

Iranian, Venezuelan presidents hope to defeat America as the value of the dollar decreases 
Associated Press 
TEHRAN, Iran -The presidents of Venezuela and Iran boasted Monday that they will defeat U.S. imperialism together, say­ing the fall of the dollar is a prelude to the end of Washington's global domi­nance. 
Hugo Chavez's visit to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Tehran followed a failed weekend attempt by the firebrand duo to push the Organization of Petroleum Exporting States away from trading in the slump­ing greenback. 
Their proposal at an OPEC summit was over­ruled by other cartel members led by Saudi Arabia, a strong U.S. ally. But the cartel agreed to have OPEC finance minis­ters discuss the idea, and the two allies' move showed their potential for stirring up problems for the U.S.

Johnson said in his e-mail that Cappy Gagnon, the coor­dinator of stadium personnel, reported that 82 people were removed from the stadium for violating rules that prohibit throwing objects in the stands. Many students in the senior section threw marshmallows during halftime to mark the last home game at Notre Dame Stadium for the 2007 season.

Mortgage mailing campaign beings 
WASIIINGTON -An alliance created to combat a rising flood of mortgage foreclosures began a nationwide mail campaign Monday, offering help to homeowners who may be hav­ing trouble meeting their mortgage payments. 
The Hope Now alliance will mail 300,000 of the one-page letters before the end of next week. The letters urge the recipients to seek information on the options available to avoid defaulting on their mortgages. 
"Homeowners can easily fmd out about relief options that may include repayment plans, changes that can be made to the terms of a loan and other alternatives for which homeowners may be eligible," the letters state, proyiding a toll-free telephone number, 888-995-HOPE. 
The Hope Now alliance, a partnership between mortgage companies and nonprofit housing counselors, is being backed by the Bush administration, which believes it will overcome the reluctance of many homeowners to make contact with their mortgage companies when they start to become worried about meet­ing their monthly payments. 
French rail workers keep strike 
PARIS -Transport workers causing havoc on French rails voted to extend their strike into a seventh day Tm~sday, when they will be joined by a mass walkout of civil servants, increasing pressure on President Nicolas Sarkozy to backtrack on his reforms. 
But the government stood its ground, with Prime Minister Francois Filion saying the reforms must go through -even though the strikes are costing the government at least $439.6 million a day. 
Strikes led by train drivers angry over Sarkozy's plans to extend their retirement age have hampered rail traffic and public trans­port and snarled roads again Monday. Schools and postal and tax services will fall victim Tuesday to a strike by civil servants seeking higher salaries and job security. Air traffic, too, will be affected.

Besides giving impoverished people a means to help them­selves, Otero said microfi­nance institutions such as ACCION can create economi­cally self-sufficient banks, since banks allow organiza­tions access to larger amounts of money than donors have.

"The amount of money that's out on the street in those loans [from organiza­tions that ACCION creat­ed] is about 2.8 billion dollars," Otero said. "The only way you can get [bil­lions of dollars] is to become a bank."

"I think this is the best way to go if you're an immigrant," she said. "You can help your family, help yourself up. Isn't this what the American Dream is all about?" 
Otero next plans to expand ACCION in Africa and India and to make the loan process faster and cheaper. 
"I had worked in Africa and Asia and thought, 'We have to go there."' she said. "There's such a need." 
ACCION, however, has expe­rienced difficulties in some countries, especially when laws impede setting up banks. 
"Sometimes [the countries[ don't allow you to set up a bank like this, but more importantly, they take forev­er," Otero said. "It took us two and a half years in Nigeria to set up a bank, and the bank in the first two months had a thousand clients. The laws for the central bank are poorly developed." 
Otero received $15,000 for her prize, with a matching $15,000 for a Latin American charity, and she will give the matching funds to the Organization of Youth Empowerment (OYE). which operates in Honduras. 
Justin Eldridge-Otero, Otero's son and an OYE co­founder, said the organization concentrates on educating orphans in Honduras so they will be prepared for life when they leave the orphanage. 
"This coming year, we're going to have our first two graduates, one in engineering and one in psychology," Eldridge-Otero said. "The ulti­mate goal is to get these young women to go to college and reverse the cycle of poverty that's been afflicting their families forever."

the southwest Michigan and northern Indiana region, includ­ing the grounds where campus is now. 
"They of course moved around a bit," Daugherty said. "They moved along the St. Joseph River to farm, hunt and gather." 
Notre Dame anthropology pro­fessor Mark Schurr led an archaeological survey along the St. Joseph Hiver about five years ago. The survey, a joint effort of a Notre Dame field school and the Pokagon Band, lasted about three years and revealed a few village sites along the river, Schurr said. 
American settlers began mov­ing west and consequently pushed for removal of American Indians by the U.S. government, Daugherty said. 
In compliance with settlers' demands for westward migration, the Indian Removal Act of 1830 dictated that all native peoples east of the Mississippi River move to present day states of Kansas and Oklahoma, said Ben Secunda, a Notre Dame history professor. 
Just as the Cherokee's removal was called the "Trail of Tears," Secunda said, the Potawatomi called their removal the "Trail of Death." The Potawatomi tribe, along with sympathetic whites such as the Catholic missionaries and traders friendly to the Indians, strongly protested it. 
Secunda noted that violent roundups, led by governmental officials like Indian agent John Tipton, occurred throughout the Midwest except in the area of Michigan where Leopold Pokagon had secured land for his people. Pokagon's land, Secunda said, became a safe haven for refugees evading the removal to Kansas. Baptist missionaries in the area supported such removals, he said. 
To resist such removal, Leopold Pokagon, in 1830, trekked to Detroit to the Catholic headquar­ters to make an appeal, Secunda said. He asked for a Catholic priest to come back with him, one who would aid in removal resist­ance, convincing Father Stephen Badin and the Catholic missionar­ies to come down to the South Bend area, Secunda said. 
Badin and the missionaries came and worked out of Pokagon's log chapel, the famous historic landmark next to Saint Mary's Lake, Secunda said. This became their base of operations. 
Essentially, he said, out of Leopold Pokagon's appeal came Notre Dame. 
"The Pokagon band, Roman Catholic Church and Notre Dame priests supplemented each other at a key point in their history," Schurr said. "Since then the groups have gone their separate ways. None would be as success­ful as they are now." 
Badin and the other Catholic missionaries successfully replaced the other pro-removal missionaries. 
"The forerunners of the University did the right thing," Secunda said. "With their help, the Potawatomi people were able to maintain a level of self-suffi­ciency, avoid removal, become Catholic and basically survive as a people." 
When Sorin arrived in the area in fall of 1841, "the Pokagons and the Catholics were interacting readily," Daugherty said. 
From the beginning, the Potawatomi in the area coexisted peacefully with the new settlers, Schurr said. 
In fact, he said, Badin and the other priests shared many meals with the tribe members. They also lived in close proximity with the tribe. 
The Pokagon Band today is scattered throughout Midwest. This dispersal is not totally unprecedented, Daugherty said. 
"We have never had a land base or tribal ownership," he said. 
Though there is dispersal, the largest Pokagon population today is located in northern Indiana and southwestern Michigan. 
About 3,300 members are in the Band today, and Daugherty said roughly 40 percent live with­in about 30 miles of Dowagiac. There is also a large concentra­tion of people in the Kalamazoo area, with the remainder scat­tered across the Midwest. 
Native American Heritage Month at Notre Dame includes a number of programs. In addition to the Dec. 4 dinner, the agenda includes a workshop in black ash basketry on Nov. 26. A visual dis­play on contemporary American Indians will be displayed in the library for the remainder of the month.

Sex scandal rocks Atlanta church 
Pastor claims uncle to be his father; paternity test confirms allegation 
Associated Press 
DECATUR, Ga. -The 80­year-old leader of a subur­ban Atlanta megachurch is at the center of a sex scan­dal of biblical dimensions: He slept with his brother's wife and fathered a child by her. 
Members of Archbishop Earl Paulk's family stood at the pulpit of the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit at Chapel Hill Harvester Church a few Sundays ago and revealed the secret exposed by a recent court-ordered pater­nity test. 
In truth, this is not the first -or even the second -sex scandal to engulf Paulk and the 

Bureau of Investigation, which are investigating Earl Paulk for possible per­jury and false-swearing charges stemming from a lawsuit. 
The archbishop, his brother and the church are being sued by former church employee Mona Brewer, who says Earl Paulk manipulated her into an affair from 1989 to 2003 by telling her it was her only path to salvation. Earl Paulk admitted to the affair in front of the church last January. 
In a 2006 deposition stemming from the lawsuit, the archbishop said under oath that the only woman he had ever

lying under So far no oath about head pastor charges have 
the affair. 
The living proof of that lie is 34-year-old D.E. Paulk, who for years was known publicly as Earl Paulk's nephew. 
"I am so very sorry for the collateral damage it's caused our family and the families hurt by the remov­ing of the veil that hid our humanity and our sinful­ness," said D.E. Paulk, who received the mantle of head pastor a year and a half ago. 
D.E. Paulk said he did not learn the secret of his parentage until the paterni­ty test. "I was disappointed, and I was surprised," he said. 
Earl Paulk, his brother, Don, and his sister-in-law, Clariece, did not return calls for comment. 
A judge ordered the test at the request of the Cobb County district attorney's office and the Georgia been filed 

against Earl 
Paulk. District Attorney Pat Head and GBI spokesman John Bankhead would not com­ment. 
The shocking results of the paternity test are speeding up a transforma­tion already under way in the church after more than a decade of sex scandals and lawsuits involving the Paulks, D.E. Paulk said. 
"It was a necessary evil to bring us back to a God-con­sciousness," said the younger Paulk, explaining that the church had become too personality-driven and prone to pastor worship. 
The flashy megachurch began in 1960 with just a few dozen members in the Little Five Points neighbor­hood of Atlanta. Now, it is in the suburbs on a 100­acre expanse, a collection of buildings surrounding a neo-Gothic cathedral. 
For years the church was at the forefront of many social movements -admit­ting black members in the 1960s, ordaining women and opening its doors to gays. 
At its peak in the early 1990s, it claimed about 10,000 members and 24 pastors and was a media powerhouse. By soliciting tithes of 10 percent from each member's income, the church was able to build a Bible college, two schools, a worldwide TV ministry and a $12 million sanctuary the size of a fortress. 
Today, though, member­ship is down to about 1,500, the church has 18 pastors, most of them vol­unteers, and the Bible col­lege and TV ministry have shuttered-a downturn blamed largely on com­plaints about the alleged sexual transgressions of the elder Paulks. 
In 1992, a church mem­ber claimed she was pres­sured into a sexual rela­tionship with Don Paulk. Other women also claimed they had been coerced into sex with Earl Paulk and other members of the church's administration. 
The church countered with a $24 million libel suit against seven former church members. The law­suit was later dropped.

Peterson says he's worried about missing wife 
Lawyer asserts he does not expect former Chicago police officer to face charges in disappeared fourth wife 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO-A lawyer repre­senting a former police officer suspected in the disappearance of his wife said Monday he does not believe his client will face charges stemming from the investigation. 
Speaking on NBC's "Today" show, lawyer Joel Brodsky also criticized the media for their coverage of Drew Peterson, who resigned as a Bolingbrook police sergeant after his 23-year-old fourth wife, Stacy, vanished three weeks ago. 
Police have named the 53­year-old Peterson as a suspect in her disappearance, and authorities have called the case a possible homicide. He has denied any involvement in her disappearance. 
"We do not expect to be charged in these cases," Brodsky said. "This is out of control. It's a rush to judgment fueled by people, by entertain­ment and people seem to want to be entertained by what's going on." 
Brodsky, who began repre­senting Peterson on Friday, declined to let his client respond to most questions during Monday's short interview. 
Peterson, whose children with Stacy Peterson are 2 and 4, answered "yes" when asked if he was worried she may never. return home. "Kids need a mom," he said. 
Asked if he was worried about his wife, he said: "Of course. Your wife leaves you and I have kids at home, you're very much worried about her." 
Peterson reiterated that he thinks his wife left him for another man. ''I'd like to have her publicly show herself so we can clear all this up," said Peterson, who has older chil­dren from an earlier marriage. 
After returning from a hotel where he appeared on the "Today" show via satellite, Peterson stopped and talked to reporters in the driveway of his Bolingbrook home. He called the attention paid to his life "mind-boggling." 
"People are looking at me under a magnifying glass. It's very upsetting. You know, I mean, what I had for breakfast is newsworthy. So it's crazy. Look at these people," he said, gesturing to the media. "This is hilarious. It's just not how I want to be spending my retire­ment." 
Peterson later participated in a photo shoot in his backyard, but it was not immediately clear which media outlet commis­sioned it. 
Stacy Peterson, who was studying nursing at a junior col­lege, disappeared from the cou­ple's suburban Chicago home Oct. 28. Volunteers have been canvassing fields, lakes and construction sites near the fami­ly's house, but have found no traces of the woman. 

Still, the investigation into her disappearance caused prosecu­tors to reopen the investigation into the death of Peterson's third wife, Kathleen Savio, whose body was found in a bathtub in 2004. 
At the time, authorities ruled her death an accidental drown­ing, but investigators exhumed her body last week at the request of a prosecutor, who has said after examining evi­dence he believes her death was a homicide staged to look like an accident. 
A pathologist who conducted another autopsy on Savio's body for her family said last week he believes the woman was mur­dered. 
Savio's remains were returned Monday to th~ cemetery, according to the Will County coroner's office. The state's attorney's office said it could be a couple weeks before investi­gators have final results from tests related to the autopsy. 
Peterson also has denied any role in Savio's death. He was asked Monday for his reaction to speculation that Savio was murdered. "Yes, I'm upset to hear something like that said. Very much so," he said on the "Today" show. 
Later, he denied claims made by his second wife, Vicki Connolly, that Peterson told her he could kill her and make it look like an accident. Connolly said that while she didn't believe he ever would kill her, she confided in Bolingbrook police officers she considered friends. 
"I've never said anything like that, or even thought anything like that," Peterson said. "I don't know what's going through her head. I thought her and I had a good relationship. I thought we were friends. For her to say something like that, I don't know if it was driven by the media or whatever. Who knows?"

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Finding religious convergence 
If you use current headlines as a barometer of Christian-Muslim rela­tions, you may come to the conclu­sion that there is little convergence between Christianity and Islam. But if you suspect that it might be unfair to compare the ideals of one's own reli­gion (e.g., that the Beatitudes call Christians to be peacemakers, but we do not always live up to this} with the realities of another (e.g., that the extremists depicted in the nightly news may in fact be condemned by many Muslims as un-Islamic}, then where can you go for a brief summa­ry comparing Christian and Muslim belinfs? 
In addition to consulting Muslim sourees, a handy resource for Catholies is a short but signifieant document from the Sneond Vatiean Couneil, Nostra !lelale (Declaration on the Helation of the Church to non­Christians}, which is the first sub­stantive conciliar teaching about Islam (and Judaism, for that matter). In its section on Islam, Nostra Aelale lists areas of theological convergence and divergence. Areas of conver­gence include belief in one God, judg­ment day and the resurrection of the body (ours, not Christ's}; it also men­tions that both religions also honor Mary. The document singles out three practices Muslims and Christians share: prayer, fasting and almsgiving. It also mentions points of disagree-

mont, such as the fact that Muslims consider Jesus a prophet but not divine. Interestingly, the document is silent about two othnr significant points of Christian-Muslim diver­gence: the status of Muhammad as a prophet and the Quran as revelation. 
Christian knowledge of these areas of convergence and divergence is not new; even 12th-eentury theologians who knew very little about Islam (and were eritical of it) recognized that Muslims were monotheists who prac­ticed prayer, fasting and almsgiving. So what is revolutionary about 
Nostra Aetate? 

Nostra Aetate is significant as the first positive statement about Islam issuing from a church council. Its section three begins, "The Chureh regards with esteem the Muslims." The importance of this phrase and what follows cannot be underestimat­ed. While there an~ examples from history of individual theologians whose writings ineluded sporadic praise of Islam-e.g., medieval l'ig­ures like Hamon Llull, William of Tripoli and Pope Gregory VII -Noslra Aetate is the first unequivo­cally positive statement about Islam from the highest level of church authority, the Council. 
Nostra Aetate is important for another reason. After outlining basic doctrinal similarities and differences, it concludes by exhorting Catholics

and Muslims to "work sincerely for mutual understanding and to pre­serve as wnll as promote" soeial jus­tiee, peaee and freedom. The doeu­ment encourages-indeed, ealls­Catholics to enter into dialogue and collaboration with Muslims. Nostra Aetale is in faet the impetus for all Catholie interreligious relations: We do it not bneause it's the "in" thing to do, but beeause it's the Catholic thing to do. 
Nostra Aelate's call to dialogue over 40 years ago has sinee sparked many encounters: From formal dis­cussions between bishops and imams in Home and Cairo to grassroots meetings between Catholic and Muslim moms in suburban Bridgeview, Illinois. Unfortunately, these dialogues don't make the head­lines. But they should, bneause these ordinary encounters arn in faet a supremely important kind of eonver­gence between Islam and Christianity:\ One that is relational, not theological. After all, there really is no sueh thing as a dialogue between "Catholieism" and "Islam"­there are only relationships between Catholics and Muslims.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
The halftime marshmallow fight is a tradition Notre Dame students look forward to for three years. The morn­ing of the last football game, seniors can be found all over campus finding creative ways to elude ushers and smuggle precious marshmallows inside -whether by shoving them down their pants or duct taping bags to their armpits, for Notre Dame students, when there is a will, there is a way. Despite the University's best efforts, which included forcing students to remove clothing to gain entrance to the Stadium, Saturday's marshmallow fight attracted more attention than the half­time show, proving that our beloved ushers had failed. 
Not to be outdone, however, the ush­ers had a plan. Rather than make any 
Bad call, ushers 

attempt to stop the fight in action, con­fiscate marshmallows during the fight, or even display their displeasure, the five or six ushers in my section appeared to be enjoying the spectacle. The mood quickly changed when the students ran out of marshmallows and the fight calmed down, prompting ush­ers to switch gears and randomly choose at least 20 students to be kicked out of the game. When one stu­dent was asked why she was being kicked out of the stadium, an usher responded "we're making an example out of you." The usher then explained that they were plucking students of'f the ends of the sections since it was too hard to get the students in the middle. Clearly, law enforcement at its best. 
I've heard many different arguments against marshmallow fighting: They are extremely hard to clean up, they can injure people if heavy objects are shoved inside, marshmallows landing on the field pose a safety hazard, etc. All I have to say is, graduating from Notre Dame is hard, too. Most people are smart enough not to put hard objects into marshmallows and as harsh as it may sound, I'm not terribly worried about Trevor Laws, Jimmy Clausen or anyone else being downed by a white fluffy projectile. I can understand taking away all the marsh­mallows you can find upon entering the stadium. I can understand kicking someone out for being hopelessly intoxicated and chucking marshmal­lows at the grandmas sitting in the neighboring general admission sec­tions. What I cannot understand is sharing delight with students and then ejecting some at random, after they have spent over $100,000 to gain the honor of throwing a few harmless marshmallows. They say tradition never graduates, but news flash -we do. Those 20 students were robbed of their last home game, when the rest of us were just as guilty as they were. Ushers, we appreciate your hard work, but let's face it: On Saturday it was you, not Charlie Weis, who made the bad call.

Continued discussion of moral relativism 
Errors In terminology 
Kevin Sharron's article ("Absolute moral code not necessary for moral behavior," Nov. 18) is well intentioned, but it incorrectly employs terminology. We'll start from the beginning. 
The idea of an "absolute moral truth" is that within human beings there are inherent standards of conduct which we can derive using logic and common experiences. The idea is not the equiva­lent of a political or religious structure, though structures employ the idea from time to time. For instance, the Catholic Church uses moral law to formulate doc­trine and social justice teachings. Absolute moral standards are part of the Church's tradition, in line with the Church's belief' that God created the human mind oriented towards himself, towards truth and love. Sharron actually confirms this by his example of a hypo­thetical situation. "If your code and all laws ceased existing at this very moment, what would you do? Would you commit murder or steal from the person sitting next to you?...I would not commit 
these crimes because I care about humankind and value order in society." Thus, he asserts that if all government structures were to fall, he would still feel responsibility to act justly towards his neighbor; regardless of the circum­stances, he still feels the tug of justice and order. This is precisely the assertion of the person who believes in an absolute moral code; I applaud Sharron for understanding the concept even if he misuses the terminology and he himself is evidence of this inherent standard of justice. 
And now, a hypothetical of my own. Fred, the moral relativist, disagrees that there is an inherent standard of conduct. That means he has no rules. He thinks that what's okay for GK might be wrong for Lewis, or that Lewis can't formulate an opinion on GK's behavior unless GK is harming Lewis. Fred has the right to do anything, for he is the only one allowed to decide what Fred can do. GK and Lewis get nervous because if Fred is right and there is no such thing a moral absolutism, GK and Lewis might be toast. To this, Fred replies that "morality is rel­ative, so long as it does not harm other people" or "morality is relative, and peo­ple can be harmed only for the common good," but GK and Lewis snicker to themselves because they know that Fred has just added an absolute requisite to his relativistic philosophy. Thus, Fred joins the chorus with Karl and Pete (a great singer) in a rousing hymn of "There is no such thing as absolute truth, except for this statement!" 
Cynthia Weber freshman Pasquerilla West Hall Nov. 20 
Circular judgment 
This is a response to Kevin Sherrin's letter on moral relativism ("Absolute moral code not necessary for moral behavior," Nov. 18). Mr. Sherrin writes: "By claiming that no universal standard of morality exists, moral relativists allow themselves to judge the goodness of actions by whatever standard they choose." While that may be the case, such a judgment is circular. When relativists judge by whatever standard they choose, they are making a judgment call between competing standards. In the end, either their method of deci­sion is reducible to an absolutely cor­rect standard or their judgment is reduced to mere opinion. 
Matthew Balkey freshman Dillon Hall Nov.l9 

Actions speak louder than words 
In his Nov. 19 letter ("Absolute moral code not necessary for moral behavior"), Kevin Sherrin says that he finds "it strange that [Nathan Loyd[ believes that moral relativism denies us the ability to decide the morality of certain actions .... By claiming that no universal standard of morality exist.<;, moral relativists ... judge the goodness of actions by whatever stan­dard they choose." I agree with Sherrin that "this stance" does not impair an indi­vidual's ability to make decisions; however, as one who believes that some moral absolutes exist, I argue that "this stance" allows that individual to make underin­formed moral judgments. An uninformed moral absolutist -one who believes in the existence of moral absolutes -is also capable of making underinformed deci­sions. 
Sherrin also offers: "I believe that Loyd meant to say that moral relativism ques­tions our ability to reaffirm that extra­marital sex is undoubtedly wrong." I sug­gest that instead of undoubtedly, one could try the word universally or absolutely. Surely a relativist cannot assert such a thing! 
Sherrin asks about the importance of an individual's ability to independently make moral judgments. Loyd argued that "with­out an absolute moral code, we could have no law." !flaw refers to the act of effecting laws in an absolutely just manner, Loyd is probably right. However, Sherrin seems to be correct that moral relativists would not fall into anarchy, a point William Golding asserts in "Lord of the Flies." Likewise, if all common laws ceased to exist, we would not immediately start committing crimes because many of us are essentially decent people. I agree that people do have their own "sets of beliefs as to what is right or wrong without an absolute moral code to guide them" -i.e. their own morals and values, but moral relativists are unable to make sound moral judgments about right and wrong. 
One should also remember that actions speak louder than words. Consider the scenario of doctor Delia Surridge from the movie "V for Vendetta." She had hoped her whole life to fmd cures for diseases and participated in horrible atrocities against other human beings. She had felt guilty for participating in this effort but hopeful about finding this cure for a good cause. In exacting his own sort of justice, the protagonist V states: "I have not come for what you had hoped to do. I have come for what you did." Delia's actions were morally wrong although she had initally hoped that they would lead to some fur­ther good; she ignored the consequences of her active participation in a project that actually committed crimes against human­ity. Delia is an ethical relativist. V may be a moral absolutist. As a nominal Christian, I turn to the parable of the good Samaritan. Jesus states: "Whatsoever you do to the least of my people, that you do unto me" (Matthew 25:40). The set of moral absolutes includes a commandment to actively love your neighbor as yourself. Love is part of a universal human con­science that all people are capable of agreeing upon. 
My advice is this: Stay informed and alert, and listen to your conscience. Make decisions based on true facts. Grow in wis­dom and understanding. Make a positive difference. How? In the words of Aristotle, "Where your talents and the needs of the world cross, there lies your vocation." Actions speak louder than words. Live that vocation, and live it well.

Every kid, college or otherwise, has the saJne: to go to Disney World. Junior Andrew Nesi did just that this semester, but hi<> dreaJn trip took on a fairy tale twist different than most pnople making the trip to the Mecca of ma!-,riC. 
lie did it for free. 
Two of Nesi's dasses this semester-U.S. I~nvironmental Ili<>tory and Di<>ney in Film and Ameriean culture -required long final papers. The first required an analysis of nature in an American source aJld the second called for a research paper on anything Disney-related. So naturally, Nesi, who writes a biweekly column for The Observer, did what any resourceful eollege kid would -he decid­ed to kill two litnrary birds with one st<mn and combine the papers with a trip l<> Orlando to do research on Di<>ney World aJld nature. 
Nesi spent five days in Orlando from Nov. 1 through Nov. 5. A Underbrraduate Researeh Opportunities (UHOP) grant paid fi>r his air­fh.re, hotel, rental car, park tickets and meals during the trip. Nesi footed the bill for sou­venirs and a picture of himself on Splash Mountain. He spent the first day reading locm newspaper clippings from the 1970s in the Orlm1do Public library, researching the begin­nin!-,'S of lli<>ney World and the initial plans for tim park. Nesi then spent three days in Disney World. That included a behind-the-scenes tour of tiw Animal Kingdom on tho first day, a trip l<> EPCOT visit l<> "Future World," an obligatory trip to the Magic Kingdom for fireworks, a nighttime ride on Splash Mountain. a Jungle Cruise, quality time spent in Tomorrowland, Frontierland, and Adventureland m1d a stay at the high-end Animal Kingdom I ,odgR 
After talking with Disney experts about nature, Nesi leamnd that park ollkials have l<> rneoneile ti1eir wL<>h l<> keep ti1e pm·k a "natu­ral" environment while still making it appeal­ing to children. Originally, park ollieials didn't want I.<J have Di<>nny characters strewn about the place, but high demand fim:ed them to accede to the wi<>hes of their cust<>mers. Even so, they eontinue l<> try and keep animated ani­mal<> away from the real ones. As Nesi put it: 'The monkeys will never see Balloo." (Fun fact: the Animal Kingdom uses biodegradable paper straws, which Nesi describes as "weird l<> use" but are supposedly better for the envi­ronment) 
"like EPCOl~ I think the Magic Kingdom li>cuses on nature as a tool of progress," he said. "[It's] not something to be conserved for il<> own sake." 
Of course, Nesi had to do his homework before going out to play. After writing a live-page grant pro­posal, obtaining a let­ter of recommenda­tion and drafting a budget proposal, he applied for a grant through UHOI~ 
'!be rest, as they say, is history -although Nesi wasn't sure his proposal would be taken snriou-;ly. "I wa<; worried that they wouldn't believe me that it was a legitimate project," he said, "so I had to do pretty sub­stantial research before I proposed the idea to demonstrate that I was serious about this and I wasn't just in it tor the fireworks over Cinderella's Castle." 
"Going to Disney alone was fun becausn it let me move at my own pace <md ride whauwer I wanted whenever I wantnd," he said, noting that lines are much shorter fbr singles ti1an fbr groups. "But you also feel sort of creepy some­times walking around alone, standing in line behind little kids and taking extensivn not<1s." 
Like many other young people who have vis­ited Disney, Nesi said hl-; only regret was timt he had to return home. He lamented the change in climate in particular, mentioning that on his last day in Florida it was 85 degress. Whnn he got home, "it wa<; flurrying." 
To answer tim obligai.!Jry qunstion: Nesi did see Mickey Mou<;e during hi<> time in Orlcu1do, three times in all, dressed once as a Park Ranger, once tbr a parade and once to meet kids in his hou-;e in tim Animal Kingdom. 
'Tie's a pretty versatile guy," Nesi said. "I even took a picture ofhim." 
lie went on l<> say that. he has three favorite Disney rides from the trip, one from eaeh park. "In the Animal Kingdom, it was definitely Kilimanjaro Safari," he said. The ride takes thrill seekers on a no-boundaries tour com­plete with lions, giraffes and elephants. Nesi said his EPCOT favorite was a new ride called "Soarin,"' which takes riders on a mock llyover of California complete with the smell of fresh oranges. "It was a great ride," he said. Finally, Nesi said his favorite Magic Kingdom ride was, and has always been, Splash Mountain, having ridden it seven times during his most recent visit. "The drop always gets me, even ifthe rest ofthe ride ran be kind ofannoying," he said. 
To wit, Nesi rates "The Lion King" his

''One Fine Wire' and "lied Down" 
The Hollywood writers' strike may have yielded repeat after repeat of your favorite shows. Usually a habitue of Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno, I had almost given up on watching late-night television for the time being until I James Costa saw a repeat of an episode from this Scene & Heard past summer on NBC last week fea­turing a rock band called the Cold War Kids. Sounding like angry brew of early Matchbox Twenty and Ryan Adams with hints of Maroon 5 and even Hadiohead, I turned up the volume to better hear this eatchy new blend of fringe pop. 
Jumping around my television, albeit not live (damn TV writers), was a rau­cous and wild indie rock group from Long Beaeh, Calif., that played pop hooks with the energy of The Clash. I was sold. Usually late night appear­ances are a tepid event featuring shoe­gazing hipsters strumming tunes eerily similar to Elvis Costello or Beck songs. The Cold War Kids seemed to walk the tight-rope between indie-rock ingenu­ity and the energy and zeal of a classic roek cover band covering "Free Bird" at the end of a long night. It was so good that I drove over to Barnes and Noble on Grape Road to pick up their been inundated with Caillat's serenad­ing. 
You don't have to be "Top 20" addict to appreciate Caillat. And even if you don't enjoy Britney Spears, Ashlee Simpson and the typical girl solo act, be assured that your venture into pop culture will not be a waste of your time. Caillat avoids the sometimes ridiculous female musician image, and instead opts for a sweet yet stylish sound wrapped in a down to earth package. She's kind of the California girl-next-door of music: relaxed and real, if not sometimes a bit simplistic. 
Her recent release, the self-titled, 
"Coco," debuts her clear 
musical potential. Caillat 
seems to have won the musical lottery. That or she just has executed some seriously smart strategy to achieve her 
success. She has the typi­

After a first listen, it reminds me of Mute Math's recent work, yet different in how it uses live studio recordings with creepy and mechanical sonic effects to create an indelible sound. Like most all

This is seen most in their plentiful use of references to Salinger, Garcia Marquez and Jesus. Indeed, the references are the type that would make a slightly brainy high school kid grin with glee at his ability to understand the meaning of the lyrics, however they can get a bit old. 
Back to Matchbox Twenty for a sec­ond. Back with MB20 came out with its debut album, "Yourself or Someone Like You," the band was hailed as slightly off-beat, fresh and positively rocking. Then a series of follow-up her way to the top through ruthless commercialization, Caillat's suceess is actually web based. 
Her discovery results from the MySpace cultural phenomenon. Caillat's decision to put her then unknown work on the site paid off. As of yesterday her MySpace site has had 14,175,936 hits. That type of populari­ty gave her songs the exposure it takes to break into the industry. Not to men­tion, having an already intact fan base, assuredly made her an intriguing prospect for what is now her label, Universal Republic. Organic talent plus bloggers apparently does yield an almost unprecedented rise to fame -a tantalizing ideal for any musician play­ing in relative obscurity. In fact, if you give her page a quick glance you'll find a wall overwhelmed with cries of sup­port from hundreds of struggling artists. 
If anything, "Coco" is a commendable departure from pop culture norms and redundancy. Perhaps she will pick up where artists like Jack Johnson start­ed, but "Coco" may not be the cd to do it. Caillat still has a long way to go in terms of musical maturity. While her style of charming and cheerful melodies is extremely catchy, lacks the sophistication to make true lasting 
albums over the next few years came out and they could never regain the fantastic sound and enthusiasm that propelled them to superstardom in the first place. The trouble with The Cold War Kids is that they show a little too 
close a 
promise a fresh take on an oft­used and anti­quated 
sound, and it almost works. Yet unfor­tunately, too many of the sounds fall into the realm of cliched mainstream parading as underground -very much like the trouble encountered by Matchbox. 
This isn't to say it's all bad though. Two songs in particular, "We Used to Vacation" and "Hospital Beds," are a real joy to listen to. In "We Used to Vacation," the listener is treated to a

classics. "Bubbly" may be exception to the rule, and is the solid high point of the album. Caillat makes the' mistake of front-loading her Coco with tunes like "Oxygen," "One Fine Wire" and "My Feelings Show." She would have done well to conclude her CD with as much power and energy as she started it with. Songs like "Capri" disappoint compared to her earlier tracks. 
In a break from her inexperienced repetitiveness, "Tied Down," is Caillat's attempt at musical experimentation. In this track she tacks advantage of her cool, fun vocals, coupling them with a ukulele instrumental. This winning combination is a path that Caillat would benefit from exploring more in the future. With tracks like this, her future in the music business looks bright indeed. 
Though Colbie Caillat has a long way to go artistically, Coco is a promising start. Check out her album's highlights. But unless you're totally infatuated with this up and coming artist don't rush out to purchase the entire album. And if you're looking for a relaxing exam pick me up, Caillat's better tracks are sure to satisfy the most stressed studier.

sad but upbeat tale of domestic difficul­ties and the trouble with having an alcoholic father who is intent on chang­ing his ways but just can't overcome the hurdles of sobriety. "Hospital Beds" details life in a hospital and the weird reality of living in a world of strangers and despair. Using a pounding piano along with rough but strong lyrics, lead singer Nathan Willet wails, "I got one friend laying across from me I I did not choose him I He did not choose me. I We've got no chance of recovering I In the hospital I The joy of misery." Just a moment later, some obvious Christian imagery is presented with the bap­tismal reference, "Put out the fire on us." While wading dangerously close to being too much, Willet sings it all with enough gusto and emotion to make it worth the listen. 
This bad isn't going to save the world. They aren't the "Best New Band in the World" like it was proclaimed in NME. However, they're pretty good and worth the $14 bucks or so it'll take to own the CD. And if you do buy it, get it in the store and not on iTunes because the cover art and booklet is pretty sweet.

Former Michigan coach Uoyd Carr, right, congratulates senior quarterback Chad Henne during the Wolverines' 38-0 win over Notre Dame on Sept. 16. Carr announced his resignation Monday. 
Carr resigns after 13 seasons in Ann Arbor 
Associated Press 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. ­Lloyd Carr alternately choked up and chuckled for nearly 40 minutes Monday, as he announced his 13th sea­son as Michigan football coach will be his last. 
"I wanted to be able to walk out of here know­ing that to the very last minute, I did my job to the best of my ability," Carr said with watery eyes. "And I know I'll be able to do that." 
The best of Carr's abil­ity brought Michigan a national title and five Big Ten championships. 
It  also  included  an  
unsightly  loss  to  
Appalachian  State  to  

open this season and a fourth consecutive 

defeat and sixth in seven years to Jim Tressel and Ohio State to close it. 
Many of those memo­ries were very close to the surface at Monday's news conference during which the public that rarely got to see his true personality also learned what had happened behind closed doors the previous day when Carr broke the news to his players and staff. 
"I cried more tears than I knew I had," said Carr, who spent 28 sea­sons on the Michigan coaching staff. "And I've never laughed so hard in my life because there were so many memo­ries." 
Carr will coach the Wolverines in their bowl game, likely to be either the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio or the Outback Bowl in Tampa, Fla. Following the bowl game he will become an asso­ciate athletic director. 
The retirement announcement surprised no one. 
Last winter, Carr had his contract reworked to pave the way for this to be his last season and later made sure the school gave his assis­tants unprecedented two-year deals. 
The only unknown was when the 62~year-old Carr would choose to step away from the side­line: Monday, as he did, or after the bowl game. 
"My timing is based on one thing, what is best for Michigan football," he said. "There arc no other motives. 
"To do it after a bowl game would have been absolutely ridiculous." 
The departure opens a job at the nation's win­ningest football program and the timing of it might make things uncomfortable for top­ranked LSU and coach Les Miles. 
Miles seems to be at the top of the list in Ann Arbor. lie played for Bo Schembechler at Michigan, where he met his wife and later became an assistant under Schembechler. 
On Monday in Baton Rouge, La., though, Miles insisted he's not looking for a job and said Michigan has not called him. 
"I love LSU," he said. 
IN BRIEF Tyson serves one day in jail
for DUI 
MESA, Ariz. -Mike Tyson could have received more than four years in prison. He left the courtroom having to serve all of one day in an open-air jail. 
The former heavyweight champion was sentenced Monday for cocaine possession and driving under the influ­ence. 
"I take responsibility for my actions," Tyson told the judge. lie left the courthouse flanked by supporters, lit a cigar and drove away in the back of a black Mercedes. 
The 41-year-old boxer will serve his day in jail Tuesday for DUI. He received three years of probation for the cocaine charge and also will have to pay a fine, submit to drug test­ing and serve 360 hours of community service. 

Chicago's Garland shipped
to Angels for Cabrera 
CIIICAGO -Gold Glove short­stop Orlando Cabrera was traded by the Los Angeles Angels to the Chicago White Sox for pitcher Jon Garland on Monday in a sur­prising swap of dependable play­ers. 
The deal came 12 days after the White Sox re-signed short­stop Juan Uribe to a $4.5 million, one-year contract. Now, he could wind up on the bench or with another team. 
"We saw an opportunity to acquire one of the best short­stops in the game and one of the smartest in the game. Somebody who can fit into the No. 2 spot in our lineup for 155 games," Chicago general manager Ken Williams said, adding the trade frees up money that could help the White Sox pull off another deal. 
Vick surrenders, ~prisonsentence three wee~CS eafly 
RICHMOND, Va. -Michael Vick got a head start on a possible long prison stretch Monday, sur­rendering three weeks before he was to be sentenced for his involvement in a bloody dogfight­ing ring. 
The disgraced Atlanta Falcons quarterback surrendered to U.S. marshals in what his lawyer said was another step in his public repentance. 
"From the beginning, Mr. Vick has accepted responsibility for his actions, and his self-surren­der further demonstrates that acceptance," attorney Billy Martin said in a statement. "Michael wants to again apolo­gize to everyone who has been hurt in this matter, and he thanks all of the people who have offered him and his family prayers and support during this time."

A-Rod wins MVP award, still looking for ring 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK-Alex Hodriguez has millions of dollars in his invnstrmmt accounts, thrnn AL MVP awards for his trophy ease -and zero World Series rings for his fingers. 
"Thorn's definitely a huge hole in the resume. And I moan, it's my third MVP and I'm hrwo to say that I would trade all three for orw world championship. I wouldn't think twiee about it," llodrigunz said. 
Of coursn, a World Series will have to wait. But for now, he has the satisfaction of his latest MVP, won Monday in a romp over Detroit's Magglio Ordonez. 
While A-Hod wouldn't address why he opted out of his old Yankees contract or the reasons for his decision to reverse course and rf1turn to New York, he did slip this into a 30-minute eonference call: Yankees gener­al manager Brian Cashman asked him after the 2006 sea­son, aftf1r he was dropped to eighth in the batting order in the playoff finale against Detroit, whether he'd prefer a trade. 
"I had many, many opportuni­ties," Rodriguez said. ~'There was a lot of interest from a lot of other teams and I felt I didn't want to go anywhere." 
Cashman later confirmed that he approached A-Hod after the 2006 playoff elimination and asked the star third baseman whether he wanted to be trad­ed. Despitn four seasons in New York that filled more tabloid headlines than most players get in a lifetime, Hodriguez wants to stay. If and when he breaks Barry Bonds' eareer home run record, he wants to do it with the Yankees. 
"It's something magical when you go in that field in front of 55,000 people, and then when you make championships and all-time records. I mean, the potential of it is exciting," he said. 
By then, the Yankees will be in their new stadium, one Hodrigucz hopes to put his stamp on. lie admitted playing in the glare of the Big Apple took a long time to get used to. 
"I banged my head against 

New York; New York didn't bang me against the head. I felt like I madn a lot of mistakes," he said. "I was trying to please every­body rather than do what made mn happy." 
!lis new attitude produced his best season and it showed in the MVP race. Hodriguez received 26 first-place votes and 382 points in balloting by the BasPball Writers' Association of America. while Ordonez had two firsts and 258 points. 
Hodriguez won his first MVP in 2003, his last season with the Texas Hangers. He also won with the Yankees in 2005. Those yearly fluctuations bother him. 
"It's something I'm aware of and something that needs to stop," he said. ''I'd much rather have above average every year or great every year or good every year." 
Rodriguez started this year wilh 14 homers in his first 18 games, hit .314 for the season and led the majors with 54 homers, 156 HBis and 143 runs. He was the first player since New York's Roger Maris in 1961 to lead the majors in homers, HBis and runs, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. 
An 11-time All-Star, Rodriguez became the ninth player to win the MVP three or more times. Barry Bonds holds the record with seven -all in the NL ­and Yogi Berra, Roy Campanella, Joe DiMaggio, Jimmie Foxx, Mickey Mantle, Stan Musial and Mike Schmidt won three apiece. 
''I'm expected to do great things, I mean, for a lot of rea­sons, and I understand that," Hodriguez said. 
The only two first-place votes that didn't go to Rodriguez were from Tom Gage of The Detroit News and Jim Hawkins of The Oakland Press in Pontiac, Mich. 
"Magglio is a friend and had an unbelievable season," Rodriguez said. "I've been on that side of the fence many, many times." 
lie remembered back to his first full season in the majors with Seattle, when he finished three points behind Texas' Juan Gonzalez in MVP balloting. 
"I was almost in tears in 1996 when I didn't win the award, and it was very painful," Rodriguez said. "At the time, I was 20 years old and thought I would never get another chance to win it." 


Still, there is the absence of a title. lie's spoken with quarter­back John Elway about the need for one to validate a eareer. 
"Definitely the exclamation point in his career was the two championships at the end, and I have tremnndous faith that I will be a world champion," Rodriguez said. "What better place to do it than in New York?" 
Rodriguez didn't want to talk about his negotiations with the Yankees that are leading toward a $275 million, 10-year con­tract. "There is a finish line in sight," Rodriguez said, adding he would talk about the contract "when the time is right." 

He also wouldn't detail the advice he was given by investor Warren Buffet. 
"We usually visit every year. Warren is a friend,"' Hodriguez said. "He's done a great job of foreseeing things in business. Now he's doing it in baseball, too, so that's pretty good." 
A-Rod struggled in the play­offs again this year as the Yankees lost to Cleveland in the first round. He went 4-for-15 (.267) with one RBI against the Indians, leaving him in an 8-for­59 (.136) postseason funk dating to 2004 and hitless in his past 18 playoff at-bats with runners in scoring position. 
He had talked about his desire to get more postseason at-bats, but that didn't happen. 
"Part of the reason I'm not getting those at-bats is because I'm not performing," he said. 
As soon as Rodriguez arrived at spring training this year, he took a new approach. He finally admitted he no longer was best buddies with Yankees captain Derek Jeter, ending a charade that had gone on for three sea­sons. 
"I thought being honest was the best policy," he said.

we can look back and say, 'Well, geez, if this conversa­tion had gone a little different or this situation had gone a little different, then the out­come would have been differ­ent,"' Glavine said. "Things happen for a reason." 
While he got more and more comfortable with the Mets, he always felt a little strange corning to Turner Field. 
Glavine was drafted and nurtured by the Braves. lie came up with an amazing group of young pitchers that included Smoltz and Steve Avery, helping Atlanta go from worst-to-first in 1991 and all the way to Game 7 of a memorable World Series loss to Minnesota. 
During his 16-year tenure, Glavine had five 20-win sea­sons, captured Cy Young Awards in 1991 and '98, and helped the Braves win the first 11 of their unprecedent­ed 14 straight division titles. He was MVP of their only World Series championship during the run, pitching eight scoreless innings in the decid­ing game of a 1995 victory over Cleveland. 
"No place I ever went to as a visiting player was ever as remotely strange as coming here as a visiting player," Glavine said. 
Which is probably why his wife teared up when he tried on his Braves cap and jersey in the training room before the news conference. 
And that's probably why Wren couldn't stop smiling when Glavine buttoned up his No. 47 jersey with "Braves" written across the front and modeled the red-and-blue hat with an "A" above the bill. 
"Looks good, doesn't it'?" Wren said.

Love leads UCLA to win over Terps 
Associated Press 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -The shots wnren't falling, the ball seemed to sail out of bounds more often than it went in the basket. 
(;ood thing UCLA ean play defensn. 
Kevin Love seored 18 points and grabbed 16 rebounds, help­ing second-ranked UCLA over­come a sloppy first half in a 71­S9 victory over Maryland on Monday night in the semifinals of the CBE Classic. 
UCLA (4-01 had just eight scholarship players in uniform due to injuries to several key players and it showed early with numerous turnovers and bad shots. But the Bruins, led by Love's crisp passing against Maryland's prnss, settled things down by tho second half. 
UCLA shot just 37 percent, including 4-of-13 from 3-point range, but out-rebounded the Tnrrapins 44-29 to move onto the championship game Tunsday night against PithPr No. 10 Michigan State or Missouri, which played later Monday. 
"To win shooting :H percnnt says a lot about our defense," UClA eoaeh Ben llowland said. 
Maryland (:~-I) strugglnd its past two games, ban'lly bPating llarnpton and Northeastern. The Terrapins had nvcn mom prob­lems against UClA. falling into an early hole, thanks to poor shooting and oven worse ball handling, that they never fully recovernd from. 
Maryland had 21 turnovers and was just 1-for-11 on 3­pointers, keeping its streak of at least one 3-pointer alive at 289 games when Eric Hayes con­nected with 28 seconds left. Greivis Vasquez had 18 points and Bambale Osby added 13 for the Terrapins, who had 11 fewer offensive rebounds. 
"They were always getting second shots when they did miss," Maryland coach Gary Williams said. "Rebounding a lot of times is effort, not tech­nique." 
Love had his way the first three games, averaging 20.7 points and 10.3 rebounds, while shooting 65 percent. But that was against the likes of Portland State, Youngstown State and Cal State-San Bernadino. 
The burly 6-foot-1 0 forward didn't have as much luck against the bigger, stronger Terrapins early, forcing up sev­eral shots against double teams without much success. He fig­ured it out quiekly, though, using patience against the bang­ing instead of trying to bull through it. 
Love had 10 rebounds in the first half and hit a 3-pointer before flipping in a quick tip shot at the buzzer to put the Bruins up 28-18. 
lin then hit a couple of tip-ins to start the second half, starting a 15-5 run that put UCLA up 43­23, and later made a crisp pass to break the press, setting up a 3-pointer by Hussell Westbrook to end a brief Maryland run.

Big plays put Broncos in tie atop AFC West 
Associated Press 
DENVEH-Eighty yards here, 62 there, another 4H somewhere else. Nnxt thing they knew, the Dnnver Broncos found thorn­selves in a spot thny only eould have dreamed of a few weeks ago -tied for first place in the AFC West. 
.Jay Cutler threw touchdown passes of 41 and 48 yards and little-known (;ltnn Martinez and Andre llall added to Denver's slnw of big sroring plays Monday night in a :H-20 victory over the Tnnnessnn Titans. 
"It's bnnn a long S(mson, up and down. a little panic in DPnvnr," CutiPr said. "But we pulled it togntlwr. That's two big wins tlw last two weeks." 
Vincn Young threw for a r.arenr high -30H yards -for t.lw second straight W<H~k. but this OIW also resulted in a loss l'or tlw Titans (h-4), who phtynd catchup against D<~nvnr the sanw way tlwy did in a 2H-I :~ loss to .Jaeksonvilln last wenk. 
Martinez. a S(~cond-ynar receivnr signf~d ofT thn praeti(:e squad in Snptmnbnr, returned a punt HO yards to give Dnnvnr a 14-0 load in thn first. 
llall, a first-year player with night carrins this season. turnml his ninth into a 62-yard seorn to hdp thn Broncos regain control of the game after they'd watched a 17 -point lead slip to seven. 
I Jail was in after Selvin Young, who started in place of Travis Henry, went out with a knee injury. 
"lie was our last tailback and Andre took advantage of his opportunity," coach Mike Shanahan said. "We needed a big play at that time and that's one thing about the running ganw. You keep pounding and nvery once in a while, you break one of those." 
The Broncos improved to 5-5, good nnough to tie San Diego for tlw league in the woeful West. 
But suddenly, the Broncos, who have 44-7 and 41-3 losses on tlwir wildly disparate score­card this year, are playing like real eontendcrs. They piled up :{59 yards against the Titans, who were missing Albert llayrwsworth on the defensive linn but nonetheless came in with the sneond-ranked defense in tlw league. 
Not that the Broncos are per­feet, or anywhere near New England level. 
Martinez also muiTed a punt that led to a Tennessee touch­down late in the third 
That touchdown, a 4-yard run by Young, eame aftnr the second of two ill-advised timeouts called by Denver. 
Broncos linebacker Nate Webster called a timeout just before the snap on third-and­goal from the 1, a play in which Young was held out of the end zone as he reached for the pylon. 
But the timeout gave Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher a chance to review the previous play, in which Young scored on a similar play but had been ruled out of bounds at the 1. 
At the end of the first half, Shanahan, trying to duplicate the move that helped him foil Sebastian Janikowski's game­winning attempt against Oakland several wonks ago, called timeout a split second before Hob Bironas tried a 56­yarder before halftime. 
Bironas' kick sailed about 20 yards wide of the goalpost, but given another chance, he nailed it to trim Tennessee' deficit to 20-10. 
"Don't anybody every question me about those field goals and timeouts again," said Shanahan, who started a trend with that timeout against Oakland. "I told you this would happen sooner or later. You live by the sword and die by the sword." 
And really, this one wasn't so much about field goals as big plays fi1r the Broncos. · 
A team that had only one 


tolli.:hdown of 20 yards or more all season on offense got its sec­ond early, when Cutler found Brandon Stokley in the middle of the field and Stokley outran the Titans defense for a 48-yard score. 
On tho first drive of the third quarter, Cutler found Brandon Marshall in single coverage on Calvin Lowrey, who went for the ball and missed, allowing Marshall to seorn from 41 yards for a 27-10 lead.

Smith picks up fourth career shutout in Dallas victory 
Associated Press 
DALLAS -This time, the Dallas Stars didn't just protect a third-period lead. They expand­edit. 
Steve Ott scored a rare goal, and Mike Smith stopped 22 shots for his fourth career shutout to send the Stars to a 3­0 vietory over the Los Angeles Kings on Monday night. 
In their last meeting on Nov. 10, the Stars gave away a 4-0 third-pt~riod lead and lost to the Kings in owrtinw 6-5. 
Three days later, owner Tom llieks initiated a front-off'ice shah-up that induded the fir­ing of general manager Doug Armstrong, and since then the Stars are 2-0-l. 
Dallas hadn't forgotten the wasted opportunity against the Kings, and Niklas Jlagman and Jere Lf~htinen scored in the third period to exttmd tlw Stars' lead to 3-0. 
"It didn't twen need to be nwntioned." Ott said. "It was still in the back of all of our minds. We rnnwmbernd it and wanted to have a big game against them." 
Ott, known morn as a checker and instigator than for his goal­sr:oring, notched his 12th in 214 earner games late in thn seeond period to put Dallas in front, and the Stars went on to beat the Kings in Dallas for the IOth straight time. 
llagman added his team-high ninth goal on a breakaway at 
J:U 0 of the third, and Lehtirwn sr:ored his sixth on a power play 
2:14 later to giw Dallas a 3-0 advantage. 
"It was good to play the way we did in thn third, especially re11wmbnring what happened last ga11w against these guys," llagman said. 
The Stars got off to a slow start before pieking up the pace in the second period, following up on Friday night's 6-1 win over the Colorado Avalanche, Dallas' most complete perform­ance of the season. 
Smith, Dallas' backup goalie, was making his second straight start for the Stars in place of Marty Turco. Smith's strong effort in the victory over Colorado earned him another start and he got his first shutout of' the season. 
Coaeh Dave Tippett said he 
wouldn't decide on his starting goalie for Wednesday night's game against Anaheim until the pregame skate that morning. 
"We need both guys to be very good to be successful," Tippett said. "(Smith) has done what he's supposed to do. That gives you stability." 
Smith came up with a big stop on former Stars forward Ladislav Nagy's backhand from the slot at 11:38 of the final period to preserve the shutout. 
Before these back-to-back starts, Smith had gone five 

games without playing, making it difficult to stay sharp. 
''I'm going to enjoy this while I have it," Smith said. ''I'm just going with the flow right now. The coach wants to keep (who starts) a secret as much as he can." 
Jason LaBarbera had 23 saves for the Kings, 0-3-1 in their last four games. 
Behind by only one goal at the start of the third period, the Kings felt good about their chances for a comeback. 
"But we can't rely on that all the time," Los Angeles' Anze Kopitar said. "It was a one-goal game so we were back in it with one shot. But we can't give up two more goals like that and expect to win." 
The Stars opened the scoring on Ott's deflection of Loui Eriksson's shot at 18:37 that went through the pads of LaBarbera. It was Ott's second goal of the season. 
"I got a one-handed little deflection and put it on the net," Ott said. "It wasn't a planned play. I just redirected it."

Belles look to find consistency against Ravens 
Kessler leads young team with 16 points per game this season 
By MEAGHAN VESELIK Sports Writer 
Arter bringing in their first victory of the year against Aurora University on Saturday, Saint Mary's faces Anderson University tonight at 7 p.m. 
The Belles lost 75-56 in their season opener to Wheaton College on Friday in the Lee Pfund Invitational at Wheaton, but rebounded with an 83-47 win against Aurora. 
"We are excited to have the season underway. Anderson will be a good challenge for us on Tuesday," Belles coach Jennifer Henley said. "We did not play as well as we could have against Wheaton College. Our second-half defense was terrible. This team bounced back the next day and did a much better job with Aurora." 
The Belles, with 77 rebounds in their first two games, are in a bit of a rebuilding phase. Star guard Bridget Lipke grad­uated in May, though all-MIAA shooting guard Alison Kessler is poised to take over some of Lipke's responsibilities. 
Kessler has gracefully stepped into Lipke's shoes in terms of team leadership, on the court and with her stats. She leads the team with 16 points per game and is tied for fourth in rebounds with junior Katie Rashid. She is closely fol­lowed in points by junior Erin Newsom, who has 15 per game. Newsom leads the team in rebounds with a total of nine. 
As Saint Mary's prepares to take on Anderson, Henley has a few improvements she would like to see on the court. 
"We still need to establish a stronger inside game," Henley said. "We need to have more control on the boards and con­tinue improving our free-throw percentage." 
Henley expects Anderson to make the Belles work tonight. The Havens will be looking for revenge after a three-point loss last season to the Belles. Kessler sunk a free throw and Newsom hit a lay-up to pull out the last minute victory. 
"Anderson is going to be very physical and have a lot of hard denial defense," Henley said. "They are a solid team.:·

The Irish fell to Baylor 68-64 in the semifinals of tbe tournament Sunday. 
Like in their loss to the Bears, Notre Dame (2-2) led much of the game Monday night ­including the entire second half until Causey's fall-away three­pointer. Georgia Tech (3-2) used a 12-3 run over the last 2:30 to erase an eight-point deficit and come away with the win. 
The Yellow Jackets made four straight 3-point attempts during that span, with Causey making two and junior guard Lewis Clinch draining the other two. 
For the night, Georgia Tech was 1 0-of-17 from behind the arc and just 17 -of-42 from inside it. 
Clinch, senior forward Jeremis Smith and senior guard Anthony Morrow led the Yellow Jackets with 12 points each. Causey added 11.

The coach also said that one reason her squad hasn't gotten many looks is because the teams they have played this season have played a lot of man-to-man defense against the Irish. McGraw added that she doesn't expect to change her offen­sive philosophy considerably, because pull-up jumpers are working best for Notre Dame this season. 
The Chippewas have spread the ball around on offense this season. Their leading scorer so far is guard Angel Chan (12 .0 points per game), while guards Latisha Luckett 
(11.3) and Shonda Long (9.7) are not far behind. 
Even though Central Michigan does not have any post players as tall as Notre Dame's duo of 6-foot-3 Erica Williamson and 6-foot-5 Melissa D'Amico, it has five 6-footers on the roster, which could create matchup problems for the Irish.

"It's nice to play for some­thing," he said. "It's kind of like a practice to play at Joe Louis Arena or the NCAA Tournament. It's just two different opponents in a short period of time, so we have to be able to make quick adjustments." 
The Irish will face an all-too­familiar foe in the first game of the HPI tournament -Alabama­Huntsville. The Chargers and the Irish !ought each other in a double-overtime marathon in the first round of last year's NCAA Tournament that the Irish eventually won 3-2. 
Alabama-Huntsville entered the NCAA matchup with a 13­19-3 season record and had only made the Tournament by win­ning the College Hockey America playoffs. Notre Dame then had to play the next night against Miehigan State, losing 2­1 to the eventual national eham­pions. 
"We were definitely gassed after playing Alabama," Van Guilder said. "They gave us everything we could handle. I've tried to forget about that whole weekend, but we're detinitely not going to look past them at all this year." 
Depending upon the outcome of the first game, Notre Dame will play either RPI or American International in the weekend tournament's final game. Between the tournament, the mid-week game against Bowling Green and last weekend's series with Western Michigan, the Irish will have played Live games in nine days. 
"I don't think the conditioning is a problem," Van Guilder said of handling the heavy workload. "I think its more locus with hav­ing elasses and everything. Focus is more of a problem, not so much conditioning."

"Both teams had some play­ers missing back then and there have been some lineup changes," Waldrum said. 
The Irish know they have a challenge ahead of them, especially having to travel down the unfriendly tobaeco road, but more than two­thirds of their lineup is made up of veterans of the team 
that made a run to the nation­al title game last season. 
And, after going undefeated in Big East regular season play, they feel they are good enough to beat anyone in the country. 
"You have to beat good teams along the way to win the national championship. so we just take them as they come," Waldrum said. 
The Irish face the Tar lleels at 12 p.m. Saturday at North Carolina's Fetzer Field.

Squad looks to rebound from NIT loss to Terps 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Associate Sports Ediwr 
After falling to No. 3 Maryland in the third round of' the Women's Preseason NIT, No. 23 Notre Dame will start its regular season with a road game against Central Michigan tonight at 7. 
McGraw said that her team made some crucial mistakes. that cost the team in the 7 5­59 loss -things that have to be corrected before the game against the Chippewas. 
"Just one person does some­thing wrong and it affects the whole team, so we have to be more disciplined," she said. 
One of the highlights in the loss at College Park, Md., was the team's turnovor margin. The Irish committed only throe turnovers during the contest and Maryland had no steals -both Notre Dame records. On the other end of the court, the Irish forced Maryland to 1X turnovers, two shy of McGraw's goal of 20 for every game. 
McGraw said that one rca­son for the stark turnover dif­ferential was Notre Damn's refusal to force the ball inside as often as Maryland did. 
One bright spot after three games this season has been thH play of freshman center Devereaux Peters. Peters had 12 points and six rebounds in
