Czech premier pledges end to communist domination 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Presi­dent Bush sought to reassure European allies Tuesday about his summit with Soviet Presi­dent Mikhail Gorbachev, promising 'Tm not going to surprise them" with any agreement to cut nuclear weapons or reduce U.S. troops overseas. 
Bush said he and Gorbachev may discuss possible military cutbacks "in a general way" when they meet off the coast of Malta on Saturday and Sunday. 
But he added, "In writing, I have made clear to Mr. Gor­bachev-in my handwriting, so he knows it comes from me, not the bureaucracy -that this is not a summit for arms control agreement." 
Meanwhile, budget con­straints at home are forcing cuts in the U.S. armed services -whatever troop withdrawals are negotiated with the War­saw Pact. As of Nov. 1, there were 2.13 million men and women in the armed services. 
The services have drafted plans for a reduction of 275,000, with about 135,000 to be trimmed from the Army, 100,000 from the Air Force and 40,000 from the Navy and Marines, defense sources told

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) -The premier pledged to in­clude non-Communists in a new government, and new Commu­nist Party chief Karel Urbanek said Tuesday the party would give up its constitutional monopoly on power. 
Premi-er Ladislav Adamec made his pledge in a meeting with the opposition Civic Forum movement after 11 days of un­pn~cedented protest. Millions of workers observed a two~hour general strike Monday, but the streets were quiet Tuesday be­cause the Civic Forum asked for calm. 
After the meeting, govern­ment minister Marian Calfa said Adamec would submit a coalition government to Presi­dent Gustav Husak by Sunday and would ask Parliament, which meets Wednesday, to delete the guarantee of a forces. 
Bush said it was very impor­tant for the allies to know ''I'm not going to go off and prema­turely jump out there and try to grandstand by committing them to something. That's not the way you keep an alliance strong." 
After the two-day summit, Bush will fly to Brussels on Dec. 4 to brief NATO leaders on the discussions. 
The allies were aghast to learn in 1987 that then-Presi­dent Reagan and Gorbachev had come close to a deal at a summit in Reykjavik to abolish all nuclear weapons in spite of the fact that NATO regards some of those arms as vital to deter Soviet attack. 
Now, with the collapse of hard-line communist regimes in Eastern Europe, and massive budget deficits in the United States, the Bush administration is considering major cutbacks in troops and weapons. 
Gorbachev is facing similar pressures at home.

Hours later, party chief Karel Urbanek told 3,500 party ac­tivists in Prague the "future of the party requires giving up the monopoly of power," the offi­cial news agency CTK reported. 
Urbanek. elected Friday in a major reorganization of the party leadership, said Saturday he favored a broad-based coali­tion government. 
Central Committee spokesman Josef Hora said Urbanek would visit Moscow after the U.S.-Soviet summit off Malta this weekend. 
Civic Forum spokesman Jiri Kanturek appeared on state television's evening news with a 10-point statement outlining concessions made and further opposition demands. 
Two demands were for free elections and the resignation by Dec. 10 of Husak, a central fig­ure in the crackdown on reform after the Soviet-led invasion of August 1968. 
At a news conference, promi­nent dissident Jiri Dienstbier read a letter saying Husak's resignation "would calm the si­tuation."

WASHINGTON (APJ -Presi­dent Bush on Tuesday signed a bill authorizing $938 million in 
U.S. aid over three years to Poland and Hungary, saying the political reforms there have "stirred the imagination of the world." 
Bush signed the legislation as he prepared to send off to Poland a presidential delega­tion whose leaders cautioned that Poles and other Eastern Europeans may be in for some hard winters before economic changes can catch up with po­litical reform. 
"We must be careful that economic expectations do not become unrealistic. In the kind of emotional environment that exists today. that can very readily occur," said Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who heads the mission of govern­ment, business, labor and other leaders for a four-day visit. 
Yeutter said he was carrying with him to Poland an addi­tiona! $20 million installment in 
U.S. food aid. 
The legislation, providing more aid to the two East bloc nations than Bush had re­quested, includes programs for Poland with a value of $846.5 million. Hungary would receive benefits with a total value of $91.5 million. 
Bush in a statement called the measure "a major and positive step in bipartisan foreign pol­icy." 
"We are nearing the end of a year that future generations will remember as a watershed, a year when the human spirit was lifted and spurred on by the bold and courageous ac­tions of two great peoples, the people of Poland and Hungary," Bush said. 
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole promised help in retrain­ing displaced Polish workers. And Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said he would plumb trade and invest­ment opportunities. 
Yeutter and his colleagues were pessimistic on short-term prospects for improved condi­tions either in Poland or in its fast-changing East bloc neigh­bors. 
"Economic reform is not an overnight proposition. It will take time. It would be tragic indeed if all the magnificent emotion of the moment is channeled into frustration," Yeutter told a White House news briefing. 
Mrs. Dole, who with her hus­band Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole visited Poland last August, predicted a period of "some pain" as Poland move'S from a state-owned economy to a market economy. 
"There'll be a loss of jobs for some people. Also, as subsidies are removed from certain ar­eas, there will be an increase in prices," the labor secretary said.

NO-Hurricane 
series brings 
out fans' worst 
Some football rivalries seem to bring out the worst in people. Fans aren't satisfied to watch the game. They hurl insults at the oppo­nent's fans. This is especially true in the Orange Bowl. 
Miami is not a friendly place to be if --------­you're a Notre Dame fan and the Irish are playing the Hurricanes. The Orange Bowl crowd can be downright hostile -and it was Saturday. 
Some Hurricane fans were more than rude; they were abusive. Several dozen took the trouble to come to a section of Notre Dame supporters to yell obscenities. Others just shouted from their seats. 
There is a diiTerence between supporting one's team and berating the opponent. Cheers need not refer to the mother of someone in the neighboring section. 
Fans of the Fighting Irish aren't always exemplary. The anti-Hurricane T-shirts that appeared before last year's Miami game were classless. Billing the game as "Catholics vs. Convicts" is not right. Neither are the four-letter replies Miami students had on their shirts. Both sides have shown a lack of class in this series. 
The hatred is so strong that a record crowd of 81,634 packed the Orange Bowl to see the game. There is no lost love between these teams -or their fans. 
Chris Rings, sports editor of the Miami Hurricane, told The Observer that the Orange Bowl isn't usually so jammed. "No one ever gets this wild for other games. It's just that everyone hates Notre Dame." 
Before the game, a tailgating Miami fan called my attention to a roast pig wearing an N.D. cap. The fan said, "Look what we did to your coach. We fried his a-!" 
Farther down the block, two middle-aged 
women cussed me out when they saw my 
Notre Dame shirt. Other Hurricane fans 
and their children uttered boos and more 
forceful disapprovals. 
After the game, a drunk Miami fan went 
down to field level to yell obscenities at Irish 
Quarterback Tony Hice. The obviously spir­
ited 'Canes fan spewed forth more than 
words, on fans from both sides. 
The Hurricanes got their so-called revenge. Next year, it's our turn. Fortunately, the series won't resume until at least 2004. But the hatred will remain. Irish fans don't forget defeat easily; that's what started this grudge series in the first place. 
Notre Dame hosts the 'Canes and their 
fans on Oct. 20, 1990. While nobody expects 
N.D. to roll out _a red carpet, Irish fans should have the class not to return rudeness with discourtesy. 
Miami fans, meanwhile, face a dilemma: the Hurricanes can't win the national championship this season unless Notre Dame beats Colorado in the Orange Bowl. Now that's something to cheer for.

When President Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev phone home from their Malta summit this weekend, electronic spies nearby will record the transmissions and save them for years in hope of one day cracking the codes. No matter how friendly their relations, both leaders will bring their best eavesdroppers, electronic equipment, encoding machines and countermeasure experts to the Mediterranean rendezvous, according to knowledgeable officials and observers. 
Taking liver segments from healthy adult~ ~nd putting them into dying children can ease a cnhcal shortage but the gains cannot be justified if they come at the donors' expense, surgeons said Tuesday. "The major thing is what's the risk to the donor," said Dr. Barry Kahan, president of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons and director of transpl.antation at the University of Texas at Houston, who was moni­toring the nation's first living-donor liver transplant. 
The Vatican on Tuesday suggested establishing permanent ties with the Kremlin on the eve of the first visit by a Soviet leader. President Mikhail Gorbachev arrives Wednesday for a state visit before meeting with Pope John Paul II on Friday and then flying on to Malta for his summit meeting with President Bush. 
The Lebanese government firnd Michel Aoun as army commander Tuesday, and the Syrians sent more troops and tanks for a possible showdown with the stubborn Christian general who has tried to drive them out of Lebanon. Aoun docs not recognize new President Elias llrawi, a Maronite Catholic like himself. and has refused to leave the shell-battered presidential palace at Baabda, east of Beirut. Syria, which had 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon before the reinforcements, supports Hrawi.

ND to host conference on coping with divorce/death 
The idea for a conference to help participants deal with loss and its possibilities was initi­ated two years ago, Sullivan said. The initial conference dealt largely with problems as­sociated with death, but some participants came to conquer the loss felt by divorce, she said. 
Pat Heynolds, a counselor and Saint Mary's graduate, initiated the program two years ago. This year, shn is a presenter fo­cusing on the death of a loved one. 
In conjunction with the Year of the Family, the program was revamped to focus on divorce as a more prominent form of loss. The program was also de­signed to "encompass all mem­bers of the family," Sullivan said, by targeting students, faculty, staff, alumni, and community residents as poten­tial participants. 
The second presenter is ND graduate Jim Faught, a lawyer who specializes in divorce and the family. He is the assistant dean at Loyola School of Law, and was divoreed in 1982. 
Sister Jean Lenz will serve as a faeilitator during the eonfer­enee. Lenz, assistant vice presi­dent for Student Affairs, "will offer guidance" to help partici­pants reaeh their goals, Sulli­van said. 
The Notre Dame Alumni As­soeiation/Alumni Continuing Education is sponsoring the conference along with the Cen­ter for Continuing Education and the Year of the Family. This has helped defray the cost, which is $25 for students.

ND receives equipment for study of cosmic rays of star Cygnus X3 
By SANDRA WIEGAND News Writer 
Equipment recently installed north of the University may cause a breakthrough in the study of cosmic rays, according to John Poirier, professor of physics at Notre Dame. 
The machinery will collect in­formation about the cosmic rays of the star Cygnus X3, which is located about 37,000 light years away from earth. 
Cosmic rays are "rays of high-energy elementary parti­cles which reach the earth from outer space" said a press re­lease about the study. 
Scientists believe these rays are gamma rays because they travel in a straight path from the star to the earth, and are not bent by magnetic fields in space, the release said. 
According to an article in the September issue of Discover magazine, the magnetic field of Cygnus X-3 "generates a pow-

erful electric field that fires cosmic ray protons into space." 
Some protons eollide with gas nuclei near the double star, generating gamma rays that shoot straight to earth. The showers... point straight to the source, like showers triggered by gamma rays, but they con­tain a lot of muons, like show­ers triggered by protons, ac­cording to the Discovery article. 
The presence of a great num­ber of muons, evident through recent experimental data, has presented questions about the rays. 
"It may mean that the laws of physics operate somewhat dif­ferently at very high energies," said Poirier in the press re­lease, "or there is the possibility that the radiation from Cygnus contains an exotic new, uncharged particle we haven't yet discovered." 
Poirier's interest in the mys­tery spawned Project GRAND (Gamma Ray Astrophysics at

THE ROOF IS ON 
Notre Dame). 

GRAND is behind the installa­tion of research equipment near Notre Dame which will "record the tracks of cosmic rays with a very high resolution of angle ... and trace the paths of muons as well." according to the release. 
The equipment consists of "stacked... flat chambers filled with argon gas and a grid of very fine wires." 
Poirier said construction of the equipment began about two years ago, and was completed and receiving its first data two weeks ago. He said preliminary results would be used primarily to prove that the machine was working. 
Poirier hopes to have the field of about 100 yards square filled with chambers within two years. He predicted that solid conclusions from the data will come one to two years after the full field of equipment is in­stalled. 
"I think that this mystery is a really big thing," said Poirier, "that its resolution will have a great impact on astrophysics."

"Now if we want to talk in a 

general way with the Soviet 
leaders about our aspirations 
for how a defense system will 
look 10 years from now, of 
course, we'II do that, we want

In particular. Bush said, he

"But that's not what I'm re­

ferring to when I talk about

two to make a deal." 
Separately, the State De­

Moreover. Bush said, it should be the people of Eastern Europe who lead the way to­ward change. "It doesn't come from somPbody halfway across tlw world dictating how fast change should be or what change should encompass." 
Bush also promised that he would press Gorbachev at the summit over the behavior of Moscow's CPntral American al­lies -Cuba and Nicaragua, which the United States accuses of shipping Soviet-made weapons to leftist insurgents.

Toppled crane kills 5, injures 21 in San Fran. Class 
SAN FHANCISCO (AP) -A crane tipped over and plummeted from the 16th story of a building under construc­tion Tuesday, flattening a school van, crushing several ears and smashing into an of­fice building across the street. At least five people were killed, 21 injured and five left missing, authorities said. 
Concrete and twisted steel rained on one of the busiest in­tersections in the financial dis­trict. 
Then~ were conflicting state­ments on what was happening bdore tlw crane fell. rire Chief Fred Postel said it was hoisting steel beams, but the general contractor said the crane was being repositioned from the 16th to the 20th floors. 
"It felt like an earthquake," said Merrill Lynch Viee Presi­dent Joe McLaughlin, who was in the damaged office building. "I looked out and saw two bod­ies. One construction worker's boots wcrn sticking up through a mass of jagged metal." 
A piece of the crane at least three stories long dangled from the side of the building under construction two hours after the 8::Hl a.m. accident. Police roped ofT the area and ambu­lanef~S rushed in and out.

The street was littered with flattened ears and a mangled motorcycle. Gas was cut off to the damaged 21-story office building for fear of an explo­sion. 
"The wreckage looks abso­lutely incredible -steel beams look like pickup sticks," said Acting Mayor Angela Alioto, sitting in while Mayor Art Ag­nos tours the country urging tourists to return in the wake of the Oct. 17 earthquake. 
At an afternoon news confer­ence at the scene, Alioto said experts could not immediately determine the cause of the col­lapse. She also said streets in a four-square-block area would

be closed for at least a week for cleanup and repairs, and the California Street cable car also was shut down. 
Alioto said the dead were four construction workers, all from the Seattle area, and the woman driving the school van, operated by Laidlaw Transit Inc. 
"It's pretty rough," said Laidlaw Senior Vice President Howard Wallack. "They (other employees) are pretty upset, and we are arranging a chap­lain and psychologist to go over to our offices."

Three hospitals reported re­ceiving 21 victims, four in seri­ous condition. Most of the rest had minor injuries. 
Swinerton & Walberg Co. of San Francisco, the general con­tractor on the job, said the crane was being repositioned from the 16th story to the 20th story, the second such reposi­tioning of the project. 
The crane, model No. SN355 manufactured by American Pecco of Millwood, N.Y., had a capacity of 17 tons. The site was last inspected by the state Occupational Safety and Health Administration on Aug. 11. The project, which began in Jan­uary, has not been cited for safety violations, the company said in a news release. 
Debris rained down on a taxi driven by Issa Massarweh, who had two passengers at the time. The cab's back window was smashed. 
"I don't know where my pas­sengers are," he said. "I threw myself under the dashboard." He told his passengers to duck and when he next looked, they had left. He was unharmed. 
"I heard a loud bang and stepped up and saw the tail end of a crane," said stockbroker Don Trabert.

/Jear Hditor: 
This is in response to Mr. 
Dave Bruner's article "Socialist 
States Leaving People Alone for 
Good" published in The 
Observer's Inside Column on 
Nov. 14. 
I would agnw with Mr. 
Bruner that, of late, 
Communism has been dearly 
proved to be an utter failure. 
As I havn lived under a Marxist­
Lnninist government in Ethiopia 
for six long years, I know how 
eomcive, cruel, inhuman and 
absurd communist rule is. 
llowever, I would not just write-off the concept of social­ism; for me, it means "welfare for all" or "everyone matters." Tlw Communists abused the word "socialism" to such a gnmt extent by all their so­called 'scientific socialism' rhetoric that we have grown avnrse to this meaningful no­tion. Buddha, Jesus and Gandhi were all real socialists. 
I 
I would strongly disagree with Mr. Bruner over his very high enthusiasm about Capitalism. Freedom and lib­erty are the birth rights of hu­man beings, and whenever they are denied or threatened, hu­mankind has struggled to at­tain and preserve them. It is the human soul-force which was instrumental in that struggle and success, not any political or economic ideology. A won­
derful example is the recent spontaneous happenings in East Germany. 
If democratic capitalism has given all the freedom and lib­l)rty to the people, what is the reason why 35 million U.S. citi­zens are poor, why 58 percent of the people in this country feel powerless and alienated, why the U.S. citizens' cry for peace in Central and Latin America has always gone ig-
DOONESBURY 
nored by the government. I hear that 83 percent of the riches and resources of this country are enjoyed by 10 per­cent of the population and that the remaining 90 percent of Amerieans "democratically" share the 17 percent left over. The rich get richer. and the poor get poorer. Is this the freedom and liberty in demo­cratic capitalism? 
In my view, both communism and capitalism are equally bad and monstrous. Power is the end in both the systems; inhu­man coercion is the means in the former, and pitiless ex­ploitation in the latter. Foree is the instrument there and money, here. That system is based on physical violence, and this on structural violence. There, a group of Central Committee members are the de­cision-makers. and here, the rich capitalists. In both sys­tmns, "All are equal. but some are more equal." Retaining the power and protecting the intnr­ests of the "some" are · the bases of the respective systems. 
Socialism (I mean, Gandhian and Vivekanandite) is the only way out, at least for Indians. We, Gandhian socialists, do not tolerate any attempt by anyone to curb our personal freedom and liberty. We do identify the class divisions among the peo­' ple, but we do not want to kill the capitalists or anyone else. We want to remove the element of exploitation in the capitalis­tic endeavors through mutual understanding, goodwill, nego­tiation and non-violent means. We do not envy his wealth or sabotage his properties, but ask for a better deal for our honest and sincere work through loving ways and non­violent means. The capitalist invests money, and the workers 
invest their energy, and we 
want a just deal for both. No 
master-slave relationships 
would be tolerated; they. to­
gether. serve the people and 
make their living at the same 
time. And we strongly believe in 
God. 
Even when the private sector 
is encouraged to pursue its own 
interests, and the right to 
property is respected, essential 
sectors of the economy. like the 
natural resources of the coun­
try. transportation, etc., would 
not be put at the mercy of indi­
vidual rich capitalists. Every 
citizen has equal rights and en­
titlements to these things. So. 
an individual's basic wealth and 
riches remain there, well-pro­
tected and maintained through 
democratic institutions. An in­
dividual's own personal or fa­
milial growth is left open for 
his initiatives and efforts. 
Because of these measures, 
people are certainly motivated 
and competition is kept healthy. 
A certain amount of centraliza­
tion is obviously needed. 
Absorbing the best elements of both communism and capi­talism, we strike a healthy compromise in the form of a mixed-economy. This experi­ence has proved to be a suc­cess in India, despite shortcom­ings like an enormous popula­tion, underdevelopment, the huge diversity of people, illiter­acy, a lack of resources, cor­rupt politicians, an inefficient bureaucracy, etc. 
Our world is entering a fan­tastic phase of change. The age-old evils like communism, colonialism. racism and the like are fast giving way to reason, justice, truth and soul-force. Capitalism has to follow suit.

Dear Hditor: 
Today I would like to tell you about a subject that is very near and dear to me. And that is. what it is like to have a nine­teen year old brother for a roommate. My brother Paul goes to the University of Notre Dame in the United States. lie comes to live with us for three months every year when his school has an end of the year break. So for ninn months I have the bedroom to myself and, for thn~e months, I have to share it with Paul. 
For most boys at Glen­dalough Junior School, the day starts with the alarm going off at about 7 a.m. My day starts at about 2 a.m. when Paul comes home after an evening out with his "mates." lie trips over the dirty laundry he has left molding on the floor and crashes to the carpet. This event wakens me. After thrash­ing about in his bed, he falls asleep-and that's when the ac­tion really starts. 
You see, my brother snores. Not your average snores. but the kind that could blow the door shut. If that's not bad enough, my brother also talks in complete sentences at the top of his voice while he is sound asleep. One night he sat up in bed and yelled "SOME DOGS ARE BIGGER THAN OTHERS!" and then laid back down again. Now, what am I supposed to do? Agree with him? Ignore 
him? Or. throw sonwthing at him! 
ThPrP are sonw nights wlwn I'd like to leap out of bPd and start playing my drums to giv<' him a tasll~ of his own rm~didne. but he's bigger than me and would probably beat ml' to a pulp. So I just lay thPrP quif~tly-hoping I 1~an fall aslePp befom too long. Sonwtimes Paul speaks in Latin and otlwr times he says thosP four l1~tter words that Mom hoped lw would never us1~. It is a pity that he doesn't speak Frnneh b11cause that might help me pass my foreign language dass. 
BPforn long it is 7 a.m.. and both my brotlwr and I get up. Paul goes to work. and I go to school. I skip taking a shower because he uses up all the hot water. 
People often ask me if I miss my brother sinee we moved to Australia... I guess I do, but there are times when he is here that I wish he was back at Notre Dame-talking away in the middle of the night and bothering his university room­mates, while I enjoy a docent night's sleep.

Above left: From left to right, senior Kevin Yaley works with sophomores Keith Cavanaugh and Kevin Roxas to help build shleves, just one of their many tasks during their week in Appalachia. Above: Sophomore Ben Kelly helps to clean up the area by burning doors, windows and other junk collected around Cranks Creek. 
"Are you sure you can handle it?" "You might not take a shower for a wer~k." "YOU???" 
These were some of the reac­tions of many of my fellow stu­dents when they heard about my Octobnr break plans. Be­tween the USC game and the Pitt game, I worked for a week in Appalachia. 
My friends were surprised, shocked. and most demanded pictures-they wanted proof of my manual work experience. The fact is, everyone thought of me as an atypical participant for service at the Cranks Creek Survival Center in Harlem, Ken­tucky. Even I thought my break plans were a bit out of my character. However, upon my return, I decided that every sin­gle individual can be a typical participant in the Appalchia program. All you need is the drive to give service a try. 
Our week began at 7:50a.m. 
Sunday, October 25. All the groups loaded into their cus­tom designed vans that had been rented from Basney Ford Honda. My group stood at the Center for Social Concerns staring at a rusted, old, light blue van covered with snow and dripping with icicles. "The Big Blue Bomber," as we affection­ately nicknamed her, was ours for the week, though no one thought she would last. Any­way, we claimed her, we loaded her up, and she led us straight to Cranks Creek. 
The quintessential element which created the positive Ap­palchia experience was our group as a whole. We began getting to know each other in­side Big Blue while playing car games and singing road tunes. Our initial bonding (the term here refers to the process of building friendships) began in the car and it continued throughout the week. The group consisted of sixteen se­niors, one junior, and three sophomores, but we all treated each other as equals. No single individual did all of the cooking and cleaning. We worked as a team and bonded as one unit. 
The highlights of the week in­cluded the Fundamentalist Chuirch revival, our dance, the Thursday night bonfire (complete with late night snipe hunt), the ceremonial raising of the shelves, the completion of the white picket fence, and the repainting of Opel's house from dingy grey to white with a pink trim. 
Monday night we were invited to attend religious services at the nearby church. Wednesday night we found the Driftwood, a local establishment, which offered to hold our dance. And finally, on Thursday night our bonding experience soldified around the campfire while we told riddles and ate smores. 
Despite all the social activity, we did find time to work. The completion of our projects proved to be the most memo­rable events. Unfortunately we did not have enough time or skill to rebuild the bridge lead­ing to the survival center, but we did clean up the center's yard, paint their barn, install shelves, and build them a fence. In addition, we helped the community by sorting clothes and repainting a local resi­dent's home. 
Thinking back on the week I spent in Appalachia I would not hesitate to say that it was one of the most rewarding weeks of my life. Our group did not move mountains, but we were intro­duced to the problems which face the Appalachians daily. Waste disposal, contaminated water, and a lack of education appeared to be the top three problems facing these people. An awareness of these prob­lems and our small contribu­tions will provide resolutions to this ongoing crisis, but we can­not get frustrated. If we do, no resolutions, no matter how small, will take place. 
I sat in the front seat of Big Blue on the way back to Notre Dame with a good friend of mine. He and I were discussing the week and we almost agreed that the University should make a service project mandatory for all undergraduates. But think­ing it over, we decided that forcing an individual to do work for his or her community is wrong. The desire to serve comes purely from the individ­ual. Obviously, my desire shocked the people I knew. De­spite everyone's apprehensions, including my own, the week proved to be rewarding because of our accomplishments and because of the people in my group. The two combined to make my week in Appalachia a very positive experience and one which I would encourage every student to particpate in at least once before graduat­ing. 

Do's and don'ts for the airborne passenger 
Well, another vacation has come and gone, and for many of us, this means that we once again were allowed to experience the joy of flight. Commercial aviation is truly one of the wonders of our modern age. But it's also an 
lan Mitchell

easy target for ridicule and derision, so let's not waste any time. Clip 'n' Save for your next visit to the friendly skies -­Lion Taming's guide to airline flights: 
Things you don't want to hear from the cockpit: 
1) "Oops." 
2) Shortly after takeoff, the pilot comes on the PA system, screams "Whooee, let's see what this baby can do!" and proceeds to take the plane into a series of barrel rolls. 
3) "Uh, good evening ladies and gentlemen; this is your captain speaking. Has anyone on board the aircraft flown this route before, and if so, do you remember which way we turn after the third big mountain?" 
4) "Hey, what do you say we throw out the itinerary and take this baby to Bermuda?" 
5) "Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your first officer speaking. Umm ... by the way, has anyone seen the captain?" 
6) "All right everybody, outta your seats! It's polka time!" 
7) "Although we don't have an inflight movie for your enjoyment, the co-pilot and I would like to perform a few musical numbers from the world of country western; sing along, y'all..." 
Things to say after pushing the call button: 
1) "Just testing." 
2) "Hi, I'll be your passenger in the main cabin today, and if there's anything I need during the flight, I won't hesistate to call on you." 
3) Pretend not to understand the safety instructions: "Excuse me, but you were going a little too fast for me just now. Do I insert the silver buckle into the metal tongue or is it the other way around?" 
'Clip 'n' Save for your next visit to the friendly skies... ' 
4) Whatever you say, push the call button early and often; that's what it's there for, right? 
More fun things to do: 

During the boarding process, when they announce the pre­board for children, senior citizens, and all those passengers needing a little extra time boarding the aircraft, get up, run to the door and explain in a loud voice that you are extremely stupid and need the extra time to find your seat. Once you get on board the aircraft, you get to play the mystery game "who am I sitting next to?" Did you luck out and find the man/woman of your dreams? Or, wait a minute, isn't that your seat next to the inebriated, chain-smoking, fat woman with the screaming baby? 
Now, there are two kinds of people in the world: those who enjoy talking for several hours non-stop to total strangers on a plane and those who are sane. If you're seated next to those who hate conversation, try an icebreaker like "You're probably wondering about my life story ... " or "Man, I didn't think that cop would ever stop bleeding ... " To silence those who would otherwise be yammering away for hours, start a conversation by politely asking "Mind if I drool?" or, better yet, try flapping your arms wildly during takeoff and, when asked, explain that you're just helping the pilot. 
The fun doesn't stop there, of course. You can memorize the safety annoucements and do them in rap form, make fun of the food, or even surf up and down the aisle during takeoffs and landings by removing your shoes and using two of those plastic-coated safety cards as skis. (According to a friend of mine, people actually did this aboard the press plane during last year's presidential campaign. I have a feeling it wouldn't go over too well on the average flight, however.) 
In reality, rm sure that flying isn't really that boring or that bad; its just that I tly a lot of discount airlines. You know, the kind that have slogans like: "just like a bus ... but with wings!"

Expos losing pitchers to free agent market 
MONTHI~AL (AP) -Losing two starting pitchnrs hurts. even if tlwir combined record was 19-24 last season. But see­ing them get $2 million a year has tlw Montreal Expos furi­ous. 
"Wp're going through an­ollwr pPriod of escalation," Expos owner CharlPs Bronfman said Tuesday after Bryn Smith joined Pascual Perez and jumped ship. 
"People arn being financially irn~sponsible ... ," Bronfman said. "I nwan you can havP bid­ding for players but you don't have to bP a damned fool about it. And right now. some people 
an~. 
Pen~z. 9-13 in 1989, and Bryn Smith. who was 10-11. both sigrwd fn~e-agents contracts worth about $2 million year. And. Mark Langston. llw ace of their pitching staff. probably is next. 
Smith camP to terms Tuesday with the St. Louis Cardinals on a three-year deal reportedly worth $6 million, and Perez sigrwd a three-year, $5.7 mil­lion contract with the New York Yankees last week. 
"The big clubs in the big markets can afford to do what they're doing," Bronfman said. "We can't afford to compete from a dollars standpoint." 
Montreal reportedly offered Perez a three-year contract with $1.3 million the first year. lin made $850,000 last season. 
Expos president Claude 

Brochu said the Expos deeided not to match any offers for Smith because "Bryn's a good, average pitcher. That's what he is -a .500 pitcher. If you triple his salary, it's not suddenly go­ing to make him a 20-game winner. 
"That means he's a fourth or fifth starter, and we feel the money he's seeking is excessive. We really can't compete with those numbers. We'll pass on it and go with what we've got." 
"What we have right now is a market that's out of control. 
Bather than make a mistake or do something that's not going to help us. we're going to wait and see what develops." 
Langston, whom the Expos acquired from Seattle for three young pitchers on May 25. also is a free agent. Langston, 12-9 with the Expos, was born in San Diego and has expressed a desire to play in California. 
He made $1.3 million in 1989. Montreal reportedly offered Langston a three-year contract at around $9 million, but later withdrew it. 
What the Expos have left of. their starting rotation is Dennis Martinez and Kevin Gross. Zane Smith is expected to make the move to starter from the bullpen; rookie Mark Gardner will get a shot at making the rotation and Montreal appar­ently will try to talk left-hander John Candelaria out of retiring.

Zendejas reveals bounty-hunting Eagles to NFL officials 
PIIILADELPIIIA (AP) -Dallas kicker Luis Zendejas has given the NFL the names of Philadelphia players who told him that Eagles coach Buddy Ryan put a bounty on him and two other Dallas players. 
Zendejas said he gave security offi­cials the names of "four or five" play­ers. 
lie said they warned him before the Thanksgiving Day game or admitted aftmward that Hyan planned to reward anyone who took him, quarterback Troy Aikman or punter Mike Saxon out of the game. Zendejas said he was told that Warren Welsh, the league's direc­tor of security, would question the play­ers. 
Dallas running back Junior Tauta­latasi, like Zendejas a former Eagle. said he also had spoken to NFL security people about allegations that the Eagles had placed bounties on other players during his years with the team, from 1986 to 1988. 
Meanwhile, Dallas coach Jimmy John­son said thn Cowboys wanted to put the bounty incident behind them. 
"I would anticipate a memorandum to the various teams in the league," John­son said. "It's history. I know what happened." 
NFL spokesman Dick Maxwell said the league would not comment on the investigation and declined to say whether Johnson's statement would af­fect the inquiry. 
Johnson first lodged allegations that Ryan offered bounties on Zendejas and Aikman after the Cowboys' 27-0 loss to the Eagles last week. He charged that Hyan put out a $200 bounty on Zendejas and $500 on quarterback Aikman with the payoff coming if they were knocked out of Thursday's game. The Eagles won 27-0. 
Zendejas, cut earlier this month by Philadelphia and signed by Dallas, was, in fact, hit by rookie linebacker Jessie Small after a kickoff and dazed. Aikman was also hit after the whistle on a Dallas offside, precipitating a skirmish. Small has denied going after Zendejas to collect a bounty. 
Zendejas said he he expects someone on the Eagles to confirm that bounties were offered. 
"I just pretty much have to go on the hope that someone will stand up and say what he believes," Zendejas said. 
"Buddy's job is on the line, and he didn't do a very good job of keeping this quiet because he trusted it to a rookie. Someone will spill their guts. They all said after the game they wouldn't come after me and that they were my friends. 
"Well, if they are my friends, some­body will stand up and say the truth." 
Hyan, who has labeled the charges "ridiculous," would not comment on the controversy Tuesday. Team spokesman Bon Howard said Hyan told him he would not talk about the Cowboys until next week, when Dallas plays at Philadelphia. 
.The Eagles this week released pictures taken by a team photographer of Hyan and Johnson talking pleasantly on the field before the game, prompting Eagles owner Norman Braman to question 
Johnson's remarks earlier that hP had known of the bounties before the game. 
"My God. 45 minutes before the game. Jimmy Johnson ran halfway across the finld to say hello to me," Braman said. "And that's why I found it so difficult to believe that he knew this bounty non­sense the night befom. 
"If he knew it the night before, I be­lieve that he would've said something to me and not been so effusively warm with Buddy bnfore thn game." 
Johnson, meanwhile, said h1~ doesn't want his team to retaliate in the next meeting between the teams. 
"I would discourage anything that would be a waste of time or that was disruptive." Johnson said. 
But owner Jerry Jonns said by tnle­phone on Tuesday that he was calling NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue. 
"It's a good opportunity for the rww commissioner to make a statement, an nxample, " Jones said. "I agree with Jimmy that there's a 50-50 chance any­thing will come of it. It's something that is difficult to pin down. "

Irish men's volleyball gets a jump on spring season 
Although their season is not until the spring, the men's vol­leyball team got a good indica­tion of how suc­cessful they can be after action 


o v n r t h e Mike Kamradt 
Thanksgiving Club Corner break. The 
Irish  took  a  
fourth  place  in  
the Big  

Ten Invitational at Michigan State, and then place 11th out of 16 in a highly competitive Can­adian tournament. 
Sixteen teams competed at the Big 10 Invitational. and al-though Ohio State was the only varsity team. the competition level was high. The tour­nament was divided into four pools and the Irish had Ohio State, Illinois, and Toledo in their pool. The Irish split a two-game match with eventual champion Ohio State. In that match. the Irish dropped the first game 15-5, but rebounded to beat the Buckeyes in a tight game, 15-13. Notre Dame played in the consolation champi­onship after the pool play, but the Irish lost a hard fought match to Miehigan State (16-14, 7-15. 11-15). 
The veteran players for the Irish playPd big roles in the tournament. 
Senior Mike Sheedy led the offensive attack with 60 kills. Junior Pedro Ne­malceff played a key role in many of those and other kills as he racked up 175 assists for the tournament including a whopping 52 in the match against Michigan State. Tom Martin contributed 20 blocks (9 solo) and Paul Dimieri chipped in 47 digs. 
The following weekend was no let up for the Irish as they headed north of the border to play in a tournament where all but two of the teams were varsity teams, not to mention the fact 
that the Canadian teams were in the peak of their season. This didn't faze the Irish as they raised their game a level, and beat one of the top Canadian teams in the tournament. NO defeated Laurentian in a grueling five game match 14-16, 15-10, 3-15, 15-11.15-13. 
"I think for the future this tourna­ment was a positive note," commented coach Bill Anderson. "We played well, but we still have work to do if we are going to continue to compete with var­sity teams." 
The Irish certainly showed their mental toughness as the came back from a 2-1 deficit in the match. Notre Dame was once again led by its up­perclassmen. Martin had the game winning kill in each win over Lauren­tian and Sheedy blasted home 17 kills. Nemalceff continued his steady play with 53 assists in the match while Jim 
Jeffry added 41 kills for the tourna­ment. "Our older players play very well to­gether," observed Anderson. 
The Irish also got key contributions from the freshmen in the Laurentian win as Dan Cavanaugh came off the bench to serve and Steve McSeley had four big kills. 
"Our young guys came in and played well," praised Anderson. "This is probably the best young talent we've ever had." 
The Irish showed Michigan State how much difference a week makes as they swept the Spartans 15-8, 15-6, 15-11. 
"In the past we never won a game there before," explained co-captain Sheedy. "This year we won two matches and took a few other games too, so it says a lot for the strength of program at this point." 
The Sailing Club wrapped up a very successful season with a strong finish in the Tinney Angston regatta at the Chicago Yacht Club. The Irish place 14th in the eighteen team field that in­cluded such national powers as Old Dominion, which won the regatta, as well as Tulane and Navy. 
"I was happy with the finish," said president Paige Cooper. "We finished fifth out of the nine Midwest schools so that looks pretty good for us." 
The Irish out-pointed Ohio State, Purdue. Iowa, and Minnesota while falling just behind Miami of Ohio. Notre Dame was the only team in the regatta with an all-women team. 
"The men on the teams we finished ahead of weren't too happy," said Cooper. 
Cooper and teammate Betsy Lewis finished 12th in the A division. The pair experienced firsthand the 45 de­gree water of Belmont Harbor as their boat was capsized by another boat in one of the races. In the B boat, skipper Patti Loesinske and crew Moira Sullivan could only manage a 16th place. Still, the Club feels confident about the results. 
"This gives us a lot of confidence for the spring season," commented Cooper. 
.... 

The Equestrian Club participated in the Ball State Horse Show Nov. 17 and 18. The Irish team placed four people in the competition: Matt Burke placed sixth and Karen Voltura finished third in the beginning Western competition. and Becky Barnes finished second and Christine Taase fourth \n Beginning Walk-Trot in the Hunt Seat. 
"We have a young team and a small team, but we'relooking ahead to the future," said Larissa Wenning, Equestrian Club Secretary

Campbell resigns as Falcon coach 
Plummeting Pats give Berry vote of confidence 
SUWANEE, Ga. (/\PI -Mar­ion Campbell ended a 28-year N Fl. eoaching career Tuesday by retiring as head coach of the Atlanta Falcons, mired in last plaee in the NFC West. Assis­tant Jim llanifan was named coach for the remaining four games. 
"I have chosen this avenue to dear the picture for the owner­ship to get on with the future of their franchise," Campbell said in a prepared statement re­leased about an hour before llanifan was named interim coach. 
".Jim was kind of the obvious one." Vice President Taylor Smith said of the selection of llanifan, who won't be consid­ered for the pPrmanent job. 
"We'll be going outside the organization for a coach," Smith said at a news confer­enec. "We're approaching this that nobody on the present roaching staff will be consid­ered for the job. They've been informed. They're all staying on. llopefully they will be con­sidemd by the new coaeh when­Pver he's hired." 
llanifan, who was a head coach for six years with the St. Louis Cardinals, said his goal is to have the Falcons "competitive for the next four weeks, and it's a tough row we have to hoe." 
Thn Falcons, 3-9, must face the San Francisco 49ers, Min­rwsota Vikings, Washington Hedskins and Detroit Lions in tlwir last four games. 
Campbell. 60, was on his sec­ond tour as the head coach of the Faleons and also coached the Philadelphia Eagles for three seasons. llis overall rncord was 34-80-1 in six full st'asons and portions of three othPrs. 
Campbell, who had left the Suwarwe training complex be­fore Smith's noon news confer­ence, said he had no plans for tlw future. 
In his statmnent. he said he discusst~d his retirement with tlw wam's owners Monday and told his staff and players of his decision TuPsday morning. 
"I feel that I am leaving a better football team than when I took over." Campbell said. "I told the team this morning that I hope they can get on with their business and be the best they can be." 
Atlanta has lost five of its 

last six games, leading to spec­ulation that Campbell would be fired at the end of the season. I lis three-year contract expires this year. 
Smith declined to say if that would have happened. but he said Campbell could have re­mained for the last four games had he desired. 
"He had a good grasp of the overall situation here," said Smith, son of team owner Hankin Smith Sr. "He also felt there would be more pressure over the last four weeks and bP a very difficult environment for us to make any progress in. 
"I think Marion did a great job," Smith said. "He laid a stepping stone for the future." 
Smith said the front office and Campbell realized "that we were not a very good football team" when he took the job for the second time following the firing of Dan Henning after the 1986 season. 
Campbell was no better than the fourth choice to replace Henning, but former Eagles' coach Diek Vermeil, New York Giants coach Bill Parcells and 
UCLA  coach  Terry  Donahue  
turned  down  offers  to  coach  
the Falcons.  

Campbell also was head coach of the Falcons from 1974-1976 and coached the Philadelphia Eagles from 1983­85. 
New England Patriots' owner Victor Kiam said Tuesday he plans to extend coach Haymond Berry's contract despite the team's 4-8 record and the team's worst start since 1981. 
"Berry is a very good eoach and he's staying,'' Kiam told Assoeiated Press Sports Edi­tors at their Northeast regional meeting. "I have every intention of extending Haymond Berry's contract." 
The Patriots face their first season since 1982 without selling out a single home game. The Patriots have filled Sullivan Stadium to less than 88 pereent of its capacity this year. 
Despite the team's lack of success on the field and at the box office, Kiam said he is pleased with the purchase he made in 1988. 
"The Patriots are a labor of love. I'm not going to make any rash deeisions. We are going to have ups and downs. And, yes, we've got some problems now." 

lire Morton and said tho school would exercise thl' reassign­ment elausn in his contrart. Morton has two years remain­ing on his five-yPar contract. 
Shalala said the decision to fire Morton was not based solely on his 6-27 record over the past three years. An ad hoe committeP fornwd to evaluate the football program rnportt~d that the Badgers. under Mor­ton, had not made tlw neces­sary progrnss to bncome a win­ner. 
"Our primary responsibility is to the student athletes. Wn be­lieve they deserve the bt~st coaching they can get. It is pos­sible to mount a competitive warn while playing within the rules. We have demonstrated that in other sports,'' said Sha­lala. 
"The judgment is that foot­ball has not made sufficient progress in the past three years in establishing a solid base and moving toward a comrwtitive position,'' she said. "Tiw win­loss rerord was not tlw dnf'id­ing factor." 
Wisconsin's athlPtic dPpart­nwnt fans a multi-million dol­lar budget delieit brought on. in part, by declining attendance at football games.

Robinson shoots 10-of-11, pours in 26 points in win 

By GREG GUFFEY 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Last season, Notre Dame men's basketball coach Digger Phelps named forward Keith Robinson to his "All Invisible Team." Robinson scored the points and got the rebounds on a consistent basis, but nobody seemed to take notice. 
In Notre Dame's season­opener Tuesday night against San Francisco, the invisible man became a visible force in the Irish fronteourt. 
Hobinson scored a career­high 26 points and pulled down six rebounds to pace the Irish to an 84-64 victory over the Dons. More impressively, he hit 1 0-of-11 field goals and 6-of-7 free throws. 

"He's a very quick and strong guy inside," San Francisco coach Jim Brovelli said. "He's greatly improved. We didn't have a big, strong, agile guy like him inside to match up." 
With sophomore forward LaPhonso Ellis ineligible for at least the first six games, Phelps knew someone up front would need to turn in better than av­erage performances. 
Robinson turned in a domi­nating one against San Fran­cisco. 
"I felt like it was going to be a physical game," Robinson said. "I thought they were going to push me around. I had to move to get open. The players were looking for me down low and it just worked out well." 
Robinson was determined to start the season on a positive note. He scored just six points on 3-of-10 shooting in 37 min­utes against Israel in Notre Dame's lone exhibition contest. 
"I really felt like I had a bad game against Israel," Robinson said. "I just wanted to go out and play well in the first game of the year." 

This game was one for Robinson to break out, to add some confidence to an Irish team filled with great expecta­tions. He made himself known early and often against the Dons. 
Robinson hit his first bucket with just over one minute gone in the game to give Notre Dame a 6-5 lead, an advantage the Irish would never relinquish. lie scored twice more in the next two minutes to boost the Irish lead to 15-10 and finished with 15 points in the half. 
Robinson turned in some plays that might have seemed out of place in previous years. 
With 6:19 to play. Robinson fed Tim Singleton on a fast break for an easy hoop. Then two minutes later, he stole the ball, dribbled upcourt, gave the ball up to Joe Fredrick and then completed the give-and-go with a layup. 
Robinson controlled the first five minutes of the second half. lie scored Notre Dame's first nine points of the half, mixing a slam with an inside power move, an outside jumper. a layup off a press-breaker and a free throw. That run extended Notre Dame's lead to 57-38. 
see ROBINSON I page 13 
If so-and-so beats so-and-so, and... 
Notre Dame always has had thtl reputation of being a thorn on Alabama's side. · 
In his legendary coaching career, Paul "Bear" Bryant only played and failed to de­feat two schools-Alabama and Notre Dame. Bryant-


coached Crimson Tide teams Steve Megargee 
lost to the Irish in the 1973 

Sugar Bowl and 1975 Orange Irish Items Bowl, with Alabama playing for the national title in both instances. Notre Dame's hex on Bryant caused one Alabama fan to mutter during the Iranian hostage crisis, ''I'd root for Iran before I'd root for Notre Dame." 
Alabama finally has an opportunity to turn the tables on the Irish this weekend. If the Crimson Tide get past arch-rival Auburn at Jordan-Hare Stadium this weekend, Notre Dame's dreams of defending its national title are a memory. 
But whether the Tide wins Saturday or not, the Irish are facing a major obstacle in their quest for a national championship. Make that about four ob­stacles. 
For Notre Dame to finish the season ranked first, all these things need to happen: 
Auburn beating Alabama this Saturday 
Whoever 
represents the Southeastern Conference (Alabama, Auburn or Tennessee) defeating Miami in the Sugar Bowl 

Southern 
California topping Michigan in the Rose Bowl 

Notre 
Dame soundly defeating Colorado in the Orange Bowl 


The optimistic types can believe that the third op­tion isn't necessary, thinking an Irish victory would leapfrog Notre Dame over a Michigan team it de­feated on the road early this season. But that might be expecting a little much from pollsters who aren't exactly elephants when it comes to remembering things that happen early in the year. 
Taking these four conditions into account, and as­suming there is a 50 percent chance of each one oc­curring (which might be a little generous), you have 16-1 odds against the Irish defending the title. 
So it might be time to start collecting rabbit's feet, searching for four-leaf clovers, crossing fingers and toes and knocking on wood. 
But with these kinds of odds facing the Irish, I wouldn't hold my breath. 
The Football Writers' Association came out with its All-America team earlier this week, and it in­cluded three Notre Dame players. 
Haghib "Hocket" Ismail made the team as a kick returner, Chris Zorich was on the defensive line and Todd Lyght was selected to the secondary. The ironic part of these honors is that none of the Irish All-Americans are seniors. 
Houston's Andre Ware was named the All-America quarterback. 
The 19th-ranked Notre Dame men's basketball team opened its season Tuesday night with star forward LaPhonso Ellis on the sidelines out of uni­form. 
Ellis, who is academically ineligible for the fall semester, may have been off the court, but Irish coach Digger Phelps certainly hasn't forgotten about him. 
"It will be like when we finally got to the mainland with the atomic bomb," Phelps said about Ellis' im­pending return to action. "That's what it will be like when he gets back. He's our Hiroshima, our Na­gasaki.He's just awesome in practice right now. The other day in a scrimmage, I just kept shaking my head. 
"If you don't exploit this place academically, it will force you to exploit the place academically," Phelps continued, in reference to his star's ineligibility. "He
