Associated Press 
BEIRUT, Le.banon -U.S. naval guns hammered away at Druse ar­tillery positions in Lebanon's central mountains yesterday, and for the first time a U.S. spokesman said the firing was in support ofthe Lebanese army's defense ofSouk ei-Gharb. 
The government's Radio Beirut reported that fighting raged into the night in the mountain tow11 overlooking the Lebanese capital. An army communique said a Lebanese Bulldog reconnaissance plane crashed near the Druse moun­tain town ofAley "and the fate ofthe two pilots is still unknown." 
It was the third time in the 16 days of renewed civil war that U.S. ships have opened fire and the first time since Syria warned Sunday that its troops in Lebanon would fire back if attacked by American ground, air or sea forces. 
Druse spokesmen in Beirut claimed the American shells landed in about five towns around Souk el­Gharb and an undetermined num­ber of civilians were killed. But U.S. officials insisted the guns were firing at military positions. 
Israeli Druse leaders protested to 
U.S. Ambassador Samuel Lewis in Tel Aviv, claiming Washington was supporting the Christian Phalangists against the Druse in the fighting. The Druse sect is an offshoot oflslam. 
French Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson, whose government has troops in the multinational force in Beirut, also criticized American military intervention in the civil war. He said he did not believe that the U.S. action, particularly the Navy shelling, "is the best method to achieve" a settlement. 
The destroyer John Rodgers and the guided missile cruiser Virginia fired repeated barrages in the morn­ing and again in the afternoon as the U.S.-trained Lebanese Army's 8th Brigade fought with Druse and Palestinian guerrillas attacking Souk ei-Gharb, the mountaintop town nine miles southeast of Beirut that overlooks the U.S. Marine base at the Beirut airport. 
"The naval gunfire support was conducted on military targets threatening the Lebanese armed forces defending Souk el-Gharb," said U.S. Embassy spokesman John Stewart. "Successful Lebanese armed forces defense of the area is vital to the safety of U.S. personnel, including the U.S. multinational forces, other U.S. military and the 
U.S. diplomatic corps personnel."

We d1·eamed too small a dream. Tomorrow we will begin again and build it bigger, and when it is built, we willputa golddome on top. -Father Edward Sorin 
It will be one hundred years ago this fall that the scaffolding was removed from around the Dome and the structure stood "revealed in all its grandeur," according to aScholastic article ofthe time. 
Sorin promised Notre Dame a golden dome after his famous "even if it were all gone, I would not give up" speech in 1879. 
His collegues later reneged on the plan, thinking Sorin's foolish eccentricity too expensive. Sorin left campus vowing not to return until fellow ad­ministrators agreed to the idea. 
They agreed. 

So Notre Dame built the foundation, the skeleton and the wood facade, Saint Mary's bought the statue and the Dome was created. 
And if Father Sorin is watching today, he is not at all pleased with what has become ofhis Dome. 
Recently I was given the opportunity to explore the closed fifth floor of the Ad­ministration Building. That floor, not open to the public for the last 25 years, once housed the fine arts depart­ment and a variety ofclasses including architecture, mec­hanical drawing, speech, () music and journalism. 

The huge double-storied classrooms of the fifth floor /) stand vacant now. The skylights filter dim sunlight · on dusty wooden floors. The faded wainscotting, falling plaster and ancient radiators appear strangely out of place next to the shiny pipes of the ceiling sprinkler system installed in 1981. 
Dusty murals of civil war battle scenes line the cor­ridors, forgotten momentos of a 19th century cyclorama promoter who ran out of mor)ey !},ere. Below the murals are wooden cases that contained Civil War memorabilia until 1942, when they were emptied after a fire scare. 
The cases now contain the dated scribblings of countless forgotten undergrads who felt the need to im­mortalize illicit midnight visits to the forbidden floor. Glancing at the names and dates, I wondered where the inquisitive student who "made it to the top in '63" is now. He is probably a corporate executive today, if he wasn't expelled for his moonlit adventures. 
Most ofthe names are dated between 1960 and 1980. After-hours flash-lit investigations seem to have dwindled these past few years, perhaps due to in­
creased security measures.

Colorful stories describing the door to the upper bal­cony and the Dome itselfhave become a part ofcampus folklore. Those stories art' true. That famous door on the fifth floor is made ofsolid oak, plated with steel, and secured with an iron bar, three massive locks and an alarm system. 
The insurance policy allows only workmen above the fifth floor. That hasn't stopped the truly adventurous, however. Additional graffiti marring the upper balcony 
is much more visible from the top floor. 
Also more visible are massive cracks in the four­door frames on the balcony. And the deterioration of the paint on the upper walls lends a shabby air to the cen­ter of Notre Dame. 
Luigi Gregori, the artist who painted the Administra­0 
tion Building murals and maintained his studio on the fifth floor, would probably drop over in his palate if he saw the condition of his for­
0 
floors ofit. 

The decay of the Administration Buiiding started long ago. In 1959, a Scholastic writer wrote a satirical piece titled "The Decline and Fall ofthe Main Building." 
Things have gotten worse since then. 
We should not he content to let it continue deteriorating. Remember the fate of the Old Fieldhouse. 
If you happen to notice a slight change in the figure atop the Dome soon, it will probably be a downward tilt of the head. That will be Our Lady, bowing her head in shame at what has become of her building.

Water saftey course helps Notre Dame soph save child's life 
By STEVE GASTA 
News Staff 

While most students were enjoy· ing their first few weeks of summer basking in the sun, Notre Dame sophomoreJack Considine was busy saving a young boy's life. 
On June 2, Considine, a native of Savannah, Georgia, was working at the Savannah Golf Club swimming pool where he has been head lifeguard for the past four years. It was the first day of day camp and according to Considine there were 60 to 65 children swimming in the pool. 
" .. it was just a natural reaction'' 
A camp counselor who was in the pool suddenly pulled up five-year­old Michael Herring,Jr., who had ap­parently been under the water for a long time, and began callingfor Con­sidine who was standing about 25 feet away. 
"When she (the camp counselor) handed the boy to me he was all blue and really looked dead," said Con­sidine. 
"I laid the boy on the cement and checked for breathing and a pulse. It was apparent he wasn't breathing but he had a very faint pulse," said Considine. 
"Because he had a pulse I didn't do CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscita­tion) but went straight to mouth-to­motJtll'" '1-'esuscitation." Considine continued administering mouth-to­mouth for five to six minutes until the boy started breathing on his own. 
"It was about 30 to 40 minutes 
before the ambulance arrived. Then 
they stabilized Michael and took him 
to the hospital," continued Con­
sidine. Although Herring was not 
breathing when found, he suffered 
no brain damage. 

Considine has been a registered lifeguard for five years. He has not only Water Safety Instructor ( WSI) 
status, hut also has taken many other courses including advanced life­saving and multimedia first aid. It is to this training that Considine ac­credits his lifesaving accomplish­ment. 
"At first everything. just clicked. I had practiced so much on a dummy it was just a natural reaction," said Considine. Considine says he was not scared or nervous at the time of the incident, but admits later the thoughts of what could have hap­pened made him a little nervous. 
Even though the Red Cross is awarding Considine a commenda­tion for his effort, he does not con­sider himself a hero. "I was pleased with myself because I was able to use my training effectively, but mainly I was just doing my job," ex­plained Considine. Considine said his parents and family were very congratulatory and his mother baked him a batch of cookies, hut that was about all the thanks he ex­pected. He also said, "My friends joked about it and called me a hero, hut that cooled off after about a month." 
Considine plans to lifeguard again this summer. He does not feel he will be overly cautious or nervous, but he will be even more ready if the incident arises again. "I feel very confident and pleased with myself Although I don't want it to happen again, if it did I know I would he able to handle it," concluded Considine.

An experimental program is proposed at Senior Bar, opening it up one night a week to underclas­smen. Although this was tried last year, Callaghan thought that a night other than Sunday ought to he tried. 
The housing problem was also suggested as another issue to raise to the Board of Trustees. Callaghan backed a proposal for under­graduate townehouses like O'Hara­Grace Graduate Residences either on University property or long-term leases to build on non-University owned property. 
In other news, Student Union Director Dave Drouillard an­nounced that the Student llnion is sponsoring the rock group Kansas on Thursday, Nov. 3.

Other differences give the American advisers reason for con­fidence: El Salvador's neighbors sup­port Washington; there is no North Vietnam sending its own troops into the war; El Salvador is smaller, more manageable. 
"I think one major difference," said an intdligence oft1cer, "is that we can understand the Salvadorans ' better than we ever understood the Vietnamese." 
Many Salvadoran officers have been trained in the United States, and U.S. advisers in the region in­clude many native Spanish speakers -Mexican-and Cuban-Americans, and Puerto Ricans. 
But perhaps the lesson learned best in Vietnam is the one that has kept U.S. combat troops out of the Central American conflict.

The "peace-keeping" lessons of Lebanon 
Four American soldiers have died in Lebanon and 20 have been wounded, therefore let's get the rest out. That is the zany logic coming out of Rep. Clarence Long (D· Md.) and other innocents still pursuing G~orge Washin2ton's sensible dream (at the;,

time) of"no foreign entanglements." 
Clearly we are entangled with the politics, economics. and religious ethics of the Middle East, willy-nilly. The only question is how the United States can best extricate itself while helping that hapless huddle of peoples to get off each other's backs and go about their daily lives more peacefully. 
How can President Reagan convince his growing array ofcongressional critics that the entry of American naval batteries into the fighting doesn't make it a "war" within the meaning ofthe War Powers Act? 
To call the role of the Americans a "peace­keeping" one is something of a semantic dodge. They didn't and don't intend to get in· to the killing and dying, but they are drawn in anyway by the nature ofthe beast. Since there is no peace in Lebanon f'Jr "peace-keeping" forces to keep, they are in reality filling a 
military brokerage role -trying to use the power of persuasion and the persuasion of power to get the warring factions to stop planting dynamite and lobbing shells at each other, and to join in forming a Lebanese nation that doesn't yet exist under the Gemayel government. 
But the American Marines and Naval guns can be no more effective than the political clarity of the power brokers behind them in Washington. And that, alas, has been ques­tionable. 
There is a finality about policy blunders as there is about death. After the first death, wrote Dylan Thomas, there is no other. It is a sad law of history that after the first decisive policy blunder the options in foreign policy get woefully limited. 
The Israelis discovered this in starting an invasion of Lebanon they couldn't finish. The Americans also took on a messy military and political job which they too will find hard to 
.firi'i,sh -mainly because they failed to under­stand from the start that it is the Syrians who are behind the Palestinian Left and the Druze and Shiite Muslim attacks on the Lebanese government. 
Washington focused on the Israelis and got them to stop shooting and accept a ceasefire, which enabled the Syrians to strengthen their hold and the Russians to restore and redouble the Syrian missiles which the Israelis had knocked out. It is this political blunder which has led to the situation ofthe Marines as sitting 


ducks for  death trained  at  them from  the  
Shouf,  where  Syria's  Druze  allies  are  
entrenched.  

Thus the Americans all but lost their non­war in Lebanon even before the Marines and the Navy came. 
There is a debate in Washington whether the killings in Lebanon flow from a religious and ideological civil war or whether they flow from a foreign power -Syria. Obviously, both are mixed together. But the prudent and healthy thing now is to test the proposition that the Syrians are the key by training all of America's diplomatic, economic, financial and political guns on them. 
Once the U.S. is clear about who tbe enemy is, the initial blunder may just possibly be retrieved

Korean incident calls for reflection 
Dear Editor: 
In his letter to the editor (published on Sept. 15). Kenneth Kemp invite; me to further explain my action and my letter to the editor (published on Sept. 12). 
Mr. Kemp, I did not say that my letter of protest, as you chose to call it. was justified while the sign Soviet Uninn -Killer ofIn­nocent People was not. Both the sign and my letter are justified and justifiable. Of course, one could argue over the term "justified." In my letter l went beyond the content of the sign, in that I commented on a prevalent at­titude which has captured the American public (and the people ofother countries too) for the past two weeks. My point was to divert the energy spent hurling abuse at the Soviet Union into a more reflectory mood, which would allow us to deal with the murder that we witnessed on a rational level. Mike McClory attempted to do just that although I think -as I will outline below -he did not do a good job at it. 
When I found the piece of cardboard in 
front of the Administration Building it was partly torn up and lay abandoned (this is why I referred to environmental reasons in my let· ter) and I decided to throw it into a trashcan rather than leave it lying there. Then I started making inferences from the sign's statement and the USSR Murderers statement and all other comments we had heard thus far to con· elude that the majority of American people did not sincerely mourn the death of the airplane passengers. I did not say that it is un­christian for Americans to protest the killing. Apparently Mr. Kemp read something into my letter which I did not say! Likewise I do not understand his allusion to my nationality: I will always try to correct what I perceive to be wrong regardless ofwhere I live. When I was in Southern Africa I protested against the wrongs J perceived in Southern Africa, now that I happen to live in the United States I try to point to the wrongs I perceive in the United States. Thus, it is not a question of nationality but rather a question ofwhat is right and what is wrong. 

Mike McClory states that "some students have pointed fingers towards Moscow and accused them of various crimes, while other students with their noses buried in Bibles (that's me, I suppose, although I didn't know that I have more than one nose) have urged only the sinless to throw the first stone." McClory suggests that both kinds of students haven't really thought through the issue, and therefore he will do it for us. Mr. McClory, it is not pointless, as you suggest, to point out that a Soviet pilot clid kill people (and it is not pointless to demonstrate against the killing), and likewise it is not pointless to point out that such an action should help us reflect upon our own deeds. 
Let me reverse Mike McClory's question: doeshe make a point? As far as I am can tell, no. McCio y displays a deplorable attitude: "Anyone who gets too caught up in a discus­sion ofinternational politics needs a lesson in the ba.~ic facts oflife," he says. Which "facts of life"? McClory continues: "There are little people and there are governments." I assume 
this means that Mr.McCiory has abandoned any hope of helping to exercise democratic control over one's government. It is a fatalistic viewpoint to think that we, the "little people," can do nothing about our own government. We can! While Mike McClory thinks that a proper response to the Soviet's action is to stay out of politics, my suggestion would be ·toget involved in politi.cs. Getting involved in political issues does not mean a one-sided in­
volvement.

Tuning up for spring 
Baseball team seeks to build 
By SEAN CALLAHAN 
.\ports Writer 
The fall edition of the '83·'84 
Notre Dame baseball team will host 
Bethel College for a double-header 
on Saturday and will play another 
twinbill Sunday against Valparaiso 
University. 
Coach Larry Gallo, explaining that 
the fall season, unlike the spring, is 
merely exhibition, said, "We use the 
fall as a screening process for tryouts 
and to see what we have for the 
spring." 
Gallo had planned to make cuts af­
ter a scheduled double-header with 
Bradley University last Sunday but 
the games were rained out and will 
not be made up. The field was 
playable Sunday, but the game was 
cancelled due to the forecast of rain 
and to prevent Bradley from travell­
ing four hours for nothing. 
The 45 players remaining on the 
team will be pared down to 30 or 25 
after Gallo and his staff watch this 
weekend's contests in addition to 
intra-squad games today and tomor­
row. 
Despite the fact that the full team 
has not yet been selected, Gallo hao; 
chosen outfielder Carl Vuono as 
team captain. 
Although the fall season has no 
bearing on the Midwestern City 
Conference standings, Gallo is 
taking it seriously. 

Beat the Buckeyes 
"We're going to go out there to win," he said. He pointed out that the team had a disappointing spring, and a good fall season would boost the team's confidence. 
"I'd like to look back and say, 'We 


Carl Vuono 

had a pretty good fall.' Last spring wasn't much to build on." 
Infielder Jack Moran also sees the fall season as potentially beneficial. He feels that working on the fun­damentals and simply playing again after some players took the summer offis good preparation for the spring season. 
"Inexperience across the board" plagued last year's spring squad, according to Gallo. 
Last year's 19-28 record was Gal­lo's first losing season at Notre Dame after two winning years. Following his first two seasons, the Irish schedule became tougher, partially explaining last season's losing record. 
Again this year Gallo has what he believes is a young team, despite the fact that five starters are returning. 
Gallo said, "We'll have a young pitching staff. We lost five pitchers last year." 
In tune with Gallo's statements, Moran said, "We need a lot out of our pitchers this year." 
One pitcher who the Irish will be counting on heavily is Mark Clementz, mainly because he has been statistically the best pitcher on the squad over the past two years. 
"Mark is a steady performer," said Gallo. "He throws strikes, has good breaking pitches, and hits his spots well." 
In addition to the pitching, Gallo feels the Irish defense must be im­proved. Two years ago the defense ranked tenth in the nation, but last year Irish fielding dropped con­siderably in the national rankings. 
Another problem Gallo would like to correct is the habit of falling behind early in the game. He ex­plained that his team did not steal many bases last year and played "station to station," because of­tentimes they had fallen behind and were not in a position to gamble. 
Notre Dame outsmarts OSU 
ByDAVIDROOP 
.\ports Writer 
Last Friday, the Ohio State cross country team tried to steal one from their Notre Dame opponents. When the gun went off, the OSU pack leapt from the starting line, hoping to gain an early lead, while trying to "psych­out" the Notre Dame runners. 
Apparently, their tactic granted them their former wish; five OSU runners battled Notre Dame's Tim Cannon for the lead, with the remainder of the Notre Dame pack running in small groups behind them. 
Notre Dame Coach Joe Plane ex­plained, "Ohio State went out pretty hard in their attempt to control (steal) the race. But by three kilometers our guys had caught them and by four kilometers we were clearly in control." To the dismay of the Ohio State team, the Notre Dame pack would not be denied. In other words, a fast start could not "psych-out" a talented and mentally-ready Notre Dame squad. 
As the race progressed, Ci!nnon wore down the leading Ohio State runners. Eventually all five would be "broken" by Notre Dame's co­captain and top returning letterman. 
Notre Dame seniors Ralph Caron and EdJuba, running together since the early stages of the race, were joined by Andy Dillon and Bill Courtney at the three kilometer mark. Then, Courtney dropped off the pace somewhat, while the remaining three surged to join Can· 
Tennis team wins three

Many Notre Dame sports fans 

might look upon last weekend as a 
lost one with Michigan State's stun­
ning upset over the Irish football 
team last Saturday. However, those 
fans who follow women's tennis 
might tend to disagree. Coach 
Sharon Petro's team went un­
defeated over the weekend and are 
now 4-0 on the seao;on. 
On Friday afternoon, the Lady Irish tennis team easily defeated But­ler, 9-0, by sweeping all six singles matches and all three doubles matches. The Irish simply outplayed the Butler team. 
On Saturday morning, the Irish had little difficulty in defeating Depauw. The singles matches were swept in straight set victories. 
Pam Fischette and Laura Lee had little trouble defeating their op­ponents. Jo Ann Blafore had a tough match but rallied In the second set to win 6-4, 6-4. 
The only point lost over the weekend came at first doubles. The team of Mary Colligan and Flschette lost on Saturday when they encoun­tered a talented Depauw first doubles team. 
This Depauw team executed and played solid tennis early in the match; therefore, they won the first set rather easily by a 6-3 count. Col· ligan and Fischette fought their way back in the second set, but it just wasn't enough. They lost the set 7-5. 
The second doubles team ofSusie Panther and Laura Lee were vic­torious by scores of 6-1, 6-0. The third doubles team of Lisa LaFretta 
and  Gretta  Roemer  were  also  
stra t ight set victors.  
And  in  a  late  result,  the  Irish  

women handily defeated Wheaton College by a 9-0 score yesterday to raise their season record to 5-0. 
Coach Petro was obviously very pleased with the performance ofher team. However, the team can only savor these victories for a short time because of the many tough matches to come in the next few weeks. 
The team would greatly ap­preciate some more fans for their next home meet, which is tomorrow against Rosary. 
non. 

By the time the lead runners had 
hit the halfway point (four 
kilometers), they had gained a solid 
hold on the race. 

The Ohio State squad did cause 
one problem for the Irish with its 
suicidal quick start. 
"Our original intention was to 
start out slow and make our move at 
about three kilometers," explained 
Juba. "Their fast start thwarted our 
race stategy because it srread us 
out." 

Fortunately, the Irish were able to 
regroup. Cannon, Dillon, Caron, and 
Juba ran the second half of the race 
in what Juba described as, "a hard 
but not overly taxing pace." 
They finished at 24:44 in a four­
way tie for first. Then, Ohio State's 
top runner, Kurt Klodnick, who had 
recently finished second in t OSU's 
three-way meet with Western Mich­
igan and Bowling Green, finished 
fifth at 25:02. 

Leading the second pack of Notre Dame runners, freshman standout Mike Collins finished sixth at 25: I 2, followed closely by Jim Tyler, John Adams, and Craig Maxfield. 
It is noteworthy to mention that this second pack ran times which are very comparable to the times of Notre Dame's lead pack two years ago on the same course. . Even better, Notre Dame's top four men are nearly a half-minute faster than their forerunners were two years ago. 
The final tally indicates Notre Dame's dominance over their Ohio State counterparts: NO I 6 OSU 4 7 (lowest score wins). · 
At this point, Notre Dame's cross country team looks strong; however, a fifth man to join the ranks of their top four runner's caliber would be a welcome addi­tion. 
Hopefully, one ofthe second four finishers (Collins, Tyler, Adams, Maxfield) will develop Into that strong fifth man. 
In any case, the student body gets a chance to play "sixth man" this Saturday when the team takes on Northwestern at 1 I am. on Burke Memorial GolfCourse.

Will the real Irish please stand up? 
Ifyou're looking for an optimbtic column that tells you 
not to worry hecause it's early in the year, you won't find it 
here. 

If you're looking for a scathing column attacking Gerry 
faust, Blair Kiel, and all the other popular targets, you 
won't tlnd that here either. 

The reason is quite simple: after two games like Purdue 
and Micht~-:an State, it is impossihle to get a true reading of 
this Notre Dame football team. Thtre are just too many 
4uestions that have to he answered. 

The first 4uestion is the most important one. 
Wbicb Notre Dame team is tbe real Notre Dame team? 
We have seen two different Notre Dame teams so far this 
year. Against Purdue, we saw an Irish squad that abused a 
Purdue team that was supposed to he a tough opponent. 
We saw a team that put pressure on the quarterback, didn't 
give up the big play, and both ran and passed the ball effi­
ciently. We also saw a team that seemed to possess a killer 
instinct. 

Against Michigan State, we saw a Notre Dame team lose 
to a team that doesn't have anywhere near the talent that 
Notre Dame does. We saw a team that couldn't put much 
pressure on the quarterhack and could rush, but not pass. 
Wt· saw a team that was very susceptible to the big play. 
And we saw a team that didn't want to win as much as the 
opponent. 

Which team should we expect to see for the rest of the season? If it is the team that crushed Purdue, maybe we can write off this Michigan State game as the one bad game of the season. If it is the team that we saw on Saturday, this season will be like the last two. Most likely, the real Notre Dame team is a combination of the two. The next few games will tell us what kind of team we should expect. 
Are we seeing tbe "new, improved" Blair Kiel, ordid be, like tbe rest of tbe team, have an unusually bad game Saturday? 
We have been told repeatedly that Kiel is a better quar­terback this year. He's supposedly more confident and cool under pressure. His performance at Purdue seemed to prove this. 
However, the Blair Kiel that played against the Spartans looked like the Kiel of old. In all fairness to him, he had little pass protection and was dizzy from a concussion he received in the first half. Still, the results -two intercep­tions -give one an uneasy feeling that maybe Kiel is no

better this year than last. Things like fumbling the snap on an important drive late in the game also makes one wonder about his coolness under fire. Once again, though, we won't get an answer for another game or two. 
Wb_v did tbe Michigan State players want to win tbe game more than tbe Notre Dame players? 
The judgement that Michigan State wanted to win more is not my own. At lea~t three key Notre Dame players said as much after the game. 
This question bothers me more than the others right now. We all hear how Notre Dame opponents are more psyched up for Notre Dame than any other team. This I understand. However, when people use this as a reason for a loss, I have to question it. When Nebraska plays a team, it is the opponent's biggest game of the year, but Nebraska still beats it to a pulp. 
Whether or not Notre Dame is as psyched up for a game as the opponent, the ultimate goal should be to win, no matter what it takes. Notre Dame has a lot more to lose than the game, so it's necessary for them to want to win. If Michigan State loses by five, it still goes home knowing it gave powerful Notre Dame a tough game. Notre Dame doesn't have that luxury. Saturday's game might be Michi­gan State's toughest of the year, but that doesn't make people at Notre Dame feel any better. 
Now, with their backs to the wall, the Notre Dame players are going to have to show how much they want to win. 
These are the major questions that arise from the Michi­gan State game, but there are other questions. Why couldn't we get a pass rush? Why couldn't we adjust to Michigan State's defense? How badly are injuries hurting the team? Like the first few questions, they will be answered in the next few weeks. 
So we're two weeks into the season and things are not looking good for the Notre Dame football team. A loss so early in the year to a team that everyone thought we would 
roll over has had a tremendous effect on Notre Dame fans, 
alumni, and, especially, students. 
The students have been pushed to the edge. They are 
beginning to feel that this season will be like the last two. 
Seniors are already mourning their final year and kicking 
themselves that they passed up going to the Sugar Bowl as 
freshmen. Juniors are wondering if they will ever get to a 
bowl game. They are rapidly losing confidence in the team. 
For the first time in three years, I have heard people say 
that they've given up on the team. 
The players and coaches are surely getting wind of the students' unrest. Thus, they should know that the pressure's on even more than usual. How they respond over the next nine weeks is going to tell a lot about the character ofthe players and coaches. 
With all of this in mind, I'd like to offer a challenge to 
both players and students. 
I've heard a number of players say that the national championship is still within reach and I agree totally with them. But, as the saying goes, "put your money where your mouth is." There is no doubt that, in order to do this, Notre Dame would have to win the rest of its games, including a major bowl game. It won't be easy, but this team can do it if it takes each team individually and comes into the game as psyched up as the other team. 
Ifwe've learned anything over the last couple of years, it's that you cannot look ahead and take any team for granted. Before Michigan State, I thought that the team had learned this lesson, but obviously not. 
Fortunately, we have our fate pretty much in our own hands. However, the team had better realize that the stu­dents are not ready for another season like the past two. And what good is it to play for a student body that doesn't have any confidence in you. 
The challenge to the students is not to give up on the team. Everyone knows how important it is to Notre Dame for the football team to do well. Look at the effect the game had on the social life on Saturday night. Ifyou don't havt· confidence in the team, the excitement of football weekends will be lost. 
What all this means is that the biggest game in three years will be played next Saturday night at Miami. forget about Michigan State and look toward Miami.
