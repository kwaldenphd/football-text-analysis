Aquino seeks cease-fire, orders release of prisoners 
Associated Press 
MANILA, Philippines President Corazon Aquino ordered the immediate release of 33 political prisoners today, and her government announced that the cases of another 400 people were being studied. 
Gen. Fidel Ramos, the new military chief, announced the releases after an early morning Mass, where one prisoner, iden­tified as Jaime Verdan, told the crowd, "I cannot say how happy I am. I thank 'people's power' and God." 
Human rights groups have estimated approximately 500 people were held under the Presidential Detention Act, adopted during the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos. 
The government-run broad­cast station said yesterday that a military task force would meet during the night to prepare a list of the prisoners and said the new administration was "hop­ing" for the release of approx­imately 50 percent of them. 
Aquino said earlier yesterday she would seek a cease-fire with communist guerrillas but not the extradition of Marcos, who was driven into exile by her "people's power" revolt. 
Salvador Laurel, the new vice president, had announced plans for a general political amnesty

"Why suffer to make a big cor­poration more wealthy instead of working to make something better for your family?" asked Baldemar Velasquez, president of the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) last night. 
Earlier in the day, Velasquez an­nounced the suspension of the 7­year-old boycott of Campbell Soup Company products, during a press conference at the Center for Social Concerns. Notre Dame had en­dorsed the boycott for six years. 
The actual agreement was signed Feb. 21 by the Toledo, Ohio-based FLOC, the Campbell's Soup Com­pany and Michigan and Ohio tomato and cucumber farmers. A 1978 strike of 2,300 migrant farm­workers led to the formation of FLOC and the subsequent boycott. 
The agreement grants FLOC union recognition. For that reason, Velasquez said during the press conference that this agreement is a momentous one, not just for farm­workers covered by FLOC, but for farmworkers across the nation. 
''That is really all that the farm­workers have lacked over the years," said Velasquez. He said that every other U.S. worker-group has received union recognition, 

Aquino yesterday ordered the through the National Labor Rela­release of 33 political prisoners in tions Board. the Philippines. Story at left. This agreement sets a precedent for guaranteed improvements in living and working condiditons for 
farmworkers, according to Velas­quez. 
"Farmworkers are not unemployed. You are talking about hard-working American citizens. So the question is, if they are hard­working American citizens, why can't they feed, educate, and clothe their families from the sweat of their backs?" asked Velasquez. 
Velasquez said that Notre Dame made a difference in the boycott ef­fort and was the first major educa­tional institution to join the boycott. 
"When you boycott a product for six years, and you have students who can lead this and carry on the tradition, I think that's phenomenal and a credit to the students at Notre Dame," he said. 
Velasquez said that the Notre Dame effort must continue. "We have to keep this thing going. Campbell's should not be kept in an uncompetitive situation. We have to bring Heinz, Del Monte, and the other big companies in," he said. 
Velasquez asked the audience to write a letter to Heinz, Campbell's major competitor, asking for "negotiation," not just talk, with FLOC. 
Referring to Heinz, velasquez said, "It (a labor agreement) is go­ing to happen, these guys do not stand a chance. It took us six years to build the Campbell boycott, but we were nobody. It took us six years to get to the people in this country who can make things hap-

U.S. city maps at College show racially segregated areas 
Now in the near north side of the ci­ty there is a large black population that covers 10 square miles," Kenny said. 
In South Bend the problem of racial segregation has had a devastating effect in many of the city's neighborhoods, Kenny said. 
"On the southeast side of South Bend, surrounded by Michigan, Miami, Broadway and Sample streets, that neighborhood piled up with poor, black people. 
"What you find with this factor are landlords who really don't care about their tenants. 
"As a consequence of this situa­tion, an area that equalled 6,000 resident in 1960 was reduced to a population of 2,000 in 1980. 
"The housing in this area fell apart, and it was very difficult for black people to find jobs or get jobs because geographically they were separated from many businesses or other places of employment, Kenny said. 
According to Kenny this infor­mation will be helpful to students and professors of the sociology, government, and history depart­ments at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
The maps will be stored in the History Seminar Room, Room 350 of Madeleva Hall at Saint Mary's.

pen. What took us six years to do with Campbell's, we can· do in six months with Heinz." 
Souzen Deavers, a representative from Campbell's, had joined Velas­quez in praise of the agreement at the press conference. 

"We feel we can look forward to good labor relations in Ohio and Michigan," Deavers said of the agreement. 
Deavers said the boycott had no economic impact on the Campbell's Company, saying the agreement was finally reached because of Campbell's traditional commitment to the interestes of minorities and women. 
Later, Velasquez questioned claims by Campbell Soup officials that the boycott was ineffective. "They can say all they want, but you know very well there is no way they can measure how successful they could have been (without the boycott)," he said. 
Velasquez said that these com­panies, not the taxpayers, should be responsible.

Timothy Kenny, consultant for the South Bend Human Rights Commission, has compiled a col­lection of 700 maps indicating areas of racial segregation in cities across the country. 
The Cushwa-Leighton Library at Saint Mary's is now displayinga portion of Kenny's duplicated works. Milwaukee, Chicago, and South Bend are the cities that com­prise the Saint Mary's collection. 
"The overall collection took me five years to work on. These maps range from 1940-1980," said Ken­ny. 
"Onlv South Bend has a map for 1980 on display at the Cushwa­Leighton Library. Due to a lack of funds the government decided to put Chicago's and Milwaukee's maps on microfiche," said Kenny. 
He added that the Saint Mary's collection is a duplication of the original maps at his home. 
According to Kenny, he research­ed his information from U.S. Cen­sus Reports (1940-1980) and the Notre Dame Memorial Library Statistics Reports. 
"Blocks equalling a 50 percent or more black population are col­ored black. Areas with less than a 50 percent black population are shaded tan, and blocks with no blacks are left uncolored," he said. 
"The patterns showed that there are usually one or more predominantly black areas in most cities across the country," Kenny added. 
"The percentage of segregation is usually quite high in American cities. Usually this percentage varies between 70 and 90 percent. In some places it even reaches 98 percent," he said. 
Kenny said that there are no ma­jor differences concerning the rate of segregation in cities across the country. 
Each city that Kenny studied has its own segregation patterns. 
"The south side of Chicago, which now has a large black population, grew a great deal after 1950. Before the fifties the black area was only 5 square miles. By 1960 it had expanded from the Loop to 99th Street. 
"In 1986 this area had dipped down to the Calumet River where 129th Street lies. This land area ex­ceeds the land area of the entire city of South Bend. It is also densely populated. Three quarters of a million people live here," said Ken­ny. 
He said Milwaukee is an in­teresting city to study segregation patterns. 
"Milwaukee was one of the most segregated cities until after 1960. The black comprised the inner core of the city. 
"In the sixties many blacks were able to disperse to the northwest.

Senior StaffReporter 
Students had the opportunity to see the new Saint Mary's student computer center and to discuss with staff members the best way to utilize these resources at an open house and workshop yesterday. 
Complete renovations were need­ed to build the center, located in the basement east wing of LeMans Hall. "It was basically just a big shell with pillars before the renova­tion," said Peter Smith, associate professor of mathematics. 
The funds for the center's com­puters, a total of approximately $500,000, were provided by the College, Smith said. . 
The center, which is comprised of two student labs, currently houses a total of 34 computers. The microcomputer lab, primarily for those students taking the introduc­tory computer course, holds 21 computers. The terminal lab, which is connected to the College's main frame, holds 13 computers and is for those students with a minor in computers. 
The computers chosen for the center are the Zenith model 158, which are IBM compatible. "We got a good deal with Zenith," said Smith. The computers were also chosen for their quality. "They are a good computer with sound ar-

When asked if he knew whether 
the University was conducting an 
investigation, Luther said, "I know 
very little about it. There's not 
much I could tell you." 
Asked if the expelled student had 
left a list of the names of users to 
whom he had supplied drugs, 
Luther said, "I cannot verify that." 
A student from Lyons Hall was expelled for drug dealing, accor­ding to a source that chose to re­main anonymous. 
Lyons Hall Rectress Sister Jodie Screes said she refused to affirm that the individual was kicked out. She said only Student Affairs could answer the question. "I think you should get that answer from the horse's mouth," Screes said. She also would not say whether she was involved in the matter. 
When asked if she felt that a drug problem existed on the cam­pus or in Lyons Hall, Screes said, "I would rather not answer that." 
Father Gerald Lardner, rector of Grace Hall, said if a drug problem exists at Notre Dame, it "is analogous to the problem of closet alcoholics." He said that rectors and hall staffs are therefore going to be oblivious to the problem. 
Lardner said he issued a resolu­tion prohibiting the burning of in­cense in the dorm. The ban on in­cense lasted just one week and was voted down by the residents, accor­ding to Lardner. "It is not a current rule in Grace," he said. 
"We talked it over, and it was taken out." He said the initial reason for installing the rule was to prevent "the possibility (incense) was being used to cover up smoking pot." 
When asked how he has been in­volved with Security or Student Af­fairs with drug offense cases, Lard­ner answered, "I don't deal with Security at all. I have not worked with Student Affairs on drug af­fairs this year." 
Lardner said he believed most drug offenses are handled by the hall staff. "I don't think that comes as much of a surprise," he said.

For those students interested in learning how to use the new com­puters, workshops are available as well as a four-week course. The class entails the basics of word pro­cessing along with an introduction to using spread sheets. 
A two-hour workshop, taught by Dan Mandell, academic specialist at the center, will be held on Sun­day at 2 p.m. The workshop is geared towards those students who need a quick course in the basics of word processing. 
The center plans to expand in the future. "We intend to continue in­creasing the number of microcom­puters available to students," said John Cook, director of Computer Services. "Our tentative plans are to add more of the Macintosh com-

Board passes representative swap 
By ROBERT RAPHAEL 
StaffReporter 
Saint Mary's Board of Gover­nance approved a proposal to replace the current Christian Life Commission representative to the board with a Campus Ministry representative Monday night. The proposal came as an effort to strengthen the link between student government and Campus Ministry. 
"CLC (Christian Life Commis­sion) does not have the link with Campus Ministry that we want," said Anne Marie Kollman, student body president, who helped to write the current proposal. 
The Christian Life Commission is a student community that works to increase awareness of the need for spiritual growth and social ac­tion at Saint Mary's. The group sponsors activities such as soup kit­chen visits, blood and food drives and the mini-urban plunge. 
According to Kollman, the pro­blem is that the CLC does not have a direct link to Campus Ministry, but is rather an extension of Cam­pus Ministry. Because of this, stu­dent government is not able to ob­tain desired information from the CLC representative, she said. 
"The current system can be im­proved. It doesn't do what we want it to do," said Kollman. She added that student government would like information on Campus Ministry programs such as the sexuality education program. 
Cath Dahle, current CLC com­missioner and representative to the board, expressed strong support

for the proposal, citing that the CLC does not have full knowledge of the activities of Campus Ministry. 
"All three groups involved, stu­dent government, CLC, and Cam­pus Ministry, support the pro­posal," Dahle said. 
Sister Mary Turgi, assistant director of Campus Ministry and advisor to the CLC, also advocates the proposal. "We are unhappy with the way things have worked out and we know that student government is unhappy," Turgi said. 
"The goal of the proposal is ob­vious and good. Exactly how it is accomplished will have to be work­ed out," Turgi said. 
The proposal also provides for a service commissioner on all hall and class boards, just as these boards have social and athletic commissioners. Thus, the CLC will no longer be directly involved in student government.

He explained that incidents of drug use in a residence hall is usual­ly dealt with in the same way as alcohol abuse. On a first offense, for example, a person caught smoking marijuana in a dorm would be dealt with by the rector, as is the case with alcohol viola­tions, Tyson said.

But in the case of sales and distribution, Tyson said the deci­sion is very clear cut. "I don't know of any case where sales are involved that a student has not . been suspended or expelled," he said. He added that in these cases, there is very little chance that the student 
would be allowed to return to the University. 
Tyson said for other cases, suspension is not necessarily per­manent. "If a person has gone through a drug rehabilitation pro­gram . . . we're wide open to that student returning," he said. 
Goldrick said that after the Plan­ner and Keenan incident, in which several students were suspended, "the decision was made (to suspend them) on everything we discussed in our conversations (with them)." 
Goldrick said before the recent investigations he did not consider the presence of drugs a large pro­blem on campus. 
"Now that this has happened there must be some problem, but I dont't know the extent of it," he said.

Tarheels win over Virginia ending streak 
Associated Press 

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -Jeff Lebo scored 17 points -all in the second half -and Brad Daugherty added 16 to lead third-ranked North Carolina to an 85-79 Atlan­tic Coast Conference basketball victory over Virginia last night. 
The victory snapped a two-game losing streak for the Tar Heels, 26­3 and 10-3 in the ACC, and exacted some revenge for the loss to the Cavaliers earlier this season when North Carolina was undefeated and top-ranked. 
North Carolina, which trailed 37-33 at intermission, came back to take a 51-50 lead with 12:22 left before Daugherty was fouled by Tom Sheehey in the lane.

Grace dominates interhall hockey, undefeated Alumni beats Carroll 
By ORLANDO RUBIANO 
Sports Writer 
The interhall hockey regular 
season ended Tuesday as Grace re­
mained undefeated through some 
tough police work on Off-Campus 
Crime in their 3-0 victory over last 
year's champions. 
In the night's first match, Alum­
ni defeated Carroll by a score of 7­
2. Alumni (7-0) was the only other team besides Grace to finish the regular season unbeaten. 
In what interhall referee and var­
sity hockey player Pat Foley said 
was one of the best played interhall 
games he had ever seen, both Grace 
and OC were verv aggressive, and 
both received fine performances 
from their goalies. 
"We stuck to our game plan, and we forced mistakes," said Grace player-coach Jim Rataczak. "It is always an emotional game when we play OC since they have beaten us in the last three championships, and tempers flared but we kept our heads about us." 
"We played a good two-way game, and we felt that we had the edge offensively, We forechecked well, keeping the puck in their zone, which is our strong point." 

Grace goalie Phil Coghlan's first shutout this season came at ~" no­portune time as he continuously stopped numerous OC scoring plays, many during Grace penalty minutes. 
Grace scored their first goal after its relentless offensive pressure finally broke through the sharp goaltending of OC's Glenn Wagner when defense man Tom Elliott fired a shot from the blue line and right wing Mike Prendergast tipped it in. 
The second goal for Grace came off of a Tim Kirk slapshot as Rataczak chipped the puck past 
Wagner. In the second half, center 
Drew "Tripper" Spesard netted the 
last goal with a broken stick, as 
defense man Mike Marino recorded 
the assist. 
"We blew numerous scoring op­
portunities but still prevailed 
through our strong goaltending," 
said Marino. "The freshmen, in­
cluding Steve Bishop, played well 
as we outclassed OC," said 
Spesard , who had two tripping 
penalties. 
Grace will face Pangborn in the 
first round of the playoffs. "We 
have to take one game at a time," 
said Elliott. "We came together on 
defense, and we backchecked well, 
as the forwards covered on defense. 
We have to improve on rebounding 
around the net for easy goals." 
"Pangborn played Alumni tough, and they are capable of the upset because they have explosive players," said Rataczak. "We have to work on bench organization, and we have to cut down on the penalties." 
Alumni, the Corrigan League 
champion, will face Cavanaugh/Howard, the runner­up in the Krause League, at the ACC on March 6 in what promises to be a great playoff battle. 
Alumni features a high powered scoring machine to go along while giving up only an average two goals per game. Meanwhile, Cavanaugh/Howard favors a solid defensive style of play to comple­ment a well-balanced scoring at­tack. 
Alumni was never seriously challenged as they constantly hounded Carroll's side of the ice. Carroll (3-4) finished its season on a three-game losing skid. 
Alumni was paced by Pat Hogan's five goals, and Bill Harr­ington scored twice to account for the Dogs' scoring. Despite the easy 
win, Alumm captam John Kalten­
mark said his team will have to play 
better come playoff time. 
"We will have to come up with a 
complete game against 
Cavanaugh/Howard in order to 
win," said Kaltenmark. "Our 
backchecking especially will need 
to be better." If Kaltenmark's 
squad does not heed his advice, 
look for Alumni to be in the cham­
pionship game. 
Last Thursday night, Cavanaugh/Howard (4-1) secured a playoff berth by skating past Flanner (0-5) by a 7-1 score. Its vic­tory put the final nail in Off­Campus' coffin, as last year's in­terhall champions were eliminated from post.;season play. Jim Mejia led the way with two goals for Cavanaugh/Howard. 
Cavanaugh/Howard has one re­maining regular season game left to play against Morrissey. Flanner will try to avert a winless season as they take on Holy Cross/St. Ed's in its finale. 
Captain John Oteri of Cavanaugh/Howard is viewing the Morrissey game as a chance for his dug to fine tune its game. "We want to play Morrissey as if it were a play or game to get the guys in a good frame of mind," said Orteri. "I think we can beat Alumni if we play our game, this means the key for us is to play solid defense. Our most encouraging sign, though, is that we should be our healthiest since the beginning of the season, since we have really missed the ser­vices of some of our guys." 
In other games, Stanford (U-5-1) managed to tie Fisher (2-3-1) at 2-2. Zahm (4-2), who has played very consistent all season, won easily over Sorin (0-6) by a 7-1 margin. Dillon (3-3) finished its campaign with a 7-2 victory over Morrissey (1-3-1). 
NCAA head says recruiting is root 
Assodated Press 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. Recruiting is the only thing wrong with college sports, and alumni ahd boosters must be disassociated from athletic programs, NCAA Ex­ecutive Director Walter Byers said Tuesday. 
"The only weakness we have is in the area of recruiting," Byers told a group of sports writers and coaches who attended the NCAA's annual College Football Preview. 
"The contest, as I see it, is essen­tially whether the presidents and chancellors uphold the stewardship of higher education and set the policy for college athletics or whether a minority of unscrupulous coaches and inflam­ed, immature boosters and alumni are going to set policy." 
Byers threw his support behind a Southwest Conference amendment, proposed and then withdrawn at last month's NCAA convention, which would have limited all recruiting contacts to a school's staff members. 
Current rules prohibit what the NCAA terms "representatives of an institution's athletic interests"-i.e., alumni, boosters -from any off­campus recruiting. 
Byers called the action of the NCAA Presidents Commission at last June's special convention in pushing through tougher penalties for major rules violations "a good first half." 
He said it is "time now to move forward," citing the mood of most NCAA members as "a renaissance of a spirit and a willingness to con­duct intercollegiate athletics in an honorable fashion." 
But he said the NCAA needs help from its members in cleaning up violations, which he said will "never reach 100 percent purity." 
"The next step is to embrace at least the concept of the Southwest Conference proposal and remove outsiders, boosters, non-staff members from the recruiting pro­cess."

To The Staff Of University Food Services 
Congratulations on the Professionalism and Excellence displayed in your work for the 1986 Junior Parents Weekend. Friday night's "Broadway Comes to Notre Dame" was an extraordinary display of Food, Service, and Showmanship -4000 attended. 
The Quality of Food and Service provided to the President's Dinner was accomplished with Class -even though attendance was staggering! College and School Workshops-V.I.P. and Parents Receptions-numerous orders for evening Dorm Parties -were accomplished in the middle of all these programs without a hitch. 
The Closing Brunch on Sunday was prepared elegantly, though it was a cruncher with 600 more people than planned for. And the tremedously long hours put in by all of you, from early morning to the wee hours of the next morning, showed true dedication. 
MY HIGHEST ADMIRATION! YOU ARE A CREDIT TO THE UNIVERSITY! 
THANKS FOR ALL YOU DO FOR NOTRE DAME. William J. Hickey, Jr. Director of University

Engineering student 
Willis is Irish defensive stalwart 
By MIKE SZYMANSKI 
Sports Writer 

Lavetta Willis of the Notre Dame 
women's basketball team is the type 
of player who normally eludes the 
headlines of the sports pages, since 
she is a combination defensive 
specialist and student-athlete. 
"She is the unsung hero of the 
team who does a lot of little 
things," says Irish assistant coach 
Mary Murphy. "She draws the 
tough defensive assignments 
against either the big kid or the 
smaller, quicker guard. She blocks 
out very well, while doing the in­
tangible things. 
"And in another sense, she is comparable to (Notre Dame foot­ball player and stand-out student) Greg Dingens in that she majors in electrical engineering and has a large academic load. She misses some practices because of labs and such." 
Willis was academically inelligi­
ble for the latter portion of her 
sophomore season, but since then 
she has rebounded and made her 
presence felt for the Irish. 
She believes her own personal philosophy matches up pretty well with the team's. 
"I like defense and when I came here they pronounced defense as the way to win, and I got into that," says Willis, a 5-11 junior from Wayne, Mich. "On offense, you make all the moves, but on defense, you react to other people, and that is exciting. We are ranked third in the country in defense because every player is thinking the same way." 
On such a young team with many freshmen and sophomores, leader­ship from the upperclassmen can shape the character of the team. 

"Willis is a hard worker, positive in a quiet way, who leads by exam­ple," says Murphy. 
"She is an example in the classroom, showing that you can 

Lavetta Willis 

challenge yourself academicaliy and still compete well. And she really goes after -it when she is angry." 
"When I saw Trena Keys work hard, I wanted to work hard, so I try to set the same example," says Willis. "Engineering is something I really wanted to do, and the coaches are very understanding. When a round of tests comes up, I may miss practice, and they ac­comodate." 
For Willis, schoolwork always comes before basketball. When she was in high school, she registered and paid to attend the Five Star basketball camp during the sum­mer. But when she was accepted to an engineering camp at Ohio State, she deferred basketball camp and 
lost her entry fee. 
"What motivates me is the desire 
to do my best," she says. "In high 
school, I made basketball 
something I like to do, want to do, 
and take pride in. But I always 
knew that I wanted to be an 
engineer, especially after that camp 
focused my area of concentration. I 
know it will be hard, but I am going 
to do it no matter what." 
Willis came from a sports­
oriented family. Her father played 
basketball for Lane College, and 
was an important influence on her. 
Her sister Kim ran hurdles at Ohio 
State, coached at Michigan State, 
and is now involved in corporate 
physical therapy. 
"I enjoyed all sports and was 
very versatile," says Willis. "My 
greatest achievement in high 
school, outside of getting a scholar­
ship here, was first-team all-state. 
When you work hard, you want to 
be rewarded." 
The Irish coaches would like to 
see her improve on the offensive 
side. 
"Willis has to develop more con­
fidence in her offensive shooting 
and play," says Murphy. 
"I'm not confident in my offen­sive skills, and I cannot expect my teammates to be confident in me under these circumstances," says Willis. 
"I'm fine in practice, but I lack it (offense) in the game. I have to practice outside shooting because I'm not big inside. I cannot post up, so I have to play face-to-face. My hand injury earlier this season af­fected my shooting because I thought about it too much, but I'm over that now." 
Deadline for applications is Wednesday, March 12.

Interviews will be March 17-19. Pick up applications in the

Donald Royal matured into a steady contributor. This change, however, did not affect Dolan's powerful play underneath or the court savvy that he had built as a trademark over the previous seasons. And this year, the steady play has continued, so much so that Phelps feels that his big inside player may have saved his best season for his last. 
"Dolan has been to.the front line what David Rivers has been to the back court," notes Phelps....Where he's improved this year is scoring, as was obvious in the Marquette game here. His screens, his passing, and his defensive rebounds that lead to fast breaks all go unnoticed in the box score. But he's made us that much more effective this year." 
The soft-spoken Dolan agrees that his current role has made him a more complete player, and hopes his play can continue to mesh with his teammeates as well as it has thus far on the 20-5 Irish season.

Dolan. "My scoring has picked up (from 4.3 points per game in 1984­\ I 85 to his current 5.5 ppg.), and my 
I 
rebounding has improved. Once you get a couple of easy shots off 
rebounds you begin to build con­
fidence and take better shots. That should help the team because I can help pick them up or maybe take some the attention off the other guys." 
Drawing attention has been dif­ficult for Jim Dolan ever since he left his native New Jersey. There, he would trade elbows and sharpen his passing skills right on his

I winter, Boggs lost his bid for $1.85 million, settling for the club's offer of $1.35 million. 
Joe Marelle of Boston radio sta­tion WRUR joked Monday about starting a bottle and can collection 
to help Boggs after he had to settle for the lower amount, and within five hours the studio was flooded with bottles and cans. 

Nevertheless, the decision was an example of the seemingly more conservative attitude of arbiters \ this year. Other talented players '} I who lost out included Alvin Davis of Seattle, Ron Darling of the N.Y.
) 
Mets, Ron Kittle of the Chicago

.l 
White Sox and Gary Ward of Tex­\ as. 
i 
For example, Davis, the 1984 American League Rookie of the Year, hit .287 in 1985, with 18 home runs and 78 RBis. He was asking for $550,000, but had to set­tle for the Mariners' offer of $400,000. 
Some big names won their ca~es, of course, with Orel Hershiser of Los Angeles winning a $1 million salary, Charlie Leibrandt of Kan­sas City winning $170,000, and World Series MVP Bret Saberhagen of the Royals receiving $925,000. And if the arbiters were truly bent on keeping salaries, they probably wouldn't have awarded Dave Van Gorder of Cincinnati (who's he?) a $150,000 salary, $80,000 above what the Reds were offering. 
However, the events of the off­season seem to signal a brighter future for baseball. The growth of player salaries could not con­tinue at its astronomical rate for long before financial trouble would creep in.

Spiraling baseball salaries are coming to an end 
"It now takes a 36-month payment booklet to get a hot dog and beer at Fenway Park." 
-Boston radio announcer Andy Moes on how baseball's rising salaries have trickled down to the average fan. 
The time of year has come to turn one's attention to the baseball diamonds of America -spring training is here. But considering the complaints of many people, including Moes, that major league baseball salaries never seem to stop their upward spiral, it is interesting to take a look back at this past winter's contract disputes and settelments. 
It was, all in all, a year in ~hich the owners were declared ''winners" in the annual salary sweepstakes. "Winner" does not seem like the right term to use, since most owners had to increase player salaries yet again, some by quite a substantial margin. But there were a few developments that seem to signal that the days of the runaway baseball salary may be behind us. 
One could sense a change beginning last December, when Detroit Tiger outfielder Kirk Gibson charged publicly that he felt baseball club owners were con­spiring against him in his free agency bid for a new contract. Gibson, considered a top talent in the baseball world, seemingly had no offers for his ser-

vices coming in from other teams. 
This was certainly surprising, considering that in past yeas baseball owners had spent ludicrous sums of money on such talent as Darrel Evans (Tigers), Goose Gossage (San Diego Padres) and Bruce Sutter (Atlanta Braves). Admittedly, these players had proven their worth in the baseball world, but for some reason the money was not thrown at Gibson after a few outstanding years of his own. 
No strong evidence has come out showing that the owners collectively decided to keep their hands off Gibson. Whether it was an intentional tactic or not, it worked. Gibson was forced to resign with the Tigers on the deadline day, still claiming that he had been unable to test his worth in an unencumbered free agency market. 
Despite an overall free agency market which the players claimed was not as satisfactory as in previous years, there was still the arbitration period to look for­ward. But this year's recently concluded arbitration period brought results that further disappointed the players. 
Before the dealine on Jan. 15, 159 players filed for arbitration, a ptocess where an impartial third party decides after a hearing what a player should be paid. 124 players reached agreement with their teams without going through with the arbitration. Of the re­maining 35, only 15 won their cases and received the salaries they were asking. Twenty players lost their cases to their teams, and were forced to take the salary the team offered. 
In. past years, the arbitration process has seemed like a gift to the players, with most taking home huge pay increases. For instance, Boston Red Sox third baseman Wade Boggs won his case last year, and received $1 million tp play in 1985. And he played very well, hitting .368 on the year. But when it came time for arbitration this year, the tables were turned on him. In one of the most publicized cases of this
