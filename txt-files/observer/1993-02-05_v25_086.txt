Strossen: Pornograpy adverse affect 
By JOHN LUCAS 
News Writer 
Broader attempts to protect women from pornography and sexually-oriented material in the workplace would have an adverse effect on women and their struggle for further equal­ity, according to Nadine Strossen. former president of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). 
In a lecture at the Hesburgh Library Auditorium as part of the Student Union Board's "Thinking Anew" series, Strossen explained that at­tempts to protect women from pornography and material now being deemed "sexually harass­ing" actually hurts women in their struggle for equality. 
"Special rules designed to give protection undermine equality and reflect and rein­force a patronizing and pater­nalistic view toward women in society," Strossen said. 
A cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School, and cur­rently a professor of constitu­tional law at New York Law School, Strossen explained that the subject of harassment is suddenly a very current issue in the courts. 
"The issue of sexual harass­ment has become extremely timely, particularly now, one

Senate approves lift of ban on military gay's 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The Senate on Thursday approved President Clinton's compromise with Democratic congressional leaders temporarily suspending the formal discharge of homosexuals from the military. 
By voice vote, the Senate adopted the non-binding reso­lution that leaves intact the changes Clinton implemented last week, including stopping recruiters from asking appli­cants about their sexual orien­tation. 
Just prior to approval, the Senate rejected an attempt to turn aside the measure, 98-1. The lone dissenter was Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. 
The Senate immediately turned its attention -and was expected to defeat -a more­stringent Republican measure restoring the original ban. 
Clinton has pushed to lift the 50-year-old ban on gays in the military, but was forced to compromise last week in the face of Democratic and Repub­lican opposition. 
Senate Republicans waged a long-shot fight against Presi­dent Clinton's efforts to allow homosexuals in the military. Several Democrats likened GOP arguments to 1940s-era resis­tance to military integration. 
Democratic leaders were aim­ing for votes on both by night's end. The successful version would be attached to a larger family and medical leave bill under consideration by the Se­nate. 
Republicans, led by Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., argued that al­lowing homosexuals in the mili­tary would seriously undermine the quality of the armed forces. 
"We fear that the change in policy will significantly reduce our ability to field an effective military force," Coats, a mem­ber of the Armed Services Committee, told lawmakers. 
Democratic Sen. Carol Mose­ley-Braun of Illinois cited ar­guments from the military in the 1940s against President Truman's plan to integrate the services as a point of compari­son to such complaints. 
"The military has no more of a rational basis for banning gays and lesbians in 1993 than it did for segregating African­Americans in 1943," said the first-year lawmaker, who is black. 
Both Moseley-Braun and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., questioned the military's cam­paign against lifting the ban in light of its widely criticized in­vestigation of the Tailhook scandal, in which Navy and Marine Corps aviators sexually harassed female officers and other women· in September 1991. 
"If the United States military is truly concerned about the environment created by sexual harassment in the ranks, this senator suggests that the Pen­tagon start out by bringing to justice those involved in the Tailhook affair," Moseley-Braun said. 
Feinstein recalled that Oliver Sipple, who stopped Sara Jane Moore in her attempted assas­sination of President Ford in September 1975, was both gay and a former Marine. 

Family leave bill may be first to pass 103rd Congress 
WASHINGTON (AP)-With fi­nal action, the family leave bill would be the first legislation to pass the 1 03rd Congress as well as the first to hit Clinton's desk. 
Because of Bush's vetoes, Democrats said the bill's quick passage would demonstrate the end of legislative gridlock, now that their party controls both Congress and the White House. 
In addition, since it's designed to help working families, Democrats said it held ad­ditional symbolic value as an indication of Congress' priori­ties this year. 
The House passed the bill late Wednesday. It got temporarily sidetracked as the Senate took a four-hour respite to debate a Republican-led effort to block Clinton's plan to lift the ban on gays in the military. 
The White House urged the Senate to move forward. 
"The president has said he wants that bill on his desk," White House Communications Director George Stephanopou­los said on NBC's "Today" show. "He wants to sign it this week, and we shouldn't let it be blocked by legislative games." 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas shot back at those who scolded him for forcing the gays debate. He said the family leave bill won't 

Weigle awarded NEH grant 

By BILL ALBERTINI 
News Writer 
Assistant professor of gov­ernment Marcia Weigle will spend six weeks in June and July of this summer in Russia after receiving a $3,450 re­search grant which she has re­cently been awarded through the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). 
Weigle will use the grant to study the printed programs, platforms, and other documents of independent political groups which pushed for the democratization of Russia since around 1988, she said. 
Weigle said she felt that she received the grant because there happened to be "such a nice fit" between the topic of her study and the areas in which the NEH was interested. She considers it a perfect op­portunity for research, since NEH was looking specifically for research in archives that related to democratization in Russia and Central Europe, said Weigle. 
She has applied for many grants in the past, and that ap­plying is a skill in and of itself, said Weigle. It helps to have a precise project in mind or to use a grant to add depth to an existing project, she said. 
The title of her proposal was "The Intellectual Roots of Post­Communist Russian Liberalism: Programs of Selected Informal Groups, Labor Movements, and Political Parties," according to an NEH press release. 
There were sixty-four appli­cations for twenty awarded grants, according to George Lucas, assistant director in the division of research programs at the NEH. Approximately $134,000 was awarded, with the highest grant being about $14,000, said Lucas. The amount of money awarded was dependent on many factors, such as how many were to work on the project, the amount of time the project was to take, and the specific needs of the applicant. The application plans varied from three weeks to one full year, said Lucas. 
There was "fairly keen com­petition" for the grant, said Lu­cas. and Weigle's application was extremely well reviewed by various historians and archivists working for the NEH. 
"The impetus for the funding came from the recent opening of massive archives in the So­viet Union and Warsaw Pact countries," Lucas said. There are questions of 20th century history that could only be an­swered by the central archives of the communist parties, said Lucas. 
The fact that these archives were generally open to the

become law for six months so delaying debate for a half-day "I don't think is going to bring the country to a stop." 
During the gays debate, the Senate adopted a non-binding resolution that approves Clin­ton's compromise with Demo­cratic congressional leaders temporarily suspending the formal discharge of homosexu­als from the military. 
Before the delay over gays in the military, the Senate rejected two amendments by Dole to make the family leave measure less burdensome for business. 
One would have forced the government to certify that their costs wouldn't be increased by providing the leave; another would have exempted employ­ers if the cost of keeping up a worker's benefits while on leave was more than $7.30 a year. 


TriStar sets tentative release date for "Rudy" 
By BECKY BARNES 
Assistant News Editor 
One may not see quite as many pairs of sideburns on campus this semester, but no one should forget about "Rudy." 
Film producers told Richard Conklin. associate vice presi­dent of University relations, to look forward to a late summer or early fall release of the TriStar picture featuring the Notre Dame football walk-on. 
Chicago filming ended in early January, and the film crew, cast and several Univer­sity officials celebrated its completion with a traditional wrap-up party in Chicago, said Conklin. 
Crew members had nothing but good things to say about the film and people involved, Con­klin said. Director David Anspaugh told Conklin that the months he spent at Notre Dame were the "most enjoyable time he's ever had making a movie." 
All the crew were "very com­plimentary about the people that they met and amazed at the love that Notre Dame stu­dents have for the University," said Conklin. 
The film is currently in Los Angeles for editing and post­production steps, including the composition of an original mu­sical score by Jerry Goldsmith, the composer of the "Hoosiers" soundtrack. 
Everyone is enthusiastic about the success of the film, and the crew "feels very strongly that it will be a great movie," said Conklin. 
Although no decision has yet been made, it is likely the film will open in South Bend, as "Knute Rockne, All American" did, he said.

Military gay ban is discriminatory, rooted in fear

and policies protect Editor people. In other cases, however, policies simply protect some people's fears while denying others' opportunity. 
The U.S. military is one such case. The military fears the consequences of lifting the ban on homosexuals in the military. 

Military leaders say the ban protects gays from abuse they would surely suffer if they revealed their sexual orientation. Sadly enough, there would surely be beatings and even murders. 
Such violence is appalling, yet it will subside with time. 
Another small-minded military argument is trust. How can you trust someone if you know they're gay? Some people seem to think that gays have no control over their sexual desires. The most paranoid homophobes should know that. according to Ken Corbett, a clinical psychologist, "rape is largely a heterosexual phenomenon" (The New York Times, Feb. 3). 
Ind1~ed, I would be much more afraid of those that havn committed violent crimes of hate and ignorancn toward gays than any gay person. 
Another argument against the lifting of the ban is privacy, or in less euphemistic words ­homophobia. 
True, soldiers often live in close quarters and have communal showers, but physical privacy could be assured through partitions for showers and dressing. 
Is criminal violence and exaggerated fear sufficient justification to deny any group o people's right to defend their country? 
I say no. These arguments, however, do not tell the whole story. 
The military is the United States' largest employer, in which there are many well-paid profnssional positions, opportunities for advancement, health care and retirement benefits. Banning gays denies them these opportunities and benefits. 
There are other things being protected by the ban: 
1) the military's fear to recognize that there have always been gays in the military, and 
2) the potential cost to the military in lawsuits for violence and other acts of discrimination against gays if the ban is lifted. 
President Clinton has set a July 15 deadline to draft an executive order allowing gays to serve in the military. 
Although his timing in raising this contro­versial issue is questionable, the lifting of the ban is inevitable. 
This is an opportunity for this country to stay true to its ideal of equal opportunity in employment and stop being a slave to un­grounded fear, hatred, and discrimination. 
Such a change on a national level could spur tolerance toward gays at other institutions ­perhaps even our own.

NATIONAL Dinosaur is center of controversy 
 RAPID CITY, S.D. -A judge ruled a 65-million­year-old Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton was taken illegally by professional fossil hunters from Indian land held in federal trust. But he left unclear who owns the dinosaur. The Black Hills Institute of Geological Research, a private organization, found the fossil on land held by the government for an Indian rancher on the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation. A federal prosecutor ordered it seized last May, claiming it had been illegally removed. The institute, which paid $5,000 to dig up the fossil, sued to get it back. U.S. District Judge Richard Battey ruled Wednesday in favor of prosecutors. The institute said it would appeal.

Recognizing the symptoms of eating problems and treating them with methods that help persons who have these disor­ders is essential to the recovery of family and friends with eat­ing disorders, according to Chris Nelson, a counselor at University Counseling Center in yesterday's Eating Disorders Awareness Week lecture. 
"The important thing is to gather as many facts as possi­ble and not to attack the indi­vidual you suspect has a prob­lem," Nelson said. "But, you need to be strong enough to break through their denial." 

She said it is also important not to gang up on an individual if they have a problem. Com­munication between the indi­vidual and a close or influential friend works best, and the in­dividual should be encouraged to seek a professional's help. 
"If the individual doesn't feel comfortable talking to a coun­selor at the University, then we encourage them to seek help at one of the local hospitals," she said. "There are numbers you can call anytime in the South Bend yellow pages." 
Nelson said the three major eating disorders are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and compulsive overeating. Indica­tors of these diseases include: depressed mood, binge eating, intense fear of becoming obese and self-deprecating thoughts after a binge. The source o these problems ranges any­where from the individual's need for approval to anxiety. 
"People with eating disorders feel so overwhelmed that sometimes they can't cope with their feelings," Nelson said. "Consequently, they binge in order to relieve their anxiety." 
Nelson's presentation was held as part of the University Counseling Center's week-long program of events in recogni­tion of Wednesday's National Eating Disorders Day. 

Clinton near to attorney general nomination 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Presi­dent Clinton has narrowed his search for an attorney general to three people and the leading contender is Kimba Wood, the female judge who presided over junk-bond financier Michael Milken's fraud trial, administration officials said Thursday. 
"Tune in," Clinton told re­porters who asked if he was ready to appoint Wood to the post. 
A decision is expected within days, officials said. 
"The president has not yet made a decision," White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said. "To the best of my knowl­edge, he has not called and of­fered anyone the job. Now, in his heart of hearts he may have made a decision. I can't speak to that. But there is nothing scheduled tomorrow, and I don't expect an announcement tomorrow." 
She said the president was awaiting the outcome of routine background checks by the FBI.

She said a weekend an­nouncement was unlikely. 
Wood is a Democrat but was appointed to the federal bench in New York by Republican President Reagan nearly five years ago. Her confirmation hearings then were trouble­free. 
Others said to be finalists are Washington attorney Charles Ruff and former Virginia Gov. Gerald Baliles, according to two administration officials who discussed the matte on condi­tion of anonymity. 
Both rated Wood the favorite, citing a favorable interview with the president last week, Clinton's desire to name the first female attorney general and the fact that she already has been through the Senate confirmation process. 
Clinton's search was forced by the abrupt withdrawal last month of his first nominee, Connecticut attorney Zoe Baird, because of intense criticism of her hiring of illegal aliens, a vi­olation of immigrations laws the attorney general is charged with enforcing. 
A Bush administration ap­pointee, Stuart Gerson, is run­ning the Justice Department in the interim, but senior Clinton advisers are eager to get a member of their team in place. 
The names of Wood, Ruff and Baliles were shared with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden to make sure there were no serious objections, and none were raised, this official said. Biden's spokesman said his conversa­tions with the White House were confidential and declined comment. 
One of the committee's Re­publican members, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, said he knew of no GOP objections to Wood, Ruff or Baliles. "I think we'll have to wait and see the FBI report but I know of none at this point," he said. 
Hatch said it was his under­standing "they will have an at­torney general by the end of next week and probably before then." 
Biden has pledged to hold confirmation hearings as quickly as possible. The Senate is out of session next week, due to return on Feb. 16. 
Wood, 49, is best known for her handling of the highly pub­licized Milken securities fraud trial. She sentenced Milken to 10 years in prison but then re­duced it to two years because of his cooperation with prosecu­tors. 
Before being named to the bench, Wood's legal work ranged from representing poor families in class action suits to representing huge companies in antitrust cases.

Clinton to Jury selection begins in King case shrink

college aid 
WASHINGTON (AP) ­
President Clinton's plan to 
let college students repay 
education loans through 
community service will be 
phased in gradually, not 
launched as a nationwide 
initiative, a White House 
aide said yesterday. 
"It was always intended to be phased in, but I think the president's committed to it," said Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers. Clinton proposed a nationwide community service plan during the campaign. 
Myers, asked if Clinton would have to slow down action on the plan because of the tight budget picture, said the president has "had to reconsider a lot of his op­tions based on the higher deficit numbers." 
"Nobody expected the deficit to be $60 billion to $100 billion higher than it was last spring when (his proposal) first was drafted," she said. "That's one of the reasons the president has had to consider a broad ar­ray of his options and we're looking at that now." 
The Washington Post re­ported yesterday that Clinton would propose a pilot program to let some students repay loans with community service. 
The newspaper quoted presidential assistant Eli Se­gal as saying "the reality of the budget deficit" will force Clinton to delay his "dream" of a program available to all students. 
Segal said Clinton wants to avoid a "massive new fed­eral program" and instead is considering measures to strengthen some existing service programs and seeking aid from state and local governments. busi­nesses and nonprofit groups, the Post reported. 
As a candidate, Clinton said allowing all interested students to work off their college loans through com­munity service was "a sym­bol of what this campaign is all about."

Gang leaders pledge truce 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Street gang leaders from four major cities pledged a truce on Thursday and said they'll convene a broader gathering this spring so others can take the oath. 
Their so-called "summit" was set for April 30-May 2 in Kansas City, Mo., timed to coincide with the first anniversary of the Los Angeles riots. 
Nine representatives from black and Latino gangs in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Minneapolis met in Washington to pledge peace, pray together and plan the Kansas City meeting. 
"We have had 800 killings in Los Angeles County alone, and the majority were Latino brothers," said Daniel Alejandrez, director of the California Coalition to End Barrio Warfare. "We have lost brothers and sisters, and we are tired." 
"We are not going to buy into the concept of 'Once one, al­ways one.' no more," said Fred Williams. an ex-gang member who helped establish a May 1992 truce between the Crips and the Bloods, the two largest gangs in Los Angeles. 
"We must admit we have a problem first and remove the element of fear," Williams said. "Only if we work with our fami­lies and our children will we be able to have change."

The railroad has not yet been named as a defendant in the lawsuits filed by Allen. The suits name the Chicago, South Shore and South Bend Railway Co. Allen said that was a proce­dural move designed to initiate the legal process. NICTD also will be named sometime in the spring, he said. 
The South Shore filed bankruptcy in April 1989 and sold all its equipment to NICTD, which operated the trains in­volved in the crash.

WASHINGTON (AP) -Presi· dent Clinton, saying the chances for peace "can slip away aJI too easily," is sending his secretary of state to the Mideast to try to reopen Arab· Israeli negotiations despite the furor over Palestinian deporta· tions. 
"It is an indication of the pri· ority my administration at· taches to peacemaking in the Middle East," Clinton said In a statement Thursday announc­Ing the eight-day trip by War· ren Christopher. 
Christnpher was optimistic his first overseas venture wnuld succeed. "I think we will see a resumption of the peace process at an early date." he said while posing for pictures in his office with visiting German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. 
Clinton said "This is a historic moment," adding the peace process "can slip away all too easily." 
Christopher is due to leave for Israel on Feb. 17. Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said the secretary would remain in the area until Feb. 24, visiting Arab countries as well, and then make some stops In Western Europe before flying home. 
He plans to meet along the way with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev. They 
are expected to make prepara­
tions for a summit meeting 
between Clinton and Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin. 
Over the last two days, a se­nior U.S. official said, Christo­pher spoke on the telephone with Kozyrev, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel, King Hussein and Prime Minister Zaid bin Shaker of Jordan, Foreign Ministers Farouk Shaara of Syria, Amre Moussa of Egypt and Prince Saud of Saudi Arabia, Prime Minister Rafiq Harlri of Lebanon and Faisal Husseini, a leading Palestinian. 
All the leaders, including Husseini, reaffirmed their commitment to the peace pro~ cess "and the importance of getting back to the negotiating table," the senior official said at a briefing under rules that shielded his identity. 
But Riyad Mansour, the deputy observer for the Pales­tine Liberation Organization at the United Nations, told The Associated Press the Palestini· ans would not attend negotia­tions until the deportation issue is settled. 
"It is really difficult to see how the peace process could resume while Israel is illegally continuing with this position of obstructing the work of the Se· curity Council, .. Mansour said 
Police in India battle group 
BOMBAY, India (AP) -"Let it burn," a voice from the police control room told a street patrol as a Muslim shop went up in flames. But don't torch Hindu property, came the order. 
That and other secretly taped police dispatches are at the heart of a courtroom battle be­tween police and a human rights group that has accused police of taking part in last month's Hindu riots against Muslims. 
At least 600 people died and 1,200 people were injured in the nine days of mob fury that shattered the cosmopolitan im­age of Bombay, India's largest city and financial capital. 
Authorities kept no break­down of the ethnic identities of the victims, but Muslim news­paper editor Shahid Siddiqui said at least 80 percent were Muslims. 
Two threads of fear ran through the orgy of violence: that Muslims were in danger just for being Muslims, and that police would do nothing to stop the rampaging Hindus calling for Muslim blood. 
"The tapes show the strong communal bias of the Bombay police," said Asghar Ali Engi­neer, the director of the Insti· tute of Islamic Studies in Bom­bay. "This has been happening in Bombay for years, whenever there is Hindu-Muslim vio­lence." 
A reporter for Business India magazine who said she moni­tored and recorded police fre­quencies released an unofficial transcript to other Indian jour­nalists.

U.N.: 1,000 years needed for full sex equality in world 
GENEVA (AP) -It will take nearly 1,000 years for women to gain the same economic and political clout as men if current trends continue, a U.N. report predicted Thursday. 
And women are badly needed in top positions if the world aspires to make advancements in social equality, said the re­port by the International Labor Organization. 
"Women tend to speak with a different voice, which as a rule lays stress on the social ethos of development, that is to say ed­ucation, health, children, envi­ronment, dialogue and peace," the report said.

Currently, only six of 179 members of the United Nations have a woman as head of state, said the organization. Women occupy only 3.5 percent of cab­inet posts worldwide. 
The number of women in managerial posts, however, generally improved between 1985 and 1991, it reported. 
It seems like only yesterday ...

He told reporters that he didn't think the Clinton admin­istration had decided whether to push for a quick end to the Uruguay Round, six-year-old negotiations to reduce barriers to trade worldwide. 
The 108-nation bargaining is under the auspices of the Gen­eral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world trade body. 
"I don't believe the U.S. ad­ministration has decided whether that's their policy or isn't their policy," he said. 
The world trade talks have been snarled by bitter disputes between the United States and the community, mostly over farm issues. 
Brittan criticized a statement by U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown that the preliminary steel duties were imposed as part of an administrative procedure, not a policy deci­sion. 
"I don't find that an accept­able excuse," he said. "Those at the receiving end who are losing their market are hurt" either way. 

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP)­Jacques Delors, the European Community's top executive, on Thursday accused President Clinton of posturing with threats to impose punitive measures against the 12-nation trade bloc. 
"Mr. Clinton has shown us his muscles," Delors said in a speech to Socialist members of the European Parliament, the group's 518-seat assembly. 
"But we need to give him a little time to preen in front of the mirror to make sure that his muscles are still there," he added. 
The community has been an­gered in recent days by Ameri­can threats to bar the federal government from buying Eu­ropean utility goods and ser­vices and impose stiff duties on certain European carbon steel products. 
Delors' comments echoed earlier EC uncertainty about whether the moves represent a portent of protectionism in fu­ture trade policy under the Clinton administration. 
Delors said it was too soon to judge the new administration's approach to trade and other economic questions. "President Clinton has not really taken any clear economic decisions." 
The EC's top trade official, Sir Leon Brittan, meanwhile, played down chances for a breakthrough in the transat­lantic trade dispute when he meets U.S. Trade Representa­tive Mickey Kantor in Washing­ton next week. 
Brittan described the Feb. 11 meeting as a "first encounter" that was unlikely to solve a series of trade quarrels. 
"At the moment, we have to understand it's a new adminis-

Tough times ahead for GM 
DETROIT (AP)-General Mo­tors Corp. was having an ex­pensive week before an Atlanta jury Thursday awarded $105.2 million to the family of a teen­ager killed in the fiery crash of a GM,C pickup truck. 
The decision in the Shannon Moseley case could make it worse. 
"It's unfortunate that it comes up at a time when they are trying to turn the company around," said David Garrity, an auto industry analyst for Mc­Donald & Co. Securities in New York. "The financial aspects may be significant. but it's diffi­cult to quantify." 
GM directors on Monday de­cided to take one-time charges that will ring up a 1992 loss of more than $23 billion, an American corporate record. 
The United Auto Workers said Tuesday that as many as 15,500 of its GM members may take early retirement, many more than GM expected. But GM said it thinks the $450 million set aside in joint training money to cover the costs will suffice. 
However, the automaker's fi­nancial picture weakened fur­ther Wednesday when Standard & Poor's Corp. dropped the company's debt ratings. a move that will increase GM's borrowing costs. 
GM common shares plum­meted on the New York Stock Exchange after the jury's $101 million punitive damage award Thursday afternoon followed the compensatory damage award of $4.2 million in the morning. GM closed at $37.75, down $1.37 1/2. 
The jury award following a four-week trial brought analyst comparisons to Ford Motor Co.'s 1970s debacle over its Pinto subcompacts, some of whose gasoline tanks exploded when struck from the rear. Others mentioned the mid­1980s case involving the al­leged sudden acceleration of Audis. 
"I guess my concern here is that this kind of sets a prece­dent," said Chris Cedergren of AutoPacific Group in Thousand Oaks, Calif. "If you own a GM truck of that vintage and you had a problem like that, you're going to jump on the band­wagon." 
Other analysts discounted the long-term impact of the case, calling it more than a nuisance but less than a crisis and "another pothole in the road to recovery." 
"I don't think it was anything unanticipated," said David Cole, director of the Office for the Study of Automotive Trans­portation at the University of Michigan and a frequent GM consultant. "It's not the final chapter. Once you get into the appeal process, that's a differ­ent deal." 
Meanwhile, the National Highway Traffic Safety Admin­istration is considering whether to order a recall of the remaining 1973-87 Chevrolet and GMC C-K full-size pickups with "sidesaddle" fuel tanks. Critics contend the design made the trucks more likely to catch fire in accidents. 
NHTSA was watching the At­lanta case, the first over the is­sue to come to trial, before de­ciding what action to take.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Murder of an innocent child? 
Dear Editor: 
You printed a very interesting letter on Tuesday, Feb. 2. This letter was written by Matthew Cunningham, who is forthright in a way that many are not. In his letter he grants that the fetus is an individual "child." 
He says. "In the case of abor­tion, there are two conflicting interests; the mother and the unborn child. The fetus' 'right to live' is at times in conflict with the mother's right to de­termine whether or not she wants to reproduce." 
I find it very refreshing that Cunningham recognizes the existence of a conflict. that two human beings are involved in the decision to abort. 
The Senate report, 97th Congress, S-158 concludes that "physicians, biologists, and other scientists agree that con­ception marks the beginning of the life of the human be­ing...There is overwhelming agreement on this point in countless medical, biological, and scientific writings." (1st Session 1981, p. 7) 
But if the fetus is a child, then why does the woman still have the "right to determine whether or not she wants to reproduce"? If she has already produced a "child," hasn't she already reproduced? 
An even more disturbing question arises. If conception results in a "child," is it an in­nocent child? If the child is in­nocent then why isn't taking his/her life murder? Is the tak­ing of innocent human life ever an acceptable solution?

Mogilny, Bure can go head to head in All-Star game 
MONTREAL (AP) -For the moment, Alexander Mogilny and Pavel Bure can forget about their torrid individual scoring battle. 
The two will instead showcase their offensive talents at Saturday's 44th NHL All-Star Game at the Montreal Forum. 
Mogilny and Bure, 1-2 in the goal-scoring race, should be two of the more visible players in a game that has become strictly an offensive show. The past four All-Star games have produced a total of 65 goals, including a record 19 in the Wales Conference's 12-7 victory over the Campbell in 1990. 
Mogilny and Bure, the Russian stars, figure to be the stars of the game's goal-scoring barrage. Mogilny-"Alexander the Great" of the Wales Conference's Buffalo Sabres ­leads the NHL at the All-Star break with 50 goals. Bure -the "Russian Rocket" from Vancouver of the Campbell ­has 44 goals. 
Another featured performer should be Finland's Teemu Selanne. Selanne, a rookie with the Winnipeg Jets, has 42 goals in a season that has produced a wealth of outstanding European players. 
"I feel sorry for the goaltenders (in All-Star games)," right wing Mark Recchi, the Philadelphia Flyers' All-Star representative, said. "There are so many skilled players and so many nice plays made, it's hard to stop them, because everybody's creative in these All-Star games." 
Few have been more creative this season than Mogilny and Bure. Bure was one of the three Campbell Conference starting forwards selected by the fans. Mogilny finished fourth in the fan voting for the Wales Conference team, behind Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr and Kevin Stevens and Washington's Peter Bondra, but was selected for the team as a reserve. 
He was a more popular pick than some of the goaltenders. 
The picks, particularly that of Minnesota goalie Jon Casey, produced some controversy. George McPhee, director of hockey operations for the Canucks, was angry that Casey was picked and his goalie, Kirk McLean, was not. 
"We're flabbergasted," McPhee said. "I think it's an absolute disgrace." 
At the time of the picks, McLean had a 3.02 goals­against average in 27 games, while Casey, picked along with Calgary's Mike Vernon to back up Campbell starter Ed Belfour of Chicago, had a 3.21 average in 32 games. 
The reserves were selected by the general managers of last season's four division winning playoff teams -Craig Patrick of Pittsburgh, Bob Pulford of Chicago, Glen Sather of Edmonton and Harry Sinden of Boston. 

Of the three goaltenders for each team, only Belfour and Casey are among this season's goaltending leaders. None of the others is listed among the top five in goals-against average or save percentage -Vernon, or Montreal's Patrick Roy, New Jersey's Craig Billington and Ottawa's Peter Sidorkiewicz of the Wales. Roy is the Wales starter. 
Bure will be joined on the Campbell Conference frontline by Detroit's Steve Yzerman and St. Louis' Brett Hull, the top vote-getter. Starting on defense for the Campbell Conference will be Chicago's Chris Chelios and Det_roit's Paul Coffey. 
The Wales frontline features Jagr and Stevens and a player to be named to replace Pittsburgh's Mario Lemieux, sidelined with Hodgkins disease. Boston's Ray Bourque is one of the starting defensemen. Coaches still have to name a replacement for Brian Leetch, the New York Rangers' star who is out with a damaged nerve in his shoulder. 
The Campbell Conference beat the Wales 10-6 last season for the second straight year, but trails the series 11-5 since the current format was put into effect in 1975. 
Activities for All-Star weekend begin Friday night with a skills competition and oldtimers game at the Forum. Sunday, the NHL Board of Governors meets to 
-
discuss, among other things, the "Dream Team" concept of sending NHL players to the Winter Olympics in 1994.

Sliding Sonics continue slump 

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -Drazen Petrovic scored 35 points and put New Jersey ahead for good in overtime Thursday night in a 113-103 victory over the slumping Seattle SuperSonics. 
The Sonics dropped their third straight and fifth in six games. The losing streak is the longest for Seattle since George Karl became coach in January 1992. 
New Jersey blew a 19-point first-half lead and had to rally from five points down in the fourth quarter. Derrick Coleman had 20 points and 22 rebounds for the Nets and Ricky Pierce scored 26 for Seattle. 

Knicks 105, Warriors 101 
NEW YORK -John Starks, Charles Smith and Anthony Mason covered for the absence of Patrick Ewing as New York beat Golden State. 
Ewing, out with a hyperex­tended right knee, missed just his fourth game in six seasons. His status is day-to-day. 
Starks finished with 30 points, Smith had 20 from Ewing's center position and Mason scored 12 of his 16 in the fourth quarter. The victory pulled Pat Riley within one win or one Cleveland loss of his ninth All­Star coaching berth. 
Spurs 133, Pacers 115 
SAN ANTONIO -Sean Elliott scored 22 points and David Robinson added 20 as the San Antonio Spurs won for the 13th time in 14 games. 
The Spurs led by 33 points at one time and their starting five did not play in the fourth quarter. The 133 points represented a season-high for San Antonio and were the most points allowed this season by the Pacers. 
The Spurs are 18-3 under new coach John Lucas and have won 10 straight at home. 

Bird's number retired in Boston Garden 
BOSTON (AP) -Larry Bird donned his old Celtics warmup suit and, for one last night, chants of "La-reeee, La-reeee, La-reeee" rained down from an adoring, packed house at Boston Garden. 
For one last night, he domi­nated the parquet floor. The crowd roared as, once again, he buried 3-pointers, saved the ball by diving to the court and

passed the ball behind his back. It seemed so real to the fans who had seen it all for 13 years. 
But they were only memories, video highlights played on huge overhead screens at a 2 112­hour ceremony in which Bird's number "33" was retired Thursday night, hoisted to the dusty rafters on a green-and­white banner. 
Bird could do almost every­thing on a basketball court. He couldn't turn back the clock. 
So while the lights were down as the videos rolled, Bird would rise from his stool and stand as if the painful back that forced his retirement was acting up again. 
Bird, never one to back down on the court, finally gave in to the agony and retired Aug. 18 after a 13-year NBA career. 
The star-studded show, em­ceed by NBC sportscaster Bob Costas, was held as a separate event, not at halftime or before a regularly scheduled game. Proceeds from ticket sales, priced the same as for games, are to go to Boston-area chari­ties. 
Parades of his former team­mates, video greetings from ex­opponents and an extended

conversation with Magic John­son preceded Bird's closing remarks. 
"I never put on a uniform to play a game. I put on a uniform to win," Bird, who wore his warmups for the entire cere­mony, told the crowd in a pol­ished talk. ''I'm going to miss running the pick and roll with Robert Parish. I'm going to miss throwing the ball down low to Kevin McHale and watch him do his work. 
"Most of all, believe it or not, I'm going to miss the fans of Boston," he added. "Your voice, your excitement brought everybody to that level we needed to get over the hump. 
"I did my very best to please each and every one of you," he said. "Tonight, my basketball career is officially over and I had a blast." 
Then he took his 18-month­old son Conor from his wife Di­nah and walked with him to­ward the Celtics locker room as the song "Small Town," was played in tribute to Bird's rural Indiana roots and the number "33" rotated in green laser lights on the center-court stage he had left.

turnovers which resulted in 8-0 run, giving Notre Dame a 36-33 lead. The good continued as the Irish built ten point lead with ten minutes left in the game, thanks mostly to six points from Washington and six from forward Sherri Orlosky during the stretch. 
"Sherri gave us a great game off the bench," said McGraw. "And it took Coquese a while to get going, but a she got her game face on in the second half and really gave us a boost." 
Senior guard Jenny McGowen and Jenn Cole brought the Lady Explorers back with a combined eight point during a 12-2 run that was finally stopped by a timeout from McGraw and a bucket by Knapp with five minutes remaining and the score 52-51 in favor of La Salle. 
Both teams hitting a scoring drought with only a combined eight points scored in the next four minutes, but fortunately for the Irish during that times they were able to build a 57-54 lead. 
Two free throws by La Salle cut the lead to one with 56 seconds remaining, but on the ensuing possession Washington hit a 16-footer from the left side to lift the lead to three. 
A basket by La Salle cut the lead to one, but a missed three-point attempt by McGowen, resulted in a spree of fouling by the Lady Explorers. 
Orlosky's two free throws gave Notre Dame a five point lead with 20 seconds remaining, and despite a last ditch effort by La Salle, the Irish were able to hold on. 
"We showed a lot of poise there at the end, especially our younger players," said McGraw. "We had a freshman and a sophomore on the floor at the end, and they showed a lot of poise." 
Washington and Knapp finished with 16 and Bowen added 12. Tina Tunick led La Salle with 16 and Cole threw in 14. 
The win put Notre Dame at the .500 mark at 9-9, and also avenged a 69-63 loss earlier in the season at La Salle. But more importantly it ended a four-game losing streak.

"We've got to recognize our defensive responsibilities," said Irish alternate captain Dave Bankoske. "They're going to be hungry for some goals, but on the other hand so are we." 
"We're planning to tie them up and give them fits," said Irish assistant coach Jim John­son. A former assistant coach at Michigan State, Johnson de­scribed the Spartans as a strong, fast team with a very experienced defensive core and steady goaltending.

totally played like a team (since break)," said co-captain Kristen Crowley. 
Saint Mary's defense switched from a denied press to zone which caused the Lancers' passing to get out of control. According to Wood, once the Belles got their press in gear, the game came under their control. 
"We still haven't reached our peak but we're gaining steam," he said. 
Helping the Belles gain steam were Crowley with a total of 17 points, Holmes with 15 points and Snyder chipping in with 12. 
erything they can handle and more," said Notre Dame head coach Ric Schafer. 
The rematch with Ferris State on Saturday should prove to be very interesting as the Irish try to avenge a 9-3 whipping at the hands of the Bulldogs last weekend. 
"I think we've got a definite pay-back coming up," Bankoske said. "We're going to show we're a different team than we were Saturday." 
"We need to compete better," said Schafer. "The game is full of ten-foot and fifteen-foot races to the puck. We need to win more of these races." 
The Bulldogs are sixth in the CCHA with a 9-8-3 league record, trailing Michigan State 
three fencers with a combined record of 6-2 before this season, all of that competition coming from sophomore Chris McQuade. Senior Bernie Baez is in his first year of competition for the Irish, but boasts impressive credentials from his high school fencing experience. That squad is rounded out by Chris Hajnick, who began fencing sabre the week before Christmas break began.

But once again Taubenheim had the midas touch. She scored a season-high 28 points while notching six steals, three rebounds and two assists. 
"She's an angel from heaven, "said Wood. "She can do it all." 
Saint Mary's improves their record to 12-4. They play Goshen College at home next Tuesday.

by two points. Their 14-10-3 overall record has led to a ranking of seventeenth in the nation. 
"They're not a bad hockey team," said Schafer, "but it's a team we know we can play with." 
The Irish lie at tenth place in the CCHA with a 4-16-2 league record (6-18-2 overall). They are two points ahead of last place Ohio State, two points be­hind ninth place Illinois­Chicago, and three points be­hind eighth place Kent State. It will be crucial for the Irish to attain some level of the success in their fmal eight games if they wish to improve their placement for the CCHA play­offs. 
So how has all of that turned out so far? A 14-1 record. 
The women's team blends experience with youth. Senior Kathleen Vogt and junior captain Dinamarie Garcia give the Irish experience on the strip, while freshmen Claudette DeBruin and Mindi Kalogera, though young, have plenty of fencing experience to offer the Irish. The women are off to 9-2 start. 
So don't miss your chance to see Notre Dame in its only home meet of the year as they continue their quest for the national championship.

Men's track stars look to qualify 
By SEAN SULLIVAN Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's track team will continue its indoor track season this Saturday at Uw sixth annual Meyo Invita­tional. 
A talented liPid of 16 teams broke nine records at last year's competition. 
"This is going to be the best competition we've had all year," said Notre Dame head track Coach .Joe Piane. "The Meyo Invitational is very competitive in every event." 
One event to watch is the prestigious Meyo mile. Men's track team co-Captain John Coyle highlighted last year's competition. He ran the mile in 
4:05.56 and qualified for the IC4A indoor championships held in Princeton, N.J. This year's competition will feature John Waren from the Nike Texas team, whose best mile time is 4:01. Also competing in the Meyo Mile will be Mike O'Conner, a former Notre Dame all American. O'Conner returns to his alma mater as a favorite in the race. 
Another good competition is the men's sprints. Mike Miller, Lou Holtz's kick returner during football season, is the top sprinter for Piane. Miller missed qualifying for the NCAA championships in the 200 me­ters last week by one tenth of a second. In the Meyo Invita­tional he will be facing tougher competition than in last week's meet. 

"If he wins the 200 meters in this meet he'll qualify for the NCAAs," said Piane. 
"For most of these kids last week was their very first meet of the year. So this is a chance for our kids to open up and run fast and excel in the field events." 
Held at the Meyo Track and Field in the Loftus Sports Center, the meet is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. 
Herman pops question and big jumps 
By SEAN SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
Todd IIerman, the junior co­captain of the men's track team, had a great load off of his shoulders going into last week's opening meet. Just be­fore the meet, the high jumper from Linton. Ind. had proposed to his girlfriend. And just be­fore competing in his event he had received his answer. "Yes." 
"It took a lot of pressure off me because I'd been thinking about that for a while," said IIerman. 


At 8:35 p.m. that evening, Herman took off from ground zero and propelled his 155-lb. body seven feet, two inches in the air. The crowd roared. Herman had never jumped so high in his entire career. 
"I've never even looked at that height before," said Todd. 
Nor had the MCCs. With his jump, Herman set a new MCC record and provisionally quali­fied for the NCAA Indoor Championships. Herman was also voted men's athlete of the meet for this performance. 
"I jumped a little harder to impress her," said Herman. Herman has made a quick ascension to the top. 
"I came in not knowing where I would stand," he said. "It was really hard my fresh­man year. I really wasn't very good at all. I lettered. but just barely. Then, my sophomore year was a big surprise. 
So now it's wedding bells and cake for the Notre Dame track star. Maybe when people get donH congratulating him on his engagement they can reserve some praise for his high jumping feats. 
Herman thinks that he can go higher and at the pace he's im­proved the sky may literally be the limit.

Irish women face tough 
competition at Loftus 
By MIKE NOABUT Sports Writer 
Coming off of an easy victory last weekend at the MCC Championships, the Notre Dame women's track team will host the Meyo Invitational this Saturday at Loftus Sports Center. 
This weekend's competition, including Michigan, Illinois St., and Eastern Michigan, will push Irish runners to their limits. 
"This is the time in the sea­son that the ladies should really start improving," said coach Joe Piane, who was recognized last weHk as Men's Coach of the Meet, directing both the men and womHn to confHrence titles. 
The Irish will look for a strong performance onee again from freshman sprinter Erica Peterson, who last week sHt conference records in the 200 and 400 meter dashes in addi­tion to winning the 55-metHr hurdles. She was also a mem­ber of the rHcord setting 4x440 mlay team. 
Other key runners for thH Irish will be Sarah Hiley and Becky Alfieri in the mile and Stefanie Jensen and Eva Flood in the 3000 meters.

A Supplement to The Observer 
Making Things Happen 
Ryan Hoover is running the show for the Irish 
By RICH KURZ 
Associate Sports Editor 
It all happened sooner than he 
expected. 
Irish guard Ryan Hoover knew he 
would be called on to contribute heavily 
in this, his freshman year, but he didn't 
know just how much. 
Coach John MacLeod told Hoover while 
he was recruiting him that he would 
probably get about 15 to 20 minutes a 
game, but the role Hoover has played so 
far this season has gone far beyond that. 
Hoover has been the primary starter at 
the point guard spot for Notre Dame, and 
is the second-leading scorer for the Irish, 
averaging just under 10 points per game. 
"I wasn't really surprised that I was 
contributing a lot, but now as one of the 
key players, starting at point guard, it 
was kind of a pleasant surprise," says 
the freshman. 
But the point guard must be a leader 
as well as a playmaker on the court, and 
that aspect of the game posed some 
problems for Hoover at first. 
"I'm starting to get more comfortable, 
and the guys are starting to accept me a 
little better now," says Hoover. "The 
point guard has to have a lot of 
leadership, and sometimes it's hard for a 
junior or senior to take directions from a 
freshman. At first they were kind of 
hesitant about it, like 'what's he trying to 
tell us to do,' but now they're trying to 
acoopt me more." 
MacLeod is understanding of the 
potential leadership problems and says, 
"It's tough for a freshman (to be a 
leader), but not impossible." 
As for Hoover specifically, his coach 
said, "He's not a vocal leader, but he's a 
competitor." 
Hoover also had to get used to the 
players. "It's hard to give orders to guys I 
wasn't really comfortable with," he 
admits, "but now it's getting better." 
But leadership wasn't the only 
adjustment he has to make coming from 
high school to Division I basketball. 
Offensively, he feels comfortable, but the 
biggest difference Hoover feels is on the . defensive end of the court. 
"In high school I really didn't have to 
play that tough of defense," he says, 
"and now the other team is finding the 
defensive weak spot, and they go at it, and that's hurt us a couple times because I've gotten crossed up. That's what I need to work on-defense. Just holding the other point guard so they can't run their offense." 



That's going to be a major job for Hoover this weekend facing the Duke Blue Devils. 
"Hurley's probably the best point guard in college," Hoover believes. "In my view, he is the best, and he's going to be a real challenge for me." 
All in all though, MacLeod says, ''I'm very pleased [with him]. He's going through a normal transition; it's a major change from high school to Division I." 
Basketball hasn't been Hoover's only athletic love, however. Growing up in Roscoe, Ill., he lived on a golf course and developed a love for the game as a way to relax. 
He also showcased his talents on the baseball diamond and the football field. He was selected all-conference and all­area in football his junior year and was elected captain of the team going into his senior season. But he had to make a tough decision about his football future. 
"I told the coach I couldn't play because of the risk of injury and losing my scholarship. He was understanding. It was tough to give up because I had six or seven friends that I played with. My best friend was the quarterback and I was the receiver." 
Hoover was also a solid baseball player. A centerfielder, he was a two­time all-conference selection, and is considering walking on for the Irish, but the difficulties of playing two sports will probably keep him from doing so. 
"I'm still thinking about playing baseball, but it's real tough to play two sports in college, especially baseball and basketball, because they overlap. I've always loved baseball; I've played baseball my entire life. It's going to be tough to give that up." 
But basketball was always the first priority for Hoover. His father was a high school coach for 30 years. 
"I was always at practice with him. He never really forced me to do it, but I like basketball. Ever since I was little I can remember what a basketball was. I was always at his practices, dribbling a ball or shooting." 
His dad retired from coaching before Ryan entered high school, "to enjoy my high school years," says the point guard. But having an ex-coach for a dad helped with the college recruiting scene. 
"He really helped out a lot. When he talked to the coaches, he knew what to talk about," Hoover stated. 
It came down to Illinois and Notre Dame for ~Hoover, and he eventually chose the lrish, mostly for the chance to play right away. 
An added benefit has been the chance to play for MacLeod. 
"He's a real positive guy," Hoover says of his coach. "He's an intense competitor, but he doesn't make you feel like crap if you mess up. He doesn't dwell on it to make you lose your confidence, but he picks your confidence level up. That's a good quality for a coach to have." 
Hoover isn't exactly sure what he plans to study -he's leaning towards the business school -but as far as basket­ball goes, he's looking forward to the rest of the season, and the chance to play in the post-season. 
"We want to play in the NCAA's, but to do that, we're going to have to beat some top-notch teams. 
"But the NIT is a real possibility. That would be a goal for us, to finish over .500. Last year's team finished .500, and they got in the NIT and ended up making the finals." 
A measure of how far Hoover has come in the last year comes when he is asked about his favorite players. 
"When I was in high school, I looked up to Damon Bailey," says Hoover, "and then 'this year, I played against him. It's kind of weird, because you look up to somebody like that, and then you're playing him." 
Dick Vitale called Hoover a "Diaper Dandy" in the game against UCLA. With continued improvement and a few seasons of experience under his belt, that role may be reversed. He has the chance to become the type of player other high school kids will look up to.

People talking about Jon Ross for the right reasons 
By JENNY MARTEN 
Associate Sports Editor 
What is it like to be instantly recognized by 
everyone on campus, but not have anyone really 
know what your name is? 
What is it like to be mentioned in more Bookstore 
Basketball team names than Jordan, Bird and 
Johnson? 
What is it like to be stigmatized by your last name? 
What IS it like to be Jon Ross? 
"The thing that attracts the attention the most is that we are twins. Twins just attract attention. Being on a varsity sport attracts attention," said Jon Ross. "Students just have fun with it like at Keenan Revue and all. I can laugh at it too." 
But, Jon is happy that the boos and the negative comments are turning into the more encouraging "Ross brother, Ross brother" cheer. 
"It's just a matter of me getting more time on the floor and showing people what I can do. I'm going to make mistakes, but I'm going to work my butt off. It's good to hear the chant," added the Wabash, Ind. native. 
The 6'9" center spent his first two years in blue and gold in a backup role with the exception of ten starts in his freshmen season when LaPhonso Ellis became ineligible. In those years, Jon struggled on offense averaging 2.0 ppg and 3.6 ppg in the respec­tive seasons. 
The 1992-93 season has seen Jon mature in a more regular job and improve his numbers. Currently, his points per game average is up to 6.1 and his rebounds per game average at 3.8 is an improvement from his previous average of two re­bounds. 

"It's a great benefit to be on the floor because the previous two years there were not as many opportunities to play. You get in in spurts and it's hard to get into the flow of the game. Now, I can Th Ob /J k p

working on consistently putting the ball in the hands of 
the open player. 
Being the big man in the middle has given Jon the 

confidence and the opportunity to shoot more, but it 
has also gotten him into consistent foul trouble. 
"They bother me," said Jon of the fouls. "I don't want 

to be in foul trouble. It's good because most are 
aggressive fouls. But it is something I need to work on." 
Most referees seem to key in on the guy in the middle especially if he is bigger than anyone else. In games against the shorter teams like St. Bonaventure on last Tuesday night, Jon is the tallest guy out there. 
"When you are the big guy and bigger than everyone else, it's easier to see what's going on. They (the refs) watchdog the big guys inside in a game like this (St. Bonaventure)." 
If Jon should get a little too deep in foul trouble, the Irish have an almost carbon copy replacement in his brother Joe. The brothers are competing for the same position this year and which Ross starts is depends on how the teams match up. 
Joe will get the starting nod if the opposing player in the middle is bigger while Jon takes the quicker players. In the last seven games, Jon has enjoyed a hot hand notching eight points and four rebounds a game including a career-high 21 points against Butler. 
Having a brother on the team is not something that Jon is always conscious of. "When we are practicing, he's just another guy on the team," said Jon. "Before games and working out by ourselves, the brother aspect comes in." 
Identical twins might be a novelty for Notre Dame basketball, but for Jon it can get annoying. 
"It's something I've lived with my whole life. I'm not an individual. Whatever one does and the other does is smacked together. It gets frustrating," commented Jon. 
It is equally frustrating for the coaches, players and fans who can't tell Jon and Joe apart. Jon claims that his coach still cannot tell them apart and the fans just call him Ross or Ross Brother. In the Notre Dame media guide he lists his nickname as simply "Twin." 
This season, Jon Ross is using his improved play on the court to make himself stand out of the crowd and turn the criticism into cheers.

Mike Krzyzewski remembers first seeing Grant Hill's genius in his sophomore year at South Lakes High in Reston, Va. 
"I've always loved Grant," Krzyzewski said. "I believed in Grant before Grant believed in Grant. I saw him play as a sophomore and there was never any doubt in my mind that he would be a great player. The game came easy to him." 
While the game came easy, the confidence did not. But in his junior season the confidence-like national stardom-may finally be here. 
The process began as a freshman with Hill's play in the Final Four and continued into the summer during the tryouts for the Pan Am Games basket­ball team. 
"I did real well in the trials," he said. "Going in I didn't think I could make the team, but I went in with the attitude that I could be a defensive stopper." 
DUKE STARTERS 
Notre Dame vs Duke page 3 
Irish will need a lot of luck 
By ROLANDO DE AGUIAR 
Associate Sports Editor 
Big versus small, fast versus slow, great versus mediocre. 
Mike Krzyzewski's Duke Blue Devils, the two-time defending NCAA champions, versus John MacLeod's Notre Dame Fighting Irish, who lost to St. Bonaventure Tuesday night. 
Duke's starting lineup reads like a list of All-American can­didates. Indeed, it is a list of All­American candidates. 
The road may not be so tough for the Irish on Saturday, as Duke has lost a game each of the last three weekends. Of course, trends fade quickly. 
Duke starts probable All­American Bobby Hurley at point guard. Hurley, a senior, earned MVP honors at last year's NCAA tournament, and has been his usual quiet, productive self this season. The yin to Grant Hill's yang, Hurley is a small, unassuming player who rarely makes the highlight film. 
Then again, the most popular highlight of this college basket­ball season came when Hurley was leveled by a pick against Georgia Tech. 
Of course, Hill usually quali­fies for the Play of the Day be­cause of his own talent. Few will ever forget his ferocious slam during the 1991 NCAA fi­nal, the game which finally brought Duke out of UNLV's shadow. 
Along with Anfernee Hard­away, Jamal Mashburn, Calbert Cheaney and Chris Webber, Hill, as well as Hurley, has been singled out as possible Player of the Year candidates. The Irish 
Hill was a defensive stopper, but it was his role as an offensive starter that landed him on the team and increased his self-confidence. 
The growth process continued last summer-no trips to the beach for Hill-as he joined a Developmental Team of college players who traveled to San Diego to practice with the U.S. Olympic Team. 
"The one thing it gave me is confidence," he said. "When you play well against the best, why can't you play well against the Atlantic Coast Conference. The ACC is a tough conference, but it doesn't compare to the Dream Team." 
If Hill can add assertiveness to his already-imposing physical skills, the package may be too much for other teams to handle. Tops on the resume of the gifted junior is versatility. 
"Last year we didn't need (my outside shot)," Hill said. "It wasn't my speciality so I just worked on the things I could do. I've worked on it each year and this year you'll see me taking more outside shots." 
The main area in which Hill looks to improve is in leadership. 

"What Coach K means by asserting myself includes off the floor-being a leader," said Hill. "I'm a veteran and I need to be more vocal and bring a lot of stuff to the table that Brian (Davis) brought as far as hustle and hard work and leadership." 
"If anybody is going to assume Laettner's role its Grant," Krzyzewski said. "He's the guy who has the freedom to do anything." 
That freedom is confidence and that confidence is all that has been missing for Hill. He's got it now-and his opponents better be wary. 
"More of the attention will be on me," Hill said. "I look forward to the challenge of being looked at more. People will want to stop me more than last year, but it's something I'll have to deal with." 
Krzyzewski says, "If you have skills that you're ready to use, don't stand in line, come to the head of the line." 
Grant Hill should reach the head this year. Here's hoping the rest of the line can keep up. 
have already faced Webber and Cheaney, with mixed results. After holding Webber to seven first-half points, the Irish had trouble containing the Michigan sophomore phenom in the sec­ond half, as he exploded for 15 second-half points, leading the Wolverines to the win. Cheaney, meanwhile, scored a modest 19. 
But will the Irish be able to contain Hill and Hurley as they have contained other oppo­nents' superstars? The point guard will be Ryan Hoover's responsibility, and indeed one of the most intriguing matchups of the game is this: which ballhandler has darker circles under his eyes? In his biggest test of the season, Hoover was productive against Michigan's ultra-talented backcourt, leading the Irish with 23 points. 
Meanwhile, Irish defensive specialist Billy Taylor will have the enormous responsibility of stopping Hill before he can get too close to the hole. Taylor, whose defensive play outshines his infrequent offensive efforts, is the only Notre Dame player quick and aggressive enough to contain Hill. 
Thomas Hill, however, pre­sents another problem for MacLeod's team. An underrated player on the talent-rich Blue Devils, Hill is a contributor whenever the Irish take on Duke. 
Last season, his 14 points were second to Christian Laet­tner's 29 as Duke hammered the Irish, 100-71. The last time Duke visited the Joyce ACC, in 1991, Hill scored 18, right be­hind Laettner's 20. 
If Taylor indeed picks up 
Grant Hill on defense, then the Irish are left with a dilemma-who will try to stop Thomas Hill? Carl Cozen and Malik Russell may not have the foot speed to keep up with the elusive guard, while no one else in the lineup seems to have the size (Hill is 6-5, 200 pounds) to get in his way. 
Cherokee Parks and Antonio Lang play up front for the Blue Devils. Parks, a first-team high school All-American, will not emerge from Laettner's shadow until he himself hits a game­winning shot in the NCAA tournament. But the sophomore has been solid in the middle for the Blue Devils this season. 
The versatile Lang, a 6-8, 205-pound forward, will also give the Irish trouble, with his respectable combination of range and quickness. Lang also has the ability to make explo­sive bursts toward the basket when the Hills are elsewhere. 
Duke's lineup remains virtu­ally unchanged since last year. The only departure from the defending national champi­onship team was Laettner, who is now making a name for him­self around the NBA. 
Grant Hill has stepped up as the .next Blue Devil superstar, while Hurley continues his progress as a point guard. Thomas Hill, Lang and Chero­kee Parks complement this dy­namic duo perfectly. Even re­serve guard Marty Clark has budded as a player. 
For Notre Dame to down Duke Saturday, the Irish will need a spectacular defensive effort as well as the luck of the Irish.

Notre Dame looking to slay another giant 
By JIM VOGL 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Unlikely? Yes. 
Impossible? No. 
Notre Dame's chances of upsetting sixth-ranked Duke this Saturday are about as slim as a baseball expansion team winning the World Series this fall. But as history proves, you can't count out "the luck of the Irish." 
Notre Dame has a history of dramatic upsets on the hardwood, including a remarkable six victories against top­ranked teams in the past 15 years. 
This season, Notre Dame under­manned, inexperienced squad played tough against Indiana {ranked fifth at the time) and UCLA, only to come up short in the linal seconds. Though the Irish are inconsistent, signs of hope do exist. 
John MaeLeod followed in the tradition of Digger Phelps in preparing the Irish for matehups against ranked opponents. Despite a hum-drum 18-15 record, the squad became known as "Giant Killers," as they knocked off ranked opponents: USC {25th), North Carolina (eighth), Syracuse {tenth), UCI.A {second) and St. Johns {20th). 
Here is a record of memorable basketball upsets in Notre Dame basketball history: 
Feb. 22, 1992: Irish 84, UCI.A 71. Irish fans had developed faith in the old saying "anything can happen." 
That day, Daimon Sweet made things happen, scoring a team-high 25 points against All-American Tracy Murray. 
Notre Dame jumped out to a 40-33 halftime lead. UCLA quickly tied the score at 46 with 14:53 to play, but the Irish out-scored the Bruins 20-4 for the remainder of the game for the win. 
For vintage Irish fans, the upset revived the spirits of perhaps Notre

Dame's most memorable game ever. 
Jan. 19, 1974: Irish 71, UCLA 70. 
Dwight Clay capped a miraculous Irish comeback by sinking a fall-away jumper with :29 to go, as the second-ranked Irish toppled top-ranked UCLA and snapped college basketball's record winning streak. 
Clay, blanketed by UCLA's Tommy Curtis, threw up a bullseye 12-footer from the right baseline that 
consummated a run of 12­unanswered points by Notre Dame. 
The Bruins, who built up a 17­point lead in the first 14 minutes of the game with a phenomenal 19-of-27 shooting, shot five more times. But none of John Wooden's sharp-shooters could put it in to keep their 88-game winning streak alive. 
Bill Walton, the 6'11" red­beaded All-American center who led his team with 24 points, missed only two shots all day. But his second misfire, a frantic put-back with :06 to go, brought hoards of fans onto the Athletic and Convocation Center floor in a hysterical celebration. 
"The only thing I know," senior John Shumate explained, "is that I got crowded, bombarded. I could hardly breathe down there." 
"It's special for college bas­ketball. It's special for every­one," announced a drained

Duke has dominated Irish Notre Dame has not won since 1987 

hoisting a banner that said, "Dear John Wooden, God DID make Notre Dame No. 1 Sincerely, Paul {Bear) Bryant." 
The monumental victory came in the wake of the football team's dramatic 24­23 win over top-ranked, undefeated Alabama in the Orange Bowl. Ara Parseghian led his team to a perfect 12­0 record and the 16th National Championship in Irish history. 
Jan. 25, 1975: Irish 84, UCLA 78. 
In his last year of collegiate coaching, the legendary Wooden captured one linal National Championship. But along the way, Digger Phelps masterminded another upset at the ACC with help from Adrian Dantley, who scored 32 points for the Irish. 
In the following two seasons of this historic rivalry, Phelps masterminded two more upsets. 
Feb. 16, 1990: Irish 66, Syracuse 65. In the game of basketball, one second can mean a lifetime. 
The replay of Elmer Bennett's 20­footer will remain in the Notre Dame recruiting videos for a lifetime, and will haunt Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim endlessly. 
With :03 remaining, Keith Robinson hurled an inbound pass to LaPhonso Ellis at half-court; Ellis' relay hit Bennett at the top of the key; and Bennett, catching and firing in one motion, hit nothing but net to boost the Irish over fourth-ranked Syracuse in the frenzied Carrier Dome. 
"We've diagrammed that thing and worked on that thing for four years," Phelps said. "The last time we practiced it was over the holidays." 
Immediately after Billy Owens' shot went through the net with three seconds showing on the clock, Phelps called time-out. The clock showed :02. Phelps lobbying produced one additional second, which made all the difference. 
The win broke Syracuse's four-year home winning streak and gave the Irish seniors their first road win against a ranked opponent. 
Feb. 26, 1978: Irish 65, Marquette 59. 
"We've had some great comeback victories, but this has to rank as one of our best," proclaimed Digger Phelps, who compared it to the monumental UCLA game in 197 4. 
The Irish recovered from a 14-point halftime deficit to down the number-one ranked Warriors. Kelly Tripucka led the squad with 15, while Bill Hanzlik's defensive pressure shut down Marquette's Butch Lee on 6-of-19 shooting. 
Feb. 27, 1980: Irish 76, DePaul 74 (2 
OT). 
Orlando Woolridge's two clutch free throws with 19 seconds left in the second overtime clinched the victory for Notre Dame over the top-ranked Blue Demons. 
Hanzlik grabbed the rebound of Terry Cummings' miss with 1:55 to go. Then Phelps, employed the infamous pre-shot clock strategy-the four-corner stall. 
When Marquette got the ball back, they could manage only an 18-foot attempt by Jim Mitchem, their center playing with two broken lingers in his left hand. Clyde Bradshaw's desperate put-back attempt of the long rebound caromed off as the buzzer sounded. 
In order to beat Duke tomorrow, the Irish will need to wake up the echoes of these and other historic upsets.

Sports Editor 
The Duke series has not been kind to Notre Dame. 
The Blue Devils have dominated the Irish, the way Irish have dominated Valparaiso. 
In 16 meetings, Notre Dame has come away with only two victories, the last of which came in the Reagan administration. In February, 1987, the Irish topped the Blue Devils 70-66 in overtime. 
The only other Irish win was a 87-68 decision during the 1973-7 4 campaign. 
The most significant game in the history of this series occurred at the 1978 Final Four. 
Thisgame featured future NBA players like Kelly Tripucka and Bill Laimbeer for the Irish and Jim Spanarkel and Mike Gminski for the Devils. 
Notre Dame almost turned in one of the greatest comebacks in NCAA history, as they made a frantic second-half run without the advantage of the three-point shot and 45-second clock. 
Trailing by 14 with 3:55 left, the Irish put together a 20-8 run to pull within two. But the comeback came up short as Duck Williams missed a 22-footer with 18 seconds left. 
Duke's John Harrell then sunk two free throws to ice the 90-86 Duke win. 
The two teams began to meet annually in the 1984-85 season, and since then the Blue Devils have won eight of nine contests including last year's 100-71 
demolition of the Irish.

RICH KURZ 
Happy Happy, Joy Joy 
Fencing meet showcases most talented Irish team 
What, you might ask, is the winningest 
sports program in Notre Dame history? 
The obvious first guess is football. It's 
also wrong. After that the list of 
possibilities is wide open, but the right 
answer is the fencing team. Including 
this season, the Irish men's all-time 
record stands at S45 wins, 95 losses 
and two ties. for a .897 winning 
percentage. The women's team, in 
existence since women were first 
admitted to the University in 1972, has 
an all-time mark of 287-63. 
The fencing program may just be the 
secret of the athletic department. Since 
1982, the men haven't finished lower 
than fourth place in the NCAA 
Championships, winning the national 
championship in 1986 and finishing 
second three times, most recently in 
19SS. . 
Notre Dame's women's team has won 
the national championship twice, 
repeating in 1987 and '88. Three of the 
last seven individual champions have 
fenced for the Irish, including Molly 
Sullivan, who won it twice and went on 
to the U.S. Olympic Team. 
So far this season, the men are off to 
a 14-1 start. They defeated defending 
national champion Columbia before 
falling to Princeton last Sunday. The 
women are 9-2. 
This weekend the Irish are at the 
Joyce ACC, in the fieldhouse section 
next to the hockey rink, for their only 
home meet of the season. The women 
will fence five teams, the men four. 
In the first round of the day, Notre 
Dame will fence Cleveland State at 9:00 
a.m., before taking on Case Western at 
10:30. The most important meet of the day for the Irish is scheduled to begin at noon. with the Irish facing the Ohio State Buckeyes. a traditionally tough team. As one of the stronger teams in the Midwest, a victory over the Buckeyes is important to the Irish ehances for an NCAA bid. 
Notre Dame's men's team ends the day fencing Northwestern at 1:30, but the women have another match after the Wildeats, taking on Lawrence 
Univt~rsity. 
This season started ofT as something 
for a question mark for the Irish. The 
foil squad. captained by senior Jeff 
Piper, lost two starters from last year's 
team and starts Stan Brunner. in his 
first year of eompeting for Notre Dame 
and a former epeeist, Hian Girard, who 
switched hack to foil to give the squad 
depth. 
The epee team lost two-time All­
American David Calderhead, but 
returns solid support in Gzegorz 
Wozniak. a potential All-American, 
plus Per Johnsson and Geoff Pechinsky. 
The sabre team lost all three starters 
from last season, including All­
American .lames Taliaferro. and starts

The Notre Dame men's and women's fencing teams host their only home meet of the year this Saturday, as the Irish square off against Cleveland State, Case Western, Ohio State, and Northwestern. 
Ohio State will be a formidable opponent for both the men (14-1) and women (9-2). On the women's side, Ohio State and Notre Dame are bat­tling for the top spot in the Midwest as the season winds down. 
"Ohio State will be the toughest team we fence this weekend," said captain Kathleen Vogt. "I think we'II do very well if we fence the same way

The Notre Dame women's basketball team played last night like it has all season: great at times and poor at others. 
Unlike past games this season. the great times last night occurred frequently enough to give the Irish a win. 61-58 over LaSalle at the Joyce Center. 
 see Commentary, page 20 
The good came first, in the form of junior forward Kristin Knapp, who scored Notre Dame's first three baskets . The bad followed quickly as LaSalle was able to victimize a stagnant Irish defense, keeping the game close, and eventually allowing the the Lady Explorers to take a a 31-24 lead, which was cut to 33-28 at the half. 
Notre Dame was able to minimize the effect of their defensive inadequacies in the first half by pounding the ball into Knapp and Letitia Bowen, who scored 22 of the Irish's points. Knapp netting a team-high 14. 
"We felt as though they couldn't contend with us on the blocks," said Irish coach Muffet McGraw,"and we were a little cold from the outside." 
The good reappeared to start the second when senior guard Coquese Washington and freshman Stacy Fields hounded La Salle for four quick

we've been fencing." 
The men also face a challenge against the Buckeyes. 
"They are strong in sabre, which happens to be our weakest weapon," said men's coach Mike DeCicco, " but I like to think that our foil and epee are equally competitive with them." 
DeCicco said that an upset by the sabre team may be the only hope against the Buckeyes. But the sabre team already has one upset under their belts, with their victory over Columbia last weekend. The sabremen will rely on Bernie Baez, who has compiled a 33-11 record on the season. 
Northwestern could prove to be the class of the field, however. They are enjoying an out­standing season. According to DeCicco, the men have an extremely balanced attack from all three weapons, while the women are coming off of a competitive battle with defending women's national champion Penn State. 
"This is the most critical weekend of the season for us," said DeCicco.

In an attempt to rebound from last weekend's collapse, the Notre Dame hockey team will shoot for success in games tonight and tomorrow night against Michigan State and Ferris State, respectively. 
The Irish will play first at Munn Arena in East Lansing, Mich. versus the Spartans before returning to the Joyce Fieldhouse on Saturday for a rematch with the Bulldogs. 
The Spartans, who hold a 15-10-1 overall record and a 11-7-1 league record, are ranked ninth in the nation and fifth in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. They have been able to rely on the outstanding play of center Bryan Smolinski, who leads the CCHA in both league scoring (17 goals-16 assists­33 points) and overall scoring (22-26-48). 

Michigan State defeated the Irish 8-4 at the JACC last November in the teams' only meeting. After a crushing 11-1 loss to the University of Michigan last Saturday, the Spartans will likely be thirsting for a big
