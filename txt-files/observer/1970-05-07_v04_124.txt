Many miss class due to protests 
(UPI) -Hundreds of thou­sands of college students stayed out of classes on campuses throughout the nation yesterday in clamorous protests against the nation's military policies and the killing of four students at Kent State University. 
Gov. Ronald Reagan an­nounced that the University of California's nine campuses and the state's 18 state colleges would close down from mid­night Wednesday through Sun­day in the face of "emotional turmoil." 
The Texas state capitol was evacuated and hundreds of armed Texas Rangers, state troopers and Austin police guarded it against renewal of attacks by University of Texas students. 
In Illinois, Gov. Richard B. Ogilvie ordered 5,000 National Guard troops to the Champaign Urbana campus of the University of Illinois to quell student disturbances. 
National Guardsmen moved back onto the University of Wisconsin campus, where bands of students marched and shout­ed after a mass rally. The Guardsmen used tear gas Tues­day to disperse rock throwing students. 
The hastily organized Na" tiona! Strike Center at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., reported strikes were under way at 240 colleges and universities. Half of the affected schools are in New England and New York State. 
District of Columbia police fired dozens of canisters of tear gas at rock and bottle hurling student demonstrators at Ameri­can University in Washington. One student suffered a broken leg, two policemen were injured by flying missiles and at least 14 students were iniured. 
Three university of Mexico students were stabbed -none seriously -in a fight over whether to raise or lower the 
U.S. flag in memory of four Kent State University students. 
Most of the strikes and demonstrations were peaceful. At many schools, only scores or hundreds out of thousands of students were participating. Classes went on normally at hundreds of colleges. But scores of presigious universities had shut down for the day, for the rest of the week and in the case of a few ·for the rest of the academic year. 
Firebombings of ROTC of­fices or other buildings shook some campuses. Buildings were occupied on a few campuses and held by students. 
Evacuation of the Texas capi­tol was ordered by Gov. Preston Smith after a bomb threat was telephoned to security guards and student protesters gathered for a campus rally and threaten­ed a march on the capitol. Police Tuesday hurled tear gas bombs into ranks of screami:1g, chant­ing demonstrators who stormed around the capitol and marched downtown. 
Two New York high schools were--closed and dozens of others reported meager attendance yesterday as thou­sands of secondary school stu­dents joined the nationwide anti-Vietnam War protest mounted by college students. 
Faculty endorses Hesburgh 
In an extraordinary special session yesterday, the faculty voted 21 7 to 134 to support the declaration of Notre Dame Presi­dent Fr. Theodore llesburgh concerning the war in Vietnam and the invasion of Cambodia. 
Included in the resolutin was an appeal to Fr. Hesburgh to travel to Washington to present the declaration in person and, if possible be accompanied by presidents of other universities. The entire resolution follows: 
The faculty uf the University uf Nutre Dame, conscious uf the need for both urder and effec­tive actiun in this extraordinary mument in our histury, and hm,ing met in extraordinary sessiun, hereby publicly expesses its suppurt fur the Declaration made by the President of the University un May 4, 1970 concerning the war in Vietnam and the invasion of Cambodia, and it askes the President of the University, in cuncert with re­presentatives uf uther universi­ties ifpussib/e, tu gu tu Washing­tun in order to present the Declaration tu the appropriate officers of the Congress and tu urge the Congress to undertake, in pursuance ofits cunstitutiunal responsibilities, a comprehensive and fundamental debate on the

STRIKE MEETING 
by Dave Kahn 
Student !Midy President Dave Krashna, chairman of the strike agenda committee, last night called an emergency session of all strikers to meet tonight at 8:00 p.m. in Stepan 
Center. 
Earlier at an ad hoc meeting to determine the direction of the strike, Krashna, in an attempt to consolidate leadership appointed Mark Winings, Jim Leary, Walt Williams, Fred 
Dedrick, Chris Ottenweller, Professors John Houck and William Storey to an agenda committee for the strike meeting tonight. Houck and Storey supported the action but declined membership because they felt the students should manage their own affairs. 
Krashna adjourned the ad hoc meeting and an a pnvate session with the new agenda committee established a single proposal to be set forth at the strike meeting for student appraisal and vote. 
The proposal reads as follows: The Notre Dame Student Strike should be extended to Friday, May 15 in order to achieve the following measures: 
1) Student support and petitioning for Father Hesburgh's attack on President Nixon's Southeast Asian policy. 
2) The establishment of a Communiversity which would program films, teach-ins, seminars, etc. which pertain to all relevant issues. Furthermore, the ~ommuniversity would

The march began after a few preliminary instructions from Student Body President Dave Krashna and other strike leaders. Krashna also read a proposal directed to Father Theodore Hesburgh calling for the paid suspension of University workers Friday for the purpose of joining the strike. 
The rally opened wfth a speech from Jim Engel, who recently returned from harvest­ing sugar in Cuba. He spoke on the development of the "third world" and the present revolu­tion in America.

1000 hear Strike Mass 
by Mike Chapin 
"Once the hand is laid on the plow anyone who looks back shall never see the kingdom of God," quoted Father Burrell from the gospel at the concel­brated Mass on the main quad yesterday afternoon. He said the students who have moved for the disruption in the normal proceedings because of their concern over the war have committed themselves to live by the spirit of their actions. 
Burrell gave his sermon to a crowd of over I,000 persons sitting around a makeshift altar. His sermon was preceded by a reading from Thomas Merton by Father Amen. The emphasis of the reading was on the importan­ce of finding one's self and being true to one's convictions. 
A small band played folk tunes during the Mass. The crowd was particularly moved when they played "The Great

troops. 
She said, "We were going to have a rally at 12:00...We were sitting in a circle on a hill. The national guard came down in jeeps saying 'disperse'." 
A short time later, she said, the troops started lobbing tear gas canisters into the crowd. "Then finally," she stated, "the troops lined up and marched toward us." 
Then she sobbed, "All of a sudden they just turned around and fired." 
A close friend of hers, she said, cradled one of . the dying students, but there was no hope because "his face was blown away." 
Her talk was followed by a high school student and Charles Murphy, a member of the South Bend Council of Churches. 
Rev. Murphy told the crowd, "What you are doing today is exactly what the church should be doing...l look at you and say, 'this is beautiful'." lie concluded his speech by symbolically pointing a gun toward Washing­ton and President Nixon. On the gun was inscribed the single 
word, "Shalom," which means "peace" in Hebrew. "My only message today," he said, "is 'peace'." 
Faculty members William Storey and James Massey spoke next on the faculty endorsement 
of Hesburgh 's declaration con~

in the Indo-China war1 which 
had received 1433 signatures by

The statement was released in behalf of the Committee for Academic Freedom. 
Hunter further revealed that he, Dr. Emil T. Hoffman, and some people yet to be determin­ed would speak before the Alumni Senate on Friday. "We will speak before the Senate whether classes are called off on Friday or not," Hunter said, "because we don't want the University to do anything like this again." 
Hunter suggested the possibili­ty of "non-violent demonstra­tions" in · the Administration building if the Administration continued to close classes be­yond the presently planned limits. 
''I'd really like to see them invoke the fifteen-minute rule against us," Hunter commented. "They couldn't do it. How could they accuse us of disrupting the process of education or denying the rights of others when they had already disrupted the pro­cess of education and denied the rights of others?"

the Government Department led off the spekers in support of the resolution. He saw two basic points at issue -the vilidity of the points and the propriety of making a statement. With regard to the latter, he admitted that in the past he had urged faculty. and students alike to avoid making the university a center of activism. However he feels that the university today is not like it was in the past. It is no longer a reflective, speculative, and con­
templative place. 
Restricting himself to the issue of the U.S. entry into Cambodia, Professor William T. Liu of the Sociology Depart­ment also saw reason for a yes vote. In his opinion, the main point is that America cannot win the war. He said that the Chinese communists proved the effec­tiveness of guerrila warfare and that while theUnited States has the power to win by flattening South East Asia, the risk of self-destruction in nuclear war is too great.

Notre Dame's third day of :anti-war protests started early' and slowly. Leafletting in factories in the South Bend area began in the early morning chill at 6:00 a.m. The focus in the factories was to encourage workers to join in the mass demonstration at Howard Park yesterday afternoon. 
Shortly after 10:00 a.m. ano­ther group of students met in front of Washington Hall and then departed for shopping cen­ters, downtown and some resi­dential areas to seek signatures for Father Hesburgh 's petition to President Nixon to end the war in Indo-China. 
The scheduled teach-in on the main quad got off to a slow start. Some of the scheduled speakers began arriving shortly after 9:00a.m., but few students attended. 
Things began to pick up shortly after 10:30 when Rev. 

David Burrel began a rap on the main quad. The crowd grew by ones and twos until it reached a size of nearly one hundred. 
Then Rev. Ernest Bartell, chairman of the economics de­partment, introduced South Bend Black Panther leader Pete Washington. The crowd grew and the discussion was shifted to the speakers rostrum at the corner of Alumni Hall. 
Washington answered ques­tions on the activities of the Black Panther party for a half hour and then Rev. John Walsh, Vice-President for Academic Affairs addressed the crowd. Most of the questions revolved around the role of the Board of Trustees· in policy making deci­sions of the university. 
Several other speakers, includ­ing Professor Peter Walsh and Pro{essor James Massey address­ed the crowd and answered questions before the l: 30 mass 
For the final affirmative state­ment, the sponsors of the motion called upon Professor Houck of the Business Depart­ment. Citing previous similar cases when he defended "insti­tutional neutrality," he asked "are the times critical enough for us to leave that pedistal of institutional neutrality?" Using the precedent set by the Ameri­can Association of University Professors of which he is a member, he concluded that just as they issued a statement asking 
for withdrawal from Vietnam, so should the Notre Dame faculty. 
Since some time remained, Theology professor William Storey also spoke to the assem­bly. He noted that he supported the students although he dis­agreed with some of them. He 
saw Fr. Hesburgh and the statement as well as the various talks of Congressman Lowen­stein as offering a hope. He added that he believed in leader­ship and saw a new example of it in Fr. Hesburgh. 
Professor PauCMcLane of the English Department led the forces opposing the passage of the resolution and he called first upon Dr. Gerhart Niemeyer of the Government Department to present the "con" case. In his address he complained that too many people in the United States take the moral question of the war in Vietnam for granted. 
This is shown, he thinks, by
the fact that it comes up in discussions as immoral without

a long series of events-Greece, Berlin, Korea, and Lebanon preceeding it. He feels that President Nixon's action has rescued the war from meaning­lessness and that while every war is a cause for grief, this is not morally unjustifiable-we are "fighting for the interest of all of those who are unwilling to fall under Communist despot­ism." 
Dr. Bernard Norling, Acting Chairman of the History Depart­ment, added that he felt that if President Nixon's action is suc­cessful, he will pick up congress­ional support, but if not, many Democratic Peace candidates will be elected in November. They would probably put curbs on the war, he added, which should please all who think like Neville Chamberlin · did about Czechoslovakia' "they are a far away people of which we know very little." This he maintained would please those who want to please themselves and take no risk for others. -· Political Science Professor Al.­
fons Beitzinger contended that although the faculty was compe­tent to speak on academic matters (and then only after due deliberation), in matters such as war, their opinions were no better than those of any group of average citizens. 
Of the many possible reasons motivating the motion on the floor, Dr. Beitzinger said that the only one he could under­stand was that of a question of great morality, but that he maintained is a question for 1the individual and not the corporate faculty.

What will have happened however is that our rage, fear, and confusion over Nixon's move last Thursday will have been expressed and dissipated. Our heated discussions and impassioned speeches will have relieved our intemal conflicts. Sadly, our activities of the last few days will be revealed for what they were: simply a communal scratching of an irritating mental and moral itch, something quite different from what our personal and national situation calls for. 
At this late date, our naivete is inexcusable. Do we really believe that the fundamental changes we seek can be wrought by two days outbursts and late night debates? Who has deceived us into thinking that the goals we seek can be achieved without a day-to-day engagement that puts personal convenience at the bottom of the list of priorities? Was the strike the most effective action we could think of-or was it the easiest? The men whose names we have invoked would laugh at us. How could Gandhi, Guevara, King, Jefferson, etc. take our brand of "revolutionary commitment" seriously? 
Until we understand the depth of the demand maae on us by our vision, all our strikes, protests, marches, and speeches will be nothing more than a grandiose method of relieving our own problems. Meanwhile, the tanks will keep rolling, the bombs keep falling, and our brothers keep dying. 
Sincerely,

The Sanctuaries 
The past few days have intensified the question that has been in the minds of many of 
us for some time: "Can I serve in the military while the nation is fighting an immoral 
war?'' That agonizing question has forced us to consider the consequences of resistance to 
the draft, leaving the country for Canada, or applying for conscientious objection. For 
the men that are not total pacifists, total conscientious objection is impossible, and 
selective conscientious objection does not exist in the United States. The consequences of 
leaving for Canada or going to prison bring on a sense of aloneness and apprehension, 
because the consequences of those actions are considerable. 
On Monday, Father Hesburgh took a stand, he aligned himself with men that have 
judged the Viet Nam war immoral and unjust, and he did so publicly. That is 
commendable, and now the question arises as to what Father Hesburgh's action will be. 
He has taken a moral stand similar to many students, but the day-to-day consequences of 
his moral stand are not the same as ours. 
What could be a response of Father Hesburgh and the faculty to our present dilemma? 
How can the community create a situation so that a person would not have to make his 
decision alone and would not bear the consequences of that decision alone? Alone, I am 
nothing; I have little power to make my voice heard, I have little ability to stand before 
the might of the state, I have little ability to protect my moral stance against the courts 
and prison and the prospect of no job. Together with Father Hesburgh and the 
administrators, together with the faculty, students that resist the Vietnam war have at 
least a chance. 

How could a-~nct~ray be created? What would a sanctuary be? 
First, the university would never officially become a haven for resisters and the administrators would never allocate funds to feed, house, and give legal assistance to, several hundred ·men committed to non-participation in the war. But individual administrators that are committed to helping students could give their individual assistance, and in the case of Father Hesburgh this could be immense. Perhaps one of the dormitories could be used; perhaps jobs on campus could be provided. Faculty that have law degrees could give free legal assistance to men that challenge the constitutionality of the CO law or the constitutiona'lity of the present war. Perhaps faculty members would join with the students to the extent that they would stand with them before the punishment of the state. 
Student government could play an enormous role. A referendum to the student body 
could allow part of the $96,000 that student government has to be spent on the costs of 
protecting the members in the sanctuary. Other means for students raising the funds are 
available. 

The sanctuary would be voluntary, it would allow older men to contribute their time, their knowledge, their moral support, and perhaps their money to a group of students resisting what they have judged to be an immoral and unjust war. It is a means for Father Hesburgh to take a concrete action as an individual, a means for him to respond as an individual to the moral dillemna that many of his students are going to face alone unless the community acts. 
One suggestion that I would offer is that Professor Charles McCarthy, who has a law 
degree and is looking for a job next year, be employed by Student Government to act as 
legal advisor and general c~rdinator of the proposed sanctuary. 
The community must stand together now, or we will be picked off individually. The 
senior members of the community could voluntarily contribute their services and 
support. We have joined together for marches, fasts, and rallies, but these things will soon 
pass, and men will be left alone and vulnerable unless we act together to create a 
sanctuary. 


Of course It's OK to open fire......Didn't the Vice President say these punks were no good!"

Despair 
The Soit. Parade 

In his stirring speech the other night, Representative Allard 
Lowenstein spoke of the need for a change. He cried out against 
what he rightly considered idiotic budget priorities. He argued 
against giving the military a carte blanche authorization, w!lilte 
seriously undercutting the monies for domestic proposals. He also 
decried the obvious hypocisy that is rife in our legislature ­
domestic funds are decried as inflationary while most military funds 
are passed without a whimper of protest. 
However it is pointless to list what I agreed with Mr. Lowenstein 
about. Those who know me, must realize that I emphatically reject 
the type of foreign policy that Mr. Lowenstein advocates. Howev1~r 
that is not what I want to talk about. 
Mr. Lowenstein mentioned the despair that young people feel. 
Much as I hate being lumped under that all inclusive title -young 
people -I would have to agree with him. I, along with ~any oth,er 
young people feel an ever deepening despair. The reasons for rny 
despair are radically different from those which cause this feeling in 
others. 
Lowenstein saiq he didn't .feel the despair that young people did. 
In the sense he meant I agree with him. As far as the solution of the 
various probelms the country faces, I am optimistic. I have littl1~ 
doubt that the present order of things can be changed for the better 
and I think that people are starting to realize that they can work for 
change-now and effect it soon. 
The type of despair that I experience will never be able to be changed by the actions of an Allard Lowenstein, since people like him are the cause of it. I honestly feel that once my generation assumes the reins of power, it will signal the beginning of the end of the United States as a sovereign nation. I, quite frankly, have no faith wl\.atsoever in my generation. Perhaps I am being excessively pessimistic. Yet looking at the events of the past few days where large numbers of students have turned to violence because their demands have been thwarted, I shudder for our nation. We are as Dave Krashna put it the leaders of tomorrow. Yet what type of, leaders will we become? 
Will we be the type of people that substitute emotion, for reason or irrationality for logic? I think so. We seem all too ready to accept statements as facts, without questioning them as long as they come from people who agree with us. We readily reject the statements of people that don't agree with us with arrogance, because of our stubborn pride. We refuse to accept the fact that many things that people do are not done with devious motives in mind. We seek to negate or circumvent laws that we don't agree with. We grow frustrated when the government doesn't instantly respond to our wishes and tum to mob action and violence in attempts to intimidate existing bodies into following the course of action dictated by the strident voices among us. In our blindness we venerate individuals, who in an earlier day would have been branded for what they were common criminals because they espouse the same ideals many of us hold. 
The attitude underlying the philosophy held by many students today is pockmarked with naievete. We crow about immedia1te withdrawal from Vietnam, without even bothering to think about the consequences. We crow about how it is good that this country is 
undergoing a near defeat in southeast Asia without bothering to face up to the painful fact that the strength of America is the only thing that blocks the Russians, Chinese and Cubans from extending either direct or indirect influence over great areas of the world. If we ar~e seriously weakened, by having any communist nation carving out a greater sphere of influence, it will not only hurt us, but the rest of the non-communist world as well. Yet I realize this view is not in vogue today, so I shall rest my argument. 
I wish I could extend as optimistic a feeling as was exhibited by one of the greatest Americans recently when he said "I know that my redeemer liveth." For our generation I fear there will be none. 
THURSDAY, MAY 7, 1970 THE OBSEilfiM 
Niemeyer on Cambodia 
Yesterday, Dr. Gerhart Niemeyer, a professor in the Government department at Notre Dame. was interviewed by Observer News Editor Steve Hoffman. Dr. Niemeyer, who received his doctorate from Kiel University in Germany, teaches courses in Political 
Theory and Communist ideology. 
Observer: Much of the uproar of the past few days has been based upon the assertion that President Nixon's decision to extend U.S. military forces into Cambodia is a usurpation of Congressional power. Is this a valid complaint? 
Niemeyer: First of aU, let me say that there has been no declaration of war in this case. If there was one, against whom would it be directed? Since the National Liberation Front and the Viet Cong are not legitimate g."Jvernments, war could not be declared against them. The situation resembles Chinese intervention in Korea, when Peking never saw fit to declare war. Further, Congress has gone along with the war for several years. Its argument now comes too 
late. Observer: In your opinion, what factor or factors have provoked such unflinching rejection of Ad­ministration foreign policy, especially on college campuses? Niemeyer: I interpret this as a aeneral · re­volutionary attitude against all society. As a rejection of society as a whole, it follows that this feeling would also be directed against what the society does outside its borders. The rejection of Administration policy is symptomatic of far deeper causes of discontent, which can be identified as vacant dreams of a perfect society free of wars, evil and social ills .. Observer: What effect do you feel the President's action will have upon the current process of Vietnamization? Niemeyer: I foresee a favorable, a decidedly favorable effect on the process of Vietnamization. The South Vietnamese have respond.~~ with a great deal of spirit to the President's ~o.~(idence in Vietnamization, and I fail to see that this process will be greatly altered by his action. 
Observer: In a larger sinse, how do you conceive of the position of United States in the world? Have we misjudged our priorities? 
Niemeyer: No, I don't believe that we are guilty of 
misjudgement. Within the system of alliances in 
operation throughout the world, we are the kingpins. 

Professor Gerhart Niemeyer 

There can be no getting away from this fact. Nor is 
there any country capable of replacing us in this role. 
Other countries would surely collapse under the force 
of communism if we were to abdicate our 
responsibility. 
Observer: Student discontent with the Cambodia 
situation has evoked denouncement and feverish 
protest on several college campuses. Do you believe 
that the current strikes in effect here and elsewhere 
are wellfounded? 
Niemeyer: No, I must maintain that these protests 
are not well-founded. President Nixon's decision 
concerning Cambodia is a prudential one. Those who 
disagree would apparently have made a different decisiOn. IQ my mind, no protest is called for. Disagreements in the realm of prudence may occur at any time. Clearly the President is not to be denounced as a criminal for making what he believes to be a wise and orudent tf.,cision. 
Observer: How do you interpret the strategy behind the President's move? Do you agree with this strategy? 
Niemeyer: I understand the stratergy to be one of making sure, by paralyzing North Vietnamese supply routes, that no catastrophe befalls the American troops as they leave. The idea is to prevent the whole 
house from falling down as we walk out the door. 
Five years of effort must not be allowed to go in vain. 
I agree with this stratergy. 
Observer: President Nixon has informed Congress 
that U.S. intervention in Cambodia will not be 
prolonged one, but one that will fulfill itself within 
six to eight weeks. Do you feel that, in actuality, he 
has committed the U.S. to Cambodia for an indefinite 
penoct of time? 

Niemeyer: No, I don't believe so. However, 
cannot agree with the limitations the President has 
fixed. I feel it to be impossible and foolish to set such 
dates. It appears that the pressure of criticism has 
imposed these limits. While I believe that we will not 
stay any longer, I fear that we may move out and 
leave the job unfinished. I'm keeping my fingers 
crossed that these fears won't be justified. 
Observer: Do you believe that the United States 
will go to any .lengths necessary to solidify the 
present Lon No! regime in Cambodia? 
Niemeyer: I fail to see any such attempt in the 
President's strategy. Intervention in a civil struJgle in 
Cambodia is not the meaning of his move. 
· Observer: How do yoe assess the effects of the 
current demonstrations as potentially capable of 
dividing the country? Do you feel that the people 
involved in these demonstrations actually 
comprehend the gravity of these effects? 
Niemeyer: I believe that the divisive effects of the 
past few days will be very strong. To illustrate, I 
would point to Rhodes' defeat in Ohio in the 
aftermath of Kent State. (Governor James Rhodes 
was defeated by Congressman Robert Taft in 
Tuesday's Senatorial primary in Ohio.) Such a drop in 
the vote for Rhodes, who ordered the troops onto the 
Kent State campus, see,ms to point to an increasing 
division within the country. As to whether people 
truly comprehend the potential · diviseness of these 
demonstrations, I would guess that they would not, 
even though I can't say for certain what goes on in 
another person's mind. 

Observer: Assuming that President Nixon fails to achieve his intended objectives in Cambodia, do you believe that the people .of this country will tum from him? 
Niemeyer: If this action turns out to be failure, it will be quite disastrous for the Administration. The consequences will indeed be grave for its future. 

Youngbloods Revisited 

Just who in hell are the Youngbloods, anyway? 
Somebody asked me that once, which is a really good thiag to ask a Youngbloods freak. Youngbloods freaks are, yot· see, much like Tom Rush frC'aks, Tommy Flanders freaks and Dave Von Ronk freaks. They love to be asked who the object of their particular freakiness is, hccatse that tells them (us) that you don't really know anythi1g about this particular 1!111f ·or group, which is very pleasing to therr (our) ears. Few pleasures i!J. life compare with the feeling of sheer e~stasy one can achieve bv standing in a group of people. and praismg lne talents of the Electric Doorknob (who are they? Exactly!) while categorically denounciag the likes of Led Zeppelin and Janis Joplin and other popular (disgust) artists. 
Anyway, who the Youngbloods are are (is?) undoubtedly (he said without reservation) one of the best American rock groups ever, like one of the three or four best. Also, who they are (or who.a lot of them are. anyway) is Jesse Colin Young: Jesse Colin Young is the Young­bloods which is not to say that there aren't. <tth~~ Y.oungbloods, but justthat they· . J.ou!dn 't be the Youngbloods 
without Jesse Colin Young. (END OF SEMI, BEGINNING OF REVIEW) There's a new album on Mercury (SR-61273) called Two Trips With Jesse Colin Young. It's one of those new things made up of old things, like "The Early Youngbloods," or something like that, if you must. Unlike many new releases of old tapes ( ... "Improvising, jamming, squeezing and shaping a musical thing which lasted for twenty minutes and 
finally broke into The Pusher (big deal), this one has some very good stuff iri it. 
The first side consists of five Young­bloods tracks that never got released before. The material isn't quite up to the stuff on the real Y oungbloods albums, but the performance and sound are fine. Four of the five tunes are written by Young; the other by Jerry Corbitt. It's 
regular Young bloods stuff-traditional, simple and beautiful, the kind of stuff that most anyone should be able to do well, except that not too many people can, and certainly no one can do it like the Y oungbloods. The sounds that the Y oungbloods make with guitars and pianos and drums are the kind of sounds that should be made with guitars and pianos and drums: just kind of real nice and perfect (well look, nobody here understands all that technical crap any­
way, right?). With Young on the vocals­l,more later-everything comes out real good. 
Side'\two ofthe album is six cuts from Young's second ~olo album on Mercury ('64 or '65) YounKJBlood. This is where it really gets good. Most of it is Young accompanying himself on guitar with John Sebastian (who else) on harp and Peter Childs (I don't know either, but there's his name right next to Sebastian's) on dobro. I guess that this is where we find out some stuff about Jesse Colin Young. 
Whether Young has written the song or not, it is always simple, straightforward and fantastic. His guitar work is absolute­ly un-sensational and absolutely perfect; great rhythm and tremendous sound. His singing-well God, that voice! -is so nice, so tasteful. Somehow he manages to mix up the traditions of rural blues, folk and early (like Elvis) rock into this beautiful style that never stretches beyond its reach and always seems to fit the song perfectly. Like who else could have sung "Get Together" like that. Lots of people tried, but well, nobody quite makes it like Young does. 
Young shows about as much versatility as I guess you can expect from an artist with a distinctive style. He has a song called "Summer Rain", very similar to the Y oungbloods' "Sunlight," that char­acterizes the kind of soft, pretty melody 
that he is so good at. "Walkin' off the 
Blues" is a simple, happy, soft-shoe type 
thing that contrasts nicely with the last 
cut on the album, Lullabye. Lul/abye is 
that real· nice thing with the vibes for the 
harmonics on Tom Rush's latest album; 
Young wrote it. Probably the best thing 
on the disc is Young's version of "Brother 
Can You Spare A Dime", which is 
dynamite material to begin with, and his 
interpretation maJ<es 1t sound like ifwas 
written just for him. 

If you haven't gotten the point yet, 
one of the nicest things about what 
Young and the. Youngbloods do is their 
simple and unpreter:tious manner. What 
they're out to do is make music that's 
nice to listen to.

M~<;arthy blasts war, proposes N D sanctuary 
Father James Riehle, Dean of Students, and Professor Charles McCarthy, Director of the Program for Nonviolence, discussed at Howard Hall last night the current strike and our country's activity in Indochina. 
"Personally I was against the strike because I was quite satisfied with the moratorium in October," Father Riehle began. He noted that, in spite of what President Nixon had said, the autumn activities did influence his policy. 
"At any rate, I'm quite happy with the way the strike's been going," Riehle continued. His only concern was that some students object to having classes called off. In fact, he said six students have already-seen him about getting their money back for the missed day. 
Professor McCarthy also has reservations about the strike. "I don't know if it's a good idea. I'm hardpressed to see that it's accomplishing anything," he said. 
In emphasizing detrimental aspects of the !)trike McCarthy noted, "There is at Notn: Dame an ultra-left ready to capitalize on action and confrontation. A few people can catalyze disas­trous action." 
McCarthy devoted the remain­der of his remarks to the war itself. "The question you have to ask yourself is 'Is it a just war'?'' he said. 
He went on to enumerate the standards by which a Christian can determine whether or not a war is just. He maintained that it must be justly instituted, have a just cause, and utilize just means. McCarthy emphasized that a war must be all three to be considered just. 
In applying the first standard -that a war must be justly -instituted-to the war in Viet­nam, McCarthy noted that Con­gress has yet to officially declare war. He added that the Tonkin Resolution, which was authoriz­ed most of our action in the war, was procured via President John-
son's lies to Congress. McCarthy then skipped to the

ln applying this standard to Vietnam, McCarthy referred to a speech by Robert Kennedy that said the U_!lit~ S_J_ate~ !s!jirectly responsible for 300,000-civili!iii deaths in Indochina. McCarthy recognized this number of deaths as an indication of unjust methods being used.

Electoral activists to meet in Walsh 

A meeting of St. Mary's and 
Notre Dame students concerned 
with electoral activity to halt the 
war will be held in the basement 
of Walsh Hall, Sunday, May 10, 
at ll p.m. 

The purpose of the meeting is 
to discuss and formulate ways of 
aiding the re-election of anti-war 
candidates in the nation and 
particularly in Indiana. 

The meeting is open to alll 
.5tudents. Those who are resi­
dents of Indiana or plan t-o 
spend either the summer or next 
year in the state are especially 
encouraged to attend. 

Senator Vance Hartke, aDem­
ocrat from Indiana was one of 
the earliest critics of the war and 
has consistently opposed expa,n­
sion of the war, the military­
industrial complex and military 
influence in foreign policy deci­
sions. The Senator is up for 
re-election this fall and reporte:d­
ly faces stiff opposition due to 
his liberal voting record. 

Richard Fatime, a member of 
Senator Hartke's Washington 
staff, will be on hand to answer 
questions concerning student aid 
in the Senator's re-election. 
Fati:nc stated that "both the 
Senator and his staff consider 
this election crucial for not only 
the Senator himst:lf, but for all 
anti-war candidates and the 
future of the student peace 
movement."

"We have been invited to take 
a step that will change our 
lives ... " he said. He cautioned 
against the feeling that "the 
world is a bag of problems for 
which there are immediate solu­
tions." Burrell thought that this 
attitude leads towards violence 
and rash actions. 
We should be . willing to take 
the long journey and not a 
"trip," Burrell warned, and he 
told the audience that the spirit 
exists among the students for 
that journey towards change. 
The change mav make "life look 
vastly different five years from 
now." 
"We do not have to worry about the people who took off for the dunes or went home... What we have done the past few days is important," he said. ''Our spirit is responsible to the spirits of all our brothers." 
This spirit does not let us ask 
''What should I do?" but rather 
"Where am I, on a journey or a 
trip!" Burrell said. 
Students launch letter campaign to home papers 
Last evening, a group of Notre Dame students met in the hope of implementing recent campus activities protesting the Presi­dent's decision to invade Cam­bodia. Among other things, they decided to launch an immediate letter-writing campaign aimed at home town newspapers. 
It is their hope that such an effort would broaden support and awareness of the Univer­sity's stance against President Nixon's action. The influence of Father Hesburgh's statement along with the Notre Dame community's support of it, they feel, should prove to be a valuable means of influencing the general public's attitude on Cambodia. 
Dan Oberst, a Notre Dame senior and the organizer of the campaign, said that it is his hope that students will also take part in a letter-writing campaign direc ted at their respective Senators and Representatives in Congress. 
All Notre Dame and SMC students are urged to take part in this campaign for they con­sider it a unique opportunity to go outside of the confines of the University. 
Any N D student interested in becoming involved in this pro­ject should contact Dan imme­diately at II 04 Flanner (phone: 1528). St. Mary's students should contact Barb Newton at of floor questions with individ­ual speakers limited to two minutes. Subsequent to the debates, Hall Presidents and the Off-Campus representatives will caucus with their respective constituencies present at the meeting to determine the con­census of their halls. After 45 minutes of caucusing, Hall Presi­
dents will present a head count 
of those present for or against the resolution. The meeting will then be adjourned.

Crew-more than just strong· arms 

by Briice Kennedy Observer Sports Writer 
When guys are shelling out 80 bucks a piece just to get to and from races, you know they're 
·not just "messing around." The members of the Rowing Club are not receiving fame or prizes for their sacrifice of time, energy, and money, but are finding only personal and collective satisfac­tion. 
The club receives a $500 contribution from the University but since expenses are much more, the members are frequent-

ly reaching into their own pockets to keep the ciub going. And beside the financial strain, the crew has also spent time every night out at St. Joseph's River working hard and practic­·ing to have a successful crew. 
The crew closes the 1970 season this weekend against 26 small colleges in Philadelphia's Dad Vail Tournament. Though the three teams, varsity, JV, and No. 3 have combined for a 6-14 slate, the record is not really accurate in showing the team's success and improvement over a

(News Headline: ·"";'Bowie Kuhn, Commissioner of Baseball, Consults With President on Denny McLain Case, Says White House Is in Complete Accord With Action Taken.") 
We take you now to the Oval Room at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., where the President of the United States is picking up the phone: 
President: "Hello, hello? Commissioner Kuhn? Yes, how are you? (Puts hands over mouthpiece, turns to secretary: "Find out what Kuhn is commissioner of. Try Interior first.") Returns to phone: "Ye!>, Commissioner, go on. The McLain case?! Well, now, let me be perfectly clear on that. Let there be no mistaking our position on that." 
Turns to secretary desperately: ("Did you ever find out what he's commissioner of?") Returns to phone: "Yes, Commissioner, we are working on the McLain case. And let me say, let me be perfectly clear on this-er, now which McLain are we talking about here? (Aside to secretary: "Look under 'M' or 'Mac' for 'McLain."') What? Oh, yes, Commissioner, THAT McLain! (To secretary: "Never mind. I've got it.") 
Yes, Commissioner, I am current on that problem. Now, then, 
there are several procedures open to us. Would you like us to send 
the troops in? I mean, I can have the National Guard take over the 
Detroit pitching staff. What? Just a minute, let me turn down the 
television set and shut off this phone to Houston Control. 
"What? No, no, it's nothing important. We've got a couple of astronauts lost up in space. There's a revolt in the Bananacan Republic, and they've kidnapped our ambassador to Jungleland. The Chinese have· set off another bomb. They've turned down my nominee, Simon Legree, for the Supreme Court. Spiro Agnew has denounced the Girl Scouts. Nothing that can't wait. The McLain case is a clear and present danger to the American way of life. 
(To Secretary: "Miss Sunbonnett, hold all my calls. Get Atty. Gen. Mitchell in here on the double. Tell him I'm working on an internal security problem of the highest priority. Use the code name 'Operation Curve ball."') 
"Now, then, Commissioner Kuhn, the first thing you'll need to 
see this through is an appropriation. The first thing we've got to do 
is get this thing funded. I would suggest we work through Health, 
Education and Welfare. Make it Bob Finch's baby. (Aside to 
secretary: "Miss Sunbonnett, get Bob Finch in here for a briefing. 
Emphasize there is to be ABSOLUTELY no leak to the press on this 
or we'll cut off the mailing list of Moynihan memoes.") 
"No, no, Commissioner, there are plenty of funds for this sort of 
thing. Will a billion do? We can put it through as aid to the ecology. 
After all, it will stop the pollution of the Detroit River. Keep Detroit 
purple, so to speak. 
"Now, then, here's Atty. Gen. Mitchell. He says the first thing you have to do is subpoena the notes from the pressbox, from the sportswriters. You already have? You have six bushel baskets of notes on the back of envelopes saying, 'Don't forget to pick up the 
instant cofee on the way home' and' 'Leave two tickets for Uncle Louie' and three baskets of 'Please remit, or we'll place this matter in the hands of our collectors'? 
"Well, now, if you think six months is sufficient suspension ...Do I think I can guarantee you backing on the part of the courts? Well, up to a month ago, I would have said yes. But with this bunch, you're liable to find that a player not only has a right but a duty to gamble on games. Jack the Ripper would have been guilty only of littering the sidewalks. 
"We've had a lot of success with a 'leave it to the states' policy. Can't you say it's a league matter? I've got a lot of admiration for the way you fellows let jurisdiction fall between two chairs. Only the other day I was saying to Pat, 'I sure wish l could do like those fellows in baseball and threaten to transfer the country if I don't get 
my way.' 
"No, Commissioner, don't worry about Fulbright. When Mrs. Mitchell gets through with him, he won't be able to get a dance at the next White House ball with the broom. The press? Pshaw! Listen! If these fellows give you any trouble, just tell them, 'You 
guys aren't going to ha· Bowie Kuhn to kick around any more.' That always gets them. We could get Spiro to call them a bunch of effete, impudent snobs. We can only hope nobody gets a look at the 
way they dress." 
six year period. 
After a 50 year layoff, the 
Rowing Club was n:founded in 
1965. Due to inexperience, the 
crew failed to win any races in 

its first two years. But in 1969 · 
the varsity had a successful 
season with a 4-1 mark. This 
year, the team's won..lost success 
was hampered by some very 
close calls and unfortunate acci­
dents. 
So what are necessary require­
ments for a good crewman? 
What skills must he have or 
develop in order to work individ­
ually and collectively to win a 
race? · A good crewman needs strength throughout his body, not just in his arms. The shoulders are extremely import­ant, and the wrists must be strong for flipping the oars. Much of the drive is supplied by the legs, braced against the boat floor. 

Coordination is vital, for not only should all eight oars push -simUltaneously' but they-must enter and exit the water cleanly and precisely, without any indi­vidual deviation. 
It would seem that the guys just get out ·there and row as hard as they can; however, over a 2000 meter course, pacing themselves is necessary, and this is where the job of the coxswain comes in. 
The coxswain sits at the back of the boat facing the rowers. He directs each move, starting with some plan in mind after con­sideration of the opponents and the conditions of the river. The plan might be to go so many strokes at 40 strokes per minute (very fast), then slow to 36 for a period. The coxswain must co­ordinate the action and be able to adjust the speed smoothly. Assisting the coxswain is the stroke, who is the rower directly in front, facing the coxswain. He too serves as a guide for the other rowers. 
Coxswain for !!te varsity is Phil Hopkins, who also serves as coach. The JV coxswain is SMC junior Barb Walker. She joim:d this year, influenced by her boyfriend who is a member of the varsity. The guys respect h'er and consider her, as one declar­ed, "a damn good coxswain." 

Although 73 students signf:d up for the club this year aml none were cut, only about 30 remain due to the rough ami time-consuming workouts lah: each afternoon which discour-· aged some hopefuls. 
The club itself is hopeful, hopeful to be established as a club sport which will entail an additional $200 in university funds, and hopeful to havf: continued success and improve.. ment next year, as well as in the Dad Vail Tourney tomorrow. Much credit should be given to President-Coach Paul Weatherby and all the other members of the: Rowing Oub for working so hard while receiving very liWe credit for their achievements.

Irish third 1n state meet 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. UPI ­Indiana's Hoosiers won their 21st "Big State" track meet Tuesday, and it came easier than any of the others. 
The defending champs over­whelmed their rivals by scoring a record 133~ points, setting two of four meet records and winn­ing 9 Qf 18 events. 
Indiana State was a distant second with 61 points and Notre Dame was third with 59. The Irish set the two other meet marks. 
Indiana's 440 relay was clock­ed in :40.4 and its Steve Kelley won the 3,000 yard steeplechase in 9:00.9 Notre Dame's record setters were Rick Wohlhuter in the 880 in 1:50.5 and Paul Gill, who hurled the discus 184 feet 9 inches. 
Indiana speedsters swept the first three places in the 100 and 220 while Steve Cooksey of Indiana State was the only double winner in the high jump and triple jump. Indiana's Ja1;k Keeler also had a chance for a double in the hurdles, but was disqualified in the intermediates. 

Purdue was fourth in team standings with 42 points follow­ed by Vincennes 23, Ball State 21 ~. Taylor 12, Butler and Wabash 10, Oakland City 8, Manchester 7, DePauw 5, Earl­ham and Indiana Central 2. 
So. Carolina still in ACC 
COLUMBIA, ~.C. UPI -An apparent last minute concession by officials of the Atlantic Coast Conference will keep the Univer­sity · of South Carolina in the ACC, at least temporarily. 
Speculation of a withdrawal from the conference to pursue a course as a major collegiate athletic power ended abruptly Tuesday afternoon when univer­sity President Thomas F. Jones disclosed a vote by the trustees not to alter the status of the university at this time. 
The decisive factor in the trustees' decision was believed to be a letter received by Jones earlier from the conference pres­ident, Dr. John W. Sawyer of 
Two black giants meet in Phil/y 
PHILADELPHIA UPI -Two giants of black college football will battle each other at Franklin Field in September for the first black football classic. 
Southern University of Baton Rouge, La., and North Carolina A&T go against each other for the first time on Sept. 12. Both the Southern "Jaguars" and the North Carolina "Aggies" had 6-2-1 records last year. 
The Black Classic is the idea of Vann Steven Truett, Jr., of Brooklyn, N.Y., a promotor of concerts and television specials. 
"I've seen the Rose Bowl and the Orange Bowl," Truett said, "and I just wondered why not a Black Classic." 
The promotor said he hopes the game will be as great as bowl games with just as much pagen­try. Truett said aU proceeds from the event will go to charities, both black and white. 
Lake Forest. 
USO official had been report­ed anxious to withdraw if the ACC officials at last week's conference meeting in Southern Pines, N.C., refused to support a Carolina request that the mini­mum 800 score on college board tests for athletes be dropped. 
Sawyer's letter to Jones indi­cated that a meeting is planned by the presidents of the confer­ence schools to consider the question of "relief" from the 800 cutoff restriction. 

Exactly what "relief" might be forthcoming, Jones made no cr·-nment, but the impression was that each ACC school would be allowed to permit a limited number of athletes who failed to score 800 on the college boards to play varsity sports as "hard­ship cases." 
Jones also said the ACC approved basketball package will permit the televising of 14 Carolina basketball games next season.
