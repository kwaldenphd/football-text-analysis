INSIDE COLUMN 
Leather belts, taxes would Clinton bring 

How has life been treating you at U of I since the summer, Mike? 
"Everyone's been asking me since I've been back at school what it was like to live in Arkansas for a summer and what I think of Bill Clinton." 
And do they believe you Saint Mary's Editor when you tell them? 
"No. Before my family moved to Arkansas 
from Chicago I wouldn't have known anything. 
Seeing first-hand what little he's done for a 
single state has clued me in on the disaster the 
entire country could face." 
"My first impressions of the state were that it's 
a little backward. I asked where the pop was at 
the supermarket once and was directed to the 
plumbing section." 
Yes, the dialect certainly is an obstacle. 
"And the clothes down there! Townie attire is straight out of John Wayne movies. And you're 'ust not cool unless you wear a thick leather belt with a silver buckle the size of a hubcap and your name branded in block letters on the back. This is for both men and women." 
Admit it, deep down you've been wanting to get one of those, haven't you? 
"Hey, now. No one's gonna be looking at my butt to call me by name. Speaking of backsides, I still can't believe your governor is running for president. Does he really think he can tax and spend us out of this slump? The man is not a wizard. Taxing the upper class isn't going to work, either. You know who's going to end up paying?" 
Who? 
"You and me-the middle class. Whether Clinton will admit it or not, he'll be at the reigns with us in the yoke begging for mercy. Our paychecks will be sucked dry." 
They already were this summer. 
"Yeah, it was impossible to find a job in Arkansas. It took me a month to land a minimum-wage job that didn't involve shoveling dead vermin or telephone solicitation. Even then, the place I ended up didn't need me...l was basically an interpreter so they could place orders in Chicago. People at the University o Illinois just don't believe Bill is an incompetent. Who ever goes to Arkansas to find out? I can't imagine what Arkansas must've been like 12 years ago." 
Well, taxes were lower. 
"The traditional family values thing really gets me. Maybe Gennifer can tell us a little about that. Arkansas ranked second in teenage pregnancies in 1988 and comes out third in 1990 in both marriage and divorce rates. Who's going to get up on a soapbox and preach, 'Parents, love your children, teach them values?' and who is Clinton to mandate that attitude?" 
I agree. 
"We all want to see a change. But is Clinton's change going to be a good one? I don't think so." 
After three months in Arkansas, you're that convinced of it. Amazing. 
"If Clinton is elected and continues his brilliant acts of change as evidenced in Arkansas, this country is destined for badness. We can expect higher taxes, low job opportunities, more empty rhetoric... " 
...and branded leather belts for all.

WORLD City's air pollution at harmful level 
MEXICO CITY -Ozone contamination hit the danger level Wednesday in Mexico City's pollution index, registering 276 points. Visibility in some sections of the capital, among the world's smoggiest cities, was about a half-mile at noon as ozone combined with other pollutants. Index readings of 100 to 200 signify unsatisfactory pollution conditions; 201 to 300, dan­gerous, and above that, very dangerous. Mexico City, with 17 million people, is heading into the season when pollution is at its worst. Environmentalists predict an especially bad year despite efforts to cut contaminants. As the rainy season ends, winds diminish and a cold cap of air forms over the Valley of Mexico, trapping contaminants. 
NATIONAL Costs of education still rising 
BOSTON-It doesn't take a Ph.D. to figure out that higher education is getting harder to afford. Tuition and fees at public colleges and universities rose an average of 10 percent this fall for the second double-digit increase in a row, while overall financial aid increased less than 8 percent, the College Board said Tuesday. Tuition and fees were up 7 percent at private, four-year colleges and universities, and up 6 percent at private, two-year schools. The cost of higher education ranges from $321 a year at the public, two-year College of the Mainland in Texas City, Texas, to $24,380 at private Sarah Lawrence College in suburban New York City, the board reported.

assumption about differences between the sexes. The findings contradict the belief that men are driven to drink more by genetics and women more by social in­fluences, said Dr. Kenneth Kendler, lead author of the study in today's Journal of the American Medical Asso­ciation. Kendler's study of 1,030 sets of female twins found that about 50 percent to 60 percent of a woman's tendency toward alcoholism is inherited. Social class, parental discipline and parents' drinking behavior appear to play a minor role, the researchers said. 
Caffeine withdrawal hazardous 
BOSTON -Got a headache? Feel a little anxious? Depressed? It could be caffeine withdrawal. A study published today found that people who are used to a couple of cups of coffee or several cans of soda can feel downright lousy if they miss their daily jolt. The problem is suddenly going cold turkey. Easing back over a few days seems to minimize the risk.

"He understands what he has to do. He's .. making the best of the opportunity to find himself as an individual, not as Mike Tyson the boxer," Charles Williams said this week. Now, six months after being sentenced for rape, Tyson has settled into a routine of work and reads books about black history and issues. "I don't see any rebellion in him," Williams said. "I think he has used this as an opportunity to look within himself and toward the fu­ture.

Le Mans Hall receives new security system 
By CHRISTINA CANNON News Writer 
Le Mans Hall will receive a 
new security system to be acti­
vated November 2, according to 
Richard Chlebek, director of 
security at Saint Mary's. 
"The system is no different than locking the door behind you when you leave home," Chlebek said. "Students may see it as an inconvenience at first, but will grow accustomed to it. It's a question of whether one wants to sacrifice personal safety for the sake of conve­nience." 
Saint Mary's took measures to install a security system as a result of recommendations over the years to improve personal safety on campus, according to Chlebek. 
"Saint Mary's chose to take a proactive stance rather than a reactive one," he said. "We are not immune to criminal activity. We have been fortunate over the years." 
New IDs issued to Le Mans residents after the break will contain the students' library, dining, student ID and security 
' 
access numbers all on one card, Chlebek said. 
Because doors to the three stairwells in Le Mans will re­main locked around the clock, students will need the security card to enter and exit these ar­eas, Chlebek added. 
A separate security system will be placed on both elevators in Le Mans. During business hours, the elevators will serve the first floor and basement ar­eas. Residents will be given an entry code number that will al­low access to the upper resi­dential floors during these hours, Chlebek said. 
"I can already foresee a lot of problems this system may have," said Le Mans freshman Natalie Cheeseman. "There probably will be a greater number of people locked out of their rooms because they forgot to bring the card with them. This will be a big burden on not only the residents, but also the staff." 
However, she added, " I think that once people get adjusted, the added security will outweigh any hassle it may produce."

Troops end hurricane relief effort 
MIAMI (AP) -Nearly all of the troops still on hurricane-re­lief duty in South Florida will be pulled out by Saturday, and the three remaining tent cities will be dismantled over the next few weeks, officials said. 
All but about 100 of the 1 ,300 Army and Marine troops will be sent home in the next few days, Army Lt. Gen. Sam Ebbesen, commander of Joint Task Force Andrew, said Tuesday. There were 23,800 troops in South Florida on Sept. 11. 
"It's been a heartbreaking time, but we're proud we were able to be here and help our fellow Americans," Ebbesen said. 
The first troops landed four days after the Aug. 24 storm. They cleared roads, helped pitch tents, chased looters and fed some of the 160,000 people left homeless by Hurricane An­drew. 
Federal officials hope to close one tent city by Friday and phase out the others in the next few weeks. Nearly 2,000 people still live in three tent cities.

BEIJING (AP) -China on Wednesday sharply criticized a new U.S. law that will let thou­sands of Chinese students stay in the United States if they face persecution at home. 
"The allegation that it is 'unsafe' for them to return to China and that they face 'political persecution' is simply untenable," the state-run Xin­hua News Agency quoted an unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying. 
The law is "absolutely unac­ceptable to the Chinese side" and "obstructs the return of Chinese students," the spokesman said. 
President Bush signed a bill last week that would let 70,000 Chinese students stay perma­nently in the United States if conditions in China do not permit their safe return by the middle of 1993. 
China has tried to lure back students from abroad to help implement its modernization and economic reform plans. The government has promised perks for returning students and amnesty for those who supported the democracy movement, but only if they do not lobby for political reform.

Russia gives Koreans KAL flight documents 
MOSCOW (AP) -Russian President Boris Yeltsin today gave a South Korean delegation recordings of radio conversa­tions involving the crew of the Korean Airlines jetliner that was shot down by Soviet fight­ers in 1983. 
The Boeing 7 4 7 was downed off Sakhalin Island, killing all 269 people aboard, after it strayed inside Soviet airspace en route from Anchorage, Ala., to Seoul. 
Yeltsin had been expected to hand over the plane's flight or data recorders, but he told the South Korean delegation that they had been disassembled and would remain in Russia. 
The material turned over in­cluded all radio exchanges be­tween the crew of flight KAL­007 and air traffic controllers and other planes, plus reports to then-Soviet leader Yuri An­dropov. The South Koreans also were given the conclusions of experts from the Soviet Defense

Ministry, the KGB and Aircraft Ministry, and maps of the plane's itinerary. 
Soviet officials initially kept silent about the disaster, then charged that the Boeing 7 4 7 had invaded Soviet airspace on a secret spy mission. 
At a Kremlin ceremony, Yeltsin said that by handing over the materials Russia had demonstrated its desire for a thorough investigation of the incident. 
He said he had studied the documents and found them to contain "unique information." 
The same information was to be handed over to American officials and the International Civil Aviation Organization later today, said Yeltsin's press sec­retary, Vyacheslav Kostikov. 
It will also be given to the daily Izvestia newspaper for publication Thursday, and eventually to all countries whose nationals were aboard the plane, Kostikov said.

German coalition tries to slow refugee influx 

BONN, Germany (AP) ­Chancellor Helmut Kohl's gov­erning coalition has proposed changing the constitution to slow an influx of refugees that has sparked attacks on asylum­seekers by rightist extremists. 
Under an agreement worked out Tuesday that is to be intro­duced in parliament on Thurs­day, the coalition also said the country must consider adopting its first immigration law. 
Kohl's government has been preoccupied and split by how to handle the asylum problem. 
Germany, with some of the world's most lax refugee poli­cies, is burdened with support­ing hundreds of thousands of refugees from former Yu­goslavia, the former Soviet bloc and the Third World while it struggles to pay for absorbing eastern Germany. 
"We want Germany to remain a foreigner-friendly country," the coalition said Tuesday in obvious reference to the ominous rise in attacks on for­eigners that have left over a dozen people dead since unifi­cation two years ago. 
A two-thirds majority is re­quired to approve a change in the constitution, however, so any plan would have to have

support from the opposition So­cial Democrats, who are split on the issue. 
Their national leader, Bjoern Engholm, favors a constitu­tional amendment as a tool for lessening the crush of refugees and helping deflate rising xenophobia. But many others in the party view altering the constitution as a concession to neo-Nazis. 
The Social Democrats have set a party congress for next month, when they hope to work out their differences. 
Top leaders of Kohl's Christian Democrats, the ultra-con­servative Christian Social Union and the centrist Free Democrats met in a crisis ses­sion on Tuesday morning. 
They later announced agreement on a 12-point pro­posal which calls for changing the constitution's blanket guar­antee of political asylum -a leftover from the postwar pe­riod in which Germans felt a moral obligation because of Nazi abuses. 
The constitution now says, "Persons persecuted on political grounds shall enjoy the right of asylum." 
The coalition didn't specify how the constitution's wording would change. 
Free Democrats insisted, however, on preserving the fundamental right to asylum for politically persecuted indi­viduals. 
The Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party to Kohl's Christian Democrats, had insisted on exact wording limiting the right of asylum. 
The proposal calls for new regulations naming countries where political persecution is no longer considered a threat, such as Poland and Romania; and effectively requires refugees who come to Germany via a "safe third country" to return to that country.

ELECTION '92 
ELECTioN BRIEFs 
Mixed results In polls 
NEW YORK-Vice President Dan Quayle's duel with Democratic Sen. Al Gore doesn't seem to have cost him any support, according to instant post-debate polls by two television networks. Gore was called a winner by 38 percent of viewers and Quayle by 35 percent, with 17 percent calling it a tie in a poll taken by ABC just after Tuesday's vice presidential debate in Atlanta. Gore's three-point advantage was within the poll's margin of error. Quayle not only helped his ticket slightly more than Gore did, but the 35 percent who thought he won compared favorably with the 18 percent who thought Bush won after Sunday's leadoff de­bate. ·" 
Stockdale ready to serve 
ATLANTA -James Stockdale conceded Wednesday he was "kind of out of it" during the vice presidential debate but said voters shouldn't think that means he isn't up to the job. Political analysts said his debate showing could only hurt Ross Perot's against-all-odds presidential hopes. In morning-after interviews, Stockdale attributed his sometimes uncertain or fumbling answers in Tuesday night's debate to a matchup of an everyday citizen against two polished politicians with programmed answers to every question. 
Report: Perot's tax plan favors him 
NEW YORK (AP) -Ross Perot pays a smaller share of his income in taxes than most Americans and would pay even less under his "shared sacrifice" economic plan, a newspaper reported today. 
The Texas billionaire pays 6.8 percent of his earnings in federal income tax because much of his income is derived from tax-free municipal bonds, according to Citizens for Tax Justice, a Washington-based nonprofit group that ran a computer analysis for New York Newsday. 
The analysis found that Perot would pay 6.7 percent of his in~ome in taxes under his proposed economic plan. 
The independent presidential candidate has refused to discuss his personal finances or make his tax returns public, so precise figures are not available. 
But a spokesman has confirmed the accuracy of a Fortune magazine survey that put his net worth at $3.3 billion. 
Last year, Perot paid at least $15.8 million in taxes on an estimated income of $230.4 million, Newsday reported. 
The estimated percentage that Perot paid in federal taxes was only slightly higher than the 6.2 percent paid by the average taxpayer earning $30,000 a year, and was far below the 11 percent average share of gross income paid by all taxpayers, according to a Congressional Budget Office report cited by the newspaper. 
Perot's plan would raise the top income tax rate to 33 percent from 31 percent; raise gasoline taxes; and limit mortgage interest deductions to loans up to $250,000 and end them on second homes. 
Other proposals include a 10 percent investment tax credit; a permanent tax credit for research and experimentation; and a cut h1 the capital gains tax. 
Robert Mcintyre, who prepared the analysis for Newsday, said the proposal to increase the top tax rate would mean Perot would pay slightly more in taxes.

Aides say Quayle had agenda right 
ATLANTA (AP) -Dan Quayle played the traditional vice presidential role of hatchet man with abandon in his debate with AI Gore and James Stockdale. He badgered and bashed Gore in a performance that lifted sagging Republican spirits. 
Quayle was headed to Alabama today for a rally at Auburn University before returning to Washington. 
Quayle ended where he began, asking American voters, "Do you really believe Bill Clinton will tell the truth? And do you trust Bill Clinton to be your president?" 
"We spelled out our agenda -and we spelled it right," said Jim Pitts of the Bush-Quayle campaign. Rich Bond, Republican national chairman, called it "Dan Quayle's finest hour as far as I'm concerned." 
An Associated Press panel of debate judges de­clared Gore the technical winner, but several said Quayle probably scored better politically.

WE WILL NOT BE , SILENCED 
Last Tuesday in a bold move to silence those who do not share their political views, the Notre Dame College Democrats turned a meeting of the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Right to Life group into a publicity stunt for their cause. 
They claimed to be interested in "discussion." Perhaps that is why they came to the meeting unannounced, disrupted the presentation, refused to let the speaker continue, and refused to sit when politely asked to. And perhaps that is why they felt the need to invite the local media to someone 
else's meeting. After all, what good is "discussion" unless you can also get free publicity 
for your cause. Yet not a single Democrat came to anyone involved with organiz­ing the Right to Life group before the meeting and expressed their concern about the group's opposition to Governor Clinton's presidential bid. But it is not just Democrats or Governor Clinton who the Right to Life group stands against, it is Republican Senator Arlen Specter, Republican Indiana House of Representatives' candidate Don Soderman and Republican Governor Bill Weld of Massachusetts. If the College Democrats would have asked Right-to Life about their views instead of disrupting the meet­ing, perhaps they could understand why many Notre Dame students and many Americans find abortion unac­ceptable. They find abortion unac­ceptable in the same way that they find racism unacceptable, and they will vote for neither a racist nor a developmentalist. We believe that all human beings should have the same rights regard­less of stage of development. We feel it is our duty to speak out on this issue. And we will not be silenced.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Dear Editor: 
Last weekend I saw the Notre Dame production of Eugene O'Neill's play "Ah Wilderness" performed in Washington Hall. My question is about your pa­per; why do you not print re­views of campus productions? 
I suppose that you have done your duty by running "previews." A preview tells its reader a little history about the production, usually supple­mented by comments from the director. A preview also an­nounces the time and location of performances. I would like to suggest that previews are worthless and that you ought to be running reviews instead. 
The reason that previews are worthless is precisely what separates them from reviews: the fact that they do not evalu-
Previews glorify, reviews critique 
Dear Editor: 
I am responding to a letter (The Observer, Sept. 28), re­garding Democratic Presiden­tial Nominee Bill Clinton and his "campaign for death." Bill Clinton is not on a campaign for death, but a campaign to im­prove the lives of all Americans. 
I believe that our Lady of Guadalupe would favorably look upon improving our health care for all citizens, college op­portunities for all adolescents, and social work being done as loan payback. 
Regarding Bill Clinton's op­ponent and his possibly termed "campaign for life", do you think that the blessed Juan Diego in 1531 would look fa­vorably upon increased poverty due to increased taxes, igno-

ate the production. A proper review includes all the relevant historical, directorial and logis­tical information that a preview has, but it also points out the strengths and weaknesses of the show. 
This extra information allows the readers (and potential viewers) to form some opinion about whether or not the show is worth seeing. But, more importantly, a review can direct attention to perhaps subtler aspects of the production that are especially noteworthy, fea­tures that might enhance the enjoyment of the average the­atre-goer but that might otherwise go unnoticed. 
A preview cannot do the same job, because it never gets around to saying how the pieces of the show work together (or fail to do so). 
can imagine a number of reasons why The Observer chooses not to run reviews. They are hard to write, but there must be qualified students around. They offer opinions, but then so do editorials. 
They might be pointless, if the audience for Notre Dame plays is comprised of mostly season ticket holders who are starved for even the semblance of a cultural event in South Bend. But from the point of view of a student newspaper, these are bad reasons: the paper ought to have proper reviews. A preview is nothing but a glorified poster that can be written without the writer having so much as seen the play.

ranee to the underprivileged, and celebrations after war? 
Would he bless the man who runs a country for the benefit of upper-middle class citizens who contribute to the health of the economy? Would our Lady of Guadalupe place a halo on the head of our current president, who has allotted millions of dollars to the arms race? I think not. 
The statement that "Bill Clin­ton cares nothing for today's mothers and their unborn chil­dren" is equally absurd. Bill Clinton supports legislation which would allow parents to take time off work to care for their newborn or sick child. 
Do you favor a "campaign for life" where a single, underprivi­leged woman, bearing the child

of her rapist while her father and brother are off getting killed in a war, would have to return to work shortly after the birth of her child? 
This woman, under the "benefit" of a "campaign for life" would also be denied pre­natal care due to the decline in Medi-Care. Is this what you call caring for today's mothers? 
Jesus Christ cared for the sick, fed the hungry and clothed the naked. From what I see, Bill Clinton and his campaign come far closer to these acts of 
Jesus than  do  those  of his  
opponent.

Throw caution, cups, and marshmallows to the wind 
Dear Editor: 
This is to Mr. Burke and Mr. Murphy, (The Observer, Oct. 7, 1992). 
Thank you for taking the ini­tiative to lash out against the high-risk "tradition" Notre Dame students have of firing plastic cups in the stands dur­ing home football games. 
The potential for danger in the throwing of these and worse yet, marshmallows, has personally caused me much anguish during the last nine home games I have attended. 
Who are you to sarcastically refer to us as "pinnacles of ma­turity"? When did you set the standards for how to act at a football game? Does this mean we can purchase your book on stadium maturity at the book­store? 
Odd as it may seem, throwing objects is a popular pastime at sporting events. 
In Cleveland, die-hard fans in the famed "Dawg Pound" litter the end zone with dog biscuits to show support for the Browns. 
Detroit hockey fans throw an octopus onto the ice before the first playoff game begins. 
In New York, among other cities, it is commonplace for the fans to fire their hats toward the ice after one of their beloved Rangers registers a hattrick. 
These actions may seem like "Romper-room" hijinks to you, but to many loyal fans, they are simply a way of expressing their support for the team. 
Perhaps your assertion is correct; the potential for bodily harm far outweighs the enjoy­ment derived from throwing a plastic cup. 
Let us then, bind together to ensure that all "danger" is re­moved from football games. 
Maybe the stadium should in­crease security, say one usher per row, to "chaperone" the lit­tle kids at the games. 
Or, better yet, make students give their IDs in when buying a coke. Upon returning the empty cup, the student would be returned his ID card. 
If you aren't willing to lay your life on the line to watch the Fightin' Irish in person, please remember NBC is always an excellent alternative. 
I personally will throw cau­tion to the wind and welcome all plastic cups and/or marsh­mallows whose final destination may be the back of my head.

Alumni advances to soccer finals 
By KEVIN JANICKI 
Sports Writer 
The men's interhall soccer championship game has been postponed until after midsemester break after some controversy surrounding the playoffs arose on Monday. 
Zahm A was forced to forfeit its semifinal victory over Carroll after a RecSport protest board consisting of five hall athletic commissioners ruled yesterday that they had used ineligible players in that contest. Zahm A had narrowly beaten Carrol on Sunday in a 5-4 penalty kick shootout after a scoreless game. 
However, Carroll filed a protest Monday claiming that two Zahm A players had played in a game for Zahm B earlier in the season, making them ineligible for the remainder of the season. According to RecSport rules, an individual may play for only one team during the course of the season. 
The board met yesterday afternoon at 4pm in the Athletic Department Conference Room

at the J.A.C.C. The captains of both Carrol and Zahm stated their cases to the board before a unanimous vote of 5-0 de­termined that Carrollwill play for the championship after the break. 
· The controversy surrounding this Carrol vs. Zahm A semifinal game could not overshadow the excitement of the other semifinal contest between Alumni and Cavanaugh. De­fending champion Alumni ad­vanced to the final by defeating Cavanaugh in what proved to be the most exciting game of this year's playoffs. 
In a rematch of last year's championship game, Alumni prevailed again, this time need­ing a lengthy penalty kick shootout after two 25-minute halves and two 5-minute over­times of scoreless soccer. 
Alumni's defense, led by Tony Szweda, is used to holding teams scoreless, having shut out every opponent its faced this year. However, a strong Cavanaugh defense denied all of Alumni's attacks on goal, forcing a nerve-racking shootout. In the shootout, each team converted four of their first five penalty kicks, pushing the game into sudden death kicks. For the next eight Alumni kickers, each successful attempt was matched by Ca­vanaugh, while their only two misses were each followed by Cavanaugh misses. Finally, Alumni's 13th kicker of the game, Bill Sarabaugh, con­verted and goalie Joe Finnerty saved Cavanaugh's next kick, giving Alumni the victory. 

With such strong momentum from a successful season and playoff run, Alumni had hoped to take home a second consecu­tive championship on Tuesday. But they learned on Tuesday of Carroll's protest, and must now stay motivated to make a run for the title after the break. 
"We were really disap­pointed," said Alumni captain Volker Blankenstein, "We were ready to play." 
Women's soccer crushes Wildcats 
By GEORGE DOHRMANN Sports Writer 
The Kentucky Wildcats got a glimpse of where they want to be, as the first year program fell to the 15th-ranked Notre Dame's women's soccer team 9­0 at Alumni Field. 
Coach Chris Petrucelli has his Irish streaking as they notched their fifth shutout of the year. 
Junior forward Alison Lester started the goal parade less than three minutes into the game on a pass from fellow forward Jodi Hartwig. Five minutes later, freshman Rosella Guerrero took a pass from Tiffany Thompson and pushed the Notre Dame lead to 2-0. 
Before the first half ended, Lester added another goal and Thompson hit the net an an unassisted shot 30 minutes into the game. 
The second half was more of the same. Freshman Michelle McCarthy scored minutes into the half, and her goal was fol­lowed by Guerrero's second. Lester completed her hat trick five minutes later. 
Senior captain Margaret Jarc knotted the game's eighth goal on a pass from Tonya Macioce, followed by Stephanie Porter's second goal of the year, which completed the scoring. 
Petrucelli down-played the upcoming matchup with SMU but was excited about his team

Braves stun Pirates with 3-run rally in ninth 
ATLANTA {AP) -A heart­stopping, ninth-inning come­back ended with another World Series for the Atlanta Braves and another fall failure for the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
The Braves, in a wild rally that ended with a play at the plate, beat the Pirates 3-2 Wednesday night to reach the World Series for the second straight year. The stunning loss gave Pittsburgh its third straight postseason failure. 
And this was the most painful of all. 
The Pirates were three outs away from their first World Series since 1979, but Doug Drabek, who pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the sixth and stranded two runners in the seventh, didn't have one more escape act in him. 
Terry Pendleton, only 1 for 21 in the series left-handed, dou­bled to right field. Drabek, pitching on three days' rest for only the second time in four years, was wearing down and so was the Pirates' defense. 
David Justice hit a routine grounder, but second baseman Jose Lind, who made only six errors all season, booted the ball and two were on. The crowd, almost resigned to de­feat a few minutes earlier, was standing and chopping. 
Sid Bream, the former Pirate, walked and Drabek, his control gone, was finished and the Pi­rates were forced to go to a bullpen that had been ineffec­tive all year. 
Pirates manager Jim Leyland went to Stan Belinda, who led the team with 18 saves but had lost his job as a closer late in the season and had just three saves in the second half of the season. 
Belinda quickly showed why. 
Ron Gant almost won it with a drive to left that Barry Bonds caught two feet in front of the wall, scoring Pendleton and making it 2-1. 
Then Damon Berryhill walked and the bases were loaded again. The Pirates were an out away when pinch-hitter Brian Hunter popped out and Braves manager Bobby Cox, his bench almost exhausted, sent up Francisco Cabrera. 
Cabrera had homered in his only previous at-bat against Be­linda, but he didn't homer this time. He didn't need to. 
Cabrera lined a shot between third and shortstop to score Justice and Bream, the slowest runner on the Braves, barely beat Bonds' desperation throw to the plate that was well off­line. 
A good throw would have had the runner. Instead, it sets up a World Series against the Toronto Blue Jays, a team that finally managed to win the big one after years of frustration by beating the Oakland Athletics 9­2 on Wednesday. 
The Braves, who lost the Series to Minnesota in the 1Oth inning of the seventh game last year, will be trying to reverse that disappointment.

CCHA 
continued from page 14 
Lake Superior State, visit the JACC for a weekend series on October 30 and 31. While the Lakers return 19 lettermen, they only return five of their top 10 scorers from last season. The Lakers will look to sophomore sensation Brian Rolston, who racked-up 46 points (18-28) at center in his freshman season, and junior center Clayton Beddoes, who tallied 44 pts. (16-28) last year. Despite their losses, the Lakers will certainly give their oppo­nents all they can handle. 
The following weekend, Nov. 6 and 7, the Irish go to Oxford, Ohio for a weekend series against Miami of Ohio, a team that finished 5th in the CCHA last year. 
On Nov. 13 and 14. the Irish host the University of Illinois-Chicago, a team that looks to improve on its 10-20-6 overall record in 91-92, good for 7th place in the CCHA. Head coach Larry Pedrie enters his third season with the Flames of UIC, hoping that his 10 freshman from last year will use their experience to jump up the CCHA ladder. The Flames will look to sophomore goalie Jon Hillebrandt to anchor their defense, with last year's leading scorer, Chris MacDonald (38 pts., 11-27) leading the offensive charge. 
On Nov. 20 and 21. the Irish face-off against the Broncos of Western Michigan in a home and away series. The Broncos (16-14-6 overall in 91-92) fin­ished 4th in the CCHA last year, and they will feature a core of veterans, lead by senior center Pat Fershweiler (40 pts., 8-32) and junior winger Colin Ward

(39 pts., 25-14). 
The Spartans of Michigan State visit the JACC on Nov. 27th for one game, a team that finished 3rd in the CCHA last year and recorded a 25-11-8 overall record. MSU returns 20 lettermen this season, among them senior center Brian Smolinski (65 pts., 30-35). sophomore center Steve Suk (52 pts., 11-41), and sophomore winger Rem Murray (51 pts., 13-38). The Spartans will again challenge for the top spot in the league, benefitting from their trip to the Final Four last year. 
The Irish travel to Ohio State on Dec. 11 to face the Buckeyes, a team that frnished 8th in the CCHA in 91-92. Ohio State added freshman John B. Graham, a 209 lb. right wing, to their line-up during the off­season, a player that received much acclaim in the British Columbia Junior Hockey League. The Buckeyes, how­ever, lost stand-out goalie Mike Bales to the Boston Bruins during the off-season, but somehow Ohio State still re­mains hopeful for success this season. 
On Dec. 12, the Irish travel to Bowling Green for one game against the Falcons of Bowling Green State. The Falcons fin­ished in the cellar of the CCHA last year with an overall record of 8-21-5. Bowling Green re­turns 16 lettermen, including senior center Brett Harkins, who tallied 4 7 points (8-39) last season and goalies Will Clarke and Angelo Libertucci, who split time in goal for the Falcons last year. 
The Irish then travel to Big 
of Ferris State on Jan. 30. The 
Bulldogs finished with an over­
all record of 13-18-7, and fin­ished 6th in the CCHA. Ferris State returns 18 lettermen, but lost 5 of their top 8 scorers.

JONATHAN JENSEN 
Game Point 
Some interesting thoughts for all seasons 
Just a few thoughts to ponder, laugh or sneer at as the baseball season draws to a close and the real sports year kicks in. 
But 
really, despite a summer of baseball that invited comparisons to War and Peace and my Social Psychology class last year, games like last night's have infused some excitement into fans like me that root for teams like the Cubs and Yankees. Stop that snickering! 

The 
college football drive for #l(Or at least a share of it) is winding down and I'm sure we're all looking forward to seeing the Irish take on the Nittany Lions for the first time at Notre Dame stadium since the debacle in 1990. This is a team that Coach Holtz says might be the best in the nation, at least on film. After seeing the Lion offense, led by an inept John Sacca and Joe Pa­terno's brown paper bag offense, sputter and wheeze last Saturday, I would guess that Holtz is just gearing up for his weekly "We are not very good, they are outstanding" speech a little early for the big game. 

This 
weekend could be a pivotal one in the NFL, as two of the four best teams in the league tangle under God's peekhole in Texas Stadium in Dallas on Sunday. You know, I wonder how many football fans would be willing to bet the house that the Super Bowl is won by one of these four teams: Dallas, Philly, Kansas City, and Miami, although the Dolphins schedule has been helpful this season(The Irish could go undefeated in a division with teams like Indianapolis, the Jets, and the perennial Patsies). By the way, I'll take that bet. 

Being 
a Chicagoan ... pork chops...! would be remiss not to mention the off­season...bratwurst... moves this year's World Champion Bulls made to solidify their lofty perch on top of the NBA. Picking up veteran...nachos...forward Rodney McCray and bolstering their already solid backcourt with sharpshooter Trent Tucker leaves just one... polish sausage...roster spot and one ring finger left. Incidently, if you haven't heard, that spot is soon to be gobbled up by our own Keith Tower, who is one of 12 finalists for the spot. I can just imagine those patented 15-foot skyhooks raining down to the cheers of the raucous Chicago Stadium fans. Stranger things have happened. Anybody hungry? 

There's 
only one sport left. .. oh, uh... hockey. I think the only game I want to see all year is the Irish home opener against defending champ Lake Superior State. But at the risk of being hoarded by the flocks of rabid New Englanders that live and die for hockey on this campus, let me just say that Eric Lindros will certainly add some excitement to an already promising hockey season(Kind of like when we had a "powerful" guest speaker in that Social Psych class).

Rugby club gears up for post-season tourney 

By DOMINIC AMOROSA Sports Writer 
Six years ago, the Notre Dame men's Rugby Club team was struggling 
However, Art Maerlander has rescued the program, and in the past 3 seasons, the Irish are 19-1 in the regular season. They've been considered one of the top twenty teams in the nation for the past five seasons. 
This season, with Maerlander finishing his doctoral studies at Dartmouth College, the team has been guided on the sidelines by Jay Nash. On the field, senior captains Eric Poley and Joe Burke, will help carry on the tradition of outstanding Irish rugby teams. The team looks forward to the Midwest Regional Championships and a trip to the Rugby Final Four. 
The Irish have rebounded from a slow start and have dominated their most recent opponents. The season started with an exhibition loss to a powerful Michigan men's club team. That was followed by a heartbreaking regular season loss at Bowling Green. Since that loss, the Irish have destroyed three teams by a 182-3 margin. 
Their first win was a 69-3 romp of Michigan State. Then, as the number-one seed at the Karfu Tournament League Championships in Chicago, the team crushed Northwestern 57-0 and University Illinois-Chicago 66-0. The top scorers for the Irish at the Karfu were Dan Belmont with 5 tries and Nick Lloyd, Jeff Lyman, and Eric Poley with 3 tries each. A try is equivalent to a touchdown in football, but it is worth 5 points. The victories guaranteed the Irish an auto­matic bid to the Midwest Championships. 
The national Rugby tournament is similar to the NCAA Basketball tournament. There are 64 teams divided into four regions: East, Midwest, South and West. With 16 teams in each region, the Irish are confident they will gain a top-four seed in the Midwest. At press 
Crew to compete in tradition-rich Boston regatta 
By JENNY MARTEN Associate Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame varsity rowing club will be competing in the Head of the Charles and the Head of the Schuykll over fall break. 
The Irish will travel out to Boston to compete on the Charles River in one of the most famous regattas in the country. Notre Dame will race against crew teams and crew clubs from all over the world. 
"It should give us a good reading of

at Notre Dame. 
time, they have yet to be notified of their seeding. If they gain one of the top-four seeds, they will host the first two rounds of the regional at Stepan Field on Oc­tober 31. 
Both Poley and Burke feel the team has an outstanding chance to improve on last year's 3rd place finish. Poley says that the "team is real strong, and they're the hardest hitting team he's played on in his career." 
Burke thinks that they "had a slow start, but they've picked up steam along the way and their chances to win are great with lots of hard work." Penn State will be favored in the Midwest along with 
how we're doing," said Rowing Club president Rudy Bryce of the Head of the Charles. "We'll get a chance to compete against the best of the best. 
"We do reasonably well against other clubs, but we can't compete against the Harvards and the Vales," said Bryce. 
The varsity men will compete in the Lightweight 8 division and the women will compete in the Heavyweight 8 division. The Lightweight division fea­tures individuals under 135 lbs for women and 155 lbs for men while the 
Blue Jays set for World Series 
TORONTO (AP) -At last, a real World Series. 
The Toronto Blue Jays finally learned how to win in October and took the World Series out of the United States for the first time by beating Oakland 9-2 Wednesday to win the AL playoffs. 
"It's an American sport, but a Canadian team, one of the best," Dave Winfield said. 
Beneath hundreds of red maple leafs, Juan Guzman did what Jack Morris and David Cone could not do, winning on three days' rest, to wrap up Game 6. Joe Carter and Candy Maldonado made Guzman's second victory of the series easier with home runs that put Toronto ahead 6-0 after three innings. 
MVP Roberto Alomar fittingly capped off the series with an RBI single in the eighth inning. By then, baseball was well on its way to another first -Cito Gaston becomes the first black manager to make it to the World Series. 
"There was no pressure on us," Carter said, breaking into a big smile. "Are you 
perennial powers Bowling Green, Ohio State and the University of Cincinnati. 
Before the tournament, the Irish still have some unfinished business. After a bye this weekend and time off for fall break, the team will resume playing on October 24. An alumni game with the "old boys" will take place at 9:00 at Stepan. That game will be played by the A side, while the Band C teams take on a Ft. Wayne club team at 9:00. 
On October 31, the Irish hope to begin their quest for the national title under the shadow of the Golden Dome. They can't wait to battle the "favorites" and prove that Notre Dame Rugby's claim to be a national power is legitimate. 
Heavyweight division is open to anyone. 
After the race in Boston, the rowing club will head to Philadelphia for a week of training which will culminate in the Head of the Schuylkll. The varsity rowers will have two practices a day on the Schuylkll River. 
At the Head of the Schuylkll, Notre Dame will have boats in both the men's and women's Heavyweight 8 and Lightweight 8 divisions. 
Bryce and the rest of the varsity rowers are looking forward to the week. 
kidding? There was a ton of pressure on us. We were always going to hear about our past until we reached the next level, which we have. 
"It was a long time in coming for this team, for this city, for these fans," he said. "It's something that has avoided the Canadians for a long time. People will now get a chance to see what a first­class country Canada is and what a first­class city Toronto is." 
Plus, they'll see just how far the Blue Jays have come in only 16 years. They played their first game as an expansion team on April 7, 1977, at snow-covered Exhibition Stadium and went on to lose 107 games that year. 
Gradually, they improved and eventually became the only team in the majors to now have 10 straight winning seasons. 
Even so, the Blue Jays were looked upon as big-game losers until this week. The fans sensed the turnaround, too, as another sellout crowd broke into a three­minute, standing ovation at the end.
