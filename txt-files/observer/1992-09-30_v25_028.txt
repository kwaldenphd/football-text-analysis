Hesburgh joins AIDS council 



By GERALDINE HAMILTON 
News Writer 
Father Theodore Hesburgh, president emeritus, has become a member of a twelve person advisory council for First AID, a fund raising project to benefit the National Association of People with AlDS (NAPWA). 
First AID will consist mainly of a nationwide telephone auc­tion in November. The auction, conducted via a 900 number, will include one-of-a-kind ex­periences such as a game of one-on-one with an NBA star, a game of monopoly with a prominent real estate developer or a lunch date with an in­triguing personality. 
Hesburgh became involved in the project when a member of First AlD approached him.

Former New Mexico governor addresses Hispanic issues 
By NICOLE MCGRATH 
News Writer 
Hispanics must overcome any obstacles they may face in order to succeed in their role in life no matter what role it may be, according to former New Mexico Governor Toney Anaya. 
One such obstacle occurred when Anaya and his staff be­came targeted in 13 FBI inves­tigations and at least one CIA report for openly opposing the policies of former president Ronald Reagan's administra­tion. 
"I thought something was wrong with me but it is all part of the bigger picture," said Anaya. The bigger picture in­cludes a flawed Constitution which is often being redefined and institutional racism, he said. 
Currently there are about 450-500 Hispanic undergrad­uate and graduate students but there are no Hispanic faculty members at Notre Dame, ac­cording to Anaya. 
"It is not a surprise and is the same story I hear all over the country, "he said. 

Commons owner may face possible $500,000 in fines

Assistant News Editor 
Pasquale Anastasio, owner of The Commons, faces suspen­sion or loss of his liquor license and a maximum fine of $500 for each of the minors cited in Friday's S.U.D.S. raid if the case is brought before the Indiana Alcohol Beverage Commission (ABC). according to Sgt. Gregory Deitchley of the Indi­ana excise police. 
Indiana excise police charged Anastasio for allowing minors in a tavern and allowing minors to loiter, Deitchley said. 
The case has been referred to the prosecutor of the ABC, who will decide whether to pursue charges, he said. 
S.U.D.S. cited 100 individuals for minor in tavern violations, including seven for producing false identification, according to Sgt. Moon of S.U.D.S. Two were taken into custody. 
Among Notre Dame students cited for minor in a tavern were Megan Junius, junior class treasurer, Scholastic Managing Editor Margaret Kenny and Sherri Vitale, Notre Dame tennis player. 
Cited for produeing false identification and minor in a tavern were Stacey Bowman of Campus View Apartments, Jenny Ford of Siegfried Hall, Erik Hanson of Planner Hall, Barbara Maloney of McCand­less Hall, Sean O'Reilly of Grace Hall and Brian Weiford of Dillon Hall. 
Notre Dame students cited for minor in a tavern include Michael Leahy of Alumni Hall; Laurie Niemann of Badin Hall; Alfred William of Carroll Hall; Jason Anderson, Donald Ber­gan, Michael Ebner, Edmund Galka, Gregg Gallagher, Kory Klem, James McMahon, Chris Monahan, Mark Naman, Gre­gory Nordhoff, Branden Parker,

but the budget committee will meet to decide how much money will aid the hurricane project. 
"HPC will fund $3500 as a base level and we may go up from there," Coyle said. 
Forty-seven students from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's will participate in the Miami relief project, and the fee per student will be $40, according 
Theodore Hesburgh 
AlDS," Hesburgh said. "A stand needs to be made and I am will­ing to assist." 
The main goal of the First AID project is to make money to assist AlDS victims. 
"This is a good group of peo­ple associated with good actions and that will lead to the raising of money," said Hesburgh. 
Additional members of the advisory council for First AID are Senator Bill Bradley, D-N.J., Wayne Gretsky, Joe Montana, Michael Keaton, Ann Landers, Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio and James DeBartolo. 
Hesburgh has given his full support the the First AlD cause. 

"This is a brand new organi­zation," he said. "There are a number of different programs and it has the credibility be­cause what it is doing is a good thing." 
Hesburgh's role in the orga­nization First AID is "endorsing First AID's efforts of helping people with AIDS. Hopefully people wili give money that they would not have other­wise," he said. 
All proceeds for the First AID auction, along with the net pro­ceeds from the 900 number, will go to the NAPWA. 
to Mike Arsenault, project organizer. 
This fee only covers the food costs, so the project organizers appealed to HPC because the cost of the entire trip will be approximately $7,000, he said. 
HPC also passed a resolution for the institution of a committee which will assess

Although Anaya served as New Mexico's Attorney General and Governor, from 1983-1986, he stated that being a role model "is not the main aspect of my life." 
"I would suggest being a role model be the by-product of your life and pursuit of happiness should be your goal," said Anaya. 
Students should prepare themselves with education and training, according to Anaya. That includes being able to rec­ognize opportunities and acting on them. 
When President Reagan made his 1985 state of the union address, the Democratic National Committee asked Anaya to be their spokesperson and respond nationally. Anaya turned them down and then unknown, Michael Dukakis, took the spot and began his presidential bid. 
"I declined the offer not real­izing that, as a Hispanic, I could have laid out my ideas for what the country needed," he said. 
Students have a responsibility to challenge themselves to get the best education they can at Notre Dame. Opening doors and beating down barricades are part of being a Hispanic role model, said Anaya. 
"I wish I were twenty years younger because of the great upcoming potential,"he stated. 
Although Hispanics have not reached the Fortune 500, they are becoming CEO's at places such as Coca-Cola. The His­panic community will be the single-largest minority group by the year 2000, said Anaya. 
Being able to do one's best should also lead to Hispanics'

INSIDE COLUMN 
Clinton isn't all he's wrapped up to_b_e_ 
Smooth talker wanna­
be's, take a lesson from 
Bill Clinton. 
His accomplishments in 
Arkansas over the last 12 
years of governance 
include the deserved 
nickname "Slick Willie." I Anna Marie 
should know, I live there. Tabor 
Most people in the U.S. Saint Mary's Editor 
know him only by sound-------­
bites and campaign promises on TV. They 
haven't been on the receiving end of his slick 
rhetoric... yet. The thought of Bill Clinton as 


president scares me. 
His famous last words to the people o Arkansas were along the lines of "Read My Lips." Before the last campaign in Arkansas, we were promised that he would not run for president if we re-elected him governor. Funny, look where he is now. 
Let's take a look at Billy-boy's track record. 
Arkansas can boast having the largest city in 
the country without an accredited four-year 
college. That city is my home town, Fort Smith, 
pop. 70,000. 
What else has the education governor done for education in the state of Arkansas? According to "State Rankings 1992: A Statistical View of the 50 United States," Bill hasn't done much. For 1991, Arkansas ranked 49th in the average salary of classroom teachers, $9,975 less than the national average. 
The Teacher Testing program he set up when I was in sixth grade was bogus. The teachers themselves told us so. Incompetency lived on. 
Arkansas comes in tenth in school-age population as a percentage of total population in 1989, almost two percent above the national average, yet enrollment in elementary and secondary schools hits the bottom half. 
Arkansas also ranks 43rd in percent increase in teacher salary from 1990-1991, 48th in per capita state and local government expenditures for education in 1990, and an unimpressive 47th in expenditures per pupil in public elementary and secondary schools in 1991. These are the grooming years for higher education. I don't even want to touch on the two-year community college in Fort Smith. 
All through my education in Arkansas, he was referred to by the teachers as "our beloved governor," and not kindly. 
Work-wise, there is decent opportunity, ranking 9th in the average work week o production workers on manufacturing payrolls in 1991. The only thing is, the weekly earnings of production workers on manufacturing payrolls in 1991 comes in at 47th, $132.30 less than the national average. In essence, you're worked like a dog for peanuts. 
What ever is Bill Clinton such a hot ticket in America? Is it his Depped 'do? His slick rhetoric? I wish spring break was held before election time. Come on out to Arkansas and see for yourself what little Clinton has to brag about.

Astronomers spot comet 
LOS ANGELES-Comet Swift-Tuttle, which pro­duces Earth's spectacular Perseid meteor shower every August, has been spotted for the first time in 130 years, astronomers said Tuesday. Its reappearance came more than a decade later than expected by many astronomers, including Brian Marsden, director of the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams. But in a 1973 study, Marsden also predicted the comet might show up late this year if it failed to appear between 1979 and 1983. Until now, the longest time span after which a comet reappeared as predicted was 76 years for Halley's Comet. Marsden said from his agency in Cambridge, Mass., which reports new discoveries for the International Astronomical Union.

Starmann: McDonald's Corporation seeks ND student robbed 
80 percent waste reduction within two years 
By THERESA ALEMAN 
News Writer 
The goal of McDonald's Cor­poration is to reduce waste by 80 percent over the next two years, according to Richard Starmann, senior vice president of the corporation. 
"Environmental responsibility and good business are not contradictory," said Starmann Tuesday as part of a two-day lecture series on "Business Leadership in the Environmen­tal Crisis." 
He highlighted some of Mc­Donald's efforts to reduce waste in its thousands of restaurants, including packaging and waste reduction. 
Starmann said McDonald's change in packaging from polystyrene to quilted paper wrap is "good science, not just good headlines." 
McDonald's is currently working with the Environmen­tal Defense Fund to research and implement more recycling practices to reduce waste. In addition, since 34 percent of its

waste is organic, the corpora­tion is researching ways to reuse it for soil nutrient, he said. 
Starmann said McDonald's is committed to reducing, reusing and recycling its waste while serving the fast food needs of its customers. 
"There are no easy solutions, 
but we are integrating perma­
nent changes to become envi­
ronmentally sound," he said. 
Attacks by the environmental 
media are unfair, he added. 
"McDonald's serves break­fast, lunch and dinner to 18 million people per day -that's America twice a month. But there's a downside to being leader of the pack," he said. 
"We at McDonald's want to be sure we're doing the right thing to protect the environment for the next generation," said Starmann. ·

A Notre Dame student from Morrissey Hall was robbed at gunpoint at 1:10 a.m. Sunday morning while stopped in his car at the intersection of Notre Dame and South Bend Avenues, said Chuck Hurley, assistant director of Notre Dame Security. 
The robber tapped a shotgun against the passenger-side window of the student's car and demanded his money, Hurley said. The student gave the man the $2 he had, and the man fled the scene on his moped. The student was not injured. 
The suspect is described as being a white male, 6'1" and 175 pounds, with brown hair and of medium build, wearing a dark jacket with gold sleeves, a white baseball cap and blue jeans. 

Experimental aircraft crashes 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The crash of an experimental V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft that claimed seven lives in July was caused by a combination of a flash fire, engine failure and a failed drive shaft, the Pentagon said Tuesday. 
The crash occurred as the V­22 was making the transition from flying like an airplane to landing with its rotors tilted at a 60-degree angle, the Pentagon said in a statement.

ATTENTION FUTURE HOLLYWOOD STARS: 
Sunbeam Productions needs EXTRAS for a film shooting in South Bend which takes place on the Notre Dame campus in the sixties. If interested, men should let your hair and sideburns grow NOW for a late 60's look. Stay tuned for more details. 
But Rep. Pete Geren, a lead­ing congressional backer of the V-22, said the Pentagon con­clusion was a good one for the embattled program. 
"Everything that. this report suggests as a likely cause of the accident is something that is correctable without calling into question the tilt-rotor technol­ogy," said Geren, whose Fort Worth, Texas district is home to one of the V-22's developers, Bell Helicopter Textron. 
"It was a terrible tragedy, but 
this report should put to rest 
any concerns that the technol­
ogy itself is flawed," he said. 
Three Marines and four 
civilians died when the proto­
type plunged into the Potomac 
River on July 20 while trying to 
land at the Marine Air Station 
at Quantico, Va. 
The aircraft, also known as 
the Osprey, has twin rotors that 
allow it to fly like an airplane at 
speeds of 300 mph, then tilt its 
rotor blades to allow it to hover 
and land like a helicopter. 
The statement said the Navy 
Mishap Board has determined 
that a combustible fluid be­
lieved to be lubricating oil 
pooled in the forward part of 
the right engine housing and 
was drawn into the engine's air 
inlet area. 
When the fluid ignited in the 
engine, it set off flames that 
caused the engine to fail. A 
flash fire reaching 900 degrees 
Fahrenheit ensued and dam­
aged the drive shaft, which ul­
timately failed. 
While the V-22 is designed to 
fly with only one engine, it can 
only do so "if the pylon drive 
shaft is working," the statement 
said. 
"The investigators were un­
able to determine what caused 
the combustible fluid leak."

Congressional report casts doubt on Patriot missile claims 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The strongest evidence indicates Patriot missiles in the Persian Gulf war knocked out incoming Iraqi Scuds in only four cases, according to a General Account­ing Office review released Tuesday. 
The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said "about 9 percent of the Patriot's Opera­tion Desert Storm engagements

awareness of their place in so­ciety and in American history, according to Anaya. 
This awareness includes un­derstanding the pain and hap­piness of Americans which Anaya became attuned to dur­ing his campaign involvement in Reverend Jesse Jackson's 1988 presidential bid. 
"I have always been in awe of. the office of presidency and held respect for anyone who ran for it," said Anaya. But he added, he is no longer in awe of this fall's candidates even though he calls himself "a staunch Democrat." 
There are many qualified 

are supported by the strongest evidence that an engagement resulted in a warhead kill." 
Before the numbers were classified, the Pentagon had reported a total of 4 7 cases in which Patriots were fired to intercept Scuds in Saudi Arabia and Israel. The 9 percent figure would then represent four engagements. 
The report noted that kill rate 
Hispanics but it will not be easy electing one into office, said Anaya. 
"The United States is still not ready for a minority president," he said, for many reasons. 
Hispanics are beginning to coalesce into interest groups as well as being elected to local and state office levels, accord­ing to Anaya. 
"They are becoming the strong foundation needed to lobby for Hispanics in higher positions. Also, if Bill Clinton is elected this fall, most likely he would run for re-election and leave 2000 the year a possibility for Hispanics," he said. 
Anaya was raised in a large Catholic family in a small New Mexico town where his parents impressed education on him. He said he was impatient to begin is only about one-third of the 25 percent success rate the Army now claims as supported by the strongest evidence, and is far below the Pentagon's earlier claims. 
The Army initially claimed that the Patriot achieved an 80 percent success rate in Saudi Arabia, and 50 percent in Is­rael. Those claims were later scaled back to 70 percent and 
his higher education. 
"At eighteen, I got to Wash­ington D.C. with $700 in my pocket ready to conquer the world," said Anaya. 
In all the advice he gives, Anaya admits the best words he received was from his mother. 
"Mijo, cuida a tu familia," re­peated Anaya, "(Son, take care of your family)." For him, tak­ing care of the family not only includes blood relations but the local community, too. 
This lecture was sponsored by Student Union Board, the Oflice of Minority Affairs, The League of Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and the Hispanic American Organization (HAO) as a part of National Hispanic Month. 
40 percent. The GAO report said the Army now reports there is at least some evidence to support a 52 percent com­bined success rate for the two countries. 
GAO defined "the strongest evidence" as instances in which Scud debris or radar data indicated a Scud was destroyed or disabled after a Patriot detonated near it. 
The Patriot is a surface-to-air missile guided by radar which was upgraded during the Gulf War in an effort to make it ef­fective against short-range bal­listic missiles. 

Evidence that could offer a more complete evaluation of the Patriot's performance is unavailable because the mis­siles were operated under wartime conditions that were not conducive to gathering definitive information, the in­vestigators said. 
In a statement, the Army said while it disagrees with the GAO over what the information shows.

Helicopters collide over Niagara Brazilian president impeached

-Two helicopters carrying "You could hear the 'woof­N.Y. The other victims -one 
sightseers over Niagara Falls collided Tuesday, and one crashed near the Niagara River gorge, killing all four people aboard, authorities said. 
The other helicopter landed safely at a theme park nearby. 
Witnesses said debris from the helicopters rained down onto a parking lot, but no one on the ground was hurt. The collision happened shortly after noon about 300 yards from the falls, which straddle the U.S.­Canadian border. 
A witness, Michael Folemsbee of Niagara Falls, said the landing gear of one helicopter sheared off the tail of the heli­woof' of the rotors not being able to turn" as it fell, said Folemsbee, a parking lot atten­dant. 
It slammed into an embank­ment and slid about 50 feet to the bottom, he said. 
The other helicopter "kept going but was obviously very shaky and wobbling around," Folemsbee said. One person on board -the pilot -was hurt. 
The helicopter that crashed was a Hughes 500 belonging to Rainbow Helicopters Inc. in Ni­agara Falls, N.Y. It carried four people, said company manager Scott Hughes.

man and two women -were not immediately identified. 
Frits Wiarda, 31, a sightseer from Delft, the Netherlands, said he was standing by a rail­ing overlooking the falls when "I heard a big bang." 
"I looked up in the sky and I saw one helicopter flying away and the red one tumbling down," Wiard a said. "My first reaction was, 'Do I want to make a photograph?' And then I realized I was pretty close to it, so I started running away from it. And I looked up and there was debris everywhere." 
The skies over the falls are often crowded with sightseeing planes and helicopters, raising concerns about air traffic safety. 
"It's like Vietnam," said Kevin Merritt, who lives a half­mile from the crash site. "They're flying too many, too low, too fast." 
A bill was introduced this month in Canada's House of Commons that would restrict helicopters and light aircraft flying lower than about 2,300 feet over the falls. 
BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) ­Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to impeach Fernando Collor de Mello, Brazil's first freely elected president in 29 years. Collor is accused of receiving millions of dollars from a slush fund run by his former campaign treasurer. 
Coming after weeks of massive demonstrations, the impeachment was seen as a significant benchmark for democracy in Latin America, where political crises have typically led to coups and uprisings. 
The scandal had paralyzed the economy of Latin America's largest nation, which is burdened by the highest foreign debt in the Third World. The vote will allow Brazil to restart its economy and seek foreign loans and investment. 
The 503-seat Chamber of Deputies erupted in wild celebration after Rep. Paulo Romano of the pro-government Liberal Front Party cast the 336th vote in favor -assuring two-thirds support for impeachment. The final vote

was 441 in favor, 38 opposed, 
23 absences and 1 abstention. 
The vote strips Collor of 
power for up to six months. 
Under procedures similar to the 
U.S. system, Collor will be replaced by Vice President !tamar Franco while the Senate decides whether to remove him permanently. 
Brazil has lost presidents to 
illness, resignation, military 
coups, a plane crash and even 
suicide, but this was the first 
time in its 103-year history as a 
republic that any leader had 
been impeached. 
The military, which ruled 
from 1964 to 1985, has stayed 
on the sidelines during the 
crisis. 
Collor, 43, who was 
inaugUrated in 1990 and was to 
have served a five-year term, 
was accused by a congressional 
panel of gross corruption and a 
"lack of decorum" in office. 
The panel found that Collor ­
who took office promising to 
end political corruption and 
economic stagnation 
received $6.5 million from a 
slush fund administered by his 
former campaign treasurer. 
Citizens in the nation of 150 
million people, suffering 25 
percent monthly inflation, 
flocked to demonstrations after 
reports that Collor used the 
funds to build a waterfall and 
garden around his Brasilia 
mansion, and to provide his 
wife a clothing allowance of up 
to $20,000 a month. 
When Collor moved into his 
mansion in 1990, he told voters 
it was an austerity measure. 
Rep. Genebaldo Correia urged 
impeachment "in the name of 
decency, dignity and honor" in 
one of the more than 60 
speeches before the historic 
vote. 
After the vote, many 
legislators cried. 
A large group held hands and 
sang Brazil's national anthem. 
More than 100,000 
demonstrators gathered on the 
lawn in front of the white 
marble Congress building 
erupted in cheers, fireworks 
and the pounding of samba 
drums. 
The unexpectedly wide margin in favor of impeachment was boosted by government supporters who jumped ship as it became obvious Collor would lose. 
"There were several bastards 
who betrayed us," said Rep. 
Jose Lourenco, a supporter. 
"It's all finished," he said. "The 
game has ended." 
The impeachment vote had ramifications far beyond the presidential office. 
Collor's opponents hope to break the paralysis that has gripped Brazil since the scandal broke in May. Foreign investment is on hold, stock markets have slumped and tax revenues have dwindled. 
Some businessmen, in an act of civil disobedience, have deposited taxes in escrow. A proposed tax reform bill has languished as Congress became caught up in the impeachment battle. 
"Everything has stopped, and the only way to get the economy moving again is to remove Coli or," said political scientist Ney Figueiredo. 
As TV reports earlier in the day indicated government supporters were switching sides to back impeachment, stock markets soared in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. 
For the vote, businesses closed and hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets.

Backers to determine Perot's candidacy 
DALLAS (AP) -Billionaire business executive Ross Perot today promised that if he re-launches his presidential race he will go all out to win and be on hand for a debate proposed for Sunday in San Diego. 
But he also said he told his volunteers after meeting with them Monday that "my feelings are not going to be hurt if you decide to support the Democrats or the Republicans or if you decide to break up and support both." 
Perot said on NBC's "Today" show that he told the volunteers: "Let's not get carried off on our group, on our real or imagined candidate or whatever -let's just decide what is right and do it." 
Perot renewed his promise to decide by Thurs­day whether to get back into the presidential race. He said aides told him that a 1-800 number installed in his offices to get input from the American people got half a million calls overnight. But he did not say what most callers wanted him to do. 
As for the proposed San Diego debate, Perot said that he would be on hand if it takes place be­cause "if you're in the game, you have to play the game." 
"But I may not have to face that issue, we'll wait and see," he said. He promised to re-launch his campaign if his supporters decide that is what they want and acknowledged that his volunteers were disappointed when he got out. 
"Certainly they were disappointed," he said. "But these are grown people, these are tough people they don't wander around emotion driven... my only concern is that they vote ... whatever you do vote, don't sit at home, don't sit it out." 
Despite unprecedented meetings Monday with top representatives of President Bush and Bill Clinton, many coordinators of Perot's state peti­tion drives said they still wanted their man to re­enter the race he abandoned in July. 
"He should get back in the race," said James Boutelle, the Connecticut leader.The Bush and -::: Clinton delegations tried to sell the Perot faithful 1 on their proposals to fix the economy in the hopes ~ that the Dallas billionaire would stay out of the race and his supporters would vote Republican or J Democratic. ~

Vegeterianism can help protect the environment 

By ALISHA EISART AND VINCENT HERMAN 
A stigma placed on most vegetarians is that they are radical animal rights activists who, aside from abstaining from eating any animal products, will not wear any articles of clothing derived from animals, not use any products tested on animals. While concern for the rights of animals is a legitimate concern for many vegetarians, other reasons to give up hamburgers and hot dogs abound. 
The reasons range from health considerations to economic concerns. Another important role vegetarians can play is in preventing the needless waste of earth's natural resources. 
How can eliminating meat from your diet help the environment? First of all, if there are fewer meat eaters, then fewer animals are raised, and less land is needed for grazing. The effects of land consumption and over-grazing can be disastrous. For example, the United States consumes a large amount of beef produced in both Central and South America. Much of the land used to raise the cattle is obtained by burning tropical rain forests, an ecosystem essential for the existence of life on earth. As these forests rapidly disappear at the rate of 20,000 square kilometers a year, the planet's most diverse animal and plant communities are wiped out one by one. 
Ironically, the converted land will prove fertile for only three to five years before it is abandoned as wasteland and more forests must be cleared. The United States also consumes its own land in its dependence on meat as a staple. One third of America's surface is used in the raising of cattle. In the state of Montana, the cattle outnumber the people three to one. Land used for cattle grazing produces fifty pounds of meat per acre. In contrast, over twelve thousand pounds of corn could be harvested from the same surface area. By reducing meat consumption, one can diminish the need for de­stroying such an irreplaceable resource. 
The meat industry's needs include much more than land area. Huge amounts of food, water, and energy go into the raising of cattle and poultry. For example, if McDonald's alone sells the equivalent of 16,000 cows a week, one can imagine the staggering amounts of natural resources consumed by the United States' meat industry in a year's time. Fifty percent of all American crops are grown for the sole purpose of feeding cattle and poultry. To produce one serving of chicken and one steak requires the sum total of 3,015 gallons of water. The extent of this consumption could be reduced if there was less of a demand for meat products. 
Of course, the problem is not merely what these domestic animals consume but also what they produce. Due to an inefficient digestive system, one cow can produce as much waste as six humans. Overall they produce 1.6 billion tons of waste every year. Cows also happen to be a primary source of methane. As if our automobile driven culture is not creating enough of a greenhouse effect, we overconsume beef to the extent that cattle raising is destroying our atmosphere as well. 
Vegeterianism may not be the answer for every one, but simply reducing your consumption of beef by a half can make significant gains for the environment and your health. So the next time you go through the lunch line and laugh at the item on the "Vegetarian Fare" menu, remember what eating that burger means to the environment.

The University of Notre Dame needs to continue playing a role in promoting dialogue between corporations and environmen­talists, according to panelists who concluded the "Business Leadership in the Environmental Crisis" conference at the Center for Continuing Education. 
"This conference is a good starting point for dialogue," said Jack Lorenz, executive director of the Izaak Walton League of America. "The United States has come a long way," he added, referring to the country's progress in pre­serving the environment, "but we can do a lot more."

It is quite likely that the one issue that can bring the world together in the aftermath of the Cold War is the environmental issue, according to Former Secretary of the Interior obsession with the car, according to Udall. "The automobile culture as we know it today is not sustainable," he said. 
He stated that the government has to take measures that would wean the country from its cars, like significantly raising the tax on gasoline and en­dorsing the widespread use of public transportation. 
He pointed out that even though jobs would be lost because of the above changes, " ... a lot of waste is resources, and can be made useful. Begin a real recycling program, and here is a whole new industry with... thousands of jobs." 
Udall said Americans need to avoid being "frozen in the attitudes of the past, the mistakes of the past." 
He also addressed the performance of the present Administration on environmental issues and the Earth Summit in par­ticular. "This president has been a big disappointment to me. I have trouble connecting his words with his deeds," he said. 
New ETF agenda 
By DIANNE 
SIMODYNES 
Environment Writer 
The Environmental Task Force, which is comprised of students, faculty and adminis­trators, and meets at various times each semester to examine campus related environmental problems and imple­ment solutions, has several new items on its agenda this academic year. 
The task force, chaired by Thomas Mason, vice president of business affairs, did not meet over the summer, but will re­convene this semester to address new issues including revisions in the smoking policy and the report on the natural areas around the campus. 
The natural areas report determined six specific, undisturbed habitats which will not be considered as potential sites for University expansion. The areas are important not only because of their historic will drive corporate life in the future. 

According to Noonan, in the first 200 years of this country's history, only 20 environmental laws were passed, while in the last 20 years, more than 200 have been passed. 
But the panelists agreed that, while 
we have made substantial progress and witnessed a change in many of our habits, much still needs to be done. "We need to recycle our way of thinking," said Noonan. "The next 50 to 75 years are going

faculty for research and

One project completed over the summer was the removal of asbestos from the com­puter/math building, according to Mason. 
Probable topics of discussion this semester include the reduction of junk mail on campus and the excess amount of packaging used in the dining halls, according to Ronald Hellenthal, associate professor of biological sciences and member of the task force. 
Continuing programs this year include the recycling program, air and water quality testing, and the use of natural gas as an alternate fuel in several university vehicles, according to Mason. 
"The Environmental Task Force is the first project where the working relationship with students has been one hundred percent," said Mason.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Dear Editor: 
Upon reading Jon-Paul Hurt's letter to the Observer on Sept. 17, I felt that it deserved re­sponse. 
Jon-Paul Hurt, I respect your right to express your views to­ward alcohol and abuse, but when you start telling people how they should live their lives, I lose all that respect. 
You state that "getting drunk (is) a stupid way to waste an evening." For you, perhaps this is true, but for me and many others on campus it is not. 
I will be honest and 'admit that I drink and enjoy getting drunk. I don't consider this wasting my life, and it is cer­tainly not the "one and only means of having a good time." I drink because I like to and I want to. 
People drink because they like to drink, and if people want to get drunk at parties then I can only assume it is because 
DOONESBURY 
they want to. 

Simply choosing not to drink does not give you any right to go crusading against those who do. Your viewpoint toward al­cohol is no more "right" than mine, and I take great offense when somebody tells me how I should live my life. 
I am perfectly aware of the negative effects of alcohol, but that does not cause me to change my attitude about drinking. If you don't approve of what goes on at parties, then stop going; but don't expect people to change their lives just because you think they should. 
Mr. Hurt. please live your life your own way, and stop telling others how to live theirs. 
Just because someone acts differently does not mean that they act wrongly. 
Liam Mahoney Flanner Hall Sept. 17, 1992 
Check the dictionary, Irish Guard . .. 
Dear Editor: 
In the past few days, in wake of the controversy surrounding the Irish Guard, I could not help but notice in your publication that the Guardsmen have no less than three times referred to the allegations and subsequent actions against them as blasphemy. 
Webster's Dictionary defines blasphemy as: the act of insult­ing or showing contempt or lack of reverence for God" or as "irreverence toward something sacred or inviolable." 
One can only conclude that they would refer to these ac­tions as blasphemy for one of two reasons. 
Either they have extremely poor diction, which I find dis­turbing in students of such a university as Notre Dame, or they, in fact, regard themselves as Godlike, sacred, or invio­lable. 
If the reason for the reference to blasphemy by the Guardsmen is the latter, it reflects Webster's other definition of blasphemy: "the act of claiming the attributes of deity." 

If this is the case, it is easy to see how the Guardsmen could have caused their own down­fall. 
Molly Malloy Knott Hall Sept. 25, 1992 
.. . 'blasphemy' might not apply here 
Dear Editor: 
In regard to your Sept. 23 cover story about the suspen­sion of the Irish Guard, I must thank you for revealing to me that God has been on campus since 1951, and not only that, but also that He has attended every football game for these last forty years. 
I refer to the comments of Guard senior Chris Boone, who attributes the suspension of the Guard to, "rumors blasphemy, and other reports," and who characterizes the accusation of forced drinking involving Guard members as "one of the many blasphemous rumors." 
Now, I do not know about your dictionary. but mine de­fines blasphemy as: "a con­temptuous or profane act, ut­terance, or writing concerning God." 
Boone's comments thus seem to imply that the Irish Guard is, indeed, God, the Supreme Be­ing, the Almighty, the Creator of heaven and earth and Ruler of the Universe. 
This in turn raises some seri-
GARRY TRUDEAU QUOTE OF THE DAY 

ous questions. The Irish Guard is, after all, closely related to the band. Does this mean that the band shares in the Guard's Divine status? Is it therefore heresy to state that the band sounded out of tune at one game or another? 
I need to know the answer to these questions as soon as pos­sible, as it appears that the state of my immortal soul hangs in the balance.

Studying is

pleasure 
S 
tudy carrel! number 25: a second floor carrell on the South wall. $1,000, do I hear $2,000? $2,000 to the girl in the Sex Kills T-shirt. Do I hear $3,000? $3,000 to the guy in the Notre Dame baseball hat. Going once, going twice, sold for $3,000 to the guy in the baseball hat!" 
Welcome to the first annual "Study Carrell Auction", sponsored by Notre Dame's newest club, SLOP (Studying is Life's Only Pleasure). 
Yes, it's your wildest dream come true! SLOP has bought up all of the library's study carrells and is auctioning them off tQnight. Proceeds will go to benefit Notre Dame's newest charitable organization formed by SLOP, SOP (Stamp Out Partying). 
SOP is the combined effort of top University officials, students, and STUDS, South Bend's specialized study force, to squelch a students need for fun and relaxation. "Every moment wasted is a point lost, extracurricular activities are not for us!" is the groups' slogan. 
Four hundred library carrells, and 20 booths in LaFortune's Alumni room will be auctioned off. The booths are expected to be the least profitable as a result of the possible distractions of food and attractive persons strolling by the room's windows. 
All of the carrells have been refurnished 
in preparation for the auction. Each carrell has 
a key feature of a book locker attached 
underneath it so that the student can 
permanently leave his or her books without the 
inconceivable fear of having them stolen. 
In previous years, many students have had the horrible experience of having their books and/or notes stolen from their carrells; though many were able to purchase the books again from the bookstore, they wasted several quality study hours in the process. Several were unable to obtain jobs or get into the graduate schools of their choices as a result. The book lockers will alleviate this problem and save the careers of many serious students. 
Each student who purchases a study carrell will have his or her name engraved on a gold plaque on its wall. This feature, coupled with photo ID's will prevent 'imposters' from utilizing an individual's study area. 
In addition to photo ID cards, each student 
will receive special library keys to provide the 
opportunity to study all night long. 
Optional features will include, a refrigerator (so the student need not leave even for meals}, a desk lamp, alarm clock (for those pagans who may, perish the thought, fall asleep while studying), sound-proofing, and even a computer. What more could any college student ask for? These carrells are the Porsche's of study areas. 
AI Studitomuch, head of South Bend's study coalition, STUDS (Start Tons of Underage Studiers), supports the idea. He says, "We'll do whatever it takes to make these kids realize that their sole mission here is to study. If we can prevent just one student from becoming a worthless fool; to prevent one student from attending a football game, then our mission is successful. We won't give up until we've squelched their desires, until every last one of them lives to study, and studies to live. We will stamp out extracurricular activities. We are STUDS." 
Bea Nerdi, Social Coordinator of the auction, expects proceeds to top last years' "Slave-for-a-day" auction, in which students actually donated an hour of precious study time to be someone's 'slave.' Bea says, "Sorry Lou, but we expect to get over $20,000 for some of the most desirable twelfth floor carrells. We want to WIN. And I think most students realize that 'What's Important Now' is to study!"

Y 
ou have just finished a day of classes at one of the most 
prestigious universities on 
the continent. You grab 
some friends and head an 
hour away to some of the finest ski slopes in the world. It is the second week of June. 
No need to pinch yourself. This scenario is possible with a slight change of scenery. Just pack your bags and leave South Bend, Indiana for Santiago, Chile. 
The Santiago, Chile Program is the newest addition to the International Studies Program. The brainchild of its director, Father Tim Scully, its first student send-off for the fall semester is scheduled for early March. 
"This is the real study abroad program," explained Scully. "Students are completely integrated into Pontificia Universidad Catolica (PUC), one of the great universities in South America. Not only is the curriculum rich and diversified, students will be able to experience democracy as it happens." 
Chile, according to Scully, has been a laboratory of experiments for different political arrangements. "When I first went to Chile 13 years ago, I got off the plane and I remember the sensation that the climate was so very different. I don't mean the weather, though the seasons are reversed from ours. It was just very political. You feel politics in the air like you can feel sports in the air." 
It was the constant political change that kept a study program from being established. "There hasn't been a stable government until now," said Dr. Isabella Charles, Director of Inter­national Studies. "But we are now eager to build relations with Chile, especially since President Patricio Aylwin A. was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Notre Dame this past May." 
Another factor in choosing Chile as a study abroad location has been the presence of the Holy Cross Order in the country for over 50 years. Father Don McNeill, Director of the Center for Social Concerns, approached Fr. Scully with the hope to implement an optional seminar into the curriculum that would offer students a chance to participate with Chilean students in what he termed, "experimental learn­ing." 

"It is not a service project," McNeill stressed. "It involves more visitation, similar to an urban plunge. Students would have the opportunity to visit poverty areas where most inter­national students wouldn't go. They would learn of the situation of the poor by visiting shanty towns, which are found outside of the city. 
"I want to make it clear," he continued. "There is a difference between experimental learning and service. It would be presumptuous for students to go down and teach Chileans unless they've been there for at least a few semesters. If students want to do some service while they are there, we have the contacts, but like at Notre Dame, it is strictly voluntary." 
The program itself is open to a wide range of majors. Because students are integrated completely into the university, they must possess at least four semesters of college Spanish. 
Fr. Scully emphasized some of the benefits of Pontifical Catholic University. "Even when you first arrive in Chile, you have the opportunity to undergo an orientation program by the Latin American Faculty of Social Science. This is a world famous Social Science and Humanities research organization. Its headquarters are located in Mexico, Ecuador, Argentina, and Santiago, Chile. They are a very big deal in Latin America!" 
Students will also have access to very interesting political figures because of Notre Dame's and the Holy Cross Order's friends in the government. "All of Patricio Aylwin A.'s children and grandchildren were educated at Holy Cross universities. And the next possible president, Eduardo Frey, is a Notre Dame graduate," said Scully. 
Housing is provided by Chilean families selected by PUC. "Chile is a very warm and hospitable country. Students will live and eat with their Chilean families. They will love and fight with their brothers and sisters," laughed Scully. "You become a part of their family, for better or for worse!" 
A unique aspect of the Chile program is that students may choose to go for one or two semesters. 
page 9 
Students should be juniors during their year abroad, although special cases for sophomores or first­semester seniors will be considered. 
Because the project is in its ex­perimental stage, Notre Dame is joining programs administered by the University of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan. "This semester we are determining if students are interested," said Dr. Charles. "If so, we will establish a separate program from Wisconsin and Michigan." 
While the program is still un­dergoing its trial run, the expenses will be the same as what the Wisconsin and Michigan students pay. The fees are approximately $6,985 for one semester or $13,100 for an academic year during 1992-93. The figures include academic and program fees, room and board, books and supplies, and round trip airfare. 
Chile is a diverse land. The climate is a moderate one, comparable to Sacramento, California. Although only about 90 miles wide, it stretches down the coast of South America with Santiago located near the center of the country. An hour to the east are the Andes mountains and the coast is about 40 miles west. North is desert region and one of the driest areas in the world; it has never rained in recorded history. Far south it becomes tundra, similar to Alaska. 
Santiago is rich with culture, explained Scully. "There are cafes, theatre, music, poetry, etc. It's the type of place that students will go to in the evenings with friends to sip glasses of wine and talk." 
Scully is extremely optimistic of the program. "I only have two concerns," he said. "My primary one is about language. These students will not be speaking their 'mother tongue.' That can be a lonely and painful experience. I also hope that people are mature enough to know in some sense, we are all poor. The trick is to be in the world without becoming the world." 
Students interested in the Chilean program should pick up an 
application at the International

Studies office, room 420 in the Administration Building. Applications for the spring semester are due October 15.

Notre Dame soccer rebounds to defeat DePaul 

Special to the Observer 
The Notre Dame men's soccer team rebounded from a tough loss to Indiana with a 3-0 win over DePaul Tuesday in Chicago. 
Irish coach Mike Berticelli said his team would be ready to play, and they proved him right. 
Neither team put together much of an offensive attack in the first half, but the Irish got the job done when it counted. 
Freshman Shawn Bryden got the Irish on the board late in the half on an assist from classmate Bill Lanza. 
In the second half, sophomore Keith Carlson converted a header off a throw in from senior Brendan Dillman to put the Irish up 2-0. 
With 11 minutes left in the game, senior Kevin Pendergast 
Tickets $14/$12 
iced the victory with a goal on an assist from junior Mike Palmer. 
Pendergast's goal was the 28th of his career and he is now tied for ninth on Notre Dame's career goal scoring list. 
The offensive performance was quite an improvement over Friday night's game against Indiana, in which the Irish managed just one shot on goal. 
Defensively, the Irish held DePaul to just three shots on goal as sophomore goalkeeper Bert Bader recorded the 14th shutout of his career. He needs just eight more to tie Notre Dame's career shutout record. 
Notre Dame improves to 4-3­1, while DePaul falls to 5-3-1. 
The Irish return home Friday to face Xavier and again on Sunday when Dayton visits Alumni Field.

Consistency was the word of the day at Lou Holtz's press  
conference yesterday afternoon. The veteran coach told of a  
need for consistency when Notre Dame is on the football field.  
"We don't do the little things on offense that we need to do.  
We are not very consistent. We have become too much of a big  
play football team. I would like to see us become far more con­ 
sistent on offense that we are," said Holtz.  
Holtz praised the individual efforts of the offensive line in  
recent games, but once again spoke of consistency.  
"Justin Hall played well. Lindsey Knapp is a solid football  
player. Aaron Taylor has the chance to be an outstanding  
football player and Tim Ruddy is also expected to be a good  
football player.  
"Collectively (on offensive line), we haven't been as consistent  
or as good as we'd like to be. Individually, they're playing well,  
but collectively I worry about us. With Mirko Jurkovic, Gene  
McGuire and (Tim) Grunhard on the line, we were used to  
controlling the line of scrimmage and I feel that we haven't  
controlled it as we have in the past," said Hultz.  
Holtz was encouraged with the play of the Irish defense  
against Purdue. The Notre Dame coach said he was especially  
happy with the way the Irish stopped the Boilermakers on third  
down, but even the defense has room for improvement in  
consistency. Observer/Kyle Kusak  
"Defensively, I was pleased with the way we played. Our Notre Dame quarterback Rick Mirer and the rest of the Irish offense  
tackling was much crisper," said Holtz. "Consistency-wise, we is searching for consistency.

Magic Johnson is finally back where he belongs 
He's back where he belongs. 
When the Los Angeles Lakers travel 
to Honolulu next week to begin training 
camp, Magic Johnson will be along for 
the ride. 
It's good news for the Lakers and for 
the fans, but most of all, for Magic. 
"That court is where I belong, no 
matter what happens," he said 
Tuesday. ''I'm playing again. Finally." 
That's the sentiment of his legions of 
fans worldwide. 
No one has ever looked more 
comfortable on the basketball court, or 
more uncomfortable off of it, but more 
important concerns had to be 
addressed before he returned to the 
rigors of an NBA season. 
That kind of physical activity is 
unprecedented for someone who is 
HIV-positive and his doctors simply 
don't know what to expect. But since 
his retirement last November, Magic 
has worked out tirelessly, adding 
fifteen pounds of muscle and tons of 
hope for a successful return. 
"There's some good and some not so 
good," Lakers team doctor Michael 
Mellman said. "He's going to listen to 
his body and we're going to listen to 
him." 
Some people say that a strenuous 
basketball season could ultimately take 
his life, but he is never more alive than 
when he is on the basketball court. 
Take basketball away and he suffers. 
His fans suffer too. 
They miss seeing him grab a 
rebound, turn and fire a bullet of a 
court-length bounce pass to a streaking 
James Worthy. 
They miss seeing him take a pass in 
the lane, muscle up against a defender, 
spin and sink his baby hook shot. 
They miss seeing him step up to the 
three-point line in a big game and bury 
that ugly jump shot. 
Now they will see it all again. 
But what keeps bringing him back? 
After winning five NBA championships 
and three MVP awards, what's left? 
It's not the awards that bring Magic 
back, however, it's his love of the game. 
Even a life-threatening illness can't 
keep him from competing. 
Questions about his health will hang 
like a cloud over his every move, but 
even Magic Johnson wouldn't sacrifice 
his life just to play one more game. 
He and his team of doctors will 
monitor his condition carefully and 
constantly, and the moment his health 
begins to deteriorate, he will leave the 
game for good. 
But for now, he's healthy and he's 
here to stay. 
And he won't dwell on his illness or 
the repercussions that a grueling NBA 
season could bring. 
Instead, he is simply looking forward 
to the competition and the chance to 
return to the game he loves. 
His fans are happy to have him back, 
but Magic is even happier. 
This is where he belongs.

Consistency is Holtz's main concern against Stanford 
Magic Johnson returns to the Lakers 
Despite illness, Magic can't leave the game that he loves 
INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -Unable to leave the game he loves even to fight for his life, Magic Johnson returned to pro basketball Tuesday. 
Less than a year after retiring because he had contracted the AIDS virus, Johnson announced that he will play again this season for the Los Angeles Lakers and said it was only natural. 
"That court is where I belong, no matter what happens," Johnson said, speaking in the same room where his bade his sad, shocking goodbye last Nov. 7. 
''I'm playing again," he beamed. "Yeaaaa. Finally." 
Johnson probably won't play full time­50-60 games is the starting point for this season -and he'll be checked and double-checked by doctors who admit they don't know just what the grind of professional basketball will do to a man with Johnson's medical condition. 
But from the parquet floor of Boston Garden to the Roman pillars of the fabulous Forum, he'll be back, wearing No. 32, flashing that big smile and playing the game as only Magic can. 
"It's time to go back to work, it's time to have some fun," Johnson said. "I think the positives outweigh all the risks. That's not saying there are no risks, because life itself a risk. But being out there, I won't be worried about that. If I was concerned about that, I'd still be retired." 
The mood this time was decidedly different from that retirement announcement 327 days ago. This time, Johnson frequently laughed and joked with his wife and reporters, flashing his famous trademark smile. 
"This is a lot more relaxed ... better," said Johnson, showing the bulk of an added 15 pounds he gained through rigorous weight-training. "It was much tougher then, because I was having to say goodbye." 
Johnson's wife, Cookie, said she was behind his decision to return "totally ... 100 percent." 
Since Johnson announced his retirement, there had been a steady stream of speculation and controversy about his future, mixed with his triumphant appearances in the NBA All­Star Game in February and the Olympics this summer. It was that success and the lack of additional medical problems that convinced Johnson to return. 
"The true test for me was playing against the players in practice on the Olympic team and watching as I was just getting better and better, playing hard against them every day, going at it like it was a regular game," Johnson said. "Also, getting back here, putting on 15 pounds, playing every day, as we did this morning with the guys at UCLA. 
''I'm feeling good and it's time to get back to what I was doing." 
Johnson, 33, said there was never a time after the Olympics that he thought he wouldn't return, but waited to make the announcement because, "Now is the perfect time. It's only a week until training camp." 
The Lakers report to Honolulu on Oct. 8 to begin preparations for the season. Their first game is Nov. 6 against the Los Angeles Clippers.
