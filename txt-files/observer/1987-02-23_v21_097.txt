Scholastic hit with suspension 
By TRIPP BALTZ and MARK PANKOWSKI News Editors 
Scholastic, Notre Dame's student magazine, has been suspended from publication by the Student Activities Of­fice, according to a letter made available to The Ob­server late Sunday night. 
The letter, dated Feb. 22, stated Scholastic was suspended because its editors "printed a photo­graph of an artistic work ... (which) was removed from the fall edition of the Juggler by the Student Activities Of­fice." 
"The decision to run the photograph in the Scholastic was done without consulta­tion with or knowledge of the Student Activities Office," which acts as publisher of the magazine, the letter said. 
There was no indication early Monday morning as to how long the suspension would last.

STUDENT I University of ACTIVITIES Notre Dame 
February 22, 1987 

The Scholastic is a publication of the University of Notre Dame under the direction of the Student Activities Office. In this relationship, the university acts in the capacity of publisher, as it also does with the Jufgler and the Dome. All three publications are to opera e under the-iame policies designed in accordance with the mission of Notre Dame. In this relationship, it is unrealistic to depict the Student Activities Office as censor since censorship is an external influence and the Student Activities Office, as publisher, is not external. 
In the February 19, 1987, edition of the Scholastic, the editors printed a photograph of an artistic work by Nick Antonakis. This same piece of work was removed from the ~all edition of the Juggler by the Student Activities Office. The decision to run the photograph in the Scholastic was done without consultation with or knowledge of the Student Activities Office. Since the Scholastic is under the same policies as the Jufgler and operated contrary to these policies, operat ons of the Scholastic will be suspended immediately. During the suspension, new operating procedures are to be drawn up addressing proper production schedules to assure against further incidents. 



ND grad: Police use 'scare tactics' 
By CHRIS BEDNARSKI Assistant News Editor 
Lawyers for an agency of the state of Indiana are "outraged" at reports of what they call "scare tactics" used by the South Bend Police De­partment when handing out al­cohol violations at off-campus parties, according to 1986 Notre Dame graduate Kevin Flynn. 
Flynn said the agency, which he declined to identify, is inves­tigating an incident in which three students were charged with public intoxication and an­other student with underage drinking. The agency is also in­vestigating other incidents, he added. 
The reports stem from the possible administration of breathalyzer tests without probable cause at a party on Mark Street last fall and the possible misuse of field tests, according to Flynn. The admin­istration of the breathalyzer test, however, is the "main thing," he said. 
According to the agency's lawyers, the events described by the students when having the test administered to them would constitute violations of Indiana law, said Flynn. The agency must now investigate whether or not the complaints were legitimate, he said. "They have to prove they were legitimate" for anything to happen. 
Ifthe agency determines that the complaints are legitimate, they would initially only inform the city, Flynn said. "They wouldn't charge or sue the city," he added. 
If the misuse of the breat­halyzer tests continues, however, then the agency could "bring a lawsuit against the city," he said. 
Flynn, a resident assistant in Morrissey Hall last year, said he first became interested in the reports when he returned to campus last fall for a football game. He said some of his friends complained about the way South Bend Police ad­ministered the tests. 
Mter initially looking into the complaints, Flynn said he con­tacted lawyers for the agency because he didn't know In­diana's alcohol laws. 
Flynn said South Bend Police are biased against Notre Dame students because they only see their bad side. "I knew some South Bend cops, he said. There is a real bias towards the stu­dents. (The officers) would readily admit to it." 
Flynn asks any student who feels his rights may have been violated to write to P .0. Box Q at The Observer.

Vicious rumors are out that his university teeters on the verge of bankruptcy. Despite the popularity of this TV evangelist, word of mouth has it that Roberts is having trouble paying his bills. 
To make matters worse, Roberts awoke from a peaceful sleep some weeks ago because of a divine summons of the type Old Testament prophets learned to dread. In a revelation Roberts reportedly heard the voice of God com­mand him to raise eight million dollars by the first of April or face death. 
When he told his television congregation of this heaven-sent mission and turned to them for support, he apparently pushed his popularity too far. News reports originating in Tulsa, the Vatican City of Roberts' new breed of Christian fundamentalism, claimed the TV audience was outraged by the reverend's plea for ransom money. How could they believe that God had given Roberts a pecuniary ultimatum? For many it was simply beyond the limits of credibility. 
All of this must have come as quite a blow to the poor old reverend. His intentions seemed as good as ever, that is, to raise money for a worthy cause, namely his church and its am­bitious educational program. In the past, viewers contributed generously whenever money was lacking. The public recognized him as the Lord's servant. So why should the faithful suddenly doubt his integrity? 
Some of his parishioners argued that God does not stoop so low as to take his own minis­ters hostage for a financial cause. Other fun­damentalist preachers criticized the divine ul­timatum as far-fetched and even absurd. It was as if rationality and common sense had sud­denly become the criterion of what is to be believed in the fundamentalist religion. 
It is a sad thing to see the sheep abandon their shepherd, but this is apparently what was happening. 
Of course the media exaggerated the stories of church dissent. After the initial reaction of bitter disbelief checks soon began to roll in. A New York Times article last week even re­ported that students at Oral Roberts University were not skeptical of their leader's agreement with God, but disappointed with the way his

gathering, the devil snuck into his room 
. ' 
JUmped on his bed and took a life threatening grasp of his throat. As Roberts tells it, while gasping for breath he somehow managed to yell for help. Moments later his wife arrived and promptly "rebuked" the devil by ordering him from the room. 
The good Reverend Roberts is an American, and so unlike the Bhagwan of Oregon fame, he 
. cannot be chased out of the country. He is per­fectly free to continue his battle with the forces of the netherworld. In all likelihood he will con­tinue to do so -his life is still officially on the line. Nevertheless, by this point friends and close associates must be suggesting a safer profession, perhaps insurance sales or real es­tate. The risks are simply not as great.

voting. 
The run-oft election for the junior class officers will be held Tuesday at Haggar College Center from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
Commenting on the student body election, Hetterich said, "To be honest, being 10 percent behind (in the first election), it came as a big surprise. And 
52.4 percent is still close." 
All members pf the Hetterich ticket agreed they were very excited about the victory, with Hashagen adding, " ... and ex­tremely shocked." 
Hashagen said they attribute their victory to "hard work and knowing what the students want. 
"I think it was, like it said in The Observer (endorsement), our approachability ... I think people just felt maybe a little more comfortable with us." 
She added, "We were happy we got the Ann Rutger (ticket's) support (after the first election)." 
Hetterich said, "The first thing we want to do is go out and get in touch with the stu­dents. We really want to let people know that they can come to us." 
Parrish said one of her office priorities will be to continue to pursue current Vice President for Student Affairs Betsy Burke's work on negotiating senior comprehensive exam policies with the Saint Mary's administration. 
All three officers-elect also emphasized the necessity of all aspects of student government working together with the ad­ministration, with Parrish stressing "mutual support." 
Hetterich, Hashagen and Parrish will replace Student Body President Jeanne Heller, Vice President for Student Af­fairs Sarah Cook and Vice President for Academic Af­fairs Betsy Burke on April 1. 
According to Cerimele, 50 percent of the student body voted in the elections. "It was the biggest election turnout that we've seen in years. We're impressed with the student body's participation," she said. 
Cook said, "I'll lend my sup­port to student governmental­ways, but I don't know how di­rectly." She said she plans to pursue "other things on campus that I want to get in­volved with but never had the time for before," as well as pro­grams that she currenly sup­ports. 
Winterhalter said she plans to stay involved with student government, possibly applying for a position on senior board. "Even if I don't get a position, I will continue to get involved,'' she said. 
She added she has confidence in the officers-elect. "All three are very good leaders." 
Student Body President Jeanne Heller said the Het­terich ticket has a challenge before them based on their campaign slogan of "Changes." 
"I think we've set up a good base this year. It will be inter­esting to see what changes they will make," Heller said. She addedthatstudentgovernment awareness has increased this past year, evidenced by the high voter turnout.

Suspension 
continuedfrom page 1 
The letter stated, 
however, that "during the 
suspension, new operating 
procedures are to be drawn 
up addressing proper pro­
duction schedules to assure 
against further incidents." 
Scholastic Managing 
Editor Keith Harrison said, 
"We are trying to contact 
(Vice President for Student 
Affairs) Father Tyson and 
until then we have no com­
ment." 
Scholastic Editor Maher 
Mouasher declined com­
ment. 
The letter was made avail­
able to The Observer at ap­
proximately 11 p.m. Sunday 
by Director of Student Activ­
ities Joseph Cassidy, who 
declined comment. 
Scholastic printed the photo of the artistic work, which appears to be of a man and woman embraced in a sexual act, in its Feb. 19 issue. 
The photo originally was 
removed from Juggler's fall 
edition. In its place, Juggler 
printed a different piece of 
art work, along with the 
statement "Original choice 
censored by the Office of 
Student Activities.'' 
According to Cassidy's let­
ter, Scholastic is subject to 
"the same policies as the 
Juggler." 
Because Scholastic 
editors "operated contrary 
to these policies, operations 
of the Scholastic will be 
suspended immediately.'' 
Notre Dame's student handbook du Lac states "student publications should be free of censorship and ad­vance approval of copy, and their editors and managers should be free to develop
their own editorial policies and news coverage. At the same time, this editorial freedom entails the corol­lary responsibility to be governed by the canons of responsible journalism and allow for the expression of various points of view." 
Cassidy's letter states that "it is unrealistic to depict the Student Activities Office as censor since censorship is an external influence and the Student Activities Office, as publisher, is not exter­nal."

University-ron committee could aid student life 
In the past several weeks, many people have asked me what my views on student government are. Most have phrased the inquiry negatively. "What is wrong with student government?" My answer is everything and nothing. 
Bruce Lohman 
guest column 

Actually SG is both a total waste of time and a fruitful expenditure of one's energies for the betterment of our com­munity. Confused? So am I. With four years of activities behind me, I still don't know if any of my efforts have been worthwhile. Most often I think that I have contributed to Notre Dame in some small, yet imperceptible way. Other times, however, I realize that I should have spent more time trying to educate myself. Should I have listened more frequently to my roommate? "My advice to you, Bruce, is to start drink­ing." I should have listened. He's pre­med. 
Can we do anything to help SG? Yes, we can. SG can become a proud, effec­tive organization if three easy steps are taken. I will try to describe the first step today. 
What does SG really do? I believe that most students do not know. But almost all students have an idea of what they think SG does. Most students think that SG works to improve student life, or to be more specific, student life which falls under the title student af­fairs. Most students think that SG is incapable of getting anything accom­plished in this area. SG is broken down. Most students are correct in their think­ing. 
What can we, as students, do to fix SG? Nothing. No matter what we do, SG is as effective as it will ever be. Remember that we are presently using Crayolas as our main instrument of communication. 
Should we just quit? Bow our heads in shame that we ever thought that SG could do important things? Drink heav­ily to wash away the despair? 
Not yet. Let us put our egos aside for a moment. Is there anyone in our com­munity who can resuscitate SG? Of course, there is. Who? The Administra­tion can help us. I am not kidding. The men in the Dome are our only hope. What can they do for for SG? Invite SG to the party. No laying of the hands or exorcisms necessary. Just a simple in­vitation. SG doesn't need oxygen. SG needs an ego boost. 
What is this invitation? It is a formal invitation to discuss student affairs is­sues at Notre Dame. A formal invita­tion is a request for formal student in­put. The invitation would take the form of a council-call it whatever you wish. 
Its characteristics are simple. The most prominent feature is that the chairman is the president of the Uni­versity. It would consist of a con­glomeration of all members of our community. The council would have an Executive committee co-chaired by the two Vice-Presidents of Student Affairs (the one from the Dome and the one from LaFortune). Grunt work would be done in committees. Each member would have··one vote. The decisions of this Council would become University policy. The chairman would have veto power. But this power would be used very infrequently. Maybe never. 
The ratio of members, of course. would be a great matter of concern. I would suggest a ratio of 2 students: 1 administrator: 1 rector: lfaculty mem­member. Multiply by six for a total of 
30. 31 if you count the chairman. Stu­dent members would consist of 8 elected hall presidents. The four remaining student seats would always go to the Vice-President of Student Af­fairs, the HPC chairperson, the Judicial Council chairperson, and the Senior class president. Four ex-officio seats is a big ego boost. 
Doesn't this invitation already exist in the Campus Life Coucil? No, because the Student Body President chairs the 
CLC. This title is the quintessential facade of power on campus. The SBP cannot do this job. Why? Because every year the SBP is someone new. Second, the SBP is not knowledgable enough about the issues before the Council. Fi­nally, the SBP can say forget it and not lose his job. The president of the Uni­versity can not. Talent is seldom enough to guarantee job performance. Responsibility must be present, also. 
If the chairman was the president of the University, however, the Council would gain tradition and respect almost immediately. Further, guidance and direction could be given to all mem­bers. There is nothing wrong with a little guidance. We students need this guidance most of all. At present, no one is expected to do things in this area. We want to have something expected of us. Respect for student input comes only as the result of students fulfilling expectations. 
So, what if the Administration is not willing to make this first step? (for reasons why they probaby will not want to extend this invitation, I refer you to a fine column, "Where Captains of In­dustry Sink," by R.C Longworth of the Chicago Tribune.) One possibility is to just keep using the informal invitations which already exist. These would be the CLC, the Student Senate, SG's cabinet members, and anyone else who might take the time to try to communi­cate with the Administration. What do all these have in common? Whether your idea is accepted or not depends on the whims of those who sit in the Dome. (Many things are influential in their decisions: alumni donations, parents' letters, whether breakfast settled prop­erly, etc.) Honestly, I believe that a letter from "Suzy in B-P" is just as, if not more, effective than a CLC resolu­tion. The use of these informal avenues is the reason why most students think SG is dead now. So, I reject this option. 
Three options remain, all of which are as acceptable as any of the others. 
1. Party more and forget about it. 2. Redirect your energies into you own dorm. Your hall president and rector could probably use your help. 3. Redirect you energies to those areas where a formal invitation already exists. 

The Administration has given out plenty of formal invitations . They simply forgot one. Unfortunately, the one which they forgot is what most stu­dents find important. It is the one party that most students think SG should be attending. 
At present, we can only watch this party through the windows. Some­times, the Administration will throw us a piece of cake. Most often, they tell us to go home and study. SG needs to stop feeling sorry about its sad condition. Stand up and ask for an invitation. We don't want to be invited because we are students and, as such, deserve to be invited. We, the students, are an asset of the University. An unused asset. 
I think that students can help the Ad­ministration; not to run the University, but simply to help improve our com­munity. However, they have a business to run. As the responsible directors oi our Univeristy, the Administration has the right to choose which assets to em­ploy and which not to employ. 
I am not calling for democracy. Notre Dame is, unfortunately, dissimilar to a Greek oikos. I am simply asking for an invitation. Use us in a beneficial man­ner. Maybe then, students will stop having that used feeling and poor old SG will stop bearing the brunt of stu­dents' cynicism. Responsible student imput, as Professor Plantinga might say, lurks somewhere in the near neigh­borhood.

P.O.BoxQ 
Dome's dirty condition inhibits proper tribute 
Dear Editor: 
What is the first image brought to mind when people speak of Notre Dame? For many, like myself, it is of the dazzling Golden Dome supporting Our Lady of the Lake against a cloud­less blue sky. For others it may be of the tranquill Grotto hidden in the grove behind Sacred Heart Church. Both monuments represent our tribute to Mary in all her splendor for the whole world to see. 
Did I say dazzling Golden Dome? I stand corrected. Have you taken a good look at at the dome lately? Grimy is a more appropriate adjective. How can our administrators ignore the natural defacing occuring upon the very roof of our Administration Building -at the very center of our beautiful campus and the administrative center of the university? What kind of impression does this neglect make upon our visitors? 
Daresay the administrators that the dome is cleaned at regular intervals and it.is not yet time for its refinishing? Would a corporation neglect to replace damaged equipment because it has not reached the end of its expected useful life at the time? When the Grotto was all but destroyed by fire in 1985, it received prompt publicity and a reconstructive attention. It would not be permitted to remain in shambles. Is it not improper, also, that our Golden Dome should remain in such neglected condition? 
Costs must not deter the university from refinishing our nationally renowned Golden Dome. Do not let it be said that the University of Notre Dame is too cheap to pay proper respect to its patron saint.

officer are outlined 
Somebody help me! I am suffering from the senior election blues. This is the first year that I have not neglected my studies for more than a week, have not imposed my election aspirations on my friends, have not inspected every dorm on campus, and have not de­signed campaign materials, including the obnoxious buttons. I still fail to sleep enough, but that's college. What ails me is the realization that my Student Government experience is ending, but that also means that other enthusiastic and talented students will be able to benefit from the leadership experience as I did. I would be remiss if I did not entice other students into the offices that I held for three years. I loved all of it.

guest column 

Let me state my purpose. I am recruiting all dedicated, creative, and enthusiastic underclassmen into stu­dent government. A new student body president and vice president have been elected, and soon will appoint a cabinet of approximately thirty. Call the new president, and ask him how you can get involved. The Student Activities Board is accepting applications for all com­missioner positions including: Cultural Arts, Campus Entertainment, Ideas and Issues, Movies, Musical Entertain­ment, Publicity, Services, and Special Events. There will be new hall presi­dents elected, and many positions will be awarded. Student government is ap­pealing to all interested students to in­vestigate all the possibilities on the second floor of LaFortune. 
The remainder of this plea will focus on the class offices. As senior class president, I am responsible for the promotion of the class officer position, and for explaining how to run an office. Having held a class office for three years, I can explain the different focus that each year will concentrate upon. As sophomores, the major concern is providing functions that allow your classmates to meet each other. These can be very simple events: study breaks, service projects, masses or a dance at Theodore's. The pace begins to quicken during the junior year with JPW, spring break trips, and formals. Finally, during senior year, the sky's the limit: Senior Class Trip to Jamaica, Senior Formal in Chicago, skiing at Boyne Mountain, Senior Bar specials, and Commencement Weekend. Throughout all three years, the concen­tration is on class unity, and almost any well publicized event can serve this purpose. 
Interested in my job? I hope so! Tonight, Monday, Feb. 23, there is an informational meeting for all inter­ested class officer candidates. The Om­budsman people will explain the rules, and give suggestions about campaign­ing. This meeting is completely option­al, but there is a mandatory meeting on Wednesday. At that time, you and your running mates will sign-up and receive petitions. In order to be listed on the ballot, you will need 100 signa­tures from members of your class to be turned in by 5:00 on Monday, March 
2. The campaign will begin Tuesday night at midnight, and will continue un­til midnight of Monday, March 9. Class elections will be Tuesday, March 10, and a run-off will follow on March 12. The winning ticket must receive a majority vote of the total number of students voting in each class, so usually a run-off is necessary. So in a matter of three weeks, you can go from totally uninvolved, to the president of your class. 
How do you get elected? Have inter­ested friends, creative ideas, reveal your dedication, and campaign door-to­door. You will need a campaign staff of 30 people or so, in order to canvass the campus with your campaign ma­terials, and to drum up grass-roots sup­port in each dorm. You must be able to control your people, since your ticket will be held totally responsible for their actions. No election should be a mud slinging free-for-all. I suggest that your platform consist of many traditional events, and also creative new events, but they should all be achieveable. Fi­nally, the winning ticket is usually the one that has knocked on every door on campus, and has best revealed their dedication to the class office that they are seeking. While campaigning, ask for new ideas from your classmates, and encourage them to get involved no matter who wins.

Dear Editor: 
Much to my dismay I happened upon an article in the Feb. 13 Observer re­garding the problems of living off­campus. In response to that article, let me begin by addressing the residents of the Northeast neighborhood: Notre Dame students will live off-campus and this is as much their town as it is yours. Second, Notre Dame students aren't such a dangerous and evil group as you seem to think. We don't rape, kill, rob people at gun point or burglarize homes. These, however, seem to be reg­ular occurrences in your "precious" neighborhood which Notre Dame stu­dents fall victim to. If you really are so concerned about the quality of your neighborhood why not concentrate on the elements that are causing the crime, violence and insecurity, and quit using Notre Dame students as scapegoats. You should appreciate the fact that your student neighbors attend a small, private Catholic institution and not an out-of-hand state college. As far as rezoning, that may well be the fate the neighborhood deserves. "Say hello to your new neighbors and goodbye to your hubcaps!" 
I would next like to address myself to those so well respected South Bend officers of the law. I guess you guys never went to college. You can't seem to tell the difference between students hanging out and having a good time and the real crime which plagues these streets. Your attack dogs certainly can't tell the difference. Go ahead and polish up your night sticks and practice your chokeholds. 
In conclusion, I would like to add that I myself am an off-campus student. So far this year our house has been broken into five times, the stereo was ripped out of my car, and rocks have been thrown through our windows. It shouldn't be surprising that none of these times was one of those fine, upstanding South Bend police officers there to protect our rights, nor were any of our "concerned neighbors." It seems, however, that whenever we throw a party, a whole host of club­swinging, life-threatening puppets show up. And they weren't even invited.

come to me crying, searching for some­one to reassure him that his world was not falling apart. What most bothered him, I think, was he never knew why he felt what he did; his moods were unpredictable and often time un­motivated. 
When my brother's mood swings grew increasingly unpredictable and intense, his doctor hospitalized him. Physicians discovered that in his case a chemical imbalance caused the dis­order. They administered the drug Lit­hium, and monitored him for reactions. He improved steadily, and after two weeks was discharged. 
I infer, perhaps incorrectly, from Jacoby's story that her friend commit­ted suicide. Not all manic depressives consider killing themselves; my bro­ther never did. Even during his depres­sive mood swings he maintained an out­look that someday he'd get better. Now a freshman at an out-of-state college, my brother is just as normal as the rest of us. He just has to take two pills at breakfast to keep his body's chemicals on track. 
No one story completely charac­terizes all manic depressives. There are different causes for this disorder, and different symptoms. My brother was lucky to receive the care he did, and his problems were relatively short­lived. Mary Jacoby's friend was less fortunate. Manic depressives do often recover from their disorders, and go on to live normal, happy lives.

NVA thanks students for 'late night' support 
Dear Editor: 
The department of NVA wishes to thank all of the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students who participated in the Late Night Olympics a week ago. With your help, we had a great event and raised over $1700 for the St. Joseph County Special Olympics. 
Thank you once again for your sup­port and interest in what we hope will be an annual event.

Dear Editor: 
I read with interest Mary Jacoby's inside column of the Feb. 16th Observer on a childhood friend whom doctors diagnosed a manic depressive. Bipolar disorders have generated a lot of inter­est lately. I fear, however, that some readers of Jacoby's story may make false conclusions about the nature of these disorders. My brother was diagnosed a manic depressive two years ago. I know the misconceptions he's had to face. In writing this, I aim to clarify. In no way do I criticize Mary Jacoby's article. 
Not all manic depressives 'go crazy'.

my name, I've tried to rep­ly, "Walsh. Kevin Walsh." For a while I tried to pretend that my name had the same resonance as James Bond's, but I was wrong. Of course. 
Some names just don't work as well as others. It's a pitiful

Orville?) should go into some name time capsule somewhere so that people can laugh at them in a hundred years, but they should be banned from ever being used. 
So, I'm just going to lay down some guidelines here about names that shouldn't be 

ley. His shirts would have been initialled SAP and for good rea­son. I don't see Seymour as a major rock 'n' roll star. The chicks would not scream for Seymour. History would have been changed. Actually, Elvis started to look a lot more like a Seymour in the later days when he was in Las Vegas singing Sinatra songs in a white, rhinestone pantsuit looking like a sweaty Pat Sum­merall with sideburns. 
On the flip side of that what would have happened to Her­man Hitler? Or what if Napoleon had been named Charo? World domination would still be a wide open field. 
With all this in mind, I'd like to start a motion to outlaw cer­tain names from everyday usage. For Instance, look at your grandparent's real names (not Wa-Wa or Doody or whatever childish pet name you created for them as a kid) and you can be pretty sure that those names should be retired. Any name used in The Far Side can safely be abolished. All the names of the Brady kids can be counted among the mis­sing. I mean, could you name somebody Bobby, or Cindy, or Marsha in good conscience?? No. The names of all the astronauts (Buzz? Gordo?) and both Wright brothers (Wilbur? 
are being tipped a little higher than they should be. For guys, names like Archibald, Claude, Edgar, Herbert and Leonard imply the use of an eighteen­wheeler weigh-in station for the morning weight check. 
HILLBILLY NAMES: These are mainly composed of two perfectly fine names stuck to­gether for unknown reasons, like Billy Bob or Daisy Mae. We're really playing with fire when we talk about compound names because they suggest serious defects of character. Defects like warts, genetic in­feriority or turning into one of the Waltons without warning are implied in compound names. Even if you're not like that after a few years, people will think you are. 
NAMES THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO HEAR ON A REGULAR BASIS: I used to know somebody named Gay. No joke. How do you greet somebody named Gay? "Hey, Gay!?" No. "Having a good day, Gay?" Wrong. I often wondered if the deficiencies in her char­acter were caused by hearing that silly name every day. Think about it. 
NAMES THAT YOU LIKE THE SOUND OF: This is a great one. People who name their kids Milton or Claudia just because they've "always thought it's pretty." It's a pretty twisted wa tentatively. His face would turn 
red. Everybody in the class 
would wince. 

"Urn, here," he would reply, then in the manner of a bruised puppy, he'd add, "Uh, I like to be called Andy ... " Once he went over the brink. "ITS GERMAN, OK??! ITS NOT ONLY A GIRL'S NAME!!?" Then he began babbling things like "It's only a name... " and " ... it's all my parent's fault. .. " It was not pretty. I think somebody told me he's a wanted criminal now. Another pathetic case of being stigmatized by a name. 
"CUTE" NAMES: Does anybody realize what hell it would be to be named someth­ing cute like Robby or Laurie? Initial names sometimes get a little too cute also. No J.J.'s or A.B.'s allowed. 
JUST PLAIN UGLY NAMES: Claire, Claudia, Eleanor, Ethel. and Harriet as serious names should be wiped off the face of the earth. Who can take a Henry, Lester or Theodore seriously? 
NAMES WITH NICKNAMES: Don't name your kid Richard, Chip, Art, Dirk, Jack or Chuck. 
Just don't. 

So let's really keep this in mind. We literally have not only the names, but in fact the char­acters of the entire next gener­ation. Let's not blow it. We still have time.

Marriage: The love of God 
The beauty of the sacrament of marriage is that it is an opportunity for a couple to experience God's love in a new way through each other, said Tracy Sandman, coordinator of marriage preparations program at Notre Dame's Univeristy Ministry. 
In an interview Friday Sandman said engaged couples need to seriously ask each other if their mar­riage will last forever; it is a chance to reflect on their own sense of faith. The couple needs to "see how God acts in their own life and how they experience God through the love of their partner," she said. 
--Marriage involves unconditional love she said, adding, ''The mystery to me is that in experiencing that type of love in another person, you can begin to experience the love of God." Sandman said the program she runs is specifically geared to engaged couples but "a lot of couples have come to us who are thinking about be.:oming engaged." The preengaged, as she calls them, consider issues about whether or not their relation­ship is mature; what attracts them to each other, and whether or not those attractions are life-time attractions. Infatuation is a key element espe­cially with physical attraction, she said, adding, "A mature relationship 
goes way beyond just the physical part of the relationship." 
With engaged couples, the most common problem they have is how to fight with each other and resolve conflict, she said. Each individual has a different way of dealing with con­flict. Usually one person will want to discuss the problem immediately where as the other person may need to step back from the situation in order to discuss the problem calmly, she said. 
"Each person has to let the partner know what they need at that time," she said. It is difficult for an engaged couple to fight because they are so much in love, they don't know how to share a negative feeling. Also during engagement, she added, it is easy to overlook the negative feelings. 
When an engaged couple comes to see Sandman, they are instructed on the requirements of the Church. The couple can either attend a weekend retreat or enter into the host couple program. This involves the engaged couple meeting with a married couple in their home discussing different aspects of married life. 
The engaged couple is also given the pre-marital inventory survey. This is a questionaire given to each person individually. Categories in­clude questions concerning: realistic expectations, personality issues, com­munication, conflict resolution, finan­cial management, leisure activities, sexual relationship, children and marriage, family and friends, equalitarian roles and religious orien­tation. 

"The inventory is only a reflection of the relationship at this point in time," Sandman said. The couple is not given their scores, but instead they are given the number of items they agreed on and disagreed on. "If the couple had many disagreements, we ask them to reflect on the rela­tionship." 
The length of dating is important especially for college-age students, she said. It is helpful to have separa­tion and see each other in different settings, other than school. It is a myth or misconception that there is only one person for everyone, she said. "Young couples divorce because they meet someone else who they are equally attracted to," and thus feel challenged and scared, she said. It is normal to feel attraction towards another, but the person shouldn't act upon it. There must be a commitment to the relationship and that's the trick: "making it work," she said.

A priest's view on marriage 
What does a priest know about marriage, or a celibate about sexuality? What can one who has chosen a more solitary way of life say about intimacy? What does reli­gion have to do with relationships? 
I don't pretend to be an expert about marriage, but I do claim to have a sense for the spiri­tual1>acramental dimension oi mar­riage and relationships that comes from experience, reflection and many hours of conversation with couples. 
Christians consider marriage a sacrament. There's nothing magical about sacraments -mysterious per­haps, but not magical. A couple doesn't actually "get married" at their wedding. The wedding is a celebrationproclamation of the mar­riage, the lived commitment; it begins before the organ bellows "The Wedding March," or should I say before the guitarist strums "The Wedding Song," and continues, hope­fully, long after the lights go out and the church is empty. 
A wedding, like the celebration of the other sacraments, is a sacred moment that proclaims God's pres­ence and action in our lives -that's 
the mystery -not just at the moment of celebration but "as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be." In the Eucharist we are reminded ~hat God nourishes and sustains us all the time. In Reconciliation we celebrate the undefeated love of the 
God who blesses us with forgiveness in the midst of our folly, simul justus et peccator, (we are at the same time just and sinful) . In marriage we are witness to the fact that God is one with us as love makes us one, and that this unity is no fly-by-night affair in a cheap motel, but is committed, forever, and is lived out in the temple of God that is our body!Self. 
God's ways were made most visible to us in the person of Jesus, the sacrament par excellence of God. We 
know through his life, death and resurrection that God, like any good lover, has given himherself to us totally and has entered intimately into the darkest corners of humanity. 

When a couple unite themselves in marriage they join in the chorus whose voice gives praise not only to the love they have for each other, but also to the composer of the composi­tion. The harmony of their life to­gether is related to, and a reflection of, the one who wrote the tune. From time to time our voice goes flat and our timing is off. Sacraments survive our inadquacies. It is important that we sing on key, but even when we do not, even when disharmony strains a marriage, it remains, if the couples see it through, a sign of the fact that God is with us in good times and in bad, for better and for worse. 
What I have written barely touches the surface of the mystery that lies at the heart of our life and our relation­ships. What it boils down to is, God's love is us, and through our lives the sacrament of hisher presence is in­carnate.

4. 
IF one party says things like, "I can't live without you. My life has no meaning apart from you. IF I ever lost you I would kill myself." 

5. 
IF the majority of times you have been together in the last three months you have developed a "pattern of quarelling, of disap­pointing, seriously irritating or hurting" each other. 

6. 
IF many of the significant, ma­ture people in your life-parents, relatives, teachers and especially good friends who love you  indi­cate that you are making a mis­take. 

7.

8. 
IF he-She has had more that five or six jobs in the last two years. 

9.

11. 
IF you are marrying because you "just have to get out of the house." 

12.

Dallas Comegys scored a career-high 33 points and Rod Strickland added 28, leading fourth-ranked DePaul to an 84­67 triumph over Georgia Tech. 
The victory was the ninth straight for the Blue Demons, who improved their record to 25-1. Georgia Tech, which upset Duke 79-72 on Saturday, fell to 16-9. 
DePaul led 21-16 at halftime, then outscored Georgia Tech 9­4 during a second-half spurt to take a 54-43 lead. DePaul took command in the second half despite the fact that Comegys sat out nearly four minutes with four fouls. 
The Blue Demons fell behind 8-2 early in the game as they made only one of their first 11 shots from the field. 
Georgia Tech held a 21-17 lead when Kevin Edwards scored for the Blue Demons. Edwards followed with a steal and a dunk to tie the game at 21-all. Rod Strickland put DePaul ahead with 3:42 left in the half and Comegys scored six of DePaul's last eight points before intermission.

SMC swimmers beaten by Calvin, place fourth in Grand Valley Invite 

By JANE SHEA 
Sports Writer 

The Saint Mary's swim team lost to Calvin College on Wed­nesday by a score of 138-97 bringing its record to 5-4. 
"We had the overall depth, but we did not place high scores in all events," said Head Coach Nancy Jo Kuzmitz. 
Sophomore Peggy Halloran . swam very well and won both the 500-yard and 1000-yard freestyle with times of 5:53.47 and 12:01.85. 
Meghan Rafferty, a junior, took first in the 100-yard back with a time of 1:08.78. Senior captain Patty Juckniess placed third in that event with a time of 1:10.77. 
The Belles were also winners in the 400-yard relay with a team consisting of Rafferty, Halloran, freshman Julie Courtney and Erin Tierney. Their time was 4:08.20 
Honeyghan keeps belt 
Associated Press 
WEMBLEY, Eng., -Brit­ain's Lloyd Honeyghan stopped American challenger Johnny Bumphus in two explosive rounds to retain his World Boxing Council and Interna­tional Boxing Federation wel­terweight titles. 
Referee Sam Williams of Detroit halted the contest ­scheduled for 15 rounds -after 55 seconds of the second round when the challenger, from Mount Laurel, N.J., was caught on the ropes and heading for a third visit to the canvas. 
Honeyghan already had floored the 26-year-old Ameri­can in the first round and also knocked him down -illegally, according to the referee -at the start of the second. 
"We did, as a whole, put in some good individual perfor­mances for our last meet," said Kuzmitz. 
On Friday and Saturday Saint Mary's swam in the Grand Valley Invitational and came in fourth out of eight teams with a score of 231. 
Rafferty swam excellently winning the 100-yard back and taking third in the 200-yard back. Her first-place time of 
1: 08.02 made her eligible for Nationals. 
In the 500-yard free Jennifer Veslik, a junior, had her best time of the season of 6:21.75. 
Sophomore Jenny Mac-Dougall placed 12th overall and was in three individual events on Friday. 
All the relay teams placed in the top seven places on both Friday and Saturday. 
The Belles have 10 swimmers going to Nationals on March 6 and 7.

Irish put together year's best game to defeat No. 23 Demons, 53-44 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
CHICAGO -The Notre Dame women's basketball team up­set No. 23 DePaul, 53-44, here Saturday, putting together their finest effort of the season. The Irish finally came away with the "big win" that has eluded them during their troubled 1986-87 campaign. 
The victory gave Notre Dame head coach Mary DiS­tanislao her 200th career win. Her 12-year record currently is 200-109. In seven years with the Irish, DiSitanislao is 111-79. 
"It's just a figure," said DiS­tanislao of the 200th victory. "It's nice, though. I don't event think of it in terms of goals. I'm just really happy that we got the win here at DePaul. I'm happier that it's our eighth win of the season." 
Notre Dame improved its overal) record to 8-15 while DePaul dropped to 18-6. The Irish are now 2-2 in North Star C(.nference play, one game be­hind the Lady Blue Demons who are now 3-1 in the confer­ence. 
Notre Dame was in control of this one from the opening tip, which junior point guard Mary Gavin took to the left side of the key and canned after only four seconds had elapsed. The Irish never lost the lead, playing a relentless 2-3 zone defense and patiently execut­ing their offensive game plan to control the game's tempo. 
In January, DePaul defeated Notre Dame 80-68, at the ACC behind the high-scoring guns of Diana Vines (28 points), Sally

salvaged four bouts. Haugh also defE~ated Phillips in the meet. 
"I've touched that level of fencing before, but I've had a problem with consistency," said Haugh. "When coach came over, it was kind of like when someone comes over and kicks you. It makes you think about what you're doing." 
"I tried to break the momen­tum," said DeCicco. "I've been around fencing long enough to know that when something like that happens, you can lose nine bouts before the guys realize that they're not thinking straight." 
Mter Saturday's 17-10 win over Big Ten power Illinois, it was only a matter of the sun coming up Sunday morning for the men's team to go unde­feated. While a team from Wayne State came and fenced, it didn't look like other Wayne State teams that have battled Notre Dame on the strip for

"I thought they were going to shoot free throws, but they took the ball out of bounds," Archibald said. "I wasn't trying to stall or anything. I think the referees should have seen what I was trying to do and could have handled it dif­ferently." 
Incidentally, there was no foul called on Royal as he made the shot. 

Anderson (22 points) and Melanie Ehrhardt (16 points). On Saturday, however, the Irish held the trio to 35 points. 
"The last time we played them, 66 out of their 80 points were scored by Vines, Ander­son and Ehrhardt," said DiS­tanislao. "So we just decided that we were going to go five on three. That's why we played the 2-3 zone like we did." 
It was a true team effort from the start, as all five starters hit a field goal in the opening minutes. Junior for­ward Sandy Botham hit several short jumpers down the stretch and led all scorers with 16 points. Sophomore Heidi Bunek added 12 points. Anderson, the senior point guard for the Lady Blue Demons, led her squad with 14 points. 
DePaul tried to frustrate the 
Irish with a tough full-court 
defense throughout the game, but the Notre Dame backcourt duo of Gavin and sophomore Diondra Toney patiently dis­sected the Lady Blue Demon press while committing only three turnovers. 
"You just have to be confi­dent that you can make one mistake and you don't have to make a second," said DiStanis­lao. "And they did that. They played comfortable. DiDi (Toney) and Mary (Gavin) are very complementary of each other." 
Toney scored 11 points and came up with the clutch play whenever a DePaul rally threatened the Irish lead. The sophomore pulled down six 
years. The men whipped the into first place on the Notre Tartars, 23-4, while the women Dame career win list. won by a 13-3 score. The men finished with a 22-0

Gavin, the 5-6 quarterback of the Notre Dame offense, pulled down six boards herself and, as usual, set up several Irish buckets with her stellar pass­ing. 
The Irish took a 28-21 lead into the locker room at halftime, holding DePaul to a .310 field goal percentage on 9­29 shooting. DePaul closed the gap for the last time early in the second half as Diana Vines, averaging 21.4 points a game for the Lady Demons, fought for eight quick points. That brought DePaul to within two, 34-32, with 11:41 remaining, but ,. that was as close as they would come.

"It was our best game this year in the sense that we beat a really good team," said DiS­tanislao. "We did what we had to do to stop them defensively and we kept the pressure on them offensively." 
And when it was over, the crowd of 866 watched a jubilant Notre Dame team celebrate its upset victory. The Irish had beaten a conference rival, and the 23rd-ranked team in the nation, in an un­friendly environment. But most of all they had beaten ad­versity, which has loomed like a dark cloud over the Irish all season. Saturday, however, the forecast was all sunny.

Iris1lt take another close decision, holt~ off Utah rally to win, 57-~;6 
By MAmrY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 
SALT LAKE CITY -When Chris Fulton fired his three­point shot at the buzzer with the game on the line, it was a freshman in his face. 
Joe Fredrick forced the Utah guard's bomb to sail too far in the thin mountain air, and Notre Dame pulled off its fourth win in a row with a 57-56 victory over the Runnin' Utes at the Special Events Center on Saturday. 
And the spotlight was on the Class of 19190. 
In the last minute of a game which could have gone either way, Irish head coach Digger Phelps went with a trio of fresh­men -Fredrick, Jamere Jack­son and Seott Paddock -even wlien it seemed the lack of ex­perience on the court would cost the Irish the ballgame. 
With Scott Hicks (sore thigh) and Sean Connor (sprained ankle) sidelined, Phelps did not have much choice. 
"We had to go with our fresh­men," Phelps said. "They're

Fencing teams finish undefeatc!d, De~2icco gets 500th career victcJry 

By TEHRY LYNCH Sports Writer 
When it was all over, Todd Griffee and Rich Daly dumped a bucket of ice on top of one of the hottest coaches in Notre Dame his­tory. 
It was a fitting end to the fencing program's in­credible weekend that left both the men and the women on top of the Midwest fen­cing seene, and · served notice to the rest of the na­tion that Notre Dame fen­cing still has the stuff that national championships are made of. 
Along the way to that pin­nacle, Head Coach Mike DeCicco claimed his 500th career victory, which was only one of many records made at Saint Mary's An­gela Athletic Facility. With going to make mistakes but they did the things they had to do to win. Fredrick forced Ful­ton to take a bad shot at the end and, more importantly, he didn't foul him. 

"Without Hicks and Connor, this was a big road win for us." 
The Runnin' Utes took their first lead since the first half with 53 seconds remaining in the game, when Mitch Smith (17 points) sank a pair of free throws to make the score 56-55. 
After a Notre Dame timeout, Irish guard David Rivers launched a 17-footer which kicked high off the rim, and sophomore Mark Stevenson was fouled as he went back up with the rebound with 40 seconds showing on the clock. Stevenson made two from the charity stripe to round out the scoring, but not the action. 
With Albert Springs and Jimmy Madison out of the game with five fouls apiece, substitute guard Sie Moore was inserted for Utah, and he promptly skipped a bounce pass out of bounds with eight seconds left. 
that achievement, DeCicco now boasts a 502-40 (.924) career record. The men's fencing team is currently riding a 75-meet winning streak. 
Yet for all that, DeCicco shied away from the spot­light that all those wins con­spired to put on him this weekend. 
"I'm more concerned with the graduating seniors, be­cause if win number 500 didn't come today, it would have come sometime in my lifetime," DeCicco said Sat­urday. "The undefeated season becomes more and more elusive every year, and it's important that the seniors have that." 
Indeed, there were plenty of other heroes on Saturday than DeCicco. Sabreman Kevin Stoutermire went un­defeated in the sabre against Illinois, paving the way for a crucial 6-3 advantage in the sabre bouts. 
 "I was thinking about it all last night," said U.e senior sabre captain. "In my mind I had myself winning yester­day. The key for me was to stay on top, because once you're on top, that's half of it." 
The epee team had a struggle on its hand:; against Illinois. Two top-ranked fen­cers, Miles Phillips and Tim Hensley, fueled the Illini to a quick 3-0 advantage in the weapon. DeCicco called the epee team over for a timeout, and sen1 or Tim Vaughn responded by stop­ping Phillips in the next bout. Senior John Haugh fol­lowed by defeating flensley, and eventually the epeeist 
see TOPS, page 14 
Fredrick was fouled on the inbounds pass, mis:ied the front end of a one-and-one, · but hustled back and forced the bad shot at the buzzer. 
The Irish upped their record to 17-7, while the Utes fell to 16-10. 
"We played four freshmen tonight a lot," Phelps said. Tony Jackson pi ayed three minutes and pickE!d up three quick personals. "They're going to make mistakes, and you have to live w1 th that. 
"We've lost close road games like this at UCLA, Kansas and Vanderbilt, and tonight we played well enough to win one." 
Junior forward Donald Royal led the Irish with u, points, and also fouled out of the game in the final minute. Rivers added 13 and Stevenson picked up 12. 
Gale Gondrezick hit from in­side and out for the Utes, leading them in the scoring de­partment with 19. 
"We played very well and were patient coming back," said Utah head coa ::h Lynn Ar-

Notre Dame took a close decision from Utah Saturday. Marty Strasen has the game story at left as well as a look at the game's officiating below. Officials' performance makes coach cry 'foul' 
By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 
SALT LAKE CITY -Days before his team eked out a 57-56 victory over Utah here at the Special Events Center on Sat­urday, Notre Dame coach Dig­ger Phelps predicted a war. 
But someone once said all is fair in war. Saturday night, it seemed nothing was fair, as the officials blew their whistles at anything which remotely resembled contact. 
All things considered, a war would have been much more exciting than the first half, which took nearly an hour to play. 
"(The referees) didn't let the teams play in the first half," said Utah coach Lynn Ar­chibald. "They didn't even make it a basketball game. Too many little things were called that they shouldn't have called. If a guy doesn't get an advan­tage on a little bit of contact, I don't think you should call something. 
"You want the kids to play and have fun. That's what we're out here for -to have fun. And I just don't know about some of those calls." 
Especially in the first half, Ed Risteau, Dave Hall and Louis Fuentes (all from the Western Athletic Conference) seemed to be the only ones en­joying themselves. They called 27 fouls in the first 20 minutes -16 on the Runnin' Utes and 11 on the Irish. 
Two Utah starters, Albert Springs and Jimmy Madison, each had three fouls at the in­termission, and each fouled out of the ballgame. Forward Donald Royal fouled out late in the game for the Irish. 
A total of 47 fouls were called 
in the contest. 
"I think the officiating definitely hurt us," Archibald said. "We had some of our best players on the bench with foul trouble, and you just can't beat teams like Notre Dame without your best players." 
One call which especially in­furiated Archibald was a block­ing foul on Mitch Smith mid­way through the second half on a Royal turnaround jumper from the paint. Smith was hit with a technical for arguing the call. 
"I thought it was a cheap technical foul in a big game like this," said Archibald, whose Utes trailed, 45-42, at the time, and fell behind by a 50-42 score after an ensuing Notre Dame run. Utah's next field goal came more than four minutes later. "(The official) wouldn't even explain to me what Mitch did. I just don't think a techni­cal foul is called for in that sit­uation for showing some emo­tion.'' 
Phelps did not fault the offi­cials for their tight reign on the game, but attributed the num­ber of calls to his team's strong inside play. 
"We go inside all the time," Phelps said. "That's a trait of Notre Dame teams and that's what we do well. We go at people because we want to get teams in foul trouble, and we want to get in the bonus. 
"That's just how we play." 
One of the stranger plays in the game occurred with fl: 17 to play, when Archibald called a team huddle near the sideline to regroup after a Springs foul. 
Meanwhile, the referee handed Irish guard David Rivers the ball underneath the bucket, and he simply handed it to Royal for an uncontested slam dunk.
