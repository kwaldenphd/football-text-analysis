Get the scoop on campus candidates 
As everyone who has entered a dorm bath­room knows, campaigns have been heating up lately for the next campus presidential election. 
The suspense as to who will win is probably killing everyone. Yet everyone pays so much attention to the national contest that we actually hear more about Iowa these days than Califor­nia. By contrast, no one seems to have bothered to inform the campus about the odds for the much more imminent Notre Dame student body election. 
To put an end to this terrible state of affairs, I will now give my preview of what to expect this week, based on extensive research con­ducted in the Flanner Hall lavatories. 
I have to admit this year's election doesn't look easy, but at least it doesn't look nearly as confused as the national presidential contest. In that election, after all, the apparent leader of the Democrats dyes his eyebrows, and the best bet among Republicans has the same name as a pineapple. By contrast, the outcome of our campus election looks much more obvious. Let me start with the candidates who have come up with by far the most eloquent campaign slogan. I refer, of course, to the burning issue Ellen Nichols and David Lese have raised on posters throughout campus, asking "Have you ever ... ? " For which their conclusion is, "So have we." 
Who do they think they're fooling? Could the double entendre be more blatant? Despite the lack of subtlety, on just this basis, I would say they'd be shoe-ins. 
Mter all, this is the year 132 A.F. (Mter Freud), and getting something sexual into what you have to say has the same effect today as getting something about God into it in the Middle Ages. 
Unfortunately for Nichols and Lese, however, they've failed to realize one thing: 52 percent of the students on this campus haven't. 
By contrast, Steve Viz and Chris Boron come across as the height of respectability in their posters, and Chris looks pretty cute besides. Unfortunately, Steve alienated half the campus last year when he proposed to keep the vile South Quadders out of the North Dining Hall. I don't know what you'd call this --quadism? -­but this is sure to draw numerous outcries against campus apartheid. 
Then there's Bill Pelino and Dana Togden ticket, whose motto is "We speak your lan­guage!!" Yes, you guessed it: another in­sidious, thinly veiled campaign against foreign exchange students. 
On the other side we have the radically middle of the road Doyle and Paese, whose platform is about as original as a T.J. Hooker episode. Name one candidate, for instance, who opposes "continued and expanded service to students." 
Still, they take a much tougher stand than Rado and Hines, whose sole slogan, as far as I could tell, is, "Please take the time to read our posters and our mailers ..." It doesn't seem to have occurred to them that this presupposes their posters are already being read. 


Equally uncommitted seem to be Keegan and Dodd. In the posters I saw, both are pointing in different directions to unseen people off­camera (the other candidates?) and Dodd has an unmistakable "don't look at me" expression. Assertiveness is obviously not the major appeal of this ticket. 
But then Berger and Carrigan go much fur­ther than to point to the other candidates, saying you have to "be a nut" to elect them. The basis of this slogan seems to be a Doonesbury strip. This is reason enough to vote against them. 
Not to be outdone in the "nut" category, however, there are Matt Micros and Pat Sheehan in their posters doing headstands before the Hesburgh Library. 
I don't know what exactly this is supposed to prove, since hands extending from off-camera are propping them up. Perhaps this stunt has a limited appeal--for Dillon residents, for ex­ample --but I don't think the student body at large will stand for it. 
Finally, we have Christopher Jones and Joe Shank--"C.J. and Chachi." Imagine what your non-Domer friends will think when you tell them your chief student body officers are "C.J. and Chachi." The only thing we'd lack then is Joanie. 
Now that I've made myself the person most likely to be purged this April, you may be won­dering who's left that I could predict as winning the election. 
My choice, I think, is the obvious one. 
I foresee Mikhail Gorbachev forcing a tie, but in the end Spuds MacKenzie will take it all in the runoff.

has responded by opening up the U.S. market to Mexican textiles, leather goods and other products. 
De Ia Madrid has strongly pushed the market-opening moves as a way to help moder­nize the sickly Mexican eco­nomy and pull it out of its lengthy economic crisis. 
A perennial source of irrita­tion had been the U.S. attitude that Mexico was not doing its best in the fight against illegal drug trafficking because of of­ficial corruption. 
But the Mexicans now have practically forced the United States to admit that there is corruption on both sides of the Rio Grande and that the drug fight must be a joint effort. 
Mexico is a large producer of marijuana and heroin for the 
U.S. market and a relay point for South American cocaine. 
Secretary of State George Shultz stressed the importance of the anti-narcotics campaign, saying Colombia was an exam­ple of a situation where drug traffickers can become a pow­erful and disruptive factor in a society.

Clever pilot foils hijacking attempt 
Associated Press 

DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania A Tanzania Airways pilot tricked four hijackers into· believing he had flown them to Kenya, then landed his plane at a Tanzanian airport where troops overpowered and ar­rested the young men Sunday. 
Capt. Dominic Ngandile also managed to send a secret distress signal to the Dar es Salaam airport, which turned off its terminal and runway lights, making it look like a small Kenyan airport, aut­horities said. 
Mter landing, the pilot stalled the assailants, telling them they would have to wait until daylight to refuel the plane. Just before dawn army troops stormed the plane and arrested the hijackers. 
The hijackers stabbed Ngan­dile in the neck and hands after they realized they had been tricked. His co-pilot, Christop­her Mnika, suffered cuts on his hands. The injuries were not serious, said airline and secur­ity sources who spoke on con­dition of anonymity. 
Among the 70 passengers on the Saturday night flight were two senior government offi­cials --Home Mfairs Minister Muhidin Kimario and Hamad Rashid Mohamed, deputy min­ister for finance, economic af­fairs and planning. None of the passengers were hurt. 
Officials said the four hijack­ers arrested Sunday made no

political statements or claimed any affiliations and that their only demand was to be flown to London. 
The Boeing 737 carried a crew of six on the internal flight between Dares Salaam, the na­tion's capital, and Kiliman­jaro, a northern town near the Kenya border and the site of Mount Kilimanjaro, Mrica's highest mountain. 
Shibata, the government­owned news agency, said the four hijackers were from Zan­zibar, the semi-autonomous In­dian Ocean island nation that with the mainland forms the Republic of Tanzania. It said they were aged between 17 and 20. 
"Mter takeoff, three youths ~tormed into the cockpit and announced that the flight had been hijacked and that they were going to London via Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and Egypt," government-owned Radio Tan­zania reported. 
Ngandile told the hijackers that the plane did not have enough fuel to reach Addis Ababa and suggested he refuel instead at a small airport at Ludwar, Kenya, the sources said. 
The hijackers agreed. 
Instead of heading for Kenya, Ngandile flew the plane in a wide arc and headed back to Dares Salaam. Mter he sent the secret distress signal, air­port officials turned off some airport lights. 
The Boeing 737 landed about 
10:30 p.m. and taxied to the old Dar es Salaam terminal.

Although there has been no firm indication whether the ex­periment will be expanded, continuing articles in the press indicate the idea is still very much alive. The party confer­ence in June could set the stage for making the system per­manent and nationwide. 
Gorbachev has also brought a little democracy to the working place. The Soviet par­liament, known as the Supreme Soviet, last June approved com­petitive elections for managers of state enterprises to make them more accountable.

Currently,  only  top  party

South Bend patrol experience shows police officer at work 
By ERIC M. BERGAMO Senior Staff Reporter 
Editor's note: Eric Bergamo rode patrol with Captain Patrick Cottrell, East Sector supervisor, Friday night. This is his report. 
A Friday night patrol can get busy at any time, according to Captain Patrick Cottrell. 
"On Friday night it can start jumping right after roll call," Cottrell said. "In fact, a lot of times it can start on day (shift)." 
Fridays in the winter, however, tend to be less hectic because of the cold, he said, adding when the weather is warmer calls increase. 
Because Cottrell is the only captain on duty this Friday evening, he must supervise all three of the city's police sec­tors: East, West and South. 
People may not realize the extent of responsibilities of the police officer, Cottrell said. 
"The police officers in this town are not only are respon­sible for the citizens that live here ... but we're responsible for all the people that work here and students that live here ... (plus) people that are visit­ing ..." Cottrell said. 
On a normal night there are six to seven patrol officers covering the East Sector, Cot­trell said, adding that one or two officers from the Fifth Detail, a special unit that works from 6:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m., may also patrol the sec­tor. 
The East Sector alone covers a large area of South Bend, Cot­trell explained. Chapin Street and Portage Avenue form the western boundary. The nor­thern boundary runs along An­gela Boulevard and State Route 23, then twists over to Hickory Road to form the eas­tern boundary of the sector. The St. Joseph River and Sample Street is the southern edge. 
The residents of the East Sec­tor cover the ec;onomic spec­trum, Cottrell noted, from the poor sections of the Northeast · Neighborhood to the wealthy residents of Jefferson Boulevarrl 
The Northeast Neighborhood is one of the areas in the East Sector that has a large crime problem, he said. The 300 block of Chapin Street, called "The Block," also has a high rate of crime, he noted. 
But there are other areas in the city that have problems with crime, Cottrell said. 
The 1200 block of West Wash­ington Ave., lined with boarded-up buildings and run­down bars, is referred to as "The Shooting Gallery" for the high number of shootings there in the past year, he explained. 
The Southeast Neighborhood is also a big problem. South Michigan A venue between Broadway and Bronson, where bars such as Ramona's Car Wash and the Ace-Hi Lounge are located, is where South Bend's prostitutes ply their trade, Cottrell said. 
Even the downtown area is not immune from crime, suf­fering from a high number of car break-ins and purses stolen from buildings, he said. 
There were not many calls this night. Cottrell responded to a call on a suspect wanted for a failure to appear warrant on Lincolnway West. He gave a ride to two teenagers hitchhik­ing along North Side Boulevard and was on the scene of a car in a ditch on Sussex Avenue. Cottrell pulled over a car that ran a red light on South Mic­higan. 
During a brief stop at the East Sector substation, a call came in of a "man with a shot­gun" at 427 West LaSalle Ave. When Cottrell arrived, five cruisers were already on the scene. Cottrell got out and con­Cered with the officers on the scene. Soon two men, hand­cuffed, were led from the house to waiting cruisers and driven off. 
Cottrell came back to the car. "Family dispute," he said. No shotgun was found at the scene. 
The two men had been taken in because they were believed to be wanted on warrants, though one would later be released since the warrant on him did not exist. 
A family dispute is "the worst call you can get," Cot­trell noted. 
"Whenever you're dealing with a family fight, you're dealing with so much emotion on the part of the people in­volved," he said. 
As for students, all police ask is they "obey the law," Cottrell said. 
"As long as they obey the law, there aren't going to be any problems," he added. 
Students can have parties, Cottrell said, but "when you have a blowout, then you're not having a party." 
Students also don't under­stand how much work, or luck, it takes to catch a burglar, Cot­trell said. 
"There could be somebody breaking into that house right there; how would we know it," he said, "unless we seen them smashing the door down or smashing a window in?" 
Burglars also have someone looking out for them and spend little time in the house, he said, adding that burglars are usually caught when a neigh­bor calls in about a break-in. 
Ifstudents had good relations with their neighbors, bur­glaries could be cut down, he said. 
Much of the crime in South Bend can be linked to drugs, Cottrell said. 
"People break in to get the VCRs and TVs to sell to buy the drugs. A lot of crime in town revolves around the drugs," Cottrell said. 
Drug activity is spread out throughout the city among "the rich and the poor and the 
J-council learns police do more than raid parties 
By ERIC M. BERGAMO Senior Staff Reporter 
Six members of the Notre Dame Judicial Council went on patrol with South Bend police officers Friday night in an effort to improve rela­tions between students and police. 
"We wanted to make con­tact with the man on the beat in a non-confrontational set­ting," said Judicial Coordin­tor Brendan Judge. Judge said the experience "was a real eye-opener. The gravity of crime in the city is much greater than I thought." 
Judge said he felt the pro­gram was successful in im­proving relations. 
"All the people who rode seemed very impressed with who they rode with, and the officers were receptive to them," he noted. 
Dillon representative Paul Irving rode with Sgt. Chuck Eakins and found him to be "very cooperative." 
"He answered a lot of my questions. He was very upfront with me and didn't hold anything back," Irving noted. 
Eakins told Irving that most officers don't try to make trouble for students while breaking up parties, thought there are some poor attitudes towards students by some officers. 
Eakins also told Irving that "they (the police) don't enjoy breaking up parties." 
There are more pressing incidents for police to check than breaking up parties, Farley representative Rebecca Seidel said. 
"One of the definite things we found out was that they 
have much better things to 
do than break up Notre 
Dame parties," Seidel said. 
"They've got so much else 
to do that they really don't 
go over to break up a party 
unless they have to, unless 
they've gotten a number of 
complaints from neigh­
bors," she added. 
"When an officer goes to 
an off-campus party he has 
no choice ... he's respond­
ing to a complaint, and he 
has a job to do," Judge said. 
The officer Judge rode with stressted the inital con­tact between the student and police. 
"If a student approaches the scene with a cooperative attitude, then the officer's attitude will be more under­standing," Judge said. "But if someone objects he's (the officer) put with his back against the wall because he has to follow orders. He has to protect the rights of others." 
Seidel said her impression of the police improved. 
"I got a lot more respect for them ... I didn't realize the kind of responsibilities they had and just how many things they really have to deal with," she said. 
The program was the result of a meeting last month between the Judicial Council, South Bend Police Chief Patrick Hurley, St. Joseph County Sheriff Joseph Nagy and University offi­cials, Judge said. 
Also riding with the police were off-campus represen­tative Bill Kaberlein, Keenan Representative Artie Feles and Council As­sistant Chairman Scott Swick.

Bill Pelino was the last of the candidates to give opening remarks. He said his primary interest was to increase spirit at Notre Dame. He proposed an event each weekend to give people a reason to stay on campus. He added that he wanted to "end the eliteness of Student Government," so that students could feel comfortable about calling student govern­ment officials.

Doyle-Paese ticket deserves support 
This year no student body presidential ticket definitively stands above the rest. Of the nine, however, the ticket of Tom Doyle and Mike Paese is the best suited for the offices of student body president and vice president. 
Although their ideas are not different from those of their opponents, or those of years past, Doyle and Paese bring the freshest attitude and approach toward achieving their goals. 
Doyle's experience as Grace Hall president gives him a dif­ferent perspective of student government than the other eight candidates. He has stayed out of the bureaucracy that some candidates have been caught in. 
Others may have more student government experience, but their approaches are stale and have proven to be ineffective. 
Doyle's enthusiasm, sincerity and composure are his greatest assets. These attributes make him the most qualified for a position which entails communicating to students as well as administrators. 
During the campaigning process, year after year students are promised cable television, co-educational dormitories, or laundry machines in male dorms. These promises, however, are not fulfilled and often forgotten. 
Doyle's sincerity is convincing in that he'll seek out student needs and not forget them if elected. While Doyle may not accomplish all his goals, his enthusiasm indicates that he will at least follow up on his promises. 
Doyle said he'd like to replace what he calls "apathy" with a spark that starts from the office of student body president. His enthusiasm would make that possible. 
During Sunday's presidential debate, Doyle displayed com­posure in presenting his platform and answering questions. That confidence should enable him to deal effectively with both student demands and administrative red tape. 
Students look to student government to get things done. They deserve someone who has a creative approach to meeting stu­dent needs. Doyle is that someone. 
Make him your choice on Tuesday.

P.O. Box Q 
Abortion issue warrants analysis 
Dear Editor: 

Mr. Gundersen stated in his Feb. 5 letter that "incomplete analysis (of the abortion issue) must be avoided." I heartily agree, and think that he sorely needs to heed his own advice. 
Mr. Gundersen referred to a Right to Life "sexist attitude." Apparently he has never heard of Feminists for Life, Concerned Women of America, the Eagle Forum, WEBA (Women Ex­ploited by Abortion) or any of the many other women's pro-life groups. Neither did he mention Birthright, Maternity Homes, Rachel post-abortion help groups nor the multitude of problem and crisis pregnancy centers, including South Bend's two Women's Care Centers. Indeed, the Right to Life movement is very much for the right of all women, including those little wo­men in the womb. Pro-lifers simply do not believe that a woman has the right to destroy the body and end the life of an innocent human being. 
Mr. Gundersen would disagree here, for he referred to fetuses as "potential human beings" rather than "human beings." Come now, Mr. Gundersen, even the pro-abortionists recognize that the fetus is a human being. I quote from the Senate report, 97th Congress, S-158: "Physicians, biologists, and other scientists agree that conception marks the beginning of the life of a human being -a being that is alive and is a member of the human species. There is overwhelming agreement on this point in countless medical, biological, and scientific writings." The Supreme Court declared however that the unborn human being is not a "person" -in the same way that it declared in the 1857 Dred Scott case that blacks, though human beings, were not persons. 
Mr. Hahn, in a Feb. 1 column, states that the millions of abortions today are "an atrocity comparable to the Nazi holocaust." Mr. Gundersen called this assertion "ridiculous." But consider the following three excerpts: 1) "An unborn child likely to present heredi­tary and transmissible defects may be destroyed." 2) "It had nothing to do with humanity -it was a mass. I rarely saw them as individuals. Jt was always a huge mass." 3) "If you are going to kill all these people, at least take the brains out so that the material could be utilized." Quotes from modern day abortionists? They very well could be, but in fact they are the words of the 1933 Hamburg Eugenics Court; Franz Stangle, the commandant of Treblinka; and Nazi doctor Julius Hallervorth. The vocabulary and actions of Nazis and abortionists are strikingly similar. Both involve the "treatment," "removal" and "evacuation" of the "unwanted", the "defective", and the "economically or socially unuseful." Both also involve "experimentation." 
German doctors were killing institu­tionalized handicapped children in 1939. The murder quickly spread to include the learning disabled, the elderly, am­putee World War I veterans and even bed-wetters. In total, 300,000 "defec­tive" Aryans were killed. It was then that an entire race was termed defec­tive, and six million Jews were mur­dered. As was noted in the 1977 Cancer Bulletin (vol. 29, no. 4), "In 1944, a physician in Germany could partici­pate in genocide with legal sanction; in America he would have been a mur­derer. In 1977, an American physician can perform an abortion with legal sanctions; in Germany he would be a murderer. We have come 360 degrees on the moral compass." 
Dr. William Brennan's "The Abor­tion Holocaust" describes in great detail the analogy between the two holocausts. I recommend, in the inter­ests of complete analysis, that Mr. Gun­dersen read it.

Isis Gallery shows students 'what's happening in art' 
THERESA LOOMIS accent writer 

C
ontrary to the belief of some non-art majors, the Snite Museum is not the only art gallery on campus. Located on the third noor of the Riley Hall of Art and Design, the Isis Gallery of­fers a wide range of ex­hibits. 
It is said that the Egyptian goddess Isis, after whom the gallery is named, often (J changed her appearance but continued to be venerated in her new forms. The same can be said of the Isis Gallery itself. 
During 1970 a group of students established the gallery in a locker room of the Old Fieldhouse. They initially displayed their own work but later began includ­ing the work of faculty mem­bers. Gradually, the faculty took over management, lending a more professional atmosphere. 
The Isis Gallery moved to its present location in the spring of 1983. It is now operated by faculty advisor Richard Gray, assistant pro­fessor in Notre Dame's art department and students enrolled in the gallery man­agement class. The class is limited to five students and, 
although it is open to stu­dents in all majors, priority is given to junior and senior art majors. 
Amy Taschler, a junior art major who is taking the class for a second semester, believes the presence of stu­dents from other concentra­tions is a definite benefit. "Everyone has seen a museum and has different ideas on how to approach an exhibition. They (non-art majors) contribute a lot of fresh ideas," she said. 
Taschler stressed that Gray is an advisor only-­students take charge. It is a "hands-on class." As Gray said, "The idea behind the class is contact with the ar­tists and their art. It is an experiencial class in gallery management." 
The students work as a group on the first show so that everyone gets a general idea of each task. After that, however, they rotate duties with each exhibit. 
Major responsibilities in­clude publicity, graphics, gallery preparation, and opening night arrange­ments. Work on the last ex­hibit of the semester counts as a final for the class, and students manage the entire show from start to finish.

The students also choose 
the series of shows for the 
following semester. They 
discuss ideas submitted by 
faculty members as well as 
their own proposals before 
voting. 
Members of the class 
agree that the opportunity to 
work with professionals and 
their art is a great experi­
ence whether one is inter­
ested in gallery management 
or design. "If you're consid­
ering showing art in the fu­
ture, this lets you see the 
reverse side," Taschler said, 
referring to the fact that stu­
dents are involved in every­
thing from hanging and 
lighting to organizing. 
The class also agrees that 
the Isis Gallery has an im­
portant function in both uni­
versity and local communit­
ies. 
Local residents as well as 
students attend opening 
nights and exhibitions. Fac­
ulty member Douglass Kin­
sey, an associate professor 
in the university's art depart­
ment, adds, "It's nice to get 
people involved who aren't 
taking art courses." 
Since the gallery is such a positive presence at the uni­versity, Gray and the stu­dents hope to re-establish a relationship with the Student Union Board. Presently, the Isis Gallery receives all of its funding from the art depart­ment. 
Although student work is still shown (thesis work will be exhibited at the end of the semester), the Isis Gallery tends to focus on new, emerging art from well known beginning artists. Shows cover a broad range of media including drawing, painting, photography, sculpture, ceramics, fibers, industrial design, and envi­ronments. 
As an alternate space for contemporary artists, the Isis distinguishes itself from the Snite Museum which usually displays established or historical art. The Isis Gallery also enjoys more nexibility in scheduling. Ac­cording to Kinsey, "The

Penny stocks offer the risks and rewards of stock speculation 
By JOHN WHOLIHAN 
Business Writer 
Editor's Note: This is part of a continuing series on invest­ment opportunities available to Notre Dame students. 
"Hey Buddy! Wanna make a quick buck?" 
This is the common percep tion of "penny stocks." They are usually viewed as worth­less stock, issued by a fly by night operation. 
The series today will discuss penny stocks by presenting the risks and rewards of this type of investment. 
The term, penny stock, en­compasses stocks that are sell­ing on the Over the Counter (OTC) market for less than five dollars. 
Some of these companies have grown enough financially to be listed by the National As­sociation of Securities Dealers (NASDAQ). These stocks are listed everyday in the paper, and your regular broker can handle their purchase and sale. 
The majority of penny stocks are not listed, and are traded by what are called market makers. A stock's market making institution is found by looking up the stock on the "pink sheets." Pink sheets are a listing of the non-NASDAQ stocks, and al­though these stocks are OTC, they are known among brokers as "under the counter." 
Penny stocks are also traded on smaller exhanges such as the Vancouver Exchange. An investor wishing to invest in a stock listed on one of these smaller exchanges may have to deal with a broker that spe­cializes in smaller stocks. 
There are numerous penny stocks available to the inves­tor. Many small corporations raise capital by issuing mil­lions of shares of penny stocks. 
Most people invest in a penny stock with the hope that the company will grow and as a result the stock will appreciate in value. 
However, investing in most companies is very risky. This is because the companies have not established earnings, may have inexperienced manage­ment who cannot handle rapid expansion, or lack the neces­sary public recognition. These kinds of penny stocks will be issued, increase in price be­cause of hype, and eventually fall to a few cents a share. 
Wall St. 
at 
ND Ave. 

What should an invenstor look for in a good penny stock? 
There are a few characteris­tics that make certain small companies more favorable in­vestments. The first is an established pattern of earn­ings. This does not guarantee future earnings, but it demonstrates potential. An­other characteristic to look for is whether or not the company has signed any contracts to per­form their service or sell their products. A signed contract translates into future reve­nues. A company that finds a niche in an industry, or one that develops a new technology can also be favorable for invest­ment. 
There are many publications that cover penny stocks. The Penny Stock Journal is to penny stocks what the Wall Street Journal is to New York stocks. Many penny stock newsletters provide the essential informa­tion for finding a broker, routinely follow stocks, and dis­cuss new stock issues.

Trade numbers boost 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Stock prices rose Friday in what analysts described as a muted response to news of a smaller U.S. trade deficit. 
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 21.72 to 1983.26 by closing on Wall Street. 
Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 9 to 5 in the over­all tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 937 up, 556 down and 473 un­changed. 
Before the market opened the Commerce Department re­ported that the nation's trade deficit narrowed to $12.20 bil­lion in December from $13.22 billion the month before. 
The figure came in at the low end of analysts' estimates, and lent support to the growing belief that the international trade situation was improving. American exports set a record for the second straight month. 
But analysts said traders in the stock and bond markets didn't see the news as purely positive. 
Given the strength it showed in U.S. manufacturing, they said, the chances seemed less that the Federal Reserve might soon relax its credit policy fur­ther. Interest rates rose and prices declined in the credit markets. 
The good trade news was also muted because the annual trade deficit reached an all time low of $145 billion. 
Commerce Secretary William Verity said: "Such a level is unacceptable. We have a long way to go until we can be comfortable." 
Another apparent drag on the markets was the Labor Depar­tment's report that the producer price index of finished goods rose 0.4 percent in January, after falling about the same amount in December. 
This increase is due to a jump in food prices which offset declines in energy prices. Food prices went up 1.7 percent primarily due to insect infesta­tion in California and Arizona. Lettuce skyrocketed 51.6 per­cent while celery went up 44.1 percent. 
penny stockbroker are the 
same as the ones used in choos­
ing a regular broker as dis­
cussed earlier in the series. 
As a client, one must under­
stand that penny stocks areal­
ways speculative. These in­
vestments in most cases are 
short-term. The broker will 
usually encourage a client to 
purchase several hundred or 
thousand shares of stock. Many 
investors like the fact that for 
a few hundred dollars, they can 
own thousands of shares of a 
potentially valuable stock. 
There are a few recommen­
ded guidelines that may differ 
from those used in trading reg­
ular stocks that successful 
penny stock investors should 
follow. 
If the price of a penny stock doubles, sell half to cover the cost of investment. Before in­vesting, set an upper limit. That is, determine a price at which you will sell everything if the stock price rises. Also, before investing, set a lower limit. A fifty percent loss limit is one way to cut losses without losing everything. Take all the hype with a grain of salt. Al­ways read the prospectus of a company's new issue before in­vesting. 
As stated before, penny stocks are issued by companies in any industry. An example of a non-NASDAQ issue is AT&I, Inc. It recently sold for 45 cents a share, and deals in micro­wave television transmission. An up and coming NASDAQ issue is Video Jukebox Net­work, Inc. Video Jukebox was recently selling for two dollars a share. The company is an in­teractive television video net­work. 
If you have a little extra cash, and like to speculate, penny stocks may be for you. With some research and a little luck you may soon be the proud ow!ler of a dollar stock.

u ABC's -How do state's help pay for public education? More and more states are using funds raised through a state lottery. Most guarantee single Lotto jackpots of $1,000,000. However, certain smaller states are joining forces and funds to offer larger payoffs. The first to do this were Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, who formed Tristate Megabucks. Making it's debut last week was Lotto America. Six states and the District of Columbia are offering a weekly grand prize that starts at $2 million. Some of the larger states are also following this trend. Ohio, Michigan, New York, and Illinois are considering offering their own super lottery. 
u Lingo-Like any industry, Wall Street has it's own slang language. Words and phrases which allow brokers, traders, and anyone else on Wall Street to communicate better and add some humor to thier jobs. Most companies have nick­names based on their stockmarket symbol. McDannel Douglas is known as Mad Dog because it's symbol is MD. Piedmont's symbol of PIE has earned the airline the nick­name of Pie in the Sky while Minnesota Mining and Manu­facturing (better known as 3M) is called Triple Mary. Other times a company's nickname is based upon a characteristic of that compnay. "We the People" was given to Merrill Lynch because they are the largest brokerage firm. 
Wall Street slang is hardly confined to company names. It also encompasses many other aspects of the investment world. The recent increase of takeovers and mergers has spawned an entire new set of words and phrases. A nuclear war occurs when two companies compete to buy the same corporation. If a company wishes to avoid being the target of a nuclear war it could put a shark repellant clause in the company charter. This clause would make the company less susceptible to a hostile take over. If that doesn't work the company can hope to be saved by a white knight: a person who saves the company from a hostile takeover through buying the company himself. 
u The High Life -Those who will work in Leo Burnett's Chicago office next year (which seems to include the entire College of Arts and Letters) can look forward to working in a brand new 50-story headquarters building. Burnett, who handles advertising for many of America's largest compan­ies such as McDonalds and Pillsbury, will probably begin moving in during 1989 and will take up 25 floors of the building.

don't need the three-point shot right now, and we don't need you to commit the dumb foul after the three-point shot.' He was trying to make it up with the steal. I just wanted him to settle down. 
"I thought the way he han­dled the rest of the game was vintage David Rivers." 
Rivers scored 12 of his points in the second half, when he took control. With the Irish down 43­42 with 14: 12left to play, Rivers took an inbounds pass the length of the court for a driving score. He was fouled by Craig Jackson, converted the free throw and put the Irish ahead to stay. 
From there on, it was almost a parade to the stripe, with Voce doing a lot of the march­ing. 
"I knew if I made it to the basket, I'd get the shot off or the foul," Voce said of the in­side strategy. "We knew they were going for the blocked shot, so I pumped faked and went up 
strong."

U. S. prepares to meet Czechs 
Associated Press 

CALGARY, Alberta -This 
U.S. hockey team is already one game up on the last one, but the coach who lost to the Americans Saturday night and beat them four years ago says the 1984 team was better never­theless. 
"The 1984 team was a stronger team," Austria coach Ludek Bukac said in the after­math of the 10-6 loss in Satur­day's opening game. "The players were generally better skilled. It was a faster team, and it played with great emo­tion." 
Bukac coached the Czechos­lovakian team, which beat the United States 4-1 in 1984 at Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. 
That loss was the second straight to start for the Americans en route to a disap­pointing seventh-place finish, not even in the medal round. 
But that failure had nothing to do with lack of ability, Bukac said. 
"The reason they didn't do better was that they had a lot of pressure to win" because of the "Miracle on Ice" gold medal at Lake Placid in 1980, he said. "They weren't able to play under the pressure." 
The pressure will return quickly for the current U.S. team, however, as it faces Czechoslovakia Monday night. The third-seeded Czechos­lovaks were upset in their opening game by West Ger­many 2-1. 
"I don't think the Czechs had a good day," U.S. coach Dave Peterson said. "They've been stung. My guess is that they'll react and come back strong against us." 
"There was no trouble get­ting up for the game," starting goaltender Mike Richter said of the Austrian game.

WinS Daytona 500 
Associated Press 
DAYTONA BEACH -Bobby Allison raced to his third Daytona 500 victory Sunday, outdueling his son Davey to win the 30th edition of stock car racing's premier event. 
The race was marred by a spectacular crash from which seven-time Daytona 500 winner Richard Petty miraculously es­caped serious injury. 
Petty, 50, skidded sideways coming off turn four and was hit and launched into the wall by Phil Barkdoll on the 106th lap. Petty's car pirouetted into the air' then barrel-rolled seven times, coming to rest on its wheels. 
It was then sent spinning again after being hit Brett Bodine's car. Eddie Bierschwale, A.J. Foyt, Rusty Wallace and Alan Kulwicki also were involved in the acci­dent. 
There were no other injuries, and Bierschwale, Wallace and Kulwicki were able to continue racing after repairs. 
Petty was kept overnight at Halifax Medical Center for ob­servation. 
The elder Allison, already the oldest man to win a stock car event, became the first 50­year-old to win a 500-mile race. He won the Firecracker 400 here last July at the age of 49. 
He showed his strength throughout the $1.5-million race at Daytona International Speedway, starting from the second row and running at or near the front all the way. 
There were 17 drivers on the lead lap at the end, the most in the history of the race, as well as 26 lead changes among 12 drivers. 
But the race, the first run with NASCAR's new car­buretor restrictor plates, in­tended to slow the cars in the interest of safety, was the third slowest Daytona 500 ever. 
Seven caution flags for 42 laps--nearly a quarter of the race--held the average speed to 137.531 mph. The slowest pre­vious race was in 1960 when Junior Johnson won at 124.740. 
One of the caution periods was caused by Petty's crash. 
That caution period lasted 21 laps as a track crew replaced two fence posts damaged in the crash at the front of the main grandstand. They also had to retighten the safety cables used to strengthen the fence. 
Bobby Allison, who previ­ously won this event in 1978 and 1982, picked up his 84th career victory, moving him out of a tie for third place on the all-time list with Cale Yarborough. 
The winner, driving a Buick Regal, charged to the lead for the final time just 18laps from the end of the 200-lap event, roaring past Phil Parsons as the green flag came out after a caution period. 
He stayed on top the rest of the way, holding off the Ford of 26-year-old Davey, the 1987 Rookie of the Year by about 21/2 car-lengths. 
It is the first time the father and son from Hueytown, Ala., have finish one-two.

over Fordham on Wednesday. 
"I wasn't really tired or anything," said Rivers, "but I got off to a slow start. I'm sup­posed to be a leader and of course I want to be out there, but he's the coach. Still, I'd take my ankle at 80 percent over somebody else's at 100 percent." 
But any coach will tell you it doesn't matter who starts the game, it matters who's in there at the final buzzer. Voce and Rivers were there, guarantee­ing that this would not slip away. When the Bruins resorted to desperation fouls in the final minutes, it was Voce and Rivers who parted the nets from the free throw lines, con­necting on 9-of-10 and 5-of-6 at­tempts, respectively. 
"We wanted to go to Voce down the stretch," said Phelps. 
enough that they (UCLA) would foul him and put him at the line." 
Voce, whose 21 points were a career-high, found the Bruins ready and willing to hack him inside. 
"They were playing a really tight man-to-man defense," said Voce, "and there was not a lot of weak-side help. So once I made a move to the ball and took it to the basket, I could either get the shot or the foul." 
UCLA head coach Walt Haz­zard said he knew his team would have to contain Voce and Rivers going into the game if they wanted to pull out a win on Notre Dame's home court. 
"We have a lot of respect for Voce," said Hazzard. "He really can get you on the boards, and with his big body he can bang people around in there. 
"Rivers is a four-year starter and an all-American can-dictate. He is supposed to do the things he does. When he takes the ball coast-to-coast like that, you expect him to make those." 
That coast-to-coast, bob-and­weave trip down the floor which Hazzard is referring to erased the Bruins' last lead in the game. With the Irish down 43-42 at the 12:42 mark of the second half, Rivers took the in­bounds pass the length of the court, drove the lane and threw up a shot-put style layup with his right hand while UCLA's Craig Jackson committed the foul. The shot fell, as did the ensuing free throw for a three-point play. 
"The way he handled the rest of the game (after being pulled in the opening minutes)," said Phelps, "that was vintage David Rivers." 
Together, Rivers and Voce put on the kind of performance expected of senior captains in a big game with a longtime­rival. Senior leadership. You can't define it, exactly, but you know it when you see it.

ND perfect 1n dual finale 
The Observer I Bob Jones 
By GREG GUFFEY 
Sports Writer 

It was the perfect way to end the dual-meet season for the Irish swim teams. 
The men's and women's squads routed their weekend opponents in a final tune-up for the upcoming championship season. The men downed Illinois-Chicago 112-87 Friday and topped Cleveland State 121­83 Saturday. The women, meanwhile, defeated the Flames 118-88 and turned back the Vikings 135-118. 
The convincing victories gave the women a big lift going into the Midwestern Collegiate Conference Championships. The women finished the season at 9-7 and hope to put a season of close losses behind them in championship action. 
"This was a strong, spirited finish for the women,'' Irish mentor Tim Welsh said, "and it solidifies a winning record. This is the fastest, most com­plete team I have coached at Notre Dame. They are better than the 9-7 record and I'm glad they came out of the season with a taste for winning." 
In their last dual meets, the

Temple led 51-27 at halftime as the Owls took their 20th vic­tory against on loss. The tri­umph boosted Temple to 13-0 in the conference. GW slipped to 11-12 and 4-9. 
Coach John Chaney's Owls reached the 20th-victory mark for the fifth consecutive year. The record is the best for a Temple team through 21 games since the 1955-56 team went 20-1 on the way to the NCAA's Final Four. 
The victory also was the Owls' 80th in the last 82 games on their home court and the 100th against nine losses since the field house opened in 1979.

LEAD TilE ADVENTURE 
seniors rose to the occasion and paced the victories for the wo­men. All of the competing seniors recorded career-best times during the weekend meets. Welsh says this perfor­mance proves the Irish are ready for the next step. 
"The seniors all had a great meet Saturday," Welsh said. "These are all good signs that there is energy left to prepare for the championship season. All the optimism says 'bring on the big meets.' " 
Sophomore Kathy Quirk and freshman Christy Moston won three events for the Irish against Illinois-Chicago. Quirk won the 50 and 500 freestyle and was part of the winning 400 medley relay team, while Mas­ton won the 200 individual med­ley and was on the 400 medley and the 200 free relay winners. 
Against Cleveland State, Amy Darlington won the 100 and 200 butterfly, and Andrea Bonny captured the one-and three-meter diving events. Be­cky Wood took the 100 breaststroke, Moston the 100 backstroke, and Quirk the 100 free. All three were part of the winning 200 medley relay team. 
The men finished the dual­meet season with a 13-3 ledger, winning 10 of their last 11 meets. The Irish won the Mid­western crown in 1986 and hope to recpature the title after rejoining the conference this season. 
"The men's objective was to win more dual meets than any other season and they accom­plished that," Welsh said. "We've achieved some real flexibility in the lineup and that has assisted in our preparation for the championship season." 
Jim Byrne led the Irish at­
tack against the Flames with 
first places in the 200 back­
stroke and the 200 individual 
medley. Dave Thoman won the 
50 free Saturday, while Bill 
Jackoboice took the 100 butter­
fly. Both were part of the win­
ning 200 medley relay team. 
"Cleveland State played a very important role in the de­velopment of the swimming program here," Welsh said. "This meet was the first away for the seniors, it was the first meet in Rolf's Aquatic Center and it is the last for the seniors now. It's been great to watch the progress."

Jansen loses shot at 500-meter gold 
Associated Press 

CALGARY, Alberta -The day began in tragedy and ended in disaster for Dan Jan­sen, a U.S. speed skater who carried the Winter Olympic hopes of America and the in­spiration of his dying sister. 
Jansen's sister, Jane, died of leukemia Sunday morninp, and several hours later, the world sprint champion fell in the 500­meter race. 
"Maybe it just wasn't meant to be," he said. "My family doesn't want me to go home now and I know Jane wouldn't want that." 
After one false start, Jansen
.. 
slid out of the inside lane and crashed into Yasushi Kuroiwa. Jansen got up and slapped his 

knees. He jerked his hood off amd hid his head in his hands. Frustration and sorrow were etched on his face. 
Kuroiwa was given another chance in the 500 meters. Jan­sen, who was not allowed a res­kate, will have to wait until Thursday's 1,000 meters to go for the gold medal. 
Jansen said the fall came so fast. "I can't remember much. My first 100 wasn't normal for me. It felt like it slipped out from under me, and the next thing I knew I was in the mats." 
Earlier in the day, a barroom brawler from Finland, Matti Nykanen, easily won the 70­meter event. He can become the first jumper in the Olym­pics to win two gold medals if he defends his Olympic title on the 90-meter hill Wednesday. 
At the same time, the Olym­pic comeback of Finland's 1984 triple gold medalist, Marja­Liisa Kirvesniemi, was spoiled by a young student from the So­viet Union. 
And hurricane-force winds 
that made it difficult to stand, 
let alone race on skis, forced 
postponement of the men's 
downhill. The race was res­
cheduled for Monday, when 98 
mph winds were expected to 
abate. 

The speed skating gold went 
to Jens-Uew Mey of East Ger­

packed it in and when we couldn't score from the outside, they were great on defense." 
Notre Dame shot 10 of 27 (37 percent) in the first half and finished the game 23 of 55 (42 percent). Going into the game, the Irish led the nation in field goal percentage at over 53 per­cent. 
"We just shot so poorly," McGraw said. "We were awful in the first half. That won't hap­pen again. We weren't taking bad shots, we were just missing them. We looked real tired through the whole game and I don't know why."

the bronze. Thometz finished eighth. 
"It's been a real tough time for the people on the team," 
U.S. Coach Mike Crowe said. "We pulled together a little tonight for Dan. It was difficult for people to get up and skate the way they would have liked." 
The 24-year-old Nykanen soared 89.5 meters on both his jumps to easily win the 70­meter. If he wins the 90-meter, he would become the first man to win both jumping gold medals since the event was split in 1964. 
Finnish Coach Matti Pulli thinks Nykanen has a good chance for the other medal be­cause of the temper that has gotten Nykanen into barroom fights and suspended from the team, and earned him the nick­name Matti Nukes. 
"Yes, he's still strong­headed at times," Pulli said. "But you need to be like that to win gold medals. In Finland we have many nice athletes, polite people, but they don't win gold medals." 
Pavel Ploc of Czechoslovakia won the 70-meter silver, and countryman Jiri Malec took the bronze. 
Vida Ventsene, a 23-year-old Soviet, won the first gold medal of the Games when she finished the women's 10-kilometer cross-country ski race in 30 minutes, 8.3 seconds. Kirves­niemi, who won all three indi­vidual events and had a bronze medal in the relay at the 1984 Sarajevo Games, was ninth. 
At age 32, Kirvesniemi came back this summer from two years' retirement and the birth of her daughter, and she still has three more chances for a medal--in the 5-and 20­kilometer races and the 20­kilometer relay. 
Raisa Smetanina, 36-year­old Soviet veteran, won the sil­ver, and Marjo Matinainen of Finland took the bronze. 
Jansen learned early Sunday morning that his sister had died of leukemia back home in Wis­consin. 
Jansen, the youngest of nine children, won the World Sprint Speed Skating championships last weekend at West Allis, Wis. 
His sister, Jane Beres, was 
too sick to accompany him to 
Calgary, so he had hoped she 
could watch him win gold on 
television.

The Notre Dame wrestling team had a lackluster performance as It fell tc1 the 16th-ranked Ohio 
ND doo1med by 'flat' showing, fall 23-13 to 16th-ranked OSU 
By JOHN GREEN 
Sports Writer 

Flat. That's how Irish wrestling coach Fran McCann described his team's perfor­mance after he watched his squad's record fall to 5-4 with a 23-13 loss to the 16th-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes Friday night at the JACC. 
"We just came out flat tonight, and I'm not sure why," said McCann. "This was a big meet for us. We were facing a top-20 team in Ohio State, and I felt that we matched up very well against them. But the kids did not seem to be up for this one. They just did not wrestle aggressively enough to win." 
A perfect example of the Irish being too conservative oc­curred in the first match of the evening, when Notre Dame's 118-pound sophomore Andy Radenbaugh was held to a 2-2 tie by Buckeye David Range. 
"That match set the tone for the whole meet," said McCann. "Last week against Miehigan, Andy defeated one of the top wrestlers in the Big Ten. Now tonight, against an average Big Ten wrestler, he's too hesitant and has to settle for a draw." 
However, the Irish did come out on top in the most an­ticipated match of the evening. 
Notre Dame's Chris Geneser, ranked No. 12 in the country, was pitted against the Buck­eyes' Ron Gharbo, who entered the match rated No. 10. Watch for those rankings to switch now. Geneser dominated the match from the outset and looked very impressive as he coasted to a 10-6 win over Gharbo. 
"That was an important match up for Chris," McCann commented. "With nationals coming up, he knows that he has got to go out and win each match decisively. And that's exactly what he did tonight. It was just a tremendous perfor­mance on Chris's part." 
Other victors on the evening for Notre Dame were 134-pound junior Jerry Durso and 142­pound senior Ron Wisniewski. Freshman Todd Tomazic also managed to come away with a draw at 167 pounds. 
Despite the loss of the meet, Coach McCann is still very op­timistic about his Irish squad. "We're a young team," he ex­plained. "Ohio State starts five seniors, Michigan had six, but we start only two. And with youth like that comes inconsis­tency. 
"But now we're through the toughest part of our schedule, and the kids have done well. A big thing is that we have hung in there against schools ranked in the top-20. We stayed com­petitive. 
"And we had our chances to win. If we get another point tonight in each of those two ties (at 118 and 167), and pull out another win somewhere, then we win this meet. It was that close." 
The Irish will try to get back on the winning track when they play host to the Olivet Comets tomorrow night in the last home meet befor the NCAA Western Regionals. The match will begin at 7 p.m. in the aux­iliary gymnasium of the JACC.
