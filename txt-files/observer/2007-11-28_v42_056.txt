COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 

Members examine ticket exchange 
Student government, Ticket Office in talks to modify recently-discontinued program 
By JOSEPH McMAHON News Writer 
The Council of Representatives discussed alternative ways to con­duct football ticket nxchanges at their meeting Tuesday. 
The Ticket Office discon­tinued the basic program this year of allowing a des­ignated number of students to exchange for a fee their student ticket for a general 
admission ticket. It cited abuses of the system, including scalping of tick­ets, as a reason to end the program. This year, stu­dents were able to enter a lottery for the ability to exchange their USC tickets because that game occurred over fall break. 
But student government approached the Ticket Office and began talks to bring back the option of exchanging student passes for general admission tick­ets, student body vice president Maris Braun said Tuesday. 

"It's pretty unique having. a ticket office that is very dedicated to giving the stu­dent body as many chances to see the team as they possibly can," Braun said. 
She said the Ticket Office was cooperative when the Student Union Board organized a ticket exchange for the Oct. 20 game against USC -an exception that was allowed 
because, the Ticket Office reasoned, many students would be leaving Notre Dame for fall break. 
"The Ticket Office was really pleased with the stu­dent-run exchange," Braun said. "In the future we should look to other stu­dent organizations like student government and some of the class councils to organize it."

Fonner Iraq advisor evaluates U.S. policy 
Stanford scholar says sudden withdrawal would be as 'arrogant' as 2003 invasion 
By DAVIS RHORER Jr. 
News Writer 
There is no more politically charged, national security question than the direction of Iraq, said Larry Diamond, a political science professor at Stanford University. 
Diamond, a former senior advisor on governance for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad, began his lecture Tuesday night in the Hesburgh Center with his reflections on the foundations of the war. He then discussed the current sit­uation for both Iraqi civilians and American soldiers. 
In 2004, Diamond was invit­ed by then-U.S. National Security Advisor and former colleague Condoleezza Rice to assist in the transition to democracy in Iraq. Initially scheduled to stay in the coun­try for six months, a discour­aged Diamond left after only three. 
"We were failing in Iraq from the ineptitude, arrogance, incompetence and isolation from reality and knowledge of Iraqi society," he said. 
Diamond's criticisms, which focused heavily on the unilat­eral nature with which he felt the Bush administration han­dled the engagement, eventu­ally shifted towards current obligations the United States has in the war-torn state. 
"We can't just indiscrimi­nately walk away," Diamond said. "It would be a mistake to get out of Iraq with as little thought, as little planning and as much arrogant indifference as the manner in which we went in." 
But not everything Diamond

Hallsjustify different annual fees 
lZectors: IJorms'needs call for tailored deposits 
By KATIE PERALTA AND JOHN TIERNEY 
News Writers 
A Notre Dame education costs 
more than $45,000 per year, 
but the hall tax fee included in 
that bill varies significantly 
from dorm to dorm. 
For example, freshman resi­
dents of Badin hall paid $100 
before moving in this year, 
while the men of Sorin paid 
$40. 
The taxes vary from dorm to 
dorm because each residence 
hall has the freedom to choose 
the housing deposit that will 
meet the dorm's needs for the 
year. Residence halls with high­
er taxes generally are able to 
provide more activities and 
supplies for free during the 
year. 
In the case of Badin, a small 
dorm population -just 123 
women -caused the dorm to 
ask more from each resident. 
"The smaller the number of 
residents, the [greater] need 
for a higher tax," said Badin 
rector Denise Lyon. Badin 
upperclassmen pay a $75 fee to 
help cover the hall's activities 
and expenses throughout the 
year, which include dorm din­
ners, other events, decorations 
and items for common use. 
Badin recently purchased a set 
of weights using hall tax funds, 
Lyon said. 
As in most dorms, freshmen 
pay a higher hall tax to cover 
freshman orientation activities.

Accounts Web site uses a $50

Senior takes first in Mazda challenge, showcases design 
By THERESA CIVANTOS 
News Writer 
While most Notre Dame stu­dents watched football and ate turkey last weekend, sen­ior Mallory McMorrow took the spotlight at the L.A. Auto Show as the winner of Mazda's nationwide car­designing competition. 
An industrial design stu­dent, McMorrow submitted a sketch and a 150-word state­ment to the Mazda Design Challenge without thinking her vision of a 2018 compact sports car would win the top prize. But it did -and her vision evolved from a paper sketch to a full-scale clay 
model at the L.A. Auto Show, which ran from Nov. 16-25. "I had no idea I would win," McMorrow said. 
The competition, aimed at college students, asked par­ticipants to imagine the Mazda3 of 2018 and accepted proposals from Sept. 25 to Oct. 12. McMorrow said they received 400 entries. The Mazda Design Team of North America "voted and hand­picked the top 10 ideas," according to the competition's official Facebook group. These finalists were announced Oct. 16 and the online voters narrowed them down to five by the end of the month. 
McMorrow and the other four designers then worked with the Mazda Design Team to produce a final sketch of the 2018 Mazda3 for the final round of voting. McMorrow's win was announced Nov. 6. 

"The voting was all on Facebook," she said. 
As part of her prize, Mazda flew McMorrow to California to attend the L.A. Auto Show, where she worked with Franz von Holzhausen -director of design for Mazda North American Operations -and his team to turn her design into a full-scale clay model. The model was unveiled Nov. 24.

suggested making further 
revisions to the process in which the exchanges could be con­ducted if the program were reinstated. 
The USC exchange this year had stu­dents entering a lottery for a chance to exchange their tickets. But the selected entries were not noti­fied they had won until a week before the game. 
Such short notice doesn't give students' 
friends or relatives enough time to plan a trip to Notre Dame, several COR mem­bers said. 
"I wanted to exchange a ticket for a friend, but I didn't find out until a week before that I had won the lottery, so it ended up not working out," said Kadeja Gaines, treasurer of the 
Student Union Board and a Georgia native. 
Because it is so difficult to find a reasonable plane ticket a few days before the expected departure date, 
"It's pretty unique having a ticket office that is very dedicated to giving the student body as many chances to see the team as [it] possibly can."

them  out

vice president Chris Doughty said. 
To counter fears that stu­dents would use this extra time to sell the tickets for a profit, Doughty suggested that the name of the person the student is buying the ticket for be printed on it.

dents have to eover dance 
fees themselves. 

That is also the ease for the residents of Sorin College. While Sorin residents enjoy the lowest hall tax of any dorm on campus --$40 every year --they must pay to attend the dorm's dances. The Sorin danee earlier this semester eame with a $15 price tag per couple, Sorin rector Father Jim King said. 
llowever, the dorm does pay for food for game watches, study days and a cookout on football Fridays, King said. The dorm has been ablf1 to save its residents $20 thanks to financial assistance from former residents at its annual alumni reunion, King said. 
Lyons Hall also charges its freshmen more than its other residents --$60 for first-year students versus $50 for soph­mnores, juniors and seniors-­to help pay for the events dur­ing orientation. 
"The extra $10 for the freshmen goes to eover the expnnses of Frosh-0, which are considerable," Lyons rec­tor Denise McOsker said. "And lthe Lyons] llall Council is thinking about raising the freshman rate to $70 next year." 
Lyons's tax funds cover such expenses as the dorm's print­ing and mailing costs, inter­hall sports fees and exercise equipment. 
"While we also charge a nominal fee for dance tickets and hall apparel," McOsker said, "it would be consider­ably more if we didn't have hall taxes to subsidize the cost of food, music, ballroom space, etc. for the dances and the cost and printing of the T­shirts, sweats, etc." 
Most dorms divide housing deposit funds among different committees. 
At Pasquerilla East, the res­idents' $50 fees are spread across the different eommit­tees that take care of dances, hall council proceedings, mul­ticultural gatherings and Big Sister/Little Sister events, among other aetivities. 
"Each commission gets a budget to host different events in the lPasquerilla Eastl com­munity," Pasquerilla East rec­tor Breyan Tornifolio said. 
Breen-Phillips tapped into its hall tax fund to purchase a nnw treadmill last year, said Breen-Phillips rector Hachel Kellogg. 
And with the upcoming holi­day season, she and other rectors (from both male and female dorms) said hall tax funds will be used to buy gifts for housekeeping personnel and snacks for students dur­ing exam week.

car company ever designed a car live at an auto show," she said. "We built a full-scale model out of clay in front of everyone. One kid asked if the car was made of chocolate." 
The clay model lacked an interior, showing that "they were looking at shape, propor­tion, exterior features --not really at an inside at all," MeMorrow said. 
Winning the competition is a big step toward her eareer goals, she said. 
"It's a big deal... I think it will help a lot," McMorrow said. 
That career may begin with the internship Mazda offered her following her performance at the L.A. Auto Show. 
"They're holding up a spot for me," she said. 
But she shared her victory with the entire design depart­ment, saying that though Notre Dame is not famous for its achievements in industrial design, she is convinced her liberal arts education prepared her for the challenge. 
"I think the liberal arts at Notre Dame helped me come out first," she said. "Mazda really wanted to get strong ideas rather than just flashy drawing. They wanted sub­
stance, not just a kid who can 
draw." 
She said she doesn't think her original sketch of the design is what garnered her the top spot. 
"Just based on the 2-D design, I don't think I would have made it," McMorrow said. 
What made her an outstand­ing participant, she said, must have been the strength of her essay. 
And maybe her gender, she said. 
"IThe fact I'm a womanl impacted the way a lot of pPo­ple looked at me ... I hadn't really realized it, but there's still a stigma." 
Her trip to Calil"ornia shownd McMorrow there is a big mar­ket for f11male car designers. 
"It felt rPally eool having these little girls come up to me saying, 'I love drawing cars!' and having a girl say I was her inspiration," McMorrow said. 
She said the competition was internationally publicized in places likn India and China, getting her the kind of expo­sure she could not have found at Notre Dame. 
"This was a random, open competition, nothing to do with Notre Dame ... one thing I learned from this is, take advantage of outside opportu­nities," McMorrow said.

Stadium to be razed after collapse 
RIO DE JANEIHO, Brazil-The soccer sta­dium where seven people died after the stands collapsed will be destroyed and a new one will be built in its place. 
At least 40 others were injured Sunday night in Salvador, a coastal city of Bahia state. The accident was the worst in Brazilian soccer history and raised questions about the country's readiness to host the 2014 World Cup. 
Gov. Jacques Wagner said Tuesday the Fonte Nova stadium will be imploded. He did not give a timetable for the demolition, but the new stadium is expected to be completed by 2014. 
Musharraf to end military career 
ISlAMABAD, Pakistan -Pervez Musharraf will retire as chief of Pakistan's army at mid­week, his aides announced Monday as the embattled leader grappled with a political scene roiled by the return of an exiled former prime minister in time for crucial January elec­tions. 
Nawaz Sharif, who was ousted by the 1999 coup that put Musharraf in power, quickly reg­istered Monday to run in the election although he didn't drop his call for a boycott that could undermine the ballot's legitimacy. 
Sharif appealed for support from Pakistanis unhappy with Musharraf's U.S. alliance, por­traying himself as a politician who kept himself at arms length from Washington in contrast to the U.S.-friendly stance of the president and the other key opposition leader, Benazir Bhutto.

In a 20-minute statement to the court, Abdi's attorney Mahir Sherif said his client apologized to the people of the United States, the people of Ohio and the Muslim community. He said Abdi regretted that his conviction might lead to problems for other Muslims. 
Hurricane predictions were wrong 
MIAMI -Despite alarming predictions, the U.S. came through a second straight hurricane season virtually unscathed, rais­ing fears among emergency planners that they will be fighting public apathy and over­confidence when they warn people to pre­pare for next year. 
Friday marks the official close of the Atlantic season, so unless a storm forms in the next few days, only one hurricane -and a minor one at that-will have hit the U.S. during the June-to-November period. Mexico and Central America, however, were struck by a record two top-scale Category 5 storms. 
The preliminary total for the season: 14 named storms, five of them hurricanes, two of them major.

Man charged with stealing aircraft 
LAPORTE, Ind. -A LaPorte man has been arrested for commandeering a twin-engine plane and driving it off the taxiway into a bean field. 
Police arrested 38-year-old Michael Santos, charging him with theft and criminal mischief. It was unclear whether Santos had a pilot's license. 
Officers were called to LaPorte Municipal Airport in northern Indiana on Sept. 9 after the plane was found in the field, covered with soy­beans chopped up by the propeller. The pilot apparently was unable to negotiate a curve lead­ing to the runway. 
An airport official says fog concealed the thief's identity from the surveillance cameras. Santos remains in custody in the LaPorte County Jail.

Youth riots cripple Parisian suburb 
Third night of restlessness includes violent clashes as rioters begin using firearms 
Associated Press 

VILLIERS-LE-BEL Youths rampaged for a third night in the tough suburbs north of Paris and violence spread to a southern city late Tuesday as police struggled to contain rioters who have burned cars and buildings and -in an ominous turn ­shot at officers. 
A senior police union offi­cial warned that "urban guerrillas" had joined the unrest, saying the vio­lence was worse than during three weeks of rioting that raged around French cities in 2005, when firearms were rarely used. 
Bands of young people set more cars and garbage bins on fire in Villiers-le-Bel, the Paris suburb where the latest trouble first erupted, and a grocery store was torched in a nearby town, the regional government said. In the south, 10 cars and a library went up in flames in Toulouse, police said.

R.J. Reynolds pulls tobacco ads 
NEW YORK-The R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., which has been under intense pressure from anti-smoking groups and members of Congress over print ads for its cigarettes, said Tuesday it would not advertise its brands in newspapers or consumer magazines next year. 
The company had been criticized sharply for both its colorful and feminine Camel No. 9 ads, which appeared in fashion magazines and were seen as cynically aimed at young women, and also for a recent ad in Rolling Stone. 
In that ad, four pages of Camel cigarette ads bookended Rolling Stone's own material on independent rock music, which was presented in a cartoon-like format. That angered anti­smoking advocates, who said it appeared the whole thing was a Camel ad -and that it recalled the old "Joe Camel" cartoons that were banned because they appeared aimed at children. 
ILJ. Reynolds spokeswoman Jan Smith said the decision, first reported Tuesday in the Winston-Salem Journal, had been made some­time before October and was unrelated to the Rolling Stone controversy. 
Broadway negotiations at stalemate 
NEW YORK -No, negotiations between striking Broadway stagehands and theater pro­ducers have not run as long as "Cats." It only seems that way. 
Two days of back-to-hack marathon sessions have not produced a settlement between Local 1 and the League of American Theatres and . Producers, but both sides will return to the bargaining table Wednesday to try again. 
Progress reportedly has been slow in solving the thorny dispute that has shut down most of Broadway since Nov. 10, although some head­way apparently has been made in lengthy dis­cussions held Sunday, Monday and into Tuesday. 
"Talks ended this morning (Tuesday) at 7:30 
a.m. without a deal after 13 hours of hard bar­gaining in what I can only describe as a 'rain delay' in the ninth inning of the seventh game of the World Series," Bruce Cohen, a union spokesman said. "The rainy weather should clear up when talks resume Wednesday." 
Abu Dhabi Investment saves Citi 
$7.5 billion offering makes Arab state one of the largest Citigroup investors 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority will invest $7.5 billion in Citigroup, offering the nation's largest bank needed capital to offset big losses from mortgages and other investments. 
The cash from the sover­eign investment fund of the Gulf Arab state, which has benefited from this year's surge in oil prices, will be convertible into no more than 4.9 percent of Citigroup Inc.'s equity. Citigroup characterized the investment as passive and said the fund will not be able to name any board members to the bank. 
The Investment Authority will receive equity units that pay an 11 percent annual yield -a high price for Citigroup, whose dividend yield is 7.3 percent. They will then be converted into Citigroup common shares at a price of up to $37.24 a share between March 15, 2010, and Sept. 15, 2011. 
The purchase, announced late Monday, would make the Investment Authority one of Citi's largest share­holders.

Wrong?

governments can go to curious lengths to purge the observance of win­ter holidays, Winter Solstice or whichever recognition of the Christmas reality that gave rise to the "holidays" in the first place. This year, in Fort Collins, Colo., a "Holiday Display Task Force" recommended using white lights instead of red and green ones. The objective was to recognize the diversity of "a variety of winter holidays, such as Christmas, Hanukkah, Diwali, Birth of Baha'u'llah, Bhodi Day, the Winter Solstice, Kwanzaa and more." 
"Throughout history," the task force said, "the most common theme of win­ter celebration is light at a time of dark­ness." The "holiday displays" ean include "Symbols of Winter: snowflakes, snowmen, snow balls, iee skates, skis, pPnguins, polar bears, white lights, etc." Christmas was singled out for spe­cial depreciation by the exclusion of red and green lights which could remind people of something. Presumably, that exclusion would not apply to traffie sig­nals. On Nov. 20, sanity prevailed. The City Council rejected the proposal. 
Such controversies over Christmas reflect changes in the posture of gov­ernment toward religion dictated by Supreme Court decisions which lack coherence as well as fidelity to the meaning of the Constitution. Those decisions affect the culture.

Donnelly, the Court upheld the inclusion of a nativity creche in a Pawtueket municipal dis­play because the display also included "a Santa Claus house, reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh, candy-striped poles, a Christmas tree, earolers, cutout figures [ofl a clown, an elephant, and a teddy bear, hundreds of colored lights [and] a large banner that reads 'Seasons Greetings."' The purpose of the display, said the Court, was not to endorse reli­gion, but to promote shopping. This has come to be known as the "Three Plastic Animals Rule." As Justice Harry Blaekmun accurately said, it reduces the creche "to the role of a neutral har­binger of the holiday season, useful for commercial purposes, but devoid of any inherent meaning." Five years later, in County of Allegheny v. ACLU, the Court held that a creche standing by itself on a courttwuse staircase, with a sign say­ing the ereche was donated by the Holy Name Society, was an unconstitutional endorsement of religion. The Court found no such endorsement in the placement of a Hanukkah menorah, a Christmas tree and a "salute to liberty" sign outside the building. 
It is difficult to see any objective and predictable principle in such rulings. But what neutrality toward religion was the Constitution intended to require? 
The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment forbade Congress both to create an official, established church for the nation and to interfere with the established churehes that existed in six states, the last of which endml in 1833. The Clause required neutrality among religious denominations. We lack the space to explain here the process by which the Court has wrongly interprnt­ed the Clause to require governmental neutraljty, not among denominations, but between theism and non-theism. 
As Justiee William Brennan put it, the words "under God" can remain in the pledge of allegiance only beeause those words "may merely recognize the his­torical fact that our Nation was believed to have been founded 'under God."' Under the Court's theory, a statement by a public offieial that the four aflir­mations of God in the Declaration of Independence are in fact true would be an unconstitutional preference of the­ism. 
This suspension of judgment on the existence of God implicitly establishes an agnostic secularism as the oflicial religion. Government cannot affirm Christmas as a fact because, according to the Court, it cannot affirm even the existence of God as a fact. That would have surprised the members of the First Congress. From Sept. 24-25, 1789, they approved the First Amendment and directed President Washington to declare a day of "public thanksgiving and prayer ... acknowledging the ... favors of Almighty God." Washington did so, stating that "it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to 
implore his protection and favor." 
We have come a long way since 1789. But not even the Supreme Court ean change the reality of Christmas. As Cardinal Ratzinger agn~ml, before he became Pope Benedict XVI, the Christmas event "is infinitely more important than the creation of the world." 'The birth of Christ," he said, "is an event of a far grnater order of significance. God himself comes into the world and becomes a man." 
The trend today, he said, is "to sepa­rate this festival from Christianity and to reject its Christian beginnings .... In America, in ... commercialization and ... sentimentality, the display windows of large shops, whieh in former years were decorated with cr£1ches ... are now equipped with mythieal represen­tations, with deer and stags and Santa Clauses, whereby what is truly mythical is set side-by-side with what is Christian. Of course a lingering echo still rmnains of what ttiuchml people when they learned that God became a man. But this is an attempt to keep what is beautiful and touching and to get away from anything in it that makes demands upon us." 
And Christ does make "demands upon us." The birth of Christ, unlike that of, say, Aristotle or Jeremy Bentham, is controversial because, unlike all others, Christ makes a continuing claim, in the words of Monsignor Luigi Giussani, the founder of Communion and Liberation, to "absolute importance in our lives.... If an individual rejects this ... then a fundamental aversion sets in." The eon­tinued and focused opposition to public recognition of Christmas is a back­handed recognition of its unique reality and significance. 
Benediet XVI recently reminded a conference on the future of Europe that "[a] community that is built ... without remembering that every person is cre­ated in the image and likeness of God, ends by doing no one any good." Christmas recalls us to that reality. If we pay attention. Merry Christmas.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Standing with solidarity in the fight against AIDS 
Every 11 seconds, someone dies from AIDS, and every seven seconds, a new person contracts HIV. At this time ­
11:30 p.m. on Nov. 26 -about 40,529,209 people are living with HIV. The virus is far from gone, and it isn't going anywhere. 
In 2006, more were infected than any other year to date -4.3 million new people became HIV positive. It definitely is easy to feel helpless in making any sort of difference in this massive pan­demic. But there are things that we all can do. Besides just learning more about the virus and supporting the organizations that are at the forefront of research, treatment and care-giving, we can recognize the needs of our brothers and sisters who are the victims of the pandemic. 
Stigma has become the cohort virus to HIV. Besides suffering the physical tor­tures that one endures for years because of HIV/AIDS, there is the poten­tially more hurtful emotional torture of discrimination, isolation and injustice. While we as students may not be able to find the cure to AIDS, we can recognize the fact that we all truly are affected by the disease and can reach out and work to reduce stigma. 
Getting tested yourself for HIV is one step you can take to fight this stigma. If done solely for symbolic reasons, being tested puts oneself in the shoes of those who are facing the reality of the virus. Globally, only one in eight people who want to get tested actually are able to, and only one in ten who are infected has been tested. Knowing these facts, we cannot help but feel blessed to live in a country where the option to take part in such an important health measure is readily available. 
The scary thing, though, is that even with many different places offering test­ing, a quarter of all HIV positive Americans are not aware of their status. This week, you have the opportunity to show your solidarity with the millions who are suffering from AIDS in the world and the millions who are living with HIV and don't even know it. Free HIV testing is being conducted on Tuesday and Thursday nights from 6-8 
p.m. at the Health Center. It's a little-known fact that confidential HIV tests are always available on campus, giving students access to this important health information at any time. 
The option to get checked for free on these nights takes away any obstacle to being tested; not only is there no cost, but for every person that comes in and is tested, a monetary donation is being made to an NGO working for AIDS vic­tims in Kenya. Also, it's a rapid test -it is done quickly and produces results quickly, as well as involves no blood, only a swab of the tongue. 
Some people think the issue of HIVIAIDS and testing have no place on a Catholic campus. This couldn't be fur­ther from the truth. The Catholic Church has been involved in the fight against HIV since the beginning. Just last year at a U.N. General Assembly Special Session, it was recognized that the Catholic Church has to "fight stigma, and facilitate testing, counseling, and reconciliation." How could the Church, which calls us to be in "Communion with the Saints" -to be in solidarity with all of God's people -leave some­one to physically, spiritually and emo­tionally suffer? 
There is the tendency to reduce the situation to a Catholic vs. condom issue. AIDS is much bigger than the condom issue. The Church has generally been silent on the condom issue in regard to HIV, because for Catholic leaders today, it is not "no to condoms," but "yes to abstinence and fidelity." The issue at hand is caring for those who are suffer­ing and, in addition, advocating educa­tion as a form of prevention. 
HIV/AIDS truly does affect us all, whether Catholic, Jewish, black, white, young, old, American or African. This Saturday is World AIDS Day. Across the globe, international commitment is being demanded to address the realities of the pandemic. At Notre Dame, there is a call for your commitment to be in solidarity with 40,529,209 people who are suffering worldwide.

Dining Hall rule unreasonable 

I am writing in regard to the new signs posted by the trays and' silverware in 1S'outh Dining Hall. As I walked into South Dining Hall this morning, I was met by the same rude man as usual and his direction to this new sign. I'm not sure about North Dining Hall, but South Dining Hall has posted signs stating that no beverage containers are allowed in the dining hall. 
Regardless of whether this was a rule that was always thrown under the shelf and has become renewed or whether it is new, it is all together ridiculous. The majority of dining hall patrons never bring one in to begin with. For those that do, is it really that much of a deal for us to take something to drink in a container? I'm not one to complain, but it sure is nice to have hot choco­late in a "beverage container" while walking through windy South Quad. Is that too much to ask?

Dear Hollyw-ood: Keep it the satne 
Amid a holiday trailer blitz featuring fighting polar bears, an icy Nicole Kidman and more talking animals than a Dr. Doolittle film, "The Golden Compass" has found an enemy-Christian groups. 
Based on the nov­els in the "His Dark Alicia Wade Materials" series penned by Philip Pullman, "The Daily Egyptian Golden Compass" is the first in a trilogy dealing with the concept of an authorita­tive church and its battle with a child who possesses a compass that reveals truth. Through many fictitious and magi­cal happenings the main character jour­neys through different worlds to bring down the corrupt church. 
The novels have an anti-religious theme and people are protesting them being turned into films -so what? 
This isn't the first time Christian groups have spoken out against films and novels. Recently the Harry Potter series as well as "TheDa Vinci Code" have seen protests against their subject matter. People have the right to believe what they want to believe; see and read what they want to see and read; and protest what they choose to protest. 

It isn't the protesting that is offensive. Religion is obviously a touchy subject as beliefs are the heart and drive of people. It is human nature to protect what we hold dear and we should be respectful of everyone's beliefs and give each the opportunity to speak in defense of views. 
What is bothersome is the notion that Hollywood-more specifically New Line, the studio attached to the "Compass" project-is attempting to water down the themes integral to the original text, especially when the first installment of the "His Dark Materials" series is the least provocative in dealing with religion. 
In the film version of "The Golden Compass," the church is referenced as the "Magisterium," and New Line con­firmed to MTVNews that some religious references were relaxed. 
While it is clear filmmakers can't put every nuance from a novel into a film, themes shouldn't be changed just to appease a perceived backlash. The bot­tom line is people will go see the film if they want to, not because "the Church" was changed to "the Magisterium." 
Hollywood should honor its source material and protect the integrity of the original work and vision of the author. Of course some books make great movies with nips and tucks to stories, but if the editing causes the work to lose its origi­nal message, then it is distorting the composition of the author and disre­spectful to his creativity. 
"Compass" director Chris Weitz told MTV he has no intention of softening religious tones in the sequels to the film and should only be applauded for his decision. The single wish one could have is that New Line hadn't watered any­thing down at all. 
Audiences will choose what they want to see and whether it conflicts with their beliefs. It shouldn't be Hollywood's call to change the themes from literature to get a couple more bucks at the box office. 
Protect the work's integrity, Hollywood, and fans of the text will flock to the the­aters and thank you for it.

DISNEY'S LATEST COMBINES ANIMATION, LIVE ACTION 
By ANALISE LIPARI 
Assistant Scene Editor 
If someone asked the creative minds at Disney to come up with an amalgam of their animated movies, it would have to be called something like, "The Great Mulan-Ella and the Beast." Or maybe "Fantasia Pan, Aladdin and Bambi in Wonderland." Or something else to that effect. 
And as Belle from "Beauty and the Beast" would say, the plot would need to have "Far off places, dar­ing swordfights, magic spells, a prince in disguise!" Over-the-top scenery, crazy costuming, villains and heroes of legend or lore would be good suggestions, if not absolutely required. 
Thankfully for children and inner-children every­where, Disney has gone ahead and made its own ver­sion of the ultimate animated movie merger with its sweet, self-skewering new film "Enchanted." To its credit, "Enchanted" takes the tropes and cliches of Disney animated films and lets them run head-on into of these things in her own way, and Adams deserves credit for taking on a role that lesser aetresses might have played as nothing more than irony. Giselle really is that wide-eyed and innocent, and Adams plays up her princess idiosyncrasies for laughs, but in a way that reminds the audience why they loved Disney films in the first place. Her singing chops aren't bad either -the film's original songs all feature Adams' own singing voice. 
"He'll find his own way to tell you I with the little things he'll dol that's how you know!" she exclaims during the film's most ornate musical number, the Central Park extravaganza "That's How You Know." For an actress that most Disney fans probably haven't heard of, let alone seen one of her lesser-known films, Adams commands the screen and keeps the plot mov­ing with ease. 
The original songs are written by blockbuster Disney team Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz. known best to our generation for their work with the music from other Disney flicks. The pair worked together on "Pocahontas," and "The Hunchback of 
the cynicism of reality. The r---------------------, Notre Dame." Menken also film's good humor about worked on "Aladdin," Disney stereotypes and Enchanted "Beauty and the Beast" and postmodern twists feel gen-"The Little Mermaid," uine without being too self· among others. "True Love's deprecating. Director: Kevin Uma Kiss" is Edward and

animated sequence in "Happy Working Song" pays Andalasia, the mythical James Marsden & Susan Sarandon homage to "Snow White and 
home of young maiden Giselle (Amy Adams, "Junebug"), Prince Edward (James Marsden, "Hairspray") and an evil stepmother, Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon). Giselle and Edward long for true love's first kiss, and once they meet a grand wedding is immediately planned; that is, if Narissa has any­thing to say about it. Dabbling in wizardry and black magic like most animated Disney step-parents, Narissa pushes Giselle into a magical portal that sends her to a place "where there is no happily ever after." 
I 
That mystic place is New York City, where a terri­fled and three-dimensional Giselle meets divorce lawyer Robert Phillip (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter Morgan (newcomer Rachel Covey). Morgan's mother abandoned the pair years before, leaving Robert feeling disenchanted with Giselle's world of storybook romance and high-flying dreams. His rela­tionship with his girlfriend Nancy (Broadway star Idina Menzel), like much of his life, is dry and unemo­tiona!. Well, until Giselle arrives. 
The princess in a Disney mish-mosh animated movie would have to be smart, beautiful, independ­
ent, magical and sweet, while also maintaining per­fect hair and a gown that never wrinkles. Giselle is all the Seven Dwarves" with Giselle's "Whistle While You Work" mantra. 
Where "Enchanted" gets much of its charm is in how it playfully toys with Disney conventions. When Giselle sings the "Happy Working 
Song," for example, she opens Hobert's penthouse window to call the animals to help her. But instead of deer, rabbits and frogs, Giselle gets rats, pigeons and flies to clean Robert and Morgan's apartment. When Edward arrives in New York to rescue his damsel, he stabs a city bus with his princely rapier and, in a clip widely seen in the film's trailer, thinks his televi<>ion is a magic mirror. 
The cast members -Sarandon, Adams and Marsden in particular -seem to be having nothing but fun with their roles, and Dempsey is a solid real world foil for Giselle's animated world antics. Timothy Spall is ridiculously wily as Sarandon's henchman, and Pip, a CGl chipmunk, steals every scene he's in. 
"Enchanted" is so much fun that it's hard to remem­her you're watching what's really a gentle satire. For any critics or cynics out there, see "Enchanted" ­you'll feel the Disney magic in no time.

DISNEY TO RETURN TO TWO-DIMENSIONAL ANIMATION 
"Enchanted" may feature only 14 minutes of traditional two­dimensional animation, but those few minutes are only a baby step before Walt Disney Animation Studios takes a Cassie Belek giant leap back into 
Scene & Heard 

the world of feature-length 2-D animation with "The Princess and the Frog" in 2009. 
It may seem odd that producing a 2-D animated film would be something unusual for Disney, but when the studio announced that 2004's easily forgettable "Home on the Range" would be its last 2­D animated feature, the art form that Walt Disney built his empire on appeared dead to the House of Mouse. 
"The Princess and the Frog" may be just what the studio needs to usher in a third golden age of animation. The film, which for­merly went under the working title of "The Frog Princess," is set in jazz-age 1920s New Orleans and will mark a return to the fairytale as it features Disney's first African American princess, Tiana. Tony Award-winning actress and "Dreamgirls" star Anika Noni Rose will provide both the voice and vocals for the newest Disney princess. Plot details are sparse, but other char­acters include a southern debutante and her plantation-owning father, a Voodoo magician (the villain), a 200-year-old Voodoo priestess (the fairy god­mother), a prince from the fiction­al nation of Maldakesh and a fire­fly and alligator -the obligatory animal friends in the film.

Menken is the composer behind "Mermaid" and "Beauty and the Beast," and with lyricist Howard Ashman they won multiple Academy Awards for their work with Disney. Ashman, who died in 1991 of AIDS, and Menken have also been credited with helping to revive Disney animation in the early 1990s. It was Ashman who came up with the idea to make Ursula an overweight, voluptuous drag queen character and Sebastian a Trinidadian "Under

choice of

These overdue happenings at Walt Disney Animation Studios occur after an unsuccessful try at 3-D animation. In 2005, Disney decided to enter the CGI race sans Pixar with the underwhelming he has still 

paved the way for traditional 2-D animated films to be possible again. 
In addition to discontinuing the production of straight-to-DVD Disney sequels, Lasseter has announced a return to the pro­duction of theatrical animated shorts. "How to Hook Up Your Home Theater," starring Goofy, will premiere before "National Treasure: Book of Secrets," which is set to be released on Dec. 21. "Home Theater" is the first Goofy theatrical cartoon since 1961's "Aquamania." 
With all the changes happening at Disney in the post-Michael Eisner regime, it appears that tra­ditional 2-D animated features are on the brink of another ren­aissance. "Enchanted" is the first step as it lovingly pokes fun at its predecessors and points out the glaring passive stereotypes of the earlier princess films. 
There is no doubt that Tiana will build on the active roles of Ariel and Belle and set a new standard for Disney princesses. And after a five year break from 2-D animation, it will be time for Disney to reclaim its roots and find a better balance between commerce and art.

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 

Duke picks up tempo, blows out Wisconsin 
Gordon's 29 points help Indiana hold off Georgia Tech; Pittsburgh, Memphis win easily over Boston U, Austin Peay 
Associated Press 
DUHIIAM, N.C. -Duke fig­ured out how to make up for its sizn disadvantage against Wiseonsin -turn up the tempo. 
Crng Paulus scored 13 of his 1 X points during the decisive first half, and No. 7 Duke ran No. 20 Wisconsin right out of Carnnron Indoor Stadium in an X2-5S rout Tuesday night. 
Freshman Taylor King added 15 points in his sncond straight strong game ofT the beneh for tlw Blue Devils (7-0), who nntered wondnring how they'd contain a Wisconsin front line that featured three players in the rotation who are 6-foot-1 0 or taller. 
Fellow freshman Kyle Singler had 13 points, Gerald Henderson added 11 and Jon Schnyer scored I 0 for the Blue Dnvils. 
Duke's up-tempo offense and swarming, aggressive defense dominated from the opening tip, helping the Blue Devils improve to 9-0 in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge and remain the only tnam with a perfect record in tho annual event. 
Duke, which didn't start a player taller than 6-8, held its own on the glass -Wisconsin had just a 42-40 rebounding advantage -and that helped turn the Blue Devils' tirst legiti­matn test at home into a blowout. their NCAA-best 55th straight non-conference home­court vietory. 

Jon Leuer and Trevon Hughes scored 12 points apiece and Brian Butch had 11 for Wisconsin (5-1). which was denied its first 6-0 start since 1996-97. Hughes, the team's leading scorer, was held more than seven points below his average. 
Duke wasted no time pressur­ing the half-court-oriented Badgers into an up-and-down game, never allowing them to feel comfortable in their first visit to Cameron. 
The Blue Devils capped a dedsive 19-7 first-half run with a spectacular 15-second sequence that had the volume at the always-noisy arena at its loudest decibel level all season. 
llenderson got things going when he blocked a layup by Leuer to start a fast break, and Paulus buried a 3-pointer from the top of the key to extend Duke's lead to 22-14. 
Then, DeMarcus Nelson stole the ball from Michael Flowers and found Paulus in the left cor­ner. The point guard swished another 3 at the 11:30 mark to give the Blue Devils their first double-figure lead of the game at 25-14, sending the Cameron Crazies into earsplitting deliri­um. 
Singler's 3 from the top of the key 2 minutes later made it 28­16 and put Duke's lead in dou­ble figures to stay. 
Indiana 83, Georgia Tech 79 
Eric Gordon scored 29 points 

AP Indiana freshman guard Eric Gordon goes up for a layup In the Hoosiers' 83-79 win over Georgia Tech Tuesday. 

and D.J. White added 18 to help Indiana rally past Georgia Tech on Tuesday night. 
Jamarcus Ellis scored 12 of his 15 points in the second half for the 15th-ranked Hoosiers in their 21st straight regular-sea­son win at Assembly Hall. It also was the Big Ten's first victory in this year's Big Ten/ACC Challenge. 
Georgia Tech (3-3) was led by Lewis Clinch with 18 points. Anthony Morrow and Gani Lawai each added 17. 
Indiana (5-1) started both halves sluggishly, committing five turnovers in the first four minutes of the game and allow­ing Georgia Teeh to open the second half on a 9-0 run, which erased the Hoosiers' 38-34 half­time lead. 
But Indiana used some nifty drives by Gordon and Ellis to retake the lead, and the strate­gy eventually opened things up down low for White and on the perimeter for the outside shoot­ers. The result: Lance Stemler's 3-pointer with 7:20 to go not only gave Indiana a 60-58 lead, but also sparked an 11-2 run that made it 68-60. 
Georgia Tech got as close as 68-64 and was within five with less than a minute left, but the Hoosiers' late free-throw shoot­ing sealed the victory. 
Indiana played without fresh­man guard Jordan Crawford, suspended for three games min­utes before the opening tip for violating team rules. The announcement was made by 
coach Kelvin Sampson. Crawford was averaging 12.6 points. 
Pittsburgh 80, Boston 
University 53 
Ronald Hamon made all five of his 3-point attempts to score 15 points and No. 14 Pittsburgh put away Boston University quickly with a 20-3 run in the first half, staying unbeaten with a victory Tuesday night. 
The Panthers (6-0). again showing off their new, faster­paced offense, also got 14 points from leading scorer Sam Young, 11 points and eight assists from point guard Levance Fields and 11 points from Mike Cook. 
The early run put the Panthers up 21-5 and was simi­lar to that of a 22-0 run early in their 92-45 rout of Buffalo on Friday. Pitt's average winning margin against mostly light­weight competition is 31 points. 
Pitt is 6-0 for the sixth consec­utive season and has a chance to open at least 9-0 for the sixth season in a row. 
Fields hit a 3-pointer and Hamon made two in a row beyond the arc to put Pitt up 10­4, before Fields made a long jumper that was inches short of another 3. Keith Benjamin's 3­pointer and Tyrell Biggs' dunk made it 21-5, and coach Jamie 
Dixon used everyone  on  his  
bench after that.  
Boston  University  (1-5),  

picked by America East coaches to win the league but the loser of four in a row, still has not beaten a ranked opponent in 38 years -since a 1959 NCAA tournament upset of Navy. The Terriers lost the Eastern Regional finals to Jerry West-led West Virginia that season. 
Memphis 104, Austin Peay 82 
Freshman Derrick Hose had 19 points and 12 assists, and No. 3 Memphis shot 64 percent Tuesday night in a victory over Austin Peay. 
Hose was coming on· his worst game of the season, a four-point performance against Arkansas State a week before. This time, he shot 6-of-8 from the field as Memphis (6-0) built the lead to as many as 23 early in the sec­ond half. 
Chris Douglas-Hoberts led Memphis with 23 points on 11­of-15 shooting, and Shawn Taggart added a career-high 17 points. Joey Dorsey was one of three Tigers with 10 points. lie also grabbed 10 rebounds. 
Drake Hn1~d lnd the Governors (2-4) with 21 points, missing only one of his nine shots, while Todd Babington finished with 1 S points on 5-of-8 from the field, all from 3-point range. Wes Channels had 16 for the Governors, and Kyle Duncan finished with 10 points, hitting all four of his shots from the field. 
Memphis has won all its games by double digits. The Governors, who have lost two straight, never got the deficit under 16 in the final 17 min­utes.

MIAMI -Pro Bowl safety Sean Taylor died Tuesday after he was shot in his home by an apparent intruder, leaving the Washington Redskins in mourning for a teammate who seemed to have reordered his life since becoming a father. 
The 24-year-old player died at Jackson Memorial Hospital, where he had been airlifted after the shooting early Monday. 
"It is with deep regret that a young man had to come to his end so soon," father Pedro Taylor said in a statement on behalf of the family. "Many of his fans loved him because the way he played football. Many of his opponents feared him the way he approached the game. Others misunder­stood him, many appreciat­ed him and his family loved 

him." 

A string of mourners, including Taylor's father, visited the player's home and embraced outside. Authorities entered the home, but it was unclear what they were doing. 
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said the league will honor Taylor's memory at all games this weekend. 
'This is a terrible tragedy involving the loss of a young man who leaves behind many people struggling to understand it," he said in a statement. 
Redskins coach Joe Gibbs said what he would remem­ber most about Taylor was his excitement about play­ing football. 
"God made him to play football," Gibbs said Tuesday during a news con­ference. "To me, he just loved and thrived on the competition part of it. ... Sean, he loved football. He loved these guys here." 
Gibbs acknowledged it will be hard to concentrate on football this week. 
"I don't know how we'll deal with it, except we'll all do it together," he said. 
Fans already had begun a makeshift memorial by lay­ing flowers on a field near the front entrance to the Redskins' practice facility in Ashburn, Va. 
"This is a terrible, terrible tragedy," Redskins owner Daniel Snyder said. 
He added the team would honor Taylor with a patch on the jersey and the No. 21 on the helmet.

IN BRIEF Pitcher susP.ended 50 
games for failei:l drug test 
NEW YORK -Former Colorado Rockies pitcher Dan Serafini was sus­pended for 50 games Tuesday, the sec­ond player to fail a test for a perform­ance-enhancing drug this season under Major League Baseball's testing program. 
The 33-year-old left-bander played in three games and allowed two earned runs in one-third of an inning with the Rockies last season. Currently a free agent, Serafini has played for Minnesota, the Chicago Cubs, Pittsburgh, San Diego and Cincinnati. 
Serafini blamed the positive result on substances prescribed by a doctor in Japan, where he was limited to a total of 16 games in 2006 and 2007 because of what he described as "significant injuries." 
"While trying to accelerate the healing process of these injuries, I took substances that were pre­scribed for me by a doctor in Japan," Serafini said in a statement. 
Williams' NFL comeback cut 
short by injunry MIAMI ---Ricky Williams' latest comeback lasted one game. 
The Miami Dolphins running back will miss the rest of the season with a torn chest muscle, according to his agent, Leigh Steinberg. 
Williams was hurt Monday at Pittsburgh, when he played in his first game in nearly two years. He returned following a 1-year sus­pension for his latest violation of the NFL drug policy. 
Steinberg said the arm will be in a sling from four to six weeks and the rehab will take five months. 
But Steinberg said Williams expects to be ready for next sea­son. 
"It's sad given how hopeful Ricky had been about his return to foot­ball and given the amount of effort Ricky had put into his rehabilita­tion. But he's optimistic and hope­ful for the future," Steinberg said. 
page 13 
Clinton Portis also played with Taylor at the University of Miami. He had sensed a new maturity in his close friend. 
"It's hard to expect a man to grow up overnight," Portis said. "But ever since he had his child, it was like a new Sean, and everybody around here knew it. He was always smiling, always happy, always talking about his child." 
Two bouquets were left by a palm tree outside a front gate of Taylor's home. Beside the mailbox, an untouched newspaper lay with news of his shooting. 
Taylor's death comes nearly a year after Broncos cornerback Darrent Williams was killed in a drive-by shooting following an argument at a Denver nightclub on Jan. 1. 

Purdue's Howell to have sec­
ond surgery on shoulder 
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. ---Purdue guard Jodi Howell will have a second operation on her left shoulder and will apply for a medical redshirt to gain an extra year of basketball eligibility. 
Howell, a 5-foot-11 junior, had recon­structive surgery for a sprain in the shoulder in September. She will under­go another operation Thursday because of an infection that developed in the shoulder, coach Sharon Versyp said Tuesday. 
Howell, the 2005 Indiana Miss Basketball from Alexandria High School, started all but one game last season, averaging 6.8 points and leading the Boilermakers in 3-point percentage. She averaged 3.4 points as a freshman but missed the final 12 games of that season with a bro­ken foot. 
She also missed most of her junior season in high school after surgery on a torn ligament in her right knee.

Beckhatn scores but LA loses Dovvn Under 
Assodat~d Press 
SYDNEY, Australia -With David Bnckham bent over clt1tching his ankle, the Galaxy's first exhibition outside North America seemed doomnd to go down as a failnd marketing nxercise. 
When thn England midfielder b1~nt a tradnmark free kick into the goal IX minutns later and 1{0,295 pnople ros1~ to their fent clwering, it suddPnly was an unqualified success. 
Brand Beckham eertainly nnhaneed its status in Australia. despite the Galaxy's 5-3 loss to Sydney FC in an exhibition at the Olympie Stadium on Tuesday night. 
As second-half seorer Landon Donovan later said, if Bnckham had gone off in the 27th minute after a clumsy challenge from Sydney playnr Brnndon Santalab. the Galaxy's oflseason tour was as good as over. 
According to local reports, Bnckham is eontractnd to play 55 minutes in naeh match against A L1~ague dubs Sydney horn and at Wellington l'honnix on Saturday. 
"I always try and stay on wlwth1~r I'm injun~d or not," Bnekham said. ''I'm quite a stubborn pnrson. When I want to stay on, there's not many p1~ople who can convince me to eome oil". 
"The first time I'd heard about the 55 minutes I was wntractnd to play was yester­day. I was happy to play the whole game." 
Beckham has built his multi­million dollar fortune, together with pop star wife Victoria, the former Posh Spice, on giving the fans what they want whether it be on the field or the red carpet. 
"It was an entertaining match for the 80,000 fans. That's what they wanted, to see some goals and to see a bit of an exhibition. They got that," he said. 
After fearing a recurrence of the ankle injury he picked up in his last game for Real Madrid that contributed to him missing all but five games in his debut MLS season for Los Angeles, Beckham quickly regained his composure and his touch. 
The Galaxy were trailing 3-0 a minute before halftime when was awarded a free kick 24 yards out following a foul on Carlos Pavon. Enter Beekham.

The 32-year-old former England captain raised his arms to celebrate and then swapped high-lives with team­mate Kevin Harmse before walking oil" for halftime, giving Sydney's Brazilian import .Juninho a hug on the way to the tunnel. 
"In that sort of situation there's always a certain amount of pressure on me to score, because I think people expect you to do it every time there's a free kick given in that position," Beckham said. 
"I was really happy to score tonight because of the amount of fans and the attention that there has been on myself and this game tonight, so I was really pleased."

Former Arkansas coach takes Ole Miss job 
Only hours after resigning in Fayetteville, Houston Nutt accepts Rebels post vacated by Ed Orgeron 
Associated Press 
JACKSON, Miss. -One day, Houston Nutt was leav­ing Arkansas. The next, he was heading to Mississippi. 
Ole Miss will introduce Nutt as its new coach Wednesday, ending a whirl­wind hiring that began when he resigned at Arkansas on 
Monday and agreed to become the Rebels' coach about four hours later. 
Mississippi was without a coach for less than three days. Ed Orgeron was fired on Saturday after three los­ing seasons. 
Rebels athletic director Pete Boone said Tuesday he contacted Nutt on Sunday after hearing a rumor the coach would be resigning. Nutt didn't really want to talk then "because he had a job," Boone said. That soon changed. · 

"This all happened overnight with me," Boone said. 
Nutt agreed to a contract Monday night, a four-year

Cities for Life-Cities Against the Death Penalty VIGIL AT NOTRE DAME GROTTO FOLLOWED BY PRAYER FOR LIFE ON DEATH ROW AT NOTRE DAME LOG CHAPEL 7:00 p.m. Thursday November 29, 2007 
Throughout the world, more than 500 CITIES FOR LIFE are joining the 
largest ever mobilization AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY, and affirm their 
participation in the initiative 
NO JUSTICE WITHOUT LIFE 

to stop all executions in the world. The World Day "Cities for Life-Cities against the Death Penalty" celebrates the anniversary of the first abolition of the death penalty by the law of a European state, the Great Duchy of Tuscany in 1786. Many cities of all continents will light up their symbolic monuments-from the Colosseum in Rome to the Plaza de Santa Ana in Madrid, from the Central Obelisque in Buenos Aires to the Moneda Palace in Santiago-making a worldwide moral alliance to ask to stop all the capital executions. Participating cities include Rome, Bruxelles, Madrid, Ottawa. Mexico City, Berlin. Barcelona, Florence, Venice, Buenos Aires. Austin, Dallas, Antwerp, Vienna, Naples, Paris, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Reggio Emilia, Bogota, Santiago de Chile and about 400 others. This year many US cities will be participating including New York City, Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., and Boston. The initiative is promoted by the Community of Sant'Egidio and supported by international human rights organizations, gathered in the World Coalition Against the Death Penalty. They join in the effort to have a higher level of justice, justice without revenge, restorative justice that never denies life. "Cities for Life -Cities Against the Death Penalty"!

deal that will pay him $1.7 million to start and increase by $100,000 each year. He has an option for three more seasons as well, with the opportunity to earn more money with incentives. 
"I think we were thorough in our discussions and cov­ered all the things we need­ed to cover, but I felt like let's get this thing done," Boone said. 
Nutt will be introduced at a news conference on earn­pus in Oxford, ending a fre­netic 48 hours for the school and its new coach. 
"It's human nature not to like change, but I think in this case, change is going to be a good thing," fullback Jason Cook said. "Especially as a player, you get excited when a guy gets hired like 
coach Nutt. He's more than proven in the SEC and proven as a coach that he can take talent and work with it. We're very excited." 
Nutt led Arkansas to an 8-4 record and a likely Cotton Bowl

corning last week when the Razorbacks beat then-No. 1 LSU 50-48 in triple overtime. 
While the Razorbacks head into the postseason, Nutt will be going to the homes of recruits attempting to hold together the promising class Orgeron was assembling. 
The 50-year-old Nutt said Monday he left Arkansas to help mend a split among fans after off-the-field prob­lems were compounded by a difficult season. The Razorbacks started the year ranked and were expected to contend for the SEC West title. 
Arkansas lost its first three SEC games and dropped out of the poll in September, fueling fan discontent over last year's transfer of quar­terback Mitch Mustain and the loss of offensive coordinator G u s 
returned. 
Arkansas 
officials said 
they would 

not com­ment until after Wednesday's formal announcement. 
Nutt takes over a program that's won four or fewer games a season since 2003's 10-win effort under David Cutcliffe. The Rebels won a share of the SEC West that season with Eli Manning at quarterback. 
Since the Rebels are 14-32. Boone fired Cutcliffe in 2004 for not recruiting well enough. 
He had hoped Orgeron, who helped build two national title teams at Southern California as Pete Carroll's recruiting coordi­nator, would bring the kind of energy needed to compete in the tough SEC. 
Orgeron finished 10-2 5 and was routinely the target of fan discontent. 
Boone and Chancellor Robert Khayat endorsed Orgeron midway through the season, but decided to go in a new direction after the Rebels lost five of six to end the year. 
The Rebels have been look­ing for a coach who can pro­duce championships since Johnny Vaught retired in 1970. Vaught won three national titles and six SEC championships between 1947-63. 
The school has fired six of the eight coaches who have come since and a seventh, Steve Sloan, likely would have been fired after five losing seasons had he not left for Duke. 
The last three coaches have been assistants in their first job as leading man. Orgeron, Cutcliffe and Tommy Tuberville went 73­69 over the last 13 years. 
Only Tuberville left on his own, taking the job at Auburn in 1998.

control the ball and the Irish del'lected passes and put back offensive rebounds for easy lay-ins. 
But the Golden Griffins battled back. Two lay-ups from center Laura Buetow and a thrne-pointer from guard Amanda Cavo helped Canisius take an 11-10 lead. 
At this point, the Irish 
press took over. After a jumper by Schrader put the Irish ahead 17-11, Notre Dame went on an 18-4 run to make the score 35-15 midway through the first half. 
"We just like to pressure the offense," Allen said. "We want to force them into turnovers and that's some­thing we're doing pretty well this year." 
Notre Dame led 49-22 at the half. In the beginning of the sec-


ond half, Schrader took the ball into the lane until the defense collapsed towards her. She then hit a wide-open Melissa D'Amico, who laid the ball in. Schrader lived in the paint all game and either found the open man when she drew extra defenders or made the defense pay by hit­ting the 10-foot jumper. 
"She is really our best zone offensive player in the high post," McGraw said. "She's strong, the guards aren't afraid to throw the ball to her because she'll catch it, and she's really good at see­ing the floor and finding someone in there and push­ing to make the shots. She's really hard to guard in there." 
The Griffins had to deal with foul trouble. Point guard Brittane Russell had three fouls in the first half and guard Micayla Drysdale had four. 
"Our foul trouble killed us because we really, really have no depth at all with the injuries we have," Zeh said. 
Notre Dame forced two timeouts in the first five min­utes of the second half­one on an inbounds play and another in play -due to their tough defense. 
McGraw said the Irish can do better. 
"Overall I think we haven't really scratched the surface of our potential yet," McGraw said. "We can be a really formidable team when we have everybody going on all cylinders."

shot. In short, he needs to be more like Falls. 
''I'm going to try to mimic him in certain situations, although I am a different player," McA!arney said. 
Notre Dame has had plenty {)f inside scoring this season, with forwards Rob Kurz and Luke Harangody averaging 15.2 and 
17.0 points per game, respec­tively. 
But until McAlarney's recent hot streak, Notre Dame was lacking in sufficient scoring from Its guards -something it will need against No. 25 Kansas State next week and once the Big East season starts. 
Point guard Tory Jackson, while averaging more than five assists per game, has compiled only six points per contest and has hit a single three-pointer this season. 
Forwards Hyan Ayers and Luke Zeller have some jump shooting ability, but their height often necessitates them setting up closer to the basket. So most of the outside shooting respon­sibility falls on McAlarney ­and in the last two games, he's started to meet that pressure. 
"I feel like I need to be the gunslinger," he said. "If the other team makes a run, and then I hit a three, that can be a dagger."

Last ynar Notre Dame advanced to the quarterfinal round of the NCAA Tournament for the first time in program history. This August. thn tnam made it one of tht~ir season's goals to top that mark. 
The Irish will take thn first stt~p towards reaching that goal tonight when they face Oakland in the seeond round of the tour­nament. 
"Certainly one of our goals is to take it as far as we ean," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. "It's very important that we don't look beyond each step along the way. It's one step at a time and Oakland is the first step." 
No. 10 Notre Dame earned a first round bye following their run to the Big East finals where they lost 2-0 to Connecticut on the Huskies' home turf Nov. 18. Clark thinks tla~ ten days off has prepared the team for aetion against the Golden Grizzlif~s tonight.

McAiarney said part of the reason for his improvement is that the last two games have been at the Joyce Center, after Notre Dame played three games in the Virgin Islands. 
"This is our home floor," he said. "We play here every day. It's a lot easier to get into a rhythm here than anywhere else." 
MeAlarney also has been adjusting to his role as Notre Dame's primary outside shoot­er. Last season, before his sus­pension in January, McAiarney was the starting point guard.

Guard Ashley Barlow scored 18 points and had six assists and guard Charel Allen added 17 points as Notre Dame beat Canisius 93-47 Tuesday at the Joyce Center. 
The Irish (5-1) kept the Golden Griffins offense from creating any momentum with a tenacious full-court press that helped it create 29 turnovers, 18 of which came in the first half. 
"We like the press. We're pretty good at it," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "That's how we score a lot of points in transition. We like to play that way, we're more com­fortable playing this way." 
Canisius coach Terry Zeh said Notre Dame's size and athleticism prevented the Griffins (3-2) from establish­ing their offense. 
"We really struggled with their pressure·as you could see," Zeh said. "Our point guard is small and you have (Irish forward] Devereaux Peters at the top of that press, or any of their athletic players at the top of that press, and we couldn't see over that at all. And when we

Team finds goalkeeper vvithKaras 
By FRAN TOLAN Spons Writer 
Three months ago, Notre Dame did not have an estab­lished starting goalkeeper. 
Heturning starter senior Lauren Karas, sophomore Kelsey Lysander and freshman Nikki Weiss each auditioned daily for the right to stand between the pipes for the Irish. 
But now, after Karas led the team to a 3-2 upset victory of No. 4 North Carolina in the NCAA Hound of 16 Sunday, hardly a question remains. 
Karas, who has been the unquestioned starter since Sept. 28, made clutch save after clutch save against the Tar lleels and displayed the poise she has gained since winning the permanent starter job. 
"We made that decision (to start KarasJ around the Louisville game to just let her go and let her run with it," Irish coach Handy Waldrum said. "It seems to have really helped her confidence. It just built and built and she hasn't let us down." 
Since a 1-0 win over

did get it over the top we couldn't attack and make them pay at all." 
The turnovers, Zeh said, came partly as a result of his team's lack of depth and injuries. 
"We're young and injured right now," he said. "For a team of our level to compete, you've got to take care of the basketball." 
Five Notre Dame players scored in double figures in the game. Along with Barlow and Allen, Peters scored 12 points and guards Lindsay Schrader and Brittany Mallory had 10 each. 
The Irish jumped out to an 8-0 lead in the first 1:28 of the game. Canisius failed to
