Stock, bond markets react

to Federal Reserve's plans 
NEW YORK (AP) -Frenzied activity rocked the stock and bond markets of Wall Street for the second straight day yester­day in a convulsive reaction to the Federal Reserve's new plans for clamping down on credit. 
Trading volume at the New York Exchange reached a re­cord 81.62 million shares, far outdistancing the previous high of 66.37 million set Aug. 3, 1978. 
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, off about 25 points at mid-afternoon staged a late rally to finish with an 8.37 decline at 849.82. That left the widely recognized average with a loss of more than 48 points since Monday. 
Bond prices likewise came under intense pressure as the markets absorbed the shock of new record levels of interest

Pope reaffirms traditional women's roles 
VATICAN CITY (AP)-Pope John Paul II yesterday urged Roman Catholic nuns to be loyal to his leadership in the church and never betome ''irritated or embittered.'' 
The pope'swords were inter­preted here as an indirect ref­erence to the dramatic request an American nun, Theresa Kane, made to John Paul in Washington, asking him to allow women to become priests. 
Three days ago, addressing the pope in the Sanctuary of the Immaculate Conception, Sister Kane called for equal ''rev­erence and dignity for all persons" and appealed to John Paul to admit women to "all ministries in our church." 
During yesterday's public audience in St. Peter's Square the pope hailed a group of 600 

Groups aid boat people in adjusting to society

Today 's article investigates the groups mvolved tn helpmg the Boat People adjust to society while tomorrow 'a article looks at the process of socialization.

Boat people: they come from Laos, Cambodia and Viet Nam in _hop~s of a new life, following~ long andtortur~usjourney on a pnmmve craft. For some, the Journey ended with refuge in a new land. For others it ended in a Malaysian displaced persons camp or death at sea. 
There are an estimated 16 million displaced persons in the world. ~f_these, a gre~t part come from Indochina as refugees from political oppresston. -They may only enter the United States if they are guaranteed sponsorship. In the South Bend area a major effort is under way to find sponsors for these people and help them establish a new life. 
The United Religious Community (URC) is heading the drive in South Bend to take these people in and give them support in starting a new life. The URC has set up the South East Asian Task Force to organize both sponsors and support groups to help in the resettlement effort. 
Many local families are sponsors making the refugee family situated and acquainted with life in midwest America. "Resettling is an· educational task," said Kevin McDonnell, chairman of the Philosophy Department at Saint Mary's College. McDonnell and his wife Carol are currently sponsoring

London. 
Despite all the turmoil, how­ever, many Wall Streeters con­tinued to praise the Federal Reserve's decision last week­end to bring out some heavy new ~uns in its battle against inflatton. 
Many conceded that the new steps raised the odds of at least a moderate recession in the months ahead, and potentially rugged times for such impor­tant industries as housing con­struction and auto manu­facturing. 
But they argued that whatever short term pain might result could be more than offset by the longer-term benefits of pro~­gress against rapid inflation, which many economists regard as a ticking time bomb for the 
U.S. economy. 
And they said the . market's shary declines this week did not ~ualify as any kind of "crash" hke the devastating slide of 1929, when stock prices lost nearly 50 percent of their value over a few short weeks. 
This week's slide, by contrast, represented a loss of between 7 and 8 percent, as measured by the Dow Jones industrial aver­age, through mid-afternoon yesterday. 
''There is no earthly reason for a stock-market panic," said Heinz H. Bid, a veteran market analyst with the brokerage firm of Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. "What the Fed is doing is a very constructive move. If it's successful, it will avoid a major depression in the future.'' 
"The Fed is running some risks here, but they are calcu­lated risks." said William . Griggs, a credit expert at the J. Henry Schroder Bank & Trust Co. "It is saying, 'we are soing to moderate inflation, and if you ~ive us some time we can bring 1t down significantly.''' 

Evaluation systein needs reworking 
by]im Soisson 
. Provost Timothy O'M~ara and 
the majority of faculty members 
agree that the pres.ent ~ystem 
of teacher evaluauon m the 
classroom itself needs re­
evaluating.
''The instruments for measur­
ing teaching performance are 
not as refined as those used to 
measure research contrib­
utions," O'Meara said. "Other 
methods besides the teacher 
evaluation forms should be 
developed.'' 
In a survey conducted by the 
Senate Facu.lty Committee, Chairman Ken Goodpaster found that almost 70 percent of the faculty polled were also dissatisfied with the way the forms were used. Faculty members saw the forms as only quantitative, and-since they are the sole source to judge a teacher's performance in the 
classroom--not a true measure of that performance. 
"Teachers should not be !Deasured by a one dimensional mstrument,'' Goodpaster said. "It's like walking on one leg." 
Goodpaster questioned what he called ''one of the inherent weaknesses '' in the evaluation process. "Numbers tend to speak louder than anythin~ else," he said, "especially tf you don't have anythmg else to rely on." 
O'Meara, also a mathematics professor, proposed as one possible added evaluation tool some kind of teacher visitation. This would entail teachers to evaluate their colleagues in a classroom situation. "fhis type ofthing has worked in the Math department before," he noted. 
Goodpaster also proposed the

Investigators exrunine Nursing 
by Mary Leavitt 

A team of investigators from the National League of Nursing are studymg the Saint Mary's Nursing Department to deter­mine whether to grant the department accreditation. The team arrived on campus Mon­day night and will remain until Friday. 
Preparations for this visit have been going on for over a year. In the fall of 1978, committees made up of both faculty and students began to gather infor­mation. These committees then met and anaiyzed data about facilities, student affairs, in­
struction and curriculum sourc­es. 
Their findings were published as a self-evaluation report over the stimmer in a volume conta­ining approximately 300 pages. The o~jective of ~~ investi~a­tors will be to clarify, amplify and verify the facts as present­ed in the self-evaluation repon. 
Among other things, the team will be attending conferences with the administrator of the nursing unit, Dr. Mary E. Martucci, ' talking indtvidu­ally with students and visiting classes and clinical labs. 
On Friday, upon completion of the survey, the visitors will 

Economists predict rate hike ; small business will hurt most 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Small businesses will be hit hardest ­and first -by rising interest rates, economists say. Many won't flnd credit, while others may pay more than 16 percent interest in coming weeks . 
People who buy, sell and build 

' houses also wiU be some of the first victims of rising interest rates. Economists say pros­pe~tive homeowners will find it more difficult to get mongages, which in turn wtll slow home­building. 
The Federal Reserve Board last weekend increased its bank lending rate from 11 percent to a record 12 percent and tight­ened its control on the availibili­ry of money and credit. 
J.he moves generated immedi­ate upsurges in other shon-term interest rates. The overall effect resulted in stock prices recording their steepest drop in more than five years Tuesday. 
Chase Manhattan Bank on Tuesday boosted the prime rate to its best customers by an entire percrQJ:ilg~,pQint,...to.M,~ percent. 
Small businesses, however, rarely qualify as "best custom­ers." They usually must pay 2 percent to 3 percent above the prime rate, said economist Richard landry of the U.S. Chamber of Gommerce. 
That is almost as much as

class visitation idea, saying the Senate Faculty Committee will look into it, as well as other possible evaluation methods. 
Associate Professor Richard Thompson disagreed with ''vis­itation'' as a feasible evaluation method. He suggested that this could create an "artificial" situation. ''The teacher could put on a show or be so nervous that he would be unable to be himself and teach as effectively as potentially possible," he said. 
Teacher evaluation forms are but "one factor among many in determining tenure," accord­ing to Charles McCollester, coordinator of Analytical Studies. · 
Research contributions to the University and service to the communty are also criteria used in the tenure process. 

consumers pay on credit-card interest, and it makes borrow­ing very difficult for most businesses with sales below $500,000 a year, Landry said. 
Moreover, he added, there are growing reports that smaller, regional banks are hesitant to extend loans. 
Consumers who want loans also wi~l face difficulties, say econom1st~. 

submit their report. This report will include major strengths and weaknesses of the program in relation to the information presented in their self-evalua­tion. 
The report will then be pre­sented to the National League of Nursing Board of Review, which meets twice a year. This board will decide whether or not Saint Mary's School of Nursing is to receive accredita­
tion. 
Accreditation would be an 

invaluable asset for the nursing ·school. It indicates to the general public and the educa­tional community that a pro­gram has clear and appropriate objectives and is prov1dmg the conditions under which its ob­
jectives can be fulfilled. 
"Ri~ht now, things look very 
prom1sing for the nursing scho­
ol," Sr. Aloise Anne, a member 
of the National League of 
Nursing, said. "I am really 
enJoymg my v1sit and have seen 
some wonderful and impressive 
things. I hope the visit will be a 
successful one for Saint 
Mary's." 
''This visit is a very exciting 
thing for anyone involved in· 
nursmg," remarked Theresa 
Robb, a sophomore nursing 
major. "I think, Saint ·Mary's 
has really organized it well. 
The nursing teachers have kept

to ve a little harder to get a c-ar loan, a little harder to get a mortgage,"said economist Wil­iam E. Gib~on of the brokerage house Smtth Barney Harris Upham & Co. Inc. 
In a credit crunch small busi­nesses suffer hardest because they lack the avenues to borrow open to larger companies. Few small companies can issue stock to attract funds, nor do they have long-range lines of credit with their banks. 
Ifthey must borrow to weather a sales slowdown and maintain inventories, they will pay the prevailing interest rates, said economist Herman Director of the National Small Business Association. 
''The first reaction of store owners," Landry said, "will be to hold sales to obtain needed cash." 
"But if everybody holds sales at the sa,e time, it win't work and then the retailers will be forced to lay off workers," he said. "Part-time jobs will disappear and women will suf­fer because they are found heavily in this area." 
Numerous economists are predicting ·that the Federal Re­serve Board's tight-money thrust will deepen the expected recession, and unemployment­currently 5.8 percent-could reach 8 percent to 9 percent next year.

Whether o~ not the n~rs~og s\hool receives accreditation will be up t6 the Board· of Review after 1this Friday, but Ms. Robb said, "I really think we deserve it. After all we have a lot of successful g;adu­ares out there who speak for themselves. ­

Volunteer groups offer services

In th· JOO Cent., 
Editor's note: Today' s article is .the final installment in a three­part sen'es examining the a&ti­vtltes oj \ student volunteer gro­ups at Saint Mary's anti Notre Dame. 
by Kit Bernardi 

Volunteer Services involves numerous dedicated students in its various services groups. Some of the organizations are concerned with providing community service to various locations in South Bend. These or~anizations include Angel Air Fhght, Community Services, MANASA, A VIDD, and Council for the Retarded. 
Angel Air Flight is concerned with community service work in South Bend. President Lisa Moore described Angel Air F:Ii2ht as a national organiza­pon affiliated with Air Force ROTC, but added that the group is for civilians. Some of the events the organization has planned for this year include a Halloween party for Logan Cen­ter, Christmas caroling in South Bend, and planning a fund-run for the American Cancer Soci­~ty in the sprin~. Angel Flight mvolves approxunately SO ND and SM students. 

Another program sponsored by Volunteer Services is Hot­line. 
'Hotline provides over-the­telephone information and ref­erral," explained South Bend Campus representative Raul Aportela. Aportela described Hotline's role as "a go-between for the people(the callers) and the Sex Offense Service (SOS) in South Bend.'' Listeners are required to go through an 18-hour training session before they can worlc the 4-hour-a­week shift. This training session is a  · s·tandard thing for all listeners," Aportela empha­
sized. ·· 
One of the organizations be­longing strictly to the · community is CILA. (Commun­ity for the I'nternational Lay Apostolate) CILA's activities include community projects such as se.rying nursing homes. family-child centers, the Cor­villa House and the Northeast­ern Neighborhood Center. 
CILA also sponsors summer projects which chairman Mark Wathen described as "urban live-in experiences where mem­bers work: with clergy in various cities and in Mexico.'' 
CILA offers events for its 90 SMC/ND members which in­clude an orientation weekend and retreat weekend. 
In February, CILA will spon­sor i~s annual workshop which includes speakers on so­cial justice. 
Circle K is affiliated with Kiwanis International. It is a direct service concerned with providing volunteer services in areas where it is needed. Circle K sponsors community-service 
proj&ts and charity fund-rais­tng dtfves in South Bend. The president of Circle K at ND is Mark Skiba.

Senate rejects emergency bills 
WASHINGTON (AP)-The Senate, rejecting two House­passed emergency spending bills, voted instead 81-15 yes­terday to stick with its own version of legislation needed to keep the government operating fully.
The House-Senate dispute, stemming largely from differ­ences over federal financing for abonions, is forcing seven major government departments and numerous smaller agencies to get by on funds left over from the fiscal year that ended 10 days ago. 
Some programs already have been cut back. And about 90,000 eln'p'ioyees of' the· departments of Transportation ana labor will receive only half pay when their next p;tychecks are due, officials of those agencies said yesterday

On another issue in content­ion, Senate leaders indicated they were willing to bend o~ a proposed 5.5 percent pay ratse for members of Co~gress, as demanded by the House, so long as only House members and not Senators are voted a raise. 
But on the abortion issue, there was no sign of a willing­ness to compromise on either side. Congressional leaders told President Carter at a White House Breakfast meeting they see no· easy solution to the bitter abortion dispute. 
"Right now, V:~t..r' in .t stale­mate," said Speaker l'homas P. O'Neill. 
Carter was described as con­cerned about the situation but making no move to intervene.· 
The House would authorize federal financing of abortions or ~:he prospective mothe.r' s life would be threatened. The 
te also would allow financ­ing in cases of rape, incest or threatened damage to the preg­·nant woman's health. 
Agencies affected by the financing impasse include the Departmentsof Defense, Agri­culture, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Trans­portation, Labor, and Health, Education and Welfare.

FIREHOUSE IS HOT! 
''Goodbye Charlie'' 
Firehouse Theatre [South Bend Civic Theatre, Inc.) 
By Edward McNally and Randy McNally 
Ever found yourself wishing chat the sexy, attractive--but also reluctant--SMC girl you've been seeing was more like the buddies you have so much fun with? Well, ifyou've always wanted to marry yourroommatethere's still hoPe_ 
That is, if you accept the delicious premise of "Goodbye Charlie," the enduring and zany comedy playing at the Firehouse Theatre this coming weekend. Under the careful hand ofdirector Rick Holderman, the South Bend Civic cast instills enthusiasm and life in this classic play. 
That is not as easy as it sounds: The title character and driving force of the comedy dies before the curtain ever rises, shot by a jealous husband while climbing out of a porthole ("After all," muses a fnend, "how many of us are lucky enough to die doing something we really believe in?"). 
We never do meet Charlie Sorel: movie-writer, glamor boy, and womanizer of great repute. With his death he leaves behind $75,000 in debts and an emotional bankruptcy ofabused andwoundedlhearts. Ironic for someone never onstage, Charlie 1s bigger than life: challenging, charismatic, controversial. "What a bastard he was!" declares Rusty,, his last and fatal lover, wistfully adding "_ .. but then again, he was so vital, so alive." As his friends join to say goodbye, it's clear that Charlie was the circus ringmaster who gave meaning to the1r lives. 
Charlie's closest friend, George Tracy, jets into this Malibu gathering to tend to final matters. Sad but not surprised, George has energetic faith in Charlie's spl,lnk:' 'Ihope he's out there somewhere screwing up the Cosmos l'' 
And so he is, and so is launched the improbable plot of this merry comedy: Charlie returns to his apartment as a breath-taking, "new born," 28-year old woman. The Cosmos has played a trick on Charlie to teach him a lesson about love, and in the process Geor~e and Rusty are caught with the table turned in their relationships with Charhe. ''Not only IS there a God,'' shouts George, at first gleeful over the predicament, "but He also has a sense of humor!" 
The new Charlie is eager to seek adventure, but it isn't all so neat: She doesn't know to wear make-up or a dress, and although the other Charlie ''deflowered the captain of the Holyoke High field hockey team at the tender age of 15,'' the femmine version is nearly twice that age and yet still a virgin. She learns fast but misses a few steps: Trapsing off to Elizabeth Arden's she looks the epitome of class in an $800 evening gown--only to be caught before LA's finest wearing only aT-shirt and jockey shorts underneath. 
At first this is all just a new game for Charlie, but romantic stirrings are evident when her playful attempts to seduce George result in frustration for them both. The turning point comes when Rusty arrives, intent on killing the scheming new Charlie. Instead, the two ladies sit down and slowly unwind with "chemical assistance" (a pitcher and a half of martinis). 
This is the best scene of the play, tightly directed by Holderman. Through the thick for Charlie suddenly learns about himself from the proud woman whose heart he broke. Charlie's goal, Rusty bitterly reflects, was to make others love him without loving them in return. ''Charlie Sorel,'' his reincarnation finally sees, ''was a real nickle-plated son of a bitch.'' 
Of course, there's a happy, almost magical ending and infectious good humor all along. Toysa True as Charlie is lovely, engaging, full of bravado and impishness. She titilates George and the audience beyond with a pair of

Reflections on The Cult 

the listener the impression that this progression has been detoured · at least for a moment. · 
Ever since the phenomenal success of "Don't Fear the Reaper," from the Agents of Fortune LP, cult watchers have harbored a latent fear that the group might be tempted to deviate from its established, al­though unconventional, course, to gain more appeal in the watered­down, but profitable, area of com­mercial radto. Indeed, lead singer Eric Bloom told nie after a recent concert that BOC definitely has not received the recognition he feels it deserves. 
' 'A lot of the groups that used to open for us on the road like Kiss andThe Rolling Stone ad reads, "With Cheap Trick, have gone on to become one eye looking backward and nine very popular . and very rich," Bloom eyes on the road ahead, Blue Oyster recalled.

have been resettled in the last 50 days. To date, Catholic Charities of the diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend has acted with the Southeast Asian Task Force to find homes and jobs for these people. According to ] ulie Holstein, refugee co-ord­inator of the Fort Wayne-South Bend diocese, there is a need for both sponsoring families and support groups. Support groups are an ideal way for college students to become involved in the effort.'' she said. 
Sponsoring a family requiresmuch more than just finding them a place to stay. The commitment is for at least one year of constant support and the follow up counseling often 
goes on for years. According to McDonnell, the refugees must often be taken to the hospital during their first few weeks for health reasons. They must also be transported and they need orientation into the complex­ities of life in modern America. There are so many areas that need to be covered that it is very difficult for a sponsoring family to do it alone. 
Another major problem in the resettlement of refugees is the language barrier. In the first wave of refugees who came

delivery to DeCinces. Two pitches later, the Orioles third baseman unloaded a long homer into the left field bleach­ers, making the score 5·0. 
DeCinces thus became the 15th man in World Series history to hit a ho.mer in his first Series swing. Among the others w~sthe legendary Balti­more third baseman Brooks Robinson, DeCinces' predeces­sor at the position for the Birds and the man who threw out the first ball Wednesday night. 
When Billy Smith followed with a single, it finished Kison, who threw 27 pitches and retired only· one batter in the long Baltimore inning. Jim Rooker relieved and stopped the Baltimore rally. 
The five-run rally fell two runs short of the biggest first inning in any World Series game, a seven-run romp by the Mil­wauke Braves against the New York Yankees in 1958. 
The only good thing about the big Orioles' inning for the Pirates was that it came in Baltimore's first at-bat, and it gave Pittsburgh eight chances to come back. The Pirates very nearly made it-with DeCinces' help. 
Flanagan piched his way out of jams in the fourth and ft.fth innings. He surrendered lead­off singles to Foli and Parker in the fourth. An infield grounder by Stargell scored Pittsburgh's first run. 
In the fifth, Flanagan surren­
dered a leadoff double to 
Garner but retired the next 
three batters. 
In the sixth, Parker and Bill 
Robinson opened with singles. 
Flanagan recovered to strike 
out Stargell, and he got Bill 
Madlock on a fly ball. Then, 
however, DeCinces kicked a 
grounder by Steve Nicosia, 
loading the bases. 
Now, Flanagan dueled Gar­

Saint Mary's splits with Tri-State 
by Kate Huffman Sports Wn'ter 
The Saint Mary's College vol­leyball team split a triangular meet with Tri-State and Man­chester at North Manchester last Tuesday. With the split the Belles increased their season record to 3-5. 
In the first match, Saint Mary's scored its second victor­y of the year in as many outings against Tri-State by game scores of 15-12 and 15-11. 
"I was very happy with the team spirit and communication, they played very ag~ressively. Although our passmg was a little weak, our spiking and serving were very strong,'' said c~ach Erin Murphy after the 
WIO. 
Murphy commended Amy Terry for her performance in the match agamst Tri-State. She continued her streak of impressive spiking with 66 per­cent kills on spike attempts. 
In the second match of the evening, the Belles met a tough team from Manchester College. After losing the first game 7-l 5 to Manchester, the ~elles came out strong in the second game and took an early 8-0 lead. But, Manchester soon began to pick away at the lead the Belles had attamed. The Manchester team eventually/ulled ahead ofSaint Mary's an took the game, and the match 15-13. 

"I feel Manchester was one of the strongest if not the strong­est team we've faced so far. The girls really dido' t know what to expect," Murphy com­mented. "I was pleased with the way we played. The loss to Manchester will help the ~iris develop mental tou~hness. ' 
On Saturday begtnning at 9 a.m., the Belles will host the second annual Saint Mary's College Volleyball Invitational at Angela Athletic Facility. Nine teams, including Saint Mary's and Notre Dame, will participate in the round robin 2-pool tournament. Each team will play all of the teams in their

by Theresa Hickman Sports Writer 
St. Mary's Belles field hockey team battled to a 1-1 decision against Valparaiso in an away contest on Tuesday afternoon. 
The scorer of the afternoon for the Belles was freshman Lisa Keeley with her goal coming at the beginning of the second half.St. Mary's was ahead until the tail end of the game when 
Valparaiso  scored  from  the  
corner to tie the match.  
Coach  Ann  Diede  felt  that  

Tuesday's match was "equally 
distributed" as well as "a wide open game. 
Diede also spoke of her team's , good passing and the ability to work together. First-year center halfback Nancy Loren­zini was one of the player's that contributed to the team's fine play on Tuesday. "There are a lot of first year players and the team is just starting to jell,'' stated Diede. 

The St. Mary's field hockey team will close their season this weekend with a tournement at Franklin College. The final games will be played against Bearea and Center College from Kentucky.

First-inning outburst lifts Birds over Bucs 
BALTIMORE (AP)-Doug DeCinces smashed a two-run homer, capping a five-run Balt­imore upnsing in the first inning, and the Orioles went on to defeat the Pittsburgh Pirates 5-4 in the once-postponed open­ing game of the 1979 World Series Wednesday Night. 
The Orioles' bats cooled after the early barrage, but they took advantage of some shabby Pir­ates fielding to build the big­gest first inning in any qpening game in the 76-year history of the Series, which was moved back one day by rain on Tuesday. · 
Twice Pittsbursh could have escaped the innmg on double play balls, but both times the Pirates failed to turn the play. Eventually, they paid the pnce on this frigid, damp night. 
Mike Flanagan, the major leagues' winningest pitcher with 23 victories during the regular season, rode the early edge to victory, holding off the Pirates, who built their at­tempted comeback around a record-tying Series four hits by big Dave Parker, and a key error by De Cinces, the first­inning hero. 
An eighth-inning home run by first baseman Willie Stargell brought the Pirates within one run. Flanagan survived a tough sixth inning that saw two Pittsburgh runs score with the help of errors by DeCinces·. Stargell also figured in the Pirates' first run in the fourth inning with a run-producing grounder. 
The Orioles started fast with 

leadoff man AI Bumbry dump­
ing a first-pitch single to left 
field against Pittsburgh starter 
Bruce Kison. Mark Belanger, 
who batted only .187 during the 
regular season, walked on four 
pitches. With Baltimore's 
power coming up, Kison was in 
trouble. 
He almost escaped by getting Ken Singleton to hit a come­backer, but in his anxiety to turn the double play, Kison bobbled the ball and had· to settle for getting the batter at first. Bumbry and Belanger advanced to second and third. 
Pittsburgh played its infield back, except at third base, hopping to choke off the big inning. And after cleanup man Eddie Murray walked on a 3-1 pitch, the strategy very nearly worked. 
] ohn Lowenstein ripped a perfect double play ball to second baseman Phil Garner. But Garner had trouble getting the baJl out of his glove, then threw it far over shortstop Tim Foli's head for an error. 
Two runs score on the play, and Murray wound up at third. Lowesntein almost reached second but changed his mind halfway down the base line, retreating to first, as Foli fumbled the relay and was unable to make a play. 
Rattled by the error, Kison then unloaded a wild pitch, allowing Murray to score the third run of the inning. The wild pitch came on Kison' s

Old heroes never die 


Theyjust change uniforms 
As he glanced to his right, he noticed the brillance of the Golden Dome. Yes, the statue of the Blessed Virgin was still there. . ..Send a volley cheer on high ... And oh yes, he'd tasted dining hall food, lived here in the 'Era of Ara' ' and upped a few at Corby's . ...Shake down the thunder from the sky ... Yes, it was all just as he left it. And now, he was back, on the other side. 
Would it be difficult to picture Vagas Ferguson in a Southern Cal uniform? God forbid! Or how about"Tree"Woolridge slam dunking it for U.C.L.A.? Makes you feel funny inside? 
Well, this past Saturday at Stepan Field, something similar took place. A star at Notre Dame in his respective club sport for six years, with 12 seasons of bleeding Notre Dame Irish blood. And now, as fate would have it, he was back a~ain, wearing the blue uniform on die other stde. 
The sport is rugby. The man is Bob 'Bobo' Olsen, 1974 Notre Dame alumnus, who is now captain of the South Bend Rugby Club. On Saturday morning, the townies, as they have been derogatorily referred to in campus circles, proved they can indeed serum with anyone. All they did was come to Notre Dame and run their record to 5-0 in capturing a 15-4 A-team victory, taking a page out of the "Breaking Away" movie script along the way. 
"I never thought I'd ever play against Notre Dame," said Olsen, who now works for IBM in South Bend after receiving his MBA from here in 1977. "I was so intense about Notre Dame Rugby when I was here. I used to see guys come back and play for other teams after going here and I never say how they could do it!" 
Olsen's enthusiasm for rugby, however, could not be curtailed. Upon graduation in 1977, he joined the South Bend Rugby Club, a team that had severed the Irish from their schedule because of bad blood between the two clubs. 
"Notre Dame had shellacked us 40-0 in 1975 and you could hear people making crude . remarks on the sidelines about how we should

Previte 


learn how to play rugby," said Shawn Donlon, a South Bend Rugger since that 1975 season, who scored a try in the first half Saturday. And learn they did. Picking up such players as Chet Zawalich, three-time Bengal Bouts champ and a former rugger at Notre Dame, the South Benders turned things around this season chalking up wins over Lincoln Park (Chicago), Gary, Indiana, Circle City and the Indy Reds. 
The game this weekend, however, was unusually clean, yet hard-fought (as evidenced by a broken hand and dislocated shoulder suffered by the South Bend side.)-Trys by Donlon, Phil Colburn and Doherty gave the Benders an early lead. ''It was rugby at its best," said Olsen. "The Irish were the fastest team we've faced all season. We just had the breaks go our way." 
And that they did. Despite a first half try by Matt O'Brien of Notre Dame, the visitors just managed to keep a dive by ] im Bowers and a corner attempt by O'Brien from touching the ground in the goal area as the game ended with no further scoring. "It was good for morale," chided Olsen, whose brother Tom, a senior, notched a try in an 18-0 Irish B-team victory. "We were glad they rescheduled us. They're a great bunch of guys and we enjoyed playing them." 
Notre Dame's ntw." crop of ru~gers were unaware of the ill-will felt from earlier rivalries so the game featured pure, unadulterated rugby. "We'll be at their game Saturday rooting them home against Xavier,'' smiled Donlon. Something tells this writer that Olsen would approve....And our hearts forever, love thee Notre Dame ... .
