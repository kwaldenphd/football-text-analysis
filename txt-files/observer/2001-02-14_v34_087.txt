down to just two tickets, last night's candi­
date forum focused mainly on a close exami­
nation of each ticket's platform goals. 
Ryan Becker and Nikki McCord faced 
opponents Brooke Norton and Brian 
Moscona in a two-hour debate with ques­

The debate came just one day after an 
election that saw service-oriented candidates 
Demetra Smith and Yogeld Andre come 
within 3 percent of passing Becker and 
McCord for the second runoff position. 
Smith/Andre received 20 percent while 
Becker/McCord garnered 23. 
Norton/Moscona gained 42 percent of the 
primary votes. 
With those results in mind, many of the 
questions centered on each ticket's commit­

"We want to serve students while allowing 
students to serve others," said Norton. "This 
election has shown that students are inter­
ested in social issues."

Many prospective students are awed by the crazed football fans. the Golden Dome or the sense of community that is sensed throughout campus, especially within res­idence halls. There might not be fraterni­ties or sororities at Notre Dame, but the dorms are pretty close to that -except that Valentine's Day ends at midnight here. 
According to DuLac, "visiting hours for guests of the opposite sex are not to begin before 10 a.m. on any day and are not to extend beyond 2 a.m." What might have seemed as a small detail during spring visitation affects the lives of every 5tudent on campus. 
"Yes. parietals have a larger effect on social life. I would have picked another school if I would have seen the effect it has on the social life," said Michelle Merlo, sophomore math and business major. 
Michelle's life at Notre Dame took a turn last semester when the fire alarm went off in 
Carroll at 
7:30 am while she was in her boyfriend's room. Their parietals case was taken directly to Residence Life.

For the most part, 10-15 minute viola­tions end with a warning while 30 minute violations or more go directly to ResLlfe, said Sister Adrienne Piennette, rector of Welsh Family Hall. 
Both Michelle and her boyfriend were not allowed to return to their dorm for the remainder of the fall semester in response to ResLife's decision. She was

Most people who break parietals make the same mistakes. 
"They leave early when they think everyone is asleep. Six o'clock might be early for them, but not for the rector," said Shoup. "A couple of times a year, roommates turn parietal cases in. Ninety­nine percent of the time a hall staff hears them talking in the room." 
Although Michelle's case did not involve alcohol, Shoup said most cases involve intoxicated friends. 
After a party, "some students might be too drunk to make a decent decision and drunk enough that they don't want to go back to their dorm-hall monitor,'' said Shoup. "When they're intoxicated, they're talking louder than they thought they were." 
Some students, however, say they enjoy parietals and others disagree so strongly that they move off campus, said Shoup. 
"Parietals quiet the dorm down for rest and study," said Piennette. The administration sees parietals as a three­

The punishment finalized by ResLife included off-campus housing for the remainder of the fall semester and resi­dence in a different dorm during the spring semester. She now lives in Walsh Hall. In May, her punishment from ResLife will be over, but she is still banned from Howard. 
Since Merlo missed her friends, she tried talking to Howard's rector, Sister Anne Dougherty, to move back next fall.

INSIDE COLUMN 


It's Valentine's 
Day 

I am tired of the cookies, the chocolate covered strawberries ala Martha Stewart, and the dozens upon dozens of roses. It does not seem romantic at all. The holiday has become a race to deter­mine who gives the 'biggest and most expensive gift. It is no longer about love but on how we can buy. 
According to the History Channel, which means I did not watch it but had some­one do it for me, St. Valentine was a dude who defied Emperor Claudius decree that no man could marry because it made him a bad soldier. St. Valentine would marry young couples in private. He may have been killed attempting to free Christians from the pris­ons where they were often tortured. Also, while he was in jail he fell in love with a young girl, might have been the jailer's daughter, and wrote her love letters that were addressed "From Your Valentine." 
The holiday was meant to remember St. Valentine. It was definitely not meant to shower each other with decorated pieces of paper and dead flowers. St. Valentine acted out oflove, not to empty his wallet on meaningless gifts oflittle or no sentimental value. 
Yet every year, since Kindergarten, I was told to bring Valentine cards to school. The last Valentine's card I gave out was seven years ago to a girl that I liked. I was promptly rejected afterward. 
It was not the rejection that made me this way. It was the constant reminder that on this one day, I am supposed to profess my love. But instead of finding love, I become aware of pain and of remorse the day after. 
How many of us know people who broke off their relationship on Valentine's? I know a few who would rather forget about this day. Poor souls, they get reminded about this dreadful day everywhere they look. 
The cost is another thing. This is a very expen­sive holiday. Between buying chocolates, roses (at a huge markup), and then dinner later that night. I am sure you can understand that some men would prefer to spend their money on some­thing more useful or something that will really impress their girlfriend. 
Here is an example: There is this guy, "Joe", he has a girlfriend, "Anne". but miles and miles of ocean separate both. Anne is in the U.S. and Joe is in Europe. Earlier this year, Anne, in Europe on business, surprised Joe by flying to see him on his birthday without him knowing. 
Sounds nice. huh? This is not the end of the story. Joe. wanting revenge, decided to do the same to Anne. Without anyone knowing. not even his closest friends, he flew for 18 hours across the Atlantic. He surprised Anne outside her door and both embraced. The surprise was so strong that she was in tears. He spent his money to surprise her. That is romantic. 
Guys, ifyou want to make your girl feel special on this day make something for her. Do some­thing for her that is of good character and always to make her feel special. Cook for her, try it, it is not so hard. Make her a card. Grow a plant for her. Whatever the gift, it will be better than store-bought cards and teddy bears. It does not take long to make and she will love you more for it.

Drug incidents skyrocket at U. Washington 
SEATTLE 

Arrests, citations and warnings for illegal drugs have increased by almost 900 percent since 1996 in the University of Washington resi­dence halls. 
Campus-wide, the combination of illegal drug arrests, citations and warnings has increased from 35 in 1996 to 200 in 2000. In the resi­dence halls alone, the number has increased from five to 49 in the same five years. 
Police records indicate most of the incidents involved marijuana rather than harder drugs. such as cocaine or LSD. 
Despite the consistent increase in drug incidents, Sgt. David Girtz said illegal drugs do not overly plague the UW. He attributes most of the

Biochemist makes AIDS discovery 
CINCINNATI 
Discovering a protein found within the AIDS infec­tion process does not have a concrete structure came as a surprise to a University of Cincinnati bio­chemist last month. "The region of this protein appears to be structurally flexible. That has astounded a lot of people." said Pearl Tsang, an assistant professor of chemistry for 10 years at UC. According to Tsang, there are two proteins which combine to make the virus. By understanding the binding process. AIDS researchers could stop the interaction, thus block infection. However, one pro­tein does not always bind the same way. The second protein changes its structure to fit many different proteins. The body of the second protein is not a concrete structure, which makes the infection process hard to pinpoint. These findings are crucial to the development of vaccines for AIDS. "We have to look elsewhere," said Tsang. "You can't design something to attack this."

The UWPD has officers monitor the residence halls. Girtz found that some officers were not spending as much time in the halls as she felt was necessary. 
"I have strongly encouraged offi­cers assigned to the residence halls to spend time in the halls. I want the dorm officers to know what is going on inside the dorms," said Girtz. 
Three or four years ago there was a policy change that may have con­tributed to the increased numbers. Resident advisors on each floor were instructed to call the police if they suspected drug use in the resi­dence halls.

McCain plugs finance reform plan 
EVANSTON.Ill. 
Continuing their six-year fight to pass bipartisan cam­paign finance reform legislation, Sens. John McCain and Russ Feingold brought their quest to Northwestern University on Monday, trying to drum up support from students and community members. About 375 people packed in for a question-and-answer session about the proposed McCain-Feingold bill. The bill is set to be heard before the Senate at the end of March. The bill would ban the soft money that corporations. special interest groups and wealthy individuals give political parties to finance campaigns. "We need to take govern­ment out of the hands of special interests and give it back to the people of this country," McCain said. "It's very difficult trying to do the Lord's work in the city of Satan, and we need your help." In past years, the bill has died on the Senate floor in a filibuster, which pro­\ longs debate in an attempt to kill the legislation. But McCain said he is confident he has the required 60 Senate votes to block a filibuster this year.

NSA resigns from Board of Trustees

"President Bush has surrounded himself with smart and powerful people. [Rice] has been friends with Bush for a while and he feels comfort­able with her," Lindley said. 
Since 1981, Rice has also been a member of Stanford University's political science fac­ulty, serving as the univer~ity's provost from 1993-99. 
Students at both schools can look to her as a positive example, Brown said. 
"Dr. Rice is a delightful person and an incredibly bright individ­ual. She has made several contri­butions to this country and will continue to do so. She is someone students can look to as a role model." Brown said. 
She previously served from 1989-91 in the administration of Bush's father as director and senior director ofSoviet and East European affairs in the National Security Council. Rice received an honorary doctorate of law from Notre Dame and delivered the 1995 commencement address.

Dame campus. An email that appeared to contain a picture of tennis star Anna Kournikova was instead a virus that spreads by sending itself to everyone in the address books of Microsoft Outlook email users. 
"It hit pretty hard," said Greg Matz, consultant analyst for Notre Dame's Office of Information Technologies. 
The rapidly spreading virus slowed the networks, but Notre Dame's email server did not crash as it did at many companies across the nation. The virus doesn't damage computers, but it causes problems because of the large volume of email that is generated as Microsoft Outlook spreads the virus. Other email programs do not automatically spread the virus. 
Users who had updated 
virus scan software since 
October did not experience 
problems. Notre Dame holds a 
site license for McAffe 
antivirus software. Every 
Wednesday, McAffe releases an updated version of the software. Matz recommends updating at least once a month. 
"Antivirus software works best as an inoculation," said Matz. "Ifs not like an antibi­otic that you take after you're infected." 
Saint Mary's was not trou­bled by the Kournikova virus. 
"I don't know of anyone's machine who's actually gotten infected from it," said Sally Goldberg, Saint Mary's net­work and systems administra­tor. 
According to Goldberg, Saint Mary's has installed a mail filter that will prevent the virus from getting on campus. All incoming and outgoing Saint Mary's email goes through a program called send mail. The pro­gram is configured to filter out specific subject lines, including that of the Kournikova virus. 
"It shouldn't be able to get 
on campus any more," said 
Goldberg.

Some however. feel parietal punishments cause a negative effect on the community. 
"Notre Dame's big thing is about community. [Merlo] was taken away from that for a semester -extending the pun ishment is really extreme now," said Emilie Robb, Merlo's friend and sophomore Howard resi dent. 
"Freshman year I loved this school and now I just think that rectors have too much control. There's no uniformity across the board, and it takes away from campus life," said Merlo. "It took away from my sophomore year."

Both tickets stressed the importance of getting stu­dents involved in student gov­ernment and increasing the communication between their offices and student body. 
Moscona suggested using emails to keep students informed, while McCord pro­posed sitting in on hall coun­cil meetings around campus to gather student input.

SEMINAR PRESENTATION: 
Exploring the effectiveness of environmental Impact assessment 
Speaker: Date: Time: Location:  Dr. Angus Neil Morrison-Saunders Guest Lecturer from Murdoch Univ,ersity WESTERN AUSTRALIA Wednesday,February14,2001 4:00 p.m. DeBartolo Hall, Room 217  
ABSTRACT  

Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a major tool promoted and used internationally for the protection and management of the environment. It was adopted in each ofthe conventions arising from the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. But how does the process operate in practice? Does EIA protect the environment? Is EIA based on good science? How do socio-economic and political factors affect the process? This seminar will present the major findings of research into the utility and effectiveness ofenvironmental impact assessment conducted by Dr. Angus Morrison-Saunders over the last ten years. 
Dr. Angus Morrison-Saunders is a Lecturer in Environmental Assessment. Division ofScience and Engineering at Murdoch University, Western Australia. He completed a Ph.D. in EIA at Murdoch University in 1997. From 1995-1999 he was a lecturer in the Environmental Studies Program at the University ofNotre Dame-Australia. He was coordinator ofEnvironmental Studies during 1998/99 and Academic Coordinator ofthe Notre Dame Study Abroad Program in 1999. Before commencing his Ph.D. in 1992, he worked in various positions including Environmental Office with local government, environmental consultant (which predominantly involved preparation ofEIA documents) and Graduate Research Assistant at Murdoch University.

When asked if she would let the student move back in, Piennette said, .., think I would because I think she learned from it. I think we learn from our mistakes. If she learned from her mistakes, then I would be willing to talk to the individ­ual, but it's particular to the individual." 
Shoup stresses that rectors have complete control whether students move hall to hall because rectors have to sign pull-in forms. When a student is forced out of his or her dorm, the rector decides whether to let him or her back in.

EL SALVADOR 


Associated Press 

EL SALVADOR 
A powerful earthquake shook El Salvador Tuesday, toppling hun dreds of buildings-and killing at least 127 people in a country still mourning more than 800 who died in an even stronger quake exactly one month ago. 
The quake flattened much of the heart of San Vicente, 35 miles east of San Salvador, and dam­aged most of the homes and buildings in four sur­rounding towns. 
At least 127 people were killed and more than 1,200 were injured, said Salvadoran Red Cross spokesman Carlos Lopez. He said there were numer­ous reports of landslides that could add to the death toll. 
The earthquake struck at 8:25 a.m. and was cen­tered halfway between San Vicente and San Salvador. The U.S. Geological Survey measured its magnitude at 6.6, a strong quake but not as devastating as the 7.6 magnitude temblor that killed at least 844 people last month. 
"It is true that this is another blow for El Salvador, but I call for tranquility. We have to be calm," President Francisco Flores told The Associated Press during a helicopter tour to assess the damage. 
"There are dead here,. and very many people have lost their houses," the president said during a stop in San Vicente. He said the brunt of the dam­age was in a corridor between Ilopango, just east of San Salvador, and San Vicente. 
Flores said he was told the quake damaged or destroyed hundreds of houses in the provinces of San Vicente, La Paz and Cuscatlan. Lopez said at least 71 people were killed in Cuscatlan alone. 
At least 12 adults and 
three children were killed in San Vicente, the region-· al army commander Col. Juan Armando Reyes, told Flores. He said half its houses were damaged, along with 90 percent of the houses in the nearby towns of San Cayetano, Guadalupe, Verapaz and Texistepeque. 
Landslides blocked sev­eral highways that were still being restored after the Jan. 13 quake, includ­ing the Panamerican Highway to Guatemala. Telephone service was patchy to much of the country. and San Salvador's airport also was briefly closed. 

Helicopter collision claims lives 
A»ociated Press 
HONOLULU 

Two Army Black Hawk heli­copters crashed in a remote area during a nighttime exercise, killing six soldiers on one of the aircraft and injuring 11 others. 
The aircraft "somehow came in contact" with each other, but it was still unclear whether they collided, Navy Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said Tuesday in a briefing at the Pentagon. 
The pilots of both aircraft were wearing night vision goggles. he 
said. Light rain was falling at the time. 
The helicopters, carrying a total of 17 people. crashed about 200 yards apart, said Capt. Stephen Johnson, whose fire company came from the nearby Sunset Beach sta­tion. 
Quigley said he had received con­flicting reports and was not certain how the two Black Hawks touched each other. He said it appeared they were not both in the air at the time. but did not elaborate. 
He said all six dead were aboard one helicopter. 
The two UH60 helicopters went down late Monday while participat­ing in an exercise over Kahuku on the island of Oahu, said Maj. Nancy Makowski, a spokeswoman for the 25th Infantry Division based at Schofield Barracks. 
"I heard a big thud," said Perry Dane, who lives on Kamehameha Highway about a mile from the crash site. "It sounded like thunder. It shook, too, like a big rattle." 
The accident came just three days after a Navy submarine crashed into a Japanese fishing trawler off the coast of Oahu.

Mendoza's $35 million donation ranks nationally 
Special to the Observer 
A $35-million gift to the University of Notre Dame from Thomas and Kathy Mendoza has been ranked the 24th largest in the nation last year, according to the annual Slate 60 survey compiled by 
the online magazine Slate and the Chronicle of Philanthropy. 
Bill and Melinda Gates, with a donation of $5 billion to their foundation, topped the survey, which ranks the 60 leading donors 


in America. The survey Mendoza 
began in 1996 at the suggestion of broad­casting entrepreneur Ted Turner. who 
hoped the publication of a prestigious list of donors would provide an incentive to giving. 
Announced March 21, the Mendozas' gift is the largest single donation in Notre Dame's history and is in support of the · University's business college, which has been named in the couple's honor. The Mendozas were among seven philan­thropists in the Slate 60 who contributed directly to college or university business schools. 
Thomas Mendoza, a 1973 Notre Dame graduate, is president of Network Appliance [NetApp]. a Sunnyvale, Calif., company that is the leading provider of network attached data access and man­age.men t solutions. Kathy Mendoza, a graduate of the University of Oklahoma, is president of worldwide strategic alliances for NetApp. 
Founded in 1921, the Mendoza College of Business is ranked by Forbes magazine as one of the nation's top 20 in giving MBA students the best return on their investment, and Business Week has rated the college's business ethics curriculum the best in American higher education. 
The college is Notre Dame's second largest with some 1,800 undergraduates, 780 advanced degree students {MBA, Executive MBA, master of accountancy, and master of science in administration) and 130 faculty. 
The college is divided into four depart­ments -accountancy, finance and busi­ness economics, management, and mar­keting -and also includes courses and concentrations in fields such as marketing and information systems, e-commerce, human resources, international business and management consulting. 
In addition, the college has developed six centers for scholarly research and teaching: the Center for Research in Banking, the Center for Research in Business, the Center for Ethics and Religious Values in Business, the Center for U.S.-Japanese Business Studies, the Eugene D. Fanning Center for Business Communication and the Gigot Center for Entrepreneurial Studies.

. ~ 
Special to the Observer 
The Notre Dame Award for interna­tional humanitarian service will be given to Andrea Riccardi, founder of the Comuunity of Sant'Egidio. Riccardi will receive the award at a ceremony on campus March 27. 
"Andrea Riccardi and his companions are truly evangelists of deed," said University president, Father Edward Malloy. "He and they preach the Gospel by living it, and by living it, they soften hearts the world had known to be hard­ened, resolve quarrels the world had known to be intractable, and win friends the world had known to be enemies. We are privileged to honor their witness." 
Riccardi is a professor of contempo­rary history at the Third University of Studies in Rome, where he teaches courses ~n modern church history. He has also taught at the Sapienza University and the University of Bari. He specializes in relationships among the world's religions and has written or edited several books. including "French Catholicism, Neo-Gallicanism and Bourgeois Catholicism"; "Rome from the Conciliation to the Sturzo Operation"; "The Roman Party after World War II"; "The Power of the Pope from Pius XII to John Paul II"; "The Mediterranean of the 20th Century"; "The Mediterranean: Christianity and Islam Between Cohabitation and Conflict"; and "A Century of Blood and Faith: Christians in 
the 20th Century." 

Riccardi is internationally known as the founder of the Sant'Egidio Community, whose mediation was instrumental in the 1992 agreement which brought a fragile peace to Mozambique after 16 years of civil war. The community. begun in 1968 by Riccardi and a few of 
his classmates from Rome's Virgilio High School, today has 40,000 members in 60 countries on four continents. 
Opposed to all forms of violence, whether legal or ille­gal, Sant'Egidio mem­bers have attempted to mediate and resolve conflict in Albania, Angola, Guatemala, Kosovo, Lebanon, Somala and, most recently, in Burundi. The commu­nity also has been active in recent international efforts to abolish capital punishment, gather­ing 2.7 million of the 
3.2 million signatures on a petition to that endwhich recently was presented to Kofi

Republicans expand Rich pardon investigation 
information on Rich in the final hours before the pardon. Adams said his staff had to perform an Internet search to gather more information. 
President Bush indicated Tuesday that he has little enthu­siasm for the investigations. 
"I think it's time to move on," he told reporters aboard Air Force One while flying back from . military exercises off the coast of Virginia. But he added that "Congress is going to do what it's going to do." 
Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle echoed Bush's first thought: "I think the time has come for us to move on." 
But Senate GOP Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., said, "With Mr. Rich I think the public is entitled to know what happened." 
The phrase -"It's time to move on"-is Bush's stock phrase for when he wants to avoid wading into controversies involving Clinton. Senior White House advisers. speaking on condition of anonymity, said not too much should be made of Bush's remark.

Pinochet's lawyers appeal indictments for kidnapping, homocide 
Associated Press 
SANTIAGO Lawyers for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet appealed his indictment on Tuesday. calling the homicide and kidnapping 
charges against him "arbitrary, illegal, and unconstitutional." 
Pinochet lawyer Pablo Rodriguez argued that there is no clear evi­dence that Pinochet was responsible for dozens of political killings during his 17-year rule. 
"I have analyzed 10 cases where he has been accused of participa­tion but none of them clearly shows he was responsible for these crimes," he said. 
In a hearing at the Santiago Court of Appeals, Rodriguez also argued that the 85-year-old Pinochet is not healthy enough to stand trial. 
Doctors last month said Pinochet suffers from ''moderate demen­tia" brought on by minor strokes. He also has diabetes and arthritis, and wears a pacemaker. 
Speaking with reporters after the hea~ing, pr~secuting attor?ey Eduardo Contreras challenged Rodriguez s assert10n that a medical report had found Pinochet unfit to stand further questioning in the case. "It's a lie," he said. 
Pinochet was placed under house arrest Jan. 29, after he was for­mally notified of the homicide and kidnapping charges filed two days earlier. 
The charges stem from the "Caravan of Death,'" one of the most notorious cases of human rights abuses during Pinochet's 1973-90 dictatorship. The caravan was a military group that executed 75 political prisoners shortly after the 197_3 coup led by Pinochet. The remains of 18 ofthe victims were never recovered.

Bush made his comments after Attorney General John Ashcroft said Monday he would be open to a proposal to grant Ms. Rich immunity in order to prod her to testify in the House investigation. 
Rich has lived in Switzerland since just before he was indicted in New York on federal charges in 1983. When pardoned by Clinton, he was wanted by the Justice Department on charges of tax evasion, fraud and partic­ipation in illegal oil deals with Iran. 
Ms. Rich has refused to answer questions from the House com­mittee about her donations. Republicans have said she gave at least $450,000 to the Clinton Presidential Library Fund and more than $1 million to the Democratic Party and Mrs. Clinton's campaign. 
The House panel sent a letter to the Secret Service asking for the Clinton White House entry logs for Ms. Rich and her family going back to 1993 and for Marc Rich's lawyer, former White House Counsel Jack Quinn, since January 1999. 

. President ·Bush suggests 'It's time to move on' 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

Republicans in Congress expanded their inquiry into for­mer President Clinton's eleventh-hour pardon of fugitive financier 
Marc Rich, even as President Bush sug­gested Tuesday "it's time to move on." 


T h e Clinton H o u s e Government Reform Committee 
asked the Secret Service for logs that would indicate how often Rich's supporters visited the White House before the pardon. The panel also issued its first subpoenas, including ones to Clinton's presidential library and for bank records of Rich's ex­wife Denise. 
Ms. Rich contributed an esti­mated $450,000 to the library, more than $1.1. million to the Democratic Party and at least $109,000 to Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign. 
, A Senate Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, planned to hold its first hearing Wednesday on Clinton's pardon. A senior mem­ber of the panel, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., has suggested the pardons might warrant a new impeachment effort against the former president or amending the Constitution to weaken the presidency's pardon authority. 

Specter said Justice Department pardon guidelines were ignored in the case and questioned whether all of the documents that supplemented the pardon were signed before Clinton's term ended at noon on Jan. 20. 
That perspective is supported by the Justice Department offi­cial in charge of reviewing par­don applications. 
U.S. Pardon Attorney Roger C. Adams plans to tell the commit­tee that "none of the regular procedures were followed," according to The Washington Post. In Adams' prepared testi­mony, which has been submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he says that the White House had virtually no

The cost of fuel that farmers need for tractors, combines and irrigation equipment jumped 31 percent last year. Prices may drop slightly in coming months, but growers are expected to be hit this year with a 33 percent increase in fertilizer costs, the report said. Nitrogen fertilizer is made from natural gas. 
"It's not only low prices, it's high production costs that are squeezing farmers,., said Bruce Babcock, an Iowa State University economist. 
Nebraska farmer Keith 
Dittrich said he expects to pay 
about $67 an acre to irrigate his 
corn this year, compared to $37 
an acre in 2000. Fertilizer costs 
are running $40 an acre, up 
from $25 last year. 
Meanwhile, the price of corn 

has averaged under $2 a bushel 
without a significant increase for 
several years. 
"You keep looking for ways to 

find better efficiencies in your 
operation, but there's a limit to 
that," Dittrich said. "It's to the 
point where there is no place to

Risk to global oil supply growing 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Global energy demand will grow sharply over the next two decades with continued reliance on Persian Gulf oil producers and an increased risk of supply interruptions, a panel of energy and global security experts warn. 
While there will be growing dependence between energy suppliers and consumers "the risks posed by supply interruptions will be great~r" between now and 2020 than they have been m recent years, the panel said in a study. 
Despite recent price and supply shocks, world consumers of energy, including U.S. policy-mak­ers, have been too complacent about "the fragility of reliable and timely (energy) sup­plies," the report said. . The result of a three-year world energy pro­Ject by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the report was worked on by a task force of private and public-sector energy and global security experts headed by former Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia and James Schlesinger, former ~nergy and defense secretary in the Carter, Nixon and Ford administrations. 
The report, was being released Wednesday by Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, who has ar~ued that global instability requires the United States to reduce its reliance on oil imports. 
By 2020. half of all the petroleum used by the world "will be met from countries that pose a high risk of internal instability," the study said, predicting that a crisis, perhaps even military conflict, is "highly likely" in one or more of the world's key energy producing countries. 
Furthermore, it said that Iran, Iraq and Libya, ea~h of which are under sanctions by either the Umted States or United Nations, are likely to "play an increasingly important role in meeting growing global (energy) demand." 
While not commenting specifically on any of 
the three countries, the task force urged U.S.

policy-makers to "avoid the indiscriminate use of sanctions," saying they are "not an effective ~olicy tool" and hinder needed energy produc­t10n. 
. The stu~y. however, did not focus on the ques­t10n of imports vs. domestic production althou_gh_ it predicted in the coming years "U.S'. net oil imports will continue their steady growth." 
. Instead, it urges a series of policy directions aimed at developing closer ties to leading global oil prod~cers and warns that only the United States will be able to ensure the continued flow of energy supplies. 
The study questioned whether the United States, with its current commitments in north­eastern Asia, will be able to respond militarily to an energy crisis in the Middle East such as it did in the 1990 Gulf War. · 
Among other task force findings are that over the next 20 years: 
-World energy demand will increase by 50 percent and at some point developing countries, led by China. will begin to consume more energy than the developed countries. 
.Th~ 
Persian Gulf will remain the key supplier of 011 to world markets with its production expected to expand by 80 percent, but only with the help of foreign investment. 

. 
Electr~city will be the most rapidly growing sector with the greatest increase in Asia and Central and South America. 

. 
Technologies must be found and developed to make use of fossil fuels environmentally friendly and still economical. 

. 
There will be an increased threat of terr.orist attacks on oil and gas pipelines. 


"One of the ironies at the turn of the century," concludes the study, "is that in an age when the pace of technological change is almost over­wh~lming, the world will remain dependent, durmg 2000-2020 at least, essentially on the same sources of energy -fossil fuels -that prevailed in the 20th century."

'Gladiator' leads Oscar field 
Associated Press 
BEVERLY HILL.5, Calif. 

Hollywood's resurrection of Rome marches on: "Gladiator," the glitzy successor to "Ben­Hur" and "Spartacus," led the Oscar field Tuesday with 12 nominations, including best pic­ture, actor and director. 
Another tale of ancient war­riors, the Mandarin-language "Crouching Tiger. Hidden Dragon," was next with 10 ­picture, director and foreign­language film among them. 
Also receiving best picture nominations were the candy­shop romance "Chocolat," the legal drama "Erin Brockovich" and the drug-trade saga "Traffic." 
Steven Soderbergh grabbed two of the five best-director slots, for "Erin Brockovich" and "Traffic" -which could hurt his chances of winning if the two films siphon votes from each other. The last time a director was nominated twice in the same year was Michael Curtiz in 1938, for "Angels with Dirty Faces" and "Four Daughters." (He lost.) 
The other director nominees Tuesday were Stephen Daldry for "Billy Elliot," Ang Lee for "Crouching Tiger" and Ridley Scott for "Gladiator." 
"Gladiator," the first Roman spectacle since the 1960s, also grabbed nominations for actor Russell Crowe, supporting actor Joaquin Phoenix and Hans Zimmer's score. The computer wizardry used to recreate ancient Rome was named for "There's much of Rome that visual effects. feels very contemporary," Wick

In their heyday. gladiator flicks fared well at the Oscars. "Ben-Hur" won best picture and 10 other Academy Awards in 1959. (Its total of 11 is tied with "Titanic" for the most ever.} A year later, Peter Ustinov took the supporting­actor statue for "Spartacus," which also won Oscars for cos­tumes, sets and cinematogra­phy. "Cleopatra" had a best-pic­ture nomination for 1963 and won four technical Oscars. 
On top of its stunning visuals, "Gladiator" caught on because the frenzy of deadly spectator sports resonated with audi­ences, said Douglas Wick, another of its producers. 

"Crouching Tiger" is only the third film to earn both best-picture and for­eign-language film nomina­tions. The others were "Life Is Beautiful" in 1998 and "Z" in 1969. Last weekend, "Crouching Tiger" hit $60 mil­lion, passing "Life is Beautiful" as the domestic box-office champ among foreign-language films. 
Top categories shaped up largely as expected, but there were a few surprises. Ed Harris was nominated for best actor and Marcia Gay Harden for supporting actress for "Pollock," a film biography of painter Jackson Pollock that generally had been overlooked for earlier movie honors.

our coun­try." 
"It would be easy to continue to be angry about the way last year's election was decided," said the Connecticut senator who was the Democratic vice presidential nominee last year. "But that would be an abdication of the values and programs in which we believe and a disservice to the mil­lions of hard-working families for whom we waged that cam­paign." 
Lieberman told those attend­ing the winter dinner of the New Democrats Network that the centrist Democrats in their group will play a vital role in setting the national agenda because of the closely divided House and Senate. 
The New Democrat Network honored Lieberman, one of the founders of the political action group that raises money and recruits candidates to run on the centrist ideas of the New Democrat movement. The movement was founded in the mid-1980s to move the party toward the center and regain the White House. Former President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, the unsuc­cessful presidential candidate, used many of those ideas to run for the White House in 1992. 
"Over the past decade, the New Democrat movement has grown from a rump faction to the mainstream of the Democratic Party," he told the crowd that included members of Congress. party activists and political consultants who attended the dinner and fund­raiser, that raised $1.2 mil­lion. "I need not remind you that the past three Democratic presidential tickets have been thoroughly New Democratic 
ones, and all three  won  the  
most votes."  
Rep.  Harold  Ford  of  

Tennessee said in the closely divided Congress "if any legis­lation is going to get done, New Democrats will have to help get it done." 
Simon Rosenberg, president of the New Democrat Network, called Tuesday "a big night for New Democrats in Congress." The New Democrat Network was founded in 1996 by Lieberman, Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana and Rosenberg.

Navy to use robots to examine fishing boat sinking 
 Remotely-operated'Deep Drone' may aid recovery operation 
Associated Press 
HONOLULU 

The Navy will use a deep-sea robot to investigate the ocean floor where a Japanese fishing vessel sank after it was struck by a U.S. submarine, a Navy spokeswoman said Monday. 
Lt. Col. Christy Samuels, spokeswoman for the U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii, said no decision about a sal­vage operation had been made. 
She did not say when the .remote-controlled submersible would be dropped. 
The remotely operated vehi­cle Scorpio [I and the Klein 2000 Side Scan Sonar System were flown to Hawaii on Monday night from a Navy base in Coronado, Calif., the Navy said in a news release. 
And being flown to Hawaii from the mainland is "Deep Drone." a remotely operated vehicle "designed to meet the needs for deep ocean recov­ery," the news release said, indicating the Navy may be preparing a recovery opera­tion. 
The possibility of a salvage operation -which has been urged by the Japanese -was the subject of a meeting planned Monday between Adm. Dennis Blair, comman­der of the U.S. Pacific Command, and Yoshitaka Sakurada, Japan's parlia­mentary secretary for foreign affairs. 
The Ehime Maru went down in 1,800 feet of water nine miles from Honolulu on Friday after it was hit by the surfacing USS Greeneville. Twenty-six people were res­cued, but nine are missing and feared dead. 
The Navy and Coast Guard have searched more than 5,000 square miles with no signs of the missing. who include four Japanese stu­dents, two instructors and three crewman. 
Anguished relatives have urged the Navy to conduct a salvage operation and Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori has said rescuers should use "all available means" to raise the vessel. 
The Ehime Maru is 180 feet long and 499 tons. Bringing it nearly one-third of a mile to the surface would be costly and risky, experts said. 
"It's a salvage operation that I think is unrealistic," said Charles Vick of the Federation of American Scientists in 

Sonar 
Sonar, which is sound navigation and ranging, is used to detect objects in the water. 
Active sonar produces a ping, or sound wave, which travels to another object, · . ~J>ffitanQ returna to th&~-.·:

Washington. "I know it's hard to say that to people." 
Others said risks and expense will be weighed against a strong interest in avoiding damage to U.S~ rela­tions with Japan. 
"The pressure is on us very. very strongly to do something along this line," said John Craven, a professor of ocean studies at the University of Hawaii who helped develop the Navy's deep-submergence pro­gram. 
Craven said he could not recall the raising of an entire boat the size of the Ehime Maru from a similar depth. He said the Navy must first deter­mine whether the ocean floor at the site is sandy or muddy and whether the vessel has broken apart. 
Sonar and Surfacing: How· a submarine works 
Asubmarine dives by filling its ballast tanks with water to make it heavier, causing it to submerge. To surface again, compressed air pushes water out of the tanks, making the vessel lighter so it rises.

If it is relatively intact, Craven said, "lift bags" could be attached and inflated, rais­ing the ship. 
But the depth at the site would pose a huge challenge. 
"Can divers operate freely in the water at 2,000 feet?" Craven asked. "The answer is probably not," meaning the Navy would have to rely on remotely controlled robots.

GUEST COLUMN 
Democracy needs party variety 
OXFORD. Miss. 

In a 1996 Halloween episode of The Simpsons, Homer discovers that Bill Clinton and Bob Dole have been replaced by shapeshifting aliens plotting to take overthe world when whichever of them is elected. Homer reveals their sinis­Mark Rogers ter plan to the world just before the election so that Daily no one will vote for

them, but the aliens laugh it off, saying, "Puny Earthlings! What can you do? It's a two­party system! Bwaaahaha!" 
I'm sure Ross Perot and Ralph Nader thought it was hilarious. 
The truth is that for a country which prides itself on having fostered the mod­ern notion of democracy, America has a funny way ofshowing it. Rarely, ifever, has a third-party candidate seriously threatened to win a national election, condemned instead to play the role of spoiler. Perot was a brash candidate whose unprecedented level of support challenged many notions ofgrass-roots efforts in modern politics, but as soon as the election was over he was forced to assume the mantle of "that guy who cost Bush the election." 
Perhaps it was Perot's strong showing among otherwise conservative voters that cost Bush his lead. Perhaps it was Bush's inability to articulate a clear domestic agenda. Regardless, the fact remains that the role of spoiler continues to be the only achievement possible for candidates who do not wish to embrace the platforms of the two major parties. 
This is or should be almost inconceiv­able for a country heralded as the world's defender of freedom. Many of the foreign nations whose governments have been remolded in America's image over the past century now reveal a freer, 
LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
What are your clothes saying? 
Skintight red tube top, short tight black miniskirt. Figure clearly revealed; little left to the imagination. 
Who am I describing? A typical Notre Dame girl on her way to a bar or a dorm party? Yes and no. 
Yes, this description fits many of my Notre Dame sisters on their way to a social event. Unfortunately it also describes one ofthe prostitutes among the crowd of "sinner" characters dur­ing this past weekend's performance of Guys and Dolls in Washington Hall. What does it say when everyone's favorite Friday night fashion is adopted as the costume for a prosti­tute? 
Some may argue that it doesn't say anything, that the girls who go out in these tight clothes simply think they look "pret­ty" in them. But like it or not these clothes make a statement and that statement is not "Let's have an intelligent and enjoy­able conversation possibly leading to a healthy friendship or romance." You can figure out for yourself what these clothes are saying -and I don't think the majority of my fellow Notre Dame girls want to be saying it. 
I don't think they truly want a guy to talk to them just more open political process than the one here that they are trying to mimic. 
The idea of a two-party system is unthinkable in places like Japan, where their political spectrum has been frag­mented into so many different flavors that more than a dozen different parties now fight for small percentages of repre­sentation like dogs at a butcher shop. In a land where the public's choices for political parties are widely varied, a clear majority is virtually impossible. 
The result is a defacto system of com­promise and coalition in which like­minded politicians from competing par­ties choose to ally themselves on particu­lar issues or against particular foes and in which the slightest disagreement between partners can bring a shaky coalition government to its knees. 
We could learn a thing or two here. A political system which has many compet­ing choices becomes by default the gov­ernmental equivalent of Kroger, a buyer's market in which political parties must seriously sell their product, a plat­form of ideals and proposals, to a skepti­cal and flighty public. 
Besides, the idea of a mini-mall politi­cal arena fits in snugly with one of the great unspoken truths about Americans: that for all of our vaunted progressive ideas we are often surprisingly conserva­tive and slow-moving. It took a century to remove slavery from the last bit of American soil, another to bring about real changes in civil rights and may take yet another to erase the vestiges of prej­udice still lingering in our national dis­course. 
Like the Roman Empire before it, America's progression from a forested land of "every man for himself' to a modernized nation with its large, heavi­ly-taxing protective government has been more like a glacier than a rapid river. A multi-party system plays right into this innate hesitancy. 
because they look sexy. I don't think they want a relationship to start based on the allure of skintight clothes. I think deep down we all want a guy to be attracted to us because of our intelligence, humor, integrity, loyalty and kindness. Not because of our cleavage. 
Girls, take a look in the mirror this weekend and ask your­self honestly what your outfit is saying. There's nothing wrong with looking attractive as long as you are still respecting your body instead of flaunting it. Do your clothes say "I respect myself and am proud to look so nice" or do they say "I want to seduce you"? 
Do you really want to say that? 
Do you think it's right to say that? 
Are you prepared for the answer? 
Sheila Payne 
sophomore Cavanaugh Hall February 13. 2001 
Don't like sudden swings in the tax brackets, in either direction? Try coordi­nating five competing coalition partners into a budget deal. 
Tired of the influence of the so-called special-interest money on governmental decisions? Try a system in which no one party controls the majority and by exten­sion the purse strings. 
Upset at how close the 2000 election was or convinced that the party with slightly fewer votes in the key state won the whole state? Try a system in which no one is the president until a majority coalition is in place, in which the recent trend of plurality-takes-all would be halted. 
Think about this cold reality: a majori­ty of the American voting public did not vote for George W. Bush. A majority of the American voting public did not vote for Al Gore. In fact, no candidate since 1988 has received a majority of the pop­ular vote. 
What we have is two parties so closely tied among the vast political center that they cannot achieve a majority, but so locked in mortal combat with each other that they cannot see the serious damage being done to the government for which they claim to be servants. 
In a country which forced the two top non-majority candidates to learn to work together (since a runoff system would simply perpetuate the mistakes of today), we would take the word "mandate" much more seriously. Then you would start to see some real change.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Students promote chaste lifestyle 
This letter, like many of those printed in this newspaper, is aimed at raising stu­dent awareness to a topic that is of inter­est to the student body. Particularly, this letter is concerning the week of Feb. 12­16, which has been named National Chastity Week by many organizations around the country. Several students have been involved with a group called the National Chastity Task.force. These students will be working to bring aware­ness of the topic to our campus during this week. 
We feel that chastity is a topic ihat, as far as intelligent dialogue between stu­dents goes, has been very neglected. In today's society chaste relationships which attempt to use sexuality to promote unity and love among all people is very difficult. It necessarily follows that even talking about the topic has become very stigma­tized. It seems that fifty years ago it would be unheard ofto hear the word "sex" thrown around on every episode of a sit­com, yet in today's programming it is almost impossible to find even a show that depicts single men and women keep­ing their bodies pure. 
Here at Notre Dame many wish to look at our raw numbers of how many and how often people are having sex or doing other impure actions in reassurance that we as a university are doing great com­pared to the big state schools which have co-ed dorms and no parietals. 
However, chastity is not just an action but an attitude and a way of life. It is true that there are many people on campus who are not sexually active, which is very good, but we all know there is room for improvement. 
No one would seriously debate that to have a good relationship there should be true love. The debate often comes when defining both true love and how that love should be expressed. 
Is having sex with many people before marriage a good way to love your future spouse? You could say "honey, they didn't mean anything to me," but then how would she know that sex with her means 
anything? Ifthey did mean something to you then how will you be truly united to her? It seems this can only lead to prob­lems both with the marriage and within the unchaste person. 
Now the high divorce rate surely cannot be totally blamed on the high "unchastity rates" in our nation, but anyone who has had sex could tell you that it is not just the physical feelings. From a theological viewpoint, sex was made for its uniting and procreative aspects not solely as a means to have good sensations. Sex with­out relationship is lacking so much in its potential, like a star athlete that decides to drop out of school and sell drugs as opposed to going to the pros. It is a waste and it is destructive. 
As an attitude, chastity shouldn't even stop with marriage. Married couples still should be chaste both by refraining from extra-marital sex and by remembering to treat each other as people and not just objects of sexual pleasure. 
This week, the nation's chastity organi­zations would love to change the world overnight to an Earth that respects all its inhabitants and all of their bodies. Realistically however, they wish only to stir dialogue and awareness, as do many other "National Weeks." 
It is very important, however, that we at Notre Dame set an example for Catholic campuses and universities all over the world. If we are too closed minded to / examine our own views ofsex while images of the ultimately chaste humans, Jesus and Mary, are all around us, then we are not saying much for the hope of the world.

Practicing ideals without double standards 
"What does it really mean to be human? What does it mean to practice democratic ideals?" These were just a couple questions that Dr. Cornel West asked his audience in DeBartolo Hall a few weeks ago. 
In light of recent circumstances on campus, I think these are two questions that we as students and mem­bers of a larger human community need to ask our­selves. 
On Friday I sat in the hallway of LeMans Hall and watched as many students signed and while some passed by and refused to sign a petition in support of free speech. Ask yourselves the two questions posed by Dr. West and then explain to me why people flatly refused to sign such a petition. 
Granted this "sit-in" and petition were arranged in reaction to the prohibition of "The Vagina Monologues" on campus, but free speech is free speech and if we don't support that, what does that say about our definition of humanity or democracy? 
The most disturbing part of the sit-in was watching the Saint Mary's student body vice-president elect pass by and hostilely refuse to sign this petition. The student body president elect also refrained from signing. That makes me worry about the future of Saint Mary's College. 
A member ofthe Parent's Council, who allegedly played a role in censoring the monologues, also passed through. One man, the father of a Saint Mary's student, stopped and read the petition. He looked interested and seemed excited to see students taking action. He asked which theatrical presentation had been censored, and when he heard the word "vagina" he rudely shoved the petition back into the student's hand and walked away. arm in arm with his wife, who said nothing. 
Anyone who has been in a minority group knows the importance of naming and defining oneself. If we don't define ourselves, someone else will. Instead of allowing the presentation of "The Vagina Monologues" and talk­ing about our sexuality, women's sexuality, we are silenced and therefore remain passive. 
Instead of holding this event to embrace the many beautiful aspects of women's sexuality, we let the Keenan Review take place on this very campus and in a way define our sexuality for us. In essence we let a group of post-adolescent males define our sexuality with age­old negative stereotypes. I went to the Keenan Review my freshman year and I laughed nervously at the jokes that stereotypically defined Saint Mary's women as sexu­al objects, Notre Dame women as ugly and therefore not important and Zahm Hall men as gay and therefore abnormal. 
So in one event the men -or maybe I should say boys -of Keenan Hall define two sets of women and gay peo­ple according to their idea ofsexuality as centered on the white male heterosexual. I remember the joke about BP and all the girls being fat. I also remember one of my dearest friends who lived in that dorm dealing with eat­ing disorders. Someone please explain to me how perpet­uating harmful stereotypes is contributing to the well being of humanity or democracy. 
I know the response to my ideas presented here. People will tell me to lighten up because these are all just jokes. Well, in my opinion, these jokes are harmful. 
However, being a proponent of free speech, I would never say the boys of Keenan Hall should not be allowed to perform their show but in my opinion it should not take place on the Saint Mary's College campus. 
Sadly, I read in the paper today the article in which the Saint Mary's Board of Governance gave the following rea­sons to keep the Keenan Revue on campus: the Revue brings Notre Dame students to our campus; we should try to promote good campus relations: not allow­ing the Revue at Saint Mary's would make us look "bitchy;" and we should keep it in the "spirit of goodwill." 
I will not promote something in the "spirit of goodwill" which promotes stereotypes 
V, 'l. 

of me or any other 
Saint Mary's woman as stupid or slutty, which is exactly what the revue does. I am really disappointed in the students of Saint 
Mary's. Open your eyes and see what's really going on. 
At the beginning of this academic school year I was in my boyfriend's dorm room. We heard banging on the wall and when we opened the door, the freshmen in his section had written on it the words, "Yeah, get some from the SMC chic." School had only been in session for less than a month and these poor little freshmen's minds had already been corrupted with these harmful stereo­types which are then reinforced a semes­ter later in the Keenan Review. I was highly offended that a few freshmen thought they had the right and audacity to talk about my sexuality in that way, without so much as ever having met me. I am a senior at Saint Mary's and I am really tired of dealing with inci dents such as these. These stereotypes are used quite often to divide the women of Saint Mary's and Notre Dame. 
Perhaps it is time for the women of both campuses to unite and reject these male imposed labels. As for all the women and men of these two campuses who will dis­agree will me, maybe you have bought into "the system." It's a shame that we internalize such repressive "tradi­tions" to the degree that it is acceptable for men to talk about and make fun of women's sexuality, but it is con­sidered "shocking" (to quote a Saint Mary's student) for women to talk about our own. 
On Friday at the sit-in I sat next to a Notre Dame woman who decided to take the bus over by her­self to unite with Saint Mary's students and stand up for free speech and the validity of "The Vagina Monologues." Across from me sat another Notre Dame woman who is a first year law student and also wished to exercise her con­cern over the repression of free­dom ofspeech. Three cheers for them. The women ofSaint Mary's and Notre Dame who attend­
ed the sit-in took the first step together. Let's all come together and ask 
questions about humanity and democracy so that we can make these campus­es, this country and this 
world a better place, not a divided one where repressive stereotypes shape our view of the world, without us even being aware of it. 
To me it seems clear that these issues are relat­ed and should be dis­
cussed in context of one 
tJQ. 

another. It~m jubst posingI some ques 10ns ecause think it is important to look at these events like the cen­sorship of ..The Vagina Monologues" and the thought­less support for the Keenan Review in order to examine how 
they affect people in these commu­nities. I found Dr. West's ideas to be quite 
enlightening and I think we could all bene­fit from asking ourselves the two basic ques­
tions he proposed. "What does it really mean to be human?" "What does it mean to practice democratic ideals seriously?" 
Focusing on answering these two questions, maybe we can put recent circumstances into a broader perspective and understand the deeper issues involved.

To commit or not: holiday sparks the tough questions 
It is upon us again. The candy, the carnations and the senti­mental cards. Valentine's Day has arrived in South Bend -the perpetual holiday of loving, yearning and overall melancholy. 
However. on this national day of affection and affliction, one question remains to be asked: has monogamy become the exception rather than the rule? 
We are in college. We are supposed to date. A lot. We are supposed to be charm­ing. articulate and potential mates to everyone we meet. Quite frankly, it's exhausting. 
But in the hazy days of break-ups. make-ups an.d random hook-ups. people don't seem to be looking for commitment. We seem to be on the lookout for quite the opposite -something short, sweet and convenient. 
Even while in relationships, we con­stantly second guess ourselves, wonder­ing if we're doing the right thing, if we really want commitment. 
We look over our shoulders, asking our­selves if there might be something better out there, something more. Basically, we're so busy seeking eligibility that we don't have the time for fidelity. 
Can there possibly be one person out there with whom we can happily share the rest of our lives, or at least until spring break? Do we even want to? 
With the possibilities brought on by dimly lit bar scenes and 

Natural Light at our fingertips. has monogamy become a rare 
and exceptional thing? Glancing in the door of a typical dorm 
party or two, it certainly seems to be. the case -with the 
exception of one sugary, candy-coated day in February.. 
Welcome to Valentine's Day: the most celebrated, lummous 

and glossy promotion of commitment we have to offer. This is 
the day when we all want someone, anyone to adore us. . 
The once happily eligibles, the ones who scoffed at commit­

ment, suddenly feel the need to have someone of the opposite 
sex in their life. Those already in committed relationships stop 
wondering if monogamy is worth it, and suddenly are perfectly 
happy to be in a relationship. 
As a result, the holiday isn't only a skyrocketing day for 

Hallmark stock options, but the one day of the year when 
monogamy and commitment are commended. 
However once the chocolates are eaten, the flowers wilted 

and the ca~ds recycled, are we any further along? It's almost 
as if we have to have our sexuality validated with a couple of 
Hershey Kisses. 
This is hardly the case. The happily single shouldn't let a day 

change their perspective on the dating scene. It is, after all, 
just another holiday (like Arb?r Day, but with candy.) . 
We complain that Valentine s Day makes us feel more sm­

gle," but so what? Being single is hardly a life-threatening 
condition -it's more of an opportunity than anything else. 
You have the freedom to meet people, get to know them and, 

if you like, date them. It can be short, s~eet_an~ convenient, 
or something more. The beauty of the s1tuat10n 1s that you can 
choose your own path with limited consequences. 
For the committed, Valentine's Day shouldn't be the only day 

you're sure of your relationship. It is certai:11Y easy to do~bt 
yourself, questioning if you've chosen t?~ ~ight path_. and 1f a 
relationship is right for you. However, if 1t s somethmg that, 
you both want, your hesitancy will all but disappear. 
You don't need to rely on a holiday to verify your feelings. 

It's true that finding commitment may be an exceptional thing 
these days. But when you're with the right person, every day 
can be a holiday. 
We can all celebrate Valentine's Day. Whether we're com­
mitted or single, the day will come and go relatively quickly. 
We'll continue down our respective paths, meeting and dating 
people along the way. 
We will still have our own philosophies on love and dating ­
a holiday shouldn't change that. As long as we keep looking 
for more than what we have, maybe monogamy and commit­
ment are too much to ask. However, if that something more, or 
someone right, comes along, they won't be.

Valentine's lovers and 
By LAURA KELLY 
Associate Scene Editor 

For those lucky lovebirds who have someone special in their life, the question of how to spend this Valentine's Day looms large. New couples puzzle over how to surprise each other, while those in serious relationships rely on tried-and-true ways to express their love. 
No matter how young or how weathered the relationship, there are always creative ways to spend the holiday, often without spending much money or doing extensive planning. 
Thus, here are the top 10 ways to spend Valentine's Day when you have a significant other: 
10. Go out to dinner. The classic romantic fall-back: soft candlelight, gentle music and the two of you slurping on spaghetti a la "Lady and the Tramp." Taking that special someone in your life out for an elegant meal is always a sure way to win brownie points and show off your good taste. 
Try Italian or French cuisine for this holiday of love, as the Europeans are notorious Casanovas. Many area resiaurants offer Valentine's Day specials, but be sure to call ahead for reservations as you don't want your plans of wining and dining to fall through at the last moment. 
9. Cook dinner. For those who are a little low in the funds department and are looking for other creative ways to treat the ones they love, try cooking your own meal. No excuses here ­you can flex many of the ingredients for a gourmet meal at the good ol' Huddle, and dorm kitchens are available everywhere. 
Find a good cookbook. whip up something quick and easy and your love is sure to be impressed. This goes for both genders -food may be the way to a man's heart, but any woman will also be swept off her feet by her man's attempts to cook. If you don't have the time to devote to a full meal. go for the classic 
SYR batch of cookies or brownies. The thought is what counts. 
8. Spend a night at the movies. 
Hollywood has once again attempted to provide some d e c e n t Valentine's fare for lovebirds across America. South Bend 's own Showplace 16 and Movies 14 are offering several holiday­a ppr op r i ate flicks.

10. 'Ghost": You, the one you love and a potter's wheel -the night is covered (in clay at least.) 
9. "Notting Hill": She's just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her. And-he probably won't say no because she's Julia Roberts. 
8. "Sixteen Candles": Every girl deserves her own Jake Ryan. 
7. "Shakespeare In Love": He wrote about it, he lived it, and despite recent attacks on his sexuality, the man knows about romance. 
6. "Beauty and the Beast": You'll never complain about your boyfriend's personal hygiene again. 
5. "Love Story": Love means never having to say you're sorry, at least if you're a wealthy Harvard Law grad. 
4: "Untamed Heart": He gave her everything, even his heart. What did you get your heartthrob this year? 
3. "Far and Away": If they can make it on the wild frontier. you can make it at Notre Dame. 
2. "When Harry Met Sally": Yes, yes, yes! 
t. "An Affair to Remember": You might not be able to meet your sweetheart at the top of the Empire ~tate building, but at least consider Flanner Hall as a viable alternative. Remember to look both ways before cross­ing Juniper. though.

A smaller­scale surprise is easy to scheme up if you or a good friend can sing or have any portable musi­cal talent (pianos are dif­ficult to push 
across  the  
quad).  The  
classic  sere­ 

nade to a bed­room window has melted many a heart, and is sure not to fail, even if the eager war­bler is slightly tone-deaf. 
4. Go for a walk. While 
If you are up for a good scare or just ~ant your girl to leap into your arms with fright, check out the aptly named "Valentine" to see some holiday horror. And i~your r~lationship ~s well along in years and you re lookmg to take 1t to the next level. "The Wedding Planner" may be a way to subtly broach the subject. 
7. Play for a day. Everyone misses the care­free days of the playground, especially those of us buried under piles of homework and the stresses of school. Why not spend this Valentine's Day the way you would have in third grade? Take your boyfriend or girlfriend on a trip back in time. 
Find a local playground, race on the monkey bars and try to swing the highest. Indulge your inner six year-old and visit Chuck E Cheese ­play skee-ball and take a jump in the ball pit. 


Lace up a pair of roller or ice skates and hold hands during the Snowball Ska,te. Laugh at how you would have teased each other if you had gone to grade school together. 
6. Take a day · trip. Two destina­tions within rea­sonable travel dis­tance are Chicago and the Indiana or Michigan dunes. 
The South Shore provides regular and affordable service to down­town Chicago, where you can see a show or just window shop down Michigan Avenue. 
While Feb. 14 may not provide perfect beach weather, two love­
birds  can  still  
stroll  down  Matthew McConaughey andthe perfect V1 
beach  or  Wedding Planner," asit and  

watch the waves roll in. A quick romantic getaway might just be worth skipping a day of classes. 
5. Surprise! Whether or not they will admit it, almost everyone loves to be surprised. And holidays like Valentine's provide perfect oppor­tunities to catch that certain someone off guard. Several local companies provide singing telegrams. a public embarrassment perfect for the dining hall or a large Debartolo classroom. For those who like to splurge, the Aerial Ads 

South Bend may be lacking sandy beaches to amble down, there's nothing simpler or more romantic than a long walk together. When was the last time you strolled around the lake and just talked (or maybe more importantly, lis­tened)? For those who are itching to get off campus, borrow a car, pop in a good CD and go for a long drive. Indiana's endless stretches of 
cornfields are perfect to get lost in. 
3. Indulge your laziness. Everyone needs a day off during the dreary winter months. Why not play hooky with your favorite partner in crime? Call in sick to work, e-mail your profes­sors with lame excuses and spend a lazy day relaxing. Go to the dining hall in your pajamas and share a big breakfast. 
Rent a stack of movies from Block-buster or Hollywood and curl up on the couch. Most of

lters can both enjoy day 
9. Count your blessings. Even if you don't technically have a girlfriend or boyfriend, you still have many things going for you on this hol­iday. Family, friends, a top-rate education, a sense of humor. Take some time to think about how much you really have. Flowers eventually die and chocolate gives you a stomach ache, anyway. 
8. Redo something. Channel that Valentine's aggression into a creative outlet. Crank up some angry music, tear everything off your walls and redecorate the entire room. Give yourself a makeover. Vent through poetry or compose an angst-full song and send it off to Alanis. 
7. Splurge. Don't wait around for someone to buy you dinner or diamonds. Throw caution to the wind and buy the new outfit you've been eyeing or the CD you can't live without. Or, for the less adventurous, go on a Reckers or BK shopping spree and treat yourself to all the wonders flex points can buy. 
6. Volunteer. Spend the afternoon at a home­less shelter or soup kitchen and suddenly the lack of roses on your desk will seem less signifi­cant. Or if you really need something to cuddle, play with neglected animals at a shelter or the Humane Society. It's impossible to frown with a warm puppy in your lap. 
5. Band together. Most Valentine's talk as of late has come from those embittered souls who can't wait for the 15th to arrive. So seek our these kindred spirits. Go out for coffee or pizza ·and share your stories about past V-Days. 
Rent "Romeo and Juliet" and take comfort in not being one half of a pair of star-crossed numbers. Or watch "Will and Grace" and real­ize that nothing beats a good platonic relation­ship. There's strength in numbers. 
4. Be obnoxious. When you've had it up to here with nauseating pink and red decorations. start stealing other people's Valentine fun ­eat their chocolates without permission, snatch their flowers. hang up their greeting cards as if they were your own. Wear black and glare at all, don't let your­self worry about anything school­related -just enjoy hanging out togeth­er. 

2. Make the most of South Bend. 
Valentine's Day is the perfect time to explore the native culture of our cor­ner of Indiana. Stroll around the University Park Mall together: noth­ing screams "town­ie" like wearing matching outfits or walking with your hands in each other's back pock­ets. 
Get glamour shots taken for that spe­cial someone or have your names air-brushed on T­shirts. To top it all off, a romantic day in the Bend wouldn't be com­
plete without a 
splash in one of the 
heart-shaped 

jacuzzis advertised by motels on 31 -watch 
for Valentine's specials. 
1. Just get it on. What better way to say you care? A full-blown make-out session is the per­fect gift. It requires no planning, it's absolutely free and it's what you both wanted to do any­thing. 
Plus, if you forget the big day, it's the perfect way to make up for it or pretend you did have a big surprise ready. So stop worrying about the 
perfect gift and just give a kiss. It's what this day is all about. 
But what about the Valentine's Day haters? The vast majority of col­lege students in particular are single, and many of these are vehement­ly opposed to the holiday.

Top Ten Movies to Watch if You Hate Valentine's Day 

10...The Birds": There's nothing like seeing a pretty blond getting her eyes pecked out. 
9. "Leaving Las Vegas": Guy hates life, guy decides to drink himself to death, guy meets prostitute who tries to change his mind -an instant classic. 
8. "What Lies Beneath": Haunting, murder, infidelity ­finally someone with more baggage than your last boyfriend or girlfriend. 
7. "The Terminator": ''I'll be back" -one of the many things you never want to hear your crazy ex say. 
6. "American Pie": "Suck me beautiful!" It's comforting to know there are kids out there with worse pick-up lines than yours.
5. "Rocky": There's nothing more romantic than a guy bleeding out his eyes, screaming your name at the top of his lungs.

So for those without Valentines this year, do not despair. There are still many ways to enjoy the holiday, whether you choose to pamper yourself or take out your bitterness on the happy couples around you. 
10. Treat yourself to a day at the spa. You don't need someone else to tell you you're worth it -go ahead and give yourself what you deserve. Massages, facials, manicures and pedicures are available at several area beauty salons and health clubs. Once someone else is kneading your back or rubbing your feet, all that pent-up Valentine's frustration will just melt away. 
floor doesn't cave in. 

2. Break up couples. Head out to the quads and aim for couples that look to be happily involved. Blatantly hit on whichever half of the pair you prefer, acting as if they are a past hook-up that you can't believe hasn't called. 
Do not relent if they get flustered and pretend they don't recognize you -if you persist, y~u will surely cause see fireworks between the for­merly happy pair. Some may call it cruel, but if you can't beat 'em, tear 'em apart. 
1. When all else fails, realize it's only a day. 
Once 11:59 p.m. comes and goes, Valentine's Day will be over, and all the pent-up furstration with it. So grit your teeth and bear it -count down the hours and all the sappy talk will be done soon.

NBA 
Shaq returns to Laker lineup, dominates in victory 
Associated Press 
Shaquille O'Neal returned to the Los Angeles Lakers' lineup on Tuesday night without showing any ill effects from a two-week layoff caused by a strained arch in his right foot. 
O'Neal had 32 points. 14 rebounds, six assists and five blocks in 43 minutes in helping the Lakers to a 113-110 over­time victory over the New Jersey Nets on Tuesday night. 
"I felt pretty good," O'Neal said after playing for the first time since Jan. 26. "I was anx­ious to get back and start the second half with a vengeance, and I believe I started on a pretty good note tonight. .. 
O'Neal. who had missed six games, hit 10 of 18 shots from the field and 12 of 24 free throws. Last year's MVP also had a key block of Stephon Marbury's shot in the overtime that set up a game-tying bas­ket by Tyronn Lue. 
The block came with the Lakers trailing 110-108 with less than a minute to play. 
"Stephan got around me, but I knew Shag was there," Lue said. "Horace Grant got the rebound, kicked it out to me and there was only one person to beat." 
Hornets 77, Pacers 66 
Jamal Mashburn had 18 points and 11 rebounds to lead the Charlotte Hornets over Indiana. 
Both teams shot poorly from the field. connecting on just 34 percent of their attempts. But the Hornets outrebounded Indiana 59-41, with P.J. Brown grabbing 13 rebounds. 
Al Harrington led Indiana with 12 points and Reggie Miller had 11, just enough to move past George Gervin into 23rd place on the NBA's all­time scoring list. 
Indiana's point total and its 28 second-half points were both season-lows. 
Reserve Derrick Coleman contributed 14 points and 11 rebounds to the victory, while Baron Davis had 13. David Wesley scored 12.

Vince Carter scored 33 points but was sitting down when Toronto opened a big lead in the second quarter Tuesday night as the Raptors rolled to a win over the demoralized

Suns 93, Warriors 83 
Shawn Marion had a career­high 28 points and ·13 rebounds, and Jason Kidd had 14 points and 10 assists as the Phoenix Suns beat the cold­shooting Golden State Warriors. 
Marion scored most of his points on fast breaks, free throws or offensive rebounds as the Suns capitalized on the Warriors' poor shooting and league-worst defense for an easy win. 
Marion scored seven straight points in the fourth quarter as Phoenix fed him the ball until he surpassed his career-high. 
The Suns returned from the All-Star break to split the sea­son series with Golden State and win for the third time in four games. 
They didn't need to play very well to beat the Warriors, who shot 34 percent in the first half, scored 51 points in the first three quarters and got no closer than five points after the game's opening minutes. 
Grizzlies 99, Celtics 98

When the Yankees open spring training Wednesday, it could be the beginning of the end of an era. 
P a u 1 O'Neill says this will be his last sea­son. 
T i n o Martinez and Scott 


B r o s i us O'Neil are in the f i n a l 
years of their contracts, as is manager Joe Torre. 
Still, there is another cham­pionship to be won, always the focus on the Yankees. 
Last October. they became just the fourth team to win three straight World Series titles. 
"I want to look back when I'm all done and say I played at the beginning of this spurt and played all the way through it," O'Neill said. "With the core of people com­ing back, this is still the team that won the championships. A couple years down the road, it might not be the same team anymore." 
Only two teams put togeth­er longer streaks: the Yankees of 1936-39 and the Yankees of 1949-53. 
The run for No. 4 -and 
the fifth in six seasons ­
begins Wednesday when 
pitchers and catchers report. 
Many of the Yankees have 
been in Florida for weeks, 
working out at New York's 
minor league complex. 
"You get excited about spring training because hope­fully one or two of our young kids could make the big league club and help the New York Yankees win," vice pres­ident of player personnel Billy Connors said. 
The most notable departure 
during the offseason was

Instead, he signed with Boston. 
Mike Mussina, given an $88.5 million, six-year con­tract, is the chief addition, joining Roger Clemens, Orlando Hernandez and Andy Pettitte in the rotation. 
"It's unbelievable," left fielder Shane Spencer said of the Yankees' rotation. "(Other) teams will be like, 'Who are we going to put our No. 1 against?' We have 

The everyday lineup is set, barring injuries. 
The only questions are whether second baseman Chuck Knoblauch has solved his throwing problems and whether Spencer has healed following knee surgery. 
"The elbow is good. No problems," said Knoblauch, who arrived at spring train­ing a month early. 
Spencer expects his surgi­cally repaired knee to be ready for opening day.

"We believe we've improved. I think we've got the talent and we're positioned to have a very good season," Malone said. "Now, we've got to go out and perform." 
In Kevin Brown, Chan Ho Park Darren Dreifort and free-agent 
addition  Andy  Ashby,  the  
Dodgers  have  four  proven  
starters.  Brown,  Park  and  

Dreifort were a combined 43-25 last season, while others who started for Los Angeles were 11­26. 
The 33-year-old Ashby, who signed a $22.5 million, three­year contract, was 12-13 with Philadelphia and Atlanta in 2000, but pitched in the 1998 and 1999 All-Star games. 
"Our 1-2-3 starters were com­parable to any other front-line guys," Malone said. "Our objec­tive this offseason was to try and improve the pitching, and we tried to address that with the addition of Andy Ashby and bringing Ramon Martinez back." 
The 32-year-old Martinez was 10-8 with a 6.13 ERA in 27 starts with the Boston Red Sox last sea­son. He pitched for the Dodgers for nearly nine years before undergoing season-ending shoul­der surgery in June 1998. 
Martinez figures to compete with Eric Gagne, 4-6 with a 5.15 ERA last season, for the fifth starter's spot. 
"I think we're improved there, we've got more depth," Malone said. "We're just trying to return to the Dodger tradition of suc­cess, and that's with pitching, and we're going to emphasize and focus on defense. 

Associated Press 
Let the improvement continue. 
That's the Los Angeles Dodgers' mantra, and if they improve another nine games this season, as they did last 
year,  it  
might  be  
enough  for  

their first playoff berth since 1996. 
With one 
workouts and lefty Randy Keisler also figures to get a chance. 
While closer Mariano Rivera is back and left-han­der Mike Stanton returns as a setup man, right-handed setup man Jeff Nelson returned to Seattle after five seasons with the Yankees. 
Ramiro Mendoza, who missed most of last season because of shoulder prob­lems, is throwing following surgery but the Yankees like­ly will limit his innings. Lefty Allen Watson, also coming back from an injury-marred season. is not expected to be ready for opening day. 
New York has brought in a half-dozen pitchers to audi­tion for the role, a group that includes Dwight Gooden, Williams coming off typically strong seasons, the Yankees seem solid up the middle. 

"The start of spring training is exciting," Yankees director of player development Rob Thomson said. "You've had the whole winter off. You kind of go through depression the first couple weeks after the season is over. You don't have that fill of intensity and competitiveness. It's nice to get back into it." 
son with the Dodgers, he jokingly predicted a World Series appear­ance. Instead, the Dodgers went 77-85, one of baseball's biggest disappointments. 
The Dodgers improved to 86­76 last year, but it wasn't good enough to make the playoffs or, as it turned out, for manager Davey Johnson to keep his job. He's been replaced by Jim Tracy, a first-time big league manager who has baseball's highest pay­roll at his disposal.

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 
No. 4 Illini rally from deficit to defeat No. 19 Badgers 

Associated Press 
Marcus Griffin scored off an inbounds pass from Sean Harrington with 0.8 seconds left as No. 4 Illinois beat No. 19 Wisconsin 68-67 Tuesday night. 
Griffin's shot c-ame after Frank Williams rallied the Illini from a 13-point halftime deficit by scoring 18 of his 22 points in the second half. 
Williams had collided with two defenders on a short jumper with 2 seconds left. Wisconsin grabbed Williams' miss, but lost control of the rebound. 
The Illini kept the ball and Griffin barely had time to catch it five feet from the basket and toss an arching shot back in. 
Williams then intercepted the Badgers' inbounds pass with 0.6 seconds left to seal the win for Illinois (20-5, 10-2 Big Ten). 
Kirk Penney led Wisconsin (15-7, 6-5) with 18 points, including four 3-pointers. Penney made the two free throws that gave the Badgers a 67-66 lead with 9.5 seconds left. 
Brian Cook opened the game wi.th Illinois' only 3-pointer in the first half. The Illini missed six 3-pointers as Wisconsin went on a 15-3 run that lasted almost 10 minutes and ended with the Badgers leading 15-6. 
The Badgers shot 61 percent, including 6-for-9 from 3-point range, in the first half. Roy Boone and Penney made 3­pointers to end the half with Wisconsin leading 35-22. 
Fouls got the Badgers in trou­ble early in the first half, when centers Andy Kowske and Charlie Wills each got their third and sat down. Wisconsin's seventh foul came less than six minutes into the half, putting Illinois in the bonus early. 
Illinois kept driving to the bas­ket and the Badgers contested every shot. Kowske, Kelley and Wills picked up their fourth fouls and the Illini made six free throws to get within one basket, 51-48, with 7:09 remaining. 
Penney slowed the momen­tum with a 3-pointer to push the lead back to six points with 6:11 left. 
Linton made a layup and Boone stole a fumbled ball from Cory Bradford and dropped it in to put Wisconsin ahead 65-61 with 1:47 left. Cook tipped in an Illinois miss with 1 minute left. 
Boone traveled at the other end and Griffin rebounded a Willilams miss and banked it in for a 66-65 lead with 30 sec­onds left. 
Penney drove the lane and Harrington fouled him on the layup with 9.5 seconds to go. Penney made both for a 67-66 lead. 
Williams took the inbounds and drove down the middle, col­lided with two defenders and missed his shot with 2 seconds left. The ball bounced off a after Boston College closed the first half with a 15-5 run. 
Already in a situation where more than a loss or two would practically eliminate them from consideration for an at-large berth to the NCAA tournament, the Huskies responded with an 11-2 run to open the second half and were back within a point with 15:31 to play. 
Freshman Caron Butler, who finished with l 7 points and 11 rebounds, hit a floater along the baseline with 8:00 left to give the Huskies a 59-54 lead. 
With the shot clock winding down, Brown hit a 3-pointer with 5:34 left that started a 12­1 run and gave the Huskies a 71-59 lead with 2:12 to play. 
Brown made four free throws to close the run and the Huskies made six more in a row to keep the Eagles at bay and avenge the 85-68 loss on Jan. 3 that ended their 23-game winning streak in the series. 
Singletary and freshman Ryan Sidney each had 18 points for the Eagles, while Troy Bell had 
16. Bell finished 5-for-16 from the field, including 3-for-10 from 3-point range. The Eagles, who had won a school-record seven straight conference games, were 6-for-26 from beyond the arc, 2-for-13 in the second half 
No. 12 Florida 81, LSU 7 4 
Teddy Dupay scored 11 points in Florida's overtime win over LSU. 
Dupay. who had surgery for a herniated disc on Jan. 10, had just six points in regulation, but scored all but eight of Florida's 19 points in overtime. 
Udonis Haslem and Brett Nelson each scored 18 points for Florida (17-5, 7-4 Southeastern Conference). Matt Bonner added 17. 
Ronald Dupree led LSU (11­11, 1-10) with 18 points and 11 rebounds. Collis Temple III had 14 points, Jermain Williams 12, and Bright 11. 
The Gators struggled against LSU's defense and trailed most of the game. With 1:53 left in regulation, Haslem made his first free throw, pulling Florida within one point at 57-56. Haslem's second attempt bounced out and LSU's Ronald Dupree grabbed it. 
A missed shot and a foul by LSU sent Major Parker to the line for the Gators. He made one of two free throws to tie it at 57 with 51 seconds remain­ing. 
Torris Bright hit a 3-pointer to give the Tigers a 60-57 lead with 27 seconds left. Then Dupay hit a field goal and a free throw to tie it at 60. 
Jason Wilson made two free throws with 3.2 seconds remaining to give LSU 62-60 lead. Florida's ensuing inbound pass sailed the length of the court to Haslem, who was

Although it appears Joker Phillips will be named an assis­tant, the Irish still must fill two other coaching vacancies. Former safeties coach Lou West is now the defensive coordinator at Toledo. 
And on Monday, cornerbacks coach Jerry Rosburg bolted to the National Football League. Rosburg was named as the spe­cial teams coach for the Cleveland Browns. 
During the 2000 season, Rosburg coached a punt return unit that ranked 12th in the nation and blocked six punts. 
"He was a mastermind at the whole special teams thing," said cornerback Jason Beckstrom, who also played on the kickoff, punt and punt return teams. "That was really his big deal. He came in and just totally changed

"Prior to that time the west side had John Long as a finan­cial partner and had a better financial package." 
The Cardinals also signed a deal with Tempe on Monday that gives the team develop­ment rights on land near the stadium. The Fiesta Bowl also strongly endorsed the Tempe site. 
"The Fiesta Bowl and the Cardinals have a long relation­ship with the city of Tempe and I think it's a great site," said Michael Bidwill, Cardinals vice president, general counsel and son of owner William Bidwill. 
· "It's right on the lakeside," he said. "It's going to be adja­cent to the Mill Avenue enter­tainment. shopping and restaurant district. It's going to be on the light rail line. There are a lot of real positives to this site." 
Backers cited Tempe's expe­rience in handling big events and a location close to hotels, restaurants and resorts. Those amenities would make it easi­er to use the stadium for things other than football games. 
"If it was just a football sta­dium I would definitely go for the west side." board member 
C.A. Howlett said. "But with the multipurpose factor I just couldn't get past those obsta­cles for the west side." 

Board member Rod Williams, one of the two dis­senters, detailed a long list of concerns about the Tempe site. 
The stadium was authorized 
by county voters last 
November. Virtually all the 
public money will come from a 
hotel-motel tax and a sur­
charge of rental cars. 

The stadium cost has risen from $331 million to $334 mil­lion with Tempe promising the extra $3 million to cover costs associated with a bedrock problem at the site.

The Cardinals, an original NFL member with a long his­tory of mediocrity or worse, have played at Sun Devil Stadium on the Arizona State campus since moving from St. Louis 13 years ago. 
Although no threats were made, there was a widespread belief the team would have left town if the stadium vote had failed last November. 
An $18 million pledge to Tempe by the Cardinals Ill.st Thursday may have been the deciding factor in the board's decision. The Fiesta Bowl also strongly endorsed the Tempe site.

Irish need to buckle down, win against Orangewomen

.... By TIM CASETY 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Joker Phillips, the University of Minnesota's wide receivers coach for the past two seasons, will likely join the Irish staff sometime this week. 
"He's on his way [to Notre Dame]," an employee in the Minnesota football office told The Observer on Tuesday. "He's not with us [Minnesota] anymore." 


According to Elvin Jones, more and we have been doing that." 
The Orangewomen ( 10-1 i. 4-7 in the Big East) are coming off a 75-51 loss at conference rival Villanova on Saturday. Senior Leigh Aziz led Syracuse with 15 points and 12 rebounds. 
Forward Beth Record leads Syracuse in scoring with 13.1 points per game. Paula Moore and Julie McBride come off the bench to score 11 and 9 points per game, respective­ly. 
"They've got a couple of good shooters," said Irish All-American center Ruth Riley. "Their post players are pretty accurate as well. We just have to go in there and play the whole game." 
Despite their record. Syracuse has proven to be a tough opponent on their home court. The Orangewomen are 5-3 this season at Manley Field House, including a close 76-63 loss to No. 3 Connecticut. 
"Syracuse is a great team at home," McGraw said. "They gave Connecticut a great game. They're a very, very capable team and we really need to go in there ready to play." 
Siemon, who has been playing with a fractured hand for a month now, feels that the injury is coming along nicely. 
"It's just now really starting to get better," Siemon said. "We played last Wednesday and usually I'd have to take a day off because it's so sore. But now it's so much better I prac­ticed on Thursday." 
With Siemon spending more time on the practice floor with her fellow starters, the Irish have begun to recapture the offensive flair that has generated 11 consecutive road victo­ries. 
"I saw [Monday] sparks of what we had going for a while there," McGraw said. "I think that we'll be ready."

Irish focused on win, not Humphrey's injury 
By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN Associate Sports Editor 

The Irish will find out just how far a short bench can go tonight against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights. 
. The No. 14 Irish normally use a six-man .rotation, one which may need a few adjustments with starting power forward Ryan Humphrey nursing a sprained ankle. Humphrey sprained his ankle in the final minute of Sunday's win over West Virginia, and is question­able for tonight's conference road match. 
"It's swollen and it's sore," Humphrey said Monday after visiting the doctor. 'Tm going to play it by ear. We're in the stretch now where each win
