Fitzpatrick garnering 13% seen as viable alternative 


by Bill Weber 

Last Thursday, for the first time in Notre Dame's 127 year history, a woman's name appear­ed on the ballot for student body president. and 13% of the Notre Dame men who voted expressed their concrete desire to see this woman elected over the several men who also had their hats in the ring. 
In light of this phenomenon, The Observer spoke with Miss Eileen Fitzpatrick, her running mate Walter Secada, and three key members of the campaign team, Barney Gallagher, Bernie,Ryan, and Tom Thra.sher to discuss their views on the cam­paign, its results, and its possible 
ilnplica tions.

demonstrated, as evidenced by some heavy barrages in Keenan; Hall, that she has a firm will and the ability to work with oppo­sing men in the government. 
"Eileen is a good person to work with", said Thrasher. 
"I talked with the students forthright and honestly. This made them accept me as a person very much equal to the men candidates", said Miss Fitz­patrick. 
"I do not think that that many votes came to me just because I am a girl. Once we got the people to take us seriously we really began to gain ground. This did not come until about Tuesday. If on Sunday we were at the point we were on Tuesday, I think we might just be in the run-off'', she conclud­ed. 
"They ran to win", Ryan said. "It was not just to prove a point nor was it a 'moral · crusade'. It was like fighting the Civil War all over again in a way." 
"Eileen won the votes her­

CAM RANH BAY, South Vietnam (UPI) -Most of the 43 
U.S. airmen held in a narcotics raid are Air Force security policemen who had guarded the Cam Ranh Air Base against Communist attack, the base commdander said yesterday. 
Military sources said 65 air­men had been interrogated Saturday following the largest narcotics raid involving U.S. servicemen in South Vietnam. Twenty-two were released. 
Of the 43 still being held, some are already experiencing painful drug withdrawal symp­toms, indicating that they have been addicted to narcotics, the sources said. 
An Air Force spokesman said the men were rounded up for .. alleged illegal use, possession and sale of narcotics." None of the detained were officers or high ranking non-commissioned officers: 
"The majority of those appre­hended were security police­men," said Col. Abbot C. Greenleaf, commander of the 483rd Tactical Wing and base commander at Cam Ranh Bay. 
Unlike the Army, the Air Force has no drug amnesty program in South Vietnam and if addicts ask for medical treat­ment the request may be used as evidence against them in a court martial, military sources said. 
thus, those undergoing with­drawal symptoms may have to accept "cold turkey" denial rather than methadone treat­ment which is a non-addictive heroin substitute used by the Army and private drug pro­grams. 
Military sources said that because some of those detained were sentry dog handlers, the Air Force had to replace some of the guard dogs around the base perimeter because the animals will not accept a strange handler. 
Saturday's raid apparently stemmed from an informant's tip, sources said.

For forms of government let fools contest, 
Whate'er is best administer'd is best. 

Alexander Pope 
FOUNDED NOVEMBER 3,1966 NOTRE DAME,INDIANA 
John Barkett 
Today's runoff election for the Student Body Presidency is probably the ~ingle most 
important day in student government's existence since J. Richard Rossi won the first 
rights of student self-government from the University. For the first time since Rossi, we 
have a candidate who is committed to a series of positive and realistic goals, articulated 
before and argued throughout the campaign. That candidate is John Barkett, and we 
strongly urge his election as student Body President. 
John Barkett is more than a fine administrator. He is a man with a record of getting things done. His 2-year record in Morrisey speaks for itself; it is one of the best-run and most socially active halls on campus. Likewise, the Hall President's Council under his administration as chairman set up a leadership conferance which helped other Presidents 
'in their halls. It has also established definite conclusions about the rector-hall 
relationship, and in general has behaved in a far more active manner than it ever has 
before. 
Barkett is informed, direct, and honest. He'll bother some administrators who are used 
to limiting student power by being better aware of the University's operation than 
student power's elected representatives, but he will represent the students, and represent 
them well. The way he'll represent them will not be with the empty rhetoric of 
confrontation, but with solid and inevitable reason. 
When we write of honesty, we do not mean the trivial tests of honesty that have cropped up in the campaign. 3oth candidates pass that test. 
The honesty we refer to is John Barkett's honest acceptance of the fact that student government can address itself to important problems effecting the students. This is where he differs from his opponent, and this is where he best shines. The programs John Barkett espouses are ones we can realistically expect to get next year. Barkett espouses them because he believes we can get them. 
We can get the thing Barkett has pledged to get. The long-overdue "money back to the halls" project Barkett has endorsed can be accomplished without a raise in the activities fee. The Barkett minority program, written by' Orlando Rodriguez, the Krashna Administration Human Affairs Commissioner and easily their most knowledgeable man on Minority Affairs, is a logically sound one and one that won't be hindered by the University. Barkett's plan to create a Student-Faculty Advisory Board for Security is eminently workable and would only help a deteriorating situation. 
Probably the most important aspect of Barkett's campaign is his approach to coeducation. He recognizes both its economic necessity and its inevitability, and the suggestions he has made to antitipate coeducations are both commendable and helpful. 
Particularly important are his suggestions to adjust the placement bureau for the admission of women, to appoint a co-ordinator, to recruit female professors and female administrators, and to provide gynecological services in the infirmiry. 
The merger of Notre Dame's student government with that of St. Mary's will be consumated regardless of who wins this election. Kathy Barlow has said this several times before her own election. We are confident that she will find it as easy to merge with a student government led by John Barkett as with one led by Don Mooney. 
Mr. Mooney's campaign continues to be a dissapointment. In an effort to "get specific" Mr. Mooney has written a list of programs; some of them of the promise-the-world variety ("open air concerts with good inexpensive groups") some already suggested by John Barkett (such as the Junior Year at Home Program) some of them vague ("revitalization of the Social Commission.") and some of them impossible to obtain, no matter how much confrontation is used (such as putting approval of the rector in the hands of the hall members.) Mr. Mooney has run an honest and fair inquiry into the affairs of the campus, but he has found no answers. Mr. Barkett has.  
It is for all these reasons, then, and for the reasons expressed in last Wednesday's Observer that we endorse the Student Body Presidential Bid of John Barkett.

Unsolicited Appreciation 
All "good" things must come to an end sooner or later, and so, it is with another year at Notre Dame. We feel that the year is over for _all practical purposes since the Krashna administration is out and the 
general yearly turnover of personnel is a bout to begin. 
Since we don't want any of the efforts of campus personalities to 
go unappreciated we would like to say thanks to various people, and 
present some awards to illustuous campus dignitaries who in our 
humble opinion have helped make this last year one of the great 
years in recent campus history. 
So here first are our heart-felt thanks: 
TO TOM THRASHER -thanks for nothing: we wouid have been 
more original but since you have never been accused of being so, we 
won't be either. 
TO PARK MAYHEW -thanks for a job well done. Now. when is 
the real proposal going to appear? (I wonder where they went to 
school?) 
TO GARY CARUSO -a special thanks for the fine exhibit of 
bureaucracy in the sophomore car report. (I wonder if he ever 
thought of reviving the Leprechaun?) 
TO SISTER ALMA -a special thanks for the open mindedness so 
essential in formulating lasting results between communities. 
TO THE HUDDLE· a great thanks for personally attempting to 
finance lights for Wrigley Field. Too ball the project got gummed up. 
TO THE STUDENT SENATE AND ITS ILLUSTRIOUS 
MEMBERSHIP -a thanks and a congratulations for a job well done. 
We're glad to see students take their positions so seriously. You 
succeeded in making a mountain out of a veritable sand box. 
TO ARTHUR PEARS -thanks for another great year of security. 
The murder rate was again 0! 
TO JOHN BARKETT AND THE HPC -a thanks for showing the 
Senate that there is a need for only one good governmental body 
(Now, where did the SLC go?) 
TO DAVID KRASHNA -a sincere thanks for trying ( and we 
mean this one ) bJ.It people didn't deserve your efforts. 
TO THE ND BASKETBALL TEAM -a special thanks for the 
UCLA game. No matter what else, this is the one to remember. 
TO PROFS. ESTABROOK, WILLIAMS, HINKEMEYER, AND 
RUNDE -thanks for the efforts towards a better academic 
environment. (It's tough fighting city hall.) 
We seem to have run out of people to thank. So now for the 1971 
Dubious Distinction Awards. 
TO STEVE BRION AND THE SCHOLASTIC GANG -the Annual 
Overkill award, for managing to spend $50,000 publishing a 
magazine with a circulation of 14 students, 6 faculty and l stall in 
Dillon Hall. The prize consists of 497 cans of alphabet soup so that 
all the editors can continue to sit around and spit letters at each 
uther. 
TO THE MEMBERS OF THE SLC -a pair of gold-plated bellows, symbolizing supremacy in the windbag competition among all the committees and councils on campus. (To be eligible a committee must hold regular extraordinarily tedious meetings which do absolutely nothing but give members a chance to shoot their mouths off.) 
TO ARA -an honorary engineering degree and 200 blank blueprint sheets in appreciation for his prize-winning creation of the Wishbone defense. 
TO TERRY SHIELDS -a very special silver loving cup, for the outstanding dedication and devotion to all sweat="producing endeavor. (As an added attraction, we can also assure you, Terry, that the trophy was once worn by Ralph Gugliemi against Purdue) 
TO MR. CARL KOCH -a lifetime membership in Students against Racism and the Afro-American Society, plus a complete listing ofnational zipcodes. 
TO JIM HOLSINGER (editor of the New Voice) -a trunkload of 
sour grapes and a license plate size motto board reading: AMBITION 
(there's a rumor that the plate once belonged to a certain noted Theology teacher but we can't confirm that -sorry Jim.) 
TO CHRIS WOLFE-The White Knight award, for his courageous 
efforts to single-handedly save the campus from the threat of 
open-mindedness. 
TO BISHOP PURSLEY-The Ti Grace Atkinson Chair in Modern 
Church Thinking, which comes with a stipend in the form of a free 
subscription to the Observer for a year.  
TO Tl GRACE -a copy of Pres. Harding's presidential theory, 
"return to normalcy." 
TO GLEN CORSO -the Sacred Jleart Award for Religious

Notre graduate Rick Libowitz on the Hebrew University Campus. 

Graduate in Israel 
Jerusalem, February, 1971: "I want to become a rabbi because of the idea of doing things with and for people," says 22 year old Rick Lobowitz who this year is studying at the Hebrew University of Je.rusalem, and plans to return to the United States where he is enrolled in a Rabbinical School. 
Rick, son of Mr. and Mrs. Milton Libowitz of 3 Rocky Rapids Road, Stamford, Connecticut, has a long record of work in both politics and civil rights. He worked towards voters' rights in the South and helped in election campaigns for Robert Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy. 
After completing a B.A. degree in English at the University of Notre Dame Rick came to Israel in July and spent two months learning Hebrew at a course of the Teachers Training College at Sede Boker, a kibbutz (collective agricultrual settlement) in the Negev desert whose members include Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion. 
He then spent a week touring Israel before ooming to Jerusalem where, in addition to studying at the Hebrew University, he is also enrolled at the Hayim Greenberg Teachers Seminary. His programme includes Bible, Talmud, Jewish History, Jewish Thought and Sociology, but he is most concerned with learning Hebrew. ­
By studying at the Hebrew University, Rick says he is following a cousin, Dr. Lewis Kaplan, former head of the Baltimore Teachers' College, who, in 1925, was the first American to study at the University which was founded on Mt. Scopus in 1918. Access to this site, cut off in 1948, was regained in 1967 and last year the entire Law Faculty and all first year science students were transferred th~re. There were only a handful of overseas students at the University in Dr. Kaplan's student days. This year almost one quarter of the University's 16,000 students are from abroad, an increase of 400% since the Six-Day-War in 1967. 
As a result of the strikes on the United States campuses, when Rick started studying at the Hebrew University, it was the first time he had been to rtgular classes for seven months. He commented on how good it was to see full classes again. He dinds the classes enjoyable and likes to see so many people from different countries congregated. He adds, "where else can you lay outside in the grass in November?" 
Rick sees Israel as a "mixture of things." He feels it is difficult at first to get used to a different style of life yet his is already changing. "If my mother saw me eating tomatoes and egg-plants, would not get the same treatment at home again," he comment'!. He likes the way people in Israel have "good, concrete goals" which they try to accomplish. 
In the future, Rick would perhaps consider returning to live in Israel but for the present his plans are already made. Next year, he will begin studying to become a rabbi at a Reconstructionist R:1bbinical College. In any case he has to return for a while, "I've spent four years trying to change things in the 'Jnited States, and working with similarly oriented people, and that is too long to ~urn my back on it all, he concludes.

Junior parents comment on student life 

(Continued from Page I) 
at ND was not depicted on the film. The parents in the audience were then asked for questions. One father wanted to know what student life should be like. Mooney answered that it should be as diverse as possible and that there still may be too many Irish catholics on campus. He also said the social aspect of the university must be much looser and that co-ed dining halls and dorms should be pushed. 
Corso answered a query on the cause of the damage of weekends by stating that there is not enough to do on campus. He put the blame on the students for the vandalism. 
Mooney said that it is not the fault of any one group, students or administration, but just the way things are presently set up. 
A parent commented that twenty years ago students at ND had the same weekends to put up with, "yet there was not all this drinking and vandalism." In

reply Meyers pointed to the fact that ·"ours is a more affluent society, the students today expect more." Mooney added that an all-male university is no longer conventional, and that with coeducation the vandalism would stop. 
Corso said that co-education wouldn't help all that much because some students would still drink too much but going co-ed would help, even if it would f!Ot solve the problem.

Irish drop Redmen, Dayton next 
John Pleick has come on to give the lri'lh a consistent game 
by Mike Pavlin 
The preliminaries are out of the way and the main event is on tonight. 
Fresh from a 92-79 victory over St. John's, the Notre Dame basketball aggregation takes on the University of Dayton with an NCAA bid possibly in the balance. Offers to the post-season tourney are due out tomorrow morning and a loss to the Flyers could cause the selection committee to pass the Irish by. 
Thanks to some late heroics by captain Austin Carr and a sizzling shooting performance by big Sid Catlett, NO enters tonight's tilt 17-7. The Irish stuffed the Redmen in the can early, then had to hold down the lid as St. John's rallied to cut a 20-point deficit to six. 
The game was played before an SRO house in Jamaica, N.Y. last Saturday night and featured a battle between the vaunted scoring ability of NO's Carr and the leaping ability of the Redmen's super soph Mel Davis. Though Carr had a below average night with 32 points, his clutch play in the last ten minutes helped the Irish withstand the strong St. John's comeback. 
Davis stands just under 6-7 but is a prodigious leaper. He cleaned the defensive boards all night and wa; credited with 21 rebounds, 13 in the first half. Offensively, however, Davis met his match in NO's Collis Jones who battled him head to head. Jones out-scored Davis 21-19 and even blocked a few of the latter's shots. Though only a soph Davis has a chance to break the St. John's career rebounding mark this year. 
The Irish threw a stout man-to-man defense at St. John's, and the Redmen were unable to penetrate it throughout the first half. Numerous turnovers (18 on the night) and a cold shooting hand held the St. John's offense to a minimum. The only man able to score with any consistancy was 6-5 soph Bill Schaeffer who canned 13 points. 
The high-scoring Carr was the victim of a collapsing man-to-man defense which "held" him to I 6 first half 
points and forced him to do half 
of his game scoring from the 
foul line. This defense, however, 
had the effect of leaving wide 
gaps on the floor which the rest 
of the Irish penetrated with ease. 
ND fast-breaked effectively and 
caught St. John's napping several 
times. 
The Irish busted out to a 11-2 
lead and steadily widened the 
advantage. Balanced scoring 
from Jones ( 11 points), Catlett 
(1 0) and Tom Sinnott (8) sent ND to the locker room up 49-29. Sinnott played in the place of Jackie Meehan who was bothered by an ailing knee. 
But along with a 20-point lead, the Irish picked-up a bushe' of fouls and this tendency hurt them early in the second half. Catlett, who blitzed St. John's with a 7 for 8 shooting performance, got his 4th foul at 
13:50 and it put the Redmen in the bonus situation. St. John's began to get more balanced scoring and Davis continued to hound the boards. 
With Catlett and Sinnott on the bench with four fouls apiece, the Redmen made several runs at the Irish. 6-8 Greg Cluess and 6-0 Rich Lyons led charges which cut the ND lead to ten 
(11 :40) and six points ( 7 :40). Irish coach Johnny Dee sent Catlett and Sinnott back in and then Carr went to work. 

Held in check most of the ·half, Austin broke loose for II 
points in the next five minutes 
to put the game out of reach. 
Catlett and Sinnott fouled out, 
but Jones and John Pleick 

helped Carr hold off the 
Redmen. Johnny Egart, who 

replaced Sinnott several times 
during the contest, scored the 
last four Irish points to make the 
final score 92-79. 

There were several encouraging factors in the game for the Irish. First, they were out-rebounded 40-32, yet still managed a solid victory. Second, Carr was held to only 18 shots from the field, 1 0 below his average. The Irish responded with a balanced attack, shooting 52% from the field. This performance might tend to discourage teams from over-loading on Austin in the future.
