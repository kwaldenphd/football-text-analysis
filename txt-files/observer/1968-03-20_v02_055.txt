Irish Drop Ll U 62-60 To Face Dayton Thurs. 
The Irish eked out a 62-60 quarter-final victory over Long Island U. last night in Madison Square Garden, New York City. 
Tomorrow night, ND takes 

on Dayton at 6 p.m. CST. (The game will be carried on WNDU radio.) The Flyers gained the semis by shading Fordham 61­60 last night. The other semi­final pits St. Peter's, N.J., and Kansas. The final and consola­tion are scheduled Saturday . 
As in Saturday's 62-58 tri­umph over Army, tight defense provided a narrow final margin. 
Newbold nearly pulled out the contest himself, but his ef­fort fell short. With 5:44 to play Notre Dame lost the lead for the first time when New­bold converted a free throw. LIU was on top 54-53. 
Moments later, the Irish turn­ed some bad luck inside-out. Mike O'Connell injured his knee, but his replacement, George Res­tovich, added two critical fielders late in the game. 
At 5:00, Newbold's jumper gave LIU a 56-53 cushion. But three straight hoops by Bob Arnzen, Restovich and Bob Whit­more put the Irish on top for

-L~o~co£?ntradictions Conspire To Confuse H·im 
This is the second in a three part series on Detroit six months after. 
Wayne State University is in urban Detroit. Stand­ing on the campus, a student can see the General Mo­tors Office Building, the international headquarters of America's largest corporation; a symbol of America's success. But if he were to look in another direction, he sees the worst part of the Motor City's ghetto area, America's failure. If he chooses to acknowledge the contradiction, it confuses him. 
Wayne State, a one hundred year old institution, is 
in many ways a microcosm of the entire Detroit situa­
tion. Of its 30,000 students, 28,000 commute from 
the white suburbs. Until very recently, when token ef­
forts were made, a paternalistic administration has to­
tally ignored the surrounding area. 
Certain ofWayne's expansion programs have caused 
the destruction of good, lower-middle income housing 
(which predominates in this· area; there are very few 
rusty fire escapes, dirty children tenements that one 
associates with the word 'ghetto'). This has alienated 
the neighboring black community. 
The huge majority of Wayne's middle class white students did not bargain for the continually chaotic racial situation that pervades their academic pursuits. But its awesome reality forces them to make a person­al decision. Many return to the gardens and pine pan­elling of Grosse Point with a rationalizing hope that the government will save the city. But some-feel that they should stay, and others must stay. 
Perhaps the most difficult dicision is that which is forced upon the black student. This scholastic year has seen the formation of a group called the Associa­tion of Black Students. The organization stems, in the words of founder and president Lonnie Peak, from "an awareness, a psychological awareness that one's major priority is to the community from which he came." 
The group's first public activity was to boycott a University-sponsored symposium on 'Race Relations and the Urban University' and hold their own con­ference on the same subject, which many observers felt was the best attended event ever held at the school. 
The city's leaders feel that Wayne is irrelevant to the black community and have told the black students 
to "take what you can get" from the school. Peak says: "We know that some of the material we get at Wayne is garbage. Wayne is a part of the white power 
structure, and all we can do is sift and sort out the in­formation that is useful to us." The articulate Peak continued: "The black student now wants to work for change within the community. But if this change does not come about, a decision on a further course of action will have to be made." 
The sensitized white also finds himself in a delicate 
situation. Art Johnston, editor of 'The South End.' the student newspaper, states: "The white radical, the individual who believes in a change in the social order, will be caught in the crossfire. This individual, who opposes the use of force, will attempt to communi­cate with both parties and hence be in great personal danger-my life has been threatened.'' 
Johnston continues: "Racial discrimination exists in and around Wayne State. The English Department didn't allow an African literature course, for example. Also, there exists a definite effort to release profes­
. sors who are politically active on an unfavorable po­sition. A professor was fired. I firmly believe, because he joined the West Central Organization (a black acti­vist group)." On future riots, Johnston said; "I'm a­fraid of next summer. I wouldn't be surprised to see the place burn down." 
Another white radical, commenting on black pow­er, said: "The black militants are becoming more po­litically oriented. Their political convictions have grown from their experience, and now they are plan­ning, growing more confident. After the riots, the city administration said that we don't approve of riots, but they are symptomatic and w~ need more jobs, 
more open housing. But it is too late. We will have to 
pay for the past 300 years." 
There is another type of individual. The majority 
of Wayne's students, like those of most northern, ur­
ban universities, are middle classs, unaware whites. One 
fraternity man said: "After the riots, I looked upon 
the Negroes with a different perspective-{ don't 
trust them." Another said: "You don't know what 
they'll do. All they understand is force." This type of 
individual, and his counterpart in the 'adult' society, 
must be made sensitive to the situation if it is to be saved. 
But now Wayne State, like the entire city of De­troit, is becoming an armed camp. The campus police, like the municipal's, have greatly increased their arma­ments. 'Rifle clubs,' having very little to do with 
sport shooting, have sprung up on both sides. For the 
student who chooses to understand, there is an almost unbearable tension at his school. 
And one student pointer! out that "Detroit was progressive. What you see in Detroit and at Wayne_ now, you will soon see elsewhere."

By GUY DE SAPIO A group of prominent hall presidents will meet tonight to discuss the future of the Hall President's Council. Discussion will center around the possibil­ity of declaring the President's Council independent of Student Government. The informal meeting will be held to outline a set of ideas about the role of the Hall Pres­ident's Council. The results will be presented to all the presidents at the regular meeting Thursday night. The need for the redefinition of roles is due, according to Bob McCarter, newly elected Alumni Hall President because of the "confusion, mismanage­ment, and lack of communica­tions" between the President's Council, Student Government and Student Union. "It seems to me, that while hall life is becoming more impor­tant, it is being deemphasized. Student government should 'be there to benefit halls." McCarter said. "Communications are poor . . . not enough emphasis is placed on interhall activities." McCarter cited troubles that Alumni Hall had with Student Government Officials over Mardi Gras and Homecoming as reasons for his concern. He said that the Mardi Gras Committee promised to contact him about allowing Alumni to set up a booth but never did. McCarter claims that the Stu­dent Union Homecoming Com­mittee still owes Alumni $100 for second prize in last year's homecoming. "We put in a lot of . time and money," he said. "They promised that the first place hall would be re-imbursed." McCarter said that although Alumni came

"That's wonderful. Working with the poor, no doubt. acting on the Christian principles a Notre Dame education instills. You know, Father, I've been meaning to talk to you." "No, he was avoiding the draft." "Oh." The two sat quietly for several moments, listening to the whine of the engines, bouncing lazily in the pockets of air. Fr. Hesburgh turned once again to his companion. "What are you doing on this flight?" "I've got a government grant to write a book-156 pages long in eleven point medium type on eight by twelve paper with· one and a half inch margins on Student Power Among the Incas. Also, I've been fortunate enough to have it scheduled as a directed readings, three credits." "Wonderful, wonderful, uh, what did you say your name was?

"Residential university? You mean everybody living on cam­pus, like Harvard or Oxford? Even the Administration?" 
"That's the way I understand it. Why?" 
Fr. Hesburgh stared out the window for a moment. He stubbed his cigarette with a shaking hand and turned back to his compan­ion, an angry look on his face. "Who do they think they are? Why, that's in loco parentis. I can't be tied down like that. I'ye got 
committments to honor, Summa Drives, Marriage Conferences, the War College, Civil Rights Commission, the Peace Corps." . 
He mumbled to himslef until the plane touched down in 
Brasilia. The Notre Dame student beside him watched him out of 
the corner of his eye, prepared to block any drastic action. 
Fr. Hesburgh had calmed down by the time he· entered the term­inal. "Maybe I'll see you again, son." he said with a smile. "Ever consider the Peace Corps? Or maybe at a reunion."
