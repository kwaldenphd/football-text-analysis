Four votes decide state drinking age 
by John Shaughnessy Staff Reporter 
Whether or not the Indiana House of Representatives approve 
changing the state's drinking age to 19 will be decided by four 
votes. according to Tom Black. coordinator of the Notre Dame 
Student Lobby. 
The House convenes today at I :00 p.m. to vote on the lowered 
drinking age proposal. 
When asked if the House will approve the 19-year-old legal age, 
Black simply stated, "I think we'll have the necessary 51 votes to 
pass the bill on Monday. It all will rest on pulling four more votes." 
Blat·k's analysis represents a significant shift on the bill's chance 
of success since last Wednesday. At that time, State Senator Robert 
Kovach said. "As to where things stand right now, I really don't 
think the bill will be approved by the House." 
Kovach made his statement after conferring with Rep. Stanley .Jones, one of the co-sponsors of the bill, HR 1104. On Wednesday, .Jones had estimated that 36 representatives supported a 19-year-old drinking age. The support of an additiona115 members, Kovach stated, wasn't likely. 
Before the House convened today. Black said there are now 47 representatives who are definitely in favor of the bill. Another six members who are undecided, he stated, could be persuaded to support the bill. At least four votes are needed to get the bill passed. 
"Out of those four votes, three seem to be leaning our way," 
Black noted. 
"If we get 51 representatives to support the bill, several others will jump on the bandwagon," Black continued. "We could end up with 55 votes. The important thing though is to get the four votes we need." 
Lobby efforts help 
Ed Byrne,lstudent body president, attributed the reason for the bill's improved chance of success to the efforts of a student lobby in Indianapolis last week under the direction of Black. 
Last Thursday, a lobby composed of Black, Byrne, Jerry Klingenberger, Cress Hizer, Tom Fitzgerald, Darlene Palma, John Lonsberg, Augie Grace, Rob Tully, Michele Tate, Diana Merton and Stan Cardenas went to Indianapolis to convince legislators of the bill's merit. 
Byrne stated, "When we showed up on Thursday, almost everyone had lost hope of getting the bill passed. The Indiana Student Association and the two co-sponsors of the bill (Reps. Jones and Marilyn Schultz) thought the bill was dead. This feeling was due to its being an election year and since no controversial legislation has been passed so far this year." 
According to Byrne, the lobby efforts were already responsible for getting the bill out of committee. (Last year, Chester Dobis, the chairman of the Public Policy Committee, let the bill die in committee.) 
"We've managed to get the bill further than anyone expected in an election year," Byrne comonented. "And right now the chances for the bill's passage are 50-SO. We'll be returning to Indianapolis on Monday in an attempt to convince more legislators that the bill should be approved.'' 
According to Black, the lobby has also been working this past weekend to have students who live in Indiana to either call or write their legislators to display support for the bill. Letters were delivered in person by the lobbyists to the representatives this morning. 
Might walt one year 
Black revealed another strategy if the support of four more legislators cannot be gained. "We won't hold a vote on the bill if we don't have the necessary votes to pass it," Black stated. 
If that is the case when the House convenes today, Black will ask Rep. Jones to signal to the Speaker of the House, Philip Bainbridge, not to hold a roll call vote. 
"The reason we won't force the vote unless we have 51 votes is because its a liberal issue and if it fails, voting for it could hurt some of our supporters running in the election," Black explained. 
"We'd like to have the people who support the bill to remain in office rather than see them lose their offices by casting a meaningless vote," state

In hunger fight 
World education essential 
by Mary Mungovan Staff Reporter 

"Education in today's world is realizing that every major problem is not only global in content but global in solution," Fr. Theodore Hesburgh. university president, affirmed at a meeting Sunday of the Notre Dame World Hunger Coalition. 
Co-chairmen Barb Robinson and Doug Allen announced that the Coalition's main projects for the semester would be "an education program to inform campus and South Bend communities on the hunger problem and a continuation of the Wednesday Night Fast Program." Approximately 100 attended the meeting in the Library Lounge. 
In his opening speech, Hesburgh stated, "Over 480 million people are undernourished tonight and over 90 million will die of illness related to malnutrition.'' 
"There are three things to be done," he continued. "The U.S. should supply half of the 10 million ton food shortage each year. The global food reserve should be increased and the U.S. should help underdeveloped countries de­velop their own agriculture." 
"Education is our prime focus," Allen stated. "Before we can act on the problems of world hunger, people must become aware not only of the facts but of how it feels to go hungry, even if only for one night a week.'' 
As part of its program of community education, the Coalition will supply speakers, films and literature to schools, parishes and clubs in South Bend and on the Notre Dame-St. Mary's campus, Allen exaplained. 
Robinson announced that educa­tion workshops would be held on Feb. l and Feb. 8, ''to educate coalition members to responsibly inform others about the facts of the world hunger situation." 
"The Coalition will launch an intensified pledge drive in the next two weeks for this semester's dining hall fast program," Allen related. "We hope to reach a goal of 1,000 participants, an increase over last semester's 480," he added. 
In addition, the organization will sponsor a monthly Vegetarian Meal and will publish a monthly newslet­ter with articles on the world food situation and coalition activities. 
Coalition Begun In 1974 

The World Hunger Coalition was created in November, 1974, under the instigation of Fr. Hesburgh. Its purpose, according to Allen, is to "educate campus and South Bend communities about global injust­ice'' and to raise money for the hungry. Money received by the Coalition goes to overseas relief organizations (such as CARE, UN, ICEF, CORR, and Catholic Relief Service) and the poor of South Bend. Allen estimated the Coali­tion had over SO members last semester. 
In addition, approximately 480 students participated in the Wed­nesday Night Fast Program in which the dining hall paid 75 cents per participant per night. Accord­
ing to Chris Brinegar, former 
coalition president, the program 
brought in over $4,000. 
In an Offering of Letters Drive last November, the Coalition urged students to write their senators and congressmen to support a Right-to­Food Resolution. This drive was part of a nationwide letter cam­paign sponsored by Bread for the World, a Christian citizens lobbly. 
According to Greg Gramelspach­er, over 150,000 letters reached Washington, "in the biggest single letter-writing campaign in support of foreign assistance since World War II. As a result, two subcom­mittees -one in the Senate and one in the House -are now scheduling hearings.'' 
National Conference 
Four Coalition members attend­ed the National University Confer­enmce on Hunger, Nov 21-23, in Austin, Texas. the Institute for World Order and Project Dialogue sponsored the conference, the first of its kind on a national scale, attended by 500 students, faculty

Final repeated; students irate 
by Cathy Nolan Staff Reporter 

Many sophomore business ad­ministration students have expres­sed dissatisfaction with the final exam given last semester. The examination, which was used for the Principles of Accounting 221 classes, was identical to that which was used for the first semester of last year. 
A number of complaints have been made by the students to the business department. 
It was discovered, after the final had been given, that it was similar in every respect to last year's examination. Some students had seen the exam prior to the date of the final. Those students who did have a copy of the old test however, were not aware that this year's final was identical. 
The exam which was used was made up by Professor James Wittenbach of the accounting de­partment. It was to be given to the 1974 Principles of Accounting clas­ses. Wittenbach was not teaching any sophomore accounting classes this year and consequently was not involved in the decision to give the same exam. Wittenbach did not become aware of the reuse of the exam until two weeks ago. 
When asked why he though the department used last year's final, Witten bach stated, "It is' only speculation on my part, but the department probably considered the final to be a rigorous, compre­hensive test which would help them to accurately evaluate the student's knowledge of the subject matter." 
According to Wittenbaeh, any student who wished to have his final exam returned to him could do so after the semester had ended. The students were allowed to keep their exams. As a result, some students in last semester's ac­counting classes had access to the test prior to the day of the examination. 
Sophomore Maureen Geary ob­tained a copy of the exam from a junior business major who had Wittenbach last year. Geary, as other students who had seen the test, was completely unaware that the finals would be identical. 
"I asked to look at the final, as an afterthought, as a means of 
reviewing for our final," Geary 
stated. 
Bob Kruse, a sophomore busi­ness major, said that he and several of his friends tried to find a copy of the final with which to review, but were unsuccessful. "We checked the hall test file and various other sources to no avail," he said. 
Of the students who were ques­tioned, none had seen their final exams nor did they know what their exam grades were. The students were not certain as to the effect the exam had upon the outcome of their grades. Several students specualted that the exam scores were overlooked when figuring out 
,semester grades. 
According to the students pres­ently enrolled in Accounting 222, several new guidelines were issued to the classes at the beginning of this semester. All homework must now be passed in to the professor. No previous tests will be used without extensive changes being made in the problems. The professors will not provide any hints or helpful advice in regard to test questions. The tests will be graded on a university curve. 
Also, the students will nol be permitted to use calculators during the examination period. 
It is not known whether any action was taken by the department with regard to the final, in the way of using a special curve or reducing the grade value of the exam. 
Dr. Raymond Powell, accounting department chairman, refused to comment on the matter. Asst. Dean Vince Raymond was unavail­able for comment.

Goltz lectures at SMC 

by Jean O'Meara Staff Reporter 

Patricia Goltz, the founder and international president of Femin­ists for Life delivered a low-keyed personal account of what makes a woman liberated to a near capacity audience yesterday afternoon. 
As a former member of the National Organization for Women [NOW] who was expelled for her public views against abortion, Goltz along with Cathy Callaghan, professor of Linguistics at Ohio State University, founded a new feminist movement which among other positive views, stresses pro­life. 
Since the Women's Liberation Movement has gained strength in numbers and power since its inception, some of its original goals have been lost, according to Goltz. In earlier years, a woman was liberated if she had "a choice in marrying and raising a family or 
having a professional career." But 
today, according to Goltz, the woman is liberated only if she has a professional career in mind. It is Goltz' intention to bring back the original goals to the feminist movement. 
In order to make this a reality, she conceives of a practical way for each individual woman to realize her own liberation; how society can help women in attaining their goals; and finally, how the Femin­ists for Life group is attempting to meet these challenges. 
As an individual, a woman has got to have self-discipline. Without this basic ingredient, she cannot be liberated. For the key to carrying out one's choice is in planning the future. If "overriding instincts" take over, we can never achieve our goals, Goltz explained. This attri­bute must be allied with "a personal, well-thought out ethical code with well-defined absolutes." 
Turning to the society in which woman finds herself, Goltz said that the industrial world must now reshape itself in order to suit the needs of a family unit which must not be isolated one from the other over long periods. 
According to Goltz, woman must learn to live in harmony with her body. Industry must find a place to welcome the working family's chil­dren and the medical profession must find a way to help the woman live in harmony with her body. 
The Feminists for Life are at­tempting to meet these challenges by attempting to set up a national grant which would support the mother's need for developing her own· resources and talents in the home. Research in her own field: the arts, music, pottery, ecology 
It is Patricia Goltz' intention to bring bad< the original goals to the feninisf 
rmvement (photo by Chris Snith). could be carried out and supported by the woman who wants to remain at home with her growing family. Other goals which the Feminists for Life want to see realized are better day care centers which would focus on self-discipline for the child, emphasizing the Monte­sorri method, and a possible facility 
within industrial centers whtch would accommodate working fam­ily's children. 
Patricia Goltz is married to the Senior Vice President and Systems Programmer for Compu-Serv Net­work in Columbus, Ohio, and is the mother of four children.

Pittsburgh Celebrates Super Bo'Wl victory 
By LEE GOULD Associated Press Writer 

PITTSBURGH CAP> -The streets of downtown Pittsburgh, deserted during the Super Bowl, overflowed with several thousand jubilant fans Sunday night despite temperatures in the low teens. 
City police, veterans of past victory celebrations here, moved with dispatch to close the downtown area and dis­perse crowds. 
There were at least a dozen arrests as police shoved dis­orderly persons into the backs of police vans. 
At 5 p.m., as the Steelers were clinching their second straight Super Bowl in Miami, downown Pittsburgh was vir­tually empty -except for riot­helmeted police gathered at key intersections. 
By 6 p.m. traffic was bump­
er-to-bumper with horn-blowing 
cars overflowing with cheering 
fans. 
Police moved quickly. 
"Don't let nothing into town," the police dispatcher ordered shortly after 6. "You're a little late,"' an anonymous police offi­cer responded. "That's for sure," another radioed. 
The crowd wasn't deterred by temperatures that hovered around 10 degrees by early eve­ning. 
A largely young crowd of fans quickly formed on Liberty Avenue, the city's major street, shouting "We're Number One," climbing onto light posts and dancing in the street. 
But police brought in snarling dogs and quickly cleared the street, forcing people onto side­walks, where a few lobbed beer · bottles toward patrol cars. Many of the retreating crowd changed their cheers to another 
Steeler ·favorite -"Defense, 
ueu~nse." 
Downtown hotels also were ready for the celebration. The Pittsburgh Hilton was locked to anyone who couldn't produce a room key and registration receipt at the main lobby doors. 
The city is preparing for an­other demonstration Monday ­this one organized. The city has planned a welcome-home pa­rade Monday afternoon when the team returns from Miami.

DOONESBURY by Garry Trudeau 

good business for CIA 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiart buchwald 
WASHINGTON--Many stories have come our about tL LIA, but this is one that is still buried secretly in the archives. It has to do with an agent named Greensleeves. He was young, energetic and imaginative. The CIA decided to set him up in a souvenir shop across the street from the palace of a South American dictator where he could keep tabs on the comings and goings of government officials. 
They gave him enough money to buy the shop and the souvenirs so the operation would be legitimate. This exchange of cables, after they were decoded, tells the story. 
"CIA Headquarters, Langley: Business excellent. Have sold $16,000 worth of souvenirs thanks to Dictator Tacos three-day anniversary celebration in front of palace. Please tell our people in Taiwan I need more Tacos ashtrays, paperweights and letter openers. If all right with you, am planning a sale on Dictator Tacos music boxes that play 'South of the Border' .--Greensleeves." "Green~leeves: Paella, South Arned~a:Giad to hear you are doing well busmessw1se, but what the hell Is going on at the palace? We hear Tacos may be overthrown by right-wing colonels. Please advise at once.--Frogrnaster." 
"CIA Headquarters, Langley: Sorry I have been too busy taking inventory to pay much attention to palace but good news. Discovered a factory outside Siesta that makes cuckoo clocks and hand-painted scarves. Have bought three gross at half-price. Expect sales figures in June up 20 percent over May. Had to pay off customs to get cigarette lighters mto country, but will add bribe to price of itern.--Greensleeves." 
"Greensleeves, Paella, South America: Why no word from you on Tacos assassination attempt and his exile from country? Who is in charge of Paella? Urgently need list of junta and whether it's pro-or anti-Arnerican.--Frogrnaster." 
"CIA Headquarters, Langley: Agency has nothing to fear from Tacos overthrow. I got wind of it two weeks ago and had Tacos Birthday Sale oin Saturday, where I marked down all Dictator Tacos items 50 percent. The bronze busts moved especially well as did Tacos pillowcases. We also unloaded 4,000 plates with portraits of Mrs. Tacos. Only item that didn't sell as well as expected was night light of Tacos standing next to Virgin Mary. But I plan to remove Tacos and just sell them as Virgin Mary night lights. Tell our Hong Kong people that I am sending them photograph of Colonel Chili which I would like then to have framed with sea shells. Also need 3,000 beer mugs commemorating the junta's revolution of July 5. By the way, tell our Hong Kong man to check packing. The ashtrays they sent carne in all damaged. Am seeing insurance company tornorrow--Greensleeves.'' 
"Greensleeves, Paella, South America: What information do you have conerning naval attack on Paella by neighboring country of Enchilada? Understand shelling destroyed half of downtown as well as Soviet, British, French and Chinese ernbassies.--Frogrnaster" 
"CIA Headquarters, Langley: Your information correct. I heard about it 10 days ago from Enchilada defector and moved all breakable items to the basement. Also boarded up windows. You'll be happy to know we had the only souvenir shop in Paella that opened for business the next day. Since the invasion started I have added a toy line with tanks, soldiers, missiles and fighter planes. Believe they will be big sellers. Took it on myself to give 10 percent discount to any Paella soldier or sailor in uniform. Have also ordered music boxes which say 'Mother' on the top in Spanish. Understand Mother items sell well in time of war." 
"Greensleeves, Paella, South America: What has happened to 
U.S. ambassador? Is he being held hostage by revolutionary urban guerillas as reported by AP* UPI, Reuters and Agence France Presse?" 
"CIA Headqurters, Langley: U.S. ambassador was kidnaped three days ago. Qne of my salespeople has a brother who told her about kidnaping plans last week. I immediately took steps to check his charge account. He owed us $89. On a ruse that we were collecting accounts receviable early this year, I managed to get his check before he was grabbed. We haven't lost a dime on him. Any chance of shipping Fidel Castro coffee mugs? They're expecting 15,000 male Cuban tourists, and it could be a big item this summer."
