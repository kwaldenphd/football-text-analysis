Academic Council to hold meeting 
A spedal meeting of the A~:ademic Council of the Uni­versity will be held al 2:30 this afternoon to consider the Aca­demic Freedom proposal sub­mitted at last Thursday's general student meeting. 
The proposal would grant studt:n ts who wish to discon­tinue classes the option of laking either the h.:tter grade they presently hold as their final grade or a pass-fail grade. The proposal also suggests that in "classes where the pass-fail alter­native is chosen, that grading method will apply to all students wishing to discontinue." 
The decision as to which option would be taken would be decided by the individual faculty members in ~:onjunction with his class. 
The proposal will allow for the continuation of regularly s~:heduled classes for those mem­bers of the student body who feel a commitment to do so. 
As submitted to the student assembly Thursday, the petition stressed, "It is the purpose of this proposal to present an alternative, positive approach for the continuation of the educa­tive process at the University of Notre Dame, whkh will not hinder the a~:ademic freedom of any student but will also con­tinue activities in the spirit of the strike -con~:erning the Amerit:an military escalation in Indo-China." 
There will be a rally on the main quad at I:30 before the Council convenes at 2:30. 
Student Body President Dave KrJ.shna will int10duce tile speakers and voice Student Government support for the proposal. Bob Schmuhl will read the proposal itself. Jim Leary will discuss the campus-wide at:tivities that will he substituted fnr normal class routine. Steve Preston will attempt to explain the proposal in the wake of similar actions taken at other universities across the nation. 
Copies of the petition will be distributed at the I: 30 rally and will be posted in Library, Nieuw­land and O'Shaughnessy HaJls, the business and engineering buildings and in strike head­quarters in LaFortune for signa­tures. 
The members of the Council arc the President of the Univer­sity, the Executive Vice Presi­dent, ;,II other Vice Presidents, the Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs, the Chairman of the Faculty Senate, the Assistant Vice President for Academic Affairs, the Deans, the Diret:tors of the University In­stitutes, the Director of the Libraries, the Director of Ad­missions, all of whom are mem­bers ex-officio, and elected faculty members in number equal to that of the ex-officio positions. 
As of 6:00 last night, Schmul said, 1558 students had been contacted on campus. Of these 1382 signed the petition fav­oring the proposal. Schmul said, this means about 88% of the students contacked have signed the proposal.

Petition Goins Support 
by ~teve Effler 
Last night, Fred Dedrick out­lined the scope and future of the canvassing effort generated hy President Nixon's recent action in Indo-China. Dedrick ex­plained that although the can­vassers have so far collected approximately 16,000 signatures to Fr. Hesburgh's anti-war peti­tion, the long range plans will be less parochial in aim. 
College campuses across the country are becoming centers for the propagation of a bill in the US Senate sponsored by Senators Goodell, Hatfield, Bayh and McGovern. This effort has its National office at Harvard, and regional office here at Notre Dame. The bill would call for a cessation of Military funds for 

U of W Head Opts for Discussion 
MADISON, Wis (UPI) ­An alternative to closing the troubled University of Wisconsin campus were announced yester­day by Chancellor H. Edwin Young who said a total effort will he made to examine critical issues through rational dis­cussions.' The announcement came during the calm that settled over the campus during the weekend after nearly a week of violent clashes between antiwar protes­tors and law enforcement officers. Radical Abbie Hoffman, a member of the "Chicago Seven," was to speak last night at a rally denouncing U.S. inolvement in Southeast Asia and the killing of four Kent State University students last week. Young, who Saturday refused to close the campus in the face of threats to do so by radical students and a faculty minority, det:lared the week beginning today a "week of concern and involvement." He said he made his decision 
after receiving many suggestions on how to handle the crises and said he was "particularly conscious of the views of the faculty expressed on Friday." 
"Today and Tuesday I call on members of the university community, students and faculty, to devote themselves to examination of critical issues and take part in rational discussions Young said. "Academic pursuits which cannot be postponed may continue and others may be made up May 26-27." 
Young said the governor and congressmen will he invited to participate in campus events during the last three days of the school week. He did not say what those events would he. 
Young said a campus poll would be taken for individuals to make their views known and he was asking the faculty to reschedule any exams this week to a later date. 
Young said President Fred H. Harrington has also offered the use of all university fa~o:ilities to "carry highlights of the Madison t:ampus programs to other UW Campuses and people of the state." Young also said he was asking local radio and television time to elaborate on plans for this week as they evolve. 
The lull gave university administrators and student leaders a chance to discuss the situation Saturday night in a closed meeting. 
Afterward, UW Chancellor H. Edwin Young announced the 35,000 student campus would remain open despite moves by a minority of the faculty and threats by radical students to 
close it.~·--------------------, 
HARTKE TO SPEAK 
Senator Vance Hartke, dovish democrat from Indiana, will speak in Stepan Center this evening at 8:00. Bob Pohl, head of the Student Union, arranged for Senator Hartke to speak here. Rev. Theodore Hesburgh will introduce Senator Hartke. The Senator's speech will be concerned with the events of the last week. A question and answer period will follow his speech. 
Cambodian operations by July 
first of this year. All funds for 
Indo-Chinese warfare would end 
by July first of next year. 
With the change of emphasis, 
Dedrick said that the canvass 
would go on. Despite what may 
happen to the strike itself, the 
goal of canvassing the whole of 
South Bend's 43,000 homes and 
St. Joseph County's 83,274 will 
be pursued. 
In addition there will be leafleting campaigns downtown tomorrow urging attendence at the speech to be given by Senator Vance Hartke at the Stepan Center tonight at 8:00. Dedrick also mentioned an up­coming speech by historian Staughton Lynd but did not indicate any definite plans for its treatment by the canvassing group. 
When asked about the effect of the approaching end of the school year on the efforts of the group, Dedrick was optimistic about long term benefits. He claimed that most of the 20 organizers and the hard core of about 300 canvassers should be back next year. Dedrick said organization would be available for the support of Liberal candidates Hartke and Brademas. 
One important aspect of the campaign for those who don't come back next year will be the projected discussion of organiza­tional aspects slated for the end of the school year. The ex­perience of the group here at Notre Dame should be useful for those who wish to mount similar campaigns in whatever Con­gressional district next November finds them in, he said. 
In the massive effort of canvassing 25,000 homes so far, Dedrit:k said that project has had "the cooperation of a lot of great students" both in the office and in the field. In talking to some of the canvassers from Fisher, it seems that their reactions were equally favorable. One senior called it the "most important educational ex­meeting the famous "middle American" and showing him that the stereotype of the concerned student as lawless radical was not true.

NDmldwest Info HQ for econ boycott 
by Tom Huffendick 
Notre Dame has been esta­blished as the Midwest Regional Clearing House for Information on the Economic Boycott. States in the Notre Dame region include Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Kentucky, North Dakota, and South Dakota. 
According to Mike Fallon, one of the Clearing House coordinators, at least 40 schools introduced proposals for an economic boycott last week, but NO, U.C.L.A., and Massachusetts' Clark University emerged to lead it. C'lark will coordinate the boyt:Ott national­ly, while U.C.L.A. will function as West Coast headquarters. 
Dick Gregory has been select­ed as Honorary National Coordi­nator for the effort. Gregory, who has long supported sut:h a boycott, was contacted Saturday night by two Notre Dame students, Mike Shaugnessy and Steve Raymond. 

The boycott's purpose is two­fold, according to the Clearing House. First, it is intended to exert economic pressure upon specific, youth oriented com­panics to gain their support in Congress for withdrawal of American troops in Southeast Asia. 
The boycott is also intended to encourage the curtailment of the purt:hase of items which

McGrath states opposition to Viet war 
by Jeanne Sweeney 

Father  John  J.  McGrath,  
president  of  St.  Mary's,  
addressed  the  SMC  community  
yesterday  afternoon at the sug­ 

gestion of the Academic Affairs Council and the students from the Strike Committee. 
First commenting on his own personal attitude toward war, Father McGrath said that during the first World War he had served and had not been a pacifist. He said "I didn't like the military service and I didn't like to see men killed." But he was convinced that what they' had done was necessary. 
After the Korean war of attrition he said "I felt we should never again get into a situation like the Korean war." 
Father McGrath said that he had been "against the war. in Viet Nam since it started. He also commented on our escala­tion in Cambodia as a mistake. 
He said that there was very little difference of opinion be­tween the strikers and himself concerning the fact that the war should be brought to an end as soon as possible. 
Concerning the situation at St. Mary's, he said "I am extremely pleased with several things." He approved of the non-violent nature of the strikers and said the community was doing things in an intelligent way. 
He said "it is remarkable the real intellectual conflict which has taken place." McGrath also said he was pleased that people have had an opportunity to express themselves. He added that it was unfortunate that people only become concerned in a crisis of this type. 
McGrath said that the college and the umversity were meant to be a place where America thinks and he added that what we are thinking is certainly getting attention. 
Father McGrath said that his obligation in times like these as

president of a college was to keep this community open..He said "it is my first obligation as president to keep alive and in continuing dialogue." 
He added that it was impor­tant that we do not trample on the tights of our fellow students and faculty. Students who were committed to very strong action, he said must be free to do this, without fear of disiplinary ac­tions if they chose to withdraw from school for the rest of the semester. 
Concerning the cut policy Me Grath said he was not about to tell a professor what his policy should be or to interfere with his academic rights. Concerning some student's fears that their teachers will f1unk them because of their political views, McGrath said that he had .confidence that his faculty would not flunk a student who doesn't think that way. 
After talking to the students, 

McGrath answered questions 
from the students. Carol Cusick 
questioned McGrath about the idea of a Communiversity which is an alternative or supplemen­tary educational and cultural program centering on this national crisis which affects every citizen. lt would be an effort by the academic com­munity to discuss the Indo-China war issues and the communiversity will hopefully join with the outside community in their discussions. 
Concerning the St. Edward's proposal which would permit those who wish to strike to hold informal classes in the morning and in the afternoon go out into the community, McGrath said that such a proposal will be submitted to the Academic Affairs council emergency meeting. 
McGrath was also questioned on the possibility of a student and her teacher working out a special arrangement so that she could strike her classes for the rest of the semester. McGrath said that he did not intend to tell a faculty member what his policy should be.

Editorial: 
Academic Freedom 
Thursday's decision to continue the strike was a recognition on the part of the striking students that, at times, one's position as a student, separa~e _f~~m the real world with its real problems, is a failure to accept the responstbthtles of citizenship. 
Our responsibility to become educated regarding the problems_ of our society and our concommitant responsibility to take that educatiOn and apply it to potential solutions of our problems goes beyond the class room. 
A vote to continue the strike was also a vote to take positive, constructive action which hopefully will culminate in the withdraw! of our troops from. Indo-China. The letter writing campaign, initiated in Keenan hall, and the canvass of South Bend businesses and residences in support of Father Hesburgh's declaration are but two such constructive actions. There are others, such as the proposal to recess classes before the November election to allow students to work for the candidates of their choice. 
The university Academic Council this afternoon will have a chance to legitimize this non-classroom education. It is entirely within its realm to do so. As set down in tpe Faculty Manual, two of the functions of the council are "to determine general academic policies and regulations of the University," and "to authorize the establishment, modification, or discontinuance of any academic organization of the University." 
We feel that in a time when our country is seething with anger, anger toward the Presjdent's policies on the one hand, and anger toward the critics of that policy on the other, it is time to sanction substantive and educative actions on the part of the academic community. 
We urge the Academic Council to support the resolution for Academic Freedom submitted to it today. The proposal requires no one to participate in these actions. It. merely recognizes the academic freedom of those who wish to participate in a wider education.

Campus Opinion 
The following is a position paper on ROTC disputing tlze view 
set forth in an article which I published last week. It is written 
by Steve Massey, a Notre Dame student. 
The presence of ROTC units on the nation's campuses1 which Mr. Corso has endeavored to defend, is indicative of the extent to which both the university and the nation have lost sight of what they might have become. Gen. Woolnough's statement that students have a "right" to prepare themselves for military service in college, and his implication that the university should somehow respond to this "right" manifests a complete misunderstanding of what a university should be doing. Such a statement reveals that Gen. Woolnough completely ignores the possibility that complicity with the government in the training of its soldiers is simply not something that the university should be about. This crassly unquestioning attitude could only be adopted by a mind nurtured on that peculiarly American perversion of the concept of the university fostered by the government's intervention into higher education beginning with the Morrill Act of 1862 and continuing to our own day. The fundamental objection to this notion of the university, as Mr. Robert Hut<chins has pointed out, is that "it takes the society as given, with all its folly and pretentiousness, and asks the university to supply some of the facilities, most of the hands, a lot of the 
energy, and all of the ideas that will enable the society to achieve its mistaken goals." The university is not the service station of society. It is not an institution wavering like a reed before the fluctuating whims of the masses, nor is it the training ground for fut11re members of the establishment. It is, on the contrary, an institution with a strictly circumscribed realm, a realm which is determined by the id.ea which uniquely characterizes the university. And this idea is the development of the intellect and the critical faculties. Despite the fact that the cultivation of the intellect as the unique task of the university has been obscured' by decades of attempts to achieve the American Dream, this does not alter the fact that much of what is offered at this university, as well as at most of the others, is not ed~cation at all, but vocational training. ROTC is thus not only a prostitution of the individual's intellect in favor of the attainment of transitory and worthless goals, it also represents the debasement of the sole institution in society oriented toward the cultivation of the intellect. 
·Not only does Gen. Woolnough not understand the concept of a university, he also ignores th~ fact that the attack on ROTC is intimately related to a unilateral repudiation of the governmental priorities of the last two decades. During this period, the Military Establishment has been the instrument for the imposition of a foreign policy which desregards the desires of indigenous populations, and of a domestic policy which perpetrates· the enslavement of minorities in bondage since their arrival. Nixon's expansion of the war into Cambodia signals his continued intention to disregard the pleas that the war be terminated and a reaffirmation of the existing reprehensible policy. 
Considering how the Military has been utilized in the past decade, and from all appearances, how it will continue to be used, the ROTC units present themselves as a natural focal point of protest and cncerted effort for their removal. Somewhat later in the article from which Mr. Corso quote~, Gen. Woolnough states: "From the Army's hard business viewpoint elimination of credit could make the course Jess attractive to the type of student we want to recruit and therefore hurt the program." If the Military is apprehensive about efforts to remove academic credit from their courses, they would certainly be even more anxious about the complete disaffiliation of 
ROTC from campuses, especially in light of the fact that ROTC provides two-thirds of General Service Officers. The burden put on the Military Establishment by the complete sundering of university relations with ROTC units would be a suitable first step in the regeneration of the university, and because of the limitations it would place on the ability of America to expand its empire, perhaps on the country as a whole.

New myth an~ Old Reality 


There are few things more enjoyable than a good case of irony; and there's nothing more ironic than a good hypocritical shift of rhetoric. For years and years now the Constitution has been a symbol appropriated by conservatives, and never failed to appear in any speech or publication by the American Legion and such groups. Every Fourth of July the ol' time patriots dragged out the venerable document to he lauded endlessly, and dubs sponsored speech contests on why the 
U.S. Constitution is the best. Now -lo and behold -what to our wondering eyes doth appear, but...the anti-war demonstrators(of all people) appealing to the Constitution as if it were the Bible or Koran or something, and apparently in absolute anguish at the dastardly descration of our noble supreme law by the traitorous President of our nation. What a switch! 
Thomas Jefferson was a "strict contructionist", but he sent the U.S. Navy to fight the Barbary pirates without so much blinking at Congress. The story is told of Lincoln that at one War Cabinet meeting he announced the vote on a measure he approved "seven nays, one aye-the ayes have it". Congress received somewhat less attention than this during that war, in which the President acted throughout virt u<tlly as he pleased, on the basis of his power as comm<tnder-in-chief. Did Congress declare war in Korea -or does a liberal darling like the U.N. make unconstitutional actions legal? 
l.et 's fact it -the contention that Nixon has acted unconstitutionally is merely an indication that the anti-warriors are running out of objections to the war and out of excuses for their activity, and having been unsuccessful so far, are starting to grasp at the frailest of straws.ln foreign and military affairs the President is the leader who provides speed and unity of action, and this is why the Supreme Court itself has upheld Presidential prerogative in these areas (Wright-Curtiss, 1956). 
If you mother was dying from heart failure, would you want the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to be responsible for analysing the situation and recommending action? You'd probably end up with a compromise prescription to get a lot of rest and transplant half a heart. If a camel is a horse designed by a committee, then I'd hate to see a war designed by a Senate committee ("half wanted to attack on the right flank, and half wanted to attack on the left flank; so we compromised and ordered an attack on the center"). 
Why all tbese sudden appeals the the Constitution? Where were these shouts of "unconstitutionality" from the left when other, more liberal Presidents have done things with fewer precedents? (Franklin Roosevelt was defeated in the Supreme Court on several issues, but you can bet that public opinion among liberals was not outraged at the doubtful constitutionality of his proposals.) 
The problem with the present accusation is that they ignore the spirit and tradition of the Constitution, and employ even the letter rather doubtfully. In view of the weakness of this case, it should at least, if nothing more, he put forward with less righteous indignation. Calls for impeachment of President Nixon on these grounds deserve nothing but contempt. The use of these arguments to justify illegal activities such as draft-dodging should also be recognized as shallow. 
While it is true that many put forward accusations of unconstitutionality quite sincerely, it is nut surprising to find many who are only using them to confuse the issue, knowing full well that they are not justified. In the case of those who are merely uninformed there is hope that study will correct the situation. In the case of those who a.re so convinced that their correctitude that they use any means to attain their ends -including false arguments -it is more difficult to foresee a hopeful conclusion.

At that time, Jesus was teaching in Jerusalem, and a scribe came unto Him, saying, "Master, we know you teach the truth and have no regard for any man. Tell us, is it right to pay the pull tax?" 
And Jesus said unto him, "Show Me the coin of the realm." And the coin was brought. Then Jesus commanded, "Read to me the inscription about the head of Ceasar." 
And the scrihe read, "Ceasar Augustus, Emperor and God." 
Then Jesus said, "Take then your coin, and depart, for it is written 'I am the Lord thy God, Thou shalt not have strange gods before me.' Therefore I say unto you, no Jew shall do traffick with the Roman Empire, for they are murderers and idolators, and they cannot govern us." 
Then the Pharisees sent to Pilate, but whilst they did this, the Jews drew close to Christ, and he addressed them, saying, "We see about us the forces of oppression. Roman troops patrol our cities, Roman taxes take our money. The Romans are idolatrous imperialists. They kill the Gauls in Europe, and they kill our brothers here. They seek to extend their empire to encompass the Earth, to take gold and treasures from our brothers to the East. But we are not Romans, we are Jews. We shall rise up, a proud and noble people. Vinceramos!" 
Then Simon Peter, and !lames began to pass among the people exhorting them to sign their names to petitions declaring the Jewish nation independeant of the Roman Empire and vowing not tri pay the poll tax or any other taxes_contributing to the extension of the Empire. 
Then Jesus spake, saying, "I say this unto you. This land must be free. The Roman troops must be driven from this land, for I say unto you, though you shall have faith to move mountains, what shall it avail you if Roman soldiers walk through our streets'? Though you be at peace with your brother and God, what shall it avail you if you have naught to eat?" 
Then Judas lscariot passed among the people, taking up alms, that they might have money for the revolution. 
Then Peter addressed the crowd, telling them of raids that had been led against the caravans of the pharisees and James told them of raids against the Roman outposts. 
Then the people cheered, proclaiming Him the Messiah who would remove the scourge of Roman domination and make of them a mighty nation. 
But then the Romans arrived, and there fell upon the people a great slaughter, but the disciples withdrew to the house of Joseph of Arimathea and Jesus was safe. And after, He went out to the families of thOse who were slain, and praised their dead, saying, "This day shall they be with the Father in heaven."

Faculty Members OpenQuad Forum 
by Steve lazar 
With comments on "repres­sion," "resistance," and "moral decline," the local communiver­sity was opened yesterday with speeches by three members of the Notre Dame faculty out on the main quad. 
Paul Rathburn, Sam Shapiro and James Douglass told a group of assembled students their rea­sons for supporting the strike and the communiversity, which is dedicated to the memory of both the dead of South East Asia and those who have died for peace at home. 
Speaking first, Mr. Rathburn of the English Department said he has become convinced "that the protests in this country must go on and on and on." 
Referring to the Cambodian situation, Rathburn said he feared that once again · the president might be "chasing the mirage of a military victory." He cited the horrors of the Vietnam war by saying that there is nothing more shocking in "The Ris6 and Fall of the Third Reich" than in the report of the My Lai incident in "Harper's" magazine. 
Rathburn outlined what he called "an atmosphere of repression" in the United States that has been growing as the ciicism of the Vietnam war continue to mount. He said that the Nixon Administration has been trying to muzzle not only the press and the Protesters, but also the U.S. Senate and the Black Panthers. 

Sam Shapiro of the History Department spoke next on what he called "the moral decline and fall of the U.S. within the last fifty years." 
He said the increased killing of civilians by the use of mass murder weaponry since World War I has plunged the western world into "a downward trend of morality." "We have become a callous nation," he said. 
Shapiro read a number of figures to support his claim. He said that in World War I 10,000,000 people were killed, 5% being civilians. In World War II, he said, the toll rose to 50,000,000 dead with 50% from; the civilian populations. Then in the Korean War the civilian death rate rose to 84%. The Vietnam war. he said. is sure to 
surpass even this figure. 
Shapi ro discussed two accounts of mass bombings on the cities of Dresden and Tokyo in World War II. He said that in Dresden 135,000 people were killed, but the attack was judged a failure militarily. In one attack on Tokyo, he said, 334 bombers, each loaded with 2000 pounds of fire bombs, attacked the city, making it so hot that people seeking refuge from the fires in a creek were boiled. "This is against international law, this is against morality," he said. 
Concluding that this country now has a commitment not to life but to a ',way of death," Shapiro said that he supported' the student strike "as one way of bringing the build up of weapons of annihilation to an end."

Following Shapiro to the speaker's stand was James 

Douglass of the Program for Non-violence. 
Douglass asserted that "the moral leadership of Notre Dame has been taken over by tne students." He then launched into his deeply Christian and philosophical address on the subject of "resistance." 
Douglass said that for man to resist the "forces of untruth" he must first abandon himself to the "wilderness" to seek "contemplation" just as Jesus had done in the desert before his public career. In the wilderness, he said, man can receive the "spirit" through solitude and contemplation. The spirit is necessary, he added, to make the sacrifices required for "living out the truth." 


SMC Sophs to fill posts 
Should sophomores "sail with the ship of experience" or play ball with "the team with new ideas"? This choice will face them Tuesday when they vote for class officers. 
Campaigning with Mary Jo 
Ferlini, freshman class senator, 
and Pat Haffey, freshman class 
representative on the student 
assembly, Sue Welte believes 
that "experience is the key." 
Defending this year's govern­
ment as "an effective social 
organization," Miss Welte plans 
to implement the present struc­
ture with academic proposals. 
She would expand class interest into academics with "gab-fests," between students and teachers, and an academic committe. Advised by a sopho­more student assemblyman, this committee would act as a "bridge between class govern­ment and student government." 
Billed as "the team with new 
ideas," Julie Webb, Joan Organ, 
and Kathy Kane also propose 
dialogues not only with faculty 
and students, but also with the 
academic commissioner con­
cerning academic requirements. 
Becuase of its "experience" with ND freshman class govern­ment this year, Miss Welte's ticker advocates that "social activities be conducted through hall governments instead of through the class senate." Her ticket also urges greater "utiliza­tion of the social commission" through introduction of sub-committees. 
Conceding that "the N.D. freshman senate was not as successful as it could have been in its social attempts with St. Mary's," Miss Webb would con­tinue to work with them. "We feel that class to class contacts are most workable," her plat­form claims. 
She would retain the small 
group activities and initiate a 
soda! commission. 
Although Miss Welte confines herself to social and academic plans, Miss Webb's platform includes proposals on class government and community relations. 
Besides continuing the class senate, she advocates a council of class officers representing all four classes to "promote better relations." 
In community relations, she 
proposes a "little sister program 
set up with underprivileged girls 
in the South Bend area.
