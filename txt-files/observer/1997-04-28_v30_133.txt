Leaving ND 

but not behind 
One of the cardinal 
rules we're taught here  Catherine Deely  
at the unofficial jour­ Accenr Copy Ediror  
nalism school known as  

The College Newspaper is, simply, don't 
write about yourself. Your stories are never 
as interesting (or, for that matter, impor­
tant) to the impatient audience as they are 
to you in your blissful delusions of grandeur. 
Yet for once in my writing "career," I am going to knowingly violate that rule. Maybe because, while this column is, in a sense, directly related to me, I think it contains a little grain of truth that might, and perhaps should, be applied to anyone and everyone who has been a part of this place. 
Simply put, I am not coming back to ND next year. I am neither a graduating senior nor an adventurer about to embark on a voyage overseas. I am leaving ND for anoth­er school, a well-respected, if smaller, liber­al arts college closer to home "back East." 
Since I've made my choice, I've been con­fronted by a colorful bombardment of guess­es at mv true m·otives for leaving. What shocked me was the suggestion that I might "hate" Notre Dame. 
Nothing could be more in contention with the truth. 
I could stray even further from the path of journalistic correctness and go into a tire­some presentation of my many and varied reasons, but I refuse even to stoop to that level. Why I'm going isn't at all important to this column. What I'll think about after I do, is. 
I do not regret my decision whatsoever, because I know, deep down inside, that it is the right move. 
What I fear most, however, is the bitter­sweetness I think will accompany my nostal­gia every time I think about this place. 
Nowhere in this world is like Notre Dame. I voice that opinion freely because I know in my heart that it rings true. I will miss all of the view book staples: the serenity of the Grotto, the beauty of the lakes, the inde­scribable clamor on football weekends. I will miss the comfort, the simplicity, and the pride that has been borne of four semesters as a part of this student body. 
But what I will truly miss, most of all, is something far more personal and far less mystical. I will miss the people. 
from the laughter that kept me awake through Calc and Core to the unbounded dialogues at the dining hall ... from the crazy antics to the heart-to-heart chats on late nights ... from my Big 0 colleagues to my Big Sister-I have been touched, and I have been changed by the people who have entered my life through the portal of ND. I will never forget any of you. 
Luckiest of all for me, I have found four people who not only display a miraculous gift for entertaining me, but amazingly seem to understand me as well. Katie, Kathy, Jess, Rita-you wanted your names in print. and you deserve it. To me, you are what ND, in its most magical sense, truly stands for. 
So I am leaving Notre Dame, but I refuse to leave it behind. It has, to an extent, made me the person I am now. 
I may be taking myself in a new direction, but I will never let what I have learned, and what I have loved here slip away.

Zaire rebels give UN two months to track down refugees 

KISANGANI, Zaire 
Zaire's rebel leader ordered up to 100,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees out of Zaire on Sunday, giving the United Nations two months to track them down and send them home. 

Laurent Kabila promised that international officials would have full access to search for the tens of thou­sands of refugees, whose fate is still unknown after they dispersed into the jungle when their camps allegedly came under attack last week. 
A few hundred refugees have been found. Some of these refugees said Zairian villagers attacked the camps with machetes, killing hundreds, and say Kabila's forces opened fi:e on at least one camp. 
Authorities evacuated the first 40 of the refugees on Sunday, flying them directly from Kisangani to the Rwandan capital of Kigali, according to representatives of the U.N. refugee agency. 
Kabila's fighters previously had blocked a planned U.N. airlift of the starving, disease-ridden refugees, saying in part that the refugee flights would interfere with his troops' movements. 
But in talks with U.N. officials Sunday 
in Kisangani, Kabila abruptly gave the 
United Nations two months to collect 
and evacuate the refugees, Filippo 
Grandi of the U.N. refugee agency said. 
Kabila said the airlift could use any air­
port except the rebel-held airport in 
Goma on the Rwandan border, Grandi 
said. 
It was not clear what would happen 
to the refugees if they remained in 
Zaire after the 60-day deadline, the 
countdown for which starts May 1. 
The refugee camps, crammed with 
100,000 starving, exhausted and dis­
ease-ridden refugees days earlier, were 
found eerily deserted last week, five 
days after rebels sealed off the area to 
foreign aid workers and journalists. ­
"We are going tomorrow to tho camps. We've been given access," said European Union envoy Aldo Ajello said after he and U.N. representatives talked with Kabila. 
Rebels say they a11e keeping some refugees under mili­tary protection at undisclosed locations. Soldiers lined the Zaire River near the camps south of Kisangani late Saturday, apparently looking for the Rwandan Hutus. 
Clinton a real comedian at dinner 
WASHINGTON If the adage that every joke carries an ,.,.......,...,.....,.,,.,.,.--., 
element of truth is accurate, then President Clinton is in trouble. Appearing before 3,000 journalists, politicians and celebrities at a gala din­ner Saturday night, Clinton read an ersatz White House memo detailing how donors who give $10,000 can have the privilege of meeting with AI Gore to 

discuss reinventing government. "And for $20,000 you don't have to go," Clinton punch-lined. The black-tie crowd at the 83rd annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner loved Clinton's shtick. The event assembles Washington's media elite, who then try to impress each other by bringing along sensational guests. While comedian Jon Stewart provided the formal entertainment, Clinton's jokes at the expense of his administration and Congress elicited plenty of chuckles. Not even 17 -year-old daughter Chelsea could escape her father's high jinks. "The bad news is our only child is going off to college," Clinton said mournfully. Then, perkily: "The good news is, it opens up another bedroom.'' 
Indiana man dies in elevator accident 
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. 
Staff members at the Indiana Veterans Home have taken up a collection for the fiancee and baby girl of a worker who died following an elevator accident. Handy Reed, 23, was atop an elevator car with two other employees of Louisville, Ky.-based Abell Elevator Co. on Monday when the car moved for unknown reasons from the basement to the first floor of MacArthur Hall. Reed, of Albany, lost his balance and fell between the car and the shaft. lie died Friday afternoon at St. Elizabeth Medical Center due to complications from his injuries. Abell was renovating the elevator to bring it up to stan­dards of the Americans with Disabilities Act. An employ­ee at Abell's Indianapolis of!ice said Reed's accident was the first of its kind for the company. The Indiana Occupational Safety and Health Administration is investi­gating. 


Police officer sentenced to 450 years 
HIO DE JANEIHO, Brazil 
A judge sentenced a former police officer convicted Sunday of massacring 21 residents of a Hio slum to almost 450 years in prison, saying his actions "demeaned all values of human existence." Under Brazilian law, however, Paulo Huberto Alvarenga cannot serve more than 30 years. Still, the symbolic 449 years and eight months was seen by some relatives and human rights activists as a positive sign for the dozens more trials to follow. Alvarenga was among 52 policemen accused in the 1993 massacre, described by prosecutors as revenge for the deaths of four state troopers presumably killed by drug traffickers in the Vigario Geral shantytown. He was the first to be tried. One officer sinee has died. Judge Jose Geraldo Antonio sentenced the 38-year-old Alvarenga for 21 homicides and on four counts of attempted murder, saying he had an "extremely violent personality with irrational instincts, free of human inhibitions, which manifests itself in the most bestial form." Rodrigo Hoca, one of Alvarenga's attorneys, criticized the sentence. "I have never seen anything like this. It was a political con­demnation," Hoca said, referring to public cries for police reform since the massacre. 
Fatigue-clad man fires on synagogue 
DALLAS 
A man wearing Army fatigues shouted "die, Jews, die" and fired shots at a synagogue filled with worshipers. No one was injured. Donald Ray Anderson was arrested in the parking lot of Baruch lla Shorn Messianic: Congregation on Saturday after lowering his rille when a police officer drew a gun, police said. "lie was right in front of the door shooting," said Sheryl Selk, who told authorities she saw Anderson raise a rille and shoot it into the air five times while shouting "die, Jews die" over and over again. Selk said she saw Anderson attempt to reload as police arrived. Bullets shattered glass at the synagogue and made holes near a Star of David on the building. From 250 to 300 members of the congregation were inside and hit tho floor when they heard shots. Children would ordinarily have been playing outside, but it was raining.

Values 
continued from page 1 
sparking a sense of volun­teerism in the nation, which comes along with the return­ing values to American soci­ety, according to Dole, who flew in from working with flood victims in North Dakota. 
"Our sense of limitless possi­bility has run into a stone wall of crime, violence, drugs, ille­gitimacy and instability," she said. "What's happened to honor, duty and personal responsibility? 
"The deep and unsettling fear is that the nation given to us by our founders, and given to my generation by our par­ents. was a much better place than the America we're turn­ing <wer to our children." 
In light of a fast-paced, changing society centered on progress, Americans are still hesitant to discuss the funda­mentals, according to Dole. 
"In seeking to make America better, we've neglected what made her good. We've been embarrassed to talk about the values that make our lives happy and safe and fulfilled," Dole said. "We don't have to abandon our dreams, but we 

must not forget the values and principles that allow us the luxury of dreaming." 
To achieve that, we must look to those core values, rather than basing change solely on laws and regulations in Washington. 
"The substitution of regula­tion for responsibility is a kind of Puritanism for a people who no longer believe in character, who no longer believe in the wisdom and goodness of the people," she said. 
Calling the audience to embrace a service project, such as the Red Cross, "Looking back ovet: lives, its not going "to be 'How much money did I make?' or 'How much prestige did I gather?' or 'How many honors did I receive?'" Dole said. 
"I really believe the question we'll be asking ourselves is 'What did I stand for?' and 'Did I make a positive differ­ence in the lives of others?"' she stated. 
"We've got to trust ourselves and our values, and not solely the government and its inten­tions," Dole said. "Individual and national character is what we need. It comes from caring for your community -giving of yourself, your time, and your resources."

"Dishonesty can now lead to death," Power said, referring to the increase of AIDS and its role in sexual relationship infidelity. 
"Baptiste wasn't honest with himself. He can continue to be dishonest, or learn to deal with the complete him. lie can look for the potential opportunity within the problem," Power said. 
IIe then asked the audience to think of an opportunity they could find within themselves if they contracted AIDS. Audience members then voiced their ideas of opportunity within the frame­work of living "with a terminal disease. 
"The little things would count more," said one student." 
"I would revert from school, and get to know my family bet­ter," another student added. 
"I would skydive and travel. Do all the things I've always wanted to do. Then I would try to help others with the disease," a third student declared. 
After listening. to the respons­es, Bileal then encouraged the audience to do the things that they had mentioned, even if they were not terminally ill.

The second roleplay featured a gangster-type male, called Baby Troy, who had just been informed by his girlfriend that she had tested positive for I-llY, and that he probably would as well. The Baby Troy character struggled with anger and frus­tration while realizing that he would probably not survive his disease. 
Bileal described the section in one word; "support." 
"[Baby Troy's] community is lacking systems that have been set up in others to deal with AIDS, to offer support," Bileal said. 
"He determines his manhood by his possession of a gun, his relationship with a woman. and fathering of a child," Bileal said. "He has no support or role model to learn how to be a real man." 
Again. Power asked the audi­ence to consider what the opportunity might be inside the problem of AIDS. 
As an exercise for the second roleplay, Bileal asked the audi­ence members to tuni to the person next to them and promise support if they should ever contract ITIY or AIDS. 
The duo then opened up the floor for discussion. 
Audience members asked general questions regarding the background of the two presen­ters and the origin of their act. Bileal and Power have been friends since the age of 12, and in addition to their AIDS aware-. ness work, they are directors of a funk-style band. 
"AIDS has always been in our music," Power added. "By living in San Francisco, you are famil­iar with AIDS health care and IllY-related activities. A lot of people with AIDS actually move to San Francisco because there is so much of that stuff going on." 
Bileal and Power became active in AIDS awareness after Bileal's stint on MTY's The Real World, a program devoted to the lives of seven random house­mates. One of Bileal's room­mates, Pedro Zamora, was liv­ing with AIDS during the show's airing. After Zamora's death, Bileal was contacted by an agent to further AIDS aware­ness. 
Of his MTY exposition. Bileal stated, "It is a benefit because when I speak to people.· they feel like they already know me. They're more comfortable." 
"I can put the message out without having a wall there," Bilcal said. 
He also talked about the effect of Zamora's death. "There was a lot of death the year that Pedro died. There were a lot of people we knew who·died with­in a close proximity. We realized we need to figure out ways to keep people from dying," Bileal stated. 
In conclusion, Power and Bileal stated, "We are the peo­ple who turn negatives into pos­itives, poverty into poetry, sad­ness into success ... AIDS will not hold us back."

THINGS FALL APART 
A Film By Godwin Ugwu Based on the Famous Novel by Chinua Achebe. 1986 
The main objective ofAchebe' s writing is to see Mrica through the eyes ofAfricans. A strong onslaught against the archetypical Western position on the black man's history and culture. For white writers on Mrica' s past, the central argument had been that the black­man had no history, existed outside of the ambiance of all civilization, and lived out his miserable life inflicting upon himself and his environment. Achebe wanted particularly to purge the mind of his readers of the sacrilegious imputations ... It is on the basis of the epic novel that this equally enthralling video-drama was produced.

the legality of this method of payment. Republican Representative John Boehner of Ohio, for example, said months ago in a television interview that if Gingrich were to use these funds, "it would cause an uproar." 
The congressional gift ban allows lawmakers to receive bank loans only if the terms are comparable to those gener­ally available to the public. Personal loans may only be given with the approval of the ethics committee. 
For now, the committee has reserved the right to review the terms of any loan from Dole. 
But Professor Doug Kmiec of Notre Dame's Law School did not believe that there should be any legal problem with the loan. 
"Congress has plenary authority to set its own house­keeping rules," he stated. "That's the constitutional design. And my sense is that he came within the letter of the rules they set for him." 
Nor did Kmiec believe that there was any serious ethical failure in Gingrich's ·deal. Rather, he saw the whole affair as just another partisan issue between Democrats and Republicans. 
"The suggestion that it is a further ethical violation for him to get a sweetheart loan deal from Dole is probably an over­statement -probably a politi­cal overstatement," he said. 
"My sense is that there is 

more here of political smoke 
than there is of actual wrong­
doing."

for Congressional Studies at the Heritage Foundation, which is a conservative Washington think tank, held the same view. 
"Gingrich's enemies wanted to punish him," he said. They wanted to hurt him, to make him bleed. I can't think of another example of something like this where there's been a willful attempt to punish him through financial means." 
He also rejected the idea that the loan constituted any legal violation. 
"There aren't any rules on how fines are to be paid in the House," he said, noting that it would have even been accept­able for Gingrich to use private campaign donations to pay the fine, if he had wanted. 
"In its report on Gingrich, the ethics committee specifically avoided describing how the fine could be paid," Mason said. 
In fact, despite the harangue over what Democratic House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt has called "the unusual loan agreement," some Republicans feel that it would have been much worse had Gingrich chosen to pay his fine from his campaign funds. 
Republican Representative John Boehner of Ohio, for example, said months ago in a television interview that if

Gingrich  were to  use  these  
funds,  "it would  cause  an  
uproar."  

But aside from raising the question of whether it is ethical or even legal for members of Congress to take loan deals which would not be available to the general public, many rep­resentatives from both parties are apparently concerned about the fine itself, since it could set a dangerous prece­dent within Congress. 
"The fine itself is within the powers of the ethics commit­tee," said Mason, "but the size of this one is unprecedented." 
Furthermore, he felt that the proliferation of such penal action as this within the House, along with the precedent of high fines, could ultimately transform the ethics committee into a tool which could be used in partisan bickering to harm one's opponents. 
"It could allow the political opponents of an unpopular congressman to run him out of office," Mason said. 
This concern, he related, was shared by a number of Democrats who reportedly approached Gingrich recently. 
"They thought it set a bad precedent that he should pay with private funds," he said, although they did not wish to go public with their concern.

Resort Living Year-round at Castle Point Apartments 
A resident of Castle Point can lead an active life or a quiet life where one's home is truly a castle. Located on the corner of Cleveland and Ironwood, Castle Point in near University Park Mall, downtown South Bend, Michigan, the Toll Road and many other major roadways. 
Apartments are spacious, fully carpeted and available in a variety of sizes and styles including 


some with round bedrooms and lofts. Fully-equipped kitchens offer a convenience of easy care living enabling more free time to enjoy the Health and Racquet Club ... another amenity at Castle Po~nt. A swimming pool, indoor and outdoor tennis courts, racquetball courts, saunas, whirlpool, exercise room plus indoor and outdoor basketball and sand volleyball courts are also available to residents of Castle Point. 
"Why rent somewhere else and pay for health club activities when one can live (here) and enjoy the same health club privileges," said Jack Goens, General Manager at Castle Point. "(We) have virtually everything that a health club has!" 
Comparing the cost of health clubs against the cost ofliving at Castle Point with full health and racquet club privileges, Goens said several hundred dollars can be saved. 
Added Goens, there is the King's Hall where parties can be scheduled. A full-time activities director also organizes regular events for Castle Point residents who may wish to aerobic dance ... or simply have a private party scheduled at the clubhouse. 
Office hours at Castle Point Apartments are 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday and on Saturday from 10 a.m. until6 p.m., Sunday noon to 6

Dear Editor: 

This is in response to the epicly written piece by Observer News Copy Editor David Freddoso from April 16 entitled "Of golf carts and nose­bleeds." For those of you who missed this very special Inside Column, Freddoso chastised the residents of Alumni Hall for actions that they are currently pursuing against an individual who skillfully guided his golf cart through the Alumni Wake procession. Mr. Freddoso seems to maintain that the Dawgs' actions in conjunc­tion with Student Affairs are somehow repre­hensible because they did not deal with the problem in a manner that "could have preserved their manhood." It is these points that I would now like to take issue with. 
Mr. Freddoso first takes the opportunity to extol the actions of our little mad driver and fur­ther commends his spirit of dorm pride and honor. He sup­ports •the Mighty Violent One's actions as "the only one thing 

for him to do" and draws a very manner that would be meaningful comparison 
consistent with good 
between this hit-and-run ses­

sion and "Moses parting the Red Sea." Hold on there 

dangerous. 
Still, our News Copy Editor believes that in the tradition of "Animal House" and "The Godfather," Dawgs should have doled out pun­ishment without the help of the law (in this case Student Affairs). Invoking our Dawg machismo, Freddoso suggests the timeless, yet ruthles·s, tactic of "sending him lots of e-mail bombs so that his program would crash." If I know the Mighty Violent One, which I don't, rest assured that the thought of losing his Road Warrior Simulator would make him rue the day fat golfers became too lazy to walk. 
On the other hand, those of us who feel that 

losing the latest version of Q­Bert does not nearly approxi­mate the heinous act commit­ted last Friday know what jus­tice would happen if we left this to dorm justice. One of the unspoken golden rules of dorm rivalries is that one clever tac­tic must be repaid with a still more ingenious one. Childish? Perhaps. Nonetheless, this maxim underlies Freddoso's most egregious error. If not for Student Affairs, how are Alumni's proud sons expected to avenge a violent and delib­erately dangerous attack in a 
Pharaoh; last I checked, Moses wasn't tearing around corners in a motorized chariot trying to run over Israelites out for a stroll and a good stogie. Among the amusing ways for rival dorms to show their interest in this Alumni tradition might have been water balloons, full moons or unprintable cheers (all of which were employed against Wake proces­sors). Things that might not have been in the tradition of this healthy dorm rivalry include releasing blood-thirsty pit bulls, nail-gun target practice, decapitation and, oh yes, assault with a motorized vehicle. 
After four years, some of us have seen stolen shower curtains and snow ball attacks, but even the most prolific dorm enthusiast would agree that driving with the intention to maim should be left to the nation's elderly. While Mr. Freddoso may give the Mighty Violent One the courage badge at the next troop meeting, most have to admit that his stunt was dumb and 
manner that would be consis­tent with good dorm spirit. It seems that the only appropriate response would be to run over the Mighty Violent One with something like a monster truck ... slowly. Not only is this notion ridiculous, but it is explicitly prohibited in du Lac under the section that deals with monster trucks on campus. 
Yes, all were fortunate that no one was seri­ously injured in this incident. However, had Mario Andretti had his way, this might not have been the case. The Mighty Violent One made a mistake that some ambitious Dawgs, Zahmbies, and Dillonites have made before. Like them, however, his abuse of the traditions of dorm rivalry must be punished in the proper way.

Future leaders: Put people before profits 
"Vote Socialist in '96: Put People Before Profits.'' 
This was the message that read defi­antly from the bumper of a humble car in Cl. Probably just one of those PLS majors, I thought, and made the cold journey to DeBartolo. 
Upon further reflection, however, I began to view the sticker as a symbol of much more. Its bold words epitomize

the frustrations with capitalism that have created an ideological rift in this nation and on this campus. 
We see it played out weekly in the Viewpoint editorials. The battle lines have been drawn; Arts and Letters ver­sus COBA for the hearts and minds of this campus. , 
Just a few weeks ago, a disheartened soldier on the left wrote of the empty promises of Grape Road, going so far as to advocate the establishment of a Core requirement on COBA turf. In response, a general in the finance department shot back with the sugges­tion of requiring business courses for Arts and Letters majors. 
The discord has grown so great, and the sides so stubborn. that it now bor­ders on absurdity. For instance, in the business school, we are taught that the 
• lETTER TO THE EmTOH 
only justifiable concern of a corpora­tion is to "maximize shareholder value" period. Ethics are glossed over in a two-week stint. 
In my sociology course, the professor and students alike demonize corporate America with an air of self-righteous­ness. To them, big business is only a force for evil, with Bill Gates the devil reincarnate. I wonder how many of them enjoy the luxury of DeBartolo Hall, provided by one of Satan's helpers for sure. 
It didn't take long for me to grow frustrated. In my business classes, my questions about ethics were never real­ly answered. On one occasion, the pro­fessor didn't even attempt an explana­tion, instead responding with a blank, helpless stare, as if the weight of the whole system rested upon her answer. 
In my Arts and Letters courses, it was just as bad. In incredible fits of ignorance, students who had never taken a business course in their lives would spout naive reproaches, con­vinced of their moral supremacy. My attempts to present the other side in an effort to create a true debate of the issue were met with sneers that seemed to say, "What is this business major doing in here?" And I thought liberals were supposed to be the cham­pions of free speech. 
It was beginning to appear as if one had to choose between two extremes. Either you sell your soul to the greed of corporate America or you place a "Vote Socialist" bumper sticker on your car. This. however, is a false choice. We, as students, cannot wait for our professors to admit this. After dedicat­ing their lives to one of the sides, their pride will not allow it. 

Instead, we must forge ahead our­selves. It is important to engage in respectful, probing conversations with those outside our major. Business majors have much to learn from those in O'Shaughnessy and vice-versa. In class, don't be afraid to play the devil's advocate or to ask the tough questions. 
In doing so, I believe many who detest corporate America will no longer see Grape Road as full of empty promises. Successful businesses are the dreams of millions of entrepre­neurs and the source ofjobs for most people. Liberals often forget that the money government spends is created at some point by brave entrepreneurs in the private sector. In others words, the more the economy grows, the more the government can do. 
At the same time, some business majors need to realize that corpora­tions can do much more to help improve society. The wealth in the business community is the greatest potential source of good in this coun­try. Imagine what could be done if every business in America gave a small fraction of their profits to a local school (as opposed to even more egregious executive compensation packages that are already not returned to the share­holders}. This, in fact, is the primary goal of the nonpartisan President's Summit for America's Future, chaired by Colin Powell, being held this week in Philadelphia. Powell understands that to preserve the free market, we must protect it from its excesses. 
For those who doubt this, consider how between 1987 and 1995, corpo­rate giving as a percentage of pretax income dropped from a meager 1.8 percent to 1.2 percent (a 33 percent 
University has the duty to stand up for minorities 
Dear Editor: 
Only a few weeks ago, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of women at Notre Dame. Introducing Father Hesburgh for his speech on March 22, Ann Pettifer, the first woman to be admitted to Notre Dame, pointed out how far the university still has to go. A case in point: the non-discrimination clause. 
I was taken by complete surprise when I learned that the non-discrimina­tion policy as printed in du Lac does not include gender! "The University of Notre Dame admits students of any race, color. national and ethnic origin to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the school. It does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, notional and ethnic origin in administration of its educational poli­cies, admissions policies, scholarship and loan programs, and athletic and other school-administered programs. The University of Notre Dame does not discriminate in admissions, or access to or employment of persons on its pro­grams on the basis of disability." No reputable university (or company, for that matter) nowadays allows discrimi­nation against women, just as they don't allow discrimination based on race. Neither does Notre Dame, as far as I know. Actually, to be fair, I should add that the non-discrimination clause printed in the Bulletin and on the Admissions Application form does include gender. But shouldn't our "book of rules," the reference for all the official "Student Life Policies and Procedures" also be updated? 
And while we are at it, let's also include sexual orientation in the new clause. It is already standard for many companies and universities to guantn­tee equal treatment to gays and les­bians. Georgetown, for example, has a policy that reads: "Georgetown University admits qualified students regardless of age, sex, race, handicap, color, national or ethnic origin to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activi­ties generally accorded or made avail­able to students at the school. It does not discriminate on the basis of age, sex, religion, race, sexual orientation, handicap, color, national or ethnic ori­gin in administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, scholar­ship and loan programs, or athletic and other school administered programs." (Emphasis added.) Why does Notre Dame still balk at joining them? What can possibly take so long (a whole year and counting) to figure out that sexual orientation is no ground for discrimina­tion? 
According to du Lac (p.35), "The University of Notre Dame believes in the intrinsic value of all human beings. It is, moreover, committed to full peace­able participation of all its members in the educational endeavor it fosters." (Emphasis added.) Given this basic belief, it logically follows that the uni­versity may not tolerate and definitely not participate in discrimination, includ­ing discrimination based on sexual ori­entation. After all, it is "committed to the full peaceable participation of all its members," right? Making this policy explicit by adding sexual orientation into the non-discrimination clause is, thus, coherent with existing rules. And why does Notre Dame want to reserve its right to discriminate based on sexual orientation? I can't think of any rea­sons, but if those on the various ad hoc committees investigating the issue can, they should put them out on the table to be debated. · 
This issue will not be resolved by delaying decisions, by moving it from one committee to the next. I personally don't see why this has become such a controversy. It should not be such a big deal to commit to non-discrimination. True, the "homosexual act" may be seen as a sin in Catholic doctrine, but so is the "treterosexual act" as long as it is out of wedlock. Does the university therefore prohibit single students to meet in an unsupervised setting? Of course not. Such a double standard is inadmissible. An explicit statement of the university's stanee for equal treat­ment is the first step towards a healthi­er relationship between the university at large and those members who are homosexual. The University has to live up to its idools of a welcoming, friendly environment for all its students. It must remember its belief, "in the intrinsic value of all human beings." 

Although I am not personally affected by the current toleration of discrimina­tion, I do feel strongly that we as a community, and therefore, the University in its official policies, have the responsibility to stand up for the rights of the minority. So, to all those of you out there, who are saying, "I have heard all this before. Who cares? As long as it doesn't affect me, why should I bother?" please consider: Maybe this time you are not affected, but maybe next time your rights will be infringed upon. If you believe in jus­tice, you cannot stand by and watch injustice. Our society, the rule by the majority, depends on the protection of the minority. 
And to all those I have been unable to convince: Please, join in the debate. Give your argument. The only way to solve a disagreement is to talk about it. The secrecy, in which the officials of this University are cloaking their deci­sion process, is counterproductive. If there aro (which I highly doubt) legiti­mate reasons for not changing the non­discrimination clause, they have to be put forth and examined. Notre Dame prides itself on its student body. Why then are our opinions ignored? Why are we not allowed to participate in the decision proeess? I believe the University owes it to all its students to change the non-discrimination clause to include gender and sexual orienta­tion. But the least they can do is have an open discussion.

decrease). Such behavior on the part of big business only fuels the fire in those who already loathe the free market system. 
As the gap between the rich and poor increases, we are sure to hear more demands for government control. For example, just last week Dr. Noam Chomsky gave a speech at Tufts University wh11re he likened capitalism to slavery and called for the abolish­ment of corporations. And Time Magazine (April 28) writes, "The pay disparity [between CEOs and factory workers! is five times greater than it was 30 years ago -and it's growing. You can almost hear the proletariat sharpening the guillotine." 
As future leaders, we have an obliga­tion to ereate a climate of civil debate about these issues. Furthermorr., since many of us will earn handsome sums of wealth in our lifetime, we must remember that with privilege comes obligation. Just as corporate America can do more, so can every individual through personal philanthropy. The challenge is to look beyond our circum­stances and be generous with our time and money. 
If we all do this, and take the time to learn from eaeh other, I believe we will go a long way in reconciling this tired political dispute. Socialists and Soeial Darwinists alike must reexamine their extreme positions and see tlw common ground. Only from there can we achieve the common good.

An overdue thank you 

. , Dear Editor, 
As students get geared up for the most 
' difficult part of the semester, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the Planner Tower cleaning staff. for I feel their contri­bution to the dorm often gets either over­looked or underappreciated. Of all the fac­ulty and staff on campus, I find myself more likely to have one-on-one interaction with these individuals. Not only do they play a vital role in the functioning of this building, 
···• but they provide students with the opportu­nity to make intelligent, loyal friends. 
Of this group of people, I have had the ..most interaction with my section's current ···cleaning lady. Although cleaning, up after 
137 guys cannot be easy, she maintains a .• kind yet enthusiastic attitude toward both . her work and "her" students. The warmth

Notre Dame: The games we all play 
I played in th~ Bookstore game Tuesday night between Team 532 and 4 Inmates and 1 Loose End. Since that time, I've been trying to emulate my Notre Dame Family and forget about it. I've attempted to fol­low the example of this newspaper and not mention the night as if nothing had ever happened. I played in the longest and closest game that night, and it was watched by the most people, but The Observer printed nothing but the score ... and it was incorrect. I wish I could think like my family: that everything is all right, that race relations on this campus are all right, that I played in a basketball game Tuesday night. 
When I mention the racial tension at Bookstore games, people recognize it but view it as "something that happens every year." Tuesday night was a part of the incident that haunted Nicole Hannah during the fall semester. The racial tension that had been swept under the rug just dirtied the floor again. It is not "something that happens every year," but feelings and attitudes that are present all the time and arise when something brings them out. 
Bookstore brought out the mob Tuesday night, and there were defmite lines that had nothing to do with a basketball court. I'm speaking of teams that were some­how made to represent races because of the coincidence of skin color -fights between these teams and fights with individuals jumping from the crowd to attack a team, and a crowd that happened to form according to the teams' different melanin levels. It was a race war ... we had stopped playing a game and had begun attack­ing and defending sides. 
I was in the middle of this battle. I am biracial; I am African-American and Caucasian. I am on both sides of the line, but I was not allowed to be that night. My appearance and teammates defined me that night, the mob defined me that night. I felt the tension on both sides. 
We need to look at our family, Notre Dame, because it needs therapy. We need to realize that there are prob­lems that need to be addressed. We tried to begin the process with forums that occurred after Nicole's letter, but what happened to the subsequent forums promised? Disregard the forums, why do we do little for ANY under-represented group on this campus? 
We are all at fault because we are all allowing our family structure to crumble. "If it does not affect me personally, it is not my problem." If we have this men­tality, we do not have a family because if my brother or sister is in pain, then I should be hurting too. We need to quit ignoring the problems our family is facing and make an effort to do anything to make it a healthy fami­ly. We are NO.

ND's deferred alliance 

Dear Editor: 
The combination of discrimination and s'exual orientation seems to be a running theme on campus these days. Between the College Democrats' campaign for a non-dis­crimination policy and Saint Mary's alliance being deferred, it is clear that the universi­ty is afraid of dealing with this issue. 
Well, Notre Dame, the saga continues. Saint Mary's is not the only school with a deferred alliance issue; Notre Dame has one as well, but the administration has not been as forthright with us as it was with Saint Mary's. 
Approximately a month and a half ago, I turned in a packet for official recognition for ALLIES NO, aproposed straight/gay alliance for our campus. I have not heard a word from any University officials. My phone calls fall upon deaf ears. In the packet, I includ­ed a long letter to Student Activities discussing why I thought ALLIES NO is a good idea for our campus and turned in petitions with signatures of supporting students and facul­ty. I rather stupidly believed that the University would view a gay/straight alliance as a blessing, the perfect solution to their problem. Well, I've officially been proven wrong. The decision for ALLIES NO has definitely been deferred, but without any notification that it was ever considered to begin with and without any time line as to a possible deci­sion. 
The purpose of ALLIES NO was to educate against homophobia on this campus. I wanted to provide a means in which straight students could feel comfortable supporting the gays on campus. I wanted to make our campus a safe space for gays who are trying to come out. I wanted to combat the stereotypes and the animosity that go along with homophobia, and in general, just improve communication on campus. What the University is doing is perpetuating the homophobic views held by many on this campus. If they do it, what kind of role model is that to set for one's students? They are also curbing our rights to learn and discuss important issues openly on this campus. 
As long as this issue is forced to stay closeted, the stigma attached to it will never be erased. Straight/gay alliances are common. Most Catholic schools have them and educa­tion to defeat homophobia is not against the Church's teachings. Students, claim your right to organize your own groups, to speak out, to think. Straight students, support the gay community, if for no otherreason than to realize that the rights that they are being denied aren't very well protected for you either. After all, here I am, a straight student, who is being brushed off for just being associated with the issue of sexual orientation. Gay students, demand your rights to exist and to be represented. Everyone, please work together to retain your rights and to make this campus a place where everyone can feel welcomed and accepted. 
Notre Dame should show more willingness to enter into the conversation 
Dear Editor: 

On the evening of April 19, we ood the distinct pleasure of attending the Saint Mary's College Shaheen Presidents Lecture Series, featuring one of the world's most influential women, former U.S. Rep. Patricia S. Schroeder. 
Schroeder, noted for her introduction of the Family and Medical Leave Bill and her 1988 presidential candidacy, offered her insights upon the challenges faced by the American family in the 1990s. She also conveyed a sense of hope that we, as Americans, can work to remove the family from the category of an "endangered species." Schroeder's inspirational speech was enthusiastically received by the Notre Dame students in attendance. All five of them. 
The current Notre Dame student body prides itself on its supposedly high lev­els of activism in social dialogue and reform, reaching for beyond the activism of prior students bodies. One example is the commendable endeavor undertaken by the Notre Dame College Democrats to adopt a non-discrimination clause [that includes sexual orientation]. This clause serves to protect the rights of all indi­viduals connected with the University of Notre Dame, regardless of sexual orien­tation. One would think that groups such as the College Democrats would heavi­ly promote and attend a speech given by a Democratic representative who served on the House Civil and Constitutional Rights Subcommittee during her 24 years of servfce in Congress. So -where are they? Do the students of Notre Dame think that Schroeder's quarter century of service, during which she fought diligently to protect the rights of all American citizens, is not worthy of their note? Or is Saint Mary's too far to walk? 
In the future we would hope that the students of Notre Dame would reflect the sentiments of the University's mission statement by possessing a "willingness to enter into the conversation that gives it life and character."

VOLCANO Directed by: MickJackson Starring: Tommy Lee Jones 
and Anne Heche 

(Out of five shamrocks) 
By MARK TORMA 
Accent Movie Critic 
I don't know how it happened, but it appears that I've been in the dark all these years. I've either been unin-' formed, unaware, ignorant or just plain oblivious of one simple theological fact, and that is this: God doi,Sn't work through the Church, the Pope or any group of true believers. 
God works through an even more select group of women and men -the public officials of the city of Los Angeles. 
To what do I owe this revelation? I have just seen "Volcano," the new release starring Tommy Lee Jones, and co-starring almost every familiar plot device from every disaster movie since "The Ten Commandments" (I always did feel sorry for that poor Egyptian army). I won't beat around the bush: At its very heart, "Volcano" is the exact same thing that hordes of people enjoyed after they shelled out hundreds of millions to see "Twister," and then two months later, "Independence Day." It was the same thing -pretty much a carbon copy. If you can't get enough of that kind of movie, go see "Volcano." 
Now. Don't pass go, don't collect my last paycheck and don't waste any more time reading this review. 
If, however, you're a little bit hesitant about the current rage for Armageddon-esque movie spectaculars, then read on in good faith. "Volcano" is not much better -but thankfully, not be convincing are somewhat less so. It employs faux science with a slightly defter hand than "Jurassic Park." Nevertheless, it misses the point that newly-erupted lava -the current mon­ster that is eating Los Angeles -tends to move quite a bit faster (at least from what I can remember about it) than the

Other than Tommy Lee Jones reprising his role in "The Fugitive" at his usual breakneck speed and intensity, the rest of the cast hardly mattered at all. They were so overshadowed by the lava of Mount Wilshire that they must have developed vitamin D deficiency on the set-and that should be the very last of my horribly pedantic jokes in this space, since this is my last movie review for The Observer. To all of you who have read me here, I've had a great time writing for you, and I hope you enjoyed it too. 
P.S.: The movie's OK. ; much worse -than these other block­busters of recent years. Its attempts to be intriguing are successful; its attempts to be sincere are not; and its attempts to creeping ooze in "Volcano." If you can overlook things like this, then there is quite a visceral treat in store for you ­if you can stomach the story. 

But I'm not being fair. The main story is not that bad, just heavy-handed, but what can you do when your slogan ("The coast is toast") says it all? Los Angeles gets destroyed (almost) by a volcano; the real story would be the dis­covery that New York cares at all. I cer­tainly didn't care for the trite sub-plots and throwaway scenes that are for some reason mandatory in this genre. 
In only a couple examples of their movie's non-originality, these filmmak­ers must have believed that the key to "Independence Day's" success was the amount of cheese included, because "Volcano" has shamelessly torn a few pages from "104's" playbook. IIere, a dog escapes a face-to-face encounter with the molten menace (remember the nauseating saga of the death-defying pooch?), and race relations are given a token storyline -once again to prove how a disaster will bring us all together.

"I.e Week 
"HEAT" 

By MIKE MCMORROW Accent Movie Critic 
It has often been said that the key to making a good crime thriller film has little to do with the plot. Hather, it is the char­acter development that makes a crime film stand out. Carl Franklin knew this when h1~ made his debut with "One False Move." and Michael Mann appears to understand this concept as well. "Heat," his new thriller. is a solid representation of this concept of character over thrill, and the catch is simply that a film which chooses character over thrill is essentially going to be more "thrilling" anyway. 
"Heat" stars AI Pacino as L.A. cop Vincent Hanna. Hanna is involved in a personalized search for professional thief Neil McCauley, played by Robert DeNiro. IIanna is assigned the case after McCauley and his crew pull off a scam involving stolen semi-trucks and a bank robbery. Throughout the first part of the ntm. Mann intervenes between these two characters. introducing us to their lives 
and personalities. It is exceedingly inter­esting to see how both of their existences are affected by each other. Anyone living in the United States has probably been exposed to the hoopla about this being the first time Pacino and DeNiro have shared the screen. And indeed. much of the film's tension is generated by the fact that we want to see these actors on screen togeth­er. and playing off each other. 
Both characters are involved or become involved in intricate dealings with women, which constitutes one of the many concen­tration points of the film. McCauley feels confined by his profession and has not been romantically involved for quite some time. lie meets a woman named Eady (Amy Brenneman) one night at a restau­rant, and their first conversation becomes quite a character revelation for McCauley. Initially, he appears turned off by her "nosiness," but eventually comes to talk openly with her before they become involved. I will not ruin the experience of watching how these people grow because of one another, but they do share a cer­tain urgency of loneliness. which is fasci­nating to witness. 
lianna is on his third marriage with a woman named Justice (Diane Venora), a union which we can tell from the begin­ning seems to have a superfluous quality. They have a daughter (portrayed by Natalie Portman) who seems to be the unfortunate object of their apparent lack of compatibility. The basis of Hanna's romantic failure appears to be his obses­sion with his work, which comes to mirror that of McCauley. "Heat" addresses these questions of need and obsession with a subtle and thoughtful touch. We do not get Oliver Stone-esque messages shoved in our face, but rather thoughtful insights about the need for contradiction. 
And of course, at the center of the film, is the now notorious "dining" scene in which DeNiro and Pacino confront each other and learn about the basic motiva­tions behind the choices they have made. We would expect to see sparks flare in this scene, but instead we get an uncanny resonance between the two professionals. They have a certain necessity in terms of each other. "Heat" does not ignore the idea that we are all fascinated by the opposite of what we do or strive for -and it emphasizes the fact that McCauley and Hanna have a mutual understanding about not being enemies on a personal level, but instead because of their societal status. The film offers some interesting suggestions about Hanna and McCauley's similarities: Neither of them knows how to do any other work. . 
There are other key players in this film. Val Kilmer portrays one of McCauley's team members; Ashley Judd 
and Chris Shiherlis play a couple immersed in a troubled marriage. These two characters, in their relationship with one another, reinforce many of the film's .suggestions about women tied to a life of crime. Also on the playing field is Jon Voight (with long hair!) who acts almost as a counsel to McCauley. All of these characters add to the cast ensemble nice­
ly. 
And indeed, maybe the most important 
reason to watch "Heat" with attention is 
because of the acting. AI Pacino and 
Robert DeNiro play their roles with 
absolute, commanding power and confi­
dence. They are professionals themselves 
at playing cops and robbers, and in 
"Heat" they are able to put fine tunings on 
roles which they mastered years ago. 
Kilmer and Voight put a signature on 
their performances and do not let their 
"could-be-boring" roles fall into the 
monotonous. Rather, they add a deeply 
personal quality that makes the movie all 
the more compelling. 
"Heat" is a fascinating film -one of the 
most insightful crime films I have ever 
seen. To top off the characterization, it 
contains action scenes of amazing logisti­
cal professionalism. 
"Heat" is a didactic film, in which we 
learn the ins and outs of a bank robbery, 
as well as those of a police investigation. 
At the center of everything is that scene in 
which Pacino and DeNiro gaze into each 
other's eyes, and convey things that are 
not capable of being put into words. 
This scene is the joy of the film.

Jordan's offense helps Bulls outlast feisty Bullets 

By MIKE NADEL Associated Press Writer 
CHICAGO 
On a day the Chicago Bulls were heatable, Michael Jordan wasn't. 
Jordan scored 55 points, in­cluding 20 of Chicago's 23 in the fourth quarter, as the Bulls took a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference quarterfinals by de­feating the Washington Bullets 109-104 Sunday. 
The Bulls also got a lift from Dennis Rodman, who grabbed seven rebounds in the second half after changing from a heavy knee brace to an elastic support. In the first half, he had as many technical fouls as re­bounds -one -and at one point threw his brace to the court in disgust. 
Calbert Cheaney scored 26 points, Tracy Murray 22 and Chris Webber 21 for the Bullets, who must win at home Wednesday to avoid being swept in the best-of-5 series. 
Jordan was 22-of-35 from the floor in breaking the 50-point mark in a playoff game for the eighth time in his career. He last had as many as 55 points in the postseason against Phoenix in the 1993 NBA Finals. Sunday's performance tied the most points he had in any game since coming out of retirement 25 months ago; he also had 55 against New York in 1995. 
Jordan had nine points dur­ing a 13-0 third-quarter run that gave the Bulls an 80-73 lead, then singlehandedly kept the Bullets from catching up in the fourth as the defending champions improved to 23-2 in first-round playoff games in the 1990s. 

After a 3-pointer by Webber cut Chicago's lead to 94-93 with 5:34 remaining, Jordan drove past Cheaney for a layup, hit a 15-foot double-pump jumper over Cheaney and drove around Cheaney and Juwan Howard for a double-pump bank shot as he fell out of bounds to put the Bulls up 100­93. 
Chicago led only 105-102 be­fore Jordan lost Cheaney and Howard with a stutter-step move and hit a left-handed layup with 34.4 seconds left for a 107-102lead. 
Scottie Pippen's 3-pointer with 2:50 to go accounted for Chicago's only fourth-quarter points not scored by Jordan. 
The Bullets trailed 29-27 late in the first quarter before Murray came off the bench to score 14 of Washington's next 17 points to put Washington up 45-38. 
Jordan had 26 first-half points but the Bulls were down 65-58 at the break. 
Lakers 107 Trail Blazers 93 
Shaquille O'Neal found him­self a little more contained, so his teammates did a little more on the offensive end to lead the Lakers to another decisive vic­tory. 
O'Neal, who scored 46 points in Game 1, had 30 points along with six rebounds and five as-. sists in Game 2 Sunday as Los Angeles routed the Portland Trail Blazers 107-93. 
Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell added 19 and 16 points, respectively, and Nick Van Exel added 13 points to go with nine assists. 
The win gave the Lakers a 2­0 lead in the best-of-5 series, which moves to Portland for Game 3 Wednesday night. The Blazers, who have made the playoffs for 15 straight seasons, are one loss away from being eliminated in the first round for the fifth consecutive year.

BALTIMORE 

Bill Haselman homered, hit three doubles and drove in four runs to lead the Boston Red Sox past the Baltimore Orioles 13-7 Sunday. 
The tcams.combined for eight home runs, including five by Boston. Mo Vaughn, Tim Naehring, Troy O'Leary and Wil Cordero also homered for the Red Sox, who salvaged a split of the four-game series. 
Eric Davis homered twice and Cal Ripken had a three-run shot for the Orioles. But Baltimore's bullpen blew a save opportunity for the first time in 12 tries this season. 
llaselman's third double sparked a three-run seventh inning that brought Boston back from a 6-5 deficit. His two-run homer in the eighth ­measured at 443 feet -made it 11-6. Armando Benitez's next pitch sailed ncar the head of Jeff Frye, causing plate umpire Hich Garcia to eject the reliev­er. 
llaselman's four hits and four 
RBis matched career highs for 
fifth-year catcher. 
Down 6-5 in the seventh, 
Boston rallied against reliever Arthur Rhodes (2-1). Haselman doubled, Frye had a pinch-hit single and Nomar Garciaparra and Wil Cordero followed with RBI singles. Mike Stanley .capped the uprising with a pinch-hit sacrifice fly off 
Benitez. 
O'Leary led off the eighth 
with a home run and Haselman 
homered after a walk to John 
Valentin. Benitez threw his 
next pitch near Frye. 
Cordero capped the four-run 
eighth by homering off Shawn 
Boskie. Frye hit an RBI double 
in the ninth, Boston's 19th hit. 
Butch Henry (1-0) pitched 
two innings in relief of Steve 
A very to earn his first win since 
August 1995. 
Davis homered in his first two 
at-bats, giving him five straight 
hits over two straight games ­
including three homers and a 
double. The streak ended with 
a fifth-inning popup, but he 
went 4-for-5 with three RB!s. 
Davis has five homers this year, all in his last six games. 
Baltimore starter Mike Mussina left after six innings with a 6-5 lead, but the bullpen ruined his bid to win a fourth straight start. The home runs by Vaughn and Neahring were the first against Mussina in five starts this season. 
A two-run homer by Davis gave Baltimore a 2-0 lead in the first. 
Boston tied it in the second. After Reggie Jefferson doubled and scored when O'Leary hit into a fielder's choice, Haselman hit an RBI double. 
Vaughn hit a solo shot to left in the third, his sixth homer of the year and second in two games. Davis-homered on an 0­2 pitch in the Orioles' half. 
Neahring led off the fourth with a drive that hit the foul pole, and one out later an RBI 
. double by Haselman made it 5­
3. Ripkcn's home run in the fifth put Baltimore in the lead. It was his fifth homer; he had one in April last year. 
Ripken had an RBI single in the ninth.

Detroit advances to next round 
By R.B. FALLSTROM Associated Press W ricer 
ST. LOUIS 
The Detroit Red Wings wrapped up their first-round playoff series in six games on Sunday, getting power-play goals from Viacheslav Kozlov and Brendan Shanahan in a 3­1 victory over the St. Louis Blues. 
The Red Wings were 2-for-7 with the man advantage and ended the series with six power-play goals after getting shut out the first two games on 14 chances. Kirk Maltby added a third-period goal for Detroit, the third seed in the Western Conference, which needed seven games to eliminate St. Louis in the second round last season. 
While the Heel Wings contin­ue their quest for their first Stanley Cup since 1955, the Blues haven't made it past the second round since 1986. 
The Blues hastened their demise with ill-timed penal­ties, including three high-stick­ing calls, and puny offense. Mike Vernon faced only 11 shots in the first two periods, and 25 overall. 
In five power plays, the Blues managed one routine shot. 
It was a far cry from Game 4 in St. Louis, when the Blues came up with perhaps their best game of the season in a 4­

defense and scoring his third goal of the playoffs with a backhander in front of the net. After that, the Red Wings dom­inated. 
Kozlov tied it on a power play at 8:45 after a nice fake by Sergei Fedorov, who faked a shot from the point. Instead he fed it to the right circle where Kozlov snapped a quick shot for his second playoff goal. 
With Jim Campbell off for high sticking, Shanahan put the Red Wings ahead at 1:07 when he banged in a rebound from the side of the net. After being held to an assist the first two games, Shanahan finished with three goals and three assists to lead the Red Wings. 
The Blues lost an apparent game-tying goal with 52.8 sec­onds left in the period when Pierre Turgeon's left skate was in the crease as he knocked in a rebound shot. 
Maltby scored his first goal of the playoffs on a rebound shot at 8:24 of the third, get­ting a wide-open right side after Fuhr stopped a drive by Darren McCarty. 
Stars 3 Oilers 2 Mike Modano skated around the ice like a man possessed. 
He knew, though, exactly where he was going and what he wanted to. 
Modano scored at 14:42 of the third period after running the Edmonton Oilers' defense ragged to lift the Dallas Stars to a 3-2 victory Sunday, forc­ing a seventh and deciding game of their NHL Western Conference playoff series. 
With each team playing a 
man short, Modano stripped the puck from Edmonton defenseman Luke Richardson in the Oilers' zone and skated circles around his opponents as he revved up. 
The speedy center skated up to the blueline and tore up the middle of the ice, ripping a shot that deflected off Oilers' center Doug Weight's stick and past goalie Curtis Joseph for his fourth goal of the series. 

The Oilers, who had hoped to . eliminate thP. highly favored Stars on home ice, now must play Game 7 in Dallas on Tuesday night. 
The Stars held a wide edge in play during the first period but the teams were tied after 20 minutes in front of a frantic sellout crowd of 17,099, watching the Oilers in the playoffs for the first time since 1992. 
Edmonton's Boris Mironov was caught inside the Dallas blueline and the Stars broke in on Joseph, with Jere Lehtinen scoring at 3:49 for a 1-0 Dallas lead. 
The Oilers, outshot 18-7 in the period. tied the score when captiiin Kelly Buchberger sped around defenseman Richard Matvichuk and passed to rook­ie Mike GriP.r, who scored his third of the series at 13:25. 
The second period was more even. Bob Hassen pulled the Stars in front after converting Pat Verbeek's pass at 14:43 following an Oilers' giveaway. 
But Marius Czerkawski brought the Oilers back with a quick wrist shot after Edmonton's Mats Lindgren won a faceoff in the Dallas zone in the linal minute.

Irish clinch second Big East South Division title 
Team claims LVins in three weekend games 
By ALLISON KRILLA 
Sports Writer 
For the Notre Dame softball team, the final conference games of 1997 proved to be a microcosm of their season-the team clinched their second con­secutive Big East South Division title and matched their worst Ivy Field defeat. 
"This year we've had more ups and downs (than last year) in conference games," said Liz Perkins. "I think that will help us to stay up in the conference tournament." 
The Irish took three of four games from second-place Hutgers, including two shutouts, to secun~ one of four places in the Big East softball championships. 
In game one, Notre Dame's catcher Kris McCleary belted a three-run double in the four­run first inning. Meghan Murray also added a single with the bases loaded in the first for Notre Dame. 
A pair of Rutgers runs in the third narrowed the Irish lead, until a sacrifice fly by Sarah Mathison in the bottom of the inning and a Kara McMahon RBI single in the fourth closed out the scoring for Notre Dame. 
Joy Battersby picked up her ninth win of the season, with seven strikeouts in six and 2/3 innings of work. Angela Bessolo closed out the seventh to record her second save of the spring. 
Kelly Nichols and Bessolo combined for the five-hit shutout in the 5-0 win in game two. Nichols improved to 11-4 on the season, a . 733 single­season winning percentage that places Nichols fifth in the Notre Dame record books. 
Murray led the charge for the Irish. going 3-for-4 with one RBI and two runs scored. 
The only blemish on the weekend record for the Irish came in game one of Sunday's double-header. The Irish man­aged only five hits off Rutgers' starter Juliette Brooks, while the Lady Knights tagged the Irish staiT for nine hits en route

Stokes successfully develops on and off the field 
By BRIAN REINTHALER 
Assistant Spons Editor 
Head coach Bob Davie hit the nail on the head when evaluating the performance of Clement Stokes, who rushed for 139 yards in Saturday's spring game. 
"Clement Stokes is a war­rior." praised Davie. 
Indeed, it is Stokes' warrior­like attitude that has helped him to battle through some off-the-field adversity, so that he would be in a position to get back on the field this spring. 
Stokes had been plagued by reocurring academic difficul­ties, which prevented him from playing football on any regular basis. In fact, Stokes left Notre Dame to work on his grades in thP fall before returning this semester. Before that, there were times when he did not know if he would even be at Notre Dame for much longer. 
"My sophomore year, I was a little unsure of a lot of things," said Stokes. "I think that's where going away for a semester -and stepping back from football and just really looking at your academics and what you want to do in the long term -really helps you. When I was away, I realized that I really did love Notre Dame." 
The time away helped Stokes 
to buckle down and concen­
trate on his responsibilities as 
a student. 
"I'm more focused," .explained Stokes. "Definitely. I don't think I was as focused as I should have been here. It does take a tremendous amount of effort to do well in the classroom and do well on the football field and that's 
really what you want to do." 
Davie is very encouraged by the reports that he has received regarding Stokes' progress. 
"He's doing exceptionally well, and he's taking care of his business," Davie said. "Right now, he's .on course. He's done everything we've asked him to do." 
According to Stokes, he earned a 3.4 grade point aver­age during his semester away and is currently pulling a 3.0. 
Almost as impressive as his academic recovery is his sharpness on the field after his time off from football. Stokes outrushed every other Irish back by over 100 yards, gain­ing 59 and 80 yards for the Blue and Gold teams, respec­tively. Davie did present the veteran back with 26 carries, whereas no other rusher received more than 10, but Stokes still averaged an impressive 5.3 yards per carry. 
"I felt really good that I was given an opportunity like this," said Stokes. "I was put in a situation where there was a great line on both sides of the ball. I just feel really good about it and I'm really g1ad." 
Quarterback Ron Powlus was also impressed but not surprised by Stokes' effort on Saturday. 
"He's a player," commented Powlus. "lie's a kid that has great physical ability. He's very talented." 
Stokes believes that the Blue and Gold game was a good indicator of what he can do to help this Irish team. However, he is far from overconfident. 
"I still have a lot of work to do," acknowledged Stokes. J "I don't think that I had a perfect game. There are some situa-
After a scoreless first quarter, Ron Powlus engineered a 12­play drive that covered 65 yards in five and a half minutes. Powlus connected with three dif­ferent receivers before Denson and Joey Goodspeed carried them inside the 10-yardline. Denson fmally punched it in on a fourth and goal play from the two. 
Powlus completed 16 of his 24 passes for 148 yards, but he couldn't connect on the deep one, and his longest pass of the day covered just 17 yards. However, Davie feels that Powlus

"Chappell's got a long way to go, but he has a lot of tools," Davie assessed. "lie's a big quarterback with a strong arm, and I think he has a lot of poten­tial." 
The next points were provided by Scott Cengia on a 42-yard field goal. The kick capped a 35­yard drive that saw Rossum burn the Gold defense on a reverse for 15 yards. 
The Blue squad increased their lead as Ken Barry closed the

One of the biggest differences in the two games was the improvement of the pass protec­tion with the quarterbacks hav­ing more time to pass.

Some of those goals that Davie mentioned were developing a team chemistry and a relation­ship betW!)en the coaches and players. This had to be one of the biggest concerns with the changing of the guard. but the attitude and enthusiasm were positive around camp. 
"We wanted to get the new systems in, offensively and defensively," Davie said. "I don't think that there's any question we did that. We concentrated a lot on x's and o's this spring." 
Davie was also looking to find those athletes, who would make an impact, and that would replace those graduating seniors in May. Names that came to mind were defensive linemen Lance Legree and Shelton Jordan, and linebacker Lamont Bryant. On the offensive side of the ball. sophomore tight end Dan O'Leary impressed as well as fullback Joey Goodspeed . 
Davie sees the summer as a time when the squad will not lose ground but gain it. "All players arn coming out of spring with an idea of what they need to improve on. There should be a lot of improvement between now and when they report in August." 


Seniqr Ron Powlus, who will return for a fifth year, engineered a 12-play drive in the second quarter which covered 65 yards.

Notre Dame offense too Dluch for Harvard to handle 

The Observer/Brandon Candura 

The Irish pulled away in the final quarter to manhandle Harvard, 13-5 .

There is an old adage that says what­ever does not kill you will make you stronger. The Notre Dame men's lacrosse team is living proof. Coming off a one-point loss last weekend, the Irish crushed the Harvard Crimson 13­5 yesterday at Moose Krause Stadium. 
"It was a good win," said Irish coach Kevin Corrigan. "We really responded well (after the loss). We had a great week of practice. This is a team with a tremendous competitive desire." 
"I was a little worried because I did­n't know what to expect," Corrigan continued. "But the team just went back to work. I was really impressed." 
The Irish opened up a 4-1 first quar­ter advantage on goals by senior Will DeRiso and sophomore Chris Dusseau. Harvard came back to outscore the Irish 3-2 in the second quarter but Notre Dame held a 6-4 halftime advan­tage. Both goals in the second quarter for Notre Dame were s·cored by Dusseau. Harvard pulled to within one with 1:33 left before intermission on back-to-hack goals by Lou Bevilacqua. But Dusseau's goal 17 seconds before the half stopped the scoring string. 
"We played really well in the first quarter," said sophomore midfielder Stephen Taylor. "The second period 
was a little slow, but we picked it up again in the second half." 
Ned Webster opened the third quar­ter scoring for Notre Dame with a tally at the 11:06 mark off a Jimmy Keenan assist. Jim Bevilacqua then netted Harvard's final goal of the game with 44 seconds left in the quarter. The Irish held a 7-5 advantage heading into the final 15 minutes of the contest. Notre Dame went on to score six straight goals to close the game with a 13-5 vic­tory. 
Hayes and DeRiso each had two goals in the fourth-quarter scoring barrage, while Keenan added a goal and two assists. 
The Irish, who improve to 8-2, could very well be 10-0 on the season. "Both of our losses this season have been by one goal," explained Corrigan. "This team put forth just a tremendous effort today. They have been able to remain focused. This is a team that does not give up easily." 
The team wants to remain focused and maintain momentum from yester­day's game in an attempt to carry it over to this weekend's game against Ohio State. 
"If we approach next week like we did this week, we will be in a good position on Saturday," said Corrigan. "We just need to put our best foot for­ward."

DEAR EUGENIA: I was born on April 28, 1973, at 6:04a.m. Spring semester should be my last semester in graduate school. I would like to know how this period would be for job prospects. I need to get a job immediately. Also, will any Prince Charmi;lg come in to my life? I don't know if you will be able to answer these questions for me, but I hope you can. 
Need to Know 
DEAR NEED TO KNOW: Happy Birthday. This year, your chart is hot when it comes to employment. Go after your dreams with a passion and don't let anyone stand in your way. You will be more in step regarding romantic partners in 1998, so don't feel too badly if the men you meet this year don't live up to your expec­tations. You should be putting your heart and soul into getting ahead pro­fessionally, not nurturing a re­lationship that will only sidetrack you and hold you back. You have a lot of potential where work and money are concerned, so go after it, girl, and don't look back. Once you've made it to the comfort level fi· nancially, you will meet a different quality of men who will be sure to captivate your he.ut. Patience and hard work will be your key to suc­cess.

became a reality for Dos Geses. 
The team proved itself to be the true Dark Horse of Bookstore XXVI yesterday with its victory over the giant­killer Swoosh on a rainy Stepan Center court. 
"We used that somewhat as momentum." Denvir com­mented about his team's "dark horse" status. "We knew we were a good team, but we definitely liked the attitude of the underdog, hav­ing to scrap for every win." 
Led by the play of Denvir, who made two clutch foul shots to win the game, Dos Geses was able to battle its way past the resilient Swoosh. 
After jumping out to a quick lead, Dos Geses had to deal with the outstanding shooting of Matt' Busam, who kept Swoosh in the game in the first half and even entered the second half up one. The two teams remained neck-in-neck the remainder of the game until the final minutes in which they were tied at 20, at which Denvir took over. 
The key to Dos Geses' win lay in the well-balanced attack of the champions. 
Steve Craig,_ of Primetime who lost to Dos Geses in the Final Four, commented of the Geses, "It's tough to beat a team that shoots the way the Geses do. It's hard enough to beat one or two good guys, but when you have a whole team of scorers, that's almost impossible."
