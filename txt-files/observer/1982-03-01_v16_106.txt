Literary Festival 
Poet prefers unfamiliar subjects

Poet Susan Fromberg Schaeffer rarely writes about the people around her, saying that one's per· sonal life should be "separate from one's imaginative life." 
Schaeffer spoke to a ncar capacity 
Writer portrays life's grimness 
By SONIA STINSON 
News Staff 
Robert Credey's poetry and prose often has a tone which is, in his words, "rather grim," but "tells it like it is." His reading of a selection of his works at the Library Auditorium Saturday night marked the close of this year's Sophomore Literary Festival. 
Crcclcy is currently Gray Profes· sor of Poetry and Letters at the State University of New York at Buffalo. He has taught at Black Mountain Col· lege and was editor of the Black Mountain Review. The Arlington, Massachusetts native has written several volumes of poetry, a novel, and a work ofexperimental prose. 
Crcdey's poetry is threaded with imagt'S of light and gray and the bru­talncs..~ oflife and death. Uncertainty is another theme which runs through Creeley's writing, shown in the blurry and fading images in several of his poems. 
lie describes his writing style as "autobiographical," a term he dctincs as "a life tracking itsdf." 
In poems like "Self Portrait", "Time", and "Mother's Voice," <.:reelcy rl·vcals an intense private rctkction. lie wrote "Time" in honor of the birth of his son, marvelling at "this wry, small, vul­nc:rabk, partkular child." 
In "Cirdcs", CrtTlcy commmc:nts on his impressions of t·arly aftt·r· noon T.V. lie rc:calkd of the: ex· pcrkncc: which prompted thl· pm·m: "I thouj.\h it would he ~OI11l' kind of cntertainml·nt. hut alnw~t immediately it wasn't." The poem is about a "test yourself' public service spot on depression: "I took the test, and I'm not depressed." 
Crceley's reading also included a few love: pot·ms and several literary poems in honor of such artists as Coleridge and Allen Ginsberg. 
Creeley said that in his most recent book, Mirrors, he col· laborated wit t h an artist to create a theme called "the angle of in­cidence." The theme is based on the: artist's creative work with glass and refers to the angles "from object to glass, and from glass to eye." 
In "Mabel: A Story," Creeley used an elaborate pattern based on .the numbers one, two and three to create a theme. He joked that when he and other writers use such com­plex patterns in their works, "people foolishly take you seriously." 
This fall Creeley will have published a collection of poems from 1945-1975.

concluded Saturday night. 
Reading from her book of poetry 
entitlc:d Alphabetfor the Lost Years 
which contains poems for each let· 
ter of the alphabet, Schaeffer 
remarked that these poems had 
originally started out as riddles. 
Some time ago, she: said, someone 
pointed out to her that she hardly 
ever writes about anyone around 
her. For example, her husband or 
children. Schaefeer agreed but said 
she also thought a poet's work 
should be separate froin his personal 
life. 
Another poem she read, "The Bread," relates to the time when she was ill and her husband took over the cooking. Shaeffer said that she "became perversely dissatisfied with the agreement because I felt I was being replaced." A line from the poem states that "the loaves fed my children who I could not; they fed me." 
Shaeffer said that when one reviewer had criticized her for writing a poem about such an "unimportant animal as a cat," she began a pt·riod of writing poems ex­tensively on thisJ;ubject." 
Schaeffer said the poems she has been writing for the last year and a half "were totally unfit for human consumption," meaning that they were extremely long. She said that her shorter poems seem to have morbid concerns. One poem "Posthumous Poem," was written as if the person who had died was still capable ofspeaking.

The annual alumni phone-a-thonwill be held at Saint Mary's March 1-4, from 6:30p.m. to 11 p.m. The event will be in the basement of LeMans Hall, with student and faculty volunteers manning the phones. There will be 16 phones in use and Ann Hulme, student director, is hoping for 16-20 volunteers to work for one hour each. Each volunteer will caH alumni who have previously pledged over the phone. Arrangements will be made to see that callers are as comfortable as possible with refreshments being offered. In adtlition, volnteers will be offered a free long dis­
tance phone call for about five minutes. This year's goal is S50,000, slightly over last year's total ofclose to $48,000. This money is used as unrestricted income for running Saint Mary's. Hulme calls this a "nice chance for students to get involved in fund-raising." Call her at 4521 to sign up to man a phone; many volunteers are still needed.

United Auto Workers union members have ratified a historic concessions contract with Ford Motor Co., the union said yesterday as it completed eight days of voting. A1l but 10 of F~rd's UAW bargaining units had voted by Saturday, and the tally was 38,866 to 14,227 in favor ofthe contract, union officials said. The 10 remaining units voting Sunday had fewer than 14,000 votes, so even if every autoworker voted against the pact yesterday, ratification already was assured, UAW spokesman Donald Stillman said. Union officials had said that if ratified, the contract would go into effect today. The tentative contract, to run through Sept. 14, 1984, asks Ford's autoworkers to give up eight paid personal holidays per year, accept a wage freeze for the contract's duration and defer c .ost-of­living allowance payments for nine months. The automaker increas­ingly had been subcontracting work out to overseas and non-union plants in order to hold down labor costs to become more com­petitive with foreign carmakers. Ford, which lost S1.06 billion in 1981, has agreed to a two-year moratorium on plant closings related to subcontracting of work to overseas or non-union plants, strengthening of Suppplemental Unemployment Benefits and guaranteed income for higher seniority workers who are laid off. ­

Investigators have evidencelinking wayne B. Williams to 26 ofthe 28 slayings ofyoung blacks that cast a shadow over this city for more than two years, a source close to the case said yesterday. And officials will meet this week to consider closing the books on most of the slayings and disbanding the task force that investigated them. Williams, a 23-year-old black free-lance photog­rapher and self-styled talent scout, was sentenced to two con­secutive life terms Saturday night after a jury ofeight blacks and four whites convicted him of murdering Nathaniel Cater and jimmy Ray Payne. Asource close to the investigation, who asked not to be iden­tified, said authorities had collected evidence to link Williams to as many as 24 victims in addition to Cater and Payne. The source declined to discuss the nature of the evidence. Williams, who main­tains his innocence, has been held since his arrest and is likely to remain in the Fulton County Jail throughout appeals. -AP 
As President Reagan escalates military sup­port for El Salvador, his administration is being forced to defend its credibility against Democrats' charges that Americans are being misled about conditions in the war-torn Central American country. Increasingly, Democrats are claiming that a Reagan "credibility gap" may become the latest parallel with the Vietnam War. "The ad­ministration is so intent in following its ideology, it ignores the facts," charges Rep. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who visited El Salvador two weeks ago. "It tries to make the facts fit its ideology.~· The defense ofReagan's Salvadoran policy has fallen largely to Thomas 0. Enders, assistant Secretary in charge of American affairs, who also has drawn much of the criticism. In House and Senate testimony, Enders has depicted the civil war in El Salvador as "the decisive battle for Central America" and attacked organizations that compile human rights information about the country as biased in favor ofthe leftist guerrillas. But some Democrats contend the administration has overstated the Soviet and Cuban support for leftist insurgents and !anted facts about the human rights situation in El Salvador. ­

EntertainerJohnny Carson has been arrested for investigation ofdrunken driving, Beverly Hills police said yester­day. The arrest took place "a couple ofdays ago, maybe Thursday or Friday morning" on La Cienega Boulevard south of Beverly Boulevard, said Sgt. John Carden. However, he said he wasn't aut­horized to release any other details. He said he didn't know what time ofday the arrest occurred. "I assume he has to go to court," he said. Carson, host of the "Tonight" show and the Academy Awards ceremony, had a blood-alcohol content over .1 0 percent, the state measure for drunken driving, said Sgt. A. Arsdale. -AP 
A domestic travel ban was eased yesterday by Poland's martial law rulers, but Poles must still obey an all-night curfew, submit to strict censorship and cannot leave the country, according to the official news agency PAP. Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszcak, the nation's chief law enforcer, also warned in an interview carried by PAP that the government will crack down hard on any new "acts ofterrorism" and that dissidents who work against the Communist government's supreme authority may face deporta­tion. Polish radio also broadcast Roman Catholic bishops' call on authorities to resume talks with the independent Solidarity union, suspended when martial law was decreed Dec. 13 after 16 months of labor unrest. But the broadcast was a sharply edited version of the bishops' statement released Saturday, which also demanded an end to military rule. -AP

Changing for the better 
After four years at Saint Mary's, including three that have been spent at The Observer, I've begun to take a different look at many events that have taken place on both campuses, especially at Saint Mary's. 
Before I arrived on campus, the basic idea ofcollege, beside the padded point that I was attending Saint Mary's, was overwhelming. But after a few months on campus, the disillusionment began to sink in. As a senior, much ofthe dissatisfaction has remained but has evolved into concern. Ifjust a few things were changed, Saint Mary's would be an even better place. 
First, the parietal system must be changed. As it exists now, with visitation only on the weekends, the policy is archaic. The last revision in the parietal system was in 1974 when the visiting hours for male guests were ex­tended from 10 p.m. until 2 a.m., and another change is needed -fast. Trying to ignore the fact that Saint Mary's and Notre Dame students might actually like to 
socialize beyond the lobbies of their respective dorms is ridiculous. A SMC Student Government survey will be distributed today to determine attitudes toward the sys­tem. 
The system's basic elements (desk monitors, all guests escorted by hall residents) are realistic, but its hours (Fridays from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m., Saturdays from I 
p.m. until2 a.m. and Sundays from I p.m. to 5 p.m.) are 
not. A change to the hours fort spent on a poorly at­

Increased hours for male visitation would not change the concept of Saint Mary's College as a women's in­stitution, but simply would expand it in the realistic sense that men are a part of the world. ' 
The tenure system is another area of concern. Vice President and Dean of Faculty William Hickey made a two-hour appearance before the SMC Student Academic Affairs Council and interested students last week to answer many questions on t!le issue, but the subject is still very mysterious. Both students and the instituion arc affected by a tenure decision, but when a seemingly qualified teacher fulfills the listed criteria for a tenure candidate and is denied, students wonder. 
The complexities and confidentiality surrounding the system are difficult to sift, yet all are essential to the system as it now exists. Hickey states that every faculty member is aware of the elements ofthe system, yet the tenure process still remains a mystery to the student body. If tenure criteria could be more easily defined to students, at least students would know why a tenure decision was made. 
But even this issue brings up another problem: stu-

dent involvement, or, more precisely, the lack of it. Tenure only becomes an issue with students when professors are either given ordenied tenure. The rest of the year, the issue is nearly dead. And when students do take the time to comment, many ofthem have not taken the time to examine the issue from all sides: that of the faculty member, that of their own and that of the ad­ministration. 
The best criticisms are based on a knowledge of the system, providing power for one's argument. 
Student "uninvolvement" extends to other areas as well. I was in student government for three years and felt the frustration of planning, publicizing and hoping for an event to turn out well, only to see the same par­ticipants -the members of my hall council, class board and a handful of classmates -attend each function. It became frustrating after awhile. All that time and ef­
and Academic Affairs, Donna 
Perreault and Emmie Lopez, 
respectively, cite the push for the student center, the 
beginning of food sales, and research into the parietal 
and tenure systems as major accomplishments. 
But "working against tradition" has been a major 
struggle, according to Perreault. "Channels of com­
munication are established," and "encouraging innova­
tion" is often difficult. Even confidence in student 
government itself as a "vehicle of change," (a problem 
ND students face as well) has been disturbed. Next 
year's SBP Kathleen Murphy, Perreault noted, "is going 
to have to have a lot ofdrive" to fight the adherence to 
tradition, but it can be done. 
The problems facing Murphy are complex but not 
overwhelming. Saint Mary's has a student body with 
potential -women that come from the upper 12 per­
cent of their high school classes with backgrounds of 
involvement in extra-curricular activities -potential 
that is wasted if students waste their four years in the 
library. Take time to experience college, not just 
academics, while you're here.

P.O.BoxQ 
Students support boycott 
Dear Editor; After the "debate" 
between representatives of the Nestle 
corporation and spokespersons for 
INFACT. many students felt that 
neither side presented a very strong 
or convincing argument. Many 
others felt that what should have been 
the crux of the debate--corporate so­
cial responsibility in the Third 
World--was virtually ignored. Much 
confusion arose concerning that cor­
porate responsibilty because one side 
(Nestle) seemed unwilling to discuss 
the matter, and the other side 
( INFACT) seemed unable. To al­
leviate some of our own confusion 
surrounding the ambiguities of the 
debate and to make a responsible 
decision on Tuesday's boycott 
referendum, twelve students met 
with the Nestle representatives, 
Thelma Jackson and Susan Scanlan, 
we now feel that we have a better un­
derstanding of the issue. 
With this better understanding, we now realize that the issue is not whether Nestle and other multina­tional corporations have a place in Third World economies--They do! The issue is not whether the desire to maximize profits is an acceptable business motive--It is! The is~ue is 
Nestle's obligation to social respon­sibility, and after many attempts on our part to get the Nestle's representatives to address this issue, it became apparent that Nestle has not adequately developed a sense of corporate responsibility and usually avoids discussing it. When asked her view concerning not particularly Nestle's, but any multinational cor­poration's social responsibility toward the Third World nations with­in which they operate, Ms. Scanlan, the young corporate lobbyist, ex­plained innocently, "Hey I'm just a year out of college myself. I wouldn't know how to respond to a question like that." That's unfor­tunate, for our group truly desired a 
response. 
Mrs. Jackson, the other "representative," has worked forthe poor much of her life and expressed 
genuine concern for their socia~ c_on­ditions. Despite her obvious sin­cerity, she admittedly could establish no connection between her personal altruism and any policy of the Nestle corporation. In fact, when pressed to explain Nestle's policies regarding social and corporate responsibility, Mrs. Jackson exclaimed "I'm not a 
spokesman for Nestle! I'm a consult­ant. " Unfortunately, Mrs. Jackson's personal concern for the poor is not reflected in Nestle's policy deci­sions, and as a result of that, she is a false representation of that corpora­tion. It is therefore m,isleading when a person such as herself speaks at a public debate and leads people to believe that her own concern for the poor is reflected-i;N;;tle's p~actices­in the Third World. 
One major concern of Mrs. Jack­son was that the boycott is strictly an academic issue. She feels that since the poor of the Third World neither participate in, nor even understand, the boycott compaign, then our ef­forts at Notre Dame are in no way related to solving their problems. Perhaps Mrs. Jackson doesn't under­stand the boycott. Even though the poor of the Third World are not active in the boycott campaign, they are directly affected by the changes in Nestle's policies brought about by that campaign. Thus, it is doubtful that the poor have given up eating Nestle Crunch Bars (They've probably never even seen any) yet the same poor are directly affected by 
our decision to do so. 
Mrs. Jackson also expressed the opinion that, if we as students of Notre Dame truly wanted to brin~. about social change lri under­developed countries, then we would~ 
not participate in a "negative ac­tion" such as a boycott.-Sliesug­gested instead that we would initiate positve action such as critically discussing the issues in question with other Nestle representatives. According to Mrs. Jackson, our Boycott "precludes any possibility of constructive dialogue with Nestle." She and Ms. Scanlan went on to imply that if we at Notre Dame rescinded our boycott decision, then Nestle would be much more likely to be sensitive to our views. 
Clearly, Mrs. Jackson or anyone else who expouses such a view is greatly mistaken on this critical issue. Because we are not stock hol­ders in, or corporate executives for the Nestle corporation, but are in­stead students, the only means by 
which we can dialogue with Nestle is through our boycott. The boycott does not "preclude bur chances for dialogue with Nestle; " rather, it serves as our voice in any such dialogue. By continuing the boycott, 
Notre Dame's voice, along with that of many other concerned groups, can encourage Nestle's to stop avoiding, the issues and begin recognizing its 
'corporate social responsibility to the developing nations within which it operates. 
Finally, as a further example of our current ability to dialogue with Nestle, it seems obvious that if Notre Dame students didn't have a voice in this current dialogue and if our deci­sion tomorrow wasn't of vital impor­tance to Nestle, then this past week's deluge of printed materials, lectures, dinners, and discussions for Nestle representatives would never have swamped our campus. If we were to 
rescind our boycott decision tomor­
row, then Notre Dame would be the first major institution to withdraw its support from this, the largest· non­union based boycott in the history of the United States. By doing so, Notre Dame would in effect endorse Nestle's current practices, and that corporation would continue to avoid addressing the issue of corporate responsibility.

For example, a Dear Editor; I am pleased to know that the student body of Notre Dame University is giving serious ~·on­sideration to a current social and moral issue.

Many religious organizations including the Marianist Provincials and Assistant Provincials of the United States and Canada and the Justice and Peace Commission of the 
Archdiocese of Baltimore have en­dorsed the Nestle Boycott. These ac­tions were taken after due consideration of serious information about marketing practices of the Nestle Corportation, discussions with officials of that corporation, and participation in a dialogue with government officials relating to the code of breast milk substitutes by the World Health Organization. A fun­damental motivation for these en­dorsements is based on the moral imperative to protect human life and dignity of each person. This most fundamental value-the dignity of the human person-is the basis of the so­cial teaching of the Catholic Church and has been the central theme of 
Pope John Paul's speeches and writings. Over and over again he repeats the essential truths of human existence: Every person is the image of God, redeemed by Christ, created for an eternal destiny. From this es­sential dignity !lows fundamental human rights that cannot be violated by any person or any institutional structure. These rights include the right to essential goods such as nourishment, housing, education, health care and employment. We 
believe the promotion and marketing of Infant Formula by Nestle in developing countries have adversely affected the rate of infant mortality and morbidity in such areas, and such actions thereby violate the human rights of infants. 
It is in the ligt of the constant teaching of the Catholic Church, that these and other religious congrega­tions have given serious considera­tion to this issue and have taken a stand of advocacy for suffering and dying infants. 
Richard E. Ulrich

We, the members of the Notre Dame Farm Labor Organizing Com­mittee (NDFLOC), strongly believe that the evidence clearly indicates that the unethical and immoral busi­ness practices of Nestle S.A. in their marketing of infant formula has resulted in the gross exploitation of many unknowing mothers and defenseless children of the Third World. For this reason, NDFLOC firmly endorses this boycott and 
strongly urges the student body of this university o to vote in favor of the boycott of NestleS. A .. 
Despite the attempts of the Nestle 
S.A. lobby, this referendum is not meant to assert nor deny the value of corporations in modern society. This is not the issue at hand. Rather, the issue is human lives, more specifical­ly, the callous disregard for infant lives in the underdeveloped nations of the world in the name of profit maximization.

WASHINGTON--Steven Jobs has done OK for a college dropout. In tive years, the 26-year-old

I desperation for many people. They get laid off'' or view their current jobs as uncertain. 
Tight money didn't prevent private investors from raising $1.3 billion in new venture capital funds for potentially-profitable ideas last year (the bulk was for the high­technology area). or six times the amount accumulated six years ago. 
Of course, n.:latively few new businesses succeed, let alone gain the attention of a national news magazine. For every bankruptcy, 
' stories, magazines such as Time and People often downplay the fact that new businesses take three to eight years, many thousands ofdollars and immeasurble personal sacrifice to get off the ground. As Herb Jackson dis­covered, it doesn't come easy. 
" I wanted to make something well or not do it at all," said the Uni­versity of North Carolina graduate, who never left Chapel Hill. 
Yet, like Steven Jobs, Jackson had a hunch that his idea could sell.

Hispanic Authors Forum

Writers attend international assembly 
By CHRIS FRASER 
Features Writer 
A world-renowned group of Hispanic writers will visit the Notre Dame campus tomorrow and Wednesday. The reason for this onslaught of Hispanic culture is an inter­national forum entitled "Present and Future of 
Hispanic Literatures" ( Presente y futuro de las literaturas hispanicas). The guests will in­clude ten writers from Spain and twenty-two writers from eight Latin American countries. 
On both days, the writers will present 
Spanish writers at the forum 
Ten ofthe participants in the "International Forum of Hispanic Writers" hail from Spain. But it would be an error -and also gross oversimplification -on our part to view this Spanish contingent as simply that, ten Spaniards coming from a single, homogenous country. The reason for this is that they are not simply Spaniards, just as their home country is not simply Spain. It is important to take into account that a wide spectrum of Spanish geography, mentalities, and culture will be represented by their visit with us: 
Madrid, Barcelona, the regions ofAsturias in 
the north and Andalucia in the south, the Ca­
nary Islands (in the Atlantic off the coast of 
Morocco), and finally the Spaniard who no 
longer resides in the nation given him by 
birthright -the exile. All from one country, 
yes; but each bringinga different valise, travel­
ing with baggage ofhis own. 
These writers represent some of the finest .iterature to come out ofSpain in the past ·hirty years. They have been recognized at iJome and abroad by many important literary .twards (the Nadal, te Planeta, the Bibliotech Breve, the Tauras, etc.), among them they have been translated into more than thirty lan­guages, and their works are and have been the subject ofserious study. Their literary production has spanned many diferent genres: the novel, the short story, poetry, the essay, reviews, and hybrid genres o their own 
.nvention. On display in the main concourse '>f the Memorial Library will appear photographs ofall of them along with a repre­
sentative survey oftheir works: Carlos Harral ( 1928):Anos de penitencia, Los anos sin ,·xcusa, and Usurasy figuraciones. Barra! \Vas the head editor ofone ofBarcelona's most important publishing houses and he is known for his memoirs and poetry, the l(>rmer ofwhich are not a simple indul­gence in the restatement ofhistorical facts but rather a re-creative rendering ofhis past which becomes material more for a fictionalized account than for methodic recollection. 
Jose Maria Castellet ( 1926): La bora de/lector, Un cuarto de siglo de poesia espanola, andlniciacion a Ia poesia de SalvadorEspriu. Castellet is widely known 
as a fine literary critic whose keenly 
round table sessions open to the public on 
three topics: New Models in the Hispanic Novel t 10:00-11 :~0 a.m.) 
Latin American and Spanish Influence on the New Generation of Narrators (3:00-4:00 p.m.) Unity and Diversity ofHispanic Literatures ( 4:30-5:30 p.m.) 
The topics will be discussed at these times on both days allowing different writers to express their opinions. The format will also permit a question and answer period follow­ing the presentations. 
·ceptivc eye has made the comprehension and elucidation on difficult writers and texts more readily available not only for the reader at large but also for the in­terested specialist. 
Ana Maria Matute ( 1926):Primera memoria, Los soldados /loran de noche, andLa trampa. Matute has been referred to by CamiloJose Cela as having written the single most important work by a woman in Spain since the turn ofthe cen­tury. Her literary world is highly stylized, personal, poetic, and often confronts the reader, by means of the abrupt juxtaposi­tion ofa subjective reality with crude and violent acts manifested outwardly with a pessimisic view oflife. 
Jose Agustin Goytisolo ( 1928):£/ retorno, Claridad,Algosucede. This eldest of the three Goytisolo brothers (Juan and Luis being important novelists) is a fine poet who has also distinguished himselfas an anthologist ofcomtemporary Catalan poetry. 
Angel Gonzalez ( 1925): Poe mas, Palabra sobre palabra, andAspero mundo. Gonzalez is recognized as one of the finest poets in contemporary Spain and is held in high esteem by a generation of younger poets. His poetry bears the stamp ofa highly polished and personal worldview. 
Daniel Sueiro ( 1932 ): La rebusca y otras disgracias, La criba, and Laver­dadera historia del Valle de los Caidos. 
Sueiro, in the last title above, with nar­rative mastery weaves a story as revealing as it is full ofpassion: the other side of the coin ofFranco's erection ofa monument to himself, a different echo, a different meaning. 
Femando Sanchez Drago ( 1936): 
Gargorisy Habidis (Los origenes, Ciclos cristianos, Mirwrias y marginaciones). 
Sanchez Drago, a noted author and politi­cal activist, currently hosts a cultural and literary show on Spanish televison. Gar­gorisy Habidis: Una historia magica de Espana, his first book-length publication, is an ambitious quartet of"impossible 
See Spanish, page 7 
The increasing popularity of Hispanic literature -especially Latin American literature -makes this forum particularly interesting and significant. As recently as the turn of the century, Hispanic literature and Spanish literature were virtually one and the same. But in the last half-decade, the Latin Americans have built a reputation to the point where they are now producing some of the most widely acclaimed and translated literature in the world. The wide range of themes and the mystical character of Latin American literature is perhaps the main reason for its growing appeal. According to the New York Times, "American publishers increasingly view (Latin American literature) as a vast untapped resource." Reviewers around the world have praised Latin American novels for their fantasy, metaphor, and satire. 
During the 1950s and 1960s, when success­ful Latin American authors were beginning to emerge, Spanish literature, with its rich tradi­tion ofCervantes and Don Quixote, seemed to concentrate mainly on topics relating to the Spanish Civil War of 1939. Perhaps in recognition of the variety and spice in Latin American literature, modern Spaniards arc 
branching out into new themes and styles. A 
sort offriendly competition has broken out 
between writers from the two regions. 
The Hispanic forum here at Notre Dame is 
certainly a symbol ofthis competition and of 
the mutual respect that has developed among 
Hispanic authors. Similar meetings have been 
held in recent years in Mexico, Venezuela, the 
Canary Islands, and at the University of 
California (Berkeley). The forum has been 
made possible largely through the coopera­
tion and generosity ofseveral institutions: the 
Office ofCultural Affairs of Mexico, the Na­tional Institute ofFine Arts (Mexico), the In­stitute ofIbero-American Cooperation (Spain), and the University of Notre Dame. Forum organizersjose Anadon, Anturo Azuela, Russell Cluff, and Michael Doyle bring experience to the planning and coordination ofthe activities. 
This international forum will provide a 
fascinating dialogue concerning the future of 
Hispanic literature. The impressive assembly 
ofwriters and the widespread recognition of 
the quality of modern Hispanic literature 
reveal the importance ofsuch a gathering. The 
future of Hispanic literature may not be cer­
tain, but as Professor Doyle notes, "the fron­
tier is wide open." This week at Notre Dame, 
this entourage of Hispanic authors may shed 
some light on where this frontier could lead.

Latin Atnerican literature receives U.S. acceptance 

ByGREGORYS~RCZ 
f'l!atures Editor 
Latin American literature is finding a new market in the United States. According toJose Anadon, Associate professor and moderator of the forum, the rise of litt:rary techniques and the interest in delving into national culture have made Latin American literature gain in prominence and availability. 
In a recent artkk in The New York Times entitkd "U.S. Is Discovering Latin America's Literature." Edwin McDowdl states that an increasing number of American book publis­hers arc scrambling to receive English transla­tions of many works, due to the freshness of tht· previously untapped literary resource. 
Anadon, in an address at a Spanish collo­quium Feh. 19, said thc rise of Latin American literature is due to the authors' mastery of litt-rary techniques and the vocalization ofso­da! conditions in the authors' respective countries. 
Tht· "boom" in Latin American \Vritings is attributed to the 1960's influence ofCarlos Fuentes. His precedent-setting style and ft:ar­lcss attempts at experimenting with various modes ofliterature allowed authors the freedoms to try differing methods. In 1973, when Fuentes was at his peak, other authors began to take different paths, and a new 
generation of writers emerged. 
Changing themes permitted Latin American writers to rise in popularity. Mexican writer Arturo Azuela began to write of the dt·mographic explosion of the urban areas. Mexico City, a city of 2 million, now has a population of 16 million. With a projected size of 30 million before the turn oftbe cen­tury, the engultinent oflittle towns enriched in Mexican culture poses a social dilemma many writers sec and arc speaking out on. 
Four main factions separate the Latin American authors: the Romantics, reminis­cent ofpast litcrary styles; the Realists, stres­sors of the truth; the Cosmopolitans, the viewers of the naturalistic scenes in life; and the Exiles, the writers not concerned by nor­mal conventions. 
What could be interesting at this year's Forum may he the conglomeration of these writers speakingout about topics usually kcpt private by the differing factions. 
This spring the Notre Dame Press has 
chosen to print the English translation ofAr­
turo Azuela's latest novel Manifestacion de 
silencios. This is evidence that the Interna­
tional Forum tomorrow and Wednesday will 
be an interesting way to trace the emergence 
ofLatin American litcraturc.

Perspectives ,backgrounds unite Spanish authors

L
iterature is the medium by which people attempt to communicate an attitude or an emotion through the written word. As much as the genres differ, the people who use them vary as welL Perspectives differ according to ex­perience and background. Very often, however, a group ofauthors arc drawn togeth­er by a specific historical or sociological event that leaves its imprint upon each of them. Such is the case with the authors from Spain, involved in the International Forum of Hispanic Writers. 
Shortly after the end ofthe Spanish Civil War, numerous novels appeared. taking up the themes ofdevastation and tragedy that resulted from the nation's internal strife. The authors dealt with exile from their homeland in a physical sense, but more commonly, with the inner exile that set Spaniard against Spaniard. Authors wcre obsessed with writing the "exile" novel as if to exorcise the War from themselves. 
In The Spanish Civil War, Hugh Thoms wrote, "Spcctors caused the war and after­ward, ghosts dominated the country." Those that had lived through it felt the abiding presence of the ideological ghosts that survived the establishment of Franco's reign. When about 1970 a Spanish literary revival occurred, those ghosts influenced even the writers who were a generation removed from the actual experience. 
The authors that emerged in the seventies

JJ. Armas Marcelo ( 1946 ):Estado t de coma, Calima and Guia secreta de Canarias. Recipient of the Pn:mio Galdos in 1975, Armas Marcelo immerses the reader in a world both condradictory and circular, a world in which episodes arc painted in a language that is baroque and burlesque, tragic and sarcastic. 
Jose Maria Vaz de Soto ( 19 3H ): Dialogos de anochecer, El precursor, and El infiernoy Ia brisa. Vaz de Soto is Profes­sor ofLiterature at tht· Institute of.\11 artinez .\1ontancs in Seville. A master ofcomposi­tion in colloquial voices, in the third novel 
retained the last strains of the Civil War theme. Their temporal perspective was becoming more removed from the actual event. The war that had been their parents' ex­perience became more dream-like through the distance. The brutal reality lost its con­crete materialism. Though it no longer possessed the color and impact that it had originally contained, the Civil War theme remained the dominant one in that dct·adc's literature. 
The reasons for the continued t·mphasis on the effects of the war is explained hy Ana Maria Matute. She believes that these authors arc a frustrated generation hy mandate. The tragic regentration of the devastation of the war was caused by the parents because by making the war, they had cut short their children's formative years. As tht· children passed to adulthood, it seems as though they were able to put the war behind tht·m. Unfor­tunately, they frustrated themselves by adopt­ing the Civil War atmosphere, thus continuing the regenerative cyck. 
The novels created by this frustrated generation maintained the Civil War theme, yet tended toward the imaginative or "fantastic." Their perspective took on a sub-' jcctivc stance because of the familial in­fluence on the authors. The move away from the realistic war accounts to the "fantastic" literature suggests that perhaps the theme is beginning to run dry. 
The question for present-day Spanish authors is what rclevann· the Civil War theme has for today, and how it applies to the present reality. The object ofthe forum is to address the present and future ofllispanic literature and discover where it will go thematically. 
mentioned above he explort·s the world of a group ofadolescents who arc enrolled in a religious boarding school, delving not only into the education they receive ptr se (the repression and the injustices) hut also into Spain's developmt·nt during the post­Civil War year~.

The Observer -Paid Advertisement Monday, March 1, 1982-page 8 

The students of Notre Dame will be asked to vote tomorrow on the question of whether to boycott Nestle products. Those who advocate the boycott do so on the basis that they believe they cannot prove that Nestle is following the W~rld Health Organization Code for the Marketing of Infant Formula in developing countries. Nestle says that it is implementing the Code, and has testified before the U.S. Congress pledging its support for the Code. Nestle, through its marketing people, is implementing policies which carry out the Code process in every developing country without a national code. The company follows all national codes already 
\.~> 
enacted.
"~' 
'"' 
I 
.. ti,' 
~-·. ' 
. ~ 
No other major manufacturer of infant formula has announced such support for the Code and Nestle does not expect its competition to live by the same rules Nestle applies to itself. 
One section of the Code ( 11.4) provides for any individual with evidence of a grievance under the' Code to report that evidence to the national health ministry involved and the formula manufacturer for investigation and correction. There have been a few allegations of grievances against Nestle under the Code 
each has been thoroughly investigated and found to be without foundation. The small number of grievances 
(fewer than 50 since the adoption of the Code nine months ago) clearly shows company policy does not permit 
violation of the Code. Nestle markets infant formula in developing nations with total population of more than 
one billion people ifNestle w~re at odds with the aim and principles of the Code, there would be at least hundreds of grievances lodged. 
Nestle does not advertise to mothers, does not give them samples of infant formula, does not carry out retail marketing schemes and does not promote the product to them in any way. 
We believe that simple fairness demands that even a corporation be considered to be telling the truth until there is strong evidence to the contrary. We don't believe such evidence exists in the case ofNestle and certainly none has been brought before us or the students of Notre Dame. Nestle has gone a long way to ensure that it is the most ethical marketer of :infant formula in the world and that it should be congratulated for that effort, not punished. We believe those who wish to bring harm to our company, its employees and their families have the obligation to establish some reason for doing so. 
A great University likeNotre Dame cannot be less than fair.

vantage in the first period. 
Even though the Irish no.tched their twentieth victory of the year, the first time an Irish team had done so since the 1976-77 season, Smith was not entirely pleased with the team's play. "Our poor play in our defensive zone really concerns me as we get ready to head into the play­offs," Smith remarked. "Not giving up goals is very important in the 
play-offs." 
The entire parents' week-end series was marked by very physical play from both teams which resulted in several injuries. Bronco defen­seman Glenn Johannesen was taken out in Saturday's contest with a probable separated right shoulder after crashing into the Notre Dame end boards. By the end of the game, Notre Dame was down to just four defenseman after Joe Bowie reinjured his hand and Jim Brown was forced to leave the game after blocking a Western Michigan scoring attempt. Both players should be ready to play by the week­end. 
A minor cut to Rothstein Saturday night brought to six the number of players nursing wounds in time to open the play-offs. Poulin is still questionable for next week-end's series with Michigan, but all the other injured plyers should be ready to play by then. A specially designed

Chuck Constable, a freshman from North Babylon, New York, broke Ed Broderick's 14-year old Notre Dame record when he high jumped 6-10 1/2 to place sixth in 11­lini Classic in Champaign, Ill. Satur­day. 
"I'm really happy to see Chuck qualify for the IC4A's," said Irish sprint coach Ed Kelly. "He's worked conscientiously and he's going to jump a lot higher than that," added Kelly. 
Greg Bell finished third in the long jump with a leap of 24-3. It is the second week in a row that Bell has jumped over 24 feet. "Its good to see Greg jump so consistently well,"said Kelly. "If he gets a good week of practice, he'll have a good 
shot at breaking the school record 
next weekend." The record in the 
long jump is 24-4 1/2. 
The Irish had several other good 
performances in the meet, though 
no team scores were kept. The mile 
relay team of Eady, VanEyken, 
Ribera, and Kania finished sixth with 
a time of 3:1 7. 5 -only one second 
off the school record. 
Coming off a three-week layoff 
due to injury. freshman Tim Cannon 
ran a 4:11.8 mile, which was good 
for eighth place. Sophomore Andr 
Dillon plau.d eighth with a fine 8:52 
two-mile. Senior John McCloughan 
placed sewnth in the high hurdles. 
Some good performances that did 
not place in the meet wereJim Tyler 
and Rick Rogers with times of 1 :5 3.8 
and 1:54.0 respectively in the half­
mile, Tony Hatherly's 2:13 1000­
