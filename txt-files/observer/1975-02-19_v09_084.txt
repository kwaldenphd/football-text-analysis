Students, administrators respond 

Reactions to Calendar vary 
by Bob Mader Starr Reporter 
"We were led to believe that the 
Thanksgiving break would be an 'extended' 
break." Student Body President Pat 
McLaughlin said yesterday in response to 
the 1975-76 Academic Calendar. 
"~rue, we didn't get a signed, sealed, and delivered statement from the Academic Council stating how long the break would be." McLaughlin noted. "But when it was proposed and publicized as being so popular. no mention was made that it was unfeasible. It just boils down to the fact that we have been had." 
The calendar for the next academic year which was released yesterday from the office of Leo Corbaci, dean of ad­ministration. lists September 3 as the first class day. 
The only break for the first semester, which ends December 20, occurs over the Thanksgiving holiday between November 26 and November 30. There are 71 total class days in the semester. 
According to Richard Conklin, Director of Information Services, who sat in at the Academic Council meetings, virutally all those who proposed a post Labor Day start were willing to accept a shortened Thanksgiving vacation in return. 
''There's no perfect calendar," Conklin said. "It's been Fr. Burtchaell's point all along that when you get one thing you have to give up another. You can't have your eake and eat it. too." 
Conklin added that there was no stipulation of <1 definite number of days for Thanksgiving break in the Council's debate of the issue. 
McLaughlin was particularly angry that no Administration source responsible for making up the academic calendar had brought up the impossibilty of a week-long Thanksgiving break while the issue was being discussed. "They surely had to know that that was the basic assumption being made." he said. 

Grace proposed 


Academic Council members gave two reasons for assuming the Thanksgiving break would be a week long. First, in the Student Government survey of student and faculty opinion on the calendar issue, three out of the four proposals were for a post­Labor day start. 
One of the proposals called for no mid­semester break and a "long" Thanksgiving break. Another proposal was for no mid­semester break, a short Thanksgiving break. and an earlier end to the semester. The third proposal called for two short breaks. These proposals assumed that by eliminating the midsemester break a number of extra days would be available. 
Secondly. according to Council member Fr. Ernan McMullin, Burtchaell made a motion for a calendar consisting of a mid­semester break and a one-day Thanksgiving break. McMullin said this comparison with the one-day break makes the four-and-one­half day vacation an "extended" break in that context. 
Student representatives on the council, Thomas Wilhelmy and Susan Hicks, both 

Coed living suggested 
by Maurt't"n }<'lynn Starr Reportt"r 
Fr. Thomas McNally, rector of Grace. yesterday submitted a proposal to the Committee on Undergraduate Life that would set up an experiment in co--educational living in Grace Hall. Conceding that prospects were dim that anything would come of his proposal this year, McNally said he and others in Grace thought the plan should be considered nevertheless. 
"Our proposal might have merit or it might not." he admitted. "My only point is that it deserves a hearing. I don't think the issue of coeducational living can be shoved under the table forever." 
Following discussions among McNally, various Grace residents, 
and  assistant  rectors  William  
Beauchamp,  Fr.  Claude  
Pomerleau.  and  Fr.  Donald  

McNeill last fall, the plan was submitted to the University Of­ficers for consideration. Ac­cording to McNally, however, ''Those who studied the housing situation apparently gave it only a quick look." 
"Fr. Burtchaell, University Provost, wrote me that the officers did not wish to consider our coed living proposal in depth," McNally continued, "because they were simply trying to figure out whether to give women preferential access to campus living, and if so, where they could find a net increase in beds." 

Under the Grace proposal, 100 female undergraduates would be housed in one of the sections on floors 2,3, 4 and 5. The other section on the four floors would house male residents. Students wishing to live on the coed floors would be interviewed beforehand to determine their attitudes toward participation in the program and the reponsibility involved. 
There are three key points in­volved in the program as proposed: 
--All residents would understand that the program was an ex­pl"rinH'nt which could be ter­minated at the end of the school year. 
--The men and women would volunteer to take part in the ex­perience, and would be in­terviewed to make sure that they agreed with the educational goals and value orientation of the program. 
--The men and women who resided in Grace would commit themselves to self and group evaluations before, during, and at the end of the year. 
Could upgrade hall life 
"Although we concede there are many questions left unanswered," the plan concluded, "we suggest that this plan is basically sound and, if successful, could sub­stantially upgrade hall life on campus." 
Commenting on the Grace proposal, McNally noted that it is squarely in line with recom­mendations contained in the report of the Committee on University Priorities (COUPl, which urge the University to make the total en­vironment of the residence halls "conductive to every proper kind of personal growth." 
"It's difficult for me to see how we can completely discount the possibility that this 'personal growth' might be furthered for many in a coed living situation within a few halls," McNally stated. "In fact, the experience elsewhere strongly suggests that this is exactly what happens when such coeducational living arrangements are carefully structured and evaluated by staff and students alike." 
Sr. John Miriam Jones, assistant to the provost, agreed that "there are a lot of things to be gained in bringing men and women together in situations in which they can meet and communicate," and observed that the issue of coed dorms has been considered in the past. 
"We've talked about this for several years, but not as a timely consideration," said Jones. "Other universities have had good and bad resultswith coed housing." 
"The close proximity of men and women, the informality of en­counters, etc. are all good. And from a purely pragmatic point of 
(continued on page 10) 
point to the proposals of the student government survey as being the source of 
the assumption. 
Professor Raymond Brach stated, ''My understanding is that the break would be based on the length of the semester as determined by Labor Day, along with an 
attempt  to  keep  a  balance  between  the  
semesters."  
Professor  Arthur  Quigley  said  the  

Academic Council set only guidelines for making the calendar with no specification of days. 
Corbaci stated that the Academic Council had determined only three guidelines. These three would be a post-Labor Day start. one break only during the semester, and that the break would occur over Thanksgiving. 
There are other guidelines, according to Corbaci, which were adopted when the academic calendar was revised in 1969 to end the first semester before Christmas. Among these were guidelines for the date of commencement, placement of the Easter break, number of exam days required, and that there should be a balance in the number of days in each semester. 
Commenting on this, Student represen­tative Mark Seal said, "The American Bar Association says every law school must have thirteen weeks in each semester. Now there isn't any such requirement for un­dergraduates. but there's a feeling among university officials across the country that it's kosher to have 72 class days." 
"With a week off at Thanksgiving next yearwe'dhave6Bclassdays," Corbaci said. 
·'But what happens in the following years wr.ere Labor Day falls on the sixth or the seventh 7 It would be a farce." 
Hicks supported Corbaci's statement. "It has to do with getting an education," she commented. "A semester here should be the equivalent of what it is at other schools." 
McLaughlin and Academic Commissioner .James Ambrose held differing opinions. "A full week at Thanksgiving would give us a mere HB class days," McLaughlin stated. "However, we know that 68 dayc; would not 
affect our accreditation nor would it be at 
great variance with the 73 spring class 
days. The number of class days argument is 
worthless." 

When asked about following years in 
which Labor Day would be later than next 
year, he said, "I think the calendar should 
be reviewed each year. It always has been 
since I've been here." 

Ambrose also felt that a short first semester would have little effect. "Notre Dame has a good enough reputation that other universities wouldn't downgrade us for the length of our semester.I'd prefer 68 days but there doesn't seem to be much we can do about it now. If the students feel there is a need for a change I suppose it could be brought up to Fr. Burtchaell and be put on the agenda of the next Council 
meeting." 

McMullin also commented, "I see nothing magical about a certain number of class days." 
There was a general feeling in the Academic Council that they had passed a calendar which the students would want, according to Quigley. "There was a good feeling," he said, "that the community got what it wanted." 
"I'm really disappointed in the com­plaints from the students," said student representative Mark Seal. "We didn't vote for our own preferences but what we felt the majority of people wanted. I think there would be complaints. though, with any calendar." 
"I guess I was mislead as a lot of other people were,'' stated Sr. John Miriam Jones, assistant to the provost. "But when J counted up the number of class days I found there was still only 71." 
McLaughlin was probably the most bitter. 
''I can only fault my own naivete for believing that a good decision had been made. I can only fault myself for believing that our input was really input. I can only blame myself for thinking that the com­munity voice was really heard," he said. 
"I don't know what else they want," said Corbaci. 
Disciplined students used by Macheca 
by Terry Keent>y 
News Editor 

Dean of Students John Macheca has used undergraduate students facing disciplinary action by the University as Security personnel for the University. 
When eontacted last night about the practice, Brother Just l'aczesny. vice president for Student Affairs and Macheca's im­nwdiate superior, stated he did not know of it and did not approve of it. 
"I do not necessarily approve of using students for guard duty hleause I would judge they would not be conscientious in their performance of their duty," Paczesny said. 
"The fact that the practice is going on surprises me," Paczesny eontinued. "My preference is that for any student guards we use wt put them in our hire." 
l\Jacheca declined to comment on the matter last night. 
Since last August. Macheca has used about seven students who have eome to his office for disciplinary action to perform security duties instead of receiving some other punishment for violating llniversity rules and regulations. 
These students have primarily served as patrolmen in the student. faculty and visitors parking lots. The students performing these functions as a result of Macheca 's disciplinary action sup­plement a force of about eight undergraduates who patrol regularly as paid employees of theUniversity. 
The students who have worked for Security as disciplinary punishment did so as an alternative to other punishment. For txample, two cases involved students who worked off a financial debt from traffic fines by patrolling the parking lots until that debt was paid in services rendered. 
"It seems like Macheca likes to do it when possible," said one student who was disciplined by patrolling the parking lots. "It seems to be a common thing," said another student who received the same punishment. The students involved seemed to prefer their punishment through Security duties to the alternative punishment. One student commented, "I didn't think it was that bad. It was probably good to have the guys out there <in the parking lots)." 
"I would rather give up a few weekends than pay so much money." another disciplined student concluded. Fines are sometimes implemented as another form of punishment.

HPC focuses on '75-'76 calendar 
by Martha Fanning Staff Reporter 

The HPC meeting held last night in LaFortune focused on the 1975­76 academic calendar released 
.Monday. Other issues discussed were Mardi Gras and the bill to lower the drinking age to 18. 
The main objection to the new calendar was the elimination of the mid-semester break with no in­crease in the Thanksgiving holiday break. 
Student Body President Pat McLaughlin relayed information on the calendar to the council. "The Academic Council is the only one who can change the calendar. From the survey everyone assumed that the Thanksgiving break would be extended," he said. 
McLaughlin went on to say that the number of class days in the two semesters should be close to the same. "If we got a week off at Thanksgiving the first semester would have 68 class days, the second 73 class days," he noted. 
une suggestion from Jerry Hayden, president of Stanford, was that two Saturdays be made class days, the Saturday before Thanksgiving and the one before finals. He proposed that the Monday and Tuesday before Thanksgiving could then be in­cluded in the break. This would keep the number of class days the same. 
There was also a suggestion made by McLaughlin to invite Fr. James Burtchaell, Provost, to the next HPC meeting. 
HPC chairman Bob Howl agreed with this idea ~nd stated, "Fr. Burtchaell will be invited to the next meeting and a letter to the chairman of the Faculty Senate will be sent.'' 
The Mardi Gras was also discussed at the meeting with Dan Sullivan, <lJairman.of the Mardi Gras Committee, present to an­swer any questions and hear suggestions from council mem­
>ers. 

Sullivan, commenting on the 
success of the Mardi Gras stated, 
"This year's was one of the most 
successful ever held if not the most 
successful. The final amount 
grossed by the event was ap­
proximately forty-eight thousand 
dollars, but the net earnings have 
not yet been calculated." 

Sullivan explained that the raffle 
had been a success with 12,500 
tickets sold and approximately 
6000 dollars made. "The quota 
system could have turned out 
better than it did. Next year, the 
committee might be able to find an 
organization so off-campus 
students can sell tickets with a 
lower quota," he said.

Senior Class has Formal 
by John Feeney Staff Reporter 

The Senior Class will sponsor a Formal dance on March 15 to be held in the Coocord Lexington Ballroom at the H~Jliday Inn in Elkhart, Indiana. 
Two different packages are being offered, one which includes a dinner and dance ticket and another for just the dance. The dance and dinner package offers a roast sirloin beef dinner with wine and a 3-hour open bar, ( 1 hour before dinner and 2 hours after) all for $26.00. Those who attend the dinner will be given a 10lh oz. wine goblet with the following in­scription: "Senior Class Formal ­Isle of Connemara -March 15, 1975". Tickets for just the dance cost $12.00 and include the 2 hour open bar after the dinner. 
"We've contracted a good band from Chicago to play that night," said Joe Henderlong, chairman of the organization committee. "Only seniors are allowed to buy a ticket," he continued, "But people of other classes can accompany them." 
When asked about tran­sportation, Henderlong stated, "Our major source of tran­sportation will be cars, with buses as an outside possibility. Since it is so close we don't anticipate that many problems with tran­sportation." 
A special feature of the ticket packages is a 25 percent discount coupon, redeemable at The Posy Patch for corsages or bouton­nieres, which can be picked up along with the ticket. 
Tickets will be on sale through the end of February at both the North and South Dining Halls, as well as at St. Mary's. Seating arrangements can be made when tickets are picked up.

'Consultive not legislative' 




SLCS role and future discussed 
by Mariano~ Schulte 
Staff Reporter 

On January Zl, Student Body President Pat McLaughlin proposed major revisions in the power and membership of the Student Life Council. The SLC has since involved itself in self­evaluation, in re-assessing its goals and its status in the University community. 
The conception of a student life council at Notre Dame originated body was to be concerned with "certain areas of student life, including but not limited to social and recreational opportunities, residence halls, medical and psychological facilities, disciplinary rules, fairness of University procedure, spiritual and intellectual life and ad­missions and scholarship policy." 
In forming the new tripartite body. the trustees said they hoped that the SLC would "bring to light 
In brief, the SLC was to concern itself with the passing of legislation regarding the problems of the contemporary college campus. This legislation is subject to veto by the president of the University, Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, representing the Board of Trustees of the university. 
Especially after Hesburgh's veto of the new sexuality code proposed after considerable debate by the SLC, the contemporary ef-

in a meeting of the Board of Trustees seven years ago in response to student requests for 
reforms  in  a  number  of  areas  
affecting student life.  
At  that  time,  the  trustees  

proposed "new structures" for the adaptation and implementation of appropriate standards of conduct, and approved the principle of ''equal representation of faculty, administration, and students on a legislative University Student Life Council, with a comparable structure for adjudication and review in serious disciplinary measures," as declared in a Statement of Policy on Student Life by the board on May 15, 1968. 
However, it was also provided for in the by-laws of the Student Life Council that actions taken by the tri-partite body exercising legislative or judicial functions "should stand unless the President in good conscience cannot approve them. in which latter event fhe right to appeal to the board may be granted." 
Prior to the establishment of the SLC. there had been no major legislative body containing student representation. The legislative and apply the composite good sense and good will, fairness and generosity of the total ND com­munity." 
They continued to state, "While the Board recognizes the need of the University to adapt itself to a changing world, it is firmly resolved to hold fast to those values that have made Notre Dame an enriching experience, intellectual and spiritual, for so many thousands of her sons." 
With a twenty-four member body consisting of eight members each of administration, faculty, and student factions, it was desired that an adequate representation of the many diverse opinions of the total Notre Dame community would be reflected. 
As was cited in the trustees' statement of Policy on Student Life. "a true community is not one in which everybody agrees with t>verybody else on every subject, but it is one in which the basic purposes of the institution are shart>d and respected by the constituency and in which discussion, and indeed, debate are conducted with mutual respect, tolerance and civility."

Patterson men· tioned that these criticisms of Congress are very old and had

fectiveness of the council's power 
as a legislative body has been 
questioned. 
Frank Flanagan, student body 
vice-president and current SLC 
chairman stated yesterday that he 
viewed the powers of the SLC as 
limited due to Hesburgh's veto 
power. and regarded the work of 
the council as being "consultative, 
not legislative." 
Dr. Robert Ackerman, Director of Professoonal Development of Student Affairs, pointed out that Hesburgh has always had the right of veto. as provided for in the original by-laws of the council's charter. He emphasized that "if the students are seeking absolute control, they will never acquire it, because no students have absolute control." 
Dr. Phillip Faccenda, University generalcounsel,echoedAckerman in saying that "nothing has changed. The council still maintains the same degree of power it was endowed with in the original by-laws." 
"I'm not aware of any other administrative body on the college level whose decisions are not subject to the president's veto," he added. 
Faccenda cited one problem of the SLC to be the "council had been set up for a different time." At th1! time of its founding, the students had no other officially organized body in which they could openly discuss and debate current problems with administrators. The establishment of the Student Life Council was a major step forward in the area of student­administration communications," he said. 
Ackerman suggested that the seeming loss in potency might be attributed to the fact that students have a variety of other channels of communication open to them today in which they can direct their ef­forts to effect change. "At the time of the SLC formation, these other channels, including student government, were not well organized," Ackerman observed. 
Flanagan stressed that the students must be active to show concern. "Student activism behind the council has subsided," has been lacking in past SLC he said. Faccenda, however, said meetings, according to Flanagan.that he "did not detect any lack of Ackerman, however, does not support in the SLC."

The Big Con 
The Placement Bureau is a scene of needless anxiety and competition every Monday morning. If students must stand in line as early as 4:30 a.m. and wait there for three hours until the office opens, something is internally wrong with the present interview sign-up system. 
The new policy, which limits Monday sign-ups to only three interviews a week per student, does not solve any of the real problems facing the Bureau. It does not allow room for many more names o·n the interview schedules as Richard Willemin, director of the Placement
J 
Bureau suggested, but only a select few. But this plan does not nearly come close to giving an equal opportunity forf all registered seniors to sign up for in­
l 
terviews. 
Willemin stated that approximately 1400 students are signed up with the Office. This is about 500 more than previous years. 
I With the increased registration and the 
! 
? large number of interview cancellations (50 as of Feb. 5 and only 7 additions), the Placement Bureau is indeed in an un­fortunate situation. 
Indeed, it is also unfortunate that the c.ffice cannot guarantee equal time for each student. It is unfair to those 
I students who consistently are "closed­, ut" of an interview, especially when 1heir degrees limit them to only a few interviews a week. 
It is disheartening for students who wait in line for an hour or longer only to discover that their names must appear 10'th on a waiting list.

had "extended" as meaning the week around Thanksgiving. Even the term "short Thanksgiving break" was misunderstood by students and faculty, who took it to mean Thursday and Friday. 
The deck was stacked, and the dealer was telling no one. What is reprehensible is the manner in which members of the Administration, who were fully aware of the misunderstandings taking place, sat in conferences and meetings without offering the insight and information that could have shed light on the discussions. 
So, it's one more year under a calendar which pleases very few, if any, members of the community. What is even more disturbing is that, for one more year, we will be living with a calendar devised without input from the community.

Placement Problems 
As one student commented, the Placement Bureau must come up with a "better plan." A plan which is more fair and more just. A plan which provides equal opportunity to sign up for all seniors registered. 
One possible solution to the problem is to keep on record the exact number of interviews per person and set a minimum limit, relative to the number of interviews designated for each major, so that each person can be guaranteed at least several interviews. 
This process takes more time and demands more care with records, but it guarantees equal time and opportunity to sign up for each senior registered. 
Another viable solution would be a lottery for those interviews where waiting lists are formed. 
With a lottery system, Monday does not have to be the scene of a mad rush to sign up. Technically sign-up days are Monday through Wednesday, and a lottery can assure orderliness and ease by leaving three days open to sign up for any interview desired. 
The limit of three interviews a week can be maintained with a lottery system. When a senior has been selected for three interviews by lottery, he ought not to be eligible for anymore interviews that week. 
No one system will be acceptable to all students. The lottery like other plans has its flaws, but it appears to be the only fair system available to the Placement Bureau at this crucial time.

Co-Ed Dorms:
The 

Hidden Agenda 
fr. bill taaheY 

Sometimes you just have to say, "Hey, wait a minute." You hear a thing said over and over again, and before you know it, it qualifies as a slice of our "conventional wisdom" about which nobody raises a question. Such is the case with the issue of coeducational housing. 
Not so long ago·. tne Scholastic quoted one of our priests as saying that ·'the administration had studied the coeducational dorm situatioll of other schools and concluded that there is no place for them ;It Notre Da:.1tc>." About which someone should politely ask: "What the hell is that supposed to mean?" 
\\!hat's the basis for such a remark? What research, what serious exploration led to such a conclusion? One is forced to question a pronouncement like that, as it becomes clearer all the tinw that eo-ed housing is getting to be a standard optional 
· arrangement at more and more universities. Recently, for l'Xample. at a national gathering of campus chaplains, I was asked b~· those who \\''!re speaking of the positive benefits they saw on their campuses in eo-ed dorms, why Notre Dame seemed to be rlragging her feet so long on this issue. Since eo-ed housing is gaining wide acceptance, not only at non­<'atholic universities. but at numerous Catholic schools, as well, I thought it might prove enlightening to investigate two colleges staffed by the Holy Cross Fathers . I was amazed at how far ahead of us thev are. King's 'college <Wilkes-Barre, Pa. l has a co-ed dorm. with the lowtr three floors occupied by men and the upper three floors by womPn. Stonehill College <Northeaston. Mass. l has seven co-ed townshouses. and one dormitory housing 120 men and women in the so~alled "salt and pepper" arrangement. I interviewed one of the priests who has been living in a Stonehill < 'ollege townhouse. Here are his comments. "I live in a townhouse that accommodates 12 men and 12 women. The living experience is much better than any I've experienced for college students. There seems to be a great maturing process going on; they seem to gain a rPspect for one another that is not equally possible in a segregated dorm. There is a sense of genuine quiet at those times agreed upon: they share good times together: there is no real hassle at all. From tverything I've seen.living right with these students, it has bt>en ;1 significant positive influence ... The Director of Campus Ministry at Stonehill. a strong supporter of co-ed housing. as he has observed it at his school. referred me to lhP writings of .JamPS J. Gill. a Jesuit psychiatrist. for an un­dtrstanding of some of the principles they had found verified at Stonehill. Fr. (;ill criticizes those educators who arbitrarily rule out co-ed housing and thus block interpersonal experiences urgently needed by yo;mg pt>ople (or their full development. "I am not" Gil i-nsists, ·:lalkmg about tr·otic experiences. Too many adults. including t'Otmtltss pannts. reflect the bias of past gPneratiOnsof puritanical dt>rgym(n in their suspicion that wherever and whenever a young man and a young woman are along together sex will raise its lovdy-ugly head withpPrilousconsequences for one or both of them. "Obviously." Fr. (;ill continues, "this is not to say that sex is not onl' of the ('oncerns of most college-age boys and girls today. But l'layboy IIPfner notwithstanding, it is not the one and only preoc­('Upation Pven among the male members of the typical university's studtnt body. l\1ale students in the U.S. today spend too little time sharing life closely with a diversity of girls about the same age. ThP result is a failure to discover what women actua[y are. No ~·mmg man knows much about women, even if he is "going steady" with one. as long as he is deprived of prolonged and rather in­timate. informal contact with many. The chance to share dor­mitory living cannot help but reveal to male students that a woman is som!'thing much more than an erotic machine. Until young men have the experience of sharing the daily lives with a variety of young women. Pla~·boy will continue to lead immature males to helieve that if you know one type of woman you've mastered them all. Perhaps. then. one of the greatest benefits of informally shared dormitory life would be the development of a healthy realism regarding the opposite sex, with more successful marriages and increased life-long happiness as the outcome." I also interviewed the priest-rector of the co-ed dorm at Stonehill. "I've found that young men and women iiving together rise above the adolescent behavior that seems so much a part of the one-sex dorm: they cut through the myths and superficiality rather quickly" 
What about Notre Dame? What are the real reasons we are so far behind other schools. even those staffed by the Holy Cross com­mun;~y? Are we to continue postpoining the open and honest t·onsideration of the myths, misconceptions and fears of this question? Can we speak of value-i>riented education when we don't Pven initiate genuine community-wide discussion of the topic? 
For Pxample, the staff of Grace hall offered a proposal last DPcember for a a one-year experiment in co-ed housing for their dorm. It came as the result of a lot of serious reflection and careful analysis. and was an eminently reasonable plan. What happened to it? How come it never surfaced for community consideration? ('orne to think of it. does anyone even care?

Hired in 1973 



Women officers complement security force 

by Jl.'anne Murphy Copy Editor 
The Twentieth Century has been an age of in­dependence and liberation lor many women. They have invaded traditionally male'i>riented spheres in business. professions, education, and most recently, arease in police work, security and public protection. 
Micky Hess and Doris Stombaugh are the first two women who have broken through the doors of the Notre Dame Security Force, formally an all-male organization. As officers they have worked on the Force since the spring of 1973. 
The hiring of these two women as securityofficers had no correlation to the advent of coedUcation at Notre Dame. commented Dean of Students John l\lacheca. "Yet they do fulfill specific needs by virtue of their being women." he continued. They are able to respond to the particular needs of the women students. 
Director of Security Arthur Pears agreed with l\lacheca that coeducation ha~ not been the sole reason for hiring the women. 
"When you've got girls that we have on campus, we reel we should have a girlso that they can talk girl-to­girl." he said. The women security officers do the same duties as the men because they are required by law (Equal Opportunity Employment laws). Pears stated that the women are used especially to handle "assault problems." 
"We try to have women officers interview them <the assault victims). A girl can talk to a girl more Pasily than a man and often with a result of getting more information." 
"Incidents come up weekly where we have women patrolmen take over an investigation." 
\\'onll'n Meet Requirements 
According to Macheca the requirements for becoming a security officer are strict for both men and women applicants. "We hire the best people we can. It is anasset for the person to have a college degree and l'ollege txperience," he said. 
"As in the case of the two women officers, wefelt that 
they had very good qualities in academics and an in­
terest and willingness to do this kind of work," he 
('Ontinued. 

"We have tried toget girls with a college education in social work. sociology or ciminology," Pears com­mt-nted. Women who work the desks have at least high school t>ducation and the evening hall monitors are married women with high school educations. 
"Wt> reel that the women have a little different set­upthan the men do. It just happened that when we had an opening we've had girls with college educations apply." 
Hess graduated from Indiana University in August 1973 with a BA degree in Sociology anda minor in Law Enforcemt>nt and has studied theory and policeprocedure. 


Kovatch, Pears direct security departments 
by Patty Coonl.'y Contributing Editor 

The St. Mary's Security force, comprised of fifteen people,provides twenty-four hour protection for the students. "Our job is to protect the students <and Faculty) from strangers and from assaults. Students should be able to feel safe walking around here and not have to worry about getting attacked," stated AnthonyKovatch, director of St. Mary'ssecurity. 
Starting at 4:00 p.m., two security men go on "lock up" patrol, securing various entrances to the campus buildings. After "lock up" is completed the two men keep surveillance from the patrol cars. During the weekends there is a third man on patrol at night; he patrols on foot or as an addition in one of the cars. A student dispatcher, located at security headquarters keeps in 


She termed her role as a security officer as "a utilityperson." "I do a little bit of everything. I drive the cars. man the gates. substitute as dispatcher, and answer calls, mostly those concerning the girls on campus.'' she commented. 
"I alsogive my share of tickets and walk the beat," she continued. 
Doris Stombaugh is the first woman dispatcher on the Security Force. Her job is restricted to the office where she mans the radio,telephone and com­munications to the groundmen all around the r.amous. 
All complaints and emergencycalls around campus are first received by Stombaugh and then relayed to various officers on the beat. "We are working verywt>llwhen we receive on the average one emergency a wtek." she explained. "Only cases involving broken hones or serious hospital trips are considered real tmt-rgencies." 
The requirements for 
becoming a security officer are strict for both men and women applicants 
"Probably the most exciting emergency call we received was last year when a man fell into the lake," she stated. "Other security and police departments l'ame in from town to help on this case." 

At St. Mary's 

contact with the two cars at all times. 
Security inside the dorms at night is the responsibility of the night hall director. "If a situation arises where we are needed, the hall director must accompany us into the living quarters," noted Kovatch. 
"Our main problem at night is keeping all the doors and basement windows secured, so that strangers don't get in," explained Mrs. Pauline Grummell, night director of LeMans Hall. "There was an incident several months ago when a man gained access to the building, went upstairs, and passed out in one of the rooms," reported Grummell. "Ever since this incident the basement win­dows have been sealed shut," she continued. "And we constantly remind the girls to lock their doors." she said. 
"LeMans Hall poses a special problem the other residence halls don't. since people pass through there all day long," observed Kovatch. "The administrative offices and college bookstore are located on the lower levels of LeMans, so we do come in there to check several times during the night," Kovatch asserted. 
"I would say however. that our biggest problem here is traffic, with all the coexchange students and different people who do business here," commented Kovatch. "It's very hard to keep track of people coming onto the campus," he added. 
The construction of a guar­dhouse at the entrance of the main road has been suggested. "We are not worried about the Notre Dame students, because they usually have a reason for coming here and are easily recognized, by their decals and parking stickers," said Kovatch. "What we're concerned about is people who have no business being here and who may cause harm to one of our people," he continued. 
"At present there is no gate at the entrance to St. Mary's, because we don't have off-campus parking facilities, as they do over at Notre Dame," explained Kovatch. "The main parking facility is adjacent to LeMans Hall and it would be im­practical to check people using it now," he continued. 
In the event of a guardhouse being installed each road into St. Mary's would be converted for one­way traffic with Douglas Road the exit. "In the future we would like the parking facilities in close proximity to the new guardhouse," commented Kovatch. 
Three sites have been suggested for the new parking facility: the field just south of Madeleva, the area north of McCandless, or the area behind the Camous School. 
The security department in­stituted a service last year to pick up St. Mary's students stranded over at Notre Dame, after the shuttle bus stopped. "We don't want them walking down the road alone at night," stated Kovatch. 
"Since we initiated the service of picking our girls up who have missed the last shuttle bus at night, we have averaged two calls a night," noted Kovatch. The ser­vice was initated in the Spring Semester of 1974. "The girls are real good about it and don't abuse the service, and I feel that it is a good preventive measure," he added. 
Mickey Hess (standing) 
and Doris Stombaugh 
are the first women to 
be hired by the Notre 
Dame security 
department. The 
women security officers 
do the same duties as 
the men. 

"They are patent assets to the Force," Macheca commented. "They have provento begood workers." Not only do they serve their predicated functions, but they are also helpful in the security problems which have arisen as an outgrowth of women living and studying on the campus, he explained. 
Last year Hess presented a program entitled ''Ladies Take Warning." The lecture, which was given in each of the women's dorms include a film on safety precautions and tips on what todo in case of attack or danger. She hopes to present another project of this sort in the spring, the purpose is to make the women at Notre Dame aware of potential hazards on campus. 
Hess explained her experiences as the first woman police officer on the Notre Dame campus as "different, quite different and abnormal -a female officer on a predominately male campus!" 
"Our basic problem is the young juveniles who hang around campus," she stated. "They are usually harder to handle than most of the ND students, in­cluding the male students." 
As far as Macheca knows, the two women officers have experienced no conflicts with other men officers or with students based on the fact that they are women. 
"I usually walk the beat and cover the calls alone, but when a serious problem arises, the whole Force is alerted." Hess stated. 
Other than her regular daily routines of reading the reports and covering calls, Hess works at theACC for special events, .concerts, etcetera. 
Macheca believes that through outside activities and achievements, these women ·bring_ to ND other resources and assets than just fulfilling their specific job as security officers. For example, Hess is a mt>mber of the volunteer SOS program and a member of the International Association for Women Police. 

At Notre Dame 
b~· 1\l;u·~· .Janca St. 1\laJ·~ 's Editor 

Since Arthur Pears became Director of Security at Notre Dame slightly more than ten years ago, Notre Dame has watched its Security force grow in numbers, expand its services and move to larger quarters. 
Security currently employs approximately 50 people as grounds patrolmen, guards, hall monitors, secretaries, clerks, dispatchers and those functioning as full-fledged police officers, said Pears. 
The Director sees his primary duty as head of Security as one of "supervising the Security Department, which is charged with the responsibility of protection of life and property on campus, for students, racultyand staff." 
Under his direction, the gate system was organized. "The principle of the gate system is to control the numbers of vehicles that are on campus, and not to keep people out. The roads are not much more than wide sidewalks. For this reason and because of the layout of the campus, Notre Dame is a walking campus," he stated. 
The director noted that there were no major differences in Security or their procedures since the advent of coeducation three years ago. 
"The only change made is that instead of having male hall monitors in each of the dorms, we have female hall monitors in Pach of the women's halls," Pears said. 
Prior to serving in his present position, Pears worked for the Niles, Michigan Police Depart­ment for 30 years, serving for 15 of those years as Chief of Police. Before that. he was a member of the Military Intelligence Division of the armed forces and he is also a graduate of the FBI National Academy. 
The present Security Director, in addition to his local police service. has been president of a number of crime-fighting related organizations. Among these are: the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police, the FBI National Academy. Michigan Chapter, the Southwestern Michigan Law Enforcement Association, and the Tri-County Chiefs of Police Association.

A 24 hour security force lor a 24 hour day 
Day and night patrolling 
by AI Rutherford Managing Editor 
Notre Dc.me didn't always have a security force. But then again, Notre Dame didn't always have over 7600 cars to register and patrol; didn't always have 8800 students to protect; and didn't always have over 1000 acres to patrol, night and day. In fact, back in 1868. the only guard was at the only gate existing at that time. It was here that one of the brothers would stay in what was called the Porter's house and greet the incoming wagons. 
Back in 1!!66, the security department was located in ;·oom 115 in the Administration Building. At that time, the office was open only I'rom 7a.m .. to 10 p.m. There was no foot patrolling of the campus, no radio communication, no motor patrol. and no patrolling of theparking lots for the faculty and staff members. There was, however. someone to greet you at the gate. 
Things have changed greatly since those times, both 1868 and 1966. The office, now located next to the fire house, is open 24 hours a day. And the uniformed officers are on constant patrol 24 hours a day. Motor patrolls now made possible through tt.!_e use of three ears. And communication with both the foot and motor patrols is maintained constantly through the use of the latest radio equip­ment. 
The planned operating budget for the department during the 1974­
i:i school year is $362,635.00, a figure which is made up of 85 per cent for wages. Under the direction .of Arthur Pears, the department has increased its role as part of the Notre Dame community.

allowed to have a car. All cars must be registered at the beginning of the year at which time a $25.00 registration fee is required. The fee is used to help meet the cost of maintaining the parking lots. 
Pa·king lot patrols For the last four years, it has become in­neasingly common to see parking lot patrols. The patrols are increased on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights since these are the times when most of the damages occur. Many of the patrolmen used on the weekends are graduate and undergraduate students. Much has changed in the use of hall monitors. Tln years ago, hall monitors assisted the rectors in bed checks. Halls were locked up starting at 10 p.m. and the time that one had to be in depended on his status as a student <freshmen, sophmore, etc.). Now the monitor's job encompasses just fhecking for fires and keeping an eye on the vending machines to thwart would-be burglars. The monitors are both male and female, depending on the hall. and they are often grad students. 
lhuulle emergencies The security department used to have all t-mergencies handled by the county police. Now they are all taken care ot by the security force including the transporting of the ill to the in­firmary. and then to a hospital if necessary. "We still have a close co-operation with the local

medea in all her fierce complexity 
And tht>rt' he (Jason> left ht>r, childing and forsakt>n:: For those deceits he's sentenced to tht>St' woes. And for Medt'a too revengt' is takt'n. 
Canto XVIII of L'Inferno Dante's Divine Commedy 
When the ND-SMC Theatre opens their production of Medea this Thursday night, the cast and crew will be facing two challenging problems, the handling of which may well determine the show's success or failure: the use of an adaptation written to be a "one woman show", and the utilization of an intimate arena theatre. 
Robinson Jeffers' adaptation of Euripides' tragedy preserves the essence of the original drama. while translating its language into modern free verse. The striking poetry of Jeffer's work was first heard in a 1947 New York production in which Judith Anderson played the title role. While this production was a tour de force of Ms. Anderson's acting skills, to the point of her manipulating and overshadowing the other characters, the ND-SMC production w;ll have a different focus. According to Prof. Syburg, Associate Professor of Speech and Drama and director of the play, em­phasis will be placed on the unique, in­teresting situation of each character, thus taking them out of Medea's obscurring shadow. Medea herself will not be played as a monster--an interpretation which Prof. Syburg sees as leading towards melodrama, rather than tragedy--but rather as a human being. in all her fierce complexity. This humanness in Medea should in tuin em­phasize her relationships, and thus, the eharacters with whom she inter-relates. 
While Euripides' characters were originally portrayed by formally masked

After a powerful performance as Mr. Gant in Look Homeward, Angel, Kirk Packo will serve as Stage Manager, assisted by Sandy Swartz. Set and Costume Design will be done by Faith Adams, who created the costumes for both Look Homeward and Ft>llows. Ms. Adams' costuming will try to capture the tension between the Greek ideals and those of the barbarian heritage which are set forth in the drama. Because of the use of the arena, props will be minimal. and emphasis will be on the stage floor. one of the principle visual elements in this sort of production. 
Prof. Syburg sees the challenging of the audience as the essence of academic theatre. With the opening of Medea, the ND­SMC community will surely be challenged to careful listening and observation. but Prof. Syburg and his cast will be meeting 

and costumed actors who performed to immense audiences from a traditional proscenium. or thrust stage, Jeffers' adaptation will be rendered from an in­timate arena-type theatre. Due to the repairs needed in Washington Hall. Prof. Syburg was forced to move his production to O'Laughlin Auditorium at St. Mary's. Because the scale of the production which had been envisioned would have been dwarfed by the size of the new cite, Prof. 
Syburg decided on the "theatre in the 
round." or arena presentation. 

Although this arena has inherent ad­\·antages--a greater sense of intimacy and more direct audience-actor communication­-it also demands more of the actors, whose (very gesture and movement becomes dsible to their audience. The cast, therefore. must use much greater con­centration than usual. to master more subtle gestures and glances, and movement which plays to as large a portion of the surrounding audience as possible at each mommt. Intonation must also be greatly refined when an audience is only a few feet away. In working on this aspect, the cast has used intensive wailing exercises to help dPvelop the hollow, sorrowful moaning lwhind the lines of the play. 
Sinee Euripides' tragedy, like all Greek 
drama. was essentially yelled through 
stvlized masks. and acted with massive 
gestures meant ttl reach a large, distant 
audience. it will be most interesting to see 
how the play lends itself to translation into 
an intimate, subtle form. 

Playing Medea, whose passionate love 
turns in the play into monstrous energies of 
revenge, will be Katherine Burke, who gave

the year at innsbruck 
paris and vienna--old world in modern times 

tim o'reiley 
Those who expected a cultural shock to hit them never felt the slap 1h the face. Paris and Vienna possess traffic congestion, neon signs. and all the other ecoutriments of any modern American city. But this is a deception, because these two cities could never exist in this country. They are the products of histories that span over 1,000 years of a royal heritage, of a culture for which America became an escape valve. All these factors have built metropoli with uniquely Old World characteristics that are obvious to anyone who cares to seek and understand. 
One look at a map will reveal the large time over which these cities developed. The street systems of both Paris and Vienna look like they were designed by a tortured genius. A single street may bend five or six times in different directions before simply ending. One block roads and odd angle intersections are commonplace. Grid patterns are non-existant; streets came into being according to the irregular demands of population growth, royal decree, and post war construction. The roads themselves were constructed for horses and carriages, for which the still narrow and brick surface~ were laid. The whole thing provides a 
great playground for European drivers, a curse for most newcomers, and an indicator of a protracted history. 
On either side of a street stands a virtual wall ofapartmentbuildings and townhouses. All five or six stories tall, these dwellings were built so close together that only dif­ferent colored walls can distinguish them. Businesses and shops often occupy the ground floor. The facades are adorned with balconies and some kind of decoration, most notably the Baroque style of Vienna. To the middle. each structure has a courtyard, providing a neighborhood atmosphere for the residents. 
These apartments comprise some of the most exclusive residences in the city. Private homes with a front and back yard, are virtually unheard of, prohibited by the lack and expense of land in centuries past. The slum areas have developeed in the suburbs. But the downtowns are well preserved and maintained, making them the most attractive areas to live. 
The center cities also hold the great beauty that these capitals are famous for. Royalty, at its height. designea great aristocratic playgrounds in competition with each other, in a sort :;~f international status symbol game. With the enlighten­ment or end of the monarchies, all the private properties were thrown open to the public. allowing everyone to benefit from these magnificent works of art. Vienna as the Hofburg, the former Imperial complex, with its lush gardens now converted to museums and parks. The Place de Con­eorde in front of the Louvre furnishes a great cultural diversion for Parisians. Both Vienna and Paris have superb main thoroughfares, the Ringstrasse and the Champs Elysees respectively, were built by rulers who wanted to create something both enjoyable and practicle. 
Not to be outdone. the Church erected a few palaces to its own credit. In Vienna the Baroque style dominates church designs, most notably in the Karlskirche. Baroque leaves almost no wall space; everything must be overlaid with gold. marble, statues or paintings, with whatever is left over painted white. Man's greatest monument to God, Cathedral Notre Dame along the banks of the Seine. overawes with size alone. After that. the complexity of the iron grill surrounding the altar, the thick mahogany base for the grill, the famous stained glass windows or the hundreds of figures carved into the walls and pulpits are enough to distract the mind from any Mass. These chyrches constitute the rule rather than the exception, since even small parishes have churches that qualify, to a lesser degree, as art museums. Such wealth on so broad a scale reflects centuries of strong influence in European affairs. 
To many residents all these buildings house the traditions that make these cities unique. Many renowned artists, writers, public servants and clergy worked in and thrived on the atmospheres of Paris and Vienna~-Highways are built around the old portions that contain so much of this proud heritage. A major controversy rages in Paris over the erection of high-rises, sup­posedly desecrating the city's skyline. 
That does not mean that progress is shunned. It is incorporatied in a European way, such as placing gas pumps on a sidewalk instead of using a whole block for a gas station. These are not cities that look back to regale in what once was but shall never be again. Rather they seek a per­spective so that they may continue to present to the world gifts that are singularly Parisian and Viennese.

Several misrepresentations cited 
Nickoloff aiJlrnends co:mrnents 
Former Regina Hall President Nancy Nickoloff yesterday amended several comments at­tributed to her in Monday's Observer. and stated that she was misquoted and that other quotes were taken out of contest. 
"I have no desire to remain in office. and have no desire to hurt people or downgrade any faction of hall or student government. I wish to apologize for the reporter's misinterpretation of what I said,"

view. the housing problem is simplified when we no longer have to worry about converting an entire dormitory," she noted. 
"But." Jones continued, "there have been losses also. There have­been problems with men and women taking each other for granted. Some of the residents have grown weary of the lack of privacy." 
Privacy. sharing needed 
Jones emphasized that there are many different patterns of coed 
housing.  ranging  from  mixed  
roommates  to  separate  floors  
withpn the same building.  "I feel  

the best style of coed housing is one which combines common facilities and private facilities," she said, and noted that the Grace plan does make that distinction. 
"I don't know if we're ready for coed housing, or when we will be ready. i 'm not prepared to give a final answer on that," she con­tinued. 
Referring to the Badin-Lewis decision announced Feb. 3, Jones indicated, "With the reversion of Badin Hall to an undergraduate women's residence, we are set as far as housing is concerned for '75 and '76, unless there is a major shift in the number of males living off-campus." 
Jones promised, however, that the issue of coeducational living would be judged on its own merits first, despite fears that alumni pressure would be an overriding factor in any decision made. 
"The first consideration is, 'Is this a good and wholesome thing for us now?' If yes, then we must communicate with the alumni in a way that will allow them to un­derstand the reasons for our decisions." she observed. 
"We must first decide if this is a viable, worthwhile, beneficial thing." Jones concluded. "Then we will look at the other interests involved." 
Later in the year the Committee on Undergraduate Life will make recommendations to the Student Affairs Committee that will then be presented to the entire Board of Trustees. When contacted, the committee members had not yet received copies of the Grace proposal. The plan will be discussed Saturday at a meeting of the subcommittee on residen­tiality, along with other matters pertinent to student residence both 
on and off-campus.

"My biggest problem was not that no one cared enogb to par­ticipate, as the article stated, but that there was a lack of com­munication which prohibited others from participating," sbe said. 
Also. she stated that sbe would not have completed her te-rm of office even if she had a full cabinet with which to work. "I just didn't want the responsibility any more,"she said. 
When she was elected president, there was only one other hall of­ficer, the Regina -South Vice­President, Faye Maloof, who Nickoloff said. "worked to capacity, but without a vice­president in Regina North, hall government could not function to its fullest". 
She noted that the beginning of her term was the most diffficult, "because I didn't have ve-ry many

Concerning these reforms, Patterson argued that Congress has changed as a result of political change. He argued, "In a democratic society the citizens have to make the change". Pat­terson added, "Mindless refor­mism does not seem to me a good substitute for a politically active and aware public." 
With regard to separation of powers. Patterson said that to the men who wrote the Constitution the legislative branch was intended to be the central institution. The fact that the first Article of the Con­stitution was about the Legislature supports this contention. 
The balance of power has waxed and waned over the years, he

After Prof. Patterson lectured, his speech was discussed by Dr. Paul Bartholomew and John Roos, both Government professors. 

Speaking first, Bartholomew briefly discussed more deeply the rdations between Congress and the Presidency and between Congress and the Judiciary. Concerning Congress and the Presidency, he mentioned the eonflicts they encounter in the area of foreign relations. On the Congress and the Judiciary, he talked about the recent con­troversy over the presentation of Presidential papers.

The Shah also declared that Iran will refuse to take part in any oil embargo. 
It was learned that Kissinger brought up the possibility of Iran supplying Israel with oil commercially if that country agrees to return the captured Abu Rodeis oil fields to Egypt as part of a new interim peace settlement. 
Israel captured the fields in the 1967 Middle East war and currently obtains about 40 per cent of its oil supplies from them.
