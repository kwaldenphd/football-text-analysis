For students 
Defense fund increase cuts aid 
By Tim Vercellotti StaffReporter 
Many people applauded the increase in funds for the nation's defense in President Carter's recent budget proposal. What many of this approving public may not have known was that in order to make up for this rise in defense spending, no money at all was allocated to other programs. One of the areas whtch suffered this loss was student aid, specifically the National Direct Student Loan (NDSL). 
NDSL is a program operated in conjunction with schools across the country. Through this plan students can borrow money at three percent interest to help finance their education. In the 1979-80 fiscal year this program received 220 million dollars. Notre Dame students are currently receiving 1.4 million dollars from this program. 
Joseph Russo, Director of Financtal Aid at Notre Dame, expressed concern, but not apprehension about Carter's 1980-81 budget. One of his reasons is that this is not the first time that funds were not provided for the program. 
''I have been working in the Financial Aid office under three Presidential administrations, and something like this is usualJy included in the budget proposal." Russo said. 
Russo went on to point out that Carter's budget proposal is simply that, a proposal. "The budget is subject to Congres­sional approval; and by the time it gets throush the House and the Senate, It is possible that some legislator wilJ have gotten funds for the NDSL included in the budget.'' 
According to Russo, the fate of financial aid programs are decided through a lot of political maneuvering on Capitol Hill.

illustrate Russo's point. According to the ·1978 federal budget, $15 million were allocated to the NDSL, how­ever, by the end of the fiscal year $310 milJion had been used tn the program. In another case in the 1976 fiscal year, no money whatsoever was appro­priated for student assistance, yet through various congres­sional bilJs, $320 million were utilize-d for financial aid. 
When asked why such a move would be made by the federal government in decreasing aid, Russo offered sev~al reasons. 
''Besides the move towards reduction offederal spending, a possible explanation might be the de-,ire on the. part of the federal government to 
consolidate its financial aid programs. There are many different scholarships and other types of funds, and this can make for a confusing situation. If some of those programs were cancelled, then it will be easier for the government to coordinate s.·udent assistance." Russo said. 
Russo conceded that delinquency in repayment of the loans is a problem. He does not feel, however, that this could be a reason for the federal cutback. 
In the event that no money is appropriated to the NDSL, Russo claimed that the situation would not be as bad as it first appears. 
''The NDSL program IS partially self-sufficient. Roughly one third of the money used in the program is co1lec­tion money, money coming from former students who are repaying their loans. Even if no funds vyere appropriated for the upcoming fiscal year, there would still be somethin~ in the 

program." Russo explamed. 
Russo went on to say that this 

money would be used to the 
fullest extent possible for those 
students currently receiving 
loans. Also, if need be, only 
these particular students will be 
digible for the NDSL the 
following year. 
Russo pointed out that an alternative to the NDSL is the Guaranteed Student Loan program (GSL). This type of the financial aid takes the form of a bank loan taken out by the student (with a maximum amount of $2500) repayable at seven per cent interest. "The GSLJrogram is a feasible form ofai for many students. In the event of an actual federal cutback, I would refer students to this program. Furthermore, ~iven the ocurence of a cutback tt would not be unreasonable to expect that the limit on the amount to be borrowed would be raised.'' Russo said. 
Russo repeatedly stated that while this cutback in student aid should be watched carefully, it is not a cause for great concern. He cited politics to support his feelings. 
''What goes on with regard to financial aid is dictated by politics. Politics being the art of compromise, I do not feel that this budget will be passed without some negotiation between Congress and the President.'' Russo explained. 
The Financial Director reminds students that before any aid, either NDSL or GSL, can be expected for next semester, students must file their Financial Aid Forms. These forms can be picked up in room 111 of the Administration building, and the deadline for filing them is April 15.

foe. India and Pakistan have 
fought three wars in the last 33 
years. 

Brzezinski is scheduled to 
leave today for Saudi Arabia. 
Zia's foreign affairs advisor, 
Agha Shah1, read a joint state­
ment from the rwo delegations, 
saying the weekend meetings 
had resulced in "a full ex­
change of views ... '' 

Earlier yesterday, Brzezinski 
visited a refugee camp inside 
Pakistan and told hundreds of 
cheering Afghans: "You will 
prevail. .. because your cause is 
right. God is on your side." 
·'History bears testimony that no one has ever crushed the brave Afghan people. Remem­ber, you are not alone,'' he told the refugees, who responded with slogans of welcome and chants of ''Allah-o-akbar'' ­God is great. 
Brzezinski spoke at Sadda, 80 miles southwest of Peshawar. Sadda is a strategic post on the 800-mile Afghan-Pakistan bor­der. About 7,000 refugees live in the camp, some of the estimated 500,000 Afghans who have fled their homeland dur­ing three years of successive Marxist regimes. 
Brzezinski, Undersecretary of State Warren Christopher and Defense Department officials are on an official visit to assess Pakistan's security needs in the face of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. 
Brzet'inski, pointing to the snow clad mountains that form the bordor, told the refugees: ''The land over there is yours and you will go back there one day. 
"You will ultimately prevail, and you will have your homes and mosques because your cause is right. God is on your side," he added. 
''The Afghans should know that the entire world is outra8­ed over the developments 111 Afghanistan. Not only the Muslim world but also the Christian world is outraged. We all sympathize with you". 
Earlier, several Afghan elders told Brzezinski that their homes, mosques and villages

had been destroyed by "the alien and atheist regime in Afghanistan,'' forcmg them to flee. "They are bent upon destroying our religion.'' 
The elders said the Afghans do not want wheat, tents, medicines and other relief goods. but instead want arms and weapons to fight the Soviet tanks and planes. 
''The communists resort to indiscriminate bombing of our homes and villages," the elders said . 
The Soviets poured up to 100,000 troops into Afghanistan last Christmas. The troops backed the coup that toppled Hafizullah Amin and installed Babrak Karma! as president, then fanned out across the rugged countryside and began helping the Afghan forces bat­tling the anti-Kabul rebels. 

Brzezinski has met rwice with Pakistani President Moham­med Zia ui-Haq and is schedul­ed for a third session before leaving for Saudi Arabia on Today. 
The United States has offered $400 million in military and economic aid to Pakistan, but Zia labeled the two-year pack­age '·peanuts.'' Brzezinski now reportedly is seeking to assure Zia that the United States also wants a long-term assistance pact with his coun­try.

Shah's 'crimes' 
United Nations proposes study 
(AP) -Iran has agreed to set up an international commission that will consider alleged crimes of the deposed shah and ''will be effective in solving the hostage crisis,'' a Foreign Ministry spokesman said yes­terday. 
Establishment of the commis­sion, proposed by U.N. Secre­tary-General Kurt Waldheim, has been approved by Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as well as the ruling Revolutionary Council, said the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Nassirosadat Salami. 
A spokesman for the militants1reached by telephone at the embassy, said he was aware of the council's decision, announc­Saturday night, but declined immediate comment. A state­ment might be issued later, the spokesman for the militants said. 
Yesterday was the 92nd day of captivity for approxima~ely 50 Americans held by Islamic-mili­tants at the U.S. Embassy since it was seized on Nov. 4. Three other U.S. diplomats have been held since then under virtual house a_rrest at the Foreign Ministry.· · 
The militants have said re­peatedly they will not release the hostages until deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, living in Panama, is returned ~y the United States to stand mal on char,ges of corruption and mass murder. ­
The Foreign Ministry spokes­man did not say when the commist'iion would come to Tehran nor when hearings would begin. Its members would be selected by Waldhein and would include Iranian and foreign representatives, Salami said. 
He said it would be Wald­
heim 's decision whether to 
include U.S. representatives 
among the group. He refused 
to confirm or deny reports that 
Waldheim soon would visit 
Iran.

spokesman: "The international 
commission will be effective in

State Sen. Ben Altamirano said he saw one Black inmate who had been decapitated and Corrections Division Director Felix Rodriguez said some of the dead inmates were "un­recognizeable.'' 
Deputy Warden Robert Mon­toya dismissed as "rumor" a report that some bodies had been stacked up in the prison gym and burned. He said many of the inmates were ''hysterical when. they came out.'' 
King said he agreed to try force because, "We just felt we reached that point. We have the hostages released or we know where they are," the governor said. 
The governor said fire trucks also were sent to the smoulder­ing compound where fires torched by inmates caused an estimated $10 million in dam­age.

News of the corrimission came late Saturday following a lengthy meeting oflran's ruling Revolutionary council. After the session, council spokesman 
Hassan Habibi said ''the inter­national investigation commis­sion will consider the shah's crimes, his violation of human rights and the return of his wealth to Iran." 
The militants announced Saturday they had invited a special American delegation to Tehran this week Ito hear Iran's grievances against the shah and the U.S. government. The State Department in Washing­ton said it knew nothing of such 

Farm Labor Organization calls for campus boycott

According to Fr. Van Wolvlear rules to inttiate the referendum were discussed. Representa­tives from Campbell and Libby and the FLOC are required to present their views. In the event that Campbell and Libby fail to participate in the debate the FLOC would have to prove that an ''honest attempt was made'' to enlist their participa­tion before the referendum would appear on the ballot.

Ireland solicits support_of students for coalition against draft registration 
by Bndget Berry 
Seven students have joined the ND-SMC coalition against registration for the draft since Feb. 1 when Pat Ireland solicited support through the Personals. Accroding to Ireland, response has ranged from support to irresponsible, "t-shirt jargon" harassment. 
As he ts uncertain about organizing the movement, Ireland prefers to begin with a core group of only ten students. 
They will attend the meeting of the Midwestern Coaltwn Against Registration and the Draft (CARD) in Kalamazoo on February 16. 
Although the ND-SMC coali­tion will not be officially affiliated with CARD groups, Ireland said that he hopes to work closely with them. The coalition's goals will be to inform the student body of the implications of the reinstate­ment of the draft. 
According to Ireland, the Notre Dame -Saint Mary's student body is comprised of a cross section of ambitious, upper middle-class Americans. 
Caught up in their own goals and future plans, Ireland explained, many students here assume that they won't be drafted. Many do not realize that there will be no student deferrements this time.

He did not find atypical the SMC woman's comment "Sure I · think women should be drafted. All women except . SMC women that is.'' Nor does he feel that like sentiments are limited to females" or to the ND community. 
Accordin~ to Ireland, the ND mentality IS consistent with Walter Cronkite's inrerpre­tation of the rational attitude: "Yes we're for the draft, but don't draft me! " 
Students recognize a distinc­tion between registration and the draft, Ireland said. He quoted the latf)j General Lewis Hershey: "Registration is the will also correct the misunder­standings about the U.S. all-· volunteer force that he claims the R.O.T.C. has stimulated.

The Quiet Voice of Jloverty 
Karen Smith 
Every one of the 235 students who made an Urban Plunge this January had a different experience; even those in the same group within the same city. Th(' Plunge is a highly personal experience because the individual brings to thi5 llllcnse 1rban situation a unique history. Each person sees the world in a separate way and integrates new data in a different way. The excerpts that follow are quotations from students' .reflection papers. They speak for themselves. · 
'\ variety of questions underlie these particular reflections. What are the irnplicarions of poverty--for those-who are poor? for society? What is my relationship to the poor? What is my attitude to people of different· races. when I am actually confronted by them? How does one deal with social 111justi.:e without dominating or dehumanizing the people involved? H9w is 1he Church responding to human need and to structural injustice? \'JV'hat is tbe ""ur.:e of hope in the face of reality?

·As people who are well-off, we often criticize rhe poor for being lazy and for n"r lifting themselves our of their predicament. In one day I realized that all our r;nionalization for permitting poverty to exist was shattered. We the 'supreme white race' force the poor to remain poor by such means as institurional racism. POVERTY IS OUR PROBLEM AS WELL AS THEIRS." 
''There were about fifteen or twenty people in the church besides our group. They were all black. Because it is against church rules for women to appear. at a service in pants, we sat in the back ofchurch our of respect. To our surpnse though, we were welcomed by the congregation and led to the front pews of the church. I could only wonder if my parish at home would welcome a group of visitors so openly. I sincerely doubt it." 
·'The loving and caring relationship we developed with the Shalom Community House, which was started by Rev. Claude-Marie and Hattie Williams, will stay with me for a long rime. Claude-Marie's ministry is 1ermed ·mission in reverse' which meam: that the minister can and should karn from the people ministered to--including, and perhaps especially, fr~m poor and marginal people. Their aim is to enable the poor to find new digmty and new hope by being enablers and ministers themselves.

··The soup, accompanied by bread and stale doughnuts ,was given out free. The men consl)med the soup till there was no more in the large pot. Another worker ran back and forth filling coffee cups. The men sat devouring their food as if it were their only meal for the day and for many it was likely to be. Ab,>ut a dozen men asked the man in charge, Frank, for bread to take home to the1r families ... One of the guests even asked Frank for the food scraps which had been wiped off the plates and put in a porcelain basin ...

··At the Recorder's Court it became painfully obvious that the violent crimes W(' read and hear about daily, happen often and to real people. For me it had always been rather easy to dismiss these crimes because they did not pcrsonally touch me, but as I heard women tearfully describe being raped, and men talk about how they were beaten with lead pipes, I had to consider whar it all really meant. People, men and women with the same feelings and emorions that I have, are experiencing these terrible things. I also discovered rhat crime is nor the whole problem.

Notre Dame could get no closer than nine points the rest of the way. There were a couple of bright spots for the Irish. One was the play of Maggie Lally.

The only other bright spot came late in the first half, when Shari Matvey broke another record.

With most of the fans at the ACC anticipating an O'vertime, Wisconsin's Ron Vincent stole an errant Irish pass at the blue line and lifted the puck over Laurion on the uncontested breakaway. Durocher scored an insurance goal with three seconds left on another break­away for his first hat trick of the year. 
Saturday's contest ended on a happier note for the Irish, as Meredith broke a 3-3 tie mid­way through the final period, and Notre Dame held on for Smith's 200th career win. 
'' In a way it was nice to get it against Wisconsin,'' Smith said. ''They helped us out in the be~inning of the program by putttng us on their schedule, and that adds something extra to it." 
The win helped climax a big day for Smith, whose daughter gave birth to a 10-pound, three-ounce baby boy at 2 p.m. 
Wisconsin had the early lead in the contest, as Griffin scored with two Notre Dame players in the penalty box. But Dave Poultn got the equalizer with 56 seconds left in the first period, backhanding a shot past Schultz with a pile-up in front of the net. 
Defense man Jim Brown scored the second goal of the season on a slap shot from the blue line, giving Notre Dame the lead two minutes into the second period.

The rest of the contest belong­ed ro Notre Dame goalie Bob McNamara, who saved 20 shots in the final period as the Badgers struggled to get the equalizer. 
''It was a heckuva hockey game," Smith noted. "We sucked it up and played well. Bobby Mac had an outstanding day, and we had excellent balance on all three lines."

Win one for McDivitt'' was the theme as an inspired Irish swimming team destroyed visit­ing St. Bonaventure Saturday, 63-48 to close out the home schedule for the 1979-80 sea­son.

Sophomore Don Cas­ey then lunged into the pool for the butterfly leg covered the_ 110-yards in just over 53 sec­onds to pull the Irish team even with the 100-yard freestyle rematntng. Then sophomore Mike Shepardson continued his tremendous comeback from off­season bursitis, surging past St. Bonaventure's Walter Deck to give the Irish team seven points and first place in 3:42.2, less than a second off the 
_varsity record. "We had to beat up on somebody after what happened last week against Bradley,'' said Casey, Notre Dame's but­terfly record holder. "Bradley was the only team that has beaten us convincingly all year, and we were mad. Besides, when you dedicate a meet to SO_ITieone, you're not suppose to

Not your typical nail-biter. 
"Notre Dame out-manned us at all positions several players deep," added Biedenbach. 
"You can't hide any weak­nesses against Notre Dame. They are very sound.'' 
Irish guard John Paxson could not hide any weaknesses, either --probably because he didn't have any. The freshman quarterback hit seven of nine from the floor and all five from the foul line, for his new collegiate high of 19 points. 
Paxson also pulled down four .rebounds, dished out seven assists, and came up with three steals --all crammed into 20 minutes of action. He also converted three different three­point plays on the evening. 
''I've seen John play for some time now," said Biedenbach of Paxson. "I started to recruit him when I was an assistant at North Carolina State. He's a great player, and is Notre Dame's best talent at guard." 
Phelps was also quite pleased with his freshman blue-chipper, and suggested that the back injury that is still bothering Kelly Tripucka combined with the sprain ankle suffered by j~nior big man Gil Salinas, may g1ve Paxson even more playing time tonight versus Navy and Wednesday against Manhat­tan-both games at the ACC.
