Libya offers 'profuse apologies ' 
WASHINGTON (AP) The Libyan government has offered "profuse apologies" for the attack Sundav on the U.S. embassy in 'rripoli and has increased the guard there, but the response to a U.S. protest was inadequate, State Depart­ment officials said yesterday. 
'·We will be satisfied only when we have satisfactory as­surances for the security both of our embassy and our people in Libya,'' department spokesman David Passage said. 
Fourteen embassy depend­ents left Libya yesterday some flying to Pans and the others to Rome. 
Libya's response came from Ali Turayki, the foreign minis­ter, to William Eagleton, the top U.S. diplomat in Libya. 
But the State Department wants Libya's leader, Col. Noa­mmar Khadafy, to acknowledge the attack as a way of reassur­ing that the Libyan people understand the embassy is not to be a target of violent demon­strations. 
Only one policeman was out­side the embassy when some 2,000 people, carrying pro-Iran­ian banners and spurred on by a sound truck, assembled outside the embassy. 
Some demonstrators clam­bered up the wall to the second floor and others set fire to the building. There were no injur­

Iranians vote Khorneini leader for life 
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -The Iranian people, in a vast show of support for the Moslem elder who has made the holding of American hostages part of a holy crusade, voted overwhel­mingly yesterday to make Aya­tollah Ruhollah Khomeini their political overload for life. 
The Khomeini regime, mean­while, stepped up public read­iness for an eventual U.S. mili­tary attack, expected by many Iranians. It posted more guards at the U.S. Embassy, where 50 Americans entered their 30th day of captivity in the hands of Moslem militants demanding that the United States hand over the deposed Shah of Iran. 
For the first time some of the 
guards were dressed in green 
army fatigues and boots.

Student Governm.ent rejects SU proposal 
by Michael Onu{rak Senior Copy Editor 

In a tension-fdled meeting last night the Student Governmvnt Board ofCommissioners rejected a proposal submitted by Studt.·nt Union Director Tom Hamel which would have reinstituted. ir: modified form, the Student Union's comiJlimentary ticket poli, \. The:' Board voted earlier this semester to abolish the traditional ! policy after having upheld it at two earlier meetings. 
Hamel said he decided to give the complimentary ticket pobc) "one more shot" because he felt that an "implicit contract" had been drawn up between the Union and its workers. 
"Thit; isn't any kind of a legal contract, but it is a moral c·nc· because Student Union has traditionally compensated its work r~ with complimentary concert ticb·ts. To cut off this compensati01 ir: mid-semester is a slap in the face to the workers," Hamel sai· 
Besides Hamel, only Bill Vita, student body vice-president, a·1d Shannon Neville, off-campus commissioner, supported the , U proposal. The proposal was defeated by a 6-3 tally. 
Student Body President Bill Roche, who voted against the 5U, said that he hoped a better compensatory policy could be wor'-c·d out with the Union and student government. 
''I ddinitely feel Student Union workers should be compensated because of the amount of time and effort they put into tneir job,.'' Roche said. 
"I just don· t think complimentary tickets is the best way. Right now I'm not sure the SU could afford to take the financial loss giving away all these tickets would incur," Roche said. 
·'What I would like to see is some type of pay-scale worked out for student governmenr workers as is now in effect at some student-run University organizations. The compensation would only be token, but it would be a lot closer to what student government workers deserve, than what they are getting nov .'' Rot:he added. 
In other business, the Board voted to restrict the number of student government officials who will have authority to sign official contracts on behalf of student government. The Board voted unanimously to restrict contract-signing power to the Student Body President, Judicial Co-ordinator, HPC Chairman, Off-Campus Commissioner, and Student Union Director. 
This policy will not affect hall-run events. The Board of Commissioner's next meeting will be Jan. 24 at 6:30p.m.

Committee discusses rape 

by Rosemary Mills Editor-in-Chief 
A committee on rape aware­ness last night discussed ex­panding the Rape Awareness program presented to the Notre Dame women resident assis­tants two weeks ago. Susan Tamborini, director of Holy Cross Hall (SMC), commented that she was pleased with the program but it only concerned the women. "I think the whole campus needs to be aware of it ­male as well as female," she said. 
Katie Kearney, director of Student Legal Atd and assistant rector of Farley Hall, related that a representative from stu­dent government had approach­ed her. According to Kearney, student government wishes to expand the program with a 20 minute to half-hour presenta-

tion on rape, possibly in each 
section of the ND dormitories. 
Another option discussed in­
cluded using the Hall Presi­
dents Council as a core group to 
bring programs into the halls. 
Sr. John Miriam Jones, asso­
ciate provost, noted that "the 
sensittvity of the person who 
relates the informatton is essen­
tial." 
.James Roemer, dean of stu­
dents, added that he would like 
to consult such people as Pat 
Crosson, director of Psychologi­
calservices and Fr. Greg Green, 
assistant vice-president for Stu­
dent Affairs. After a discussion 
of these and other options, a 
subcommittee was appointed to 
present specific ideas on the 
make-up of a program and who 
should relate the information. 
The group will include Green, 
Crosson, HPC chairperson El­
len Dorney, and Bill Roche, 
student body president. 
Roche asked about the inclu­
sion of a rape awareness pro­
gram in the RA training. Roe­
mer said he would relay the 
question to Green, who is in 
charge of all RA's. Kearney 
then noted that while present 
RA's need to be informed about 
rape, the {>togram will be 
presented after the appoint­
ment of RA's for 1980-81 and 
that both groups can benefit 
from the presentation. 
Jones then asked if a regular 
system could be instituted ·which would alert the six wo­
men rectors when a rape or 
assault occured. Roemer sug­
gested that Rex Rakow, assis­tant director of ND !<ecurity, take this responsioility. Rakow will be working the 4 p.m. to midnight shift. 
· Glenn Terry, director of ND 
security, reported that security 
personnel could voluntarily at­
tend a Sex-Offense-Staff 
(S-0-S) presentation on rape. 
Missy Hennenberer, an ND 
senior who works with S-0-S 
protested, "I think it is impor­
tant that all Security people be 
made sensitive about rape.'' 
Terry agreed, but stated that 
there were problems with sche­
duling and that Security per­
sonnel would attend the presen­
tations on their own time, for 
which they would be paid 
overtime. Roemer then sug­
gested that a record be kept of 
all security employees who 
attend the program and that all 
others be encouraged to attend 
future training sessions.

The Iranian Crisis : 
The Chase Manhattan Bank 
and Notre Datne 
Recent events in Iran · siezure of the U.S. Embassy and the holding of hostages -have shaken this country and the international community. Such actions represent a brutal as­sault on the delicate machinery of international dipolmacy and must be vehemently· con­demnt>d. While media commen­taries have focused on this point and the demand to extra­dite:' the Shah, I would like to explore some of the explosive i-;sues which gave rise to this 
:risi8 and which are not getting the attention they deserve. 
We should not allow our justifiable outrage at chis Irani­
an assault or normal diplomatic procedures to block out the voi,·e of legitimate third world anger. This anger has been Incubating for a long time as ,nany countries have had to endure the habitual manipula­t :on of their politics by the U.S. Our foreign policy has all too often supported unsavory local elites in an effort to ensure an hospitahk climate for exploita­tive transnational corporations. There have also been many instances of western banking mterests willingly accepting tht> loot of dictators. While the prest>nt crisis displays features which are the outcome of Iran's particular hisrory and relig10us tradition, it also reveals prob­lems which art> endemic co U.S. foreign policy throughout the 
1hird world. 
One side-effect of the media's coverage of this parlous affair has been the exposure afforded Iranian spokesmen. They have been given a chance to place Iran's considerable grievances before the world community. It has become clear that they want an international investigation of the Shah's activities and the return of the plunder which the Shah, his family and leaders of the former regime have taken 
The problem is real 
Dear Editor: 
A security problem has un­que~tionahly arisen at the Uni­verstty of Notre Dame du Lac. The problem exists in many forms: burglary, rape, assault and attempted murder. If the truth finally be known, these deprivations of p~rsonal liber­ties are committed primarily out of Iran. Reports in New York Times indtcate that as much as $17 to $20 billion may have been removed from the country. We must acknowledge the anger behind these de­mands and face our complicity in Iranian affairs during the past three clecades. 
In 1953 the C.I.A. put the Shah on his throne, so thwart­ing an Iranian political move­ment which sought to exercise full control over the country's resources. In the years that followed, U.S. foreign policy contin.ued to back the regime to the hilt and western corporate interests flourished. No sooner had the Shah been installed, when David Rockefeller and the Chase Manhattan Bank moved into the country in a massive way. Other corporations did likewise and U.S. support for the Shah's anti-~ommunist dic­tatorship appeared to provide a safe arena in which these business interests could oper­ate. This syndrome has notbeen peculiar to Iran, even if the brutality of the Shah's regime and the vast sums of money drained out of the country made it a notorious case. Iranian anger and Iranian anti-Ameri­canism should be heeded. It is too easy. too self-serving to feel aggrieved and to dismiss Aya­tollah Khomeini as a 'mad mullah': he is not. 
The involvement of the Chase Manhattan in Iran is only slowly being made apparent. It is a disturbing fact of political life in thtU.S.rhat citizens are, by and large, unacquainted with the role such transnational corpora­tions play in the moulding of our foreign policy. There are ocher examples of what this has meant. In addition to moving into Iran after the C.I.A. had installed the Shah, Chase Man­hattan put together a consorti­um of banks to bester the South 

African economy during a peri­od of capital flight from that country following the Sharpville massacre of 1960. At that point the South African government crushed all organized African resistance to apartheid, where­upon the Chase and other leading U.S. corporations flood­ed into the highly profitable apartheid system. We saw a comparable scenario in Chile. The C.I.A. and U.S. corpora­tions played a major role in the destruction of the constitution­ally elected socialist govern­ment headed by Salvador Al­lende. Thf> U.S. then found irself acutely embarrassed by the brutalities of the Chilean junta it helped to creat. In 1977 this dictatorship appears to have ordered the murder of Orlat1d Letelier who had served ar, Foreign Minsiter during the Allende years; Letelier and 
U.S.. citizen Ronnie Moffit died when Letelier's car exploded in Washington D.C. The U.S. cried to extradite the accused murderers, but the junta re­fused to <.:ooperate. "While the Carter Admmistration was call­ing the former head of the Chilean secret police. Gen. Manuel Contreras Sepulveda, a 'terrorist' and was summoning Amb~ssador George W. Lan­dau ~ome for a critical review of relations with the military re­gime\, Chase Manhattan Bank was ~~reparing to move into the new \>ffices of it!; first branch in Chilq". (The New York Times, Thursday, October 4, 1979.) 
This involvement of Chase Manhattan in the political econ omy of repressive regimes raises a moral dilemma very close to home. Fr. Hesburgh sits on the Board of Chase Manhattan. He may not do so in his formal capacity as Presi­dent of Notre Dame, but his presence is inescapably associ­ated with our university. We 

P.O.BoxQ 
Peter W alshe 
may be sure that Fr. Hesburgh 
accepted the invitation to sit on 
the Board from the highest 
motives, the best of intentions, 
but in light of the Banks 
dubious record can he in good 
conscience remain on the 
Board? I submit that David 
Rockefeller is using Fr. Hes­
burgh's good name, and his 
reputation as a morally com­
mitted citizen-servant of the 
U.S., to provide some degree of 
respectability for the Chase 
Manhattan enterprise. Notre 
Dame tries to function as a 
Christian university, so it is not 
absurdly idealistic to suggest 
that it should maintain a critical 
distance from ruling elites and 
their institutions. 
For several years now Notre Dame has been encouraging the study of justice issues. It does not make sense for the University to promote these efforts if at the same time it maintains a close link with an instituation like the Chase Man­hattan with its ethically shoddy history of political and econo­mic opportunism. Tryin~ to have it borh ways, all the nme, will lead inexorably to cynicism. 
The Iranian crisis contains many lessons for us all; it could inaugurate a period when, in the spirit of Matthew 7:5-6, we might begin to examine our own sinful history, particularly the scope we have given trans­nationals to pillage the third world and to shamefully manip­ulate polities. These issues will remain with us long after the current crisis has eased and, one hopes, the hostages have been released .

Although the Downtown Ath­letic Club of New York awards the trophy annually to "the out­standing college football player in the United States," all but three of the 44 previous winners were offensive backs, including flanker Johnny Rodgers of Ne­braska in 1972. 
The only lineman to win the Heisman were two-way ends, Larry Kelley ofYale in 1936 and Leon Hart of Notre Dame in 1949. Ohio State running back Archie Griffin, who captured the Heisman in 1974-75, is the only two-time winner. 
In a telephone hookup from Los Angeles, White said he was "surprised because I really felt Billy (Sims) showed a strong comeback, especially the game he had against Nebraska.'' 
Sims rushed for 247 yards against Nebraska on Nov. 24.

Jackson paces ND in victory 

by Mark Perry Sports Editor 
Strong inside play by Tracy Jackson in the first half and a potent fast break helped Notre Dame hold off a strong Iowa State team 87-77, in basketball action at the ACC last night. 
Jackson scored 11 . of his game-high 20 points in the opening half, including seven of nine on free throws generated by his aggressive penetration towards the basket. The Irish built up a 43-36 intermi:;sion lead that was never challenged in the second half. 
Kelly Tripucka added 17 points for Notre Dame, and the twv forwards combined for 12 points in the first seven minures ro build up a 20-10 lead. 
Iowa State rallied to within four at 31-27, but a 12-6 outburst, led by six points from Jackson, put the Irish out of reach. 
·'Tracy had a lot of confidence going tonight,'· said Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps. "He really needed a game like this. He did a good job of 
! hitting rhe boards, hustled throughout the game and shot very well. 

"We played well because we did an excellent job of forcing them into our transition game,'' Phelps added. "We have to get our press going, especially with (Bill) Hanzlik out. We gave up some easy points, but you can gamble with the lead." 
While Jackson, Tripucka, and the rest of the starters forged out the Irish lead, Phelps got so~e more excellent play from his. younger players that enabl­ed Notre Dame to keep it. 
'']ohn Paxson and Tim An­dree gave us a big tift in the second half,'' Phelps comment­ed. ''They played well and gave the starters the rest they need­ed, and kepr up the momentum and the: lead.'' 
Andree scored 10 points in 13 minutes and was very stro,ng under the boards for the Irish, while Paxson quarterbacked the offense and scored six points. 
''Tim has had two good ball games thus far,'' Phelps ob­served. "He has given us 13 minutes of solid play in both games, and really goes to the basket strong. Both Paxson and Andree have been playing well in pressure situations.'' 
Iowa State coach Lynn Nance felt that lapses by his squad were the big reason behind the Irish victory. 
"You have to play with high intensity the whole game if you want to be a good team," Nance noted. "We had two stretches of about four or five minutes where we lost it, and that's where we got burned. 
·'I felt Notre Dame played very well for this time of year. he added. ''They are deserving of their ranking, have excellent

It was a tournament of firsts for Notre Dame wrestling tn­captain Dave DiSabato and a tournament of split seconds for the rest of the Irish squad as they finished seventh in the 14th annual Rochester Invita­tional Tournament this week­end. 
DiSabato outclassed the field at I.14 pounds to clinch his second R.I.T. title. The Colum­bus, Ohio, native outscored his four foes 58-16 in the two-day tourney, his closest match being an 8-2 affair in the semi­finals. 
More importantly, those four wins upped DiSabato's career victory mark to 79, tying him with past great Pat McKillen for first on the all-time Irish wrestling win list. The talented senior is almost assured of reaching the 80 mark this weekend. 
''What can you really say about Dave?" wondered Ray Sepeta, now in his third year as Irish wrestling coach. "His years of hard work and dedica­tion are really obvious. Dave hasn't even reached his peak and he's leaving everyone in his wake.'' 
But for the rest of the Irish, seconds seemed to make the difference. 
''Time played a big part in the tournament,'' recalls Sepeta. "Several of our wrestlers, in­cluding Curt Rood and AI Mattaliano, could have won matches had there been a few extra seconds in the period. They had just started moves which, if completed, could have been match-winners but the time ran out. 
"In the same respect, some of our other wrestlers lost matches with just a few seconds left, so time was definitely a big factor." 
Bur time was not a deterrent to sophomore John Iglar. Com­bining basic units of strength and finesse, the Cincinnati, Ohio, product won three of his five matches to capture fourth place at 177 pounds. After losing his first match 13-4, Iglar posted 6-2, 7-0, 7-4 wins before dropping the consolation final face-off 
}unil'r AI Mattaliano also won 
three of five to garner "ixth 
place larels at 1)8. 
·'I've got to give all our wre-stlers credit,·' remarked Sepeta. ''They showed a marked improvement since the Michigan State tournament, particularly the freshmen.'' 
Four Irish wrestlers posted two wins apiece: freshmen Paul DeBaggis and Rich Tur­geon, sophomore Curt Rood and senior tri-captain Chris Favo. 
Now that those early season tournaments are behind them, the Irish wrestlers have to get down to business as they em­bark on their grueling dual meet slate. 
Wth hopes of bettering last year's 8-12 dual meet mark, the Irish head east this weekend for a showdown with Navy and Yale in New Haven, Conn., on Saturday afternoon at 1 p.m. 
''Navy probably will be the stronger of the two teams," explamed Sepeta. ''They have been ranked before, and they have a highly-disciplined, well­trained program. 
''But Yale has been known to rise to the occasion and has beaten Navy a few times, so it should be a tough triangular meet. We'll have as much competition as we want, if not more so." 
Yet, hopes are running hi8h. ''The team is really exctted about this week's meet, and I hope that they'II wrestle as keyed up as they feeL''
