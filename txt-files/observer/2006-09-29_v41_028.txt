New season tickets to fund stadium repairs 


Copyrighters track student offenders

Some things in life are free -but they are also illegal. 
More than one third of col­lege students nationwide download pirated music files via peer-to-peer file sharing networks, according to an April 2006 University of Richmond survey. More than half of all illegal downloading cases occur on college cam­puses -and that includes Notre Dame. 
The Office of Residence Life and Housing dealt with 78 cases of illegal file sharing during the 2005-06 academic year, said Assistant Director Kathy Brannock. 

And that number is only increasing. This semester, the office has already encoun­tered 50 incidents, she said. 
"We seem to be having more cases this year," Brannock said.

In an effort to generate money for Notre Dame Stadium repairs, the University will offer 5,000 sea­son football tickets starting in 2007, University officials announced Thursday. 
The University has not offered season tickets in more than 30 years, and the increased ticket revenue will help fund "ongoing preventa­tive maintenance" on the sta­dium, which is estimated to cost about $40 million, Executive Vice President John Affieck-Graves said at a press conference Thursday after­noon. 

The tickets will be sold at their face value plus an annu­al rights fee based on the tick­et location: $2,000 per ticket for sideline seats, $1,500 for corner seats and $1,200 for end zone seats. 
People affiliated with the University will be given priori­ty in the ticket lottery, Affleck­Graves said. Season ticket applications will be mailed in January to everyone who signs up on an online list at Notre Dame's athletic Web site. 
If more than 5,000 people appeal for tickets, then the University will use a lottery system to allocate the tickets -taking into consideration one's affiliation with the University. 
By 4 p.m. Friday, more than 750 people had already signed up to receive an application, said Assistant Vice President for News and Information Dennis Brown. 
The 5,000 tickets will come from a reduction in internal ticket allocations and from season tickets that have been returned during the last sev­eral years, Affleck-Graves said. 
"Internal tickets" refers to tickets allocated to academic departments, the University

21. He was notified when ORLH sent him an e-mail explaining how a copyright­owning company had "caught [himl and reported [himJ .tQ the University." 
"I got back to the dorm after my last class and checked my e-mail, hoping to get news from Facebook or something fun and interesting like that," Valiente said. "To my surprise though, there was an e-mail from ResLife, which freaked me out when I read the subject: 'Copyright Infringement."' 
Brannock said the University does not actively seek out students who violate copyright laws. Instead, the school is informed by "who­ever owns the copyright," she said. Notre Dame has been contacted by such groups as the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), HBO, NBC Universal and Columbia Pictures.

Panel ponders papal remarks about Islam 
By EILEEN DUFFY 
News Writer 

While Pope Benedict XVI's recent address on faith and rea­son at Germany's Regensburg University was not without flaw, five faculty members agreed Thursday at the Hesburgh Center, the media has presented an incomplete version of the speech. 
In his Sept. 12 remarks calling for "genuine dialogue of cultures and religions," the pope quoted an obscure 14th century Byzantine emperor as saying the Prophet Muhammad brought "things only evil and inhuman" to the world, "such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached." 
Director of the Center for Ethics and Culture W. David Solomon, theology professor Paul Kollman, history professor Brad Gregory, Director of the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies R. Scott Appleby and Kroc Institute scholar Rashied Omar debated just what the remarks meant ­and correct or not, now that they're out there, just what should be taken from them. 
The pope's words have incited a wave of backlash in the Muslim world, most notably the bombing of two West Bank churches and

Worthy of the mohawk? 
There is a very limited amount of people who have ever been cool enough, crazy enough and tough enough to successfully maintain a mohawk. So to the growing cult of libby­wannabes: if

Sports Writer 
lowing crite­
ria, please steer clear of 
the razor this weekend. 
We will start with perhaps the most recognizable mohawk of our generation: Mr. T. Despite spending his twilight eliminating long dis­tance phone costs, our exhibit A­and The A-team's finest-has brought cool to a whole new level. He established himself as a trend­setter with his shameless gold neck jewelry and countless earrings. 
And although he is necklace-free, our own Mr. Z is setting some trends of his own. 
Next we turn our attention to the world of heavy metal music, where Tommy Z comes 'hawk to 'hawk with world-class drummer Tommy Lee. The one-time husband of Baywatch babe Pamela Anderson is infamous for his crazy hotel parties and hardcore rock. As is evident in his short-lived film career, Lee lives his life in the fast lane and has the haircut to match. 
Tommy Z has never trashed a hotel room (that we know about), but he's torn apart enough punt cov­erages to land himself in the same category of Motley Crew's pride and joy. 
To find the toughest of mohawks we have to go back to World War II where members of the 101st Airborne paratroopers put an end to the crew cut and grew out their 'hawks. The "Filthy 13," as they called themselves, were the first to land at Normandy on D-Day and eliminated hundreds of enemy shooters in minutes. 
Although it took a little longer than 49 seconds to deliver their knockout blow, the men of the 101st are easily the toughest to use hair gel. 
The first Mohawk was discovered on a man from 300 B.C. who died in his twenties. The man, who used plant oil to cement his spike, was preserved in a bog outside of Dublin, Ireland. The Irish have come a long way in the past two millennia. but clearly we have not lost our roots. 
In conclusion, I strongly support backing your team. But unless you can compare with the esteemed list above I suggest you stick to the No. 9 jerseys. 
If you feel your personality can be summed up in a single letter, yet still be powerful enough to change a man's life in under a minute, then by all means break out the Bics. 
Otherwise, learn from Samson's mistakes and save your hair-and your dignity.

Police find meth in man's prosthetic leg 
JAY, Okla. -Sheriff's deputies have arrested a Grove man on drug charges after finding crystal methamphetamine inside his prosthetic leg. Larry Clinton Harper, 64, was arrested at his busi­ness, Harper's Used Cars and Body Shop, last week. 
During a search, deputies found drugs inside a sock-like cover­ing inside Harper's pros­thetic leg, said Delaware County Sheriff's Capt. Larry Barnett. 
"They just tumbled out, and he just laughed," 
Barnett said. "He said he thought he was pulling

Law school hopefuls face exam 
Students to trade tailgating for test taking during Saturday's LSAT 
By EMMA DRISCOLL 
News Writer 
While the atmosphere on most of campus tomorrow morning will be alive with tra­ditional home game excite­ment, the atmosphere in DeBartolo Hall will be signifi­cantly more serious when stu­dents hunch over and face the Law School Admission Test [LSAT]. 

"A lot of students express anxiety about [the LSAT] hap­pening on a game day," said Arts and Letters Associate Director Ava Preacher, who serves as the law advisor for the University. 
But Preacher said there have been at least nine LSATs administered on game days during the years since she has been advising those interested in law, and during those years, students have not come back to complain about the timing. 
Since students usually arrive early for the exam, tests are administered in DeBartolo's interior rooms and doors are locked during the exam, Preacher is sure test-takers "won't hear a whole lot of [ ... ] game day distractions." 
The LSAT contains an ana­lytical reasoning section, which Preacher said is "collo­quially known as 'the logic games."' There are also logical reasoning and reading com­prehension components. 
While the actual test time adds up to about three and half hours, Preacher said stu­dents should "plan to be there for about five hours," primari­ly because of breaks scheduled during the exam. 
Notre Dame students tend to fare well on the exam --the University's mean is 159 out of the highest possible 180, 
according to Preacher. Of the 182 senior law school applicants from the 2004-05 academic year, 15 7 students were accepted into law school. 
Students pre­pare for the exam in various ways, but Preacher said many take "com­mercial prep classes," like those offered by Kaplan. It is pos­
the range of schools.to which [students considering law school] can apply," Preacher said. "The higher the scores, the larger the range." 
In the past academic year, Preacher has had at least 300 meetings with undergraduates. graduates and alumni seeking advising in the past academic year. Law schools attract

Ava Preacher law advisor and associate director of the College of Arts and Letters 

sible, she said, for students to do self-directed study. 
"However, if students are going to prepare on their own, the.Y need to talk to me," said Preacher, because it is impor­tant for students to know what materials to use and how to approach their study. 
Still, the LSAT is not every­thing when applying to law school. 
"Students always think it's a numbers game, and actually the LSAT and GPA only define applicants of var­ious backgrounds and experiences. 
"[People con­sidering law school] are very diverse," Preacher said. "We have stu­dents from every major, every type of personality. It's interesting." 
Some students who come to Notre Dame may be interested in staying to attend 
law school at the University. As for the prospects of current Notre Dame students applying to the law school, "I wouldn't say it's easier or harder," Preacher said. 
She did say, however, that the top-end applicants -and therefore, those accepted -to Notre Dame Law School often come from the University's stu­dent body.

Fans anticipating an easy win over Purdue 
By LAURA WILCZEK and 
EILEEN DUFFY 
News Writers 

Just a week after Notre 
Dame students doused them­
selves with Stonehenge 
waters in ecstatic celebration 
of the win over Michigan 
State, fans have to towel off 
their cocky attitudes and 
prepare for a new foe: 
Purdue. 

While the team found itself in dire straits last Saturday, students don't anticipate this game to be quite as daunt­ing. The stress that opened the fourth quarter in East Lansing has receded -or in sophomore Laura Benca's case, disappeared. 
''I'm not worried at all," she said. "We can definitely beat them." 
Purdue, though, wilJ ride into South Bend high on a four-win, no-loss record. And even considering that none of its opponents was ranked (while two of Notre Dame's four were), Purdue has still beaten Notre Dame 25 times in the series history. 
That's more times than any other school, besides University of Southern California's 29 times and Michigan State's 25, accord­ing to the University's Official Athletic Web site. 
Plus, Purdue beat the Irish

41-26 during their last visit to Notre Dame Stadium in 2004. 
In fact, Purdue coach Joe Tiller seems to be just as cocksure as Irish fans. 
"Obviously, [Notre Dame is] not connecting and gaining yards," he said in a recent press conference. " ... [That] helps your own team's confi­dence and allows you to work your way into the game." 
Sophomore Melissa Lee certainly hopes Notre Dame can wrangle a victory from the Boilermakers. For Lee, more than the football team's pride is on the line. 
"Practically my whole fami­ly went to Purdue," she said. "If we lose this weekend, I will not be able to show my face at Christmas." 
Whether coach Dan Devine was right in the movie "Rudy" when he said "nobody comes into our house and pushes us around" now lies in the hands -and feet -of the football players. 
They'll also set the post­game campus mood ­though whether the fountain will provide the setting for a second round of victorious revelry probably rests in the hands of Mother Nature.

Dame Wheaties. 
"The excitement surround­ing Notre Dame football brings more people to cam­pus, and while they're here the likelihood that they will pick up souvenirs for their families is very high," said Sally Wiatrowski, director of the Bookstore. · 
While bound by her employ­ment contract from dis­cussing any specific sales fig­ures, Wiatrowski did break into a smile when asked about the increase in profits observed during football weekends. 
Irish fans never fail to pur­chase rally beads, blue and gold porn poms, leprechaun temporary tattoos and Notre Dame hooded sweatshirts. 
The best-selling item before home games, however, con­tinues to be "The Shirt" ­more than 100,000 have been sold already, and the Bookstore recently restocked its supply of the navy blue T­shirts. 
With seven home games scheduled this fall -one more than previous seasons -Wiatrowski suspects the demand for "The Shirt" will extend itself further into. the year. 
New items such as the Irish­inspired Wheaties have also found a market among fans of both Notre Dame and its rival teams.. 
"General Mills came to us with this idea," Wiatrowski said. "I believe they also launched USC, Texas and Ohio State Wheaties, but we were the first university they contacted." 
The venture turned out to be a success, resulting in 12,000 boxes of Notre Dame Wheaties sold in a day and a half during the Michigan game weekend. 
The Bookstore promptly ordered 15,000 more boxes to sell on Saturday. 
"It's a fun and unique item, and people seem happy to buy it," Wiatrowski said. 
They should be even happi­er to know that their Bookstore purchases help fur­ther Notre Dame's academic mission, since a portion of the revenues are directed toward scholarship funds. 
Luis Castaneda, a 1996 MBA graduate, brought his wife and young sons to South Bend this weekend for the Purdue game and to the Bookstore Thursday to con­tribute to those revenues. 
"I came back from Mexico for the 10-year class reunion," said Castaneda, as his youngest boy eyed the shirt emblazoned with the new Popeye-looking lep­rechaun. "It's a dream come true to be here with my wife and kids." 
The Castafiedas beat the lines expected to form this Saturday. 
"Purdue is really a drive-in game for most people, so we don't really expect the major­ity of fans to come in until Saturday morning," Wiatrowski said. 
When teams like USC come to South Bend from more dis­tant places, fans also arrive earlier, and so the Bookstore traffic is heavy on Thursdays and Fridays and a little more relaxed during the hours before kickoff, Wiatrowski said.

Lebanese troops slow in withdrawal 
JEHUSALEM -Despite repeated Israeli assurances of a quick troop withdrawal from Lebanon, Israeli officials said Thursday they vvcre reluctant to complete the pullout more than six weeks after a cease-fire agreement ended a month of bloody conflict. 
Several issues -large and small -remain unresolved, involving the future roles of Hezbollah guerrillas, U.N. forces and the Lebanese army in the border area, and the overall prospect of keeping the guns and rockets silent. Israel fears protests by Hezbollah supporters along the border are a harbinger of greater violence. 
Security oflicials say a few thousand Israeli troops are still just across the border in I .ebanon, left over from a large-scale Israeli offensive that followed a July 12 cross-bor­der raid by Hezbollah guerrillas who killed three soldiers and captured two others. 
Russia grants Cuba $350 million 
HAVANA-Russia agreed on Thursday to grant Cuba credit worth $350 million and restructure some of its recent debt during a visit by Russia's prime minister, officials said. The two countries also signed a military cooperation agreement. 
Cuban Defense Minister Raul Castro, who is acting president while his elder brother Fidel recovers from intestinal surgery, gave red-carpet treatment to Mikhail Fradkov, the highest-ranking Russian official to come to Cuba since a visit by President Vladimir Putin in 2000. 
Wearing a gray suit instead of his custom­ary military uniform, Castro escorted Fradkov through the halls of Havana's Palace of the Revolution, past rows of sol­diers playing Cuba's anthem.

Details of school standoff released 
BAILEY, Colo. -The gunman who killed a student and committed suicide during a high school standoff methodically selected six girls as hostages -apparently favoring blondes ­and sexually assaulted at least some of them, authorities and witnesses said Thursday. 
Sheriff Fred Wegener said the assaults went beyond touching or fondling. "It was pretty horrific," Wegener said, with­out elaborating. 
The killer was identified as 53-year-old Duane Morrison, a petty criminal who had a Denver address but had apparently been liv­ing in his battered yellow Jeep when he walked inside the school Wednesday with two handguns and a backpack that he claimed contained a bomb. Investigators did not immediately say what was in the backpack. 

Carter says divided U.S. in danger 
FALLON, Nev. -Former President Jimmy Carter said Wednesday major poli­cy changes are needed because the Iraq war has divided the nation "almost as much as Vietnam." 
"So there's no doubt that our country is in much more danger now from terrorism than it would have been if we would have done what we should have done and stayed in Afghanistan," he said on the campaign trail with his son, Democratic 
U.S. Senate nominee Jack Carter.

IN BRIEF 
Delphi Corp. tries to avoid strike 
NEW YORK -Delphi Corp. said Thursday that 
a judge gave it more time to pursue negotiations 
with its labor unions, which could allow the trou­
bled auto-parts maker to cut labor costs without 
triggering a worker strike. 
The company said in a statement that U.S. 
Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain granted renewed 
requests from Delphi to delay court hearings on 
its requests to scuttle its union contracts and to 
terminate thousands of supply contracts with 
General Motors Corp. 
Drain asked the company's lawyers to return to his chambers Oct. 19 for a closed-door meeting at which Delphi will be expected to provide a new progress report. On Thursday, a Delphi attorney said the company was making progress in its negotiations. 
"Delphi continues to believe there is constant progress being made on discussions of a plan framework, as well as our discussions with our labor unions," Jack Butler, an attorney for Delphi, said in an interview after he provided a progress report to Drain. 
New pension rules to affect investors 
NEW YORK-Now that corporate America's pension promises will be thrust into the spot­light by new regulations, investors should watch for accounting tricks companies may use to reduce their benefit obligations. 
New rules from U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board will force companies to report the status of their pensions and other post-retirement employee benefits -as an asset or, for most, a liability if they are under­funded -on their balance sheets rather than have them buried in a footnote to the financial statements. 
That means huge liabilities could suddenly drop like a bomb onto balance sheets, putting any deficits squarely in the public view and possibly throwing some lending agreements into question because it may lead to sharp drops in corporate net worth. 
Figuring out if any maneuvering is going on won't be an easy task. Investors will have to closely watch companies' assumptions for such things as health care and wage inflation that arc used to determine the costs of defined ben­efit plans, which promise retirees a monthly ·<.,heck and often medical coverage. 
Dow Jones reaches milestone

Associated Press 

NEW YORK -The Dow

reached a milestone 
Thursday in Wall Street's 
nearly seven-year recovery 
from corporate upheaval, 
economic recession and ter­

its record high close of

rising to a high of 11,728.46

investors; still, it was the 
market's fourth straight 
advance.

"The pope selec­tively retrieved from a vast Muslim tradi­tion one viewpoint, thereby reducing Islam to one voice," Omar said. "Contemporary Muslim theories are a hybrid of cla..'isical Muslim schools. All are a very far cry from the monochro­matic pieture pre­sented by Pope Benedict." 
The decentralized

"The reality :;eems to be that while the overwhelming majority of Muslims denounce violence, the fact i'i, not all do," he said. "The sociological realities of the religion prevent the former from exercis­ing any categorical power over the latter." 
The pope, who has since issued an apology for his reference to the quotation from Manuel Palcologos II, deserves an "extraordinary amount of respect," Appleby said. But listeners often overestimate the authority of his words.

"I want to suggest that maybe the target of the talk was us, meaning the modern university," Solomon said, explaining the pope was calling for more unity between various departments and colleges in a university. 
Nonetheless, Solomon called the pope's attempt to analyze faith and reason throughout the history of the Western world in just eight pages "utterly irresponsible."

The pope's words were meant for those listening -the stu­dents of Hegensburg University,

"The pope only ha..'> one context, which is the globe," Appleby said. " ... lie does not, unfortunately for him, have the luxury of delivering a fine, nuanced, professorial talk at Hegensburg. If he didn't know that, he knows it now." · 
The media certainly was listen­ing, and what the faculty feels journalists gleaned from the pope's speech were the most extreme of his quotations. As Omar pointed out, it's likely no Muslims were present at .Regensburg University, and their understanding of the lecture came from the press.

Mother threatened to harm son, father said 
Boy remains missing after mother's suicide 
Associated Press 

ORLANDO, Fla.-A missing 2-year-old boy was shuttled between two feuding parents and even into foster care in the months before he vanished and his mother committed sui­cide, newly released docu­ments show. 
The boy's father had report­ed Melinda Duckett threat­ened to harm their son on sev­eral occasions during their marriage. He even alleged she held a knife to his leg and threatened to kill him last year. 
Florida Department of Child & Families investiga­tors determined that was the only allegation that could be verified. In several others, there were "some indicators" for possible child neglect, but little evi­dence to support abuse, according to the five-page document released Wednesday. 
DCF spokesman Tim Bottcher said there were "never really any clear-cut indicators that Trenton was abused." 
Duckett committed suicide almost two weeks after reporting the boy missing Aug. 27 from his bedroom at her Leesburg home. She 
has since been named the primary suspect in the boy's disappearance after investi­gators found some of Trenton's toys, photographs and a sonogram photo in a trash bin in her apartment complex. 
The case has drawn national attention from a spot on America's Most Wanted and several nights' coverage on CNN Headline News' Nancy Grace pro­gram. Some blamed Duckett's suicide on Grace's aggressive questioning in an interview the day before she shot herself. Grace accused Melinda Duckett of hiding something because she refused to take a polygraph test after her divorce attor­ney advised her not to. 
The boy's father, Josh Duckett, has repeatedly crit­icized the state for allowing Melinda to have custody of their son. Court documents show he didn't complete the agency's requirements to keep the boy, such as taking sevcraJ counseling classes. 
Duckett told The Associated Press he didn't have enough money to com­plete the last class. 
According to the court document, the last known dispute between Josh and Melinda occured July 5, when she told authorities she received a threatening e-mail from him.

Leaders discuss defeat of Afghani insurgents 
Associated Press 
LONDON -The leaders of Britain and Pakistan pledged their commitment Thursday to defeating insurgents in Afghanistan, brushing aside a leaked British military document that claimed Islamabad's securi­ty forces are indirectly support­ing terrorist groups. 
Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Gen. Pervez Musharraf met for two hours, with both reinforcing their support of a NATO-led mission to support the Kabul government, a Blair spokesman said. 
The meeting, at Chequers, Blair's oflicial country residence west of London, followed Musharrafs visit to Washington, where he held talks with President Bush and Afghan leader Hamid Karzai. 
Thursday's meeting had threatened to be overshadowed by a military document obtained by the British Broadcasting Corp. in which n senior officer maintained Pakistan's Directorate of Inter Services Intelligence -the country's top spy agency -should be disman­tled. 
The broadcaster reported the document was written by an unidentified senior researcher at the Defense Academy, a defense · ministry think-tank and college. 
It said the author was also linked to the intelligence services and the document was part of a private British review of efl'orts across the world to combat ter­rorism. 
Musharraf rejected that allega­tions that its security forces had indirectly supported terrorist groups and raised the issue with

Blair during their meeting. 
"The president accepted that 
document is not government pol­
icy, so there was no further need 
to discuss it," said a spokesman 
for Blair's office, speaking on 
condition of anonymity in line 
with policy. 
He said Blair also assured 
Musharraf that British troops 
would remain in Afghanistan for 
the "long term," as part of the 
NATO mission. 
Musharraf told Blair he recog­
nized the need to continue work­

Because of the religious component to the film, Groody was not sure how it would be received in the pub­lic forum. 
"Despite Ithe religious com­ponent], it also kind of is just another chapter in the rela­tionship between religion and politics," Groody said. 
And very quickly, the film caught thp, attention of politi­cians, particularly prominent Hispanic leaders, who arranged for Groody take his message to Capitol Hill today. 
"There were some Hispanic leaders in Washington who found out about the film," Groody said. "They are gath­ering together a group of con­gressional leaders ... and are organizing a forum with some congressional debate." 
Though his film is a rele­vant topic for congressman, Groody said the issue of

Groody said it is important to look at this film, and its message, from a global perspective. 
"Out of that, we have to then just reflect on what is our col­lective response to what is hap­pening to these people," he said. 
For Groody, whose target audience was 
originally college campuses, the national and international suc­cess of the film is

He wanted to create some­thing to help reshape the "imagination about migrants" and he thought film would be an effective way to get his message out. 
"If we really knew their sto­ries we would not be afraid of these people. If you knew their face, you would in many ways be inspired," Groody said. · 
An important consideration, Groody said, is the Church's view on migration and how Notre Dame is contributing to that.

"We first showed it at Harvard, then Oxford over the summer," Groody said, adding that it is also being brought to Stanford University soon. 
The film, which was a Harry Chapin Media Award finalist in the category of "Outstanding Te levisinn/Film Coverage That Positively Impacts Hunger, Poverty and Self-Reliance," grew out of ideas Groody first explored in his book "Border of Death, Valley of Life."

Groody has already released a follow-up film called "Strangers No Longer," which he hopes will, in some small way, help with "making the lives and voices of these people known to people who might otherwise not see them."

A Web site posted an audio clip Thursday reportedly recorded by the new leader of ai-Qaida in Iraq, Abu Hamza ai-Muhajir. 
and Shiites on Monday. He called on insurgents in Iraq to capture Westerners so they could be traded for the impris­oned Egyptian sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, who was con­victed in 1995 of conspiring to blow up New York City land­marks. 
"I appeal to every holy warrior in the land of Iraq to exert all efforts in this holy month so that God may enable us to capture some of the Western dogs to swap them with our sheik and get him out of his dark prison," the voice on the tape said. 
Al-Masri, a Sunni Muslim, has been relatively silent since tak­ing over control of al-Qaida in Iraq earlier this year -a sharp contrast. with al-Zarqawi, who frequently issued audiotapes and even a videotape that showed his face a few weeks before his death. 
Meanwhile, police found 40 more bodies in the capital, and bombings and shootings killed at least 21 people in a spike of violence with the onset of Ramadan. 
A car bomb exploded near a restaurant in central Baghdad, killing five people and wounding 34, police said. Many of the injured had serious burns and some were not expected to sur­vive, police Lt. Ali Mohsen said at the Kindi Hospital.

Antidepressant, pain reliever caused death 
Associated Press 
NASSAU -Anna Nicole Smith believes a pathologist's conclu­sion that her son died from an accidental lethal combination of drugs shows he didn't commit suicide and hopes that others will learn from the tragedy, a lawyer said Thursday. 
An American examiner hired by the family, Cyril Wecht, said 20-year-old Daniel Smith had methadone and two antidepres­sants in his system when he died Sept. 10 in his mother's hospital mom in the Bahamas. Low levels of the three drugs interacted to cause an acciden­tal death, Wecht said. 
"At least she knows the attacks on her son's reputation can be put to rest because it's clear he didn't intentionally take his life," said Wayne Munroe, a Bahamian attorney for the 38­year-old reality TV star and for­mer Playboy Playmate. 
Smith, who gave birth to a daughter three days before her son died at her bedside, is awaiting the conclusions of Wecht and the Bahamas pathol­ogist who performed a separate official autopsy, Munroe said. 
Wecht is waiting for test results on tissue samples before he completes his fmal report. 
Smith wants others to learn 
from her son's death, Munroe 
told The Associated Press. 
"She wants to see exactly what happened in a final report because she wants to make sure it doesn't happen to someone else's son,"he said. 
Daniel Smith, who reportedly was hospitalized for depression and back pain before he trav­eled to Nassau, had been pre­scribed the antidepressant Lexapro, Wecht said. He said he had not determined whether Smith had also been prescribed Zoloft, the other antidepressant found in his system. 
The two drugs can be lethal when taken together or in sequence, according to Ann Blake Tracy, the Des Moines, Iowa-based director of the International Coalition for Drug Awareness. 
"The residue can stay there for some time, and if they're prescribed one after they've taken another, they can end up in trouble," she said. 
Wecht said he did not know why Smith was taking methadone, a pain-reliever that is also used to ease heroin crav­ings for recovering addicts. 
The combination of the three drugs, even in low doses, could easily have killed Smith, said Lisa Johnson, a pharmacist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in

Disfigured girl receives new face after surgery 
Doctors remove life­threatening growth 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -A Haitian teen who once hid her grossly distorted face smiled and danced Thursday, a sign of how far she has come since doctors removed a 16-pound tumor-like growth. 
When Martie Casseus arrived in Miami in December, the growth had stretched her facial features said Dr. Jesus Gomez, a maxillofa­cial surgeon at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. 
"In the future she's going to look like a normal person," Gomez said. 
The series of surgeries have progressively flattened Mar lie's cheeks, centered her eyes and defined her nose. Her face is still elongated and slightly asymmetri­cal, and Gomez said she will likely need additional cosmetic surger­ies once she stops growing. 
Martie suffers from a rare form 
so far apart that only her eyes, nos­trils and a single tooth were recog­nizable. 
Though her lower lip now hangs open, causing her to drool slightly, the 15-year­old smiled broadly and shimmied at reporters and tele­vision cameras.

Antoine, the teen's mother, said in English, which she has learned since coming to Horida with her daughter. 
Surgeons removed the massive growth, narrowed the separation between her eyes and lips and rebuilt the interior of her nose and jaw in three surgeries in the past year at lloltz Children's I lospital. 
A reconstructive surgery to reshape a titanium plate previous­ly implanted in her jaw, scheduled Oct. 5, will be her last for now, in her windpipe

also still has a feeding tube. 
Doctors will continue to monitor her condition, but the lesion that deformed her face is not expected to grow back once she completes puberty, Gomez said.

Next space shuttle to lift off during nighttime 
NASA relaxes daylight rulefor Discovery launch 
Associated Press 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. ­For the first time in four years, the next space shuttle launch attempt most likely will be at night, NASA said Thursday. 
The first launch possibility for Discovery will be Dec. 7 at 9:38 
p.m. EDT, the first try at night since Endeavour lifted off Nov. 23, 2002 at 7:49 p.m. Discovery's launch window extends to Dec. 26. 
After the Columbia disaster in 2003, the U.S. space agency began requiring that launches be made in daylight so the space shuttle could be pho­tographed to spot possible dam­age during liftoff. Insulating foam from Columbia's external fuel tank struck the spacecraft's wing during launch, causing. a breach that allowed fiery gases to penetrate the vehicle when it returned through Earth's atmosphere. All seven astro­nauts were killed. 
NASA has launched three shuttle flights since the Columbia disaster, all in day­light and with new inspection equipment and techniques for checking for damage. The most recent two launches lost small amounts of foam that didn't threaten the shuttle. 
After last week's successful finish of Atlantis' 12-day mis­sion, NASA officials indicated they were willing to relax the daylight rule since there are now new methods for inspect­ing the shuttle for holes or cracks while in orbit. They said a night launch is needed to stay on schedule to finish construc­tion of the international space station in 14 more flights by 2010. 
"It is very important to us," Leroy Cain, launch integration manager, said last week. 
Discovery's launch on Dec. 7 would interfere with a sched­uled launch of an Atlas 5 rocket carrying satellites to space, so NASA officials must consult with Air Force officials about that date. 
During Discovery's 11-day mission, astronauts will rewire the space station's electrical system and drop oil' flight engi­neer Suni Williams for her six­month stay aboard the orbiting outpost.

Bloomberg pushes for trans fats ban in NYC 
Mayor cites De Niro's restaurant as example 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Days after city health officials proposed outlawing trans fats in eater­ies, Mayor Michael Bloomberg defended the ban and tried to drag Robert De Niro into the debate because the actor's restaurants do not use the man-made oil. 
De Niro, an owner and investor in several culinary hotspots, went to City Hall on Thursday for a news confer­ence related to his Tribeca Film Festival, but stayed for the mayor's general press briefing, at

should be playing head chef, causing restaurants and bakeries citywide to consider makeovers for the Big Apple's favorite treats. 
Confessing his love for french fries and oily popcorn, the mayor said everyone could still enjoy those snacks because they can be made without the artificial trans fatty acids, which arc thought to cause cholesterol problems and increase risk of heart dis­ease. 
Experts say corn, canola and soy oils are safer but general­ly taste and cost the same as the trans fats. 
"You're getting an ingredi­ent out that nobody's going to miss," Bloomberg said. 
With De Niro standing behind, him, the mayor point­ed out that many food makers already have eliminated trans fats, following the Food and Drug Administration's requirement this year that ingredient labels show trans fat content. Companies includ­ing Frito-Lay and Kraft have reconfigured recipes for many of their most popular pack­aged goods, including Doritos and Oreos, replacing the trans fats, which are typically listed as partially hydrogenated oil. 
Many restaurants have done the same. The example was already set by some city eater­ies that never used artificial oils in the first place, such as De Niro's Nobu and Tribeca Grill. 
"If you look at some of the best restaurants in this city, including Robert De Niro's, they do not use trans fats because they don't need them in their

If the ban is approved by the end of this year, the city Department of Health would require restaurants to strip trans fats from their food by July 2008. 
The city chapter of the New York State Restaurant Association says the law would create culinary night­mares for chefs and maintains Bloomberg is going too far in trying to outlaw an ingredient.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Reconsidering pope's remarks 
Professor Rice has, as usual, written well and I applaud Pope Benedict XVI's recent effort at peacemaking. However, his con­tentious and much lamented passage seems to strike as a noisy gong that continues to reverberate, jarring the sensibil­ities of many. It could have sounded much differently, had self-reflection-truly our tradi­tion -guided its telling. Bad things happen, as Jesus tells us, when we begin to obsess over the speck in our neighbor's eye. 
Had Benedict XVI, then, thought to cite Luther's "On War Against the Turks" (1529) mat­ters would today be different. Ian Hazlett, reader in ecclesiasti­cal history in the School of Divinity of the University of Glasgow, says of Luther's work: "In this (Luther) startlingly rejects the old concept of reli­gious crusade. This was based on his innovative notion that war on the grounds of religion was not permissible, since coercion in spiritual matters is unchris­tian." 
As a man of peace, Benedict XVI draws on a long tradition of peacemaking. That we might give thanks to God one day in the future that he has unceas­ingly employed that tradition to dispel, rather than encourage, this popular, yet specious, notion of a clash of civiliza­tions.

OVERBURDENED NARRATIVE DOOMS 'DAHLIA' 
By JENNIFER DAWN HOPKINS Scene Critic 
The story of the Black Dahlia is the stuff Hollywood dreams are made of. Brian De Palma's telling of the tale, however, is the stuff Hollywood nightmares are made of. 
The story of Elizabeth Short, a pinup girl found gruesomely murdered and bisected, provides more than adequate potential to be transformed into an art-,y masterpiece that would unite the lovers of film nair and CSI alike. The star-studded cast promised talent, or -at the very least -two solid hours of pleasing eye-candy. The failure of the film to deliver on all fronts is, then, almost as shrouded in mystery as the mur­der itself. 
The viewers who anticipate seeing the events of Elizabeth Short's grisly murder unfold will leave the theater knowing less than before. The plot follows the personal story of every possible character, branching

ofr in so many directions the viewer is lost in a maze of story lines that tries entirely too hard to be fuJI of intrigue. Any identifi­able point of the film is lost and the viewer is left wondering who -or even what ­the film was about in the first place. 
The film begins reminiscent of a bad black and white detective story and is never able to climb out of that cliched mindset. The dialogue is uncomfortable and tries to cram in 1940s colloquialisms at the expense of any explanation of charac­ter background or motivation. Detective Bucky Bleichert's (Josh Hartnett)'s attempts to explain relevant background information through voiceover are unhelpful. There is no performance to fal1 back on, no stand­out actor that delivers a believable, deep and meaningful character. Even Scarlett Johansson's sex appeal seems forced -a feat once considered utterly impossible. 
The one interesting character is the only non-living character in the film. Elizabeth Short (Mia Krishner) is the only one that seems motivated in her actions, which include getting herself killed. Detective Lee Blanchard's (Aaron Eckhart) obsession with the Black Dahlia, on the other hand, is sudden and unmotivated, causing a char­acter so internally contrasting that it is no loss to the story when he, and his unneces­sary drama, die in an equally unnecessarily bloody scene.

THE GENIUS/HACK CoMPLEx: BRIAN DE PALMA 
By MARTY SCHROEDER Assistant Scene Editor 
Brian De Palma is one of the most polar­izing directors in Hollywood. Opinions of him range from genius "auteur" to com­plete and utter hack. Part of the "movie­brat" generation of filmmakers, De Palma has explored genres ranging from the Alfred Hitchcockian psychological thriller "Sisters" (1973) to gangland dramas focus­ing both on gangsters (1983's "Scarface") and the law that attempt-, to hinder them (1987's "The Untouchables"). 
De Palma emerged on the cinema scene alongside contemporaries George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese. These men, along with De Palma, graduat­ed from film schools and were overtly cine­literate. They had seen many films and were highly knowledgeable of cinema theo­ries. 
They rebelled against the "director as technician" mode of filmmaking predomi­nant in Hollywood up to that point and instead focused on an authorship mode of filmmaking in which their personal vision shaped their films. 
Unlike Lucas with his "Star Wars" trilogy and Spielberg with "Jaws," De Palma was not a director that had a mega-hit in the 1970s. Instead he focused on darker themes that did not appeal to as large of an audience as did the works of the aforemen­tioned directors. In this vein, De Palma released "Obsession" in 1976 starring John Lithgow. Written by Paul Schrader, a screenwriter that has worked with Scorsese and is also part of the "movie­brat" generation, this film focused on male­female relationships and explored further love and romance in the style ofHitchcock. 
This film, along with many others of De Palma's to come, was criticized because it was seen too much as an homage to Hitchcock (the script was based on Hitchcock's "Vertigo") and less than origi­nal. 
Following in the same remake vein, De Palma remade Howard Hawks' gangster film, "Scarface," in 1983. Starring AI 

to remember that the film is supposed to be 
about the most notorious murder in 
California, and attempts to makeup for the 
previous lack of grisly details with some 
uncomfortably long adult video clips and a 
murder flashback that makes even the 
most seasoned Nipffuck veterans look 
away in disgust. In the last five minutes of 
the film-and with the help of the trusty 
montage -De Palma tries to tie all of the 
loose ends into a neat package that gives 
closure to this most notorious of cases. 
By solving the crime, De Palma essential­ly takes away the heart of the mystery sur­rounding the case, an act that would be 1excusable if the solution was remotely 
Pacino, the violence and graphic language 
has been oft criticized; however, this partic­
ular film in De Palma's filmography is 
interesting due to the cult following. it has 
created. Instead of noticing the fact it is a 
remake, many fans of the film consider 
scenes of excess and violence part of its 
"cool factor." 

Next to "Scarface" and "The 
Untouchables" -both gangster pies popu­
lar with American audiences -De Palma's 
most noted film is the Stephen King adap­
tation "Carrie." Starring a young Sissy 
Spacek and John Travolta, this film was 
popular as a horror film but also explored 
teen issues and made use of De Palma's 
signature split screen and slow motion, 
showcasing his preference for visual story­
telling rather than dialogue. 
All his creativity aside, recent years have 
brought a blockbuster style to his filmmak­
ing. 2000's "Mission to Mars" was a sci-fi 
drama that seemed to have little to do with 
his previous films, and "Mission: 
Impossible" was a complete blockbuster 
with little room for exploration. While De motivated or even interesting. Instead, we are presented with a suspect out of left field, an unconvinciiJ.g and-if possible ­more confusing explanation that somehow motivates Bucky to right. the rest of the wrongs in the world, most of which have nothing at all to do with any aspect of the Black Dahlia case. 
"The Rlack Dahlia" attempts to cover far too many plotlines in far too little detail, and De Palma fails to convey the notoriety of the case that has stunned California for generations . 
Contact Jennifer Dawn Hopkins at jhopkinl@nd.edu 
Palma was able to explore interesting twists on love and romance, the star power of Tom Cruise tends to overshadow any directorial nuances that may have been present. 
2006 brings De Palma to "The Black Dahlia." This film melds his love of_gang­sters -albeit in a more noirish fashion than his previous films -his interest in gender relations and the perdition of male lust. Initial feedback has been negative, but, by this point, De Palma has thick enough skin to handle the critics. 
Loved and hated, De Palma has consis­tently been able to find films he wants to make. His vast knowledge of cinema makes his films a joy to watch -even if the narra­tives are not particularly strong. He has also made a diverse range of films, from horror to action to drama and everything in between. Not as well known as other film­makers, he is nonetheless a creative mind who is in love with movies.

Childhood movies bring a tear to my eye 
By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Scene Editor 
There are some fllms that I like to call "forgotten classics." Nobody else seems to remember them and ifwe talk about them today, only our peers seem to know what we're talking about. I don't mean movies like "Labyr­inth" or "Hook," because those movies are classics in a weird sort of way-and more importantly, people remember them. I mean the obscure stuff that nobody seems to ever think about except in the most '­inopportune times, like during tests or mass or interviews. The thing about these movies is that they're actually pretty good,exceptthatnobody seems to know they exist. With that in mind, let's take a trip down memory lane and remember some ofthose oldies but goodies from our younger days. 
The Rocketeer 
For years I thought Brendan Fraser was in this movie, mostly because it seems like the weird kind of part he would take. Turns out it's some guy named Bill Campbell (not to be confused with the truly awesome Bruce Campbell of "Evil Dead" 

Brian Doxtader 
Scene Editor 

fame) who stars in this period piece about a guy who gets a jetpack and becomes a symbol of patri­otic heroism triumphing over the Nazis. 
It's pulpy and serial­esque, but the concept is truly cool and the outfits and design are actually pretty decent. Timothy Dalton, a one-time James Bond, is the villain and Jennifer Connelly is the girlfriend. 
Dick Tracy 
Based on the old comic strip, "Dick Tracy" was directed by Warren Beatty, who also stars as the square-jawed detective. The film's design, which evokes old comic strips. is superb. And the cast is great. Really. Al Pacino plays Big Boy Caprice, the crotchety gangster baddie, Dustin Hoffinan is a mem­orable mumbling rat and Madonna is Breathless Mahoney ... actually, Madonna is really only eye candy until the twist end-. 
ing.· , ' ~ti I . ­
Pacino actually got nomi­nated for an Oscar for this role, which is surprising because he didn't get nom­inated for "The Godfather Part III" which came out the same year. It amazing­ly won a few awards and was nominated for a bunch more. And come on, how could someone not like a movie in which char­acters have names like Flattop, little Face, The Brow and 88 Keys? 
Tron 

Disney pumped a ton of money into this special effects-driven film about computer geeks who enter an electronic world and it shows -kind of. The effects are way outdated and the storyline and act­ing is pretty horrific. but all that overlooks how cool this film once was. The scenes in which characters drive around on a 2D plane on weird, futuristic motorcycles are worth the price ofadmission. The storyline is about some computer who wants to take over the world or something, but it doesn't really matter. All that mat­ters is the crazy 1980s spe­cial effects, which even manage to overshadow Jeff Bridges (who some­how managed to put this film behind him and become a legitimately good actor). The whole thing is kind of goofy, but iftaken on it<> own terms, "Tron" is still as much fun today was it was 20 years ago. 
There are other films I could talk about, like "Flight of the Navigator" or the original "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." Freud once said sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, and, a lot oftimes, nostalgia is simply that-nostalgia. But in these cases, I always wondered why these films don't get more attention. They awoke our sense of wonder as we were able to fly through the sky with jetpacks fighting Nazis, join the world of comic books and actually enter a video game. I loved all ofthese films. 
·while they may not be "good" movies when stacked up against the likes of "Citizen Kane" and "Casablanca," they make me remember better days, and I hope some ofyou remember them too.

MLB-AL 
Detroit's lead drops to half-game With defeat 
Baltimore's Daniel Cabrera takes no-hitter into ninth inning as Orioles take down New York in the Big Apple 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -Kenny Rogers slammed the ball off the rubber and it rose over his head just before he walked off the mound following an awful start. 
The Detroit Tigers will need him to bounce back in the play­offs. 
Rogers was roughed up by the Toronto Blue Jays, who built a seven-run lead before holding off Detroit for an 8-6 victory Thursqay, cutting the Tigers' lead to a half-game in the AL Central. 
The Minnesota Twins had a chance to pull into a tie at home Thursday night against Kansas City. But to win the division and secure home-field advantage next week, the Twins have to move past Detroit (95-64) because they lost the season series. 
Detroit closes the regular sea­son at home with a three-game series against Kansas City. 
"I'm not going to give them a Knute Rockne, 'let's go get 'em' type of thing. I can tell you that right now," manager Jim Leyland said. "If we win three games, we're the champs. That's one break we've got. If we can't take advantage of it, shame on us." 
Rogers, who will likely start Detroit's first playoff game since 1987, gave up seven runs-five earned -on eight hits, a walk and a hit batter. He lasted just 3 2/3 innings, his shortest outing in two months and one of the worst in what has been a stellar season. 
''I'm not going to dwell on it too long. I've done pretty well for a long period of time," Rogers said. 'Td rather have a mediocre to poor one now rather than later." 
The 41-year-old Rogers (17 -7) won seven of his previous 10 starts with a 1.72 ERA and had a chance to match his career high for victories, but it was quickly clear that Thursday would not be his day. 
Toronto's first two batters reached on errors, one by Rogers, to take a 2-0 lead. The Blue Jays added another run in

the second and made it 7-0 in the fourth. 
"He was mixing up his pitches like he usually does," said Gregg Zaun, who scored two runs and had two hits. "But he got some of them up, and fortunately we were able to hit them." 
The Tigers pulled within a run with a three-run seventh, capped by Sean Casey's two-run homer, after scoring two runs in the sixth and one in the fourth. 
Toronto went ahead 8-6 in the eighth on a double-play ground­out. 
When Leyland went to the mound to take the baH from Rogers, the pitcher bounced it in disgust and walked otr the field. 
It was the second straight poor outing by a Detroit starter that led to a Joss. Nate Robertson allowed six runs in 4 2/3 innings Wednesday night, when ihe Tigers lost 7-4. 
''I'm not concerned, but that doesn't make any difference now because those are our guys and I'm very comfortable with them," Leyland said. "If they're good in the playoffs, we'll do OK. If they don't, we won't. 
Baltimore 7, New York 1 
Daniel Cabrera came within two outs of a no-hitter against the Yankees' mighty lineup before Robinson Cano slapped a clean opposite-field single in the ninth inning, and the Baltimore 
Orioles  beat  New  York  
Thursday night.  
Flashing  a  fastball  that  

touched 97 mph, Cabrera over­came three errors behind him and cruised into the ninth with a chance to make history at Yankee Stadium. 
But after Johnny Damon grounded weakly to first, Cano punched an 0-1 delivery to left field for New York's only hit, drawing a roar from the crowd of 54,046 and a pained expres­sion from Cabrera, who turned around to watch the ball and then grimaced. On the very next pitch, Bobby Abreu bounced into a game-ending double play. 
After coming tantalizingly close to Baltimore's first no-hit­ter in 15 years, Cabrera was left with his third career complete game and second this season.

IRVING, Texas -Dallas police have classified Terrell Owens' case as an "accidental overdose," not an attempted suicide, closing their investigation Thursday of the Cowboys receiver's hospitalization. 
Authorities also released a recording of the brief 911 call Thursday that brought rescue workers to Owens' home, in which publicist Kim Etheredge said "I think he took too many pills" but never men­tioned her client's name or said anything about a suicide attempt. 
Police Chief David Kunkle said he had "great confidence" in his offi­cers' initial report, which sairl rescue workers responded late Tuesday night to an attempted "suicide by prescription pain medication." 
"The report, in my opin­ion, reflects what the offi­cers were told and repre­sents their best interpre­tation of what happened," Kunkle said Thursday. "But that doesn't mean it's the definitive account of the incident. Like all these situations, we're dealing with incomplete information and facts that change." 
The report, obtained by media outlets Wednesday, said Etheredge described 
IN BRIEF 

SeekinS! to extend streak,
Woods Teads in England 
CHANDLER'S CROSS, England -The first two weeks in the British Isles have been match play and sour memories for Tiger Woods, whether it was a first­round loss at Wentworth or a resound­ing loss to Europe in the Ryder Cup. 
He returned to stroke play Thursday, and to the top of the leaderboard. 
Woods took advantage of a soft course with slick, smooth greens for his best start of the year, an 8-under 63 capped ofT by an eagle on the last hole that gave him a one-shot lead over Padraig Harrington and Ian Poulter in the American Express Championship. 
"I made a couple of putts and got things rolling and got the momentum on my side, and just kept rolling," Woods said. 
On the 567-yard closing hole, he hammered a driver down the middle and followed with a 3-wood from 267 yards that landed 20 feet from the cup. 
Owens as being depressed and indicated that he said "Yes" when rescue work­ers asked whether he had tried to harm himself. 
Owens said Wednesday he mistakenly mixed the painkillers for a broken hand with supplements he ordinarily takes, causing him to become groggy and incoherent. Etheredge became con­cerned and called 911. 
The 41-second call began politely, with Etheredge saying in an urgent tone, "Hi, I have an emergency please." 
Far from the anger and outrage she showed at a news conference Wednesday, Etheredge 
was a bit panicked but composed enough to say "thank you" before being transferred to a para­medic. She then told the second operator, "Hi. I need an ambulance please, immediately." 
"I think he took too many pills," she said. "Please. Now. What do 1 do if the pills are down the throat?" 
The paramedic instead said they were. on the way and asked if he was still breathing. Told that he was, the paramedic reas­sured Etheredge that res­cue workers were en route. 
"Thank you," she said. "Thank you." 
Charges dropped for sus~t in Duquesne basKetball shooting 
PITTSBURGH -Prosecutors on Thursday dropped charges against one of two men accused of shooting five Duquesne University basketball players, but filed charges against two additional suspects. 
All charges were dropped against Brandon Baynes, 18, of Penn Hills, in the Sept. 17 shooting after an on­campus dance party. 
Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala said Baynes was cleared after a witness recanted her story. He would not identify the wit­ness. 
Zappala also announced charges against two other people: Derek Lee, of Pittsburgh, and Erica H. Sager, of Wilkinsburg. 
Lee, 18, of Pittsburgh, is accused of shooting at the players. He is charged with five counts each of attempted homicide and aggravated assault. 
Nets sign former Duke star 
Williams 3 years after crash 
EAST RUTHERFOHD, N.J. -Three years after a motorcycle accident put his fledgling career in jeopardy, Jay Williams is getting a chance to return to the NBA with the New Jersey Nets. 
Williams signed a contract with the Nets on Thursday, giving him the right to attend training camp and try out for the team. Contract terms were not immediately available, but the deal is not guaranteed. 
"I would love for it to happen here," Williams said. "I pray to God it does. But if it doesn't, I'll have to go from there."With Jason Kidd being the Nets' starting point guard and Marcus \Villiams, the team's first-round draft pick, expected to be his backup. Williams is a bit of a long shot to make thP team. 
"I can stilllpass) the ball and make everyone around me look great, too," Williams said. "I just have to keep working hard."

comebacks as they head to Atlanta to finish the season. 
There weren't many witness­es for their latest victory. There were fewer than 500 in the stands after a rain delay pushed the starting time from 
12:35 p.m. Eastern to 4:01 p.m. -believed to be one of the longest delays to start a game in Pirates history. 
The Pirates probably wished it had kept on raining as they lost their seventh in a row, all against contenders, and were swept for the second series in a row after dropping three last weekend in San Diego. They must sweep three from Cincinnati over the weekend to avoid losing at least 95 games for the second season in a row. 

Houston manager Phil Garner said earlier in the week the Astros' goal was to not lose again -their streak is their longest since a 12-game run in August 2004 -and his players must be listening. 
Adam Everett's single drove in the first run of a three-run fifth notable mostly for rookie left-bander Tom Gorzelanny's wildness -he walked two and hit another batter after retiring the first 13 batters he faced. Houston's only three hits came in the inning, with Chris Burke and Jason Lane also getting sin­gles ahead of Everett's single. Oswalt and Morgan Ensberg walked with the bases loaded to force in the other two runs. 
Oswalt (15-8), winning his sixth in a row and fifth straight this month, didn't need any support after that to beat the Pirates for the third time in three starts, allowing only two runs in 20 innings. He gave up four hits, struck out six and walked two. 
The Pirates' biggest threat came when they loaded the bases in the sixth on singles by . Jack Wilson and Jason Bay and Oswalt hit Ryan Doumit with a pitch, but shortstop Adam Everett threw out Xavier Nady at first by a step on a slow roller for the third out. 
the NL wild-card race and a game behind San Diego in the NL West. Both the Phillies and Padres played later Thursday. 
Getting the start at first base with Nomar Garciaparra deal­ing with sore side and thigh muscles, Loney hit a grand slam in the first, a two-run dou­ble in the third, a run-scoring single in the fifth and a two-run homer in the seventh before striking out in the eighth. 
That tied the club record for RBis set by Gil Hodges for Brooklyn on Oct. 31, 1950, against the Boston Braves. It's the first nine-RBI game in the National League since Sammy Sosa did it at Coors Field on Aug. 10, 2002. 
The wild win was the Dodgers' 15th in 19 games against the Rockies this season. They blew a five-run lead when Colorado scored seven times in the fourth to take a 10-8 lead, but the Dodgers tied it in the fifth and then put together a seven-run rally themselves in the sixth. 
Kenny Lofton (third) and Marlon Anderson (12th) hit back-to-hack homers off Ray King (1-4), and Wilson Betemit added a two-run double off Jose Mesa, who also served up Loney's two-run shot. Lofton came around on an error to make it 17-10. 
Left-bander Mark Hendrickson (2-7), the fourth Dodgers pitcher, picked up the win. He gave up an unearned run on one hit in two innings. 
Dodgers right-hander Brad Penny left the game after one inning with stiffness in his lower back and is day to day, the team said. Penny, who has struggled since the All-Star break, allowed four hits, includ~ ing a three-run home run to Matt Holliday, as the Rockies batted around in the first inning. 
Penny was lifted for a pinch hitter in the top of the second, right after Loney's grand slam off Byung-llyun Kim gave Los Angelns a 4-3 lead.

Saint Mary's travels to Chicago after solid performance last week

performance that teammate Katie White described as a "fantastic race ... [beating] some of the best runners in our conference." Her time helped the Belles fin­ish fifth in the eight team field, but Saint Mary's was just a small point spread of 18 away from third. 
Coach Jackie Bauters was especially pleased with her team's improved mental toughness in the Jamboree but still wanted to focus this week on strategy "with the last half mile of the race, which seemed to be the most difficult 

part of the race for the team." 
Practices this week, captain Meaghan Herbst said, may have made the difference. 
"This week is a little differ­ent since we are doing mile repeats rather than 1OOOs, which will help us build our endurance to sustain our strength for that last mile of the race," she said. 
Last year at the Invitational the Belles placed 18th in the 27-team field, led by perform­ances from current team members Sara Otto (20:50),

The course is one of the team's collec­tive favorites, Herbst said, since it takes a 
route along Lake

"Some goals that I think the whole team should focus on is pushing the hill that we need to run up three times," she said. "The last mile is away from any crowds, which means that it is easy to lose focus so we should work to keep up the momentum."

Close battle ends in loss 
Belles force Bethel College to fifth game but cannot pull out a win 
By SAMANTHA LEONARD 
News Writer 

The Belles had a hard fought match last night, but just could not come through with the win. The team lost in five games to Bethel, 30­26, 19-30. 25-30, 30-22, 12­15. 
Junior Amanda David Setter had 44 assists and 11 digs. 
Anne Cusack Senior Libero led the team in digs with 25 digs. 
In addition to their strong play, Kristen Playko was once again played like a team leader with17 kills, 12 digs and 2 block assists. 
Coach Julie Schroeder-Biek was disappointed with the loss, but did have some encouraging words. 
"This was a well fought match by both teams," she said. "Unfortunately, in the last game of the match, we really beat ourselves by miss­ing 4 serves ... and, in the short game especially, you can't afford those kind of errors. 
She did see improvement in the Belles' play, though. 
"On the whole, I feel better about our play tonight than I do with how we played in our win against Tri-State earlier this week," Shroeder-Biek said. "Tonight, we compet­ed." 
Saint Mary's will take on Albion and Adrian in their second and third conference 
matches of the week tonight, at the Adrian Triangular. Albion has a record of 1-6 in the MIAA Conference with a 6-8 record overall. Adrian will prove to be tougher with a record of 4-2 in the MIAA Conference and 9-6 overall. 
Saint Mary's is tied for third in the conference with Adrian, but anything can happen in the tri-team con­ference match ups. The match against Albion will start at 6 p.m. and will be held at Adrian. At 8 p.m. Saint Mary's will take on 
Adrian. 
Senior outside hitter Kristen Playko believes the Belles are ready to handle the back-to-back games. 
"Intensity and excitement always leads to a better per­formance, and most impor­tantly having fun which always makes playing the game that much better," she said. "We just have to walk into the gym and step on the court ready to play."

No. 12 Irish to compete in McGarity Tourney 
ND Sailing splits squad to compete in two races, teams finish ninth in Neu' York City and second at Iowa Cup 
Special to The Observer 
Men's Water Polo 
This past weekend, the Men's Water Polo Team trav­eled to the University of Dayton for CWPA Great Lakes Conference play. On Saturday, the No. 12 nationally-ranked Irish first squared off against new conference member Ohio. In a very physical, penalty­filled match, the Irish pulled away in the closing minutes, downing the Bobcats 10-7. Senior captain Jon Kelly inspired the team with a very hard-fought, intimidating defensive performance. Captain Patrick Connors led the Irish in scoring with three goals, while captain Stephen Shepard, junior Colin Dunn, and sophomore Tom Fletcher also contributed goals for Notre Dame. 
The afternoon game featured the Irish against their archri­vals, defending national cham­pion and second-ranked Grand Valley State in the battle of the top two seeds. The Lakers jumped to an early advantage, capitalizing on some Irish mis­cues and carried a 3-2 lead into the second quarter. However, thanks to the long range shooting of Shepard and great movement by junior Khaw Zhan Wei, Notre Dame 
jumped in front 5-4 by the middle of the second. During this stretch, goalkeeper Dave Mazur pulled off some out­standing saves to keep the Irish moving ahead. 
Unfortunately, turnovers and penalties were to be the team's ultimate undoing, as some key second half mistakes led to the Irish falling behind, and never really recovering, losing 14-8. 
In the final match of the evening, the Irish faced Ball State. In a game in which the Irish displayed the full extent of their depth, the men pulver­ized the Cardinals, winning 18-6. Sophomores Devin Fee, Joel Thielen, and Mike Mashura all played well in stepping up to fill the starters' roles, by scoring and leading the Irish counterattack. 
On Sunday, Notre Dame's final match saw the club fac­ing the host Flyers of Dayton. While the Irish got an early scare from a t~nacious Dayton team playing in front of a home crowd, the Irish man­aged to dispose of the Flyers with a 12-7 victory. Freshman C r a'i g Bentzen turne d i n a dominant performance on the offensive end, netting several goals, while Dunn, Fletcher, Shepard, and Connors also tal­lied for the Irish. Mazur was solid once again, while senior George Heidkamp and fresh­man Sean Hooney came in and put in two great all-around efforts. 
This upcoming weekend finds Notre Dame traveling to Miami (Ohio} for the Kyle McGarity Memorial Tourney, a twelve-team tournament in which nine of the teams are ranked nationally, including No. 1 Michigan State, No. 2 GVSU, No. 4 Arizona, and No. 10 Texas. The Irish are top­seeded in their bracket with No. 14 Miami and Indiana University. 
Ultimate 
ND Ultimate traveled down to Carbondale, Illinois, last weekend for its first tourna­ment of the year. The team brought an even mix of return­ing players and rookies. Saturday, ND Ultimate split their squad into two balanced teams. Most teams seemed to fight the driving persistent rain on Saturday but both halves of the Irish squad capi­talized taking advantage of a wet supple ground for a plenti­tude of defensive layouts. 
Freshman Brian Nelb and Tom Kenny helped lead Notre Dame Y to an undefeated 4-0 Saturday. The X half had simi­lar success. With strong play from freshman Michael Carilli they kept their opponents to a combined one point while scoring a combined 28 on the day. After losing some players due to schoolwork, ND Ultimate combined to form one squad for elimination Sunday. 
On Sunday the Irish advanced directly to the quar­ter finals against Southern Illinois A due to their strong play on Saturday. The stifling Irish defense never allowed the home team to get in the game. Three of the fifteen points were scored by the all­freshman line, led by strong handling of the disc by Bryan Wein. In the semis, Notre Dame faced Mayfield, the best team the Irish had seen thus far. Freshman Michael Moses came into his own pulling down the disc on offense and on defense helping the Irish secure the game. In the finals, ND Ultimate faced section rival Western Illinois. The game was hotly contested with both teams trying to open up the deep game. The teams took turns trading points up to 6-6 before the Irish pulled away to take an 8-6 lead at the half. Shea continued to lead the squad with strong defense. With their eyes fixed on the trophy the Irish contin­ued to dominate as freshman 
Michael Banning ruled the skies. The Irish wont the game 15-9, icing a combined 10-0 record on the weekend. The club will measure itself against stiffer competition in three weeks at Ohio State. 
Field Hockey 
The field hockey clubs games with Dayton and Ashland were cancelled due to inclement weather. The club currently boasts a 1-0 league record. 
Sailing 
Notre Dame's sailing club split its squad to compete in multiple events this weekend. The Irish placed ninth in the Jesuit School Intersectional, formerly known as the Jesuit Cup Hegatta. Fordham, Georgetown, Providence, Loyola, Holy Cross, and Fairfield were the top finishers in the New York City event. 
The club gave a much stronger showing at the Iowa Cup, finishing second overall to Wisconsin. Miami, Michigan State, Michigan, Iowa State, Illinois, Northwestern, Iowa, Hope, and St. Thomas followed in the 15-team field. Chris May and Ali Donahue raced in the A division's ten races for the Irish, finishing second. Tim O'Brien and Paul Cordes placed fourth in the B division

Runners confident in 51st annual ND Invite 

14 of the nation's top 30 teams on campus for today's big race 
By JAY FITZPATRICK 
Sports Wrirer 
In their second consecutive race at Notre Dame, the Irish are confident in their chances of winning. Unfortunately, 14 top-30 teams are coming to South Bend today to ensure that doesn't happen. 
The Notre Dame Invitadonal, now in its 51st year, will start at 2 p.m. today at the Burke Memorial Golf Course with the women's gold division. The Notre Dame women's varsity team will run at 4:15 p.m., the men's varsity team following at 5 p.m. 
Yesterday's rains will effec­tively slow the racers but could help the Irish, who already have a better lay of the course. 
"It will be a softer ground this week," Notre Dame coach Joe Piane said. "The times should be about what they were at the National Catholic Championship because every­one will be running slower." 
The Irish women are coming off an impressive win two weeks ago when they tied with then-No. 18 Marquette for first in the National Catholic Championship at 28 points. Led by junior Sunni Olding -the overall winner of th<' NCC and only second repeat winner of that event -the Irish have been successful in their two events this season. 
But Notre Dame will face its 

toughest challenge of the sea­
son when it matches up against 
seven top-ranked teams in the 
blue division race, including 
No. 3 Michigan and No. 7 
Illinois. 
Today will also prepare the 

Irish for their more important 
races later in the season. 
Having already squared off and 
performed well against Big 
East foes Marquette and 
Duquesne in the NCC, Notre Dame will get an early crack against some of the best teams in the Great Lakes NCAA Hegional. 
If Notre Dame hopes to advance to the NCAA Championship race later in the season, it will have to finish high in the Big East and NCAA Hegional meets later this year, and having a race now against future opponents will help it prepare. 
For the No. 16 Irish men, there's good reason to look for­ward to this race. The team will insert its top two runners ­Kurt Benninger and Patrick Smyth. 
"When you add those two guys into the lineup you can only get better," Piane said. "There's a reason they are the one and two runners for us this year." 
One main problem the Irish had in their race two weeks ago was their inability to run in a tight pack, something neces­sary to win against opponents like those Notre Dame faces today. While Jake Watson came in second and Brett Adams and Mike Popejoy were able to stay together near the front of the pack, the remainder of the Irish runners were spread out throughout the race. 
"Most of what we've been doing in practice was getting 

the guys to run together," Piane said. "If we can get Smyth and Benninger to do well at the front of the race and have a strong pack behind them, we can be very successful." 
Practice for the Irish this week has also included a lot of tough workouts to ready the team for the competition it will face. Not including Notre Dame, there are 14 top-30 teams in the race, with No. 1 
Wisconsin heading that group. 
"This will be our first big test," Piane said. "We're a little bit thinner than we were last year, but I think we'll do well."

Irish roll into Ann Arbor 
ND will take on Wolverines in a matchup of national powerhouses 

By DEIRDRE KRASULA Spores Writer 
The courts may be slick with the chance of rain, but Notre Dame heads to Ann Arbor today still enjoying the comforts of success. 
The Irish had a strong showing last weekend at their own Torn Fallon Invitational, a four-team tournament that included Notre Dame, Ball State, Purdue and Western Michigan -and head coach Bob Bayliss hopes that suc­cess will earry over against the Wolverines, one of the top five teams in the Big Ten. 
"Michigan has the potential to be one of the top teams in the nation, and we want to be right up there with them," Bayliss said. 
Last weekend, the first day defeated Western Miehigan's of the tournament brought Brady Crosby (No. 94) 4-6, 6­success from both ends for 2, 1-0 (10-7).

"We  had good  prepara­ 

tions," Bayliss said. "Our guys are excited about the season; there's been a great eommitment on their part to excellence." 
The team travels to the Michigan Invitational with plans to further improve its doubles game and its first hit from the baseline. 
"It's been pretty much busi­ness as usual," Bayliss said. "We've been working on our doubles game and our first strike." 
But the team will have to play without Parbhu this weekend, Bayliss said, so that he -like Bass -will not be over his playing date limit for the ITA All-American tourna­ment. Parbhu's doubles part­ner Keckley will have to adjust and work with another Irish player. 
Nothing is set for the Irish yet. Bayliss said the team will see how it plays its singles game and then adjust its dou­bles team accordingly. 
"I want our doubles to stand up to any test we may face," Bayliss said. "Then we can be one of the best teams out there." 
The Irish will take on Michigan, Vanderbilt, Boise State and Western Michigan at the Michigan Invitational.

Belles to fight illness, bunker-laden course 
By REBECCA SLINGER 
Sports Writer 
The Belles will look to over­come illness to place well at the MIAA Jamboree Saturday. It will take place on Blackthorn, their home course. 
Despite being sick, several team members will play in the tournament. However, junior captain Katie O'Brien will be forced to sit out of the tourna­ment for health reasons, a major blow for the Belles. 
Without team leader O'Brien, the team will need to step up and prove it can com­pete at the top level. 
Illness won't be the only obstacle to a strong Saint Mary's showing. The team will also face the distraction of a nearby Notre Dame home football game -but the Belles said that won't deter them. 
"It is fun to attend the games but I will only be able to play in so many college 
tournaments," Katie Mcinerney said. "The team will be focusing on their per­formance -not the football game." 
The Belles' familiarity with the 18-hole course will be an asset, given the difficult 94 bunkers. 
"Every girl on our team has played Blackthorn and knows the ins and outs of that course," Mcinerney said. 
But the Belles know that familiarity doesn't guarantee them a win. Co-captain Alex 
Sei said the ball must be played in regulation, or haz­ards and tight fairways will "easily turn the day into a dif­ficult round." 
The teams to beat this tour­nament will be Saint Mary's toughest competitors, Olivet and Tri-State. Both schools placed above the team's fourth place finish last week­end at Olivet. 
The entire team "·ill com­pete in the Belles' second con­ference tournament of the season. 
Sophomore Perri IIamma and freshmen Theresa Tonyan and Caroline Doubeck will likely enter the tournament as individuals. 
Distractions and difficulties aside, the Belles said they have a solid shot at doing well on Saturday. 
"Blackthorn is a humbling course," Sei said. "But no other team knows it as well as we do."

East leaderboard, however, has not been driving the Irish. 
"At the end of the day, every game is very important," Clark said. "The fact that they're above us adds a little motivation to chip away, but it doesn't change anything." 
The Irish will be led by jun­ior forward Joseph Lapira, who tops the Big East with 11 goals. Lapira scored two goals in the first 11 minutes of Wednesday night's game, helping Notre Dame go on to win 4-0. 
Lapira has played the entire first half in each of the Irish's last two games -something forwards haven't generally done this season -but Clark was not sure that that trend would continue Saturday. 

"Every game takes a differ­ent look," Clark said. "It will depend on the game, the way Joe [Lapira] plays and the way the team plays. This isn't a thing you can decide on Thursday night [before a Saturday game]." 
Seton Hall will look to for­wards Eliseo Giusfredi -who leads the team with six goals -and John Raus, who is tied with Lapira for the Big East lead with four game-winning goals. It will also depend on support from senior goal­keeper Ian Joyce, who was the Big East goalkeeper of the week starting Sept. 15. 
For the Irish, Chris Cahill will again defend the net. Cahill, who has posted four shutouts in his eight games, was not challenged much in any of the last three matehups. Clark, however, is not worried about his senior. 
"The hardest games for goalkeepers are games like the last three, [where] he's had little to do but he's still had to keep his concentra­tion," Clark said. "I think it'll be easier for him once he gets a little more action." 
Ultimately, Clark is confi­dent that the momentum Notre Dame has built the past week will carry into Saturday's contest. 
"Winning is a habit, and losing is a habit," he said. "One of the hardest things to do is break a habit. Hopefully this habit [of winning] will be

Junior co-captain Adrianna Stasiuk was named Big East Player of the Week Monday after she led the Irish in wins

someone gets singled out for player of the week, certain­ly the team is a huge part of that, but defi­nitely it's good for Adrianna and good for the program." 
It was the second-time that Stasiuk earned Player

"Our back four has really solidified," he said. "We've got five or six that play well back there. I feel much better about our defense than I did earlier this season." 
Waldrum attributed part of the defensive improvement to the health of senior captain Kim Lorenzen, who missed most of fall practice with an injury. Another significant asset is the return of sopho­more Carrie Dew, who missed the first few g2.mes of the season while competing with

said. "We've spotted a couple of players that we think are a little weak in the way that they receiver serves." 
It will be the first weekend that the Irish will have only one game to play since the season 
Notre Dame will also host Pittsburgh Sunday at 1 p.m. Waldrum said his team can­not overlook the Panthers (6­2-2, 1-1-1 Big East), despite the big game on Friday.

Waldrum  of  Pittsburgh.

extra game. 
Early season success has not been the case for St. Ed's who lost its starting quarterback, John Brewis, in their season opener and have struggled to get back up to speed. 
"It's been hard because we 
lost our starting QB," St. Ed's 
captain Ge Wang said. "Our 
defense has been playing well. 
We haven't given up a touch­
down in either of our first two 
games." 
Wide receiver Corey Fitzpatrick feels prepared for Sunday's matchup against the Vermin. After failing to capital­ize on a 200-yard guarantee last week due to "poor play calling," Fitzpatrick promises to redeem himself. He said he was spotted outside his dorm room doing a sit up and guar­anteed that he'll double his previous guarantee, accumu­lating 400 yards this week. 
That guarantee could be tough to accomplish on a strong Vermin defense that held Sorin to zero passing yards in a second half that included an interception. However, if Fitzpatrick can capitalize, it could be the turn­ing point for a St. Ed's team that is desperately looking for its first win. 
Knott vs. Sorin 
The Interhall football picture is taking shape as the con­tenders separate themselves from the rest of the pack. 
From here on out, a loss can be crippling. 
That is why Sunday's 3 p.m. game between Knott (1-1) and Sorin (1-1) at Riehle Fields is so pivotal. The winner will take a step closer to the playoffs, but the loser will be stuck on the outside looking in, and will need a lot of help to earn a post-season berth. 
"We were disappointed with 
the result last game, but we 
expect to be sharper this 
week," Juggerknott quarter­
back Justin Beltz said. "This 
week in practice we've been 
working on taking care of the 
ball, having better timing, and 
not giving up the big play." 
One of the key players for the Knott offense will be wide receiver Jeff Skroup, who Beltz says has all of the team's touchdowns this year. 
Meanwhile, Sorin evened up its record last week with a solid 6-0 win over St. Ed's. With all respect to the Stedsmen, this week will pro­vide a much stiffer test to the Otters. However, that did not prevent Sorin captain Pete Lavorini from tossing out a bit of pre-game ballyhoo. 
"I think that everyone knows how good we are," he said. "I don't know a lot about Knott, but they're not that good." 
"One thing that I will say is that we'll definitely be the bet­ter looking team out there, Sunday." 
The Otters may have a hard time maintaining that hand­some image, as they face a stout defense anchored by mid­dle linebacker Kevin Smith. Sorin will be helped by the return of receiver Kevin Tooke, who Lavorini said is coming back from a two-game suspen­sion. 
Defensively, Lavorini says that outside linebacker Chris Petersen will "bring the pain." Beltz, however, feels that his team can have some success against the Otter defense. 
"We've seen their defensive style before," he said. "We've had some injuries this year, but with another week of prepara­tion, we should come out on top." 
Lavorini begged to differ. 
"[We have] the advantage in 
Stanford vs. Keough 
The Stanford Griffins look to 
take advantage of their 
momentum, after a 13-7 win 
over Dillon last weekend, as 
they go head to head with 
Keough this Sunday at 3 p.m. 
at Riehle Fields. 
Stanford hopes to keep up its newly found defense against a struggling Kangaroo team, coming off of a 26-0 loss to O'Neill. 
"Our defense needs to keep doing what we're doing," Griffins quarterback Brian Salvi said. "I think a lot changed at half time against Dillion last week because our defense realized that they weren't playing like they should. Their adjustment came with their attitude. They're a little more angry and playing with a little more intensity, and that's what we need." 
With a win Sunday, Stanford would move to 2-1 and become part of a tight playoff race. 
"Every game from here on out, after our loss to Alumni, is our playoff hopes," Salvi said. "We've got to win every game from now on. We can't expect 2-2 to get us into the playoffs." 
Keough is trying to do any­thing in its power to prevent a showing like last week. With their 0-2 record, the Kangaroos are trying to find a way to win their first game of the season. 
"We've been practicing on our outside contain and our secondary." captain Steve Humphrey said. "We switched up our defense a little bit. Our goal this game is to establish a running game first. We have a pretty solid quarterback so we'll try to air it out as well." 
With the season still much in question, Stanford will try to be more creative on offense. 
"We've been throwing in a 
said. 
Siegfried vs. Fisher 
Sunday's 2 p.m. meeting at 
Riehle Fields between the 
Siegfried Ramblers and the 
Fisher Green Wave will be a 
clash of the unbeaten for the 
top position in the Blue League. 
In addition to that top spot, a 
win could also secure a place 
in the postseason for either 
squad. 
Fisher is coming off a big win in its season opener against last year's champions, the Rabid Bats of Zahm. According to Fisher captain Tom Bupalino, the secret to that vic­tory was winning the battle in the trenches. 
"Our key to success was our offensive line controlling the game," he said. "We really established the line of scrim­mage early. Our defensive line and offensive line handled the game." 
Siegfried is no stranger to victory either, coming out on top against the Juggerknotts of Knott Hall and the Stedsmen of St. Ed's. A solid running game and a defense that has only allowed six points in two games are the two main rea­sons for the Ramblers' early season success. 
However, the Green Wave is prepared for the Ramblers on both sides of the ball. 
"We know they run a compli­cated offense, the wing T, so we just have to communicate and complete our responsibili­ties defensively," Bupalino said. "Their strength is on defense. They have good safeties and a good senior middle linebacker. We've added a few wrinkles to our offense that could exploit different weaknesses in their defense." 
In a game where both teams have already tallied an early season shutout, the opening 

shut them down," said Klein of 
their victory over Alumni. 
He also feels that the cohe­
siveness of the defensive unit is 
crucial for the team's success. 
"The key is that the defense 
plays as a whole, it is not about 
individuals," he said. 
Keenan vs. O'Neill 
Sunday's 1 p.m. showdown between Keenan and O'Neill at Riehle Fields will be a battle of unbeatens. O'Neill (2-0) will look to continue its dominanee after a decisive win over Keough last week. Keenan (1­
0) wants to keep its winning ways alive after an off week. 
Last week, O'Neill exploded on the offensive side of the ball, something of which Keenan is well aware. 
"Our main focus has been our defense this week," Knights captain Matt Gibson said. "We know O'Neill has a good pass­ing game and we have worked on adjusting to their scheme." 
The passing game that Gibson is referring to is led by quarterback Matt Bruggeman and is complemented by a solid running game. O'Neill's focus this season has been on work­ing as a team. 
Angry Mob captain Pat Conley feels that the game is about much more than a single position or player. 
"Every player on our team has a job," he said. "We don't have any stars because if our linemen don't block well, our running backs will have nowhere to go. If our running backs don't hit the correct holes, we won't move the ball down the field and score." 
Keenan looks to be up to the challenge to stop the attack as it has an experienced defense led by senior linebackers Adam Fischer and Alex Staffieri. The defense has confidence after a late goal-line stand in the wan­

Boyer's defensive effort proved of little help when Mooney connected with Meghan Bescher in the end zone two plays later. 
With just under two minutes left in the half Bescher scored her third touchdown. Phoxes' captain Katie Riemersma made the reception in the extra point attempt to put Pangborn up 23-0 at halftime. 
Despite some very creative play-calling by the Shamrocks' offense, McGlinn continued to corning out of the half, but Farley's defensive smothered the Ducks' possession and took a 14-13 lead off a two-point conversion. 


The Finest then ran two interceptions back for touch­downs to seal the lead, going ahead 27-13 before giving up a late touchdown. 
After the interception early in the game, the Finest offense surged down the field, but the Ducks also showed their defensive abilities with a huge goal line stop.

On its final possession McGlinn would convert a first down but time would expire, leaving the Shamrocks with no points on the board. 
"The offense hasn't been coming out strong, so we have focused on the offensive start," Pangborn coach Tom Holder said.

Howard running game, led by Beth Gribble, was able to break through the Farley defense. The touch­down came after a 40-yard pass to a wide-open Duck receiver. The Ducks earned their point after, giving them a small 7-6 advantage. 
Before heading into the half, Howard managed to put up six more points with a touchdown pass to Laura Giezeman. The Ducks held onto their 13-6 lead until the halftime break after a great defensive show­ing, led by junior captain Catherine Krug. 
Farley player Shannon Morrison gave her younger teammates a lot of credit for the team's success. " 
The freshmen really stepped it up this week," she said. "There were four total inter­ceptions, which really pushed the momentum in our favor." 
Howard made a final attempt to come away with the victory. Before the end of the game the Ducks added six to their score with a touchdown pass to Gribble. 
Despite their best efforts, the Ducks ran out of time and ended up losing with a final score of 27-21. 
Krug said she was not dis­couraged by the Howard loss. 
"We played hard tonight," she said. "A couple of plays just didn't go our way, and that made the difference tonight."

The Lewis defense played strong, forcing the Babes to punt on their first two posses­sions. But the Chicks offense was plagued with turnovers, and after a big stop on defense, the Chicks once again lost the ball to a BP intercep­tion. 
With the pressure on them, the Chicks defenders stopped the BP charge after the inter­ception, but they were forced on the field seconds later when another pass was picked off by the tough BP defense. 
This time the Lewis defense was unable to stop the BP charge. Meagher's touchdown pass to Megan Ohlenforst gave the Babes a 12-0 lead at the end of the half. 
In the second half, Lewis was

Meagher was impressed by her team's showing. 
''I'm really excited about the improvements we made tonight," she said. "I hope that we will be able to build on them in the future." 
Despite the loss, Lewis cap­tain Mia de Ia Rosa believes her team will be able to bounce back. 
"We know what we need to work on this week, and we will come out ready to play the next game," she said.

Blank slate 
Irish look to extend shutout streak against West Virginia and Pittsburgh this weekend 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Sports Editor 
An unstoppable force will meet an immovable object tonight at Alumni Field. 

:. At 7:30, No. 6 West Virginia (8-0-2, 2-0-1 Big East) will bring its 3.4 goals per game average to No. 1 Notre Dame (9-0-0, 2-0-0 Big East), who hasn't been scored on in five contests. 

"They're one of the best teams in our conference and they're off to a good start," Irish coach Randy Waldrum

said. "It's going to a go a long way toward determining how the conference turns out this year."

I The Irish, undefeated in their last three games, will kick off a two-game road 
streak Saturday at noon against Seton Hall. The Pirates (7-3-0, 5-1-0 Big East) currently lead the Big East Blue Division. Notre Dame (6-3-2, 4-2-0} is tied with Providence for fourth place with 12 points. 
The Irish have begun to click offensively, and they now lead the Big East in goals, shots and corner kicks with 22, 196 and 79, respec­tively. Defensively, Notre Dame is tied with West Virginia with five shutouts in 11 games. It trails confer­ence leader St. John's by one. 
Those numbers have satis­fied Irish head coach Bobby Clark, who said he is pleased with the way the team has come together. 
"Winning reinforces what we already know -that we are a very good team," he said. "Anyone who plays sport knows confidence is a very big part of ·someone performing, [and] it's a very fragile commodity."

Their most recent prey, McGlinn, fell victim Thursday night on a chilly Riehle West field, 36-0. 
Pangborn hit the ground running, scoring on its first two possessions and converting both point-after attempts. The Phoxes' defense never let the Shamrocks' offense get into a groove, sacking the quarterback on the first play after the Phoxes' second touch­down.

Irish coach focused on preparing for match, not milestone victory 
By KYLE CASSILY Sports Writer 
A victory Saturday over Seton Hall would be No. 500 for Notre Dame coach Debbie Brown, but to her it's just another stop on the schedule. 
"I feel like we're very well 
prepared to play Seton Hall," she said. "I actu­ally haven't thought at all about what ·number win it is. We are prepared to 

go in and Brown have a good match and I'm very much look­ing forward to that." 
The Irish (8-5, 2-0 Big East) will travel to New Jersey for the second straight week to play Seton Hall in the second week­end of both team's conference schedule. The Pirates (9-6, 1-1 Big East) split their opening conference matches with a win over Georgetown and a loss to South Florida. 
And if that SOOth win does come Brown's way, there won't be a celebration afterward.

Time for backfield adjustments 
\\'hen word got out freshman running back James Aldridge wa.; preparing this week with the first-team offense -Notre Dame fans everywhere stopped, gath-.--­ered their thoughts and breathed a collective sigh of relief. 
Because on an offense where sec­ond and eights are more com­mon than second and sixes ­the difference of which can't be emphasized enough -the highly touted, explosive fresh­man might be the solution. 
He al"o might be the key to the rest of Notre Dame's season. 
This is not a knock on Darius Walker -his elusiveness, strength in pass protection and threat he poses on third down make him a highly valuable commodity for the 2006 Irish. But the secret on Brady Quinn is out. And so is the jury on Walker as an every down back for Notre Dame, when the opposition's aim is to limit Quinn. 
Charlie Weis will not admit that Walker is a concern. He has praised the junior through­out the short season. And it's hard to argue against a guy with four Super Bowl rings and a 12-4 college record-espe­cially when the player in ques­tion is third all time at Notre Dame in yards per game (81.8), behind Allen Pickett (89.9) and 
Autry Denson (89.8). 
But let's take a look at some first-quarter numbers in 2006. So far this season, Weis has 
Bob Griffin 
Sports Writer 

called a run on first down 11 times in the first quarter. For a team that stresses the need to create better second-and third­down opportunities, it's difficult to ignore a glaring reality. 
Of those 11 times, the Irish have gained just 25 yards (2.27 per carry). That means Notre Dame is pigeonholed on second down. On second and four, the play-calling possibilities are endless. On second and nine, there is added pressure to avoid a third and long-a situ­ation the Irish have encoun­tered on 6-of-1 0 first-quarter third downs this season. 
These struggles gaining yards on the ground in the first quar­ter have yielded poor overall results. The Irish have scored only 10 first-quarter points this season -three against Penn State and seven against Michigan (on a 3-yard drive). 
What's more, Brady Quinn is 9-of-25 for 51 yards with one touchdown and one interception in the first quarter ofthe three games Notre Dame has trailed after 15 minutes. And how have Notre Dame's opponents done in those situations? They are outscoring the Irish 47-0. 
Notre Dame needs to find a way to gain more yards on frrst down-period. If the Irish can't find a way to do this, they can forget about being a one­loss team heading into USC. 
Without a balance between the run and pass, one that can only be achieved with a legiti­mate early down rushing threat, Notre Dame will contin­ue to play from behind. And with the Irish offense one­dimensional, somebody will fmd a way to beat them -and it will be ugly. 
Enter Aldridge. 
It's an undeniable fact the more explosive a running back is, the quicker he can hit the holes. 
And while Walker excels on cutbacks, draws and screens, Notre Dame needs another option at running back that can be more reliable in creating better situations on second and third downs. 
Sure, James Aldridge might not be the answer. He's a true freshman with no college expe­rience, and Weis would be put­ting a lot on his shoulders by expecting him to bear the responsibility of providing con­si<;tency in an offense that cur­rently can't spell the word. 
But with Travis Thomas roaming the defensive side of the ball, Aldridge is the only current choice to relieve Walker in situations where the freshman's size makes him a better fit. 
The problem Notre Dame faces can't be simply attributed to poor play from the offensive line. Yes, they have committed far too many penalties this sea­son. But thi" Lc:; a group with four seniors and one highly regarded freshman. It's tough to believe they totally forgot how to block. 
Weis said in his press confer­ence Tuesday he does not like coaching with a lack of balance on offense. He acknowledged the run-pass distribution can shift from game to game but also that it's important to achieve a 50/50 breakdown over the course ofthe season. 
Guess what? Through four games, Notre Dame has 269 plays from scrimmage -159 pass plays compared to 110 run plays. Factor in the 25 car­
ries from Quinn, most on 
scrambles, and the figure 
moves closer toward a 175-95· 
distribution. 
Notre Dame has played from behind in three of itc:; four games -that's why it is pass­ing more than it's running. But this would be a moot point if the Irish had a rushing attack that allowed them to control the game from the beginning. 
And if the Irish can't get more than 2.7 yards on first downs running the football, it's not going to happen. 
So getting Aldridge involved Saturday against Purdue could be the best thing that happens to Notre Dame all season. Aldridge might be able to hit the holes Walker has danced behind and give Quinn and Weis a viable chance to get to second and four with a first­down run. 
He could also allow Walker to be a bigger factor in sets where he does not have to pound the football. Imagine how danger­ous Walker's delays and screens could be when he and Aldridge are spelling each other. 
And, ifanything else, it will give Notre Dame a look at what it has for tl1e next four years. 
Weis said Tuesday he is not in the business of making friends ifone player gives the team a better chance of winning. Well, ifAldridge has a breakout first game, the old ball coach will be forced to prove it.

Of faith and football 
An anchor of the Irish offensive line, Ryan Harris has gone from reality show star to freshman All-American to aspiring politician 

By KATE GALES Associare Sports Ediror 
MlV. ESPN. Next up, C-SPAN? 
Notre Dame senior left tackle 
Ryan Harris has started 36 games 
on the Irish offensive line and 
been featured on MTV's "True 
llie" series -but he really wants 
a career in politics. 
It might not be the typical life 
path for a student-athlete, but 
Harris isn't typical. 
He's a devout Muslim at one of 
the nation's most famous Catholic 
universities, where he embraced 
living on campus and being part of 
the Notre Dame community. After 
football, he's thinking about law 
school and politics. 
But right now, he's ready to help the Irish offense get back on track -even though his football career got off to an inauspicious start. 
"I don't know how" to hit 
The Minnesota native remem­bers watching the Minnesota Vikings at family events, sitting alone in front of the television and trying to make sense of the game. Later, he'd go to his father -who played college football at the University of Wisconsin-Stout ­with questions. 
"My first question I tried to fig­ure out was why they always ran into where everybody was, up the middle," he said. "When they were running the ball, why don't they just run around everybody?" 
Over time, he picked up on the nuances of the game. But eighth­grade football brought another humbling moment. 
"I'll never forget the first day we got pads, " l1e sal"d. "I'weryone made fim of me because someone said, 'Hey, let's hit,' and I said, 'No.' And they're like, 'Why not?' and I said, 'I don't know how.' Everyone laughed at me." 
Retelling the story, he even laughs at himself. He can laugh now because, as a standout at Cretin-Durham Hall in St. Paul, Harris starred on the defensive and offensive lines. 
"Especially being a bigger kid when you're younger, you go to a sport where they need bigger peo­ple," said the 6-foot-5, 292­pounder. "It's definitely something you can enjoy and be yourself in." 
He was widely recruited out of high school, but his decisions came down to two schools ­Notre Dame or Miami. 
"For all the reasons that people love Miami, I loved Miami," he said. 
But his family loved Notre Dame, and Harris felt it fit what he wanted in a school. 
"I wanted to come out with a degree that meant something,'' he said. "I also wanted to have the most competitive athletic schedule and environment I could, and Notre Dame-it doesn't get better than that." 
His own celebrity fit club 
Harris was the smallest lineman at Notre Dame when he arrived, and one of the smallest -if not the smallest -lineman recruited in his year. 
That's why, when MTV's "True life" wanted to do a segment on positive weight gain, they called up Cretin-Durham and asked for Harris. 
The segment aired without much fanfare for Harris and his family at home. But when he arrived at Notre Dame, it was clear that more than a few people had seen the show. 
So did his new teammates in South Bend make fun of him? "All the time," he said. "I mean, 
-all the time, especially when I first got here as a freshman. That was the joke, they were calling me names, MTV, 
tory for the Irish and a memorable experience for the true freshman. That was the night Julius Jones broke the school rushing record with 262 yards. 
He played right tackle and start­ed the final eight games of the sea­son for the Irish, becoming only the third true freshman in Notre Dame's history to start for the unit. Rivals.com rewarded him with a

ed to gain 50 pounds to be successful as a col­lege offensive lineman. 
Maybe that's not quite right. He's gained about 17 in the past four years and wa.'i on several pre­season All-American award watch list'>. 
Over the most recent ofl"-season, he focused on strength condition­ing, particularly in his upper body, which he perceived as a weak­ness. 
"I needed to get stronger," he said. "And that's still something I strive for, something I worked on 
all summer, from May until well, I'm still working on it."  - 
On down the line Harris' first  start  was  at  

Pitt'iburgh in 2003 -an upset vic-

most chal­

lenging positions, to protect Irish 
quarterback Brady Quinn's blind 
side. 
"I think there's a lot more expected of you," said Harris about the position. "I expect a lot of myself. I was very humbled because there's so many things that come with being the left tack­h~. so many things that I can take pride in, I just think being there's been real fun for me." 
Offensive linemen are judged by the success of the unit, and most of the facets of the offense depend on how strongly it plays. Harris has embraced the opportunity to excel as an individual and as part of a group. 
"You've got four other guys," he said. "If one of you makes a mis­take, it can cause problems across the board. As a unit, you protect the quarterback -everything starts there. If we don't prote<;t, Brady can't throw to [Jeffl Samardzija or Rhema [McKnight] or anyone else." 
And then there's the running game. 
"If we don't block, Darius [Walker] can't run in the holes and he can't get yards," Harris said. "We really take a lot of pride and onus of responsibility on ourselves, and that's what makes it so spe­cial, to b{~ part of a unit and also being an individual." 
At times, left tackle is a lonely position. Harris often finds himself in om~-on-one situations. 
"Every play I'm going against somebody -and usually it's alone," he said. "There's a lot of responsibility rPsting on my shoul­ders but that's what I love."

Offensive linemen don't usually 
make the stat sheets, but for 
Harris, winning the game means 
that they've done well enough. 

"If we win, we did something right," he said. "Then if Brady's been hit, if Darius doesn't get a lot of yards, those are definitely things that we look at the next day in film and try and correct for the next week in practice." 
As a freshman, Harris' highlight was Jones' record-breaking game against the Panthers. As a sopho­more, he recalls beating Michigan 28-20, and as a junior, nothing compared to the USC and Stanford gan1es. 
"But you think that's it, and then you come out with a game like last week against Michigan State," he said. "It's jlL'it tW(~ry year, it's some­thing phenomenal, and you're like, 'I could not have had that experi­ence anywhere else in the world.'" 
"My own way" 

I larris is far from finished with his football career. But he's already making plans to take what he's learned at Notre Dame out­side the campus. 
He hopes to go into politics or teaching after graduation. 
"I wanted to prove to myself that I could handle the academic rigors of Notre Dame and do both things -I'm not just an athlete," he said. "[There are] so many rivalries, every week, so much exposure, and you're in the classroom the next day. It's the best of both worlds. I'm just very happy I've been able to take advantage of both opportunities." 
Harris will graduate with a dou­

ble major in political science and 
economics -a subject he says 
"just makes sense to me." 
Service work and volunteering are an important part of the time he spends in South Bend, and he said he made lifelong friends as a resident of Siegfried Hall. 
But Harris' Muslim faith is also a central part of who he is. Being at a predominantly Catholic school, he said, doesn't make being Muslim harder. 
"It's easier," he said. "Because people understand the religious component of life, people under­stand that faith is an everyday thing -not something you do just once a week. Being in an environ­ment where they practice faith and appreciate faith and there's so many opportunities for people to exereise their faith really makes it ea.'>y for me to fBel welcome and for me to do the same in my own way." 
From faith to football, Harris has taken on every aspect of his life in his own way. 
Harris has many goals for his life after tllis season and his grad­uation. But wherever he goes, Notre Dame will go with him, he said. 
"The moraL'> and principles that Notre Dame teaches -to be a Notre Dame man," he said. "For me it definitely means someone who is a contributing member to the community and who stands for ethics and good things."

have constantly played from behind. That needs to

change this week. 

At 67-43, Tiller is one of the most successful coaches in Purdue history, but a 5-6 campaign in 2005 has crit­ics howling in West Lafayette. 

The Boilermakers are unbeaten so far this year, but Til1er has to prepare his young team for its first big road test. 
Last year, Boilermakers defensive coordinator Brock Spack was immortalized on ESPN looking confused after a Notre Dame touchdown. 

The Purdue coaching staff has the experience to avoid a similar melt­down. but they have their work cut out for them against Weis' playcalling. 

Do the Irish have anything left in the tank? Last week's emotional win in East Lansing might prime Notre Dame for a letdown ... if USC or Michigan were up next. But Michigan is in the past and USC is far in the future. Right now, the Irish just have to focus on Purdue. And a game with Purdue means Brady Quinn gets to update his Heisman resume against one of the nation's worst pass defenses as the Irish burn the

QUARTERBACKS 
Brady Quinn has started slow in most games this season but generally has improved as games have worn on, especially last week against Michigan State. He's dropped down the Heisman rankings, but he has still thrown for 11 touchdowns and just four interceptions. 
Curtis Painter has com­
pleted 64.1 percent of his 
passes and thrown for 
eight touchdowns and five 
picks in his first full year a'i 
the starter in Tiller's 
spread oflense. 

He is a threat to run, with 
251 yards rushing last year, 
but has only collected 29 
on the ground this season. 
Painter has played well 
as in his first nine games 
as a starter, but Quinn is 
one of the best in the 
country. 

The Irish signal caller torched Purdue for 440 yards through the air last season and can do it again, especially lf he gets off to a fast start.

IRISH PASSING 
With the running game struggling, Notre Dame's passing game has carried the offense this season. Talented wide receivers Rhema McKnight and Jeff Samardzija have combined for eight touchdown catches, while tight end John Carlson is a big target in the middle of the field. 
The Purdue secondary is very inexperienced, start­ing two freshmen and two junior college transfers, none of whom was on campus for spring practice last May. They have strug­gled this season, allowing 
284.8 yards per game and nine touchdowns through the air. 
Quinn had his way with the Purdue secondary last season, and he should do so again. given its lack of experience and the fact that the Irish have the best quarterback and receivers Purdue has seen this year. Spack will need to disguise coverages and try to confuse Quinn.

IRISH RUSHING 
The Notre Dame running game has been a non-fac­tor in most games this year, averaging just 7 4.8 yards per contest. Darius Walker leads the team with 227 yards on the ground. He might get some help with freshman James Aldridge ready to see his first action after being injured. 
The Boilermakers have been decent against the run, allowing 126 yards per game on the ground. 
Linebacker Dan Bick leads the team with 38 tackles and defensive end Anthony Spencer has been in opposing backfields all season, tallying nine tackles for loss.

Purdue is 4-0 but it hasn't played anyone yet. That changes Saturday when Notre Dame formally welcomes them to the 2006 season. The Irish need this one to begin building confidence for the rest of the year. Quinn doesn't disappoint with an efficient 350­yard, 4-TD game.

BOILERS PASSING BOILERS RUSHING 
Notre Dame's pass defense has been much improved over la<;t sea<;On, giving up an average of 181.2 yards per game through the air this year and holding Drew Stanton to 114 yard'> on just 1 0-of-22 completions last week. It will need to play well again this week against Purdue's spread offense.  

Painter has brutalized opposing defenses this year, Ouowing for over 1,100 yards in just four games. Wide receiver Dorien Bryant is fast and agile and torched Notre Dame last year with 14 catches for 12 7 yards and two touchdowns.  

Notre Dame has been susceptible to power backs, giving up big gains to Michigan State's Jehuu Caulcrick and Michigan's Mike Hart. They have also surrendered yards to mobile quarterback.'>, giving up 53 to the Spartans' Drew Stanton and 55 to Georgia Tech's Reggie Ball. 
Junior Kory Sheets and sophomore Jaycen Taylor have split carries at tail­back for the Boilermakers this year and combined for 553 yards. 
Painter has shown in the past that he's a threat to run, although he has only gained 29 yards on 19 car­ries this season.

SPECIAL TEAMS 
Punter Geoff Price has averaged 4 7. 7 yards per kick this season, Tom Zbikowski is a threat to break a punt return every time he touches the ball, and kick returns have been solid. The Irish must avoid special teams turnovers, however, and need more consistency from kicker Carl Gioia. 
Field goal kicker Chris Summers has converted every attempt under 40 yards. Dorien Bryant is averaging 32.6 yards per kick return, but three other players who have returned kicks have averaged just 
13. Royce-Adams has returned six punts for a modest 7 .8-yard average. 
Notre Dame was bitten by the penalty bug last week as a holding call ~on Raeshon McNeil negated Tom Zbikowski's punt return for a touchdown. If the Irish can avoid those simple mistakes, they will have a huge advantage over Purdue on special teams.

PURDUE 
SECONDARY 
The Boilermakers have a lack of experi­ence in their defensive backfield. Two fresh­men and two junior college tranfers start in the secondary, which means this unit has only been playing together since the start of fall practice. 
Purdue has given up 
284.8 yards per game through the air, and Brady Quinn and the Irish are the best pass­ing team they've seen yet. In order for Purdue to win, they will have to slow down Notre Dame's aerial attack and make Darius Walker and the incon­sistent Irish running game take center stage. 
NOTRE DAME PASS OFFENSE 
Brady Quinn has thrown for over 1,000 yards and 11 touch­downs already this season, and he has three big targets to get the ball to -Jeff Samardzija, Rhema McKnight, and John Carlson. 
But Quinn has strug­gled at times this sea­son, especially at the beginning of games. With the Irish running game stuck in neutral, Quinn may to have to carry the offense with his arm once again. 
Against Purdue's high-powered offense, it will be important for Notre Dame to score early and often -and most of the responsi­bilty for that lies on Quinn's shoulders.

But Purdue has shown prob­lems in its first four games in shutting down teams with much less daunting passing games than Notre Dame. After games against Indiana State, Miami (Ohio), Ball State and Minnesota, the Boilermakers have the third worst pass defense in the country. They have surrendered 284.75 yards per game -including 355 to Miami quarterback Mike Kokal -against the 154th toughest schedule in all of Division I. 
But don't tell Notre Dame that. 
"They're a good team," Irish wide· receivers coach Rob Ianello said Tuesday. "The play physical, they play aggres­sive." 
Ianello said the Irish have studied tape of Purdue's first four game just like their usual routine and are focused on the shut-down defensive abilities of Adams, Vinson, Erwin and Scott.. 
Vinson and Scott each have one interception, and Erwin and Adams each have record­ed one pass deflection. 
"These past few weeks, you'll see them change up the defensive schemes depending on the type offense they're going ~gainst," Quinn said. "We've got to be prepared for a lot of different things." 
If Quinn prepares well, it could be a long day for Purdue's defense.

It was a night Purdue would rather forget. 
Underneath the lights in Ross-Ade Stadium last Sept. 29, Irish quarterback Brady Quinn torched the Boilermakers secondary early and often. Notre Dame staked a 41-14 lead after three quar­ters and soundly defeated Purdue in its biggest game of the year. 
Notre Dame scored four touchdowns on the ground, but the story of the game was the Irish passing machine. Quinn had streaks of bril­liance, completing seven and 11 consecutive passes at dif­ferent parts of the game, and
