Aquino issues arrest warrants for two Marcos legislators 
MANILA, Philippines -Presi­dent Conizon Aquino's government issues arrest orders yesterday for two Marcos legislators, now in hiding, who are accused of killing her supporters before and after the Feb. 7 election. 
A government news release said Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile ordered the arrests of Na­tional Assemblymen Arturo Pacificador, an assistant majority leader, and Orlando Dulay. Both went underground when former President Ferdinand Marcos, who had ruled for 20 years, fled to Hawaii on Feb. 26 with his family and retinue. 
In other developments: 
Aquino scheduled her first full Cabinet meeting for tomorrow. On the agenda is a proposal to pro­claim a revolutionary government and dissolve the National Assembly, in which Marcos' New Society Movement holds two-thirds of the seats. 
Exiled leaders of a Moslem separatist rebellion returned to negotiate autonomy for the Moslem minority. The Philippines also is plagued by a communist in­surgency, in which Aquino says she will try to achieve a cease-fire. 
An official U.S. team arrived to spend a week assessing the Aquino government's needs in U.S. military and economic aid. 
Pacificador is wanted in the Feb. 11 assassination of Evelio Javier, Aquino's campaign chairman in the central Philippine province of Anti­que, and also faces murder charges in the deaths of seven of Javier's followers. Javier ran against Pacificador in the 1984 National Assembly election. 
Prosecutors had recommended action against Pacificador while Marcos still was in power, but nothing was done. 
Dulay is sought in a series of kill­ings and kidnappings of Aquino's followers in the northern province ofQuirino.

Reagan's military moves, philosophy considered scary 
"Greetings:" 
-The opening line of the U.S. armed forces draft notice. It seems that every time I turn around, President Reagan is scaring the hell out of me. 
Last month, it happened when he was dedicating the new airstrip in Grenada -you remember, the airstrip begun by the communists, only to be halted by the United States armed forces. The United States finished the work the Grenadan communists began, and the president spoke at the dedication. 
Predictably, he called the overthrow of the tiny Caribbean island a stunning victory for democracy and he remembered and mourned the young American men who were killed in the "battle." And then he said something very disturbing. 
, 
Reagan said the United States' victory over the spread of communism in Grenada was a wonderful thing, and that the situation in that country at the time of his attack reminded him of a similar situation going right now in Nicaragua. And he intimated that a similar reaction could be appropriate. 
Holy smokes. 
Reagan was equally frightening last week when he began an intensive lobbying effort directed at Con­gress to award an additional $100 million in aid to Nicaragua. This aid would include $70 million in direct military assistance for the contra rebels fighting the communist Sandinista government of Daniel 
Ortega. 
Double holy smokes. 
Now get this. Toward the end of last week Pat Buchanan, the president's chief speech writer and number one mouthpiece, wrote a column in the Washington Post claiming that those congressmen who resist the aid package will be held fully responsi­ble by history, a theme Reagan stressed earlier in the week. But Buchanan also said congressmen should support the president on this issue because if they didn't they would be siding with the Sandinista com­munists currently in charge in Nicaragua. 
Deservedly, Washington is up in arms about this. This accusation resonates of the McCarthy-era ac­cusations of the 1950s -still more evidence that we are living in the 1950s. Even conservative Republicans have expressed their anger at this red-baiting. 
Buchanan and his boss don't seem to understand that just because somebody disagrees with their opi­nion they aren't necessarily communists or communist sympathizers. But maybe Buchanan and Reagan understand this all too well. 
In last week's tactics, Reagan attempted to pit patriotic Republicans against the liberal Democrats who were ''unwitting" supporters of the Sandinistas. This week, Reagan has admitted that the fight for the $100 millino will be an uphill battle, and yet a top Reagan aide admitted, "We pretty much accomplished what we set out to do."

If he was trying to further alienate the liberals, turn off more than a few conservatives, and again scare the hell out of me, then he succeeded. 
It should be obvious by now that Reagan wants to go into Nicaragua with American troops and over­throw the government. And because he cannot run for re-election in 1988, it is equally obvious that he would want to start such an action within the next two years, either by congressional declaration of war, or by his ability to temporarily send troops through his ex­ecutive powers. 
That will mean compulsory military drafts, a morally questionable war and massive civil unrest in the streets of the United States. Many people will be killed. Many more will be injured. 
Sound familiar? 
Throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, American armed forces were in Vietnam on a similar crusade to curb the spread of communism. We !sot. We also lost more than 50,000 young American men. That's about the number of people in the Notre Dame stadium when it's sold out. More than 300,000 Americans were wounded. That's about three times the population of South Bend. Wounded bad. 
Reagan and his supporters claim Nicaragua is dif­ferent from Vietnam because "it is only a two days' drive from Harlingen, Texas." I don't think that's a convincing enough argument to ignore the lessons of Vietnam. 
I hope Reagan is haunted by Vietnam's victims 
before he decides to send you and me into his 
nightmare.

By CLIFF STEVENS 
News Staff 
As the bells of Sacred Heart Church sounded at midnight, can­didates armed with posters began their campaigns last night for class offices and for the office of off­campus commissioner. 
Two senior class, two junior class, and nine sophomore class tickets returned the 100-signature petitions required by Ombudsman rules to become official candidates on the March 18 ballot. 
Three candidates likewise qualified for the off-campus com­missioner race. 
Official senior class office tickets running, listed in the order of presi­dent, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer, are Mark Foley, Kevin Daly, Meg McGlinn, and Mike O'Grady; Dave Miklos, Melissa Moody, Fred Nelson, and Ed LaHood.

mitting a petition with 200 signatures before March 14. Run-off elections, if necessary, will be held on March 20. 
The addition of junior class of­
fice ticket to the ballot that did not 
attend the mandatory March 5 can­
didate meeting was related to the 
lack of a districk 2 senate candidate 
ticket, according to Brennan. He 
said the Ombudsman Election 
Committee decided that candidates 
who did not attend could submit 
petitions by the March lO deadline 
and appear on the ballot to prevent 
an entirely write-in ballot for 
district 2 senator. 
"Whatever decision was made 
would have to be consistent and ap­
ply to all races," Brennan said. 
The junior class race previously 
had one ticket. 
Ombudsman Director David 
Stephenitch also said that can­
didates were concerned about 
perceived "gray areas" of election 
rules. After the campaign problems 
last year, "they now know that we 
don't just state these rules for fun," 
he said. 



Candidates for upcoming senate race announced 
By BUD LUEPKE 
StaffReporter 
Just when the posters and the 
platforms of the Student Body 
Presidential campaigns have disap­
peared from campus walls and 
billboards, those for the Student 
Body Senate races have replaced 
them as those campaigns began last 
night at midnight. 
Districts I, 3, and 4 each pit two 
candidates against each other, 
while in districts 2 and 5 there are 
three nominations for the post. 
Ombudsman Elections Officer Tom Brennan said potential senatorial candidates for each of the five districts needed to have a petition of 75 signatures in by 2 
p.m. yesterday in order to receive a nomination to the senate. 
Campaigning ends at midnight next Monday, and the elections will be held the following Tuesday, Brennan said. 
In district one, which includes St. Edward's, Lewis, Holy Cross, Car­roll, Sorin, Walsh, Alumni, and Old College, Patrick Kiernan is running against Brian Holst. 
District 2 consists of Stanford, Keenan, Zahm, Cavanaugh, Breen­Phillips, and Farley, and is con­tested by Tom Vasti, Pete Witty and John Gardiner. 
Dillon, Fisher, Pangborn, Lyons, Morrissey, Badin, and Howard fall into district where An­drew Vierhile goes up against John Bauer. 
Steven Viz and J. Christopher Murphy are competing for the district 4 slot. Planner, Grace, Pas­querilla East and Pasquerilla West make up that district. 
Eileen Hartigan, Fred Pugliano, and Chris Sheedy are the nominees for off campus district representa­tion. 
According to Ombudsman cam­paign rules, each candidate has a $45 campaign spending limit. The rules also stipulate that any write-in candidates must submit a petition of 150 signatures in order to be eligible.

Foreign enrollment at ND increases over past years 
Special to The Observer 
Mention Notre Dame in a foreign country a generation or two ago and chances are the listener would think of a Paris cathedral. Today, the odds are good that he is aware of an American university by that name and might even know so­meone from his country atten­ding the school. 
Enrollment of international students at Notre Dame this year totals 436, a whopping in­crease over last year's 375. They come from 64 countries and the majority are seeking a graduate degree. The 301 graduate stu­dents enrolled this year have a better than two to one margin over the 135 undergraduates. 
Students from China account for half of this increase with their numbers jumping from 23 to 55 this year. Countries with large numbers in previous years, Taiwan and Mexico, are now taking second place to China and Malaysia. 
Another influence was a deci­sion by Margaret Thatcher to tighten the British scholarship programs for overseas students. Malaysians decided to search out other educational oppor­tunities, according to Arthur Grubert, director of Notre Dame's International Student office, and many selected the United States. 
Also, while many countries avoid sponsoring both graduate and undergraduate programs Malaysia is apparently reversing the trend. They are up from two

The recent announcement that Notre Dame would use a $6 million gift from Joan Kroc to begin an International Institute for Peace Studies is expected to open the door for additional numbers from foreign coun­tries. Father Theodore Hesburgh, University president, said he could foresee an ex­change of students from Russia, China and other world powers where serious concern exists for nuclear disarmament. Eastern Europe is presently represented by students . from Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia. 
A graduate degree in business administration is currently the most popular among the post­baccalaureate students. There are 38 M.B.A. candidates, 35 chemistry, 34 physics, 28 elec­trical engineering, 24 economics, 23 mathematics, 15 government, 14 civil engineer­ing, <l;nd 12 each in theology and biology. Others are pursuing studies in law, philosophy, microbiology, English, history, American Studies, metallurgical engineering, modern languages, sociology and music. 
In the undergraduate area, there are 33 seniors, 48 juniors, 26 sophomores and 28 freshmen enrolled at Notre Dame. There are 16 students enrolled in both aerospace and business ad­ministration, followed by 12 finance, 11 electrical engineer­ing, pre-professional studies, ar­chitecture, etc. 




Switek discusses preliminary plans for student government at HPC 
By FRANK LIPO 
News Editor 
Mike Switek, Student Body President-elect, attended last night's Hall Presidents' Council meeting and spoke of some of his preliminary plans for the coming year. 
"Whether we expected it or not, we won .... We're serious about this. We've got a lot of work to do," he said. 
"Our most important priority is a new cabinet," said Switek. He said he and Don Montanaro, student body vice president-elect, will choose both students who have ex­perience in student government and students new to student govern­ment. 
"We want to have fun, but we have a lot of serious ideas," he said. Switek said he will work to eliminate the overlap between stu­dent government and the HPC. He and Montanaro will stay at Notre Dame during spring break to study student government in preparation for the beginning of their terms April 1, he said.

Smith asked the HPC to support the efforts of her committee and asked for additional student feed­back in the future. 
The route of a St. Patrick's Day bus sponsored by Saint Mary's stu­dent government was distributed to hall presidents by Kathleen Juckniess, the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's HPC representative. The bus will travel from LeMans Hall at 8 p.m. March 17 and will make a half-hour circuit. It will stop at the Library Circle, Campus View apartments, Turtle Creek apart­ments, the Goodwill lot near Bridget McGuire's Filling Station, the corner of Howard and St. Louis streets and the corner of Leeland and Rex streets. 
The school bus will make this route every half-hour until 2 a.m. J uckniess said the bus will not be available to students leaving the two campuses, but rather will be available for students returning to the campuses. 
Bill Lytle, Cavanaugh Hall presi­dent, said the Around the Corner Club is sponsoring two bus trip to Chicago on Saturday. One bus will leave at 9:45 a.m. for Chicago and will cost $3. The other bus will leave at 5:30p.m. and will cost $9, which includes a ticket to the Chicago Bulls-Milwaukee Bucks basketball game. 
Lytle said details and tickets are available from the Student Ac­tivities Office. 
A benefit for the Big Brothers/Big Sisters program will be held Sunday from 1 to 3 p.m. at Chippewa Bowl, according to Shawn Sexton. Teams of up to five people can sign up to bowl a free game. Participants are asked to get sponsors to pledge a certain amount of money for each pin, said Sexton. 
A $150 prize will be given to the three top money-raisers, he said. Smaller prizes, such as T-shirts, will be given to other participants. Sexton siad interested students can contact him at 283-2235 or can con­tact their hall president.

the womb. We've seen pictures of it," said Schlafly, a delegate to several Republican National Con­ventions and president of the con­servative group Eagle Forum. 
"It is the function of government to protect life and the unborn baby is life," said Schlafly, adding that she believes 98 percent of women getting abortions do so for reasons of convenience or to avoid damag­ing their career. 
In addition ,to the feminist move­ment's effect on women and abor­tion, Schlafly and Weddington took opposing sides on the role of men and women in the family . 
Schlafly contended that ''there are just millions of us out there who believe in the traditional fami­ly where the husband and father is the breadwinner and the protector and the provider, and where the mother is the full-time homemaker who gives round-the-clock love to her children." 
"I think the traditional family is the plan that offers the most suc­cess and fulfillment for the most number of people," she said. 
Yet, Schlafly said, "I wouldn't want you to think I want everyone to get married .... It just leaves more men for those that do want to get married." 

Weddington, however, said the traditional family was economical­ly unfeasible for most people. She cited several reasons, including the rising costs of housing and college education. 
Sarah Weddington 

As a result of such economic fac­tors, Weddington told those in the audience that most of them would not be living in a traditional family. 
She also said she sees a change in men's and women's attitudes in regard to their role in the family. "I

This includes both women work­ing outside the home and men help­ing with housework and caring for children, she said. 
However, Schlafly said not many

men are willing to share the respon­sibilities involved in housework and caring for children. 
"When you look at the big pic­ture, you are telling the young women a very unrealistic thing if you are telling them that you can have your career and your babies and your husband, and he's going to share 50-50 in the baby's (care) and the housework," she said.

Some of Aquino's advisors want her to proclaim a revolutionary government to make it easier to reform the system Marcos left behind. Others say the action would be superfluous because she clearly gained power through a popular revolution. 
The National Assembly declared Marcos the election victor, which it had the power to do under the con­stitution the former president wrote during martial law in 1973. That proclamation led to the military­civil rebellion that drove him into exile.

More than talent needed to win in the tournament 
"Notre Dame won't make the Sweet Six­teen."-AI McGuire 
This lack of respect for the Irish has been evidenced in the polls throughout the season. Notre Dame defeated DePaul and Marquette in the same week and dropped from 12th to 13th in UPI's coaches' poll. Why oh why are 
r the Irish given no chance to win the NCAA 
r tournament? The answer is coaching. While 
r Richard "Digger" Phelps is a man of integri­
r ty, (one of the few coaches to speak out 
r against recruiting abuses, as well as 
r graduating every four-year player he has 
r 
r 
coached), his ability to win an NCAA title is

questionable. One must examine the Irish season as a whole to discover several unsettling trends in the play of the Irish. These recurring events place a damper on the optimism that the Irish fans are filled with upon every Notre Dame tournament ap­pearance. 
The following facts cannot be denied. 
Confident players win NCAA tournament games. 
Phelps has long been a believer in "scare­tactic" substitutions. Enter Joe Price for Mark Stevenson. Watch Price miss his first open 17-foot jumper. Watch him trot to the bench at the next break in play. Enter Gary Voce. Watch the unseasoned Voce put a 12­foot jumper in off the glass but fail to box­out on the defensive end. Watch him stride to the bench at the next dead ball. Cheer for Scott Hicks as he gives David Rivers a much­needed rest. Watch Hicks try to run the of­fense as the rest of the players stand around. Watch him shuffle to the bench at the next TV time out. Half the Irish players look to the bench whenever they take a chance on the court. Consequently, the only way to play for the Irish .is to be David Rivers, Ken Barlow or to play tentatively and not make any glaring mistakes. Rivers and Barlow are the best players on the team because they play with the knowledge that they can afford to make a few mistakes and not be riding the pine. Phelps stayed with Price at Syracuse (even though Price missed his first shot and traveled his next time with the ball) and Price responded with his best game of the year. One could only be reminded that Phelps said before the game, "Joe Price will come out of retirement. He will have a good game because I say he will have a good game." Ad­vice: stop undermining the confidence that Hicks, Sean Connor and Voce need to make positive contributions in the NCAAs. Either that or pray for Barlow and Rivers to avoid foul trouble. Unfortunately, we all remember how much success the last Notre Dame coach who relied on prayer had. 
Bench coaching is often the decisive factor in tournament success. 
Forty seconds left until halftime, the home team has the ball but the visiting team has made a long run to cut the deficit to five points. "Carolina will hold the ball for the last shot, they won't shoot because they're too well coached." -AI McCuire. The ad­vantage in taking the last shot is to either go up by seven, or at the worst, five at halftime. Notre Dame repeatedly takes a shot with 15 seconds left, giving the opposition a golden opportunity to go into the locker room with invaluable momentum. 

See Gary Voce miss an eight-foot hook, see Dayton cut the lead to five. This is a moral victory for a team that was on the verge of being blown out in the first half. Fortunately, Rivers scored on a magical move to reinstate the Irish lead. Isolated ex­ample? No! This scenario has occurred in about five Irish contests this year. Luckily, Notre Dame has had much more talent than the opposition and was able to overcome a glaring coaching faux pas. However, this bird will not fly in the tournament. If the Irish are fortunate enough to get past Kansas down by five near the end of the half, they cannot afford to take an early shot, allowing Danny Manning to dunk at the buzzer and cut the lead to three. The Irish are going to need every break they can get against talent­laden NCAA tournament opposition. 
Fouling the correct player in the right situation often leads to throat constriction upon free-throw attempts. For example, Bil­ly King of Duke probably should have been fouled 10 to 15 times during the last three minutes of this Irish loss at Duke. The nor­mally fearless Duke fans were strapping on their construction helmets at the thought of King striding to the charity stripe. Instead, he was fouled only once during this crucial time and he proceeded to massage the backboard with an incredibly errant missile. Maybe this ws because he was a 50 percent foul shooter. If one were to play the percen-

P.O.BoxQ 

Switek and Montanaro deserve a fair chance 
Dear Editor: 
In response to Katy Kennelly's letter on what a "Mockery" the elections were, I'd like to say that we all have been and will continue to suffer the consequences of a "childish mentality" -that due to the administration. The administration doesn't take us seriously anyway and no one in the past has gained any great headway with them. What makes you think Jim Domagalski and Laurie Bink would be any different? It is childish of you, Kennelly, to belittle Mike Switek and Don Montanaro simply because they were not who you supported. Why don't you give them a chance? They were elected because, unlike Domagalski and Dink, this is not a move up the political ladder for them -they had no personal gain per se as an incentive. 
They didn't have to brag about their past ac­complishments to win and they are willing to admit their weaknesses. They've already committed themselves to staying here over break to read and learn as much about the system as possible (and if Domagalski is so concerned about us, why doesn't he stay with them and teach them all he knows?) They have a fresh perspective, so stop your temper tantrum and deal with it. 
Pam Reese Farley Hall 


Domagalski and Dink will have time for fun 
Dear Editor: 
I think I can speak for every ''intelligent" and "talented" student at this prestigious university in thanking Kevin Trautner and Katy Kennelly for showing those of us who voted for Switek and Montanaro, the unenlightened majority, the error of our ways. After Trautner and Kennelly whipped, chastised, and implored me, I, like the more than 2,000 other Switek supporters, dragged my bleeding body and apathetic, childish mentality home to ponder the sickening ramifications of my actions. 

I started by browsing through the six-to seven-page platform of the Domagalski/Bink ticket. Suddenly, it came to me. My error was clear. Why couldn't I see before that Domagalski and Bink were the only ticket with the experience and agressive leadership to whip that rascally ad­ministration into shape and crank out those ever-helpful "We the People" newsletters? 
When I finally reached the last page of the Domagalski/Bink campaign manual, there it was. The huge close-up photo of the saviors of the well-liked University's student body. They tried to smile, but their faces showed tages, it would be much more advantageous to foul King as opposed to letting Johnny Dawkins rise to the occaseion, as he is often prone to doing. Jim Valvano of N.C. State (The Irish's probably second round oppo­nent) employed a very similar technique in defeating the Houston Cuogars in the NCAA finals in 1983. Playing Houston straight up would have been a massacre out fouling them down the stretch proved to be the winning formula. Advice: Foul a poor free throw shooter at the end of the game rather than let an All-American beat you. 
"Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it."-Anonymous 
Digger has been a wonderful regular season coach. The Irish have had numerous big upsets and have played well throughout the regular season. The Irish come tourna­ment time? Well, the band is playing a dif­ferent tune. Ever heard of Orlando Woolridge? John Paxson? Kelly Tripucka? Bill Laimbeer? (It is not true that Bill Laimbeer jumped from high school to the NBA) Tracy jackson? Bill Hanzlik? These guys all played for Phelps. In fact, some of these guys played on the same teams. Those teams all exited fairly early from the NCAA tournament. Now it is a few years later, the talent is again present, but the coaching re­mains the same. Prediction: If the coaching rises to the level of the talent, AI McGuire will be eating a lot more than Easter dinner come tournament time.

the strain of the sacrifice. The hollowed eyes ringed by dark circles, the gaunt faces, and gray pallor attested to the time, health and studies given in the service of the students at Notre Dame. 
Needless to say, I wept, along with all the others who fell for those silly posters, the cheese-macaroni, and those healthy, well­rested faces. In our error, we have made a mockery of a vital, respected, and experienc­ed student government. My god, what have we done? 
There is one bright side in all the suffering we have caused by allowing these people, who obviously miss the incredible impor­tance of student government, to hold office. Domagalski and Bink can return to good health, good grades, and maybe even have a little time left over for some fun.

Saint Mary's 


sWimmers are honored 
By ANDREA LaFRENIERE 
Sports Writer 
Four Saint Mary's swimmers were named academic all­Americans last weekend at the NAIA Nationals held at Whitworth College in Spokane, Wash. 
Seniors Anne Cushing and Joyce Murtagh and ju11iors Mary Fisher and Patty Juckniess received the honor, which recognizes both academic and athletic achievement. 
The four were among nine Saint Mary's swimmers who attended the three-day competition, in which 45 schools participated. 
According to Coach Nancy Kuz­mitz, the meet was quite com­petitive, but was successful for the team, nonetheless. 
"I was pleased with out perfor­mance," she said. "All the swim­mers did their best, and we moved up in every event we were seeded. We were up against some pretty strong competition." 
Other achievements for the team at the meet included the perfor­mances by the 200 and 400-yard freestyle relay teams, both of which swam their best times of the season. 
The team of Fisher, Juckniess, Murtagh and Meghan Rafferty swam the 200-yard freestyle relay with a time of I :48.85, while the team of Cushing, Juckniess, Mur­tagh and Rafferty finished the 400­yard freestyle relay in 4:01.14. 
"We were strong in all the relay events," Kuzmitz said. ''Our swim­mers really did well in these events, and they had to contend with some very still competition." 
Another highlight for the team was Rafferty's performance in the 100-yard backstroke event. The sophomore competed the race with a time of I :06.19, her best effort of the season. 
Cushing, the team captain, was pleased with the team results at the meet. 
"It was a successful meet for us," she said. "It gave us the opportuni­ty to compete against some very talented teams and some strong competition."

good weekend for the Irish." It may 
not have been too successful, but 
there may be a light at the end of 
the tunnel for the Irish this coming 
weekend. 
This Friday and Saturday brings 
the Notre Dame indoor track 
season to an end, as members of 
the Irish squad will finish up at the 
NCAA Championships in 
Oklahoma City, Okla. Running for 
the Irish will be the two-mile relay 
team which consists of the four 
finish~rs from Princeton: Tyler, 
McNelis, Nobles and VanWie. 
They will compete in hopes-of be­
ing one of the top collegiate relay 
teams in the country. 
"After this weekend, hopefully 
we will come home all-Americans," 
said McNelis. For the Irish, time 
trials will be Friday afternoon, with 
the finals Saturday night. Then 
they move on to their outdoor track 
season, which ends in June.

ND lacrosse team has high hopes, 
Keys named MVP 

Special to Tbe Observer 

prepares with scrimmage Saturday 
By PETE SKIKO 
Sports Writer 
Experience, depth, enthusiasm and a knowledgeable, veteran head coach are four pretty important elements to any good team. Rich O'Leary knows his 1986 Notre Dame lacrosse team has that and a lot more this year. 
The Irish scrimmage agasint Ashland College this Saturday at Cartier Field, and O'Leary, in his sixth year as head coach, is anxious to see his team in action. If practice is any indication, he won't be disap­pointed. 
"We've worked harder than ever in the off-season this year," said Notre Dame's only head lacrosse coach. "Our team's enthusiasm reaches its peak each practice. In the past, we've often been passive. But with this team's new attitude, we will be more aggressive and more willing to create opportunities rather than waiting for them to be created." 
The Irish are deep with quality players at each position this year and O'Leary is as happy with the attitude of the players as he is with their depth and abilities. 
"It's a very unselfish team this year," said O'Leary, who handled the lacrosse club coaching chores for 10 years prior to Notre Dame's becoming Division I. "Everyone will take turns picking up the slack. We'll be much more balanced this year than we have been in the past two or three. There is no one player that an opponent will be able to key on and shut down, and con­sequently shut down the team." 
Although the Irish lose two key players, Justin Shay and all-time Irish scoring leader Bob Trocchi, they certainly figure to score a lot this year. Returning is the second­leading scorer in Notre Dame history, senior Joe Franklin, who has had 88 goals and 29 assists in his prolific career, including 40 
goals and ll assists last year. He will play at one tack (attack) posi­tion and another will probably be filled by senior co-captain Tom Grote. 
Grote will be moving to tack from midfield this year, where last year he had four goals and eight assists. The battle for the third position appears to be between junior Jim Shields, sophomore Frank O'Brien (who was hurt play­ing hockey but looks to challenge soon), and freshman john Olmstead. 
O'Leary sees the bulk of his depth at the midfield position, where senior Tim Corrigan leads seven returning lettermen back for another year. Corrigan had seven goals and six assists on his way to. selectino as a member of the Great Lakes All-Conference team. 
Sophomore John McNicholas (II goals, five assists last year) and senior Mark Steranka (eight goals) appear sure to play integral roles at midfield this year. Two-year starter Tony Rettino is the team's face-off specialist, winning 53 percent of his face-offs last year. 
Notre Dame women's basketball player Trena Keys has been honored as the North Star Conference's player of the year for the second season in a row. 
Keys, however, wasn't the only member of the Irish to be honored. 
Notre Dame head coach Mary DiStanislao, who coached the team to the NSC title with a 13-1 conference record, was named the NSC's coach of the year. 
Keys, a 6-1 senior forward, broke the Notre Dame career scoring record as she led her squad to a 21-7 overall record and a berth in the women's NIT. 
Joining Keys on the first all-star team is sophomore teammate Sandy Botham, a 6-2 center. Other members included DePaul's Sally Anderson, Detroit's Cassandra Pack and Daphne Smith and Dayton's Michele Kruty. 
Notre Dame's 5-6 guard Mary Gavin was selected to the con­ference's second team. The sophomore was also honored as the player of the week in the NSC for the final week of the season. 
Gavin scored 14 points and dished out five assists, in addition to four steals and five rebounds against Xavier. In the team's final regular-season game, a 66-62 win over Dayton, she scored a career-high l7 points, including a perfect seven-of-seven from the field. Gavin added eight assists in the contest, along with three steals and four rebounds.

Adding depth at midfield will be juniors Kevin Cullinan and Dave O'Neill, as well as sophomres John Burtis an'd Tom Lanahan, who O'Leary thought made great strides from his freshman year. Freshman Dave Kidder, an all-American in high school last year, is also ex­pected to contribute. 
On defense, senior co-captain Mike Rice anchors a solid unit. Rice is a winner of three monograms and was second team all-conference last year. Joining him will be junior Jim Fallon, the only defenseman to score last year, and junior Wally Stack. 
Junior Dick Milone started as a freshman, but broke his leg last year, sitting out the entire cam­paign. He and talented freshmen: Warren Spencer, Kevin O'Connor, Doug Spencer, and Brendan Cahill. These four could serve spot duty throughout the year. 
Matt McQuillan appears to be the leading candidate in goal. The former high school all-American had 118 saves last year and is already fourth on Notre Dame's all­time save list as a sophomore. Sophomore Tom Fredericks should back up McQuillan. 
After their 1 :30 p.m. scrimmage Saturday with Ashland, the Irish will travel to Virginia during spring break for a tough four-game road trip. O'leary is heading into the season confident, but certainly not without some doubts. 
"We know what our potential 
weaknesses could be," said O'Leary, "but with hard work and dedication, I feel we should be a pretty solid team."

f you think your summer plans are go­ing to keep you busy, consider the pro· ject Craig D. Reid, a Ph.D. student in entomology at theUniversity of Illinois, has lined up for himself. Reid, a popular Teaching Assistant at UI, is planning to walk from Ithaca, New York to Los Ange­les to call attention to and raise money for cystic fibrosis research. 
A cystic fibrosis victim himself, Reid, at age 29, has managed so far to survive eight years beyond the life expectancy of 21 for CF patients. Assisted by two friends and a support team in vehicles, Reid will not only walk the 3,000 miles, but will also make numerous public speaking ap· pearances for clubs and civic organiza· tions along the route. 
For information about the walk, or to invite Reid to appear on your campus, write Craig D. Reid, 2064 #BOrchard St., Urbana, IL, 61801.

NCTV will broadcast a live Spring Break show, shot on location in Daytona Beach, Florida. In addition, dur­ing the spring break period, NCTV will present a live concert. 
"New Grooves," their unique music video show featuring groups popular on college radio stations, has an interview lineup which includes Nick Rhodes of Ar· cadia, Kate Bush, Marshall Crenshaw and Chas GrayofWall of Voodoo.

X-rated films were the most profitable screenings for student groups during the past year. 
The proposal had sparked a campus controversy concerning the right of free speech versus the charge that porno­graphic films present negative images of women. Although it decided against the Minority Committee proposal, the SGA announced that it would sponsor a show· ing of "Not a Love Story," a documentary film about the pornography industry.

lie searches out Willie Brown (Joe Seneca), the only living link to that blues giant, and together they head down South. Willie shows the ambitious white hoy that the only way to master the feel of blues is to live like a hluesman. 
"This is what it was like," the 24~year~ old teen idol says, "Waking up in the morning and not knowing where your meals arc coming from and where your family's going and what's happening with your life and then drinking jack Daniels for lunch." 
Even though Seneca has never re~ ceived any formal training in blues, he contends that there is a blues world in him, because of his experiences. 

"I've observed and lived with blues people. I think there are people who are aware of their roots and pay attention to them. They will know that (inherently) they belong to the blues group," Seneca says with conviction. 
Without such intimate contact, a musi­cian can never become a trut-to-his~heart hluesman. "lie's got to have more feeling for the music,·· says Seneca, who played an honest doctor in 11Je Verdict and has gained critical acclaim from a host of stage roks on Broadway. 
A catalyM of the movie is Francis, a 17­year-old gutsy and vibrant runaway, played by _Iamie Gertz who recently starred in Quicksiller. She sparks Eu~ gene's drivt' to succeed and brings out his vulnerability as well. 
The heavily roots· inlluenced music of Crossroads'soundtrack was produced by celebrated slide~guitarist Ry Cooder. Conder stresses that blues music has a sound to which almost evl'ryonc can re~ late. The fundamental qualities of the music, he said, are its simplicity and abili­ty to makl' people feel good. 
Although Director Ifill and his stars arc coy on the subject of how the film's jour~ nL'Y condudes, it is evident that Eugene, the white guitarist with a fervent desire to play the greatest blues ever, adds much more to his life than a mL'rL' song.

hat do Bill Cosby, Pat Ewing, joan Collins, Larry Hagman, Akeem Olajuwon, James Wor­thy, Shelley Long, Johnny Car­son, Cheryl Miller, Michael Jordan, and Michael]. Fox have in common? 
They're all television stars. And in 1986, someone like Walter Berry, Pearl Washington, Brad Daugherty, Kenny Smith, Roy Tarpley or Mark Price will join them after starring in one of the most ex­citing television events this year. 
If you know even a little about basket­ball, you know we're talking about the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) annual college basketball na­tional championship tournament. This yearly celebration has grown from an ob­scure, regional ·:vent into a gala tourney

NCAA Tourna11ent: Hoops and Hoopla 
rivaling the Rose Bowl in impact. 

The NCAA, the governing body for or­ganized college athletics, began its na­tional championship tournament in 1939 with eight teams. When television joined the celebration in 1963, with limited syn­dicated coverage of the tournament, UCLA and its magnificent coach, john Wooden, were creating history with an in­credible run of 10 titles in 12 years. 
llowever, the tourney kept its insular atmosphere, until NBC began telecasting regular season games in 1975. 
"Back when I played in the tourna­ment, it was a personal, localized event," said Billy Packer, CBS' respected college basketball analyst, who played in the tournament in 1962 and 1963 while a guard at Wake Forest. "There was no co­hesiveness in the game because you rare­ly saw any ofthe teams from other pans of the country. And the games didn't have the impact they do today." 
Most experts feel the tournament came ofage in 1979, the year two ofthe greatest collegians in history met in the NCAA fin­als-Earvin "Magic" Johnson of Michi­gan State and Larry Bird of Indiana State. 
Magic was a personable, multi-talented young man with an engaging smile and presence who represemed a big city at­mosphere. Bird, called ''The hick from French Lick" (his hometown in Indiana), was a tireless performer, a magnificem shooter and a hero in mid-America. 
If Magic and Bird gave the event star appeal, a change in the number of teams has given the tourney scope. It has grown from 32 teams in 1975, to 64 this year. 
Television's role in the 1986 tourna­ment will be expansive. CBS will be tele­vising the tournament for the fifth time, and 19 games are scheduled to be tele­vised across the country on the three con­secutive post-season weekends. ESPN, the around-the-clock sports cable chan­nel, will televise 20 through the regional semifinals. 
First-and second-round games will be played at eight different sites March 13 to 
16: Greensboro, North Carolina and Syra­cuse University in the East; Louisiana State and the Charlotte Coliseum in North Carolina in the Southeast; the University of Dayton and the Indianapolis Metro­dome in the Midwest; and Weber State in Ogden, Utah, and the Long Beach Arena in the West. 
The sixteen surviving teams will meet in the regional semifinals and finals March 20-23 at four new sites-the East at the Meadowlands Arena in New Jersey; the Southeast at The Omni in Atlanta; the Midwest at Kemper Arena in Kansas City; and the West at The Summitt in Houston. The four regional winners meet in the Fi­nal Four at Reunion Arena in Dallas March 29 and 31. 



Unlike last year, there is no dominant player like Ewing, and no 1986 team can feel assured of a berth in the Final Four. There are at least a dozen that could walk out of Reunion Arena with the NCAA title on the last day of March. 
The Big East Conference sent three teams to the Final Four a year ago and the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) could match that figure this season. The ACC at one time boasted the top three teams in the nation in the weekly wire-service polls-North Carolina, led by guard Ken­ny Smith and center Brad Daugherty; Georgia Tech, paced by guard Mark Price; and Duke, bolstered by the exciting Da­vid Henderson. 
The Big East boasts the most competi­tive conference in the nation and could send as many as five teams to the playoffs. Syracuse is led by playmaking guard Pearl Washington, St. John's has dominant in­side star Walter Berry, and Georgetown has balanced shooters, David Wingate and Reggie Williams, and coach john Thompson, one of the nation's best. 
Other teams with reasonable hopes for an NCAA title include independents Memphis State and Louisville, Oklahoma and Kansas ofthe Big Eight, Michigan and its star, Roy Tarpley, of the Big Ten, and perennial Southeast Conference power, The University of Kentucky. 
The women's tournament will be held at the University of Kentucky in Lexing­ton. Semifinals are on Friday, March 28, and the final game, on Sunday March 30, will be televised by CBS. 
In women's basketball, look for num­ber one-ranked University of Texas' Lady Longhorns, driven by point guard Kamie Ethridge, and number two Georgia, with 1984 Olympian Teresa Edwards, in the final four. Other teams with a good chance to make it to Lexington are 1983 and 1984 NCAA champion USC, with the incredible Cheryl Miller, Louisiana Tech, Virginia and California State University at Long Beach. USC is a sentimental choice because this is the final year for Miller,

PREVIEW OF SPHIN6 MOVIE 



ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS 
T 
he film set is magic. London, Soho, the 19'i0s, the winking lights of the Club P..mama, the fake f:1cade of the L:1.~t Days of Pompeii, the Patisseric V.1lerie the ren­dezvous of the nightswingers, the cool cats and the disinherited. 
Music pulsates through the sound stage and a vintage Vespa disgorges BigJill, the Wizard and Dean Swift. nebopping along the narrow streets are Mr. Cool, the Mis­ery Kid and the Fabulous Hoplite, while Colin and Suzette, the kading characters of Ah.mlllfe UeRinners, begin their sweet, uncertain romance. It's Guys and Dolls with a Britbh beat. 
The nowI Absolute 1/eginnersby Colin Macinnes was a cult bible of the ''iOs. It is set in the long, hot summer of the Notting !lilt race riots which eventually gave way to the rule busting Swinging Sixties. 
The film, according to director julian Tcmplt', will cover this territory with an unblinkered look. "It was a wonderful time in English history It was a peculiar llowering, an escape route from the so­cial constraints." 
Cast largely with unknowns, Absolute lleginners is counting heavily on its "dream" soundtrack to attract an amli­encc. David Bowie wrote and performed the theme song, and Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Elvis Costello, Sade and I"Jul Weller of The jam are all featured.

nside an immense, cavern-like garage beneath Madison Square Garden, two immortal warriors arc engaged in a fi­nal battle. To end their 400-year-old 
struggle -for a Prize which conveys ulti­mate knowledge and power-one must hehead his enemy. 
Christopher Lambert, who played Tar­zan in Greystoke, is Connor MacLeod, a 16th cemury Scottish clansman. !lis story begins when he survives what should have been a mortal wound in battle with an evil warrior, Kurgan (Clancy Brown, the monster in The Bride). 
lie is visited by a flamboyant adventur­er, Ramirez (Scan Connery), who teaches him that he is one ofa special race of men destined to battle evil-personified in Kurgan through the ages, to a final con­flict at a time called "The Gathering." 
That time is 1986 Manhattan, where Brenda Wyatt (Roxanne Bart), a weapons expert, is busy combing the streets of Manhattan for the cause of numerous bi­zarre headless corpses. She will be drawn into the conflict between MacLeod and Kurgan which will climax in the dark ga­rage beneath New 'rbrk City. 
Visually, Highlander promises to be a feast for the eye, sweeping from historic Scottish castles ami villages to ultra-mod­ern Manhattan. Director Russell Mul­cahy's dynamic style also insures that it will be a feast for action-lovers as well.

AT CLOSE RANGE 
A 
t Close Range, starring Scan Penn and ChristopherWalken, is loose­ly based on events surrounding a family gang, whose spree of mur der, robbery and other crimes terrorized the beautiful rolling countryside of Ches­ter County, Pennsylvania in 1978. 
Producer Elliott l.ewitt brought the idea to writer Nicholas Kazan, who­making no pretense at docudriuna-t:tsh­ioned a compelling script about a crimi­nal father and son. 
Sean Penn, on seeing Nicholas Kazan's script, immediately signed on. Director James Foley, was equally enthusiastic. "The story is incredibly rich," says Foley, "the tapestry of emotion is so layered, so complex and it's set against hard action." 
Brad Whitewood, Jr. (Scan Penn) and his brother Tommy (Christopher Penn) live in debilitating poverty with their mother and grandmother having long ago been deserted by their father, nrad Sr. (Walken). Brad Sr. is involved in crimes ranging from murder to smuggling. 
In an effort to impress his father, and escape his poverty; young Brad organizes his own gang. lie finds it is a passage to nowhere, and the film follows Brad Jr. as he teeters between crime and the law. 
At Close Range features powerful per­formances by Penn, Walken and Mary Stu­art Masterson as Bradjr.'s innocent young girlfriend.

BRAZIL 

T
erry Gilliam doesn't play by Hol­lywood's rules. Brazil goes against the American movie in­dustry grain, from its odd title to its uncompromised ending. It's in keep­ing with Brazil's weird character that the Los Angeles Film Critics named it Best Film of 1985 before it had even been re­leased in this country! 

Lowry feels trapped in "Brazil's" wortd, asort of "1984" as performed by Monty Py1hon. 
Brazil, a curious tale of a dream-struck individual Oonathan Pryce) swallowed by a petty bureaucracy, almost never got to American movie screens. Gilliam, a dream-struck individual if ever there was one, stubbornly refused to go along with Universal Studios' desire to recut Brazil into something more upbeat. The studio, in turn, held up the tilm's release in the United States. 
Petulant, headstrong and completely 
original, Gilliam got his way in the end. 
From his base in England, the veteran of 
"Monty Python's Flying Circus" waged, 
and eventually won, a bitter public battle 
for control of his film. Brazil was finally

released in mid-February. 
To Universal, Gilliam must have seemed like an unruly child-and there's some truth in that view. Gilliam on a film set is like a 10-year-old with a lifetime supply of Lego bricks. During filming in London, Gilliam, 44, bounced around the playground-er, sound stage-with a fifth grader's unquench­able energy and transient enthusiasms. 
To survey the set of his bizarre political fantasy-"Part George Orwell, part Wal­ter Mitty, and at the moment Orwell is in the lead" -Gilliam leaped onto a camera platform and climbed 10 feet up, hand over hand. He gleefully peered from un­der his boyish bangs at the world of Bra­zilbelow. 
The set was the marbled, high-ceil­inged lobby of the Ministry of Informa­tion Retrieval, the ferocious bureaucracy that rules the world. Below, a gang of ter-

Jonathan Pryce plays Sam Lowry, ahumble clerk in the vast Ministry of Information Retrieval, where a clerical error can shatter alife. He escapes his bleak existence by taking flight in his dreams. 
rorists, led by Robert De Niro, were re­hearsing an assault on the Ministry. 
"I generally describe Brazil in a pre­tentious way as a post -Orwellian view ofa pre-Orwellian world," said Gilliam. "That description bores everyone stiff, so they leave me alone." 
"So, what's it about?" he continued. "It's about a dreamer (played by Pryce), who tries to escape from reality. I'llleave it to others to decipher the film." 
Pryce, acclaimed for his portrayal of Hamleton the London stage six years ago and for his role as the villain in Something Wicked This Way Comes, says of Brazil, "It will he like Gilliam's Monty Python cartoons, which, in turn, are exactly like him-the tangible shape of his dreams." 
Gilliam, who hardly ever sheds his sun­ny disposition, nevertheless has some strange dreams. His last film, the interna­tional hit Time Bandits, though ostensi­bly a children's fantasy, eads with the he­ro's parents being burned to a cinder. 
As for the title, Brazil, it seems there was a popular song called "Brazil" in the '30s, with lyrics of the type that rhyme moon and june. For Gilliam, the song suggests the romance craved by dreamers in the cold, cruel world of Brazil. 
Like other former Pythons, Gilliam has worked hard to develop his prankish mentality. "I like things to be a bit crude. I revel in the way things are, not the way

they ought to be. My mind works like a kid's mind, and that's not a pretty sight. Everything I do is done to please myself. That may sound egocentric, hut it's all I know how to do." 
Brazil is "more dangerous than Time Bandits, more like 'rollicking had times,' " Gilliam warns. "Pryce's charac­ter finds that he can't escape reality. He becomes a hero, hut there's a price." 
Gilliam was not delighted with the need to light for his film, once he'd fin­ished it and everyone agreed it worked

very well. ''I'll go down in flames," he vowed, as he orchestrated his campaign. "But I'm not interested in my career in 
Hollywood. I'm interested in this film." 
His relentless zeal and final victory proved that in Hollywood-if not in Bra­zil-once in a while the little guy can win. +

e're entering the third year of the American roots rock move­
ment. As with any new move­
ment, the dust had to settle in order to distinguish the true talents from the poseurs. Standing clearly on the hori­zon of this new musical frontier arc The Long Ryders, a Los Angeles-based quartet whose members hail from all parts of the coumry 
The Long Ryders' latest album, State of the Union, demonstrates an ahlity to play everything---from punk to country---with a skill and grace that compares favorably with the Talking I leads. 
Equally important, the Long Rydcrs possess the savvy 10 combine political in­sight with poetic lyricism. With a little more exposure, The Long Ryders are a gooJ bet for the next great American rock ·n· roll hand. 
We caught up with guitarists/vocalists Sid Griflin and Steve McCarthy as the group was starting a cross-country tour. 
On their sound ... Griffin: "The band is very mixed. We've played with The Circle jerks, and we've played at the P'dlomino (a Los Angeles country & western club), where truck drivers would love to kill kids with purple mohawks. 
"We adjust our sound to where we play. For punk gigs we've said, 'We're not go­ing to play any ballads tonight,' and just played everything slightly faster, and we've gone over fine. I keep waiting for the audilnce that will throw raw eggs and tomatoes, but they never have." McCarthy: ''All the band memhers hring different musical backgrounds and inllu­en~.·cs to the band, and we try to incorpo­rate that into the original compositions we write. I've been playing country music since I W'dS a kid, yet we are definitely influenced by punk. It all kind of works out when we mesh it together. I hate to subscribe to a label, but we arc an Ameri­can roots rock hand, everyone's roots." 
On being musicians ... Grijfiu: "My parents would have much preferred, to say the least, if I had ~one to law school or stayed in Louisville, Kentucky and be· come an insurance saleman. A few years a~o, I asked my Dad, 'Why did you let us play in the basement when you hate rock 'n' roll?' My mothlr hutted in, 'At least we could keep an eye on you.

here the hell are the Reducers? Not around for deadline time, explains their manager Ken Evans-they're off beating the bushes in their native Connecticut, play­ing a benefit not far from their home base of New London. 
And who are the Reducers, you may ask? Though not exactly a household name yet, the four members of the band-guitarists Hugh Birdsall and Peter Detmold, bassist Steve Kaika, and drum­mer Tom Trombley-have been together for seven years. 
The quartet has even issued a single and cut three albums (The Reducers, Let's Go! and Cruise to Nowhere) for the small independent label, Rave On Records. However, to date the group remains little known outside of the East Coast colle­giate bar circuit-
All of this might change for the Reduc­ers. Last summer, College Media]ournal's (CMJ) New Music Report (a "tip sheet" that compiles the playlists of 400 college and alternative radio stations, retail stores and clubs) put out a call for tapes of un­signed American bands_ WCNI-FM, the radio station serving New London's Con­necticut College, sent in the title cut from the Reducers' Let's Go!album. 
Thanks to WCNI-FM's help, Let's Go has netted a spot on a new album, Epic Presents the Unsigned, a unique project which showcases, according to the liner notes, "the ten best unsigned American bands most likely to ..."

If the Reducer's barn­storming, guitar-driven sound gets a "thumbs up," the band could be handed an Epic contract-That's a sure-fire ticket to major-label megabucks and that elu­sive prize, national recognition. 
Nine other uncompromising and ob­scure American groups stand to become the beneficiaries of the CMJ/Epic grass­roots scouting program. Epic Presents the Unsigned uncovers a diversity of styles and sounds, forged by previously unher­alded musicians who have paid heavy dues in their local scenes. 
Some of the bands on Unsigned are well-known outside their locales, but haven't made the breakthrough to the Big Time yet-Minneapolis' Sussman Law­rence Band issued a two-record indepen­dent LP, an Elvis Costello-influenced work that spawned so much record indus­try interest that their presence on Un­signedwas in doubt for a while. 
The New Orleans-based Radiators, composed of seasoned Crescent City vets, have played with such giants as Dr. John and Allen Toussaint. The group has opened for top national acts, toured ex­tensively, and established itself as the town's preeminent bluesy bar band. 
The lesser-known acts on Unsigned prove to be as original as their better-rec­ognized fellows. The top entertainment value on the record is supplied by Blue Sparks from Hell, a six-man outfit from Scranton, Pennsylvania. Their '1\merican jive" a fusion of r&b, swing, Motown, and jazz that the band calls "a cross between the Marx Brothers and Mick Jagger," is heard to hilarious effect on the Coasters­like comedy number "Real Man's Car." 
Hardly less impressive are the SL Paul bar band, The Criminals; Alabama's new wave/pop/rockabilly quartet, The Crime; and Chapel Hill, North Carolina's quirk­pop quintet, the Pressure Boys. The rhythm-and-blues end of the spectrum is covered by Cleveland's super-smooth Vi­sions, while The Rothchilds -actually Toledo, Ohio's Tom Toth-and Connect­icut's Free World represent electronics. 
The Unsigned compilation is more than just a major-league exposition of the American underground's do-it-yourself record-making principle; it's also a unique example of a major label taking a risk on college radio's ability to pick the hitmakers of the future. 
The entire project is the brainchild of one of college media's biggest boosters: Bobby Haber, publisher and editor-in­chief of CM]'s New Music Report. Haber's seven-year-old publication is a widely­read compendium of ultra-hip record in­dustry feedback, culling the hottest spins from 250 taste-making college program­mers from across the country

Do you hear dump trucks roaring through your living room when you watch TV? 
If you hear bullets ricocheting across your living room, turbulent water falls crashing down the stairs when you watch lV, you possibly already have a Teledap­ter. However, if you don't, read on. 
If you have a lV and a stereo system you can enjoy the excitement you've been missing .. nowl· The Teledapter's unique electronics will combine your lV and stereo into a powerful entertainment center that would easily cost thousands of dollars. Imagine having the best front row seats in town for your ball games, musicals, and movies. 
Teledapter works with any lV, VCR, or satellite receiver, regardless of age or model, and conveniently plugs into the auxiliary, tape, or tuner input on any stereo amplifier or receiver system. All lV, satellite, cable, and VCR programs will have the same powerful sound as your stereo system and speakers. 
HOW 
All Teledapters contain Stereo-Plex211 syn~ thesizer circuitry for all mono TV's and VCR's. It transforms their sound into sparkling two<hannel stereo effects. Got a stereo TV or VCR? No problem. Just plug them in (TE-250). Since most lV and cable programming is mono, the Stereo-Plex circuitry will pick up where your stereo TV or VCR stops short. 
Mono sounds, even when played through two speakers, appear to come from one direction-the center. 
Stereo sounds come from two directions. The stereo/mono test is really simple: Plug the Teledapter up, push the mono/stereo but­ton on your stereo. 


When you go from mono to stereo, Jis. ten to the sounds spread out across the room. Perform
I USTENERI 
the test without a Teledapter, and a mono signal will remain in the center. 
l 
The TE-100 Tele­dapter has our Type 1 Stereo-Plex. syn­thesizer circuit. Its one isolated low TE·100 impedance input allows it to be connected directly to the speaker terminals or earphone jack of the lV, and then its left and right outputs are plugged into the left and right inputs on the stereo. The isolated input provides total chassis isolation between the TV and stereo for complete protection of both components. The TV and stereo may be located any distance apart. 
BElTER 
The TE-200 has all of the same qualities of the TE-100, plus a Type 2 Stereo-Plex synthesizer that gives more defined stereo separation; plus a high impedance input that allows the TE-200 to be connected directly off your VCR audio output, which is convenient if your TV doesn't have any outputs; plus an output level control for optimum level adjustment of the audio signal. 

BEST 
The TE-250 has all of the qualities of both the TE-100 and TE-200, plus a Type 3 Stereo-Plex111 synthesizer for even greater defined separation; plus the latest integrated circuit design; plus stereo inputs that allow this unit to be used with a stereo, VCR, or TV; plus a bypass fea­ture allowing the synthesizer to be cut off, allowing a stereo source to pass through; plus multiple inputs that expand the input capabilities of your stereo; plus a tape monitor loop that allows the TE-250 to be used with everything coming through your stereo-AM, tapes, records, etc.

TEN BEST UNSIGNED BANDS 
(Continued from previous page) radio 
stations," Haber says. " We tried to take 
and collate their interest and informa­
tion." 
Haber took his idea of an album of un­
signed bands to Epic Records in New 
York, where he found an interested lis­
tener in Frank Rand, Vice President of Na­
tional A&R-the executive charged with 
overseeing signings. 
"There are kids making tapes who are 
unaware of how to get them to A&R peo­
ple," Rand says. ''And college program­
mers are around music all the time-they 
know what kids want to hear." 
Given the go-ahead by Epic, CMJ solic­
ited college programmers in July, ulti­
mately receiving 275 tapes (during sum­
mer breakI) .The final cut to ten tracks was 
made by CMJ and Epic staff members in 
one marathon, all-night listening session. 
Epic Presents the Unsigned, has been 
received so favorably by Epic, that anoth­
er compilation is being discussed for later 
in 1986. A postcard mail-in will again de­
termine the public's choice for best un­
signed band, and the results would be an­
nounced at CM]'s annual awards 
ceremony in New York. 
"CMJ is really achieving its goal," says 
Evans. "The alternative network is a fo-



rum for new music-a way for some fresh air to slip in." 
With albums like Unsigned available in record bins everywhere, a mere tapping at the gate may now be enough to make today's Podunk pub-rocker, tomorrow's All-American guitar hero.
