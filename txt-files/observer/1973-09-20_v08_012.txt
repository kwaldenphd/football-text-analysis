College drinking rules compared 
by David Kaminski Staff Reporter 
At a time when university ad­ministrators at Notre Dame are concentratinmg on enforcement of party and drinking regulations, an important perspective is that of other campuses in the state of Indiana, all of which fall under the same 21 year-old drinking Jaws. 
Indiana University conducted a 
survey last school year when the 18 
year-old drinking Jaw was before 
the Indiana General Assembly. 
Out of 17 colleges and universities 
that responded, only one, Notre 
Dame, stated that it allowed un­
dergraduates to drink in their 
private rooms, regardless of the 
age of the student. 
At the major state schools of 
Indiana, undergraduate possession 
or use of alcohol is entirely banned. 
Associate Dean of students 
Virginia Rogers of Indiana 
University, Bllomington, states 
that campus drinking rule as 
follows: 
"Possession, use, or sale of 
alcohol on any university property 
is contrary to law." 
"The only places on campus 
where the use of alcohol is per­
mitted," continues Rogers, "are in 
graduate housing, married student 
housing, and special housing 
for students 21 years or 01aer :· 
Purdue University in West 
Lafayette also bans alcohol on 
campus, except in the case of 
graduate or married students' 
housing. Fraternity and sorority 
houses on campus also must agree 
to ban alcohol. 
But Purdue Dean of students 
Steve Akers candidly doubts 
whether everyone always follows 
the rules. 
The fraternities and sororities, in order to keep their status of recognition by the university, have to accept some of our rules, one of which is the ban on alcohol. It would be safe to say, however, that there is drinking in the fraternity and sorority houses," Dean Akers says. 
In the dormitories on campus, enforcement of the rule is more strict. Violations are handled by hall judicial boards, with the first offense usually being a warning. 
"Students very seldom go beyond the first offense," Akers says. "Either they quit or they become more cool about the situation." 
"There is more drinking today than there used to be. I guess that's obvious by the society we're living in today," concludes Akers. 
St. Joseph College in Renselaer, Indiana, allows students, 21 years and older, to drink in their rooms and at social functions. 
"The drinking rule at St. Joseph's doesn't present a problem," says Jerome Hughes, dean of students. the students realize it's a privlege to drink on campus and they work hard to protect it. The drinking rules are really not a cause of discontent. 
The students at St. Joseph's are 
talking about setting up pubs on 
campus in event Indiana law 
changes to allow 18 year-old 
drinking. But as the law stands, 
those plans are still only talk. 
If Indiana does change the 
drinking age, four of the schools 
surveyed by Indiana University 
plan to consider a change in 
alcohol regulatigns. They in­
clude: Ball Etate University, 
Muncie; Tri-State College, 
Angola; Marian College, In­
dianapolis; and Valparaiso 
University, Valparaiso, which 
iptends to establish two draft beer 
pubs on campus if the law changes. 
In contrast to Indiana, Michigan provided. At other social functions is well into its second year as an 18 on campus, the custom is to "bringyear-old drinking state. your own." 
At Michigan State, regulations The University of Michigan at permit drinking in the dormitories Ann Arbor also allows drinking in by any student. In addition, private rooms. recognized clubs and organizations "In fact," says Associate can sponsor social functions for Director of University Housing

boycott

Chavez· represents," wrote Er­nest Campbell, chairman of the 
N.Y. Intertaltn Committee to Aid Migrant Farmworkers. 
Such a boycott is being organized on campus by Dillen Sneid. Under her leadership, a boycott com­mittee, affiliated with Campus Ministry, has been formed. 
Tuesday night, her committee met with the Hall Presidents' Council to discuss the Gallo Wine situation. As a result, letters will soon be sent to the student body proposing a campus wide boycott of Gallo Wine products. Non-union lettuce, and grapes. Meetings will be held in each hal! to enlist the support of concerned students. "What we accomplish depends entirely upon the interest of the students," said Miss Sneid. 
Students Body President, Dennis Etienne, stands fully in support of the boycott. "When the grape growers contracts ran out with UFW, they signed 'sweetheart' contracts with the Teamsters. Since oru main purchase of grapes is wine, the Gallo boycott is the best way to effectively show our displeasure."

Who's in charge of the Darkroom in the basement of the Student Center this year? 
The manager of th Darkroom for this semester as well as next is Joe Raymond and you can reach him at 8003 if you have any questions co cerning Darkroom use of facilities availabl to students. 
How can I get one ticket for the Northwestern game for a griend who's dropped in on me unexpectedly? 
There is no sure way to get a football ticket for the game in question. However, you might try the ACC Ticket Office which is always pretty good about helping students in a fix. If this proves to be a dead end, you might try putting up a few signs with the number of tickets you need as well as your name and number in such places as th Huddle and the Dining Halls. Lastly, you might place an ad in The Observer or attempt to find a friend who knows a good hearted football player who has an extra ticket. 
What's the deal with Purdue game tickets• Has an)'One set aside any for student use? 
Sorry to say, the work is that there are no tickets presently available. This is the picture as drawn by both the Student Union Director and the ACC Ticket Manager. It seems that Student Union was either forgotten or not given priority status when it came to securing Purdue game tickets. When those involved finally got there signals straight, there wasn't a ticket to be had not even across the ticket counter down at Purdue. Therefore, Notre Dame's only definite sup­porters at the game a week from Saturday will be its honored Alumni. 
Who can I talk to about tutoring? I mean the type where guys help out local kids in the evening. 
Your best bet is to get in touch with either Mike Mohrman at 7887 an or Mary Ann McCarthy at 5731. These two individuals can get you squared away about the tutoring program for South Bend kids. By the way, the name of the organization is The Neighborhood Study Help Program.

Due to an administrative mix-up 
the long-awaited new plaids for 
Notre Dame's famous Irish Guard 
will not be worn by the members at 
Saturday's opening game with 
Northwestern University. 
According to Father Jerome J. Wilson, C.S.C., vice-president for business affairs, the new plaids designed especially for the Guard were ordered some time ago. The initial run of material was 500 yards, and, according to Fr. Wilson, a mix-up occurred between himself and Robert O'Brien, director of the N.D. Marching Band. Apparently, Fr. Wilson authorized the manufacture of sport jackets from this run, unaware that the Guard plaids were unmade. 
These jackets are now on sale in the bookstore. This is the only place in the world where the Notre Dame Plaid is available. They are on sale exclusively to students, faculty, administration and alumni of Notre Dame. 
If the coats becom popular, says Mr. O'Brien, additional runs of the material will be made. This will enable the Irish Guard to wear the kilt they have been anticipating for so long. 
· O'Brien spent many months trying to come up with an original pattern for the Guard. His final design was to be copyrighted. Although initial attempts in this action were unsuccessful, sub­sequent legal action secured copyright. 
The Guard is captained by Frank Murnane, from River Forest, Illinois. Each member must be at

THE OBSERUER 
AN INDEPENDENT STUDENT NEWSPAPER 
Art Ferranti Executive Editor 
Lee Gentine Business Manager 

SLC &Parties 
Dennis Etienne's suggested revtstons to the parties regulations that are now being discussed in the Student Life Council are a step in the right direction. 
The suggestions, though they are not that substantial, nonetheless are significant and produce a little more leeway in the regulations besides presenting a less ominous tone. 
Etienne'ssuggestionsinclude a move to make the noise clause dependent upon the hour and a second clause that allows parties in adjoining rooms or rooms in a general area with the permissions of the residents of that area. 
These seem to follow the spirit of the central staff's suggested regulations. The emphasis here is not on alcohol, but on providing the best social atmosphere within the spirit of the new rules. Students must be allowed to have the party as an outlet and to remove parties that are too big for a single room from the hall would be a real tragedy. 
If a group of students from a few ad­joining rooms care to have their friends to their home for some socializing, they should be allowed to do it and not be forced from their home to an alien en­vironment. Likewise students who wish to study in their home must not be forced elsewhere. There is the importance of clearing the party with neighbors. 
It is quite clear that larger parties should be removed to an area that is more suited for large gatherings. 
The noise factor is also to be con­sidered. It is implausible to think that a private gathering in someone's room 

An Apology In Taste 
An ad which appeared in the special football weekend supplement of The Observer proved as much a surprise to the staff of the newspaper as it did to all the readers. The tasteless and offensive ad shocked us also. 
The supplement was a production of Co-operative Publishing Co. in Mishawaka, the firm that prints The Observer Monday through Friday mornings. They sold the ads, prepared the copy and printed the supplement. Then the supplement was inserted into The Observer per the arrangement that was made with the firm. 
Negligence on my part is The Ob­serrver's plea. I should have checked tte insert before allowing it to be added to the Wednesday edition of the paper. That check was not made however and the the tasteless ad was allowed to run.

could not be heard at all in the hallway. But that kind of noise would not be as offensive at 10 p.m. on a Saturday evening as it would be at 4 a.m. the next morning. 
Often, the noise of a party is not as disturbing as the noise that emenates from a basketball game in the hallway or someone constructing a book case in that same hallway. Yet, we are not about to legislate against that kind of noise. 
Good Suggestions 
The Central staff's revisions to the student manual as they stand are ex­tremely vague. Though good in principal, they should be explained further and Etienne's revisions seem to make them more precise. 
For the Weekend 
The situation for this weekend, however, is still uncertain. Schlaver said that students should not be paranoid and Macheca said that exceptions may be made. So, the implication seems to be­go ahead with your plans. But the spirit of the new regula lions also brings another implication-keep it in order. 
What that means, is be a little more considerate of the people in the dorm. Try and keep the noise at a minimal level and the party in some kind of order. At least that seems to be where it stands for this weekend. 
Jerry Lutkus 
The apologies of the editor and the staff of Th Observer are offered to all readers. The supplement has been cancelled and will not appear before the football weekends in The Observer. The questionalbe ads, the quality of the insert and the worth to the students of the supplement are the reasons behind the decision.

An Open Letter 

bill sahn 
Richard Nixon 
1600 Pennsylvania Ave. 
Washington, D.C. 
Dear Dick, 
Over the summer, I noticed that a list of yours somehow became 
public. A list of enemies, that is. AI also noticed that you neglected 
my name. Now, Dick, I am very hurt. After all, I believe in far out 
radical things like honest men in Government and basic rights which 
belong to all men. I assure you that if I made out a list of enemies, 
your name would be included among the leaders. 
As for Watergate and your self-proclaimed innocence. First of all, it 
has been proven that several men working for you in official 
capacities and parts of the Committee to Re-Elect the Presdident 
were greatly involved in certain illegal bugging activities. 
Then there is the case of the Daniel Ellsberg tl'ial. For evidence 
may I quote from a Time magazine summary of the evidence heard by 
Senator Ervin's committee. Under the heading "Overtures to Judge 
Byrne," it reads: 
"Undisputed/acts." Shortly before the Ellsberg case was expected to go to the jury, Nixon told Erlichmann to find out whether Judge Byrne would be interested in a possible appointment as F.B.I. director. Erlichmann twice met briefly in California with the judge to discuss this. Nixon also briefly met him. 
"Weight of evidence." Any approach to a sitting judge by Govern­ment officials who have an obvious interest in wanting the Government's case to prevail is wholly improper. If a private citizen made a similar move, he could be prosecuted. 
''What did Nixon know?" He ordered the contact made. 

Well, what do you have to say to that, Dick? Don Corleone couldn't have done a better job. It is obvious that you are in the wrong line of work. 
It is my understanding that men who break the law are called criminals. One of your predecessors, John F. Kennedy, brought the best men in the country to help run the government. Learn from history. 
When I was z young boy, Jimminey Cricket told me, "Let your conscience be your guide." What are you going to try him for? Has his psychiatrist's office been burglarized? 
I see one bright spot in the mess. The eavesdroppers were caught. Sen. Ervin's committee is looking for the truth. Justice may be an old girl but she is not dead yet. 
On the tapes, may I use a bit of logic to make my point: 1). If the tapes would vindicate you, you would have released them long before anyone knew about them. 2). If they would not hurt you, you would not mind releasing them to Judge Sirica. 
As for your hiding behind "Executive privilege", may I quote to you the words of a Republican president, Theodore Roosevelt, who said "No man is above the law, while no man is below it." 
As a student who is considering trying to get into law school, you have done much to dissuade me from it. However, I still believe in our legal system, and still intend to work within it as Archibald Cox is now 
doing. Yours in Notre Dame, William S. Sohn

Goldwater discusses dilemna 
NEW YORK (UPil -Sen. Barry Goldwater said Wednes­day he believed Vice-President Agnew "would seriously consid­er resignation if he were indicted." 
The Arizona Republican, who said he considers himself a "close friend" of the vice­president, also squelched re­ports that he was the "senior Republican" who said Agnew would resign, possibly this week. 
"I don't think the vice­president should resign," Gold­water said. "Let them (the grand jury) bring out charges ... then we'll see." 
However, Goldwater said, "I would suspect that the Vice President would seriously con­
sider resignation, if he were indicted.'' 
Asked by newsmen if he "detected" efforts by the White House to "ease Agnew out", Goldwater said, "I don't detect this but if I wanted to write a scenario involving a way to get rid of any man in public life ... I think this present scenario would lend itself to that." 
Speaking to newsmen before 
addressing a monthly meeting 
of the Wings Club, Goldwater 
said that if Agnew did step 
down, he would favor California 
Gov. Ronald Reagan to fill the 
post. 
He quickly added however, 
"you have to discount Reagan ... 
(he has) told me on several 
occasions he does not want another elective office -but that can change. Knowing Ronnie, he changes like the California winds." 

He said he would not oppose either former Secretary of the Treasury John B. Connally or New York Gov. Nelson Rock­efeller as possible successors to Agnew. 
"I think Mr. Connally would be a very fine choice; Rockefeller is moving to the right so that he's much more acceptable than he was at one tfme. And he's very, very strong on foreign policy, which I think is a most important attribute." 
Citing his age, Goldwater 
ruled himself out as a possible 
successor, saying that any vice-
SMC encourages British culture 
In order to encourage and direct students interested in various aspects of British culture, a cer­tificate in British Studies will be awarded upon the successful completion of fifteen semester credit hours in this in­terdisciplinary program at Saint Mary's. 
Students will concentrate upon two of the following periods in British history: Medieval Britain, the Tudor Age, the Stuart Age, the Hanoverian Age, the Victorian Age, and Modern Britain. Program director Anthony Black, Professor of History, will be responsible for arranging in­dividual research or study programs within the two periods chosen by the student, and coor­dinating the participant's program with the various participating departments. The program will vary with the individual interests of the student. 
Required courses in the program are History 333 and 334 (6 credits), as well as six credits from among any of the following English courses: 301,302,306,307,308,309, 310, 311, 313, 314, 351, 357, 358, 359, 395, and 396. Students may com­plete requirements for the cer­tificate from among any of the following courses.

Who is Anne Green. anyway?? 
Remember Freshman year'? Remember the shaving cream on the telephone'? Remember swit­ching the Fredy's door with the bathroom door'? 
Practical jokes have long bet:n a tradition on college campuses. Everything from rebuilding a Volkswagon in someone's single room to pouring a block of solid concrete in front of someone's door have sprung from the imaginations of college students. 
Yesterday, the ultimate in 

practica jokes was executed. The name and face of Anne Green, a junior at Saint Mary's, appeared 500 times all over the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's campuses. Posters were also seen at Nickies and "The Library." 
When asked if she was having a happy day Anne Green said, "I'm having a lousy day." 
Apparently engaged in. a long, friendly feud, Anne and her former Le Mans Tower roommates have tried to out-do each others' practical jokes. Anne cited a fireho~e fight as typical of their amusements these past three years. 
Commenting on what she thought was the reason for the joke, Anne said, "I attribute it (the practical joke) to the unhappy childhoods of my friends." She went on to say, "But I'm planning something really big to retaliate." 
The posters were put up by a group of Dillon Hall men. When asked for a specific reason for the joke they admitted their friendship for Anne. 
The leader's comment for publication was, "Anne Green is a
.. 
warm and friendly person. I merely wanted to share this feeling with the rest of the campus. As a member of the recently formed committee for more meaningful student life, I hope to continue to spread good cheer and stamp out boorish behavior throughout the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's com­munity." 


They say you can't con a con­artist and youcan't fool a prankster, but some people have to keep trying. How big this feud will become is anyone's guess. 
Take this incident as a warning, however. Next time you call

presidential choice should be a likely Presidential candidate for 1976. A short time later, Connally, who was in New York to address the Jamaica Industrial Development Corp., repeatedly refused to answer newsmen's questions about the Agnew 
affair, or the possibility of his succeeding the vice president. 
"I'm not compelled to re­spond at any particular mo­ment in time to every issue in the world, and I think it's basically unfair for people to go around commenting about something they don't know anything about," Connally said.
