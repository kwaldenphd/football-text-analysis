Obamafuels debate, gives speech to well-wishers 
Denwcratic nominee Jwlds political rally at Washington High School 
By BILL BRINK News Ediror 
Illinois Senator and Democratic presi­dential nominee Barack Obama told sup­porters Wednesday at Washington High School in South Bend that changing par­ties in the White House will not suffice, outlined his plan for drastic alterations and gained an endorsement along the way. 
South Bend Mayor Stephen Luecke, pre­ceding Obama, endorsed the Senator to raucous approval from Obama support­ers. 
"Let's not hold the surprise," he said. 

Obama, who entered the packed gym­nasium with U2 playing in the back­ground, received a huge response when he asked how many Notre Dame students

Panel, students discuss race relations, campaign issues atforum 
By EMMA DRISCOLL News Writer 
Prompted by Senator Barack Obama's speech on race delivered on March 18 in Philadelphia, members of both the Notre Dame and South Bend communities gathered to discuss race issues at "Evaluating Barack Obama's Speech on Race: A Town Hall Meeting on Race Relations in America" in the McKenna Hall Auditorium Wednesday. 
Moderator and Chair of the Department of Mricana Studies Richard Pierce, Ph.D., said that the meeting would be to "discuss race openly and in public." 
Instead of directly analyzing the text of Obama's speech, Pierce and panel members sought to address greater issues of race and its implications in American society. 
"We must resist the temptation to deconstruct Obama's speech as ifit was a document in class,"

NDSP makes arrest for reported·burglaries 
Two 1nen questioned about stolen cell phone, laptop; incidents not necessarily related to recent thefts in residence halls 
By BILL BRINK News Ediror 
Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP} arrested one man and questioned another in rela­tion to reports of burglary and suspicious activity on campus Tuesday, a statement released by NDSP reported. 
NDSP assistant director Dave Chapman said in a phone interview that it is not known whether the incidents are related to the recent bur­
glaries in Lyons and Howard Halls. 
Around 10:50 a.m. Tuesday, the statement said, a call to NDSP reported that a man may have stolen a cell phone from an office in Stepan Chemistry center. The caller lost sight of the suspect, the statement said, and did not know if he left the building. NDSP officers searched the area and eventually stopped the suspect as he left the building. He had a laptop computer under his shirt that belonged to a professor, the statement said, and the pro­fessor later identified the lap­top. The suspect was arrested for burglary and taken to the NDSP building, and later to the St. Joseph's County Jail. 
Two other cell phones and another laptop were still missing, the statement said. Chapman said it was still unknown who took them. 
South Bend police were contacted because of the sus­pect's believed involvement in off-campus thefts, the state-

Leaders hold informal meeting 
Officers set agenda for Stand Against Hate week 
By CLAIRE REISING

Committee chairs and officers announced Student Senate goals and upcoming events during an informal meeting Wednesday. Initially, the meeting could not be called to order because Senate did not have enough members present for quorum due to a conflict with sophomore class reg­istration meetings. 
Carroll Senator Nick Ruof of the Social Concerns Committee said that Stand Against Hate Week, which speaks out against discrimination directed at gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or questioning studentc.;,

The stolen laptop belonged to Chris Kolda, a physics pro­fessor. He said he left his office for five minutes and left the door open. NDSP con­tacted him, he said, to see if his computer was missing. When he returned to his office, his laptop was gone. 
Police told Kolda, who never saw the thief, that they caught the suspect, he said. 
"I was very happy with Notre Dame security," Kolda said. "Nothing like getting 
your computer back before you know it was stolen." 
Police picked out the sus­pect because he was wearing rosary beads, which looked out of place, Kolda said. He also said NDSP said the bur­glar matched previous descriptions and that they had been searching for him for three weeks. 
NDSP found Kolda's com­puter on the suspect's per­son, he said, and the suspect

News Writer 

Saint Mary's Student Activities Board (SAB) will host its annual SMC-Tostal today. The ev~nt will be marked by an afternoon of activities in the student cen­ter, culminating in a concert by new and upcoming female recording artist, Colbie Caillat. 
The name SMC-Tostal was modeled after an Irish spring festival from the 1960s An­Tostal -short for Annual Tostal -according to senior Cassie Calion, SAB Coord ina tor. 
"The Student Activites Board has been putting on this event all four years that I have been here," Calion said. 
"As far as I can find in the yearbooks, SMC-Tostal has been celebrated since the 1970s here at [Saint Mary's] and has just been 'one of those traditional events that never lost steam." 
Special events for the day include a performanec by "Katius," an alternative rock band from Dayton, Ohio, in the Student Center Lounge. There will also be a carica­ture artist and balloon ani­mals available from 12 to 3 p.m., Calion said.

QUESTION OF THE DAY: WHO IS YOUR MAN/GIRL CRUSH?
INSIDE COLUMN 


Chocolate box men 
I would not be who I am without what happened. I would not be stronger, I would not be wiser, I would not be prepared. We cannot learn without being taught, and we cannot know 
what flavor of Ashley Charnley love we like without tasting News Production them all. Editor Just because you were sur­prised by the coconut center you ate, doesn't mean the creamy caramel won't be the one you pick next. However, even if you get four hun­dred bad flavors in a row, you have to know, that eventually you will find your favorite. You will find the guy who is milk chocolate all the way to his center. That, my dear friends, is why you continue to take a bite. In the meantime, all of these wast­ed calories begin to add up. We begin to regret every bite. Worse yet. we dread the next. We actually look at our next romantic venture as though we are lambs out to slaughter. So, why does a single girl continue with the box of chocolates'? Well, simply, because she has to. There is no way to sugar coat it· ladies, pun intended. However, instead of cursing the less appetizing flavors and spitting them out without a second thought, learn from them. Try to remember what you noticed about them when you first laid eyes on them. Prospective men are all the same. They make us smile, they make us laugh, and they give us those little tinges of excite­ment about being with someone again. You remove the lid. The aroma of beautiful, rich chocolate fills your nostrils. They are molded into beauti­ful shapes, and it is taking every ouHce of restraint you can muster to prevent yourself from plunging in. Without even tasting it, without one little bite, you already think you know just how perfect it will be. Then, the rueful moment when you realize that the inside does not match the outside. One of the advantages of a guy is that you can ask him his fla­vor. Beware of the marketers though, ladies. Some will try to tell you they are filled with things they aren't, oth­ers will tell you that you should deny your taste buds and dive in. Eventually though, with practice, these self-advertisers will be much easier to spot. I guarantee to you, the one who will satisfy you most, will have to sell himself the least. Don't get me wrong, here. I love chocolate in all shapes and sizes. There is a flavor for everyone. So guys, just because one girl doesn't like coconut doesn't mean the next one won't. This is a two way street. Russell-Stover wouldn't make a fla­vor that no one likes, and in the same way there is a girl for every guy. Life is like a box of chocolates, and ladies, it is time for you decide what you get.

OFFBEAT 
Man complains about assessment made in office 
GARDEN CITY, NY ­Harvey Levinson might be the last person his neigh­bors would expect to com­plain about the assess­ment on his condominium. After all, he's the county assessor. 
But Levinson has asked the Nassau County Assessment Review Commission to knock more than $200,000 off the $502,080 value his own office set for his two-bed­room condo in an upscale Long Island development. If approved, the change would shave an estimated $1,700 off his $13,000 property tax bill for 2009­2010. 
Levinson said he was simply trying to point up a clerical error that caused a 75-percent spike in his assessment.

Russert to deliver Red Smith lecture 
Special to The Observer 
Tim Russert, Washington bureau chief of NBC News, will deliver the 25th anniver­sary Red Smith Lecture in Journalism at Notre Dame on Monday. 
Russert 's lecture, "When Politicians Meet the Press," will begin at 8 p.m. in Washington Hall. Tickets are required for the talk, and they are available without charge at the LaFortune Student Center ticket office. 
Moderator of "Meet the Press" since 1991 and the network's chief political ana­lyst, Russert also serves as senior vice president of NBC News and as anchor of "The Tim Russert Show," a weekly program on MSNBC. He joined NBC in 1984. 
Russert received an hon­orary doctorate from Notre Dame in 2002, when he also delivered the commencement address. He's the author of two best-selling books: "Big Russ and Me" (2004) and "Wisdom of Our Fathers" (2006). 
Named the most influential Washington journalist in magazine rankings, Russert is the recipient of numerous awards, including an Emmy, and he's a member of the Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame. He holds 43 honorary doctorates from American 
colleges and universities. 
The Red Smith Lecture in Journalism was established in 1983 to honor the sports­writer and 1927 Notre Dame graduate Walter W. "Red" Smith, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished com­mentary in 1976. At the time of his death in 1982, Smith was a columnist for The New York Times. 
The Smith Lectureship seeks to foster good writing and to recognize high jour­nalistic standards. It is administered by the John W. Gallivan Program in Journalism, Ethics and Democracy at Notre Dame. Previous Red Smith Lecturers include James Reston, James J. Kilpatrick, Art Buchwald, Charles Kuralt, Judy Woodruff, Ted Koppel, Jim Lehrer and Frank McCourt. 
The series is made possible by a gift from John and Susan McMeel and Universal Press Syndicate. A South Bend native and 1957 Notre Dame graduate, John McMeel is chairman of Andrews McMeel Universal, the parent company of Universal Press Syndicate. He's a member of both the advisory council for Notre Dame's College of Arts and Letters and the advisory committee of the Gallivan Program.

Events include an ally pledge campaign at the dining halls and LaFortune, a screening of the film. "Boys Don't Cry" and T-shirt distribution. The week will cul­minate with a Holocaust Memorial on South Quad next Friday, with a prayer vigil for hate crimes at the Grotto that evening. 
According to former Social Concerns Chair Karen Koski, stu­dent government was involved in adding an academic panel on "History, Catholicism and Homosexuality," which will fea­ture history professor Gail Bederman and theology profes­sor Mary D'Angelo. 
"The speakers were what we were looking for in shedding an academic and historical perspec­tive on relationships and issues [on] how people view homosexu­ality," Koski said. 
Gender Issues Committee co­chair Patrick Tighe announced that campus will hold Take Back the Night on later in April to spread awareness about rape and sexual assault. 
"It's going to involve a rally and march around campus where men and women will actually speak out ahout how they've been sexually assaulted. It will end at the Grotto with a prayer service," he said. 
In the University Affairs Committee, student body vice president Grant Schmidt said they are continuing to plan elec­tion initiatives to raise student awareness on 2008 campaign issues. He suggested polling stu­dent.'> to gauge what issues stu­dents are interested in or to set up posters contrasting the candi­dates' issue positions. Schmidt also said that the committee will discuss how to bring popular speakers to campus. 
"It's a formality that [Father Jenkins] did invite Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John McCain to campus, and Hillary took up that offer by sending Chelsea," he said. 
In addition to University Affairs, Schmidt said he is work­ing with Community Relations chair Gus Gari to discuss a Domer Dollars campus proposal. Schmidt plans to discuss the pro­

Pierce said, and added that the speech should instead be used as a "springboard" for discussion. 
The question of what defmes the black community, posed by Pierce, sparked discussion between the audience and panel. 
"Definitions are changing as racial definitions are changing, but when it comes to much of the community, much of our commu­nity that we call America, there is a very distinct attitude toward persons of color and that would define, especially if they come from African descent, the black community," Rev. Timothy Rouse from the First AME Zion Church in South Bend said. 
Denise Challenger, doctoral can­didate in the department of History at York University, Toronto, felt that "there are mul­tiple voices [in the black commu­nity] but we share a common his­torical past which has.changed over the centuries." 
She added that the term 'black community' "is a very political term at times" and can become problematic when an individual speaks on behalf of the entire black community. 
Audience members and pan­elists discussed the definitions of 'black' and 'black community' particularly in America. 
"You're talking about a context in which the society has not lived up to its principles and values, that as African Americans, we have to contend with and I think that creates a unique experience that you don't find in the world today. The African American experience within the American Davis said. 

Audience members discussed ways of defining the black com­munity. Some felt that the black community is one with a shared history of oppression, and some that the black community resull'i when it'i members are labeled as black. 
Political implications -such as problems receiving medical care and housing -were discussed as common problems that members of the black community in America face. 
Pierce asked the audience to raise their hands if they thought that a black child, adopted and raised by two white parents in a largely white community, would be considered part of the black community. The majority of audi­ence members raised their hands to say that the child in question would be considered part of the black community. 
Challenger saw this situation ­as well as Obama's speech -as getting to the question of what it means to be black. 
"I think we really need to get to this understanding of 'the child needs to know what it means to be black,"' Challenger said. "If we look at Barack Obama himself, he is still struggling ... he wasn't 'black enough.' He says it in his speech. We need to decide what does make a person black ... if [Obama] wasn't multiracial or black defin&d as multiracial, how would he have responded to Reverend [Jeremiah] Wright and how would his remarks have been taken?" 
Pierce gathered from the audi­ence and the panelists that the definition of the black community was made by members outside of the community. 
"The words that came to me as l was thinking about the speech were 'truth' and 'reconciliation'," Monica Maria Tetzlaff, associate professor of history at Indiana University South Bend, said. 
Tetzlaff said that Obama made "very accurate historical refer­ences that the American public can learn from." 
Panelist Jennifer Mason McAward, associate professor in the Notre Dame Law School, emphasized the importance of remembering history. "One of the points I took from Senator Obama's speech is that we have to always be aware of that history ­the devastating history of racial injustice, and this idea of equality that was written into our constitu­tions," she said. 
The meeting also addressed inclusion and who should partici­pate in conversations about race relations in the United States. 
Rouse said the central racial

"The heart ofracism in America has to do with the oppression of the negro by the white slave own­ers... We have to address the issues honestly and then we can move on to some of the more aggregate issues," he said. 
Challenger disagreed and said that dialogue across various groups of people would enhance the discussion. 
"Multiple voices can participate in the discussion," she said. "I think it would be incorrect to say that only blacks have suffered through racism... multiple voices don't necessarily dilute the dia­logue." 
Davis felt that Obama's speech addressed the complaints and issues ofvarious groups. 
"Because we are a nation of migrant<;, immigrants, the thing I took away from Barack Obama's speech is that we all have gripes. African Americans have gripes, Latinos have gripes, and guess speech is that not only is there this black anger that has to be dealt with in a certain way, there's also this white resentment that has to be dealt with as well," Davis said. 
In consideration of Reverend Wright's controversial comments about America, Davis said that "part of the difficulty, I think, is understanding how whites react­ed to something that we all here all of the time-even in church­that that is a critical version of patriotism .. .it's critical, construc­tive patriotism," he said. "It's so surprising to me that certain things will stick to Barack Obama as if he is his pastor's keeper," he said. 
Davis and Tetzlafi brought up truth and reconciliation as meth­ods to healing and moving racial relations in a more positive direc­tion.

Panel grants photographer amnesty 
BAGHDAD -An Iraqi judicial committee has dismissed terrorism-related allegations against Associated Press photographer Bilal Hussein and ordered him released nearly two years after he was detained by the U.S. mili­tary. 
Hussein, 36, remained in custody Wednesday at Camp Cropper, a U.S. detention facility near Baghdad's airport. 
A decision by a four-judge panel said Hussein's case falls under a new amnesty law. It ordered Iraqi courts to "cease legal pro­ceedings" and ruled that Hussein should be "immediately" released unless other accusa­tions are pending.

Lawyers defend polygamists' privacy 
SAN ANGELO. Texas-Lawyers for a polyg­

Wednesday that although its members' multi­

unusual, they have a right to their faith and 
privacy. 
Gerry Goldstein, a San Antonio lawyer rep­resenting the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, also told a judge that the search of the temple in the sect's West Texas compound is analagous to a law enforcement search of the Vatican or other holy places. 
Goldstein asked the judge to throw out at least some of the search warrants as unconsti­tutional, but failing that urged authorities to handle any documents seized with respect. 
Governor signs mental health bill 
RICHMOND, Va. -The governor signed into law Wednesday a package of legislation aimed at tightening the state's mental health system and improving campus security in response to last year's deadly Virginia Tech shootings. 
The new laws, which go into effect in July, are intended to improve oversight and accountabili­ty of a mental health system harshly criticized after a mentally disturbed student killed 32 peo-. ple and himself at Virginia Tech on April 16. 
"It has been a difficult year, but it has been a year where people haven't shrinked from trying to learn and improye," Gov. Timothy M. Kaine said at the bill-signing ceremony as lawmakers and the parent of a student wounded in the shootings looked on.

Petraeus: Don't expect troop buildup 
Top commander in Iraq said he's aware of military strain during questioning by legislators 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Amer­ica's war commander in Iraq told Congress Wednesday he is unlikely to endorse any fresh buildup of troops even if security in the country deteriorates, signaling that the limits of the U.S. military have been reached for now. 
Gen. David Petraeus, closely questioned by law­makers for a second day, described Iraq as a frail state still struggling to pro­vide its own security. That volatile situation figured in his recommendation to President Bush that a grad­ual pullout of U.S. troops be halted this summer -a recommendation Bush is expected to embrace in a speech Thursday. 
But Petraeus also spoke of the burden on U.S. ground forces, and Bush will address that, too. In his speech at 11:30 a.m. EDT, Bush will announce plans to cut the combat tours of active-duty soldiers from 15 months to 12 months.

had stolen laptops and cell phones before. 
At around 4:30 p.m. Tuesday, NDSP received another phone call reporting suspicious behavior by a man between Badin and Howard Halls. When NDSP respond­ed, they found the suspect walking towards the Rockne Building and stopped him for questioning. The man matched the "general description" of the suspect seen in residence halls at the time of recent burglaries. He was not, however, seen in any dorm on Tuesday, and "could not be detained," the statement said. NDSP gave him a No Trespass Notice.

Residents of Lyons and Howard hall reported laptops and wallets stolen between the hours of 11 a.m. and 3 
p.m. last week. The burgla­ries in Howard took place on April 1, and the burglaries in Lyons happened on March 26. 
The suspect in both cases has been described by "sev­eral people" as a black male, between 5-foot-8 and 5-foot­11, with a thin build, "frizzy long black hair" in a pony tail or braid, possibly bad or missing teeth and possibly sporting facial hair stubble, NDSP director Phil Johnson said last Monday. 
NDSP learned that Valparaiso University has experienced similar burgla­ries with a suspect whose description matched that of the suspect in Notre Dame's recent campus robberies, Johnson said last week.

IN BRIEF 
Janey attacks Census Bureau 
WASHINGTON -The company hired to help modernize the 2010 census blamed govern­ment officials Wednesday for technology prob­lems that will force census-takers to continue using paper and pencil. 
The Census Bureau announced last week that 
it will abandon plans to use handheld comput­
ers to count the millions of residents who do not 
return census forms mailed out by the govern­
ment. · 
Cheryl L. Janey of Florida-based Harris Corp., the company supplying the computers, told a llouse committee that census officials failed to adequately spell out the specifications for the computers. 
"It was just this past January, two years after the contract was first issued, that we received more than 400 new and altered contract modi­fications," Janey told the House OversigM Committee. 
Fed approves nationwide alert system 
WASHINGTON -Federal regulators Wednesday approved a plan to create a nationwide emergency alert system using text messages delivered to cell phones. 
Text messages have exploded in popularity in recent years, particularly among young people. The wireless industry's trade associa­tion, CTIA, estimates more than 48 billion text messages are sent each month. 
The plan stems from the Warning Alert and Hesponse Network Act, a 2006 federal law that requires upgrades to the nation's emer­gency alert system. The act tasked the Federal Communications Commission with coming up with new ways to alert the public about emergencies. 
"The ability to deliver accurate and timely warnings and alerts through cell phones and other mobile services is an important next step in our efforts to help ensure that the American public has the information they need to take action to protect themselves and their families prior to, and during, disasters and other emergencies," FCC Chairman Kevin Martin said following approval of the plan.

"We can be too late, and the hour is upon us," he said. 
Obama placed emphasis on improving education, but said it started in homes with 
good parenting.

Obama's health care  plan,  

he said, is intended to accommodate both those with health care and those without. For families with health care, he said he would lower premiums by $2,500. If families had no plan, he would make avail­able plans similar to the government plan he receives as a member of the Senate. The plan would have no conditions, and if a family could not afford it, the gov­ernment would subsidize it on a "sliding scale," he said. He ended with a discussion

PAKISTAN 
7 killed in street fighting 
Associated Press 
KARACHI -A street fight between political rivals spi­raled into rioting in Pakistan's biggest city Wednesday, with armed men smashing cars and setting fires. Five people burned to death in one building and two were shot and killed. 
It was the worst political violence Pakistan's new gov­ernment has faced since tak­ing office last month, vowing to curtail the powers of U.S.­allied President Pervez Musharraf and cement democracy after eight years of military rule. 
The trouble broke out when pro-and anti-government attorne.ys punched and beat each other with sticks near the main courts complex in Karachi. Soon after, armed men in began shooting and torching cars in several dis­tricts, witnesses said. 
A nearby building was set ablaze, and five charred bod­ies were found on the sixth floor, said police officer Syed Sulaiman. Two other people died of gunshot wounds, ineluding a paramedie whose ambulance came under fire while trying to the injured. 
Salman Naguri, a 22-year­old shopkeeper, said he saw two men on a motorbike shoot at passing ambulance, which crashed into an elec­tricity pylon. 
"For 15 or 20 minutes an injured man was crying for help from inside the ambu­lance but nobody helped him," Nag uri said. When another ambulance crew arrived, the man was dead, he said. 
It was the second episode to tarnish a powerful lawyers' movement that led months of protests against Musharraf, galvanizing his

Attorneys from the move­ment were involved in an assault Tuesday on former Cabinet minister Sher Afgan Niazi, who was beaten as he emerged from his office. Police hurried him into an ambulance, which was stoned and had its ignition key stolen, forcing security forces to push it away from the scene. 
A group of lawyers allied with the pro-Musharraf Mutahida Quami Movement, or MQM, had been protesting the assault on Niazi when the

TODAY'S STAFF 

Do you have many people in your life who know you-who really, real­ly know you? Sure, we all have lots of friends, pals, buddies, acquaintances, section-mates; people we love to sit 
next to and chat  
with in this class or  Kate Barrett  
that; people we eat  
lunch with because  
we always see them  Faithpoint  
in the dining hall on  

Monday-Wednesday-Friday. But with whom do you really have intimate, life-giving relationships, the ones that have built up layers of strength and knowledge, forgiveness and grace over time? Who do you trust enough to let in on your embarrassing flaws, your deepest fears, your most far­reaching dreams, and who has let you in on theirs? 
One of the most famous images in all the gospels has given its name to the Fourth Sunday of Easter: Good Shepherd Sunday. This weekend, as we do each year on the Fourth Sunday of the Easter season, we will read from one of the gospel passages in which Jesus describes himself as a shepherd who knows his sheep so intimately that they will follow the sound of only his voice and no one else's. 
I have always wondered about this phenomenon -I mean, I get my own children's voices mixed up some­times, when I can't see which one of them I'm talking to. And yet these sheep -perhaps hundreds of them, who by all accounts are dumb as dirt -know the guy who leads them in and out to eat each day just by listen­ing for him, and don't get it wrong, ever. 
Jesus describes for the Pharisees a 
shepherd who knows the name of each of his sheep, and who leads them out of the sheepfold by means of an intimate relationship which has obviously been built up over time: "The sheep hear his voice, as the shepherd calls his own sheep by name and leads them out ... He walks ahead of them, and the sheep follow him, because they recognize his voice." 
Of course, Jesus used this analogy, which anyone listening in that sheep­laden time and culture would have understood, to explain why he came as God's son -to know each and every one of us by name and to call us safely to everything we need. Those sheep needed only a ·patch of good grass to chew on and maybe somebody who would keep an eye out for wolves or poachers; we have a much more serious need for that shepherd who knows our name. The one who tells us, as we will hear on Sunday, that he came for us so we "might have life and have it more abul_ldantly." 
Wouldn't it be great if it were just that easy? If we could just recognize the voice of Jesus whenever we need­ed to figure out where to go, what choices to make, what direction to turn? If we have a significant decision to make, we just listen for the voice of Jesus, recognize it above all the com­peting din, and boom-we're good. Just as the sheep, by listening to the shepherd, knew where to go for lunch, we could hear the voice of life and know exactly what to say, or do, or choose in our search for the life Jesus promises. 
Here's where we could learn from the sheep. They know the shepherd's 
voice because they have made a habit out of listening for it, many times a day. Deep in their little brains, they know their very lives depend on that shepherd and that they'd better be paying attention. We will certainly recognize the voice of Jesus more easily if we make a point to pray each day, to listen intently to how our shepherd speaks to our hearts. 
And here's where we're much lucki­er than the sheep. Our God, who knows each of us by name and knows the sound of each of our voices, speaks to us first of all through the sacraments and through our prayer, but also through the voices of those most significant and life-giving rela­tionships in our lives. If we hear and recognize the voice of Jesus when we listen to or read the Scriptures, when we receive the Eucharist or the sacrament of Reconciliation, we will be able to discern his voice in the sounds of the people in our lives whom we love most deeply and who truly love us. We will recognize the "thieves and robbers" of the gospel for who or what they are-people, material things, ambitions, insecuri­ties, false desires, that come to "steal and destroy" -and who will only dis­tract and deter us from the abundant life God promises us through Jesus Christ. 
Let's learn a lesson from the sheep: listen, and listen good.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Alcohol: Enemy of academic and moral development 
No kegs. No hard liquor. No "games" (although drinking is never a game). These were the first baby steps toward alcohol eradication taken years ago, and it seems that a next step must be taken. Alcohol is a deterrent toward the academic and moral development of students here at Notre Dame, due to its damaging effects on the spirit and body, which were raised in Daniel Cerrone's article ("Rethinking alcohol consumption," Apr. 4.) 
Some disturbing facts about the effects of alco­hol were presented to me in the form of a PIL­LARS poster by my roommate freshman year. "Did you know ... consuming five or more alco­holic beverages in one night can affect brain and body activity up to three days?!" 
Moreover, "two consecutive nights of drinking five or more alcoholic beverages can affect brain and body activity for up to five days!" The poster is blatantly saying that alcohol will adversely affect the students' learning even after the deed has been done. It is unbelievable to me that the administration can be aware of these facts and still turn a blind eye to the rampant consumption of alcohol on campus. Do they want students to fail? 
This is absurd. Alcohol consumption also leads to poor decision-making; stupid things can be done (I have heard of kids running through hall­ways with alcohol paraphernalia, right past the rooms of Assistant Rectors, and of others who lose personal items such as clothing and musical instruments) but many possibly life altering deci­sions can be made as well (for example, I know a student who habitually rides his bike around cam­pus and South Bend while drunk, putting his life in perilous danger). 
Alcohol is a main vector of sexually promiscu­ous activity here on campus, and many locales off. It is a depressant not only of our mental activity but also of our moral development. As a Catholic University whose goals are to educate the mind and develop the soul, Notre Dame should serious­ly reconsider its stance on on-campus permissibil­ity of alcohol. 
Alcohol use runs counter to the goals and mis­sion of this great university. The prohibition of alcohol would cause an increase in academic and moral development here at Notre Dame. Mr. Cerrone, I tip my hat to you. for trying to bring change for the better.

Top 10 reasons to love

·,::;The Backer·· .... 
We would like to respond to Didier Lewis's derogatory Lollerskates comic strip printed on April 
7. We are proud proponents of the Linebacker Lounge as South Bend's superior drinking estab­lishment and would like to elucidate the reasons why: 
1. 
Longevity-This institution has served the Notre Dame community for over 45 years! 

2. 
The Music-At what other bar can you hear "Ghostbusters" played on a Saturday night? Or Toto and N'SYNC mixed in with "Get Low," "Apologize," and Soulja Boy? 

3. 
Potent Long Islands -You only remember the good times. 

4. 
Location-Within walking distance from cam­pus and TC, saving you money on cab fare. 

5. 
Freebies -Drink iicket with $5 cover and freshly popped popcorn. 


6. The Backer Pole -I dare you to lick it. 

7. Merchandise -Because everyone wants a T­shirt exclaiming "I Rode the Linebacker Pole." 
8. Website Bios of Your Favorite Bartenders-www.backernd.com. 
9. 
Special Events-Have you ever been to a wed­ding reception or bachelorette party at the Backer? I have, though not for anyone I knew ... yet! 

10. 
Old Alumni-"These boys don't need Viagra ... " (Yes, this was a real pick-up line used at the Linebacker Lounge.) 


If the Backer truly sucked as LP-wi~'s comic claims, why is it packed every Friday and Saturday night of the year? In 50 years would you come back for a football game and go to "The Feve?" Of course not! Yes, the Backer Sludge is disgusting, but the experience is unlike any other. Call it sketch if you must, but as Greg "The Curfew God" says, "If you don't have fun at The Backer, it's your own damn fault!"

Drinking not purely a personal choice 
For some reason, a lot of college students seem to believe that drinking is a compulsory aspect of college life, a precept as fundamen­tal as any listed in the Bill of Rights. Certainly, the 2,000 students who stormed the Main Building 24 years ago in protest of Notre Dame's then-new alcohol policy would agree. 
Being in college doesn't entitle us to do as we please and we must remain sensitive to the effects of our choices-whether they involve alcohol or not -on other people. 
Although I do not drink alcohol, I've always believed that the decision to drink in college is a matter of personal choice as long as those who drink respect those who don't. However, my patience runs thin when one person's choice becomes another person's problem. I can't imagine that my dorm's clPaning people 
are amused as they scrub the vomit of drunk­en students from toilet seats after a weekend of "responsible" drinking. 
Certainly, excessive drinking by Notre Dame students has rankled local residents and undermined relations between Notre Dame and nearby communities. 
There's nothing intrinsically wrong about drinking, but a heavily inebriated person sim­ply cannot appreciate how offensive his or her actions can be to others. It's pretty dis­gusting when a person is so intoxicated that he confuses a sink with a Orinal. 
Colin Littlefield freshman St. Edward's Hall Apr. S 
Stir-fry changes a good thing 
Sorry, Cornelius ("Unnecesary change in stir-fry," Apr. 8), but I believe you may have fudged your argument concerning the new change in stir-fry process at North Dining. I, too, was rather annoyed at the loss of tong privileges, but a 30-second conversation with the stir-fry guy cleared everything up. 
Any leftover food served by a non-food services employee 
(i.e. students) must be disposed of at the end of the day. So at then end of every day, all the food self-served by students must be thrown out according to health regulations. If the food is only handled by food services staff, however, that food can be saved for the following day instead of being wasted. Over the course of a school year, this adds up to a heck of a lot of food being saved. 
The decision to fix this problem reflects Notre Dame's mis­sion to make a positive impact on our environment through the elimination of wastefulness. So when it comes down to it, I will gladly wait a few extra minutes in the stir-fry line and eat a few extra pieces of pasta and pepperoni in order to contribute to this mission.

The consequences of drinking
-, 
Drinking is an-important part of life at Notre Dame, as it is on virtually every college campus. In fact, it is so integral to the culture here that it is difficult to imagine what it would be like if no one drank. Beer and college life seem to be a match made in heaven. 
What then is the problem? College students love to have a great time and alcohol just makes things even better. To this I say, "Party on!" But where should we draw the line'? Should we even draw a line? College is a time of great freedom, of trial and error, of finding oneself. It's also a time when we can do lots of things that we won't be able to do in 10 years. While it may seem alright to get drunk 2-3 nights a week in college, once someone has a family to take care of, doing this may war­rant the label "alcoholic." 
The issue is not whether one should drink or not, for this is simply a matter of personal preference. The issue is rather how a person should drink. Put simply, we must decide whether getting so drunk that one vomits, has blurry vision, and cannot remember what happened is worth the temporary pleasure it gives. One finds in life that many things give lots of pleasure, but in the end, if taken to an extreme do more harm than good. Eating lots of chocolatP. ice cream and watching TV all day will make you fat and lazy. Regularly visiting a prosti­tute would give lots of pleasure at the time too, but leave one feeling empty and perhaps with a STD. 
While these may seem like extreme examples, the analogy holds true for regularly getting very drunk. It's a hell of a lot of fun in the moment, but is it really worth the consequences?

Joseph Arthur's 'Let's Just Be' pales in comparison 
By JAMES COSTA 
Scene Writer 
Joseph Arthur has been spoiling us for the last eight years. With such albums as 2000's "Come to Where I'm From," 2002's "Redemption's Son" and 
. 2004's "Our Shadows Will Remain," Arthur listeners have been treated to superb solo albums. A significant ele­ment of the "OC" and "American Pie" period of American 
stride. 
The problem with this record isn't even that its particularly bad music, because it's not. It's fine. Some of it is even good, and a few of the songs bor­der on excellence. The problem is that Arthur himself has been so good in the past that anything, which doesn't quite measure up, seems bad. 
Perhaps the most prevalent feeling expressed on the record is one of emptiness. Where earlier records 
were filled with ten­


soft drums and a melancholy singing voice, Arthur sings of the moments after love has been lost when two old lovers face each other with a sad ten­derness found only in the meeting of soft hearts and aching desires: "I can see the sun I I think the evening's done I Take me home I You look good on your own I Sometimes it's good to say goodbye I Before you make it to the end of time." It's a brilliant, sad song, perfect for those moments when you want the music to make you think, rather than lament. It's a song of memories and one that anyone who's learnt to say goodbye will understand and appreciate. 
The next track, "Chicago" turns up the tempo a good bit in the wake of "Take Me Home." Heminiscent of earli­er Arthur tunes like "In the Sun" and "Can't Exist," the song is a call to a significant another to trust and to 
believe in Arthur's words and promis­. es. He sings: "Your mirror is destroyed I I see you now trying to avoid I The truth of who you really are I The heat will stay with the flame I So your beau­ty never will change I To me you will always be a star." It's clear that Arthur is trying to convince someone to stay around and to hold onto a feeling that has become fractured and distant. With its rousing chorus, the song is catchy and a joy to listen to on repeat. 
Basically, the record is OK. It's defi­nitely more rocking than the earlier Arthur stuff, though it doesn't quite equal the majestic power and beauty of the prior releases. If you're willing to accept a new sound and perspec­tive, then album is worth a look. If not, download "Take Me Home" and "Chicago" and you'll be set.

The 2nd Annual Midwest Undergraduate Film Conference kicks off this Friday at the DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts, and runs through Saturday evening. Admission is free and all speakers wil! present in Browning Cinema. Assistant Professors of Film, Television and Theater, Christine Becker and Christopher Sieving co-organized the conference and have worked to collect undergraduate authors of 30 of the best papers on film and media from all over the Midwest. 
All students in Notre Dame's FTT Honors Program were encouraged to submit propos­als,~? the conference, but pro-, 1posals from non-Honors stu­dents were accepted as well. 
The Conference, which began last year under the direction of Associate Professor of Film, Television and Theater, Pam Wojcik, is once again a landmark event. 
"[T]his is the sole undergrad-only media studies conference in the coun­try," Becker said. 
Six Notre Dame seniors were among those chosen by Becker and Sieving to present this weekend along with undergraduates from other schools such, as Indiana, Northwestern, the University of Chicago and Loyola University Chicago. 
Becker sees the conference as an instrumental learning experience for all the students involved.

The conference is also a way to reward students for their outstanding work. 
"They're doing work that is of pub­lishable quality," said Becker, "This conference will help to give them the recognition they deserve for those efforts." 
The conference will function in three person panels with each pan­elist presenting a 20 minute paper, followed by 15 minute question and answer session run by a moderator. Becker pointed out that she was very pleased with how many of the moder­ators and panelists lined up. "For instance, FTT's Donald Crafton will be moderating the panel on silent film exhibition," she said. "And he's one of the leading experts on silent cinema, so I know that both

The topies for the weekend's papers are wide-ranging and diverse. Topics include "Female Revenge Films," "Forgotten Film Stars," Canadian and Iranian cinema, classic directors such as Alfred Hitchcock and Robert Bresson, as well as discussions of more recent films like "Atonement," "Stranger Than Fiction" and "Se7en." 
But the conference isn't just for FTT majors. 
Senior Honors student Brittany Lash, who will be presenting her paper entitled "The Modern Popular Hero in Cinema" on Friday evening, stressed that the conference is for all

Other Notre Dame students who will be presenting at this weekend's con­ference include, senior Maria Iuppa, presenting her paper. "A Hint of Perversion: Domesticity in Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt," and Breana Leader presenting on "Disney and Counterculture."

Western Conference turns up the heat in second half 
No. 8 Anthony Travel looks dominant in route to tourney finals 
By ANDY ZICCARELLI and 
GRIFFIN DASSATI 
Sporrs Writers 
With an 11-7 lead at half time, Western Conference was able to hold Team 318 to one basket and pull away with the 21-8 win. 
Freshman Graysen Petersen­Pitts credited the inspirational halftime speech of senior 
William David William as the reason for the spark. 
"It's really their last chance to make a run," Petersen-Fitts said of Western Conference's win. 
The first half 
was evenly 
matched, with

Before the game, Anthony captain sophomore Mike Henry admitted that he wasn't ready to rely entirely on his team's No. 8 seed to create an easy win against Last Team. 
"We don't look past anyone," Henry said. "We're focused on the here-and-now. We're focused on this game and only this game." 
Sophomore Pete Dolan, another Anthony team member,

the court. But the second half was a different story as Western Conference's defense allowed for the win. Western Conference's defense was able to keep 318 "on lockdown" allowing its offense to pull away. Petersen-Fitts attributes the team's success to his own abilities. 
"Sometimes I feel like it's really not fair when I'm on the court," he said. "I had to have had at least 15 rebounds. I kind of lost count." 
For those unsure of the name, the Western Conference is the NBA's dominant league, home to the best players and teams in the league. By placing them­selves on the same level, it is clear this Bookstore team does not lack confidence. 
For a team with a couple of varsity athletes, such talent and athleticism is expected. However, in the future, do not expect Western Conference to need a halftime speech to fire them up. 
"The second half is indicative of what this team is capable of," Petersen-Fitts said. 
Western Conference will take the court again on Sunday, looking to advance into the round of 64.

"The score­board says 0-0 right now, and we won't quit until it says 21 on our side. That said, we think our better is bet­

Despite  his  

captain's mod­esty, Dolan's pre­

diction did come to fruition fair­ly quickly. Anthony started out on a 6-0 run, with effectively executed offense by Henry, 
Dolan, and fellow sophomores 
A  n  d  r  e  w

Chad Breeden. But Last Team wasn't ready to quit yet, as they closed the gap to 6-3 with an offen­sive run of their own. Retaliating, Anthony went on a 5-0 run before entering halftime. 
After a short break, Anthony continued their

run-and-gun style, accelerating the pace on the fast break and pushing their lead to 1 7-4. Despite two quick baskets by Last Team, Anthony closed the game out on a lay-up by Henry. 
"Even though they had the height, we had the hustle and we thought that would win out in the end," sophomore Aaron Pierre said. "We came off our two-game winning streak with a lot of confidence, we underes­timated our opponents and they played really well." 
Team Two-Liner def. The Buttercutting Bailers 21-6 
Despite an inspired late run by the Buttercutting Bailers, Team Two-Liner's effective first 
half ultimately earned a 21-6 victory and advanced to the next round. 
Two-Liner began the game on a 17-0 run and looked poised to go wire-to-wire in a shut-out victory, but just then the under­dog Bailers got the inspiration they needed from a very unex­pected source; an ankle injury to their captain, senior Melinda Welch. 
After the injury, the Ballers were forced to take on Team Two-Liner five-on-four, but they went on a small run of their own, drawing the score to 17-6. After the game, Welch expressed her emotions about her team's effort. 
"I felt like I was letting my team down," she said, "but they came back and scored six just for me." 
But Welch's teammate, junior Matt Townsend, revealed that the injury might just have been a part of the Bailers' strategy. 
"We created a good diversion with [Welch's] injury, Townsend said. "And it almost worked. We almost came back." 
But after giving up six points, 
Two-Liner turned the defense up and finished the game strong, coasting to a 21-6 win. After the game, Two-Liner cap­tain sopho­more John Maier applaud­ed the Bailers' 
attempt  at  a  
comeback.  
"It  was  a  

valiant effort," Maier said. "Stuff just fell 
for them, and it really speaks clearly as to how powerful [they[ can be." 
After complimenting his opponents, Maier conveyed the pride he feels for his team after their first two wins. 
"I think our team really starts hard in the back and finishes quick in the front," he said. "We've had two pretty weak teams [so farl and we think they should probably take up another sport...Iike knitting. Other than that I think we'll be tested coming up against our next opponent."

Belles get drubbing from Flying Dutch 
By MEAGHAN VESELIK Sports Writer 

Saint Mary's fell to Hope 8-1 Wednesday afternoon, dropping its overall record to 5-9. 1-3 MIAA. 
The Flying Dutch swept the doubles matches, and won five of the six singles in their victory over the Belles. 
"Today was a tough match against Hope," sophomore co­captain Camille Gebert said. "They are a very strong team, with a lot ofexperience." 
In the doubles matches, Saint Mary's could not carry over its momentum from last week's 3-0 domination at Olivet. Hope's sophomore Lucy Himes and jun­ior Sammi Stille defeated Saint Mary's No. 1 doubles pair Gebert and freshman Jillian Hurley 8-2. resulting in their eighth loss as a pair this spring, Saint Mary's No. 2 doubles duo of sophomore co­captain Lisa Hubino and fresh­man Betsy Reed lost g-6 to sen­ior Christine Garcia an:d sopho­more Danielle Werley, bringing them to an overall record of 5-7 as a pair. Hope's Katherine Garcia and Nicole Spanguolo defeated Saint Mary's No. 3 dou­bles pair Freshmen Jessica Kosinski and Franca Peluso 8-5. 
"Our doubles did not pull 
through, which put us at a dis­advantage early on," Gebert said. "We had a couple of close matches which could have gone either way. I think that we could have improved in our dou­bles." 
The Flying Dutch continued to show their team's strength in the singles matches, winning all but one. For the fourth time this sea­son, Hurley was the only Belle to win in singles play. Hurley defeated Hope's C. Garcia 6-0, 6­0 at the No.2 spot for her twelfth victory of the season. No. 1 sin­gles player Gebert lost to Hope's Stille 6-2, 6-1 while No. 3 Reed was defeated 7-5, 6-4 by Werley; Marissa Kooyers beat No. 4 Kosinski 6-1, 6-1; No. 5 Rubino lost 6-2, 6-4 to Himes, and No.6 Peluso was beaten 6-2, 6-1 by Hope's K. Garcia. 
"I hope that we can use all of this experience for the confer­ence tournament," Gebert said. "We will be seeing all the teams there for a second time. It will give us a chance to redeem our­selves.. It's just a matter of get­ting over the hump." 
Saint Mary's next faces confer­ence rival Tri-State at home. The Belles and the Thunder will play this Saturday at 1:00.

Saint Mary's earns second place start 
By ALEX BARKER Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's started off the MIAA qualifiers strong after shooting a 33 7 and placing themselves in second place behind Olivet with only two qualifier events remaining. 
"I thought we played well today," Belles coach Mark Hamilton said. "Unfortunately, Olivet played as well as they possibly could have." 
Heading into the second of three MIAA qualifiers, the Belles are 18 strokes behind Olivet who shot a 319 on the first day. 
Freshman Rosie O'Connor led the Belles with a round of 80 and classmate Emily Gore was not far behind 
rounds will be held April 25­
26. Before then, the Belles will look to improve at the Vasser Invitational in New York this weekend and at the Illinois Wesleyan Spring Fling the following weekend. 
Looking ahead to the last two days of qualifying in a few a weeks, Hamilton believes that the first place spot is still within the Belles' reach. 
"Hopefully we can even it up in the next round and head into the final day with a good chance to win," Hamilton said. 
The team who sits in first place at the end of the three qualifying days will clinch a spot in the Div. III National championship tournament in May.

Associated Press 

NEW ORLEANS-LSU intends to hire Stanford's Trent Johnson, who led the Cardinal to the round of 16 in this year's NCAA tourna­ment, as its new coach. 
Several people at LSU familiar with the selection process said a formal announcement was expect­ed by Thursday. The people asked to remain anony­mous because the hiring was not yet official. 
Stanford athletic director Bob Bowlsby said in an e­mail to The Associated Press on Wednesday after­noon that Johnson was given permission to talk to LSU but had not yet resigned. 
"LSU notified me that they wanted to talk with him this morning as I was leaving Tampa" following the women's Final Four, Bowlsby said. "The position probably pays twice what ours does so I expect he feels he has to listen. Trent has not informed me that he has accepted another position." 
Johnson has been at Stanford for four seasons, compiling an 80-48 record. 
He had said recently he hoped to remain at Stanford, and had been slated to meet with Bowlsby on Thursday to discuss a new contract. 
Stanford hired Johnson 
in 2004 to replace Mike Montgomery, who left for the NBA's Golden State Warriors for two seasons and last week was hired by Bay Area rival California. 
Johnson was an assistant at Stanford before going to Nevada and then returning to the Cardinal. 
Stanford lost to Texas in the regional semifinals of the NCAA tournament. 
Stanford's twin 7 -footers, Brook and Robin Lopez, announced last week they would hire agents and enter the NBA draft, forgo­ing their final two seasons of eligibility. 
LSU went to the Final Four only three seasons ago, but failed to make the NCAA. tournament in each of the last two years. The Tigers went 13-18 this sea­son, and former coach John Brady was fired dur· ing the year. 
Assistant Butch Pierre took over on Feb. 8 and led LSU to victories in five of its last nine contests, but the Tigers lost in the opening round of the Southeastern Conference tournament. 
LSU considered a range of candidates, including Travis Ford at Massachusetts, Anthony Grant at Virginia Commonwealth and Oliver Purnell at Clemson. Ford and Purnell both with­drew from consideration Tuesday.

Diamondbacks stretch winning streak to six 
Napoli hits first career grand slam for Angels 
Associated Press 
PHOENIX-. Arizona can still win the close ones, too. 
The Diamondbacks stretched their winning streak to six games on Wednesday with a 4-3 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
Eric Byrnes hit a go-ahead, two-run single in the seventh­inning off Hiroki Kuroda and Micah Owings (2-0) allowed three runs and seven hits in seven innings as the Diamondbacks fin­ished a three-game sweep of the Dodgers. 
"We've been scoring soine runs and getting some early leads," Arizona manager Bob Melvin said. "Today, a little bit different. They got the lead early on and had some momentum, then we got the big hit." 
All six victories in the streak have come against NL West foes. Arizona swept three at Colorado before their home-opening series against Los Angeles. 
The Diamondbacks used power hitting to beat the Dodgers 9-3 and 10-5 in the series' first two
 
games. This time, Arizona looked like the team that went 32-20 in one-run games a year ago. 
"Jt's a scrappy team that hap­pnns to be able to hit some home runs, too,'" Byrnes said. "I know we hit a lot of home runs in those first two games. but I think the greatest thing about this team is we can win games in different fashions." 
Brandon Lyon, who had blown his prior two save chances, retired the side in order in the ninth for his second save, although he got a scare when Blake Dewitt flied out to the left field wall. 
Byrnes, who went 3-for-5, ended Kuroda's afternoon with a two-out, bases-loaded single that brought in the tying and go-ahead runs in the sixth. Byrnes' hit came on Kuroda's first pitch. 
"Amazing stuff," Byrnes said of the Japanese pitcher. "But the one thing we tried to take advantage of was how many strikes that he was throwing. I know in my approach I wasn't going to wait around." 
Kuroda called the pitch to Byrnes his biggest mistake of the day. 
"Although I allowed too many hits today, there weren't many hits I thought that really got the sweet spot of the bat," Kuroda said through an interpreter. 
In his first start of the season, Arizona's Augie Ojeda matched his career best with three hits, one a double. 
Kuroda (1-1), in his second start since coming to the Dodgers from Japan, gave up four runs -two earned -and nine hits in 5 2-3 innings. 
James Loney helped make up for his earlier error at first base with his first home run of the sea­son, a solo shot that barely cleared the fence in right field, evading Justin Upton's glove, to give the Dodgers a 3-2 lead in the sixth. Loney extended his hitting streak to a career-best nine games. 
With his relief corps a bit worn down, Melvin said the team need­ed the seven solid innings from Owings, who started the streak "1th a win in Colorado. 
"I thought he was pretty sharp," Melvin said. "There were times when he might not have the com­mand that he did in Colorado, but boy, to give seven innings there when our bullpen was not full up down there, those guys know it." 
Los Angeles manager Joe Torre said that it's important that his struggling young hitters not lose confidence. 
"Whether it's a child you have in your house or someone that you hire to do your lawn, there's something about youngsters that they lack a little patience," Torre said. "They get a little anxious to where they overdo sometimes. I'd rather have them overdo than not care." 
The Dodgers took their first lead of the series in the second when Juan Pierre doubled to right with a runner on first and Upton threw to second base rather than hitting the cutoff man. 
Arizona took advantage of Loney's throwing error on a potential double-play grounder in the fourth, taking a 2-1 lead on a run-scoring grounder by Heynolds -his major league-leading 13th HBI -and Upton's run-scoring single. Andre Ethier's sacrifice fly tied the score in the fifth. 
Angels 9, Indians 5 
ANAHEIM -The Los Angeles Angels usually don't rely on home run clusters like the one they had against Cleveland on Wednesday. But the Indians are giving them up at an alarming rate, and one thing led to another. 
Mike Napoli hit his first career grand slam, Garret Anderson and Casey Kotchman also went deep against Paul Byrd, and Vladimir Guerrero added a three-run shot against Jensen Lewis in a victory. 
"We're hitting home runs right now, which is good for us, but we're a situational team," Napoli said. "We know what we've got to do. Moving guys over, going from first to third, being aggressive on the bases-that's who we are. 
"But anytime you get home runs up and down the lineup, it's pretty good." 
Dustin Moseley (1-1) allowed four runs on nine hits and struck out five over six innings after get­ting staked to a 6-0 lead. The Indians rallied with four runs in the sixth as Jhonny Peralta home­red, Casey Blake hit an RBI dou­ble and Kelly Shoppach added a two-run shot. 
But Guerrero greeted Lewis with a drive to left-center in the seventh for a 9-4 lead after Chone Figgins led off the inning with a broken-bat single and Gary Matthews Jr. reached on a field­ing error by Blake at third base. 
Byrd (0-2) allowed six runs and five hits in three innings, raising his ERA to 11.05. The 37-year-old right-hander, whose name was included in the Mitchell Heport on performance-enhancing drugs, had his $7.5 million option for this season picked up by the Indians after capping off a 15-8 campaign with victories in both of his post­season starts. 
"It's been a distraction at times when I'm not on the mound, but it hasn't really caused me to lose concentration," Byrd said of the Mitchell controversy. "My head's pretty clear. I just haven't had my command at all and I haven't had very good stuff. To pitch up here, you have to have one of the two, and I have neither right now."

Tightened security in San Francisco 

AP Olympic torch bearers walk surrounded by security on Van Ness Avenue in San Francisco Wednesday. Security was tightened due to protests. 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO -Security was tightened on the Golden Gate Bridge and elsewhere around the city Tuesday as officials prepared for massive protests of China's crackdown in Tibet during the Olympic torch's only North American stop on its journey to Beijing. 
The Olympic flame was whisked to a secret location shortly after il<> pre-dawn arrival Tuesday follow­ing widespread and chaotic demonstrations during the torch relay in London and Paris. Activists are protesting China's human rights record, its grip on Tibet and support for Sudan despite years of bloodshed in Darfur. 
The flame is scheduled to be paraded through the city Wednesday on a six-mile route that hugs San francisco Bay. Already, one runner who planned to carry the flame dropped out because of safety concerns, offi­cials said. 
It began its 85,000-mile journey from Ancient Olympia in Greece to Beijing on March 24, and was the focus of protests from the very start. 
!lours after it arrived in San Francisco, protesters marched to the Chinese Consulate, calling on China to cease its heavy-handed rule ofTibet. 
Meanwhile, a few miles away in Chinatown, leaders of China's expatriate community held a news conference calling for a peaceful relay, and said they were proud China was selected to host the summer games. 
In Beijing, International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge said the body's executive board would discuss Friday whether to end the international leg of the torch relay because of the demonstrations. He said he was "deeply saddened" by the previous protests and was con­cerned dbout the relay in San Francisco. 
"\Ve recognize the right for peo­ple to protest and express their views, but it should be nonviolent. \ve are very sad for· all the ath­letes and the people who expected so much from the run and have bePn spoiled of their joy," Hogge said. 
Hundreds of' activists carrying Tibetan 11ags and wearing tradi­
tiona] clothes gathered in United 
Nations Plaza, a pedestrian area 
near San Francisco's City Hall, to 
denounce China's policy tow<W"d 
Tibet and the recent crackdown 
on protesters there. They then 
marched to the Chinese Consulate 
as part of a daylong Tibetan Torch 
Relay. 
"This is not about us battling the 

torchbearers," Lhadom Tethong, 
executive director of Students for 
a Free Tibet, told the crowd out­
side the consulate. "This is about 
the Chinese government using the 
torch for political purposes. And 
we're going to use it right back." 
San Francisco was chosen to 

host the relay in part because of 
its large Asian population. 
David Lee, executive direetor of the Chinese American Voters Education Committee and a pro­fessor of political science at San Francisco State University, said while many Chinese agree with critics of China, on the whole, Chinese-Americans feel a tremen­dous sense of pride that the Beijing Olympics chose San Francisco as the only relay site in North America. 
At a news conference Tuesday, businessowners a.<>ked fc:>r calm. 
"We are begging for five hours of peace," said Sam Ng, pn~sident of the Chinese Six Companies, a prominent benevolent a.'isociation. 
Some residents also expressed dismay at the protesl<>. 
Ling Li, 29, who immigrated from China's Guangdong Province eight years ago, said she wa.<> dis­appointed that this pivotal moment in her country's history wa.<> being marred by demonstra­tions. She believes that Tibet is a rightful part of China and its quest for independence should not be part ofthe Olympics. 
"If I support the Olympics, of course I don't support the protests. This is the first time China has had the Olympics. We should be proud of this," she said. 
Pro-Tibet activists and other human rights groups said they'd encouraged their supporters to protest peacefully and not pisrupt the relay or the torch runners. 
"We can be effective without (disruption)," said Allyn Brooks­LaSure, a spokesman for Save Darfur. "Disrupting tomorrow's ceremonies couldn't possibly embarrass Beijing any more than their disastrous Darfur policy already ha..'i."

NBA 
Thomas to conclude LOS season with Knicks 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -lsiah Thomas 
will finish the season as the Knicks' coach, but needs a good explanation for why .things went so horribly wrong for any chance to last beyond 
that. 
New president Donnie Walsh 
said Wednesday he plans to 
meet soon with Thomas, and he 
wants to know why a team he 
thought could be good instead 
will finish as perhaps the worst 
in franchise history. 
Walsh insists he hasn't decid­
ed on Thomas' future with the 
team, but the Knicks' 22-56 
record entering their game 
against Charlotte clearly works 
against the coach. 
"You can say I have-an open 
mind as far as any conversation 
I'm going to have," Walsh said. 
"I still don't think we've played 
well, there's a lot of things I 
want to talk about. So it's not 
totally open. It's not like I'm 
going in saying, 'Well, this has 
all been great, so what do you 
want to talk about?'" 
Walsh said he expects their 
conversation to happen before 
the regular season ends next 
week. But no matter what he 
decides, he expects Thomas to 
be on the bench for the remain­
ing games. 
"Yeah, I would say that we're 
going to go through the season 
because there's only four 
games left," Walsh said, "and 
I'm going to use this period to 
try to take a look at the whole 
situation so I'm in a position to 
make whatever decision is 
going to be made -if there are 
any." 
Walsh was hired last 
Wednesday to replace ·Thomas 
as team president, and put off 
any decision about Thomas' 
remaining job until after they 
could meet in person. The 
Knicks were on a road trip ~t 
the time and didn't return until 
the weekend. 
Walsh had left town by then 
to clean out his desk in Indiana, 
where he recently announced 
he was leaving the Pacers after 
24 years in their front office. 
Walsh didn't return to New 
York until Tuesday, and said he still hasn't even seen Thomas. 
That will change soon. Walsh attended the game against the Bobcats, and the Knicks also are home for games Friday and Monday before closing the sea­son at Indiana on April 16. 
Walsh wants details about specific things that happened this season, such as the Thomas-Stephon Marbury feud that sent the season spiraling out of control after only five games. Marbury left the team in Phoenix after Thomas threatened to remove him from the starting lineup, and the Knicks lost their next six games. 
Thomas also had disagree­ments on the bench during games with Quentin Richardson and Zach Randolph, and he'll need to decide how honest he wants to be with Walsh about whether he was at fault. He also yanked center Eddy Curry from the starting lineup, and Curry lost his confidence and took a major step back with his play this season. 
"I would say that, again, this has been an extremely chal­lenging year and it's been a unique year that's presented unique and different problems, and you know our record is not good," Thomas said. "It's not good. We've had a poor per­formance out on the floor. That's not a permanent situa­tion. The situation we're in now is not permanent." 
Speaking before Walsh, Thomas continued to act as if he is part of the future -as he always does -and again talked about winning champi­onships in New York. He worked three years under Walsh in Indiana as the Pacers' coach and both say they have a good relationship, so perhaps he has reason to believe he has a chance to stick. 
Thomas assembled this entire team that will miss the playoffs for the fourth straight year. While he stresses that the Knicks were "pretty far down" when he arrived as president in 2003 but are "positioned pretty properly" now, Walsh needs to know why that hasn't shown on the court.

NHL 

Defending champion Ducks open playoffs 
Dallas holds head-to-head advantage 5 to 3 

Associated Press 
ANAHEIM -Forget about 

the Ducks' being defending 
Stanley Cup champions. 
Anaheim coach Randy Carlyle 
has -or at least that's his 
story as Anaheim prepares to 
open its Cup defense. 
"I can't remember last 

year," Carlyle said 
Wednesday. "Every year your 
team is different. The refer­
ence to last year is old news. 
We're trying to create an 
identity for ourselves now. 
"We've got a playoff series against a very difficult oppo­nent, an opponent that has given us a lot of trouble over the course of the season." 
The Ducks, trying to become the first team to repeat as NHL champions since Detroit in 1997-98, begin the playoffs against the Dallas Stars on Thursday night in Anaheim. 
The Stars won five of eight against Anaheim during the regular season and got a shootout point in one of the losses. They outscored the Ducks 24-15. 
"They've got a good offense and they can score some big goals," Anaheim goalie Jean­Sebastien Giguere said. "They're going to be danger­ous on the power play, so we've got to not take too many penalties and not give them too many chances on the power play." 
After a slow start this sea­son, the Ducks took on the look of a champion again after Scott Niedermayer and Teemu Selanne decided not to retire and rejoined the team. Anaheim went 32-12-4 after Niedermayer came back in December, and were 20-5-1 following Selanne's return on Feb. 5 . 
Two of the wins came in their final two games against Dallas. 
"They're a different team with Niedermayer and Selanne back," said the Stars' Brenden Morrow, asked about Dallas taking the regular-sea­son series. "But if that helps guys feel more relaxed, sure." 
Dallas goalie Marty Turco, noting that the Stars are very 
familiar with Anaheim, said their confidence is high. 
"We know the type of team they are and how they're going to play. We've seem them when we've played against them and seen them numerous times on TV against other teams," Turco said. "There won't be any surprises." 
While the Ducks were surg­ing down the stretch of the regular season, the Stars were struggling. Dallas went 4-8-2 in the last 14 games to finish fifth in the Western Conference, five points back of the fourth-place Ducks. 
"We need to keep our spe­cial teams rolling, stay disci­plined, play to our strengths and not crack in the third period, something we strug­gled with late in the season," said Morrow, who had a career-best 32 goals and 74 points this season. 
Giguere, who won the Conn 
· Smythe Trophy as the 2003 postseason MVP and was out­standing in the playoffs again last year, said the series against Dallas could be a close one. 
"We know it's going to be a good matchup, there are going to be some tight games, some heavy checking and possibly some fights and stuff like that," he said. "It should be an entertaining series for the fans -and for us." 
The Stars likely will be without one of their key play­ers, at least for the start of the playoffs. Defenseman Sergei Zubov, who had sur­gery for a sports hernia injury, has been outstanding for Dallas on the breakout. 
The Ducks also will be miss­ing one of their top players, Corey Perry, although he's expected to be available later --­in the series. Perry, the team's second-leading scorer, has been sidelined by a lacer­ated leg tendon. 
Carlyle smiled and made a couple of predictions, saying, "You know there's going to be things that are going to hap­pen in a playoff series. You know there's going to be new intensity, and there's going to be panic; there always is."

Wilde a ts defeat Irish to end winning streak 
By MATT GAMBER Sports Wrirer 
The No. 8 Irish (9-4, 2-1 Big East) found out the hard way why the top-ranked Northwestern Wildcats are three-time defending National Champions and are now rid­ing a 33-gamc winning streak. 
The host Wildcats (12-0) scored the game's first 15 goals in a dominant 16-2 effort to end Notre Dame's winning streak at four games. Senior attack Heather Ferguson and freshman mid­fielder Jackie Doherty scored the only two Irish goals, as Northwestern successfully shut down Notre Dame's high­powered offensive attack. 
Junior Jillian Byers, who broke the Irish all-time scor­ing record in her last outing, and senior Caitlin McKinney, who owned a program-best 51-game point streak, were both victims of a high-pres­

sure Northwestern defense that the Irish prepared for but couldn't answer. 
The Irish were able to keep the game scoreless for the first seven minutes, but with­in a span of two minutes, the Wildcats scored three times to take a 3-0 lead. Ten minutes later, Northwestern went on another run, scoring five goals in two minutes to blow it open at 8-0. 
The Wildcats entered the half up 11-0 and added four more goals before Ferguson finally put one home with under 18 minutes to play. Northwestern scored once more before Doherty's goal with just over two minutes left to finish the scoring at 16­2. 
The Irish will look to rebound when they close out their five-game road swing at Big East rival No. 7 Georgetown.

Lux shines in Irish victory 
By SAM WERNER Sports Wrirer 

Notre Dame dominated 
Eastern Michigan in a double­
header, winning 10-1 and 5-1 
yesterday and earning their 
seventh and eighth consecu­
tive wins. 

Sophomore first baseman Christine Lux led the Irish to victory in the first game, set­ting a school record for RBis in a single game with seven. Lux started her big day off early, capping off an Irish rally a double in the first inning that drove in two runs and gave Notre Dame a 4-0 lead. 
In the bottom of the second, Lux ripped a two-out single to plate two more runs and extend the lead to 7-0. Finally, Lux ended her big day with a three-run homer to right cen­ter to put the Irish up 10-1. 
Notre Dame junior Brittany Bargar pitched four innings of three-hit ball, giving up only one run and striking out six. With the win, Bargar improved her record to 18-6 on the year. Junior Christine Farrell pitched the fifth inning for the Irish. 
Notre Dame relied on solid pitching in the second game. Freshman J ody Valdivia pitched seven innings, gave up only one run, and struck out a season-high 14 batters. 
Eastern Michigan made the

Irish work for the win this time, though. The Eagles got on the board first in the sec­ond inning when freshman Stacie Skodinski knocked a double to left-ceoter that scored junior Heather Han and put EMU up 1-0. 
Lux once again came up big offensively for the Irish, smok­ing an RBI single in the third inning to tie the game at one. 
Notre Dame waited until the fifth inning to take the lead, and when they did, it was Lux in the middle of the action. After seniors Sarah Smith and Katie Laing had already drove in runs with two outs to put the Irish up 3~1. Lux came up with Laing standing on first base. On the fourth pitch from Eastern Michigan pitcher Jaclyn Caro, Lux ripped a triple to left-center causing Laing to score. On the day, Lux finished 5-6 with a home run and nine RBis. 

The Irish are set to host Rutgers on April 12 in the newly constructed Melissa Cook Stadium. The game begins at noon.

Lilley cracked the record books amidst a two-out rally that broke the game open for the Irish. He reached base to put men on first and second for Ryne Intlekofer. The soph­omore second baseman then laced a triple down the right field line to score two. Sophomore centerfielder A.J. Pollock followed with a triple of his own to stake the Irish to a 5-1 lead. 
Irish freshman starting pitcher Hyan Sharpley surren­dered a run the first inning to give Manchester a 1-0 edge. But Sharpley and freshman righty Evan Danieli held the Spartans scoreless for the next four innings as the Notre Dame offense built an 11-1 lead by the end of the fifth stanza. 
"Our starters went out there and took care of business," Irish coach Dave Schrage said. 
Pollock went 3-for-3 with a single, double and triple before being pulled in the fifth inning for sophomore Bill Warrender. Lilley went 2-for-2 with a single and triple but was also taken out in the fifth.

CELEBRITIES BORN ON TIUS DAY: Keshia Knight Pulliam, 29; Austin Peck, 37; Cynthia Nixon, 42; Dennis Quaid, 54 
Happy Birthday: It will be the well~planned ideas that make the most difference in your life this year. Instead, throw yourself into something that will help you ad­vance physically, personally, professionally and financially and feel the satisfac~ tion of accomplishment. Your numbers are S, 12, 23, 26, 36, 40 
ARIES (March 21-April 19): Separate your emotions from work or school proj­
ects or you may fall short of your goals. A little creative accounting will help you 
financially when you need a little extra cash. 4 stars 
TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Drum up whatever help you can get. You can offer 
your idea to someone who can give you hands-on assistance but don't give away 
too much in return. This is not the time to exaggerate. 3 stars 
GEMINI (May 21-June 20): You will hook up with interesting people who will 
influence your life. Love is looking positive and the action you take today could 
very well lead to a better relationship with someone important to you. 3 stars 
CANCER (June 21-July 22): Too much talk will lead to trouble. Someone will 
try to trick you into divulging information that may hurt you later on. Listen and 
gather all the information you can to keep the upper hand. 3 stars 
LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): You can dance your way to victory today with your charm, fun-loving attitude and entertaining way of dealing with others. Learn from past mistakes and you will succeed. 4 stars 
VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Don't be too trusting with your possessions. Some­one is likely to take advantage of you, playing on your sensitivity to a situation that you are trying to resolve. If someone is asking for a handout, refuse. 2 stars 
LIBRA (SepL 23-0et. 22): Mix fun with a little serious discussion about your future plans and you will grab the attention of someone who can help you. Love is a big draw today, so remember to work on your relationship. S stars 
SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Make whatever adjustments are required at home in order to get more accomplished. A home office will help you make extra cash or get into something that will help you enhance your skills. 3 stars 
SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Give yourself a chance to catch up at home. Today is the perfect time to finish personal business. You have to make the altera­tions necessary to save money and your emotional well-being. 3 stars 
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Things won't run smoothly today so you may as well kick back and take a break. You owe it to yourself to enjoy the company of friends or to take a mini vacation. Love issues may arise. 3 stars 
AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Put time and effort into your surroundings. Adding comfort or a luxury item to your home will bring rewards in the way you are treated by friends and family. Love is looking good. 5 stars 
PISCES (Feb. 19-Marcb 20): Be careful not to show your emotions if you want to come out on top. Accepting someone's offer to help will end up costing you dearly in the future. You won't get something for nothing. 2 stars

level players in the highest-level 
evenlo; internationally, and to try to 
help American hockey. There was 
a little bit of patriotism involved in 
that, too," Jackson said. 
After stinl'> as head coach of the · Guelph Storm from the OHL and 
as an assistant with the New York 
Islanders in the NHL, Jackson 
arrived at Notre Dame, ready to 
turn around a program that had 
won five games the previous sea­
son. He never thought that they'd 
get here this quickly, though. 
"Realistically, I expect~d it to 
take us five years," Jackson said. 
"But that was accelerated by a 
great group of kids." 
Upon taking the job behind the 
Irish bench, Jackson sought to 
recreate the championship atmos­
phere he created at Lake Superior. 
That meant bringing some famil­
iar faces back with him. Soon after 
he was hired, Jackson contacted 
former LSSU assistant coach Paul 
Pooley and, in June, 2005, Pooley 
was named Notre Dame's associ­
ate head coach. The former 
Providence head coach worked 
with Jackson at Lake Superior 
from 1992-1994 and was a key to 
success on both championship 
teams. Pooley said the Jackson 
coaching at Notre Dame is no dif­
ferent than the one that led a 
small, northern school to glory in 
the early '90s. 
"Of course every coach contin­
ues to evolve," Pooley said. "But I 
think his philosophy is the same 
and from what I've seen, being 
away from him for such a long 
time and coming back together, it's 
very similar." 
Doing the little things right 
That philosophy, of course, 
means playoff success. Pooley 
attributed Jackson's spectacular 
postseason resume to his ability to 
get players to band together come 
Tournament time. 
"The main thing is his ability to 
get the guys to play together as a 
group anJ focus on the team 
aspect and the commitments nec­
essary to be successful in the 
NCAA Tournament," Pooley said. 
Jackson's focus on the team is 
evident in this year's squad, as 
Notre Dame's 10 tournament 
goals have come from eight differ­
ent players. Gilbert said that 
diverse scoring distribution was 
another similarity this team has 
with his 1992 Lakers.

Jeff Jackson knows how to win in the NCAA Tournament. His teams are always firing on all cylinders when the cal­ender turns to March and that has brought him national champi­onships. It's a pedigree that's hard to beat.  Jordan Pearce spent the second half of the season keeping the Irish in games when their offense couldn't get the job done. He not only filled the void left by Dave Brown, he excelled in it, posting a superb 1.95 goals­against average.  In the second half of the season, Notre Dame flat out couldn't score. But last weekend, the Irish figured out how to score again ­and they did it a lot. The offensive creativity they found on the big ice last weekend will need to make another appearance this weekend.  The Irish defense was decimated last season with the departure of three top­flight blue liners. That has­n't mattered as a mix of young talent (Lawson, Cole and Huth) combined with strong senior leadership (Sh~han and VeNard) allowed only 2.04 goals per game.  
Hed Berenson is no stranger to a national title either. The Michigan coach won one in 1998 and his teams are a con­stant presence in the NCAA Tournament. His team will be more than prepared for the Irish on both ends of the ice.  Billy Sauer shook off critics this year who said he underper­formed in his first two seasons, backstopping Michigan to a CCHA championship. The jun­ior is tough to beat and has yet to lose in the postseason this year.  The Wolverines defense has been overshadowed all year by their explosive offense, but don't be deceived. Michigan can play defense too, allow­ing 2.0 goals per game. Mark Mitera will be a physical presence in front of the crease, frustrating the Irish.  There is no doubt that the Wolverines can score a lot of goals. They are led by Hobey Baker finalist Kevin Porter, who netted 33 goals and added 29 assists, making him the nation's most dangerous offensive threat. Containing the Wolverines is the ultimate challenge.

Michigan Wolverines 
L£Ff WING C£NIER RIGKT~G DEFENSE 

IRISH POWER PLAY IRISH PENALTY KILL INTANGIBLES OVERALL 
Once the second half of the season started, Notre Dame's power play became impotent, going 39 straight man-advan­tage chances without scoring. The problem, however; became a non­issue after February, and the unit has performed well, if not spectacularly.  Like last year. the Irish penalty kill is one of the premier units in the nation. They successfully killed 89.6 percent of their man-disadvantages, allow­ing 21 goals in 202 situa­tions. Their box defense is tough to penetrate and Jordan Pearce allows few shotc; in from the point.  Notre Dame has had one hell of a season. They spent the first half of the year steamrolling compe­tition, then they ·wal­lowed in mediocrity for the second half. Right now, they arc surging after two upset vktories on college hockey's biggest stage.  The Irish probably never should have been here. But they are. There is no one outstanding part of their game; their suc­cess stems from their abil­ity to buy into Jeff Jackson's team-centric, no-individuals philosophy. He knows how to win, and now Notre Dame does too.  
Michigan's penalty kill gets the job done, not allowing a goal 86.9 percent of the time. They were one of the units that stonewalled the Irish during their January power-play goal drought and have the ability to do it again.  Michigan's power play was productive this sea­son, scoring on 20.5 per­cent of their chances. Just like during five-on­five play, if Porter is on the ice. anything can happen and often does. The Wolverines are cre­ative offensively but can sufl'er from selfish play.  The Wolverines spent a majority of the year as the No. 1 team in the country. then they proved they were by taking the CCIIA tourna­ment. They don't lose often and have a long tradition of success in the NCAA Tournament behind them.  Michigan has been arguably the best team in the country all season. They beat the Irish twice in the regular season, even though Notre Dame played strong in the games. They didn't struggle in winning the CCIIA tourney and walked through their regional two weeks ago.  
The Irish power-play unit against the Wolverine penalty kill will . one of the most crucial 0~1.if!fI sh (.a g g a or -m~~-ttl'*"''fl a adv -g , will swing the game. These units, however, are a dead draw.  Notre Dame must shut dowrt the Wolverines-power play. Michigan is deadly enough with {even strength that if the'lrish surrender a power play goal or fV\i<J', they will find themselves' in seri­ous trouble.

Irish forget regional, get to work against Michigan 

By KYLE CASSILY Senior Sports Writer 
At the end of one practice early last week, Irish coach Jeff Jackson ordered his play­ers to skate to the goal line, shattering any euphoria still left over from that weekend's West Regional championship. 
Jackson, who wanted to con­dition his players to handle the high altitude and low oxy­gen of the Frozen Four in 
The No. 5 Irish have a lot of work left to do when they play No. 1 Michigan tonight at 9 
p.m. in Denver in the national semifinal. Notre Dame (26-15­
4) lost twice to the Wolverines (33-5-4) during the regular season, stymied by a winning goal with 20 seconds left and then by a poor defensive per­formance in a 5-1 loss. 
The two losses to Michigan came in January at the start of a two-and-a-half month

That and led by senior Kevin Porter -a some real tough practices Hobey Baker top-three finalist early last week got that out of who led the nation in points the system." with 62 (33 goals, 29 assists). 
Porter scored four goals in the NCAA quarterfinals two weeks ago against Niagara and is joined on his line by th~ nation's No. 3 scorer, Chad Kolarik (28 goals, 26 assists). 
"It takes five guys [to stop M i c h i g an 's offe n s e I. " Van Guilder said. "It takes three forwards coming back as hard as they can ... basically it's all about keeping a good third man in the offensive zone so we don't give up odd-man rushes. Once you give them time and space like that, that's when they can be dangerous." 
Before last weekend's regional, the Irish offense was as impotent as the Wolverines' was dangerous. In the 21 games before the NCAA Tournament, Notre Dame scored only 43 goals. 
But a seven-goal barrage against New Hampshire fol­lowed by three goals in the win over Michigan State against one of the nation's top goalies in Jeff Lerg, has given confidence back to Notre Dame's snipers. 
"We were saying in Colorado Springs how nice it would have been if our forwards would have been scoring seven goals a game," Irish defense­man Dan VeNard said. "It wouldn't have been so nerve­racking on the back end." 
Michigan goalie Billy Sauer, although not a Hobey Baker finalist like Regan and Lerg, has posted a 1.89 goals­against average, fourth best in the nation. Sauer, a junior, started in net his first two sea­sons and received criticism at the start for his inability to replicate the success of former Wolverines netminder AI Montoya. 
"You don't really look at it from how good the goalie is or isn't," Van Guilder said. "You just look at trying to get peo­ple in front of him because any goalie, including him, is going to stop it if he can see it, so· you want to get traffic in front of him like we did to the other guys. Make him go post to post, side to side, all of that." 
Irish goalie Jordan Pearce will start in net as he has done nearly all year, posting a 1.9 5 goals-against average while keeping Notre Dame in close games when the offense could­n't score. 
This is only the fourth time in Notre Dame history that a men's team has advanced to an NCAA final four or champi­onship tournament: The first three were men's basketball in 1978, men's lacrosse in 2001 and baseball in 2002. 
The puck will drop 9 p.m. Eastern Time at the Pepsi Center in Denver and will be televised on ESPN 2.
