Resolution for gay group not valid 
By THERESA HAR­RINGTON News Staff 
Saint Mary's student govern­ment learned Monday night that a resolution which it passed last week allowing a group calling itself Gays and Lesbians at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's <GLNMMC) to use a room at the College is in­valid. 
Last Tuesday night Eileen Hetterich, the College's stu­dent body president, was shown a letter by Saint Mary's President Bill Hickey which he had sent to GLNMMC Oct. 6, 1986. 
The letter stated: "We can­not serve as a co-sponsor for programs or activities planned by the GLNMMC. If the Col­lege, as a Catholic Institution, were to provide sponsorship, it would be recognizing the homo­sexual lifestyle as an accep­table one, which it is not in the eyes of the Church." 
The College's official policy regarding the group was estab­lished in the fall by Hickey when he received an identical request for a room from GLNMMC. 
After a discussion, members of the Council agreed to stand by their original vote, which they acknowledged can serve only as a recommendation to Hickey. 
Said Hetterich, "President Hickey is the official represen­tative of the institution, and as such he is the only who can set school policy."

Large voter turnout for SMC hall elections 
By MARIA DOTI Staff Reporter 
Voter turnout increased by 29 percent in this year's hall elec­tions at Saint Mary's, following the decision made by the Col­lege's student government to move the polls to the dining halls. 

"We had more tickets this year than last year," said Eileen Hetterich, Saint Mary's Student Body President for next year. "And we had 41 per­cent of the student body vote as opposed to less than 12 per­cent last year. Our goal was to generate interest, and it looks like we did." 
The dining hall proved to be a beneficial move for the polls. Election Commissioner Frannie Thompson said, "Everyone has to go to the dining hall at least once a day, and this way, students don't have to go out of their way to vote." 
The results of the elections were as follows: 
The 'Drew Crew' consisting of Terry Drew, Erin Haggerty, Kerry McMonigle and Katie Kearny defeated the ticket of Pam Raque, Sheila O'Grady, Jill Verdun and Shannon Reidy in the race for LeMans Hall Council. 
Forty-three percent of next year's residents voted. Out of these, the Drew ticket received 69 percent of the vote, while the Raque ticket received the remaining 24 percent. 
"We were very pleased by the large voter turnout," said Erin Haggerty. "We hope it's indicative of the strong support we'll receive next year." 
In the Holy Cross race, the ticket of Jill Tomko, Kim Sar­tori, Andrea Receski and Karin Rader will run against the ticket of Patti Swain, Sue Ber­tucci, Sandy Hickey and Chris Deckel in a run-off. 
"The heat is still on in Holy Cross," Tomko said. "We're urging everyone to come out and vote on Wednesday."

Shultz holds talks with Shevardnadze 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz held three rounds of talks Monday with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, taking up the critical issue of nuclear arms reductions at an un­scheduled late night session. 
There was no immediate word on the outcome. At the California White House, mean­while, presidential Chief of Staff Howard Baker Jr. said he would not be surprised to see a decision on a superpower sum­mit emerge by the end of Shultz' three-day visit. 
The Soviet news agency Tass, however, accused Wash­ington of"a fresh cock-and-bull story" of Soviet espionage at the U.S. embassy in Moscow. The dispatch said the Pentagon came up with the "spy scare" in an effort to undercut the State Department. 
Charles Redman, the State Department spokesman, said Shultz and Shevardnadze brought their arms control ex­perts to the evening meeting. 
The meeting was held after a Passover Seder attended by Shultz at the U.S. embassy with about 40 prominent Jewish "refuseniks," -people who have been refused permission to emigrate. 
Shultz attended the Seder, which recalls Jewish deliverance from slavery un­der the Egyptian pharaoh, to demonstrate continued U.S. support for Soviet Jews. He told them U.S. citizens are praying for them. 
Shultz and Shevardnadze held two rounds of talks Mon­day morning and afternoon to try to stabilize relations in the midst of a bitter exchange of spy charges. 
Those sessions and a working lunch were held at a Foreign Ministry guest house about a mile from the Kremlin. Sunny skies, melting the little slush left, spoke of spring. 
A special van was set up to provide secure communica­tions for Shultz to Washington and for meetings with his staff. The United States has accused the Soviets of infiltrating the embassy with the collusion of some U.S. marine guards and gaining access to classified materials. 
About three dozen reporters and photographers were taken on a tour of two rows of red­brick townhouses where Amer­ican diplomats have lived since late last year. Construction on the new embassy building stopped in 1985. 
President Reagan said last week the new, $191 million em­bassy complex might have to be torn down. 
Shultz planned to complain to Shevardnadze about a "pattern of intrusiveness and hostility." But he also said before coming to Moscow on a three-day visit that he wanted "to find our way to a more constructive relation­ship" and to lower the level of nuclear weapons. 

Stark chosen to be ND leprechaun 
By JIM WINKLER Staff Reporter 
After surviving a month and a half of tryouts, Brian Stark, a Zahm Hall junior from Erie, Pennsylvania, has been named the Notre Dame leprechaun for 1987-88. 
Stark was chosen following final tryouts Saturday by a panel of judges consisting of members of the Athletic De­partment, guests from the American Cheer leading Asso­ciation, and Jeff Anhut, the leprechaun two years ago. 
Stark said he was surprised at being selected, but he also felt "very thrilled by it and complimented by it." "Until that sign was posted, I was very anxious and worried. To be chosen from a group like this is an honor," he said. 
Stark said he was selected because he showed the judges that "I am an average student at Notre Dame, but I can put life back into the spirit that brought all of us to Notre Dame." 
According to Stark, he and the 20 contestants initially began tryouts in March. Each contestant could be no taller than 5 feet 7 inches, he said. 
Each contestant also had to pass a strength test in addi­tion to performing a tradi­tional Irish jig, an innovative Irish jig, and an improvisa­tion routine, he added. 
Six finalists were then cho­sen and asked to return on Saturday for a final viewing. 
At the final viewing, Stark performed a six and a half minute skit in which he acted out the development of a leprechaun. Stark described the routine as "a progression of the leprechaun from some­one who was unsure of himself and lacked direction, to some­one who was a strong symbol of what Notre Dame is all about." 
Stark said he developed the routine from ideas that he had sought out from his friends and other students about what the leprechaun should do. 
"What I did in my tryout was what a leprechaun should do," Stark said. 
Stark said he was inspired to try out for the position be­cause the Notre Dame spirit he had dreamed of in grade school and high school was lacking. 
He said last Halloween, stu­dents paid money to leave campus and party at another college. "I felt like, hey, this is our campus. We should have fun here." 
Stark said he wants to con­tribute something substantial to the University. "I decided that I was leaving here in thir­teen months or so, and I wanted to try and help bring back the spirit of Notre Dame, and make this place as thrill­ing as it used to be." 
The new leprechaun said he has many plans for next year, including coordinating c> "Greased Lightning" routine with the band. 
Stark said he wants to get alumni involved in the spirit

Now, I don't get much mail, so any letter is lucky. (I'm one of the few people who read their balance statements from the Notre Dame

Columnist urges activism for peace 
By KATIE SULLIVAN 
Staff Reporter 
Colman McCarthy, synd­icated columnist for The Wash­ington Post, said, "We should study peace like we study sci­ence or computers." 
Introducing himself at Mon­day's lecture at Carroll Hall as a "journalist, a writer, a liberal and a citizen of a country we should all be worried about," McCarthy said, "We should study Ghandi, Jesus, King and Day, for example, and by their ideals learn to be nonviolent." 
The lecture, titled, "Working for Social Justice: Should We Bother?" was sponsored by the Saint Mary's Department of Sociology and the Writing Proficiency Committee. 
According to McCarthy we should all be bothered with the extraordinary amount of vio­lence in our society. 
The lecture consisted of a slide show presentation with narration that McCarthy and several of his peace studies stu­dents produced. The presenta­tion which began with Joan Baez's "Where Have All the Flowers Gone" displayed an array of photos and quotes from well-known pacifists like Gandhi, Jesus, Rankin, and Einstein. 
The presentation touched upon the issues of defense spending, possible ecological disaster, and what the narrator of the presentation called "mis­leading" advertisements pre­sented to the public by the armed forces. 
"People are learning they can't be all they can be. The whole story is not being told," said the narrator of the presentation. 
McCarthy said the purpose of his presentation was to arouse people to strive for a nonviolent society. ''A good way to begin to decrease violence is by in­stalling peace-study programs in our schools," he said, add­ing, "A marvelous gift from the class of 1987 would be 200 signa­tures petitioning for peace studies programs." 
McCarthy concluded the presentation by giving what he called "three essentials (necessary) to be effective (in applying your) social ideals." 
The first essential is a sense of prayer, he said. "It should be prayer that asks what God wants from you; it demands risk." 
A sense of service was cited by McCarthy as the second es­sential. According to McCarthy, this consists of using skills to ease other peoples suffering. 
The final essential which McCarthy dis~ussed is what he called a "sense of exorcism." By "exorcism" McCarthy said he meant the "actual driving out of anythirlg that is violent." 
"The key to all of this is to make a commitment to non­violence and decreasing suffer­ing," McCarthy said. 
With this commitment, McCarthy said, "We should start small. 
"For example, start with your friends and roommates, and if you succeed in decreas­ing suffering, widen the circle and move on," McCarthy said.

Hinckley corresponding with mass murderers 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Presiden­tial assailant John Hinckley Jr wrote to serial killer Theodore Bundy and obtained the ad­dress of mass murderer Charles Manson, a psychiatrist said in surprise court tes­timony Monday. 
Hinckley, who is trying to convince a judge his mental ill­ness is in remission, recently wrote Bundy to "express his sorrow" about the "awkward position he must be in" on Florida's death row, Dr. Glenn Miller testified in U.S. District Court. 
The stunning testimony prompted a bench conference during which Hinckley's lawyers told the judge Hinckley may still have the let­ters he received from Bundy, who is awaiting execution for three 1978 murders, according to a transcript of the private conference. 
Miller also testified that Hinckley, 30, received a letter several years ago from Manson follower Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme, asking him to write to Manson at a California prison. 
He said Hinckley declined but obtained Manson's ad­dress. 
Miller's unexpected tes­timony came at a hearing on Hinckley's request to make an unescorted 12-hour Easter visit to his family from the mental hospital where he was sent for shooting President Reagan. 
The psychiatrist, who was testifying on behalf of Hinckley, cited these incidents as examples of lapses in Hinckley's judgment. 
Miller's disclosure appeared to stun and anger U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker and federal prosecutors, who had subpoenaed Hinckley's letters, diaries and medical records, including psychiatrists' notes from St. Elizabeths Hospital. 
Hinckley has been held at St. Elizabeths since 1982, when he was found innocent by reason of insanity in the March 30, 1981 shooting of Reagan, White House Press Secretary James Brady, a city policeman and a Secret Service agent. 
The Secret Service was in­furiated when it learned Hinckley had visited his par­ents under hospital escort for 12 hours on Dec. 28. The presidential security force said last month it considered Hinckley still a threat.

Tutu urges defiance of speech ban 
Associated Press 
CAPE TOWN, South Africa -Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other clergymen urged people at a special prayer service Monday to defy new limits on speech and assembly. The U.S. ambassador was among 700 people in the congregation. 
Ambassador Edward Perkins issued a statement saying: "It is sad that a gov­ernment which claims to up­hold the values of human dig­nity, and which portrays itself as secure and strong, should be so intimidated by the peaceful protestations of its citizens that it declares those protestations to be illegal." 
Perkins' attendance and his statement represented one of his most vivid gestures since he became the first black American ambassador to South Africa last November. 

The ambassadors of Canada, Sweden and Austria also atten­ded the ecumenical service dedicated to people detained without charge under a nationwide state of emergency the white government imposed 10 months ago. 
Regulations issued Saturday by Police Commissioner Johan Coetzee make it a crime to call for release of detainees by word, action or in writing. Gatherings in support of detainees also are banned. Penalties for breaking the rules range up to a fine of 20,000

Tutu, the black prelate who is Anglican archbishop of southern Mrica, organized the service. He was joined at St. George's Cathedral by Jewish and Dutch Reformered church members. 
Although Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said prayer services at churches were not prohibited, Tutu and his colleagues openly violated a section of the rules making it a crime to urge other people to support detainees. 
Tutu said he would make· similar statements inside or outside church. 
"I will continue to urge, as I do, the authorities to release all detainees or bring them to court, and I hope you support me in such a call," he said, ap­parently leaving himself open to incitement charges. 
Coetzee issued a statement Monday saying the regulations did not bar prayers for detainees at "bonafide religi­ous gatherings" or prohibit po­litical candidates from ad­dressing the detention issue in speeches. 
Vlok's latest regulations join a long list of emergency rules that restrict reporting about unrest and the treatment of detainees.

Sentences toughened, made more uniform 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The U.S. Sentencing Commission issued guidelines Monday to increase prison terms for many federal crimes and force judges to sen­tence people convicted of such offenses according to a uniform set of regulations. 
The guidelines are designed to wipe out wide disparities in penalties for similar offenses. 
"We want to take the two ex­tremities of our justice system, the hanging judge and the Baby Ruth judge, and pull them in together," commission Chair­man William Wilkins, a federal appeals court judge, told a news conference. Because of "unwarranted disparity" in sentencing, he said, "fairness is sometimes lacking." 
Wilkins also said the 
guidelines require that corpor­
ate executives convicted of 
antitrust offenses serve prison 
terms. Currently, only 28 per­
cent of those convicted of 
antitrust offenses are sent to 
prison. 
The certainty of doing time 
behind bars is intended to serve 
as a deterrent to businessmen, 
Wilkins said. 
The guidelines also are ex­
pected to cause a 10 percent in­
crease in the federal prison 
population over the next 
decade, the commission said. 
That population is now 42,000, 
a 75 percent jump since 1980. 
The guidelines, which will 
take effect on an experimental 
basis late this year, will in­
crease prison terms for rob­bery, fraud, forgery, drug vio­
lations and a host of other crimes. 
In addition, new federal laws now going into effect target drug dealers and repeat of­fenders with a background of violent crime for longer prison terms. 
The commission approved the new sentencing system on a 6-1 vote over the weekend, and it now will be reviewed by Congress before going in effect. 
Commissioner Paul Robin­son, a Rutgers University pro­fessor, dissented, saying that "the guidelines treat identi­cally offenses that are of very different seriousness . . . The commission has chosen ... to mimic the mathematical averages of past sentences." 
Bank robbers would have an­other three months added to their terms by the guidelines, two months would be added for fraud and forgery, and eight months would be added to the terms of heroin dealers. Cur­rently, bank robbers serve an average of 44 months, those convicted of fraud and forgery serve just under seven months, and heroin dealers serve 29 months. 
Congressional and other crit­ics predict the commission's approach to sentencing will overwhelm already overcrowded prisons. Wilkins has acknowledged that the guidelines will cause some rise in prison population, but he in­sists it will not be significant. 
Judges who depart from the guidelines have to cite ag­gravating or mitigating factors in writing.

P.O.BoxQ 
Education must involve values of our society 
Dear Editor: 
In Gregory Maggetti's March 10, Viewpoint column, ("College students losing sight of world issues"), he wrote about a crisis in college education. As our society has placed an emphasis on individualism, so has college education been used to serve the ends of enjoying a materially rich life rather than a spir­itually rich one. Or, as a wise man once said, college education is viewed today as a means of making a living rather than making a life. 
There seems to be a wide gulf be­tween college and the outside world. The liberal arts education, a bedrock of the college education, is seen as relic from a dead age, an anachronism that cannot be applied to one's life. Many feel that history, theology, philosophy, literature and the other disciplines of liberal arts are solely the realm of scholarly high-browed elites , who wield their "education" as a merit of the high distinction of "culture." Cer­tainly a liberal arts education cannot enrich one's life, the realists contend, particularly because one is unable to find a decent job upon graduation with a liberal arts degree. 
As Maggetti points out, we must eval­uate our classwork, research and ex­tracurricular activities and decide "whether they reflect a spirit of commitment to the common good." While vocational training can only be applied to the professional aspect of one's life, an education can enrich one's life beyond measure. If the disciplines that we study are to have any affect on us, we must embody them in our lives. They cannot be left behind in the class­room and in the texts; our education must become an integral part of our lives. 
In addition to the issue of the college education and social justice that Mag­getti treats, I would like to mention an additional effect that an education can have on the individual. Not only can an education help us to confront the prob­lems that the world faces, it can also give us the tools to solve the problems that we encounter every day. Without some ethical and moral foundation to rely on, we can become lost in these times of sexual promiscuity, drug abuse and familial breakdown. If col­lege amounts to a glorified vocational­technical school, as Maggetti points out, we will become ethically and morally impoverished. If anyone ought to encounter the world with a strong set of ethical and moral responsibility, it is the college student. 
Given the notion that a college edu­cation can enrich one's life and that many do not seek to have such an ex­perience in college, one must wonder what is the purpose for going to college if it is not to have one's life enriched. Does one go to college in order to train oneself for a future high-paying job, or enroll with the rationale of seeking an education? Obviously, there are two different schools of thought on this issue. One must look further into the

issue of the "well-rounded education." 
Does the handful of liberal arts require­
ments for graduation at Notre Dame 
constitute a well-rounded education? 
Or are they an example of the future 
"educated" elite, a case of disciplines 
that are offered to help one impress 
others with one's sense of culture? 
The crisis in college education seems to stem from the isolation of the values of an education from the values of so­ciety. If we are to make college rele­vant to today's world, we must be able to relate it to our current condition, and not to see an education as a means to a vocation, but as a means to making ourselves better people and enabling ourselves to construct a better world. The ideas which the liberal arts treat are not dead; they are alive in our world today. It is our duty to become, through our education, as Maggetti writes, "open-minded, well-informed, and cri­tical citizens of the world."

once again becomes obvious that the D-6 parking lot is too small. For those of us students who park there all year round, it is very frustrating not finding a space on any afternoon and having to park along the road leading up to WNDU. 
I think there is a simple solution to 
the problem. There is a large field be­
tween D-6 and the road leading to Car­

part of it? Enough say to fit 30 or 40

Jazz Festival proves enjoyable to students 
Dear Editor: 
I was surprised to read in Monday's inside column that Mark McLaughlin "managed to do nothing socially con­structive this weekend." He must have missed what I felt was the finest social event on. campus in recent memory ­the Collegiate Jazz Festival. 
The music was great, the attendance was good, and the organizing skills of Kevin Cronin and friends were proven. 
Thanks guys for a fun weekend.

'Ugly' Americans take 
bad rap 

A group of us were walking through the tube station last week. A man muttered, 'damn yankees' to us as he passed. Whether he heard us discussing Reagan and capitalism or, more likely, he just knew we were Americans, we were insulted. Why do Americans get such a bad rap in Europe? Why do they refer to us as 'ugly Americans'? 
There are hundreds of thousands of Americans in Europe. We see them in almost every city we visit. There are thousands of American students studying in London alone. For the English, it is not quite as much of a novelty to meet an American as it would be if roles were reversed­-For a Brit to visit the states. It is understandable that they feel we invade their country, yet this is due to the basic fact of the size of the U.S. and its huge papultion.

But it isn't as if Americans are the only ones traveling inEurope. When we were on the continent, we met students from every country traveling to every country. We met some Australians who were spending two months in Europe. 
Maybe it is because Americans seem to be easily iden­tifiable. After a week here we could pick them out a block away.

Texaco files for bankruptcy; future uncertain 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Texaco gained ground in its multibillon-dollar legal war with Pennzoil Co. by filing for protection under federal bankruptcy laws, analysts said Monday. 
In taking the step, Texaco relieved itself of the necessity of posting a potentially debilitating security bond against the roughly $11 billion judgment won by Pennzoil against Texaco in a 1985 Hous­ton jury decision. 
That removed a negotiating club that Pennzoil had been wielding over Texaco, giving the White Plains, N.Y.-based giant oil company plenty of time to negotiate a settlement, they said. 
This benefits Texaco because the more time it has, the more chance it has of winning a reversal of the decision, and the more time Pennzoil has to wait to get its money, or some part of the award. 
Even if Texaco eventually loses the fight, it still stands to be better off, said Bruce Lazier, an analyst at the Pres­cott, Ball & Turben Inc. secur­ities firm. 
"Pennzoil could win the final suit. But it's up to the bank­ruptcy judge to determine how much Texaco is going to pay," he said. 
In addition, Lazier noted, Pennzoil will have to stand in line for its money with other creditors whose claims are not backed by Texaco assets. 
In announcing the move Sun­day, Texaco officials insisted the company will be conducting business as usual while reor­ganizing its finances --a view some industry watchers sug­gested was optimistic at best. 
"It's not mirrors. It's not per­ception. It's a real bank­ruptcy," said Richard Lieb, a bankruptcy specialist at the Kronish, Lieb, Weiner & bel­lman law firm. "Texaco's got real problems." 
Texaco Chairman Alfred C. deCrane Jr. sought on Sunday to calm the fears of companies with which it does business.

Dow falls 51.71 points; traders fear inflation 

NEW YORK -Stock prices fell sharply Monday, as a late selloff in blue chips accelerated a broad decline in a market haunted by worries over rising interest rates and inflation. 
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down more than 51 points last week, fell 51.71 to 2,287.07. 
The average's drop was its fourth-largest daily loss ever. 
Prices in the broader market were widely lower for most of the session. Decliners outpaced advancers by nearly 7 to 1 on the New York Stock exchange, with 285 up, 1,429 down and 284 unchanged. 
Texaco fell 3% to 28 1/2, leading the NYSE most active Jist with 12.6 million shares changing hands, and Pennzoil plunged 15IJ4 to 77. 
Chemical New York fell 2 to

High on that list is Pennzoil, which won a 1985 judgment that Texaco wrongfully interfered with a merger agreement be­tween Pennzoil and Getty Oil Co. and then acquired Getty it­self. 
A houston jury awarded Pen­nzoil $10.53 billion in damages, since reduced to $8.5 billion, but with interest it amounts to about $11 billion. 
Texaco faced a Texas state requirement that it post bond equivalent to the award --or an amount suitable to Pennzoil -­while appealing the verdict. 
Texaco said it filed under Chapter 11 after failing to agree with Pennzoil on a bond that would not destroy its busi­ness.

Dow charts changing stock market 
By JOHN WHOLIHAN Business Writer 
Summer is almost upon us. Undergraduates are probably wondering about summer jobs. Seniors are anticipating their careers. 
Finance majors are familar with one way to invest their earnings from these jobs. But few engineers, accountants and English majors consider the stock market as an invest­ment alternative. 
The New York Stock Ex­change has been the topic of much discussion during the first quarter of 1987. 
Investors have had reason to both smile and worry. Although the Dow Jones average has climbed to record highs, volatility and insider trading scandals have rocked the mar­ket. 
1987 is expected to be a con­tinuation of the current bull market. A bull market is a market whose value is rising. 
Located on Wall Street in New York City, the Exchange is most famous for its daily transactions of approximately 2000 stocks. 
The most popular measure­ment of the Exchange's prog­ress is the Dow Jones Industrial

Average (DJIA). The DJIA is composed of a price-weighted average of thirty stocks. 
The thirty stocks that make up the average are "blue chip," that is, they are well-known in their respective industries. IBM, McDonalds, and Proctor & Gamble are three of the stocks included in the DJIA. 
Besides the industrial average, Dow Jones also has transportation and utility averages. 
Carolina Freight Corpora­tion and Delta Airlines are two of the twenty stocks that make up the transportation average. The utility index consists of fif­teen stocks, including Southern California Edison and Philadelphia Electric. 
The money invested in this bull market comes from two types of investors: institutions and individuals. 
On the institutional side, many corporations and mutual fund companies have placed a higher percentage of their available funds into the mar­ket. 
The weak U.S. dollar has also sparked Japanese investment in the market. 
These groups have one thing in common. They want to in­vest where they will receive a high rate of return. Institutions cannot hold cash when there is the opportunity for large gains in a bull market. 
The current situation has also led the individual investor to take advantage of the stock market's average long-range return of nine percent. This is much better than the passbook account rate of five and a quar­ter percent found at most banks. 
One can see the major role low interest rates have played in the bull market. 
The bull market has wel­comed many new individual in­vestors; however, those indi­viduals who were in the market before 1983 have enjoyed ex­ceptional profits. 
To understand how the mar­ket evolved to Monday's DJIA close of 2287.07, one must look back to late 1982. 
The Dow was approximately at 1200 and started to move up­ward. Of course, one of the major factors that influenced this growth was the improve­ment of the economy. 
As the United States moved out of the recession unemploy­ment came down, as did inter­est and inflation rates. 
The market tends to rise if future expectations of the eco­nomy are positive. Since 1982, expectations have been high and the bull market has been in full force. 
The Dow approached 1900 before tumbling to ap­poximately 1700 in September of 1986. 
The slump was short-lived, however, as the market rebounded to 1960 by the start of December. 
The Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal encouraged stock holders to sell, and con­sequently, the Dow fell and finished 1986 slightly below the 1900 mark. 
The inside trading investiga­tions are continuing, but inves­tors' fears have subsided. 
Many investors also sold their securities at the end of 1986 to take advantage of the tax situation. 
Capital gains, profits made on selling stock held for more than six months, are no longer taxed at the special rate of twenty percent. 
Instead, they are now taxed as regular income, usually at twenty-eight percent. 
The market opened 1987 with the Dow reaching thirteen con­secutive new highs. The thirty­third new high was recorded April 6, with the Industrials closing at 2405.54. 
A recent raise of the prime rate has worried some inves­tors that interest rates will begin to increase. 
Most institutional traders are afraid to pull out of the bull market, though, which is a good sign for the individual in­vestor. 
How high will the market go before this phase of the bull market concludes? Nobody knows for sure. 
Provided that interest rates do not rise dramatically, the current market should be looked upon as a viable altern­ative for your investment dol­lars.

Lanza, Spmell highlight Y elovich's line 
By PETE GEGEN 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Recognition and respect do not come easy to an offensive lineman on any football team. But there is a growing trend on the Irish squad to combat those perceptions. 
Consider that the team voted center Chuck Lanza and right tackle Byron Spruell co­captains for the upcoming season. Not since Rocky Bleier of the 1967 team have the cap­tains come from the offense alone, and never have the cap­tains come solely from the line. 
"It's unique," says offensive line coach Tony Yelovich of the captains. "It's the first time I've been in a situation like that. Both are very dedicated academically and athletically, and they set fine examples for the players."

with a time of 49.42 and was the anchor leg of the victorious 1,600-meter relay team of senior Robert Nobles, sopho­more David Warth and Brown. Trailing at the start, the relay came from behind and stole a victory at the tape with a time of 3:13.8. 
Nobles and Warth finished fourth and fifth, respectively, in the 800-meter run. Both ran a 1:51.4 to finish one of the closest races of the day in a virtual tie. 
Freshman Mike O'Connor and junior Nick Sparks ran 3:51 and 3:52 to place fourth and fifth, respectively, in the 1,500­meter run. Junior Rick Mulvey took third in the steeplechase with a time of 9:17. 
Itwas a disappointing day for the field events as freshman Tom Kraus threw 53-2 in the shot put to finish fifth. 
Brown placed second in the 200-meter dash with a time of 
Both Lanza and Spruell saw extensive playing time last season, and Lanza was named an Honorable Mention All­American. 
It is interesting to note, however, that prior to last season both these players had

seen only a limited amount of playing time. In fact the entire offensive line was relatively in­experienced when Yelovich took over as the coach. An 18­year veteran of offensive lines, Yelovich whipped the players into a crack unit which, as a credit to its performance, went without much recognition. 

Now Yelovich is looking to use the experience gained by last season's starters as well as the developing talents of several reserves. 
The only starter lost to graduation is right guard Shawn Heffern. Freshman Jeff 
Pearson was expected to be the main challenger for the spot, but he has been suspended with Jason Cegielski and John Zaleski for the entire spring drills. 
Into this spot steps freshman Tim Grunhard, a 6-4, 240-pound freshman from Chicago, and Dean Brown, a 6-4, 250-pound freshman from Canton, Ohio. An ankle injury to Brown, however, has left Grunhard in the top position, with Vesey Wilborn backing him up. 

21.1, dropping a close race to Andre Phillips, an independent sprinter ranked number-one in the world last year in the inter­mediate hurdles. 
Phillips was not the only ath­lete running independently in the Stanford Invitational this weekend. Sprinter Valerie Brisco-Hooks and long jumper Jackie Joyner participated in the women's competition and several world-class athletes were on hand to challenge the men. 
"I was pleased with our per­formance against some great competition," said Irish head coach Joe Piane. "There were world-class people sprinkled throughout the whole meet." 
Times were affected by the strong headwind that chal­lenged the runners as they came down the home stretch to finish line, but weather condi­tions were considerably better than those faced in Bloomington last weekend. 
"I think things went well," said Piane. "It was a success­ful meet and things really im­
as time went on."

"The problem is really sol­ving itself," says Yelovich. "Both of them (Brown and Grunhard) are in an equal po­sition, and both have a great opportunity to start." 
At left tackle, Tom Rehder is the returning starter, but com­plications from pneumonia has kept him out of drills the entire spring. The opening has given the opportunity for senior Pete Rokich, who is returning after sitting out the fall season with a back injury, and Marty Lip­pincott to challenge for a spot with the first string in the spring drills. 
"Both of them are about equal," says Yelovich. "Pete started slow, but now he is really starting to pick up the 
offense." 
Tom Freeman returns to the left guard slot, and Ted Healy is backing him up. Chuck Kil­lian backs up Spruell at right tackle, and with center James Baugus out with a serious back problem, Steve Huffman has moved to second string behind Lanza. 
Rice takes SMU's place on schedule 
Associated Press 
SOUTH BEND -A football game against Rice will replace a canceled Southern Methodist contest in 1988, Notre Dame announced Monday. 
The game will be played at Notre Dame on Nov. 5, the date originally scheduled for the Southern Methodist­Irish game in Dallas. The change will give Notre Dame seven home dates in the 1988 season. 
Southern Methodist, whose 1987 football season was canceled because of NCAA rule violations, recently announced it will not play its 1988 schedule.

Rowing Club continues winning ways 
After upsetting Kansas over spring break, the men's lightweight eight boat of the Rowing Club defeated Michigan in a regatta hosted by Notre Dame last weekend. Nevertheless, the team still is not satisfied. 
"I was really happy about our performance be­cause Michigan's always been a nemesis, but our main goal is the Midwest Sprints, and that's two weeks from now," said Greg Shadid. "That's the biggest race of my life, and I don't want to get complacent about winning our own regatta." 
The Irish will compete in the Midwest Sprints on April 25 at Madison, Wis. Winners there will ad­vance to the NCAA Championships. 
Notre Dame had much to be pleased about in last weekend's regatta at the Mishawaka end of the St. Joe River. The men's heavyweight four was another winner for Notre Dame, and the heavyweight eight also placed among the top three. 
In its final competition of the year, the Women's 
Soccer Club placed second out of four teams in Sun­
day's Notre Dame Invitational Spring Tournament 
held at Stepan Field. 
Notre Dame went undefeated throughout the 
tournament, winning two matches and tying an­
other. The Irish defense shut out the opposition in 
all three of its matches. Indiana won the tournament 
championship by virtue of having more total goals 
than Notre Dame. 
"The defense was good, especially Michelle 
Spring's play," said Karen Logsdon. "She was just 
really good in the back, and the goalie, Helen Gil­
boy, was really good. They played a controlled 
game." 
Notre Dame tied Indiana, 0-0, in its first match 
of the day, and defeated Loyola, 3-0, in its second 
match. Joy Sisolak, Jane Titterton, and Susan 
Haling scored for the Irish. 
The Irish then knocked off Saint Mary's for the 
first time in three tries this year with a 1-() triumph. 
Sisolak scored the winning goal for Notre Dame. 
"We really are strong and aggressive, and we 
had a really good attitude," said Logsdon. "I think 
that's why we did really well. We're a young team, 
and we just played tough." 
Club president Kate Titterton organized the tournament, which was hosted by Notre Dame. 
The Men's Volleyball Club ran into two surprises during the past week--one surprise which was pleas­ant and one that was not quite so pleasant. 
In last Tuesday's match against Ball State, a var­sity team ranked eighth in the nation, the Irish won a game from a varsity team for the first time and nearly took the match as well before falling, 15-9, 14-16, 15-11, 15-11. 
"It was probably our best match all year," said Club Vice-President Mike O'Grady. "It was a case of playing up to our level of competition." 
The Irish were not able to carry this momentum over to last weekend's Midwest Intercollegiate Vol­leyball Association championships at Wheaton Col­lege in Chicago. Notre Dame had hoped to reach the finals, but instead placed fourth out. of Reve'lteen 

Steve Megargee 
Club Corner 
teams, losing to eventual champion Illinois State. 
"We played all right, but not well enough," said O'Grady. "We thought we could win, but we came up short. Everyone gave a great effort. The com­petition was right where we thought it would be, and the matches were tight. It was about what we expected, but we couldn't pull it out." 
The Irish get another chance at knocking off a nationally-ranked varsity team tonight at the ACC Pit. Notre Dame will put its 26-7 record on the line against IUPU-Fort Wayne at 7:30p.m. IUPU-Fort Wayne has already defeated Notre Dame earlier this year, but the Irish feel more confident facing varsity teams after the Ball State match. 
"A lot oftimes there's been an intimidation factor when we play varsity teams, but we conquered that by playing a close match with one of the top teams (Ball State)," said O'Grady. 
Mter winning two of three games in the season­opening ND Tourney, the Fastpitch Softball Club split two doubleheaders last week, giving the team a 4-3 record going into the Easter break. 
The Irish beat Marquette, 5-0, and Lake College, 
11-0, while losing to Purdue Calumet, 9-6, in the 
tournament, which was eventually won by Mar­
quette. 
In the first doubleheader, Notre Dame beat Lake · College, 9-4, in the opening game but lost the second 
game, 2-1. The Irish then lost the first game to St. 
Joseph's (Rensselaer), 10-3, and won the second 
game, 7-6. 
"We have a really young team with a lot of fresh­
men and sophomores and only one senior,'' said 
Club President Barb Mooney. "We're improving a 
lot, and the freshmen are getting into it a lot more." 
The Irish have been boosted by a strong pitching 
staff featuring Mooney and freshman Susan Fenn. 
The staff was depleted last year following several 
injuries. 
The Irish have one more tournament this year 
and seven more doubleheaders through the begin­
ning of May. 
"We're looking pretty good," said Mooney. "A 
lot of the club teams are folding, so it's hard to get 
a good schedule, but we should fare pretty well 
against the teams we are playing." 
The score of the Rugby Club's victory over 
Northwestern Saturday at Stepan Field appears 
close, but according to Club President Quentin Wil­
liams, the 18-17 score in this case is deceiving. 
"I thought we dominated them basically," said 
Williams. "They scored a couple of times right at 
the end, and we kind of let down. The referee let 
the time go a little bit long." 
Chris Quigley scored twice for the Irish, and Sean 
Higgins also turned in a solid performance for Notre 
Dame. 
The B side also downed Northwestern, taming 
the Wildcats by a score of 4-0. · 
The Irish will be on the road at Michigan State 
this weekend, then return home to host two more 
matches this spring. 
stages of the game before Brown picked up the pace and had the fast break rolling, Brown assessed his first game in this year's Bookstore tourn­ament. 

"I'm tired," laughed Brown. "I just came from (spring foot­ball) practice, but I shot OK though. We'll do what it takes to win -today we ran the break well." 
Party At Chips When We Repeat was in championship form yesterday as it blew away Dick Vitale's All-Universe Team, 21-5. Steve Beuerlein led Party At Chips with eight points, and Mike Kovaleski added seven as the defending champions ran a smooth fast break and controlled the boards in another big victory. 
"We want to repeat," said Beuerlein, "but we're out here to have a lot of fun, too. Today the crowd was obviously against us, as usual, but that made us work a little harder." 

Who's Next...Who Cares looks ahead to the fourth round after pummeling Team No. 557, 21-3, and UGD II cut down 5'­10" Guys, 21-9. Both winners turned in true team efforts in their wins -the kind of play that carries a team in the later rounds. 
The Cool Team was down­right cold, as was their op­ponent, 4 Fags and a Zahmbie, in a game won by the Fags, 21­
10. The winners shot 21-of-61, while the losers shot 10-of-66. 
New Order exterminated Rat Pack, 21-13, behind Joe Hills' eight points and six rebounds. Teammate Ray Blajda pulled down 10 rebounds for New Or­der. 
George Stewart's eight points paced Verkler Construc­tion to a 21-11 victory over More Anonymous Freshman. If Verkler and 'Da Brothers of Manhood both win Wednesday, the two teams would meet in a star-studded game in the Aus­tin Carr Sectional champion­ship next Tuesday. The game would feature a matchup be­tween former Notre Dame bas­ketball teammates Jim Dolan and Royal, and a meeting be­tween Head Coach Lou Holtz and flanker Brown. 
Today's games will finish up the third rounds of the tourna­ment. The fourth round, featur­ing the addition of referees, begins Wednesday and resumes next Tuesday.

ous, 21-19, in a dramatic game on the Bookstore courts. Armed and Dangerous played a tough zone defense that neutralized 4 Slamma's inside game, but Flannery stripped the ball from a fast-breaking Armed player, and tipped in a Scott Hicks' miss to send his team into the fourth round. 
"Armed and Dangerous came out prepared and played very tough," said Hicks, who scored six points. "We are going to have to play tough against these teams, but we're here to go all the way to the finals." 
Carte Blanche grounded Jumping and Jerking, 21-9, be­hind Tony Rice's 8-of-9 shoot­ing. Well, shooting isn't exactly the word -six of Rice's points were on slam dunks. That per­formance is two short of the Bookstore Basketball record of eight dunks in a game, held by former Irish and present NBA star Orlando Woolridge. 
Da' Brothers of Manhood, with Tim Brown but without Donald Royal, destroyed Team No. 124, 21-7, behind Kim Adams' six points and Brown's 5-of-6 shooting. Da' Brothers shot 21-of-33, hitting with ease from the outside in the early

leg injury. Gallo said that the injury is a day-to-day thing. 
The Irish came back in the second game behind a heavy hitting attack and a solid effort from starting pitcher Brian Piotrowicz to win, 8-6. The freshman right-hander went the distance, allowing only three earned runs in seven in­nings to raise his record to 2-3. 

"Brian Piotrowicz was put into situations where the defense broke down," said Gal­lo. "We didn't catch some fly balls and didn't make some plays in the infield, and they got back in the game. Piotrowicz had the bases loaded and one out at the end, and he got out of it." 
Chris Flynn had two hits in the game, including a home run, to drive in three runs and score two runs. Tim Hutson continued to have the hot bat, slamming a two-run homer for

the game-winning RBI. 
Notre Dame's hitting attack that had produced 49 runs in four games ended on Sunday. Tulane pitcher Sam Amarena, who had pitched over fourteen innings in a game just four days earlier, looked like he had been rested for weeks. Irish outfielder Scott Rogers led off the game with a single up the middle and eventually scored, but that ended the Irish offen­sive highlights for the after­noon. Amarena hurled a one­hitter, striking out twelve 
batters, as Tulane won, 7-1. 
The Irish have a chance to improve their record in four road games this week and a home doubleheader on Easter Sunday. Notre Dame will be at Valparaiso today at 2:30p.m., at Purdue tomorrow at 2:30 p.m., and at Detroit on Satur­day for an afternoon doubleheader before returning to Jake Kline Field for a doubleheader with St. Joseph's. 
Valparaiso defeated the Irish earlier in the season, 9-5, at Jake Kline Field. 
"Valparaiso beat us pretty solidly here, so the players will be anxious to play them again," said Gallo. "Purdue has a very good hitting club. Detroit's kind of struggling this year, but they always are anx­ious to play Notre Dame, and they beat us four times last year. 
"These games will play a very integral part on how we end up the season. There's still a great opportunity to have a good season. We're starting to play better. We're starting to get to the point where we were when we got back from Texas."

Women's tennis splits, hosts Western Mich. 
By SHEILA HOROX Sports Writer 
Mter splitting matches against Toledo and Eastern Michigan over the weekend, the Notre Dame women's ten­nis team hosts Western Mic­higan tomorrow at 3 p.m. 
On Saturday, the Irish defeated Toledo, 7-2, by taking five of the six singles matches and two of three doubles matches. 
Three singles matches went three sets apiece, and the Irish fared well, winning two of those three. Stephanie Tolstedt defeated Missy Buck, 3-6, 7-6, 6-1, and Alice Lohrer defeated Ann Harrah, 7-6, 5-7,7-5. Junior co-captain Michelle Dasso was upended, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (9-7 tie­breaker), by Lisa Donnelly. 
Although Dasso has not seen things go her way in singles ac­tion, she and partner Lohrer are on a tear in doubles play. They defeated Donnelly and Harrah, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4. 
"That was the best match they've played since the Ohio State match,'' said Head Coach Michele Gelfman. "They hit the ball hard and they took the shots that they wanted to." 
While Dasso and Lohrer's doubles play has been nothing short of spectacular, Tammy Schmidt and Resa Kelly remain a model of consistency, winning three of their last four doubles matches. 
The singles play of Natalie Illig has been another bright spot for the 6-8 Irish. Illig was the only player to win both her singles matches over the 
Yankee great Mantle hospitalized 
Associated Press 

IRVING, Texas -Baseball Hall of Farner Mickey Mantle was in fair condition Monday after being hospitalized for ~best pains, a hospital spokes­woman said. 
Mantle's condition was upgraded from serious to fair early Monday, said Sharon Peters, spokeswoman for Ir­ving Community Hospital. She said Mantle was in the inter­mediate coronary care unit. 
The former New York Yankees' great released a brief statement through hospital of­ficials. 
"I'm tired, but I'm feeling fine," he said. Peters said Mantle indicated he would have no other comment. 
Mantle, who lives in Dallas, was stricken late Sunday on a Delta Airlines flight bound for Dallas-Fort Worth Interna­tional Airport, said Ramona Bevir, a hospital spokes­woman. Paramedics met the flight. 
She said doctors confirmed that Mantle did not suffer a heart attack. 
In December, Mantle ended his association with Del Webb's Claridge Hotel Casino at Atlan­tic City, N.J., where he was director of sports promotions, primarily handling public rela­tions and playing golf with casino customers.

weekend. Against Toledo's Lisa Ambrosetti, Illig won, 6-4, 6-1. Illig then defeated Eastern Michigan's Gina Radeck, 6-4, 6-0. "Natalie has come a long way in two years," said Gelfman. "She plays with a lot of intensity and she's learning to turn a defensive situation into an offensive one. 
"Overall, I think the team is playing relatively well. Some­times our play is sporadic and we have trouble getting every­one to play well on the same day, but I'm sure that will work itself out." 
Wednesday's match against Western Michigan should be another close one. During the fall season, the Irish lost, 6-3, but Notre Dame is counting on the strong doubles play and the home court advantage to even up the score.

15 games mark opening I "l of Women's Bookstore 



By ANNE GALLAGHER Sports Writer 
Women's Bookstore Basket­ball opened yesterday on both the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's campuses. 
Games ran smoothly except for a few minor injuries accor­ding to chairwoman Barbara Tull. For some players high winds seemed to hamper play, however the holding off of the rain was welcomed by all the competitors.

"The competition was good and everyone played fair," said Suzi Sullivan of Now I Know How Joan of Arc Felt. 
Most players agreed that the level of competition the courts was very high, but their main objective was to just go out and have fun. 
Exciting action could be found at Notre Dame on the Lyons courts. The Fast Break Five defeated Robie's Heroes, 21-4. The Fast Breakers broke away in the first half with a 10-0 lead, but the Hereos were not conquered so easily as they came out with some coura­geous defense in the second half before finally giving in. 
Cynthia Guickuien led the Breakers, hitting 9-of-16 shots, and teammate Vicki Buth added five buckets to secure the victory. 
Two runners set records at Stanford

Running against the wind-­that is what the Notre Dame track team overcame to set a new school record at the Stan­ford Invitational. 
The Irish encountered strong winds on the West Coast Satur­day, but that did not stop junior Dan Garrett and sophomore Ron Markezich from breaking the school record in the 5,000­meter run. 
Garrett placed second with a time of 14:10.6, crossing the finish line a fraction of a second behind Mark Olsen's winning time of 14:10.5. Markezich ran a 14:11 to place third as both Irish runners qualified for the IC4A Championships and erased the old school record of 
14:23 set by Mark Novak in 1980. 
Freshman Glenn Watson placed third in the 110-meter high hurldes with a time of 14.5 and helped the 400-meter relay team of junior Tony Ragunas, freshman Yan Searcy and junior Tim Brown finish second and qualify for the IC4A's with a time of 41.8. 
Searcy added a fifth-place finish in the 400-meter dash

"We want to cruise through the tournament on our height and good looks," said Patti Briody of the Fast Breakers. 
A total of 15 games were played and five were forfeited. Two of the forfeited games were because of injuries, but most of the teams managed to scrape by the competition with minor cuts and bruises. 
"The games seemed to run smoothly and the tournament was well organized," said

"Tulane is one of the strongest programs in the country, year in and year out," said Irish head coach Larry Gallo. "Playing a team like that, it's a big win for our pro­gram. We played well in the one we won; however, we lost the other two."
