SMC,ND social commissioners join hands 
by Maureen Sajbel Senior Staff Reporter 
The Notre Dame and St. Mary's hall social commis­sioners joined forces this week in an effort to improve and facilitate communication in planning inter-hall and inter­school activities. The newly formed organization, the Notre Dame-St. Mary's Social Com­mission Council (SCC) will hold bi-monthly meetings in the Campus Ministry office in Badin Hall. 
The sec as a whole does not plan to sponsor social events, according to Mary Hesburgh, Lyons Hall social commis­sioner, but would give hall commissioners a chance to get together easily to plan inter­hall activities. 
Notre Dame's SCC formed last year during the Alcohol Awareness Program. "The commissioners didn't ~ven know each other then," stated Jack Hart, Holy Cross Hall social commissioner. "We first got together for the awareness program, a cam­paign aimed at de-emphasiz­ing alcohol in social situations on campus." 
The Notre Dame SCC voted this month to invite the St. Mary's social commissioners to join in their meetings, and Monday the commissioners from both schools met for the first time as a whole. At this meeting the members decided to add the list of St. Mary's social activities to the sec calendar in LaFortune. 
The Student Union Social Commission is a separate organization, but does have a connection with the sec through liason member, Tom Haller, Howard Hall social commissioner. 
"We co-sponsor social events with the hall commis­sioners," said Orest Deychak­wisky, Student Union social commissioner, "and so far its been working out really well." The Student Union co-spon­sored a square dance and a concert with Howard Hall and a block party with Keenan Hall. 
The new SCC consists of 26 members -22 from Notre Dame and 4 from St. Mary's: These members were appoint­ed by their respective hall presidents and councils. 
Organized Labor needs student input 
by Jean Fremeau Copy Editor Ed Sadlowski, a "rebel" leader ofthe United Steel Workers Union, (USW A), yesterday called for a change in attitude toward labor unions in America and urged students to "get into the work force and become part of the labor movement." Sadlowski spoke and fielded questions on ''The Labor Movement: Past and Future" to a  whether in this country there had been real political freedom, real free education and economic freedom before the CIO. "The answer would have to be 'no'." "In 1936 a group of labor leaders put together an organization that was going to unionize industrial workers. Within three years, over five million men and women joined the ranks of the CIO." And, he said, never before and never since "has one institution captivated the imaginations and  cause the "media and schools do not really tell the true story of the working man's heritage in this country, we don't have a proper picture of what is really going today." ''If you look at the shops, union as well as unorganized, you qill find conditions are atrocious. They are unsanitary, unsafe, and gene­rally unhealthy.' Sadlowski pointed out that we would find employers randomly polluting the environment, stan­ what the working man is confron­ted with, and probably has never been confronted with," he argued. "Organized labor has one heck of a task to instill in your minds what is really the plight of the worker," he continued. By organi­zine student trade unions, he suggested, students would become aware ofthe worker's plight.

The Neighborhood Roots Pro­gram was one outgrowth of the new commission. 
Although the Academic Commis­sion is not new, it has introduced a new program. Commissioner Flor­enceanne Strigle is working with the Hall Presidents Council to establish a hall tutoring program. 
According to Strigle, the pro­gram is aimed at upperclassmen who are not provided tutoring through University programs. Although it is presently through the HPC, she hopes the individual hall academic commissioners will organize it next semester. "The response varied from hall to hall," Strigle commented. 
The Committee is also working to establish an academic policy on campus. 
Joe Ungaschick, off-campus commissioner, is attempting to provide off-campus students with more news pertaining to them. A bulletin board for their specific use has been set up in the Huddle. The purpose is to prevent these stu­dents from a feeling of separatio'l from the rest of the community. 
This year the Student Govern­ment and the Student Union are presenting a joint newsletter. Under Pete Longo, the bi-weekly publication will inform students of relevant campus topics. 
A paper drive has also been established under the direction of Administrative Assistant John Ryan. Newspapers will be picked up in residencew halls every Sun­day night. 
Alumni Representative Patty Dondanville has sent a weekly newsletter to the Alumni Board. The newsletter covers subjects not presented in the bi-weekly alumni magazine. 
Presently the Alumni Board is working on two major projects. In conjunction with the Student Union, they are developing plans for homecoming. They are also working to establish a national summer placement program for students.

Glenmary program is valuable experience 
by Jim Coyne 

Steve Dane said it was "living life with gusto". Lee Hills remark­ed that it was "a major turning point in my life", one that "solidi­fied my Christian values". Dane and Hills used these words to describe the Glenmary Home Mis­sions' summer program. 
The Glenmary volunteer pro­gram recruits high school and college students from all parts of the country to work among the poor and the needy in Appalachia and rural areas of the South. Working in groups of between 30 and 40 people, under the supervision of the Glenmary staff, the students engage in building projects: repairing and remodeling homes and also some light construction. 
Those volunteers opting for a one week program stay at the Glenmary 
Farm, located in Vancburg, KY.. According to one participant, the 
program is not all work. Volunt­teers are able to understand better the problem of poverty, and also
have the chance to learn more ~~~t0~~-culture and the people of 
One of the most rewarding aspects of the program is the community spirit that is built up among total strangers in just one week. Members of the Glenmary 
staff keep in contact with the IAI"-"'MrNWMIYW....MIYWY.I'YIWW.....I'YI'rN'a"111MM'r/VV\jMN~ 
volunteers throughout the year. Dane and Hill had only the highest praise for the Glenmary staff, because they took a personal interest in everyone involved in the program. 
Both Dane and Hills agreed that the program was a lot of work, but also a lot of fun. Dane is a five year veteran of the program, while Hills has participated twice. 
Some students were involved in the program for longer than a week. Tom Miller, a junior from Laurel, MD, worked five weeks in Jefferson, NC. After the orienta­tion at the Glenmary Farm, Miller went to Jefferson and became active in establishing a recreation program for children. This involv­ed visiting various families, and securing the use of a local school's facilities. Miller said the program was designed primarily for "kids who never had a decent break". 
Miller described his experience as "a fantastic five weeks", and added, "we saw conditions that we had previously seen only in books". He said it was a challenge to see how effective one could be in helping others. "The community atmosphere of Glenmary helped me to grow a lot," Miller stated, "and it opened my eyes.'' 
John Kuluz, a sophomore from participated in the program "to see how it really was", and to "try to help others". He called his work a "humbling experience", adding that there is an emphasis on religion in the program Kuluz also said that he found the people he worked with to be very open and honest, and very few were reluctant to be aided by the program. He said he would definitely "go 
again.'~ 
Summer is not the only time of year that the Glenmary program is in operation. The same type of program is offered for three weeks during the Christm~s break. 
Anyone desiring more informa­tion on Glenmary or any of its programs may contact Steve Dane, Lee Hills, or the Volunteer Services Office, located on the 1.5 floor of the LaFortune Student Center.

Drollinger convicted of murder 
HARTFORD CITY* IN [AP] ­Roger C. Drollinger was convicted yesterday of fir~>t degree murder in the St. Valentine's Day shotgun slayings of four young brothers. 
A Blackford Circuit Court jury of seven men and five women deliber­ated just an hour before returning the verdict. 
It was guilty on all four counts of first degree murder in the deaths of teenagers Ralph, Reeve and Ray­mond Spencer and their stepbro­ther, Gregory Brooks. Under state law, the maximum sentence is life imprisonment for each count. 
Drollinger, 24, Waynetown, identified by two co-defendants and the lone survivor as the man who ordered the nightmarish at­tack, accepted the verdict without emotion. He sat quietly, his legs crossed and glanced at the jury and the judge. 
Judge Bruce Bade ordered Drol­linger transferred to the Indiana State Prison at Michigan City and set sentencing for Oct. 17. 
"I thought he took it very well," said David Ford, one of Drollin­ger's attorney. "He's told us he's prepared for the worst and as far as he's concerned this is the worst." 
Ford said the verdict probably will be appealed. 
Chief defense attorney Michael Conway had already left to return to Indianapolis when the jury came into the courtroom with its deci­sion. 
The verdict came after 10 days of testimony _that even defense Con­way said was devastating to Drol­lihger, a man the prosecution said wanted to kill for killing's sake. 
Drollinger had steadfastly main­tained his innocence, taking the witness stand himself earlier this week to claim that he was being framed by police and used by his friends and co-defendants as a scapegoat. 
In his closing arguments, how­ever, Parks County Prosecutor C1elland Hanner said the evidence against Drollinger "has gone toge­ther like piecing together . . . a jigsaw puzzle.'' 
"There is no doubt can't be any doubt in your mind as back out in society?" to this man's guilt," the prosecutor Shaking his finger at Drollinger, told the jury. Hanner clenched his teeth and

SMC Frosh meet tonight 
by Laurie Lee Foss 
A mandatory meeting for all St. \1ary's freshmen will be held at 

7:30 p.m. next Wednesday in the <\ngela Athletic Facility. Accord­ng to Mary Rukavina, St. Mary's Student Body president, the tssembly will clarify the proposal ·or a Freshmen Council and put it 1p for a vote by the freshmen class. The proposal to replace the ;tandard four freshmen officers .vith a council of elected freshmen representatives was unanimously 
· passed by the St. Mary's Student Assembly last February. The proposal stated that one represen­tative would be elected for every 25 students, providing at least one delegate from each hall. 
The purpose of the new-plan wa~ 

to involve a greater number ot people in Student Government and to provide experienced people for p_ost!l in the coming years. Accord­ing to the proposal, workshops were to be held in the first semester to inform the elected representatives of their positions in 
Student Government. 
Because of the complaints brought forth by several members of the freshmen class, this proposal is now being reconsidered. Wed­nesday night's meeting will include an attempt to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the new council with the old system. 
Using a debate-type format, Rukavina and Nancy Mogab, senior class president, will discuss with Kathy Murphy, one of the origina­tors of the council, the pros and cons of the new system. At the

conclusion of the meeting, the subject will be opened for a vote by all freshmen. 
If the proposal for the Freshmen Council passes, plans for submis­sion of platforms and campaigning will begin shortly.

Scheduled fire drill failed in Memorial Library 
by Mark Rust 

A fire alarm system's electrical malfunction in the Memorial Libra­ry prevented a scheduled 11 p.m. fire drill from taking place by failing to alert the 2nd through 13th floors of the practice Monday night. The situation is being looked into by the Notre Dame Fire Department and they report the alarm has been fixed. 
According to a few of the 800 students who were studying in the building at the time, only the alarm on the first floor sounded. A library spokesman reported that it probably worked on a "part" of the second floor. At the time she was monitoring the second floor and waited patiently for the alarm to sound. "It didn't," she said, ... 
"just a n.e,na.uc:.., problem; 1t's just like a cPr -sometimes it won't start."

"Look, have you ever seen a fire drill in Grace of Flanner?" he asked rhetorically. "People don't leave -people pull those things (fire alarms) so often. In case of a fire the RA 's and rector would just have to go door to door and kick them out like in Morrissey last week. That's the curse of the false 
fire alarm." The library's alarm system is now reported to be in working order.

pects, Conway said, "If she saw him at the scene of the crime, where's his composite? Why did she tell detectives that there were 
only three men?" 
Conway said that Wright and Stonebraker made up the story implicating Drollinger during the period be.tween the Feb. 14 mur­ders and Stonebraker's arrest on March 8. ''They had plenty of time to talk," he said. 
Conway said the two co-defen­dant's testimony that Drollinger held Brooks by the head and fired point blank as the youth begged for mercy was "a good story" but could not have happened. 
"It enhances the horror of Roger Drollinger, but it's impossible," he said maintaining that Drollinger's hand would have been burned or 
blown off by  the  impact  of the  
blast.  
"The  purpose  is  to  create  

enough horror to keep you from thinking," he said. "To create enough horror to convict this man."

Foreign Study 
Editor's  Note:  Because  of  the  
volume  of mall  received  on  the  
foreign  study  program,  we  are  

printing exerpts from representa­tive letters. 
As a former participant in the University's Foreign Study Pro­gram in Mexico, I was · quite shocked to read in the 9/15 edition of The Observer that there are students who returned from abroad dissatisfied in their year of studies in a foreign culture. I wish to present both sides of the question which Ms. Rafferty failed to do, spending most of the available space recording complaints about the academic life abroad. 
One must first remember that the Foreign Study Programs entail just that --studying in a foreign culture under a different system with different values and goals. When one agrees to go abroad, one also agrees that he or she will attempt to assimilate the lifestyle and the language of the country he or she has chosen. 
In the United States, and es­pecially at Notre Dame, the em­phasis on academics is much greater than in other countries, say Austria or China. The idea is not to isolate oneself amid textbooks, theories, and equations, but rather experience life firsthand at the same time one is reading about it. 
A quote appeared in Ms. Raf­ferty's report stating there was little work given. The goal of Notre Dame's year abroad programs is not to spend a year in Japan emulating what one would b~ doing on a typical school night in South Bend, but experienceing a toally new and foreign culture, thereby gaining a perspective on that culture and on one's own lifestyle. If homework, research papers, and nights of endless study are what one is seeking, then one should remain at Notre Dame where those characeristics are in abundance. I can recall the remarks of Dr. Charles Parnell, Director of the Foreign Study Programs, during my freshman year to the group of students about to go to Mexico (and I'm sure they were used with the

or  she  should  not  enter  the  
program.  
When  complaints  arise  con­ 

cerning the academics of the Foreign Study Programs, especi­ally from former participants, I am led to believe that the persons making these complaints are af­flicted with a disease which is very common to the Notre Dame cam­pus. Some call it G.P.A. paranoia. People seem to worry that another person may get a better grade and therefore a better grade point average. But does a grade or an average of a person's grades make that individual? Or is it what that individual has learned and is able to apply to his or her life to make him or her a better person? A quote from a favorite book of min, 
Semi-Tough, by Dan Jenkins, makes a very valid point about this disease: "Remember, boys, there are a least eight hundred million Chinese who will never give a damn what we do." 
Professor Walter Langford, a retired professor from Notre Dame who initiated the Peace Corps in Latin America upon the request of John Kennedy and who started the Notre Dame Foreign Study Pro­gram in Mexico, has told me and countless other individuals the three goals of a year abroad: (1) to become bi-cultural; (2) to become bilingual; and lastly, (3) the academic life. 
The opinions in Ms. Rafferty's article are in a definite minority. I have yet tq talk to anyone from any program who was disappointed in his or her year abroad and I have been associating with participants from all of the programs since this semester began. Granted, the academic life abroad is not as strenuous as it is here, but there is so much more to learn that one cannot obtain from any book. When was the last time you stopped to talk to a vineyard owner in France, a flower vendor in Mexico City, or an old Austrian on a ski lift? This is the learning experience abroad, not taking notes in a biology or history class.

In Manila on Oct. 26, 1976, the Filipino Government arrested Apolonia Buenaventura. Senorita Buenaventura's arrest occurred within a week of her participation in a national referendum concern­ing President Marcos' State of Martial Law. The Marcos Regime r never disclosed a reason for Senorita IBuenaventura's arrest, nor did it formally charge her with any criminal action. 
Despite the lack of formal charges, Senorita Buenaventura remained in detention for over seven months. During these months she was helpless against the arbitrary power of the Marcos Regime. According to govern­ment policy during the State of Martial Law, all writs of habeas corpus filed on her behalf were denied. While a prisoner, Senorita Buenaventura received an im­
proper diet, was detained in aeticient and degrading prison facilities, and was repeatedly tortured. 
In South Bend on March 1, 1977, a group of concerned individuuals consisting of Notre Dame students and faculty, and of members C'f the University and of the South Bend communities at large, began writing letters on Senorita Buenaventura's behaU. The group directed its letters to President Marcos, to high-ranking Filipino government officials and to Filipino Embassy officials. The group's goal: Senorita Buenaven­tura's release from prison. 
With its letters, the group demonstrated to the Marcos Regime that international atten­tion had been drawn to Senorita Buenaventura's detention and mistreatment. It also put forth legal and hutmanitarian arguments for her release. 
In Manila early in the summer of 1977, after many letters on her behalf, Senorita Buenaventura was released from prison. To her family and friends, as well as to herself, her release came as a surprise. The release of Senorita Buenaventura is, of course, not entirely attributable to the activity on her behaU by the Notre Dame-South Bend group. How­ever, through its letters the group was able to bring considerable pressure to bear on the unlawful and inhumane activities of the Marcos Regime. 
The case of Apolonia Buenaven­tura is not unique . There are countless other men and women in the world today who are imprisoned, tortured or even 
executed ·because their opin­ions or religiOns are unacceptable to their governments. Moreover, the number of political prisoners continues to increase. The concerned individual feels power­less in the face of such wide-spread repression. However, as the group from Notre Dame-South Bend vividly illustrates, the possibility does exist for con­cerned individuals to play an important and an effective role in securing freedom for political prisoners throughout the world. 
One particular world-wide hu­man rights movement through which concerned individuals can play an important and effective role on the behalf· of political prisoners is Amnesty Internation­al. Amnesty International (AI) is independent of any government, political faetion, ideology, econom­ic interest or religious creed. AI continually works for the release of "prisoners of conscience" --men and women imprisoned anywhere for their beliefs, color, ethnic origin or religion --provided they have tl eithel';used nor advocated violence. In short, AI seeks the observance throughout the world of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Ri~hts and the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment 01 t'risoners. 
As of May 31, 1976, AI had over 1500 groups in over 30 countries working on the behalf of over 3800 prisoners ot conscience. uuring the year 1975-76 AI helped secure the release of 1600 of those prisoners. 
The concerned individuals from Notre Dame and South Bend who diligently worked for Apolonia Buenaventura's freedom are all members of Amnesty Internation­al. They, along with a number of other members of the Notre Dame-South Bend communities, form USA Group 43 of Amnesty International. Presently, the Group is working on the behalf of two other prisoners of conscience: one in Rhodesia and one in Cameroun. Also, the Group assists AI in any of its broader campaigns, such as the campaign for the over 1500 disappeared political orisoners of Chile. 

As the role of AI increases in every c~rner of the globe, AI's need for a larger and an ever more concerned membership also in­creases. Those interested in directly aiding or morally supporting AI in its world-wide humanitarian efforts are encouraged to attend the first meeting on Oct. 3 at 4:15 p.m. in 337 O'Shauughnessy. 
The logo of Amnesty inter­national consists of a burning 
candle  wrapped  in  a  length  of  
barbed  wire.  To  hundreds  of  
thousands  of  men  and  women  

politically imprisoned, AI is the candle of hope, burning in a constant vigil. Help it burn brighter and longer.

''Bubble Boy'' turns six 
HOUSTON (AP] -David, the "Bubble Boy", observed his sixth birthday yesterday at. home in his plastic isolator, with a special germ-free cake, but without the miniature spacesuit that is de­signed to expand his world. 
Doctors had hoped David would have been able to try out the suit before his birthday, but a minor hitch postponed any trials of the garment which would permit him to explore outdoor areas such as woods and beaches. 
David is a victim of severe, combined immune deficiency, which robs the body of its germ­fighting abilities. He was delivered in a germ-free area six years ago and place immeriately in a sterile "bubble unit". He has never been touched by ungloved hands. 
Last December, physicians re­ported on immunological changes that eventually may mean David is outgrowing the defect. 
Yesterday, a spokesman at Bay-

T·G·I·F· Drafts Friday 3-7 


lor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital said, "We have nothing new to report at this time. We had hoped David would have tried out the spacesuit before this birthday, but there were minor problems and it was returned to the Johnson Space Center for rework­ing." 
Birthday plans included, as they have in the past, a quiet family get-together and a so-called sterile cake", specially prepared, as is all David's foods, to be germ free. 
Despite his handicap, the boy ' reads extremely well, has a fantas­tic vocabulary and is curious and inquisitive about the world around him. 
The hospital spokesman said it was hoped that David can start making short tests with the child­size astronaut suit in October. The first of three suits was delivered some weeks ago, but doctors found it unacceptable because of a defect in the container used in moving it from the space center to the hospital. 
After the spacesuit is tested at the hospital, doctors believe David will be able to spend up to fours at a time in the rubberized garment which has a soft transparent plastic helmet. A ten-foot hose connects the suit to a ventilator mounted on a pushcart. 
David alternately spends six weeks at the hospital and six weeks with his parents and nine-year old sister, Katherine, in their ranch­style home about 45 minutes from 
the hospital. He is scheduled to

CUrre1nt armS pact f every Thursday, a small group of and disappeared in the 1937 purges~;~: 
WASHIN~liTON [AP] -Carter administration officials, with little hope of an immediate break­through in strategic arms talks with the Russians, are considering a plan to ke,ep the current treaty in effect informally and thus avoid a congressional debate over ratifica­tion. 
The proposed plan calls for both sides to simply pledge to live up to the current treaty after it expires Oct. 3. This would keep the ceiling imposed by the 1972 pact on the two superpowers' land-based and submarine-launched intercon­tinental b2Lllistic missiles. 
Several key members of Con­gress have expressed misgivings about such an arrangement because it could cut Congress out 
Congress to pass on "any action" that would place limits on U.S. 
armaments.  The  question  is  
whether  continuing  a  five-year  
agreement  amounts  to  imposing  

weapons limits in a legal sense. 
The key members have warned that if an informal 'pact is signed, they might hold hearings on U.S. military strategy, which could pro­duce a public debate on relative 
U.S. 
and Soviet strength that the administration would like to avoid. 

The congressional forces have been informed that Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance's talks today and tomoJTow with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko are not likely to st~ttle differences over U.S. cruise mis.siles, the Soviet Backfire bomber and other obstacles to a new treaty. The Soviets want to restrict the cruise misile and the 

U.S. 
wants to limit long-range use of the Ba<:kfire bomber.

Americans oppose Panama Ca~al treaty 
W ASIDNGTON [AP] -By an 
overwhelming margin, the Ameri­
can people oppose the treaty that 
would relinquish U.S. control over 
the Panama Canal, an Associated 
Press public opinion poll shows. 
The poll found SO percent of 
those surveyed said they opposed 
Senate ratification of the treaty. 
Only 29 percent favored the pact, 
while about 21 percent expressed 
no opinion. 
The opposition cut across region­
al, party, educational, age and 
income lines. 
It was the first nationwide survey 
conducted since Preseident Jimmy 
Carter and Panamanian leader 
Gen. Omar Torrijos signed the 
treaty on Sept. 7 with great fanfare. 
Despite Carter's efforts to drum 
up support for the pact, the poll 
showed he has been unable to 
convince a majority of his own 
Democratic party or the residents 
of his home region, the South, to 
back the treaty. 
These findings of widespread opposition are similar to the figures from other polls. 
The Senate is not expected to debate the treaty until next year, giving Carter at least several months to work on public opinion. The President has said he thinks support for the treaty is mounting. 
The poll was based on telephone 
interviews with 1,548 adults, con­
ducted Monday for the AP by 
Chilton Research Services of 
Radnor, PA. 
Democrats opposed the treaty by 
a margin of 44 percent to 34 
percent. That was the most 
support for the treaty among any 
party. 
Republicans opposed the pact by 
61 to 26 percent, and independents 
by 54 to 25. 
Support for the treaty was strongest among those aged 19-29 and weakest among those over 60. About 35 percent of the young adultsbackedthe pact, while only 20 percent of those over 60 supported ratification. 
By regions, support for the treaty was strongest in the East, where 34 percent favored ratification, 48 percent were opposed and 18 percent had no opinion. 
In the South, 49 percent opposed the treaty, with only 26 percent favoring it and 25 percent undecid­ed. 
Organ bench· stolen 
The St. Mary's Regina Chapel organ bench was stolen early this month. Dean of Student Affairs Kathleen Rice is appealing to the St. Mary's campus for its return, emphasizing that she is not assum­ing that the person responsible is a student. 
Rice wrote a letter to the Regina residents on Sept. 7 stating that she expected the person respons­ible to return the hand-carved German bench which belongs to the Sisters of the Holy Cross. Anyone with any information con­cerning the whereabouts of the bench should contact the Student Affairs Office. 
In both the Midwest and West, 52 percent opposed the treaty. In the Midwest 28 percent favored it and 20 percent were undecided; in the West supporters numbered 29 percent with 19 percent undecided. 
Some 36 percent of those with incomes over $25,000 a year sup­ported the treaty, the highest level of any income group. There were no other major variations in atti­tudes among income groups.

. "Are you suggesting that the presidential party was drugged?" asked Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who said the alleged incident has ''extraordinarily grave implications." 
"I'm suggesting they wanted us to review and determine whether that might have happened," Gott­lieb replied. He said he believes the incident occured in "approxi­mately 1971" and, as far as memory serves, the CIA "could not unequivocally conclude that the behavior was due to some covert drug." 
In the early 1970's, Nixon's physician was Dr. Walter Tkach. 
According to records of the White House transportation office, however, Nixon did not travel in 1971 to any countries that were considered unfriendly. 
He went to the Azores to meet with French President Georges Pompidou and to Bermuda for a meeting with the British prime minister. 
Otherwise, the records showed that Nixon left the continental United States only for brief week­end trips to friend Robert Abpla­nalp's home in the Bahamas and to the Virgin Islands for a weekend stay. 
Gottlieb also said he has seen the log of the CIA's counter-intelli­gence unit which documents more than 20 covert drug attacks by foreign agents against the diploma­tic and military attaches of the United States and other countries. 
He said that as far as he knows, LSD and other mind-altering drugs were not used because the purpose was to incapacitate the target official temporarily to steal docu­ments. 
He said such attacks were conti­nuing up until the time he left the agency in 1973.

experiments on witting and unwit­ting human subjects. 
CIA Director Stansfield Turner, who preceded Gottlieb in testify­ing, said the spy agency has voluntarily turned over more than eight linear feet of documents concerning the tests and does not now know of any others. 
But he acknowledged that many of the CIA's files have been destroyed and that others are confused and fragmented. 
The CIA director said that while he knows of no other documenta­tion, he cannot state that some might not turn up eventually. He 
said he has no information to substantiate testimony of some 
earlier witnesses that some CIA reports on the programs may have been falsified.

Gottlieb testified that before he retired he sought and received permission from then CIA Director Richard Helms to destroy much of the research records of the highly secret test which bore the code names MK-DELTA, MK-ULTRA, MK-NAOMI, MK-SEARCH, MK-CHICKWIT and MK-OFTEN.

Lance resignation neces!ary 
[continued from page 1) 
Moments after the news con­feremce, Sen. James B. Allen, D-Ata., took the Senate floor and denounced the news media for "going after Bert Lance's scalp ... Well, they've gotten his scalp. But there's a serious question whether the best interests of this govern­ment have been served." 
Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., said he thought the budget direc­tor's resignation was necessary, but added, "there's not a man or woman in this country who could stand the kind of scrutiny that Lance was subjected to." 
Rep. Henry Reuss, D-Wis., chairman of the House Banking Committee, said Lance "has done the right thing ... In an administra­tion that prides itself on the highest standards, there wasn't anything else to do." 
Carter said he hadn't yet con­sidered who might succeed Lance. But he made it clear that he doesn't expect the next budget director to have the same close relationship he and Lance enjoyed. 
He noted that going back to his days as governor of Georgia "there has been a special relationship between me and Bert Lance. 
Lance headed Georgia's trans­portation department during Car­ter's term as governor of Georgia. 
Lance, in his 350 word letter of resignation, said: ''It was and is · important that my name and repu­tation be cleared for me, my wife, children, grandchildren, and those that have trust and faith in me. I believe that this has been done. 

''As I said at the Senate hearings my conscience is clear. Second, it was and is important for me to be able to say that people should be willing to make the necessary sacrifices and be willing to serve their government and country," Lance went on. "This I can still say, and say proudly." 
''Third, I believe in the absolute need for government to be able to attract good people from the pri­vate sector. We must find ways to encourage these people." 
Lance added: 

"I hope the American people feel that during my eight months in office I have met well my respon­sibilities and performed well my tasks. This has been an important aspect of the entire matter. 
"However, I have to ask the question at what price do I remain? My only intention in coming to Washington in the first place was to make a contribution to this country and to you." 
. An informant said Carter de­layed his news conference for two hours so Lance could meet with his attorney, Clark Clifford, to work on the resignation statement. 
SMC sponsors drive for United Way campaign 

by Joan Grabowski 

The United Way campaign,an 
annual fund-raising event at St. 
Mary's, is aimed at collecting 
student donations for the St. Jo­
seph County United Way Fund. 
United Way is a nation-wide 
organization, representing com­
munity service groups such as 
Hotline, the Family and Children's 
Center, Logan Center for the 
Retarded, and Catholic Social Ser­
vices in St. Joseph County. (United 
Way represents 34 such groups in 
this county.) 
The money that is raised each 
year is allocated to the 34 groups in 
proportion to need and a particular 
group's relation to United Way 
objectives. The money is used for 
operational expenses such as: sup­
plies, salaries, utility bills and 
training. 
United Way programs are bene­
ficial to students in providing many 
varied services and educational 
internship opportunities. All Uni­ted services are available to ND/ SMC students, as part-time resi­
dents of St. Joseph County. 
Students may take advantage of the 
above programs consisting of legal 
services, alcohol-abuse programs, 
cancer projects, the Easter Seal 
program, and various health and 
rehabilitative programs. 
United Way groups provide in­
ternship for many SMC psychology 
I 

and sociology majors, who often 
serve in counseling and supervi­
sory capacities. 
In the past, the St. Mary's campaign has been based on proceeds from a SMC sponsored auction. This, according to Julie Pelletiere, SMC Development Commiflsioner, is "a good idea, but it's too gimmicky." Thus, this year's campaign will operate on a door-to-door soliciting basis. Hall representatives are responsible for collecting a one dollar donation from each resident of her hall, while off campus students are urged to contribute at the front desk in the hall of their choice. The hall raising the largest amount of money per student will receive a plaque, which will travel from hall to hall each year. Any donations will be gratefully accepted, as St. Mary's three day campaign goal is $1,000. 
Jn response to this student fund-raising effort, Dr. John Duggan, President of Saint Mary's College, feels that an impressive characteristic of the St. Mary's student is her concern for the welfare of her fellow students as well as "an extended compassion to the South Bend community.'' Dug~an stated, "the campaign prov1des the student with an oppor­tunity to actively particpate in a special way to help the South Bend community.''

He warned that America wilt' not be able to grow unless it eliminates fear and provides equal opportuni­ties for education and wealth. "If we continue on the 'dooms­day' pattern in which we are heading, we are ir. for a rude awakening." However, he conclu­ded, "we can change through the virtue of a viable, strong and agressive labor movement." Sadlowski, last year at the age of 37, challenged the leadership of USWA in an unsuccessful bid for the presidency. Lloyd McBride 
won by a margin ofless than 80,000 
votes. 
He went to work in the South 

Chicago steel mills at 18, and at 25 
was elected president of his 10,000 
member local union. Three years 
ago he was named director of his 
USWA distict. 
Sadlowski was the first speaker in the annual CArdinal O'Hara Memorial Lecture series, in which noted leaders of business, labor and education are invited to the campus for a public talk and informal discussions with students and faculty. ·

federal agencies, including the Justice Department, because irregularitit:s in his private busi­ness and banking affairs before he joined the Carter administration. Before the news conference, Carter and 1the Mr. and Mrs. Lance talked privately for 45 minutes during the early afternoon at the White House. "I'm not excited or upset;" Lance told reporters after leaving the Oval Office. While he was with Carter a policeman had tic­keted Lanct!'s car for a $5 parking violation. 

After theitr session with his boss, 

Lance walkt:d his wife back to their 
car, kissed her goodbye and went 
to his office in the Old Executive 
Office Buildling next door. 
The budget director said as recently as Tuesday that he did not intend to quit. Carter's new conference came as the Securities and Exchange Commission said it was in the "early stages" of its investigatio:n into Lance's activities as the head of the First National Bank of Calhoun, Ga., and National Bank of Georgia. 
The SEC denied a report that it was working on a civil fraud suit in the matter. 
Other probes are under way at the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Elections Commission. Included in the FEC probe are overdrafts by the committee that ran Lance's campaign for governor of Georgia in1974.

Dining hall feedback encouraged 

Maureen Eyres 

Students have a direct line of communication with food service officials via the Feedback Boxes which are located at the exits of the North and South Dining Halls. If a student has a suggestion, compli­ment, or complaint about the dining hall, he is encouraged by Edmund Price, director of food service, to complete a blue feed­back card as he leaves the dining 
hall 

P~ice stated, "The main thing to do about a complaint is to commu­nicate it to someone who can do 
something about it. It doesn't help to complain to a fellow student.'' If it is in writing, Mr. Price promises that the comment will be consider­ed. 
The Feedback Box is checked daily by the food service officials in order to get students' reactions. Each comment card is reviewed by at least four personnel, including Price, Miss Roose, the dietician, and the dining hall 'Tlanagers, each

made to include a particular item on the menu, Miss Roose reviews the recipe for the entree while the dining hall manager reviews the possibility of producing it. 
After the committee considers the suggestion, Miss Roose an­swers the student who made it, if his name is on the blue card. According to Price, "If a student is serious enough to write, then he deserves an answer." 
The more specific a student is in filling out the card, the better the committee can do its job. One card commented, "Just bad." Only the 
complaintant could know exactly what was bad. Other cards complimented the salad bar and suggested that "waffles and pan­cakes be served at Sunday brunch." 
The Feedback Box is the brain storm of the Food Services Advi­sory Council, a group of 9 students appointed by the Student Body President which meets monthly with administrators and officials of all campus food services in an effort to provide the best possible services. 
The suggestion box is not the only way Food Service officials obtain student reactions. Often Mr. Price or one of the dining hall managers eats with students and listens to their comments. Another way to find out what students like and dislike is by observing waste on their trays. 
"We want to make the students happy, this will make everyone feel better," Price commented.

! 1 Boilermakers promise aerial attack 
By Tim Bourret Sports Writer 
When major college football fans discus the best institution for producing quarterbacks Notre Dame is usually the first school mentioned. After all, the Irish have produced 13 All-American signal callers, including four Reisman Trophy winners, in their illustrious football history. 
But, a school just south of the Golden Dome has a tradition of great quarterbacks that is nearly as impressive. Purdue quarter­backs have also been selected on many occassions to All-American units, especially in the fifties abd sixties. Ironically, many of the successful Boilermaker quarter­backs have gained much of their fame through supurb individual performances against Notre Dame. 
The string of outstanding Boilermakers demonstration of passing proficiency against Notre Dame began in 1954. Sophomore quarterback Len Dawson, most remembered in football lore for his professional. exploits with the Kansas City Chiefs, led the Boilers to a 27-14 major upset victory over Notre Dame in South Bend. Dawson fired four touchdown passes tying a record for aerial scores against Notre Dame. The Purdue victory ended a modest 13-game unbeaten string for Notre Dame and ultimately cost the Irish a national championship, as it was the only defeat suffered by Terry Brennan's first team. 
Bob Griese, another profes­sional standout who led a team to a Super Bowl title, continued the tradition between 1964-66. As a sophomore in 1964 he connected on 14 of 23 passes against Ara Parseghian's initial team at Notre Dame. The Irish were victorious 34-15, but Griese had been impressive. 
The following season in West Lafayette, Griese had the greatest

The king js dead. Long live the king. 
Right now there are at least seven contenders for the throne that the Irish have vacated with their performance over the last two weeks. Michi~an, USC, Oklahoma, Ohio State, Penn State, Texas Tech and Texas all received first-place votes in this week's AP poll that ranks the Irish 11th. 
But, nothing IS to say that the Irish have eliminated themselves from the run for the crown. Only Penn State and USC do not play another team on that honor list. The Trojans, however, must play Notre Dame. 
Dan Devine and his troops have a long, uphill road if they are to return to the lofty heights accorded them m pre-season. This is still the same team that received all the ink in the early autumn but has yet to reaffirm those accolades on the field. Now, the chips are down. It's all on the table. If the Irish can put together some consistency on the field of battle and get continuity in the offensive scheme of things then they can re-join the chase for the championship. 
In order to make a true run at the top the team will have to develop the flair of a winner. They must hustle to the line of scrimmage with a cocky sort of confidence that manifests itself on every down. The team must have confidence to make the plays work offensively and throw a monkey wrench into the attack of the opposition. 
There is no longer any justification for holding back. The New York Yankees were much-maligned by the press for the better part of the summer. The Irish have been much-maligned for the last two weeks. Something called "Yankee pride" seems to have vaulted the New Yorkers into first place. It's time for some of "Notre Dame pride" to take over. The talent is there, let pride make it work. 
Talent and pride will surely be on the Purdue sideline this Saturday backed by a capacity crowd of 69,200. The game will be televised locally -on WNDU-TV at 1:30 and here is what the Irish must conquer if they are 
to start a march to regain the throne. . 
When Purdue has the ball: Mark Herrmann is the Boilermaker offense. Statistics are sometimes meaningless --not his --they're awesome. In two games he has completed 43 of 68 passes for 621 yards·· more total yards than the Notre Dame offense. The freshman phenom has single-handedly turned Purdue into one of the deadliest passing teams in the country. 
For targets, Herrmann has senior· split end Reggie Arnold who has already caught 13 passes for 224 yards and flanker Ray Smith who has snared 10 passes for 156 yards.· Fullback Joe Skibinski has been Herrmann's target on nine occasions coming from his backfield spot. 
Skibinski is the Boilers primary ball carrier with 28 carries fo~ 92 yards. His running mate is another fullback Mike Brown who provtdes added size in Purdue's pro-set attack. 
Defensively, all the weight rests on the shoulders of the Irish secondary. It is obvious that Purdue will put the ball up on every other down. How well the secondary can stand up with the constant pressure will be the key. Luther Bradley will finally get a chance to show his talents as the Purdue offense will take some action his way. At times last year and against Pitt in the opener it seemed as though the 
passing day a quarterback has 
ever had against the Irish. The 
then farm-type boy from Evans­
ville Indiana, completed 19 of 22 
passes for 283 yards against a 
Notre Dame defense that ranked 
sixth in the nation at season's end 
in total defense. HE not only 
threw three touchdown passes and 
set up the winning score with 
accurate passes, but also ran nine 
times for a better than five yard 
average and handled the punting 
and place-kicking. It was, in short, 

an old-fashioned triple threat 
performance. 

In 1966, Griese was again effective, but the day belonged to sophomore Terry Hanratty. The Notre Dame quarterback com pled 16 passes for over 300 yards in Notre Dame's 26-14 victory, earning him a share of the cover of Sports !Uustrated magazine. 
But, the following year a Purdue quarterback dominated the con­test and was selected for the cover of Sports iUustrated for his accomplishments. Mike Phipps is the only quarterback in the 89-year history of Notre Dame football to defeat the Irish three straight seasons. His pinpoint passing and deceptive play-calling helped upset the Irish three times between 1967 and 1969. 
The 1967 clash between the Irish and the Boiler was an aerial circus. Terry Hanratty cocked his arm and let fly 63 times, still a Notre Dame record for passing attempts in a game. He completed 29 for 336 yards and ran an additional 84 yards, but the Irish dropped a 28-21 decision to the Phipps-paced Boilers. Phipps threw less, but completed a higher percentage, and he hit on 14 passes for 328 yards and two touchdowns. The Purdue triumph was especially note­worthy because Notre Dame was the defending national champion and rated number-one in the preseason poll. 
The 1968 encounter was billed 

opposition was purposely throwing away from the hard-hitting corner 
back. 

The pass rush will also be an instrumental factor as Herrmann's running statistics seem to indicate that he is sackable, having rushed nine times for minus-60 yards with a long rush oi five yards. The questionable status of Willie Fry and Mike Calhoun may hurt the all-important pass rush. 
When the Irish have the ball: The Boilers. have a veteran defensive unit that has allowed only 141 yards on the ground in two games. The Irish will have to contend with the always tough Boiler defensive troops in establishing the ball control ground game that must produce successful touchdown drives. 
Vagus Ferguson left Saturday's game at Missisippi with an injury but X-rays showed it was nothing serious. Continuity in the ground game will be instrumental as Ferguson, Jerome Heavens and Terry Eurick will be called upon to provide the yardage. Rusty Lisch will again be called on to provide the dual-threat to run and pass. The Purdue defense has yielded 230 yards in the air in allowing their opponents to complete 53 percent of their aerials. The Irish will have to mix up the running and passing attacks in order to establish an offense. 
Defensively, Purdue features local South Bend product Kevin Motts. Motts, a 223-pound linebacker, led the Boilers in tackles last year. Purdue US{!S the same 5-2 system that Pitt and Ole Miss used in the two Irish encounters so far. In Marcus Jackson, a 270-pound tackle, Purdue has the big~gest lineman to face Notre Dame to date. 
Specialists: Dave Reeve continues to supply the pressure field goals for the Irish. Joe Restic has yet to return to his record-setting, freshman year form. · . 
Scott Soverene pumped home three field goals last week in Purdue's 44-7 win over Ohio U. --a modern school record. Dave Eagin Handles the punting chores and carries a 38-yard average on six punts. Again, the specialists are capable. 
Analysis: Purdue hasn't scored on the Irish in two years. Their reliance on the passing game may cost them in the crucial third-down plays insid1e the Irish twenty. Support of this would seem to be the Boilers kicking three field goals in a game they won 44-7. 
The Irish pass rush must be potent or else Herrmann will be able to pick the Irish secondary apart with his accuracy and talented targets. Given time any quarterback is effective, but, give a gifted passer time ... 
The Purdue players want this game as is evidenced by some quotes in the Purdue literature this week: Split end R<eggie Arnold --"This is my last Notre Dame game and I want to rememb,er it." Safety Rock Supan: -· "Of course 'Notre Dame is a challenge, but I feel we have a great chance to beat them." Offensive tackle MikH Barberich --"We're on the upswing now and a win over Notre Dame will certainly enhance our bowl chances." Mishawaka Marian product Kevin Motts --"It's not a question of getting ready for them for me; I've been doing that for twenty years." 
Purdue has the pride and desire to take on Notre Dame. The Boilermakers are certainly ready. Are the Irish? 
as an Elarly seaso .n Poll Bowl. Before the Irish were rated number-one by United Press International and the Boilers nuumber-one by the Associated Press. Pwrdue was victorious in the mos1~ offensive display of the 48-game series 37-22, after the two machines rolled uup a combined total of 55 first downs and 933 yards in total offense. Leroy Keyes got most of the ink for Purdue after he delighted the national television audience with his offensive and defensive heroics. But, Phipps was the real star as he hit 16 of 24 pases including· five of five on crucial third down plays. 
Phipps completed his hat tricks in 1969 against another favored Irish eJ,even. Once again he completed over sixty percent of his passes in calmly leading the Boilers to a 28-14 win. For his career Phipps completed 42 of 78 passes for 645 yards, all career records for a Notre Dame opponent. 
Since Phipps' graduation the Boilermakers have lacked an all-star signal-caller. Notre Dame has dominated the series in the seventies, winning six of the seven confrontations in this decade. But, Boiler fam; feel the draught has ended with the arrival Hoosier-grown Mark Hermann. 
The 6-Ei freshman has turned the normally mediocre Purdue offense into an explosive attack. The Boilers are ranked third in passiing and eighth in total offense nationally behind Her­mann's 43 of 68 completion accuracy.. 
Notre Dame has a bad habit of making national celebraties ou of young superstars (i.e. Anthony Davis, 1972 and Tony Dorsett, 1973). Lenny Dawson, Bob Griese and Mike Phipps all were ouutstanding in their first appear­ance against the Irish. Mark Hermann is hoping he is heir to that tradition.
