ANNOUNCEMENT

ND faculty vievvs SouthVietnam 
Graduate Student Union Election Nominations

situation vvith mixed emotions 
hy Brian M. Clancy starr reporter 

Current U.S. involvement in South Vietnam was viewed with mixed emotions by members of Notre Dame faculty. 
"We shouldn't put money into a losing cause just to soothe our consciences. I do feel, however, that we should give money for refugee relief programs and food, and that we should use our diplomatic resources to see that the North Vietnamese treat the South Vietnamese in a humane fashion," stated Prof. Peri Arnold of the Government Department. 
"Wt> should help South Vietnam in tht> best way we can, but I don't know what way that is," stated one 1-:nglish professor who preferred to remain anonymous. "But if Congress handles it," she added, ''I'm sure they'll select the wrong way." 
1;o,·<-rnml'nt and International Studies Prof. Paul Bartholomew thought. "The United States has don<> far more than any other t·mmtr~, no on<> can say that we hawn't. The U.S. is not om­nipotent however. and can not do it all alonP. WP n<>ed to create a coop<>rative effort to help South \'iP!nam; possible the U.N. can do it." 
ThPse three faculty members seemed to feel that the U.S. had not dt>sPrt<>d the South Vietnamese by withdrawing in 1972, but rather that thP l 1.S. nPver had any reason to be thPrP in the first place. 
"ThP ll.S. never had ;my vital 
mt<>rest; I was opposed to the war 
all along," statPd Arnold. 
"You can only \pan against a wall so long. before the wall falls on ~·o11. Wht>n President Nixon withdrew American forces, the 
U.S. felt that the wall was strong enought to stand by itself," he added. 
There was general agreement that the fall of South Vietnam was inevitable, hut the future of the country was seen differently. "It is more than obvious that the Thieu regime will fall," stated Arnold, "but not necessarily to a 
'idorious North Vietnamese army. I feel that a new South Vietnamese government, more sympathetic to the North Viet­namese, will probably arise. 
The professor of English said, "I think that Sou.h Vietnam will probably be taken over by North Vietnam and that they will all live happily «:>ver after in Com­munism." 
''I'm fearful for the effect that it will have on world Communism," said Bartholomew. "I was par­ticularly displeased with the statemPnt made by Congressman llayPs of Ohio yesterday, when he said 'If I WPre in West Germany and the Communists tried any agression. I'd make the best deal with thP East G1•rmans that I !'ould gPt. · This kind of statement is liablP to Pncourage the Com­munists to put America to the test of dt>f<>nding her allies." 
AnothPr point of gPneral agrPPmPnt was that President ThiPU should r!'sign. 
..I ll'd that he should resign 
imml'diatelv .'' said l'rofessor 
Arnold "H;• ~o.;hould have already 
n•signPd. aftl'r making a blunder 
as terrible as the r!'tr!'at from the 
I 'entral highlands. His govern­
mmt should haw b!'en forced from 
officP following a mistake like 
that." 
"PrPsidPnt Thieu should have never been President Thieu," added the English professor. 
"I think President Thieu should not resign until they can find a good replacement for him, but once they do, then he should resign immediately." stated Professor Bartholomew. 
A final point of general agreement was that the fall of South Vietnam was inevitable, from the moment that the U.S. withdrew. 
"I expected it to happen im­mediately after we withdrew our forces," said Arnold, "but for a while it looked like the South Vietnamese were going to hold out. 
I must admit that the recent turn of events did come as a surprise." 
"I was only surprised that it took so long to happen," commented the professor from the English Dt>partment. 
Arnold maintained that as far as America's future involvement is concerned, there can be only limited involvement without the consent of both Congress and the only limited involvement without lheconsent of both Congress and the President. 
"The President cannot deploy military forces without the ap­proval of Congress. The only time he could use military force, would be in the evacuation of American citizens from South Vietnam," he stated. Arnold continued. "In addition to obtaining the conser.t of Congress for military aid to the South ViPtnampse. he would also have to sell the idea to the American people. which would be pretty difficult. I think that the n•cent baby shutt!P may have been an attt>mpl to dramatize the situation and soften the American people up." he concluded.

St. Mary's College, under the approval of the Academic Affairs Council. will pffect a policy in accordance with the recently 1•nactPd Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. This new hill in Congress, also commonly known as thP Buckley Amend­nwnt. gives studt•nts the right to obtain any of their "t>ducational n·eords." 
Wrthin 45 days of receiving a \\TIIII'n n·quPst. St. Mary's must a IIow all pn·sent and formPr ~tudPnts to inspPct their "Pducational rPcords." These n·t·onls are broadly defined to rnl'ludt•, "rPcords, files, dol'Unll'nts. and other materials \\ l11rh eontain information directly rdatPd to a student; and are rnamtainPd hy a school or by a pPrson acting for a school." 
The law also defines certain other information as not included in the definition of "educational records" and not open to in­spection by students under federal law. Such information includes: a I the records about students made by teachers and ad­ministrators for their own use and not. shown to others; bl campus pollee records, under certain circumstances; c l employment records for college employees who arP not also current students; d) n•cords about college or over 17­yt•ar old students "created or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist. psychologist. or other rPcognizPd professional or para­profpssional acting or assisting in such capacity for treatment putpost>s, and which are available only to pt•rsons providing such trt>atment."

p.m. until 6 p.m. according to .lPrry Woznicki, campus co­chairman. April is National <'anct•r Control Month, according to Woznicki. 
"Any student interested in working on the drive should report to the Library Auditorium before 1 
p.m .. Sunday where they will be givPn information to hand out " said Woznicki. He added th~t transportation will be provided to thP particular area where the voluntPer will be working. 
Tht• students voluntt'ering will be droppt'd on the periphery of an area and work towards the center, Pach worker in tht' five man team 

Sunday 
eovt>ring about twenty houses. Wht>n tht'y rt'ach the center they will call the library and a car will bt> st'nt to bring them back to campus. 
Woznicki said that the volun­tt'ers, in going from house to house, ~ill explain the seven warning srgnals of cancer to the residents. Ht•cause it is expected that they may encounter persons who either have cancer or know someone with tht' disease, the students will haw a list of treatment facilities availablt'. 
Tht'rt' will be cancer information booths in the dining halls Friday and Saturday which students may srgn up to work. For more in­formation, students may contact eitht'r Woznicki at 3510 or Jim Hit'ker at 3601. 

A-pril designated as 'Big Person' :month 
Stevt' Kern, co-chairman of Big Brothers -Big Sisters of Notre I>amt' and St. Mary's, recently announced that April has been designatt>d as Big Brother -Big Sister Month. 
Big Brothers and Big Sisters provide adult guidance and friPndship for boys and girls aged SPVl'n to seventeen. According to Kern. these volunteers are people who have the ability to love without any strings attached. 
Kern stated that the only n•quirement to be a Big Person to a Little Person is that to be willing to take an unselfish and mature interest in another. 
"BPing a f'j'-'nd to a child who needs one can be a source of great satisfaction for you and the child," ht' rt'marked. 
Currently, there are 290 matches in St. Joseph County; about 30 of these are at Notre Dame. There are still another 350 Little Brothers and Sisters who are now waiting to be matched. 
f'or more information about the Big Brothers -Big Sisters of Notre Dame and St. Mary's, and how to be a Big Brother or Big Sister next semPster, contact Steve Kern Kt>enan Hall, room 334, telephone:' :1338. 
"One never stands so tall as when he seeks to help a child," commPnted Kern. 
vice-president for Academic Af­
fairs at St. Mary's, stated that she 
"believes it's a good idea to allow 
students access to their permanent 
record files." Mandell explained 
that "these files consist of just the 
student's transcript after 
graduation." She added that "all 
formerly active information such 
as college correspondence of an 
official nature and letters of ad­
mittance, are thrown away once a 
student leaves school." 
"As before, I will be allowt'd to 
withhold any personal notes from 
counselors, mt>dical records or 
rt>commt>ndations made in con­
fidentiality, because this in­
formation is private and is not kept 
on any permanent record by the 
eollegt'." Mandell said. "What's 
lt>ft on file after a student 
graduates is her transcript, which 
contains general information 
about the student. her academic 
n•cord. and any instance of 
acedemic probation or dismissal," 
stalt>d Mandell. 
The assistant to the vice­
president for Academic Affairs 
also admitted that "the new bill 
has made no changes in how I 
operate at all." Mandell con­
cluded, "Maybe someday the 
policy of sending pink slips home 
will be dropped, which I'm sure 
would make a lot of students 
happy." 
SMC Sophomore weekend opens
