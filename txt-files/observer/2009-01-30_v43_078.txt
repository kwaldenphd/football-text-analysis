ND Peace Corps service increases 
The University rose from No. 17 to No. 13 in the rankings with 26 alumni volunteers 
By LAURA McCRYSTAL 
News Writer 
Notre Dame jumped four spots in the Peace Corps rankings this year, moving from No. 17 to No. 13 among medium­sized colleges and universities with the greatest numbers of alumni volunteers. 
There are currently 26 Notre Dame alumni serving in the Peace Corps. George Washington University holds the No. 1 ranking, with 57 volunteers. 
This year marks the sixth consecutive year Notre Dame has been one of the top­25 medium-sized universities to produce Peace Corps volunteers. 
The Peace Corps seeks to provide other countries with the assistance of trained volunteers, encourage a better under­standing of Americans, and gain aware­ness of other cultures, according to the organization's Web site. 
Sara Snider, Notre Dame '08, is one of 800 Notre Dame graduates to serve in the Peace Corps since the program began in 1961. She began her service in Mali, located in Western Africa, 6 months ago. 
"I wanted to do at least two years of international service where I wouldn't be teaching," she said. "Also, I wanted to live in community with the people with whom I would be serving." 
Snider has lived in a small, 450-person village in the southern-most region of Mali with a host family for the past four months. 
Peace Corps volunteers develop their own projects aimed at helping their com­munities. As a small enterprise develop­ment volunteer, Snider will spend her time in Mali identifying and addressing

Conunittee to present suggestions to Jenkins 
By MADELINE BUCKLEY News Writer 
The ad hoc committee created by University President Fr. John Jenkins in the fall to address complaints about football game security is preparing to present suggestions for improvement on March 1, Committee chair Stephanie Gallo said. 
In an Oct. 14 article, The Observer reported the Committee was formed in response to complaints of aggressive behavior from police and ushers that overstepped necessary force, which took away from the game day experi­ence. 
Gallo said the Committee has been reviewing over 200 letters and e-mails from alumni, par­ents, employees and fans in order to gauge the extent of the issue. 
"This may not have allowed us to capture each and every story," Gallo said. "But to the degree possible, it allowed us the chance to sample from the population so that we could arrive at some informed gener­alizations that will guide our recommendations." 
The feedback has been both positive and negative, Gallo said. 
"Many people included very helpful suggestions," she said. The Committee also analyzed

Katherine Jones, Holy Cross Hall's former front desk worker, died on Jan. 16 after 18 years of dedicated service to the College and the students whom she came to deeply love and care for. She was 59. 
"She always tried to make every­one feel comfortable," said Bev Moyer, co-worker and longtime friend of Katherine: "She always went above and beyond the duty." 
Katherine worked the 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift Sunday through Friday. She fell in love with the residents and the hall was like her home away from home. 
Two senior Residents Assistants, Anna Hoefer, and Sarah Dalton recall fond memories of their time in the hall with Katherine. 
"We always stopped to talk to Katherine. She was always a friendly face," Hoefer said. 
St. Nicholas Day was an espe­cially important day for Katherine. She would go door to door throughout the hall leaving candy for all of the residents, Dalton said. 
"She never forgot our birthdays or Christmas. She always left us cards on our birthday," Dalton said. 
Each of the seniors said Katherine always went out of her way to make residents feel at home. 
In order to help keep Katherine's memory alive, and uphold the feeling of warmth and caring she spread throughout the hall, the RA's said they plan on continuing her holiday traditions.

INSIDE COLUMN 


Many fortns of chatting 
There are many options when it comes to communicating lately: tex­ting, instant messaging, wall post­ing, Facebook messaging, instant messaging, e-mailing, Google chat­ting. and of course, good old fash­ioned calling. Each one of these keeps us more connected, but some­times I have a difficult time deciding which to choose in certain situa­
tions.  
Although I like  
to think that my  Emma Driscoll  
main preference  
is calling, I have  
definitely noticed  News Writer  
myself more fre­ 
quently sending  
e-mails instead of  

picking up the phone. Calling can be a bit scary or intim­idating at times. 
I used to be pretty opposed to tex­ting because I thought that it was inconvenient to type everything. 
However, I now have a phone with a keyboard, and this has made me far more inclined to text. I am not sure how much other people appre­ciate me sending them texts with the random thoughts that pop up in my head throughout the day, though. 
I also have to admit that I love Facebook messages. There's some­thing about seeing that little num­ber next to my inbox and wondering what somebody has to say to me that is too personal to post but not formal enough to e-mail. I have a Meg Ryan "You've Got Mail" moment (Cranberries playing and all) with every message. There is nothing more disappointing, howev­er, than clicking on my inbox only to discover that the message is a mass message sent to everybody in a ran­dom group that I joined freshman year. 
Instant messaging is good for close friends because it allows you to have extended conversations while also doing something else. I have always felt that instant mes­sage can be a little too weird with people you don't know very well, mainly because it can be so difficult to read tone and to change the sub­ject. 
Google chatting is starting to take over instant messaging for me, but this may be because I check my e­mail constantly. It is very conven­ient, and tends to be more reliable because the people who show up on the chat list are typically checking their e-mail at that moment. 
E-mails always seem formal to me, but they are incredibly conven­ient. 
There is no perfect way to deter­mine which of these methods is most appropriate in any given situa­tion. I have often wondered whether a birthday post is sufficient or whether a text was too lengthy. 
It is hard to know what subliminal message you may be sending to the recipients just by choosing how to contact them. It is all part of the fun of communicating, though, and of trying to figure out how to form and maintain relationships in the twenty-first century.

Boy dressed as girl to cheat on exam 
SCHENECTADY, N.Y.­Dressing as a girl to take a high school Regents exam in place of another student landed a 17 -year-old upstate New York boy in some seri­ous detention. Deandre Ellis, 17, of Schenectady was arrested on a felony charge after the incident Tuesday. City school officials said a monitor verifying that each student was taking the prop­er exam suspected some­thing was amiss when the name on the test and the per­son taking it didn't match. 
District spokeswoman Karen Corona said a closer look revealed the test-taker was a boy masquerading as a girl. 
Man tries to take breast implants from ex 
VICTORVILLE, Calif. ­Prosecutors say a spurned lover ambushed his ex-girl­friend and tried to cut out the breast implants he paid for by stabbing her. San Bernardino County prose­cutor David Foy says 28­year-old Thomas Lee Rowley attacked his ex in July 2006 outside her mother's home in Hesperia, some 70 miles northeast of Los Angeles in the Mojave Desert. 
Rowley is on trial in Superior Court in Victorville for attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, stalking, burglary, and false imprisonment. 
The 26-year-old woman survived six stab wounds and the punctured breast implants were repaired. 
Rowley's former room­mate Dennis McGill testified this week that the defen­dant wanted to reclaim what was rightfully his. Rowley allegedly told McGill, "''m gonna cut 'em out and get em back."

Symposium will examine war, law 
Special to The Observer 
Martin van Creveld, a promi­nent military historian and strate­gist from Israel, and John Robb, a former U.S. special operations officer and expert on the future of war. are the lead speakers for "Of War & Law," a symposium and film festival to be held Thursday to Saturday at the University of Notre Dame. 
Speakers will focus on the dra­matic changes in warfare during the pa<>t 60 years and the result­ing challenges to international humanitarian law. 
"Wars used to be relatively sim­ple -a battle between nation­states with regular armies," said conference organizer Luc Reydams. an assistant profession­al specialist in Notre Dame's Department of Political Science and a faculty fellow of the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies. 
"But now everything is blurred, and it's hard to distinguish between war. crime. terrorism. massive human rights violations and even between war and peace itself. In this new context, the laws and treaties designed to protect civilians, wounded and sick com­batant<> and prisoners of war must be re-examined to make sure that they make sense and can be fully implemented," he said. 
The symposium begins at 12:30 
p.m. Feb. 12 with van Creveld's lecture, "The Culture of War," in the Hesburgh Center auditorium. A panel discussion will be held at 7 p.m. in the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, followed by a book signing and film. 
Events on feb. 13 begin at 
12:30 p.m. with Robb's lecture, "The Economics of Contemporary Armed Conflict," in the Hesburgh Center auditorium. A panel dis­cussion will be held at 4 p.m. in the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, followed by a book signing and two films. Two more films will be presented Feb. 14. 
Van Creveld has been on the faculty of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem since 1971. He is the author of 19 books, including "Supplying War," "Command in War," "The Transformation of War," "The Rise and Decline of the State." "The Changing Face of War: Lessons of Combat from Marne to Iraq," and "The Culture of War." 
Robb is a high-tech entrepre­neur and the author of "Brave New War," a ground-breaking book on the Iraqi insurgency, global guerrillas and open-source warfare. 
Other speakers and moderators will include Cecile Aptel. a long­time staff member of the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia; David Cortright, a research fellow at the Kroc Institute; Frederic Megret, the director of the McGill Clinic for the Special Court of Sierra Leone; Mary Ellen O'Connell, Robert and Marion Short Professor of Law at Notre Dame and a fellow of the Kroc Institute; and Jamie Williamson of the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
All symposium events are free and open to the public. More details on the symposium are available on the Web at http://kroc.nd.edu/newsevents'eve nts/upcoming. The six films are free but require tickets. Visit per­formingarts.nd.edu for more information on the films. Call 57 4­631-2800 to reserve tickets. 
lEI hires nevv research center director 
Mark Berends has done work on school organization, class instruction 
Special to The Observer 
Mark Berends, director of the National Center on School Choice (NCSC). has joined the University of Notre Dame's Institute for Educational Initiative (lEI) as the new director of its Center for Research on Educational Opportunity (CREO). 
Berends, who most recent­ly served as associate profes­sor of public policy and edu­
cation at Vanderbilt University's P e a b o d y College, suc­c e e d s Maureen Hallinan, who has directed CREO for ten years. 
Berends has done exten­sive research on school organization and classroom instruction as they relate to 
Among Racial-Ethnic Groups, 1972-1992," "Charter School Outcomes," "Leading with Data: Pathways to Improve Your School" and the "Handbook of Research on School Choice." He will teach sociology courses at Notre Dame.

U.S. Department of Education national evalua­tions and has conducted studies investigating the causes and sources of black­white and Latino-white achievement gaps. 
In the 1990s, Berends led the summative evaluation of New American Schools, at the time the largest privately funded reform movement in the nation. His latest books are "Examining Gaps in Mathematics Achievement 
the lEI. "The wealth of expertise and intellectual leadership he brings to CREO, particu­larly in the area of school choice, will enable us to make great strides in our work to give children and families greater access to excellent schools -espe­

cially faith-based schools. l-Ie will build ably upon the work of Maureen Hallinan, whose inspired leadership has built a wonderful foun­dation in the world of high impact educational research." 
Berends will continue in his role as director of the NCSC, established in 2004 through a $13.3 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences. The mission of the NCSC is to lead research across multiple disciplines on "how school choice affects individuals, communities and systems." 
"I'm excited about inte­grating the work of CREO and NCSC. In fact, CREO provides a broader umbrella for NCSC because of its emphasis on research on educational opportunity," Berends said of his transition to Notre Dame. "Together the studies that NCSC and Maureen Hallinan have undertaken position CREO to make significant contribu­tions to educational policy and the field of sociology. What's more, they provide a foundation for CREO to bring in additional funding so we can continue this line of research -research that's essential. since issues of educational equity and excel­lence will be critical for years to come." 
Hallinan served as the first director of CREO and was the first director of the lEI upon its founding in 1996. She also is the William P. and Hazel B. White Professor of Sociology, whose research has focused primarily on the sociology of education. Her most recent studies compare students' learning opportuni­ties in Catholic and public schools in Chicago. 
"We have established CREO as a center of excellence for the study of educational inequality, the organization of schools, and the effects of school sector on student out­comes. Mark Berends brings a faith vision and commit­ment to his work that will enhance and strengthen the context in which members of CREO conduct their research and teaching." she says.

Koreas declare political agreement 
SEOUL, South Korea -North Korea declared all military and political agreements with South Korea "dead" Friday, warning it would not honor past accords if Seoul contin­ues to push the Koreas to the brink of war. 
The North's Committee for the Peaceful Heunification of Korea accused South Korean President Lee Myung-bak of raising tensions on the Korean peninsula with his hard-line position on Pyongyang. It warned that Lee's stance would only draw "a heavier blow and shameful destruction." 
"The group of traitors has already reduced all the agreements reached between the north and the south in the past to dead documents," the committee in charge of inter-Korean affairs said early Friday in a statement carried by the state-run Korean Central News Agency.

The top political leader in Hamas-ruled Gaza said the group's top priority after Israel's bruising offensive was to heal the rift that has led to dueling Palestinian governments. Speaking publicly for the first time since the Jan. 18 cease-fire, Gaza Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh also expressed hope the U.S. would change its Mideast policies.

Blagojevich impeached from office 
Illinois governor first in more than twenty years to be removed from position 
Associated Press 

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. ­Gov. Rod Blagojevich was bounced from office Thursday without a single lawmaker rising in his defense, ending a nearly two-month crisis that erupted with his arrest on charges he tried to sell Barack Obama's vacant Senate seat. 
Blagojevich becomes the first U.S. governor in more than 20 years to be removed by impeachment. 
After a four-day trial, the Illinois Senate voted 59-0 to convict him of abuse of power, automati­cally ousting the second­term Democrat. In a sec­ond, identical vote, law­makers further barred Blagojevich from ever holding public office in the state again. 
"He failed the test of character. He is beneath the dignity of the state of Illinois. He is no longer worthy to be our gover· nor," said Sen. Matt Murphy, a Republican from suburban Chicago.

Turkey prime minister leaves in fury 
Associated Press 

DAVOS, Switzerland -Turkey's prime minister stalked off the stage at the World Economic Forum red­faced Thursday after reproaching Israel's president over the Gaza offensive by saying "You kill peo­ple." · 
The packed audience, which included President Barack Obama's 
'close adviser Valerie Jarrett, appeared stunned as Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and IsraeJi President Shimon Peres raised their voices and traded accu­sations. Peres was passionate in his defense of Israel's three-week offen­sive against Hamas militants, launched in reaction to eight years 
of rocket fire aimed at Israeli terri­tory. As he spoke, Peres often turned toward Erdogan, who in his remarks had criticized the Israeli blockade of Gaza, saying it. was an "open air prison, isolated from the rest of the world" and referred to the Palestinian death toll of about 1,300, more than half of those civil­ians. Thirteen Israelis also died. 
"Why did they fire rockets? There was no siege against Gaza," Peres said, his voice rising in emotion. "Why did they fight us, what did they want? There was never a day of starvation in Gaza." 
The heated debate with Israel and Turkey at the center was significant because of the key role Turkey has played as a moderator between Israel and Syria. Erdogan appeared to express a sense of disappoint­ment when he recounted how he had met with the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert days before the offensive, and believed they were close to reaching terms for a face-to-face meeting with Syrian leaders. 
Obama's new Mideast envoy, George Mitchell, will be in Turkey for talks Sunday. 
Erdogan was angry when a panel moderator cut off his remarks in response to an impassioned mono­logue by Peres defending Israel's offensive against the llamas rulers of Gaza. 
"I find it very sad that people applaud what you said," Erdogan said. "You killed people. And I think that it is very wrong."

With this information at hand, the Committee decided to approach the problem of game day security by dividing into three subcommittees that address security, customer serv­ice/hospitality and communica­tions, Gallo said. The subcom­mittees will then each present a report that focuses on its own issue. 
Gallo said she cannot give any details about the ideas that have been presented in meetings thus far, and she said the Committee is only for advisory purposes. Implementation of any sugges­tions will be Jenkins' decision. 
"Once the report is submitted and any opportunities for change are identified, the University will monitor, evaluate and adjust its practices to ensure the game day experience is the very best it can be," she said. 
After reviewing the Committee's proposal, Jenkins will submit a response and cre­ate a staff to make any changes that are deemed necessary. 
"Campus staff will work with each other to continue their efforts to make any necessary changes to our game day policy and practice," she said. 
Gallo said the Committee is committed to making positive changes so that football game day activities run smoothly. 
"The Committee has taken its work very seriously," she said. "Fr. Jenkins has brought togeth­er an impressive group with unique experience and expert­ise that should greatly benefit both the University family and the game day experience."

State glad governor's gone 
Associated Press 

ILLINOIS -People across Illinois who watched former Gov. Rod Blagojevich get the boot Thursday said they hoped removal of the scan­dal-plagued governor helps the state begin rebuilding its image after weeks of ridicule. 
"I figured it was coming," said Darlene Lewis, an investment securities repre­sentative in Chicago, after the state Senate's 59-0 vote. "He needs to be impeached. He's not above the law." 
From Chicago's famous Billy Goat Tavern to south­ern Illinois farm country, many residents said they were -weary after. weeks of watching the state become a laughingstock. 
''I'm in the camp that says, 'Finally.' I'm glad we're moving forward," said Richard Borgsmiller from his farm near Murphysboro. 
By Thursday, Borgsmiller had run out of patience with Blagojevich, believing the governor peddled influence, abused his power and showed "a little bit of arro­gance" by living in Chicago instead of the governor's mansion in Springfield. 
"From the get-go, that was 
something that bothered me," he said. 
At the Billy Goat, Gene Ciepierski considered Blagojevich's impeachment "very embarrassing." 
"[ think it's a shame that with our city and Illinois, everybody thinks we're all corrupt," Ciepierski said after watching the announcement of Blagojevich's fate, which played on all the bar's tele­visions. "To think he would do something like that, it hurts more than anything." 
Some of Blagojevich's for­mer political foes rejoiced ­cautiously. 
"Nobody is happier to see Hod go than I am, but this is not time to celebrate," said Edwin Eisendrath, a former Chicago alderman who lost to Blagojevich in the 2006 Democratic primary. "We have serious and sobering work to do before we firmly close this sorry chapter in our state's history." 
Earlier Thursday, Blagojevich's 47-minute speech to the state Senate played big in Chicago's Loop, where lunch-goers paused in front of a bill­board-sized TV screen fac­ing Daley Plaza. 
Brian David, a student at 
the University of Illinois­Chicago, found the Democrat's bid to save his job unconvincing. 
"[just don't think r believe him at all," David said. 
Chicago attorney Thomas Westgard called Blagojevich 's last stand in Springfield "hilarious and saddening. It's one of those laugh or cry things." 
"It's so shocking you don't know how to react," Westgard said. "He needs to go. They're correct to throw him out." 
At JV's Downtown Bar and Grill in Waterloo, a commu­nity of less than 9,000 peo­ple southeast of St. Louis, off-duty bartender Patrick Meegan nursed a bottle of Bud Light after watching Blagojevich get removed. 
Meegan's only surprise: That the vote was unani­mous, "a clean sweep." 
"I thought there might be a couple of dissenters," said Meegan, who voted for Blagojevich in 2002 but sided with his opponent four years later. 
"He made his plea in front of the Senate, and it didn't work," Meegan said. ''I'm glad this is done. Let's start all over. We're the laughing­stock of the country."

WASHINGTON -Democratic lawmakers inched closer Thursday to giving President Barack Obama an early health care victory as they considered extending government-spon­sored health insurance cov,.erage to about 4 million uninsured children. 
The Senate was expected to pass the legisla­tion· late Thursday after Democrats spent much of the day fending off Republican amendments.' The House plans to take up the same measure next week. 
The bill calls for an additional $32 billion over the next 4 1/2 years for the State Children's Health Insurance Pro~ram. Even with the added spending, an estimated 5 mil­lion children still will be without health insur­ance. During his election campaign, Obama called for requiring all children to have health coverage. 
The bill pays for expanding SCHIP by increasing the federal excise tax on cigarettes from 39 cents to $1 a pack. Opponents argued that the tax would hit the poor the hardest. 
Republicans opposed letting states use fed­eral dollars to cover children of newly arrived legal immigrants, saying that the immigrants' sponsors had pledged that those coming to the United States would not be dependent on gov­ornment assistance.

party activists gathered in Washington to choose the next national chairman. 
With voting slated for Friday, four candidates are trying to unseat former President George W. Bush's hand-picked RNC chairman, Mike Duncan of Kentucky. They are: former Maryland Lt. Gov. Michael Steele, for­mer Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, South Carolina GOP chairman Katon Dawson and Michigan GOP chairman Saul Anuzis. 
A fifth -former Tennessee GOP chairman Chip Saltsman -dropped out of the race on Thursday with little explana­tion, saying only in a letter to RNC members: "I have decid­ed to withdraw ·my candida­cy." 
Saltsman, who ran former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's failed presiden­tial campaign last year, was considered a long-shot candi­date who several Republican officials said likely wouldn't have had enough support even to be formally nominat­ed had he continued his bid. 
It faltered in December after he drew controversy for mailing a 41-track CD to committee members that included a song titled "Barack the Magic Negro," by conservative comediaa Paul Shanklin and sung to the music of "Puff, the Magic Dragon." Despite criticism, Saltsman didn't apologize and defended the tune as one .of several "lighthearted polit­ical parodies" that have aired on Rush Limbaugh's radio show. 
All of Duncan's challengers have spent the past few months arguing that he sim­ply represents a continuation of Bush; Duncan has argued he has the experience to make necessary changes. 
Republicans say it's all but certain no one will get a -majority on the first ballot when the 168-member RNC votes. Republicans say Duncan leads in endorse-
the party 

finds itself without a standard-bearer. Perhaps even more damaging to the GOP, the slice of the country that calls itself Republican -has shrunk over the past few years as Obama and his Democrats attracted voters of all political stripes. 
Jmplicit in McConnell's message was the concern that the Republican Party under Bush strayed from its beliefs, resulting in drub­bings in two straight elec­tions. 
While McConnell praised Bush as a man of principle, he said: "We can all agree, sad as it is, that he wasn't winning any popularity con­tests. And history shows that unpopular presidents are usually a drag on everybody else who wears their political label." 
McConnell called for the GOP to embrace its conserva­tive principles -and resist diluting its message -to bring people back and attract new rank and file. Still, he added: "It's clear our mes­sage isn't getting out to near­ly as many people as it should.... Too often we've let others define us. And the image they've painted isn't very pretty." 
He acknowledged GOP fears that certain demo­graphics from certain regions have shunned the party. And, he warned: "In politics, there's a name for a regional party: it's called a minority party."

EGYPT 
Trucks stranded at Gaza border 
Associated Press 
RAFAH -More than two dozen trucks loaded with food, aid and goods intended for the Gaza Strip werfl stranded on the Egyptian side of the border Thursday, leaving truckers with little to do but sip tea and exude frustration. 
The backlog raises ques­tions about a U.N. appeal announced Thursday which calls for $613 million to help Palestinians recover frtlm Israel's three-week offensive in Gaza and whether new aid will have much effeet until there is a deal to open the devastated territory's bor­ders. 
"The ordinary people here in Gaza are not getting enough help and are not get­ting it quickly enough," said John Ging, the top U.N. oiTi­cial in Gaza. 
lie blamed the aid shortage on the lack of access to Gaza and demanded that the bor­der crossings be opened. 
"There are thousands of tons of assistance generously donated, sitting in Egypt, Jordan and also in the ports in Israel," said Ging. "That aid should be right here, right now, helping the people who need it." 
Israeli Cabinet Minister Isaac Herzog told The Associated Press this week that Israel was letting in the maximum amount of aid that the Palestinians in Gaza can absorb -about 150 trucks per day. 
Israel closed its crossings Tuesday after a bomb attack on the Gaza-lsrael border killed an Israeli soldier. The Israeli military said the bor­der was later reopened, and 174 trucks were let through on Wednesday and 149 on Thursday. 
But the U.N. Relief and Works Agency said aid ship­ments are hitting bottlenecks on Gaza's borders with both Israel and Egypt. The agency is expected to take the lead in Gaza's reconstruction. 
Egyptian officials have not explained why trucks have 
had trouble entering Gaza through the country's Hal'ah border crossing. 
"We don't know why, but it is closed," said an Egyptian border ol'ficial Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not autqorized to talk to the media. 
The Hal'ah crossing is used primarily to transport med­ical aid and Palestinians seeking treatment, while the al-i\wja commercial crossing some 40 miles (70 kilome­ters) to the south is used to send food aid into Israel, where it will be transported to Gaza, said Mohammed Fayez Arafat, an official with the Palestinian Authority in 
Hal'ah.  lie  said  that  was  
arranged  by  Egyptian  
authorities.  

Egypt and Israel effectively sealed their borders with Gaza in 2007 after the mili­tant Palestinian group llamas seized control of the crowded seaside territory from the Fatah faction led by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Israel launched its deadly offensive in Gaza in late December to stop llamas rocket fire into its territory. 
Barnas and Israel agreed to a fragile cease-fire almost two weeks ago, but violence has picked up again in recent days and attempts to forge a longer-term truce have been hampered by dis­agreements over Gaza's bor­ders. 
Barnas has said it will only agree to a longer-term truce if Gaza's border crossings are opened. But Israel does not want Hamas to have con­trol over Gaza's borders, worried that the militant group will use the opportuni­ty to smuggle in arms. 
Washington's new Mideast envoy, George Mitchell, has proposed opening the cross­ings on the basis of a 2005 agreement brokered by the 
U.S. that puts Abbas' people in control of the Rafah cross­ing, with European monitors deployed to prevent smug­gling. 
Egypt has been exploring 

the possibility of including Hamas personnel on a bor­der team supervised by Abbas' Palestinian Authority, but that would require some _form of reconciliation between the bitterly divided 
factions. 
Without a resolution of the 
border issue, the risk of vio­
lence will remain high and it 
will be difficult to get the aid 
into Gaza that its 1.4 million 
residents need to rebuild. 
"Help is indeed needed 
urgently," U.N. Secretary­
General Ban Ki-moon said 
Thursday at the World 
Economic Forum in 
Switzerland. 
He said donations in 
response to the U.N.'s emer­
gency appeal will enable the 
organization and other aid 
groups to meet critical needs 
in Gaza for food, clean water, 
shelter, medicine and basic 
services. 
For now, any additional aid 
runs the risk of simply sitting 
in the back of a truck. 
Ahmed al-Kurd, the llamas 
government minister of 
social affairs in Gaza, noted 
that Egypt is only allowing 
medical supplies through on 
its side of the border. 
"The real demand is lifting 
the siege and opening the 
borders," said al-Kurd. 
"Food shipments cannot stay 
much longer at the borders." 
More than a dozen trucks 
packed with white sacks of 
food were stranded inside 
the Egyptian crossing termi­
nal Thursday. Another dozen 
trucks were lined up outside, 
and the drivers said they 
didn't know when they will 
be allowed in or why they 
were denied entry. 
"We haven't been told 
whether to stay or to leave­
and that's really frustrating," 
said Hassan Mohammed, 35, 
who has been waiting at the 
Rafah terminal for three 
days to deliver flour, rice and 
powdered milk for an 
Egyptian aid organization. 
"We have been waiting for 
nothing. We just need to 
unload our shipment ·and go 
back to Cairo," he said.

More A&L career help needed 
On Wednesday, the Career Center sponsored a Winter Career and Internship Fair for undergraduate students with representatives from over 100 employers. In a strug­gling economy with an unemployment rate of over seven percent, it's a compliment to the Career Center that stu­dents had the opportunity to network with such a large number of companies at all. 
But the question of the visibility of these opportunities, and whose opportunities are being emphasized, still 
remains. The companies attending the January 28 Career Fair ranged from non­profits like Amate House in Chicago, to con­sulting firms like Clarity Consulting, to financial or accounting firms such as Credit Suisse or Deloitte. Aside from the small number of non-profit organizations, most of the representatives at the fair drew from a 
limited number of industries, focusing mostly on the financial sector, engineering firms, and other similar fields. 
At a university whose largest and oldest undergraduate college is the College of Arts and Letters, the job search can be challenging for those among the 2500 Arts and Letters students who come to the Career Fair looking to capitalize on their skills. 
If the focus of the Fair, however, is on the kinds of jobs and internships that pertain to students in other disci­plines, the process feels that much more daunting.

It's essential that the Career Center avail whatever opportunities it has at its disposal to these students as they continue their job search in the midst of a gripping recession. Where these resources already exist, they must be better and more widely publicized to a greater cross­section of students. 
Hecently, the Career Center sponsored, along with a number of other universities, a series of career fairs, the Career and Internship Connection fairs, in several large 
U.S. cities, including New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles. The CIC events were meant to focus 
in their geographic area, their needs were still 
unmet. 

In order to succeed, these students, like their friends majoring in Accounting or Finance, have to be self-moti­vated. A career adviser can help students through the process of searching for jobs and internships, no matter their major, but hand-holding is not meant to be part of the Center's employees' job descriptions. 
But when students in a variety of majors feel neglected by the services that are meant to help them, or are left ignorant and misinformed of whatever resources may already exist, a breakdown in communication will only result in lost opportunities.

We are ... 
Last Saturday, after many years, change fmally came to Notre Dame. What I mean is that for the first time in recent memory, our team lost a major sporting event with­out having the student section chant 'We AreND' during the waning moments of the game. Yes, the Leprechaun Legion took the loss to Connecticut very hard, but the stu­dents as a collective did not utilize the cheer that has become far too prominent following losses. For once, our fans took the loss with grace, but it did not last long. 
By the time Monday rolled around, how­ever, change had abruptly eroded and the student body returned to business as usual inside the Joyce Athletic and Convocation Center. As the final seconds ticked away in the Irish Men's fourth straight loss, the students began the one cheer that makes me cringe more than any other. 
WE ARE [clap clap] N.D. [clap clap]. WE ARE [clap clap] N. D. [clap clap]. I don't know ifit is because the dozen or

so Marquette fans that were present start­ed a similar cheer, but our fans started to proudly proclaim who they are as ifour team had just won the game. Because the Irish hadn't won the game, however, the cheer was unnecessary and incredibly uncalled for. 
Many schools have similar 'we are' cheers, but I would be shocked ifany of their student bodies utilize the cheer in a time of defeat. Penn State makes their whole stadium shake by doing the cheer with a rousing rendition of Zombie Nation during their football games. Our rivals Boston College, Marquette, and USC have all been heard doing it after victories. Nobody can forget Matthew McConaughey using it to inspire his team to victory in the film We Are Marshall. All of these uses are much more appropriate than the way our students utilize it, and all of them show far more class. 
When Notre Dame Students utilize this cheer in defeat it is as if we are trying to proclaim our superiority over the team to which ours has just lost. The cheer inher­ently makes a value judgment over the other student body that somehow we are something that is better than them despite the outcome of the game. It is the Notre Dame students' way of saying, "It's ok that we lost the game because we are smarter than you" or "It's ok that we lost the game because we have better character than you." Regardless of who we are a loss is a loss; on this day we are not the best. The cheer is a blatant assertion of our per­ceived supremacy and when we do it as a student body it says more about what we are than who we are. When we do it in a time of defeat it says that we are cocky and arrogant. 
We collectively think that we are better than schools like Marquette and Michigan State because we have been trained to think that way. During Freshmen Orientation, the students are gathered in the JACC and told by several speakers how special we are. As a part of my Frosh­0, we were taken to Fr. Sorin's grave and given a speech about how special we are. "You didn't choose Notre Dame, Notre Dame chose you" we are told. Notre Dame Students act arrogant because from the moment we step foot on campus, we are told that we are special (which makes us think that we are in some way more spe­cial than students at other schools). 
In doing the 'we are' cheer at a time when we are losing, we become no better than our aspirational peers such as Northwestern and Stanford. I once heard Northwestern fans do a cheer that went, "That's alright, that's ok, we're gonna be your boss someday" and I instantly despised how much arrogance the cheer contained. However, our 'we are' cheer is worse because it doesn't just assume that we are going to have better jobs than the people from the other school, but it assumes that Notre Dame students are somehow better people than they are. This is unacceptable. 
While I cannot stop the student body from doing the cheer any more than I can convince Mike Brey to utilize more of his bench players, I can refuse to do the cheer. When we inevitably lose to Louisville in a couple weeks, I will again contemplate leaving the game early just so I don't have to sit through the cheer, but I will stay. I hope that more students will join me in silence next time one of our teams loses. That would be change I can believe in, and it would show people how special we are.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Surely you jest 
I grab one Observer everyday with lunch, however today I grabbed two. The fust time I read the headline 'Interhall Ice Hockey is a Joke' I covered it with regurgitated chocolate dairy bev­erage and needed a second paper. Matthew, how can I prove my hockey fanhood to you? Well I am from Buffalo, NY and we don't have much else besides hockey, enough said. So let us com­municate from one hockey die-hard to another. Matthew, you ask for more levels of hockey, I agree, give this man (and this campus) more hockey. Have an 'N league, a 'B' league, and a 'What the puck is going on' league. I would love to play intramural hockey, but I have no equipment, and took ice skating lessons in PE. You're not going to find me on the ice trying the triple-deke anytime soon. However, this is where my opinion dilfers. Lengthening the season would only make it monotonous. With a shorter schedule each game is worth much more giv­ing a playoff style atmosphere to each game. You complain that the season is too short ifyou don't make the playoffs. Quick fix, play better. My biggest issue with your letter is the idea that 'Interhall Ice Hockey is a Joke.' I mean, really? My first interhall ice hockey game was last night: Alumni vs. Zahm. Every Dawg cheered their men to victory with unrivaled intensity. The game lasted for about an hour and a half and ended with an awe-inspiring defeat of Zahm. Everyone left the game knowing that they had seen something great. Even though there were no Flying V's or Knucklepucks, there were lightening saves, dekes that pushed your concept of reality to the brink, and even a brawl. So Matthew, I agree with the notion that we need more hockey, who doesn't, but ifyou can't look forward to this great tradition then the joke is on you.

Package for our pals 
Amidst the start of a new semester, a dwin­dling basketball season, and a never-ending, controversial war on parietals, Notre Dame studentc; are consistently identifying one issue as more important than the rest: "the great squirrel quandary," as Mr. Patrick Gill called it in his recent letter. 
I am writing to tell you, fellow Domers, that while your attention to this problem is well­deserved, you are approaching it in the wrong fashion. We must not focus on solving the problem's current symptoms, as Gill sug­gests with the option of a squirrel fight, but rather tackling its causes. Clearly, the squir­rels require an unprecedented action in the form of an economic stimulus package. 
Due to poor speculation and low interest rates (commonly defined as cold and ice), many squirrels have been subject to recent foreclosures of their homes. The number of unemployed squirrels is also higher than it has been in decades as a result of Notre Dame studentc;' attempts at "going green" and thus improving their waste disposal tech­niques. 
We need to get these squirrels back on their feet and in the trees so they can lead produc­tive lives of their own without disrupting ours. I propose that the student senate pass an $80,000 stimulus package immediately. This package would include several miles of underground transport for the squirrels, grants to every squirrel family for investment and down payments on homes, and an increase in the number of fellowships to spur acorn collection and ice removal innovation. 
Of course, this package does need to be paid for. I propose an indirect tax based on flex points -for every twenty flex points spent, one point goes towards the economic stimulus package. Such a deduction will hardly be noticed by flex-point dependent students, and it will quickly provide resources for the squirrels. 
I agree with the previous writers that something needs to be done about the squir­rel program on our esteemed campus, and this package is clearly the most economical solution. If we do not act quickly and boldly, our problems will only get worse. It is our responsibility as Notre Dame students, hold­ers of a legacy, to usher in a new era of peace between ourselves and our furry neighbors.

Tonight, the combination of Chicago natives Treaty of Paris and Company of Thieves will fill Legends with their fantastic indie-rock flair. Both bands are just taking off, and the concert promises to be a great one. After tonight, we may very well be able to name Legends as the point where two incredible bands claimed their initial fame. 
Company of Thieves, composed of singer Genevieve Schatz, guitarist Marc Wallach, and drummer Mike Oritz, is a relatively new group. While known in the Chicago area, the band is still looking to make an impression farther from home. Their CD, "Ordinary Riches," will be released in February, and has the potential to be an underdog hit. Schatz has a Sara Bareilles­esque quality to her tone, and one initially expects a piano-pop love ballad to emerge in one of the early tracks. 
But instead, the band rarely uses piano in favor of an edgier, classic combination of drums and guitar, forming a harder indie rock tone. Tracks like "Pressure" and "Oscar Wilde" are sure to make the album popular, at least in some sectors. 
Their sound is fresh, combining good instrumen­tation with great lyrics. The band looks to classic things -like the writings of Oscar Wilde -as their inspiration, and has named the album a tribute to their favorite artists. After the performance here, the band will be touring with Thriving Irony. 
The better-known band of tonight's performance is Treaty of Paris. This group is popular in Chicago, and the odd video for "Waking Up the Dead" has

gained international attention. The band got its beginnings when guitarist Dan Wade and drummer Chris Insidioso met in high school, putting out a CD in 2001 with singer Mike Chorvat joining them. Treaty of Paris as it is now known, with Phil Kosch on guitar and Nick Fonzi on bass, formed in 2004 and put out an EP, Behind Our Calm Demeanors, in 2005. The EP sold well in Chicago. 
The band's first full length CD, Sweet Dreams, Sucker, was formed in collaboration with Andrew McMahon of Jack's Mannequin and Something Corporate fame. The album was released on McMahon's label this past September. Treaty of Paris will no doubt thrill the audience with great songs like "Here Goes Nothing," "Waking Up the 
Dead," and "Rollerskates." 

These songs are fun to listen to, catchy enough that you'll be singing along before the song is done, and fast enough to bop around to. The band has a pop­punk sound, much along the lines of Jack's Mannequin, Motion City Soundtrack and Fall Out Boy. 
Treaty of Paris has toured with Yellowcard, Paramore, Jimmy Eat World, and My Chemical Romance. They will soon be on tour with 
Jack's Mannequin and Fun (the band formed by two former members of the folk-band The Format). They were also on the Vans Warped tour this past June. 
So really, there's only one thing to do tonight. The show will be enjoyable and full of fresh sounds, something to be enjoyed buy both fans of the band and those who are going just because they are curi­ous.

A Look at the Screen Actors Guild Aw-ards 
And the Most Entertaining Speeches 
By STEPHANIE DEPREZ Assistant Scene Editor 
Last Sunday, Hollywood circled the wagons once more for a night of glitz, champagne, and, contrary to popular belief, real food. 
The Screen Actors Guild held their 15th awards show, commonly known as the SAGs, amidst growing discontent with the fact that actors still do not receive residu­als for work in New Media (like the inter­net) and the looming shadow of a possi­ble strike. It was ali laughs, though, except for a few pointed comments, including the speech of Tina Fey, who won the first award of the night. 
The evening started predictably enough, with Fey taking top honors for Outstanding Female Actor in a Comedy Series (no surprise there) and Kate Winslet wining for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role for "The Reader," a she had done at the Golden Globes. 
But things got tricky to predict when Hugh Laurie once again took home the Actor {SAG version of Oscar) for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series. Most would have pegged this one for James Spader of "Mad Men." Hugh Laurie even comment­ed" t~e'd bet'mBirefOn-Spader; ·and had apparently lost the bet. 
The best moment of the evening was easily Meryl Streep's win for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role. When her name was announced, she looked beyond shocked and immediately started hugging her daughter. 
Streep ran through the aisles, arms raised high in the air like a basketball player whose number had just been announced on the court. She raced up to the stage and accepted her Actor, turned to the mic and explained that she was so sure she wasn't going to win, she didn't even buy a dress. Indeed, she was wear­ing black slacks and a nice black blouse, something one would have easily assumed to be a dress if it were only seen from the waste up. 
The most poignant moment of the evening was Gary Oldman's appropriate­ly understated acceptance of Heath Ledger's award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role. 
Top honors went to Slumdog Millionaire, whose charming stars didn't fail to look completely delighted to even be mentioned. Female lead Freida Pinto looked quite beautiful in a bay blue gown, and the show's lead Dev Patel looked like a normal teenager -too tali and skinny for his own pants. 
Good news for the Notre Dame commu­nity is that "Slumdog Millionaire" film will be coming to the Browning Cinema at the beginning of March. 
Overall the show was predictable but enjoyable. The air of the evening was general relaxation. No one at the SAGs is trying to prove anything, because it is community of actors only. The voting pool of 100,000 picks who they think is best, free of producers and politics. 
Now all eyes turn to February, the Kodak Theater, and the Academy Awards. New co-producers for this year's Oscars promise a show like never before, with a new format and a host who can sing, dance, and spring claws from his knuckles. Hugh Jackman and The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences are gearing up for a great show this year, but for now, the Screen Actors Guild has done just fme.

Hugh Laurie as Gregory House in "HOUSE" 
"Thank you. This is amazing. I actually had a hundred dollars on James Spader. This is just not my night. 
"Seven years ago I was making a film in the Namibian Desert, against the advice of my agent, who was convinced that the more films you do, the harder it is to break into television. And I got a few pages of a fax -I was faxed a few pages of a script, it had no title, but I fancy that I knew instantly that this was an extraordinary character who could go the distance. That's a r,omplete lie. I had no idea. And this is absolutely amazing to me now to look back over these last six or seven years. It's been an incredible journey, and made more incredible by my, as it were, traveling companions. 
"With an incredible cast, incredible crew. I'd specilkally like to thank David Shore and Katie Jacobs, who are the hnart and soul of the show. I don't know which i'> which, that's really a casting i<;sue. I'd also like to thank Brandt Joel, Christian Hodell, and lastly, the Guild, the Guild, the Guild, you. Lastly, Brian and Susan Borg who do the craft services on "House." And they do the ftnest cheesy eggs this side of the Rio Grande." 
Meryl Streep as Sister Aloysius Beauvier in "DOUBT" 
"Thank you, everybody. Shh! Well, I didn't even buy a dress! I'm really, really, really shocked! And even though awards mean nothing to me anymore .. .I'm really happy...Okay. 
"I want to thank, oh, so many people. Miramax, Daniel Battsek, and especially Scott Rudin, who just goes out of his way to find interesting things for everybody to do, especially the girls. And, oh, can I just say, there is no such thing as the best actress. You know? There is no such thing as the "greatest living actress." I am in a position where I have secret information, you know, that I know this to be true. I am so in awe of the work of the women this year, nominated, not nominated. So proud of us girls. And everybody wins when we get parts like this." 
Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor n a Sunruuti 
Kate Winslet as Hanna Schmitz in "THE READER" 
"Wow. What a year it has been in movies. I just want to say it's really an honor to be included in what I think is such a remarkable year. And to be acknowledged by my peers in this way, I really feel like everybody should be given a medal. I have to say that because I really believe it to be true. 
I'm a bit lost for words, I'm sorry. Playing Hanna Schmitz was such a blessing, and even though it made me completely insane. And I just want to thank the cast and the crew, both in front of the camera and behind it. I just think that hard work deserves to be acknowledged, and these people really gave 100% of themselves to t~is f~m. And Harvey Weinstein for his commitment, and Stephen Daldry for his dtrectwn and support. And, of course, the late Anthony Minghelia and Sydney Pollack." 

Tina Fey as Liz Lemon in "30 ROCK" 
"I want to thank my daughter, Alice, for being the funniest person in my family; for coining phrases like, "I want to go to there." And sometimes just putting on pretend makeup in the mirror. And she'll turn to me and say, "I look like Barack Obama." She has somehow gotten it in her head that it's a good thing to resemble a famous politician. I don't know where she got that idea. But it kind of is a little stroke of luck ifit happens. 
"And I want to thank Alice for her patience. And some day she'll be old enough to watch "30 Rock" reruns on the Internet, and understand where mommy was going at 6 a.m. every day, for all that time. And she'lllook up at me and say, "What do you mean you don't get residuals for this? 
"I love you, Alice. Take care of me when I'm old and broke!"

DENVER -Carmelo Anthony still has a tiny frac­ture in a bone in his right hand. 
However, it's nothing that a little white athletic tape can't remedy. 
The Denver forward has been cleared by his doctor to play Friday night against Charlotte, provided he tapes up his two middle fmgers to protect the healing hand. 
"No tape, no play," Anthony said after a strenu­ous workout on the court Thursday that lasted around an hour. "That was (the doctor's) quote. Got to listen to that." 
Anthony was injured on Jan. 5 when Indiana center Jeff Foster swatted at the ball, catching a good chunk of Anthony's shooting hand. Anthony played through the second half despite numb­ness. 
Afterward, he found out the hand had a fracture and he'd be out around four weeks. 
Turns out, he's a fast healer. 
"The doc didn't know how well my hand was going to heal," Anthony said. "Today, he was sur­prised at how well it healed. I healed faster than I thought, faster than he thought." 
He was hoping for even more good news Thursday night, but it didn't arrive as Anthony wasn't among the players selected as a 
Western  Conference  
reserve.  
Instead,  teammate  

Chauncey Billups made the squad, his fourth straight All-Star appearance. 
"The only reason why is because of the injury," Billups said of Anthony's exclusion. "It's just an unfortunate situation." 
Anthony realizes the hand is now an open invita­tion for even more swipes from opposing players. 
Not that he's concerned. 

"There's nothing I can do to prevent it but sit out," he said. 
Hardly an option. 
Anthony is sick of sitting on the sideline. He's already missed 1 0 games because of the fractured hand, the team going 6-4 in his absence. 
''I'm so excited to have him back," Billups said. "We need him desperately right now." 
The injury did give Anthony a unique vantage point, picking up on the subtleties of the game. 
"When you sit on the sideline in games, it becomes clearer to you," said Anthony, who's averag­ing 21.1 points and 7.3 rebounds this season. "You start seeing things you probably wouldn't see out there on the court."

ATHENS, Ga. -Dennis Felton led Georgia on a surprising run through the SEC tournament last season, winning four games in four days to capture the title. 
He won't get that chance this year. 
Felton was fired as coach of the Bulldogs on Thursday, one day after the team dropped to 9-11 and 0-5 in the Southeastern Conference with a 26­point loss to Florida. 
"I thought we needed new leadership at this time and that's why I made the change in the middle of the season," athletic director Damon Evans said. 
Evans called Felton in Gainesville, Fla., on Wednesday night after an embarrassing 83-57 loss to the Gators, and delivered the news during a meet­ing in his office Thursday morning. 
"I wanted to be patient. I think I've shown patience in the past. It came to a culmination for me. I'm not going to say last night was the thing that triggered it. There were a lot of things," Evans said. 
Galaxy expect Beckham 
to return to L.A. in March 
CARSON, Calif. -Galaxy coach Bruce Arena dismissed reports from Italy that David Beckham could stay with AC Milan beyond his current loan. 
"No one ever knows the accuracy of anything," Arena said after practice Thursday. "Everything gets distorted, so we don't concern ourselves with those kind of reports." 
Beckham joined AC Milan in December on a loan that ends March 8. He has start­ed four games and scored twice. 
'Tie's going to be back here March 9," Arena said. ''We've entered into a loan agreement with AC Milan (in which) the player, his agent, AC Milan, ourselves and Major League Soccer understand the guidelines." 
Beckham was quoted in Corriere della Sera on Wednesday as saying he might want to stay with AC Milan beyond March 
8. AC Milan vice president Adriano Galliani said Wednesday that club officials will meet with Beckham's representatives to discuss the possibility of retaining him. 
Cancer strikes Eagles'
coordinator Jim Johnson 
PlillADELPHIA -Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator Jim Johnson has had a recurrence of cancer, this time in his spine, team officials said Thursday. 
Eagles trainer Rick Burkholder told The Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News that Johnson on Monday was diagnosed with melanoma skin c,anc,er that has formed a tumor in his back. Jolmson has begun radiation treatments at Bryn Mawr Hospital, the trainer said. 
The tumor is in tim same area where Johnson's skin cancer was diagnosed in 2001, Burkholder told the newspapers. Johnson also has c,ancer in other areas of his body, Burkholder said, but he declined to elaborate. The team did not otTer a prognosL<>. 
"Who knows where it tracked to from there, but his symptoms came from the spine," Burkholder told The Inquirer. "Now there are some other areas in hi<> body (that have cancer), but I'm not going to get into where else some other ~;tuff is. They will all be treated together. "

Shaq back in All-Star game 

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Shaq is back in the All-Star game. 
After being left out of the NBA's midseason gala for first time in his career last season, Shaquille O'Neal received his 15th All-Star selection Thursday night when the reserves were announced for the Feb. 15 game in Phoenix. 

O'Neal and Suns teammate Amare Stoudemire give the host team two Western Conference All-Stars. 
New Orleans, San Antonio and the Los Angeles Lakers also had multiple players on the West roster, which will be coached by the Lakers' Phil Jackson. 

The Orlando Magic made out best in the East, with Jameer Nelson and Rashard Lewis picked as reserves by the conference's coaches alongside starter Dwight Howard. It's the first time Orlando has had three All­Stars. 
"I was just anxious to find out," Nelson said. "I honestly don't get that way. But me hearing everywhere, 'You're an All-Star, you should be an All-Star, you're having an All­Star year.' So you just want to see if people will give you the respect that other people think you deserve." 
But for the second year in a row, only two of the Boston Celtics' Big Three made the initial roster: Paul Pierce was voted in with starter Kevin Garnett, while Ray Allen was left out. 
Traded to the Suns at last season's deadline, O'Neal endured the worst season of his career and had his record-tying streak of 14 con­secutive All-Star appearances end. Now he's back in the showcase game, and trails only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with 19 for most appear­ances. 
Abdul-Jabbar, a Lakers assistant, will help coach the West team. 
The 36-year-old O'Neal was averaging 18.2 points and 9.1 rebounds entering Thursday night's showdown against the Spurs. He needs five more points to catch Hakeem Olajuwon for seventh on the NBA's career scoring list. 
O'Neal isn't the only veter­an on a West roster flush with experience. The Spurs' Tim Duncan and the Lakers' Kobe Bryant are each making their 11th appearances, while Dallas forward Dirk Nowitzki was picked for the eighth time and Houston center Yao Ming for the seventh time. 
Carmelo Anthony, who's missed the last 10 games with a broken bone in his right hand, was left off the roster even though he's been cleared to play Friday night at Charlotte. That leaves point guard Chauncey Billups the lone selection from the division-leading Nuggets. 
"I was definitely excited. My next question right directly after that was, 'Did Melo make it?' Of course I'm disap­pointed in that," Billups said. "The only reason why is because of the injury. It's just an unfortunate situation." 
Acquired in a trade with the Pistons on Nov. 3, Billups has given Denver a steady back­court presence. The four-time All-Star is averaging 19.0 points and 6.5 assists. 
If the West team plans to rely on experience, the East might turn to youthful exu­berance. 
Making their first All-Star teams are Nelson, New Jersey guard Devin Harris and Indiana forward Danny Granger, who was snubbed last season but whose play for the injury-depleted Pacers has been extraordinary. 

Granger is fourth in the league in scoring at 25.8 points per game. 
"He's really dedicated him­self as a basketball player," Indiana coach Jim O'Brien said. "Danny really stormed onto the scene and improved at a level that was astound­ing." 
Stoudemire, Yao, Bryant, Duncan and Chris Paul of the Hornets were voted by fans to start for the West. The East starters are Garnett, Howard, Dwyane Wade, Allen Iverson of the Pistons and LeBron James of the Cavaliers. 
Coaches were then required to vote for two guards, two forwards, a center and two at-large reserves. The other picks for the West were Pau Gasol of the Lakers, Tony Parker of the Spurs, Brandon Roy of the Trail Blazers and David West of the Hornets. Filling out the East roster are Raptors forward Chris Bosh and Hawks guard Joe Johnson. 
There was little controversy in fan voting -besides Stoudemire beating out Spurs reserve Bruce Bowen by just 68,000 votes -but the bal­lots turned in by the league's coaches left a bunch of deserving players with a gripe. 
Allen was passed over despite averaging 18.0 points and helping Boston to a 38-9 record. The eight-time All­Star was skipped over last year, too, but was later added by commissioner David Stern as an injury replacement for Caron Butler. 
Deron Williams and Paul Millsap of the Jazz also were left ofT the rosters. So were the Suns' Steve Nash, a six­time All-Star, Mo Williams of the East-leading Cavaliers, Antawn Jamison of the Wizards and AI Jefferson of the Timberwolves.

Players' union quells talk of NFL lockout 
Associated Press 
TAMPA, Fla. -The NFL play­ers' union plans to pick a succes­sor for the late Gene Upshaw early this year, and sees no rea­son to expect a lockout in two years. 
Owners are opting out of the current labor deal after the 2010 season, however, the union said it didn't anticipate trouble. 
"This is a good thing we have going on between the players and owners," president Kevin Mawae said Thursday in the NFL Players Association's first news conference since Upshaw died in August. "The players don't feel we have to get to that point." 
The five finalists to replace Upshaw, as reported last week by The A'isociated Press, are for­mer NFLPA presidents Troy Vincent and Trace Armstrong; former Bears tackle Jim Covert; Ben Utt, who played for Baltimore and Indianapolis; and Washington-based attorney DeMaurice Smith. 
Mawae, the All-Pro center for the Tennessee Titans, said three candidates will be presented to the union's executive board at its annual meeting in Hawaii in March. An election is scheduled to follow, and serious negotiating with the league won't take place before then. 
"What Gene would have want­ed most was for us to carry on with the business of the union," said acting executive director Richard Berthelsen, the players' longtime counsel. "Our mission is to not only retain the partnership we have with NFL owners, but improve on it. 
"We have seen unprecedented labor peace in our sport and unprecedented prosperity together with the owners. We think have a pretty good thing going," he said. 
It will end, however, after an uncapped 2010 season if the two sides don't negotiate a new col­lective bargaining agreement. Berthelsen presented informa­tion that the union believes con­firms just how prosperous the 32 teams are. 
A union-commissioned study showed the average value of the teams has grown from $288 mil­lion to $1.04 billion over 10 years, an increase of about 14 percent a year. Berthelsen said the average gain in the last year alone was $82.6 million, and he challenged anyone to find an industry "with similar numbers in this economy." 
Noting that 95 percent of the Miami Dolphins sold for $1.1 bil­lion earlier this month -"pretty amazing," he said -Berthelsen added that the average profit was $24.7 million in the last year. That would make for $107 million in average annual return, "a very good return for anybody in any economy." 
With those numbers, the union questions why the owners would be dissatisfied with the CBA ­let alone consider the elimination of a salary cap. Mawae said the cap has worked well for all con­cerned, but that the players won't accept one again if it dis­appears next year.

Federer closing in on Sampras 

AP Roger Federer stretches to make a return to Andy Roddick during their semifinal match at the Australian Open. Federer is trying to tie Pete Sampras's record of 14 Grand Slam singles titles. 
Associated Press 
MELBOURNE, Australia ­Andy Roddick was right there when Pete Sampras won his 14th Grand Slam title. And he was right there again when Roger Federer moved within one victory of matching Sampras' record. 
After a scorching day in which temperatures hit 111 degrees, Federer beat Roddick 6-2, 7-5, 7-5 in more manage­able 91-degree heat Thursday night in the Australian Open semifinals. 
The Swiss star will be play­ing in his 18th Grand Slam final but won't know his oppo­nent until Friday night, when Spanish left-banders Rafael Nadal and Fernando Verdasco meet in the other semifinal. 
Federer will be going for a fourth Australian title. Serena Williams will be doing like­wise, and also going for a lOth Grand Slam singles title. She ended the 15-match winning streak of Olympic champion Elena Dementieva, winning 6­3, 6-4 to set up a final against Olympic silver medalist Dinara Safina. 
This was Federer's seventh straight win over Roddick in a major and put his overall record in this matchup at 16­
2. His loss to Roddick in Miami last year now seems like an aberration. 
Roddick lost to Sampras in straight sets in the quarterfi­nals at the 2002 U.S. Open when he was a 20-year-old emerging talent. Sampras, · then 31 and in his 52nd major, retired after beating Andre Agassi two matches later to win the U.S. Open. 
Roddick won the next year at Flushing Meadows and held the No. 1 ranking in 2003. Federer was about to embark on an astonishing run. 
"I think when Pete did it -I was a part of that one, too ­everyone was saying how kind of)ofty of an achievement it was." Hoddick said. "I don't know if we thought we would see it any time soon. Little did we know (Federer) was going to start it the next year and go after it." 
Roddick is 26, just more than a year younger than Federer. 
"It's like my childhood was Pete, and now it's kind of my grown life is Roger," he said. "I guess Roger is a contemporary of mine, which didn't lessen the affect. I see Pete and Andre and I still. get a little jit­tery. It's crazy to think it's come full circle and the mag­nitude of the numbers (Federer's) accomplished, it's pretty scary if you sit down and go through what it takes to accomplish that." 
Roddick lost 15 pounds dur­ing the offseason and started retooling parts of game with new coach Larry Stefanki so he'd be more competitive against Federer. Yet every time he gave himself half a chance, Federer shut him down. 
"He just came up with shots when he needed to," Roddick said. "That's what he does." 
Serena Williams had little problems in her singles semifi­nal, then combined with sister Venus to win a doubles semifi­nal. They will play for the title Friday against Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova and Japan's Ai Sugiyama. 
Safina defeated fellow Russian Vera Zvonareva 6-3, 7-6 ( 4) to move into contention for her first major and the No. 1 ranking -two things her older brother, Marat Safin, achieved. 
Federer's focus has been increasingly sharp since he was forced to come back from two sets down to beat Tomas Berdych in the fourth round. In his quarterfinal, he convinc­ingly took down No. 8-ranked Juan Martin del Potro, then did the same against Roddick. 
This was the hottest January day in Melbourne in 70 years. By the time F_ederer and Roddick were on court in the evening, temperatures had dropped and the retractable roof was open. 
· Federer broke twice in the first set. Adding to Roddick's frustration was a call that went against him as Federer served at 4-1, sparking a run­ning discourse with chair umpire Enric Molina. 
A tiebreaker loomed in the second set with Roddick serv­ing at 5-5. That was until Federer upped the ante and won the last 12 points. The pattern was repeated in the third. 
At this sta,ge last year, Federer was deconstructing his loss to Novak Djokovic in the semifinals. He spoke of having "created a monster" with all his success. 
Federer is over the mononu­cleosis that lingered at the start of last year and con­tributed to a season in which he lost the No. 1 ranking he held for 237 weeks. He said he's in much better physical and mental shape, yet still sur­prised how any dip in form is interpreted. 
"If I lose a set or two sets against Berdych, everybody is like, 'Oh, my God, he's not the same anymore,"' he said. "And then you beat Del Potro and everything is back to normal. You don't lose your edge that quickly. It's just not possible." 
He responded to the close shave against Berdych in the best way he knew. 
"Came up with two great vic­tories now and usually that's when I start playing my best: Toward the end of the tourna­ment," he said. "I think this is where you should judge a great player." 
No Spaniard has won the Australian title, but Nadal is clearly best qualified. He's the only man to beat Federer in a Grand Slam final -three times at the French and the five-set epic last year at Wimbledon. 
Federer said he'd have more of an advantage over Verdasco, who has never reached this stage of a major. 
But "playing Rafa is obvious­ly more exciting because of the history we have," he said. "Him being the best player in the world at t-he moment, it would make it a very intrigu­ing match."

Irish ready for National Indoor Championships 
By ALEX BARKER Sports Writer 
After a convincing 6-1 rout of No. 32 Ohio State last weekend, the No. 17 ranked Irish head to Fayetteville, Ark. for this week­end's National Team Indoor quali­fying tournament. 
Notre Dame will face off against No. 29 Pepperdine in the first round and, with a win', will advance to take on either No. 17 Arkansas or Oregon in the fmals. 
"The competition should be very good this weekend," Irish coach Jay Louderback said. "Arkansas and Pepperdine are both ranked and are always vel"y experienced teams." 
The winner of this weekend's tournament will travel to Madison, Wise. next month to participate in the National Team Indoor championships with 15 other teams from across the cmmtry. . 
Louderback really likes the way his team is coming together so far this season. 
"Our doubles teams have looked very good in practice and the doubles point is always a key in dual matches," he said. "Our lineup is deep in the singles and doubles competitions with a good mix of upper and underclass­men." 
Currently, the Irish's No. 1 dou­bles squad of senior Kelcy Tefft and freshman Kristy Frilling is the top ranked doubles team in the nation. The pair had a very strong fall season finishing with a record of 13-1 and got out to good start this season against Ohio State winning their match 8-3. 
The Irish are really excited about the season that lies ahead of them and, after the early-win­ter layoff, arn just glad to be play­ing real matches again. 
"We were really excited to start playing against last weekend," Louderback said. "This is a team that just really enjoys competing."

NFL 
Bucs hire Jagodzinski as offensive coordinator 
Associated Press 
TAMPA, Fla. -Three weeks after being dismissed by Boston College for pursuing an NFL head coaching job, Jeff Jagodzinski was hired Thursday by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to be their offen­sive coordinator. 
Jagodzinski, who led Boston College to the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game in each of his two sea­sons, was fired Jan. 7 after being told he would be let go if he interviewed for the New York Jets' coaching vacancy. 
He went on the interview despite the ultimatum and was fired the next day. Th-e Jets job eventually went to Rex Ryan. 
Jagodzinski also was a can­didate to be the San Francisco 49ers' offensive coordinator before accepting the job with the Bucs, who fired coach Jon Gruden and general manager Bruce Allen two weeks ago. 
Raheem Morris, who at 32 is the youngest head coach in the NFL, succeeded Gruden and hired Bill Bates as his defen­sive coordinator last week. The Bucs also announced the hiring Thursday of Pete Mangurian as offensive line coach. 
Jagodzinski led Boston College to a pair of bowl appearances and lost twice to Virginia Tech in the ACC title game during his brief stay with the Eagles. He was an NFL assistant for eight years with the Green Bay Packers and Atlanta Falcons before moving to BC, where he tutored this year's NFL rookie of the year Matt Ryan. 
Technically, he replaces Bill Muir as Tampa Bay's offensive coordinator. In actuality, Gruden -fired after the Bucs finished with four consecutive losses to miss the playoffs fol­lowing a 9-3 start -ran the offense. 
Jagodzinski was a tight ends coach for the Packers from 1999-2003, then spent the next two seasons with the Falcons, serving as tight ends coach in 2004 and offensive line coach in 2005. He returned to the Packers as offensive coordinator in 2006. 
Despite the 45-year-old's success at Boston College, ath­letic director Gene DeFilippo didn't hesitate to fire Jagodzinski after telling the coach he would do so if he met with the Jets, who were searching for a replacement to Eric Mangini.

Irish athletes will compete in Findlay, Ohio in the Findlay Invitational. The Irish are coming off an impressive per­formance at the Notre Dame Invitational where both the men and women defeated Michigan State, Marquette, and Wisconsin. Once again, a number of athletes achieved Big East qualifying marks, including junior Joanna Shultz and freshman Natalie Geiger with times of 24.42 and 24.96 in the 200-meter, freshmen Jordan Rincon and Alex Korenstra with times of 
47.65 and 49.69 in the 400­meters, and brother Kevin and Matt Schipper in the pole vault. 
Furthermore, senior Anna Weber's throw of 19.07 meters achieved her not only a victory in the weight throw, but also an NCAA-provisional qualifying mark. She joins classmate Mary Saxer in the pole vault as the two athletes with NCAA marks. 
In the Indiana Invitational, the Irish will compete against major programs such as Indiana, Michigan, and Purdue. The athletes going to the Findlay Invitation will face tough competitors from smaller, Division II schools such as the University of Toronto, the University of Findlay, and Ashland University. 
The entire Irish team will return home next weekend for Meyo Invitational, which wfll feature Big Ten schools such as Iowa and Illinois and is the last home meet before the Big East Championships.

The Irish track and field team is in for a busy few days this weekend, with two meets taking place in two different states. 
The first, the Indiana Invitational, will take place in the Gladstein Fieldhouse in Bloomington, Indiana. Most of the team will compete at this Friday/Saturday event. Friday is devoted mostly to preliminaries, with the women's 60-meter hurdles heats starting things off at 3 p.m., followed by the field events with the weight throw and the long jump at 4 p.m. The finals will take place on Saturday morning, beginning at 9:30 a.m. with the weight throw and the triple jump.

The Irish struggled mighti­ly against Rutgers on both ends of the court Tuesday night. After opening up with four straight free throws, the Irish were held scoreless until the 10:22 mark in the first half while the Scarlet Knights rattled off ·17 straight points. That trend was continued throughout the game, and the Irish could never find their way at either end. 
As for the Cincinnati game, McGraw said she is more concerned right now with fixing the defense. 
"I think we can win scoring 60, but over the last few games it's been creeping up towards 70." 
During Notre Dame's cur­rent funk, the Irish have allowed 75 to Marquette, 67 in the win over St. Johns, 55 to Villanova and 78 most recently against Rutgers. 
The defense will not have any rest going into Saturday's game as it plays one of the most prolific out­side games in the conference in the Bearcats. Cincinnati has already taken 411 shots from beyond the arc {making 129 for a .314 shooting per­centage), compared to only 77 -for-226 for the Irish. 
"[Cincinnati is] going to challenge us. The 3-point defense is not as effective as I'd like it to be," McGraw said. "I think we will be bet­ter -we worked on [3­point] defense in practice this week -but the three is our No. 1 concern." 
The last two ga)lles, perimeter shooting has been the main reason for Notre Dame's defeats. Villanova shot 10-of-27 on Jan. 24 and Rutgers shot 7 -of-14 from 3­point distance on Tuesday. 
The Irish hold a slight advantage over the Bearcats in height -the tallest play­ers to receive significant minutes for Cincinnati this season are 6-foot-1 forwards Michelle Jones and Val Schuster. McGraw said that Cincinnati makes up for this lack of height with athleti­cism in the post. 
"I don't think [size] is going to be a factor because [the 
Cincinnati  posts!  are  so  
physical,"  McGraw  said.  
"They're  a  good matchup,  

they're strong, but they can also step back and shoot threes." 
McGraw said she expects for junior guard Kahla Roudebush to be the Bearcats' most potent offen­sive weapon. Roudebush leads the team with 16 points, in addition to tallying 
4.4 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game this season. 
"Roudebush is a veteran, experienced player," McGraw said. "She'll step up and play well." 
Cincinnati has also added talented freshman guard Shanasa Sanders, who is averaging 7.2 points (third best on the team) and 3.7 rebounds per game. Sanders was named the Big East Freshman of the Week on Jan. 19. 
"They are a very different team than last year," McGraw said. 
The Bearcats are nursing a two-game losing streak of their own, but that is not something to take too seri­ously based on their recent opponents, McGraw said. On Jan. 20 Cincinnati lost 66-50 at No. 6 Louisville and on Jan. 24 it lost 65-34 against top-ranked and undefeated Connecticut. 
Tipoff Saturday is at 2 p.m. at the Joyce Center.

Bobby Bayliss said. "Neither [Tulsa], nor anyone else, has yet had the opportunity to prove much." 
The Irish have lost every dual match they have played against ranked teams so far this sea­son. Two of those losses-Jan. 16 against No. 14 Pepperdine and Wednesday~s against No. 11 1-'lorida State -were by a score of 4-3 that easily could have gone the other way. 
"I am proud of the way we are fighting in these close matches and confident that if this continues it will result in wins," Bayliss said. "We are two tiebreakers from being 3-1 with two top-15 wins, so we know we can play with most of the better teams in the coun­try." 
Tulsa (5-1) brings two ranked singles players, including No. 10 Arnau Brugues. He will face senior Brett Helgeson, ranked 20th, in No.1 singles. 
"Brugues is one of the more talented players in college ten­nis, but we believe that lllelgeson] is also in that elite group," Bayliss said. 
The Golden Hurricanes also bring a challenge in doubles, though none of their teams are currently ranked. The Irish have one ranked pair, the No. 37 duo of Helgeson and sopho­more Tyler Davis. 
"Tulsa has historically played great dcmbles and I expect that to be the case this season," Bayliss said. "The reason that they have no ranked teams is that they have several new players who have just arrived this semester and have no col­lege record. Winning the dou­bles point will be a challenge for us." 
The winner of the match between Notre Dame and Tulsa will go on to face the winne.r between No. 19 LSU and No. 21 Texas Tech. The losers of each match will play in a consolation bracket. 
"I have no preference as to whom we will play on Sunday," Bayliss said. "Both teams are very good and ranked much higher than we. For us it will simply be the fifth top-20 team we have faced in our six matches and another opportu­nity to prove ourselves."

SMC BASKETBALL 

SMC to face Flying Dutch 
By BOBBY GRAHAM 
Sports Wriler 
For the Saint Mary's basket­ball team, this weekend's game arguably carries more weight than any other they have played up until this point. 

With only six games left in the MIAA regular season, the Belles will travel to Holland, Mich., this Saturday for a con­ference matchup against the nationally-ranked Flying Dutch of Hope College. Since both teams are tied with MIAA best 9-1 conference records, the outcome of Saturday's 
conference will have major ramifications in determining which of the two will end the rPgular season as champions. 
Fatigue could be an issue for 

·Saint Mary's (11-7, 9-1), which, despite winning its last three games, is playing its fourth game in a row away from home. One of those 
games  was  a  thrilling over­ 
time  win  against  Calvin  
Wednesday.  

Hope {15-1, 9·1) is coming off of a 79-42 win against Alma last Wednesday. 
The Belles, interestingly enough, were the only team to hand the Flying Dutch a loss this season. To make sure 
there is a similar outcome Saturday, the Belles will need a strong effort from senior forward and South Bend native Erin Newsom, who leads the team with just under 15 points a game. On the other side of the ball, Saint Mary's must contain Hope's depth on the bench. Sophomore guard Erika Bruinsma has lead Hope in scoring three out of the last six games, despite coming off the bench. 
Tip off is scheduled for 3 
p.m. at the DeVos Fieldhouse.

was really tough. I thought I had maybe two good looks all game." 
McAlarney said he expects the added attention because teams figure they can beat the Irish if they are able to con­tain him. 
"That's what I've earned, I guess. I'm expecting teams to kind of try and hang their hat on, 'We've got to shut down Kyle on the perimeter and then we'll beat them,"' McAlarney said. "But I dis­agree with that because I think Ryan [Ayers] is going to find it. I think Zach [Hilleslandl is going to find it." 
That would certainly help, even if the pair of senior for­wards found the bottom of the net just a little more than they have been. In Ayers's case, somebody must've stolen his ability to hit a shot one night while he was sleeping. He's a combined 1-for-17 in his last two games. 
But for someone who's made shots at such a high percent­age (despite these last two games, Ayers still shoots 42 percent from the field), a slump like that isn't bound to last long. Ayers said he's iden­tified what he needs to fix with his shot. 
"My mechanics are fine, it's just getting my legs under­neath me and being more smooth. I felt like the rattling in and out means I need more of an arc on my shot," Ayers said. 
As for the third struggling senior, I-lillesland, he knows he has better basketball in him than what he's showed in Notre Dame's losing streak. In Notre Dame's last seven games, Hillesland has scored a combined 19 points. Hillesland was never one to light up the scoreboard, but he knows his team needs more out of him than what he's given of late. 
"For me, it's narrowing my focus and not worrying about, 'Oh I missed that shot, I could've blocked out better there, is coach getting ready to sub me?' or something like that," Hillesland said. 
But despite the recent loss­es, there have been some pos­itives. Even with Notre Dame's offensive woes, the Irish were still in their last two games until the last seconds. Why? Answer No. 1 has been their defense, which just surren­dered 69 and 71 points to Connecticut and Marquette respectively. 
Then there's Luke Harangody, who, with each day, looks more like he'll repeat as Big East player of the year. Harangody scored 24 points against 7-foot-3 Connecticut center Hasheem Thabeet and 29 against Marquette. 
"I think what he does con­tinually is amazing really," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "He's there every night. He's bringing it every night. It's really a great display of con­sistency and toughness and I've told him privately that we certainly appreciate it and I don't want it to go unnoticed." 
Harangody will face another test Saturday in the form of DeJuan Blair and Sam Young. The two Pittsburgh forwards are among the Big East's best, both offensively and defen-

MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Stuck in the Pitts 
Cold-shooting Irish squad will try to get back on track against third-ranked Panthers 
By CHRIS HINE Editor-in-Chief 
It's been a four days since Notre Dame's lost its fourth straight to Marquette on Monday, losses marked by the struggles of three of Notre Dame's captains. 
Four days can seem like an eternity when you're strug­gling and that next chance to right yourself seems like it'll never come. That day will finally arrive Saturday when Notre Dame (12-7, 3-5 Big East) travels to take on No. 3 Pittsburgh (18-2, 6-2). 
First there's Kyle McAlarney, who has shot 6­for-27 (22 percent) in Notre Dame's (12-7, 3-5 Big East) last two games, well below his 43 percent average from the field for the season. 
"I think against Connecticut, I had some great looks. I think

ND heads to Tulsa for ITANat'ls 
By LAURA MYERS Sports Writer 
Nothing seems to be going Notre Dame's way lately, but the squad will try to change that this weekend. 
The No. 32 Irish (1-3) will travel to Tulsa Saturday to take part in one of 15 ITA National Team Indoors Regional match­es across the country. 
Each regional has four of the nation's top-60 teams, and the winner of each will advance to the ITA National Team Indoor Championships in Chicago. 
The fourth-seeded Irish will begin play Saturday against No. 12 Tulsa, the top seed. 
"This early in the season I doubt if anyone feels their ranking makes them a favorite or an underdog," Irish coach

No.1 ranking on the line in Northwestern Dual meet 
By CHRIS MASOUD Sports Writer 
Standing alone atop the mountain of fencing rankings is no easy task in the NCAA, but the Irish have the opportunity to do just that as they compete in the Northwestern Duals in Evanston, Illinois this weekend. 
The men's fencing team cur­rently shares a first-place rank­ing with Penn State, while the second-ranked women trail the Nittany Lions in the USFCA Coaches Poll. 
"It will be the first encounter with them before we go for a national championship," Irish fencing coach Janusz Bednarski said. "It will be interesting to see how strong we can compete against them. We will see." 
The Irish are coming off a hugely successful weekend at the St. John's University Duals and the New York University Invitational, where the fencers competed without the help of Olympian Gerek Meinhardt. The combination of a talented cast of freshmen and sophomores and an experienced senior line helped the women's team emerge with a record of 5-2 and the men's squad a perfect 7-0. 
According to Bednarski, luck played no part in the young teams' successes early in the season. 
"I think that there arc several reasons for the success," Bednarski said. "We work very hard during the fall, and there was a lot of enthusiasm from the new student-athletes. The creation of this atmosphere helped a lot because they were giving much more." 
Although the Irish lind them­selves pitted against Penn State for the title of undisputed No. 1, Notre Dame will also have to contend with some of the best teams in the country. Temple,

Game key, butnot 'must-win' 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Managing Editor 
Even though Notre Dame has lost three of its last four games -and most recently was embarrassed at home against Hutgers -Irish coach Muffet McGraw said she is reluctant to call Saturday's game against Cincinnati a "must-win." 
"I think it's important that we play better, at least exe­cute the defense bAtter." she said. "I don't wan to call any­

' about how we are playing."

see CATS/page 20 ' ' 

Cleveland State, Johns Hopkins, North Carolina, Wayne State, and a bitter Ohio State are expected to be in attendance. The men's team beat the Buckeyes last weekend, while the Irish women fell in a hard­fought battle. 
"We will fence Ohio State once again because of NCAA competition, so they will try to get revenge," Bednarski said. 
But a victory over Penn State this weekend is no guarantee for the Irish to win a national championship. Because of newly instated NCAA regula­tions, the championships will limit the roster size from years past. 
"We are a little bit more tal­ented and we have a bigger bench than Penn State," Bednarski said. "But it will play for them because their first two fencers are from the national team and are very good." 
Nevertheless, Bednarski believes the talented fighters have a great opportunity to make a statement this weekend if they can keep their focus. 
"I think it will come down to the last minute, the last throw, the last bout."

Forn1er 49er Young officially joins staff 
Observer Staff Report 
1994 Notre Dame gradu­ate and 14-year Nf<L veter­an Bryant Young was hired Thursday as a defensive graduate assistant. 
Young, a defensive line­man who spent his entire career with the San Fransisco 49ers, was named tho NFL Defensive Hookie of the year in 1994 and earned four trips to the NFL Pro Bowl. His ~9.5 career sacks rank as third all-time in 49er history. 
During his time with the Irish, Young led Notre Dame to an astounding 40-8-1 record over four years, 

During his 1993 senior sea­son, Young was named a team captain and elected to the first team All-American team. 
"I'm very excited that Bryant has decided to return home to Notre Dame," Irish coach Charlie Wcis said on und.com. "We're not just adding a future NFL Hall of Famer to our program, we're adding a II all of Fame person." 
Young is replacing Patrick Graham, who was on the Irish staff for the past two seasons, but became the defensive line coach at the University of Toledo earlier in the month.
