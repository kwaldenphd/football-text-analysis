At Seturday 's game 

Fiesty Soviet youth vows resistance 
By Lynne Daley News Editor 
Walter Polovchak, the young Soviet citizen seeking to remain in the US against the wishes of his parents, toured the ND campus on Saturday and said that he "wouldn't go back" to the Soviet Union if he loses his court case. 
Polovchak, 13, came to South Bend with his attorney, Julian Kulas, to view his first football game. He was met by reporters as he entered the ACC' for a meeting with Moose Krause. The boy received in­ternational attention in July when he and his 17-year-old sister, Natalie, ran away from home to avoid returning to the Sqviet Union with their par­ents. 
Natalie, who possesses her own visa, has already received permtsston to remain in this country. Walter is included on-a visa with his parents and a younger brother. Soviet auth­orities have stated that they will not re-admit the Polovchaks to the coutry if they return with­out Walter. 
Kulas, himself a native Uk­rainian, said that Polovchak would be a "marked person" should he be forced to go with his parents. He speculated that many pertinent facts about the case are being withheld by the senior Polovchaks. 
"Very few families are allow­ed to leave the Ukraine as a unit," Kulas explained. 
He said he could not under­stand the Polovchak's desire to return to the Soviet Union. "They fled a country which has a very repressive government," he noted. "It took them over 2 years to leave." 
Now, he maintained, "the Soviet authorities spend con­siderable time with the par­ents-coaching them and making promises." 
Polovchak speaks halting English, so most questions were directed through Kulas. Small in stature, he seems unaware of the furor his action has caused.

The Corby's Saga; a tradition of conflict 
Editor's Note: Next Tuesday, Corby's Tavern, formerly a popular social spotfor Notre Dame students, will/earn whether or not its liquor license will be renewed for another year. The fierce conflict betwten South Bend city officials and Corby's is not a new one however, and Observer staffreporter john Higgins traces the background leading up to next week's decision in this two-part series. 
ByJohn M. Higgins Staff Reporter 
The battle over the renewal of Corby's Tavern's liquor license officially began last spring when the local board of the Alcoholic Beverage Commission (ABC) recommended that the state ABC deny the renewal. _ 
Those fighting Corby's, however, say that the dispute has been going on for several years. In remonstrating against the license. the city of South Bend and the 
Northeast Neighborhood Coun-MONDAY=~:::::::::::::::::~:::::::::::::::: cil (NENC) have said that the problems with ~orby's are t~e ::::::::::\:::::::~FOCUS 
same as those wtth other bars tn the Northeast Neighborhood-iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii;;iiii;.~iiiii the serving of minors, constant noise, an over-abundance ot garbage, and disruption of the neighborhood. 
They contend, however, that while some of the other bars have cooperated with government officials and neighborhood resi­dents, Corby's has not. 
The legal basis for the remonstrance against Corby's license is the 1979 conviction ofa Corby's bartender for serving alcohol to minors after three underage ND students were arrested inside the bar on August 31, 1979. 
However, the charges against Corby's are not limited to those and other arrests in Corby's. The arguments have broadened to ascertain the impact of the tavern's operation on the neigh­borhood. Both city and neighborhood officials argue that Corby's operation has an adverse impact on the Northeast Neighborhood, more so than other bars. 
Moreover, they argue that attempts in the past to resolve problems with Corby's have failed because Corby's management has refused to cooperate. It is because of this lack of effort, the officials say, that Corby's should be closed. 
According to Indiana liquor laws, a bar or tavern must file for renewal ofits liquor license each year. Ifthe bar has not been found guilty ofa liquor law violation during the previous year, renewal of the license is automatic.

Earthquakes rock southern Italy 

NAPLES, Italy (AP)-A series of strong earthquakes ripped through southern Italy last night, killing at least 200 people and injuring hundreds ofothers in collapsed buildings, officials reported. 
They expressed fear the death toll would rise as rescue teams reached tremor-isolated towns in the mountainous area. 
Officials said it was believed about 100 people perished when a Roman Catholic church caved in during evening ser­vices in the town ofBalvano, 75 miles east of Naples. Thirty deaths were reported in Pes­copagano near Balvano. 
Early today, authorities had received reports of damage in 29 cities and towns, with some buildings up to five-stories high toppled as the quake and its aftershocks that rattled Italy from Sicily to the Alps. 
The first jolt struck Naples as many people were sitting down for their Sunday evening din­ner. 
Thousands of people in this. 
port city 120 miles south of Rome jammed the streets, a­fraid to return to their homes. Local officials called for spot­lights to aid rescue teams and asked for tents for the home­less. 
Doctors canceled a strike scheduled for today so they could care for the injured. 
Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport hailed traffic for 40 minutes when air controllers fled their swaying 195-foot­high control tower. 
Eight bodies were removed from a collapsed building in Potenza, 15 miles east of Balvano, police said, and a tele­vision reporter there said Po­tenza's hospital was filled with injured. 
Police reported at least ight persons also were killed in Naples, including a child who 

-suffered skull fractures when a wall fell on him. An apartment building here believed to have housed 20 families collapsed and rescue teams feared some of the tenants were killed. 
In N-;ples, 120 miles south of Rome, news photographer Franco Effe said the hospitals were crowded with injured. "Everyone is in the street. There's lots of panic," he said. 
There were reports that the 
quake, which struck 7:34 p.m. 
(1:34 p.m. EST), was felt as far north as Venice. The Seismo­graphic Institute in Catania, Sicily, said the quake's epicen­ter was at Irpinia, near Naples, and reported the intensity was between 9 and 10 on the Mercalli scale, which would be classified as a major earth­quake. 
The Mercalli scale measures intensity at a specific location, and differs from the Richter scale, which measures the sev­erity of the quake itself. 
Telephone connections were interrupted in many parts of Italy by the earthquake. Naples, 120 miles south of Rome, has a population ofabout 1.5 million people.

Arab leaders will gatherinJordan to map a long-term political and economic strategy, but the possibility looms of a rival summit of hardliners, sources said yesterday. Syrian Foreign Minister Abdul Halim Khaddam was reported en route to Libya and Algeria in an effort to promote a boycott of the League of Arab States' meeting. "There is a possibility of a sorehead summit," said one knowledgeable source who asked not to be identifed. The split in the ranks of the 22-member Arab League has been brought about by the two-month oldIran-Iraq war and the fear ofradical regimes that Iraq would win at least implicit approval for its position at the sun;tmit. Sources predicted between 16 and 19 kings, ruling shetks and presidents would go to Amman for the summit which opens Tuesday at the Royal Theater Hall on the wester~ fringes ofJordan's capital. -AP 
Two former ND studentSaresus­pected of setting fire to the Administration Building Friday afternoon, according to Assistant Director of Security Rex Rakow. Rakow said that a man poured gasoline on the steps of the building and set it afire while another man took pictures. The pair then ran toward Saint Mary's lake. No injuries were reported and only minor damage occurred to the building, Rakow said. Anyone with information concerning the identity of the pair should call the ND Security office. All information will be kept confidential. -The Observer 
Stranded on a desert island, a lone Haitian evaded capture and spent 10 days on tiny Cayo Lobos, surviving on roots, sea crabs and leftover rations, after 106 fellow castaways were forced from the island by police, a Bahamian official said. The man was "willing to go" when he was discovered Saturday by a crew ofa patrol vessel that returned to the island off the Cuban coast to search and clean up after the Haitians, who spent40 days on the football field-sized spit of land. "He apparently had been hiding in a chimney in one of the old abandoned houses O(l the island," said Bill Kalis, chief of the Bahamas News Bureau in the Bahamian capital of Nassau. Kalis said the man identified himself as 34-year-old Francois Louis. The Haitians were marooned on Cayo Lobos when their boat failed to make the 450-mile journey from their impoverished homeland to the United States, where they hoped to seek refuge. -AP 
The man who allede:ely raped tw~ Saint Mary's students on November 8, 197'7" was tdentified by one of the students last week, the South Bend Tribune reported on Saturday. The student identified the man as Thomas James Nichols, a 35-year-old repairman, who was found guilty last Friday of the rape of a Niles Township woman. According to court record, the two students were walking from Saint Mary's at about 9 p.m. After crossing US 31, they said, they saw an automobile parked at the side of the road a1;1d a man from the car started following them. According to statements made by the women, he threatened them with a gun and then forced them into a field and raped them. _ Nichols was identified by the student from photos shown to her by tl ,e Saint]oseph County Police last week. Nichols was charged with the rape last Wednesday. He is now being held in the Berrian CountyJail without bond awaiting sentencing in the 1977 case. -The Observer 
After a decade in hiding, two former leaders of the radical Weather Underground, Bernardine Dohrn and William Ayers, are trying to negotiate their surrender, local prosecutors have confirmed. Gregory Ginex, head of the Cook County state attorney's felony trial division, said that New York lawyer Michael Kennedy had contacted his office, asking for leniency for his clients in exchange for their surrender. But Ginex said he made it clear to Kennedy that any deal likely would have to wait until newly elected State Attorney Richard Daley takes office Dec. 
1. Ironically, FBI officials said their crimecomputers show no outstanding federal warrants against either Dohrn or Ayers. The Justice Department dropped charges against Weather Underground leaders in 1979. The Weather Underground demonstrations Dohrn led in Chicago were staged in protest against the Vietnam War and coincided with the federal conspiracy trial of seven people accused of plotting riots during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chit"'".,,..

Judeao-Cluistian ties 
Rabbi delivers religious lecture 
By Sue Kelleher 

Rabbi Marc H. Tanenbaum, national interreligious affairs director of the American]ewish Committee, delivered a lecture on the far-reaching ties be­tween Christianity andJudaism to inaugrate the Alfred R. and Lee Abrams Collection in He­brew and Jewish studies in the Memorial Library, Friday at 4 pm. 
Rabbi Tanenbaum's lecture was part of the ceremonies honoring the endowed collec­tion of books and other re­source materials to further Judaic Studies within the Theology Department. The collection was established in honor of a 1921 Notre Dame alumnus and his wife, both deceased, who founded a varied industrial firm in Atlanta, Georgia. The gift was made jointly by Mr. and Mr. Abrams' son, Edward, ND '50, and by the Abrams Foundadion, an affili­ate of Abrams Industries, of which he is president. 
Fr. Theodore Hesburgh in­troduced Rabbi Tanenbaum as "a personal friend" and "a bridge-builder between Christ­ians, Moslems, Hindus and all of 

CANCO Week ends: Sponsors claim success 
By Diane E. Mazurek 

As Saint Mary's CANCO Week comes to an end today, Donna Shannon, student direc­tor of the annual charity drive, has a possitive feeling about the overall effectiveness of the child abuse educational pro­grams recently sponcered by CANCO. CANCO is a South Bend clinic run by volunteers devoted to a common goal of reducing, if not eliminating, area child abuse. 
Throughout the week, "we had an information table set up and people stopped by to pick up to pick up literature" said Shannon. "I think people are more aware of child abuse and that was one of our goals." 
Another goal was to attain 100 percent participation from the student body and faculty to donate one dollar apiece. Ac­cording to Shannon, "Money­wise, we won't have ~ny idea (of how much was raised) until Tuesday." 
Hall representatives are still accepting donations, but today is the last day of the drive. Preliminary figures indicate. that the drive is backed by a substantial majority. 
As for the specific ends of.the collection, this will depend upon its size. Two probable recipient programs are CANCO's classes on parenting and their newly-formed child­ren's programs. It is CANCO's theory that child abuse is not only a 'parent problem' but is a problem to be solved before abused children themselves have a chance to apply their parents' set example to their future families. 
Other prepared programs did not gain much interest. Ac­cording to Shannon, last Tuesday's film, Ordinary People, had"not a real big turnout" nor did the Open House at the CANCO office Wednesday where "just a few girls went, but they enjoyed it."

God's people." 
In his lecture, Rabbi Tanen­baum, who was the only rabbi at the Second Vatican Council, referred to the event as "the kind of moment the Biblical spirits respond to." He noted the sense of novelty in "a great AmericanJewish family nation­ally and locally committing it­self to wanting to donate its collection" to a Catholic Un­iversity rather than Jewish in­stitution. His comment that perhaps the event is not so unusual, in that "some Irish­men descended from a group of HibernianJews who carried the Blarney Stone into Ireland dur­ing their flight from Israel", drew laughter from the audi­ence of 100 persons. 
On a serious note, the rabbi exonerated the event as "a recovery of a great tradition in American life which shaped the origins of American democra­cy." This tradition, he said, was rooted in the Puritans who con­sidered Hebrew to be "the exact translation of the Old Testament." Puritanism, he as­serted, was "the new Judaism translated into Anglo-Saxon terms." 
"Apart from this historical background," he continued, "the gift is a return to the mainstream ofwhat it means to be an educated person." 
Jews and Christians have a stake in the well-being ofa great University like Notre Dame, he said. "At the heart of this Catholic institution, he stated, "is an effort to try to fuse to­gether what it means to be a human being in the evil world in which we live today." 
Rabbi Tanenbaum cited the need to fuse moral responsib­ility and knowledge, to insure that its purpose is used for" the good of humanity." He recog­nized the leaders of the Holo­caust, many of them holders of doctoral degreess, as highly educated, but sadly lacking the moral responsibility which must accompany that know­ledge. 
He hailed the gift as a rec­ognition of this truth and "a bedrock upon which others must be built."

GILA projects offer many valuable opportunities 
Summer's a long way off, but students interested in an ex­perience which combines these three qualities, should consider a CILA Summer Project A summer project gives the opportunity to meet new people, handle unfore­seen problems, and reflect on a possible career of service in an environment wholly removed from academics. Since it's a chance to be of service (to oneself as well as to others), to have fun, and to grow, all at the same time, it could be one ofthe best and most important summers of your life. 
This past summer, 14 students spent six to eight weeks in such places as Oakland, Tuscan, Tijuana, Appalachia, and Salt Lake City. The jobs varied with the project location. For example, students in Oakland worked on community organiza­tion in a low-income area. Those in Tijuana taught, played and worked with people who lived in a garbage dump-turned-town. Medical programs, work with the elderly and handicapped, and parish activities are some other possible areas of service. Since CILA has almost as many dif­ferent projects as there are kinds of service, everyone can find something to his/her liking. 
A person can be involved in the area of service which interests him/her; a person can locate in an environment wholly alien from his/her past experiences; and a person can have fun in meeting the challenge of un­certainty. 
For anyone interested in a CILA project, information and applications will be available at the next CILA General Meeting, Sunday, Nov. 23, at 6:45 in the Library Lounge.

Another controversial sub­ject presented at last night's meeting was the possibility of raising the student government fee from $18 to $20. The initial reaction to this proposal was not positive. Mary Ellen Maccio, social justice commis­sioner, suggested that before resorting to the price hike the

Union  fee  which  is  paid  to  

Notre Dame should be con­sidered. This sentiment was not shared by the majority of the Board which feels that this money is necessary to maintain the interests of Saint Mary's in Notre Dames student activities. 
Maccio also emphasized that before any decision is made, she would like to be convinced that the present activity fee is being used to its maximum efficiency. 
She came under fire from several other board members who strongly believed the in­crease to be justified. The reasons given for the increase would be inflation, and then re­distributed of funds among the various activities. 
Kathleen Sweeney supported the move by saying that, "we (Student Governmant) don't receive as much financial sup­port from the school as other schools do. We are a pretty independent organization." She also emphasized her belief that the Student Government budget has been stretched to its maximum efficency, while ap­plauding this year's re-evalua­tion of financial distribution to the various clubs and organi­zations. 
During the commissioner re­ports, disappointment was ex­pressed over the recent Mc­Candless semi-formal. Prob­lems occurred when the people who were employed by the Century Center for admitting the students began turning away couples who arrived late,whether or not they had a ticket.

cannot be used as the basis for denying our license," he concluded. 
Masters, however, tells a different story. "We received reports that Rowley and Anton went down to Indianapolis (before the hearing officer) charging that Mayor (Roger) Parent ordered that 500 arrests be made on St. Patrick's Day and that he wants to see the bars closed down," Masters said. "The hearing officer threw out the charges against Corby's saying that there was some suspicion that the mayor had ordered the arrests. 
"Even though these persons had be8n con­victed in the local court, he wasn't going to consider them," Masters commented. "Of course there was no one from the city at the hearing to to respond." 
Masters insists that despite the hearing of­ficer's dismissal of the charges, it was proper for the local board to have taken the arrests into consideration when they made their decision. ·'While I can see Mr. Rowley's point that they were not convicted by the state commission, the fact r.emains that under the ABC's Regulation 43, the evidence of those arrests is a legitimate basis for the local board's decision," Masters said. "The local commission members testified 
that was one of the reasons for their decision" 
Szekendi agreed. "Just because the charges were dismissed doesn't mean there waft no violation," he said. "The board makes their decision on why they (the arrests) occurred and what they feel is going to happen in the future." 
Masters also disputes Rowley's claim that Corby's is not responsible for minors who enter the _bar using false identification. "It's a smokescreen. The law imposes the responsi­bility on the bar owner if there is any question whether or not the person is 21," Masters said. "The case decisions say that even if a person presents an ID saying he is 21, ifyou have reason to doubt the validity of that identification you are supposed to refuse that person admission. That is the dut) of the bar owner. 
"What Rowley and Anton are saying is that \'OU cdn come in with any piece ofidentification and they are not responsible," Masters con­tinued. "That's not the case. The law imposes the duty on the owner if they accept the I.D." 
Rowley has also accused the mayor's office, the City Attorney, and other city officials of harassment and conspiring to close Corby's. He cited "information" that Parent ordered 500 arrests be made at the Five-Points bars on St. Patrick's Day, that South Bend Police Captain Vison Smith requested to be transferred from his position as head .ofthe department's Vice Squad because ofpressure from Parent's office to close the Five-Points area bars, and that Safety Board head and Parent administrative assistant Robert Potvin is determined to close Corby's because of

a personal grudge against Rowley. 
However, testimony before the commission did not support Rowley's accusations. Former Vice Squad SargentJames Szalay testified that he had received specific orders "not to go out ofhis way" to arrest bar patrons on St. Patrick's Day in order to avoid conflict with drunken students. "We ran regular patrols and would respond to complaints," Szalay said, "but were told not to make any special effort to make arrests." . 
Szalay, who was transferred from the Vice to 
the Robbery Squad late last spring, also testified 
that he had no knowledge ofany pressure from 
the mayor to close the bars and that Vison's 
transfer was simply a "lateral transfer" to a­

With the Persian Gulf war in its 63rd day, the Iraqi military command reported rocket-fir­ing helicopter gunships bat­tered Iranian troops and armor in renewed fighting at the north of the 300/mile front where fighting has flared in hills over­looking Iraqi-occupied villages near Gilan Garb. 
Iraq said 50 Iranians were killed in an attempt to counter­attack Iraqi positions and that four tanks and three other vehicles were knocked out by Iraqi helicopters. Iraq also re­ported 32 enemy dead in earlier fighting and said 63 more Iranian soldiers were killed in fighting further south. 
Iranian communiques stress­ed action about 200 miles south at Susangerd, a town on the main road to Ahwaz, capital of Iran's oil-rich Khuzistan pro­vince. 
Iran claimed that Iraqi troops and tanks tried to mount a major offensive aimed at Susangerd, preceeded by heavy artillery and mortar bombard­ments. Iran said its forces crushed the Iraqi attack, "killed large numbers of the enemy" and captured 17 Iraqi soldiers. "The infidels fled in chaos, leaving behind scores of burn­ing tanks," the Iranian news agency reported. 
During the course of the war, military communiques from each side have given conflicting reports of battle action and there has been little independ­ent confirmation of rival claims. 
Communiques from Tehran yesterday reported that Iranian warplanes destroyed a chemical plant, a cement factory and an electric power station in north­western Iraq near the border with Turkey and Syria. Iranian jets also destroyed an Iraqi radar station near Mosul, Tehran said. 
Iraq reported one Iranian air raid in northern Iraq, but said that only a civilian car was damaged and its driver wound­ed. 
Baghdad Radio said Iraqi jets attacked Iranian troops in the Susangerd and Abadan areas, 
but gave no details.

New Orleans (AP)-"The The only foul Duran didn't commit was hit Ray when he was down ... because Ray wasn't down," trainer Angelo Dundee said Sunday ofRoberto Duran's tactics when he beat Sugar Ray Leonard on a decisionJune 20. 
"In 75 fights, (actually 73), Duran has never lost a round on a foul," said Ray Arcel, who helps train Duran. 
"The worst foul in the ring is holding, and Sugar Ray held," said Freddie Brown, another Duran trainer. 
Arcel, Brown, Dundee and Janks Morton appeared at a news conference while Duran and Leonard limited their ac­tivities to light workouts for

their rematch for the World 
Boxing Council welterweight 
title Tuesday night in the 
Superdome. Duran worked out 
at an elementary school. 

"The reason we got you the 
trainers is we couldn't get you 
the fighters," said publicist 
Murray Goodman. 

The trainers did very well, with Dundee and Arcel scoring with the hardest verbal jabs. 
"Ray learned a lot in the first fight," said Dundee. "He learn­ed how to avoid getting held, how to avoid getting butted. Duran uses his head very well. Duran is a very heady fighter." 
Arcel countered by saying that at the end of one round in Montreal, Duran returned to the corner and said, "He's thumbing me. He's trying to stick his thumb in my eye." Then, Arcel paused and said, "Those things can be acciden­tal." 
"Angelo is my pupil and he's come a long way. He's a good trainer and he's trying to plant controversy in the minds of the people here." 
The Leonard camp complain­ed about the handling of the first fight by referee Carlos Padilla, the Filipino living in Las Vegas who worked the

seasons by bringing the Irish back to within one goal. Rothstein, who enjoyed an im­pressive weekend notched both Irish goals after picking up two precise passes from the ever-present Poulin. _ 
The rally fell short when Notre Dame couldn't capatilize with an extra skater after MeNamara had been pulled from the goal with 45 seconds remaining. 
In the opening game of the series, Notre Dame ran into both a bad stretch of luck and some very good goaltending by Huskie Frank Krieber. Despite havtng numerous opportuni­ties, the Irish just could not pull the trigger at the proper mo­ment, and many of their best chances were thwarted by the outstanding play of Krieber. 
Smithwas fast in giving credit where it was deserved, although he cited his team's inability to capitalize on their opportuni­ties as being the biggest factor in the loss. 
"Their goaltender came up with a very fine game against us. He consistently made the saves he had to. However, we did miss more than our share ofchances. Both teams played well, but we just made the key mistake when we shouldn't have." 
Smith's reference was to the overtime goal when the Irish found themselves on the short end of a three-on-two-break. It was one of several instances in which the Huskies showed their deft passing and quick skates, as they displayed an effective brand of breaking hockey. 
Bill Rothstein was again in­strumental in theIrish attack, as he opened the scoring in the first period when he gathered in a rebound from the front ofthe crease and beat Krieber with a high backhand to the stick side. 
The goal came on a power­play, with Jeff Brownschidle taking the shot from the point

and Poulin deflecting it before 
Rothstein found t the net. 
Michigan Tech evened the score less than a minute later whenLauen took advantage ofa defensive lapse and beat Dave , Laurion. Laurion provided an enjoyable show throughout the game however, making several spectacular stops on some good 
Tech chances. 

The teams traded goals in the second period also, with Roth­stein tallying his second goal of the evening after faking a nice pass from freshman Adam Parsons. Michigan Tech's Swedish import Per-AkeJohan­sson knotted the score midway through the stanza when he took a pass from behind the Irish cage and beat Laurion to \the glove side. 
With both teams skating to a 
scoreless third period, Notre 
Dame entered its second over­
time in as many series with high 
hopes of an emotional win. In 
its last seven overtime games, 
Notre Dame had lost only once, 
giving one reason to believe 
that exciting finishes are not 
just characteristic ofIrish foot­
ball or basketball. The win was 
not to be however, as Irish 
nenesis Terry ended the game 
when he took a beautiful cross­
ice pass fromJeffJohnston and 
beat the out-positioned 
Laurion. 

In reflecting on a relatively 
good effort from his team, 
Smith seemed at a loss for ex­
plaining their problem on 
home ice. He made itquite clear 
however, that he planned to see 
some improvement in each 
facet of the fame, as he feels the 
team is far from its potential. 
"I don't know if we're too 
tense and trying to be perfect, 
or ifwe're justhaving bad luck. I 
do know that we are not making 
full use of our talents:" 

The Irish will host the U ni­
versity of Michigan next week­
end.
