Continental pulls out of South Bend airport 
By ERIN PIROUTEK 
Associate News Edi tor 
Continental Express, a regional subsidiary of Continental Airlines, plans to discontinue service to South Bend on Sept. 5. 
"They have been in the process of pulling out of smaller airports in the Midwest since late last year," said John Schalliol, execu­tive director of South Bend Regional Airport. Continental Airlines, which has served South Bend since 1996, had the best on-time performance of any major U.S. carrier last year, according to figures f'rom the 
U.S. Department of Transportation. 
Continental cited constrained airspace at their Cleveland hub -Hopkins Airport -,-as the rea­son for withdrawing from South Bend. 
"They have only one runway. That's causing congestion, oper­ational issues and delays," said Julie Gardner, spokesperson for Continental Express. 
South Benu airport authorities disagree, citing financial issues rather than congestion as the major factor. 
"It really goes back to the same reasons that American Eagle pulled out," said Schalliol. 
Continental is slowly acquiring regional jets, according to Schalliol. As they shift focus, Continental will retire more and more of the smaller turbo-prop aircraft that they are currently operating. He noted that the regional jets are more efficient to 
operate, therefore,  more  prof­ 
itable for the airline.  
Gardner  confirmed  that  

Continental plans to move to an all-jet fleet by 2004, however, she denied this had an effect on

South Bend service. 
"People are concerned, they see two airlines in the last few months pull out," said Schalliol. 
He said, however, that these aren't the only changes to the airport. American Trans Air Chicago Express has begun to fly into South Bend. 
"The numbers have been a pleasant surprise to Chicago Express," said Schalliol. Early in March they will increase service from four flights per day to six per day. 
. Other airlines are also consid­ering coming to South Bend. 
"We are talking with two carri­ers right now," said Schalliol. Ile declined to name the two air­lines, but said they could be fly­ing into South Bend before the end of the year. 
Both the Gardner and Schalliol remain hopeful that Continental will someday return to South Bend. Possibilities include ser­vice to Continental hubs in Newark and Houston. 
"I don't even have a guess as to how long that will be in the future." said Schalliol.

Senate sponsors parietals survey 
ByJASON McFARLEY 
Assistant News Editor 
Students interested in voic­ing their opinions about University parietal hours may have an extra incentive to vote in c l a s s council cle ctions Wed-nes­day, when a survey asking for student views on parietals w i I l appear on ballots. 
The student government officials are optimistic the ballot issue is a move that will spur unprecedented change to parietals. the guidelines which regulate visiting hours by members of the opposite sex in Notre Dame residence halls. But 
University administrators 
said Monday that the survey . alone likely will not drive changes to the long-standing hours. 
The survey is part of a Student Senate referendum that will ask students if they are in favor of extending parietals to 1 a.m. on week­nigh ts and ending them before 10 a.m. each day. The referendum would extend parietal hours to 1 a.m. through the week and end them at 9 a.m. every day. 
"Through talks with stu­dents, it has become evident that we need to do a survey to decide what the next step should be on the issue," said Brooke Norton, student body vice president and student body president-elect. 
Norton said referendum results do not require 

University officials take action but will provide the Student Senate and the Office of the Student Body President with data to ana­lyze and eventually form a proposal. 
Depending on survey 
results, the senate may vote 
this semester to pass a reso­
1u tion, Norton said. The 
measure would then need 
approval by the Campus Life 
Council and senior adminis­
trators in the Office of 
Student Affairs. 
"This [referendum] is a way to allow students to take an active role in Notre Dame affairs. I'm hoping to see a strong, unified student voice on Wednesday," Norton said. 
While Norton acknowl­edged that informal talks with University officials indi­cate that the administration is willing to cooperate with student government on the issue, Bill Kirk, assistant vice president to Residence Life said a proposal based on ref­erendum results alone prob­ably will not spur changes to the parietals policy. 
"We would need to talk to more students, rectors and administrators before a deci­sion like that is made," Kirk said. "These survey results alone wouldn't dictate poli­cy." 
Kirk said many students favor current parietals hours because, the regulations allow for quiet, uneventful times in residence halls. 
But most students said they are in favor of extending parietals. 
Robyn Harridge, who lived in a co-ed residence while in London, said the aim of pari­etals is misguided. 
"I can appreciate the view­point that parietals give peo­ple time to shower, study or

sleep without the opposite sex around," I-larridge, a junior, said. "However, pari­etals do not prohibit visitors of the same sex in rooms, who can be equal distrac­tions from work or sleep." 
Harridge said extending parietals earlier in the morn­ing and later at night would help foster the positive gen­der relations she experienced while living in England. 
Joe Lordi agrees. 
He said there is some merit to parietals curbing premari­tal sex and cutting down late-night distractions, but the rules make relationships between males and females awkward. 
'Tm tired of the weird rela­tions between sexes, and I'm tired of hearing everyone complain about it. It can be fixed. It should be fixed," the sophomore said. 
Both Harridge and Lordi believe having the parietals issue on class election ballots will yield high voter turnout Wednesday. Lordi said he might not have voted had the referendum not been on the ballot. 
"I can't speak for the rest of the student body, but any­one that is unhappy with gender relations here should turn out and would be doing a disservice if they didn't,"

"So, what are your plans for next year?" 
Yes, seniors, we hate this question. 

At least those of us whose answer is always a sort of sad, semi-embarrassed, low, resentful "I don't know." 
The one thing we DO know is that we can't stand that question. 
The phenomenon start.5 very early on. sometimes in the summer before senior year even begins. It's like a wave, a current of perpetual 


interest that breezes through every level and circle of pco-Christine Kraly pie you know. "What are you doing next year? Do you

sations like the wind. And 
your eldest relatives are 
always the first to blow the current your way. 
September interrogations from Grandma and Uncle Jim aren't so bad. "They're just curious what I'd ideally like to do. where I might want to live. Just humor them and tell them you're weighing the options (which are usually none at this point) and that you'll decide later in the year." 
Soon Mom and Dad make one oftheir weekend calls: Oh, so-and-so down the street was asking about you. I told her you were good, that Notre Dame is treating you well. Oh. she was so proud. She asked if you had a job yet. Do you? Have you heard? Oh by the way, ARE you living at home next year? 
"Tell Mrs. So-and-so nope, no clue. I just want to be on some payroll somewhere sometime next year." 
By Halloween we're already nervous. Asked so many times. it seems we should have our entire lives figured out. "Oh God, you're right, I DON'T have a job. What will I tell my family?" 
It gets so we fear the holidays. Thanksgiving rolls around and cousins no longer ask but advisc.·"Maybe you should think of grad school or something." Christmas is no longer the season orjoy but a day-long career counseling session. We count down the days to breaks, but cower at being prodded by aunts and investigated by uncles. 
Our relatives make us prisoners in our own uncertainty. 
Only after essentially every "adult" you know has posed the question do you feel like your fel­low students catch the question bug. 
There are two reasons why a student would ask another student about post-graduation plans: 
1) H&She has a job. (Usually THE job; will either reside in New York or Chicago) or 
2) H&She is desperate to know someone else is as clueless about the future. 
But this question is not going to go away. It's unavoidable. We should simply escape the inqui­sition the easiest way possible: run. Just run away. 
Imagine the confusion, imagine the sight: hun­dreds of men and women. dashing to and fro out on the quads. Dropping books, papers, every­thing to flee from the one question that haunts them day and night. 
As soon as the words pass the questioner's lips, they scurry. And the questioner is left standing confused.

Castro offers degrees to Americans 
CARBONDALE, Ill. 
Cuban President Fidel Castro will pay for 500 American high school seniors to get a medical degree and invited university President James Walker to return to Cuba in two weeks to help them make the adjustment to life on the island nation. "He has asked that I will return within the next few weeks to provide assistance to him in terms of the way they are going to acclimate some American students into that American school," Walker said. Cuba recently opened a Latin American Medical School and Castro has extended 500 scholar­ships for U.S. students who want to pursue a medical degree. The scholarships, which will provide full expens­es for six years, were given to 250 black students, Walker said. The other 250 were awarded to other minority students. including Hispanics and Native Americans. "And this is not just 500 students one year, this is 500 students every year," Walker said. Walker said even more important is ensuring that at the end of their six-year medical training, the students will be able

Nader rejects WTO, globalization 
BALTIMOHE 
Consumer advocate and former Green Party presiden­tial candidate Halph Nader spoke on "The Problems and Consequences of Globalization" as part of the Symposium of Foreign Affairs Wednesday night at Johns Hopkins University. The lecture concentrated on the ills of corpo­rate globalization and explored the ramifications of recent international trade agreements, including the World Trade Organization [WTO). Nader also talked about globalization's effects on Third World human rights. "l think LglobalizationJ has been subjected to more misinformation, more hype and more knee-jerking than any other issue," Nader said. 'The descriptions (of the WTO) in the papers ... [show that] this is a battle between the 139 member nations to reach mutually agreeable sanctions." Nader disagreed with this view, saying that WTO courts dictate trade relations between nations based upon the least restrictive medium, which results in the lowering of environmental. consumer and worker right.5 standards in more developed nations.

Lecturer suggests self-evaluation

News Writer 
Developing the spirit is first and foremost the most impor­tant process in a person's life when striving to expand and enrich the relationship with God as well as with others according to Sister Barbara Fiand in her lecture entitled "Spirituality: Our Quest for God." 
"Spirituality precedes reli­gion and theology. It's the root of our quest for meaning when religion runs dry... and theolo­gy gets boring. Spirituality always remains because our inner hunger [for God] never goes away," said Fiand. research professor of spiritu­ality at the Institute of Pastoral Studies Loyola University . 
According to Fiand, "Spirituality encompasses our relationship to everything... lit) permeates our life, even unconsciously." In addition, "we all live our personal story that is part of a wider familial, cultural, and sexual myth. which when made conscious, we can either accept or reject them... we can critique them," said Fiand. 
0 pen criticism and open dia­logue is necessary for a deep and functional spirituality. Because of the level of educa­tion that Notre Dame students have been afforded since Vatican II, the level of thinking and scholarship enables stu­dents to explore personal spir­ituality inquisitively. 
"Critique is the way in which we challenge each other to grow ... [and] we live in an age where critique is not only pos­sible but mandatory for the intellectual spiritual life," Fiand said. 
Due to the mandatory need for critique, the necessity to understand our spirituality follows. Fiand outlined two paradigms used to explain four questions either directly or indirectly related to spiritu­ality. First, who is my God, the source of my existence? Second, who am I? Next, how am I related to God, what is the source or evil and sin, and how am I to understand virtue? And last, how can I be liberated from evil and sin and escape from this alienation? 
The first paradigm and most accepted, is based on Neo­Platonic Augustinianism and is a model of military obedience. 
"The language of redemp­

tion is that of paying the price 
for our sins, restoring us to 
grace," said fland of this first 
model. 
The second paradigm focus­
es on God as love in which 
Fiand said this love comes 
from a deliberate effort of the 
individual to examine his or 
her own life and to then com­
pare it to the life of Christ. 
"God breaks out in diversity 
and creation and the human 
being is the image and beloved 
of God," she said. 
To reach redemption 
through this model of thought, 
one must walk the road Jesus 
walked. 
The key according to Fiand 
is to bring the two paradigms 
together to reap the benefits 
of a healthy spirit in contem­
porary society. 
"We often live in one para­
digm but desire the other. We 
need to align the two ... [and] _claim out spirituality for the 
21st century," said Fiand.

Kuwait celebrates liberation day 
Associated Press 

KUWAIT 
To the beats of military bands and folk songs, Kuwaitis paraded on foot and on floats along the seaside corniche, remem­bering the day 10 years ago when the Persian Gulf War ended a seven-month Iraqi occupation. 
Ten thousand people participated in the first such large-scale celebra­tion organized by the gov­ernment since the war's end. They lined the two­mile stretch of road between al-Seef palace, the seat of government, and Flag Square, where festivities began Sunday in the presence of former President Bush Kuwait's hero for assem­bling the Gulf War coali­tion. 
"This is the day our nightmare ended," said Maryam Ibrahim, 37. Iler three boys were in fatigues and her daughter wore a tutu in black. white, green and red -the colors of Kuwait's flag. 
"They were all born after the war, and I want­ed them to experience what we felt on liberation day," Ibrahim said. 
On one float, a girl dressed like a bride, signi­fying a free Kuwait, sat in a miniature al-Seef palace. Another showed a closed fist, a sign of resolve against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's contin­ued threats. 
Kuwait has resisted gala anniversaries for a decade out of respect for its war missing. Kuwait accuses Baghdad of still holding about 600 people. Iraq insists it has released all war prisoners. The Kuwaiti government decid­ed to part with tradition · this year because the 10th liberation anniversary falls just one day after another big anniversary -40 years of Kuwaiti indepen­dence from Britain. 
"Without the POWs, all of this doesn't mean any­thing to me," said Wa.lid al-Shuaibi, a 22-ycar-old college student watching the parade. "I came here just to sec the yellow flag of the missing waving among the other flags.'' 
Al-Shuaibi said his brother died in Iraqi cus­tody and his cousin was among the missing. 
Fireworks lit the night sky over Kuwait City as Kuwaitis drove along the corniche tooting, waving Kuwaiti and American flags and occasionally stopping in the middle of the road to get out and dance.

mandate, Bush gets only mid-ward." 
The cornerstone of the joint address to Congress, which aides said would last about 45 minutes, will be Bush's pitch for a $1.6 trillion tax cut over 10 years. He is buffeted on all sides -from Democratic parti­sans who say it's too big, GOP activists who say it's too small and voters who put a higher priority on debt reduction and certain spending programs. 
A poll released by the Pew Research Center last week indi­cated that·voters narrowly sup­port Bush's tax plan -43 per­cent in favor, 34 percent opposed -with voters in favor of shoring up Social Security or paying fot domestic programs rather than tax cuts. 
Bush must convince voters they can have it all: lower taxes, lower public debt and bigger budgets for education, environment and other popular programs. 
"With a $5.6 trillion surplus, we do have room for a lot of options," White House press secretarv Ari Fleischer said Monday.· 
Bush rarely stressed debt reduction on the campaign trail. in part because his mas­sive tax-cut package didn't leave room for reducing red ink under economic conditions at the time. 
But surplus projections have ballooned. And the Congressional Budget Office estimates that up to $800 bil­lion of the $3.4 trillion in pub­licly held debt cannot be retired in the next decade because it is in savings bonds or treasury bills that do not come due soon or are held by foreign govern­ments. 
Bush will be able to promise the fastest. largest debt reduc­tion in history: $2 trillion over 10 years, aides said Monday.

Mormons release freed slave records

Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON 

The Mormon Church pub­lished records Monday from the post-Civil War Freedman's Bank for newly freed slaves, making ancestral records available for as many as 12 million black Americans. 
The records have been avail­able for years through the National Archives but not in organized form. The church, formally the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. spent 11 years. with help from volunteer Utah state inmates, extracting and 
documents into one database. 
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat, said, "For too long, African-American history was embodied in untruth. We were not given an opportunity for truth." 
The Freedman's Savings and Trust Company was estab­lished through a congressional charter in 1865 -the same year the Civil War ended -to help former slaves with their new financial responsibilities. With 37 branch offices in 17 states, the bank had deposits totaling more than $57 million before it collapsed in 1874 because of mismanagement 
and fraud.

eligible to receive money. Less than 30,000 former slaves ever recovered their money and even then, most received just over half of what they were actually owed, Washington said. 
Jackson Lee said it was pre­mature to say whether there would be legislation to com­pensate the former account holders. Instead, she said she hoped to first have a review of the bank's records and opera­tions. 
Jewish descendants of the Holocaust have sued several European countries in recent years over decades-old bank accounts and other property confiscated by Adolf Hitler's Germany and European collab­orators. 
The Freedman's Bank had branches in Huntsville and Mobile, Ala.; Little Rock, Ark.; Washington, D.C.; Tallahassee, Fla.; Atlanta, Augusta and Savannah, Ga.; Lexington and Louisville, Ky.; New Orleans and Shreveport. La.; Baitimore. Columbus. Natchez and Vicksburg, Miss.; St. Louis; New York; New Bern, Raleigh and Wilmington, N.C.; Philadelphia; Beaufort and Charleston, S.C.; Memphis and Nashville, Tenn.; Lynchburg, Norfolk and Richmond, Va. 
The Mormon church has maintained a massive genealogical database since 1894, originally to assist church members in tracing their family histories. The col­lection today is the largest of its kind. The church also plans to release a searchable data­base of the 1880 Census. 


"We've never thought it's been in doubt," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said. "The overwhelming majority

The Herald, which initially

Separately, a research firm

zations, including The 
Associated Press, The 
Washington Post and The New 
York Times. is reviewing 
180.000 Florida ballots that did not register a vote for president during machine counts. Those results are pending. 
The critical decision to reject late-arriving recounts was made by Secretary of State Katherine Harris, co­chair of the Bush campaign in Florida. She said she would not accept recount results after a Nov. 14 deadline set by state law. 
Only Volusia County com­pleted its recount by the dead­line, resulting in 98 net votes for Gore. When Harris announced those totals. Bush led by 300 votes, and on Nov. 
17. after overseas ballots were counted, she certified Bush's victory margin as 930 votes. 
Associated Press 
MIAMI 

A media-sponsored review of 10,644 uncounted ballots in Miami-Dade County gave Al Gore just 49 additional votes. but Demo­crats chal­lenged the suggestion that the numbers showed he W OU ) d have lost Florida and the presiden­cy had the votes been tallied. 
The results published Monday were the first in a statewide ballot review car­ried out by an accounting firm hired by The Miami Herald. USA Today and Herald owner Knight Ridder. 

The firm reviewed ballots that were not counted by machines in the initial statewide count -the so­called undervote -and used the most lenient method of interpreting voter intent on the punchcard ballots. 
The review suggests that Gore would not have gained enough votes in Miami-Dade to overtake George W. Bush's statewide lead of 930 votes certified on Nov. 17 -even combined with votes the for­mer vice president gained during hand recounts in Broward, Palm Beach and Volusia counties. Gore had request manual recounts in all four counties.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
The only choice is life 
This letter is in response to the Feb. 22 letter, "Remove the 'Trojan horse."' 
A wise man was once asked, "Ifyou could have one wish, what would it be?" The man replied, "I would restore words to their original meanings." 
We live in a world where there is currently an explosion of misnomers. In light of this, we must replace the misnomers with words that actually present what they represent. It is time for our nation and our world to look beyond the self-serv­ing linguistic formulae of the "pro-choicers," whose first misnomer is the collective name with which they refer to themselves. 
"Pro-choice" -ignorance abounds in that ter­minology; morally, there can be no "choice" in deciding whether to have an abortion. We cannot choose a course of action which is morally unac­ceptable. That is not a theological dictate, it is a premise of philosophy. "We must do good and avoid evil." There is only one course of action that is congruous with gospel values, and this is to choose life! 
Furthermore, the tireless use of euphemisms by the "pro-choicers" is so worthless that it arouses moral indignation among the rest ofus -that is, those who are engaged in a search for truth in our own moral journeys. Their name itself is a euphemism. What they advocate is abortion, not choice. And to abort is to impinge upon God's omnipotence as author of life. 
The letter that appeared last week in The Observer was no different. Bashing the Knights of Columbus for their memorial to unborn children outside of the Basilica, this letter was full of mis­nomers and euphemisms. However, the author's primary offenses against truth were the numer­ous, sweeping and libelous accusations against pro-lifers and "specifically the Knights of Columbus." 
We fail to see how our memorial to the innocent victims of abortion was insensitive, deliberately manipulative or contributive to the current back­lash against women. Frankly, we aren't even aware of any specific backlash against women. The ambiguity and generalizing in the accusation -of tho existence of and our contribution to this backlash -serves suitably to demonstrate the libel contained in all of the accusations in the aforementioned letter. 
Ifour monument is manipulative, we hope that it manipulates in a manner which causes women and men to recognize that abortion is an abom­inable crime against the sanctity of life. You also accused the Knights of Columbus (and therefore all who embrace the culture of life) of abusing women, forcing them into a mold of baby-killers and close-mindedness (sic). 
Let all people of good will hear us: We denounce these charges, and wish to tell you just what we are about. The Knights of Columbus is an organization dedicated to charity, fraternity, unity and patriotism. We are a family-oriented organization, coming to the aid of widows and orphans is our primary task. With Mother Theresa of Calcutta as our model and The Blessed Virgin Mary as our patroness, we say this: If you don't want your baby, give it to us. We will find it a home. The Knights of Columbus is a service organization, a brotherhood of Catholic gentle­men at the service of the Church and who are loyal to the Holy Father -the vicar of Christ. 
The letter pleads for someone to teach "ratio­nality, sensitivity and analysis." We, as Knights of Columbus, do this by serving the gospel. The let­ter claims that these things are forsaken, "for some absolute moralistic right." Rationality, sen­sitivity and analysis do not controvert moral absolutes; rather, they lead us to them. Rational thought is the only vehicle to the truth, which is a synthesis of every moral absolute we can define -through our rational thought, sensitivity and analysis. We wish all people would look at both sides of the matter, as you accuse us of the omis­sion of such careful investigation. Then you would see the truth. 
Our monument to the innocent victims of abor­tion was carefully selected and designed to bring a level of decorum to the matter of memorializing the innocent victims of abortion -the holy inno­cents, if you will. The Knights of Columbus have hatred and disgust for no human person. Knights vow to serve God with charity, to live out our fun­damental human vocation to love all people. We have not in any way attempted to victimize the women who have already been victimized by a society which permits and commercializes abor­tion. 
We know that abortion is a business. Abortion counselors are trained to work on a woman's weakness from the moment she enters the clinic door. The counselors find out what is driving the woman to abort and they magnify it, telling the woman how much trouble it is to have a baby. 
Our hope is that the image of the Mother and Child erected outside the Basilica will serve as a beacon of hope for the women who regret forsak­ing their baby. We want to show them that one day, they may be reunited with that child, and that "With [the Lord] is found forgiveness: For this we revere [Him] ... because with the Lord there is mercy and fullness of redemption ... " (Psalm 130). We want to spread a message of love. 
We must be mindful of what Jesus tells us, "Be on your guard! If another disciple sins, you must rebuke the offender, and if there is repentance, you must forgive." (Luke 17 :3). 
Thus, we embrace all of our brothers and sis­ters who have suffered as a result of abortion. We pray for them daily, and we ask God that our prayers might also serve as a vehicle to convert hearts and end abortion forever. Lastly, we wish to end with a suggestion for the "pro-life" contin­gent here on campus and throughout the world. Pray the pious invocation of the apostles which followed Jesus admonition to forgive, "The apos ties said to the Lord, Increase our faith!" (Luke 17:5). Pray it over and over, until your hearts are converted.

Response to rhetoric 
This letter is in response to two letters from yesterday's edition of The Observer. 
Recently, I was having a discussion with a friend of mine who enjoys inventing adjectives. His most recent creation was extremely dirty, and I jokingly told him that I would probably want to slap any­one who could be described by that word. It's a strong reaction, but that's the power of language. 
I put the incident out ofmy mind, until I read Nathaniel Hannan's response to the letter regarding the statue donated by the Knights of Columbus. I was reminded of the earlier incident because, as I read the letter, I became increasingly shocked by its vehement and self­righteous tone, and ihis reminded me once again of the power lan­guage has over all of us. 
In what I consider to be a theologically questionable and rhetorical­ly blatant statement, Hannan asserts, "If abortion is a justifiable choice, then [women who had abortions] should not be concerned ,vith our reminding them that God thinks otherwise. If, however, their alarm at our memorial comes from the deep sense that they have done something horrible, then our memorial has served its purpose." 
First, on the theological note, I am always interested to know what sort of personal divine experience a person who asserts, "God thinks ... " has had. A more accurate statement would be, for instance, "Based on Scripture passage x, Church teaching y, and logical reason z, the Catholic Church teaches ... " I don't think this revision is too much to ask. 
But this theological misstep was not as serious or as grievous to me as the rhetorical dimension of Hannan's letter. Its purpose was not to persuade people to accept the Knights' reasons for donating the stat­ue or even to explain it in any kind of coherent fashion. Its purpose was to offend those who do not agree with him. 
Such passages as the one cited above and the one about, "the excommunication that they inflicted upon themselves by having an abortion" belies an intention to alienate, not to accept back into the Church, those who have made the decision to have an abortion. After such statements·. the statement, "We welcome them with open arms" rings quite hollow. I would like to think that Hannan just feels strong­ly about the issue and that somehow he was typing faster than he was thinking but a harsh and unforgiving intention seems to lie behind his words. 
He (and all of us) need to conscious of the powerful tool (or weapon) we wield in the form oflanguage. It has the power to alienate as well as to embrace and consequently there are responsible and irresponsi­ble uses ofit. Whether he wanted to or not, Hannan's letter reflected on both the Knights and the Catholic Church (who to be sure never authorized such an utterance) and made them look unforgiving and hostile, which the Church patently is not. · 
So where am I going with this? Yesterday's Gospel reading was the one about complaining about the speck in your neighbor's eye but not noticing the log in your own. Abortion is certainly a serious issue, but the Church's and society's attitudes toward it and utterances regard­ing it arc no less so. IfHannan and the Knights are truly concerned about reconciling women who have had abortions back to the Church (a supposition I regard as dubious at best, but with which l am willing to indulge them), they need to be conscious of the attitude they pro­ject and the language they use when speaking about a_b_or~ion. . 
Are they giving lip service to forgiveness and reconc1hat10n, while sending a rhetorical message of condemnation? In Harman's letter, yes. But I hope to see him and those like him embrace an attitude more like that of Bill Fusz, whose thoughtful letter on the same sub­ject I found very encouraging. For a dialogue of forgiveness and rec­onciliation to occur, all involved need to remove the tone of blame and moral condemnation from out language, and to realize that we could be similarly condemned for any one of our faults.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Minus RHCP help, Frusciante's solo attack fails 
By GEOFFREY RAHIE 
Scene: Music Critic 
John Frusciante is certainly a man with some notable musical and lifo cxpl\riences. As a bud­cling guitarist with the Heel llot Chili Peppers he playrd on one of the most important rock albums of the "90s, Blood Sugar Sex Magik. 
Then Prusciantc started to dabble in hardcore drugs. He quit the Peppers. and put out some weird solo albums. Fast­forward to 1999: Frusciante gets his act together, records a huge album with the Peppers in Californication, and officially announces to the music world that he is back. 

Sober and back on his feet, John Frusciante's latest solo album unfortunately does not reflect the growth he has attained in life. 
To Record Only Water for Ten Days is 1-<rusciante's latest solo effort, covering 15 songs in a lit­tle over 40 minutes. 
One would think that Frusciante's latest success and sobriety would produce a thoughtful, exciting release. Instead, the guitarist offers a self-indulgent, pretentious record. 
The most surprising aspect of this disc is that rrusciante's gui­tar playing is anything but remarkable. This might not come as much of a surprise to some fans after hearing his progres­sion from Blood Sugar Sex Magik to Californication. On that album his arsenal of effects seemed to mysteriously vanish as his for­mer funk-filled solos became watered-down attempts at dirty modern rock. 
The work on To Record falls even below the level of Californication. Simplistic guitar figures make the songs impossi­ble to decipher one from another and the melodies are all easily forgettable. 
However, the musical accom­paniment is not the worst part of the record. That distinction is reserved for the annoying lyrics that litter the album. 
Coupled with Frusciante's ter­ribly weak voice, the lyrical sub-
ALBUM REVIEW 
Former Pavement lead hies to make name for himself 


The album's true shining moment comes on "Jenny & The Ess-Dog," the love story of a couple of hippies ­with a dog named Trey -whose age difference even­tually tears them apart ("she's 18,. he's 31/ she's a rich girl. he's the son/ of a Coca-Cola middleman"). The song combines catchiness with a lyrical cleverness that finally gives the album a song that livns up to Malkmus's reputation. 
Though some Pavement fans may be turned away, there's noth_ing too alienating here. On the other hand, with the exception of "Ess-Dog," there's nothing here to expand a fan base on. either. This is the sound of a lost indie rock savior still trying to find his solo voice. 
By CHRISTOPHER McGOVERN 
Scene Music Critic 
As the leader of the seminal-rock group Pavement for the past decade, Stephen Malkmus fought the good indie rock light against all the Britneys and Christinas, the Matchbox Twenties and Third Eye Blinds, the Limp Bizkits and Cookie Monsters of the music world. 
Now that Pavement has officially left the building and Malkmus has put together a solo project, many wonder what will become of the band's laconic-voiced leader. 
Would he forsake his hipster fans and head over to the dark side -a:ctually selling records and being able to afford three squares a day? The cover photo of a shadowed Malkmus striking a dreamy pinup boy pose seems to say yes. 
Don't worry too much, though. Malkmus hasn't com­pletely surrendered yet. Yes, gone is the defiant lo-fi in favor of a more polished pop sound. And yes, the obscure tongue-in-cheek is toned down for more straightforward lyricism. But the bemused monotone dolivery and cleverness remain. 
Malkmus eases Pavement fans into his new record with "Black Book," a dark, droning number that sounds like a Terror Twilight I3-side. The move makes sense, considering many people in Pavement's inner circle hinted that Twilight was basically Malkmus' solo debut anyway. 
But then the album switches gears, and Malkmus serves up the poppy Ween-like "Phantasies," a story about a bored couple trying not to go nuts out in Alaska. The track is not exactly his strongest moment. 
"Jo Jo's Jacket," however, ropes the album's momentum back in. Written from the view­point of "The King and I" star Yul Brynner, Malkmus goes out of his way to be ultra-silly on this track and pulls it off as only Pavement could have. 
Then comes "Church On White," a waltz-tempoed eulogy for the late writer Robert Bingham, and a kind of univer­sally poignant tune about feel­ings of failure as a friend. This is one of the album's finest tracks. 
With some hurts-so-good gui­tars, "The Hook" tells the story of Chris Elliott's nancy-boy char­acter in Cabin Boy and his rise from swabbing the decks to run­ning the ship. "Troubbble" 
leaves listeners

stance is simply terrible. Frusciante must be trying to be an artsy coffee shop fellow with all of his cute little phrases. 'Tm crowded when I'm gone," "Let the pretend take over" and "Soon the hills will swallow us up" arc just some of the juicy nuggets that lead to the conclusion that Frusciante wrote these lyrics while being abducted by aliens. rrusciante tries too hard not to be cheesy and just ends up mak­ing non-sensical trash. 
Frusciante should be com­mended for his ambition, and he does show off an ability to layer various keyboards on top of his guitars.

The Irish will next compete in their own invitational. the Clover Classic, March 24 at Gymnastics Michiana. 
Ultimate 
The Ultimate club's annual trek to the Mardi Gras Invitational was a coming out for the women's squad and some valuable game experi­ence for the men. 

Behind the exceptional layout defense of Mia Stephen and Rachel Kelly. some very strong catches by Julie Schutte and Vinita Ollopally and Allison Hodrick's knack for making timely big plays on offense, the club opened with wins against Washington, 13-0; Texas, 13-4; and Georgia Tech, 13-5, before dropping a tough game to club power, Sneetch. 4-2. 
This propelled the club into Sunday's showdown with Iowa, where a strong comeback fell short as the Irish closed the tournament with a 6-5 loss. 
The inexperience of the men's squad was too much to overcome against this calibre of competition, as the club lost to Georgia, Ohio State, Delaware. Colorado and Emory. The Irish rallied to win their closing match against 
time champions. "If I don't get througha takes nothing pressure on Pete nd win the championship away from my

Perhaps this pressure is no more evident than in Thompson's nickname, "ReDemon" which serves as an extra reminder.

The club will next compete over Spring Break at the Stanford Invitational. 
Men's Volleyball 

Playing before a spillover raucous crowd in the Pit last Thursday, the men's volleyball club dropped a thrilling five game match to Western Michigan. Momentum swung first to the Broncos, as they captured the first game. However, buoyed by a boister­ous crowd, the Irish stormed hack to take the next two games, behind the play of Jon Skokes. with several saves from the back row and outside hitter Brian Price. Western Michigan fought back to claim the fourth game. setting the stage for the decisive fifth game. 
In a see-saw battle. the Irish fell short, 15-13. The team record now stands at 15 -12. and the club will next take the courts at the MIVA champi­onships March 31.

Freshman upsets defending 135-pound champion 
Steinbach survives bloody fight to move to semifinals in 130 -lbs. 
By KEVIN BERCHOU 
Spom Wrirer 
Though he looked very much the worse for wear, senior boxer Tom "Gun" Steinbach was as pleased as can be Munday night after his quarterfinal bout with Brian "The Boxer Hcbellion" Kenney. 
Badly bloodied by a bar­rage of' Kenney connec­tions, Steinbach was forced to retreat no less than three times to his cor­ner for treatment. That, however did not prevent the southpaw from mount­ing a third round charge. 
Battling Kenny's superi­or reach. Steinbach took his wares inside in a fero­cious third round duel that proved the difference in what would be a split deci­sion. 
"I'd sparred him before," Steinbach said. "I just tried to lead with my right and follow up with my left." 
I. 
The second bout of the I evening proved equally
I dramatic. Derrick Bravo, who was not even sup­posed to light due to a foot injury, defeated Coleman Lechner in a fight that was ended by the referee just 29 seconds into the second round. 
"I didn't think I was going to go,"Bravo said. "But my roommate was like 'You've worked this whole time. You have to go."' 
Bravo said he tried to ignore his foot injury. 
"I tried to stay off it at first,"Bravo said. "But I really didn't think about it too much." 
135 pounds 
Tony Hollowell believed he had a shot all along and it turns out he was right. 
In the night's biggest upset, Hollowell, a fresh­man. stunned defending champion senior Matt Fumagalli. 
"He was the favorite," 1-!ollowell said. "But I never go into a light think­ing I'm going to lose. I busted my butt and gained confidence early." 
He cails himself "The Quiet Man" but Ryan Duffey was anything but, scoring a technical knock­out loud and clear a mere 25 seconds into the second round of his bout with Guillermo Tijerina. 
A patient Duffey let his opponent come to him before striking. 
"I felt good in there," said the Sorin College sophomore of his first ever bout. "I figured I'd let him come to me and get tired. Then I'd attack and get in a lot of shots." 
Early on, Duffey blasted Tijerina with a shot to the chin that drew blood prompting the official to end the fight. 
Sophomo·re Joshua Coleman followed up Duffcy's impressive show­ing with a big win over Justin Pendarvis. The speedy Coleman landed a barrage of f1urries, notch­ing a unanimous decision victory. 
Jason McMahon. a junior from Morrissey Manor. rounded out the weight class' action with a hard­fought victory over Christopher Cardillo. 
145 pounds 
Michael "Mad Man" Waldo performed brilliant­ly, serving notice that he is indeed a force to be reck­oned with, as he scored a unanimous decision over Daniel Gonzalez. 
Meanwhile, in perhaps the night's most entertain­ing duel. Andrew "The Golden Arms'" Harms nar­rowly outlasted a very game Anthony D'Agostino. 
After scoring a first round knockdown, Harms thought the fight was in hand. but D'Agostino ral­lied in the third with a last gasp flurry that brought the house to its feet. 
"He fought hard.'' Harms said. "You have to give him a ton of credit. I thought it was the best fight of the Bouts so far." 
D'Agostino concurred. 
"He's a tough kid," the 
loser of the split-decision 
said. "It was a great fight." 
The fight was so great, 
perhaps because both 
brawlers knew precisely 
how to counteract each 
other's style. 
"lie came at me on the 
outside," Harms said. "I 
just tried to get him on the 
inside. It was a good tacti­
cal fight." · 
Jeman "Swiff-T" Tisby 
provided a worthy encore 
in winning another tacti­
cally superior bout over 
Eric Eddy. 
"It was a good, clean 
light.'' Tisby said. "I think 
my technique was a little 
better, but both of us were 
able to get in and get out. 
There were some good 
exchanges." 
Tisby's tactical abilities 
help set up his devastating 
overhand right, an unex­
pected blow. 
"That's not one of the 
punches we work on in 
practice," said Tisby. "It's 
definitely a surprise."

Jason Voss continued his 
rise through the ranks as 
he scored a relatively easy

Nowak knocks out "Polish tank" in round two of 155 pound quarterfinals 
ByJEFF BALTRUZAK 
Spores Writer 
The first fight of the weight class would prove to be one­sided. as Chris "Shezzy" Matassa pounded Julian "Bel Biv" Devoe until referee Tom Suddes stopped the fight at the one minute mark in the third. 
In the first round, it was all Matassa as the junior utilized his superior reach and previous experience to confidently land punches. 
"My reach was definitely an advantage for my jab," said Matassa. "Throwing combina­
tions  was  important for  me,  
especially  landing  the  last  
punch."  

The fight had to be stopped twice in the second round to control Devoe's bleeding. and though he pleaded to Suddes to continue the fight in the third, Matassa was awarded victory. 
"If they stop a fight they prob­ably had a good reason," Matassa said. "They're good about that." 
A furious combination thrown by Tucker "The Wicked Bad Bostonian" McGree might have won his bout against Luke "Desperado" Busam. The split decision awarded to McGree reflected a tight contest that saw neither fighter gaining the upper hand. 
Busam's larger reach keep McGree away in the first round. but McGree was able to get inside to land quality blows in the second. 
The third round saw even exchanges until the final 10 sec­onds to the bell. where McGree delivered a head-snapping com­bination to Busam and may have swayed this judges his way. 
155 pounds 
A couple of future lawyers duked it out in the first match of the 160s when Sean "The Erie Kid" Nowak battled Joe "The Polish Tank" Czerniawski. The first round looked more like the WWF than Bengal Bouts as Czneriawski was warned for shoving and much extraneous body contact occurred. 
The second round was equally violent as Nowak floored Czneriawski in spectacular fash­ion, with Czneriawski almost horizontal before he hit the mat. 
That knockdown caused the referee to end the bout 22 sec­onds into the second round.

160 pounds 
Boxing captain Dennis "Thursday Night" Abdelnour made his 2001 Bengal Bouts debut in dramatic fashion, 
thrashing Vince "The Italian Meatball" Gennaro in a unani­mous decision. 
Abdelnour might have been too fired up for his match, as he slipped and fell 10 seconds into the first round. The referee began to count, but quickly stopped when Abdelnour pointed out he had slipped. 
"I was mad that I went right out there and fell right on my ass," said Abdelnour. 
H_e quickly recovered. Abdelnour delivered blow after blow to Gennaro's head and body, securing two standing eight counts on Gennaro in the final round. He effectively counter punched when

message that 

he is the man to beat in the 160 pound divi­sion. 
"I wanted to take it to him," said Abdelnour. "I wanted to land four combinations. and I think I moved my head really well and saw everything." 
The second seed in the division behind Abdelnour, Travis "Posse" Alexander, faced a more difficult foe in Jeff "He Re" Ream. Alexander out boxed Ream consistently, but never could land any debilitating blows to Ream. 
In the final round Alexander pounded Ream's body on his way to a unanimous decision.

Fighters complete quarterfinals, look to semifinals 
. Myers, Kitalong, Macias win in 165-pound class 
By TIM CASEY 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Justin Myers had a memorable Thursday night. 
Virst, the freshman from Morrissey defeated Tim McCurdy in the preliminaries of the 165­pound weight class. Then, follow­ing Lhe fight, former champion  and fellow Manorite Edward Hernandez offered to be in Myers's corner for his quarterfi­nal round bout. 
Last night, the expertise helped, as Myers beat Brian Berg by a split decision and advanced to Wednesday's semifinals. 
"Edward's a professional." Mvers said of Ilernandez, who. won the title in 1999 but was told last year that he could not fight again in the Bengal Bouts. "He comes in and calms you down. He told me a lot of strategy. He was telling me to go in there and throw a combo and then if I wasn't going to throw a punch, (Hernandez told me) not even to get near him. He knows his stuff." 
Myers deserves most of the credit, however, for his victory. Myers began the fight with an aggressive flurry of punches and backed Berg in the corner on sev­eral occasions in the first two rounds. Berg came back in the third but Myers continued to move around and dictate the tempo. 
"He got a lot of nice, straight shots to my face," Myers said. "He was throwing well. But when I charged him, he really couldn't do anything. I was landing five or six punches (at a time). Ihad a lot of strategy but it didn't end up mattering because he didn't move around a lot. It was more like 1 could overpower him." 
On Wednesday night, Myers will face ofT against senior captain Brian Hobbins. Hobbins, the only fighter in his weight class to receive a bye, opened up his final Bengal Bouts with a unanimous decision win over freshman Patrick Dillon. 
It was a long time coming. Hobbins spent the weekend alone in his apartment, as three of his roommates went to Mardi Gras and the fourth went home to Chicago. 
"It was kind of rough because they're usually around to shoot the bull with," Hobbins said. "It was like a true fighter's camp this weekend." 
Maybe the time alone actually helped the senior, as Hobbins dominated the bout from the beginning. Dillon hung in but could not mount much offense. 
"I felt real good," Hobbins said. "The main part was just getting the jitters out." 
Junior Christopher Kitalong and 32-year old MBA student Thomas Macias also won their bouts last night, both by unani­mous decision. Kitalong knocked down his opponent, Billy McMurtrie, in the third round. When the fight msumed, Kitalong continued to be the aggressor and landed a few punches in the cor­ner moments before the final bell was rung. 
Macias flustered sophomore Clay Cosse with several combina­tions. Midway through the first round, Cosse lost his contact then his mouthpiece flew onto the can­vas. ln the third round, Cosse's mouthpiece fell out again and Macias continued his dominance. 
The action resumes on Wednesday with Hobbins and Myers squaring off in the first of the two semifinal fights. 
"Justin likes to get wild, likes to get in nice and close," Hobbins said. "He's looking good. He's real active but real wild. It'll be a mat­ter ofsticking and moving." 
Myers first Bengal Bouts may come to an end tomorrow. But the memories will last. 
"I was pretty surprised when I won the first time," Myers said. "I didn't really think I knew any­thing. So I'm just really excited I got hero. It's a huge thrill." 
175 pounds 
In the weeks prior to the Bengal Bouts, due to a limited number of participants, the cap­tains decided to merge the 170, 175 and 180 weight-classes. Thus. all the fighters from 170 to 182 pounds are competing in the 175-pound division. 
"I'll probably catch slack for this but it's the strongest weight class in the whole tournament," junior captain Mark Criniti said. "I think any of the captains would tell you that." 
Many of the fans at last night's fights would also agree. Criniti and the three other victors all turned in dominating perfor­mances. Criniti, a lefthander and the defending champion in the 180-pound class, advanced to the semifinals with a victory over Brian Colville. The referee stopped the fight 58 seconds into the second round after Colville had two standing eight-counts. 
"I had a lot of good movement tonight, low to high," Criniti said. "I was working on the body, working on the head. It's hard to defend when you're changing planes so well and you're moving well. I feel like I'm fighting the best I've fought in the three years I've been here." 
Sophomore John Lynk, who recorded a unanimous decision victory over Dan Schaeffer, will face Criniti on Wednesday night. Lynk controlled last night's fight and Schaeffer received a standing eight-count right before the end of the match. 
"John's in incredible shape," Criniti said. "The kid's a brick. He's the type of guy that could hit you twice and you could open your eyes ten seconds later and you're out of the ring." 
The other semifinal will pit Rob Joyce against Keith Arnold. Joyce, the defending champion in the 185-pound division, won by a unanimous decision over Matt Padilla while Arnold beat Nathan Scheid. 
From the opening bell, Arnold landed several punches and may have recorded the most dominat­ing performance ofall the boxers in his weight class. With 28 sec­onds remaining in the first round, the referee stopped the contest after Scheid received his third standing eight-count. 
"That's how we planned it out -Rob, myself, John and Keith," Criniti said. "Just four tough guys that like to get in the ring. We want to give the people a good show. And I think our weight class is definitely holding our part ofthe bargain in showing the fans some good fights."

WOMEN'S TENNIS 
Dasso becomes all-time winningest player in Irish win 

By STEVE KEPPEL 
Sports Writer 

Another weekend gone by, another record for senior tennis all-American Michelle Dasso. 
The women ·s tennis team traveled to Kansas this weekend to take on Kansas State. BYU and Kansas. The sixth ranked women won all three contests and improved their record to 10-2. Along the way Dasso set another Notre Dame women's tennis record, becoming the all-time win­ningest player in both dou­bles and singles with a combined record of 214-72. The 10-2 team record for the Irish marks the best start since the 1995-96 sea­son when they went 17-2. 
"The biggest thing this season is the depth and experience we have," said coach Jay Louderback. "We have experience in the line­up from top to bottom." 
The Irish opened up with Kansas State on Friday and after winning the doubles point scraped by to defeat the 46th-ranked Wildcats 4­3. 
The Irish split the singles matches, with Dasso and Kimberly Guy losing in straight sets. 
"It was a very tough place to play," said Louderback. "We didn't get a chance to practice on their courts and the footing was awful and we didn't adjust too well. We did a good job winning the doubles, and still get­ting the win was big." 
The victory was clinched for the Irish by wins from the middle of the lineup as Becky Varn um, Nina Vaughan and Caylan Leslie all won in straight sets. 
On Saturday, the Irish took on 44th-ranked BYU and seemed to bounce back from the previous day's hard fought match as they went on to win the doubles point and sweep the singles matches winning 7-0. Varnum, who is 7-1 in her last eight singles matches, had the critical victory against Dominique . Reynolds 6-1, 6-4 at No. 2 singles. The Irish looked unstoppable, not dropping a set the entire match. 
"We had played so well the week before and after the tough Kansas State win we realized that every match we have to play real­ly hard, and that's what we did," said Louderback. 
Looking to end the week-. end undefeated the Irish went up against a tough Kansas team on their home court on Sunday. Keeping on track with their solid play. the Irish won 7-0 for the second day in a row without dropping u single set. The trail was blazed for the Irish after a third con­secutive doubles poinl was clinched with wins from No. 5 Dasso/Varnum, Cun~~Guy and Leslie/Vaughan, who all won 8-6. 
The key to tho Irish suc­cess has been their experi­ence and depth. Dasso loads the team in almost every category but there are some other very impor­tant players who have greatly contributnd to their 10-2 record. Orw of thosp players is Varnum who is 7­2 this season in dual match­es. 
"Becky Varnum started off slow this fall but has really come on thjs spring playing at the No. 2 spot for us," said Louderback. "Nina Vaughan has also stepped up to play at three. but Varnum's play at two has been tlw biggest di!Tnrnncp for us." 
The 10-2 Irish aro 011 a roll but will have their work cut out for them next Thursday as they take on 11th-ranked Northwcstorn. 
"It's going to be a grnat match," said coach Louderback, "They arc very strong at the top of their lineup but also vory deep."

BENGAL BOUTS 
Short road to the ring, long road to the top 
By BRIAN BURKE Sporrs Wricer 
Josh Thompson's first experi­

ence with Bengal Bouts was 
not when he laced up the 
gloves as a first year fighter in 
1998. Living just down the 
road in Granger. Thompson 
would come to the Bouts with 
friends as a spectator, but 
never thought he would step 
into the ring. 
"I was actually forced into doing the Bengal Bouts by my friends," Thompson said. "They said if I ever went to Notre Dame I would have to do the Bouts, and I was like, 'No way, I've never gotten in a light in my life.' So I came here and they actually forced me to do it. Frnshman and sopho­more year I got beat up pretty bad, I was close to stopping a few times, but I stuck with it. and things started going more smoothly." 
It probably is not particularly shocking to anyone that Thompson worked through his early struggles and has since emerged as the favorite to take the 185 pound title this year. What is, however, ironic, is that the 17-year old from Granger who had no intention ol' even participating in the Uouts. now helps coordinate the whole show as a captain and co-president. 
"Our secretary wasn't feeling well this year at all so we didn't have anybody full time doing administrative things, so (co-president) Brian (Hobbins), and I together had to deal with phone calls. raising money, that kind of stuff," Thompson said. "Our regular practice time. that two hour period a lot of the time for us wasn't dedi­cated to working out like it was for everybody else, we had to come in early at three and leave maybe as late as seven sometimes to get our workout in. Then in practice between four and six we were answer­ing phone calls. answertng questions, teaching guys. stuff like that. The working out part of it was one of the lesser aspects of Bengal Bouts that we had to deal with this year." 
Tackling the full time job of making one of Notre Dame's greatest annual events possible would have been accom­plishment enough, but Thompson has come too far since freshman year to not leave it all in the ring as a senior. 
Last year as a junior he battled to a split decision victory in the 175-lb divi­sion semifinals over this year's No. 2 seed in the 185-Ib division, Steve Pfeiffer. before losing in the finals. As a senior. Thompson now sees the definite advantages of his experience. 

"l think I've worked even more so this year at getting in shape, I feel more comfortable in the ring, and I just feel more confident," said Thompson. "There's a lot of guys, when they get in the ring, I call them brawlers, they go after you non-stop the entire three rounds. I seem to be more of a guy who's going to wait and look for opening and be real patient. But if a brawler comes at me, my whole strategy has to change. You sort of need to brawl back with him, there's not much you can do. if you don't brawl back you're just gonna get beat 
 
on." 

The other side of the coin, of course, is that this is Thompson's last chance to be a champion. While senior captain Pete Ryan is chasing his fourth Bengal Bouts title, the other six captains are in rather unique situations. 
"One of the funny things is this year. all three of the junior captains. Matt Fumagalli, Mark Criniti, and Rob Joyce have won a championship before. 
"The four senior captains, with the

Huskies topple Irish 
By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 
Associate Sports Editor 
The Irish slid off their blister­ing late-season pace Monday as the Connecticut IIuskies handed them a sound 75-59 defeat. 
The Irish (19-7, 11-3 Big East) tried to pull of their usual feat of' dropping behind early but soar· ing back to victory. but it didn't work against the Huskies {19-9. 8-7). UConn never trailed in the game, and when Notre Dame went for its late-game comeback. the homecourt Huskies were too hot to handle. 
"They soundly beat us," said Irish coach Mike Brey. 
Midway through the second half, Notre Dame closed to with­in four points on two occasions -one following a David Graves 3-pointer and the other after two free throws by Martin lngelsby. Both times. Johnnie Selvie, who was second-half salvation for the Huskies with 12 points. answered with a basket. 
The second time around. UConn kept thn scoring going with a Tony Robertson pull-up shot on the drive, a Selvie hook 
shot.  a  free  throw  by  
Souleymane  Wane  and  a  
rebound slam by Sclvie.
