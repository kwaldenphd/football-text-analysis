Committee to study priorities 
Hesburgh sets plans 
The University of Notre Dame has established a committee to study the future priorities of the institution. 
In a letter to the 12-man committee, which includes six faculty members, four administrators and two students, Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh, president of the University, noted that "no longer can every university hope or aspire to do Pvcrything good or desirable. Choosing becomes a matter of survival in a university world of seriously shrinking resources." 
He asked the committee "to study the present and, especially, the future of Notre Dame in an effort to determine what are the most important and indispensable elements of our total mission, the most essential as contrasted with that which might have seemed desirable under other cir­('umstances.'' 
Father Hesburgh also said that all segments of the llniversitv will be canvassed in the course of the committee's work. and that its report will be made to the Academic Council of the University begore being brought before the Board of Trustees. He gave no deadline for the committee's work. 
Burtchaell to chair 
Chairing the committee is Fr. James T. Burtchaell, provost. who noted that the group was the most important task force in recent University history. "In day-t()--{}ay

Manile--Juan Ponce Enriles, 'defense secretary of the Phillipines, whose country is under martial law, said the power of the gun will be completely eliminated from public life in the Phillippines when the drive now under way to collect firearms from private hands is com­pleted. Not even policemen will carry firearms or knives and soldiers will be prohibitied form carrying weapons when not on active duty, he said. 
New York--Navy Lt. Mark L. Gartley, one of the three pilots freed by Hanoi, said that his treatment in a North Vietnamese prison camp was "humane" affirmed that he had not been mistreated and pictured prison conditions in North Vietnam as steadily improving. He also disclosed at a news conference at St. Albans Naval Hospital taht he had been promoted one rank from Lieutenant junior grade. . 
Washington--Sen. George McGovern whose presidential candidacy was founded on a pledge to obtain peace in Vietnam, will spell out in the next few days a detailed plan to end the war, his wife Eleanor said on a television interview program. Mrs. McGovern said her husband would address himself soon to "specific plans he has for ending the war" The senator accompanied his wife to the 1television studio, but remained in the background. 
New York--How could a quarter million or more Puerto Ricans simply vanish in New York City? This essentially is the angry question that unbelieving Puerto Rican community leaders are asking the federal government, contending that there was a drastic undercount in the 1970 census; that severely injures their political "clout" and chances for obtaining federal economic aid. But the census bureau is standing by its figures.

Student Union 
initiates new gripe procedure 
Got a gripe about Student Union? 
The Union is starting a com­plaint procedure to handle questions about scheduling, tickets, programs, and procedures, according to Gregg Vesonder ,) the union executive coordinator. 
Vesonder will direct the effort 
"to let students know we're in­
terested in their problems and 
trying to expedite the solutions." 
"We expect to handle such 
problems as place and times of 
events, overlapping activities, 
availability of tickets and general 
Student Union suggestions," 
Vesonder added, stressing that 
"the idea is to handle strictly union 
problems, not the things handled 
by the student government Om­
budsman." The number to call is 
7757 or 1758. 
The club's purpose is to serve as a studies and information center for those interested in the Baltic cultures; and to bring the problems of the Baltic countries, currently under Soviet domination, to the attention of other students. 
Fund-raising projects will in­clude a Lithuanian Film Festival, and an excursion to Chicago on October 21 (after the football game) to see the Cleveland Folk Dance group Curlionio Ensemblis. 
The informal studies already inititated include: the per­secutions of minority groups in the USSR; the recent history of the Lithuanian resistance movement; and the developing ethnic con­sciousness in America. 
Next semester's university. accredited courses will include a Lithuanian language seminar taught by Professor Sesplaukis, and possibly a Baltic Culture' course taught by Professor Rubulis. As the Lithuanian language is the oldest spoken i language in Europe, closely related to Sanskrit, it is important! in linguistical studies, and similar! courses are taught at Columbia University and the University of Chicago. 
Anyone interested in registering for these courses, or going on the Chicago trip, may contact Ray Cepulis at 8730.

The Administration's Committee on University Priorities 
The appointment of the Committee on University Priotities is an important, though long overdue one. As Fr. Hesburgh astutely observes, "All ad­ministrative decisions are an act of priority setting." This attitude is a critical fault of the past. Administrative decisions have shaped the university's priorities rather than vice versa. 
There are two major advantages ushered in by the appointment of the committee. The first is that the com­mittee is to take a comprehensive view of the future of Notre Dame. Clearly, financial resources limit the pursuits of the future. Given this limitation, it is certain that a view weighing the relative values of prospective goals is far superior to the piecemeal views of different bodies and personages that are currently guiding Notre Dame into the future. 
The second advantage is that the decision about the university's future is open to the entire community. The committee is made up of students and faculty, as well as administrators. Furthermore, there is the promise that all members of the University com­munity will be canvassed. 
However, on closer scrutiny, this openness is suspect. To say the least, the committee's members were carefully selected. 
It is most significant that not one of the thirty-one faculty members who signed "The Future at Notre Dame", last spring's letter questioning the direction 
of the university under its present leadership, is seated on the committee. At the same time, three of the thirty-one signers of the subsequent letter defending 
the current administration are among the six faculty members appointed. 
More obvious is the presence of only one undergraduate, and he one that was chosen by the administration to represent the students. This certainly seems to be a' less than adequate voice for the largest sector of the community. 
Finally, given past history of Notre Dame committees in general and the makeup of this particular committee, it is clear that the act of canvassing will not insure the respondents an adequate voice inn this most important of all issues. And surely, discussion in the Academic Council, that body which is so completely dominated by the personality of Fr. Hesburgh, will not remedy the situation. 
In short, the powers that be are once again in position to controlthe decisions of this committee. This would be coun­terproductive . Itwould cut the value of this project in half by eliminating the second advantage. 
If the committee wishes to make the most of its enterprise, it must subject its decisions and (!Ccompanying options and considerations to constant public scrutiny. This may make things more difficult, but, in light of the above, it is the 
only  manner  by  which a  meaningful  
decision can be made.  
Fred Giuffrida  

It's Saturday night again. I'm stuck in my room in Mornssey's basement with a jungle of pipes hanging over me and a dead roach lying at my feet. I've been staring at the walls, but all I see is a faded poster of a writhing Mick Jagger glaring across at the scripted verses of "The Sounds of Silence." 
I've been here before -oh many times -but tonight I just cannot seem to pass the hours. I'd go to bed, but there's a dull, driving noise coming from across the hall. The boys are in there drinking again. I did that last night! And you know, for a while, things were really pretty good; but today everything was back to normal. And, what's worse, we wasted last night! Jerry couldn't even remember what he did. But everybody assured him that he was 'the greatest'. So he was contented. 
I used to be a real party boy my first two years. We got drunk almost every weekend freshman year. And last year we alternated drinking with smoking dope. At least, getting stoned didn't leave you with a hangover. Those were the days! 
No, that's a lie! It's pure bullshit. Those days were just as miserable ... but I never said that before. 
Maybe I'd better stop here and go down to Mass. That's another thing! I wonder why I go there-I don't pay any attention anyway. I guess it's just because I've always gone. 
It's a lot like always wanting to go to law school. I wondered about that the other day.' What would I do if I didn't go to law school'? I couldn't imagine! What else do government majors do? Well, at least I've got another year to worry about that one. 
What I'm worrying about now is how I'm going to pass this night. The noise has grown to a din. It sounds like the boys finally got some girls over at one of their parties. That never leads to much anyway. After we make like kangaroos for about three hours, there are two basic endings. The first and foremost is that the girls will leave, as they came, in groups of three or four. Of course, the other road is Paul's specialty. He's been laid three out of five weekends this year! And never the same girl! I wish I knew how he does it. Or maybe why he does it. He doesn't seem any happier than the rest of us -except when he's telling us about it! Maybe that's the key. 
I never tried that myself. Freshman year I had an HTH and I satisfied myself writing letters and thinking fond thoughts. Last year I was too wrecked to do anything. How it's probably too late, Of course, what's coed for'? .. 
No, I'm sick of parties. The noise is terrible. The guys think there is something wrong with me now. "Hey, how come you didn't make the party last night?" they'll say. What'll I tell them'? 
You'd think that all of this knowledge I'm supposed to be getting would help me answer. When you cut through the bull, once in a while, you find somebody trying to answer the important questions. It's really pretty settling to see an answer right down there on paper. There are even a couple of guys who try to live these answers. Maybe they're happy. Maybe they're no better than us drunks. I just can't buy those answers. I can't put by teeth into them. They're just not my answers! 
You know. the one thing nice about this room is that I've got a decent view of the lake, There's something that's real. I can put my hands on it. And on certain nights, the moon shines across it and makes a path­way that makes me think I should follow it and walk on ad infinitum. But wqere would I go? To Holy Cross, I guess; where else'? 
There sure sounds like a lot of girls across the hall. Maybe I'll just take a peek over there after all ...

Letters 
on the war and a memorial service 
This letter was sent to Fr. David Burrell. the chairman of the theology Department, and for­warded to the observer by him for publication. With it, he wishes to announce an organizational meeting for those interested in the proposition of the letter at 8:00pm on Tuesday, October 3 in the Grace Hall conversation pit.--ed. 
Dear Fr. Burrell, 

You probably don't remember 
me. When you were the rector of 
Morrissey Hall I was living in 
room 124. I mostly played Rugby, 
got C's, and drank a lot of beer 
down at Corby's when they weren't 
checking J.D.'s. When I graduated 
in 1970 I was commissioned as an 
Ensign in the U.S. Navy. It was the 
year President Nixon invaded 
Cambodia and four students were 
killed at Kent State. 

When I was in the Navy I learned 
many things. Mostly I learned the 
most sophisticated method of 
killing people from a long way off. 
I was stationed on an Attack 
Carrier which was going through a 
one year overhaul before 
deployment to SEAsia. During 
that year I read a few books Fr. 
Amon gave me before I went into 
the Navy. They were on Non­
violence, and they had a lot to do with why I'm writting to you now. 
Right now I'm doing draft and military counseling in Denver. We call ourselves Rocky Mountain Military Project. Clergy and Laity Concerned has an office right above ours, and every now and then we get together and do a project. The Air Force Academy has been the focus of a number of these projects. 
We have made attempts to speak with cadets, expose them to nonviolent alternatives to war, and to the reality of todays electronic warfare in SEAsia.· We are now prepairing another round with the monolithic war machine and we're wondering -hoping the community of Notre Dame might help us in our efforts. On Nov. 11-12 the A.F.A. plays Notre Dame for their Homecoming football game. During the Homecoming weekend 
.he Academy has a memorial ~~,rvice for Academy graduates ~led, prisoners, or MIA's. We seJ11. the head Chaplain, Colonel John l)enehy, a letter asking if a spokesoerson from our group could join in t(le memorial service. 
Are thete people at Notre Dame who wouni be interested in assisting us 1t1 our efforts to bring attention to tne continueing air­war'? Is there a priest who might write a similar letter asking to be part of the memorial service with Clergy and Laity'? Are students at Notre Dame still working for peace'? If you could assist us in any way or get us in touch with people (student body president'?) in the Notre Dame St. Mary's Community who would be in­terested iH such a project please write, or have them write, or call, or anything. 
In Peace and Struggle, 
Paul Rogers 

This is the enclosed copy of the aforementioned letter to Colonel John Derehy, requesting par­ticipation in the memorial service. 
Dear Chaplain Denehy: 

We hope that you are as en­couraged as we are by the recent release of three American prisoners by the North Viet­namese. We believe that all 'Americans, regardless of their position on the continuing air wa, can rejoice in this hopeful release of American prisoners. 
It is our hope that we might join with you in expressing our com­mon concern over the lives of American prisoners and our common nope for their release. We believe an especially ap­propriate time to express this concern would be in conjunction with the Air Force Academy Homecoming activities the week end of November 11-12. We un­derstand that in the past a memorial service has often been held during Homecoming for Air Force Academy graduates killed, held prisoner, r missing in action in Indochina. 
We would be most appreciative if a representative of our group could have a small part in helping conduct this Homecoming memorial service. We feel this is especially appropriate as everyone shares concern for the release of American prisoners, regardless of different convictions about the best solution to the Indochina War. If this is not possible, a number of people from our group would at least like to attend the Homecoming memorial service. 
We hope that we might share in the Homecoming memorial ser­vice in some way. If this is not possible, we welcome an op­portunity to discuss with you other ways in which we . might express our common concern for the release of American prisoners and an end to the Indochina War.

The Dne Last Weekend 
chicago: good times with old friends 
;asephabell 
Chicago is an incredibly active group-­they tour more than any group I know <I think I heard some figures say something like 80 percent of their time is spent touring). Therefore, it's not unusual for most people to have seen Chicago more than once. 
This was my fifth time, so they're almost like old friends to me. The last time I saw them was two years ago when they came to ND. and not much has changed. A few new faces along with many old smiles and the usual enthusiastic applause for a perennial favorite. 
I suppose the reason I look forward to seeing them each time <normally, seeing an act five times can be a little boring> is the rare enthusiasm the group itself has. Few groups have I seen that are actually happy and joking among themselves. I've yet to see Jimmy Pankow or Walt Parazaider in concert when they haven't been in the best of spirits. Always grinning foolishly, always getting into music that surely must be ridiculously tiresome for them, always heartily accepting applause with a loud "Thank you!" they make the show come alive with more than good music, but also good cheer. 
But they sure don't scrimp on the music. Providing over two hours and a half of solid 
music  is  quite  a  task  for  any  group,  
especially  one  that  tours  as  much  as  
Chicago.  

To list the songs they played would entail listing a good chunk of most of their albums. Some were long, like the "Ballet For a Girl in Buchanan," some short like the ever­favorite "Beginnings." Some were old, like "Questions 67 and 68," some new, like a"A Hit by Varese." Some were loud, like 
"Dialogue,"some were soft, like "Colour My World." Some were received more en­thusiastically, like "Free," some hit a dead audience, like "All is Well." Watching the group more than made up for the dissap­pointing songs, though. Seeing Terry Kath's finger blur on both hands and knowing he wasn't strumming chords, but plucking notes. fascinated. Listening to Walt Parazaider's flute solos. where even the high notes came through clear and evenly, entranced. Watching Dan Seraphine go nuts for two hours pounding away astounded. 
There was one thing significantly dif­ferent about this concert than the other four I've been to. however: the uneven texture of the different songs. The group would sandwich a slow. jazzy song from Chicago v between two rockers from an earlier LP. 
The entire first half of the show was taken 
solely from I and V. Maybe this was to point 
up the long way the group's sound has come 
in the time they've been together. That's 
great for the historians, but it tends to 
dissappoint audiences in live shows. 
Nobody likes to be taken on an unexpected 
roller-coaster ride. 

The second half was a little more coherent. The group drew more from the "mid-albums," II and III. This was what the crowd wanted, and they got it in good size quantities. 
Sure, this concert was familiar; I could almost have written this review before it started. But I still wouldn't have missed it. 

The _li~t~e personal touches the group has a senst~tvtty for, hke incorporating the fight song mto two solos and exploding into this crowd's favorite, "25 or 6 to 4," for an en­core, are more than sufficient cause to see t?e act for a fifth, sixth seventh, and eighth lime. 
The show was a good one. But everybody's always glad to see old friends. 



Little Bir:~ Screen art ferranti 
If you have exams or papers coming up in remember, Crenna was in another fooball the near future, you will never find a better flick called .John Goldfarb, Please Come opportunity than this week to do or study for Home or some such nonsense, in which the them. This week offers absolutely nothing worst team in the world beats Notre Dame until Friday as far as the prime-time in tis most popular sport. For the record, 
movies on TV are concerned. However, tonight is Johnny Carson's tenth An­niversary show and it promises to be the highlight of the week (next to our ND's putting the lid on the Boilermakers Saturdayl. Scheduled guests on Carson's show include Governor Regan of California, Jack Benny, Joey Bishop, Dean Martin Rowan and Martin, Jerry Lewis, George Burns, Dinah Shore, Don Rickles, and Carol Wayne. Film clips of the last ten years will also be featured. · 
Back to the movies. Friday and Saturday nights have the only two good flicks with To 
Sir with Love (Fri. 22, 8:00 pm) and Marooned <Sat. ,16, 8:00pm). In the former, Sidney Poitier portrays a teacher with a new idea for a class in one of the poorer areas of London 'The students can discuss whatever they wish with Poitier helping out occasionally. A girl (Judy Geeson) develops a crush on the teacher and the class tough guy tries to provoke our hero into a brawl. Despite the typical schmaltz this 1967 flick is worththe watching. Besides, some of the class's deviance may help you to liven up a dull seminar or two. 
Marooned has /David Jansen, James Franciscus, GeneHackmanand a number of other "stars" in one of the better science fiction films to be produced after the movie screens were flooded with astronauts, monsters and gorillas following the releases of 2001 :A Space Odyssey, and The Planet of the Apes . In tl:iis one, three Apollo astronauts are stranded out in space and the rescue efforts of mission control and the strain of the astronauts' wives, are dramatized. Just to keep the suspense up for those who have not seen it yet , not all the astronauts make it. 
What is left is worthless. Clint Eastwood portrays Clint Eastwood in The Beguiled · on Monday night in which he gets his' leg chopped off during the civil war. John Wayne plays John Wayne on Thursday night with some help from Rock Hudson in the 'Undefeatea. They aren't. The three made­for-TV films look just as bad. Playmates on Tuesday does not concern itself with Hef­ner's finest but with "swinging couples."Also on Tuesday, 22 has Footsteps About Football with Richard Crenna (also in Marooned). But do not watch it for the sake of football. It is no Brians's Song. If you ND sued for libel. In the lack of originality dept., Rolling Man on Wednesday has Dennis Weaver as an ex-con trying to put back together his life. 
Last week I made some predictions about what shows I thought would be cancelled. Due to a lack of space, the rest of the column was cut off. To avoid allegations of bias I had included a few sentences explaining that I do like a few of the programs listed and that I am not particularly interested in a few that would endure either. This is merely to clarify the matter since a few people have accosted me concerning the predictions. Of course my ego was boosted to find that somewhere this column is being read. 
Trivia Stan Urankar of WSND reminded me that I had forgotten to mention Roger Moore's first series in my first column a couple of weeks ago. He played cousin Beau Maverick in the series Maverick with J~mes Garner and Jack Kelly as brothers Bret and Bart respectively. Incidentally therewas also another Maverick, Brent. A free plug for whoever can name th actor who played him. 
Old radio fans, The Lone Ranger is playing on WSND AM and FM every Thur­sday night at 11:00. 
Starting with this week, I shall have one trivia question with the answer somewhere on this page (if the layout man doesn't forget! ) This week the question is an easy one. If you saw Carson last week I un­derstan.d he asked it and it appeared in the latest issue of TV guide. Take notes because I think you can guess who is making up questions forthisyear's TRIVIA BOWL at An Tostal. ·

best expressed in the broadest terms: to study the present and , especially, the'futureof Notre Dame in an effort to determine what are the most important and in­dispensable elements of our total mission, the most essential as contrasted with that which might have seemed desirable under other circumstances. We cannot have the best of all worlds, but we must plan on principle to achieve what is best for us in our present world, what we can do superbly, and what will in the foreseeable future likely 
be  a  mediocre  or  second-rate

variety of reasons.  

-411 administrative decisions are an act of priority setting.There is however, a deeper need today for setting total priorities within the broadest range of all the op­portunities that face us. 
The work of the Committee on Priorities is the beginning of a reasonably long and very im­portant process that will ul­timately involve all of us at Notre Dnme, since whatever we decide together, we will also have to effect together. 
All members of our University community will therefore, be canvassed in the course of theCommittee's deliberations. Your Committee will have access to all relevant information. Your report will be made to the Academic Council for its further consideration. Ultimately, the Board of Trustees will also become involved. 
I am sure I speak for all at Notre, Dame when I thank you and the members of your Committee for your willingness to bring you best talent and wisdon to this endeavor that will, hopefully, create here an academic institution that is not only excellent in all its endeavors, but viable too, for the long years ahead.

Awesome Irish smash Boilermakers 
by Jim Donaldson Sports Editor 

The officials seemed to be the only people in Notre Dame Stadium who could stop the Irish from scoring Saturday afternoon. Purdue's defense wasn't able to do the job as Notre Damecombinecan explosive rushing attack with Tom Clements' accurate passing to rack up 636 yards in total offense and post a 35--14 victory over the Boilermakers. 
Referee Jerry Markbreit took an almost sure three points away fromthe Irish when he failed to see a timeout signal with just seconds remaining in the first half, forcing Notre Dame to hurriedly attempt a fourth down pass play from the Purdue five which was un­successful. It didn't make any difference in the outcome,
.. however, because the Irish had

If Ara Parseghian were a businessman, instead of a football coach he might have to appear before the Better Business Bureau on charge~ of misrepresenting his product. 
Before the start of the season, he said that he and his coaching staff would be "rebuilding" the Fighting Irish football team this year. Blarney. Notre Dame's business is wrecking, not construction. · 
At least that's the way it must have seemed to Purdue's Boilermakers Saturday afternoon. Loaded with returning veterans and considered to have several first-rate prospects, Purdue took on Parseghian's youthful Irish and were destroyed 35-14. 
The Irish riddled the Purdue defense for 636 yards in total offense while limiting the Boilermakers to 14 late game points and just 39 first half yards, all of them on the ground. 
No one was more impressed with Notre Dame's performance than Purdue coach Bob DeMoss. 
"Notre Dame has great balance," DeMoss said after watching his team absorb its third loss in as many outings this fall. "They've got good ex­perience up front, good running backs, and (Tom) Clements did a great job at quarterback. Their execution is excellent and, anytime a team can r~n inside and outside an pass well as they did, they've got people in a bmd." 
"We couldn't stop them," DeMoss added with a shake of his head. The way the Irish have moved the football in their first two games it's questionable whether anyone can stop them. ' 
Last year, Notre Dame scored only 225 points, its lowest total ever since Parseghian arrived in '64. This season, the Irish once again have an o.ffensive machine, capable of scoring at any time, from anywhere on the field.

Singling out one person or even a couple of players, as the reason for this sudden offensive reversal of form is almost as difficult a task as opposing defenses face in trying to stop the Irish. 
Eleven men,notone or two, make a good team. Purdue had some great individual players, but, as a team, they couldn't do the job. Certainly, sophomore quarterback Tom Clements deserves a major 
share of the credit for the rejuvenation of the Irish attack. 
! 
Intelligent and remarkably cool for a guy playing only his second varsity game, Clements was dazzling Saturday afternoon. His faking and ball handling were so good that it seemed as it he might walk up to 
Purdue's 6'7", 280-pound defensive tacle, Dave Butz, and pull the football

game comparing him favorably with N.D.'s latest quarterback idol Joe Theismann. ' 
Some people had questioned his passing abilities, but Clements made believers of the skeptics with a 17 of 24 performance, good for 287 yards and two touchdowns, against the Boilermakers. 
His ability to pick up secondary receivers is uncanny, especially in view of his lack of experience. His 62-yard touchdown toss to Willie Townsend was a play on which the primary receivers were covered, yet Clements found the open man. 
"I was looking at three receivers on the play." Clements said later. "The first two <tight end Mike Creaney and fullback John Cieszkowski) were covered, and if Willie had been, I would have run. It was a good play-we all enjoyed it." 
Watching Clements operate is enjoyable for everyone. 
Clements wouldn't have been able to pass as well as he did, however, without adequate protection from his offensive line. He got that, and more. As he was quick to point out, "I had all day to throw." 
The Irish front line, center Dave Drew, guards Frank Pomarico and Gerry DiNardo, tackles John Dampeer and Dave Casper and tight end Mike Creaney, has done an outstanding job this fall. 
Very quick off the line of scrimmage, they have consistently been opl.'ning holes in opposing defenses. 
And 'the people that have been running through those holes! Another sophomore, Eric Penick, has given the Irish the breakaway threat they've lacked in recent years. Although he sat out more than a quarter against Purdue with a minor knee injury, he still rushed for 133 yards and a touchdown. In the first game of the season against Northwestern, Darryll Dewan ran for over 100 yards. Gary Diminick ripped off a 42 yard run against the Boilermakers. Andy Huff and John Cieszkowski give the Irish two of the one of the nation's best fullback tandems and it takes a heck of a tackler to bring down either of these two by himself. 
Most people felt that the Irish would improve offensively this fall, 
... although therr performance has exceeded even coach Parseghian's ex­pectations, but no one thought that Notre Dame's defense with only three starters back from the 1971 team, would be as good as it's been. 
But they were unscored upon during the first seven quarters of the season and the two t~uchdowns they.gave up in the fourth quarter against Purdue ~ere meamngless. The Insh "D" was especially tough in the ~arly g?mg Sa~~rday when fumbles gave Purdue possession the football m scormg posttJOn. The Boilermakers went nowhere.

already tallied three first half touchdowns while holding Purdue scoreless and went on to score twice more inthe third quarter· before the Boilermakers made things more respectableby driving for a pair of late game touchdowns. 
Led by Clements, who completed 17 of 24 pass attempts for 287 yards and two touchdowns, and speed.,­halfback Eric Penick, who rushed for 133 yards and a touchdown in 12 carries, the Irish were in control all the way in posting their third straight win over arch-rival and frequent nemesis, Purdue. 
Notre Dame's domination of play was evident in the first half statistics, which showed the Irish with 17 first downs to Purdue's three, 153 yards rushing to the Boilers' 39 and 250 passing yards to none for Purdue. The Irish defensive unit, playing more like seasoned veterans than the youth­ful bunch they are, again turned in a fine performance and it was their play that enabled the Irish Notre Dame to take the lead early in the game. Penick fumbled the ball away on the first play after the· opening kickoff at the Notre Dame 33 yard line and the Purdue's middle guard, Greg Bingham, recovered. The Boilermakers picked up a quick first down but, on second down at the Irish 17, Bill Pedhoretzky was hit hard by fresh­man tackle Steve Niehaus and fumbled. Notre Dame's Jim O'Malley, who seems . to be playing with a football magnet under his uniform this fall, fell on the ball to kill the threat. 
Hastily redeeming himself Penick got the Irish out of troubl~ by bursting for 20 yards around left end on Notre Dame's second play from scrimmage and, after Dewan picked up four yards, Andy Huff hulled his way up the middle for 13 more yards to the N.D. 47. But there the drive stalled and the Irish were forced to punt. They didn't lose the football, though, as, while Brian Doherty's kick was sailing downfield, Purdue was called for clipping and the 15 yard penalty gave the Irish a first down at the Boilermakers' 36 yard line. Granted a reprieve, the Irish wasted little time in taking advantage of the opportunity. Four plays later, in a third and 13 situation at the 39, Clements rolled to his right and fired a perfect pass to Mike Creaney at the 20 and the big tight end rambled into the end zone untouched for the score. Bob Thomas kicked the first of five conversions with 10:12 left in the quarter. Notre Dame's defense stepped back into the spot light again a little later, after a fumble by Clements turned the ball over to Purdue at the Irish 43. Boiler­maker quarterback Gary Danielson was dropped twice attempting to pass in the ensuing series of downs and Purdue punted to Tim Rudnick, whose 15 yard return gave the offense possession at the N.D. 30. After an illegal shift penalty pushed the ball back five yards, Clements and Penick moved the Irish to a touchdown in just six plays. 
A four yard Clements to Willie Townsend pass and a 14 yard run by Penick gave the Notre Dame a first down and Clements followed that up by finding Creaney open behind the Purdue zone for a 30 yard completion that moved the ball to the Boiler 27.
