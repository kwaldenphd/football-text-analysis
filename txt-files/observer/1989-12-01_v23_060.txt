Burglar wreaks havoc in LaFortune break-in 
Philippine rebels try to overthrow Aquino, bomb palace

LaFortune Student Center was 
burglarized early Thursday morning 
resulting in damage to rooms on every 
noor of the building. 
Only $50 in cash was stolen from a lirst noor office. 
The controller's office of the Student Union Board (SUB) and the Office of Student Activities sustained the worst damage. 
The office behind the information desk. the Travelmore office, and the junior class office were also damaged. 
Building custodians reported the break in to Notre Dame Security at 4:50 
a.m. Security had completed a routine check of the building at 4:02 a.m. ac­cording to Cynthia Scott, assistant director of public relations and information. 
Chuck Hurley, assistant director of Security, said that that the number of perpetrators is undetermined at this time. Although there are no suspects, he said the burglar(s) was familiar with the building. 
According to Eric Walters, operations manager of LaFortune Student Center, there were two points of entry. 
MANILA, Philippines (AP) ­Rebels bombed the presidential palace Friday and blasted the only operating government TV station off the air after muti­neers seized the air force head­quarters and two broadcast stations in a bid to overthrow President Corazon Aquino. 
Aquino vowed to smash the "shameless and naked attempt" to drive her from power, but provincial Gov. Rudolfo Aguinaldo said the military was committed to ousting her and rebels were moving artillery and armor from his region into the capital. 
The coup attempt, which has left at least 10 dead and 64

wounded, was the most serious since a civilian-military uprising swept Aquino to power in February 1986 and forced the late President Ferdinand Mar­cos into exile. 
Loyalist troops sealed off Malacanang Palace and resi­dents began evacuating for fear of attack as pro-government snipers took positions on roofs in the area. 
Most banks closed and some with automatic teller machines ran out of cash as panicky cus­tomers withdrew their funds. 
The U.S. military restricted travel by its 40,000 troops, military dependents and De­fense Department civilians sta-
The west turret window of the Travelmore travel agency was broken, but a metal grate prevented admission to the rest of the building. Walters believes the same window was used to exit the building after the suspect rummaged through the office. 
According to Walters, the second point of entry was the handicapped entrance on the north side of the building. He said the intruder broke a glass window on the door and reached inside to gain entry. 
The burglar proceeded to the information desk in the west side of the building. The burglar broke a window over the door of the office behind the desk to enter that office, Walters said. 
The intruder stole less than $50 from a cash register in the office. "A shoe print was found on the cash register that matched others in the building," Walters said. 
At this point the burglar suffered an injury and left traces of blood throughout the building. According to Walters, the burglar rummaged through various items in the office. 
The burglar next went to the custodial office in the Dooley room located across

A rebel spokesman said on radio station DZXL that the mutineers will soon "enjoy the fruits of our hardships. 
"Let's pray together for the enlightenment of those people pretending to be leaders like Cory ... and their henchmen," he said. 
Later, a military helicopter dropped a bomb on the rebel­held government television sta­tion. Rebel helicopters bombed the Philippine Constabulary headquarters at Camp Crame,

St. Michael's investigation complete, results delayed 

By BRADLEY GALKO 
News Writer 
The on-sight investigation of the fire at Saint Michael's Laundry is completed, but re­sults are not expected to be re­leased for weeks. 
"We have not gotten the (insurance) report back yet," said James Lyphout, assistant vice-president for business af­fairs. He added that Arkwright­Boston, the insurance company handling the claim, "is very re­luctant to give us a specific time," as to when the report would arrive. 
He speculated that the report would be issued in ten days to two weeks at the very earliest. 
"They (the insurance com­pany) have done the on-sight inspection," said Lyphout. Di­rector of fire safety, Jack Bland, confirmed this. 
The only preliminary clue to the possible cause of the blaze came from Jay Pamfil, claims manager for Arkwright­Boston's Chicago office. "They (investigators) had a specialist in (fire) origin investigate some chemicals." He added, "They're still waiting for some fresh samples of chemicals." 
Robert Zerr, Notre Dame's director of risk management and safety, said that the insur­ance company is "still running some lab tests." 
"We are involved in determin­ing the cause," Bland added. "We're doing some testing... normal tests of debris at fires." No special tests have been ordered, he said. 
The investigation is being conducted by the Detroit office of Factory Mutual Insurance Company. Arkwright-Boston is one of three Factory Mutual in-

A rebel bomb also damaged the transmitter of RPN televi­sion, knocking off the air the only station the government could use to broadcast assur­ances to the public and appeals to the rebels to surrender.

Bull sessions a necessary evil of college life 
It always begins innocently enough. You walk into a friend's room across Tripp Baltz the hall, pick up a News Editor Emeritus photo album or somn otlwr personal itPm, and a convt>rsation begins. You start talking about all the work you've got to do, your futurP. God. life. the univnrsP, etc. 
Befort~ you know it, you've succumbed to a common collegP phenomenon: the bull s11ssion. Or shooting thi~ bull, the bn~cz1~. the wind. You can get into llllP at any tinw or place, with anybody. although roommates arc ideal bull session partners. Think it's ironic that bull sessions occur most often in the w1w hours of tlw morning, when you'rp awake anyway because you're working on a Wrm paper? It's not. The bull session is just

another way to blow off msponsibility. "Waste of time," my dad always said. "Don't ever wash~ any limn sitting around talking about nothing ~tall." 
/\fter more than thrne years of plunging into topics such as polities, sports, rPiigion and othnr pressing soeial and existnntial concepts, I must admit that not a word of onn of tlwse latll-night talks was ever useful to me. 
Like "Trivial Pursuit." bull sessions are a nwdium of useless facts and knowledge. But are the sessions thems!llves useless'!

These sessions often caine to blows, of 
course, but they always 1~stablished one thing: who was the boldest and most fearsome of the pack, the so-called Big Clwese. 
Today's bull sessions feature the same 
bravado and exaggeration of those earlier 
violent ones. Each tale imparts to its ti~IIM 
the chanc11 to stand alone in the spotlight 
with his opinion, funny anecdote or 
memorable experience. The spotlight shifts 
as oftml as the subject changes, with 
reckless disregard for what's being talk1~d 
about in the first place. 

It's in daily discussion that friendships are formnd and strengthened. Dad was right about the uselessness of shooting the bull. But what he didn't realize was how memorable such times would be. So as long as as tlwre are chapters to be read, tests to study for and papers to write, there will be bull sessions. That's because there are always people to toss the bull around with.

Bush and Gorbachev summit begins Saturday off Malta 
Leaders of the superpowers prepare to work for peace 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Presi­dent Bush headed Thursday for his first summit with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, saying the two have a "powerful and historic oppor­tunity" to work for peace. Gor­bachev, in a speech in Rome, called for a 35-nation meeting next year to speed the integra­tion of Europe.

arms cuts 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Presi­dent Bush's Mediterranean summit with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev could speed up a timetable for new super­power accords slashing arse­nals of nuclear, conventional and chemical weapons. 
"It would seem like all the signs are pointing to quick res­olution," said James Rubin, as­sistant director of the Arms Control Association of Wash­ington. "But a summit resolu­tion to move to completion to all three is the best we should hope for." 
Bush has stressed that the summit will not focus on arms control and that he was "not going to surprise" the Soviets with any flashy proposals. 
Gorbachev, however, is known for doing the unex­pected. and he may try to pres­sure Bush into talks on naval power. The U.S. Navy is rated mightier, and the Reagan and Bush administrations have re­sisted having this put question put on any arms-control nego­tiating tables in the past. 
The general subject of arms control, nevertheless, always is center-stage when the super­power leaders meet. Gorbachev, in a joint statement Thursday

Gorbachev proposes new summit 
HOMI·: !API -Soviet Pn~si­dnnl Mikhail Gorbadwv pro­posed Thursday that a summit of European nations, the United Stales and Canada be lwld nnxt yPar to speed up the inll~gration of Europe and eliminatn East-West divisions. 
Gorbachev said the meeting he eallnd "lldsinki 2" should be movt~d up from 1992 as origi­IHtlly called for under the 1975 IIPlsinki Accords on human rights and serurity in Europe. 
lin made the proposal in a spnt-\eh from the Midwlangelo­desiglwd Campidoglio. Home's city hall. wlwrP the treaty was sig1wd in 1957 establishing the European Common Market. 
Gorbachev said the sweeping changPs in Eastern Europe arc irrevocable. lie insisted they do not signal "tlw collapse of so­cialism." but rather the further dnvnlopnwnt of a concept with nobiP goals and "enormous humanistic: and dPmocratie po­llmlial." 
On tlw eve of his historic meeting with Pope John Paul II, Gorbadwv said that Soviets havn changed their attitude to­ward rPiigion and now believe rnligious values can hPip in the rnstrurturing of Soviet society. 
(;orbaclwv's 20-minute SJ>Pnch. delivered while standing in front of a 12-foot-high statun of Julius Caesar, was in­terrupted three times by ap­plause from scvPral hundred dignitaries. At the end, they stood and clappPd politely. 
Expanding on his desire to build "a common European home," Gorbachev said rncent events. pn~sumably the dra­matk rush toward reform in Eastern Europe, "underscore the desirability of an all-Euro­pean summit. a Helsinki 2 meeting. We could consider ad-

Indiana won't change teen abortion law 
INDIANAPOLIS IAPI -Indi­ana's abortion law for minors is not likPiy to lw afTected when l.lw U.S. SuprPmP Court issuns a ruling on parental notification laws in Ohio and \'linnesota. an anti-abortion altonwy said Thursday. 
Indiana law rPquires women undPr 1 H to havP tlw ronsPnt of tlllP parPnt hPforP tlwy can spnk an abortion. Tlw 19H4 statute was modPIPd afiPr a Missouri law that was uphPid by the na­tion's higlwst court in 1<JH3. 
"I don't think tlw constitu­tionality of Indiana's statutP is at all at stakP in the Suprenw Court cast~s." said James Bopp .Jr., a TNrP llautn attonwy who is ge1wral counsPI for tlw Na­tional Hight to Life Committee. 
Bopp was in Washington on W<~d1wsday observing argu­ments heard mgarding the Minnesota and Ohio laws, which rnquirP notice to parnnts, not consent. 
"Basnd upon their prior opinions in abortion casPs, I think tlw outlook is good for the statutes to bn uphnld," said Bopp.

"Tiw minor may avoid parnntal involwnwnt only by obtaining a court order stating Pitlwr that sl11 is maturn Pnough to makP lwr own abor­tion dPcision or that an abor­tion is in lwr twsl intPrPst." slw said. 
vancing its date from 1992 to, say. as early as 1990." 
The Soviet Union had been 
pressing for an international 
human rights confPrenee to be 
h1~ld in Moscow next year as 
part of the process leading to­
ward the next 35-nation Con­
fen~nce on Security and Coop­
eration in Europe. 
The conference last met in Hnlsinki in 1975. when the United States, the Soviet Union, Canada and all European coun­tries except Albania signed tim Helsinki Accords concerning military security. economic eo­operation and human rights. 
"In the final analysis." Gor­bachev said. "we envision Eu­rope as a commonwealth of sovnreign democratic states with a high level of equitable in­terdependence and easily accns­sibln borders open to the ex­change of products, technolo­gies and ideas and wide-rang­ing contacts among people." 
Although lw did not repeat it in his speech Thursday, tlw So­viet Union has said it is pre­pan~d to negotiate dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and NATO. The United States has rejected the suggestion pending further progress in nuclear and con­ventional arms control talks. 
Gorbadwv, who was baptized in tlw Hussian Orthodox Church but rose through the ranks of the ollicially atheist Communist Party, said the Soviets "have abandoned the claim to have a monopoly on the truth. We no longer think that we are the best and that we are always right, that those who disagree with us are our enemies." 
And he said Soviets have changed their attitude toward religion. "which, admittedly, we used to treat in a simplistic manner." 

Religion has been rejected to some extent in all major social upheavals, not just the Com­munist revolution, he said. "But now we not only proceed from the assumption that no one should interfere in matters of the individual's conscience; we also say that the moral values which religion generated and embodied for centuries can help in the work of renewal in our country. too. In fact. this is al­ready happening." 
Gorbachev goes to the Vati­can on Friday for the first meeting between the pope and a Soviet Communist Party chief. On Saturday, he begins a two­day summit with President Bush on ships in the Mnditer­
ram~an. 
Gorbachnv rejected sugges­tions that removal of barriers between East and West can only be accomplished if the So­viet Union abandons its ideo­logical and social values. 
"frankly, we are often told that we should purely and sim­ply renounce socialism," lw said. "Then. it is said, the world will become a nice and easy place to live in.... This is not the approach that the world needs as it is taking a gn~at turn to a new era." 
"Today, the focus is on the socialist world," he said. "!laving embarked upon tlw road of radical reform, the so­cialist countries, one after an­other, are crossing the line be­yond which there is no return to the past." 
Heferring to his meetings with Bush, Gorbachev said he is convinced the talks will "enable us to take a new constructive step in the movement from mu­tual understanding to mutual action in Soviet-U.S. relations."

Hundreds of Americans leave El Salvador for U.S. 

SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) ­Hundreds of Americans, many waving white f1ags, on Thursday f1ed combat by leftist guerrillas that shattered the peace of their upscale neighborhoods and headed back to the United States. 
The Homan Catholic Church's Legal Aid office meanwhile issued a report concluding that soldiers carried out the Nov. 16 massacre of six Jesuit priests and their two domestic employees. 
Guerrillas fired their first anti-air­craft missile Wednesday but missed the targN -an air forcP A-37 jet fighter­bomber near Zacatecoluca. 25 miles south of San Salvador, a Western mili­tary source reported. 
A rebel statement said tlw insurgents would not use the missiles if govern­ment aircraft stopped bombing, straf­ing and firing rockets. 
Members of the Salvadoran high command have said missiles could sig­nificantly alter the balance of power in the fighting. 
The civil war has gone on 10 years and killed 71,000 people. 
'Tm not coming back," Kate Lewis, a teacher at the American School, said as she carried her 8-month-old baby, Cassandra, down Mirador Street to where a U.S. Embassy official was waiting for her and her husband. William. 

Other Americans f1ashed V-for-victory signs at International Airport and shouted, "We'll be back after Christ­
mas!" In Washington. State Department 
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said "departure is voluntary for all embassy dependents and personnel who are 
scheduled for leave or can be spared. We do not know how many private American residents will take advantage of this opportunity. We are encouraging American dependents and personnel who can be spared to depart." The Lewis home, and 30 or 40 others 
in the exclusive Escalon neighborhood 
in the city's western sector, were taken 
by guerrillas before dawn Wednesday. Hebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, observed a six-hour truce beginning 6 
a.m. (7 a.m. EST) in their 20-day offen­sive. to permit evacuation of those who wished to leave. 
The neighborhood was quiet Thursday afternoon and remaining residents ventured out to assess dam­age and clear rubble. Soldiers moved cautiously along the streets and drew no fire. The last guerrilla snipers ap­
peared to have pulled out from their nests in sumptuous homes. Most of the rebels appeared to have retreated up nearby San Salvador volcano by dawn. 
Czech travel 
restrictions 


to West lifted 
PRAGUE. Cznrhoslovakia (AP) -The govPrnment said Thurs­day it will tear down the fences on its border with Austria and lift virtually all restrictions on travel to the West. 
The Communist Party held its first talks with the opposition, and members of Parliament proposed the repeal of tough laws used to imprison and fine dissenters. 
The party also said it would announce a new program to in­clude "an objective revision" of its attitude toward the "Prague Spring" reform movement of 1968 and the Soviet-led inva­sion that crushed it. 

Spokesman Josef Hora said the new policies might allow for readmission to the party of half a million people expelled after the invasion. They include Alexander Dubcek. who was Communist Party rhief and led the reforms. 
llora said two Politburo members met for the first time with the opposition Civic Forum group and students, who led 11 days of mass protest that top­pled the old party leadership. 
He said the meeting occurred because "we are just one of the political parties in this country, and we have to find our place." Civic Forum pn~viously had met only with PremiPr Ladislav Adamec and other government officials. 
State radio began broadcast­ing twice-daily programs about Civir Forum artivitiPs. and also featured music by singf'rs who had bf'f'n bamwd for vears. 
Govf'rnment spokpsman Mar­rei Jansen said the lntrrior Ministry would begin the "removal of tPchnical equip­ment" on tlw frontiPr with neu­tral Austria. whirh bristles with barbed wire. watchtowprs and trip wires. 
lie did not say wlwther simi­lar action wou.ld bP taken on the long. fortifiPd border with West Germany. 
Hungary started tearing down its border barriers with Austria in May. and tens of thousands of East Germans f1ed across the frontier to thP West.

Vale as the Notre Dame of the East? 
Dear Hditor: 
Professor Alfred rreddoso. in the Nov. 21 issue of The Ob­snrver. suggested that Notre Dame open each school year with a ceremony "like the ones they have at Yale and Brown" which ignores the presence and power of God. lie fears that our tradition of celebrating Mass might "offend or exclude lsomeonel...or make [them[ U.S., where no one would be of our family.

" Perh'llps, if she had been listening, she would have realized that'Mrs. Schlafly said that the best jobs, not the only jobs, for women who also plan to raise a family are those that allow her the flexibility to do both. On the whole, the views Mrs. Schlafly presented in the lecture are barely recogniz­able from the letter. 

It also seems interesting to me that those who have the time to reinterpret every phrase made by Mrs. Schlafly have not noted the inconsistencies in the statements made by the other speaker who came to campus the same week, Eleanor Smeal. While most of Mrs. Smeal's speech was directed toward shedding her image as a radical and painting her views as com­ing from a concern for basic human rights, I find it hard to understand how the array of figures she presented corre­spond to discrimination against women. Perhaps the reason there are fewer women engi­neers than men engineers is that fewer women are inter­ested in science and math than men. Perhaps the reason there are fewer women corporate ex­ecutives than men is that fewer women are interested in corpo­rate management. On the other hand, perhaps it is because there is discrimination against women. But simply shouting "women don't have equal rights until they're half of everything" doesn't tell me which interpre­tation is correct. 
If you were not able to attend the speeches by Mrs. Schlafly or Mrs. Smeal and are interested in their true positions, I do not ask you to believe my letter or to believe one of the other re­cent letters. The only way to really know what their posi­tions are is to read their books or to attend another lecture by them.

a moral majority of one. If he 
should try, the tunnel vision he 
would suffer from could be 
terminal. Yet, I think it's possi­
ble to stand so close to truth 
that it leaves you blind. 
Error docs have some right to exist, even if Christians wish it were otherwise, unless, of course, it's the fatal error of imagining that you're better or wiser than the rest of men by as much as a whisker. How tempting it might be, after 
·christmas break, to write an Observer article that begins: "While other Domers were in Miami for the Orange Bowl, en­
joying the sun, I was saving the 
street people in hell's kitc.hen or 
storming abortion clinics in 
Salt Lake City." After that. if 
you're still expecting stars in 
your crown, forget it; you had 
your reward the minute you 
started taking bows in public 
and by doing so suddenly leav­
ing your elassmates, who had 
to work during break so they 
can stay in school, artfully be­
dewed with chicken-flak. 
The greatest temptation of all 
may be this: after correctly de­
ciding when error and evil have 
lost their right to exist, you 
make the right decision for the 
wrong reason. For whatever 
you do in the name of justice 
which limits evil and error in 
their right to be harmful. you 
are enfranchised to do as a 
Christian, acting on behalf of 
humanity: saving a child from 
abuse, for example, bncause it 
hurts the child; that's your rea­
son for preventing it from hap­
pening. That's what God ex­
pects you to do, and lie must 
feel well-served when lie's see­
ing you doing it with compas­
sion and courage. But it must 
be a form of hubris to think 
that as a Christian, he's put me 
in charge of reducing the num­
ber of sins for whieh lie died on 
the cross. 

In a century of horror, when even the believers am asking, "Where is God'?" I'm as mueh in the dark as everyone else. Yet, everywhere I look, I sec self­appointed prophets, seribbling messages of doom.on the out· house walls. Still, the dear, heavenly Father says nothing, like 01' Man Hiver. lie just keeps rollin' along. But lie stands by I lis promise not to leave us orphans. for lin has sent us the Holy Spirit. whose bride is the Church. Sadly, most of the ehfcken-flak comes from church members carrying on a c:old war with the members of God's family who seem to be out of touch with divine graee; instead of offering the olive branch which symbolizes peace, these alleged by Christian mili­tants ack-ack Catholics who look like losers with anti-air­craft lire that bounces ofT them 
like brickbats. 
The season of Advent should remind the Church of God's great promises: our waiting is not in vain, and it will not last forever. llis love is everywhere, and goes in all directions. If we meet the enemy. hn may turn out to bn us-meaning we our­selves being hateful and lacking 
in pity. 
In God's army, as in Fussell's wartime army, the snipers you hate most may be the petty tyrants in your own camp, who keep making life miserable by their chicken-flak demands. As a Christian soldier, you eould bn tempted to turn in your scapulars. and give up the war. trusting that in God's army, they don't shoot the desPrters. The truth about that is, "Yes. buddy, they do; as a matter of fact, the Christian army is that only army that shoots its wounded." Chicken-flak can I>P as deadly as napalm. unless you deflect it with a disarming 
smile.

Ken Wrnggct continued his hot goaltending by making 34 saves as the Philadelphia Flyers completed a home-and-home sweep of the Pittsburgh Penguins with a 4-1 victory Thursday night. 
Wregget was on the verge of his third career shutout until Kevin Stevens scored a power­play goal with 5:02 left in the game. Wregget now has a 4-1 r(~eord and a 1.42 goals­against average in his last five games. lin made 33 saves in a 6-3 victory at Pittsburgh on Tuesday. 
Wregget made 16 saves in the first period to keep the Penguins scoreless while the Flyers got two goals on seven shots. 
Scott Mellanby scored his first goal of tlw season when lw tipped in Mike Bullard's re­bound at 2:03. Two minutes later, Hon Sutter picked -up a loose puck along the left boards. skated across the (TPasP and lmat WPndcll Young to tlw glow side. 
In tlw third period, Mnllanby fed a pass to Illka Sinisalo. who beat Young with a nvn-footPr to tiH' glovp sidP to give the Fly('l's a 3-0 lead with 10:50 IPft. 
Less than threP minutes later, SuttPr found Murray Crav(m, who beat Young with a back­bander from just outsidP the 
('J'('(LSP. 
Tlw loss was tlw Penguins' third straight and fourth in tlwir last flvp ganws. They are 2-40-:{ in tlwir last 45 visits to the Spectrum, winning their last two games in Philadelphia last season after going winless there in 42 games dating back to1974. 
Habs 6, Nordiques 2 
Mike McPhee and Stephane Richer each scored twice and Patrick Hoy won for the first time in seven tries in his native city as the Montreal Canadiens completed a home-and-home sweep of the Quebec Nordiques with a 6-2 victory Thursday night. 
Montreal, which won 5-2 at the Forum on Wednesday night, stunned the Nordiques with three first-period goals, send­ing starting goaltender Mario Brunetta to the bench. 
McPhee intercepted a pass by Michel Goulet to up Russ Courtnall's goal 19 seconds into the game, then beat Brunetta with a wrist shot from the slot at 4:12. Defnnsnman Jean-Jacques Daigneault made it 3-0 at 11:29 with his first NIIL goal since Feb. 23, 1988, when he was with the Philadelphia Flyers. 
Defenseman Brian Fogarty, tlw Nordiques' first draft choice in 1987, scored his first NIIL goal at 10:23 of the sec­ond period. Hieher, who added his 15th goal in the third pe­riod, restored the three-goal margin four minutes later. Lucien DeBlois made it 4-2 at 
15:53. but McPhee put the Canadinns ahead by three goals again only 17 seconds later. 
McPhee has four goals this season. all in the last four games after returning from an abdominal injury. 

Hoy had lost all six regular-. season games he had played in Quebec, his native city and en­tered the game with a lifetime record of 5-9-0 against the Nordiques. 
The loss left the Nordiques with a 6-19-2 record, last in the Adams Division. 
Bruins 5, Sabres 1 
Cam Neely extended his goal­scoring streak to eight games and the Boston Bruins ended a 10-game regular-season win­less streak against the Buffalo Sabres with a 5-1 victory Thursday night in a game be­tween two of the NHL's hottest teams. 
The Bruins had been 0-6-4 in regular-season game against Buffalo over the past two sea­sons, including 0-1-1 this sea­son. 
Boston completed November with a 10-1-1 record, including nine wins in its last 10 games. The loss snapped Buffalo's four-game winning streak and was only the Sabres' second loss in their last 15 games. The Sabres, who dropped into a tie for the Adams Division lead with Montreal, finished 9-2-3 in November. 
The Bruins' frustrations against the Sabres continued in the first period, when they had 15 shots on Buffalo goalie Clint Malarchuk in the first four minutes and 25 in the first pe­riod, but left the ice trailing 1-0 on Christian Ruutu's power­play goal at 5:51.

Irish wrestlers head to Las Vegas 
By MIKE CANZONIERO Sports Writer 
Tlw Notre Dame wrestling ttarn is on the road again this weekt~nd as tlwy lwad ofT to Las Vegas to rornpl'te in tlw Las Vegas Invitational. After easily winning tlw Mirhigan State Invitational. and winning two wnight classns in thP very com­petitive St. Louis Invitational tournamnnt. tlw Irish (ranked 15th in tlw nation by tlw Amateur Wrestling NPws) an~ ofT to tfwir best start ever. 
This Saturday. at tfw Las Vegas Invitational tlw Irish will farl' sonw vnry stiff rornpPtition from sonw of tlw touglwst wrPstlers in the nation. In fart an t~stimated I00 of tlw na­tion's top 200 collegiate wn~stlers will lw participating. Tlw Irish haw fairPd wPII in the past tournanwnts. placing sev­enth in last yPar's Invitational that rontailwd I 0 of tlw top 20 tnams in the country. 
Irish roach I.-ran McCann commented "This will probably be the tougtwst liPid tlwy have ever had. but I would like to think that we have the balance this year to be bnltf~r there than we have in Uw past". 

The Irish will enter the tour­nament with four nationally rankPd wrnstiPrs. S1mior Andy HadPnbaugh is ranked 12th in the nation at 118 pounds will attempt to continue his unde­featPd sPason. Marcus (;owens a sophomore at 126 pounds is ratl'd 16th. 
All-Anwrican Pat Boyd is rankNI second in tlw nation and should do very well this wtwkend. Undefeated junior Mare Gerardi wrestling at 167 is ranked 18th nationally. The rest of the team has looked strong as well this year and should make an impact in the tournament. 
"Every guy on our squad has the ab!.lity ,It> wir~ s.~lllle matrhns McCann sard. We have some people who can place, and some who ran place high and you need that combi­nation in a tournament like this." 
This is the last tournament thP team will enter before be­ginning it's regular season dual meet schedule against Illinois State on Decf~m ber 1Oth at NotrP Dame. The Irish fare fivP opponents on their dual mePt sr.hedule that are rated in the Amateur Wrestling News top 20. On January Rth. the NotrP Dame wrestlers faee tlwir toughest opporwnt-third ratPd Oklahoma. 
Other tough matches will be against sixth ranked Nebraska, eighth ranked Iowa, twelfth ranked Indiana and fourtm~nth ranked Ohio State. 
"Our kids want tough compe­tition and we have to compete 
t.hat w~ty in ~rder, to pn:pa~.e 
for natronals, MeCann sard. I would just as soon go .500 during the season and do the job at nationals."

Tlw loss is also good for a fpw laughs. A Colorado re­portnr calling in to Lou Holtz's WPchwsday prPss eoni'Pnmen and suggested that Notrn I>anw would havn the home field ad­vantage in the Orange Bowl lw­eause the Miami fans would want Colorado to lose. 
Obviously, this reporter wasn't at the Irish's game this past weekend in Miami. Holtz didn't hesitate to reeognize this. 
Another question was posed to lloltz: how do you bring a team back from a loss'? 

Holtz: "I've roached at William and Mary, North Carolina State. and Minnesota. I've got as much experienee as anyone with 20 years eoaehing expnrience at bringing back a losing team." 
And hey, there's good news on the basketball (Remember? dribble a ball up and down a court and try to throw it through a hoop'?) court as well. Lal'honso Ellis is ineligible! 
Now, don't get me wrong...! know that's not good news for Ellis himself, and generally, it's not something you ever want to see happen to any studPnt-ath­lete. 
But (and there's always a but), Fllis' absnnce ean have a vNy positivt~ pffert on tlw Notrf' Dame tnam. 
Witrwss Keith Hobinson, who has bPPn a quite forcP for thf' Irish in tlw past. suddenly ex­plodP for 26 points against San Frandseo. 


Robinson is just one of the guys tlw Irish are counting on to overcome the loss of Ellis. 
And there are other guys who will get playing time, and with it a ehancP to improVf~. These guys are going to pick up the stark in rebounding, and take over some of thl' scoring. Kevin Ellmy is going to contribute. Scott Paddock has returned to the starting lineup. And fresh­man Monty Williams made a signifir.ant contribution in his first college game. 
All this because Ellis is miss­ing the first few games of the season. 
And when Ellis comes bark... 
Being a poor prognosticator, I'll let you finish that sentence for yourself. 
So even though Andre Ware will win the lleisman, and pm>­ple are paying mediocre base­ball players enough money to feed a country, and the Bears are losing it. and Buddy Ryan's alleged bounties didn't include Jimmy Johnson, remember, there are blue skies ahead, ev­erything's corning up roses, and you have to count your bless­ings.

Saint Mary's hoops wins 
By CHRIS BACON Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's basket­ball team: led by senior guard .Julie Radke, improved its record to 2-1 with a 64­48 victory over Kalamazoo College Wednesday. 
The Belles struggled in the first half of the game although they maintained the lead throughout and went into halftime with a 25-19 advantage. 
Saint Mary's took control of the game in the second half as Radke sank three 
three-pointers  to  help  the  
team  pull  ahead  by  a  ten  
point  margin  midway  

through thn second half. HadkP finished with 26 points, 5 rebounds and 1 as­sist. 
"We worked hard but didn't produce much offen­sivPly. It was mostly a de­fensive game, rather, espe­cially in the first half," said head coach Marvin Wood. "In the second half, though, we dominated. The defense took them off balance and we executed very well offen­sively at times." 
Also contributing to the winning cause were senior forward Amy Baranko with 8 points and 7 rebounds, sophomore forwards Janet Libbing, who chipped in 8 points, 6 rebounds and 2 assists, and Cathy Restovich, who added 6 points and 4 rebounds, and junior for­ward Linda Garret, who tal­lied 6 points and 4 rebounds. 
The Belles will host the an­nual Saint Mary's Roundball Classic at Angela Athletic Facility. Saint Mary's is the tournament's defending champion. 
Fencers in Northwestern tourney 
ND, Saint Mary's commence dual meet schedule 
By CHRIS FILLIO Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame and Saint Mary's fencing teams will take to the road as they travel to Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, to begin the 1989-90 dual meet season. 
The Saint Mary's team, under the guidance of Notre Dame assistant coach Mike Marx, has been training with L'Escrime du Lac fencing club. They will face the contingencies from the University of North Carolina and Northwestern. 
"They're getting twice the coaching and three times the amount of fencing time than they did last year," said Marx. ".Junior captain Heather Briggs is a solid fencer, and both Leigh Voyt and Laura Curtin fenced last year." 
North Carolina native 
Christina  Vellucci  will  also  
travel  with  the  team  to  
Evanston.  
The  Notre  Dame  men  will  

face Illinois, UNC, and the Air Force Academy, but the women will have one less match in the absence of an Illinois women's team. 
"Illinois lost two key kids who would normally give them four or five bouts," said Irish head coach Mike DeCicco. "Those bouts will be hard to come by if the match is close like we antic­ipate." 
In a breakdown of the oppo­sition, Air Force presents a very solid and well-disciplined team. Expected to be quite competitive in the foil weapon, they will also have a respectable epee squad and a couple of good individuals in sabre. 
''I'm counting on guys like Jubba Beshin, David Calderhead and Derek Holeman to provide depth to our epee squad," said DeCicco. Epeeists Mark Gugel. Matt Mergen and Paul Vogt will fence in the dual meet as well. 
The foil squad will once again depend on the skills of talented freshman Noel Young and the leadership abilities of four-year monogram winner Joel Clark. While Young will enter his first true dual meet competition, he joins a veteran group featuring Clark, senior Colin Gumbs and junior Phil Leary, a top returner from last year. Sophomore Mike Trisko and freshman Jeff Piper will see foil action in this weekend's meet. 
The Baguer brothers, Ed and Cris, lead the charge of a small but talented sabre squad which includes the added depth of transfer James Taliaferro and senior four-year starter Dan Yu. 
Last year the Irish anticipated close matches, especially against Illinois; DeCicco fore­warned the team that they would not beat them by the same wide margin as in 1987. However, the Irish dispelled the doubting Thomases by blowing the doors off the Illini, 14-2, en route to a sweep of the tour­nament. 
"Illinois doesn't figure to be as competitive this year," said DeCicco, "But if we go in with the attitude that we can't lose, it's going to be a very dose, tough match." 
The Tar Heels remain a mys­tery that the Irish would like to solve. Added just last month to the tournament roster, UNC boasts a respectable program and some top coaching names. The women's squad may see their toughest competition in these matches. 
"At the Penn State Open they posted only mediocre results," said assistant coach Marx. "They have one of the finer young sabre coaches in the na­tion, and a team that is really ready to work." 
Marx also mentioned that the Tar Heels have some of the nicest sweatsuits in the NCAA. 
The Irish will expect nothing but consistency from the top women's trio of Anne Barreda, Kristin Kralicek and Heidi Piper. Joining them will be monogram winners Lynn Kadri, Tara Kelly and Rachel Haugh. 
"We haven't faced extreme competition in the early part of the season," said women's head coach Yves Auriol. ''I'm using this time to tune up the team and give the less experienced players a chance to gain some experience in varsity competi­tion." 
The key for both the men and women will undoubtedly be the added coaching experience of Mike Marx (foil) and Atilla Tass (sabre). DeCicco confesses that he helps with strategy and practice schedules, but that the trench-work is completed by Marx and Tass. 
"They're both very young, love the sport and can actively scrimmage competitively against the kids," said DeCicco. "These are all things that will be big pluses for us this sea­son." 
After this weekend's action, the Irish will resume competi­tion with their second semester schedule.

another twist to the mystery 
surrounding the 1976 Olympic 
champion, who crossed the 
border into Hungary in the pre­
dawn hours on Tuesday. 
"/\s far as I know. she is 

probably in the U.S. Embassy in 
Berne," Bela Karolyi told The 
Associated Press in a telephone 
interview from Stuttgart, West 
Germany, where he is coaehing 
an Ameriean women's gymnas­

"She is waiting to get some 

travel papers." said Karolyi, 
who defected to the United 
States in 1981 and beeame a 
citizen in May. 
Michael Korff. a U.S.

to everybody at the embassy. 
She isn't here. She wasn't

Swiss Justice Ministry spokesman .loerg Kistler said "wp have had absolutely no hints whatsoever that she has bPPn in SwitzNland." 
Asked about the possibility of a f!)union with his fornwr pupil in Stuttgart. where his team is competing, Karolyi said: "Tiwre is a possibility. but she obviously needs some travel documents." 
On Wednesday from Clarens, Switzerland, Karolyi told the AP he was "ready to help her in any manner if she needs it." 
Karolyi said he had not spo­ken with Comaneei since her flight, although he told the U.S. Gyrnnasties Federation in Indianapolis: "My kid is looking for rne. " 
1: e d !! ration spokesperson Patti /\uer said she had no idea where Comaneci was but said: "/\II indieations dearly point to

"Bela fnels she would be safest in Switzerland, in a neu­tral country. and then eome to the United States via Switzerland, not through any other country. We seem to think he knows what she will do." Auer said. 
Auer quoted Karolyi as saying Comaneci is in danger of bning picked up. 

"If they (Homanian security forces) order the Swiss police to get hold of her, she'd be taken back," he said. 
lie was asked how he knew Comaneei was going to Berne? 
"A person has been calling. The last message said she was going to go to Berne, would call me from Berne and would go to the embassy," he said. "I be­lieve she is there. Switzerland is the only country security forces can't freely run around." 
What are her chances of joining him in Stuttgart?

Irish basketball squads face first test of season 
Women battle #1 ·· Men to meet #13 Louisville 
... 
Lady Volunteers 
By DAVE DIETEMAN Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's basketball team faces off against the top-ranked Lady Volunteers of Tennessee this coming Sunday at 2 p.m. in the Joyce ACC. The Irish hope to brmtk the Indiana state record of SHOO fans at a women's col­lege basketball game. 
This past weekend the Irish captured first place in the Cnntral Florida Hotary Classic in Orlando, Florida. Notre Dame moved its early season record to 2-0 by trouncing Libmty 113-35 and host Central Florida H1-61. Sophomore Comalita llaysbert (32 points, five assists, five steals) was named the Hotary Classic MVP, while juniors Karen Hobinson and Sara Liebscher, who scored a combined 51 points in the two games, were named to the All­Classic Team. 
The Irish broke numerous reeords in their trip to Florida, as Sara Liebscher, Deb Fitzgerald, Comalita llaysbert,

Maybe it isn't so bad... 
!ley, maybe it's not so bad after all. I mnan, let's look on the bright side here, lind the silver lining in all these clouds, the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, and whatever other silly eliches I can think of. 
Notre Damn lost to Miami. Now, that is bad. My dad hates Miami so mueh hn may not root for Notre Theresa Kelly Damn in the Orange Bowl if a Colorado loss gives the Hurricanes Sports Editor the national championship. Most of us would rather have lost to SMU and Navy than Miami. They are just inherently hatable, even without Jimmy Johnson. 

But, if you've gottnn over it, and that's a big if, I know, look at it this way-all the pressure is off. Notre Dame ean go play football now, and not worry about keeping the streak alive or being embarrassed by losing to or beating up on some marshmallow. The Irish are fallible; it's not fun anymore to make your team's top priority beating Notre Damn. 
The pressure is on Colorado now. They deserve the top ranking in the country, and they deserve the national championship if they beat Notre Dame. But they know that won't be easy. They know Notre Dame has big-game nxperinnee, both in games with championship ramilica­tions and in Miami. The Orange Bowl will be fun, good football, with no real hatred involved.

INDIANAPOLIS Keith Hobinson and Tim Singleton certainly aren't getting mueh of a reward for their impressive outings in Tuesday's season­opener. 
Notre Dame, 1-0, faces 13th­ranked Louisville at 2 p.m. Saturday at the third annual Big Four Classic. With center Felton Spencer and point guard LaBradford Smith, the Cardinals have two players who ligure to match up pretty well with Robinson and Singleton. 
The 19th-ranked Fighting Irish take on Louisville in the lirst game of Saturday's college basketball doubleheader at the Indianapolis Hoosier Dome. In the second game, 14th-ranked Indiana meets Kentucky. 
"Spencer's the most improved big man I've seen," said Irish coach Digger Phelps. "LaBradford Smith can post you up and seore inside, yet he's also a great perimeter player." 
Louisville opened the season last week by winning two of three games in the Maui 
Classic. The Cardinals beat 
Chaminade 89-70, lost to lifth­
ranked Missouri 82-79, then 
defeated Villanova 83-69. 
Against Missouri, thn Cardinals 
rallied from a df~licit of more 
than 20 points bnforn losing on 
a last-minute goaltending call. 
In Tuesday's 84-64 Irish win over San Francisco, Hobinson scored a career-high 26 points on 1 0-of-11 shooting, while Singleton dished out nine as­sists and effectively took Dons point guard Kevin Bell out of the offense. 
But Kevin Bell is no LaBradford Smith. A 6-3 junior who set a Cardinal n~cord with 184 assists last year, Smith has come a long way since his lirst collegiate game. Smith opened his career with Louisville by fouling out and allowing Notre Dame's David Hivnrs to burn him for 32 points.
"He's gotten morn mature and has toned his game down," said Louisville assistant coach Jerry Jones. "lie's improved a lot each season." 
Spencer may have improved even more. A 7-foot, 265­

Ware leads race for Heisman 
By THERESA KELLY Sports Editor 
NEW YORK-Houston quar­terback Andre Ware appears to have the inside track at winning the 1989 Heisman Trophy, fol­lowed by West Virginia quar­terback Major Harris neck­and-neck with Indiana's star running back, Anthony Thompson. 
In Houston's Ware-geared offense, he has completed 329 passes in 527 attempts, to­talling 4,299 yards 44 touch­downs, three less than the NCAA season record. And he has one more game to play. against perennial weakling Rice. With an all but guaran­teed 273 yards against the Owls Saturday, he can break the Division 1-A record for season yardage. 
Against Temple in the Cougars' third game of the sea­son, the 6-2, 210-pound Ware was 30-of-45 with seven touch­downs. He threw for a season­high 517 yards against playing in just the lirst half. He went over 500 yards three times, and has surpassed 400 yards seven times. He leads the nation in total offense. 

Possibly the only strikes against Ware are allegations of stat-padding against inferior opponents and his team being on NCAA probation. Ware has said in the past that the award is for the best player. not the team. 
Banking on the team effort is Notre Dame quarterback Tony Rice. Hice was tabbed a leader in the lleisman race after lead­ing the Irish to the national championship in the Fiesta Bowl in January. eompletcly overshadowing the more highly-touted Harris. Rice's numbers, 884 yards rushing and seven touchdowns on the ground, 68-of-137, nine inter­ceptions, two touchdowns in the air, don't eome anywhere close to Ware's, but his 11-1 record this season and 23 straight wins over the last two seasons can't be matched by any eandidate. 
The loss to Miami last Saturday has all but crushed Hice's hopes, even though some ealled him the frontrunner just before the game. Many ballots were cast before that, but they will probably not be enough to get Hice the trophy. 
Splitting the Indiana vote with Rice is Hoosier star Johnson. With 24 touchdowns this season and 1, 793 yards on 358 carries, he is the best run­ning back of the Ilnisman linal­ists. lie leads the nation in rushing, but a season-ending loss to Purdue may have damp­ened his hopes. Bien's presenen in the field may hurt Thompson's chances, as the two will split the Midwest vote. 
Consistency is on the side of I Iarris, who has 144 carries for 919 yards and has passed 131­of-224 for 1,939 yards and 16 touchdowns. While up-and­down games havn marred all the candidates except Ware. Harris has benn a stnady force all season. 
Both Ware and Florida's Emmitt Smith were invited to

NO Hockey faces Mavericks 
By MIKE KAMRADT Sports Writer 
Last year, the Notre Damn hockey team took gnmt strides toward becoming a top Division I hockey team. Although their 10-26-2 record may lead one to wonder how, the 198H-89 sea­son pitted the Irish against some of the best teams in colle­giate hockey. 
The Irish eontinue to l'aec that kind of eompetition this year. They have already beaten Michigan-Dearborn, a lixture in the NCAA playoffs for years, and a tough, physical St. Cloud St. team. This Friday and Saturday the Irish will continue what is proving to be a very successful season when they take on the Mankato State (Minn.) Mavericks at 7:30. 
The Mavericks, a Division III hockey team, compete in the Nortlwrn CollngiatP llock~Y Association. Mankato StatP sports a 3-3-2 record thus far this season. The strength of thnir team is evidnnt wlwn o1w considers the fact that tlwy took last year's Division Iii champ Wisconsin-Stnvens Point to the limit bdore succumbing in a four-ovPrtimn alTair. 
Although thn Mavericks arP not showing a groat deal of of­fensive prownss ( 4.0 goals/game), thny proV!~ to be a stingy team whnn it eonws to giving up goals. They've only given up 3.41 goals a ganw, which may stand as quite a challenge to the high0pownrnd Notre Damn offense. 
"They're a good hockey team with good Minnesota hockey players," explained Irish coach Ric Schafer, "Most of them arc
