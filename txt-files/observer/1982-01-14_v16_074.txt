The speciality items will include two soups, cold cuts, cheeses, breads and potato chips. Students will choose their sandwichesnd kitchen employees will prepare them.

Kosimierz Braun, a professor scheduled to join the ND-SMC Communications and Theatre Department, has been unable to leave Poland because of martial law restrictions limiting travel of Polish citizens.

Strip-search policies must be the same for men and women in order to be legal, a federal judge has ruled in a class-action suit against the Chicago Police Department. U.S. District Judge Thomas R McMillen ruled Tuesday that the department's pre-1979 policy ofroutinely strip-searching women violated equal protection rights because men were not routinely subjected to strip searches. The suit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in 1979 on behalf of 191 women who said they had been strip searched by police matrons. The judge has not yet set damages. After the suit was filed, the city offered to pay 5250 to each woman subjected to a simple strip search and $1,000 to all women who claimed they un­derwent a body cavity search. Ninety women accepted. -AP 
Two Baltimore, Md. teenagers have been charged with murder in the weekend slaying of an art restoration expert, police said. The nude body of Peter Michaels, 54, was discovered Monday at his home. He had been stabbed to death, police said, and his car and several firearms at his home had been stolen. Police charged Ralph Mills, I 7, and Bobby Oxentine, 14, with murder, and they were being held without bail according to Dennis Hill, a spokes­man for the police department. Hill said the teenagers met Michaels in downtown Baltimore on Saturday and that Michaels took them to his home in the Mount Washington section ofthe city. Michaels was an associate conservator at Walters Art Galley until starting his own business in 1974. He specialized in the restoration of paintings. ­

An anonymOUS Caller in Bilbao, Spain told a newspaper yesterday that the Basque guerrillas who kidnapped German-born industrialist josef Lipperhcide on jan. 5 were treating him well. The caller to the Basque militant newspaperEgin said the 76-year-old industrialist was "in perfect health" and that ETA guerril­las would soon announce conditions for his release. Lipperheide, who came to Bilbao in the early 1920s, is the head of more than a dozen firms in northern Spain. The industrialist's relatives said his abductors told them at the time of the kidnapping they planned to demand "a huge ransom." -AP

Plunge broadens urban p~rspective 
During semester break I participated in the Urban Plunge, a 48-hour immersion into urban life designed to enable Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students to ex­perience the problems of injustice, poverty and apathy in U.S. urban areas. 
I was one ofsix students assigned to Saint Malachy's, a 
Catholic parish located on the West Side of Chicago. 
Our hosts were Father St<:phen Mangin, Father john 
Kobur, Sister Mary Robertus, and Sister Maude. 

St. Malachy's is in an area which includes two high· 
rise housing projects and several vacant lots. "There is 
not one complete block in the area," Fr. Stephen noted, 
adding that much ofthe damage resulted from the 1968 
riots. "Some ofour nuns were here during the riots," he 
said. "They watched as property was burned, and saw 
people standing in front of their homes and schools to 
protect them." 

Ethnically, the general area includes Ukranian, 
Italian, Hispanic and black residents. Fr. john, however, 
noted "ethnic stratification". "Most whites are assumed 
to have a negative purpose in this area." he said. "White women are generally assumed to be prostitutes, and white men narcotics agents." 
Fr. John led our group on a walking tour of the West Side area surrounding St. Malachy's. As we walked by

Fr. Joachim of nearby Our Lady of Sorrows parish, who grew up in the Cabrini neighborhood, expects the Cabrini-Green housing project to change drastically within the next few years. The mortgage on Cabrini-Green will be paid in 1983, and Fr. Joachim claims there are plans to convert it into a luxury apartment complex. 
"This is gradually taking place," Fr. Joachim said. "The tenants are systemmatically being removed from the buildings, and the surroundingarea is beingcleared. It is in the perfect location for a luxury complex -a ten minute walking distance from the Loop. Eventually, this will take place over the entire West Side. I think the people currently in this area will migrate to the sub­urbs. Suburban housing is constructed more poorly than the buildings in this area," he said. 
We visited one ofthe tenants in that first project. Dol­
ly, a 25-year-old wife and mother of two, lives on the 
fifth floor of the building with her husband Red, a 20· 
year old laborer. Dolly is taking classes at a local junior 
college to qualify for nursing school. She noted the high 
incidence ofviolence in the housing projects. "I would

not advise anyone to live here because ofthe violence," she said. "People hurt you for no reason -all you have to do is be in the building to pwvoke them. I have lived here for eighteen years, and have adjusted to the condi­tions. I don't mind living here." 
Dolly added that the police don't seem to cate about the violence, and rarely respond to calls. " Once a man in this building was beaten and thrown out of a win· dow," she said. "The ambulance arrived, and though he was still alive they dragged him to the vehicle instead of placing him on a stretcher and carrying him. Even if they thought he was dead, they could have carried his body on a stretcher -he deserved that respect as a human being." 
Fr. John claimed that he found a dead woman on a 
street corner last year. "I 
called the police, returned

declined. We walked about five miles in the area with· out difficulty. Mayor Byrne called this area a "public disgrace", Fr. john said. This neighborhood averages one shooting and two rapes per night. These crimes rarely appear in newspapers because they are black-on­black crimes, and usually only interracial crime makes news, according to Fr. Stephen. 
"Our school janitor was shot in the stomach with a .44 Magnum one night last year behind a housing project," Fr. John said. "He was driven by ambulance to a hospital that was not equipped for the treatment he required, and the ambulance would not take him to Cook County, a nearby hospital, unless we paid a $70 cash fee. We managed to collect the money, and he went into surgery at 9 am. He died of shock shortly after surgery." Both priests believe that he would have survived had he been treated immediately following the injury, which could have been accomplished. 
We passed a post office where one ofthe parishoners at St. Malachy's claimed she entered to find a man lying in the middle of the floor with a knife in his stomach. She reportedly stepped over him and completed her transaction

One oftkial who plays a key role in designing the GOP's 1982 dec­

The story of Richards' failure to keep up payments on 5292,000 in loans guaranteed by the Small Husi­ncss Administration was published Wcdnesday in The Washington Post. 
A spokesman for Richards con­firmed the details of the story and said the chairman would not com­ment on the matter. 
New phone directories provide additional info 

By MARK WORSCHEH 
StaffReporter 
New telephone directories have been received and are scheduled to be distributed next week, according to Carl Magel, Director of Printing and Publications. 
Magel said that the installation of the new faculty phone system neces­sitated the change. Faculty and ad­ministration phone numbers now begin with a 239 prefix and require students to dial "9" first. 
"The old directories just didn't 
have sufficient information," said 
Magel. "We thought it was 
worthwhile enough to do this and 
prote1.:t the invl·stmcnt (in the new 
system). We wanted to do it first 
class." 
In addition. \-!agel said that a new roll of students from the registrar's office was used, hopefully correct­ing the omissions in the previous edition. 
The directory is generally supplied free of charge to· the uni­versity, explained Magel. 
"The printers of the book do this because they get permission to sell ads to people in the community. Whatever monies they get from ads is what they get." 
Ombudsman Director Tom Koegel said the directories will be distributed through the Hall Presi­dents Council "sometime early next week." 
Upon recetvmg the new direc­tories, Magel advises students to throw away their old phone books to avoid confusion.

The loans were ued hy Richards and a partner to purchase the American Health and Sports spa in Roy, Utah in 1977. His original partner in the venture was a Utah neighbor, Lew Wangsgard, who later sold his interest to Alex Hutardo, who now heads the political division of the Republican National Commit.­
tee. 
After Richards and his partner failed to make 12 monthly payments on one Sl I 0,000 loan, the SHA had to pay S96,203 to the Bank of Utah. The partners also are behind in pay­!llents on a Sl81,000 loan. 
The S I 10,000 loan was brought up to date last November with a $20,454 payment. But payments of $1,000 due in November, Decem­ber and january were missed. 
"The main reason I don't pay it is I don't have the money to pay it," Ric­hards told The Post. 
The chairman also said he told the acting director ofthe SBA's Salt Lake City office, C. Dale Randall, that "I don't want to be given any special privilege." 
The newspaper quoted SBA offi­cials as saying they expect Richards and his partner to make good on all the payments. The officials said the two part/ ners had pledged their private homes as collateral.

Veteran's wife 




War follow-s husbands hotne 
The Observer 

ByNANCY TRAVER 
AssociatedPress Writer 
DENVER (AP) -The wives of Vietnam veterans have never watched a buddy die, carried an M­16 rifle or survived in a jungle half a world away. But for many women, 
the war has come home with hus­bands unable to put Vietnam behind them. 
"There are plenty of programs for vets, but their wives are secondary. Many times, I find women suffering even more than their husbands, be­cause they have nowhere to go for help," said psychologist Candis Wil­liams, who, as the wife of a Vietnam veteran, has pioneered a counseling program for other wives. 
Nearly one million American sol­diers served in combat in Vietnam, and half still suffer from the stress they experienced during the war, it seemed they had nowhere to go for help." 

Before she could help the women, she had to learn about what was bothering their husbands, Ms. Wil­liams said. She was able to find the answers to most of her questions by turning to her own husband, who served in Vietnam for two vears. 

Williams said he "buried" most of his memories after his return home from the war. It wasn't until 1979, when he saw the movie "The Deer Hunter," which told the story ofthe war's effects on a group ofmen from a small Pennsylvania town, that Wil-

Heavy women may risk chance of diabetes 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Women 
who are overweight in their upper 
bodies face an increased risk of 
having undiagnosed diabetes and 
should be tested for the disease, are­
searcher said yesterday. 
A study at the Medical College of Wisconsin found that the location of fat in the body can help predict whether a woman has diabetes long before symptoms appear. 
Obese women with most of their fat located in the upper body -the waist, chest, neck and arms -are more likely to be diabetics than those with fat concentrated in lower body areas such as hips, thighs and buttocks, researchers found. 
Dr. Ahmed H. Kissebah said an upper-body obese woman has eight times greater risk of having clinical diabetes than a woman of normal weight. Those with lower body obesity showed little or no in­creased risk. 
Speaking at a Milwaukee news Iiams began to relive his war ex­periences. 
"The war invaded the fabric of veterans' lives their sleep, employment and all their relation­ships," causing loneliness, depres­sion and a refusal to accept responsibility, he said. 
"Women in some of my counsel­ing sessions say they feel they are ex­pected to give and give and give," said Ms. Williams. 
A veteran's wife must learn she need not be "wife, mother, nurse, lover and breadwinner," she said. "To be healthy, women have to get into learning what they want and what they need to be happy." 
For some women, that may re­quire leaving their husbands. 
briefing that was monitored by reporters throughout the country, Kissebah said the risk goes down with dieting and loss ofthe fat. 
"What is heartening is that it is relatively easy to identify those women at risk and to take early measures to reduce upper body seg­ment fat," he said. 
"This reduction lowers the risk of such metabolic disorders as diabetes, as well as high blood pressure and heart disease," he con­tinued. 
The researcher said about 40 per­cent of American women are overweight and of these women, 25 percent have upper body obesity. 
Kissebah said the findings should encourage doctors to make a more serious effort to persuade women to lose weight. 
Women with fat upper bodies also should ask their doctors to test them for diabetes so that treatment, which normally consists of weight control and special diets, can begin as soon as possible ., he said. Insulin injec­tions normally are prescribed only in extreme cases. · 
Diabetes is a condition that keeps the body from metabolizing sugars. Insulin, a hormone that helps the body use sugar, either is not produced in sufficient quantities or there is an inability to use the insulin that is produced. 
Some studies indicate that early diagnosis and treatment result in better long-term outcomes for patients, said Kissebah, director of the college's General Clinical Research Center, a special human studies unit funded by the National Institutes of Health. 
The association between upper body obesity and diabetes was first identified by French researchers in the 1970s. The relationship was con­firmed in 1980 by the Milwaukee researchers after studying 15,000 
obese  women  from  around  the  
country.  
To  examine  this  relationship  
more  closely,  the  researchers  

compared 52 women between the ages of 20 and 40 -25 with upper body obesity, 18with lower body fat and nine ofnormal weight who were used as a control group.

WARSAW, Poland (AP)-Big Sis­ter is warning telephone callers their conversations arc "being con­trolled" in martial law Poland these days. 
Since telephone service in Poland's major cities was n:storcd last Sunday, some numbers start a screechy-voiced woman chirping, "Rozmowa Kontrolowana, Roz­mowa Kontrolowana." 
In Polish that means "the call is being controlkd, the call is being controlled." 
The voice of Big Sistt:r changl'S, ~ometimcs high, sometimes a bit huskier. But the message is dear: anything said on the phone may be heard and thae should be no doubt about it. 
Big Sister -a variation on Big Brothl·r, the symbol of dictatorship 
in  (ieorgc  Orwell's "1984"  - is  
what  !(>reign  journalists  have  
dubbed the Polish voice.  

<>n the tirst day the tcll·phones l·ame hack after 29 days of sikncc, tlw intrusion was often inconsistl:nt. 
People testing the telephones, working for the tlrst time since just before midnight Dec. 13 when mar­tial law began, found that some num­bers triggered Big Sister, while others did not. 
Calls to the Roman Catholic Church press office were said to be under control by the voice, as were calls to some others who one could assume would be monitored. 
But it was unclear later ifthe voice was triggered by the person placing the call, or the phone number receiving it. 
Two days after the phones were back in order, every call from The Associated Press office phone brought the warning "the call is being controlled," two or three timcs. Then the voice stopped and the other party either did or did not pick up the phone. 
It was not the fact of the warning, but only the form it took that came as a surprise. 
In an annomKement that telephone Sl'n·;,.,. "'""'" ht· 

restored within the nation's big cities, the authorities said that the calls would be subject to control and could be cut at any time if whoever was listening deemed them damaging to the state. 
The communique also warned that telephone conversations could be subject to further checking and anti-state activity could be punished. 
Some people reported that calls were cut when such words as "internees" were used in conversa­tions about seized members of the now-suspended independent union Solidarity. 
But others said use of the word "Walesa," name of the now­sequestered chief of the indcpend­cnt union, and "Solidarity" did not trigger a cutoff. 
It is unlikely that every singlc call is monitored, but it is impossible to tell which arc or arc not and the ef. feet of thc woman's reminder is clear.

Four Irish players reached double 
figures in the contest. In addition to 
Schueth, Ruth Kaiser, playing in

relatives that out-numbered the St.

scored nine first-half points and

In order to capture the title ofthe Dial Classic, Notre Dame had to defeat Creighton and Marquette. The Irish overcame a slow start to defeat Creighton in the opener, 69­

Marquette had defeated Notre Dame twice in a row, including a 21­point victory a~ the ACC in 191::10. But excellent team defense and good rebounding enabled the Irish to triumph this time, taking a 50-36 decision. Freshman guard Laura Dougherty led the Irish with 1 5 points. Tile Irish shot 74 percent ( 14 of 19) from the free throw line and allowed the Warriors to go to the line only twice in the contest. Schueth, who scored 24 points and grabbed 1'i rebounds during the tournament, was named the Most Valuable Player. Kaiser was named to the all-tournament team. 
"We learned some valuable les­sons during the trip," she said. "We definitely need to concentrate more on playing to our own potential and not the level of our opponents. We should have won a few games by lar­ger margins. But overall, we played very well."

This week, the Irish decided to revamp their show. Things obvious­ly weren't working out, and a change was mandatory. 
So they watched South Carolina take San Francisco to overtime. Then, in the best Milton Berle tradi­tion, they stole all the good punchlines.

Haw keyes, Buckeyes 
hit the road tonight 
ByJOE MOOSHIL 
APSports Writer 
Iowa's fifth-ranked Hawkeyes and 
Ohio State's red-hot Buckeyes hit 
the road this week with high hopes 
of keeping intact their perfect Big 
Ten basketball records. 
Both teams were off to quick 
starts last week, each nailing a pair of 
victories to climb into a first-place 
tic in the conference race. 
"The reason we're successful at 
this point is we've had two games at 
home," said Iowa Coach Lute Olson. 
"We play four ofour ne_xt five games 
on the road." 
Iowa goes to Minnesota on . tonight in a battle of preseason 
favorites and then to Wisconsin 
Saturday while Ohio State journeys 
to Illinois on Thursday and con­
tinues on to Indiana Saturday. 
"We're not going to Minnesota 
fearful ofplaying in Williams Arena," 
said Olson. "We don't have a kid on 
this squad that has lost in Williams 
Arena" 
Iowa has won all three ofits games at Minnesota in the last three seasons but Olson doesn't want to put that much importance on tonight's game. 
"It's important, but if you don't 
look at the season as 18 games, you 
can get into trouble," he said. "Ifyou 
don't get too depressed by your 
losses or too elated by your wins and 
you give a good effort in each game, 
when the 18 games arc over you'll 
be on top." 
Ohio State Coach Eldon Miller wondered about his team being the early season surprise. 
"I don't know," said Miller. "All we're trying to do is have a little fun. What's surprising to a lot of people and to me is that our young back­court players are not looking like their age too much." 
Freshmen guards Troy Taylor and Ron Stokes have fit into the Buckeye pattern beautifully and at times Mil­ler has teamed them with Larry Hug­gins in employing a three-guard offense to go along with junior Clark Kellogg up front. 
"Kellogg is improving and he's better than a year ago," said Miller. 
"He rebounds well and he has made strides in other phases of the game. I wouldn't trade him for any other front line player."

Second half dominance 
Irish defeat St. Francis, 61-5 7 
By MARK HANNUKSELA 
Sports Writer 
JOLIET, Ill. -Mary DiStanislao 
must have had a lot to say to her 
women's basketball team at halftime 
of last night's game against the Col­
lege ofSt. Francis here. · 
The Irish coach kept her team in 

the lockerroom for more than 16 
and one-half minutes of the 20­. minute period. The team that finally emerged was different from the one that ended the first half eight points behind. 
Notre Dame limited St. Francis to 

just 23 second-half points and put 
together a pair of offensive spurls 
that carried them to a 61-57 win. 
It was the second of those two spurts that gave the Irish control of the game. Down 50-42 with just over eight minutes left, the Irish went on a 19-7 tear and finally took the lead on Mary Beth Schueth's double-clutch jumperwith 3:10 left. 
Almost two minutes later, Schueth scored again, this time from just right of the lane, after taking a pretty lob feed from junior guard Debbi Hensley. St Francis was able to close the gap to one, 58-57, with 0:59left, but a free throw by Schueth and two more by freshman Carrie Bates iced Notre Dame's fourth straight win and eigth ofthe season. 
The Irish, losers of only three, were led by Schueth in both the scoring and rebounding depart­ments. The Indianapolis native scored 11 second-half points, and finished with 17. She pulled down 10 rebounds, including three very big ones in the last three minutes. 
Despite the win, DiStanislao was not pleased with her team's overall performance. 
"I'm happy we had enough for­titude to pull it out down the stretch," she said, "but, other than that, I'm not happy at all. I wasn't happy with our post defense. We let them flash and post up and take it right to us."

And that's exactly what St. Francis did in the first half -take it right to Notre Dame, using an effective transition game and full-coun pressure. The Lady Saints built a lead that reached ten points with less than two minutes left in the half. 
'"We were flat out-hustled in the first half," DiStanislao saiq. "With the exception of Butler (which scored 67 in a nine-point win over the Irish), that's the most points we've give!l up. We were guilty ofa lack of aggressiveness that caused us to do some really dumb things. 
"St. Francis deserved to win ­they played very well," she said. "We were able to win the game because

lights of Notre Dame's successful women's basketball campaign during semester vacation. 
"We played well over the Christmas holiday," said Irish Coach Mary DiStanislao. "Our freshmen hav¢.really adjusted well to college basketball. At times, we made some mistakes due to our inexperience, but for the most part, I've been pleased with our play." 
The Irish, who are now 8-3, began their road swing in Philadelphia at the Penn Tournament. In the opening round, freshmen Mary Beth Schueth and Carrie Bates led the way to a 62-47 victory over host Pennsylvania. Playing in Philadel­phia's Palestra, regarded as one of the most difficult sites in the nation for visiting tea~s. the Irish turned a slim three-point halftime lead into a big win. Schueth scored 17 points, while Bates scored 14. 
In the championship game of the Penn Tournament, Mount St. Mary's outscored Notre Dame by I 7 points in the second half en route to a 57­44 victory. Freshmen again led the Irish in scoring. Schueth, Bates, and Ruth Kaiser tallied I 0 points each. Schueth and Bates were selected to the all-tournament team. 
The Irish then travelled to Kansas City for a clash with the Tigers, who defeated UCLA earlier in the season. The Irish, who trailed by three points at halftime, outscored the Tigers by 10 in the second halffor a 60-53 victory. Irish assistant Coach Pat Knapp called the victory "our biggest win in two years. The girls really played well." 
Missouri led by as many as five points in the second half, but Notre Dame kept it close with aggressive play. A layup by junior forward Shari Matvey with 9:45 left to play gave the Irish the lead for good. Matvey scored 11 points, while the fresh­man trio of Bates, Schueth and Kaiser scored 12 each. Schueth grabbed 13 rebounds as the Irish out-rebounded the Tigers, 42-35.

Irish look good but lose to USF 
By SKIP DESJARDIN 
Sports Editor 
OAKLAND, Calif. -Rumor had it that a sign had been hung over the -.door to the Oakland-Alameda 
County Coliseum. "Abandon hope all ye who enter here," it supposedly said. 
After all, Notre Dame had never won here. Moreover. the 2-8 Irish were going up against the nation's No. 7team. 
Apparently, however, Tim Andree and the Irish came in the back entrance Tuesday night and missed the sign. They played by far their best game of the season, and nearly beat the San Francisco Dons. 
"We grew up tonight," said Digger Phelps after the 57-55 loss. "We have to play with the best teams in the country for 40 minutes. Now we know we can. 
The Irish played better than they 
had all season, and Andree led the charge. 
He scored 14 points, pulled down seven rebounds, blocked two shots and stymied the Dons' seven-foot center, Wallace Bryant. 
"Tim played the best he has all year," said Phelps "The whole team did just what they had to do to win." 
In the end, it was Notre Dame's old nemesis, foul shooting, that did the team in. John Paxson missed the front end of a one-and-one with the score tied at 53 and just 48 seconds left on the clock. The Dons came up with the rebound, worked for a good shot, and got it. 
Bryant's five-footer was followed 
by a Ken McAlister steal, and 
Bryant's two foul shots put the game 
out of reach. 
"I wouldn't change anything 
about the end of the game," Phelps 
said. "John is the man we want at the 
line in that situation. It doesn't 
bother me that he missed. He did 

ND may lose Sluby to the school books 
Notre Dame Assistant Sports Information Director John Heis­ler yesterday refused to com­ment on reports that Irish sophomore forward Tom Sluby had been declared academically ineligible and would not be per­mitted to play for the remainder ofthe 1981-82 basketball season. But other University officials have indicated that the reports indeed are accurate. 
The reports first surfaced on the Metrosports telecast of the Notre Dame-San Francisco game on Tuesday night, and were reiterated on several television news programs last night. 
Heisler did say that, if an an­nouncement on the subject is forthcoming, it would come either today or tomorrow, but he refused to elaborate. 
Ifthe reports are accurate, that would leave Digger Phelps with only seven healthy scholarship players on the squad: Mike Mitchell, John Paxson, Bill Var­ner, Tim Andree, Barry Spencer, Cecil Rucker and Ron Rowan. Freshman guard Dan Duff suf­fered an ankle injury against Vir­ginia, and is out of the lineup indefinitely. 
The team returned to South Bend late last night from the West Coast, and Sluby and the coaching staff were unavailable for comment.

Backhus, Meyers fired; _Faust makes changes 
By KELLY SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
lit As expected, Notre Dame Head Coach Gerry· Faust made several changes in his staff over the holidays, including the firing of two coaches. 
Offensive line coach Tom Back­bus and defensive line coach Bill Meyers were informed several days after Christmas that they would not be retained as Notre Dame assis­tants. 
Backhus, who admitted to being "deeply disappointed" by the deci­sion, was Faust's first high school All­American as ·a player at Moeller. Responsible for the tackles and ends last fall, he was offensive coor­dinator at Air Force in 1980 before coming to Notre Dame. 
Backhus expressed the desire to remain in coaching if possible. 
 Meyers, who was unavailable for comment, had completed three seasons as an assistant at Notre Dame. A standout lineman on the Stanford University Rose Bowl teams, Meyers worked with the of­fensive line for two years under Dan Devine before Faust moved him over to the defense. He primarily coached the tackles. In addition, Faust announced that quarterback-receiver coach Tom Lichtenberg, running back coach Greg Blache and line ooachjim Hig­gins would assume new duties on his staff. 
Lichtenberg, who also serves as 
offensive coordinator for the Irish, will now become the backfield coach. Faust said he wished to retain Lichtenberg as-his coordinator on offense, but felt it was in the team's best interests to relieve him of the tremendous responsibilites of coaching the quarterbacks. He has already named a replacement for that position. 
Ron Hudson, a former backfield coach at UCLA, will work with the quarterbacks and receivers begin­ning this spring. Hudson coached at Oregon and Stanford, under San Francisco 49er coach Bill Walsh, before his stint with Terry Donohue and the UCLA Bruins. Faust said that the addition of Hudson, 36, "comes to us highly recommended by a number of head coaches, including Bill Walsh. It also enables us to give more individual attention to each phase of the offense." 

In talking with other head coaches, Faust said it became ap­parent that giving one man the chores of being both offensive coor­dinator and quarterback coach, as he had done with Lichtenberg, was too much ofa burden. With the changes, Faust hopes each will have more time to devote to the two positions. 
Blache, who coached the Irish backfield this season, will take Meyers' job on the defensive line. A former defensive back for Notre Dame in 1967, Blache was defensive 
See FAUST, page 8 
what he had to do for us all night." 
Paxson's biggest contribution came on defense. He held Quintin Dailey to just 13 points, less than half his average. 
The Irish used a sagging zone defense to trap Dailey whenever he got the ball. In addition, Andree, Tom Sluby and Bill Varner combined to force Bryant to shoot from outside the foul lane. 
The Irish took a lesson from last Saturday's nationally-televised game between the Dons and South Carolina. They saw the Gamecocks outhustle their opponents, and saw 
how effective  double·  and  triple­ 
team  defenses  could  be  against  
Dailey.  

"South Carolina taught us how to beat these guys," commented for­ward Gary Grassey. 
Phelps, despite the loss, was hap­pier than he's been in any post-game press conference all t year. 
"These guys really proved a lot to me tonight," he said. "We stayed with one of the best teams in the country for 40 minutes. A struggling team needs that. 
"We played with composure. These guys never lost their cool. Psychologically, this game was as good as a win for us." 
Now the Irish return home. They'll look at the lessons they learned on the road, and try to apply those lessons to the 16 games still to come. 
"Hey," saad Phelps, "we've still got a shot at the NIT."

Glad to be home 

Road life disagrees with cagers 
By SKIP DESJARDIN 
Sports Edttor 
In· years past, they were man­
datory stops on the vaudeville cir­
cuit. 
Kansas City. Washington. A show 
every couple ofnights. Philadelphia 
Louisville. A few pratfalls and lots of 
laughs. 
Unfortunately, vaudeville is dead. 
Over Christmas break, while most students were at home shovelling snow and eating Mom's lasagna, the Notre Dame basketball team went on a cross-country tour. 
In city after city, from coast to coast, the show went on. Every night the act was a little different but the outcome never changed. 
Against Kentucky, Digger Phelps had a surprise. He devised a stall that held the Wildcats at bay for a full 40 minutes. 
Joe B. Hall was content to sit back in a zone defense and let the clock tick away. It was almost a fatal mistake. Officials missed an obvious double dribble by Dirk Minniefield, allowing Kentucky to take the game into overtime and eventually win, 34-28. 
John Paxson ran the delay game and scored almost half of Notre Dame's points. 
But the Irish lost. 
Against Missouri, they came up with 70 points, enough to have won or tied five of their nine losses this season. 

Again, Paxson was the driving force. He scored 21 points, while holding Jon Sunvold, Missouri's star guard, to just six. He also dished out a game-high six assists. 
But the Tigers hit 72 percent of their field goal attempts and 92 per­cent of their foul shots, setting school records in a 92-70 win. 
And the Irish lost. 

Back east, in Philadelphia, there was a new star. Paxson had an off night, scoring just five points. So Bar­ry Spencer, who had not played in the two previous games, came up with the best game of his career. Tom Sluby also played his best game for Notre Dame the same night, as the two sophomores scored 18 and 13 points respectively. 
But Notre Dame couldn't buy a free throw, hitting less than 44 per­cent from the line. Starters Paxson, Tim Andree and Mike Mitchell came up with just nine points between them. On the way to a 66-61 victory, LaSalle's freshman sensation, Steve Black, picked up 20 points on 8-for­13 shooting. 
And the Irish lost. 

The Virginia Cavaliers had been the No. I team in the country and were riding a 28-game winning streak when Notre Dame upset them last year in Chicago. They were looking for revenge, and they got it. 
Ralph Sampson and company overwhelmed the Irish. Every Vir­ginia player on the roster scored at least two points, and four players scored in double figures as Virginia coasted to an 87-54 win.

Devine lands job as booster club prez 
Former Notre Dame Head Coach Dan Devine, who resigned after the 1980 season, finally has found a new job. 
After dabbling in various pur­suits for the past year, and also being rumored for several vacant head coaching positions, Devine yesterday accepted the, presidency of the Arizona State University "Sun Angels," a boos­ter group that is unaffiliated with the university..ASU officials made the announcement at a press con­ference yesterday. 
Devine, 57, has kept himself busy, most recently as an adviser for the new domed stadium in Minneapolis, but he has all but divorced himself from the Notre Dame football program although he has kept in touch with many of his former players. In recent weeks, Devine has been rumored for several head coaching posi­
tions, including the NFL's New 
England Patriots and also a 
Canadian Football League job. 
He also remains the most men­tioned candidate for the coach and general manager positions for a possible NFL franchise in In­dianapolis, if and when the op­portunity arises. 


In accepting the ASU position, Devine returns to the school where he began his illustrious collegiate coaching career in 1955. He coached at ASU for three years and compiled a 27-3­1 record before moving on to head coaching jobs at Missouri, the Green Bay Packers, and final­ly Notre Dame.
