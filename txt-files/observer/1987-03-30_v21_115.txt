Man continues to build cubes while striving for classy look 
After learning of the details of the proposed renovations on the North Dining Hall, I had one reaction, even if it is naive and absurdly roman­tic: go further. Much further. 
It appears the "classy" look is back. The neatly utilitarian North Dining Hall will prob­ably soon look more like the South Dining Hall, all in the name of harmonizing it with the more "traditional" architecture on campus. 
But really how "classy" is the architecture of the South Dining Hall? As far as I am con­cerned, none of the proposals are classy or traditional enough. 
Perhaps because we live in a country barely 200 years old, we have come to accept cramped historical horizons. That we now regard build­ings less than a century old as somehow old, traditional or classical says something in itself. 
By no means am I am suggesting that we abandon innovation in architecture. Whatever we do, however, one thing is clear: the struc­tures of this century which we call examples of architecture have simply got to cease being the rule. 
For starters, let's look at the most obvious target for denunciation: big cities. 
The beginning and end of every break is for me an incredibly depressing experience. This is because to reach my home or to return to Notre Dame I have to pass through Chicago. If there is an argument for a nuclear war, down­town Chicago is it. 
Driving through Chicago is not like entering the flower of civilization. Rather it is like get­ting lost in the Valley of the Dinosaurs. Stark, grimy concrete and glass high-rises and other modernistic monoliths hem you in from every side like canyon walls of some barren prehis­toric epoch. 
All one finds these days is monotony and gray­ness. Mies van der Robe's adage that "Less is more" continues to reign despotically in modern architectural thinking. The saying may indeed be true enough, but if it is, then in my opinion the skyscrapers in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and so on are simply too much. 
Consider it this way: civilized man has been around for at least ten thousand years, can hold conversations over distances of thousands of miles and has even managed to land a man on the moon. Yet in all of this, with regard to shel­ter in our big cities he has found himself capable only of endlessly producing immense cubes. 
No better are the Fisher Price sets, like the Huddle, which most people have accustomed themselves to dine in these days. When I was in Europe, it seemed the only thought which 

Chris Julka 
Assistant News Editor 
l...frutA ST"ANTON '87 
crossed the mind of a hungry American was to find a McDonald's. At least as far as I am con­cerned, however, eating at one of the burger chains is like eating in a hospital or a psycho ward. Every one of these palaces of plastic are perfectly antiseptic and perfectly efficient in their operation, but that's all you can say. 
Of course, architects tell us incessantly that they are bucking this trend. Despite this, however, all they seem to come up with are edifices that look invariably like extrater­restrial egg cartons of the kind typically found in low-budget science fiction movies, without a trace of down-to-earth human warmth about them. 
Contrast this to what you can still find in Europe. In the old days, people were not· satisfied with blank walls. They doodled like crazy, carving crosses, swirls and flowers into doors, pillars, window sills, and anything they could find. No wonder one finds so much graffiti in this age. It is only natural to relieve empti­ness with some human details. By comparison to what there once was, most of our houses and restaurants and a lot of our churches and uni­versities are barren prisons. 
I suppose, though, we are too practical these days and therefore, know that building anything other than cubes or plastic burger joints is simply a waste of time. But I still have at least one request: let's not build another Huddle.

He added, "Ideally this will be in force by this year's spring finals--at least on a trial basis.''

British party accuses White House of distorting talks to help Thatcher 

Associated Press 
LONDON -The opposition Labor Party on Sunday ac­cused the White House of dis­torting its talks with President Reagan to help Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's re­election chances. 
Labor deputy leader Denis Healey, a former foreign sec­retary, also said Reagan was badly briefed and muddled during Friday's meeting at the White House. He said Reagan was incapable of responding to some questions and that he mistook Healey for the British ambassador. 
"What does seem to be the case is that some of President

"This year, things had deteriorated to a point where we would rather (eliminate some team names) than do away with the whole tourna­ment," Rocca said. 
"There had been some concern (Hesburgh) would have reacted." 
Reagan's advisers thought it would be a good idea to try and help Thatcher in her election battle by being unkind to the Labor Party,'' Healey said in a TV interview. 
Thatcher is widely expected to call an election this summer or autumn, ahead of the June 1988 deadline. 
Healey attacked as his socialist party, sliding in opinion polls, took a new ham­mering in the British press, which for the most part sup­ports Thatcher's Conservative Party. ·

This was a factor in the deci­sion to approach Wenc, Rocca said. 
In addition, there has been "a general concern (in the Ad­ministration) over the last couple of years" about the names of the teams, he said. 
Although Tyson said he has not seen the names of this year's teams, he said some names he has seen in the past were "strong with reverse

Healey, who accompanied Labor leader Neil Kinnock to the meeting with Reagan, told reporters in London: "He (Reagan) did not understand this area (Labor's defense policy). He was not capable of making a response. He just nodded his head." 
Healey said Reagan also greeted him with the words, "Nice to see you again, Mr. Ambassador,'' while British ambassador Sir Antony Acland stood by. 
room was caused by smoke rather than fire, said Smith. 
The damage was extensive, according to Gamino. He said most of the furniture was still usable, although the couch, bedcovers, and ceiling tiles were badly smoke-damaged and the carpet was water­damaged. 
Smith said the room's resi­dents are staying with friends in the dorm until the cleanup of the room is completed. 
Some also contained harrass­ment of individuals, he added. 
If the name changes had not .been made, Tyson said his of­fice may have cancelled the tournament. "I'm not going to tolerate harrassment," he said. "The issue is basketball, not names."

Prosecutor clarifies Pre-trial Diversion Program 

I read Chris Murphy's Feb. 26 inside column and believe several things need to be said in order that the Notre Dame community fully understands both the consequences of alleged violations of the Indiana criminal law and the man­ner in which the Office of the St. Joseph County Prosecuting Attorney attempts to deal with first-time misdemeanor of­fenders.

It is a fact that a person who is under 21 years of age and who is on the premises of a tavern commits a cri­minal offense, that being minor in a tavern, I.C.7-15-7-10, which is a Class C misdemeanor offense. The maximum penalties for a Class C Misdemeanor are a fine of $500 and a 60 day jail term. 
It has always been an office policy that when it is appropriate and possible, area police agencies and the State Ex­cise Police have been instructed to simply "ticket" those who may be guilty of this type offense so that the alleged defendants can be spared the formal ar­rest process -which would include photographs being taken of the defen­dants and a formal fingerprinting at the 
Schedule distribution delayed due to names 
Dear Editor: 
As Commissioner of Bookstore Bas­ketball XVI, I would like to offer an apology to all of the team captains who conscientiously attended the Bookstore Captain's Meeting on Wednesday, March 25th. The schedules for the Tournament were completed and ready for distribution that night, but distribu­tion was delayed by the action of the Student Activities Office, due to their objections to the publication of certain names contained in the schedule. This decision was out of my hands and there were no measures which I could take to make distribution possible on the night of the Captain's Meeting. I did County jail, and the posting of bond to be released from the jail. We think that is a wise policy, and thus ''tickets'' have become the norm in St. Joseph County to address the conduct ·Mr. Murphy speaks of in his editorial. 
What information that officers com­municate at the scene is always a sub­ject of debate, but there can be no mis­take that the crimes alleged against Mr. Murphy and others who were arrested at Lee's Barbeque are, in fact, Class C Misdemeanors. 
Our Pre-trial Diversion Program of­fers first time misdemeanor offenders the opportunity to do community­service work, and given the specific cir­cumstances of a particular case, enter into any other sort of condition, in order that the person charged not take the risk of having a formal criminal con­viction on his or her record if that person either pleads guilty or is found guilty of having committed an offense. If one has no concern with regard to a criminal conviction being entered into a per­manent criminal history, then the Pre­trial Diversion Program has little, if any inducement. 
No one is forced to opt for the pro­gram. One who is charged with a cri­minal offense has several alternatives to pursue. They include pleading guilty to the offense, or pleading not guilty and having the Court of jury determine whe­ther or not there is sufficient evidence to find that person guilty of the offense charged. 
The raids on Lee's and subsequent raids on some homes around the Notre Dame area resulted in the ticketing of many who were under the age of 21 years. Some of these offenses alleged being a minor in a tavern, a minor in possession of alcohol, a minor consum­ing alcohol, or other offenses. All who were so cited may explore every altern­ative available to them under the law. 
In Mr. Murphy's specific case, he was notified that our Pre-Trial Diversion Program was such an alternative. He chose to avail himself of that option. He signed an agreement with this Office which outlined his responsibilities and obligations. 
A complete explanation of that agree­ment was given, and we presume that a Notre Dame student can read and comprehend a document which is pur­posely geared to be read and under­stood by one with an elementary school education. 
The Pre-Trial Diversion Program was not formulated specifically for Notre Dame students. It is a program available to all in our community who qualify and choose to participate. Notre Dame students comprise about 15 per 
not give the specific reason for the schedules not being available at the meeting because I did not want to make the problem public issue while I was in the process of negotiating with Student Activities. My primary concern was to insure that the tournament could and will still run despite the difficulties. 
I am also forced to extend apologies to the members of the teams who have had their team names deleted or al­tered. There was no time in which to contact you for an alternate name. The names were altered in order to make the final copy of the schedule accep­table to all concerned. Failure to alter the schedule could have resulted, at 
worst,  in  the  possible  end  of  the  
Bookstore  Basketball  tournament.  
Therefore,  names  were  reconsidered  

by a student committee, ultimately working in agreement with the Office of Student Activities. A large number 
of names have been replaced by team numbers. Those teams will be notified of the changes made. If you have a question over the fate of your team name or your place in the final schedule, please contact a member of the Bookstore staff. The only other al­ternative given to us was to use num­bers and the names of the team cap­tains to identify all of the teams. This route was taken with the schedule a number of years ago and we felt it was better to preserve the majority of the team names than to sacrifice them all. 
My staff and I have done our best to insure that the schedules will be ready for distribution on Monday, March 30th in the SAB office in LaFortune between 3 and 6 pm. Regardless, the tournament will begin on March 31st with the annual Hall of Fame game and the first 30 games of the 1st round. 
My thanks to all of the team captains 

cent of the total persons who have en­
rolled in this specific program. 
No one can answer as to how a future 
employer may react to a misdemeanor 
conviction. We believe that the choice 
to enroll in the Program is one which 
should be offered and that choice should 
be made by an individual after carefully 
exploring all of the legal options avail­
able. 

Mr. Murphy also questions whether or not there are records kept of such convictions. These records are kept, they are reported to the Indiana State Police to be made part of the permanent criminal history of an individual, and that information is available to those authorized to seek and secure such in­formation. 
We are proud of our Pre-Trial Diver­sion Program and consider it one which is both beneficial to our community and to the individuals who enroll in it. It makes sense to us, and we do not have an interest in whether one enrolls in the Program or not. We simply are proud that such an alternative exists for those who wish to take advantage of it. 
I suspect that the problem with Mr. Murphy is that he. did not like the answers to his questions -not that his questions were not answered.

Tyson for taking the time to listen to my position and for offering their aid to assure that the schedule could be published with team names.

REO rocks the ACC 
Georgia . 
Satellites open 
TOM BEATIY features copy editor 

REO Speedwagon pulled Into the ACC Saturday evening, with special guests the Georgia Satel­lites, and the 6,000 plus scream­ing fans were treated to a night of solid rock 'n' roll. 
The Georgia Satellites opened the evening with two sets of southern-fried rock that had spe­cial appeal for the flannel shirt and chewing tobacco c;:rowd. They had plenty ofaudience par­ticipation on a few numbers, es­pecially when the crowd thun­dered, "Don't give me no lines, and keep your hands to your­self." The gentlemen from Geor­gia delivered well-written tunes with a freight train rhythm, and had the crowd fired up for the main act. 
After a lengthy intermission, REO Speedwagon emerged from the depths of their imaginative set, with dry Ice fog surrounding the band as they took the stage. They immediately broke Into "That Ain't Love," a catchy release from their ne\\t album, and followed with a set of ma­terial that was a mix of the old and new REO, with vintage tunes like "Take It on the Run" and "Time For Me to Fly," blended with recent releases, like "One Too Many Girlfriends." 
Lead singer ahd rhythm guitar player Kevin Cronin was in prime form, belting out melodies and hitting the high notes without a break. Lead guitarist Gary Richrath had several screaming guitar runs, and It appears he has truly sweetened with age. Keyboardist Neal Doughty has streamlined his act in the past few years, and now sticks to a single synthesizer. As in years past, he provided a clean back­ground sound, with a few inter­esting solos.

But just when it looked as if the Irish were about to cure their acute case of "Hoosieritis" that had saddled them with four losses this year, the game was called because of darkness.

''The only significance at this point for me is what it means to our players," Knight said "I wanted it badly for the kids to have_the opportunity.'' 
''I tend to think of things in terms of our program, and not things where I am concerned," Boeheim said. 
For the record, the od­dsmakers say Knight will be the winner, that his third­ranked Hoosiers are 3-point favorites for the Superdome contest which gets under way at 8:12p.m. EST. 
While the two teams have never met before, they are not all that different. Both have balanced scoring and both are highly selective about using the 3-point shot. Indiana made two of four Saturday, while Syracuse hit three of eight. 
Both shared their conference championships, 29-4 Indiana with Purdue in the Big Ten and 31-6 Syracuse with Georgetown and Pitt in the Big East. 
The lOth-ranked Orangemen must first and foremost stop Steve Alford, a two-time All­American guard and the leading scorer in Indiana his­tory. But he won't be the only focus for Boeheim's defense. 
"With Indiana," Boeheim said Sunday, "I don't think there is anyone you can leave open at any time. Alford's a great shooter and he can do a lot of things to hurt you.
Center Dean Garrett has added strength to In­

mine. It has been financially and physically a very exhaust­ing year.'' 
The younger Alford, averag­ing 22 points this season for the 29-4 Hoosiers with a career total of 2,415 points, said his biggest disappointment in bas­ketball was not taking his fa­ther's team into the Final Four of the Indiana high school tournament as a senior. New Castle lost to eventual state champion Connersville in the title game of their semistate despite a 37-point performance by Alford. 
Alford had a record 94 points for the two semistate games, including 57 in the semifinals. 
The elder Alford proudly rattles off the accomplish­ments of his son, who needs 25 points against Syracuse to be­come the Big Ten Conference's career-scoring leader. 
"Steve has made it to the 

NCAA fin~, b~ I koow won't be satisfied unless he gets that championship," his father said. "But, he's had a remarkable career so far and

it's nice. He was named In­diana's Mr. Basketball, played on the winning team in the 1983 National Sports Festival, won an Olympic gold medal, a Big Ten championship and became the career-scoring leader at In­diana, a school with one of the best basketball traditions in the country.'' 
As a coach, the elder Alford respects the way Knight con­ducts his program and says his son never has complained about his treatment by the tem­peramental Indiana coach. 
"Knight is tough. He's a dis­ciplinarian, but he's up front right from the start," Alford said. "When he recruited Steve, he warned, 'I'm going to work you the hardest you ever have.' He knew the skills that Steve had, but he also knew there was work ahead." 
The Indiana senior guard is expected to be a first-round pick in this year's NBA draft and his father plans on being his son's agent. 
''I never expected him to a game and can do it again." reach the level he's achieved," 
the elder Alford said. 
He also anticipates that Al­ford may surprise a few people in the NBA.

He was talking about the Hoosiers' front line of 6-foot-10 Dean Garrett, 6-7 Daryl Thomas and 6-6 Rick Calloway and point guard Keith Smart. 
Garrett averages 11.4 points and 8.4 rebounds and has 90 blocks. Thomas averages 15.6 points and 5.7 rebounds. Cal­loway is good for 13 points a game and Smart 10.9. 
Syracuse also presents a multi-faceted offense with 6-10 Rony Seikaly, 6-9 Derrick Cole­man, 6-6 Howard Triche and guards Sherman Douglas and Greg Monroe. 
Like Indiana, Syracuse has five starters averaging in double figures: douglas at 17.3, Seikaly at 15.0, Monroe 12.9, Coleman 12.0 and Triche at 
11.9. Seikaly also averages 8.3 rebounds and has 75 blocks. 
"It's a team that will be dif­ficult to play against," said Knight, who previously won na­tional titles in 1976 and 1981. 
Alford, who scored 33 points in Indiana's 97-93 semifinal vic­tory over top-ranked Nevada­Las Vegas Saturday, is averag­ing 22 points and has 2,415 in his career. 
Boeheim, whose team beat Providence 77-63 in the other semifinal, said he watched In­diana's semifinal win and the tape of it. 
"When Alford played the way he did yesterday, I don't know if they are heatable," he said. "The games they've played well, they just seem to beat anybody." 
Douglas, a sophomore point guard, said Syracuse doesn't expect to stop Alford and just hopes to contain him.

Crowds celebrate in Bloomington without severe problems 
Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. Police reported few problems resulting from the celebration after Indiana's victory in the NCAA national basketball semifinal, but were bracing for large downtown crowds in the event of a championship vic­tory Monday night. 
"All and all it was pretty quiet,'' Bloomington police Lt. Stan Easton said of the tumult that followed Indiana's 97-93 victory over Nevada-Las Vegas in New Orleans Satur­day night. 
Crowds gathered at Showal­ter Fountain at the heart of IU, and at the corner of Dunn Street and Kirkwood Avenue, a block west of the campus. The few cars attempting to drive through the intersection were poundedJ rocked and used as

rests apparently related to the post-game exuberence. Four people were arrested on drunken driving charges, two for public drunkeness, five for disorderly conduct and one each for interfering with a police officer and criminal recklessness. 
Police at the university and from the city department said there were assorted minor in­juries from people falling off vehicles, but no reports of major accidents or crimes. 
"You don't want anything to happen," Easton said. "But with that many people, you know it's going to. We didn't do too bad last night and, knock on wood, hopefully it'll be the same when we win Monday.'' 
For the championship the Hoosiers will battle Syracuse, which defeated Providence 77­63 Saturday. 
One person was arrested at IU for public intoxication and two for drunken driving, said Lt. Robert Schutte of the campus police department.

Tenn. routs La. Tech for first NCAA title 
Associated Press 
AUSTIN, Texas -Sheila Frost came off the bench to score 13 points Sunday, igniting the Tennessee Lady Volunteers to their first NCAA women's bas­ketball championship with a 67­44 rout of favored Louisiana Tech. 
It was the first time Tennes­see Coach Pat Head Summitt had earned the national title al­though she's had eight teams in the Final Four. 
The victory came easier than expected over the Lady Techsters, 30-3, who had beaten the Lady Vols, 28-6, nine straight times, including a 72­60 triumph in February. 
It was sweet revenge for the Lady Vols, who had been defeated three times in the Final Four by Louisiana Tech. Tennessee is 2-11 against Tech. 
Tonya Edwards and Bridgette Gordon also had 13 points apiece for the Lady Vols. 
Tough rebounding and a tenacious, overplaying defense that denied the passing lanes victory Saturday over the Providence Friars in the na­tional basketball semifinals. Syracuse will play in its first national championship game ever Monday night, against In­diana University. 
won the game for the Southeas­ 
tern Conference champions.  
Tennessee held high-scoring Tori Harrison to eight points and All-American Teresa Weatherspoon had only 11  I I I ·I I  
points. Nora Lewis was high for  
the losers with 12.  
Tennessee took advantage of  
a  seven-minute cold spell by  
the Lady Techsters to run off  
a 13-5 spurt and a 33-24 halftime  
lead.  
Paulette Stall tied the score  
at 19 with a basket at 7: 11, but  
the  Lady  Techsters  couldn't  
score again until Lewis hit  a  
shot with 11 seconds left in the  
half.  
The Lady Vols steadily built  
the lead in the second half as  
Gordon scored seven points.  
The  victory snapped  a  19­ 
game Louisiana Tech winning  
streak, longest in the nation.  
All 15,615 tickets  were sold  
for  the  championship  game,  
but attendance was only 9,823.  
There  were  numerous  empty  
seats  because  Texas  was  
eliminated on Friday night by  
Louisiana Tech.  

"This is for the city," said fan Mike Read, who led chants at Mrs. O'Leary's bar on Bur­net Avenue. "This isn't just the university. This is the thing that brought everybody to­gether.'' 
At the university's commer­cial hub on Marshall Street, a plate glass window was shat­tered at the Varsity Restau­rant. Street signs were torn out of the concrete and two people were hurt when a mob destroyed a bus shelter. 
Mounted police, armed with bullhorns, urged fans to restore order, even coercing some to climb down from telephone poles. 
Still, there were no arrests, said Syracuse police officer Mi­chael DeFio. 
"It was just a lot of celebrat­ing," DeFio said. 
The Syracuse Herald-Journal published its first extra edition in almost a quarter-century, sending hawkers to University Hill and other locations to tell the story of the win.

Nettles shows Braves that 42 is not too old 
Associated Press 
Graig Nettles says he came to the Atlanta Braves' spring camp hoping to win a job and impress some people. It's still not official that he's on the roster but has impressed a few people. 
Nettles hit three homers and a double Sunday as the Braves beat the Baltimore Orioles 12-1 at West Palm Beach. 
Nettles, 42, hit a solo homer off Scott McGregor in the second inning and a two-run homer in the sixth after drawing a walk on his second at-bat. In the eighth, Ted Sim­
~ . mons and Nettles greeted reliever Don Aase with back­to-hack homers. Nettles, who has been playing first and third, also doubled later in the inning. "I've never been much of a spring player and I've always been a streaky home run hit­ter," said Nettles who has six homers and another in a B game this spring. 
Indians 10, Cubs 6 
In Tucson, Rick Dempsey doubled and singled, driving in two runs and scoring twice, and Tony Bernazard, Julio Franco and Pat Tabler each drove in two runs as Cleveland defeated Chicago. Cleveland starter Greg Swindell got the win, al­lowing five runs, four of them earned, on five hits in seven in­nings. He struck out nine and retired 14 of the final 15 batters he faced. 
Brewers 3, Giants 2 

In Chandler, Robin Yount doubled in the go-ahead run in a two-run sixth inning as Mil­waukee defeated San Fran­cisco to snap a five-game ex­hibition losing streak. Rick Manning began the sixth with a pop-fly double off Giant loser Kelly Downs as shortstop Jose Uribe lost the wind-blown ball in the sun behind third base. Yount followed with a hard hop double to right center, scoring Manning. Yount moved to third on a passed ball and scored on Jim Paciorek's hard smash to third. 
Dodgers 6, Expos 3 
In Vero Beach, rookie out­fielder Chris Gwynn's two-run single highlighted a three-run eighth inning that carried Los Angeles over Montreal. The eighth-inning rally against Montreal right-hander Tim Burke broke a 3-3 tie. Los An­geles reliever Tom Niedenfuer recored his second straight save of the spring. Fernando Valenzuela went eight innings for the Dodgers in his longest spring outing, allowing three runs on seven hits, while is­suing four walks and striking out six. 
Mariners 6, A's 5 
In Tempe, Harold Reynolds drove in the go-ahead run with a suicide squeeze bunt and hit a two-run, inside-the-park home as Seattle nipped Oak­land. Reynolds' perfectly placed bunt scored Dave Valle to cap a three-run second in­ning that erased a 2-0 Oakland lead. His homer off loser Chris Codiroli made it 6-2 in the fourth inning.

ND takes 6 firsts 
Kraus, O'Rourke power Irish 
By MOLLY MAHONEY Sports Writer 
The score may not have been kept at Saturday's Notre Dame Invitational, but if it had been the Irish would not have minded. 
The Notre Dame track team collected six first place finishes out of a possible 19, led by strong performances from freshmen Tom Kraus and Tom O'Rourke. 
Once again Kraus dominated the field of shot putters, with his first-place toss setting a meet record and qualifying him for the IC4A champion­ships. Kraus also won the dis­cus competition. 


Running in his first steeplec­hase for the Irish, O'Rourke outran his competition to take first place as well with a time of 9:30.7. 
"Both did very well," said Irish head coach Joe Piane, "I was impressed by their perfor­mances." 
Junior Mike Burns placed second in the steeplechase for the Irish with a time of 9:37.4. 
Juniors Brian Driscoll and Tom Mick won the javelin and hammer competitions with throws of 189-8 and 150-2, respectively, to complete a sold

Irish performance in the field events. Chuck Curley added a second-place finish with a throw of 185-10. 
Sophomore David Warth, taking advantage of the oppor­tunity to experiment in the non­scoring invitational, won the 400-meter intermediate hurdles. Freshman Glenn Wat­son finished fourth. 
"Non-scoring meets let the guys experiment in different events," said Piane, "and give guys opportunities to compete who might not normally get the chance. They also give those with injuries the chance to rest." 
The Irish now prepare to take on the Hoosiers in Bloomington next weekend.

4,500 to participate in International Games 

Observer Staff Report 
Thousands of people will descend upon the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's community this summer for the Seventh International Summer Special Olympics Games. Over 4,500 athletes, along with coaches, families, and friends will be attending the nine-day event. 
The International Games, scheduled every four years, are the showcase of the Special Olympics effort, a program of athletic training and competition in­volving over one million mentally hand­icapped athletes every year. The Games were started by Eunice Ken­nedy Shriver and the J·oseph P. Ken­nedy Jr. Foundation in 1968 as a way to test the skills, and provide encourage­ment for, the mentally handicapped. 
The Games are being organized by the International · Summer Special Olympics Committee (ISSOC), a non­

profit organization made up primarily of volunteer workers. 
The purpose of the Games, and of the Special Olympics organization as well, is "to offer special training and skill development to mentally retarded people of all ages," according to Pat Foster, a volunteer worker for ISSOC. The Games emphasize competition not with each other but with the odds facing the mentally handicapped, according to Foster. 
The Games are scheduled from July 31 through August 8, which is between the end of Summer Session and the start of fall football practice. 
15,000 volunteers necessary for Games 
By TRIPP BALTZ Senior Staff Reporter 
Referees, decorators, enter­tainers, track rakers, computer as­sistants, drivers, interpreters, guides and janitors. 
These and many other jobs are waiting to be filled by volunteers for the 1987 International Games to be held at the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's campuses this summer. 
Martha Bolyard, director of the Human Services Division for the summer games, said the Games will employ the talents and time of roughly 15,000 volunteers. 
Bolyard, whose division primarily handles recruitment of volunteers, said the response from individuals willing to work the games ha8 been "excellent." 
As Human Services receives the last registration forms, Bolyard es­timated close to 10,000 have volun­teered already. 
Because the athletes are the rea­son for the Games, most of the volun­teer spots will be geared to assist them. "There will be very few (positions) where a volunteer will not come in contact with an athlete," Bolyard said. 
One of the important jobs will be that of "most needed hero," said Stu­dent Commissioner Eric Hickey, who is directing the student volun­teer effort at Notre Dame. These spe­cial volunteers will be on call to help 
How you too can volunteer 
The Special Olympics is counting on 15,000 volunteers to make the 1987 International Games a success. 
Volunteers will come from across the nation to be a part of the special event. Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students have been invited to join Michiana residents in becoming in­volved in the world-wide recognition of the skills of mentally-handicapped people. 
Interested students should go to the Notre Dame Student Govern­ment offices, where volunteer forms are available. Students who live in the Michiana area are especially en­couraged to apply. If you cannot work the entire nine aays of the Games, any time you can give would be greatly appreciated. Forms will be available until April 1. 
If you have any questions, or wish to volunteer after the April 1 dead­line, contact the following people: Eric Hickey (ND students)-283-1868 Mary Beth Wilkin (SMC students) ­284-5150 Father Dori McNeil (faculty and staff) -239-5319

deal with any unforeseen jobs that arise during the course of the Games. They will need to be resourceful and be able to roll with the punches, according to Hickey. 
Although much emphasis has been placed on local civic groups because of the problems students will have getting here for the Games, students are especially needed as volunteers. Because the students know the two campuses well, their aid is espe­cially needed. "Students who know the campus would be a great help, especially since they tend to get very involved" in volunteer activities like the International Games, said Hick­ey. 
Student volunteers would probably be asked to act as drivers and guides around campus, and also to help out with various sales and security tasks, according to Hickey.

Observer Staff Report 
A plethora of sporting events, entertainment, and edu­cational activities await the participants in the 1987 Inter­national Games in South Bend this summer. 
One of the highlights of the nine days of events will be the Opening Ceremonies on Aug. 2. Set in Notre Dame Stadium, almost 60,000 spectators are expected to attend the show, including a parade of athletes and a torch light­ing ceremony. 
The actual sports competitions will be split into two categories. The first, the Official Sports Competition cat­egory, includes Aquatics, Athletics (track and field events), Basketball, Bowling, Gymnastics, Soccer, Softball, and Volleyball. Teams wiH be comprised of ath­letes of approximately equal ability, and medals will be awarded. 
The second category, Demonstration Sports Competi­tion, will include Table Tennis, Equestrian events, Roller Skating, Cycling, Tennis, and Weightlifting. This year, for the first time, medals will be ·awarded to athletes in demonstration sports as well. 
Five more sports will be covered in Exhibition-Clinics as an educational experience for the athletes. Canoeing, Rowing, Sailing, Synchronized Swimming, and Team Handball will all be demonstrated, providing an opportu­nity for athletes and coaches to learn more about these new Special Olympics sports. 
Besides the athletic events themselves, many other ac­tivities will be set up on campus. The EXPO Center, held at O'Laughlin Auditorium, will feature demonstrations, clinics, and discuss-ions on family support, health and nutrition, beauty and exercise, technology, recreation, and the arts. 
An International Dance, an evening at St. Patrick's Park, and a 4-H Fair will also be held as part of the festivities. 
The action will all come to an end on Aug. 7 with the closing ceremonies at the Notre Dame Athletic and Con­vocation Center. 

SPE·CIAL OLYMF 


The athletes for the 1987 International Games come from a wide range of cultures and backgrounds. Over 4,700 mentally handicapped athletes are coming to South Bend from all 50 states and from over 60 other countries. Some come from as far as New Zealand, Nepal, and Taiwan. Many come from countries that are

Notre Dame ar perfect spot f 
By SANDY CERIMELE Staff Reporter 
The honor of hosting the 1987 International Summer Special Olympics Games has been given to South Bend and the Notre DameSaint Mary's community. The dedica­tion of four groups in the South Bend com­munity, the athletic tradition of heroism and the proximity of the world class facilities have all contributed to making the schools an ideal site for this prestigious event. 
The drive to bring the Games to South Bend began with a bid submitted to the Special Olympics headquarters in Washington in No­vember of 1983 by the director of recreation for the Council for the Retarded of St. Joseph County. The bid was compiled with an enor­mous effort from the Indiana Special Olym­pics, Notre Dame, Saint Mary's, and the South BendMishawaka area Chamber of Commerce. These groups all contributed to the 300 page manuscript reviewed by the Kennedy Foundation and Special Olympics International, containing an enormous amount of detail on housing, financing and transportation. 
"The proximity of the facilities takes the 
strain off the atheletes, many of whom are 


relatively unknown: places like Macao, Malami, and Suriname. Five are even from St. Joseph County. Over 1,500 coaches and 10,000 friends and family members will accompany them. They all come for one purpose: to share in the joy and the excitement of the Interna­tional Summer Special Olympics Games.

national Summer Special Olympics Commit­
tee. He said that the former sites were split 
by distances of greater than 100 miles, which 
makes the two campuses and their facilities 
ideal for the Games. 
Because all the necessary facilities for the 
sporting events and cultural and educational 
presentations are almost all located on one 
or the other of the two campuses, Notre 
Dame and Saint Mary's provide an ideal site 
for the Games. The large amount of on­
campus housing was also a factor in the site 
selection. 
Indiana's long-standing commitment to 
amateur sports also contributed to the choice 
of South Bend. The White River Park State 
Games, the Indiana Summer Special Olym­
pics Games, and the upcoming Pan Ameri­
can Games in Indianapolis all illustrate In­
diana's status as a first-rate site for amateur 
athletics. 
The site of the Games was announced on 
June 22, 1984, by Special Olympics Interna­
tional. The community has been working 
ever since to accomodate more than 4,700 
mentally handicapped atheletes in the larg­
est sporting event in South Bend's history.

At its outset, the 1987 International Summer Games faced a fund-raising goal of $4.8 million. With 80 percent of that already collected, fund-raising has been, in the words of the director of Financial Development, "an absolute success." 
The Fund-Raising Committee of the International Summer Special Olympic Committee OSSOC) set its budget three and a half years ago, Director Bill Scholl explained. 
The Board of Directors, chaired by Ervin Derda, calcuiated the amount of money needed to run the games suc­cessfully. More than 90 percent of the funds collected will finance the nine days of actual events this summer. 
The amount collected so far is enough to enable the games to go on, according to Scholl. The remainder of the $4.8 mil­lion will be used to make the 1987 In­ternational Games an even better pro­duction. 
The majority of the finances have come from corporate and civic spon­sors. Scholl said, "We don't want to drain money from South Bend; we want to bring Coca-Cola from Atlanta and IBM from New York and have them spend their money here.'' 
The Observeri.Jim Carroll 
Two banners portraying the logos of the International Games and the Special Olympics hang outside the International Games offices in downtown South Bend. 

Games fund-raising 'an absolute success' 
The largest donor so far has been Civitan International, a 55,000 member service organization, whose gift of $1.6 million comprises more than a quarter of the ISSOC's goal. 
Scholl mentioned that the primary method of securing corporate sponsor­ship is to concentrate on cause-related marketing. "By giving us money, AT&T can advertise that they support a worthy cause. This makes them look good, and we benefit as well." 
Scholl said that since the Games are a world-class sporting event and a good cause, many corporations and civic groups have jumped at the opportunity to help. 
Although the ISSOC has not actively sought financial help from the South Bend area, many local corporations and civic groups have helped. 
St. Joseph Bank, by organizing three charity golf tournaments, has raised over $250,000. Also contributing is Gates Chevy World and Town and Country Chevrolet, who will donate 200 vehicles for use during the Games. 
Scholl noted, "Although we didn't seek it, support here in South Bend has been tremendous.'' 
The Notre Dame and Saint Mary's communities have also been a great help to the games. 
Scholl pointed out that University President Father Theodore Hesburgh is honorary chairman of the games, and the Notre Dame athletic department has been an integral part of the promo­tion of the Games. 
In particular, Lou Holtz, Digger Phelps, and Lefty Smith have all par­ticipated in celebrity golf events and promotional tours for the Games. 
The larg~st contribution by the Notre Dame community was the $230,000 generated by the Chicago Bears vs. Buffalo Bills exhibition football game held last fall in Notre Dame Stadium. The money raised there helped defray the cpsts of upgrading Cartier Field and the outdoor track. 
Scholl pointed out that the entire fin­ancial realm of the Games is a give­and-take proposition. "We will benefit from being in South Bend and at Notre 
Dame. Likewise, they will benefit from our being here." 
John Peck, an economist at Indiana University at South Bend, estimates hosting the Games will bring $20 million in new funds to the South Bend area. Also, Notre Dame will benefit from a general upgrading of facilities.

One area that Notre Dame will bene­fit from is Stepan Center, the roof of which will be repaired at the ISSOC's expense. 
Scholl said the fund-raising aspects of the Games would not be so successful if it weren't for the work of the four-man Fund-Raising Committee, chaired by Bill Haehnel of Civitan International. 
In addition to Haehnel, Art Decio,

How you too can contribute 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's stu­dents can help the International Summer Special Olympics Commit­tee reach its $4.8 million goal. 
According to Bill Scholl, Director of Financial Development, ''Every amount is significant." Scholl noted that although no student is going to donate $500,000, there ·are many ways students can help the ISSOC raise money. 
The best way for students at Notre Dame or Saint Mary's to contribute is to organize and attend fund­raisers. For example, the Trident Naval Society, a relatively small group on campus, raised $6000 by 
work, the less (volunteers) we'll need." 
Bolyard said Human Services will begin placement of volunteers in jobs "in a week or so." Placement of workers will be made on a first registered, first placed basis. 
"Some individuals applied 15 to 18 months ago," Bolyard says. She ex­plained that although no one can be guaranteed a job, applications en­tered before the April 1 deadline will have the highest priority. 
Campus involvement in similar activities has been good, according Jerry Hammes, and Dan Harshma have volunteered their time and exper­tise to fund-raising. Of particular inter­est is the fact that as director of the Logan Center, Harshman has hands-on 
knowledge  about  fund-raising  and  
handicapped people.  
Although  the  fund-raising  for  the  

Games has gone well so far, Scholl stresses his group is far from finished. "We are not done. We have already raised more than any other Interna­tional Games in the past, but we still want to add to it. 
We want the 4700 athletes to get the world class event they deserve." 
soliciting sponsors for its 24-hour run. Some of that money also came from the sale of Special Olympics T-shirts. 
Scholl also noted that a campus­wide event would be great for the Games. "Having the two campuses working together would be neat. It would create dollars, publicity, and interest.'' In addition to large scale fund-raiser events, individual contri­butions are also welcomed. Money can be sent to:

Since students volunteering for the Games may have problems finding the time and the means to travel back to South Bend, the volunteer effort is concentrating on local stu­dents. Even students in the Chicago area can· come down for a day or a weekend and help out, according to Hickey.
