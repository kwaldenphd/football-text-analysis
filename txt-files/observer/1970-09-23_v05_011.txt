The SLC 
The Student Life Council should meet again soon if the members ~:an find a time to meet when they are all free. H seems that the university has finally ne­ated enough committees, subcommittees, study groups, and other breeds of organi­zations so that people can be effedively kept out of the dassroom 95% of the time. So many committees have been created that there is no one time when all the members of the Student Life Council, the father and super committee of all committee's, can meet. 
The effects of this grand predicament was evidenced in the Council's first meeting of the year. The Council has always been notoriously slow getting things dc:1e. There are a number of new members on this year's Coundl and they set out immediately to prove that they wuld waste time just as well, if not bet­ter, then past members have. 
Over one hour was set aside, through no consdous effort, for the purpose of discussing when the coundl would meet during the year. The method which the council used in its deliberations equaled, if not surpassed, the efficient means which they used in handling matters last year. Periodically someone would suggest a possible lime o.nty to find out that there was someone else who was busy at that time. This went on for nearly one hour. There were members who had faculty committee meetings, department meetings, and revival meetings. Amazing there were even individuals who said that they wuld not attend because they had to go to classes at that hour; although not many. 
Finally the council did the obvious. It did not come easily. Father Riehle sug­
gested that all the members write down the times when they would be available to meet and then he would tabulate the 
results and find a time when all wuld meet. 
In order to avoid doing things sloppily and in haste, additional discussion was held. The time was not wasted though. Father Riehle's proposal was changed. Council members were to list the times when they would not be able to attend rather than the times that they would. ' 
The Council did manage to squeeze in a half an hour of discussion on the Ju­dicial Code. Although many people don't realize it, the SLC was established with 
revision of the Code as its primary responsibility. That was back in 1968, when the Trustees approved the concept of the Council. ln the letter authorizing the Council, the Trustees specifically stated that revision of the judicial system would he one of its primary duties. 
By the spring of 1969 the Council had appointed a wmmittee to write a new wde. Under the chairmanship of Assistant Dean Foschio of the Law School the committee met throughout

the summer and came up With a volumi­nous code with legal procedures and safeguards for students and a system of courts which would have kept everyone who was not involved in breaking a law involved in sitting on hearing hoards. 
After a wuple of months of hearings last fall the SLC accepted the wmmit­tee's code and sent it on to Father Hesburgh for his approval. There were two dissident voices; that of Father Burtchaell, now University Provost and of then, Student Body. President,' Phil McKenna. Burtchaelt thought that the code included too many hearing b, ards and would make things too complicated. McKenna sought to simplify it for reasons related to his philosophical view of the relationship t(lat should exist between members of the university. McKenna then stood alone among the 
students  sitting  on  the  Council  in  being  
opposed  to  the  code.  
Father  Heshurgh  returned  the  wdc  to  
the  wuncil  with  suggestions  for  improve­ 

ment. By now it was the spring of 1970 and with the Council wrapped up in the midst of spring time they wrnpletely reversed field and decided to let McKenna and Burtchacll work on an entirely new document; a more simplified code. 
The new code was presented at the Council's last meeting of last year. It was short, simple, and to the point. It was accepted by the Council with little revision and sent to Father Hesburgh who in turn forwarded it to the Trustees for their approval. 
But the Trustees objected to part of the wde. While student found guilty by their peers wuld appeal to higher authorities, the wde did not provide for the Dean of Students to appeal cases in which students were found innocent of 
the initial charges brought against them. 
The Trustees point, the Council was informed, was not to break legal tradi­tion and to aeate a code where students could be held in double jeopardy. They 
were concerned a buot the instances where the student court would flagrantly ignore the facts or misinterpret a rule. 
No matter what the rhetoric may be, the real question is not who may appeal and who may not. The real question is whether students can be trusted with the primary responsibility of running the judidal system. That question is part of the larger issue of "student responsi­bili~y." That issue has been continually avOided when problems have been discus­sed on this campus. It is about time that it is aired. The SI.C's deliberations on the Code might be the opportumty. 
If it was settled it might make de­cision making a lot easier around here. And besides, a lot of student leaders might be forced to reevaluate their posi­tions.

LE.~VI~G THE 



Law and Order 
The controversy over Law and Order flared anew this summer with the passage of the Nixon administration's anit-crime bill for Washington D.C. The bill's critics-the most notable being Sen. Sam Erwin, whose opposition brought forth a spate of condescending remarks from the media to the effed that even conservatives sC?metimes care for people's rights-charge that two provisions of the b1ll arc repressive and unconstitutional. 
There is no doubt that the two measures-the no knock provision and the pre-trial provision-are repressive. After all what else should society do with crime, but repress it? The word used in the aitics' sense was meant to convey a dark evil pidure of Gestapo-like police abusing dtizen's rights. However are the measures repressive, in the aitics' sense'! Will they result in large scale violation of rights? If one examines the fads the answer seems to be no. 
Take for example the no-knock provision. Suppose the police strongly susped that several persons in an apartment are engaged in cutting heroin. Accordingly they will obtain a "no-knock" warrant go to the apartment and burst in without announcing themselves. If the inhabitants arc engaged in legtimate adivity they will suffer no ill effeds beyond the unwekome intrusion of the police. If, how­ever, they arc engaged in processing dope they won't have a chance to flush their poison down the toilet. 
Critics raise another point though. They daim that by abusing the law, police will be able to harass minority groups who are not en­gaged in any unlawful activity. This charge is,very turs. Let us sup­pose_ t_he local police decide to harass the local Black Panthers. Upon receiVIng word that several of them have congregated in a nearby apartment detectives arc ordered to enter and search the apartment for narcotics violations. The detectives acquire a "no-knock" war­rant and go to the apartment. Upon bursting in they fail to find any na_rc~tics yet use a flimsy pretext to arrest the Panthers. Obviously th1s IS an abuse of the "no-knock" provision and a clear case of r.olice har~~sment. Yet what i~ the police had not been able to get a 
~o-knock warrant. Would 1t have made any difference? It cer­tamly didn't in Chicago when to Panthers were killed by the police in their apartment. 
The fad is that the no-knock provision is not giving the police any more power for abuse than they already have. If they wish to harass peop_l~ they can, for as long as they can get away with it. Yet this proviSion could make the split second difference between arrest and escape for many person involved in criminal activity. 
The same premise of "sufficent power already exists" holds true ~1th the pre-trial detention provision. Critics maintain t1at the fail­mg of a susped, before he has been tried and convicted no matter w~at his rcwrd~ is a_violation of vicil liberties. Now a ~ery serious pomt c~n be ra1sed, m the case of an acwmplished criminal, as to whose nghts arc to hold sway, his or societies'? 
Let us say a man is accused of assaulting a woman and there were half a dozen people who witnessed it. Can the judge, in all conscience, after seeing the man's record with several previous convictions for violent crimes, allow the man to go free on bail: 
_In fad the ~achinery for the man's pre=trial detention already cx1sts. All the .JUdge has to do is to set bail high enough so that the d~fendant can't meet it. In effed the pre-trial detention provision will remove an inequity since it is obvious that present bail procedure discriminates against the poor. Now if a man is incar­cerated before trial it will be because the judge feels he is a menace to society, not merely because he is poor. 
Th~.: new provision for the District of Columbia won't open up new avenues for abuses. The power to abuse already exists for the police and the judiciary. With these provisions however police may be able to damp down more effedively on drugs and judges will be spared the hyponitical resort to high bail in order to lock repeaters up.

Cambodian ,troopers move after being stalled 
PHNOM PENH (UPI) -Cam­bodian paratroopers spearhead­ing the largest government task force of the war advanced north­ward yesterday after being stall­ed for eight days by a Com­munist blockade. They flanked a village where North Vietnamese troops were reported dug in 52 miles north of Phnom Penh. Elsehwere in Cambodia, a force of 3000 South Vietnamese marines and infantrymen swept through flooded rice paddies southeast of the key Mekong River ferry crossing at Neak Leung, and rounded up 160 sus­pected Communists. A spokesman for Laotian left-wing forces in a Hanoi broadcast heard in Tokyo charged Tuesday night that South Vietnamese troops with U.S. advisers had launched an offensive in the Attopeu area of southern Laos.

Soviets relay U.S. message 
WASHINGTON (UPI) The United States waited yesterday for a response to its urgent re­quest, relayed by the Russians, that Syria withdraw its tanks from northern Jorday and ease the threat of warfare engulfing the Middle East. 
Word that the Soviet Union had cooperated in the primary 
U.S. diplomatic thrust in the cri­sis was received at about 6 p.m. Monday when July M. Voront­sov, the Soviet charge d'affaires; called on Joseph J. Sisco, assis­tant Secretary of State for Near Eastern affairs, at the State De­partment. 
The department said Tuesday that "the Soviet government is in touch with the Syrian govern­ment" about Secretary of State William P. Rogers' request for a withdrawal from Jordan. 
There was no indication 
whether the Russians endorsed 
Rogers' plea or merely trans­
mitted it to the Syrians. "The 
real test of whether that is a 
meaningful matter will turn on 
whether or not forces from Syria 
are withdrawn from Jordan," 
said department spokesman 
Robert J_ McCloskey. 
The White House confirmed 
that King Hussein had sent mes­
sages to U.S., British, French 
and Soviet members of the U.N. 
Security Council "regarding 
what assistance could be pro­
vided diplomatically." 
Press Secretary Ron<Jld Ziegler 
refused to say whether Hussein 
h<Jd soundl~d out the United 
States about intervening mili­
tarily to save his regime. McClos­
key said Hussein's appeal to the 
Big Four was "not in terms of a 
request for military interven­
tion" and neither he nor Ziegler 
would divulge the contents of 
direct communications between 
Washington and Amman. 
McCloskey made clear that for the moment, the United St<Jtcs W<JS attaching the most weight to Roger's message to Moscow Sunday for help in im­pressing Syria with the danger posed by its armored move into Jordan. 
"The most significant diplo­matic effort is the approach to the Soviet Union," McCloskey said. 
U.S. officials observed Tues­day that Syrian forces had dug in along the lrbid Ramtha line and had not tried to advance toward Amman, the Jordanian capital, 50 miles to the south. 
This enables the Syrians to partially flank the Israelis, who weakened Syria's military posi­tion when they occupied the Golan Heights in the 1967 war, Defense Department sources noted. 
Vogel to deliver 
Reilly Lecture 

A German chemist will des­cribe his research on molecular architecture in the first Reilly Lecture in Chemistry, scheduled for Wedncsd<Jy and Friday at 
4:30 
p.m. in Room 123 of the Nieuwland Science Hall. 

D. 
Emmanuel Vogel, profess­or of organic chemistry at the University of Colgnc, will deliver three talks under the general heading "Novel Aspects of Aro­matic CIJemistry ." The series will describe research in which Vogel and his associates synthes­ized several complex molecules to test an important theory in organic chemistry. 


Vogel h<Js served as a visiting professor at Fordham University and the University of Chicago, as well as Sandin Lecturer at the University of Alberta, Canada. He has held the chair of organic chemistry at the Universitylof Cologne since 1961. 
The Reilly Lectures in Chem­istry are sponsored by the Col­lege of Science and the depart­ment of chemistry at Notre Dame. They arc funded by an endowment form the late In­dianapolis industrialist, Peter C. Reilly.

Wrap-up of news around the ~orld 

Bormann unsuccessful 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Astronaut Frank Borman, who once told Congress of his trium­phal trip around the moon, told a joint session Tuesday that all he found in his 14 nation at­tempt to free U.S. prisoners of war was "American anguish and human tragedy." 
The House and the Senate, assembled in a rare joint meeting and joined by most of the cab­inet, listened solemnly as the commander of the Apollo 8 mis­sion described the plight of 1500 Americans missing or imprisoned in Southeast Asia. 
Nine ex-POWs in military dress listened from front row seats, their families and those of about 60 men missing or im­prisoned were in the galleries for the report from '3orman on his 25 day, 14 nation tour to seek help for U.S. efforts to release the prisoners. 
"The last time l was here," Borman recalled,"I was able to 
tell  you  about  the  voyage  of  
Apollo  8,  and  I  was  able  to  
report  to  you  that  it  was  an  

American success and a human triumph." 
"I have recently returned from a 25 day trip around the globe in furtheran ce of the cause of our prisoners of war, and I must tell you that I cau only report American anguish and human tragedy." 
The wives -some widows but unaware of it sat dry-eyed and tight-lipped. Only 3 23 of the estimated 1500 captured or missing Americans have been al­lowed to communicate with their families and North Viet­nam has never acknowledged holding any of them. 
Borman said he failed to make 
personal  contact  with  North  
Vietnam  and  the  Viet  Cong  
"through  third  parties in  three  

countries," and could get no closer to Hanoi itself than Vien­tiane, Laos. 
The: only positive result from his trip was his promise that "North Vietnam will receive new and additional entreaties from many of the countires we visit­ed." 
General William C. West­moreland, Army Chief of Staff and former U.S. commander in Vietnam, sat in the gallery as the guest of the wives along with other service chiefs. 
The huge House chamber was only about two thirds full when House Speaker John W. McCormack first introduced Borman, expressing America's "extraordinary sense of moral outrage" at the war U.S. prison­
ers have been treated. Speaking from notes on yel­low paper which he said com­

prised his report to President Nixon in San Clemente Septem­ber 2nd, Borman warned Hanoi that U.S. policy in Vietnam can­not be swayed by North Viet­namese abuse of prisoners. 
He asked Congress and the Cabinet to do as he did nightly after "a frustrating day" during his trip when "I tried to place myself mentally in the position of a prisoner in a North Viet­namese prison camp." 
"After your capture, you are probably beaten, dragged through villages, and in some cases tortured," he said. "You probably have lost 45 to 60 pounds. Your food generally consists of two meals a day, one rice and squash soup and an evening meal of pig fat. 
"It is designed barely to keep you alive, it appears, as is the medical care destined to barely avert death ... You are probab­ly held in solitary confinement." 
When Borman, to loud ap­plause, denounced as "utter rub­bish" North Vietnamese claims that the prisoners were war crim­inals, Senator J. William Ful­bright, D Arkansas, chairman of the Senate foreign Relations Committee, did not join in but

Agnew labels FCC 
official permissive 

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (UPI) Vice-President Spiro T. Agnew Tuesday singled out a member of the Federal Communications Commission as the type of "super permissive" government officials who have encouraged the country's youth to use mari­juana and other drugs. 
Agnew did not name the of­
ficial in his speech to a fund 
raising luncheon but he made it 
plain he was referring to Nich­
olas Johnson, who was appoint­
ed to the FCC in 1966 by 
former President Lyndon Baines 
Johnson. 
The vice-president said he was "surprised and shocked" by Johnson's reaction to a speech he made in Las Vegas last week in which Agnew said some "pro­ponents of the drug culture are misusing popular music to get across their message." 
"This appointee of a previous administration promptly took the side of the rock musicians and echoed their pronounce­ments about how many songs were produced with anti-drug lyrics," Agnew said. 
"He went on, however, to espouse the kind of radical lib­eral philosophy of permissive­ness and self-flagellation that has encouraged so many of our young people to turn to pot and 
worse." 

Johnson last Thursday told a group of foreign service officers that Republicans should stop ac­cepting campaign contributions 
from liquor a_nd c~garette mak­ers and corporations whose ads 
promote the drug culture. 

"One cannot help but wonder how he [AgnewI overlooked Ford's urging, 'Blow Your Mind,' TWA's taking us 'Up, Up, and A way,' the money comrany that suggests we 'Get High on Money,' the motor bike com­pany that advertises 'A Trip on This One is Legal,"' said John­son. 
"Perhaps the critical point is that young song writers and per­formers don't make political campaing contributions, but that Ford, TWA and other drug ., image merchandisers do."

Lafayette, Ind. -Purdue's inexperienced defense, bolstered by its shutout of potentially explosive Texas Christian, keys the Boilermakers' hopes of extending a three-game 
winning streak against Notre Dame Saturday before 59,075 fans in Notre Dame Stadium. 
Using six first-time defensive starters, Purdue bent for 367 yards against TCU, but cashed in on cornerback R_andy Cooper~_Jflterception

Voices from the crowd 
Boilermaker win in South Bend. Recent battles between the collegiate powerhouses have been played for "The Shillelagh" (since 1957) and usually decided by super quarterbacks. However, the Boilers enter Notre Dame Stadium Saturday without the graduated Mike Phipps-master of the Irish for the past three seasons. His replacement sophomore Chuck Piebes (Valhalla, N.Y.) 
called only eight pass plays in the triumph over TCU completing half of them. 
With fullbacks John Bullock (Newport News, Va.) and Bill Corcoran (San Gabriel, Calif.) nursing injuries, DeMoss entrusted his ground game a 1 m 0 s t ex c 1 us i v e 1 y t 0

J'm from the East and have always admired Cosell for speaking his mind. Monday night, however, he showed exquisite bad taste. His pre-game interview with Namath and AI Atkinson was very forced with the two feuding (pre-season, anyway) players looking very uncomfortable. And Cosell's blatant pro-Jet broadcasting was insufferable. 
Apparantly Cosell feels he has a duty to convince the USA that New York teams are superior. Unable to reconcile himself to the score, Cosell constantly cited statistics in an effort to prove to the audience that injustice was being done to the Jets. And after the final Brown interception and touchdown, he sounded almost as if he were in tears.
