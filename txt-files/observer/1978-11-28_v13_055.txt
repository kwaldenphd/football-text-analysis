(AP)-A federal grand jury indicted seven liquor companies yesterday -including Joseph E.

Also indicted on the bribery charges were nine officers of those companies. The indictments charge that between November 1973 and August 1976 the companies and officers gave cases of liquor valued at about $27,300 to state officials to obtain business from the state Alcohol Beverage Control Commission, which is the sole legal retailer of bottles of liquor in West Virginia.

The nation's highest court turned its back to arguments by Farber and the Times that the contempt-of-court conviction's violated the Constitution's free-press protections and a state reporters' shield law. Farber spent 40 days in jail and the Times paid $285,000 in fines after being found in contempt of a New Jersey judge's request for files compiled by Farber in his investigation of a series of mysterious hospital deaths. !Hostages decide to stay WYANDOTTE, Mich.

A spinoff of the Catholic Hospi­tal Association, the Center primari­ly conducts or analyzes research on medical-moral concerns and com­municates its findings to the na­tion's bishops and Catholic health ministry. 
''Recent advances in medicine, in technology, and in science profoundly affect the very nature of man and his future," notes the Center's president, Fr. Albert Moraczewski. "The Pope John XXIII Center attempts to explore the shades of opinions regarding these advances and to clarify the issues in light of the Church's teachings," Moraczewski said. 

The purpose of the consultation, according to Moraczewski, "is to bring together the varying perspec­tives on these issues and to then use this input to define the specific goals and objectives of the Center over the next five years."

land in Chicago, since the South Bend Airport was closed. Because the original DC-10, which seated 181 people, was snowbound in the Midwest, United sent a DC-8 that seated 162 people. The other 19 students waited until 2:30 a.m. for another flight. 
According to ND Senior Class vice-president Julie Rittenhouse, the second United flight out of Los Angeles was also delayed because it was coming from the Midwest. 
One of the charter flights man­aged to land in South Bend at approximately 11 a.m. yesterday and the other two landed in Chicago around 6 a.m. Students waited until 9 a.m. for buses back to South Bend, and arrived on campus around noon. 
Rittenhouse noted that the buses arrived late in Chicago, and then refused to leave until they were full since more people than expected would be landing in Chicago. 
"All the delays were really due to the weather, so you can't blame the buses or the airlines," Ritten­house said, adding, "the hotel, the tour company, and the airlines all treated us like royalty.''

VIRGINS & MARTYRS 
by Kathleen Connelly • 
• 
Dolores Frese's book Virgins and Martyrs, is a feminist piece of writing, but it would be a mistake to dtsmiss it as only one lllore of pletbora sofamiliarbooks being cranked out by irate libbers. Frese'S' book not only treats issues involving women's self-awareness, but also expands upon the subject so that the material is applicable to men and women alike.
.. 
Frese also takes a critical view of hard-core feminism. She satirizes the attitude that men are responsible for all the problems of women. She instead very sanely points out that not all of women's difficulties are functions of sexism and demonstrates that women play as mueh of a role in their own oppression as men. 
A collection of four short stories, the book offers four different reactions to oppressive forces which threaten each woman with the destruction of their established routine. In
• 
the first story, "Taking Stock" a woman is unjustly accused by an insensitive husband of having an affair. What the husband fafls to realize is that his wife's peculiar 
behavior is due to the fact that she is pregnant at 46 and is afraid of delivering a deformed child. 
Just as he forces his son's girlfriend to have an abortion, he drives his wife to terminate her pregnancy. Frese illustrates that contrary to popular feminist belief, abortion is not necessarily a liberating toc:il, but rather can be one more way that men ultimately have unreasonable control over the lives of women. 
Although Frese demonstrates tl\at there are , mechanisms built into relationships and society by which men may control the lives of women, she also points out that women often act to oppress themselves and eachother better and more effectively than any man could. l'his point comes across particularly in "Funeral Games." The central figure, Mrs. Koska, is portrayed as an unwitting victim of a puritannical female myth passed on to her by her mother. She has a dutiful attitude to her conjugal obligations, and is more interest­ed in mothering. 
It is not until after hergrown<;On Stan has died that she is free to question her taste for the role of mother. Previously, she had accepted her duties as a woman in her husband's house, b~t she ultimately becomes unconsciously aware that her maternal instincts and capabilities are limited to young children, just as a girl child prefers to play with infant dolls. As her son grew older, she never realized that his needs were also growing. She cared for his physical needs, but overlooked his psychological and emotional needs. In her own mind he remained a child. 
Mrs. Koska looked at her world through blinders and her life was lacking because ot of it. In "By the Streams of Babylon'·' a young nun attempts to remove her fetters. and finds herself suddenly without any sense of connectedness no points of reference. She eventually comes to realize the necessity of placing boundaries· in one's life for the sake of order, but fails to recogui7;e alternative channels by which she may e~press herself. · 
An older more mature man on the other hand, discovers that those vows she has taken and the rules she foJiows are not meant to be restrictive, but are rather guidelines and that she may awaken and give expression to facets of herself she had previously suppressed without being un­true to her-lifestyle and·ideals: 
The final story, "Women Alone," could easily be misunderstood to be the ravings of a radical feminist, if one hadn't read at least one of the other stories first. The piece presents for the ueader's considerat­ion a woman who blamt!s all of her difficulties on the men in her }ife. It is altogether too obvious from the sensitive portrayals of even the ghastliest men in the previous stories, Frese is not subject to suth radical v1ews as those held by Juliana Wergen. Rather, the story is a statement · about how that attitude itself can be more destructive than the real injustices she faces as awoman. Juliana is incapable of dealing with crisis situations because in her mind she has made horrible inconquer­able beast of men in general. It becomes such a force that she is helpless before it. 
ylrgins and Martyrs is a skillfully assembled and thoughtfully composed book that deals specifically with various reactions to the place of wom~n in confining environments and relationships. Frese is. a master. of effect, singling out an instant in time and stressing it until it becomes surreal and grotesque, calling to mind frustrated midnight dreams of in­adequacy and persecution.

I'll be sitting outdoors, IPZing with cool detachment at the people ·<:currying about on the· quad. A forgotten Huddle coke turns tepid at my side but, secure Jn my blissful bubble of apathy, such trivia cannot faze me now. I've just paid my Indiana phone bill with a check that won't bounce for at least two days. I've concocted an airtight alibi to excuse my overdue paper. I have a week's worth of c,Iean socks, found my I.D. in the medicine' cabinet, and finally wrote Uncle Marvin a thank-you note for his last Christmas present. . 
In short,while I haven't quite solved The Mystery of Life, I figure the butler prob•ably did it anyway, and I can wait until the paperback edition comes out. ,

Career crisis. When everyone around you seems to have A Calling and all you''ve got is an unlisted number. When the whole world is your oyster but you know it's really just another red herring. When you've finally hitched your wagon to a star only to discover that the Conestoga has been recalled.

As the child prodigies grow up, they're directed by a guiding light that remains untouched by energy conservation measures. 
These people are to be envied for their sure-mindedness and singular goals. They are to be admired for their remarkable self-understanding and awareness. These people lead well-organized lives and can predict with 99.9 percent accuracy where they will be and what they'll be doing on July 16, 1985.

Carter warns of 'tight' budget 

nextyear 

ST. WUIS [AP] ·President Carter, declaring that "no aspect of government will be sacred," warn­ed the nation's top urban leaders yesterday that the next federal budget will be "very, very tight" and that they will have to exercise restraint to help fight inflation. 
''All of you have been through the budget cycle yourself, and you know what it is to face unlimited demands with limited resources," he told the board of directors of the National League of Cities. 
In an earlier speech before the league's annual convention, Carter pledged "to do this without starv· ing useful programs." He said repeatedly that military spending will be scrutinized as carefully as domestic programs, but he did not say military spending would be cui. 
Carter is committed to cutting his 1980 federal budget by between $15 billion and $20 billion to achieve a federal deficit of no more than $30 billion. White House officials have said military spend­would not be cut, raising concerns among city officials. 
Carter left little doubt that urban programs will be reduced. City leaders are anticipating these cuts, and Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles told the president: "This year is going to be critical for us because we have pledged that we will work with you and that we will take our fair share of cuts." 
The League of Cities says it supports Carter's anti-inflation strategy, including budget cuts, as long as it does not lead to an economic downturn that would substantially increase unemploy­ment. 
Carter, addressed that concern, asserted that, "I do not anticipate a recession or, or course, a depres­
sion. No economic adviser who works with me believes there will be a recession in 1979."

One of the things the cameras and spectators couldn't capture was just how physical this game was. John Robinson, USC head coach, who has been in the coaching business for 18 years and was a player before that, was moved to say, "It was as ha. J a hitting game in the frrst half as I've ever seen. A lot of people got hurt. We had our tackles going in and out of the game. It was just a hard hitting game." · 
While Calhoun and Golic were the only two players injured seriously enough for the Irish to be removed from the game, there were many other players aching with bruises afterwards. The consensus among Notre Dame players was that they have never hit or been hit harder in their careers. 
The reason USC hit so hard was becuase they were simply that big. The offen.;ive line averaged 6-4, 255 pounds, while the defensive line was a miniscule 6-3, 242 pounds, on the average. UCLA coach Terry Donahue said that the USC team had better athletes than the local professional football teams in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Dan Devine commented that they were weaker in only two positons than his 1974 Green Bay Packer team that won the Central Division of the NFC. 
On the other hand, the Irish went into the game with both Vagas Ferguson and Jerome Heavens below par physically, and it showed. "Neither Heavens or Ferguson practiced all week, so they weren't up to top efficiency, but every team has injuries and I don't want to make alibis," said Devine. 
In actuality, the Irish had no business staying close to Southern Cal. They were much smaller and slower than their opponents. After the game the ND players themselves marveled at the speed, size and agility of the team they lined up against. 
"What makes Charles White different from other good backs is his offensive line. They are definitely the best I've ever seen," said Bob Golic. "When those guards pull on a sweep there is no way to stop them." 
"Their linemen hit so hard, it was unbelievable," commented Pete Johnson. "They hit harder than any group I've ever seen. Brad Budde (6-5, 253 lbs.) should be in the pros right now." 
Players that are not used .to being manhandled, could only shake their heads after getting knocked on their rear ends. So what enabled Notre Dame to hold a 2S-24lead before falling victim to a mistake by a referee?

Devine commented afterwards, "It 
was one of the most remarkable 
comebacks in the history of the 
game. Southern Cal dominated the

played me man-to-man and I felt 
more comfortable. They just

plained Haines. 
The game's end came as a severe shock for the Notre Dame team as silence reigned afterwards." It went from the happiest moment of the season to the saddest,'' lamented Haines. 
The closing seconds contraver­sial call weighed heavily on the Irish's mind. "If it was a bad decision it cost us the ball game," offered Devine. "The pain it caused those kids is irreparable and if he made a mistake he should never work another game." 
"It was a hard hitting game in the first half as I've ever seen,'' commented USC head coach John Robinson. "Notre Dame kept coming back as fine as I've ever seen; but, we did too. When you have two great teams battling· out there, you can expect things like that to happen." 
The Irish must now prepare for the Cotton Bowl on January 1 while USC will play in the Rose Bowl later that day. 



leers jump to number one spot

Never. 
Never in regular season play. 
Never in the 10 years since Lefty 
Smith revived the sport at Notre 
Dame. 
Never once in the past seven 
seasons during which the Irish 
have been members ofthe Western 
Collegiate Hockey Association. 
But maybe eight is the Notre 
Dame hockey team's lucky num­
ber. It came during its eighth 
season after its eighth game on the 
18th of November ofthe year 1978. 
And the Irish even won one of those 
games that weekend by an eight 
goal margin. 
After all this, the Notre Dame 
hockey team found itself number 
one. Not number one in the 
WCHA--number one in the 
country. 
After a 9-1 and 5-4 sweep of Michigan State a week and a half ago, the national collegiate hockey poll conducted by WMPL radio (Houghton, Mich.) placed Notre Dame on top of every college hocke)"' team in the country. The Irish had received a preseason ranking of number one in 1973 but this is the first time in its history that they have ever attained top status during the regular season. 
Notre Dame lived up to its new title this past weekend while mov­ing into frrst place in the WCHA with a sweep of the Michigan Wolverines, 7-3 and 6-3. Couple that with the fact that second­ranked Denver tied and lost to Michigan Tech in the Mile High City and the odds would be in your favor if you were betting that the Irish would keep its number one ranking for a second straight week. 
Frlday:Meredltb's second hat trick 
Gr~g Meredith's hat trick high­lighted Notre Dame's 7-3 win over Michigan Friday night. It was the second time in as many weeks that the Toronto native reached that 
mark and the fourth time in this 

career. He scored four against 
Michigan State on Nov. 17. 

The Wolverines took a 1-0 lead at the 6:31 mark of the first period when Tim Manning scored his third goal of the year. The Irish took over from there, however, and reeled off six unanswered goals to gain their sixth win of the year. 
Dave Poulin scored his sixth goal of the year on a power play at the 
9:52 mark of the first to even the score and Meredith notched his first goal of the night with 1:30 remaining to give Notre Dame a 2-1 lead it would never lose. 
Meredith picked up right where he left off to start the second period with a goal just 44 seconds after the opening faceoff. Senior Brian Burke scored his first goal of the year on assists from linemate Kevin Nagurski and defenseman Jim Brown at the 6:26 mark as the Irish continued to dominate play in this period. 

Meredith completed his hat trick at 15:21 off Steve Schneider's second assist of the night to close out tfle scoring for this period. Notre·Dame unloaded 21 shots on Wolverine goalie Rudy Varvari during the 20 minutes while hold­ing Michigan to five on Irish netminder Dave Laurion. 
Kevin Humphreys scored his second shorthanded goal of the year 5:41 into the final period to put the Irish ahead 6-1. Michigan's
