Basilica undergoes restoration work 
External renovation fixes 2007 storm damage 
at the top of the Basilica ­was already scheduled to take place before the storm. 
Strong winds associated with severe thunderstorms swept through campus on the Tuesday of Senior Week 2007, knocking off one of the four minor spires from the bell tower of the Basilica. The front-left spire shattered southeast of the Basilica's main entrance during the storm, which also damaged dozens of trees on campus. 
Shortly after the storm, Marsh said, the roof of the Basilica was inspected and the metal pieces of the three remaining small spires -the "metal hats" -were removed for "preventative" reasons. 
Part of the current renova­tion process entails rebuilding the spires and installing rein­forcing steel, Marsh said. 
University Sacristan John Zack, as well as other staff at the Basilica, has worked closely with the University Architect's office to direct the

4 rectors adjust to nevv roles 
Hall leaders discuss first week on the job 
By TESS CIVANTOS 
News Writer 
Notre Dame welcomed four new rectors this academic year in Pangborn, Pasquerilla West, Keenan and in the new men's residence, Duncan Hall. 
Father Tom Eckert, a former rector of St. Edward's Hall, was selected as the first rector of the West Quad's brand-new Duncan Hall. 
"When we were handing out maps to the freshmen and their parents at check-in we realized Duncan Hall wasn't on the map," Eckert said, so hall staff drew Duncan themselves. 
"We're going to put our place on the map," he said. "There's more excitement because there's a lot of things we get to start."

One of the most iconic build­ings on Notre Dame's campus has taken on a different look in the last few months, as an intricate scaffolding system has been erected around the front of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart to facilitate scheduled renovations. 
The $1.8 million renovation 
.began shortly after com­mencement last May and is on schedule, said Associate Vice President and University Architect Doug Marsh. The scaffolding, which will take about a month to deconstruct, will begin coming down in the next couple of weeks, he said. 
The restoration process is repairing the damage done to the Basilica by a storm during Senior Week in May 2007, but Marsh said repair work to the exterior of the Basilica ­including fixing aged and weathered wood or metal, applying new paint, repairing mortar joints and any broken

from a convenience store. 
But there is a drug dealer, some­
where in Maryland, who thinks I 
am a lost cause. 
Less than a day after I left my home state, I got a call from a number I didn't recognize, with a zip code that indicated the person was calling from somewhere near Washington, D.C. 
I answered the phone. "Do you want some green?" said a gruff male voice. 
I asked him to repeat his ques­
tion, because I couldn't quite hear 
him. lin repeated it. 
I still was not sure what he was 
asking. So I told him he had the 
wrong numbM. 
lin assured me he had the right 
number. 
"Do you want some green?" 
llis voice was still less than clear. I tried sounding it out. 
"Grenneeeeeen," I said. 
"Yeah, do you want some green?" hn asked again. I finally admitted it. I didn't know what green was. 
At this point, I think he gradually started to realize that maybe he did have the wrong number. 
"Isn't this I>.J.'s friend who works at Maey's? She said you wanted some green." 
I have no friends named D.J. I don't nor have I ever worked at Macy's. And again, I don't know what green is. 
So he hung up on me. 
Even after the call, I was still not sure what the man had been trying to sell me. I thought "green" could be a niekname for U.S. dollars, but selling money for money seems like a fruitless telemarketing scheme. 
Maybe, I thought, green is slang for marijuana. It seemed a little foolish to me for D.J's friend, who works at Macy's, to arrange her drug buys over the phone with a man she doesn't know. But I Googled it. Aecording to Marijuana Dictionary, the online souree with -how appropriate -420 slang terms for marijuana, green refers to inferior quality marijuana. Macy's must not be paying D.J.'s friend very well. 
So now I know. If he calls me again, I'll be ready. "Do I want some 'green'?" I'll say when I get the call. 
"Are you talking about 'cereal' or 'kali'? Some 'Panama Gold'? You want to know if I want some 'Aunt Mary"? The 'white-haired lady,' 'the (J.J.'?" 
"Yeah," he'll say. "That's what I'm selling." I think you're looking for D.J.'s friend.

Book discusses values in business 
i/Getting It Right"focuses on leadership, judgmentfor problem-solving 
Special to The Observer 
One of the case studies pre­sented in the book "Getting It Right: Notre Dame on Leadership and Judgment in Business" involves turning around a bankrupt blood bank. To get back to fmancial health, the organization's leader could choose to discontinue unprof­itable products and stop serving area hospitals that weren't pay­ing off. 
But what if the blood bank's mission is to serve all hospitals and all patients in need? 
"Well, those values would con­strain the possible solutions," says book co-author Ed Conlon, associate dean and Edward Frederick Sorin Society profes­sor in the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame. "Discontinuing products or service would not be possible. We would have to look for another way to turn around the organization." 
Finding "another way" illus­trates the central premise of "Getting It Right" by Conlon and Viva Bartkus, associate profes­sor of management at Notre Dame. Leadership means not only solving tough business problems, but solving them within a framework of well­examined values in order to bring about the best result for the organization and everyone it serves. 
"Without a system of values, a leader cannot even determine whether there is a problem, let alone begin down the path of preparing a solution," Bartkus said. "A leader's values pro­scribe the space where he or she can look for solutions, estab­lish priorities and lay the foun­dation for necessary change."

case studies that demon­strate how problem solving is an essential yet often overlooked leadership quality. Further, Bartkus and Conlon provide a framework for solving compli­cated business problems utiliz­ing management principles taught at Notre Dame. The problem-solving framework shows how to find solutions by examining the problem's symp­toms, move from analysis to action, and drive the solution through the organization. 
The authors spent four years working on "Getting It Right." It is based on Bartkus' work as a 
of the problem-

solving frame­work from the real cases. When these themes are practiced dili­gently, Conlon and Bartkus say the framework helps the reader develop habits of mind and the confidence to discover solutions that are both good and good enough, to where more analysis is not likely to yield a greater impact. The chapters conclude with essays by notable people in business and academia ­including Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, C.S.C., president emeritus of Notre Dame -who reflect on the thorny problems they weren't able to solve.

en sandwich and pizza -two of the restaurant's biggest sell­ers-won't be featured on the new menu have nothing to worry about, Miller said. Many familiar items still remain, and the smoothie menu is the same. 
"People who have had expe­rience with the menu wanted something new," Miller said. 
He said the chef, Don Miller, who is of no relation, wanted to create a menu with "a taste profile with a lot of unique variations." 
"You have the sweet and salty of prosciutto instead of regular ham. The pancetta is cured and goes beyond the little nuances of regular bacon," Miller said. 
These changes, he said, make· Heckers menu, with its domi­nant Italian and Mediterranean influence, unique on campus. Fresh ingredients include basil, shaved parmesan and fresh mozzarella cheese. 
"We're the only people on campus with those kinds of' ingredients," Miller said. 
The new menu contains a list of ingredients that are avail­able a la carte that can be added to a sandwich or as top­pings on pizza, which allows students to create their own combinations. 
"It's the beginning of thn school year, but I think it's been well-received so far," Miller 
said. "Though, some people 
miss the meatball sub." 
The focus on organic and 
locally-grown and produced 
ingredients is part of NDFS' 
goal in continuing to focus on 
sustainability. Though he 
couldn't say if' the menu con­
tains overall healthier choices 
than the old menu, Miller 
emphasized the f'reshness of 
the ingredients. 
"There's so much fresh pro­
duce and not so much focus on 
the spreads and sauces," he 
said. 
On Tuesday, the first day of 
dasses, Heckers resumed being 
open 24 hours a day for the 
academic year. Not all mlmu 
items arc always ol'fernd, how­
ever, which is something Miller 
hopes will change. 
Breakfast, f'or example, is currently only availabln from 6 -10 a.m. Those hours will be expanded, and breakf'ast foods will be available to order start­ing at 2 a.m., so that late-night visitors to Beckers have more options "than just pizza and shakes," Miller said.

Storm Gustav may cause evacuation 
NEW ORLEANS -On the eve of Hurricane Katrina's third anniversary, a nervous New Orleans watched Wednesday as another storm threatened to test everything the city has rebuilt, and officials made preliminary plans to evaeuate people, pets and hospitals in an attempt to avoid a Katrina-style chaos. 
Forecasters warned that Gustav could grow into a dangerous Category 3 hurricane in the next several days and hit somewhere along a swath of the Gulf Coast from the Florida Panhandle to Texas -with New Orleans smack in the middle.

Biden accepts VP nomination 
Senator says nation needs 'more than agood soldier;' Obarna joins running nu1te on stage 
Associated Press 

DENVER -Joe Eiden accepted the Democratic vice presidential nomination Wednesday night and declared that the challenges America faees require "more than a good soldier" in the White House, hailing Barack Obama as a wise leader who can deliver the change the nation needs. 
In a single sentence, Obama's new running mate complimented John McCain's years of military service and slapped his claim on the White I louse. 
As Biden concluded his speech accepting the nomi­nation, Obama stepped on stage and embraced his man to a convention roar. 
"I want everybody to now understand why I am so proud to have Joe Biden ... and the whole Eiden fami­ly," Obama told the boister­ous crowd. "I think he's pre­sented himself pretty well so far, what do you think?" More cheers. 
In his speech, Biden also sniped at Vice President Diek Cheney, saying that after he takes over the job, for Americans trying to do the right thing and honor the Constitution, "no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the English lan­guage be 'The vice presi­dent's office is on the Eiden was unanimously in Georgia, Iraq, Pakistan after he managed only 1 phone."' chosen to be his running and Afghanistan, and I can percent of the vote in Iowa's

W. Iraq needs fewer troops 
United States to yield responsibilityfor Sunni stronghold within days 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-Conditions in the western Iraqi province of Anbar. where a brutal insurgency once ruled, have improved so dramatically that the United States is handing over responsibility for securi­ty in the Sunni stronghold to Iraq within days. Troops freed up in Iraq could shift to Afghan is tan. 
"There arnn't a whole heck of a lot of bad guys there lel't to fight." Gen. James T. Conway, the top Marine Corps general, said Wednesday. 
A ceremony marking the Anbar turnover is expected to he held Monday, several U.S. and Iraqi officials said. Each spoke 011 condition of anonymity because the Iraqi government has not yet announced it. Anbar would be the I Oth of Iraq's 18 provinces to be returned to Iraqi governnwnt control, a step toward phasing out the American combat role as Iraqi security forces grow morn competent. 
The dnvelopmm1ts in Anbar have additional resonance becausn the province once was synonymous with the worst violenc1~ and lawless­ness unleashed in Iraq follow­ing the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. . 
The turnaround in Anbar is all the more dramatic for what it might mean for Afghanistan, the fight that has in some ways supplanted Iraq as a front-line battleground. The diverging trends make it likely that a U.S. buildup in Afghanistan will follow a drawdown in Iraq. 
Conway said he learned on a visit to Anbar this summer that violence remains low and the 25,000 Marines there are doing more rebuilding than fighting. 
"Quite frankly, young Marines join our Corps to go fight for their country," Conway said. "They are doing a very good job of this nation­building business (in Iraq). But it's our view that if there is a stiffer !'ight going some­place else ... then that's where Wll need to be." 
That place might be Afghanistan, he said.

llolding a news conference on the fringe of thn ~~onvention arena, Homney cited Obama votns on taxes and proposals for government spending. And he took not11 of the Illinois sena­tor's comment earlier this year in debate that he would negoti­ate with leaders of rogue nations. 
Summing up his pitch, Homney questioned the Democrat's judgment, saying: "Barack Obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but he's not ready to be presicllmt." 
McCain's campaign dis­patched Homney, who is lwlinved to be a top contender for tho vice presidential spot on the ticket, spedlieally to assail Obama. Another Hnpubliean said to bn in serious contnntion for thn No. 2 slot. Minnesota

For now at least, McCain's campaign is mum on the delib­erations. Uncharacteristically, so, too, is the candidate himself. 
And, McCain's prospective candidates are dodging ques­tions about the process to avoid violating McCain's demand for secrecy around his search. But the appearances by Homney and Pawlenty in Denver are certain to stoke speculation and invite questions. 
"I don't have anything to tell you about Senator McCain's vice presidential selection process," Homney said repeat­edly when asked about his prospects on Tuesday. 
Likely by design so top McCain aides could gauge their efl'ectiveness, both Homney and Pawlenty have emerged as top surrogates for McCain over the past few months as he has weighed his choice. 
Homney, a former McCain rival. would bring economic credentials and a battle-honed pitch from the rough-and-tum­ble GOP primary to the team, while Pawlenty, a longtime McCain ally, would bring a solid conservative resume and blue­collar roots. 
But both men also present drawbacks for the GOP ticket. 

posed cutbacks to his superi­ors, but Conway declined to give specifics, saying only that the current number of Marines there is excessive. 
The remarks by Conway, who is responsible for Marines' recruiting, training and equipping but not their use in combat, are an addi­tional sign of the likelihood that Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, will recommend soon that troop withdrawals resume this fall. Petraeus has been assessing the overall seeurity situation in light of the with­drawal of five Army combat brigades earlier this year. 
There now are about 146,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and 33,000 in Afghanistan, according to Pentagon fig­ures. 
The Petraeus recommenda­tion, which is expected to be accepted by President Bush, is important not only for its implications in Iraq and for its potential impact on the presi­dential contenders' debate over Iraq but also for its con­nection to what U.S. com­manders call an urgent need for more troops in Afghanistan -perhaps as many as 10,000 more.

IN BRIEF 
U.S. thrifts suffer record losses 
WASHINGTON -Federal regulators say 
U.S. thrifts lost $5.4 billion in the second quarter and set aside a record amount to cover losses from bad mortgages and other loans. 
Data from the U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision show federally-insured savings and loan institutions posted their second­largest quarterly loss ever in the April-June period, after the $8.8 billion loss in the fourth quarter of last year. Heavily focused on mortgage lending, thrifts have been stung by mounting home-loan defaults. 
The $5.4 billion quarterly loss compared with net profits of $3.8 billion in the year­ago period, and a loss of $627 million in the first quarter. 
Russia may cut poultry, pork imports 
MOSCOW -Russia could cut poultry and pork import quotas by hundreds of thou­sands of tons, the country's agriculture minister said Wednesday. The move could hit American producers hard and comes amid heightened tensions between Moscow and Washington over the war in ex-Soviet Georgia. 
"It is time to change the quota regime and reduce imports, which have unfortu­nately built up in recent years," Alexei Gordeyev told reporters, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. 
He said domestic producers could make up the shortfall if imports were reduced. 
Any substantial cuts would likely have a significant impact on U.S. poultry produc­ers, for whom Russia is the biggest mar­ket. Russians sometimes refer to U.S. poul­try imports as "Bush's legs," a reference to the frozen chicken shipped to Russia amid economic troubles following the 1991 Soviet collapse, when the current U.S. president's father was in office. 
Mich. incomes fall, poverty rises 
Data points to auto industry's downward plunge in state's declining economy 
Associated Press 

TRAVERSE CITY Government data painted a bleak economic picture for Michigan, where the auto industry's downward plunge has rippled across the state. 
Michigan was the only state where poverty rose last year, as well as the only one where incomes fell, according to U.S. Census Bureau statistics released Tuesday that illustrate the uniqueness of the state's economic swoon. 
"It's really a depressing picture," said Amy Rynell, director of the Heartland Alliance Mid-America Institute on Poverty, an advocacy group based in Chicago. 
Michigan's poverty rate was 14 percent, up from 
13.5 percent in 2006 and more than a full percentage point above the national rate, which was virtually unchanged during the same period. The state's rate has grown steadily since 2000, when it was just above 10 percent. The number of people in poverty increased by 45,000 during 2006-07. 
The 2007 median income in Michigan was $47,950, down 1.2 percent or $596 from the 2006 median of $48,546.

All right everybody. As this is the beginning of another fantastic, and hopefully fantastically controversial, new year in Viewpoint, I thought it might be beneficial to talk about the 
state of the Viewpoint section. I do this only to throw fodder into the fire and get an early start on the year. 
Of course, most of these topics have 


been trampled on pretty seriously in  Jason Coleman  
the past, but here  
at Notre Dame they always seem open  Man at Large  

to new and passionate discussion. This 
also serves to warn the freshmen and prep them for the serious debates splayed across these pages. 
Let's start with the obvious elephant in the room: the Vagina Monologues. Since this Eve Ensler production was first put on by Notre Dame students a few years ago, it has managed to play on campus, then get kicked off campus, then get back on campus. And we have heard about it all in hundreds of let­ters. It has drawn criticism from Archbishops, alumni and students on both sides of the issue; last year the convention of bishops was moved from Notre Dame because of it. There has been no lack of controversy. However, from those emphasizing the play's importance in sexual abuse awareness to those writing it off as sexually promiscuous trash, the letters have never ceased to amuse the other 95 percent of the student body who remained fairly uninterested in the whole thing. Not to make light of the subject, it just seemed that no common ground was ever found between writ­ers, and, to be honest, I predict yet another rehash early next spring. 
Let's move on to a similar set of gen­der issues, the ones involving Notre Dame's friendly neighbors to the West, St. Mary's. Generally, this debate is pretty formulaic. It begins when one of The Observer comic strips takes some exaggerated and stereotypical jab at the St. Mary's student body. These claims are usually one of two tasty fla­vors. The first, of course, is that they are some seriously promiscuous girls. The second, that they can't add two and two together (or that a St. Mary's lit final is based on a combination of Dr. Seuss and Beverly Cleary novels). I expect these to be slightly less heated this year, with only one comic strip, rather than three, to spark these let­ters. These debates are generally sort of boring anyways. The first letter lam­bastes the comic strip for the dig; the responses are usually just to "lighten up". Snore. Besides, we all know what the difference between your sister and the St. Mary's shuttle is. 
Continuing, we come across (sur­prise, surprise) another gender issue at Notre Dame. This one involves our beloved Victory March and the fact that it only mentions loyal sons, leaving out our loyal daughters. This one is usually thrown out there by female alums or parents who feel offended that the boys are getting all of the love. Not to sound sexist, but I want to put an end to this one right now. First, the song was writ­ten before girls were even admitted to this school, so its not as if they were deliberately shafted out of the song. Secondly, have you ever tried to add "loyal sons and daughters" into the fight song. The timing is completely off and the entire song suffers for it. If we change it now, "Hail to the Victors" has already won. 
These issues have been the meat of the Viewpoint section over the last cou­ple of years; however, they have never been the most interesting. If you want your letter to make it to the paper, you only have to make it controversial enough to draw fire. At this school, 
that isn't too diflicult. 
Last year, there was the kid who sug­gested parietals were already too late and should be moved down to 10 p.m. You can imagine the backlash. Business majors who never had thought of putting down their Natty to pen a Letter to the Editor were polish­ing off their long forgotten skills to unleash a deluge of criticism on this guy. His complete insensitivity to the rest of the male population's hopes and dreams of making a successful play on a girl was appalling. The suggestion did, however, result in a few days of pretty funny discussion. 
However, while these letters are amusing and some of the debates (still) controversial, I want urge the student body to take the great opportunity this year provides (there is an election, if you haven't heard) and write a couple of thoughtful, evidenced and well con­structed letters on the major issues out there: health care, the federal deficit, off shore drilling, the merits-of experi­ence vs. youth, etc. 
While this trek down memory lane was fun for some, and probably brought up old arguments for others, it should stay at that. These discussions have been had and the arguments have been made. As to the damage done, I'm not sure anybody new is going to be convinced at this point, so it would be better for us, as a student body, to move on to newer, fresher and perhaps more challenging and nuanced issues. I hope to do the same in my future columns. And of course, I will always accept e-mails from readers who dis­agree.

Dis-orientation daze 
As an 8th-grader at St. Pius X Elementary, I possessed all the absurd bravado of a member of the oldest class in the school. Bragging -about parents' occupation, purported 
wealth, girlfriends  
-was the curren- Fr. Lou Delfra  
cy of the 8th-grade  
corner of the  
recess yard.  Faithpoint  
Though, of course,  
being 8th graders,  

we weren't relegated to a corner, we chose to be there. We could go wher­ever we darn well liked -unless Sr. Clare said otherwise, though we also (quietly) bragged that our elder status made even Sr. Clare tentative to call us out. Like I said, it was an absurd bravado. 
Starting around October, the recess­yard smack talk was predictably inter­jected with one-upsmanship about where we would attend high school. It was cool to be going to Cardinal O'Hara, but totally out to go to Monsignor Bonner. But nowhere was cooler than Malvern Prep -you even had to take a test to get in there. (Why this made it cool is no longer apparent to me). Mid-October, my best friend Terry Redican and I made it widely known at recess that we would not be at school tomorrow, as we would be visiting Malvern. 
That morning, I strutted out of my bedroom. I strutted out the front door. I strutted down the driveway to the bus stop. I had the grades, I had the extracurriculars, I had the faith -I was on the high school bus to visit Malvern. I was too darn cool. 
Then the bus dropped us off at Malvern. The football team, ranked No.1 in the city, had a before-school practice and the offensive line almost ran me over as they herded by the bus stop. Their cleats on the driveway sounded like the Orcs marching on Gondor, and I almost puked. My stellar performance in the spelling bee, 8th­grade tennis title and everything else I had accomplished went out the win­dow, as these behemoths trampled by. Suddenly, the only autobiographical information I could remember was that I was 5'4" and 85 pounds, which I suddenly recalled put me squarely in the 17th percentile ... This didn't feel right. 
My freshman escort ushered me to a seat in the freshman biology class. Moments after Mr. Riviello had started a lesson on taxonomy -the first word in a couple years I didn't comprehend (I had won the spelling bee, did I men­tion that?) -I realized that I really needed to go the bathroom. But no way the 8th-grade visitor was raising his hand to stop a science class that was taking on taxes -this was heady, high-level stuff. I held it. For as long as I could. Finally, nearing emergency status, I ran for the door and made it to the hallway. Looking frantically for the men's room, I could only find a door marked "Restroom." Was it guys or girls? I very uncomfortably paced the halls until class let out. I ran to my freshman escort and breathlessly blurted, "Is that a guys' room or girls' room?" He looked at me like I was ... well, a 5'4", 85-pound grade-schooler, as he reminded me, "This is an all-guys' school." 
I made a resolution right then that I would never attend Malvern Prep. This decision had nothing to do with the match between Malvern and my gifts, or whether God was "calling" me there, as Sr. Clare liked to frame it. It had everyth~ng to do with the fact that Malvern, that first day, made me feel the opposite of what I felt at my 8th­grade recess yard. And the fact that I couldn't find the bathrooms. 
Many of our poignant (i.e. -humili­ating) childhood experiences can be quite instructive. I often recall this memory anytime I am preparing to begin something new, and feel the inevitable butterflies in my stomach. It makes me remember that, when God invites us into something new (in the end, Sr. Clare's framework of vocation and discernment was utterly accu­rate), our initial response is often not one of total acceptance and embrace. Rather, it is some confusion at the unfamiliarity, and a resultant hesitan­cy. Days that many like to call "Orientation" are often, internally for those going through them, days of rad­ical "Dis-orientation." Less days of "Vocation" than days of "Equi­Vocation." And one natural reaction to such feelings is: get me back to the 8th-grade recess yard, where I know the terrain, know the people, and know which gender the bathrooms are for. 
I like to pray to St. Peter on days of starting something new. He plunged into new opportlmities with all the unbridled enthusiasm of a cocky ado­lescent. "Lord, if that is you, tell me to get out of the boat and walk on the water!" Followed immediately by a sudden realization that he is now doing something in a way and a place unfamiliar to him. And in this moment of Dis-orientation, he fills with fear, panic, and inevitably, begins to sink. "Lord, save me!" Followed by one of the most consoling lines in all of the Gospels: "Jesus immediately stretched out his hand and took hold of him." Peter would grow, and regain his con­fidence, but it took some time. And Jesus patiently led him through his fears into a life of freedom and joy, so effectively that Peter --prone to fear and equivocation -is ultimately freed to become a great leader in the faith, and even to give his life away. 
Where is Jesus leading us during these days of dis-orientation? If we allow him, as Peter eventually did, surely He is leading w; to greater free­dom and joy, a life of robust magnifi­cation of our gifts4 including ones now unknown to us, and a life of more gen­erous service to others. Do we have Peter's patience and resolve to let Him? 
Oh, I graduated from Malvern in '88, and was off to Notre Dame. I remem­ber I felt so cool ...

This summer was an epic one for the average indie rock­er. Besides the monolith releases by Death Cab for Cutie and Coldplay, new artists bounded onto the scene with full foree, including new ehic rocker Katy Perry and uber­indie duo She and llim. Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette made a respectable comeback, and The Duke Spirit revived the spirit of Stevie Nieks. 
"Narrow Stairs" didn't fail to impress, as Death Cab fulfilled all expectations and even man­aged to follow the same gener­al layout of their last album, 2005's "Plans." The radio mainstay "I Will Possess Your I Ieart" is the dear eenterpiece of the album, coming in at track two but setting the tone for the rest of the songs.

"Viva La Vida," with its revolutionary aesthetic embodied in the hijacked eover art, is clearly a collection, with the first and last traek acting as bookends. Hadio singles "Violet Hill" and "Viva La Vida" are quite good, alone or within the context of the album. Overall, Coldplay manages to stay atop their game, avoiding repetition or the near­inevitable sell out at this point in their career. 
Alanis Morissette rocked it out again with "Flavors of Entanglement." She airs all her dirty laundry with the same lyrical vivadty of "Jagged Little Pill," but still manages to sound more mature and grounded in her sound, which gets the expected over-produc­tion pick-up of someone who

San Diego Chargers linebacker Shawne Merriman awaits the snap during a 2007 NFL pre-season football game against the San Francisco 49ers In San Diego. 
MerriiDan to play with knee injury 
Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO -The sur­geon's knife can wait. Shawne Merriman is going to play football, two torn knee ligaments and all. 
A day after visiting a fourth doctor, the San Diego Chargers' star out­side linebacker decided Wednesday to play this season rather than have his damaged left knee repairnd now. 
"To be as simple as pos­sible, I just want to play football," Merriman said. "That's what it comes down to. I know what's on the table, I know what's on the line. I put a lot of work in this and I want to play." 
Merriman said late last week that he has tears in both the posterior cruci­ate and lateral collateral ligaments in his left knee, which he hurt in a game at Tennessee in December. He spent sev­eral days seeking outside opinions. He returned Tuesday after seeing a doctor in Miami. 
Merriman said all four doctors he saw said he needed surgery, but there "just wasn't a time frame on that. My knee still looks pretty good. The deeision was left up to me to play. If you give a foot­ball player a decision to 
IN BRIEF Harvey signs contract after 
long holdout with Jaguars 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. Defensive end Derrick Harvey ended a 33-day holdout Wednesday by signing a five-year, $23.8 million contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars. 
Harvey was the last first-round draft piek to sign, a lengthy hold­out that frustrated coach Jack De I Rio and left the former Florida standout behind in prepa­ration for the regular season. 
The eighth overall selection in April, Harvey was expected to bolster a pass rush that struggled to pressure quarterbacks last season. But he missed all of training camp and the first three preseason games. 
It was unclear whether Harvey would play in the preseason finale Thursday ' night at Washington. He did travel with the team to Washington, D.C. 
play, you know, I'm going to play." 
When he does have sur­gery, he'll be looking at a rehab of six to seven months. 
'Til have the surgery at any point," he said. "Nobody knows. I kind of Jell it on the table when to have it. Not even doctors can tell me that." 
While denying reports the situation could be career-threatening, hn pledged to be "the same old Shawne Merriman. That's what I'm hoping." 
With his nonstop energy and spasmod ie sa(~k dance, the player known as "Lights Out" has been the face of the Chargers' defense the past three seasons. He has 39 1/2 sacks in that span, more than any other NFL play­er. lie's played in three straight Pro Bowls. 
Hight or wrong, Merriman's deeision was big for a team that has Super Bowl expectations. 
Star running back Lai>ainian Tomlinson, knocked out of last sea­son's AFC championship game aft!w aggravating a knnn injury, was happy to hear Merriman will play. 
"llow do you tell a war­rior to sit down'! That's what he is, a warrior. lie's trained for this. It's hard to tell a guy to sit down," Tomlinson said. 

Alvarez refuses to sign 
contract with Pirates 
PITTSBURG -No. 2 draft pick Pedro Alvarez refused to sign his contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates, and the players' associa­tion filed a grievance Wednesday claiming the Aug. 15 deadline was unilaterally extended by Major League Baseball without the union's permission. 
The Pirates announced early on Aug. 16 that Alvarez, a power-hit­ting third baseman from Vanderbilt, agreed to a minor league contract with a $6 million signing bonus. The Pirates said his agent, Scott Boras, told the team Alvarez would not report unless the deal was renegotiated. Boras elaimed the agreement was reached after the midnight dead­line for draft picks to sign on Aug. 15. 
Alvarez was placed on baseball's restricted list. 
Kotsay leaves Atlanta for 
Boston 
NEW YORK -The Boston Hed Sox acquired Mark Kotsay from Atlanta for a minor leaguer Wednesday, adding depth to their outfield one day after J.D. Drew went on the disabled list. 
Kotsay hit .289 with six home runs and 37 RBis in 88 games with the Braves. He arrived at Yankee Stadium on Wednesday before Boston's game against New York and was available ofT" the beneh. 
"I figured once I deared waivers and there wasn't really any action that I'd fini'>h out the season in Atlanta," Kot'>ay told a pool reporter. "But this obviously is exciting to eome to a dub that's in the playoiT race, and especially one like Boston that has the history of a gn~at tradition." 
Kotsay's only postseason experience came in 2006 with Oakland. The Bed Sox lead the AL wild-card raee and began the day 31/2 games behind first­place Tampa Bay in the AL East.

Associated Press 
Oscar De La Hoya has nearly wrapped up a deal to finish his boxing career Dec. 6 against Filipino star Manny Pacquiao, two people with knowledge of the negotiations told The Associated Press on Wednesday. 
The people, who spoke on con­dition of anonymity because any deal will not be announced until today, said De La Hoya's long­stalled talks with Pacquiao recently revived when the sides found an acceptable way to split the possible $100 million in rev­enue from what's certain to be boxing's most lucrative fight since De La .Hoya's split-decision loss to Floyd Mayweather Jr. last year. 
Barring any last-minute changes of heart in a sometimes contentious negotiation, the fight will bring together boxing's most bankable star and arguably its most talented fighter at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The deal was first reported by ESPN.com. 

It has not been an easy match to make. Both boxers must make physical sacrifices for the 147­pound bout, with De La Hoya dropping down to welterweight for the first time in nearly eight years while Pacquiao bulks up to 
the heaviest weight of his career by far. · 
The fighters' camps also argued over the split of the purse, with De La Hoya angling for 70 percent while Pacquiao pursued a 40 percent cut. The resolution to this impasse was not immedi­ately clear, but should be announced Thursday.

Phillips and Stremick were both second-team all-Big East players last year with impressivn pnrf'ormances for the Irish. Brown attributes thnir success last year to tlwir ability to control the not both on ol'fnnsn and dnfense. 
"Both hit a high percentage as wnll as have high kills, and tlwy arn also very good blockers," Brown said. ".Justine IStremickl is orw of' th11 bnst blockers that we have over had in the pro­gram. Snrinity [l'hillipsl is usually on the outside and shn is one of' tlw best we have nvnr had out thorn as well." 
But Brown has even higher n x p 1H: t a ti on s for them this

"Those are the strengths and nurnbnrs that allowed thorn to bn able to be recog­nizml as all-conference play­Prs. and I lwlinvo thny are capable of' doing much morn this year and I'm nxcited about that," Brown said. 
Phillips and StrPmiek are both taking a tnarn approach to the year, focusing on what the whole team can takn away f'rorn last ynar and irn prove upon. 
"J.ast year definitely wasn't our best season." Strnmick said. "In gmwral. our season could have !wen better. We lost sonw games we should have won." 
The tnarn lwlinves the turn­around has already begun in tho prPseason with hard work during practice f'rorn nveryonn. 
"We had a great preseason and we are looking to improve," sophomore middle blocker Kelli Seiacca said. "Everything is falling into place. We have a go-get-'em philosophy and we have made great strides in the preseason." 
The team was unhappy with last year's results and plans to bounce back. 
"I think I can speak for the entire team when I say we weren't pleased with how last season turned out, but we're ready come back," junior middle blocker Tara Enzweiler said. 
"We look fantastic," Phillips said. "We are gelling great and our entire starting lineup is playing every position very well." 
Adding to the mix are con­tributions from all areas of the team, including a promis­ing freshmen foursome. 
"We nxpeet a lot out of the

"They bring  us  a  lot  more

Dealy is making surprising contributions f'or a f'irst-year player and Brown believes she is playing above her years. 
"Kristen is a great all­around player. She's a good seornr, passer, and defensive player." Brown said. "She understands the game very well." 
Adding versatility away from thn net is Silva, who plays both the libero and defensive specialist positions. 
"ISilval is a defensive spe­cialist." Brown said. "She is ineredibly quick and has great overall skills." 
Hounding out the freshmen is Wildermuth. who gives the team the flexibility to alter their formations and improve their match-ups.

The combination of experi­ence, depth, and youth is what the Irish intend to uti­lize to reestablish themselves as a Big East power this year.

MLB 
Red Sox demolish Yankees 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Jason Bay 
drove in four runs, Dustin 
Pedroia hit a grand slam and 
the Boston Red Sox routed the 
listless Yankees 11-3 on 
Wednesday night, putting an 
emphatic dent in New York's 
dwindling playoff' chances. 
Paul Byrd beat the Yankees 
in a crucial game for the sec­
ond consecutive year, and 
David Ortiz reached base four 
times for the second straight 
night. 
Pedroia's first career slam 
capped a seven-run eighth 
inning and sent hordes of boo­
ing Yankees fans shuffling 
toward the exits. With co­
chairman Hank Steinbrenner 
in attendance, New York 
dropped seven games behind 
Boston, which leads the AL 
wild-card race by 2 1/2 games 
over Minnesota. 
The Heel Sox remained 3 1/2 games behind first-place Tampa Bay in the AL East. 
In a game they needed badly, the injury-depleted Yankees gave the ball to Sidney Ponson (7-5). IIe lasted 4 2-3 innings and dropped to 3-13 with a 
6.95 ERA in 22 starts against the Heel Sox. 
Boston will try for a three­game sweep Thursday with lefty Jon Lester on the mound against 16-game winner Mike Mussina. 
Byrd (9-11) stymied New York's struggling hitters with floaters and soft stuff, just as he did last October when the right-hander won at Yankee Stadium to clinch a first-round playoff series for Cleveland. 
Still using his old-fashioned windup, Byrd allowed two runs and five hits in six innings. He struck out five and improved to 2-1 in three starts since Boston acquired him from the Indians this month. 
Byrd has won six of his last seven starts following a five­game losing streak. 
Also a Red Sox newcomer, Bay hit a two-run double in the first and an RBI triple in the eighth when Boston battered relievers Jose Veras and David Robertson. 
Bay has six RBis in his first two games playing in the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry. 
Pedroia, last season's AL Rookie of the Year, hit a shot off Hobertson that landed on the netting above New York's retired numbers in left-center. In the Boston bullpen, star closer .Jonathan Papelbon spread his arms with delight. 
The Red Sox jumped ahead in the first. Pedroia singled and went to third on Ortiz's double. Ponson whiffed Kevin Youkilis for the second out, but Bay hit a sinking liner toward the gap that dropped just in front of diving left fielder Xavier Nady for a two-run double. 
Bay tried to score on Jason 
Varitek's single and was eut 
down on a strong throw by 
right lieldcr Bobby Abreu. 
Alex Hodriguez's two-out 
double in the bottom half 
scored Abreu from first, and 
New York tied it in the fourth. 
A-Rod led ofT with another 
double and scored on Robinson 
Cano's two-out HBl single ofT 
the glove of a diving Pndroia at 
second base. 
With runners at the corners, 
Byrd retired No. 9 batter Ivan 
Hodriguez on a !1y ball. 
Ponson settled in until 
Pedroia's perfect hit-and-run 
single put runners at the cor­
ners in the fifth. Consecutive 
walks to Ortiz and Youkilis 
forced in the go-ahead run 
before Bay's sacrifice !1y made 
it 4-2 and chased Ponson. who 
is 0-3 in his past four starts. 
Mets 6, Phillies 3 
PliiLADELPIIIA -This resilient group surfl isn't last year's New York Mcts. 
Daniel Murphy hit a tiebreaking double after Carlos Delgado's second solo homer had tied the game in the eighth and the Mets beat Philadelphia on Wednesday night to reclaim first place in the NL East. 
Ryan Howard hit a two-run homer and Jayson Werth homered for the Phillies, who fell a half-game behind the Mets in the division. 
New York rebounded from Tuesday night's tough loss in which the Phillies overcame a 7-0 deficit and won 8-7 in 13 innings. 
"This was a huge, huge win for us simply because of the way we lost last night," Mcts manager Jerry Manuel said. "We could've afforded to (lose), but the way we lost last night, you never know where that's going to lead you." 
The Mets blew a seven-game lead with 17 remaining last season, losing the division to the Phillies on the final day. They're determined to avoid another collapse, though they don't have quite the same cushion. 
One night after New York's bullpen blew a ninth-inning lead for the 1Oth time this sea­son, the Phillies couldn't pro­teet a one-run lead in the eighth. 
Rudy Seanez (5-4). getting a rare opportunity as a setup man because four other reliev­ers were unavailablfl, retired the first two batters before Delgado hit an opposite-field shot to left to tie it at 3. 
Seanez left after Carlos Beitran reached on an infield single. 
Brad Lidgc, who is 31-for-31 in save chances, came in and intentionally walked Hyan Church after Beltran stole sec­ond. 
Murphy, a rookie who spent most of the season at Double-A 
Binghamton, then ripped a 

double to right to score Beltran 
for a 4-3 lead, snapping an 0­
for-16 slump. Brian Schneider 
followed with a bloop single 
down the left-field line that 
drove in two runs. 
Murphy was in llawaii 

preparing to play winter ball 
last Sept~mbnr when tho Mets 
crumbled, but ho paid closn 
attention to thn race. 
"It was kind of' helpless," he 

said. "You always want to see 
the big league team do well." 
Brian Stokes (1-0) pitl:hed a 

scoreless inning for his first 
win with tho Mots. Pedro 
Feliciano and .Joe Smith 
worked the eighth and Luis 
Ayala finished for his second 
save in throe trios. Ayala 
couldn't hold a one-run load 
with two outs in tho ninth 
Tuesday. 
Nnw York's Johan Santana 

had nothing to show f'or anoth­
er quality start. lie gave up 
three runs and live hits in six 
innings, striking out six. It was 
the 13th time Santana gave up 
three earned runs or fewer 
and didn't get a win. The two­
time AL Cy Young award win­
ner has a 2. 70 EHA, second­
best in the NL. 
"These guys battled," Santana said. "It was a team effort. It's not about one guy or one pitcher. We did a great job." 
No matter how much the Mets stress this is a different season, people won't let them forget about the historic col­lapse last year. 
A sellout crowd of 45,138 at Citizens Bank Park jumped on the Mets right from the start. One fan held up a sign that read: "Hemember September!" Another sitting behind the visi­tor's dugout yelled at players and continuously flashed a choke sign to anyone who looked his way. 
Onee New York rallied in the eighth, it was the Mets fans making all the noise. 
"We're fighting some demons. the demons of the past, the rascals that have hung around us for a year," Manuel said. "Every time we lose a game likH last night is a reminder of that." 
The teams meet for a three­game series at Shea Stadium next weekend that will eon­elude a 1 0-gamc road trip for the Phillics. Tho Mets lead the series 10-5 this season. 
Phillies startnr Kyle Kendrick allowed two runs and eight hits in five-plus innings. 
The 24-year-old right-hander has rebounded nicely from conseeutivo poor starts in which he allowed 13 runs in seven innings. lin's given up throe runs in 10 2-3 innings in his last two starts. 
"''m disappointed I didn't go deeper in this game," Kendrick said. "It's frustrating. We had a win right there."

MEN'S GOLF 
Irish golfer falls in first round of U.S. Amateur 
By MICHAEL BLASCO 
Sports Writer 
After one of the finest sum­mer campaigns in Notre Dame golf history, Carlos Santos­Ocampo returned to South Bend on a bittersweet note. The junior from Naples, Fla., became the first Irish golfer in three decades to reach match play at the U.S. Amateur, but fell in the opening round to Jeff Edelman of Southlake, Texas on August 20. 
No. 56 seed Santos-Ocampo lost 5-3 to No. 9 seed Edelman at the par-70, 7,232-yard Pinehurst Hesort No. 2 Course in Pinehurst, N.C. Arter Santos­Ocampo birdied the par-4 first hole to take an early lead, Edelman drew even on the par­4 third with a birdie of his own, and took the lead after Santos­Ocampo bogeyed the fourth. Edelman's double-bogey on the fifth tied the match up, but he responded by winning the next three holes to bring the score to 5-2. Santos-Ocampo added a winning par on the 15th, but was unable to close the gap fur­ther. 
Santos-Ocampo qualified for the U.S. Amateur, considered the most prestigious amateur tournament in the country, with a victory at the Notre Dame Sectional Aug. 1 at the Warren Golf Course in South Bend. Santos-Ocampo shot a four­under par 136 to share medal­ist honors and gain the chance to compete in the U.S. Amateur. He is the seventh Notre Dame golfer in five years to earn that distinction. 
After earning the No. 56 seed, Santos-Ocampo fired a 4-over 144 in 36 holes at Pinehurst on Aug. 19, good for a tie for 47th place and making the cut for the 64-man match play field. Santos-Ocampo birdied the 36th hole to boost him one stroke above the cut line (+5); this proved to be extremely for­tunate as the 26 players who finished +5 over 36 holes were forced to engage in a playoff for the final two match play spots. 
"Making it to match play was a thrill," Santos-Ocampo said. "The last six holes of stroke play was the highlight, when my putter, all of a sudden, just got hot as I one-putted the last six holes." 
Besides becoming the first Irish golfer since 1973 to reach match play at the U.S. Amateur (the year the current format was adopted), Santos-Ocampo made the cut at three other top amateur tournaments during the summer -the Florida State Amateur, the Eastern Amateur, and the Southern Amateur. l-Ie also won the Tournament Players Association at Windstar in Naples, Fla., his hometown. Santos-Ocampo cites a focus on fundamentals for his recent success. 
''I'm happy to see that my game is headed the right direc­tion," Santos-Ocampo said. "The areas that have improved the most in my game are my driving and my putting. On the driver, I have added twenty yards over the past six months, and I have been able to keep it more consistently in the short grass. This has allowed me to score better in the big tourna­ments where courses are con­siderably longer and the rough is higher. Improving the fun­damentals in my putting stroke has made it a lot easier to make putts on a consistent basis, especially when the pressure was on." 
Although he was born in Rhode Island, Santos-Ocampo grew up in the Philippines, where he picked up golf at age six. He was drawn to Notre Dame after an unofficial visit during which coach Jim Kubinski emphasized the unique spirit of Notre Dame. 
Santos-Ocampo is confident that his summer successes will translate to victory this fall. 
"Being able to see the fruits of your labor pay off," Santos­Ocampo said. "Good scores in a tournament atmosphere obvi­ously will boost your confi­dence. I'm going to take that with me heading into our fall season knowing that my hard work all year truly is translat­ing to improved scores. I'm also very optimistic about our team this year. A lot of our under­classmen, including myself, gained valuable experience from last year." 
Santos-Ocampo returns to the links next weekend at the USF Olympic Club Intercollegiate with his fellow Irish golfers on Sept. 8 at the Olympic Club in Daly City, Calif., just outside San Francisco.

Centerfielder Pollock nan1ed MVP of Cape Cod League 
By FRAN TOLAN Associate Sports Editor 

What do Thurman Munson, Paul O'Neill, Evan Longoria and A . .l. Pollock havn in common? Arter the Notre Dame junior centerfielder's stellar summer season, the corn~ct answer is that all of them have been namf~d Most Valuable Player of the Cape Cod League.

Crist says he puts the team's needs first 
By BILL BRINK Spons Editor 

l>ay1w Crist looked comfort­able even though he had to eollapsn his 6-foot-4 frame into a folding sPat. The fresh­man quarterback relaxed, with a charming smile and a buzz cut -a freshmen unity initiative, courtesy of the run­ning backs -while answering questions about everything from learning a pro-style offense to his mothnr to whether, as a California boy, he had bought a winter coat yet. 
lie was unfazed and careful. Thn phrase, "Whatever coach Weis wants me to do ... " came out of his mouth more than once, and he talked rnpeatedly about the healthy competition
-
between the quarterbacks. His relationship with sophomore quarterback Jimmy Clausen, who he went to middle school with and who helped lure Crist 
said. "To be mentioned with those guys is just incredi­ble." 
Every summer, the Cape Cod League draws most of the best eollege players in the country to New England. But the top-tier competition was no match for Pollock, who starred for the Falmouth Commodores. The Hebron, Conn., native fin­ished second in the batting race with a .377 average while leading the league in hits {61), doubles {15) and slugging percentage (.556). 

Pollock, who played third base as a Notre Dame fresh­man before switching to cen­terfield last season, commit­ted just one error in 45 games. 
"Before the summer, every­one from my town told me how great the Cape Cod League was," Pollock said. "I just tried to take the same approach I always do and fortunately it worked out for me." 
Despite the tremendous 
honor, Pollock said he will work hard to keep improving so that he does not end up being defined by just this award. 
"At one point, it's pretty incredible and it's a thrill," Pollock said. "But at the same time, I'm sure there are a lot of guys on that list [of past MVPsl that you've never heard of." 
Pollock said he also under­stands that aceolades like the one he earned this sum­mer come with added pres-
The future 
to Notre Dame, drew a good deal of attention. lie addressed it, as he did every­thing else, calmly, at once seeming innocent and mature. 
"We're both very competitive people. We both learn from eaeh other," Crist said of Clausen during freshmen media day on Aug. 22. "Even the time we've spent here, it seems like il's only been a matter of months, but we've learned from each other greatly." 
Crist was a top recruit from Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, Calif. Hivals.com ranked him as the No. 25 prospect in the nation after he completed 58 percent of his passes for 2,178 yards and 16 touchdowns in his sen­ior season. Early speculation is that he will redshirt, which would give him two years to start after Clausen graduates. 
lie said the toughest aspect of fall practice so far has been learning Notre Dame's offen­sive system. It frustrated him at first, but he said he has a better grasp of it now.

Irish prilned to bounce back from subpar year 
By JARED JEDICK 

Sports Writer 
Notre Dame is looking to eome on strong and forget about a disappointing season last year with the help of two of the Big East's strongest playnrs, senior middle block­er Justine Stremiek and jun­ior outsidP hittPr SPrinity Phillips.
 
"Both of them had great competitive seasons in the Big East last year," Irish coad1 Debbie Brown said. "Their stnmgths are in· the front row where they are tremendous hitters and blockers." 
As a result of their accom­plishments last year, both were voted to the Big East's preseason team. 
"I was surprised and very excited." Phillips said. "It was a great compliment and I am going to just keep work­ing along with the team to do our best." 
Stremick also appreeiated the honor, but said she would have preferred some hard­ware for the entire team. 
"It was a surprise, but it's nice to bf~ honored for the hard work in the last eouple years," Stremick said. "It is always nice to be honored,

"Now that I'm a junior, some people might expect me to be a little more vocal," he said. "And I'm sure some of the guys will expect me to 
take  on  a  more  designated  
leadership role."  
But  after  his  season  in

remember is that it's not a normal college system, it's an NFL system," he said. "You're making an even larger jump. The terminology, the verbiage, and everything just jumps up." 
His next hurdle after under­standing the playbook, he said, was being comfortable enough to make quick reads. 
He said plays now seem to be slowing down for him. Crist and the other quarter-

Sophs play in Bloomington 
Four players close out summer on a high note at ITA Championships 
By KATE GRABAREK 
Sporrs Wrirer 
Notre Dame sent four play­ers to the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Summer Championships in Bloomington. 
Sophomore Tyler Davis, Stephen Havens, Matthew Johnson, and Dan Stahl all competed in both singles and doubles. 
"The results in the ITA National Summer Championships are encourag­ing," Irish coach Bobby Bayliss said. "Dan Stahl. Stephen Havens, Tyler Davis, and Matt Johnson all represented Notre Dame well down there. The bond in this year's sophomore class is something that can carry us through the tough times." 
Play opened on Aug. 11 and included two rounds of singles play. 
Davis and Havens each earned a spot in the second round with a bye, while Stahl and Johnson both escaped their first round matches easi­ly. 
In the second round of play both Davis and Havens came away with 6-2, 6-2 victories. 
Davis defeated Memphis's Jordan Smith for his win, and Havens defeated Indiana's Stephen Volg. 
Derek Stephens knocked Johnson out of the tournament after Johnson lost the first set 6-2 and was forced to retire in the second set. 
"Each-of our guys had good wins," Bayliss said. "Stephen [Havens] did well to reach the semifinals, not to mention good doubles results." 
In the third round Davis, Havens and Stahl all advanced. 
Davis earned a 6-1, 6-3 vic­tory over Brett Powers of St. Edwards. Havens earned a 6­3, 6-3 victory over Mark Oljaka of South Florida. Stahl nabbed a 6-2, 6-2 win over
