THE WORLD TODAY 
Order Resumed at San Francisco St. 
SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) -San Francisco State College was generally calm yesterday as 600 police guarded the campus to prevent new outbreaks of violence by student radicals. 
Class attendance was ncar normal in spite·of threatened disorders by militants angered by stiff regulations imposed by acting President 
S.l. Hayakawa, who vowed to "break up this reign of terror by anarchists." In the worst violence in the school's history Tuesday, 33 demonstrators were arrested in repeated clashes with police. The militants hurled steel bars, bricks and bottles at the club wielding officers. 
As the classes opened yesterday for the 18.000 students, not a picket was in sight for the first time since the Black Students Union went on strike Nov. 6. But, members of the Strike Support Committee later began handing out leaflets. 
" ...If there are students in classes who continue to be a party to Hayakawa and his pig police, it is a certainty that black and third world students and other minorities and thousands of their white student supporters will move in one form or another to stop the strike braking by their fellow students," the flyer read, 
"Hayakawa will send in the pigs and we will fight by whatever means we can to protect ourselves, as well as guaranteeing the continuation of the strike until the demands are met." 
The Associated Students board of directors announced it would seek court action to prohibit police from the campus and shut down the college. Directors reaffirmed their support of the strike and condemned Hayakawa's administration. 

Striking Workers Storm Through Cities 
ROME (UPI) -Thousands of striking workers and students waving leftist flags and portraits of Mao Tse-tung stormed through' Italian cities and towns yesterday, smashing windows and attacking 
police in a violent prelude to a massive strike today. 
Angry mobs pummeled police in Naples before reinforcements beat back the crowds. A second demonstration erupted in the city after dark and l ,000 persons marched on police and government offices, throwing bottles of red dye and rocks. Many carried portraits of Mao and Josef Stalin. This time police did not intervene. 
In Rome, hundreds of riot police were mobilized in anticipation of more violence during the strike, to protest officials' failure to provide higher wages and other social benefits. One governemcnt already has fallen because it was unable to meet the demands. 
The rampage began after Sicilian police shot to death two demonstrating farm workc!s Monday and has grown each day, with clashes reported yesterday in Naples, Florence, Milan, Genoa, Trieste Trento, Bari, and other cities and towns along the length of the Italian peninsula. More than 180 persons have been injured. 

Report Shows Experienced Population 
MIAMI BEACH (UPI) -A Purdue University professor told the American Medical Association at its final convention session yesterday that about one half of all women and three fourths of all men in the United States have full sexual experiences prior to marriage. 
Dr. Harold T. Christensen, professor of Sociology at Purdue, stated in his report to the convention,hat: 
"Nearly one fifth of unmarried college females and about one half of unmarried college males have at one time or another experienced sexual relations. 
"In the general population, approximately one half of the females and three fourths of the males have full sexual experience at sometime bcf<>rc marriage," he said. 
"In the neighborhood of one sixth of all brides arc pregnant at the time of the wedding," he said. 
"There is a resonable consensus among authorities that premarital coitus in this country is increasing, especially among females and most especially in relationships involoving love and/or the promise of marriage," Christensen said. 
Nixon Asks Warren to Head Court 
NEW YORK (UPI) -President-elect Richard M. Nixon disclosed yesterday that he has asked U.S. Chief Justice Earl Warren to remain in his post until completion of the present term of the court in June. 
Ronald Ziegler, Nixon's press spokesman, said the President-elect received assurances from Warren, 77, that he would comply with the request in a telephone conversation Tuesday. 
"He (Nixon) thought it most important in order to avoid serious disruption of the work of the court that the effective date of Warren's retirement should not be until the end of the term of the court in J unc," Ziegler said. 
"The Chief Justice agreed and said he would be glad to continue until that time." 
Ziegler said that Nixon would nominate a successor for Warren at an unspecified time. Warren tendered his resignation several months ago to President Johnson, asking to retire as soon as his succe~sor was named. Johnson's nomination of Associate Justice Abc Fortas to succeed Warren failed to get Senate approval after days of acrimonious debate.

Frustrating Stuff 
Chuck Zloch lay on the lower bunk bed in room 324 Walsh Hall, running his hands through that thick, brown hair which has earned him the nickname, "Slick." 
· "I'm still trying to figure out how they tied us," he said. "I don't understand it. We beat the hell out of them-physically. We murdered 'em." Zloch raised his head off the pillow as another thought struck. "It's just typical of the whole season ... frustrating. You know? We should have been 9-1 at the worst." 
Certainly it is possible to attribute Zloch's remarks to a fine blend of sour grapes and Notre Dame bias. He undoubtedly would concede the latter, if not the former. In the case that Chuck is guilty of both, he surely is not alone on this campus. 
It does not seem possible that this 1968 team could have won no more than seven games. Look at this week's AP and UPI ratings and try to tell yourself that all those teams above Notre Dame could defeat the Irish. Consider Michigan State's 5-5 season record and wonder how far over their heads they were that day in East Lansing. Observe the depths to which Purdue feel after that Sept. 28 encounter and imagine what would happen if a rematch were scheduled tomorrow. Compare this team to the 1965 squad, also 7-2-1, and witness the difference.· 
Most of all, try to answer Zloch's question: How did Southern Cal tie Notre Dame? The Irish led in total offense ( 442 yards to 239), first downs (24-14) and total offensive plays(85-65). The NO defense held OJ. Simpson to 55 yards rushing, the worst afternoon of his career. Yet the tally came up 21-21. 
The reasons for Southern Cal's first two touchdowns don't show up in those stats, though. Credit the first one (Sandy Durko's 21-yard interception return with only 40 seconds elapsed) to fine scouting. 
Three times previously this year, Notre Dame has used that simple square-out pattern very early in the game. Against Oklahoma, NO's first offensive play was an end sweep by Bob Gladieux, followed by a flat pass from Terry Hanratty to Gladieux. Then came a seven-yard square-out to Jim Seymour. · 
Against Iowa, the first two plays were nearly identical-a sideline pass to Seymour for 12 yards, tackle by Chuck Bolden, and another sideline pass to Seymour for eight yards, tackle again by Chuck Bolden. Against Navy it was more of the same. The Irish started with the ball at their 41. Hanratty and Seymour used the square-out for consecutive gains of nine and five yards. 
In the face of that evidence, Theismann said, "That's the only thing I can figure. They must have scouted it. They came out in half coverage and you hardly ever see that at the beginning of a game. And they never used it again the rest of the day." 
Half coverage means that Durko was responsible for Seymour the first few yards. All-America safety Mike Battle was to pick him up if Jim went deep. Thus. Durko could play tight and gamble for the 
Meehan Doubtful 

Notre Dame guard Jackie Meehan is very doubtful for Saturday's UCLA contest in the new Athletic and Convocation Center. 
Meehan twisted a knee Tuesday in NO's 84-54 victory over King's College. He will be examined again Saturday morning, but doctors told him ''not to expect too much as far as playing Saturday night." 
Meehan originally injured the knee last May, just a few days before the end of the spring semester. He went home to Philadelphia for two weeks, but returned to campus in mid-June for another check-up. 
At that time, University doctors decided an operation was necessary to remove cartilage. Meehan spent four weeks in a cast and the remainder of the summer lifting leg weights. 
He re-injured the knee in interception, knowing that Battle would tackle Seymour if he did make the catch. 
USC's second TO was as illegitimate as ''Rosemary's Baby." The Trojans took the second half kickoff and drove 24 yards to the ND 41 where they faced a third-and-12. 
USC's Terry DeKraii, flanked left, ran 15 yards downfield, gave Zloch a quick, inside juke and cut across the middle. "Slick" reached over KeKraii's left shoulder and deflected the ball with the back of his hand. It came to rest in Larry Schumacher's arms, but, alas, Zloch had been called for pass interference. 
As ABC's instant replay proved,s Chuck's move was a superb defensive effort. Color commentator Bud Wilkinson sided with him, saying, "It looks like he was playing the ball." Syndicated columnist Red Smith wrote yesterday, "The Trojans owe their unbeaten status to that official's misguided judgement call." 
Zloch was slightly more vehement than Wilkinson or Smith and his opinion was presented a bit more forcefully. "I told the ref he was out of his mind," Chuck recalls. "I played the ball the whole way and I told the guy he was crazy. Actually, I'm lucky I didn't get kicked out of the game." 
It was more than excellent USC scouting and a bum call which pulled the Trojans even with the Irish Saturday. God forgive me for saying this, but Ara's strategy in the final few minutes was questionable. With slightly less than four minutes to play, Gladieux fair caught a John Young punt at the USC 43. Theismann explains the Irish plan of attack. 
"We decided to take it one series of downs at a time. Ara said we 
should get at least one first down, on the ground if possible. We 
wanted to keep the clock moving so that if we did score, they 
wouldn't have much time to come back," Joe explained. 
Notre Dame got a first down at the enemy 25 as Seymour gained 10 yards on a crucial fourth-and-one pass. Theisman took time out and went to the sideline for another strategy session. 
"Ara said he thought we were within field goal range now. He told 
me to keep it on the ground and run down the clock a little more. If possible, he wanted the ball in the middle of the field after the third down play. Actually, we were planning for a field goal before that series began," Theismann continued. 
On first down, Ron Dushney made four yards at left guard. Second down, Gladieux made four more at left tackle. Third-and-two with the ball in the middle of the field. Coley O'Brien took a pitchout and tried to turn right end, but slipped on loose turf. Fourth-and-one at the 16. Ball on the right hash mark. 
"I went over to the bench," said Theismann. "By the time I got there, Ara and coach Pagna already had made their decision. Ara said, 'Scott's gonna kick one.' " 
"I had all the confidence in the world in him. The angle wasn't really that bad because the hash marks in the Coliseum are closer to the middle of the field than any other field I've seen. 
"I just told Scott to keep his head down and he did. He met the ball real well. It had the height and distance. But as soon as J saw it in the air, I looked back down at the ground. I knew it was out to the right." 
End of a frustrating year. Frustrating mainly because the nation's best offense lost the ball so often in scoring territory. To wit-Vs. Purdue: Drove 50 yards to the Purdue 23 and missed a field 
goal. Drove 63 yards the Purdue 10 and missed another field goal. Drove 55 yards to the Purdue 16 and missed another field goal. Drove 70 yards to the Purdue 22 and lost the ball on downs. Drove 45 yards to the Purdue 29 and lost the ball on an interception. Drove 30 yards to the Purdue 22 and lost the bal.l on downs. Returned a punt 50 yards to the Purdue 19 and fimbled. 
Vs.. Michigan State: Drove 33 yards to the MSU 33 and fumbled. Drove 57 yards to the MSU 16 and settled for a field goal. Drove 69 yards to the MSU 1 and lost the ball on downs. Drove 34 yards to the MSU 12 and lost the ball on downs. Drove 52 yards to the MSU 25 and lost the ball on an interception. Drove 53 yards to the MSU 30 and lost the ball on downs. Drove 45 yards to the MSU I 0 and lost the ball on downs. Drove 50 yards to the MSU 2 and lost the ball on downs. 
Vs. Southern Cal: Drove 59 yards to the USC 23 and lost the ball on an interception. Drove 49 yards to the USC 31 and lost the ball on an interception. Drove 39 yards to the USC 34 and punted. Drove 21 yards to the USC 31 and missed a field goal. Drove 27 yards to the USC 16 and missed a field goal. 
That's the stuff which isn't revealed by statistics, the stuff which makes a 9-1 team 7-2-1.
