This week the Sophomore literary Festival commit­tee is proving once again that sophomores can organize a thoroughly successful event. It seems a fitting time tt· recognize a group ofsophomores who have organized a thoroughly successful year: this year's officers of the class of '87. 
In the garbled world of Notre Dame student govern­ment, where the road to office is paved with good inten­tions, this group ofsophomores has proved they can do more than win an election. They have planned and or­ganized SO events to date, almost of which have been well-attended and, rumor has it, a lot offun. 
Ask almost any sophomore what he or she thinks of this year's class officers and he or she will tell you "They're great." Few other branches ofstudent govern­ment can claim this kind ofenthusiasm. 
Jim Domagalski, Ann Jennings, Mark Foley and Dave Miklos have organized what is possibly the most suc­cessful branch of student government this year. They have a force of IOS sop­homores working under

Jennings. 
These four officers may owe a great deal to their staff, but the success ofthe staffowes at least as much to the people who organized it. Jennings and Domagalski say they built the five-committee structure under which they now operate from scratch. "We interviewed IOS people for sophomore class commissioners, and we gave all of them a job," said Domagalski. 
Because most sophomores are not yet 21, class events must be nonalcoholic. It requires a bit more creativity to plan such events, but the sophomore class has proved equal to this challenge. More than 850 stu­dents attended last month's Super Bowl suitcase party, at which two sophomores were awarded trips to the game. The sophomores also sponsored an overnight trip to Chicago which involved more than 1SO students and a Christmas party featuring a horse-drawn sleigh ride. 
This class has also managed to add a new twist to standard events. For example, they hired a belly dancer to perform at one of their study breaks. Jennings and

But the success of this group is not limited to a few great parties. They've displayed creativity In the area of service as well. Nearly every sophomore who has spent time in the infirmary has received a flower, a card and a phone call courtesy of the sophomore class.

this administration has been

The sophomore class has received $1,700 per semester from student fees. Compare this to the $122,000 budget under which the Student Activities Board func­tions and the accomplishments of this class become even more impressive. 
This year's officers of the class of '87 prove true the statement that we've heard so many times and never quite believed -student government can make a differ­ence. The creativity, enthusiasm and hard work of the sophomore class government has helped unify the class and provided a lot offun for a lot ofpeople. 
Candidates for next year's class offices would do well to keep this In mind as they open their campaigns. It's not the system, nor the almighty Notre Dame Adminis­tration that makes student government what it is. It's the people. 
Just ask any sophomore.

Israel, Egypt consider peace talks renewal 
JERUSALEM · Prime Minister Shimon Peres and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt ex­changed special envoys yester­day to explore the prospects for renewing Middle East peace talks. 
Peres met twice with an envoy sent by Mubarak, and the prime minister's spokesman told reporters that Israel and Egypt "recognize the need and urgency to further the peace process" and "will intensify their contacts." 
The new contacts are the first significant movement toward a Middle East peace initiative since the U.S.-mediated talks on autonomy for Palestinians living under Israeli occupation broke down in 1982. 
Peres' spokesman, Uri Savir, repeated the prime minister's po· sition that he is ready to partici· pate In new Middle East peace talks withJordan or with a mixed 


Budget office says deficit to stay high 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-Federal deficits 
are likely to remain above S180 bil­
lion through the end of this decade, 
even if Congress adopts all the 
spending cuts sought by President 
Reagan. the non-partisan Congres· 
sional Budget Office said yesterday. 
In a 141-page review of the presi­
dent's S974 billion budget for fiscal 
1986, beginning Oct. I, the CBO 
disputed the administration's con­
tention that adoption of the budget 
would cause the deficit to decline 
gradually to S82 billion by 1990. 
Instead, the deficit would drop 
from its current level of just over 
S200 billion to about S186 billion 
and "remain at about (that) level 
through the period," CBO director 
Rudolph Penner told the Senate Ap· 
propriations Committee in prepared 
testimony. 
Meanwhile, White House budget 
director David Stockman rejected 
Democrats' suggestions that the ad· 
ministration was using "fake" figures 
to support its budget projections. 
He also denied that his outspoken 
attacks on certain programs like 
farm subsidies and military pensions 
might cost him his job. 
"I plan to be here. I know 
(defending budget cuts) is a tough 
problem but I think I have some­
thing to contribute and I believe 
they know that downtown," he told 
the House Budget Committee. 
The CBO, in the first complete congressional analysis of Reagan's latest budget proposals, said the ad­ministration's projections of declin· ing deficits after 1986 are based on brighter economic conditions than those foreseen by congressional economists. 
For instance, although both the administration and the CBO predict that interest rates will remain be· tween 8 percent and 8.c; percent throughout 198S, "the administra­tion assumes that real interest rates decline steadily after 1987," the budget office said. 
Under the congressional forecast, the three-month Treasury bill rate would decline from 8.2 percent to 
S.O percent by 1990. Under the con­gressional analysis, the rate would remain at 8.2 percent through 1990. 
Administration projections also assume lower inflation rates and more rapid growth in the gross na­tional product throughout the de­cade than those foreseen by congressional analysts. 

Jordanian-Palestinian delegation, provided the delegation did not include members ofthe Palestine liberation Organization. 
In Cairo, Mubarak met with Is· rael's energy minister, Moshe Shahal, in what Israeli sources said were "complementary" talks. A second Israeli was ex­pected to head for Cairo later and Israeli sources indicated he would be Avraham Tamir, director-general of Peres' office. 
Israeli officials saw in the in· tensified contacts a possibility of better relations with Egypt after a chill that followed Israel's June 1982 invasion of Lebanon. 
The new Israeli-Egyptian moves came at a time when Jor· dan and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat have agreed on a joint negotiating strategy on the Middle East. That agreement has been applauded by Mubarak as offering a way to get talks going on the entire range of issues that block peace in the Middle East. 
Pope, Grotnyko meet in Vatican; discuss Catholicistn in U.S.S.R. 
VATICAN CITY· PopeJohn Paul II and the Soviet foreign minister, Andrei Gromyko, held an apparently cordial conversation for nearly two hours yesterday about world peace and the "situation" of Catholics in the Soviet Union. 
Neither side gave details ofthe un­usually long audience. It was John Paul's first with a Kremlin official since the martial law crackdown in his native Poland in 1981 and the at­tempt on his life, which some reports have linked to the Soviet se­cret police. 
Gromyko, 75, got a red-carpet welcome for his first visit to the Vatican in six years. He said it was a "good" meeting, and that the ques· tion of a papal visit to the Soviet Union did not come up. 
John Paul, 64, said last year that he had been denied permission to visit lithuania, a strongly Roman Catho­lic republic in the Soviet Union. 
John Paul greeted Gromyko in Russian, and the Soviet official assured the pontiff of his "best wishes" in English at the end of the meeting. The pope appeared relaxed and both men were smiling when reporters and photographers were ushered into the papal library. 
Presenting his gift of a smali lac­quered box to John Paul, Gromyko said, "It's a small memento, as the ~ericans say." 
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said only that the two men discussed "peace in the world and the situation of Catholics in the So· viet Union." 
Advance expectations were that Gromyko would seek papal support for the Kremlin campaign against President Reagan's space-based defense proposal, commonly called Star Wars, and that John Paul would press his guest about religious liberty in the Soviet Union.

The White House had lobbied against any changes in federal credit help for farmers, many ofwhom are unable to obtain new loans because the land they use for collateral has plummeted in value.

Not justa pianist on the side 
Special to the ObServer 
Notre Dame, Ind... "Not oruy does he play with an exceptional technique, but his performing style is a quite special mix ofthe endear­ing and the engaging. Some pianists come on to the platform and say, 'listen, this is me.' Mr. Jacob is much more the servant of the music which, as unfamiliar repertoire, he takes the trouble to expound before he plays." 
This praise was given by critic MichaelJohn White ofa concert by Jeffrey Jacob, a concert pianist and professor at Saint Mary's College. He recently returned from athree month European tour, receiving superlative reviews in each country he visited. 
Jacob's unique concert manner, as indicated by White in his review in "The Guardian", is one ofthe reasons for his most successful European tour-but not the only one. In Holland he was hailed as "a young musical genius", while a British magazine reported his "formidable technique and a real artist's imagination in the in­terpretive field.'' 
Jacob's tour began in Ghent, Belgium, in September and in­cluded five concerts in England, five in The Netherlands, two in Germany and three performances in Warsaw, Poland. His program was primarily contemporary and featured world premieres ofworks by composers in two ofthe countries on his itinerary. 
In the London Purcell Room concert he presented "Celebration," a work written for him by British composer, Francis Routh. At his concerts in The Net­herlands he played "Piano Sonato No.2" by Dutch composer,Jo Sporck. His programs also included his own "Two Fantasies" which according to English critic Denby Richards, "clearly demonstrates jacob's strong leaning to the roman­tic imagery and mystery ofpiano color and drama." 
As part ofmost ofhis programs, Jacob presented the European premieres of"Gnomic Variations" by George Crumb and "Piano Sonata No. 1" by Chu Wang-Hua. (The latter was written for Jacob by the Chinese composer when he was invited to make a three week con­cert tour ofChina in 1982. Jacob was the first American to receive

At the invitation ofthe Polish Ministry ofCulture,Jacob spent a week in Poland. On November 27 he gave a lecture/recital entitled, "Foundations of20th-Century Music," and on November 28 he gave a lecture/recital, "Aspects of Contemporary Chinese and West­ern European Music." On Decem­ber 1, Jacob gave a recital in Paderewski Hall ofthe Frederic Chopin Academy for Music. A reception following the concert was held for Jacob at the American Embassy in Warsaw. 
while in Europe. The British Broad­casting Corporation recorded works by George Crumb, Vincent Persichetti and Samuel Barber to air nationally in March 1985. Polish Television recorded Jacob's recital in Paderewski Hall, Warsaw, along with a pre-recital interview and Polish National Radio will broadcast a concert in March 1985. 
Jacob, who makes all ofhis own tour arrangements, met many musicians and their families in the countries he visited. He developed close ties. He comments, "The people I met were warm and hospitable and very curious about all aspects ofAmerican life.'' 
An ingenuous manner and prodigious talent make Jacobs a remarkably effective goodwill em­bassador for Saint Mary's College and his country as well as an Ameri­
plu:sicilm ofthe first rank.

The more adventurous types can work on the docks. The three main docks are Lobster House, A and)'s and the Co-op. They open between 7 and 8 a.m. and once the dockmaster gets to know you it is pretty steady work. Pay is daily and tax free. 
Ifyou're interested in a summer ofcommercial fishing experience, ask to speak to either the captain or first mate. Ifyou have never been out, make sure you tell them you are a greenhorn. Also, make sure you have a sea bag ready when you board, just in case. It may require living out ofa bag for a while but in an instant you could be out to sea making as much as a thousand dollars in two weeks or, ifyou don't catch anything, not a dime. 
Ifyou decide to do it, write the chamber ofcommerce to get boarding house addre~s. I rec­ommend the Maycomber or Hunt­-ington. Rent averages about $55 a week, which usually does not include a stove.

The Notre Dame student body is a population at risk. Its members are confronted with SU(;h nagging questions as what they want to do with the rest oftheir lives and with whom they will do it. Meanwhile the academic and social demands pile up like snow drifts during a South Bend winter. To further complicate matters, the students, after having left the unit ofthe family, must struggle to develop an entirely new system oftheir own. 
According to Patrick Utz, direc­tor ofthe Counseling and Psycho­

logical Services Center at Notre Dame, these are some ofthe reasons that can make the college years rather difficult. "People will 
_experience difficulties and prob­lems in life management. This is why the University recognizes the need for professionals in managing problems more effectively," says Utz. 
Staffed by a team of psyc­hologists, a psychiatrist, a social 
worker and psychology students working toward their doctorates, the center offers a variety ofpro· grams to assist both undergraduate and graduate students. 
In addition to providing counsel­ing on an individual level, the cen­ter, located on the third floor ofthe Student Health Center, offers many regularly scheduled group meetings and workshops. Alcohol abuse is dealt with by such groups as Stu­dents on Alcoholic Problems (SOAP) and Adult Children Al­coholic Parent (ACAP), which is aimed at helping young people affected by someone else's drinking. There are also groups designed to help with family crises. "Family Ties" helps the student who is struggling to maintain a positive relationship with his parents, while the Griefand Loss group assists those who have had close family members die recently. Self-hypnosis and relaxation are discussed in Stress Management which is offered in the form ofa physical education class. Achievement workshops give instruction on how to come to grips with pressure. In addition there are programs on eating disorders, asser­tion training and study/time man­agement skills. Counseline, a telephone service that provides taped materials on a variety ofstu­dent concerns, is also offered. 
With all the center does for the Notre Dame community, Utz would like the center's image to be more positive. "Our society is coming out ofthe Dark Ages where people with psychological problems are ostracized." Utz cites the center's teaching ofP.E. courses and spon· soring ofa film/ discussion series on psycholigical topics as helping to put the center into the mainstream ofservices. "Ule third floor (of the Student Health Center) is not an

eerie place where crazy people go," says Utz, "It is staffed with people for people with problems." 
The center assisted approxi­mately 1300 students last year on either an individual or group basis or in the workshop format. Utz states, though, that percentage wise, the center was at the lower end ofusage compared to similar institutions at other colleges. He explains that this is in part due to the counseling that is made available through hall rectors as well as the services offered by the Freshman Year ofStudies, which helps freshmen adjust to the process ofcoming to college. 
Utz urges people to come to the center ifthey are having a problem but aren't sure ifcounseling is nec­essary. Some signs to look for, though. are In academic perfor­mance. Studying longer to master the same arriount of material or missing test questicns to which the student knew the answers are symptoms ofa high level ofanxiety which may get out ofcontrol. 
According to the nature ofthe problem, the center might well refer a student to other depart­ments on campus such as the Uni­versity Ministry, the Career and Placement Center or the infirmary for a medical evaluation. 
"I would like no one to have to use our services, but that is un­realistic," Utz explains, "There are more people who could profit than just those who are using them. We're hoping that a more positivt image (ofthe center) will get the .n to take advantage ofthe services without a stigma being associated with it."

Self help may be the key to happiness 
Monica Fatum 
Book review 


All ofus have our own private definitions ofhappiness. According to Dr. Harod Greenwald, author ofThe Happy Person, only you can decide what makes you happy. And now, with his book, you can begin to make it happen. 
The back cover ofthe book makes this pitch: "You'll be able to determine, perhaps for the first time in your life, exactly what would make you a happy 
· person; how to get rid ofthe life decisions, conscious or unconscious, which are holding you back. Most important -you'll find your own alternatives to the self-destructive behavior that's causing your problems. Within yourselfyou'll discover the resources to heal your pains and overcome your most paralyzing fears." That sounds like a pretty monumental task, but actually Greenwald approaches it in a simple seven-step plan illustrated with personal case studies and soul-searching questions. In the first place, happy people don't see themselves as the victims in their life stories. They choose to be happy by turning problems on their heads, using them to their advantage. However important external factors like health, physical appearance and upbringing may be, they don't have to determine the happiness quotient in anyone's life story. Quite simply, the way we experience our lives is up to us. Ifyou see a situation in your life as a problem, that's what it is-a problem. Ifyou see it as an opportunity, it can suddenly look and feel very different. 
Step 
One ofGreenwald's plan is to decide what you want in order to be happy or happier. You want to be happy, but what does that mean to you? What do you really want? You need to develop a specific goal to work for. 

Step 
Two involves finding the decision behind the problem. In other words, describe the problems you have in reaching your goal. However, avoid judging your behavior at all costs. To be a good therapist to yourself, you must recognize that conquering yourselfis an impossible task. No one judges you as severely as you judge yourself. Learn to forgive yourself. 

Step 
lbree ofthe plan is finding the context for the original decision. Ask yourselfwhen it was made. Tracing behavior back to an original decision is a little like solving a mystery and can help in shakingoffhappiness-blocking behavior. 

Step 
Four includes listing the payoffs for the decision. Dr. Greenwald advises you to look at it this way: no matter how unhappy life has been for you so far, you have survived. You have_coped. And you can, ifyou choose, sweeten things for yourself. 

Step 
Five calls for an examination ofyour alternatives to the behavior that is causing the problem. Stop taking yourselfso seriously. Decide to look at your alternatives. Relax. There's no deadline, no contract. · 

Step 
Six involves choosing your alternative and putting it into practice. Don't be afraid to trust yourself. Dr. Greenwald counsels that it really doesn't matter whether or not the rest ofthe world defines your purpose as a mighty one. Just deciding to be happy constitutes a terrific contribution to the world. 

Step 
Seven, the final stride, you learn to support yourselfin carrying out the new decision. Allow yourselfflexibility. After all, old habits die hard. Remember that a slip back into your old behavior does not mean you are a failure or the decision was bad. Acknowledge your lapse and continue carrying out the decision. Don't hesitate to reach out to friends and family for additional support. 


The Happy Person just might be your ticket to a happier life. Dr. Harold Greenwald's step-by-step method has a way ofdrawing you in and making you respond to his techniques and probing questions before you even realize it. In the book, he talks directly to you, as an old friend might. You begin to feel that Dr. Greenwald is really pulling for you. 
As the author ofThe Happy Person claims, ifyou feel that your life isn't working, you owe yourselfthis chance to be a happy person. It could work for you ifyou let it.

Owners will show ledgers 
Assoclated Press 
NEW YORK -Citing baseball's "serious financial situation," team owners asked the players for a moratorium on labor negotiations yesterday until the two sides can "discuss the grave economic con­cerns" ofthe game. 
The surprise move could pave the way for the players' union to get its first look at the clubs' financial ledgers. Also, it probably will delay any settlement until after opening day, April 8. 
Lee MacPhail, president of man­agement's Player Relations Commit­tee, said the decision "came after a long discussion about the whole fin­ancial state ofthe industry." 
After a meeting of owners Tues­day in New York, baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth em­powered the PRC to require a finan­cial accounting from all teams if it became necessary in negotiations. 
Owners have refused in the past to open their books to players. Labor law, however, requires management to show proof of financial problems ifpoverty is used as a tool in negotia­tions. 
Ueberroth said that MacPhail, PRC counsel Barry Rona, union head Don Fehr and Marvin Miller, the former union leader acting as special adviser to Fehr, were responsible for any decisions regarding the release offinancial information. 
And, the commissioner said, "if those two parties said that was what was needed to get the job done, I would see to it that they got what they needed." 
A negotiating session for today was cancelled, and the PRC said the two sides would not meet again on March S in West Palm Beach, Fla. 
For nearly four months, the two sides had been negotiating rather smoothly toward a contract to replace the one that expired on Dec. 3I. Owners and the union wanted to have a new agreement by opening day, and that appeared to be a real possibility until now. 
The union has asked for sweeping changes in the free agency system, particularly in the re-entry draft, and also was prepared to request that a percentage of baseball's television revenue be applied toward the union's benefits plan.

All-around senior 

Suess plays several roles for SMC 
two basketball invitational tourna­
ment all-star teams her sophomore 
year. She received the Saint Mary's 
Coaches' Award for the 1983-84 
season and also was named to the all· 
tourney team at Saint Mary's annual 
Roundball Classic that year. 
As a freshman she also earned the 
Saint Mary's Coaches' Award for 
softball. 
When Suess was considering col­
leges, basketball was definitely in 
the back ofher mind. 
"I went to basketball camp at 
Notre Dame my senior year and the 
Saint Mary's coach talked to me. 
"I like Saint Mary's because it's 
small and I can really become in­
volved in a diverse amount ofthings. 
Being in sports has actually im­
proved my grades because I have to 
be organized when involved in dif­
ferent activities." 
Off the court and field, Suess has made many contributions to the Saint Mary's community. She has been in charge of the Adopt-a-Nun program for the past three years and also is co-coordinator of photogra­phy for the Saint Mary's yearbook this year. 

Presently, she coordinates the Sports Information Department, which works closely with the Col­lege's Public Relations Department. Suess said she sees this department as a positive step for Saint Mary's in the promotion of Its athletic pro­grams. 
In an effort to facilitate better communication between varsity and non-varsity athletes and be­tween the athletic and school ad­ministrations, Suess also helped to organize the newly founded Athletic Council, on which she serves as a basketball team representative. 
On the basketball court Suess 
noticed her team's own lack ofcom­
munication. 
"One ofthe big things teams have 
to do when losing is communicate, 
and for a while we were not commu­
nicating as a team," she explains. 
"But I think that when we realized it 
was causing a problem, we began to 
communicate better and played bet­
ter." 
Wood emphasizes Suess' past ex­perience as being influential on a team comprised mostly of under­classmen. 
"One thing that must be noted," commented Wood, "is that Elaine is a natural leader. She sees things that need to be done, takes hold of them and gets things done." 
Sophomore guard Mariclaire Dris­
coll agreed with Wood. 
"She's a good leader and has helped me personally as far as en­couraging me and giving me confi­dence," said Driscoll. "She tells me what I do wrong, but in a positive way." 
Although Saint Mary's record was disappointing this season, Suess said she is grateful for first-year coach Wood's efforts. 
"I appreciate his enthusiasm for the program," she said. "Even If we weren't doing well he tried not to let us get discouraged. He was very pos­itive toward the team, which was needed." 
Wood assessed the senior player in one statement. "She doesn't have a large frame but plays with a lot ofheart," he said. 
Good things do come in small packages, and Saint Mary's has benefited greatly from Elaine Suess' four years of contributions in aU aspects of the College community.

Although the 4-16 Saint Mary's basketball team may hav~ wished for a slightly better final season record, It does have a lot to be proud of ­nam~ly senior Elaine Su~ss. for all that sh~ has contributed to the team and to her school. 
When one speaks of a model stu­dent/athlete, the Grand Blanc, Mich., native Immediately comes to mind in Saint Mary's athletic circles. 
Suess, an English major, has per­formed the rare task of playing both varsity basketball and varsity softball for four years. She also helped coor­dinate the College's Athletic Coun­cil and Sports Information Program. 
Head basketball coach Marvin Wood has nothing but praise for the '5·5 senior on the court. 
"Elaine has made a strong contri­bution to the basketball program," said Wood. "She is also very unsel­fish on the court." 
Due to various circumstances on past Saint Mary's teams, Suess has been asked to play at a number of positions and has gracefully ac­cepted the challenges. 
"I had played guard all my life, In­cluding my freshman year at Saint Mary's," said the dual sport star. "During my sophomore year the starting point guard left and I took over In a position I had never played before. Then due to a lack of height (on the team) In my junior year I had to play center/forward. And I played forward again this year." 
Her versatility along with her con­cern for team play allowed Suess to make the smooth transitions. 
"I had good fundamentals and was able to move where Coach wanted me to play," she said. "Looking back, I see Icontributed in an area where I was needed most." 
And Wood appreciated the cooperation ofSuess. 
"Elaine is probably a natural guard, size and ability-wise. It (switching positions) is harder than most people think. You see the game from a different perspective." 
Wood credits Suess with excel­lent outside shooting, strong defen· sive play and the ability to make g<x>d assists. But Suess has no doubts concerning her favorite aspect of the game. 
"I love to pass," says the 22-year· old, who handed out 60 assists this season. "There is not a better feeling than when you make a perfect pass and a teammate grabs it and scores for two. 
"I don't think scoring points is al­ways the most important part of the game," adds Suess, who also re· corded 29 steals during the season. "There are so many different facets. Playing good defense is one of the hardest because you've really got to work." 
Not only did Suess dish off 60 as­sists and grab 29 steals this season, but she also pulled down 60 r~bounds and had 167 total points on 60-of-144 shooting from the field. She also shot 68 percent from the free-throw line. 
Over the years, Suess has been rewarded well for her athletic en­deavors. At Grand Blanc Community High School, she was named Woman Athlete of the Year, while serving as captain on both the basketball and softball teams her senior year. 
At Saint Mary's, she was named to

No grudge against Knight 
Steve Alford says he feels tired 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Indian;1's Steve Alford doesn't feel intimidated by his volatile coach, Bob Knight, but the Hoosiers' starguard admits he's a tired basketball player and looks for­ward to a less hectic schedule oflif­ting weights this summer. 
Alford, the team scoring leader and Most Valuable Player as a fresh­man last year, has been in a two­week slump he says has been "probably the toughest in my career." 
A 20-point, 60-percent shooter from the field most ofthe season, AI­
ford's recent games have been a nightmare. In two losses last week, he hit onlysix of26 shots and scored a total of 14 points. And his personal slump has coincided with the Hoosiers' slide as a team, now 6-8 in the Big Ten and 14-10 for all games. 
"I don't really have much of an idea (ofthe reason). That's the prob­lem we're having," the 6-foot-2 sophomore said in a telephone inter­view from Bloomington. "The players are disappointed, and the coaches have the same feeling. We as players feel we're working as hard as we have in the past, but we haven't come up with a solution.

That's been our problem lately." 
Indiana has lost seven of its past 1 0 games. In Saturday's loss to Purdue, Knight was ejected five minutes into the game after receiv· ing three technical fouls and hurling a chair across the court. 
"I didn't see any ofit," Alford said ofthe incident with the chair. "I was as upset (with the official's call that led to Knight's outburst) as anybody. The officiating has been poor, and it's been frustrating. 
"He's sorry, and he apologized," Alford said of Knight. "What more can I say. There's just no better man in the business than him."

Teaming up with Fitzgerald is 6-1 senior Mike. Burt. A transfer from South Georgia Junior College, Burt contributes 6. 5 points to· the Bul­ldog effort to go with 68 assists. 
Receiving the call often at third guard is senior Gave Gilbreth. A good outside shooter, Gilbreth averages 6. 5 points and has totalled 45 assists. 
In the Bulldogs' first basketball game in Hinkle Fieldhouse, in 1928, they defeated Notre Dame, 21-13, in overtime. 
This time around, the Irish will have to score a few more points if they hope to leave the unfriendly confines of the Fieldhouse with a victory.

"Our hard work is behind us now," said Stark. "We're in a taper­ing situation right now so we're not too tired and if we're not too tired, we should improve our times." 
Since the Irish have not competed since the North Star Conference Championship meet, they will be rested and well-trained going into today's competition. While winning the championship would be the icing on Notre Dame's season, the Irish will be pleased iftheycan attain some personal best finishes.

fective player. She's also a very good penetrator." 
Rounding out the core of the But­ler attack is 5-4 freshman guard Denise Walters, 5-9 freshman for­
. ward Pam Schiefelbein, and 5-8 for­ward Christie Essington. Schiefelbein and Essington, who average 12 ppg. and 1 0 rpg. between them, should be keys to the contest, since Butler will need a strong rebounding effort to keep the Irish from controlling the game. 
"We have to use our height advan­tage on the boards," notes DiStanis­Jao. "They are not a really deep team. Basically, we just have to play good, solid, fundamental basketball." 
Despite a recent abundance of turnovers, the Irish should be able to play their solid, fundamental game. Junior guard Trena Keys has taken over the scoring role for the team, as she averages 17.8 ppg., while 6-0 for­ward Mary Beth Schueth and 6-2 center Sandy Botham provide a for­midable inside game. 
In brief, the Irish should win this one; unless, of course, they are looking ahead to their next game against Evansville. 
"A good team does not look ahead past anyone," says DiStanislao. "They better not be looking past this one." 
Ifthe Irish can last long enough to tame the Lady Bulldogs, they will be able to enjoy a breather from heavy competition.

From wrestling family 
Ken Kasler impresses in first year 
By BRIAN McCARTHY 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame Wrestling Pro­
gram is having a good season and 
one of the reasons has been the 
strong performance by underclas­
smen, including freshman Ken Kas­
ler. 
A 16-4 victory over his Marquette 
opponent last week put the finishing 
touch on a 17-12 regular-season 
record and gives Kasler momentum 
heading into the NCAA regionals In 
Des Moines, Iowa, this weekend. 
Success Is not new for Kasler, who compiled a 71-9-2 record at North Olmsted High School in North Olmsted, Ohio, on the western edge of Cleveland. Serving as team cap­tain both his junior and senior years, Kasler was a three-time conference champion, regional champion and a third-place finisher in the state as a senior. 
Kasler's wrestling career began at age six, inspired by his father, who was a high school wrestling coach. An interest In wrestling appears to be a common trait in the Kasler fam­ily. 
"My dad wrestled, my brother wrestles, I wrestle, my mom follows wrestling." says Kasler. "In fact, they've been to quite a few matches this year." 
During his senior year in high school, Kasler expressed interest in Notre Dame before he was recruited by Irish head coach Fran McCann. Since McCann was not hired until late In the school year, he did not contact Kasler until after he had been accepted. The reputation of the North Olmsted program con­vinced McCann that Kasler was a quality wrestler. 
"We didn't know him too well," says McCann. "Ken's interest in us came first. We based our judgement on his high school program." 

~ir~f -~~­
Ken Kasler 
Kasler took his first semester of college in stride, at least in the class­room, but he found the college wrestler provided much more of a challenge than the average high school wrestler. 
"The college wrestler is a lot more physical," says Kasler. "You see bet­ter competition every time out." 
Kasler did not know how he would fare once he arrived at Notre Dame, but he was optimistic. 
"I wasn't sure how I would do," says Kasler. "I thought I could do all right. I didn't really know what to expect." 
As his first season nears the end, Kasler's contribution to the team has been more than can usually be ex­pected from a freshman. Even though he had good coachingbefore arriving at Notre Dame, Kasler praises McCann and assistant coach John Azevedo for improving his style tremendously. 
"There's definitely a difference between college coaching and high school coaching," says Kasler. "Coach McCann and coach Azevedo have shown me a lot about tech­nique; coming out from underneath, escaping." 
The effect of the Irish coaching staff on Kasler's wrestling has been evident as the 158-pounder im­proved tlu-oughout the year. McCann sees one of Kasler's attri­butes as his ability to recognize his strengths and weaknesses. 
"Ken utilizes his strengths and does what he has to do to win," says McCann. 
McCann describes Kasler's best assets as his slickness and intelli· gence. Kasler said he plans on using his talents as best he can in the next three years. 
"I'm definitely setting my goals pretty high for the next few years," say Kasler. "With this program and the coaches and the guys were bringing in I'm looking forward to it." 
The goals for the Notre Dame wrestling program also are high for the coming years and it appears Ken Kasler will be a great aid in helping the team meet those goals.

quick enough against their zone (In 
the first quarter) and we forced 
some bad shots from the outside," 
said O'Malley. "In thefourth quarter, 
though, our defense was great. we 
got our heads up and moved our 
feet. Tough defense was definately 
the key to our comeback." 
In the second game, second· 
ranked Pasquerilla East clashed with 
third-ranked Farley. Both teams en· 
tered the game with 8-2 records. 
Play was very sloppy early on, and 
the referees called a number offouls on both teams. P-E took advantage of the situation by passing inside to Reggie Richter. Richter went to the foul line repeatedly during the first half. Farley relied on the outside shooting of Mary Borkowski, along with an occasional basket by Julie Pietras. At half, P-E led, 16-13. 

The plethora ot fouls continued in the second half. However, the tables were turned on P-E as Richter col­lected her fourth foul early in the third quarter and then fouled out only a minute into the fourth quae­ter. Meanwhile, Borkowski, Pietras, and Marilu Almeida were helping Farley take the lead. Entering the fourth quarter, Farley was up, 23·21. 

. · 

The game see-sawed back and forth the rest of the way. With 30 seconds left, Farley had the ball, trailing 28-27. But Borkowski missed two IS-foot jumpers and P-E hung on to win with aslim one-point margin. 
P-E must now play B-P on Sunday at 6 p.m. Farley and Walsh drop into the losers' bracket and play at 7 p.m. on Sunday.
