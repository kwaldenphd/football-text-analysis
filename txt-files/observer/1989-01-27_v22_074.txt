Soviets massacre Afghan civilians in 'major atrocity' 
Associated Press 
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan--So­viet gunners wiped out Afghan villages and shelled a mountain tunnel, killing hundreds of civilians along the key highway carrying Red Army soldiers home from Afghanistan, West­ern diplomats said Thursday. 
In Washington, meanwhile, Secretary of State James Baker ordered the closing of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, the Afghan capital, because of turmoil from the Soviet troop withdrawal. 
Western diplomats in Is­lamabad quoted Afghan sources and a witness as saying the Soviets and Afghan govern­ment troops committed a "major atrocity" on Monday in shelling both ends of the 10-mile Salang Tunnel. 
The tunnel, part of the cru­cial Salang Highway that con­nects Kabul to the Soviet Union, cuts through the Hindu Kush mountains about 60 miles north of the capital. 
The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, quoted a report from Kabul as saying: "After shelling the north and south ends of the Salang tunnel, Soviet and Afghan artillery obliterated all dwellings and villages south of the tunnel." 
In Washington, State Depar­tment spokesman Charles Red­man said, "There are eyewit­nesses who say no dwellings remain and hundreds of civilians were killed."

--~~~-MS _linked
to v1rus like AIDS 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON --A genetic test of cells in the blood of patients with multiple sclerosis suggests that the crippling dis­ease is closely associated with a virus similar to the AIDS virus, researchers report. 
E. Prem Kumar Reddy, are­searcher at Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, said the genetic study of blood samples from six multiple sclerosis patients pro­vides "direct proof" that the human T-lymphotropic virus, or HTLV-I, is involved in the MS disease process. 
"This test for the first time shows that if you do sensitive enough assays you can find HTLV in MS patients," Reddy said in an interview. The same tests on 20 healthy people, he

New bus will run directly from NO to University Park MaU 
By NATASHA WILSON Senior Staff Reporter 
Transpo, the public bus ser­vice of South Bend, recently added a route that runs from the University of Notre Dame to University Park Mall. 

The bus company initiated the new route Jan. 3 in response to numerous requests by Notre Dame and Saint Mary's stu­dents for convenient public transportation to the mall, ac­cording to Transpo officials. 
The Route Seven Notre Dame-University Park Mall bus operates Monday through Friday on half hour intervals and also on an hourly basis every Saturday. 
Stopping first at Notre Dame's Main Circle, the bus goes to the Hesburgh Library, stops at Ironwood and State Road 23 and arrives at the mall within fifteen minutes of its departure from the library. 
A one-way fare costs 50 cents, and when Notre Dame is in ses­sion the inter-campus shuttle bus may be used to reach Saint Mary's College. 
The new route is a combina­tion of a downtowwtnall route and one which went from campus to downtown, said Transpo marketing and plan­ning manager Mary Beth McAdams 
Previously students had to take the bus to the downtown terminal and transfer to a bus going first to Miami Scottsdale Mall and then finally to Univer­sity Park Mall. 
The school bus which had transported students to the malls on weekends has not been in operation this school year and has been replaced by the Transpo route. 
"By combining the routes we will cut operational costs while

increasing our ridership," McAdams said. Transpo hopes to attract Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students to the new route with its upcoming promotion, "Notre Dame Night at the Mall," she said. 
On Feb. 9 Transpo will transport students to the mall, where some of the stores will give discounts to students, McAdams said. 
Students will also be able to attend the theater at a special reduced price that night. 
"I'm hoping (the students) will try the bus and see how easy it is to get to the mall and will then continue to ride it," the manager said. 
On weekdays the first mall bus leaves the library circle at 7:35a.m. all at 9:25p.m. 
Monday through Friday Route seven interconnects with the Route eight Miami Scot­tsdale Mall Route. 
On Saturday the bus runs from 7:35a.m. to 5:55p.m. with the last one leaving the mall at 6:10p.m. 
Complete bus schedules can be found next to the Informa­tion Desk in the LaFortune Stu­dent Center. 


New Mac lab to open in library 
By MIKE O'CONNELL News Staff 
Final preparations are being made for the opening of a new computer lab in the Hesburgh Library which will replace the existing twenty-four hour Mac Lab at the Computer Math Build­ing. 
The new computer lab will consist of 40 Macintosh com­puters and 30 IBM PCs mostly from the Comput­eDMath Mac Lab. 
"The new lab will be open to all students with special software applications for ar­chitects and engineers, such as Generic CAD, Turbo Pas­cal, and Quick C," said Carolyn Goodnight of the Computing Center and Mathematics Building. 
"Once the computers have been moved to the new lab, one possibility would be to expand the Computer Repair Center into the exist­ing space." she said. 
Goodnight said she hopes to open the new lab by early March and complete it by May. 
But it remains uncertain whether or not there will be access to computers on a 24­hour basis. 
"We're aware of the prob­lem concerning students, and we hope to have 24-hour access in the LaFortune

IN BRIEF 
Two Notre Dame students have been named the first Exxon Scholars in a new program by the Exxon Research and Engineering Co. to assist minority students in engin­eering. Cheryl Gomez, a mechanical engineering junior from Pueblo, Colo. and Bruce Savage, an aerospace engin­eering sophomore from Chicago, will each receive a $3,000 tuition award for the spring semester and will continue through graduation. Both students have been offered sum­mer employment with Exxon, which has also given $5,000 to support the University's Minority Engineering Pro­gram. At Notre Dame, only one quarter of black Americans and half of Hispanics who enroll in engineering actually graduate in the field. The Minority Engineering Program, directed by Assistant Dean John Miles, provides individual counseling, tutoring, field trips, special workshops and visits by succesful minority engineers. -The Observer 
Andrew Hollander has been named assistant to Notre Dame's dean of administration. Hollander will maintain faculty data and supervise the microcomputer support of the office of the dean of administration and registrar. An entomologist, Hollander holds a doctorate from the Uni­versity of Massachusetts, a master's degree from Okla­homa State University and a bachelor's degree from Iowa State University. He came to Notre Dame in 1983 as a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Biological Sciences for research on the developing and reproductive physiology of mosquitoes. He maintained computer opera­tions in the insect biochemistry lab. -The Observer

All-nighters: fantastic fun for everyone, 
All-nighters. 

They're an essential part of any complete col­lege career. But, sad to say, some people have never experienced the joy of all-nighters, while others approach them with fear and loathing, wailing and gnashing their teeth at the thought of a drugged-up, sleepless night. 
This trepidation is totally unnecessary. With tne proper information and tools, the all-nighter can be a fun, enlightening and enriching expe­rience. To help the neophytes out there, I've prepared a little question-and-answer guide to the perfect all-nighter. 
Which night should I pull an all-nighter? 

Any night is a good night! Sleep is for the weak! Some of the best all-nighters are those that are totally unnecessary. 
Besides, you might be surprised to discover that all-nighters actually relieve stress. Here's how. If you're planning on getting a few hours of sleep, you'll probably freak out because of the time pressure. 
Once you decide to pull the all-nighter, however, vast vistas of time stretch out before you. If you're a professional procrastinator, it gives you a few more hours to blow off. Imagine the immense sense of satisfaction you get when you say, "Sure, it's 3 a.m. and I haven't started my paper on Existential Angst and the Possible Presidency of Dan Quayle, but that's OK I still have plenty of time." 
What tools do I need? 

The main one is caffeine. By the way, it's about time to clear up some misconceptions about caffeine. Caffeine does not make you ner­vous or shaky. Caffeine turns you into an invin­cible studying Superman, a throating jugger­naut. Caffeine is your friend. 
There are two favored methods of caffeine doping: coffee and Mountain Dew. If you need a really quick jolt, try mixing four or five teaspoons of instant coffee grounds in a cup of boiling water instead of one. This tastes pretty vile, so add lots of sugar. If you can't drink it, pretend it's some new mixed drink at an OC party, and that people will really respect you as a party animal if you manage to choke it down. 
What if I start falling asleep? 
First of all, don't take a nap. You know deep

down inside that you're not .going to get back up, no matter what you tell yourself--you're deceiving yourself. Even if you do wake up, you won't feel any better. Imagine having all of your internal juices pumped out and replaced by a gooey green paste. That is what you'll feel like when you wake up. 
Instead, drink a cup of coffee. If this doesn't work, drink another cup ... 
Why not just get your work done far enough in advance so that you don't have to stay up all night? 
Balderdash! You have the rest of your life to be responsible--why start now? You're in col­lege, a time to do really perverse things for no apparent reason. When you're in the middle of your next all-nighter and trying hard to keep from slipping from a merely zombie-like stupor into total catatonia, remember that one day, years from now, you'll look back on your all­nighters with wistful nostalgia ....

Tower questioned about defense ties 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON --Senate committees, working Thursday to fill vacancies at President Bush's Cabinet table, examined one nominee's relationships to defense con­tractors, heard another defend Bush's "flexible freeze" budget plan and got sugges­tions from a third on how he will manage America's open spaces. 
As the process unfolded, former Republican Sen. John Tower of Texas told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the $763,777 he made as a defense consultant over the past three years will not influ­ence his actions if he is con­firmed as Bush's secretary of defense. 
Michael Boskin, selected to be Bush's chief economic ad­viser, told the Senate Banking Committee he believes spend­ing cuts can be made in defense 
and health care spending and specific "flexible freeze" proposals when he addresses a joint meeting of Congress on Feb 9. 


Former Republican Rep. Manuel Lujan told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that he views the job of secretary of the interior as one of "stewardship" and will, if confirmed, try to enlist thousands of volunteers as bel­pers in the national park and fish and wildlife systems. 
The energy panel voted to en­dorse the Lujan nomination and sent it to the full Senate where a vote is expected next Wednesday. 
Tower, a former Armed Ser­vices Committee chairman, told that panel Congress should slow down the "revolving door" through which some top defense officials pass on the way to high-paying civilian jobs in the defense industry. 

Pentagon officials should be barred, Tower said, "from profiting unfairly, unethically, Dave Ureeland, Alan Silvidi, James Maurek, Brian and William Clark try out for the Keenan Revue.

Bush to travel to China soon 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON --President Bush, who served as envoy to China during the rule of Mao Tse-Tung, will spend two days in Beijing next month after visiting Japan and may extend his travels to other countries, the White House said Thursday. 
There was speculation South Korea also would be on his itinerary. 

"I don't have full dates of the trip yet in terms of starting and ending, but it's clearly in an ex­panding mode here," said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. 
On his first overseas trip, Bush will travel to Japan for the Feb. 24 funeral of Emperor Hirohito. He will spend Feb. 25­

Fitzwater left open the pos­sibility Bush would confer in Tokyo with other foreign leaders. 
"Obviously when a president goes to these kinds of events there are opportunities for bilateral meetings and obvi­ously there are a lot of countries who would like to have them, but we have to con­sider the time constraints in­volved in moving around --in this case moving on to China and protocol restraints associ­ated with the funeral,"

Two British hostages may soon be released 
Associated Press 
BEIRUT, Lebanon --Radio and press reports Thursday said the release of two British hostages might be imminent, and British Ambassador Allan Ramsay crossed into Moslem West Beirut. 
After Ramsay's return to the British Embassy, in the Chris­tian sector of the divided capi­tal, an embassy official said, "We have no additional infor­mation." 
Asked whether a hostage release was expected, he said, "All I can tell you is that we're not on alert.'' The official spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Earlier, when asked by tele­phone if his trip was linked to the press reports, Ramsay said from the British consular office in the Moslem sector: "I often come to west Beirut and there's nothing significant in my cur­rent visit." 
An embassy spokesman had said the purpose of Ramsay's 
journey  was to check  the  
reports.

Sakharov: Gorbachev will fall 
Associated Press 
PARIS --Soviet President 
Mikhail Gorbachev probably 
will be ousted because he has 
failed to seek popular support 
in direct elections, Andrei Sak­
harov and his wife were quoted 
as saying in an interview pub­
lished Thursday. 
"The conservatives will 
overthow Gorbachev or at least 
impose their views on him," 
the conservative French daily 
Le Figaro quoted Sakharov, 
the dean of the Soviet human 
rights movement, as saying. 
Le Figaro said the six-hour interview with Sakharov and his wife, Yelena Bonner, also a prominent rights activist, was conducted over three consecu­tive evenings at their Moscow home.

The newspaper quoted Bon­ner as saying: "The only real defense for a chief of state is direct election. Why is Gorbac­hev afraid? We would elect him. Our country has no other leader. 
"I think he will be over­thrown soon," she was quoted as saying. "I would not bet 10 rubles on Gorbachev." 
Bonner said that if Gorbac­hev is ousted, "so will (be) all those who believed in perestroika," his program to restructure Soviet society and its economy, the paper re­ported. 
Sakharov, who won theNobel Peace Prize in 1975, said the West must continue to pressure the Soviet Union on rights is­sues, at least until an interna­tional human rights conference that is scheduled in Moscow in 1991. 
He said the meeting, which initially was opposed by Brit­ain and the United States, "should only take place if the (human rights) situation in the Soviet Union is truly satisfac­tory." 
Le Figaro quoted Sakharov as saying that perestroika was "absolutely necessary. There is no other solution. This doesn't mean that you have to support Gorbachev without reservation. To associate perestroika 100 percent with his name would not be fair. 
"Gorbachev could come un­der pressure. He could have other ideas," Sakharov was quoted as saying.

Borelli said that he would seek funding from federal and state agencies as well as private endowments and foundations, and even private firms. 
Prior to this appointment, O'Meara said, individual teachers, groups, or students were forced to seek and apply for funding on their own. 
Borelli was chosen for the role because of his "excellent track record" in seeking fun­ding for the math department, said O'Meara. 
Because of the broad and somewhat ambiguous duties of the new position, Borelli is of­ficially on leave of absence from the university for a se­mester, and will teach only half of his regular load for the next three years. 
"I hope to be able to do this work and still do at least a min­imal amount of teaching," he said.

Furry jury sniffs at Soviet sausage 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW --Angry meat­packers are suing a newspaper for an article that said their sausage was so bad even cats can't stomach it, but editors said they turned to a furry, four-legged jury that proved their point. 
"Twenty-four sausage ex­perts don't eat it at all; five only eat high quality sausage or out of extreme hunger. Only one, the 2-month-old kitten Mura, you can say actually sits down to the sausage," the weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta said in announcing the feline findings. 
The dispute started with the literary weekly's story on June 15 titled "The Cat Doesn't Know ... " and was brought up recently in the Dzerzhinsky regional people's court. 
In a complaint signed by Yuri Luzhkov, chairman of the Mos­cow agroindustrial complex, officials demanded a retrac­tion of the newspaper's report that producers were breaking the law by putting protein ad­ditives in the sausage, known in Russian as "kolbasa." 
Because of a shortage of meat in many Soviet stores, fin­ding good quality sausage has become a fixation for many people. Acartoon in an October edition of the satire magazine 
ATTENTION MUSIC LOVERS 
AUDITIO~·lS for SMC-ND WIND ENSEMBLE 
WOO OWl NOS, BRASS and PERCUSSION 
Krokodil showed a line of shop­pers standing outside a theater, not to buy tickets but to buy the sausage for sale in the theater's buffet. 
The case also shows that the 
more aggressive style of 
reporting by the Soviet press 
under President Mikhail Gor­
bachev's encouragement of 
greater openness is likely to get 
it into occasional legal trouble. 
The Tass news agency said this 
week a court had dismissed a 
lawsuit against a film producer 
by a biochemical plant near 
Leningrad that objected to his 
documentary about pollution. 
Literaturnaya Gazeta re­
ported about its dispute with 
the sausage manufacturers in 
an article in this week's edition 
titled, "May the Cats Judge 
Us." It gave no indication that 
the case had gone any further 
than the initial complaint. 
It said that using the permis­sion of state quality control of­ficials to add protein additives, the factories were grinding up the skin and bones of cattle and throwing them into the sausage.

The athlete dying young upstaged everything and everyone, including President Reagan; and he's on his way to becoming, in the metamor­phosis of time, larger than life. How long will it be before those players begin to reverence Bob as a hero who blessed them with Christ-like insights by dying young and almost--so it may seem-­sacrificially? 
Maybe the soul-filled pres­ence of so many blacks at Mass made me imaginative. I wouldn't want to canonize Bob without due process. I did feel I was face-to-face with the black Christ at that memorial service. His eye was on the fallen athlete, and all through the Mass, I'm sure He was watching me as

A Valuable Summer Experience 
For most people, summer vacation brings to mind the beach, baseball games, and a boring job at the mall. Last summer, however, my mind was on soup kitchens, underprivileged pre­schoolers and migrant worker families. I had never even considered visiting Grand Rapids, Michigan, but a week after I returned home from school, I found myself going off to this unknown city to spend two months of my break on a Summer Service Project. 
Audrey George 
guest column 
My project turned out to be a little different from the norm. Most students remain at one site for the entire eight weeks. My project was more like the extended dance mix version of an Ur­ban Plunge, however, since it involved a number of different sites. My project sites included a Head Start program, a soup kitchen, migrant worker camps, and a public elementary school and church which both worked to meet the needs of the Hispanic and migrant families living in Grand Rapids. 
I spent two or three weeks at each of the sites, working either full or over­lapping half days at each. My tasks were as varied as my project sites. I worked as a teacher aide at Head Start, helped older Hispanic children with their English at the elementary school, and taught a Bible School class for the church. I also visited the different mi­grant camps surrounding the city and worked as a server and kitchen worker at the soup kitchen. 
As one can probably imagine, I had many different experiences and learned so many different things throughout the course of my eight week project. I was able to see how various service programs were run and learn what made them work. Further, by in­teracting with both the helpers and the helped in the different programs, I was able to learn the various reasons the workers were participating in these service programs and to see just what those being served got of out the pro­grams as well. 
The most important lesson that I learned, though, was taught to me by the children I worked with at Head Start. These were children who just wanted to know that they were loved. Many of them did not receive much in­dividual attention at home, and it was amazing to see how much just a little extra outside interest in their lives really meant to them. Nathan, for ex­ample, usually just neded a hug and a smile to keep him going. Jermaine and Ebony lived for the chance to tell some­one about the newest excitement in their lives, and Ryan just wanted to know that he was doing a good job. These little perks may not seem as if they would be all that effective or im­portant with anyone other than a small child, but as I was to find out, this is far from the truth. 

I was going through one of those days. Disaster after disaster seemed to be occurring--everything from two of the boys getting into a fist fight to one of the girls wetting her pants in the middle of a large group. I was feeling in­credibly overwhelmed and upset over all that was happening until I looked up and saw Christopher, a boy I had grown very close to, with a big, warm smile on his face. As simple and incon­sequential as it may seem, that smile changed my entire attitude. It reminded me, first of all, that someone really cared about me and would be there for support, and, secondly, that the rest of these kids were counting on me to be there for them and to help perk up their day. 
I cannot explain in words the effect that one little boy with a big heart had on me, but the thought of him still puts a huge smile on my face, and I know that I will never forget him or the lesson I learned from him. Though our society often seems overwhelming and uncon­querable, Chris and the rest of the chidren taught me that I cannot let myself get discouraged because every little bit really does count. 
If you are looking for a different way to spend part of your summer vacation, consider doing your own Summer Ser­vice Project. Applications are avail­able at the Center for Social Concerns and are due Feb. 1. Feel free to call the Center if you have any questions.

P.O. Box Q 

Court to review abortion issue 
Dear Editor: 
America has the opportunity to take a big step toward affirming the belief that human life is sacred. The United States Supreme Court has agreed to hear Webster v. Reproductive Health Services. With this case the court can set aside Roe v. Wade. 
Life begins at conception when the male sperm fertilizes the female ovum. Two and a half weeks after conception, the child's heart begins to beat. Bet­weeen six and eight weeks after con­ception, the child's organs are fully formed. Ten weeks after conception, the child feels pain. 
Since 1973, when abortion on demand was decriminalized in the United States, more than 23 million babies have been killed in hospitals and abor­tion clinics; that is, one abortion every 21 seconds. These babies are innocent and defenseless. 
Unborn babies are human beings. A society that denies them their right to

life cannot call itself civilized. 
With Webster v. Reproductive Health 
Services, the Supreme Court has the 
opportunity to reconsider its decision 
in Roe v. Wade. According to our legal 
system, the Court decides what is cor­
rect and what is incorrect. But no mat­
ter what the Court decides, we all have 
to account for our behavior before the 
tribunal of God. 
Please write to the justices of the Su­
preme Court, your congressional rep­
resentatives, and your state legislators 
to encourage the overturning of Roe v. 
Wade.

Workshop promotes social awareness 
Dear Editor: 
During the week of Jan. 6, we were among the 400 plus Notre Dame stu­dents who had the opportunity to devote 48 hours to cities across the country. Miami and New York were the sites we visited. Through the Urban Plunge we were brought face to face with the so­cial conditions prevalent in metropolitan areas, from the refugees in Krome Detention Center, Miami, to the homeless in the Bowery of Manhat­tan. We have become more aware of poverty and injustice; but now back at Notre Dame, many questions arise. How can we coordinate our experiences with the life we lead at this University? What are our opportunities for action? 

As one way to further pursue these questions, we would like to recommend the workshop "Values in Action" being held at the Center for Social Concerns this weekend, sponsored by the Com­munity for the Lay Apostulate (CILA). On Friday night from 6 to 8:30 p.m., the co-founder of Urban Plunge, Kathy 
Osberger, will be speaking. She will share her experiences working in Chile and Peru, and reflect with us on the importance of putting our values into action. On Saturday, Jan. 28, Father Mi­chael Himes will be speaking at 10 a.m. about defining and exploring values, followed by lunch and a panel discus­sion including several Notre Dame graduates. If you're seriously consid­ering how you should be living your values, this workshop will have a lot to offer you. In particular, if the Urban Plunge has given you more than 48 hours worth of experience to think about, please join us at the esc this weekend. Katie Clark Andrea Reilly Howard Hall Jan. 25, 1989

In life, we are never far from Christ, reminding us that we owe God a death.

Death is like a sacrament signifying that Christ is present, strengthen­ing the lad who leaves us with His grace.

Friday, January 27, 1989 The Observer 
Walsh resigns as 49er coach 
Defensive coordinator Seifert gets nod from DeBartolo 
Associated Press 
MONTEREY, Calif.--Bill 
Walsh went out a winner 
Thursday when he resigned as 
coach of the San Francisco 
49ers and joined Vince Lom­
bardi as the only coaches to 
step down after winning a 
Super Bowl. 
Walsh also won the power 
struggle with owner Eddie 
DeBartolo Jr. as the 49ers se­
lected defensive coordinator 
George Seifert as their new 
head coach. DeBartolo was 
reportedly interested in getting 
a well-known coach to take 
over, while Walsh lobbied hard 
for Seifert. 
Walsh will stay on with the 
49ers as executive vice presi­
dent for football operations. 
Walsh coached the 49ers to 
their third Super Bowl champi­
onship of the 1980s last Sunday, 
beating the Cincinnati Bengals 
20-16. 
Lombardi led Green Bay to 
victories in the first two Super 
Bowls (1967-1968) and then 
retired to the Packers' front of­
fice. He later returned as head 
coach of the Washington 
Redskins.
-
Relations between Walsh and DeBartolo have frequently been frosty. Last season, when the 49ers lost to Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs after compiling the league's best regular-season record, Walsh lost his team president title. 
But DeBartolo denied that there was a serious rift be­tween the two. 
Earlier this month, he told reporters, "That's the furthest thing from the truth that I could imagine. Bill and I are friends, good friends." 
Walsh, who held the 49ers' coaching position longer than anyone else and is only the team's fourth coach with a win­ning record, had strongly en­dorsed Seifert, a 49-year-old San Francisco native who has been a 49ers' defensive aide since 1980 and before that as­sisted Walsh at Stanford. 
Walsh, who ended his career with an overall record of 102­63-1, including playoff games, joined the 49ers in 1979 after two years as head coach at Stanford, where he compiled a 17-7 record and won bowls at the end of both seasons. 
In his first season, the stum­bling 49ers matched their 1978 record of 2-14. The following year they were 6-10. 
Then the fun began. 
In 1981, the 49ers, with Joe Montana out of Notre Dame at quarterback, went 13-3 and defeated Cincinnati in the Super Bowl. 
In strike-shortened 1982, the 49ers went 3-6. But they bounced back to 10-6 in 1983 and in 1984 went 15-1, winning their second Super Bowl with a resounding victory over the Miami Dolphins. 
They went 10-6 in 1985, 10_-5-1 in 1986 and 13-2 in 1987 but seeds of dissent between Walsh and DeBartolo were sown when San Francisco lost first-round playoff games all three 
seasons. 
Last season looked to be 
more of the same, and the 49ers 
at one point were just 6-5, 
embroiled in a nasty quarter­
back controversy and all but 
written off for the playoffs. 
But Montana returned to 
form and sent Steve Young to 
the bench, the team won four 
of its last five to go 10-6 in the 
regular season.

By BARBARA MORAN Sports Writer As men's Inter hall basketball action con­tinues, several teams have emerged as leaders in their respective divisions. Keenan Hall is currently in first place in the Big Sky divi­sion with a record of 4-0 after its recent 62-53 win over Flan­ner. Captain Steve McCarthy cites a combination of rebound­ing strength and hard practice as the reasons for Keenan's success. "Gary Anderson and Joe Hip­pler are great on the boards," said McCarthy,'' and Tony Dill is a tough point guard and de­fensive player. We have three games left and a good shot at winning the division." Keenan will attempt to hold their _fir~ I>l~ ~lot against

Irish hockey battles Canisius 1n weekend series 
By FRANK PASTOR Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame hockey team hopes to continue "doing the little things right" this weekend when it hosts Canisius in a two-game series at the Joyce ACC. 
Starting times for the Friday and Saturday games will be 7:30p.m. 
The Irish (7-21-2) have won three of their last four games, including last Saturday's 4-2 victory over Lake Forest. Ac­cording to Coach Ric Schafer, solid play away from the puck has been the key to Notre Dame's recent .string of vic­tories. 
"We've been paying particu­lar attention to the little things that make a difference," said Schafer, "Checking somebody away from the play, keeping them tied up so they can't break in for an open shot." 
"It's the plays away from the puck that win hockey games. We payed a little more atten­tion to that last Saturday night, and it payed dividends for us." 
Another factor that has con­tributed to Notre Dame's im­proved play is its increased

Right wing Tim Kuehl, who leads the Irish with 16 goals this season, has scored seven goals in his last four games. Left wing Matt Hanzel, Notre Dame's second-leading scorer with 15 goals, has netted eight goals in his last eight games.

Women's tennis battles Minnesota 
By CHRIS COONEY Sports Writer 
Two of the best women's ten­nis teams in the region will face off this Saturday when No.4 Notre Dame travels to Mil­waukee, Wis. to confront No.5 Minnesota. The Gophers are currently ranked fourth in the Big Ten. 
"We're going to have to give it everything we've got," said Irish head coach Michele Gelfman. "Our top players are just above theirs so the matches should be excellent." 
One such battle will occur when Notre Dame's No.1 player, CeCe Cahill, meets Minnesota's Ann Gordie. Cahill

is ranked fifth in the region while Gordie occupies the eighth position. 
The two have never played before and because they have such diverse styles, the out­come cannot be easily predicted. 
"CeCe is a baseliner, consis­tent, with finesse and a great lob,"said Gelfman. "Gordie, on the other hand, is a serve­and-volleyer. She's not afraid to approach the net and she has a sound midcourt game. Their opposing techniques should make the match exciting." 
In doubles, the top Irish com­bination of Cahill and Tracy Barton will take on Min­nesota's Gordie and Natalie weekend and then carry on from there." 
Canisius (10-6-1) is led by left wing Mike Sisti, who paces the team with 16 goals and 32 points. Right wing Dave Yablecki (8-15-23) and defen­seman Craig Jantzi (6-13-19) also play prominent roles for the Ice Griffs. Goalie Scott Diebold has posted a 9-5-1 record in 15 games this season, while giving up an average of

"We had two good games with them last year," said Schafer, referring to Notre Dame's 5-4 and 7-4 victories at 
Canisius. "They're a Division 
I hockey team as we are, but I 
don't think they have many 
scholarships, as we don't." 
"I think we're gonna have 
two good games this weekend. 
All we have to do is keep 
playing the way we did last Sat­
urday night." 
Notre Dame might have to play without the services of right wing Mark McClew this weekend. McClew has spent most of the week in the infir­mary and is listed as question­able for the weekend series. 
Breitag. Cahill and Barton are 
ranked sixth in the region while 
Gordie and Breitag are eighth. 
Notre Dame will be without No.4 singles player Kristy Doran, who is sick. The ad­justed line-up includes Cahill, followed by Barton, Katie Clark, Kim Pacella, Tyler Mus­leh and Natalie Illig. 
While the contest between Notre Dame and the Gophers is the first between the two schools, the Irish hold a 7-0 record over Marquette, the team they will face on Sunday. 
"I don't expect any problems with Marquette," said Gelfman. "Their best compet­itor will play Cahill and CeCe's beaten her before." 
The weekend matches are Notre Dame's first of the reg­ular season. The Irish hope to establish a winning pace right from the start. The team did not practice over winter vaca­tion; however, the women did play on their own. 
"Most of the girls played in tournaments and stuck to their lifting programs," said Gelfman. "Their break from school was not a break from tennis for them, so they are still on top of their games."

Notre Dame too, has its share of polished distance runners, as it's harriers finished ninth in the nation, so the distance races should be the highlight of the tri-meet. 
"All three teams are strong in that area," said Irish assis­will try to repeat his perfor­mance against Loyola in which he tallied two first place finishes with 48.03 in the 400­meter dash and a 23.37 in the 200-meter dash. 
Searcy, who qualified for the IC4As in both events, will be joined in the sprinting corps by sophomore Robert Harris and a freshman speedster better known for his rocket-like speed on the football field than on the track--Raghib Ismail. 
The Irish will also be looking their field events to help rack up points tomorrow, especially sophomore John Cole who took first place and qualified for the IC4As in the high jump with a leap of 6-10. 
"I'm really excited about IC4As," said Cole, "but I still want to jump 7-() to make NCAAs. This weekend should help me do that too, because of the great competition, espe­cially from guys like Bruce Reynolds from Wisconsin." 
Fellow sophomores Jeff Smith, who won the long jump with a leap of 22-9 1/.! and finished fourth in the triple jump and Jim Varga, who won the 55-meter high hurdles with a time of 7.81 will need to turn in another strong performance. 
Junior Chris Bush and fresh­man Marc deManigold brought home wins against Loyola and will try tally another victory Saturday against Wisconsin and Iowa State. 
"We're not looking past this weekend," said Cole, "but we consider it more important right now to use the meet as a preparation for the bigger meets down the road rather than for the sake of a victory. Itwill be a good chance to mark our progress and try to get as many people qualified for fu­ture meets."

does not mean less of a chal­
lenge for the Irish. 
"Their record this year is no 
indication of how well they're 
able to play in a game," Phelps 
said. "Knowing how good a co­
ach John Chaney is, and 
knowing how good Vreeswyk 
and Macon are as players, 
they'll shoot the ball as well as 
anybody we play. 
"They'll play smart defense, 
that match-up zone which 
they've done for years. I think 
we'll have to play with a lot of 
concentration. We have to 
know where the shooters are as 
well as where the gaps are." 
Temple looks for the deep 
jump shot frequently, hitting 
110 of 277 three-point tries this 
season, led by Macon (28-of-80) 
and Vreeswyk (47-of-112). Ot­
her starters for the Owls are 
6-6 forward Ernest Pollard, 6-7 
freshman forward Mik Kil­
gore, and 6-11 center Duane 
Causwell, who leads the team 
with 9.1 rebounds per game. 
Notre Dame may be without 
the services of junior co­
captain Jamere Jackson, who 
hyperextended his knee in a 
collision with teammate 
LaPhonso Ellis against Rut­
gers Tuesday night. Jackson 
did not practice Thursday, and 
his status is day-to-day. With­
out him, the Irish will look to 
two freshman guards from 
Texas, Elmer Bennett and 
Daimon Sweet. 
"If (Jackson) doesn't go, 
we've got to go with Elmer or 
Daimon," Phelps said. "We'll 
see what happens. The Texas 
Express is ready to go. 
"We're getting our depth to play with confidence. I think that's starting to show. The other night when Jamere got hurt, Sweet came off the bench and scored 15. We want to get eight or nine guys playing in that rhythm we want to play." 
Sophomore forward Kevin Ellery, who has missed action because of an outstanding grade, was still in limbo Thursday, with no decision yet being made on his eligibility. 
Rounding out the starters for the Irish will be forwards Ellis and Keith Robinson and guards Joe Fredrick and Tim Singleton.

Sweet gets out on the spot 
Irish freshman responds with 15 points against Rutgers 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Assistant Sports Editor 
Notre Dame basketball fans 
knew what they were losing 
when Jamere Jackson, one of 
their team's most consistent 
players, hyperextended his 
knee Tuesday night against 
Rutgers. ­
But they probably had no 
idea what they were getting in 
return. · 
Daimon Sweet, a 6-5 fresh­
man from Beaumont, Tex., 
who had scored a total of 22 
points in Notre Dame's first 11 
games, replaced Jackson and 
scored 15 points in his 31 
minutes on the floor. Sweet's 
performance helped turn what 
had been a close game into an 
85-63 Notre Dame runaway. 
"Daimon Sweet played his 
best game as far as playing 
time and quality playing 
time," said Irish coach Digger 
Phelps. "He did some good 
things that don't show up in the 
box score. When Jamere got 
hurt, Sweet made a lot of things 
happen for us." 
While Sweet's performance 
surprised many observers who 
had not seen him on the court 
yet for an extended period of 
time, it did not catch any of his 
teammates off guard. 
"He's been playing like that 
all year in practice," said Irish 
guard and co-captain Joe 
Fredrick. "It's just a matter of 
confidence. He played well, 
and we'll need him for the big 
games down the stretch." 
Sweet, who is seeing playing time at both guard and for­ward, is emerging as a major factor coming off the Irish bench at about the same time as classmate and fellow Texan Elmer Bennett. 
"I think Sweet and Bennett

clock buzzer. Further, the Irish inside strength took over, as Nowlin and sophomore Krissi Davis each scored nine in the half. 
"We started out well," said McGraw. "But then we just seemed to get lethargic. That one spurt was impressive." 
Simply, Xavier had trouble with the athleticism of the Irish team. Robinson's quickness on the press, Nowlin's strength and finesse inside, Davis' quick hands (five steals) and Com­alita Haysbert's speed on the break combined to run the Lady Musketeers (6-11) back to Ohio. 
Notre Dame, now 11-5 on the season and a perfect 5-0 in the MCC, will host Dayton on Sat­urday at 2:00 p.m. in another MCC contest. 

are getting more confidence as the season goes on," said Phelps. "As freshmen, I think they're doing an outstanding job to add to the back court." 
The two teammates, who both come from the Houston area, are were not exactly strangers before arriving at Notre Dame. 
Bennett, who led the state of Texas in scoring during his junior and senior seasons at Houston Bellaire High, met Sweet at the BCI (Basketball Congress International) All­Star Camp after both players had completed their junior years in high school. That started a friendship between the two players both on and off the court. 
"We'd been playing together on national teams, traveling to­gether and playing with the Greater Houston all-star team," said Sweet. "He (Bennett) was the main influ­ence on my decision to come here." 
Sweet almost went elsewhere for college basketball without even giving Notre Dame a second look. He had verbally committed to Southern Meth­odist and was waiting for his SAT scores to arrive when he decided to start looking at some other schools. 
About that time, the star of Beaumont Central High received a phone call from a friend in Houston. 
"Notre Dame really wasn't interested in me at first," said Sweet. "Elmer called me one night and said, 'Guess what, Notre Dame's interested in you. Coach (John) Shumate said he was going to give you a call this week.' 
"He (Shumate) called, and I was ovwerwhelmed by the fact he did call," Sweet continued. "We arranged a visit to come to the Notre Dame campus I came up one weekend, and I had a pretty nice time. I believe Fr. Malloy was here. I met him, Prof. DeCicco and a couple of other influential people. When I returned ·home, I decided to attend Notre Dame." 
Shumate, the Irish assistant coach last year who recruited Notre Dame's talented five­player freshman class, now is the new head coach at Southern Methodist. Ironically, Sweet's recent progress dates back to last week's 67-45 win over the school he almost attended and the coach who lured him away. 
"It was an emotional game, but I tried not to let it affect me," said Sweet. "I try to put those things aside when I'm playing. If you have a lot of things on your mind when you're playing and worry about anything besides basketball, it tends to mess you up." 
Since that time, Sweet has scored four points in 11 minutes against Syracuse, poured in 15 against Rutgers and even has earned one new nickname. Longtime Notre Dame public address announcer Jack Lloyd has started following Sweet baskets with the call "Nutra­Sweet." 
"People have given me a lot of nicknames, 'Too Sweet,' 'Brown Sugar,' all kinds of stuff," said Sweet, whose last name evidently is easy fodder for people who make up such things. "but I never heard this before." 
If Sweet continues to prog­ress like he has in the last two weeks, Notre Dame fans could be hearing it an awful lot over the next few ears.

Mike Harmon, Class of 1988 
No, Harmon's poem will never make the up­dated version of "Wake up the Echoes" as a legacy to Notre Dame's 1988 championship football season. It didn't even make The Observer, until now. 
In fact, it might soon be on its way to a trash can across the office--just another balled up piece of paper with three-point potential for a procras­tinating sports writer. 
But before anything gets cleaned up around here, some of the mail we've smiled at, shown to our friends and filed away deserves to be honored in print. Here it is, live and (mostly) uncensored: 
An Ode to Old Mail:

Much better than Harmon's in rhyme, meter and all those other poetry terms you learned in high school, but we like the humor, intentional or not, of "Ode to Rodney" a little better.

We also received mail from the Gipper himself during football season, straight from the steps of Washington Hall. That's right, the real one. Or at least his ghost. He's probably almost as old as our former President by now. 
George (he said I could call him that) had been reading Irish Extra on Fridays and had noticed how incompetent The Observer's "Peerless Prog­nosticators" were at beating the point spread on college football games. He wanted a chance to be omore Karen Robinson each scored a pair of buckets in the spurt, which led to a Musketeer time-out. Notre Dame ex­tended that 17-point lead to as many as 21 during the half, before McGraw began sub­stituting liberally. 
Senior guard Lisa Kuhns put an exclamation mark on the second half with three long­range bombs to go along with two others in the first half. Her 5-7 shooting combined with Nowlin's 7-10 helped the Irish to a .560 shooting mark for the game. 
The Irish seemed to grab con­trol of the game from the opening tap, though they held only a four point lead with as little as 4 : 30 remaining in the first half. Robinson, who was celebrating her 20th birthday, combined her fast-paced floor leadership a11d flashy passing with Nowlin's power game to keep the Irish in the lead.

Remembering that Gipp was quite a gambler in his day, we decided we couldn't stand being humiliated by another celebrity. We had Elvis Presley pick the games instead, and the King was 5-8-1. He only beat us by a few games. 
Some even send photos. Two were shots of cus­tomized license plates that included the word "IRISH" in some form or another. Talk about radi­cal. 
But by the time you read this (assuming you've made it this far), many of these memories will be gone. All but "Ode to Rodney," which we're keeping for inspirational purposes.

What a gem. 
PICK OF THE WEEK: This week's pick is not a game, but a name. Help ban the Joyce ACC public address announcer's "Nutraaaaa Sweet" by com­ing up with a less foolish nickname for Irish fresh­man Daimon Sweet. There's got to be something better. Write or call The Observer sports depart­ment with your suggestion and we'll put it to a vote. 
close, despite a pesky Irish press and an aggressive 2-3 zone. The Lady Musketeers boasted the MCC Player of the Week in Kelly Benintendi and the MCC three-point percentage leader in Kim Blan­ton, but it was a third guard, senior Kerry Durham, who kept Xavier close with six first half points from the outside, key passes, and tough defense. 
"We were keying on 20 (Benintendi) and 3 (Blanton)," said McGraw, "and the other girl <Durham) wound up hur­ting us. It was kind of our (the coaches) fault." 
After a 6-0 Lady Musketeer run to close the score to 24-20 Irish and an Irish time-out, Notre Dame finished the half strongly for a 35-24 lead. The run highlighted a number of Irish strengths in the game. Xavier was consistently forced to rush shots at the 30-second

ketball team faces the Temple Owls Sunday afternoon, it will be another in a series of "big games" for the Irish. 
"I think we're fortunate enough to be able to schedule power games," Irish head co­ach Digger Phelps said. "That gives us an opportunity to take this young team and let them play people, let them get used to what it's going to be like for them come March." 
Playing teams like the Owls is like training camp for the young Irish, who probably will start two freshmen, one sopho­more and two juniors when the game gets underway at 4 p.m.
