Anton Masin remembered as a lover of literature and of reading 
By JOHN LUCAS 
Associate News Editor 
Professor Anton Masin loved watching students learn. 
In his 20 years at Notre Dame, Masin's experiences with the Freshman Writing 
Program led 
him  to  
become  a  
teacher  of  

Humanities Seminar. There. Masin devoted him­self to improv­ing the writ­


ing of his stu-Masin dents, while also teaching the books he cherished. 
After a two year battle with cancer, Masin died on Sunday. lie is survived by his wife Madeline and his daughters, Melissa and Melanie. 
"While his life seemed to be cut short, in God's perfect plan, Anton was blessed that he died surrounded by loved ones, hon­ored by friends and respected by students and colleagues," said Father Richard Jenke, rec­tor of Sacred Heart Basilica and euologist at yesterday's memorial mass. 
In his many interests, Masin was unique that he was able to combine many subjects in the Humanities Seminar and teach them all with equal ease. 
"He was a lover of literature, languages, philosophy and the­ology," said Edward Kline, di­rector of the Freshman Writing Program. "Many people know about these subjects, but Anton was gifted because he had the ability to put them all togeth­er." 
A native of Brooklyn, New York, Masin received his Bachelor's Degree from Brooklyn College while also re­ceiving graduate degrees from Pratt Institute and Notre Dame, where he worked in communi­cations and art.

House passes NAFTA proposal 
Associated Press 
The House rendered its ver­dict after a day-long debate that reflected high-minded dis­agreements over America's role in the world economy and bare-knuckled politics. Scores of labor-backed Democrats abandoned their president to oppose the accord, but 132 Republicans signed on to as­sure passage. 
The 34-vote margin was far wider than anticipated, the re­sult of a furious last-minute lobbying blitz that blended presidential phone calls with concessions to key lawmakers concerned about the pact's im­pact on a variety of domestic industries. 
A cheer went up in the cham­ber when the vote count passed the 218 needed to approve the pact. Opponents stood in clumps, shaking their heads and grimacing at the result. 
The House was packed with lawmakers; the spectators' gallery that rings the chamber was filled. 
"A vote for NAFTA is in the great tradition of our party," House GOP Leader Bob Michel of Illinois said in a ringing speech of support. "So let it be said on this crucial vote tonight, that we Republicans did not sacrifice the jobs of tomorrow to the fears of today." 
Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt summed up for the opponents who fear the pact will throw thousands of Americans out of work. "Deficient and flawed," he said of NAFTA, "We cannot and must not expose our workers and our corporations to unfair competition." 
The accord would create a continental free-trade zone by gradually eliminating tariffs over 15 years. All industries would be affected, from fruits and vegetables to banking and

Administration officials and some lawmakers also said a fa­vorable vote would strengthen Clinton's hand as he departs for Seattle on Thursday -and would lead to freer trade with Europe and all of South America, as well. 
For his part, Clinton said he hoped he and Congress could build on the bipartisan coop­eration that carried NAFTA to passage. He also reached out to those who had opposed him. "They have my respect," he said.

Cavanaugh will convert to female residence hall 
By SARAH DORAN 
Assistant News Editor 
Cavanaugh Hall will be con­verted to a female residence hall, effective fall 1994, to ac­commodate the University's gender-blind admissions policy, which has resulted in a larger enrollment of women since it went into effect two years ago, the office of student affairs announced last night. 
Cavanaugh rector Father Merwyn Thomas was informed of the decision by Patricia O'Hara, vice president for stu­dent affairs, late yesterday af­ternoon and dorm residents received the news via a letter from O'Hara soon afterwards. A dorm meeting was held last night. 
"I received the same letter that residents did last night and it was the first time that I had heard about the conversion," said Thomas, who is in his first year as rector. "I was only aware through the rumor that Cavanaugh was being consid­ered." 
The decision was made en­tirely by the office of student affairs, without consultation of Thomas or other hall staffs, he said. 
In spite of recognizing the University's need for additional female residences, the selection of Cavanaugh for conversion is difficult for its residents, including Thomas, to accept. 
"I understand why more room is necessary for females, but it doesn't make accepting the administration's choice any easier," he said. 
"Its unfortunate to lose all the tradition," said Cavanaugh co­president John Bingham. "At a school like Notre Dame where tradition is such a huge thing, they seem to be just killing it." 
Freshmen echoed similar sentiments. 
"It's unfortunate," said fresh­man Kevin Shay, whose father and uncle were also Cavanaugh residents. "The whole purpose of a four year dorm is to build unity, but that's all over now." 
"The decision stunned me," said freshman Brandon Leveille. "The fact is that we didn't do anything wrong to de­serve this." 
Juniors who were intent on becoming resident assistants in Cavanaugh next year were also hit hard by the announcement. 
"My hope right now is to try to be an R.A. in another dorm, but it won't be the same," said Chris Fischer. "I was hoping I could be here for the guys in Cavanaugh." 
"Right now I still intend to apply, but I don't want to be an 
R.A. in a dorm where I don't know anybody," he said. "(The conversion) just really cuts down on my chances of becom­ing an R.A." 
At the dorm meeting held last night to inform residents of the conversion, Bingham stressed the importance of behavior to Cavanaugh residents as they reacted to the University's de­cision. 
"Cavanaugh has always been seen as a dorm with class, and we must maintain that," he said. "We focused on behavior so that we don't make the last memeries people have of Cavanaugh negative." 
"The staff wants to work with us on easing the end of the year," said Bingham. "We would like to think that it is un­necessary worrying on our part, but naturally with news like this, people will think they are entitled to some kind of freedom."

Champs? We're not worthy 

This year's Notre Dame football team has undoubt­edly proven that it is the best team to this date, and more importantly, that it is a contender for the nation­al championship. It would be wonderful for the play­


ers to achieve this coveted  David Hungeling  
position.  The team has  Accent Photo Editor  
worked hard all year, and  
a national championship  

would be a fitting reward for its efforts. 
However, I wonder if the Notre Dame student body is completely worthy of sharing this honor. I, regrettably, think we are not. 
When I remember past championships and how different schools reacted, I cannot help but wish our school could show the same amount o enthusiasm. I recall my senior year in high school (1991) in Atlanta when the Yellow Jackets of the Georgia Institute of Technology went undefeated and split the national champi­onship with Colorado. 
On January 2, 1991, following the release o the poll results, a number of Tech students marched into an empty Bobby Dodd Stadium and removed one of the goal posts. The stu­dents then proceeded to carry the goal post out into the middle of an adjacent street and light it on fire. The blaze came very close to getting out of control, and grew hot enough to melt the traffic signals hanging above it. What followed was an endless display of enthusiasm and school spirit in the form of huge parties, over­consumption of alcohol and other drugs, naked­ness and mass fornication. 
This is exactly the kind of behavior expected from students of national championship-caliber schools. 
How would another school react if it just beat the undefeated Seminoles? Every other school in America would have ignored its scholastic and moral obligations to take part in week-long displays of debauchery. 
Notre Dame, however, is not like any other school. Sure it partied hard last Saturday night, but by dinner time Sunday students were back to their normal routines. People wrote papers, studied for tests, and did their homework as i nothing was different. Notre Dame students place too high a priority on insignificant things like grades and future employment opportuni­ties, and most will reluctantly admit it. 
That is why we are jealous of schools which lack massive intellectual capacity, and other­wise aim at underachievement. These are the sehools which know how to party. These are the schools which graduate the kind of people we wish we were more like. These are the schools which go hog wild after big wins, and create small scale disasters after champi­onships. Notre Dame could learn a lot from these such schools. 
Georgia Tech taught the entire country a valuable lesson about what it means to be a national champion. Despite the fact that it is an Institute of Technology, a name which pro­claims its geekiness, its students were able to disregard all respect for authority and morality to engage in raucous displays of school spirit and celebration. 
The challenge is ours, Notre Dame. I know we can do it.

Three killed in explosion at closed Aurora explosives plant 
AURORA, Minn. 
A blast at a closed explosives plant killed three people Wednesday and shook buildings for miles around. The explosion at the defunct Viking Explosives & Supply Inc. leveled a building where explosives used to be kept. Two smaller buildings were badly damaged. Three members of a demolition crew that was working outside at the plant were found dead, said Lt. Randy Lehman of the St. Louis County sheriffs department. Their identities were not released. "There's all kinds of huge pieces of shrap­nel lying around, building parts, burnt explosive residue. It's strewn in the trees and several hundred feet from the scene -pieces of metal, insulation," he said. The plant is located in an ore mining region. The blast shattered windows and shook buildings up to 10 miles away. Investigators were searching the rubble for the source of the explosion. Authorities speculated that leftover chem­icals could have caused the blast. Mick Lownds, techni­cal director for Hibbing-based Viking, said the part of the plant where the crew had been working was believed to be empty. "We don't know if it was caused by explo­sives," he said. "We just don't know." 
Tammy Faye starts 900 help line number 
RANCHO MIRAGE 
The former Tammy Faye Bakker is starting up a help line for despondent people, saying she knows what true misery is like. The ex-wife of impris­oned religious broadcaster Jim Bakker told ABC-TV's "PrimeTime Live" in an interview for broadcast Thursday that she pities sad people. Married last month to Kansas developer Roe Messner, she said the 900 line will have 

a new message each day. "I hope that people that are hurting will call in and .. .I can maybe somehow through my experience help them get up that day, put on makeup, shave, brush their teeth and get out and not just stay hovered in the house," she said. During the PTL scandal she cried incessantly, she said. "You didn't even want to walk out of the house. You wanted to just stay curled in bed and never show your face again as long as you live," she said. Bakker was convicted in 1989 of cheating PTL followers of more than $150 million. The scandal came to light after he was accused of having sex with church secretary Jessica Hahn. 
Court upholds woman in citadel classes 
CHARLESTON 
A woman may attend classes with cadets at The Citadel while her lawsuit challenging the military college's all­male admissions policy is heard, an appeals court ruled Wednesday. Shannon Faulkner's lawsuit says The Citadel's all-male corps is unconstitutional. She would be the first women to attend day classes with cadets in The Citadel's 151-year history. Women are allowed in night and summer classes. "They told me and I was hopping and hollering. I just screamed. I mean, oh my goodness, I can't believe this," Faulkner said. "This is the school I want to get my education from," she told reporters in Spartanburg while wearing a navy blue Citadel sweat­shirt. "My ultimate goal is to get into the Corps of Cadets. I won't stop fighting that battle." U.S. District Judge Weston Houck ruled in August that Faulkner could attend day classes, but not participate in the military pro­gram until her lawsuit was resolved. No trial date has been set; the lawsuit will be heard in Houck's court. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., upheld Houck's order Wednesday, lawyers for Faulkner and The Citadel said.

Eleven people sickened by carbon monoxide fumes from a clogged space heater owe their lives to an tO­year-old boy. Anthony Mojica was dropped off by his mother before school Tuesday at a two-family home. When no one answered his knock, he said, "I looked in the window and saw people throwing up." "They were vomiting on the floor and couldn't get up." lie ran to a friend's house and told him to call 911. "There's no doubt this kid saved their lives," said 6th Battalion Fire Chief Thomas Barrett. 
Jet averts accident at O'Hare during landing 
CHICAGO 

A Continental Airlines jetliner with 88 people aboard came so close to landing without its wheels down that its belly scraped the runway, federal investigators said today. An accident at O'Hare International Airport was averted Monday afternoon only because another pilot noticed the plane's landing gear wasn't down. "It was a potential disaster in the making," said Michael Benson, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board in Washington. The plane was a few feet off the ground when an American Airlines pilot flying behind the Boeing 727 noticed its wheels were not down and radioed the control tower. The tower immediately ordered the Continental jet to abort the landing. The rear third of the plane's underside scraped against the runway as the pilot pulled up for another try. No one was hurt, but the con­tact left holes in the fuselage, Benson said.

"'lbeyasked me to write thiS ad. They didn't tell me what to say." 
My name is Scott Schuster. My employer, Ernst &Young, asked me to help with a recruitment ad. I guess it made sense. I was just finishing my first year here. And, having been fairly heavily recruited myself, I was familiar with the situation. 
Yes, I too had heard the words of romance. The flattery. The promises. In short, the usual lines from the usual big firms. And, like you, Iwondered what, if anything, it all meant Was it real? Were these people sincere? So, in the interest of heightened reality, I thought I'd comment on life in alarge firm one year later, at least as I've experienced it at Ernst & Young. 
I found that while Iwas prepared for a lot of things, one that I certainly didn't expect was the sense of common purpose and teamwork here. Some of you may not find this such a big deal, at least right now. But for me, the camaraderie has made this year immensely productive, and enjoyable. The philosophy atE& Y is that, first and foremost, our goal is problem solving and helping our clients. In practice, this means teamwork with a lot of very seasoned veterans. The result I've learned more about public accounting, tax and consulting in one year than I thought was humanly possible. The opportunity to intern yourself to virtually any practice group in the firm is real. I've already taken advan­tage of it and I plan to do more of it Ifs a tremendous way to gain entirely new areas of knowledge and experience before I decide which area I want to settle into. 
I also get the sense that while the firm is incredibly important to everyone, it isn't the only thing in their lives. So, while I can't claim Ernst & Young is right for everyone, it was a very good choice form~. Ifbeing in an environment that actually fosters creativity sounds appealing, Ernst & Young may also be right for you. And, ifbeing with people among whom there's a genuine spirit of collegiality is attractive, Ernst & Young may be right for you too. Ifthe idea of having a real opportunity to decide on the career thatyou want sounds refreshing, believe me, it is. 
And, of course, ifthe idea of a firm that would let aguy like me write my own ad sounds out of the ordinary, Ernst & Young is definitely for you. Who knows? Next year, you might be the one writing this ad.

league in the Freshman Writing Program. "I don't know if people say that any­more, but it's an old fashion way of saying that he really loved literature and reading." 
A disciple of the great books philosophy that stresses a lib­eral exposure to the classics of many different periods, Masin strove to teach the traditional learning of the books he loved. 
"God forbid that I ever men­tion Anton in the same sen­tence as Jim Morrison, but he was never one to 'break on through to the other side,"' Moran said. 
"His hope was to provide an atmosphere for students to develop traditionally." 
Masin's love of the classics helped shape the Freshman Writing Program, as he tried to maintain a traditionalist ap­proach to literature for the Humanities Seminar. 
"He was always our guardian against the fads of the day," Kline said. "lie would not let us stray from the great books. He wanted us to stay true to the concepts of a liberal educa­tion." 
Outside of books, Masin's greatest love was his students. His students and his Humanities Seminar classes were always an inspiration to him, according to Masin's widow Madeline. 
"He was very fond of his freshmen," Madeline Masin said. "They kept him on his toes and challenged him." 
In addition to his work in the Freshman Writing Program, Masin was an accomplished li­brarian who once served as cu­rator of the llesburgh Library's Rare Book Room. 
Masin was the primary force behind the cataloging of sever­al rare collections, as well the promotion of the room as a tool for learning, according to Thomas Jemielity, professor of English. "lie was the first pro­fessional to recognize the value of the room," said Jemielity said. "lie always had a real ability to put together exhibits to attract audiences of a diverse constituency." 
During his illness, Masin's Catholic faith helped him through to the end, Madeline Masin said. 
"When you would ask him 'Anton, how are you doing?' you would expect him to say 'I'm OK, or Oh, I'm fine,"' said Kline. "But he never said that. !lis answer was always 'My faith is strong."'

Countered Rep. Corrinne Brown, D-Fla.: "This NAFTA is a job killer." 
Union workers and other foes of NAFTA staged one final, for­lorn rally in the rain outside the Capitol. 
Some held up a banner that read: "That giant sucking sound -pro-NAFTA careers, 11-3-94," a reference to de­termination to defeat NAFT A supporters in next year's con­gressional elections. 
"We are on the right side of this issue," said AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland in a post-vote statement. 
A knot of Greenpeace demon­strators briefly disrupted the House debate in late afternoon, raining mock dollar bills down on debating lawmakers. Four protesters were arrested. 
Supporters said the agree­ment would open up a vast new Mexican market to American goods. 
Opponents said the certain result was a loss of jobs as American firms move to Mexico to take advantage of lower wages and lax worker safety and environmental regulations. 
Negotiated by the Bush ad­ministration and modified through side agreements by the Clinton administration, the pact turned customary political alliances on their head. 
Republican leaders said in advance they stood ready to provide a majority of the votes needed for passage -as long as Democrats delivered 100 of their 258 members -and noted ironically that Clinton would be the principal political beneficiary. Democrats deliv­ered 102 votes. 
Democrats were more deeply split as two senior House lead­ers and dozens of labor-backed lawmakers broke with their president. 
Clinton recently denounced labor for using "roughshod, muscle-bound tactics" by threatening to withhold support from any Democratic voting for the accord. 
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland fired back, saying Clinton was "clearly abdicating his role" as leader of the Democratic party by agreeing to tell Republican supporters that Democrats wouldn't make

NAFTA a 1994 campaign issue. 
Joining the opponents was Ross Perot, who said approval of the agreement could lead to establishment of a third politi­cal party. 
The tensions were evident as the vote neared. 
Angered by a suggestion from Rep. Gerald Solomon that White House dealing had secured his vote, Rep. Pat Roberts of Kansas challenged his fellow Republican: "You. Sir, have fired a shotgun of fear at me and I resent it." 
"This is a painful vote," said Rep. Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who said he had to "respectfully disagree" with many of his labor and Democratic allies. NAFTA is an "opportunity, not a reason to panic. We have the most pro­ductive workers in the world," he said. 
Angered by attacks on Mexico's human rights record, Rep. Kika de Ia Garza, D-Texas, denounced "the way the people of Mexico have been depicted, the way the government of Mexico has been insulted. That really shouldn't be the issue." 
Opponents seemed to hold the upper hand in the NAFTA struggle until the final few days. By then, persistent efforts to appease Congress' concerns over local issues began to pay off, resulting in a rush of sup­port for the pact. 
Many of the late agreements were designed to protect spe­cific industries from harm as Mexican goods were allowed into the country -products ranging from winter tomatoes to wheat to Oat glass to textiles. 
Not every concession had to do with trade. 
Rep. E. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., announced his support for the pact after Mexico pledged it would extradite a Mexican man accused of abducting and rap­ing a young girl in southern California.

The University converted Pangborn Hall in the fall of 1992 in response to the admis­sions policy, which has been in effect for two years. 
As a result of this policy, Notre Dame admitted 44 to 45 percent women and 55 to 56 percent men in the current freshmen and sophomore class­es. This percentage mix is tar­geted for future classes.

Appellate Court rules evidence was withheld 
By JOHN NOLAN 
Associated Press 
CINCINNATI 
The government withheld evidence that could have helped John Demjanjuk fight extradition to Israel, an appeals court ruled today in a decision that bolstered his fight to regain his U.S. citizen­ship. 
The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned its own order authorizing Demjanjuk's extradition to Israel in 1986, saying the order was tainted because of prosecutorial misconduct that amounted to fraud. 
Government lawyers "acted with reckless disregard for the truth" in arguing that Demjanjuk was the guard "Ivan the Terrible" at the Treblinka death camp in Nazi­occupied Poland. 
Today's ruling clears the way for Demjanjuk to fight a 1981 ruling by U.S. District Judge Frank Battisti in Cleveland that stripped him of his U.S. citizenship. 
Attorney General Janet Reno said today she couldn't comment on the decision until she read it. Department spokesman John Russell said the government remains con~ vinced that Demjanjuk committed war crimes dl.lring World War II and would seek to deport him. 
"The department is revi~""" ing its appellate options, ahd intends, as previously stated, to effect Demjanjuk's prompt removal from the Unit(ld states as soon as his legal sta" tus is resolved," Russell said. 
The retired Cleveland au~. toworker returned to the United States in September af­ter the Israeli Supreme Court overturned his 1988 convi<;~ tion and death sentenCe, based on evidence that some­one else was "Ivan the Terrible." He had been spent more than seven years in an Israeli prison. 
"Justice has been done and God bless America," said Ed Nishnic, Demjanjuk's son-in­law and family spokesman. 




Negotiators agree to reform army 
By JOHN DANISZEWSKI 
Associated Press 
JOHANNESBURG 
The government and African National Congress agreed today on the final outstanding issues of their two-year talks, clearing the way for F.W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela to sign a revo­lutionary pact creating a color­blind South Africa. 
Other black and white groups at the talks were considering the latest ANC-government agreements, with all the 21 po­litical parties expected to ap­prove them tonight. 
The signing ceremony, origi­nally scheduled for this morn­ing, was repeatedly delayed as negotiators struggled to wrap up work on an interim constitu­tion that will treat blacks and whites equally for the first time since Dutch merchants arrived in 1652. 
Talks had progressed rapidly overnight after a meeting in Pretoria between de Klerk, now likely a lame-duck president, and ANC leader Mandela, the former anti-apartheid political prisoner expected to take the country's helm after the first multiracial election April 27. 
With negotiators in an ebul­lient mood, champagne was put on ice for toasts to celebrate the historic pact. The snags emerged this morning. 
Observers said the agree­ments reached this morning represented concessions by both sides aimed at completing the protracted negotiations and satisfying demands by an al­liance of pro-apartheid whites and conservative black groups boycotting the talks. 
A joint statement from the government and the ANC said decisions by the first post­apartheid Cabinet would be made in a "consensus-seeking spirit," indicating they were unable to agree on exactly how many votes would be needed to adopt policy. 
Parties will be awarded Cabinet posts according to the number of parliament seats they win in the April election. The ANC, which could win more than half the vote, sought a simple majority for Cabinet decisions that would permit it to govern alone. 
De Klerk's governing National Party, likely to finish second in the balloting, wanted at least a two-thirds majority. 
The two sides also agreed a final constitution would have to be approved by 60 percent of the lawmakers chosen in the April. 

The package involved an in­terim constitution and bill of rights, an electoral law, and legislation establishing inde­pendent broadcasting authori­ties, a 400-member national assembly, a 90-member senate, nine regions with their own leg­islatures and a multiparty Cabinet headed by a president and at least one vice president. 
After its approval by the mul­tiparty negotiators, it will be sent to the last session of the all-white parliament, which sits Monday, for its rubber stamp. Approval is certain. 
Issues approved overnight included a plan to reform the army by integrating it with el­ements of black anti-apartheid forces, and setting out a two­tier police system, with police answerable to regional gover­nors in addition to the national police. 
The council also approved a resolution to reincorporate into South Africa four so-called "independent" black home­lands, created in apartheid's vain attempt to permanently separate blacks and whites.

Ninth Israeli soldier killed since signing of agreement 
By HAITHAM HAMAD 
Associated Press 

NAHAL OZ. Gaza Strip 
A Palestinian stabbed to death an Israeli soldier today as troop reinforcements were moved into the occupied terri­tories to contain the growing violence. 
Twenty-four Palestinians and nine Israelis have been killed since the Israel-PLO accord was signed Sept. 13, and the latest flare-up is threatening to erode support for the peace talks. 
The escalation comes at a time when Israeli and Palestinian negotiators report progress in the Cairo talks on implementing the autonomy agreement. Self-rule is to be­gin in mid-April in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, visiting Canada, said the attacks would not sway Israel from the peace talks. He ealled on Israelis to be on the alert for further attacks. 
"With all of the pain and sor­row, we will continue with the negotiations, and we will fight terror," Rabin said on army radio. "This terror wants to kill Israelis and kill the peaee pro­cess." 
The soldier was sipping a soft drink at a refreshment stand in Gaza when the assailant stabbed him in the neck, said Zvi Saar, the stand owner. 
The army confirmed the killing of the 30-year-old sol­dier and said the attacker was captured. 
The Nahal Oz junction is a main Gaza entry point for both the Israeli military and Arab day laborers, with mingling in front of the snack shop owned by a nearby kibbutz a common occurrence. 



Bishops ease dismissal for abuse 
By DAVID BRIGGS 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

U.S. Catholic leaders, buffet­ed in recent years by reports of priestly pedophilia, voted Wednesday to make it easier to dismiss priests who sexually abuse minors. 
In its first action since a car­dinal was accused in a lawsuit of abusing a teen-ager more than a decade ago, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops voted 219-5 to lift the church's five-year statute of limitations on dis-

missals in cases involving abuse of minors. 
If the change is approved by the Vatican, dismissal may be sought for up to two years after a diocesan bishop "receives information which at least seems to be true" of such abuse. The change recognizes that victims who were abused as youngsters may have been unable because of repressed memories or perceived church indifference to make allega­tions until years later. 
The bishops also voted to ask the Vatican to raise the age when abuse victims are consid­ered minors from 15 to 17 and

to speed up the judicial process by requiring initial appeals to be filed with regional tribunals in the United States rather than Rome. 
Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, chairman of the bishops' Canonical Affairs Committee, said the votes "will show the greater concern of the church" for abuse victims. 
The changes still must be ap­proved by the Holy See, but Pope John Paul II indicated in a letter to U.S. bishops earlier this year that he is aware how much American Catholics are suffering because of the clergy scandals.

Pacific forum underscores other new foreign policies 
By JILL LAWRENCE 
Associated Press 
SEATTLE 

The Clinton administration is using the Asia-Pacific trade conference to advertise that it has re-focused U.S. foreign pol­icy to make international eco­nomics a top priority and Asia as important as Europe. 
Senior officials hammered that theme Tuesday as dele­gates from 15 nations arrived for talks aimed at opening trade opportunities between the United States and the huge Asian market. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher flew into a Boeing airfield to underscore White House commitments to expand­ing trade. 
"I've personally talked to heads of state about buying your airplanes," Christopher told Boeing workers. "I've tried to set an example for sup­porting American business around the globe." 
In Washington, a senior ad­ministration official said Tuesday that the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum "represents a distinctive im­print of a Clinton presidency to put international economics on the front burner of foreign pol­icy for the first time." 
The official, speaking on con­dition he would not be other­wise identified, also said the conference symbolizes "an his­toric broadening of America's focus" to include Asia as well as Europe, and to create American jobs in the process. 
Clinton arrives Thursday on the heels of this evening's House vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement phasing out trade barriers between the United States, Canada and Mexico. As the vote approached, Clinton appeared to have enough sup­port to win, though barely. 
Success would send Clinton to Seattle with a momentum offi­cials hoped would infuse not only this week's unusual con­ference but also a round of global trade talks that must be completed by Dec. 15. 
U.S. officials are talking up the huge economic opportuni­ties in booming Asia: a market with two billion people, $1 tril­lion in infrastructure projects up for bids in the next few years and average economic growth projected at six to seven percent a year for a decade. 

Christopher set out an explicit goal Tuesday of doubling U.S. exports to Asia, along with the jobs that sustain them, in a decade. Currently exports amount to about $130 billion, accounting for 2.4 million U.S. jobs. 
"We expect to make progress toward more open trade, a larger investment throughout this Asian-Pacific region, the kind of progress that will spur growth and create jobs for American workers," Christopher said. 
The conference opens today with two days of meetings among foreign and trade min­isters. Clinton meets Thursday with the leaders of Canada and Thailand, then on Friday with those of Japan and China. The conference concludes Saturday with an informal session at­tended by delegates of all 15 nations, including 11 heads of state. 
Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Tuesday the United States hopes to win ap­proval of a declaration that gives the four-year-old APEC organization a larger voice in policy-making. 

Relief driver wounded on the eve ofwinter aid talks 
By DAVID CRARY 
SARAJEVO 

Government soldiers wound­ed a U.N. relief driver Wednesday on the eve of ur­gent talks to assure the safety of winter aid deliveries to 2.7 million war-deprived Bosnians. 
The shooting is precisely the kind of outrage U.N. relief offi­cials hoped to halt by inviting leaders of Bosnia's warring Croats, Muslims and Serbs for talks Thursday in Geneva. 

A U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo, Cmdr. Idesbald van Biesebroeck, said Muslim-led government troops in the Kakanj area, northwest of Sarajevo, shot the driver after the leaders of the aid convoy refused to hand over food and fuel. 
He said the Bosnian driver. whose name was not released, was taken to a U.N. base for treatment of a shoulder wound. 
It was the latest in a string of attacks on U.N. relief convoys. The killing of a Danish truck driver on Oct. 25, which the United Nations also blamed on government troops, prompted the suspension of convoys in much of central Bosnia. 
All sides in Bosnia's 19­month-old war have harassed relief convoys, in effect using humanitarian aid as a weapon of war. 
U.N. officials say the situation is especially dire as another deadly winter approaches with at least 2.7 million people de­pendent on U.N.-delivered aid. 
Snow already is becoming an obstacle. A U.N. relief official in Sarajevo, Ray Wilkinson, said a convoy trying to reach two mental hospitals in a com­bat zone west of Sarajevo had to turn back when one truck skidded in snow and blocked the others.

Louvre celebrates 200th birthday 
By MARILYN AUGUST 
Associated Press 
PARIS 
Hemodeled over the centuries by royalty seeking immortality by leaving a legacy in stone, the Louvre celebrates its bicenten­nial as a museum with the com­pletion of a billion dollar over­haul fit for a king. 
With the official inauguration of the new Richelieu wing by President Francois Mitterrand on Thursday, the Louvre dou­bles in size to 645,000 square feet and adds 25 percent more artwork to its galleries. 
Journalists got a preview Wednesday of the Richelieu wing, named after the powerful 17th-century cardinal and statesman who founded the Academie Francaise. The building was home to a century of French finance ministries. 
Two hundred years after France's first democratic lead­ers transformed Louis XVI's then 600-year-old royal abode into a museum, more than 30,000 treasures have been brought in to show off to the world. 

The graceful Marly horses have moved from their precari­ous, polluted perch on the Champs-Elysees to the glass­roofed interior courtyard where bureaucrats once parked their cars. 
Visitors who remember the old Louvre as a dusty maze of dark galleries crammed with paintings hung floor to ceiling will be delighted by the new one. 
The floor plan is logical and clearly marked, so visitors no longer get lost so easily. Items are identified and explained with historical and biographical information on plastic sheets printed in several languages.

I.M. Pei combines with a feeling of spaciousness to enhance the tiniest antique silver spoon to the largest Maximillien tapes­try. 
"The claustrophobic feeling I used to get is completely gone now," noted Carole Pinto, an American visitor tagging along with the press. "The natural light really gives added beauty to the artwork." 
Yet there's no losing sight of the royal palace. 

Sweeping, chiseled staircases, vaulted ceilings, high cathedral windows, marble floors and sculpted facades are constant reminders of the Louvre's col­orful history that began in 1200 when King Philippe Auguste, fearing invasion from his Norman enemies, built a fortress on the Right Bank of the Seine River. 
Two centuries later and twice embellished, it housed Charles V's rare manuscripts, priceless jewels and tapestries; Francois I later added paintings by Titian, Raphael and Da Vinci. 
But it was Napoleon's demand for tribute in art from his far-flung conquests, includ­ing the pink Carousel Arch of Triumph hauled from Italy, that made the Louvre the wonder it is. 
"I came to the Louvre for the first time in 1951," recalled Pei. "But what I saw in those days is just a tiny fraction of what visitors will see today."

Rules are snowballing out ofcontrol 
Dear Editor: 

On November 5, 1993, the Office of Student Affairs dis­tributed a directive regarding the annual snowball fight. The University stated that "any participation in a snowball fight will result in disciplinary action." 
While we share Student AITairs' concern for the health of the students and potential damage to University proper­ty, we are concerned that the text of this directive repre­sents a larger problem facing student life on this campus. We find this directive unfair and wholly unrealistic. 
The directive deprives stu­dents of a yearly tradition that is. for the most part, all in good fun. The snowball fight is among many campus ritu­als welcoming the arrival of winter including roasting marshmallows, drinking hot cocoa, and the building of 
DOONESBURY 

snowmen. The events foster a sense of camaraderie and serve as a release from the pressures and stresses of everyday academic life. 
Students are overwhelmed with enough rules and limita­tions that serve to control stu­dent life on campus and we don't need an order from above that bans the use of snowballs. Does this mean we are not allowed to play in the snow anymore? 
The recent ruling on dorm initiations further demon­strates the University's eiTorts to curtail the student life that remains on campus. Before the '93-'94 academic year the DuLac Handbook was revised to include new regulations and standards for students. However, since September Student Affairs has already added two new directives to inhibit the social life on cam­pus. Will this trend continue?

While the safety of Notre Dame students, as well as of the various campus buildings, should be a foremost concern, the administration has failed to distinguish between fun and serious danger. We are not promoting the occurrence of a snowball fight or any other activities that may potentially cause bodily harm or property damage. Rather we are describing an alarm­ing trend of increased University control over an already lacking student life. 
The University needs to adopt a more flexible approach towards administer­ing to the needs of the Student Body where the spirit and tra­dition of Notre Dame are maintained and not stifled.

Dear Editor: 
This letter presents an opportunity to do a huge favor for those less fortunate. 
The clients at Logan Center (a facility for the mentally re­tarded) try to go to one Notre Dame home football game each year. The clients' admis­sion is provided by donated student tickets collected the week before the chosen game. 
Employees of Logan, Notre Dame student volunteers, and the Notre Dame ticket office decided that the Notre Dame­Boston College game would be the 'Logan game' this year. There are about 70 clients and 30 volunteers who wish to go to the game, so my objective is to collect 100 stu­dent tickets this week. 
An opportunity to do a big favor for those less fortunate 
All a student needs to do is drop ofT his/her booklet at the esc or give it to one of the volunteers in the dining halls. A table will be set up in North Dining Hall on Tuesday night (November 16) and in South Dining Hall on Thursday night (November 18) both during dinner. The CSC will be taking donations all week. 
Remember the awesome feeling you got Saturday after the Florida State-Notre Dame game when you realized that you had just witnessed an incredible event? How about allowing 70 mentally retarded adults share in that "awesome feeling?"

Dear Editor: 
I have just returned home from witnessing Notre Dame's wonderful victory over Florida State. On the plane home, I read Mike Conklin's column in the Chicago Tribune which in­cluded the following: 
"Our mystique here is about faith and belief," said defen­sive lineman Bryant Young. "It starts with believing in the Lady of Notre Dame .... " 
I wonder how happy the Lady of Notre Dame was to watch the students of her University chant "F--the Seminoles" when the Florida State band played their Indian war chant. It wasn't the iso­lated few; almost every stu­dent joined in. 
I had seen "Rudy" earlier with my son, a Notre Dame sophomore, and was moved to learn the team prayed the "Hail Mary" and sought Our Lady of Victory's intereession before taking the field. 
"Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death." The reality is thousands of Notre Dame students, arms raised, middle nngers extended, chanting "F--the Seminoles." 
Everyone at Notre Dame should be ashamed. I am sure the Lady is.

VIEWPOINT 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Laws should protect rights of the living, not the 'potential' 
Dear Editor, 
As I read the article of Frank Pimentel (The Observer. November 9, 1993), I started to think about the relevance of the concept of life in relation to the rights of an unborn human be­ing. 
Mr. Pimentel stresses the point that it has been proven scientifically that life begins at conception, therefore the unborn child should enjoy full legal protection under the law. 
From the legal viewpoint, even if the dispute may involve the question of the beginning of life, it is far more relevant to establish when we are dealing with a "person". 
Given that life begins at con­ception, can one consider one or more cells a person with full legal capacity? 
In ancient times, the Stoic philosophers considered only a born, living child a person under the law; however, it was recognized the potentiality for the unborn to be a member of the human community; Roman law protected inheritance rights in favor of the unknown. 
Let's think for a moment about life! What is it? Though I have not studied in detail the aspects of conception I think one can affirm that the bio­chemical process which eventu­ally generates life is the same for humans, animals. fish etc.. If we say that life is the deter­minant factor to have a person then we must grant to human life a special status, considering the universal nature of life but also considering the different evaluation and protection of the life of all the other creatures. 
Let's think of an extreme which can be explained with a (presently futuristic) example: if the first cell formed is "living" and is a human being under the law then we should admit that any cell in our body is a poten­tial person. by considering the possibility of cloning. 
Try to imagine the amount of legal and practical problems re­lated to this statement. 
Though the biochemical pro­cess of life is the same among different species, there is some­thing which differentiates the first cell of a human from the one of a cat or a fish; this some­thing is the DNA which contains the genetic information which causes the first cells to develop in the broad variety of living creatures. 
In modern technological ter­minology we may define the DNA as computer software for a neuronal computer. At the time of conception we run the program with all its possible applications; potentially. from the first cell we will have a child, a fish. a cat or whatever. The computer program, as the DNA, may contain defects or may break down prior the achievement of the goal thereto set, therefore one should keep in mind that if we say that something has the potentiality to become something else then one must also consider that this something, necessarily, is not yet what it is supposed to become. 
In this way at the moment of conception, although we can have life, there is a possibility of being a child, of being a cat, of being a fish etc., unfor­tunately by law a potential per­son is not yet a person! 

The legal development of the past twenty years and the legislations of various European Nations suggest that if the Stoics doctrine still has its weight. there also is a changed attitude in the con­sideration of the unborn child; this change has been influ­enced by the developments in the medical science and tech­nology. 
Even in Countries with very permissive abortion legisla­tion, such as France and Italy, there are limitations on the exercise of the right to have an abortion in the late stages of pregnancy. That means that the legal status of a fetus is somewhat different from the one of an embryo; the fetus in the latest stages of pregnancy enjoys such a high level protection that an abor­tion is not legally permitted (with exception of certain situ­ations). Why? Aren't both liv­ing entities? What is then the "magic" element which differ­entiate the two legally? Is the fetus in the late stages of pregnancy a person? 
Officially and with no doubt it is not in civil law. but the protection granted under criminal law that would lead us to think that we have a person (legally speaking) prior to birth. 
If life is not a sufficient 

condition to have a "person" what then is that missing ele­ment which allows for special protection of the fetus under criminal law? In my opinion the key word is "differentia­tion": aperson equals life plus differentiation. 
At the moment of concep­tion we have a bunch of cells which have the potential to develop into a human being but the same group does not yet present any somatic/ phys­iological human characteris­tics. In order to have a fetus, the first cells have to dif­ferentiate their functions as to include those parts which will form the human being; if the cells do not differentiate prop­erly the chances of having a child born living are far less than under normal conditions. 
Furthermore, given that we today can through modern technology. help a premature­ly born baby to complete its development. an embryo out of the mother's body would have in any case no chance of becoming a child. In a techni­cal way there is not such a great difference between the mother and a "life sustaining machine"; if we somehow dis­connect this "machine" the embryo will naturally die. 
However the situation changes in the case of the fetus which has a better chance to survive outside the mother's body as the months of pregnancy pass by. 
Therefore if we would con­
sider the embryo as a person 
we would be in the situation of granting rights to a person which is, at the same time, alive and dead (being it just a potential person). 
Laws are made to regulate the relations between individ­uals living in community. The goal of laws is to serve the overall interest, regimenting the self-interest of the single "persons"; many abortion leg­islations have tried to balance the interest of the mother and of the fetus, since it would not be right to grant to either one an absolute right to influence unconditionally the reciprocal legal sphere. If we assume, from the existing legislation, that the fetus has some rights we can not deny that the mother has also rights, in case of irresoluble conflict one must compromise! Wise are the decisions of the US Supreme Court; perhaps they are not perfect but surely they are loyal to the principles of the Constitution, balancing the community relations of the "persons". 
Lastly, I would like to recall that since the Constitution refers to "persons" and "citi­zens", inconsistent is the argument that a right to have abortion should be denied saying that one of the goals of the State is to protect human life: the protection applies only to preserve the life of "al­ready-persons", not to "poten­tial persons".

Nanni offers seminar on homeless next semester 
By BILL ALBERTINI 
Accent Wri1er 
"The typical thing that I say about the class is that I think that it portrays 

,;' homeless persons in a completely differ­ent light. It's not seeing them as the vic­tim, as the poor who are in need of our help, but here they are, the teachers," says Lou Nanni, executive director of the Center for the Homeless, and instructor of the Seminar on Homelessness being taught this semester at Notre Dame. For the twenty-two Notre Dame grad­uate and undergraduate students enrolled in this course. one day a week is spent in class discussions centered around readings about the homeless problem. However, every Thursday means a visit to the Center for the Homeless, for sessions taught by present and former guests of the Center. dif­ferent members of the many homeless sub-populations, and those who work on the front lines of the battle against homelessness. Most students feel that the trips to the center are the highlights of the class. Kjirsten Hanson, a senior Psychology major. said it is good "just being exposed to a whole bunch of different groups." This includes all of the differ­ent homeless or marginalized individu­als. including those dealing with mental illness and addictions.

ACCENT 
Holy Family Catholic Worker House supplies temporary shelter for homeless families 
BY MATT CARBONE 
Accent writer 
You have finally decided to leave the husband who has been abusing for to many years. You have little or no money, two children, and now face a daunting bureaucratic patch­work of federal and state social service agencies. You have lost almost all hope of getting your life back in order. To whom do you turn? 
The place to get help is the Holy Family Catholic Worker House, located in South Bend at 502 N. Notre Dame Avenue. 
Established in 1986, the house provides housing and food for temporarily homeless single and double parent fami­lies. 
While many of the guests of the house are single women with children who are homeless after leaving an abusive hus­band, there are also guests who are homeless due to unforeseen financial difficulties or a drug or alcohol addiction. 
The house has even recently served as a temporary stop for a Bosnian Muslim refugee fami­ly, who stayed at the house for a week before going to live with their sponsor family. 
The average stay for guests is three to six months "but we're flexible," said Sister Suzanne Patterson, Holy Cross Sister and director of the house for the past two years. 
Mike Garvey, assistant direc­tor of public relations and information at Notre Dame, and one of the founders of the house, explained why the direc­tors of the house chose to target the needs of single women and their children. 
"We went around asking vari­ous other shelters what people they were turning away the most," said Garvey. "We found out that women and their fami­lies have the hardest time find­ing places to stay." 
"The sad thing is that there

-Mike Garvey 
will always be people in need of the kind of hospitality we pro­vide," said Garvey. "There will always be broken, hurting, sin­gle women who need others to believe that their anguish is significant." 
With this in mind, Garvey, his wife (who he met while both were working in a Catholic Worker House in Davenport, Iowa), and seven other people joined together to found the Holy Family Catholic Worker House. 
"The house is founded and administered in the tradition of the Catholic Worker move­ment," said Garvey. "It's a communitarian, anarchist and pacifist movement; a movement of anarchist dissent." 
This movement was begun by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin as a response to the widespread materialism, exploitation and totalitarianism prevalent in Depression-era Europe. 
The movement is committed to nonviolence, simple living and social justice, and attempts to create an entirely new soci­ety with the shell of the present society. 
"Let's say there were no laws or agencies for the poor," said Garvey. "The Gospel impera­tives would still be the same. At the house, we try to live the Beatitudes as literally as possi­ble." 
Today, the movement is represented by over 100 houses throughout the country similar to the Holy Family House. 
"We help people in their struggle for justice," said Patterson. 
This help takes the form of accompanying the guests as they work through the social services system, and in the pro­viding of a sense of community which the guest can fall back on and look to for comfort. 
"We're in the service of giving hospitality," said Patterson. 
Kathleen McBride, a senior in Lewis Hall, was a part of this hospitality last year. when she visited the house each Wednesday. 

"It's a family-type atmo­sphere," said McBride. "I was a little unsure of how I'd be ac­cepted the first few times I went, but by the end of the semester, I felt like I could stop by wherever I wanted I studied in London last semester, and I really missed going to the house." 
Garvey is overjoyed when stu­dents get this type of response upon visiting the house, and hopes more will join McBride and the other Notre Dame volunteers. 
"We really do like it when Notre Dame students come down to visit, have some coffee, and just chat and play with the kids," said Garvey. 
He also mentioned that Mass is said at the house on the first and third Sundays of every month at 11 a.m., and that he would be delighted if Notre Dame students attended. 
Patterson agrees that the stu­dent's contributions, however small they may seem, are a powerful addition to the house's and the guest's sense of community. 
"Their (the student's) great service is attention, affirmation, and interest in the residents," said Patterson. "In return, stu­dents feel a connection to the residents, and see that the homeless are human, ordinary people." 
Elizabeth Clifton, a junior in Lewis Hall, has gotten this same feeling after volunteering at the house. 
"It gives you a different per­spective on life," said Clifton. "At Notre Dame, we have a lot of advantages which we some­times take for granted." 
Citing one guest who had just celebrated her one-year an­niversary of sobriety, Clifton said, "These women are strug­gling in their lives. It's makes you appreciate what you have when they're celebrating the little things in life." 
McBride agrees, "Notre Dame students aren't aware that as few as two blocks away (from campus) are people with a whole different set of experi­ences than they have." 
Garvey, Patterson and the others try to help guests deal with these often painful experi­ences by providing a caring, nurturing place for the tem­porarily homeless in which they can recuperate emotionally and start anew. 
"We don't consider ourselves in competition with the South Bend Center for the Homeless," said Garvey. "We provide a hos­pitality to vulnerable and bro­ken families, which is different than the hospitality the Center provides." 
''I'm sure Lou Nanni (director of the Center for the Homeless) would agree with me that it would be great if we both went out of business because we had nothing to do," said Garvey.

Badin and PW nteet in stadiunt 
By SCOTT CLEMENTE 
Sports Writer 
After two months of football, the Women's lnterhall field has been narrowed to two teams. This Sunday at 11 a.m., Badin will face Pasquerilla West in Notre Dame Stadium for the league title. 
Badin finished the regular season as the No. 1 team in the league while PW was ranked 
PREDICI10N: 
Badin 20 Pasquerilla West 14 
No. 2. Sunday will be the first meeting of the two teams. 
In the semi-finals of the play­offs, Badin escaped with a 26­18 victory over Howard while PW defeated Lewis 20-6. 
This will be Badin's first trip to the championship game as a women's hall. The men reached the finals once before the dorm was converted. 
Defensive back Shelly Dillen­burger is looking forward to playing for the championship. "We're very excited," said the sophomore. "It's been out goal all year." 
To win the game the Badin defense will have to shut down PW quarterback Bethany Rid­dle. Hiddle, a senior. threw for two touchdowns in the Weasels' victory over Lewis. 
PW will also have their hands full stopping a Badin team that lost only one game the entire season. 
Both teams are looking for­ward to the game. "We are just trying to practice normally," said Dillenburger. "We have to refocus for the game on Sun­day."

Stanford bids for upset 
By G.R. NELSON Spons Writer 
At noon this Sunday in Notre Dame Stadium, upstart Stan­ford battles favored Morrissey for the Men's Interhall Cham­pionship. 
Morrissey's route to the championship was very simple. 
They have dominated ,.,--=,..,....,..~~~~ground, on every-
every opponent in amassing a 6-0 record. Morrissey's defense has allowed only one touchdown all year and their offense has only once been held to less than two scores. 
Stanford has struggled, even in the playoffs. but they have made it this far. "We are not always pretty," said Stanford's Chad Smock, "But we are effec­tive." 
Morrissey's offense is pretty. They have an outstanding pass­ing attack. Quarterback Scott Taylor is arguably the best in interhall play. "Taylor is awe­some," said Stanford captain Chris Pollina. 
Taylor also has the weapons to work with in running back Justin Kruer and receiver Tom Fitzpatrick. Add their strong offensive line, and Morrissey's offense is a complete package. 
Stanford's defense will be challenged, but they are ready. "Morrissey's offense is the best we've faced," said Stanford's Bret Galley, "But we believe in our defense." 
Stanford's offense has moved the ball, especially on the 
one, and Morrissey should be no excep­tion. However, the Stanford attack, led by quarterback Mike Brown and running backs Lamar Guil­lory and Pollina, 
must avoid the turnovers to have a chance to defeat Morrissey. "We cannot make mistakes," said Pollina. 
Special teams could play a part in the outcome. Morris­sey's are outstanding, while Stanford's are inconsistent. "Special teams are a key part of our success," said Morrissey captain George Reider. 
To Morrissey, this game is no different from any other. "We are not going to do anything different," said Reider. "We will do what we've done all year long." That is mixing a strong defense and special teams with

Standout recruits to bolster Irish staff 
By JENNY MARTEN 
Senior Sports Writer 
The blue collar work ethic of its pitchers took the Notre Dame baseball team to within a game of the College World Series for the second straight year last summer, but three of those pitchers were lost to graduation. 
The first step to filling the shoes of Chris Michalak, David Sinnes, and AI Walania, who combined for 26 of Notre Dame's 46 wins last year, came yester­day when Irish coach Pat Murphy announced the signing of three high school pitchers yes­terday. 
Three standout pitchers signed national letters of intent to attend the University of Notre Dame as student athletes and play baseball for the Irish in the fall of 1994. 
"Our program's first and fore­most priority was to go out and solidify. our pitching staff. which was decimated last year with the graduation of some very talented players." said Murphy. 
"We are extremely pleased with those who have signed, and each have the ability to step in immediately and contribute to the University of Notre Dame and its baseball team." 
The three pitchers, Christian Parker, Dan Stavisky, and Mark Marino, all have outstanding sta­tistics heading into their senior 
years and fit into the Irish mold 

of hard-working, no-nonsense competitors. 
Parker. a right-hander from Albuquerque, New Mexico, has led his Eldorado High School team to two straight 4A state championships with a perfect 17-0 record. A two-year all­state, all-district and all-city se­lection, Parker, also considered Stanford, Arizona and Rice. 
Murphy had only praise for Parker. "He's a competitor. He'll be a great one in the col­lege ranks," he said. 
Stavisky, a right-hander from Mt. Pleasant, Pennsylvania, is considered a preseason high school All-American. Last sea­son, Stavisky posted a 13-0 record with a 0. 76 earned run average while notching 199 strikeouts in 146 innings of league play over the summer. 
Also a forward on the Mt. Pleasant basketball team, the 6­3 Stavisky was looking at Ohio State, Penn State and Yale. Mt. Pleasant coach Dennis Miscik said of Stavisky, "His strengths are that he's a pitcher and not a thrower, and a real fierce com­petitor." 
Lefty Mark Marino of Chal­mette, Louisiana is the final Irish signee after striking out 36 and allowing just one earned run on nine hits in 22 and two-thirds innings last year.

Marvin Wood inspires SMC basketball 
By MARY GOOD Saint Mary's Spom Editor 
Hollywood loves Indiana underdogs. Before there was "Rudy" there was "Hoosiers." Before "Hoosiers" there was just Marvin Wood. 
Everyone knows the story. Everyone was inspired by the movie "Hoosiers." A small town basketball team. A new coach. The Indiana State Championship game. A last second shot for the win -"The Milan Miracle." 
But what about the man behind the miracle? 
.. 
What about that young coach who became champion of an old tradition? The 1954 "Milan Miracle" was neither the beginning nor the end of Marvin Wood's passion for Indiana basket­ball and for life. 
Today, 40 years after that legendary game, Coach Marvin Wood is finally nearing the end of a long and fulfilling basketball career. 
As the Saint Mary's basketball team gather their bags and shuffle off the court, they all say "good night" to their coach. Wood remains on the empty floor. He is pleased with the Belles' victory over Bethel in a pre-season scrimmage. 
Although his team is short and inexperienced, with no NCAA championship in sight this year, Marvin Wood coaches them with the same enthusiasm he had working at Milan High School those many years ago. 
"We all love to win, but I'm not certain that 
... 
winning is the most important thing. I like to see growth and improvement in players," he said. Only two weeks into practice this season, Wood sees his team progressing defensively. 
Going into his ninth season as the head bas­ketball coach at Saint Mary's, Wood works hard to make the Belles not only better players, but also better women and better citizens.

"Saint Mary's is the most positive place I've ever worked in my life, and the athletes here are more positive than any place I've been," he said. "The girls become a family and I'm like an old grandpa." 
Like anyone's grandfather, Wood has his sup­ply of stories to tell. Sitting in his folding chair in the middle of a deserted court, Wood recalls when it all began. 
Growing up, Wood played basketball morning, noon, and night with his three younger brothers. They shot year-round at a basketball goal at­tached to their barn. Wood eventually became a high school star and went on to play at Butler University from 1946-1950. 
It was at Butler that Wood learned what it meant to ride the pine. For three years he sat the bench. Finally, in his senior year, he started against Notre Dame. lie was the shortest player on the floor. His coach told him that if they started having trouble a taller man would have to go in. 
Marv Wood did not disappoint. He was the leading rebounder and the star of the game. He had nine rebounds, 11 points, six assists and live steals. The next day the headline in an Indianapolis paper read, "Irish Defeated By Little Piece of Wood." 
After college, Wood received the coaching position at Milan where he remained for only two years. After the state championship he went on to coach at other high schools around Indiana including New Castle, North Central, and Mishawaka. Eventually he landed his current position at Saint Mary's.
