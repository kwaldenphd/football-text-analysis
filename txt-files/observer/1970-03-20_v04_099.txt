w ildcat post office strike spreads 
Howard Zion told a large audience last night that America rationalizes poverty, racism. and war.

· Jacques Marcuse said that before the United States fights a "limited" war with "limited" aims, we should devise a "limited death." 

NEW YORK (UPI)-The nation's first postal strike which hit America's business capital by surprise and left it awash in its own paperwork, spread to 5 I New Jersey communities yesterday and threatened to spread to other parts of the nation. 
As the wildcat walkout of 14,000 letter carriers went into its second day, no negotiations were underway nor were any scheduled with officials of the Post Office Department to settle the long simmering question of higher wages. 
All mail service was suspended in the populous suburban counties of Westchester and Rockland, N.Y., and the equally populous counties of Long Island. Mail was trucked by the ton to Philadelphia for posting_ A backlog of 18 million pieces of mail piled in Manhattan offices alone. Some 67,000 postal workers were idled in the city. 
Marcuse questioned about life in China 
by Shawn Hill 
After fifteen years of life in China, Jacques Marcuse, French China correspondent and author, told of the poor conditions of life in Mao Tse Tung's China. Speaking before an audience in the Law Auditorium Thursday night, Marcuse related his exper­iences in hoth Red and Nation­alist China, with Red China coming out second best. 

Marcuse was first in C'hina in 1932 as correspondent for the no w-defuncl !lavas News Agency. A change in position took him to Tokyo in 1936 but he retur_ned to Shanghai China in 1937 to cover the war with Japan. lie covered the entire hattie of Shanghai and in 1940 he resigned his position with the !lavas News Agency. In 1943, he joined the free rrench as a war correspondent. 
In 1947 he was in Shanghai again as Far Eastern Manager for Agence France-Presse. He wit­nessed the takeover of Nanking hy the Communists and 1949 was unable to leave the country until 1950. 
The possibility was raised late yesterday that the strike could dose down the stock market at least temporarily if it lasted over the weekend. 
Leaders in the securities industry said it might be necessary for New York and American stock exchanges to relax their net capital rules temporarily to allow brokers to borrow the money that is normally allowed to finance daily operations because so much of their collections are tied up in the mails. 
Dollar amounts in business losses were inestimable as· public utilities and other creditors reported there was no way to pay bills. Messen~er

He left China for good in 
1962 because he said he angered 
the regime and "they gently 
threw me out." 
As long time correspondent in 
China he gained much know­

such people as Chou En Lai and

scores of Connecticut committees considered sympather strikes. Stamford, Conn., mailmen were the first to strike in that state. 
In New York City, where mail is the lifeblood of some of the nation's major corporations, many businessmen said they did not believe the government, which obtained a back to work order that 14,000 New York strikers defied Wednesday, would let the strike run into next week. 
"You can just have a negative feeling about this strike, nothing else," said an official at the First National City Bank. "It can't go on." 
But union officials, angered by six months of delay in Congress which must vote any postal pay raise, vowed to stay out "until hell freezes over." Sam A. Madonia, president of the union's Houston, Texas., local said mailmen were tired of being "stepchildren of the government, called on time and again to carry the burden while everyone else reapedl the benefits." 
Postal authorities said they had tried to meet with union officers several times since the strike began, but without success. 
Starting pay for letter carriers is $6,176 a year and climbs to $8,442 after 21 years. The strikers, who claim 3,500 mailmen are on welfare in New York in order to make ends meet, have asked for a 39 per cent increase. The Nixon administration originally supported a 5. 7 per cent pay boost for all federal workers to take effect July I but it has asked that this be deferred until next January. 
No one was prepared for the mail carriers' surprise strike vote Tuesday night and City Hall had not mapped any emergency measures. Deputy Mayor Timothy Costello, head of the Emergency Control Board, said he was "keeping in touch with federal officials."

"We have no immediate plans for disposal of the property near the Toll Road," Sister explained.

by Dave Lammers 
Howard Zion, historian and political activist, argued last night that America presently suffers from "a conspiracy of laws" that is a rationalization for poverty, racism, and war. 
Zinn contended that the evils of our society,. such as the Vietnam war, the poverty of many of our citizens, and the racism of our institutions, is "self evident." Through our complex system of laws and salutes exploitation by the econ­omic and political elites has become "rationalized," Zinn said. 
"At the end of the assembly line come the victims, and we don't know who is responsi~le. The enemy is unidentifiable. We presently have exploitation that is more atrocious than in pre­modern times, and we don't know who is to blame. The laws have resulted in a mystification of power that goes under the name of rationalism," Zinn said. 
Zinn argued that "the modern era" does not actually represent progress over "the dark ages" because the economic and politi­cal power still lies in the hands of an exploitive elite. "The serfs knew who was enslaving them, but now we don't know who decides when we shall go to war, or who gels taxed, or who gets drafted." Zinn pointed out that 
Tile Federalist Paper No. 10, · written by Alexander Hamilton, explained why "the majority won't take too many things into its head." "The voters don't know what is going on," Zinn said, and contended further that there are only a few congress­men with any power. 
"In the colonial nations, force is naked, while in a modern nation there is an army of bewilderers" Zinn said. Zinn ployees here.

gave various examples ol' the effects of the judicial process to support his contention that the legal system is intended to support "the military, economic, and political elite." 
According to the Boston pro­fessor, "we are en~~:al!ed in terrible evils when the structure is functioning the way it is supposed to function. "The system is not now off-center, the system has not gone awry, as it did in the depression, for exam­ple. It is the non-corrupt politi­cian, that rationalizes evil through words, symbols, and the whole phantasmagoria of rules and regulations, that is the cause of the present ailment." 
Zinn concluded that revolu­tionary changes in attitudes and beliefs is necessary to make major changes in the structure. "The whole structure of law and opm1on which protects the economic and military elite must be called into serious question. Presently, law is designed to keep things the way they are." 
"The people confuse the Bill of Rights with the statutes that make up the economic imbal­ance, the governmental appor­tionments, and the military contracts," Zinn said. "The Bill of Rights has not been a very adequate protection of peopll' in real life situations," Zinn said. 
Civil disobedience to laws thai protect military and economil.: exploitation was considered by Zinn to he necessary for this revoJ.utionary change. "We must be willing to take risks. we must he willing to walk away from the scene of the crime. If we don't take risks, things will move along the way they are going now and we are presently moving toward disaster_"

Rivers takes fight tow in view; blasts handling of My Lai case 
COLUMBIA (S.C.)-Rep. L. Mendel Rivers said yesterday he still believes the United States 
should fight to "win" in South­east Asia, and called the latest 
arrests  in  the  alleged  My  Lai  
Massacre  case  "one  of  the  
darkest  days  in  U.S.  military  
historv."  

 Rivers said a subcommittee of the powerful House Armed Ser­vices Committee which he heads, is investigating the Pentagon's handling the My Lai case and "at the proper time we will make a proper report." 
He said Tuesday's arrest of 14 army officers, including the superintendent of West Point, resulted from "indecision and lack of leadership at the highest echelon in the U.S. Army." "a tragedy of major propor­tions." 
The 14 were accused of failure to investigate and report 
"I have said before we are not going to sit idly by and see men indicted for crimes of war when you have no rules of engage­ment; when the enemy is savage in treatment of prisoners of war, and where men, women, child­ren-everybody is attacking their benefactors with hand grenades," Rivers declared. 
Rivers declined to name any­one in particular in his attack, and when questioned about the subcommittee investigation said, "We haven't finished yet." 
"At the proper time we will make a proper report on this spectacle of indecision and lack 
of  leadership  at  the  highest  
echelon  in  the  U.S.  Army,"

That property, however, is not under consideration, said Sister, who added that the land to be investigated bounded by Douglas Road is situated north of McCandless Hall near the Indiana Toll Road. 
Sale of a farm north of the college by the order to provide for investment for the sisters' retirement generated rumors that the order would soon dispose of more tracts of land.

Valuable natural area 
It is fortunate that recent news releases disclosing that the Sisters of the Holy Cross were interested in developing and selling land used by the Biology Department are not correct. This would have been rather distressing news for our College because a valuable natural area: has been designated on this property by the Biology Department for the study of nature. 
It would have been a great loss to the college and especially to the science departments if this land were sold to industrial, commercial, or residential interests. The nature area is a designated natural area to be left undisturbed for teaching, research, and enjoyment. It was originally proposed by the Biology Department for the !25th anniversary celebration. A trail was established together with a trail booklet and a lot of work has gone into the collection of plants, making slides, and developing a herbarium. 
This nature area is essential for teaching courses in ecology, and many other courses such as Biology, Botany, Zoology, and even for the use of the Art Department. This is the only major undisturbed natural area on our campus which makes available first hand study of ecological relationships. This area has other advantages, the most important one being its easy accessibility from the campus. 
At a time when people are becoming more interested in the environment and in ecological studies, it would have been futile to have sold this valuable land. So much time and effort, mostly by the Biology Department, has gone into the planning of this nature area. Without this field experience it would be very hard for science students to learn environmental principles. To have lost this area to industry or a residential section would not have conserved the little bit of nature yet on our campus. Many other colleges would be jealous of such a wonderful asset to the education of Science majors and l'iberal arts students. 
The investigative committee appointed by the Sisters of the Holy Cross to explore the potentialities of the land should recommend that this area be preserved. Out of concern for the environment for its educational possibilities, and because of the Biology Department's efforts, it is important for the committee to protect this area. Dr. Dineen brings up a most important point when he says that "if colleges don't give leadership in nature preserves and environmental control, nobody will." Preservation of the environ­ment should begin right here on campus!

Letters to the Ed itor 
Faculty Cooperation? 
' 

Editor: 
Yesterday, March 18, the 
Faculty Senate soundly defeated 
a proposal that the Faculty at 
Notre Dame pay $10.00 a year 
for the registration fee for their 
cars. I feel the students chould 
be made aware of exactly what 
this refusal meant. 
Right now the students who own cars pay $25.00 or $10.00 a year automobile registration, de­pending upon whether they live on or off campus. This money is used for the maintenance, im­provement, and security of all the parking lots on campus, faculty and student alike. the proposal, made possible by the cooperation and interest of Pro­fessor Robert Anthony, asked the Faculty to help in this job of improving the present conditions existing in the parking lots. $10.00 per faculty and staff member at Notre Dame would have added approximately $8,000.00-$9,000.00 a year for the parking lots. 
It seems strange that the Notre Dame faculty, an intricate part of this University, would refuse to help improve the deplorable conditions of the parking lots. Vandalism has increased this year, a few lots have no lights or concrete base, and fences exist presently only 
in the C parking lots. These 
conditions could be alleviated 
with more money. the Univer­sity doesn't have it to give, the students' money can't possibly cover· the expenses of the needed improvements, yet the Faculty refuses to pay $10.00 a year for changes that will benefit the entire Notre Dame Community. It is hard to believe.

ND sen 1or tests campus security 
by John G. Broderick 
Picture the scene . . . last Friday morning, late as usual, I legged over to the parking lot to drive over to my 9:05 SMC music class. As the bright green color of my new car caught my eye, I ran across the lot, fishing for the keys in my 
coat pocket.  
You  can  imagine how  my  sleepiness  
was  instantly  transformed  to  bitterness  
when  I  saw  the  dents  and  scratches,  

engraved by vandals, defacing the side and rear of my car. I spent that day in red tape, reporting the incident to campus security and my State Farm agent in town. Saturday night, a friend and I spent an hour (II to midnight) patrolling the lots with iron pipes (for self-defense against knife wielding vandals) to no avail. It later occurred to me that no one stopped us for questioning. "Why are you walking through parking lots with iron pipes?" We surely looked suspicious! We were def­initely seen by the two student patrolmen hired by Mr. PeaN. But no one bothered 

Alumni to Perform at CJF 
by Steve Novak 
CJ F, to pick up where I left off yesterday, is here. The Judges Sympos­ium last night was a success. Although it is probably presumptuous -and certainly unfair-to try to summarize two hours of discussion in two lines of copy, I will. The consensus on the panel was that for some unfortunate reason, jazz has not enjoyed the success it should have in recent years, while predominantly white rock groups, borrowing and, as Willis Connover put it, 
"sometimes stealing"-what black blues and jazz musidans have done, have become popular sucl:esses. 
The syrnposwm was valuable and informative. But CJ F is not a seminar on the future of music-at least not a verbal seminar. The real purpose of the Festival is the music. In the next two days, 14 excellent groups of musicians will appear in Stepan Center. I'll mention four here which have a special relationship to Notre Dame and lhe Festival. 
A group called Grafitti will play this afternoon. The sextet is led by Dave Pavolka, who has been chosen "Best Trombonist" at the Festival three years in a row. Also in the group is last year's "Best Bassist", Wayne Darling. Grajltti can be expected to put on a fine show, in what will be the group's first performance before a live audience. 
Another of the headliners appears lonite. Two members of NO's popular First Friday Norm Zeller and John l'rendergast-join Festival Assistant Chair­man Nick Talerico, and three members of the Magnificent Seven, in forming the 
l.arrv /Jeachler Sextet. 
Talarico will appear on ptano, with John Buchanan (another assistant chair­man), Jack Leo and Pete Szujewski playing trombone, alto and drums. Zeller, who of course plays the guitar, dropped in on one of the group's rehearsals and decided to stick around. Prendergast is an old jazz hand. John toured Europe with the University of Illinois Jazz Band. On the tour-and on the album they cut while in Stockholm__:_John played Tuba ( down heat gave the album 4'h of a pos~ib!~ fiue :;tart). This weekend, he'll be heard on bass. 
Buchanan, Leo and Szujewdki, in addition to their work with the Magnifi­cent Seven, played last year with the Bill Hurd Quintet. Hurd and the fifth member, Larry Dwyer, graduated last June, but they will be back this weekend. llurd, "Most Promising Saxiphonist" in 
1966, returns to play with both the Big Band and the Combo from M.l. T. !'he combo appears Friday mght, the Big Band on Saturday. Also on Saturday

us. 
My curiosity was aroused. Are the lots protected ... or do the security people merely show themselves periodically? There is a difference! 
On Sunday night I determined to test our security. I played the "let's steel your own wheel covers game." I dressed in dark clothing and carried my laundry sack and a flash light. At 10:00 P.M. I proceeded to steal the wheel covers from my own car in D-1. I was a noisy thief, and took. 15 minutes to remove them ... I did it twice. I never saw the security car. Plenty of students saw what I was doing . .. but only one student approached me. "What the hell are you doing? Changing all four tires at once?" he asked. 
"Ahh ... no ... ahh," I responded, "I'm changing my hub caps." 
The poor guy was obviously not sat­isfied and I hoped he would pursue the issue and protect MY car from an evident thief ... but he walked .away. 
Disgusted, I drove to D-3 (by the stadium) and parked by the sidewalk, in 
afternoon, Dwyer will perform with the University of Illinois Dixie Band. Dwyer was "Best Trombonist" in 1965 and 1966-before Pavolka began his reign­but this year he'll be playing piano. 
Saturday night, of course, is the climax of the festival. The three combos and three Big Bands selected as the best will perform that night. In the past, the judges 
chose a "Best Big Band" and "Best Combo", as well as a "Best Overall Group" from the Saturday night finalists. This practice, however, has been dis­carded. Festival Chairwoman Anne Heinrichs explained: "We were in contact with a lot of former judges and group leaders, and we determined that, by and large, most of them felt that choosing a single 'best' group made the Festival too competitive, and tended to make crea­tivity a risk. We feel that elimination of the 'best' awards in each class will allow greater emphasis on creativity and musicality." 
CJF is here again, as I said, and Notre Dame is better off for it. Jazz is the most creative form of music, and the perfor­mers assembled for the weekend are among its best young practitioners. 
At $4.50 for an all-session ticket, it 
comes to about $.50 an hour for the best rnusic you'll hear on campus this year. If you don't go, you miss a lot. If you do go, you'll enjoy yourself. So go!

full view at 10:17 P.M. Here I placed my sack on the sidewalk, lifted the hood and tinkered with a wrench and flashlight. In a few minutes the two student patrolmen approached. I caught their eye ... and looked away. They inquired about my problem. I. just mumbled something about a loose fan belt. They were sus­picious but did not ask me to show a registration or even to open the car to prove I had the keys. The two merely walked away slowly gla:ncing back every now and then. I figured they probably called the patrol car on their radio, so I .waited around for I 0 minutes. No one showed. 
I was furious. I looked for the patrol car. I drove around for a half hour ... no patrol car in any lot! Finally at II: 15 I saw the police driving around the convo. I sped to the other side before they got around. It was dark and deserted ... a thief's delight. I locked the car and opened the hood. Here I tinkered with my wrench and flashlight until the police lights approached me. "What's this ... a new Ford won't start?" 
"Well no ..." I said, "just a funny noise in the engine." (A terrible excuse for poking around a car behind the convo at that time of night, I thought.) 
"Start it up and let's see what it is," the officer responded.

(Great, I thought. He wants me to prove that I have the keys. He wants me to show him that I own the car.) "No, .." I said, "I think I can handle this myself. Thanks anyway." (What a stall, I thought. They have to suspect something now!) 
"O.K., then," they said. And they 
drove away. 
Oh my God! I couldn't believe it. In desperation I drove to C-1 (across from the library). For 10 minutes I clanked my hub caps. Nothing. The security car passed by C-1 and went into D-1. How could they do that, I thought. What about C-1? 
I went into the library for a few minutes and warmed up. There I saw my friends the student patrolmen out the window. I walked through the lot flashing my laundry sack. No questions. After they passed, I waited a bit and removed one wheel coyer and threw it on the pavement. Crash! They never came back to investigate. 
So here I am, at lunch on Monday, thoroughly broken (like my car). Yes, the security people drive through the lots, but they do not patrol them. 
Do not mistake my intentions for writing this article. Everyone mentioned here I'm sure is a competent person. Perhaps they are all using the wrong strategy, though.

Sacred 
by Mike Chapin 
A huge crowd of over 1500 people jammed Sacred Heart Church on St. Patrick's Day all hoping to walk out with some­thing other than the grace of God. The church was holging a one day "garage sale" of at least 1 ,000 objects which had ac­cumulated in the basement stor­age room. 
Brother James Dorson, C.S.C. explained the reason for the sale. "Over the years with the liturgy changes and the conce1ebrated masses there was a need for less altars. Also, there was a need for space." 
The altars were not sold, however. In fact, nothing of any memorial or historical value was sold. Many religious items were sold such as old pews, holy water founts, surplices, 175 misal stands, old communion railings,candles, wooden, bronze and brass candlesticks, pieces Jf wood, and materials from vest­ments Sacred Heart Church makes according to Brother James. 
Baskets of materials went fo or three dollars. Some candle sticks which were appraised at $300 were sold for $175. One 
· couple bought two of them after buying over $500 worth of other items, Brother James said.

Heart holds sale 
The surplices were sold for a quarter a piece to a home for retarded children. Brother James explained that the children will learn to dye the durplices many different colors. 
Brother James said that over 60% of the items sold was non-religious rummage. Trays dishpans, tools, nails, garden hoses, old captains chairs, flowerpots, decorations, lamp­shades, bookcases, chest of drawers, spotlights and pieces of 
wood were sold. The crowd was made up of decorators, faculty memhers, 
students, and parishoners of the Sacred Heart Parish. Brother James said many just came to look while others just wanted a "little something from Notre Dame." 
Brother James was not a liberty to tell how much money the church had made off the said but did state that "we made much more than we expected to." He commented that many times the administration has a tendency to cut off their funds rather than someone elses. The cash will be used to bolster the church in case of any cuts.

Marcuse felt that the recent Sino-Soviet boarder clashes were not very serious and were mainly staged by the Chinese to "keep the people's minds off their problems" and improve morale and national spirit. 
When questioned concerning the influence of China in North Vietnam, Marcuse replied that the Vietnamese were quite nat­ionalistic and wanted little more than aid from China. He said that the Vietnamese fear that once China is deeply involved in their country it would be im­possible to get them out. 
In regard to our policy in South Vietnam, Marcuse apolo­gized for having to criticize our government but felt that before we fought a "limited" war with "limited" aims, we should devise some method of a "limited death".

W A Sill NGTON (UPI) -The White House said yesterday communist activity in Laos could affect future withdrawals of U.S. troops from South Vietnam. Defense Secretary Mel­vin R. Laird, however, said there would be another troop reduc­tion announced next month. 
Presidential Press Secretary Ronald Ziegler said communist activity in "Laos as it relates to South Vietnam" would be a factor in President Nixon's deci­sions on future U.S. troop reductions. 
Ziegler said the administration would be influenced by signifi­cant increase in communist infil­tration along the Ho Chi Minh trail in Laos, their main route for moving troops and supplies into South Vietnam. 
But he excluded recent fight­ing between North Vietnamese regulars and the Laotian army on the Plain of Jars as being directly related to the Vietnam War, thus ruling it out as a reason for slowing down troop withdrawals. 
Should communist strength in South Vietnam be measurably increased by infiltration through Laos, Ziegler implied, Nixon might be forced to reduce the rate of U.S. troop disengage­ment.

A Belated Green Greeting 
@' 1970, Los Anleles Times 

What could be more appropriate than for the newspaper of the Fighting Irish to print the St. Patrick's Day greetings from Mr. Jim Murray. Mail delay necessitated this column's appearance 
today, but the sentiments are the same. 
Well, 'tis that toime again-St. Paddy's Day, the saints be praised! 'Tis a day we honor himself, John L. and James J. and Cornelius McGillicuddy, and the Fightin' Irish, Knute Rockne, Mike Swistowicz and Doley Dancewicz and George Meiinkovich and the modern Irish like Leroy Kelly and C~lvin Murphy and WillieMcCovey. 
'Tis a day when you'll not be wanting to say, "Get the potatoes out of your mouth" in the corner p·ub or you'll be after needin' two hats. So, we furnish herewith our gloassary of translations from the Irish, remembering always the words of the little Irishman who gloomily surveyed St. Patrick's Day in New York as they all trooped by and then turned and spat: "Sure, they know full well the best av us were hung!" 
No matter. You still may need these helpful definitions: 
VICE-What you sing "Mother Machree" with. To "be in good vice" is something to be if you don't have the price of the drink yourself. 
BYE-A young male child. 
TOY -What you wear around your neck. 
BOARD-What has feathers and flies. 
CARE-What you ride around in. Cares are manufactured in Detriot. 
LOIN-Shortest distance between two points. Also what you are doing when you aren't telling the truth. 
BARE-Where you can buy a drink. 
MAIN-Intend. 
ISLE-What you spread on troubled waters. FEAR-Just average. Also, a tent show run by 
the county. · RITE-Civil disobedience. HOYDEN-Ducking the police. Concealing 
one's self. WAN-The number before two. VQILE-Despicable. HID-Where hair grows. PINT-To indicate with a finger, show direction. 
Some people have a pinted hid. 

POINT-Half a quart. TORN-Change direction. CORONER-What you torn when you change 
direction. FOYER~Something that lights up. BORN-What happens to something when you 
set foyer to it. PAIR-Just average, in sports, a "board" is one-under-par. PORPOISE-Intent or goal, when you do 
something on porpose, you really main it. MINI-A lot of. GRAIN-One of the primary colors. WAKE-l/52nd of a year. DYE-24-hour segment of a wake. 
Which makes me finally want to wish you all mini happy retorns on this wan Jye of the wake and the yare when we can have the wearin' o' the grain! Slainth!
