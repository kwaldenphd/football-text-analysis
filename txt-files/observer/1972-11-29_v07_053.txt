Washington--Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird announced that fewer than 10,000 men would be drafted in the first half of 1973 before the draft authority expires and the armed forces shift to an all bolunteer basis on July 1. He said that there would be no draft callis in January and that the relatively small inductions would be spaced out between February and June. He made the statements at a news conference about one hour before President Nixon announced that Elliot L. Richardson would succeed him as Defense Secretary. 
Dt>dham, Mass.--Samuel L. Popkin, Assistant Professor of Government at Harvard University, was released from jail when the Federal Government, in a surprise move,dismissed the grand jury investigating the public release of the Pentagon Papers.

His prison sentence had been in­tended to expire with the grand jury's dismissal, which had been scheduled for next Jan. 12.

by Jerry Lutkus Editorial Page Editor 
MPmbers of the Hall President's Council were given copies of the survey last night that was prepared by the LaFortune Ht-novation Committee to study 1he student body's ideas for changes in the student center. 

The hall presidents have agreed to conduct the survey for the committee. Each president was given a list of students in their hall who were to eomplete the survey. The students w<'re picked as the result of a random selection process con­ducted by a committee member.

something concrete to present to the administration." 
According to Ms. Skeehan, changes in LaFortune are almost certain, but only if the committee can present a plan including changes that the students want. The purpose of the survey, she says, is to find out exactly what the students want done. 
The survey includes questions that cover the possibilities of an on­campus bar, a student co~p store in LaFortune, and study areas in the Center. Also included are questions concerning what renovations are necessary in the building. 
Skeehan has found that the biggest problem facing the com­pletion of the survey is reaching the off-campus students listed in md of the building). The main lobbyi' the ballroom, and some of the smaller rooms would be open to student traffic if the proposal is approved. 
The committee hopes to gauge the use of the Center once it is open l'ontinuously. Then, according to Sk<'ehan. the committee will stud')' th<' possibility of keeping the Student C<'nter open 24 hours a day for the rest of the year. 


Madrigal Singers will fill the air with traditional Christmas· songs as £'ach course of the sumptuous banquet is served. The 1'Wassail Song," "Board's, Head.l('arol," and "Figgy Pudding" song are among the selections. The Wasail Bowl, a punch drink originally given to those who went from house to house as Christmas carolers, and flaming plum pudding, are two of the traditionally featured courses. Strolling minstrels will entertain with harpsidhord, recorder, a R£'naissance instrument, guitar, and flute.

the sample. As of now, _she claims she has no way to reach them. There are 21 off-campus students involved. 
The survey will result in 191 people being contacted. It covers both the campus of Notre Dame and that of St. Mary's. Each hall in most cases does not have anymore than 10 students included in the survey except for the obvious exceptions of Flanner and Grace Halls. 
Skeehan says that it will be the Hall Presider1t's responsibility to pass out the survey and make sure that it is turned in and completed. She hopes that the survey will be completed by next Tuesday (date of the next HPC meeting). Then results of the survey will be compiled by :the end of the week. 
The festivities are open to the public. Individual reservations are available, as well as reser­\·ations for a complete table of ten to tw£'lve persons. The $5.00 per person ticket includes meal and concert. For reservations call Saint Mary's College Ticket Office, 284-4176.

Kellogg Foundation studies urban decay 
"ThP quality of life in urban centPrs is a pressing problem which universities must face," according to a preliminary report on ''Continuing Education and the Universities" released here as part of a national study. 
Comparing the deteriorating urban center to the crisis in rural life of thP 1930's, the task force assPrtPd, "What is needed now is a similar national commitment to our urban centers and the development of university ex­pertise and structure to assist whPrevPr possible." 
The preliminary task force report is one of four studies on the future of continuing education supported through the Kellogg l''oundation, chaired by Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., president of the University of Notre Dame. and located at Notre Dame's center for Continuing Jo:ctucation. 
Whill' the university should provide leadership for all levels of <'ducation, the task force said, "the ('ampus has ceased to be the only or even the dominant, location for higher education." They urged that universities find ways to <'Xtend credit for television and ('Orrespondence courses, as well as independent study and perhaps travel or work experiences. 
As another of six major recommendations, the report asked that "a national com­rnisision l'or continuing education bl.' l.'stablished" which would in­dude a research unit, a learning unit and a clearinghouse or ('Ornmunications unit. 
The research unit would in­,·estigate major areas of ignorance ('Oncerning continuing education, !he task force explained, such as: whPiher adults learn differently than do their juniors; how adults l<>arn best and under what con­ditions; what blocks numbers of 
people l'rom educational op­portunity: what kinds of people would be most successful at !!.'aching adults. 
In summary, the report's six rC'commendations are: 
--Each university should be mcouraged to affirm its com­mitment to continuing education. 
--All citizens should have op­portunities to earn credits toward a degre<' outisde the full-time residential degree program. 
--The continuing education program whould provide strong non-degree, non-credit programs. 
--An institute should be l.'stablished to provide intelligent leadership in insuring research and alternative solutions to the social. economic and political problems of the day. 
--Coordination of all educational institutions, governmental agencies. labor unions, businesses and volunteer organizations is necessary for effective continuing <>ducation programs.

Buckley supports reducing penalty lormarijauna use 
((') 1!172 Nl'w York Times 
New York. Nov. 2M--William F. Buckley Jr., the conservative columnist and editor, said today that he now advocated removing criminal penalties against the use of marijuana. 
He said he would stop short of legalizing the drug, however, on the ground that strictures against trafficking in marijuana should remain in force. 
The current issue of National Hevil'w. the magazine that Buckley edits, bears a cover headline that asserts, "The Time !las Come: Abolish the Pot Laws." The principal article in the issue urges American con­servaives to abandon their sup­port for laws against smoking marijuana. 
It was written by Richard C. Cowan, an activist in the Young Americans for Freedom and, like Buckley, a one-time conservative student leader at Yale University.

and welfare-which together consume some 63 per cent of the federal budget. 
Richardson would assume responsibility for carrying out the President's announced aim of "thinning down" the extensive civilian employment at the Pen" tagon and for overseeing the military's transition to a post. Vietnam era. 
Weinberger, whose past at­tempts to trim spending in the government's social programs met with resistance at H.E.W., would take on that effort directly. 
The appointment of Ash to direct the White House agency appeared to signal Nixon's intention to use the Office of Management and Budget as the focal point of his efforts to reorganize the ad­ministration. 
Ronald L. Ziegler, the White House Press Secretary, read a statement asserting the President's intention to give the office of Management and Budget "a new. expanded role." Ziegler declined to elaborate. 
The spokesman did say, however, that the agency would ·'undertake comprehensive examination of all government programs now in existence to determine whether they are ac­tually meeting the purpose for which they are designated." 
Ash chaired the Advisory Council on Executive Organization, which devised the plan to replace seven existing departments with four new departments and consolidate their programs along functional lines. 
Congress has balked at ap­proving Nixon's massive reorganization proposal, however. There had been speculation before Ash's designation to head the management agency that it would become a vehicle for a "de facto" reorganization, in which White House aides and cabinet officers would coordinate executive branch operations as if the new depart­ments existed. 
The nominations of Richardson and Weinberger require Senate confirmation, which was expected to be granted by the time Mr. Nixon is inaugurated for his second term on Jan. 20. Ash's appointment does not require congressional consent. 
Sen. William J. Prixmire, D.­Wise., complained, nonetheless, that under Ash, Litton Industries had been involved in "two of the most highly inefficient and mismanaged military procurement operations." 

Proxmire described Ash as a "man of personal integrity," but he said in a statement that con­tracts to Litton for a new landing helicopter attack vessel and a new destroyer. both navy projects, were running far behind schedule and likely to generate major cost overruns. 
The national women's political caucus issued a statement ex­pressing pleasure at the prospect of a cabinet reshuffling. but added this reminder to the President: 
"The 1972 Republican party platform calls for the 'appointment of women to higheast-level posit ions in the federal govern­ment. including the cabinet,' and Wt' naturally expect that you in­tend to keep that commitment." 
The White House said that Nixon would make additional personnel announcements tomorrow. 
Richardson, who is 52, will succeed Melvin R. Laird, whose resignation was announced by Nixon yesterday, along with that or George Romney. the Secretary 
of  Housing  and  Urban  Develop­ 
ment.  
Frank C.  Carlucci,  the deputy  

director of the Office of Management and Budget, was being mentioned as a prospective successor to Mr. Romney. There were also reports that James T. 
Lynn, the under secretary of eommerce, would be elevated to Secretary of that department. 
Wrinberger, who is 55, said at a news conference in Washington that he would remain at his present post until the work is completed on Nixon's budget for the 1974 fiscal vear. · Ash, whose salary as president of the ~onglomerate was $195,000 a vear. will receive $42,500 in his government post. He said that he would sever all connections with Litton by Dec. 9 and that he would sell some 200,000 shares of stock in the corporation, with the proceeds to be invested in a blind trust. 
Ash. who is 54, said at a separate news conference in the capital that he would begin work at the White !louse as soon after Dec. 9 as the President wanted him. He said that he had been a "five-figure· contributor to the Republican campaigns in each of Nixon's elections.

Please Give Blood 
For the second year in a row, Notre Dame undergraduate Pete Meade has seen that the Red Cross bloodmobile has made its way to the ND campus. The bloodmobile arrives tomorrow in search of 800 units of blood. Hopefully, the ND­SMC community will respond. 
The cause is a crucial one. Blood is always needed and this program is particularly worthwhile because it gives so units of the collected blood to a local institution for use by University persons. 
It's a reciprocal arrangement. Not only will the donation of some blood benefit those in dire need of it, but it also establishes a reserve supply for the people of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. Further, if you give blood anyone in your immediate family is entitled to free blood for the next year. You really can't lose in this deal. 
The Red Cross says, "Your gift could mean life for a sick child, an accident victim, or an elderly person facing surgery." 
Again, we've been given the op­portunity to help those in the world outside the University confines. Why not go out and aid them? Call Pete Meade at 3412 or Jack McKeon at 8851 and make your appointment to give blood.

The Problems with the Course Evaluation Booklet 
r t 
r The "Course Evaluation Booklet,"
r 
r printed conjointly this year by the Ob­server and the Scholastic, has been out
r 
r two days. Already a number of per­
r ceptive individuals have pointed out some problems with the booklet, and a~ few personal comments seem in order. r The problems that have been pointed 
out are not new; they are perennial and I
r 
I 
fear in my more pessimistic moments,r r inevitable, given the present procedure r for the booklet's publication. First, it r must be stressed that we are convinced that the student evaluations are not only an important luxury, but an essential part of a responsible look at the curricula 
offered by the University; otherwise the small group of students who produce the booklet would not undertake a task of
~ 
such magnitude. 
A point that recurs every semester is that the evlautions are necessarily biased; they are written by a single student, at best with only verbal con­sultation with other members of the class. The point is valid. Every attempt has been made to minimize any un­warranted bias in the evaluations by asking only people we feel to be most responsible to do the reviews. Each evaluation is then read very carefully by members of the editorial board, and any questionable evaluations are double­
r 
checked. ~ The procedure is not without flaw, r however. To write a good course 
evaluation requires some time and considerable thought, and every
r semester we find that there are simply too few students who are willing to give their assistance. Those who do often end up being overworked. 
A second problem is a lack of support from some departments. T)lis semester, all departments were presumably told that they were to have their course listing completed and available by October 25. Nevertheless, several were not ready until the week of Nov 6-only days before the final deadline for the submission of 
_ 

evaluations. As a result it was impossible to begin reviews of some departments until the last possible moment. 
Finally there were the difficulties in the actual production of the magazine. The computerized typesetting of the evaluations had to be completed in less than a week in order to meet the deadline of the printer. A dozen people gave up an entire weekend-a football weekend-to complete this part of the job, and a number worked through the night on two or three consecutive days. 
As a result of these complications the booklet was not perfect. Several courses were inadvertently omitted. Others, whose reviews were late, inadequate, or simply missing, had to be covered with only the information given in department course descriptions. For two or three, evaluations from previous semesters had to be used. The vast majority were current and responsible evaluations. But the few for which we had to depend on less adequate means still detract from the overall quality of the booklet and cheat the professors and students in­volved in those particular classes. To these people we apologize, and this is my main purpose in addressing these comments to the students and faculty. 
The "Course Evaluation Booklet" has received na tiona! attention because of its unusually fine quality, and this year the Scholastic received over 30 requests from other universities who wished to use the booklet as a model for their own evaluations. It would seem, however, that unless the effort is given more support in the future by the various departments, and especially by the students themselves, these problems will persist. And until this support is given and the problems eliminated, the most we can do is sincerely apologize to those professors and students who were slighted by the current lack of support.

Canservative 
One Version 
of "Amnesty" 
jim napier 
The question of amnesty for draft evaders raised by Senator McGovern in his recent campaigns, undoubtedly aided Riehard nixon's re-election. However, America will probably not realize the full impact of McGovern's proposal until some time in the near future. Although recently past administrations have been reluctant in granting amnesty, Presidents from Harding thru Truman have granted conditional amnesty. 
The Letter of the Law 
. Unfortunaely, there is considerable confusion surrounding the term 
1tself. Amnesty refers to the powers which the president possesses "to 
grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States". 
In no way does amnesty refer to a Presidential power to suspend. 
nullify or alter the existing Selective Service Act. 
The SPiective Service Act's provisions presently allow for alternate 
social service or non-combatant military duty for those persons whose 
rl'lig~ous or moral beliefs are opposed to all warfare. Congress has 
also mcorporated an appeals system within this bill. If the individual 
concerned wishes to appeal his local board's classification, he may 
consult an appelate board which is empowered to sustain or overrule 
the local board's verdict. The general law allows for further appeals 
throughthe United States Supreme Court. 
The Basic Injustices Viewed 
One_of ~h~ basic dilemmas engulfing the amnesty question concerns 
those mdlviduals wh? ~er~ actually conscientious objectors, but were 
rpfused a C.O. classificatiOn because of an unfair hearing by a local 
draft board. Another of the dilemmas concerns those who were op­
pos_ed onl~ to the Vietnamese War on the basis of personal moral 
bl'11efs. Did the state really have the right to force them to commit an 
act they felt was morally unforgiveable? 
To a large extent this issue is one of collectivism versus ill­
dividualism. Of course, for a civilization to exist the state must force 
the collective will upon dissenting individuals in certain instances, but 
to what extent the state should be able to force its will upon individuals 
is an Pternal question. 
.C_Prtai!IIY the United States must maintain a high degree of in­
dlvidu~hsm. Over ~he years this nation's characteristic individuality has gmded the Umted States through difficult times. Without this indi_vidualism _that has charac_teri~ed the United State's history, this nation would fmd Itself wallowmg m the complacency of conformism. Such acomplacent state would at best lead this land to the same fate of MPt~ern_ich's Austria or Kaiser Wilhelm's Germany, and that fate is <'xlmctJOn. At worst the minimizing of individualism and the onset of conformism would destine this nation to the bitterest Orwellian 
prophesies. 
CPrtainly the individualism displayed by draft evaders who refused 
conscription _on the basis of personal moral belief, is ju~tifiable. No 
state at any time possesses the right to compel an individual to violate 
his .~oral creed in such grave matters as warfare. Any other I~ 
position bv the United States violates this nation's Christian heritage. 
j J

Repatriation Not for All 
Although the majority of individuals who fled this country, left 
bPcause of feelings of injustices in the draft system, some departed as 
a form of nihilistic rejection of America. To allow the repatriation of 
such individuals, as a general amnesty would do, is to create a 
mockery of the civilization of the United States. The re-entrance of 
these individuals is "individualism" carried to absurdity. 
Rather than a general amnesty, the Selective Service Act should be 
re!roa_ctively _reconstruc~e~ to allow not only for the existing con­sctentJOus obJector provisiOns, but also for conscientious objectors seiPctively against certain warfare on the basis of morals or religion. 
Those individuals presently incarcerated who feel their draft boards violated their legal rights may thereby appeal to an appelate board whose decision, as to the classification of the individual, would be based on the revamped Selective Service Act. This appeals board could be organized along the lines of the appeals board for Selective SPrvice violaters as set up by Harry Truman subsequent to WWII. 
This board should also be empowered to review the cases of those individuals in Canada and Europe who fled the United States. However., unlike incarcerated draft evaders, these individuals should be obligated to perform alternate social service or non-combat duty as provided by the provisions of the Selective Service Act. 
If these arrangements are met, respect for the laws will remain in tact. justifiable individualism will have been supported, and on in­justices of the law will have been remedied.

Speaker for a junior guru 
by Jost'ph Abell Hf'ligion Editor 
Two tables and a few sheets make a simple altar on the low stage. Upon it are placed four neatly-framed pictures of the savior, one depicting him surrounded by bright. daisies, another showing him in white flowing robes. 
There are no candles, no tabernacle. no altar boys; there is no need for them. This is not an altar of Jesus Christ, or Buddha or Krishna or Mohammed, but of Satguru Maharaj Ji, a fourteen­year-old Indian boy who claims he is the reincarnation of the essence of all the others. 
The altar is mounted on the stage of Carrol Hall at St. Mary's College. The occasion: a lecture and discussion with a close disciple of the Satguru's, Mahatma Hajeswar. Tuesday night. Over a hundred people attend. 
"Everything outside of us is transitory and passes away," claims a sharply-dressed young man. He stands beside the altar with hands clasped before him, a cairn confident expression on his face. On his lapel is pinned a button with double-vision effect of the Satguru's face outlined in colored sunrays. He speaks slowly and with some hesitation, oftentimes repeating phrases, and obviously stalling for the arrival of the main speaker. 
"If we know the knowledge of God, then we know eternal bliss," he tells the audience. "And all we need to gain that knowledge is nwditation, service, and guidance by the perfect masters." 

Satguru Maharaj Ji: A fourteen-year-old perfect master promises peace to the world. 
descending a pole continuously. The moral: "Our minds are like the genie: they are only a tool, and if we let them rules us, we have no hope. We are not our minds; we are our souls and we need God. The Satguru's knowledge is like the pole: it is the thing to fill our minds with." 
The second presents two frogs, one who has lived in the ocean and another who refused to believe that there was a body of water larger than his well-home, until the first showed him the ocean. The moral: "We all get into wells and think we're important. We must realize the ocean of life." 
He hesitates again, this time closing his eyes, perhaps to meditate. perhaps to remember 
"The Lord of the Universe has come to us this day  ..II 
some more time-filler. 
"I have another story-do I have another story?-1 have another story," he finally decides, and launches into a third story, telling this time of a man who complained to the Satguru that his knowledge of God removes individuality from a person's life. 
"Go to the top of the Notre Dame library and look down at the in­dividual students, so self­importantly on their way to classes. Do they not seem the same from the library top? Are they not all the same size-that of an ant? 
"We must immerse our selves in this knowledge, becoming one with it or we will never find happiness. 
"We will never find happiness," he repeats. 
Hl' finally tells of the Satguru's "Peace Bomb," a bomb that does not destroy, but explodes inside a person and brings him peace. He conveys a promise of the Satguru's to change all regular bombs into flowers as they dropped. 


"This is a great gift," he declares quickly and scurries off the stage to make room for the newly-arrived Mahatma Rajeswar. 

A curious entrance: a man, middle-thirtyish, with a dark overcoat that was to remain on him throughtout the talk, and another Satguru button pinned to his lapel, crosses the stage and bows before the altar. After meditating for a few minutes, he sits in the sheet-covered chair beside the altar and fumbles with a small cassette recorder. After a bit of difficulty with the tape machine and the microphone placed before him, a high vioce is heard addressing a crowd. The voice of the Satguru himself? The audience is never told. With a slightly bored expression, the man lets the tape continue into wild cheering for the voice, followed by music. 
The Lord of the Universe has come to us this day sung in strangely Western-oriented music. A few disciples in the front begin to sing along. 
The tape shuts off after about ten minutes and the man bows his head. closing his eyes, and ap­parently, his mind, to his surroundings. 

Suddenly, he begins to chant in Indian. and out of the chant, English speech slowly emerges, heavily accented. 
''Human beings have lost their part," he says quietly. "They have lost their part and are groping in the darkness." 
He explains that humans have always groped in the darkness between times of perfect masters, times when the perfect masters came to show humans their real part in life. 
"Everyone has four things in t·ommon." he begins to digress, "and these are a need for food, sleep. sex, and a fear complex. But all disciples of the perfect master have one opinion: to realize God. This is their real part, their real purpose, this realization of God." .he returns to his original theme. 
But how to reach the realization of God? How to achieve this "highest achievement of the in­dividual soul?" 
"The perfect masters come to lead us to this state," he says. "They came before-Jesus was one: Krishna was one; Buddha was one: Mohammed was one. And they gave the most important thing: the experience of God. They did not give sermons, they did not make philosophies, they did not write books, they did not form theories: no, they gave the ex­perience of God. And this is why, brothers and sisters," -the first

He breaks this down and ex­plains: "Meditation must be done 24 hours a day, concentrating on the name of God. 
"But this is not enough. We must also stop whatever we are doing 
and  greet  the  perfect  masters  
when  they  come.  We  must  do  
service to the lord.  

"Finally, we must listen to the perfect masters. Many have eome, but most have received a bad reception-some were erucified, others ignored. We must listen to them, for they bring us the knowledge, the truth of God." 
He challenges man to seek out that truth: "Go all around the world and try to find it;" but gives a consolation: "If you find peace, very good. But if you don't, keep the Satguru in reserve. He will lead you to it." 
But a word of caution is also included in his message: "Suppose you die while you are looking­then you are dead. You cannot find the knowledge." 
This is the eompassion of the Satguru. the neatly-dressed young man tells us: he is here now; he has come to lead people to the knowledge before they die. 
An admirable presentation, but a few people leave anyway.

of over twenty repetitions of this phrase-"they were God, for only God can give knowledge of God." He cites Jesus Christ as a prime Pxample of a perfect master, perhaps because the references ll'"eeded for one of the other perfect masters would have been over the 
heads of his predominantly Christian audience. 
"Jesus Christ gave knowledge of God because he had knowledge of the Holy Ghost. He was perfect; he was God." The speaker is now quite animated. Deep into his subject. he squirms in his seat as if he wished he did not have to remain seated. His arms fly about him in wide gestrures to em­phasize his points that "Jesus was God!" because "St. John wrote in his Bible that the word was made God." · 
"What is the test of the perfect master? he demands of a slowly­thinning crowd. "Knowledge!" he almost shouts, "knowledge of God! Unless we experience God, all human life is a waste! And Satguru Maharaj Ji gives us that experience and knowledge of God! 
"Jesus Christ was only one perfect master that gave spiritual experience of God. Now Satguru Maharaj Ji has come! The Lord of the Universe has come to show us the light!" he fairly screams before beginning a short litany: 
"Has he come to show us the 
light of the sun? No! Has he come 
to show us the light of the moon? 
No! Has he come to show us the 
light of the stars? No! He has come 
to sh · us the light of God!" 
He 11~ -~s the audience that he 
has seen the light himself, and that 
that light isn't the same as un­
derstanding. He offers this light to 
his listeners, through the aid of the 
Satguru. Only a perfect master 
can show this light, he comments. 
He also emphasizes the im­
portance of meditation, with the object of the meditation taking the form of the "holy name of God." But one must remember: "Jesus, Krishna, Buddha, etcetera, is not the name of God; they are the names of the bodies of God. The holy name of God is within your 
body, within your self." 
He lapses in and out of Indian 
dialects in his continually-growing 
and never-ending enthusiasm. He 
explains that all humans exist 
today only for"carnal satisfac­
tion," that their minds are full of 
impurities. 
"The only was to purify one's 
mind is to concentrate on the holy 
name of God. When one meditates 
on the holy name of God, it is called 
meditation," he declares. 
He looks at his watch as one of 
his assistants sitting a back row 
seat falls asleep. Ten people leave. 
''The Satguru has declared that 
the other perfect masters blun­
dered. But now he has come in his 
full glory and promises to change 
the world." 
Five people leave, giggling. 
Many more coats begin to rustle. A final warning: "People who do not listen to the perfect master will · suffer. If you want to receive this knowledge, you will receive it," he quickly sums up, adding that books, pamphlets, buttons and magazines for further enrichment 
. are for sale in the lobby. 
The audience crowds through the 
doors of Carrol Hall, eager to leave 
the over-long talk. They mill 
around the concession table, 
fingering copies of The Divine

magazine, occasionally pur­
chasing varied-colored pamphlets, 
finally dispersing through

Concern for the \'alue of in­trospection is included through sessions on meditation and yoga, pcrhaps accompanied by readings on Oriental religions. Classes interested in artistic expression have worked with music of every kind. put together skits, done ccramics, and made films. Many elasses are concerned with Pxamining cultures and styles of IHe other than their own; these groups have discussed both :radii ional and countercultural readings and have made off­campus trips--to the South Bend most students never see or to the ncarby Amish communities. 
Emphasis in these classes falls on what is concrete and specific rather than what is theoretical and abstract: classes do things rather than just talk about them. But there is always interest in con­nccting what happens in SEM 181 with the rest of a person's <'ducation. There was a great deal of interest in B.F.

The assignments in SEM 181 are kept light, in line with a one-credit declive, but the course is serious in its informality. The teaching seniors want students who are authentically concerned with the kinds of problems mentioned and
