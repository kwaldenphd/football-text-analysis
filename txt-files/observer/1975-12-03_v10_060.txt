At Faculty Senate meeting

Burtchaell cites grade inflation as problem 
by Jim Winters Starr Reporter 

Grade inflation is "a beast of a 
problem" and "deserves some 
explanation and maybe some 
remedies," Fr. James T. Burt­
chaell, University provost, told a 
Faculty Senate meeting Tuesday 
night. 

"I think there's a lot of double 
talk" about grade inflation, 
Burtchaell declared, pounding a 
podium for emphasis. 

"Everybody reads about it, 
everybody is conscious of it, most 
people deplore it." 

But, Burtchaell added, he has 
encountered no "memorable" 
statement of the role grades play 
in maintaining academic ex­.cellence. The provost mentioned ex­
periments in non-grading systems 
which have been attempted at 
other universities, notably Yale. 

But he implied that such ex­
periments actually resulted in 
grading systems-in-disguise or 
were unfeasible at Notre Dame. 

The issue, he emphasized, needs 
more study.. 

"The University would be 
grateful if the senate committee 
took up the whole concept of 
grading," said the provost. 

Burtchaell also issued "a third 
appeal" to the committee to begin 
considering a specific code of 
professional conduct for Notre 
Dame professors. His last such appeal got nowhere, Burtchaell recalled, adding that he still believes formal professional guidelines are desirable. 
"The willingness of any profession to police itself is not strong," said Burtchaell. "We belong to a learned profession and we have standards of con­duct.. .and a commitment to students to live up to those stan­dards. We should go on record saying what our publicly accepted duties include." 
A number of universities, in­cluding Chicago, Harvard, Princeton, Indiana and Marquette, have codes of conduct for faculty members, Burtchaell continued. And he contended, "I think it does us honor, rather than dishonor, to state in a positive or negative way what we require of ourselves." 

A codified-standard would give department chairmen a guideline for measuring the effectiveness of professors, Burtchaell concluded, adding that the performance of all faculty members, tenured and untenured, should be periodically reviewed. 
The competence of professors over age 65 is already reviewed annually. Burtchaell said that is a healthy practice, and added that he supported a senate recom­mendation that the University provide a greater role, perhaps on a part-time basis, for retired professors. Emeritus professors, Burtchaell continued, are a University asset and should be "kept in harness." 

The present guaranteed annual retirement income for faculty-­$5500--is, said Burtchaell, "just terribly, terribly low." 
But Burtchaellsaid that a senate recommendation that the minimum be raised to $7000 would cost $36,000 annually. That money would have to come from somewhere, said Burtchaell, and he could not say from where it should come. 
Burtchaell's appearance before the faculty senate marked the first time in over a year that an ad­ministration official had addressed that body. The provost noted that last year's exchanges between the senate and the administration "were not always imbued with the respect they might have been," and he implied that he hoped his appearance would help improve relations between the two groups.

Bob Quakenbush, HPC executive coordinator, listed the tentative hall allotments and the average allotment was $370. The planned allotments range from $125 for St. Joseph's Hall to $575 for Stanford. 
Quakenbush said that all halls had to take a cut on what they requested because of the amount of money available.But the funds should be satisfactory to most, he said. "Hopefully we'll be able to finalize this next week." 
He also noted the HPC analyzed individual hall's plans and needs for the fundsin dealing with the requests.

Another student representative, John Brosious, said the calendar survey more than adequately served its purpose. 
Two percent satisfied now 
"When only two per cent of the students polled were satisfied with the currently-proposed calendar, we can see the survey was a success," said Brosious. 
According to Brosious, the faculty was pretty even on their calendar views but the students' overwhelming support of a new calendar should be very significant in the final guideline proposals. 
Brosious believes the survey worked out much better than past surveys because it was handled through the halls.

IRS plans to increase taxes 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The chief of the Internal Revenue Service said Tuesday the gov­ernment will require employers to increase the amount of taxes withheld from workers' pay­checks after Dec. 31 if no new tax law has been approved by then. 
IRS Commissioner Donald C. Alexander ruled out any tem­porary administrative extension of current tax rates until Con­gress and President Ford re­solve their tax dispute and raised the possibility that Americans' paychecks could shrink in January, then expand again later in the year. 
Alexander said in a speech before the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, "We intend to be understanding when you take good faith ef­forts to accomplish what may be an impossible task," but he said the higher withholding rates would be enforced. 
For a married man support­ing a family of four on an in­come of $15,000, for example, the reduction in his weekly pay­check due to higher income tax withholding alone would amount to $4.73. 
For a single person earning $15,000 a year, the reduction in take-home would be $3 a week. 
And the changes would not include the reduction in pay­checks for people who earned more than $14,100 this year and no longer had Social Security taxes deducted from their checks after they passed that salary level. 
The Social Security tax, which amounts to 5.85 per cent of gross earnings, kicks back in for those people on Jan. 1. 
The reason for the higher withholding rate for federal in-

Appointed Alumni Director 

Cackley optimistic about coming year 

by Don Reimer Senior Staff Reporter 
After three months as director of the Alumni Association, John N. Cackley is quite pleased with his job. "I am enjoying it tremen­dously,'' he said of his new position:'because I find that I have renewed acquaintances with many people from my former years here." 
Cackley, who was appointed to the position at the end of Sep­alumni over the next year include foreign tours, and an alumni senate meeting in the spring. They also work closely with the Alumni 
Board.  
A  plan  to  provide  continuing  
education  courses  for  alumni  in  
conjunction  with  the  Center  for  

Continuing Education is presently in the early stages, according to Cackley. "This is. still in the early stages of development, but it is on the drawing board, and hopefully it will be ready in the near future," 

Cackley's personal duties as alumni association director in­clude writing a column for each issue of the Notre Dame Magazine as well as answering some of the many letters from alumni received by the University. 
Travelling around the country to advise and consult with the various alumni clubs is also part of Cackley's job. Cackley and his two chief assistants go out to different sections of the country periodically to visit the clubs. 
to the East, to Pennsylvania and New York where I contacted six alumni clubs," Cackley said. "We do this constantly throughout the year where we think we should go out and try to help the clubs that might need assistance." 
Chicago ND Club 
The Chicago Notre Dame Club, which has the largest membership of 4,000, receives the most at­

"I think we're really set apart in that we have something special that a lot of other schools have envied," Cackley continued. 
Cackley noted that Notre Dame has 55,000 alumni and a total of nearly 350 active alumni clubs. "You can't just say that a certain portion of them do thisorthat or the other. Overall there is this intense loyalty to the University." 
The alumni are important to the University for numerous reasons, according to Cackley. He said the

t
Dame community. He served as an assistant to the executive secretary of the Alumni Association from 1947 through 1961, and he is a 1937 graduate of the University. 
Sitting in his office with such souvenirs of his long association with Notre Dame as a 30 year-old 
N.D. fire hat hanging nearby, Cackley spoke with quiet enth­usiasm about the many activities sponsored and coordinated by the Alumni Office. 

"What I have particularly been anxious to do is to continue the work begun by other alumni directors, ... Cackley explained. "I want to keep the programs going that have been in effect for a John Cackley points ~­

strengthen and expand them." 
Two of the events sponsored annually by the Alumni ssociation are Universal Notre Dame Night and the alumni reunion weekend. Universal Notre Dame Night is a three-month period from March to May, during which some member of the University administration visits each alumni club around the world, Cackley explained. 

The planning for the alumni reunion weekend in June of 1976 has already begun, according to Cackley, who said the preparation for this weekend will "tax his staff to the utmost." He said he expects nearly 1700 alumni to attend the reunion, which is to be held over RING IN THE LIBERTY the Fourth of July weekend.

Alumni hotel in Lewis 
In addition to these two events, the alumni office will sponsor this summer, for the first time, an alumni hotel in Lewis Hall. The hotel, which will house alumni and their families at reduced rates, will be open from June 14 to July 31. 
"What we're particularly in­terested in is to encourage alumni who don't get back to campus for a football game or a class reunion to come back for vacations here," Cackley stated. 
Other activities which Cackley and his staff will provide for the

tention from Cackley's office. Last night Cackley attended the Knute Rockne Awards Dinner sponsored by the club which annually honors outstanding high school athletes from the Chicago area. Cackley noted that the club planned to award the first Van Patrick award last night to Howard Cosell for excellence in broadcasting. 
"From observation of other institutions that I've seen down through the years I don't think th· ere's any other university in the entire country that can even come close to us in alumni spirit, alumni interest and alumni generosity," Cackley observed. 
alumni give the University much support in that they represent Notre Dame in their own com­munities and provide immense financial support. 
"We have over 5" percent of our alumni contributing every year and the na.tional average for universities all over the country is only 18 percent," Cackley ex­plained. "Our alumni give about three million dollars annually to the University." 
The alumni are also important, according to Cackley, in that they

Police said the bodies of the engineer and of an unidentified person were removed from the train. Earlier reports said one body was flung out of the train and was lying by the tracks. 
The gunmen were armed with automatic pistols and a hunting rifle and fired warning shots at police, troops and at an oncoming train, authorities said. The entire area around the stopped train was sealed off and a detachment of command­os was flown in on navy heli­copters.

Railway unions threaten strike 
WASHINGTON <AP) -Nego­tiations resumed Monday to avert a nationwide railroad strike threatened Thursday by four shopcraft unions. 
W. J. Usery Jr., the chief fed­eral mediator, called the strike possibility serious and indicated that if a settlement wasn't reached by Wednesday the ad­ministration might have to ask Congress to intervene. 
The four unions, representing 70,000 railway employes, have set a 6 a.m. Thursday strike deadline. The unions are the boilermakers, carmen, elec­trical workers and firemen. 
The main issue centers on the railroads' subcontracting of work to outside companies rather than hiring shop-craft employes.

COUP Report finding 
WNDU lax in educational obligations 
By Mark M. Murphy
Starr Reporter 
The Committee on University Priorities (COUP), in its recently­released Report on University broadcasting has emphasized the need for University~wned WNDU­TV to 'intensify its educational commitment to NotreDameand the public. 
The report, drafted by a COUP subcommittee of administrators and teachers, was published in the Nov. 14 issue of Notre Dame Report. 
The subcommittee explained that the original concept of the television station was to be both educational and commercial. In the past 13 years, however, em­phasis on student instruction and educational programming has decreased because of "com­mercial exigencies and the demise of the Communication Arts Department. 
While realizing that WNDU-TV must continue its commercial activities in order to make a profit, the report stated "that the con­tinued existence of the station should include a more active participation in the first priority of 
KKK wives were FBI data source 
WASHINGTON <AP) -A former FBI informant testified today the agency instructed him to sleep with wives of Ku Klux Klansmen, allowed him to participate in Klan attacks against blacks and civil rights workers and did nothing about 
the  attacks  despite  his  advance  
warnings.  
An  F'BI  official  denied  all  
three  accusations  

The former informant, Gary Thomas Rowe Jr., wearing a white hood to protect a new identity he has adopted, told the Senate intelligence com­mittee he was instructed to sleep with as many wives of Klansmen as possible because "that's the best way to gain in­formation." 
Rowe, who now lives in Cali­fornia, said he was allowed to participate in Klan attacks in order to gain access to the Klan's inner circles. He said he often warned the FBI in ad­vance about the attacks, but that they took no ar.t.ion. 
James B. Adams, associate deputy director of the FBI, flat­ly denied under oath that FBI agents had authorized Rowe to participate in violence or "to get involved in sexual activi­ties."

Christmas Spirits 

iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii pauI .herbig 
I am the spirit of Christmas Past. I worship the memories I have. 
Our small farmhouse in the middle of the cornbelt was not much but we had each other. Papa and my uncle Jamie would tramp out to the forest ten days before and cut down a small evergreen. We gave that tree the most coveted position in the entire household. My brother and sisters gathered acorns and cones. The little ones made their own decorations. The fragrance of pine lived throughout the house. 
Before Christmas if we were good little boys and girls, Papa would take us into town to see Santa. I can remember it now. It was the highlight of the entire year. We walked silently through the snow thinking all of the time what we were going to tell the great man. And when we finally arrived, there he was, next to to his sleigh and reindeer. I never was shy but my brother Rickie could never talk around him. 
Come Christmas Eve we'd go into town again to hear the church choir sing the carols. And as always there was a play about the first Christmas and the manger. Afterwards we'd have eggnog and Christmas cookies in the home of the minister. Then we'd have to hurry back home so we could get to sleep before midnight...when Santa came. None of us could sleep a wink but you'd never hear any of us admit it. We were too afraid that if we opened our eyes Santa might see and not come. But sure enough as soon as dawn came we'd be up and looking underneath the tree. There would be presents which we would so unceremoniously take apart to get to the gift in the center. That was the Christmas I remember so well. And which I will never forget. 
I am the spirit of Christmas Present. In our nice middle class home in the suburbs, we too celebrated X-mas. Everyone celebrated. The stores brought out the first products before Halloween. But we didn't really get going until Thanksgiving. Santa came to a suburban shopping center on the Friday after Thanksgiving--most of the time a helicopter brought him-­accompanied by a local high school band and chorus. He lived in a prefabricated home in the center of the mall. In the downtown a convertible rushes Santa and his reindeers (model 38-24-36) to his toyland palace. The boob tube was loaded with Christmas tales­money-making propositions all. The manufacturers brought out a whole new line of toys and games guaranteed to keep the kiddies happy. 
And when I took my children to see Santa-we had to wait in line 
questionnaire for him. He then proceeded to tell them where to ~o to get what they wanted. The tree we had was a pink and-or white tree (depending on what color the flashing light was shining at that time) made of purest aluminum. The ornaments <Woolworth's had a special) and the dozens of lights made the tree even more brilliant. I took the kids out to see the individual displays--neon lights everywhere, large scale models of Santa. Really neat stuff. And all the while the latest hit, "Santa Baby," was playing over the stereo. 
On Christmas Eve, Julie and I left the kids with a babysitter and went to the office party. The Eggnog was 100 proof. Everyone got blasted but we all had a good time. When we got back the kids had already opened the~r presents and were complaining. "This is too big!" "I didn't ask for this!" Oh well, you must sacrifice something for those modern conveniences. 
I am the spirit of X-mas future. The legend of Santa is known to us all. The bearer of gifts. Once a year we remember him and give to each other on one big day. Anyone who doesn't is a commie­pinko-fag. The big corporations start their campaigns on Labor Day and on Turkey Day it is intensified. The entire com­munications network is geared towards buy, buy, and buy more. The government inspectors keep an eye onyou-if you don't spend at least ten per cent of your gross you are in deep, deep trouble. The big man of Xmas is Sir Nick-the bearded man in the red Johnny Carson suit who stands at the information desk. He is a year round fixture--an aid to commercialism. The parties are month long and everyone gets high, high, and higher. Oh yes. Xmas is certainly a time to celebrate. If you sober up long enough to. 
Which spirit are you? 
Special Supplement: 
'A new look at the old sauce' 
Over 200 representatives of 62 colleges and universities from across the country met at the University of Notre Dame November 21-23 for the "University 50 Plus 12 Seminar: A New Look At The Old Sauce." 
The "University 50 Plus 12" project was begun in September 1974. It is being carried out by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism through its information components, the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol Information. During the initial phase 62 college communities were selected and visited -one in each state plus 12 private or minority institutions. 
The Clearinghouse collected information on projects and needs of colleges in the area of alcohol abuse and published a first draft of "The Whole College Catalogue of Drinking: A Guide to Alcohol Programs on Campus."
Last summer an "Editorial Board" of students and university administrators and professionals was created. The Board reviewed the catalogue and sent its recommendations for revisions to the C'learinghouse.
A second draft of the catalogue was sent to the representatives to the Alcohol Conference for suggestions and criticism. The Seminar itself was a vehicle for bringing people involved in the area of prevention of alcohol abuse together to share ideas. 
The Clearinghouse staff will evaluate the Seminar and by next spring the final draft of the catalogue will be published and sent to as many colleges and universities as possible. 
The Seminar was one part of a continuing project to deal with t~e problem of alcohol abuse in American college communities. 

by Kathy Mills Senior Staff Reporter 
Donald G. Phelps, director of the Division of Prevention of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism <NIAAA), welcomed ap­proximately 150 delegates to the alcohol conference to try to reduce misuse and abuse of alcohol on campuses across the country and warned them of the consequences if they do not take action. 
Phelps was the keynote speaker at "University 50 Plus 12: A Fresh Look at the Old Sauce," held Nov. 21 through Nov. 23 in the Center for Continuing Education. The cocference, co-sponsored by the NIAAA and University of Notre Dame Student Government, involved 50 state schools and 12 private institutions. 
"When we see an individual who thinks it's funny to get overdosed on this dangerous drug, we've got to be strong and assertive enough to do something about it," Phelps stated. He pointed out, "If we don't do something soon, we're going to have a big problem.'' 
Alcohol on campus 

Phelps said academic communities are the places where many people take their first drinks, the most important ones. He stated the social environments and conditions on campuses and the pressures on the students must be investigated. 
"We've packaged higher learning like a cereal box," he continued. "Those who come because they want to learn are confronted with pressures and take that first drink." 
Phelps added many people take their first drinks because they want to be wanted and liked. More people are using alcohol now, he pointed out, than ever before in the history of the country. 
However, Phelps noted, "What we're about is caring. If we do care, we can get a handle on this. 
Phelps was educated in the Seattle school system and attended Seattle University and the University of Washington. He has taught at the elementary, junior high and college levels. 
Current programs 
Although Phelps noted there are many problems 
to be overcome, he pointed out many current 
programs are helping to reduce alcoholism and 
alcohol abuse. 
He cited alcohol education programs for youth in Holland, N.Y., Akron, Ohio, and Philadelphia as examples of "small efforts" to reduce alcohol abuse. He called the Jaycees' program, named "Operation Threshold," a "Middle-American program that has exposed alcoholism and alcohol abuse." 
Phelps said the National Congress of Parents and Teachers has testified before Congressional committees and described it as an "outstanding leader." The Education Committee of the States, Phelps pointed out, will have a "white paper" ready in September, 1976, with recommendations for education and legislation on alcohol. 
He said federal government workers are "very important people in terms of the jobs and tasks they're fulfilling.'' 
"The important thing has been the amount of organization," he stated. "Committees heretofore not involved are getting involved." 
"We're on our way," Phelps continued. "The stigma and myths are going to be eradicated." He added, "I hope the momentum of action of the past three years will put us in fine shape." 
Phelps called on the federal government to stimulate discussion on how, when and where alcohol should be used. He also said this must be dealt with in public dialogue, and stressed the importance of prevention of alcoholism and alcohol abuse. 
He noted a major problem of the Third World is concern over the increase in alcohol use. 
However, he said everyone should be concerned. "The misuse of alcohol and the ambivalence on the use of alcohol cuts across every sphere," he stated. 


But you've got a big task ahead of you." Phelps is the first director of prevention ever appointed by the federal government. Phelps is

Alcohol abuse on upswing 
Programs started to combat drinking problems 
by Maggie Waltman Staff Reporter 
Alcohol abuse is on the upsurge at colleges and universities across the United States, and at numerous campuses programs have been initiated to help combat the problem. 
Four of the more successful programs have been established at California Polytechnic University, Indiana University, the University of Florida, and Jackson State University. 
The programs on each campus may differ in the way they operate, but they all have a common pur­pose--to inform students and faculty members of responsible drinking habits. Representatives of these four schools agree that the general population is misinformed about what alcohol can do. Too many people believe in drinking myths and have no concept of what alcohol abuse actually means. 
Lack of awareness at Cal. Poly. 
Michael Looney, a member of the Mental Health Team at the Student Health Center at California Polytechnic, said the authorities on that campus seem unaware of the problem of student drinking. Looney cited three divisions in the Cal Poly enroiiment concerning alcohol abuse. 
"The first group mcludes those who have noticed that drinking can conflict with developing relationships with the opposite sex," Looney explained. He said 25 per cent of Cal Poly students had experienced such situations. 
The second group includes those who are aware of the problems of alcohol abuse because a family member or close friend had a problem, Looney continued. 
"Then there's that third group, the majorit) of students who are unaware of the problem because they are misinformed about alcohol abuse," Looney said. 
The third group were the people the Alcohol Abuse program at Cal Poly specifically wanted to reach. Looney said, "Certain segments of the student population are more prone to be misinformed about drinking problems.'' 
These segments include. fresh­men, and fraternity and sorority members. As a result of their findings, Cal Poly introduced the Alcohol Abuse program at fresh­man orientation. "We felt it was necessary to redefine the criteria for being successful both as a party giver and a party goer," Looney said. 
According to Looney, the program has been very successful on the student level. One, result of this success was an expansion of 

the program. "We realized that drinking made the student feel accepted in society," Looney stated. He noted liquor makers and distributors encourage such an attitude through their advertising cam­ hall vandalism and a negative effect on academic performance as three results of alcohol abuse on campus. At I.U ., a Task Force was set up to study the problem and to inform the students. The philosophy of the  Task Force concerne<l responsible drinking habits. "We felt that if you choose to drink, that's fine, but drink responsibly. If you don't choose to drink, that's all right too," Engs said. -(continued on back page)  
paigns.  However,  Looney  con­ 
tinued, they  don't  distinguish  
between  responsible  and  
irresponsible drinking habits and  
thus  help  foster  misconceptions  
about their products.  
As part of their alcohol program,  
Cal  Poly  appealed  directly  to  
advertisers explaining the effect  
the ads had on students. "We were  
very  pleased  with  the  initial  
response,"  Looney  said.  "In  
cooperation, one brewery actually  
reworded the ads that appeared in  
the Cal Poly newspaper," he ad­ 
ded.  
Problem in the dorms at Indiana  

Ruth Engs, assistant professor of health and safety at Indiana University said that the alcohol abuse program there was directed toward the residential halls. "We wanted the dorm residents to be aware of the problem because it caused other problems as well," 
Ruth Engs from Indiana University was one of seven speakers In a

He discussed his efforts to control drinking problems on the Amherst campus at last month's conference on alcohol use at the Notre Dame Center for Continuing Education.  "It's much easier to work with people to prevent problems than it is to try to cure them once they're out of control," said Kraft. "If I can head off some of the people I counsel from developing a chronic abusive pattern with alcohol, I can save some of the work trying to pick up the pieces later on."

USSR to colonize 
Soviets extend military influence in Africa 
WASHINGTON <AP) United Nations Ambassador Daniel P. Moynihan said Tues­day that Soviet military moves in Angola show that the Rus­sians intend to colonize Africa. 
The ambassador also accused the Soviets of playing a major part in the recent passage by the U.N. Assembly of a resolu­tion declaring Zionism, a move­ment for a national Jewish homeland, to be a form of rac­ism. 
The plain-spoken Moynihan said he believes the Soviets backed the Zionism resolution to mask their own policies to Russian Jews. 
He said that in Africa the So­viets have brought Cuban troops into Angola and have built military facilities on the northeast coast. 
"It is fair to assume they mean to colonize Africa .. ," Moynihan said in a speech on detente at the fourth "Pacem In Terris" meeting. The meet­ing is sponsored by the Fund

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. <AP) _ A top federal energy official said Tuesday that between half and two-thirds of the nation's businesses haven't begun any 
program of energy con­
servation. 
"Energy conservation can be a better investment than new energy supplies," said Roger 
W. Sant, assistant adminis­trator of the Federal Energy Administration, speaking at a workshop during the National League of Cities convention 
here. Sant told officials at the 
workshop that some businesses have saved as much as 30 per cent of their total energy con­sumption since the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo. 
"What is needed is to get the other half to two-thirds that haven't yet begun to establish a program," he said. 
The federal official bemoaned the lack of institutions working for energy conservation and said: "I wish that our utility 
companies, for instance, could become that institution." According to Sant, utilities 
could J'ust as easily sell or rent 
insulation as they sell elec­tricity or gas and could also 
rent heat pumps or solar heat­ing devices. 
Sant said he was not suggest­ing abandonment of efforts to develop new energy sources but simply favored giving energy conservation more immediate

Moynihan's remarks brought critical responses from African diplomats at the United Na­tions. 
An East African diplomat who asked not to be identified said Moynihan acts like an "un­trained bull who has to fight all the time." 
Algerian Ambassador Abdel­latiff Rahal said he wonders why the U.S. envoy "has to put everything in such a brutal way." 
U.S. sources said Moynihan had cleared at least the general outline of his speech with the State Department.

States finds it difficult to react to Soviet moves around the world, while the Russians have no reluctance to exploit unrest in such countries as Angola. 
"It is fairly clear that ideolo­gical conflict has been stepped up on their side," he said, "or at very least expanded to new areas." 
For example, in Angola, Moy­nihan said, "the Soviets in ef­fect have landed Cuban troops ... on the southwest coast of Af­rica, even as they are consoli­dating military facilities on the northeast coast of that conti­nent." 
Only complaints from the United States and opposition from Communist China have blocked the Soviets from doing more in Angola and the rest of

The civil war began when various tribal groups struggled for control as Portugese rule was coming to an end last month. The Soviets have back­ed the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola. 
In the United Nations, Moyni­han said, a Soviet bloc country, the Ukraine, was among the supporters of the anti-Zionism 
resolution,  "which  directly  
served  an  announced Soviet

Moynihan asked, "This was seen as an Arab initiative, but was it?" 
As long ago as 1971, Moyni­han said, Pravda published an accusation against Jews, liken­ing Zionism to the racism of Adolf Hitler in Germany before World War II.

"Any attempt to bind prog­ress toward peace to negotia­tions with the terrorist organ­izations will end in failure," Rabin said. 
Referring to the U.N. resolu­tion adopted Sunday with U.S. support, he said, "This ex­tremist alliance cannot help progress toward peace and does not fit in with . . . the de­clared policy of the United States." 
In Washington, meanwhile, sources said a U.S.-Israeli rift has developed over a purported promise "in principle" by Sec­retary of State enry A. Kissin­ger to veto any Palestinian par­ticipation in Middle East talks before the Security Council. 
Kissinger is understood to have made the promise Friday to Simcha Dinitz,. Israeli am­bassador to the United States, with a qualification that any veto would have to be approved by the White House. 
Radio Israel reported a gov­ernment committee had ap­proved a plan to build four more settlements on the occu­pied Golan Heights in response to the pro-Syrian resolution. Is­rael already has 18 commu­nities on the heights near the cease-fire line with Syria. 
The leader of the right-wing opposition Likud bloc said the 
U.N. resolution was "a very grave political defeat for Is­rael" and called on the govern­ment to resign. 
In the late-moring raids over Lebanon, 30 warplanes flew in over the Mediterranean in flights of six. Half the attacking force bombed and strafed the Nahag al-Barid and Baddawi camps near the northern city of Tripoli, the other half struck areas near the southern town of Nabatiya. 
Saiqa guerrillas fired heat­seeking SAM 7 missiles at the first wave of planes, but hit none, Israeli government sources reported. The second wave scored a direct rocket hit on the guerrillas' missile ar­mory near Nabatiya.

LONDON (AP) -Lord Snow­on, husband of Britain's Prin­ess Margaret, said Monday 1at only a last-minute change 1 plans prevented him from eing aboard the light plane 1at crashed Saturday, killing uto race driver Graham Hill nd five members of his racing earn. 
"It's such an impossible thing J come to terms with," Lord nowdon said on a British .roadcasting Corp. radio pro­ram, discussing the death of 
r a ham, his friend for 24 ears. 
Snowdon, the former Antony .rmstrong-Jones, is a success­Jl photographer and had lanned to accompany Hill's ~am to take photos of a new ar they were testing at a rac­lg circuit outside of Mar­

JERUSALEM (AP) -Jewish leaders from many countries gather here Wednesday to try and forge a united front against the onslaught by the Arabs and the Third World. 
The conference was called by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin two weeks after the U.N. Gen­eral Assembly condemned Zion­
ism,  the  ideology  of  Jewish  
statehood,  as  a  form  of racism.  
About  170  representatives  

from North and South America, Western Europe, South Africa and Australia will attend the two-day meeting. 
''Something happened to the Jewish people everywhere after the U.N. resolution," says Rab­bi Israel Miller, a prominent Jewish American leader. "This conference is the result." 
The congress comes against an unsettling backdrop -the test of loyalties Jews every­where may face as their gov­ernments fall into increasing disagreement with Israeli pol­icy, particularly over the Pale­stinian problem. 
"This is a major problem," says Rabbi Miller, but adds the conference will not deal with it. The matter must be handled in­side the countries in question, not in Israel, he says.

The format of the class, Paradis said, was aimed at the goal of experience with art. "It's not a studio-oriented situation. We meet three Thursdays a month, usually  New York City, this being the most extensive. "We tried to set up a wide range of experiences for the group.

Paradis explained, "We wanted to develop the aesthetic sense by seeing as much art as possible. The experience with the artists was very valuable as the students  years old. I gained so much more insight from meeting them. It was amazing." Though the New York trip was the most extensive, Paradis said the other trips were extremely worthwhile to the group. The trips themselves provided the real-life exposure to art and the people

Soviets announce economic plan for new growth 
MOSCOW (AP) -The Soviet government, stung by farm production well below its quota this year, announced a go-slow economic plan for 1976, the most spartan of the postwar years. 
Next year's plan, the start of a new five-year economic peri­od, calls for industrial growth of only 4.3 per cent, compared to targets averaging 6 to 8 per cent in recent .years. Produc­tion of consumer goods, an­nounced as "the main task" of the five-year plan now ending, will drop in growth rate to 2.7 per cent.

mer, Western experts have pre­dicted the Soviets will fall short of their 215-million-ton grain target by 55 million tons, or about one-quarter. The short­age forced Moscow to buy heavily on the world market again this year, with puchases from the West expected to top 30 million tons. 
Despite Russia's industrial­ized might, the economy is still heavily dependent on agricul­ture, which employs about one­third of the labor force. 
The Soviets also reported that their over-all defense budget will remain the same as this year's at 17.4 billion rubles. That would be equivalent to about $23.4 billion but currency comparisons are regarded skeptically by most Western ex­perts, who believe the an­nounced Soviet defense budget represents only a portion of military spending. 
The Soviet Union has the world's largest standing army, nearly four million in uniform, as well as an advanced arsenal 
of aircraft, missiles, ships and tanks.

"Live-in" experience 
"Redbud", a program in art run last summer by the same two coordinators, was the seed from which the Frontiers class sprouted. This off-campus program was a 24 hour-a-day "live-in" experience. 
Paradis explained that "the studios were open all the time and ~yself and Raymo were available almost continually. Going through it, we all became very close working and living together so that we all benefitted from each other." 
"At the end, we wanted to create a course that would allow the student to gain insight through the closeness, but to concentrate on the aesthetic appreciation of art outside the studio," Paradis noted. 
A senior in the Frontiers class, Pat Carbonera, went through both programs and said the experience was extremely valuable. "The experience with 'Redbud' was really great. It was constant work, but didn't feel like it at all. Thh semester, Frontiers has been ever more so." The reason why, shf said, was the introduction of thE field trips. 

" 'Redbud' offered a stationar; base to work from, touching on th4 development of appreciation o art. With the field trips, Frontier: concentrates on the aesthetics o art in a much more intense way providing experiences that expost far more of the real-life side ol art," she explained. 
The two-credit course, open to art majors only, is graded simply satisfactory or unsatisfactory. A limit of ten students is set and thie semester's class was acomprised of five sophomores, a junior and four seniors. 
Exemplifying the growth the coordinators hoped to see in the students, Raynto explained that the students wrote a small paper at the beginning of the\course about what makes something aesthetic. "We'll have them write another paper on the same topic at the end. This should indicate somewhat how much the student has gained by the end," he
