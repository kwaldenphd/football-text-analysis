Observer Insight 
Another kind of crime hits the library students 
by Bill Murphy 
Staff Reporter 
Unreturned books cost the Memorial Library more than $2,500 during the year 1971-72. This is only part of a more ever­whelming cost suffered by the library because this figure represents only books that were legally borrowed. 
Theft and vandalism of reserve books and periodicals hurt the student body academically, as well as divert library funds that could be used elsewhere. 
Director of Libraries, David Sparke, spoke about the problem of theft and vandalism in an in­terview on Wednesday. According to Sparks, the exact amount of money spent on book replacement and repair is unknown because the money isn't available to make a complete inventory of library acquisitions at this time. The University's book budget is an allotment of 3 per cent of the total budget rather than the 5 per cent considered by Sparks to be a necessary standard. 
Sparks said that there are two kinds of problems. The first is outright theft and vandalism where there is no intention of restoration. The second problem is that of volumes hidden out of place. This is done by some students so that a certain reserved volume is always readily available to them personally. 
From these problems stem two 
kinds of cost. There is the actual 
monetary cost which must come 
from the already strained book 
budget and there is the academic 
cost to other students who need the 
stolen volume. 
Sparks pointed out that once a 
book or scholarly journal is 
catalogued into the library 
collection its actual worth is 
sometimes doubled or tripled. 
The work necessary to include 
the item in the collection, as well 
as the fact that many works go out 
of print and are irreplaceable, 
makes the cost of restoration much 
more than the student would 
imagine. Cataloguing costs seven 
dollars per book and adding the 
actual cost of the book and its 
availability gives the actual cost of 
replacement. 
Security and Search 
Assistant Director for Ad­
ministration, Dan Donovan, spoke 
about security in the library. 
At any given time, said Donovan, 
there is an exit controller and one 
building walker. From 7 p.m. till10 
p.m. on Monday through Friday there is a second building walker on the second floor. 
The idea of limiting admittance to the library to students only has been considered in an attempt at closer security, according to Donovan, but the surrounding community does contribute heavily to the library and it helps improve the University's public relations to allow the citizens use of the facilities. 
The idea of some sort of elec­tronic security device was suggested but Donovan admits that if someone really wants to steal something there's probably 
no foolproof way to stop him. 
Along with these security efforts are those of Mr. Joseph Huebner's staff. Huebner is the Director of Circulation and his staff had to make 3,334 recorded searches for volume requested by students which were either hidden or stolen during 1971~72. 
Departmental libraries 

Asst. Director for College and Departmental Libraries, Franklin Long, stated that his staff had a theft problem of a different nature. 
Because of their easy accessibility Long felt the departmental libraries were the most vulnerable. 
In these libraries (e.g. Geology, Architecture, Engineering) students have a tendency to borrow books without the necessary paperwork and therefore Mr. Long's staff can't tell if a book has been stolen until after a certain waiting period. 
Long did note, however, that students who used the various departmental libraries show less inclination towards vandalism of scholarly journals. This he at­tributed to the fact that many are graduate students who realize the importance of such journals to fellow students and their irreplaceable nature. 
Lack of Integrity 
Sparks has a project in mind to try and curb student theft of volumes. By working closer with the faculty he hopes to set up a more developed reserve system of required and supplementary readings for courses which would enable a closer scrutiny of books used by undergraduates. Sparks noted that even this wouldn't be foolproof and it really isn't a substitute for greater student integrity. 
Long stated that if a student is to follow the Notre Dame Honor Code in his academic career he should carry it over into his use of library facilities. The students must realize the importance of the library facilities to their education, according to Long, and should treat them with respect knowing that others besides themselves must use them. 
Both Sparks and Donovan noted that, within their limitations, they are open to constructive criticism from both faculty and students concerning library operations.

No quota clause in plan: Pears 
Coed rectors OK new escort service 
by Jim Gresser 
Staff Reporter 

The rectors of Badin and Walsh Halls voiced their support for Security Director Arthur Pears' promise to give a security escort across campus to any person or group of persons who need it. 
In an interview Wednesday, Pears stated that security would provide a "walking escort at any time. any hour" and that there was no "quota clause" in the plan. The plan stems from the recent increase of harrassment of people walking across campus. 
Pears suggested that those who do not wish to walk alone try to arrange walking in a group. In that case they may deem a security escort un­necessary. He added, however, that security would provide an escort for the group if they wanted one. 
Pears promised to designate one officer specifically for the job of escort. If too many people called for escorts for one person to handle in a reasonable amount of time, Pears said that he would assign other officers, if available, to escort duty. 
Pears noted that there are alternative plans under consideration and added that he would be more than willing to discuss any other "reasonable plan" for an escort system. One plan under con­sideration is one in which students would work out an escort system among themselves. 
Walsh Rector Reacts 
.Joanne Szafran, Walsh rector, supports the present Security plan and said, "I really question how many girls wi.ll use it, but if one kid wants it, it would be a good idea to provide it." 
Szafran cited the expected ·lack of use to the prevalent "it won't happen to me" attitude on campus. 
Szafran added that though Notre Dame is a calm place, it is "not going to be sterile-safe torever." She said that there was no great parallel to the big cities but said that "it's time that we be a little more careful." 
She went on that though caution must be taken, "a big fear-crazy neurosis" should be avoided. "There isn't really a need for an armed monorail." 
She feels that an escort would not be necessary if people would walk in groups. She suggested that girls not be afraid to ask boys going in their direction from the library or wherever to walk with them. 
Badin Rector reacts 
Badin Hall rector Kathleen Cekanski said that the security escort "must be an available alternative," but also added she doesn't "want fear blown out of proportion." 
Pointing to the example of the Law School, Cekanski expressed the hope that "undergraduate guys will take the responsibility to walk a girl back to her dorm." 
She noted that most people see someone that they know at the library and that they should try to make plans to walk back together. She feels that such cooperation would be an assistance to the co­educational process because it would involve students actively assisting each other . 
Cekanski feels that if a person cannot find a person or group to walk back to the dorm with, a security escort is a good alternative.

Washington-The Pentagon announced a significant increase in American air strikes against Communist troop and supply moveme~ts in Laos. Spokesmen said the strikes were a reaction to a substantral rise in the flow of military material from North Vietnam and stepped­up fighting in Laos. 
.. Saigon-South Vietnam threatened to hold up the scheduled release of Communist prisoners of war if the Communists delayed the release of captured government troops. The angry threat from a military spokesman came after the Vietcong reportedly failed to meet a promised deadline for the release of 320 South Vietnamese prisoners. 
Washington-The United States and Cuba signed an agr~ment designed to stop hijacking, but Secretary of State Rogers sard the l lnited States would not ease its diplomatic and economic boycott of Cuba until "the policies and attitudes of the Cuban government t·hanged." The hijacking_agreement. worked out through Swiss in­termediaries. was signed separately in Washington and Havana. 
Washington-President Nixon asked Congress to return agriculture to a free market economy by phasing out crop allotments and farm subsidies that have cost the nation $48 billion in the last dozen years. The plan was the main new proposal in the President's message on the environment and natural resources, which also called for federal standards for drinking-water purity and the extension of the national wilderness to eastern areas. 
Washington-At his first news conference since the recent devaluation of the dollar, Secretary of the Treasury George P. Schultz said the administration wants the price of dollars to drop even more than they have in world currency markets. Schultz refused to disclose a target value, but indicated the hoped-for decline would not involve another formal devaluation.

Lampoon ban~shed from Huddle 
~--------------------------~-----------­
Friday, February 16, 1973 the observer 
by Marlene Zloza Staff Reporter 

"We really didn't have any choice," is. the way Brother Kieran Ryan summed up his decision to remove copies of the National Lampoon from the Huddle magazine rack. 
Hyan. assistant vice president for business affairs. stressed that he took the step several months ago, "only with very good grounds" after an offensive.article was brought to his attention. 
"I received several letters from faculty members after one particular article had been brought up in their classes," Ryan explained. "The piece in question was some free verse thing about the Blessed Virgin and the Christ Child." 
1\fter obtaining a copy of the Lampoon, Hyan found the section "absolutely blasphemous and obscene." He circulated a eouple of copies among the University of­ficers. and after conferring with several of tlwm. he ordered the magazine removed from the Huddle. 
"I made the decision because I felt we 
could no longer be an agent for that kind of 
trash. We couldn't continue to support that 
kind of blasphemy at Notre Dame. It con­
tradicts all that we stand for," said Ryan. 
Aecording to the Huddle Manager, Mr. AI 
David. he removed the Lampoon after 
receiving a call from Mr. Edmund Price, 
director of food services. 
"I do try to keep an eye on the magazines, 
hut there are so many I can't read them 
all." David said. 
"I don't know of any regular check by

One of the new contests was 
sparked by the popularity of last

Hyan also explained that he had no regular policy for such action, but felt he had to take some action after the matter was brought to his attention. 
Admitting that the Lampoon banishment resulted from a judgment on only one issue, Hyan said the Lampoon had "no positive value and no redeeming qualities at all that we could see." 
The Assistant Vice-President also ex­plained that he is in charge of the Huddle "nnly in a supervisory way," and "not in­volved in day-to-day affairs."

The Huddle provides the magazines as a service to the students and makes no profit for their trouble. 
Concerning the return of the National Lampoon, Ryan stated that "if there is a ehange in editorial policy, I suppose we eould reconsider." 
As for the student government selling the magazines. Ryan refused to get involved with that. calling it "a matter for student affairs and not the business office."

Zeroing 1n on "Zeroing out" 
The ·poll.!!._lar bureaucratese for rlim ina ting an item from ti--e federal budget while continuing to list it is "zeroing out." In the lastfew weeks it has become increasingly clear that many of the financial aid programs that in­stitutions of higher education have worked with for years are going to be "zeroed out." At least, they will if Richard Nixon has his way. 
There is no doubt that the financial structure of American colleges and universities needs serious revamping. There is also no doubt that the present federal education budget will have a profound effect on both the price struc­
ture and the internal priorities of higher education industry.  the  
Graduate Schools  
The  severe  cutback  in  funds  for  

research institutes, funds which nor­mally find their way into the hands of graduate students, represents a deliberate attempt to bring regular education under the same financial contingencies that currently regulate professional schools. The argument goes like this: There are no social ex­ternalities to graduate education, the benefits accrue directly to the individual student in terms of increased earning potential. Consequently, the student should bear the full cost of education. 
The question of the existence of social benefits from education is difficult to assess but the effects of financing education as though such benefits did not exist are not so difficult to analyze. The net effect is to eliminate grad~ programs which do not increase the e·arning potential of their students. 
Past programs allowed the student to pursue an advanced degree without bearing most of the cost. Projected future programs appear to reverse this relationship. Since most students cannot pay the full cost of education without borrowing, it is clear that fewer students will risk graduate education if it must be mortgaged against future income. This is especially true if the graduate program has no clear past history of improving future income. 
Of course, this approach will improve the market for PhD's. It could scarcely 
daanesbury 
do otherwise since the number graduating will almost certainly decline. The most important question is whether academic professions can survive the transformation from the pursuit of knowledge to the pursuit of income. The prospect of studying literature or philosophy under a professor who con­siders his academic discipline the best way to maximize income is not exactly appealing. Universities do not need a professional community that acts like the American Medical Association. 
Undergraduate Education 
The effect of the Nixon budget on un­dergraduate education cannot be clearly assessed until the exact form of the Basic Opportunity Grant is known. In general, however, the pricing effects of this program are much less disasterous. In fact, if the program is properly executed it could have a very beneficial effect. 
Basic Opportunity Grants are a form of what economists call a voucher system. The principal advantage of this system is that it lets the student, not his parents or the benevolent university granting financial aid, become the purchaser of his education. And if a certain university doesn't live up to the expectations of its students it can expect to have a difficult time persuading those students that they ought to continue spending their Basic Opportunity Grants at a place that is not to their liking. 
The sovereignity of the student is directly limited by the extent to which the voucher system covers his educational expenses. Unfortunately, the number and size of Basic Opportunity Grants that the Nixon administration is likely to fund won't be much help to students from middle income families. In fact, the elimination of the federal student loan program could make Notre Dame students more dependent on parents and university programs than before. In this case, though, the intent is correct even if 
the  execution teristically inept.  promises  to  be  charac.

The GSU 
bill lavat;~e 

Rumblings of disenchantment with the role and function of the only graduate student representative body on campus frequently emerge from within the G.S. U. itself as well as from its constituent body at large. As a G.S.U. representative from Government, I have been particularly critical of the G.S.U. for its apparent insensitivity to fundamental graduate student needs and the absence of creativity in the expenditure of funds. At its February 2 meeting, however, the G.S.U. threatened to involve itself in an area of crucial importance to every graduate student associated with this university. 
Meeting at the request of Father Austgen to discuss the maximum sanctions for parietal and cohabitation violations arising from the Lew­is Hall incident, a conclave of representatives from the G.S.U., Student Bar Association, and Lewis Hall reached a consensus on three points. First,expulsionfrom on-campus housing ought to be the maximum san­ction for parietal and cohabitation violations. Second, only those ac­Lvities which "disturb the goals of the University" merit expulsion from the academic community. Third, a committee was formed to determine what activities constitute a disturbance of University goals and what sanctions, if any, ought to be applied. This column has obtained a draft of the recommendations to be presented by the committee to the G.S.U. on Friday, February 16, which will serve as the focus of debate. These recommendations are: 
I. 
Upon an unequivocal expulsion from and bythe department in which the student is enrolled for an academic violation, and, upon a ratification of that expulsion by the graduate student-university adjudicatory procedures; 

2. upon a felony conviction by the State; 


3. 
upon a finding of guilt of a feloneous offense by the graduate student university adjudicatory procedures; providing, the studen~ is to be ac­corded all o.f the constitutional procedures, rights and protections granted a defendant in a criminal trial by the State; 

4. 
upon a conviction ofa misdemeanor by the State, or , upon a finding that the student is a danger to the University's intellectual and or moral 


standards, one ofthe following penalties may be imposed by the graduate student university adjudicatory procedures: 
a. for a first offense the student should be given a warninng, or required to obtain off-campus housing, or suspended/rom the University; 
b. for subsequent com missions of the same offense, the student may be 

suspended or expelled. Several things about these recommendations and the nature of the 
G.S.U. response to Father Austgen's request deeply trouble me. I have no quarrel with the first three points made in the recommendations but it apl?ears th_a_t th~ committee f~dged on point four--the very quesdon for wh1c~ clanficatwn and expansion made a committee study necessary in the first place. What exactly constitutes a "danger to the University's ...mor~l sta~dards?". Is there a, necessary relationship between one's morality or Immorality and ones scholarly capabilities? 
I suppose a case could be made by setting forth the old twaddle about the nature of Notre Dame's "Christian Community" and the necessity for removing from its midsts any activities which grate on the sensibilities of that community. This line of reasoning notwithstanding, I must confess that as a graduate student !don't feel very much like a member of a 
Christian community. This may or may not be a personal hangup, but I would venture a guess that this feeling is shared by most graduatestudents at du Lac. 
The G.S.U. and its committee's whole response to this admittedly mudd~ed situation has been to miss the point completely. Not only would adoptiOn of the committee's recommendations without substantial changes be tantamount to handing the Administration a blank check to underwrite all future dealings with graduate students vis-a -vis disciplinary matters, it would, more importantly, ignore the larger issue of graduate student status within the so-called "Christian community." 
Fr~m the viewpoint of the Administration, at least, graduate students certamly are perceived as de jure members of the Notre Dame com­munity. De. facto, however, we most certainly are not. For graduate ?tudents, the ~ommunity argument is form without substance. Every Important socia~ and cultural activity at this university is geared toward undergraduate life. Graduate students must get it while they can or shift for them?elves. This is particularly true of the self-governing aspects "f stude~t hfe. None of the graduate hells have formal governing structures of their own and the sum total of their input to the Hall President's Councilis i_nsignificant or nil. The vast majority of off-campus graduate students live a world apart from the campus mainstream. No better ~x~mple of this phenomenon is true than the way in which the Lewis Hall mcident was handled. No buffers exist isolation is the norm. Where is 
the "community·~;~ ' It would_seem necessary that some kind of consistency ought to be ~ollowed With regard to graduate students. Either wear~ a special case Isolated from the rest of the community and should be dealt with in an incremental fashion a~ the need arises. Or, we are an integral part of the J\!otre Dame comm_u':n.t~ to be perceived as equals and enjoying the same rights and res~onsibllib~s as a~l others. If the former is true, we opt for the status quo m our dealmgs w1th the community at large. If the latter is our goal, then the Administration has some explaining to do and the 
G.S.U. had better start asking some serious questions and come up with some hard proposals for integrating graduate students into the Notre Dame community. 
An infrequent opportunit~ to make an impact on this university has presen~ed Itself. The Lew1s Hall caper has raised serious questions regardmg the current status and quality of graduate student life which ex~end ,Car beyond th~ alle~ed violation of the involved student's rights.

pdq bach--not iust" for mUSIC 
Whp or what is "The Intimate PDQ Bach?" The crowd that packed O'Laughlin Auditorium last night were very satisfactorily rewarded with the answer, ex­cellent musicianship, and a hilarious two-hour program of spoofs on Bach's "oddest of his twenty-odd children." 
For those who have "heretofore not had the opportunity of avoiding these performances," The In­timate PDQ Bach "is designed to bring his music to the general public under the direction of his discoverer and biographer, Professor Peter Shickele. "It will tell you more about PDQ Bach than vou care to know," according to Sh.ickele. 
I I was a collection of classical pieces liberally spliced by Shickele 

to permit karate chops, an oc~ casional boogie or jazz theme emerging, unconventional in­struments, and Shickele's comic touch, and it succeeds quite well, if audience response was any in­dication. 
Through the slapstick, through the diverse props and subtler comic techniques, Shickele's 
musicianship shined. A former

This is not to downgrade the 
comic element of the program--­
indeed. it's inseparable. Shickele's 
grand entrance set the mood for 
the performance---he arrived via a 
rope thrown from the balcony, 
arrayed in a filthy tuxedo and 
white socks. Besides proving 
himself as a musician, Shickele 
scores as a comedian. 
The spoofs are highly 
sophisticated and imaginative, 
consisting mainly of ghastly musical puns. His "Erotica" variations <Shickele 36 EE> for banned instruments and piano is only one example. A "per­vertimento" on the theme of the last movement in Beethoven's "Eroica," the banned instruments 
consist of a "Windbreaker" (ap­parently cardboard cylinders of various lengths brought together to 
g1·ve the 1·Jlus10 n of p1'pes) ·, balloons·, a slide whistle (on which he even manages a trill>·, a "slide windbreaker" <more cardboard cyl1'nders--he must have used a lot of paper towels·, only with a slide attachment th1's ti'me) ·, a "lasso d'amore" (developed, explained Shickele, by 18th century cowboys)·, and the final variation featured the impossible com­binatt'on of the foghorn, the bell, and the kazoo--all played by Shickele at the same time with 
piano accompaniment. 
'l'he show gained a semblance of continuity amid delightful chaos by Shickele's running commentary before each piece, which I suspect was geared to instructing the non-musicians as well as entertaining all with his daffynitions of musical terms. 
"An allemand left," Shickele gravely explained from the "Notebook for Betty-Sue Bach" (S. 13 going on 14), "is an 18th century dance for left-footed people." 
The "corrate" :-"as defined as a 
Japanese corruptiOn of the French courante, and Shickele executes it mumbling the while in surrogate Japanese, grimacing, and delivering karate chops to the piano. Such is Shickele's method for making classical music more palatable. He followed this up (and 
it was a tough act to follow up) with a "Toot Suite " for calliope \see picture).· Consisting 
· 

of three movements-the preloud, the O.K. chorale, and the fuga

· h

the "fuga vulgaria" is for t ose who recognized it actually as the "Song of the Volga Boatmen" adapted for calliope--another example of Shi~kele's subtle punmanship. 
After intermission Shickele explained that PDQ Bach's music must be absorbed in only small doses by the listener, in order to 
allow the body to develop enough "aesthetic antibodies for it," so the program diverted to a slide show. Shickele showed the process of discovering the rare PDQ Bach manuscripts, a pictorial biography of PDQ's life and times, and close­ups of his letters and musical scripts--in all, an imaginative documentary. 
Shickele first conceived the idea of PD<I Bach while still a student at Juilliard, and the show

premiered in 1965 at Town Hall in New--York for the public. The show changes a bit from year to year to keep it contemporary, but remains basically the same. 
"I think I reach even the non­musicians," Shickele explained. "I've got a fairly wide range of humor, and try to keep it wide in the show to appeal to the entire audience." 
Offstage, the man is just as entertaining. Shickele recalled during intermission those early days when he struggled through John Thompson's Teaching Little Fingers to Play. <Does that haunt vou, all who can remember the i1ightmare of piano le8sons?) He's come a long way since then, to be sure. But he combines the im­pudent innovation of a Charles Ives, the appeal of a Leonard Bernstein, and the humor of some· old music prof you might find at the University of Northern South Dakota to exploit classical music to its most palatable and enjoyable possibilities. Too bad if you've had the opportunity to avoid it, and did.

Student govt offers party and activities info 
by Tim Truesdell Staff Reporter 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary~s studerlts seeking parties and social activities can now get this in­formation from Walker Holloway's Student Government office. 
The idea of the program was conceived months ago when Holloway was involved in the Information and Activities segment of Student Gove:-nment. His desire in organizing the new service was to furnish the student with suggestions for lo~ating various parties. 

"I wanted the function of the . office to be a lot more than simply a hidden date concept," Holloway commented. 
The operation of the service is rendered mainly by telephone. Guys are to supply the office with details of the party and should explain the type of desired dress. Girls may peridically check with Holloway to locate gathering which might appeal to them. 
LaFortune counseling center opens to aid minority students 
by Mark Derheimer Staff Reporter 
A Minorities Counseling Center has been established in the basement of LaFortune Student Center to deal with the financial, academic. vocational, or personal problems of all minority group 
nH:mbers. 
The Center is located on the 
north side of the basement next to 
the Morrissey Loan Fund. The 
idea for a minorities center 
originated with its two staff 
members: Ann Williams and Clark 
Arlington. 
Ms. Williams, a first year law student. serves as the Center's counselor. Second year law student Arlington acts as the ombudsman. 
The purpose of the Center is to 
provide an outlet for counseling of 
minority students besides those 
offered at Psychological Services 
in the Administration building. 
Arlington stated that he and Ms. 

Williams direct themselves "towards the psychological, social, and academic problems of the minority group individuals, being receptive to problems and seeking their remedy." 
Besides counseling the Center publishes a newsletter every two weeks. The Center also has in­formation regarding graduate school scholarships for minority students. and inquiries from in­dustries seeking to employ minority group members. A current project of the Center aims to bring black women to the university during tliis semester for social activities. 
The Center is open Monday through Friday and can be reached at 283-6343. Those students wishing to receive the newsletter should contact the Center to have their name placed on the mailing list. 
All minority students are urged 
to make use of the Center. Any 
ideas or suggestions about the 
scope or goals of the center are 
welcomed by the staff.

Six year sentence 

NY w-o.man convicted of rape 
by Lacey Fosburgh 
(C) 1972 New York Times 
New York. Feb. I5--A 19-year-old girl who is believed to be the first woman ever convicted of rape in New York State--and possibly in the country--was sentenced to six years in prison today by Supreme Court justice James Leff. 
The girl's male companion was sentenced to 25 years. 
The two were convicted Jan. 17 of holding two 20-year-old girls captive in a Greenwich Village apartment for nine hours and forcing them to perform sexual acts and take LSD. 
Erma Mitchell, of Newport Nl'ws. Va .. and Robert Byrd, 28, were specifically found guilty of two counts each of both rape and sodomy in the first degree and numerous counts of robbery, assault. coercion and unlawful imprisonment. 
The rape charge against Miss 1\litchcll stems from her role as an accomplice in the nine-hour episode that began late the af­ternoon of July 2, 1972, when she met two girls and invited them back to her apartment. 

It ended early the next morning when one yictim managed to escape from the apartment and ran naked. screaming for help, down the street. About an hour later. she returned to the apart­ment with the police and Miss Mitchell and her male companion, Byrd. were taken into custody. 
The two victims, a hairdresser and a waitress from Atlantic City, 
N.J .. who had come to New York for the day, were hospitalized, suffering from physical injuries, one from a broken nose. 
The women. often weeping, testified at length against the defendants during the course of the three-week trial. 
Assistant District Attorney Jack 1\1. Kress explained that although the circumstances surrounding the case and the amount of force and

brutality involved were ex­ceedingly unusal, legally, the case was quite simple. 
Under the New York state rape Jaws. as they pertain to this case, he said in an interview, had Byrd not been there, the charge against Miss Mitchell would have been sodomy. 
A woman can theoretically be just as guilty of rape as the man involved. Kress explained. · 
"I realize the service 1s opinionated but it help alleviate the idle time." he continued. 
The office has planned to give suggestions on meeting places in various parts of the country over the spring vacation. 
Holloway will attempt to compile a list of motels and bars which are frequented by students in Florida and in Kentucky for the Derby. The Indianapolis 500 Time Trials will also be studied for possible student gatherings. Those persons traveling east for skiing trips are urged to give their plans to Holloway so he can relay the location to others. 
Contact Office 
Further information about the service can be obtained from the Student Government Office or by ealling Holloway at 7417 between the hours of 3:00 and 4:30 p.m. during weekdays. Secondly, he noted that posters describing the program are currently being distributed on both campuses.

Hence the expression "don't get the bear." or "don't let the bear get vou." 
In spite of his consistently poor showing by most standards, Mecca feels he makes a contribution. "Whenever they (other swim­mers l are down in the dumps they challenge me and beat me and feel better." As long as the others know they are not the slowest, Mecca feels he is helping the team. He also helps out at meets. 
Mecca. despite his deep voice, can be softspoken when he speaks sincerely. He gets that way when he speaks of two things connected with swimming. One is the team, coach and timers. Of the coach, Mecca says, "Coach Stark has 
always given me as much time as 
he has given anybody else on the 
team. and I've never brought home 
a point for Notre Dame. That is 
u·hy I really admire that guy."
