"I told them I'd be back. Get out of my way, John. I told them I'd be back," the gunman told fellow Standard-Gravure Co. employee John Tingle, who approached him before the 30­minute shooting rampage be­gan. 


"I said, 'How are you, Rock?"' Tingle recalled. "He said, 'Fine, John. Back off and get out of the way ... all the way to the wall."' 
Tingle and other employees nearby then ran into a bath­room and locked the door. 
Police searched every floor of the three-story Standard­Gravure building for victims.

Vivienne Verdon-Roe demon­strated her faith in democracy when she said Thursday, "True patriotism is speaking up when you see that your country is off course. That is the only way that democracy can work." 
Verdon-Roe, a peace activist and award winning film maker, expressed her concern for end­ing global poverty, the threat of nuclear war. and environ­mental destruction in a lecture sponsored by Notre Dame's Institute for International Peace Studies. 
After the lecture. Verdon-Roe showed her documentary "Women-For America, For the World." which features the opinions of many women peace activists on the nuclear arms race. This film won an Academy Award for the best short doc­umentary in 1987. 
"This film features women speaking with common sense and compassion about the nu­clear threat," said Verdon-Roe. "They show that you don't have to be an expert to have an in­formed and reasonable opinion. Women who understand that if we have the courage to speak with our hearts, we can make the difference." 
In 1983, Verdon-Roe and her associate Ian Thiermann founded Educational Film and Video Productions, a non-profit center which supports the pro­duction of films and videos on the nuclear arms race, and other social issues. 
Verdon-Roe hopes that the videos will inform the public of the nuclear threat and other pressing global problems such as poverty and violence. She said, "Not knowing doesn't solve our problems. Our prob­lems are now crisises. President Bush, in spite of improved rela­tions, is still planning new strategies to fight nuclear war with the Soviet Union." 

Verdon-Roe said that such plans that would increase the likelihood of nuclear war show, "a consistent lack of respect for life. It seems that people today are learning to respect the inanimate things such as money, possessions, and sym­bols more than respect for the living." 
She cited the controversy over the flag burning as an example of how far the United States has deviated from its ideals. Verdon-Roe asked, "Are we forgetting our reverence for the values that the American flag represents?" 
"The man who burned our flag is concerned about our country's support for the killing in South America," said Verdon-Roe. "It seems to me

Alumni get preference for away game tickets 

By JANICE O'LEARY 
Staff Reporter 
Many students have ques­tioned the number of University of Michigan tick­ets allotted to the student body. 
According to Jim Bell, as­sociate ticket manager, the University is given 5,000 tickets for any away game against University of Michigan, Michigan State, or Purdue. As students have ticket preference for home games, "first priority is given to alumni for away games," Bell said. 
Two hundred tickets are held aside for students for these games. "Students are not guaranteed tickets," stated Bell. 
Out of the 200 tickets al­lotted to the students, 50 tickets were made available to those who purchased the roadtrip package through SUB, said Kara Lenahan, services commissioner for SUB. 
The hotel reservations for the roadtrip were cancelled due to reasons not disclosed at this time, but those stu­dents who had purchased the package were still given their tickets and offered the bus ride and a $20 refund, said Lenahan. 
So, in effect, only 150 tickets were put into the lottery, said Lenahan. The 7 5 winners were announced Monday, and each winner was given the opportunity to purchase two tickets, said Lenahan. 
The only exceptions to the 5,000 tickets given to Notre Dame for away games are those held at either the Orange Bowl or the Meadowlands, said Bell.

Car thefts threaten safety of cars at N D 

By KELLEY TUTHILL 
Senior Staff Reporter 
Notre Dame has had several stolen car incidents on campus in the past week. 
According to Phil Johnson, assistant director of security, Security officers were investi­gating a car in the D-2 parking lot when they discovered wires hanging from the broken steer­ing column. 
Upon an initial check of the plate the car did not register as stolen, said Johnson. "However, the officers were confident the vehicle was stolen as it looked stolen," said Johnson. 
Notre Dame Security worked with the Michigan and Niles Po­lice as the owner resides in Niles. The owner was contacted and stated that the car was in­deed stolen, said Johnson. The car is being held by Security un­til the South Bend Police 
Department takes custody of 
the vehicle for evidence.

a 1987 silver and black Pontiac 6000 LE was stolen from campus, said Johnson. He said the vehicle was recovered later on September 2 by the South Bend Police Department. 


On September 7, a 1989 silver Cheverolet Celebrity was stolen from Corby Hall and has yet to be recovered, said Johnson.

Skulls pierced by bullet holes, mummified corpses. and trenches full of bones laid undisturbed for decades while the So­viet government refused to acknowledge the estimated 20 million vietims of Stalin's bloody years of terror. Now they are coming back to haunt the eountry, as about once a month for the past year the official press has reported the unearthing of another mass grave as the Soviet Union reveals the horror of its past. 
"Very aggressive treatment is needed," said a eardiol­ogist Thursday in Caleutta, where Mother Teresa's condition worsened after developing chest pains and a high fever. The set­back oceurred less than a week after the Nobel laureate suffered a heart attack. "There is a heaviness in the chest," the cardiolo­gist said. "This is very serious." 

NATIONAL BRIEFS 
Black members of Congress, who increased in number from 1 :{-24, are enjoying unprecedented power as they advance through the !louse seniority system, and are sitting on $2 million in eorporate-donated money which they hope to use to increase their effectiveness. The money was not on the formal agenda for the Congressional Black Caucus's annual "Legislative Weekend" when it opened Thursday, but it was a principal behind-the-scenes topic as thousands of black political leaders gathered from around the country. 
If it repealed or relaxed a law that reduces the Social Secu­rity benefits of senior citizens who earn more than a limited amount of outside income, the government would come out ahead, aecording to Thursday report by a group of House Republicans. GOP critics of Social Security's earnings test released a private study coneluding that at least 700,000 retirees would rejoin the labor market if the law were scrapped. The new workers would generate more in income and payroll taxes than the government would pay out in increased Social Security benefits.

The Hungarian-born star of such films as "Pieture Mommy Dead" and "Queen of Outer Space" was arrested .June 14 after a policeman stopped her for having expired regis­tration tags on her $215,000 Rolls-Boyce convertible. While the officer was checking for other infractions, Gabor allegedly drove away, only to be caught again two bloeks away. At that point she allegedly slapped the officer. If convicted, she faces up to two years in jail and a $4,000 fine. 
Actor Rob Lowe paid his debt to society this week for his sex video by speaking to inmates at detention and rehabilitation cen­ters in his hometown of Dayton, telling them to set goals and "believe in something." While in Ohio, Lowe took a side trip to visit former Cincinnati Reds star Pete Hose. "Pete's always been kind to me," Lowe said. "We both have had rough years. But friends arn friends and I need friends."

As a girl, Elizabeth von Trapp ran through the hills near her home in Hyde Park, Vt., singing songs from "The Sound of Mu­sic." It wasn't so much theatrics, though, as family tradition. Now she will fill another family role by stepping onto a stage to portray hnr grandmother, Maria von Trapp, whose flight from Nazi-occu­pied Austria inspired the musical. "I grew up listening to the al­bum with my cousins, and we'd all take parts," said Elizabeth, 35, who learned the tale of the family's flight on her grandmother's knee.

GEM expands and offers new doctorate programs 
By Paul Millea News Staff 
The National Consortium of Graduate Degrees for Minori­ties in Engineering, or GEM (Graduate Education for Mi­norities) has recently instituted two new programs for minority students interested in earning a doctorate degree in engineering or science. 
Previously, the organization offered fellowships only to those who wanted to earn master's degrees in engineer­ing. 
As a result of the growth of GEM into a national center, the organization moved into a new building , located at 1118 N. Eddy St. said Linda Wells, as­sociate director. The building will provide the space necessary for their expanding staff. Their previous Cushing Hall office, according to Wells, "had inadequate space for as many people as we needed." 
The Ph.D. fellowship 
program is scheduled to begin 
in the fall of 1990, according to 
a GEM release. Twenty-five 
students will be admitted to 
each program next year and 
forty are projected for every 
year thereafter. 
Howard Adams, executive di­
rector of GEM, believes that the 
new building will serve as a 
"National center which will bet­
ter help us serve a wider range 
of students and serve them at 
the Ph. D. level." The fellowship 
offers tuition, paid summer re­
search, mentors on campus, 
and an annual stipend. 
To qualify for eligibility stu­dents must be a U.S. citizen a junior or senior in the engineering or natural science field, a member of an underrepresented ethnic minority group (Black, American Indian, Mexican American, and Puerto Rican) and have an academic record reflecting the ability to com­plete a doctoral degree, ac­cording to the GEM release. 
GEM, whose headquarters are at Notre Dame, seeks to close the gap in the underrep­resentation of minority groups in graduate programs for science and engineering. The organization, established in 1976, hopes to bring minorities earning graduate degrees to a 
level  more  representative  of  
t~eir  numbers in the popul a­ 
tiOn.  

GEM is a not-for-profit orga­nization jointly sponsored by 55 accredited science and engi­neering schools as well as 70 major corporations and re­search laboratories throughout the United States. 
According to Adams, "Our three main areas of focus are: one, meeting the challenge of recruiting and assisting minor­ity students nationwide and providing them with the finan­cial resources necessary for graduate and doctorate studies through our fellowship pro­gram; two, initiating and fos­tering faculty involvement on the importance of graduate study; and three, producing current and readable materials that demystify the graduate school application process." 
-After a student has been ac­cepted as a GEM fellow, the initial phase of the program in­volves working as a summer in­tern for one of the employer members, according to the or­ganization's annual report. 
After this 10-14 week salaried period, the student en­ters the GEM member school where he has been accepted to begin his studies.

Salvagers find sunken treasure 
Associated Press 
CHARLESTON, S.C.-Sal­vagers working off South Carolina have begun recovering a golden booty of bars and coins valued at up to $1 billion from a steamship that sank in a hurricane 132 years ago, a spokeswoman said Thursday. 
"It's certainly the largest American treasure trove of all time," said Harry Schatz, a di­rector of Columbus America Discovery Group, which located the wreck of the SS Central America three years ago. 
The gold bars and coins aboard the SS Central America include fortunes made during the California Gold Rush, said historian Judy Conrad of the Columbus America Discovery Group. 
"I never dreamed it would be like this," Thomas Thompson, a director of the group, told The Washington Post in a story published Thursday. 
The paddle-wheel steamer was traveling from Panama to New York on Sept. 12, 1857, when it sank about 200 miles off the coast in 8,000 feet of watnr during a hurricane. The wrnck claimed 425 lives; 153 peopln survived. 
Thn Central America was car­rying a regular monthly ship­ment of gold from the San Francisco Mint to New York banks via the Isthmus of Panama. 
The estimated three tons of gold was valued at $1.2 million. 
based  on  the price of gold of  
about  90  cents  an  ounce  in  
1857.  At  today's  prices  -

Verdon-Hoe said, "I'm wor­rind that we're losing touch with our vnry basic values. Our loss of understanding is forcing us to destroy the very things that give us life: the air, the land, the water." 
Yet, Verdon-Hoe believes that, "We can solve these problems, if we face them. The Chinese word for crisis is made up of two words meaning danger and opportunity. This is a time of great opportunity."

was stolen.  
Between  September  10  at  

8:15 p.m. and September 11 at 
11 :50 a.m. there was an at­tempted auto theft in the D-2 lot. The auto was a 1989 red jenp. A window was broken and the plastic casing on the steer­ing column was broken and wims were exposed. 
"I ask that students pay at­tention as they walk to and from the lot. If they see any­thing suspicious they should drive to the gates or call Security irnrnediatnly. If stu­dents sen a suspicious vehicle, perhaps a car without a decal, they should write the plate numbnr down and give Security a call. We would appreciate the assistance," said Johnson. 
after making their fortunes in California appear to have been aboard the ship, Schatz told The Associated Press during a ship-to-shore interview from aboard the recovery ship Arctic Discoverer, which has been at the salvagp, site since July. 
Historians originally believed 
the ship sank off North 
Carolina, but research led the 
Columbus America group 
south. The Central America was 
located in 1986 and identified 
last year when the ship's bell 
was raised. 
The salvagers began bringing up the first artifacts last month, recovering about 500 pounds of gold so far, Schatz said. 
In recent weeks, gold bars, including one weighing 62 pounds, rare "double eagle" coins valued at up to $20,000 each, and gold coins made by private California mints and valued at up to $15,000 have been recovered, said Pamela Adkins. a spokeswoman for the expedition. 
At such values, "it isn't out of the realm of possibility" that the overall value of the Central America's cargo could swell to $1 billion, Thompson told the Post. 
Thompson, a specialist in un­derwater mining and robotics, was on the expedition ship Arctic Discoverer on Thursday and could not be reached for comment. 
Schatz said much depends on how much personal gold from the passengers is recovered. 
"We don't know the extent of the cargo of valuables," he said, adding it could be sizeable because passage on the steamer cost the equivalent of $6,000 in 1989 dollars. 
lie said much depends on how 
much of the treasure can be re­
covered, adding, "We feel we 
can fully recover the site." 
"That billion-dollar estimate 
is probably the most frequently 
heard figure on the treasure's 
value," said shipwreck expert 
E. Lee Spence of Sullivan's Island. 
He said, however, that an es­
timate of a couple hundred mil­
lion dollars would be realistic, 
adding that that amount could 
be higher depending on how 
much gold the passengers were 
carrying. 
Adkins said the salvors 
"really don't have a fix on the 
amount of passenger gold," but 
"the value of it really depends 
on the quality of what they 
bring up, the rarity of what 
they find and demand." 
To recover the treasure, the salvage crew is using a com­puter-based imaging system that allows searchers to see objects far below the surface and an underwater vehicle equipped with video cameras and a high-precision robotic arm. 
The expedition was financed by 106 investors, mostly from Columbus, Ohio, where the group is based, who put up their money in a limited part­nership, the Columbus Dispatch reported Thursday. 
Thompson, who put up no money, could receive 40 percent of the proceeds from sale of the recovered treasure, the news­paper said. 
The salvagers found the wreckage with the assistance of a computer program that ana­lyzed data gleaned from hun­dreds of newspaper articles about the Central America's sinking, Ms. Conrad said. The expedition paid close attention to references to tides, currents and wind directions.

Tank barge runs aground in NY 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-A tank barge carrying 3.8 million gallons of gasoline ran aground in the East River Wednesday night, causing what the U.S. Coast Guard termed a "major gaso­line spill." 
Authorities closed parts of the East River and the Triborough Bridge as a precau­tion. · 
The barge, the Marania 440, was being towed by the tugboat East Coast when the barge struck bottom and ran aground just north of the Triborough ­Bridge at about 9:45 p.m., said Petty Officer Jeff Crawley, of the Coast Guard public affairs at Governor's Island. 
An undetermined amount of gasoline was leaking into the river, Crawley said. 
"We're talking like a major gasoline spill, but I don't know any amount at this time," Crawley said. 
Crawley said Coast Guard pollution personnel were on the scene, working with the fire and police departments, the city Office of Emergency Management and Department of Environmental Protection and the state Department of Environmental Conservation.

Two were found as ofl1cers led 
Mayor Jerry Abramson through 
the building, adjacent to The 
Courier-Journal newspaper. 
"We also found a fellow sit­

ting in a corner that was just 
shuddering in fear," Abramson 
said. "lie hadn't been shot, but 
he was in shock." 
Five of the wounded were in 

critical condition with multiple 
gunshot wounds, hospital offi­
cials said. One person who was 
not wounded suffered a heart 
attack and was taken to a hos­
pital. 
"It looks like a battle zone ... with the blood and the people involved tlwre." Abramson said. "ThPrn w1~re bodies lying ar.ross stairrases. It was just frightening." 
Wesber.ker ent1~red the build­ing at S:30 a.m. with a duffel bag, an AK-47 semiautomatJr. rille. two MAC-11 semiauto­matic mar.hine pistols, a .38­r.aliber handgun, a 9mm auto­matic and a bayonet, Police Chinf Hichard Dotson said. 
"lin was loaded for bear." Dotson said. It was undear how many shots he firnd from the AK-47, the same type of gun used by a man who killed five school children in Stockton, Calif., in January. 
Wesbncker took an Hlevator to third-floor offices. pulled the rille out of his bag and opened fire, police and witnesses said. 
"lie was up there looking for bosses," Tingle said. "lie couldn't lind none of the bosses and couldn't find none of the supervisors. lie was just in too deep to turn back. So he just shot anything that was dose to him."

President Michael Shea said he 
did not know of any threats or 
the nature of Wesbecker's dis­
ability. 
''I'm at a loss to speculate on anything," Shea said. "What's going through my ming right now is sympathy and caring for the people who are involved." 
The gunman was found face­down in a pool of blood on the floor of a pressroom. The pistol was discovered under his body and the rille was a few feet away. 
Dotson said his officers had come "close, but not that dose" to apprehending Wes­becker. 
A woman who answered the telephone at a house where Wesbecker's mother was stay­ing said the family did not want to comment. 
"We're just in shock like ev­erybody else. We had to find out over the television. No one called us," said the woman, who did not identify herself. "I guess he was just a sick person. That's all." 
The newspaper building was evacuated after the shootings. At least two downtown blocks were sealed off and a dozen ambulances lined the streets.

Exxon effort may not have helped 
Associated Press 
VALDEZ. Alaska-Exxon's infusion of thousands of oil­spill cleanup workers and mil­lions of dollars into Prince William Sound did as much harm as good. fishermen charged Thursday as the six­month cleanup ground to a halt. 
"It's time that everyone real­izes that no amount of money in the world is going to restore Prince William Sound to a pris­tine condition." said Riki Ott of Cordova District Fishermen United. 
While about a third of the sound's fishing fleet worked for Exxon this summer. and in some cases profited hand­somely. fishermen who opted to fish suffered from a restricted 
salmon  season  and  a  poor  
catch.  
With  most  of  the . sound  

closed for fishing. fishermen were forced to compete in a small area for a few fish. "This

year we were like rats penned inside a cage." said Dave Clarke of the Prince William Sound Seiners Association. 
In addition, businesses that depend on fishermen suffered because much of Exxon's cash was not spent on fishing sup­plies and gear, Clarke said. 
"The money spill has proba­bly been as devastating as the oil spill." Clarke said. 
The fishermen's observations came at a news conference as Exxon continued to return the last of the cleanup workers from oil-tainted shorelines in the sound. Exxon officials said 
they  expect  to  declare  the  
summer  cleanup  over  Friday,  
25  weeks  after  the  tanker  

Exxon Valdez cracked open on a reef and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil. 
While the fishermen did not criticize their colleagues for ac­cepting Exxon's cash, they said the money has caused an emo­tional division between those who accepted and those who did not. Fishermen scraping by this season fear they may be at a competitive disadvantage next year because they can't af-ford better boats and gear. 

The money has become "just 
another stress factor" from the 
spill. Clarke said. 
Ott said the cleanup effort 
stemmed more from public re­
lations needs than environmen­
tal concerns. Once the Friday 
cleanup deadline was set. 
Exxon began using warmer wa­
ter and higher pressure to hose 
down the oiled shorelines 
faster. doing more harm than 
good. she said. 
"The beach cleanup should not be evaluated on the amount spent, the amount of equipment and people working on it. It should be evaluated on its ef­fectiveness," Ott said. 
Ott said her group favors a "permanent scaleback" of the cleanup. with smaller "strike forces" set up to respond to sensitive areas threatened by oil washing off the shorelines. 
"We don't want thousands of people on the beaches again," she said. "It was about as bad as the oil spill itself." 
At the height of the cleanup. Exxon had about 12,000 people working on the effort, about 3,000 of them on the shorelines.

Kroger Co. sells nine food plants 
Associated Press 
CINCINNATI-Groct'ry store chain Kroger Co. said Thursday it has agreed in principle to SPll nine of its food manufacturing plants, including an Indiana op­eration, as part of a $4.6 bil­lion corporate restructuring begun last fall. 
The nine plants are among 11 Kroger is selling as part of the restructuring, which was launched in part to stav£1 off two unsuccessful takeover bids for the company. 
Negotiations are under way to sell the remaining two plants, the company said. The grocery chain said it expects to reap after-tax proceeds of $260 million from the sale of all 11 units. 
Cincinnati-based Kroger owns and operates supermar­kets. convenience stores and food processing plants in 32 states. 
Company officials said Thurs­day they had signed a letter of intent to sell eight food manu­facturing plants to a corpora­tion to be formed by New York City businessman Eli Jacobs of New York and Engles Capital Corp., of Dallas, Texas. 
The eight plants are North Coast Bakery, of Cleveland; De­light Products, of Springfield, Tenn.; Kenlake Foods, Murray, Ky.; Pontiac Foods, Pontiac, S.C.; State Avenue plant, Cincinnati; Tara Foods, Albany, Ga.; K.B. Specialty Foods, Greensburg, Ind.; and Pace Dairy, Rochester, Minn. 
The eight plants' new owner will offer jobs to the plants' current employees and also may employ some manufacturing personnel now working in Kroger's Cincinnati headquar­ters offices, Kroger said. 
The transaction ineludes an agreement to continue offering Kroger's private-label prod­ucts, company officials said. Kroger said the deal should be concluded by mid-November. 
In a separate transaction, 

Kroger said it has agreed to 
sell its Meadowland Creamery 
in Conroe, Texas, to Borden 
Inc. 
The remaining two plants, Kroger's Gateway Bakery and Heartland Farms Dairy, both in St. Louis, are under considnra­tion by separatn buyers. Kroger said. 
Negotiations are undm way for the bakery with Alpha Baking Co. of Chi<..ago, while an unnamed party is bargaining for the dairy, Kroger said. 
should watch Hugo earefully, he said. 
"It's a storm that's been steadily increasing every day," (iross said, adding that eondi­tions are favorable for more strengthening. 
At noon EDT, Hugo's center was located near 13.3 north latitude and 48.7 west longi­tude, or about 815 miles east of the Lesser Antilles. The storm was moving west at 15 mph, down from 20 mph Wednesday night. 
Its highest sustained winds were 85 mph, up 10 mph from the center's advisory six hours earlier.

EDITORIAL 
Drug plight must be fought on all fronts 
Last Tuesday, President George Bush publicly an­nounced the strategy for the war on drugs that both he and drug czar William Bennett devised. 
The growing problem of drugs must be attacked from both the supply and demand-sides. President Bush has not only allocated significant funds to combat drug im­porters but he has also earmarked billions for educa­tion and treatment. 
It is crucial, however, that the war on drugs be waged not only in the streets and in the classrooms but also in the homes and churches. Communities must become outraged at the problem of drugs in order for the President's agenda to be effective. The government can do only so much to help motivate communities, but by making the war a drugs his number one priority President Bush has shown his administration's outrage and hopefully the local communities will follow his lead. 
In addition to leading by example, President Bush has also allocated a substantial sum of money to law en­forcement, nearly doubling the amount currently given to local law enforcement agencies. If members of the community are to become outraged they must be pro­tected from the drug dealers they are fighting. 
Rev. George Clemens, a Catholic priest in Chicago, has launched a successful grassroots campaign against stores that sell drug paraphernalia. Although his life has been threatened numerous times he continues his fight and his supporters are growing in number. If others are to follow his example there must be ade­quate protection from the government and the President's emphasis on enforcement will help. 
The Notre Dame and Saint Mary's communities must also become outraged at the problem of drugs. More importantly they must begin to do something about it. Students must begin to educate and fight against drugs in their home communities as well as at school. 
Although there are probably no crack dealers in your dorm there are still ways you should help. Students must no longer turn their backs on people they know who have a drug problem, they should confront them and get them help. In addition, those who live off cam­pus should help lead the fight to get drug dealers out of their communities. 
The dark specter of drugs will not be eliminated overnight. However, with the help of communities {ours included), the government, and the church the problem can be eliminated with time and persistence.

University to aid in ensuring off-campus security 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing regarding a matter of concern to all of us in the University community. In recent months, there has been an increase in violent crime in the neighborhood directly adja­cent to the university. Notre Dame and Saint Mary's stu­dents have been included among the victims. These crimes have included assault, armed robbery, and in one case, a shooting. 
My purpose in writing is to alert all students, as well as staff and faculty, to the poten­tial danger of the area, espe­cially after dark. University Se­curity advises me that caution is necessary when walking through the neighborhood. Safety information is available to all faculty, staff, and stu­dents through the Security De­partment. 
the University will continue to participate with the student government, neighborhood or­ganizations, city government, and local law enforcement agencies to ensure the safety of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students. Meanwhile, I urge you to exercise caution and good judgment should you live in, or plan to walk through, this area.

'Casual user' should not be the prime target in drug war 
Dear Editor: 
Dave Bruner's recent spewing forth on the subject of drugs (The Observer, Sept. 13) leads me to make two comments. First, it always amazes me when people go on and on about the evils of drugs while not realizing that alcohol is the dominant drug in our society. We regard it as a part of our life, and an especially signifi­cant part of college life. This is as true at Notre Dame as it is elsewhere. 
Mr. Bruner wants to target the casual user. However, it is not the casual user who is committing criminal acts in order to finance their habit. In fact, more people have died from the abuse of alcohol ­from physical effects such as liver or heart disease which can be caused by social drinking, as well as from drunk driving ac­cidents -than from an occa­sional toke on a joint. 
Yet, these latter miscreants are the ones which he and others of his ilk see as the cause of the breakdown of the fabric of society. It is not the casual user who is engaged in violent drug activity; the possi­bility of jail time will not deter the addict, but punishment seems to be the only solution. 
Second, Mr. Bruner seems to have no notion of the right of privacy or the concept of being inn_ocent until proven guilty. 
According to his logic, people should be tested, whether or not there is any suspicion of drug use, in order to prove to the powers that be that they are not guilty of the perceived heinous act. Laying aside whether casual drug use is such a major crime against society, it seems. to me that violating a person's constitutional as well as innate right to privacy ex­cept, possibly, in the most ex­treme of circumstances, is a great blow to a truly demo­cratic society. 
Perhaps Mr. Bruner should reexamine his support for some of the most fundamental tenets of our society.

For those students who would rather be at the Notre Dame-Michigan game than watch it on TV, a trip to Ann Arbor, Michigan is great way to kickoff the official 1989 road­tripping season. 
Ann Arbor is approximately 130 miles from South Bend and the drive (if one obeys the legal speed limit) would take close to three hours. Depending on the traffic, the roadtripper can chose which route to take. One way is to go up US 31 north to US 12 east in Niles, Michigan. Go east on US 12 to US 23 north. Go north on US 23 through Ypsilanti into Ann Arbor until there are signs for the University. 
The alternate (and less senic) route would be be to take US 31 to US 12 to US 131 north to 1-94 east into Ann Arbor. Another option would be to take US 12 to I-69 north to 1­94 into Ann Arbor. 
Besides tailgaters; there are other pre-game activities for the roadtripping Irish. The Notre Dame Club of Ann Arbor will be sponsoring a pep rally and pre-game party tonight at 8 p.m.-12 a.m. at the Ann Arbor Inn at the corner of 4th and Huron in downtown Ann Arbor for those who wish to start the festivities a day early. 
students kick 0 
The pre-game party will include entertainment, food and a cash bar in addition to appearances by the Notre Dame cheerleaders and the Pep Band. 
No matter which route you take, be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to reach the sta­dium. The stadium is a good hike from the campus, and since the stadium can hold over 100,000 people, it is safe to as­sume that the nearest parking spaces will be already occupied by the time you arrive on Michigan's campus. 
The city of Ann Arbor has a population of more than 107,800 people and the University of Michigan itself has about 40,000. Ann Arbor is a truly a college town, and the university is almost fully inte­grated into the city so there is shopping and parks and non­campus life nearby. The diver­sity of the town allows road­trippers who don't have tickets to the game to enjoy it even if they don't make it to the sta­dium. 
There are several popular establishments where football fans can go for food and drinks. A particular favorite amongst Irish fans is Dooley's. If you didn't get a ticket for the game (or didn't have enough money to buy tickets from scalpers) Dooley's is the best place to watch the game.

An Irish victory always makes a roadtrip worthwhile, but the game is only part of the overall roadtrip experience. Before and after the game, fans will be all over Ann Arbor checking out the bars and restaurants. Ac­cording to the Michigan Daily, the following establishments are a few of the hottest spots in town. 
But first, some basic things you need to know: Even though the drinking age is 21, many bars legally admit people over 18, but trying to use a fake ID is usually not a good idea; in some places this applies more than others. Also, Michigan laws provide that liquor cannot be sold after 2 a.m. and bars close accordingly. 
Drink 

CAMPUS AREA DOOLEY'S 310 Maynard­You'll probably find a lot of Domers here. It's an Irish pub with a copy of the Notre Dame Victory March on hand for the DJ to play each time the Irish score. They offer pizza, subs, salads, and plenty o' beer to wash it down. 
UNO'S 1321 S. University­Domers hailing from Chicagoland might recognize the name; downstairs is said to be the best pizza in Ann Arbor, and upstairs becomes a 21­and-over bar after 10 p.m. The restaurant's full menu is avail­able, in addition to an assort­ment of munchies. Space is limited, and as a result the bar quickly gets crowded and noisy. 
GOOD TIME CHARLEY'S, corner of S. University and Church Streets-You only have to be 18 to get in. so Charley's is mainly an undergrad hang­out. Once you've fought the crowds to get in the down­stairs, beer is in abundant sup­ply. The upstairs was recently transformed into a sports bar, to go along with the small dance floor. 
RICK'S, 611 Church St.­Rick's features live entertain­ment nearly every night. You must be 19 to enter, and pay a $2-$5 cover charge. Rick's has a small dance floor, pool tables, and a games center take up most of the available space in this dark, hot, but lively bar. 
DOMINICK'S, 812 Monroe St.-Dominick's is one of the more popular bars in Ann Ar­bor. The daiquiris and beer is served in old mason jars, but using a fake ID to buy it is the wrong idea. If you are buying a drink, you'll be asked to prove you are 21 and often the man­ager walks around and confis­cates drinks from underage drinkers. Dominick's closes at 10 p.m., but there is more than enough time to partake in the full menu of food. 
NECTARINE BALLROOM, 510 E. Liberty-The campus dance-bar, it avoids Top 40 like the plague. "Proper attire is re­quired" for all of those over 18 who want to let it all out on the spacious dance floor. There is a cover charge and drinks are expensive. 
the game inside of Dooley's than inside of the stadium. When in Ann Arbor, Dooley's is definately the best place to be. 
Since most of Ann Arbor's hotels and motels will be booked solid, the best place to spend the night would be in the dorm room of a friend who goes to the University of Michigan. Unfortunately, not every roadtripper is going to know someone on campus (or tlwy may not feel comfortable on campus depending on the outcome of the game) but there are several hotels and motels in the outlying areas which may have vacancies. 
Two hotels which are just outside Ann Arbor are Wellman Accomodations in Horton, Ml 517-563-2231 and Governor's Inn in Lexington, MI 313-359­



DOWNTOWN 
THE QUALITY BAR, corner of William and Main St.-Offers great burgers to go with ex­pensive drinks. The atmosphere adds to the comfort of Ann Ar­bor's newest bar. You need to be 21 to sit outside on the roof. 
THE BLIND PIG, 208 S. First-Houtinely features na­tional acts ranging from blues greats to up-and-coming rock­ers to folk stars. There is al­ways a cover charge and the beer is fairly cheap. Plenty of parking is available. 
Food 
In case you're hungry for a more substantial meal, Ann Ar­bor offers many different types of dining experiences. You can eat at the following restaurants before hitting the bars. and you can visit places like The Brown Jug or Denny's after the the bars close at 2 a.m. 
THE EARLE, 121 W. Wash­ington-The portions are kind of small, but the setting is cozy. Featuring regional French and Italian dishes, not to mention the music of the omnipresent Rick Burgess Trio. 
GANDY DANCER RESTAU­RANT, 401 S. Depot St.-Ex­pect a long wait during football season, but time passes easily at the piano bar. Featuring American favorites and seafood, you can't beat the am­bience of the location-inside an old railroad depot.

Watters returns home to tailbacks ot 
By STEVE MEGARGEE 
Associate Sports Editor 

As far as he's concerned, Ricky Watters is 
back where he belongs. 
"I loved playing flanker because of the experi­
ence I got, but there's no place like home," said 
Watters, after moving back to his original posi­
tion of tailback. "That's where I've played all my 
life. Even when I watch football games, I always 
look at the tailbacks." 

Watters rushed for 80 yards on 12 carries 
against Virginia, in his first game back at tail­
back. The junior from Harrisburg, Pa., also 
caught two passes for 42 yards and had 67 
yards on punt returns. 

That game marked a successful recovery from the adversity that hit Watters his sophomore season. 
Near the end of spring drills his freshman year, Irish coach Lou Holtz announced that Watters would move from tailback to Tim Brown's vacated position of flanker. 
During his sophomore season, Watters was feeling the pressure of replacing a Heisman Trophy winner and studying in a demanding ar­chitecture program. Though he had some im­pressive outings, catching four passes for 108 yards and two touchdowns against Air Force, many thought Watters' was never really happy at flanker. 
"The only reason I moved to flanker is because I needed to move there; it was necessary for us to become a great team," said Watters. ''I'm much more at peace now. I always wanted to be a starting tailback at a major college." 
Watters switched his major later in the sea­son, but the worst news was yet to come. That happened during the team's trip to California. 
The day before the top-ranked Irish were preparing to face second-ranked Southern Cal, Watters and fellow tailback Tony Brooks ar­rived 40 minutes late for a team dinner meeting. The two players were suspended for the game and sent back to Notre Dame because of "repeated irresponsible tardiness for team meetings and functions." 
"It was terrible, the lowest point of my life," 
Watters. "We went out and got lost, and 
h Holtz did what he had to do. I guess all 
happen for a reason."

EAST RUTIIEHFORD, N.J. -Lou Holtz, who often uses boxing analogies in team speeches, watched his team turn in a Mike Tyson-type per­formance Thursday night at Giants Stadium. 
Scoring touchdowns on each of its first five possessions, Notre Dame opened its national championship defense with a 36-13 Kickoff Classic win over Virginia. 
"I don't know if we can play much better th.an we did in the first 25 minutes," said Holtz. 
The Irish dealt their first blow when Todd Lyght intercepted Virginia quarterback Shawn Moore's pass on the third play from scrimmage. Six plays later, Ricket Watters skirted two yards into the end zone untouched. The ensuing extra point gave the Irish a 7-0 lead. 
A tight Virginia team never recovered, looking like a Carl "The Truth" Williams in the ring as a heavyweight champion.

By GREG GUFFEY Assistant Sports Editor 
This year, the battle for No. 1 will be 
played in S~ptember. 
With the hype for Saturday's Michigan-Notrn Dame game, one might think it was late December with a na­tional title hanging in the balance. Heality shows that it is mid-September, the first game for the hosts and the second contest for the Irish. 
But even in this early season, no one can deny the importance that this game carries. A win would be just a small stnp in a long road to a national title for eitlwr tnam, but a loss eould, for all practical purposes, nnd a team's shot at that mythical crown. 
"It has seemed to be a turning point the four years I've been here," Irish fullback Anthony Johnson said. "It seems to be the point of the season where you realize whether the season is going to go well or bad. Things started to turn around here when we won there two years ago."

Coaches Lou Holtz and Bo Schembechler, who served at the same time as Ohio State assistants in the late 1960s, have built one of the top rival­ries in the country during the past three years, games with heroes, goats and many surprises. 
In 1986, Notre Dame lost 24-23 at home in Holtz's debut as head coach. The following year at Michigan Stadium, Notre Dame handed Schembechler his first opening-game loss as the Wolverine coach, 26-7. Last year at Notre Dame Stadium, Irish kicker Reggie Ho provided the heroics, kicking a 27-yard field goal late in the game to give the hosts a 19-17 victory. 
"The game always has a storybook ending," Irish guard Tim Grunhard said. "I just hope it's a storybook end­ing for us this year." 
One streak must end in this game. Notre Dame has won 13 consecutive games, while Michigan has a streak of 10 straight games without a loss which includes a 17-17 tie to Iowa in 1988. Notre Dame has won two straight games against the Wolverines and no

the second-ranked squad. Notre Dame 
has been involved in seven of those 
games, with a record of 3-0-1 as Jhe 
top team and 0-2-1 as the second­
ranked team. Michigan has been in­
volved in two such games, a 35-12 loss 
to No. 1 Notre Dame in 1943 and a 12­
10 loss to No. 1 Iowa in 1985. 
The last time Michigan held the pre­
season No. 1 ranking was in 19R2. The 
Wolverines lost to Wisconsin 21-14 in 
their first game. Notre Dame then as­
sumed the top spot and dropped a 25-7 
contest at Michigan. 
Irish offense vs. Wolverine defense 
The key for both the Irish offense and 
the Wolverine defense will be Notre 
Dame quarterback Tony Rice. When 
Rice goes, so go the Irish, evideneed by 
Rice's 16-2 record as the starting signal 
caller. If Michigan is to have any 
chance, it must control Hice. 
Hice passed and ran at will in the sea­
son-opener against Virginia in the 
Kickoff Classic. He completed 7 -of-11 
passes for 147 yards and carried eight 
times for 70 yards. 
Last year against Michigan, Rice ran 
seven times for 52 yards and orches­
trated drives that set up four Irish field 
goals. This year, the Michigan defense 
is ready. 

The front three of tackles Brent 
White, Warde Manuel and nose guard 
T.J. Osman form a solid base for the Wolverine defense. Said White, "Last year, I saw Tony Rice running that op­tion for touchdowns. This year, I see him running the option, but I don't see him running it into the end zone for a touchdown. I don't see that at all." 
Michigan is stronger at the linebacker spots with all four starters returning from a season ago. Inside linebackers 
J.J. Grant, one of Michigan's two cap­tains, and Erick Anderson recorded 77 tackles each last season, while Alex Marshall and Bobby Abrams combined for a total of 106 tackles in 1988. 
"The strength of our defense is our 
linebacking," Schembechler said. "We've 
got more depth and better linebacking 
then we have had in, ohh jees, I can't 
remember when." 
If the strength of the front and linebackers is not enough, The Sporting News rated Michigan's secondary as the top unit in the country. Safeties Tripp Welborne and Vada Murray combined for nine interceptions and 128 tackles in 1988. Short corner David Key and wide corner Lance Dottin round out the quartet that could give Rice problems. 
Rice's favorite target against Virginia was Haghib Ismail, who pulled down five passes for a career-high 121 yards. That duo could be challenged by that strong Michigan secondary. 
No one has been able to shut Rice and the Irish offense down in well over a year. Michigan has the talent to put an end to that streak. 
Wolverine offense vs. Irish defense 
This could be the biggest test of the The line of Tom Dohring (290 
pounds), Dean Dingman (292), Steve 
Everett (270). .Joe Cocozzo (294) and 
Greg Skrepenak (320) is the heaviest 
line in the history of Michigan football. 
Those f'ive will test an Irish ddnnse 
which surrenderPd just 3.6 yards per 
carry on the ground against Virginia in 
the Kickoff Classic. 
"They have some good linmnnn tlwn~." 
Irish ddensive end Scott Kowalkoski 
said. "The biggest thing you have to use 
is your quickness and not get timl up 
with them. You have to be big, but I 
think speed, quickness, knowing your 
assignment and technique help you 
more." 

The line hopes to give quartmback 
Michael Taylor pl<~nty of protection. In 
1988, Taylor completed 76-of-122 
passes for 957 yards and ruslwd RO 
times for 116 yards. Taylor is the lorw 
experienced quarterback for Michigan 
after senior Dmnetrius Brown was de­
dared academically ineligible. The per­
formance of Taylor, an explosive quar­
terback comparnd by many to Major 
Harris of West Virginia and Shawn 
Moore of Virginia, could determine 
Michigan's fortunes in the game. 
"He's a very competitive and elusive 
quarterback," Notre Dame nose guard 
Chris Zorich said. "We will treat him 
exactly the same way we treated Major 
Harris." 
In the Fiesta Bowl, Notre Dame hdd Harris to 13-of-26 passing for 166 yards and an interception. The Irish de­fense held Moore to 85 yards on 1 0-of­22 passes in the Kickoff Classic. 
Said Irish cornerback Todd Lyght, "Michael Taylor is an excellent Quarter­back. lie's very conservative in that he doesn't like to force the ball. lie likes to control the ball with a lot of running and a short passing game." 
Notre Dame will try to force Taylor into third and long situations where he is forced out of his gameplan. That would bring the strong Irish secondary of Lyght, Stan Srnagala, D'Juan Francisco and Pat Terrell into the pic­ture for Notre Dame. The quartet recorded 20 tackles and two intercep­tions against Virginia. 
"If we're able to shut down the run and force them to pass, we should be in good shape," Lyght said. 
When Taylor does pass, he will look for senior receivers Greg McMurtry and Derrick Walker. McMurtry pulled down 27 passes for 470 yards and three touchdowns last season, while Calloway caught 1 R passes for 272 yards and four touchdowns. Tight end Derrick Walker is also a threat after catching 15 passes for 260 yards and a touch­down in 19R8. 
The Wolverines arc also strong in the backfield with juniors Tony Boles, Leroy l!oard and .Jarrod Bunch. Boles carried the ball 262 times for 1408 yards in 1988, Hoard 130 times for 752 yards and Bunch 50 times for 221 yards. If the offensive line can clear a path, that trio could post some impressive num­bers Saturday afternoon.

But the expression soon turns into a relieved smile. because this year when the defending national champions visit Michigan Stadium. White will throw around his 6-foot-5, 248-pound frame -instead of hurling a pair of crutches.

"I think of (former Irish lleisman winner) Tim Brown running back kicks and scoring touchdowns. If you look real close at the film from two years ago, you can see me throwing my crutches around on the sideline." 
Since arriving in Ann Arbor from his hometown of Dayton, Ohio, White has spent far too much time on the sidelines for his taste. The knee injury kept him out of the first seven games in 1987, and when here­
turned  he  managed just nine  
tackles in  the  remaining five  
outings.  

Considering White played in all 13 games as a freshman and was making a bid to start when the car accident sent those hopes reeling, a mere nine tackles were plenty of cause for gritting one's teeth. 
"Before the car accident I thought I was really on course," White says. "I was

very confident in my abilities. You reach a point where you know you can make things happen, and then something like that slaps the heck out of you and sets you back. 
"The worst part was the dragging out of rehab and not being able to play. And losing a starting spot because of injury -that made me really angry." 
And determined. All White could think about during his time off the field was football. 
"My girlfriend back at home got mad at me because I stopped writing," White recalls, smiling. "I've been told I'm hard-headed. pig-headed, stub­born and all that. But one thing I'm not is a quitter. Getting back to football was the only thing on my mind." 
When his return was not as impressive as he had hoped, White worked harder. Run. Lift weights. Practice pass-rushing 
moves: swim technique, rip technique. Get to the quarter­back. Grit the teeth. 
"Coach Reed (defensive line· coach Tom Reed) would look at me after I started playing, and one time he said, 'I guess it's back to the drawing board, ' I 
felt like I wanted to punch him, " says White, a former high school wrestler. 
His intensity was under­standable. Here was a former USA Today and Parade Magazine All-America high school star, the Midwest Player of the Year as a prep senior, a man who can get to the ball quickly and punish the unfortu­nate player holding it, faced with the thought of starting over. 
Says White: "It really was back to the drawing board, back to the beginning." 
The beginning of White's col­lege career almost took place somewhere else, following a re­cruiting process packed with as much drama as a Big Ten sea­son itself. 
Most of White's high school followers, naturally, expected him to commit to Ohio State. White made visits to the cam­pus in Columbus, watched Buckeye games and knew many of the assistant coaches even before the time approached to choose a college.

Unlikely hero Reggie Ho celebrates with his teammates. 
Irish get a kick out of Ho 
By VIC LOMBARDI 
Sports Writer  
'Twas  the  show  where  Ho  
beat Bo.  
Reggie Ho,  a walk-on place­ 
kicker  who  decided  to  play  

football just because he "didn't want to be a geek," booted an Irish-record four field goals on the way to a 19-17 thriller over Bo Schembechler's Michigan Wolverines in the 1988 season­opener. 
Time Capsule 
Ho's 26-yard game-winner came with a minute and 18 sec­onds remaining, just before Michigan's Mike Gillette sent a 48-yarder wide right on the last play of the game. 
The senior pre-med major, who was better known for his 
3.8 grade-point average than his football prowess, became an instant hero after connect­ing from 31, 38 and 26 yards out before nailing the winner. 
"Nobody was going to hit me, so I wasn't too nervous," said the 5-5, 135 pound Hawaiian native. "But I have the best holder in the world in Pete Graham, the best snapper in the world in Tim Grunhard and 280-pound guys on the line." 
It was the young and unexpe­rienced offensive line, which in­cluded four first-game starters, that worried Irish coach Lou Holtz most. Yet, the big-men, led by All-America tackle Andy Heck, answered the call as Notre Dame took an early 13-0 lead. 
Sophomore flanker Ricky Watters brought back memo­ries of the great Tim Brown when he burst up the middle for a first-quarter 81-yard punt return. An extra-point by Ho gave the Irish a 7-0 advantage, as Bo was on his way to a sec­ond-consecutive loss to Notre Dame. 
After stifling two Michigan drives, the Tonys-Rice and Brooks-each scampered for 18-yard runs to set up Ho's 31­yard chipper with 29 seconds left in the first period. That made the score 10-0 and there was more to come. 
On the ensuing kickoff, the Irish recovered a fumble by Michigan's Leroy Hoard to set up Ho's second field goal from 38 yards out. With a 13-0 lead, the Irish were talking blowout. 
But Bo's troops refused to buckle. Michigan's next drive featured 62 yards of rough 'em-tough 'em running, the typ­ical Wolverine style. Quarterback Michael Taylor led the Michigan wishbone attack to set up Hoard's one-yard touchdown plunge. Suddenly, the score was 13-7 and Michigan had the momentum. 
The Wolverines struck again late in the third quarter after putting together another long, pounding drive. This time Taylor faked the handoff to Hoard up the middle and waltzed untouched into the endzone. The play juked the en­tire Notre Dame defense, in­cluding linebacker Mike Stonebreaker who finished with a game-high 19 tackles. Gillette converted the PAT and Michigan enjoyed its first lead, 14-13. 
The Irish pushed the ball on the following drive but had to settle for another field goal after being stopped on the Michigan 10. Ho's third kick, a 26-yarder, gave Notre Dame a 16-14 edge. 
After scoring in two of the three previous drives, Michigan's offense looked overpowering. With the ball on their own 20, Taylor pushed his troops across midfield before being stopped at the Irish 32. From there, Gillette nailed a towering 49-yard field goal to give the lead back to Bo and the Wolverines. 
Down 17-16, the Irish had 80 yards and 5:34 remaining to score. Tony Rice came out throwing. His first attempt to 
Ray Dumas drew a 15-yard in­terference penalty that moved the ball to the Irish 42. Two plays later, Rice flipped a screen over the middle to Brooks who scampered to the Michigan 38. After two time­outs and five straight running plays, Ho set up for the kick that made him famous.

Medjugorje apparitions versus Mater dolorosa 
This is the feast of Our Lady deliver us from the wicked of Seven Sorrows. The Congre­fiend. "Religion begins with the gation of lloly Cross (C.S.C.)

God is not the enemy from whom we need to be saved-for is He not acting like our enemy if He is waiting to zap the human race with punitive horrors? Satan is the enemy; we need to be saved from the devil and all his  wars that could end in a nu­clear holocaust are the Lord's doing, and not those of mankind's ancient enemy-or if He is going to allow these ter­rible things to happen, because He is displeased with us, maybe we should all become atheists. Then we'd only have half as much to worry about, because we'd only have one cruel enemy  Christian religion loses its meaning; because Christ, loving Ilis own, cannot save them, by His love, from hell and high wa­ter; out of deference to the anger of llis Father, lie has to allow them to be trashed, though, like llis enemies at the cross, they don't know what they're doing, p,ither.

I'm not out to rain on anyone's parade. Medjugorje may be beautiful; and that's not surprising, because millions of beautiful people go there. Su­pernatural things happen to the Pentacostalists every time  would be too confusing; and thn justice of God, if it has the last word over love, would be alto­gether unfair. I don't know why I should keep thn peace about Mndju­gorje-as I try to do, on cam­pus at least-while the hype  
agony imposed on her by the belief that whatever happens is the direct will of God. It is in­tolerable for her to see that perfect little body deprived of life; it is doubly tormenting for her to think God has played this dirty trick on her. She is tempted to d11ny God, rather than believe heaven can be so unkind. A wise, wonderful Anglican priest points out that this un­happy mother has stood reli­gion on its head. Heligion does not begin, he says, with the as­surance that everything is un­der the hand of almighty Provi­dence.

For God does not need to invent temptations to try us. Our own wayward desires, the bad ex­ample of our neighbors, and the trials inevitable in a world of creatures colliding with each other, will provide us with temptations enough. We cry to the God of Salvation to rescue us from mischief. As far as I can see, the chil­dren of Medjugorje, bringing us warnings of God's impending anger and the punishment of the world that lies ahead, are contradicting the hope offered by the Gospel. The helpful  verted and Jive. How complicated the problem of suffering would become if Christians were back on square one, trying to placate an angry God, in contradiction to the revelation we have from Jesus, Who showed us the love in His Father's face. Then the Chris­tian would be under duress. on the one hand, from the fallen angels; on the other hand, God, in this scenario, would be standing in the wings, waiting to box Christian ears through some world-wide calamity that would, without doubt, bring undeserved punishment on the four-fifths of mankind to whom the Gospel has never been preached.

The lightning from on high strikes repeatedly wher­ever the faith-climate is right; even non-Christians have mira­cles to boast of. The world is in terrible shape; I'm not too blind to see that. People need to be saved from the consequences of the mis­takes they are making. Some of the mistakes could leave losers deprived of grace-incapable of loving and being loved, possibly forever; and this would be the hell they have created for them­selves. Yet God is on their side, yesterday, today, and forever. If He isn't, the New Testament is flawed by false promises. The Medjugorje message could be right; but if it is, the rest of the  keeps going, tempting thn stones to cry out about the way Catholic Christianity is being turned on its head. Catholics who keep their eyes fixed on a hillside in Yugoslavia where a cross has been plantnd, for a warning of the terror to eome, should glance back at that other hillside outside the Jerusalem wall. Calvary's cross, like the appearance of thn rain­bow in Noah's sky, initiated a covenant of peace; and as a sign of love and reeonciliation, it has no rivals. This is the cross the Mother of Sorrows stood by, weeping. What else could have brought her from there on Golgotha to Medju­gorje except the imagination of children?

page 14 The Observer 
Young receivers making strides 
opener against Virginia was a 
great game for the Irish, but
Irish 
continued from page 20 
Another reason not to start celebrating, selling t-shirts or writing books yet is the sched­ule. Last year, the Irish played in the ultimately non-threaten­ing atmosphere of Notre Dame Stadium seven times. This year, the noticeable reduction in sea­son ticket prices means one thing...fewer home games. 
The schedule also shows the big two, Michigan and Miami (with apologies to USC), on the road. Does anyone really want to go to the Orange Bowl to play Miami in any situation, let alone Notre Dame in a critical game? 
Penn State is a different team from last year; Stanford will be tough at home. 
Last season, the Irish rode the high of Ho all season, using the Michigan game as a confi­dence builder. This year's the slow second half was as much a cause for concern as the first half was a cause for celebration. 
Tlw Irish also have to over­come the losses of five key play­ers at the beginning of the sea­son. The experts were all be­hind the Irish until the axe fell. Then, they weren't so sure. 
But no one can be sure about the Irish. No one can bll sure of anything in the world of college football. No one thought the Irish would contend last year. The pre-season 13th-place ranking was said to bn an over­estimation of' Notre Dame's abilities. 
Orw more thing to remem­ber-most of the conventional wisdom doesn't apply to Notrn Dame. The Irish have a way with wins, and ABC and the pollsters might. just might, be right this time. 
By STEVE MEGARGEE 
Associate Sports Editor 
When you discuss Notre Damn's wide receivers with thP Irish assistant coaches, certain words always seem to spring into the conversa­tion. 
Words like "young," "talent." and "steady" are favorites of Notre Dame re­ceivers coaches Tony Ynlovich and Pete Cordelli. 
But thP most important word of all may be "improvement." (or as Yelovich puts it, "progression"). Because no matter how the Irish pass­catchers may look right now. it appears as though the best is yet to come. 
"There's been a steady progression each practice and each game," said Yelovich. "There's been a steady progression with ev­eryone. We're still not close to where we have to be, but we're steadily improving." 

The biggest example of improvement so far has come from flanker Raghib "Hocket" Ismail. The highly­touted sophomore caught 12 passes for 331 yards as a split end last year. 
After just one game this season at flanker, he's close to matching those 1988 fig­ures. In the Kickoff Classic. Ismail had five receptions for 121 yards. 
"(Ismail) has a lot of self­confidence, he's running his routes extremely well and he's very involved in the game," Yelovich said. 
Perhaps there's no bigger contrast in styles of re­ceivers than that between Ismail and split end Pat Eilers. Ismail was highly-re­cruited from Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and much-publicized for his 4.28 speed in the 40. 
Eilers transferred from Yale and worked his way up the depth chart at tailback and split end before earning a starting role. 
"If you look at athletic skills, Pat Eilers can't be a split end on a major college football team, yet you can't keep Eilers off the field," said Irish head coach Lou Holtz. 
The situation couldn't be much better at tight end, where Notre Dame has two players in Derek Brown and Frank Jacobs who could star for most major college teams. 
The youth factor emerges when you look further down the Irish depth chart. After senior Steve Belles, a former quarterback and tailback, the Notre Dame receiving corps is stocked with under­classmen.

Schembechler has won everything except a national title 
By GREG GUFFEY 
Assistant Sports Editor 
This is the second of a two­part feature on Michigan foot­ball coach Bo Schembechler. 
Bo Schembechler made his in­
tention clear when he arrived 
on the Michigan campus in 
1969-he wanted a trip to the 
Hose Bowl in his first season. 
Bo inherited a Michigan team coming off of an 8-2 season, 6­1 in the Big Ten, but the Wolverines had posted losing seasons in two of the previous three years. 
Michigan met Ohio State and Woody Hayes on the last Saturday of the season for the Big Ten championship. Hayes came into Ann Arbor with one of the best teams in his coach­ing history, but Bo and the Wolverines pulled the upset, 24­12, to earn a trip to the Rose Bowl. 
They lost to Southern Cal 10­3 in the Hose Bowl. but Schembechler had established a rich tradition. 
In the next five years, Schembechler and the Wolverines dominated oppo­nents. In that span, Bo com­

\ 

piled a 50-4-1 record, but still only went to the Rose Bowl once. The reason? Bo's friend and nemesis, Woody Hayes. 
With Bo and Woody at the helms of their respective teams, Michigan and Ohio State played out possibly the greatest rivalry in the country. The teams met­and still do meet-in the last game of the season, with the Big Ten title usually in the bal­ance. 
In 1971, Michigan defeated the Buckeyes 10-7 to earn the trip to Pasadena. Ohio State won 14-11 in 1972 and 12-10 in 197 4. The two teams tied 10-10 in 1973, and a vote by the con­fen·~nce athletic directors sent the Buckeyes to the Hose Bowl. 
After Hayes lost his job for allegedly punching a player in the 1978 Gator Bowl, the ri­valry lost some of its mystique. 
The two teams still play the last game of the season, but without Hayes as Bo's .foil on the other side of the field, the game seems somewhat less im­portant. 
At Michigan, Bo has turned out 38 first-team All­Americans. That list is like a Who's Who of Michigan foot­ball and includes quarterbacks 
Rick Leach and Jim Harbaugh, 
halfbacks Butch Woolfolk and 
Dave Brown, receiver Anthony 
Carter, guard Mark Donahue 
and tackle Dan Dierdorf. 
Schembechler also holds 
down the position of athletic 
director at Michigan. He took 
charge of the basketball pro­
gram last fall and appointed 
assistant Steve Fisher to coach 
the team. Fisher guided the 
Wolverines to the national title, 
and Bo then made him the per­
manent coach. 
The attention and power that Schembechler has at Michigan is incredible, but Bo still insists he is not bigger than the pro­gram. He is just football coach and athletic director among a college with over 30,000 stu­dents, just a face in the crowd. 
"People say 'You won the (Big Ten) championship. You went to the Rose Bowl. Hot damn, the national championship in basketball!' So everyone thinks we're gonna sit around on our ass here and pat ourselves on the back-like they're doing at Notre Dame. And the answer is, 'No!' We're not going to do that." -Bo in September 1989 issue of Sport Detroit Magazine 
If there is any blemish on Bo's resume, it is the absence of what he terms "the mythical national championship."

Despite the huge success of Bo's Michigan teams, he has never won a national champi­onship. Ten of his 20 teams have won 10 or more games in a season and the top 10 streak is phenomenal, but the national 
championship still hangs  over  
him.

Bo knows the game with the Irish cannot win him the title, but a loss might end Michigan's chances for another year. 
"We will be at a disadvantage against Notre Dame," Schembechler said. "Notre Dame played their first game two days after we practiced in pads for the first time. Your greatest improvement through­out a season is between your first and second games, and they have two weeks after their first game to go ahead and work toward us." 
When Saturday comes, you can bet Bo will have his team ready. No team has ever beaten Bo three consecutive years, and he doesn't want the Irish-the team he wanted to play for in high school-to be the first. The first he would rather see is an unbeaten season and that mythical championship.

Clemson's future bright after beating Florida St. 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Associated Sports Editor 
It happens every autumn. 

An upstart team takes advan­tage of a lightweight schedule to put together an undefeated regular season. Syracuse did it in 1987; West Virginia followed suit last year. 
An early contender this sea­son: Clemson of the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
Following a 34-23 thumping of Florida State last weekend, Clemson's only remaining non­ACC opponents are Virginia Tech on Saturday and arch-ri­val South Carolina on Nov. 18. 
Clemson, the 1981 national champion, consistently domi­nates the ACC (nicknamed the "Always Clemson Conference"). 
North Carolina State has been Clemson's main nemesis, upsetting the Tigers each of the last three seasons. The Wolfpack must play at Clemson's Memorial Stadium nest month. 
Clemson's other main com­

petitor in the ACC -Virginia ­
never in its history has de­
feated the Tigers. 
Pre-season prognostications had Clemson going through a rebuilding season. With star running back Terry Allen, who never lost a fumble during the 1988 regular season, leading the way. the Tigers should be favored in the rest of their games. 
The ACC champions play in 

the Florida Citrus Bowl at 
Orlando. If Clemson avoids a

The University of Washington coach was touted as a genius when the Huskies made regular New Year's Day bowl appear­ances earlier this decade. 
After breaking a 10-year string of bowl bids last season, Washington may be ready to return to the elite. The Huskies dumped Texas A&M 19-6 last Saturday. 
"They were awesome against Texas A&M," said Purdue coach Fred Akers, whose team heads to Washington this weekend. "That score could have been 40-6." 
"When you lose at LSU, it's like a mortuary around here," Tigers coach Mike Archer said earlier this week. 
It'll be "The Dead Zone" at Baton Houge this weekend, as Florida State and LSU each light for their first wins of the season.

The rnatchup, expected to be the premier early-season game in the South this year, now is a contest between two desperate teams. 
LSU, ranked seventh in the pre-season, has had a week to brood over is year-opening loss to Texas A&M. Florida State, ranked sixth in the pre-season, has allowed 30 points in each of its first two games. 
"(Florida State) is a team that returns a lot of people from a defense that dominated people last year," said Archer. "The biggest thing they miss is Deion Sanders. There's no question what he meant to that team." 
Air Force quarterback Dee Dowis, who has achieved minor celebrity status for his early­season exploits, could soon be headed for some major hype.

arrives on campus Oct. 14. 
The Air Force press guide calls Dowis the best option quarterback in the country. Against Tony Hice, he'd have a 
chance to prove it. 
Aside from Notre Dame, the hottest team in the nation just might be Tennessee. 
The Volunteers, who lost their first six games in 1988, carne back to win their final live contests. They're now 2-0 after bouncing UCLA 24-6. 
Tennessee's offense had no turnovers and no penalties against UCLA, as the Volunteers had three touch­down drives of over 80 yards. 
But it's the defense that has changed the Volunteers' for­tunes. Tennessee coach Johnny Majors makes no secret of his displeasure with that unit's performance in the first half of the '88 season. 
"That was the worst unit I've had in my coaching career, on either side of the ball," Majors says of that defense.

If Tennessee's defense isn't sharp against Duke on Saturday, the Volunteers might be in for a long day.

in the nation. "Duke will be by far biggest test we've had in secondary," said Majors.  the our

Florida coach Galen Hall got to spend the summer watching state newspapers hold polls concerning who should replace him (the fans' favorites were Duke's Steve Spurrier and Louisville's Howard Schnellenberger). 
Hall's tenuous hold on the coaching job got even looser last weekend when the Gators were upset by Southeastern Conference also-ran Ole Miss. 
Couple that with the Southern Miss stunner over Florida State, and the state of Mississippi has a 2-0 advan­tage in games against Florida schools.

Who says nothing good comes out of the Michiana area? 
Notre Dame students have made a science out of slamming South Bend's ·lack of excite­ment, but you won't hear any complaints from Irish volleyball coach Art Lambert 
In fact, he is actually grateful for one of the products of the burgeoning metropolis of South Bend-junior setter Amy White. 
The South Bend native strolled onto the Notre Dame volleyball team as a walk-on her freshman year, taking the court as a righthanded left side hitter. 
Today , things are different 
The only thing that has re­mained the same is her work ethic and her adaptability.

Invitational, it will be as a left­handed scholarship setter. 
"I've always tried to keep an open mind about my role on the team," White said. "I walked into practice one day and coach said 'Amy you're going to learn to hit lefthanded.' And I have to admit, after hitting righthanded for eight years, I was a little skeptical. 
"But I worked at it, and now its second nature. The same goes for setting-we needed someone to fill in that spot when Julie (Bremner) left, so I'm going to do what it takes to get the job done right" 
White has used her versatility to become a steady performer for the Irish, whether passing, serving or setting. 
She already has amassed 63 assists and 18 digs in her first four collegiate matches as a setter, and Lambert believes that is a small sampling of things to come. 
"Amos is a natural," Lambert

Notre Dame will need its set­ters and middle blockers at their best while getting contin­ued good play from a rapidly maturing corps of freshmen.

And fellow freshman Alicia Turner exhibited some of the skills that made her a first­team All-America selection by Volleyball Monthly and Reebok at the high school level, as she recorded 52 kills and eight ser­vice aces in her first four col­legiate matches. 
Two tandems-senior setter Taryn Collins and sophomore setter Amy White, and sopho­more middle hitters Christine Choquette and Jennifer Slosar-will be the key to a strong Irish performance this weekend. 
Sophomore outside hitter Tracey Shelton, who tallied 22 kills while adding 36 digs de­

"Setting's a hard thing to throw at a person. You've got to think about blocking and playing defense, but first and foremost, you have to set the ball. That mean's knowing what your hitters like, where they'll be and who they'll be hit­ting against, just for starters." 
White had worried that after making the transition to left­handed hitter she would be un­able to make the adjustment to being a setter, but her fears have been assuaged. 
"I started to think that all the playing I'd done hadn't led up 
to  anything."  White  said.  "I  
woke  up  one  day  at  ground  
zero.  

"But I love setting; I love to be able to control the game's tempo and know that, win or lose, I have a large part of the responsibility for it I used to alwavs follow the setter, and

White stepped into a setting role when freshman standout Julie Bremner, who set a single­season record with 1,340 as­sists in her first year of college, was selected to play on the United States national team. 
She now competes for playing time with senior Taryn Collins, who has returned to the team after a taking a year off for disciplinary reasons. 
"It's good to have somebody there to make me work hard to keep my spot day-in and day­out," White said. "We make each other better, and Taryn pushes me to improve-some­thing I have to do if I want to be able to do what Julie did for us. 
"I have some mighty big shoes to fill, and I don't expect to be able to reach that level of play immediately."

The Notre Dame women's golf team is looking to make an impact this weekend as it trav­els to the Illinois State Women's Golf Invitational. 
Last year, the Irish finished ninth in the competition. 
''I'm looking for improvement into the top 10," said Irish coach Tom Hanlon. 
The Irish opened their season by hosting the Irish Invitational at the University's Burke Memorial Golf Course this past weekend. After just one week of practice, the Irish placed sev­enth out of a field of 18 teams. 
Piane 
continued from page 20 

"Who fills in the back is up 
for grabs." 

While the Irish want to try and forget the success of last year, Georgetown definitely will remember their visit to Notre Dame and embarrassing defeat last year. 
The Hoyas will have the edge this time because most of their top runners are baek, including John Trautman, winner of the 1988 Meyo Mile. Mike Donahue and 1987 Virginia state champion Danny Ireland also will be looking for revenge on the Irish. 
Piane noted that live of the top six runners in last year's meet against Georgetown were from Notre Dame, but he ad­mits that this is unlikely to happen again. 
"We've beaten Georgetown 
The Irish improved consider­ably from last year's perfor­mance, shaving 25 points off last year's total and turning in a score of 675. 
"I was hopeful of finishing where we did," said Hanlon. "I think that we could've done bet­ter, but overall. it wasn't too bad of a performance." 
Hanlon cited freshman Kathy Phares, who finished with a score of 165, for her outstand­ing performance. 
"She's shown that she's a good golfer, as we thought she would be when we recruited her," Hanlon said of the East Moline, Ill., resident. "We hope that she provides this kind of spark in the rest of the season." 
two years in a row, so I can guarantee that they will be pre­pared," Piane said. "We can't take them lightly." 
O'Connor agrees that the Irish will have a much tougher fight this year than in the two previous seasons. 
"Their coach thinks he has one of the best teams ever at Georgetown, possibly national qualifiers," said O'Connor. "We're a pretty young team, 
Hanlon also credited Bert Bryer (a score of 168), Allison Wojnas (171) and Heidi Hanson 
(174) and Pendora Feeks (174). 
Overall, Iowa State took top honors at the Irish Invitational with a team total of 636, while Michigan earned second place with a combined score of 638. 
Dawn Marting of Iowa State led the individual competition, turning in a final score of 151. 
As for the Illinois Invitational this coming weekend, the Irish hope to continue their im­provement. 
"We'll be more competitive this year," says Hanlon. "We're not where we want to be, but we're trying to get there." 
and this will be an early test for us." 
Piane says that the Irish have trained well enough to defeat the Iloyas for the third con­secutive year, but he still is worried that his runners might be a bit too confident. 
"I think what they have to do is think positively," he said. "I want them believing that they can win without being overcon­fident."
