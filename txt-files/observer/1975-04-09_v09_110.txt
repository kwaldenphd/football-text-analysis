Kelsey discusses alterations in attitude of Christianity towards homosexuality 
Progress in forming a Christian attitude toward homosexuality was traced last night by Dr. !\lorton Kelsey, Notre Dame Pducation professor, at a forum in the Librarv Auditorium. 
Speaking at a panel discussion Pntitled "Christian and Gay," Kl'lsey said the attitude toward homosexuality has changed in the last fifteen years from viewing it as a perversity. then as a deviation. and now as merely variant behavior. 
Kelsev stated the means of identifying sexual behavior are mt•aningless in describing the true situation. "Homosexual and gay <Jnd heterosexual are all ml'aningless words because each can tnclude anything from rape to a simple relationship," he noted. 
Faults with certain institutional responses to homost-xnality were also found. "People who have different sexual attitudes find the church very dissatisfying." Kelsey noted. 
Social and legal institutions must also re-evaluate their positions. KPlsey stated. "Other than being a black in the South. there is no other bigger way to be rejected than to he a homosexual." he observed. 
Noted psychologists. he noted, have given testimony to repressed homosexual inclinations being normal in heterosexuals. 
Kelsey continued. noting that the 
ultimate  acceptance  of  
homose¥uals  is  dependent  on  
individuals  accepting  and  un­ 

derstanding themselves. "Anyone can learn to listen if they ran ac­l'l'pl themselves. I ran find nothing else more difficult than al'cepting the totality of myself," 

Kdsev statl'd. 
In l:onclusion Kelsey said. "As I understand .Jesus Christ. it was his acceptance of people that brought them to a life of love." 
Other participants in the panel discussion responded separately the pastoral and personal attitudes of homosexuality. It was stated that the response related to scriptures is not one of sexuality hut one of alienation. 
The discussion. which was sponsored by Campus Ministry. was co-ordinated by Fr. John Struzzo and was moderated by J<'r. .Jim Buckley. Fr. Struzzo stated that tht' lecture-discussion was hdd '" response to the <Jl'!ive in­tert>st on campus in th1s social

Officials react to changes in SLC 
h)' Martha Fanning Staff Heporter 
The Student Life Council's decision to decrease its mem­bership from twenty-four mem­bers to fifteen has brought varied reactions from campus officials. 
Denis Sullivan, Chairman of the committee studying the future of the SLC. believes that the change was an important one. "The SLC has to change so people will look at it and give it a chance to regain its former position of being one of the potent bodies on campus." 
Sullivan explained that the type of issue the council now deals with are more problem solving than confrontation. "The reduced size of the council should lend itself to solving these issues more ef­fectively," he observed. Sullivan also mentioned that he believed 
that student representatives voted 
for the cut because they believed 
the students could be represented 
as well with five members as they 
could with the present number. 
Ed Byrne. Student Body President, agreed with Sullivan's statement. He also noted that since the Student Life Council is meant to aid students, student

Fr. Carl Ebey, C.S.C., stated, "I don't think reducing the size will increase the effectiveness. The more people you have the broader representation is present." 
A few members of the council voted for the issue with reser­vations and some would have liked the membership reduced to fifteen for a trial period to see if it would help the effectiveness of the SLC. 
Dr. Robert Ackerman said he voted for the action but did so reluctantly. "I was not convinced that the problem was due to the size of the body. I think a lot of things need to be done," he stated. "We need to look at the purposes of the council and how to achieve those purposes. Reducing the size is like treating a symptom rather than the cause." he observed. 
Fr. David Schlaver was basically in favor of the action. "I didn't feel reducing the number of members would be a cure-all. What we need is members willing to work. He also stated that the new size would be more manageable and members would be less inclined to miss the meetings if the group were smaller. 
Hegarty also commented that 
the large degree of absenteeism 
was one of the reasons that the 
proposal had been suggested. If 
this problem were solved a lot of 
repeated and unnecessary 
discussion would be eliminated, 
according to Hegarty.

recommendations of the SLC will

WASHINGTON WPU -Re­
jecting calls for additional 
military aid for Southeast Asia, 
S1•n. Hubert H. Humphrey and 
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy said 
Tuesday they would work for 
massive humanitarian aid to 
refugees in both South Vietnam 
and the Communist-held areas. 

Humphrey introduced legisla­tion to provide $200 million in speedy humanitarian assistan­
ce. 

KPnnedy, D-Mass., during a ht•aring of his Sl'nate subcom­mittee on refugees, rebuked the l•'ord administration for not providing substantial refugee aid to the l'nited Nations and tis specialized agl'ncies aiding the refugees. 
When Administrator Daniel Parker of the Agency for International Development pointt'd out that the Foreign Aid Authorization Act prohibits aid going to North Vietnam, Kt•nnedy said he would work to diminatt' that restriction. 
"Would you support an amendment to strike that prohibition?" Kennedy asked. 
Parker did not answer, pleading that the National Security Council now is review­tog the Vietnam situation and I'resident Ford will make new proposals to Congress Thurs­
day. 
Humphrey told the commit­tee: 
"I think the government has got to make up its mind that it ts in its interest to help suffering people. This country

"There have been no rare or hizarre or tropical diseases among the orphans," said Dr. Alex Stalcup. "What we have found is the garden variety of illnesses. nothing different from what you'd find in the family pediatrician's office." 
Stewart said the weekend siege of chicken pox had eased, and several of the nearly two dozen children who were diagnosed as having chicken pox had now gone on to their fostt•r homes. 
Stewardesses from several airlinPs \'Oiunteered to tend the young children on flights to their new homl's.

S.B. women hold career seminar 
Social worker, described the role of the social worker and its appeal to young women. The overall goal "is understanding exactly what an illness does to the individual and the family." 
Clinical Psychologist, Patricia Crosson. emphasized her main work as a psychologist is in selecting the right therapy technique at the right time. 
The two newest areas in this field are the family therapy and lear­ning disabilities programs. 
Mrs. Crosson advised the women to get their degrees while they are young so they can eventually fall back on them. Through her own l'xperience. she feels it is in­creasingly difficult to go back to school after any extended absence. 
Finally. Dr. Agatha Wilhelm, expert in the field of internal medicine. described her work as more of a "vocation" than a job. Dr. Wilhelm stated, "each in­dividual is different and the challenge of diagnosis and treatment and the ultimate satisfaction of helping another" is her prime incentive. 
The heavy workload and undying dedication requires a great deal of 
n•adjustment on the part of the individual. according to Dr. Wilhelm. She does believe however. that the opportunities in almost all careers are better for women today. 
The seminar tonight will focus on women in social and cultural careers and will conclude Thur­sday with women in the business world. The women will meet in the recreation room in Lewis Hall at 8 p.m.

SLC Future 
The vole by Ihe Sl udenl Life Council lasl Monday lo reduce ils membership from 24 Io 15 may prove bol h misguided and rounler-produclive. 
AI Monday's meeling various reasons \\ t•re given for reducing Ihe membership. 
A popular ('Xplanalion was lhat the SLC was not a legislative body, bul a "problem-solving" one. As a problem­stllving body, lhe SLC could work more l'ffeclively wilh fewer members. 
Tlw move is misguided because lhe SLC should nol be lhe problem-solving body inlo which il has evolved. Il is counler-produclive because what is needed is an increase in representation and expertise on Ihe. Council. 
The SLC is a legislative body, ac­cording lo ils original By-Laws, drawn up in 1969 by Ihe Board of Trustees. ll is a ;riparl ile body of administrators, faculty and sludents wilh legislative power and power of appeal to the Trustees in case of velo by lhe University President. 
The SLC has allowed ilself lo drift from its original mandate loan advisory body. Parlly because of inexperienced student membership and lack of quorum, Ihe SLC has been reduced from a body lhat held great potential as a source of ideas and improvemenls to an organization with no idea of ils purpose or identity. 
The SLC needs new blood. This is not accomplished by culling itself off further from lhe studenls and reducing its size. Instead il must reach more students, more faculty and administrators who fail . o see their inleresls represented there. 
The SLC should Iake a lesson from the work of Ihe Committee on Undergraduate Life (COUL). This committee, established by the Board of Trustees last semester, has investigated areas such as coeducation, residenlialily, finances, academics and student life in general. 
The SLC would be wise lo pattern itself afl er 1he COUL. ll should reach into the University community to find students, faculty and administrators outside the SLC lo serve on similar sub-committees.

SIR. 1!/e'u MISS YO()!
I 
The sub-commitlees would report ' 
1
legislalive recommendations lo lhe SLC 
for final passage. 
This slruclure for lhe SLC has several 
advanl ages. First, it emphasizes the 
leg isla t vie funcl ion of Ihe Council. 
Second, it involves a greater porlion of 
he community in an important decision­
making and idea-oroducing operation. 
This slructure would have offset the 
inexperience of lhis year's SLC because 
members of lhe sub-committees, like 
hose of the COUL, would be primarily 
upperclassmen with some expertise in 
. he area of lheir sub-committee. 
Finally, lhis slructure would provide 
for a permanenl extension of lhe COUL. 
As il stands, I he Trustees must decide in 
May whelher lo renew the COUL next 
year. Since Ihe COUL did much of what 
. he SLC should have done Ihis year, Ihe 
change would merely formalize lhe 
change in power from the current SLC 
slructure to one patterned afler the 
COUL. 
The worst allernalive now is for the 
SLC io be abolished. The SLC has served 
. his Universily well in the past and !Tlade 
im pori ani decisions such as establishing 
pariel als for Ihe first Iime, defining Ihe 
alcohol regulalions, revising lhe judicial 
code. On paper lhe SLC still has great 
power as a legislative body. What. is now 
required is a commitment by lhe SLC to 
be whal is shoould have been all along-a 
legislative body for the entire University. 
Unforl unately by Monday's vote the 
SLC has indicated satisfaction with the 
current attitudes and structure. ll is now 
up to the Sludenl Life Sub-committee of 
:he COUL lo make a recommendation on 
;he fulure of the SLC. 
The Sub-committee has until April21to 
make such a recommendation. They musl lake lhe steps lo apply the ex­perience of an enlire frustrating year. They musl restore lhe SLC to its original legislative function and pump new blood 
inlo a dying body.

The last third of Part ! and most of Part II deal with the unintegrated state of the contemporary artist, the ever-widening abyss between his activity ("Making art") and the abstract goals of the State. Many of the poems are political. However, they stand as poems. They alwavs act as art, not propaganda. They never hammer dogma or opinion over the head of the reader. As Peter Jay asserts in his introduction to 23 :\lod<'rn British PoPts: 
Tht> diHt>rt>nct> bt>twt>!'n a good political Jlot>m and a bad on!' is in their art, not their politics--othl'r things being equal. Neither good pot>ms nor bad Olli'S will build housps, giw frl't>dom to tht> opprpss!'d or prevent injustict>. Art retains its own autonomy. Although a poem may possess a political dimension, the politics lin a "good poem") are always 
subordinated to the artisitic demands of the poem itself. In Matthias' own terms, the poem "is never a statement in words about a human experience, but an object made out 
of  words  that  provides  a  human  ex­ 
perience."  
In  a  sequence of six  poems  !Part  II),

hrl'ath. hloorl <~nd brain alive in con­ll'mpor;Irl· !'XDPI'IPncP. 
And yet. after carefully reading Turns and rereading Bucyrus. there seems to be an implicit paradox, or at least a con­tradiction. in what I've previously said. Is Turns really an experimental as Bucyrus? Yes and no. That is, although not as technically exploratory as the first book, Turns is more experimental in its attempt to transmute the language of experience into a language of art, the forms of poetry into the forms of life. In a note not published in his lifetime. Bt>rtolt Brecht once wrote: "Only new contents permit new forms. Indeed they dt>mand them." Thus, to borrow from lhP magico-religious parlance of alchemy, Matthias continues his experimental quest in turns through an "embodying of the spirit." the "Incarnation of the Divine Word" 1solar opus 1. The net result of such a 
process is the creation of poems whose "pffects in us may combine into a coherent whole of feeling and attitude and produce a 
peculiar liberation of the will" CI.A. Hichards on T.S. Eliotl. 
Divided into three parts, plus a prologue-poem '"No :\pologia-for Diana l and an epilogue-poem 1"Epilogue from a New 
!lome: For Toby Barkan'' l, Turns reveals a formal daring and virtuosity that out­distances Huc~nrs in its depth and breadth of vision. There are fifteen line sonnets I "Double Sonnet on the Absence of Tex­t..." l. prose-stanzas and poems !"Turns,'' ''Three Love Songs for U.P.l."), a series of six peoms written in couplets !Three Around a Revolution" to "Alexander Kerensky at Stanford"), a free translation I ... and Recombination: Fragments from Octavio Paz" l, a letter-form peom ("The Noble Art of Fence: A Letter") and other poetic structures and techniques 
!quatrains.  prose  rhythms,  internal- and  
delayed-rhymes,  etc.).  Obviously,  the  
catalogue could  go  on.  The  fact is  that  

Matthias' mastery of formal skill is only matcher! by his extraordinary range of .. uhjPt'l matter -from the intensely per­sonal to the highly political. 
Part I moves dialetically from the per­sonal to the national to the international sphere of human affairs. At the beginning, it explores the complex relationship, and forms of alienation, that evolve between husband and wife, father and son. artist and institution. Eliciting some of the feelings 
and questions that are an inevitable part o any human intercourse, it a_lso anticipat~s some of the artistic resolutiOns offered m the, last part of the book. .

In America, freedom is given by the Constitution. In other countries, men must struggle to survive, both nwntally and emotionally, in a land where neither freedom of speech, nor thought, is granted. In "the communities of the inhuman," it is "this suicidal privilege and necessary job of the writer" to temper and preserve "the most decisive and complex of human acts -which is speech, the use and transmission of language lthe Logos 1"1 Extraterritorial, George Steiner l. 
Where " a notion of language as itsdf being murderous" exists, poetry is a dangerous business: "the Law" is om­niscient and omnipotent, lethal and ef­ficient.

The poem is "an execution'." The poet must work with the same language that the State uses to carry out its orders. He must execute the language.

....................................... 

This libretto. The words. Without them, there is only, music, acoustics....sweet melodies to dull the spirit. The poet must Pmbody sound with sense, baptize the notes with blood. What he cannot reveal through words ''will be left alone." 
Part III of Turns picks up where Part II leaves off: What is the function of the Imagination in this world. at this moment? Must it be referential? Must •I han' some utility-value? Or, must it be hermetic? l\lust it strive for absolute purity? ThPsp are the questions wP must always raise; the kinds of questions Matthias evokes and brings to a sharp focus in the final section of Turns. 
Significantly, many of the poems from the 
new book were written in England( Mat­
thias spPnt a year there on a Fulbright and 
now returns every summer l. Consequently, 
the poet begins to use what he calls a "trans­
atlantic voice.--a voice that has its roots and 
derives its power from England and 
AmPrica. Thorn Gunn. a British subject 
living in California, would seem to be the 
obvious analogue. Matthias, however, 
actually has more in common, both 
musically and technically, with another 
British subject, David Jones. What he has 
to say about the poet in his review of The 
SII•Pping Lord I Poetry l is telling: "It is the 
voice of a visionary in an age when we seem 
to want our poetry to skate over the surfacP 
of our rlesperate urban lives and number the 
pidgeon shits on the asphalt." For Jones, 
poesis is "a high calling." 

The same can be said for Matthias. A 
formPr studl'nt of Ivor Winters at Stanford, 
poetry, for him. is serious business 1 in a 
sense. maybe the only business l because it 
spPlls the difference between freedom and 
slavery, being human or becoming an 
automaton. In an age when Grand 
Inquisitors and B.F. Skiners loom on the 
horizon like monstrous shadows, the poet 
has his job cut out. Or does he? Or isn't this 
just the problem? After Einstein and 
IIPisenberg, can he I we? l draw the line 
between freedom and slavery, art and 
propaganda? "When propaganda ends, 
noes art begin:" Hardly. Contemporary 
man is either too detached or too immersed 
in world affairs to see, or even sense, the 
shadow beyond the electric torch of the 
TPchnocracy. It is the task of poetry, the 
individual poet, to smash the ice of 
ignorance within us. to shatter the thin 
surface of our life-spheres with "the Word." 
In "Turns: Toward a Provisional 
Aesthetic and a Discipline," the title-poem 
of the book, Matthias seeks to locate the 
proper stance to the central question of the 
artist in any age: What is the function of the 
imagination in this world. at this moment? 
"THIS IS THE QUESTION WE MUST 
ALWAYS RAISE." Either the artist 
produces an· for thl' Herdenmensch or he 
maintains a Hermetic provilege; either he 
becomes enslaved to the "open market" or 
he refuses to serve:

The poet I "schoolmaster" l has no ~hoice: his art and life are on the line. So. "even when everything favors the living," he turns 10 an art of Hermeticism, the isolate nature r-f his craft known only to the elect r "14th lentury men"l . and a life of "austt>re self­discipline." Why?

\ n alchemy. the magister assists in the transmutation of base metals into gold rlapts phrlosophorum l and, in the process, is himself transmuted--attains a tran­scendental mode of being which culminates on the spiritual plane in "freedom, illumination and immortality." Similarly. m the castle of purity, the poet perfects his <1rt as he perfects himself 1"the artisan who works the gold must first of all purify himself" l. He assumes the chaos of language I massa confusa l. gives it form 1solar opus l and, in the process, turns the truth of his life into poetry. On the aesthetic plane. then. the poem achieves its own autonomy of consciousness ("freedom illumination and immortality" l. ' 
Ironically, as the philosophical stone is both the goal and the means in alchemy, so language is both the produce 1poem l and the medium lwordsl in poetry. This am­brgwty pomts to the paradox implicit in alchemy and poetry--the necessity of a creative tension between the maker and th€ material with which he works. As Wallace Stt>vens says in "Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction'': 
. . Two thing~···~·i"~pp~;Jt·;· ..,;·;·t~r<' s<'l'm to

On tht• n•al. This is thl' origin of chang!'. It is also the·~~;g;~·~ra·;;.;i)i"g';;ity'--the tension between th real and the imagined in poetry I as m a~y art l necessitates some degree of ambigu_tty. However, although ambiguity is an ommpresent danger. it is an occupational hazard that the poet must live with. For the poet must never compromise his vision <or wtlfully deceive l. His task is to tell what is there "as it is seen the act occurs" and through that telling, redeem and transfigure that' which has "occurred." In ''Clarification for Robert Jacoby" lthe ~eeond half of "Double Derivation Association, & Cliche ... " l, Matthias doe~ JUSt that, and in the most heautiful way:

lnPIRG-related Courses for Fall '75 
The following lnPIRG-reloted courses 
will be offered for Fall 1975 
and ore open to all majors: 
Philosophy 281: Science and Human Values-9 TT 11 or 1TT 3.. 3credits 
This course entails a Work-Study program for those interested in working on the Mental Patients' Rights Study. Instructor: Professor Edward Manier 
English 309: Nonfiction Prose Writing-9 TT 11 -· 3 credits 
The course would be very flexible, according to the studen1's interest. Prof. Huber will help in the publication and writing of releases and final report of a research project. All research will have to be done by the student with the facts to back it up, as Prof. Huber doesn't feel qualified to check research validity. His instruction will be in drafting the final copies of a project. Instructor: Professor John Huber 
Government 497: Special Studies . 3 credits 
This class would meet one day a week using a totally lnPIRG-related syllabus. The basic outline of the course is as follows: readings will consist of Action for a Change by Ralph Nader and Donald Ross, various InPI RG reports, and a media booklet. These are intended to give a basic understanding of what In PI RG is, how it works, and how it can be used. This would be followed by a short research project done by the entire class to familiarize themselves with researching a subject. The latter half of the course would consist of small group projects. Each group would propose a project, research it, and write a final report. The professor will be available for help in research problems. If presented to the InPI RG Board of Directors, and approved, a final report will be published and released to the media. Instructor: Professor John Kromkowski

"We ran those adds merely as a way to reach out to non-science majors in the hope that they. too, might find physics as attractive a subject as we do." Miller srated.

LaCrosse team drops two 
II\ (;rq~~ Bang!> 

After returning from an un­defeated spring trip in Florida, the Irish I.acrosse Club were un­dt>rstandably looking forward to the start of the upcoming season. However. opponents Bowling <;reen. Michigan State, and the northern Indiana weather all slowed the stickmen down as the Irish lost their first two games this past weekenct at the Stepan Fields. 
TIH· Irish opened their season against Bowling Green. last year's 
1\lidwest  Varsity  Division  
('hampion.  
Bowling Green lost  no  time in  

starting the defense of that title as they opened the scoring early in the first quarter. Notre Dame lost no time in coming back as leading scorer Fedele Volpe scored on an assist from Don "Motor" Trabert. Bowling Green then jumped ahead :1-1 on two quick goals, one by Vern Zabek. the Falcon's All-American canctidate. With five minutes left in the half. Irish attackmen Joe Meares fed freshman midfielder !\lark Connelly perfectly for a "quickstick" that resulted in an Irish goal. Four minutes later, senior midfielder Steve Tarnow scored to knot the halftime score at 
:1-:J. 
The Irish probably wish they hactn 't come out for the third quarter as Bowling Green ran off 
lour unanswered goals, two of which WPre set up beautifully by Z;tt){'k Although Volpe would score two more goals in the fourth quarter. the Falcons kept on rolling as they pulled away to a 10-5 decision. 
Sunday's game with Michigan StatP was a contest which could have gone either way. hut found the Spartans on top at the end. 7-5. Om·e again. it was close at half­1 ime as the Irish held a small 3-2 lead. but State proceeded to score 
four out of the next five goals as they pulled away to a 7-3 lead. Two late Irish goals provider\ the 
final count. The Irish "B" team also opened their season this weekend with the results the same as the "A" team. Playing on an incredibly sloppy field, they dropped a close decision 
to Albion 4-3. Two goals by co­captain Rich Kresock gave the Irish an early lead, but the Britons scored the next four goals before Tom Mouch hit the nets again for 
N.D. 
The stickmen resume their schedule this weekend as the "A" team takes on the Columbus LaCrosse Club and the "ll" team meets Lake Forest College. 


BOWLING GREEN and Michigan State burst the LaCrosse team's undefeated bubble last weekend.

With the season already two days old, and Indian tans already shouting that this is the year (sound familiar~ 1. it is time for "The Irish Eye" to make its um·anny predictions for the upcoming major league hasPhall season.
