Norton/Moscona plans year's activity 
By ERIN LaRUFFA 
Associate News Editor 
After assuming their posi­tions at the middle of last semester, student body presi­dent Brooke Norton and vice president Brian Moscona said they are ready to put their plans for the Notre Dame community into action. 
"We got things together rather quickly," said Jonathan Jorissen, Norton and Moscona's chief of staff. "It was a natural progression this semester." 
According to Norton, the office of the student body president has four goals for the year: to increase campus unity, to improve communica­tion with the student body, to develop the ideal servant leadership within the office of the president, and finally, to increase collaboration among different groups within the Student Union. 
"We think all these things go hand in hand," Moscona said. When they ran for elec­tion last March, he added, everything on their platform related to these four goals. Now that they are in office, pursuing these objectives, according to Norton, will "make Notre Dame a better place and help us reach the students." 
In relation to their first goal, Norton, Moscona and Jorissen said they believe student gov­ernment can play a role in increasing campus unity by providing opportunities for students to learn about other cultures. 
"You can't force people to do things, but you can act as an initiator," Jorissen said. 
The office of the president plans to rely on its diversity division, one of its several specialized divisions. The 
diversity division, they 
explained, is planning several 
events, including discussion 
groups in dorms and a multi­
cultural fair. 
Although Norton said she does not believe Notre Dame lacks unity, she added that she hopes her office can foster an even greater "sense of inclusiveness here on cam­pus." 
"We're already a very uni~ fied student body," said Norton. "But there is always room for improvement." 
The multicultural fair, scheduled for November, will feature ethnic student groups from campus. Jorissen said he hopes that incorporating a variety of cultural groups into the fair will encourage all stu~ dents to attend the event. 
"I think that when people see an ad for a multicultural event. they think it's just for people of that group," Jorissen said. "The multicul­tural fair will help address that." 
Groups will serve ethnic food and distribute education­al information on their cul­tures. After the fair, there will be a salsa dance. 
"That's going to be fun," Moscona said. 
Another diversity-related event is also in the works for the spring, although plans have not been finalized yet. 
When it comes to their sec­ond goal, Norton, Moscona and their staff have developed several initiatives that they believe will allow them to increase communication between their office and the student body. 
"We're trying to reach out to students," said Norton. She added that her office wants students to share their ideas for what student government

ND prof to advise Bush 
By JASON McFARLEY 
News Editor 

A Notre Dame professor wide­ly regarded as a top Latino the­ologian is taking his message from the classroom to the White House. 
Father Virgilio Elizondo, a vis­iting professor of theology and Latino studies will travel to \,Vashington today for a Tuesday meeting where he's expected to counsel President Bush on issues facing the U.S. Latino population. 
At the president's invitation. Elizondo will meet Bush and several Hispanic Catholic bish­ops Tuesday. according to Father Dan Groody, Elizondo's colleague in the University's theology department and Institute for Latino Studies. 
The meeting follows Bush's conference last week with Mexican President Vincente 
Fox. 
"He's been chosen as one of the leading Latino theologians to meet with the president and join these bishops to talk about certain issues that Hispanics deal with today," Groody said Sunday. 
In January, Time magazine recognized Elizondo as a spiri­tual innovator in its series "Time 100: The Next Wave." 
Elizondo earned the distinction for his attempts to unite the Mexican-American community in his native San Antonio. 
As recently as last spring, Elizondo commuted weekly between the University and San Antonio. 
Elizondo will be an important voice in Washington as well. Groody said. 
"It's not just an important event for him; it should be an important event for the University since he is represent­ing Notre Dame as well," Groody said.

Your excuse? 
I live in the Snowbird State. A place where old people and Buicks flourish, and a place where people cautiously drive five miles under the speed limit due to the camper they are towing. 
So, when I ventured out onto South Bend's Cleveland Road yesterday, I 
was shocked to see a Malibu weave through traf­fic and zoom by me. While I continued to drive, my brother, who was in the passenger seat added, "He wasn't wearing his seat­belt." 
We both looked at each 

other, and continued to

drive in silence. 
In high school, I lost two close friends in an automo­bile accident. There was no Copy Editor alcohol involved, just three students and three unused seatbelts. Two days before graduation, the senior class lost its class vice president and secretary. Their names remained in the program, yet their seats were vacant at graduation. Tearful families accepted the diplo­mas which their son and daughter had rightfully earned. Students, faculty and parents united for the funerals and celebrated their lives. But, even as people got into their cars following the ser­vices, many neglected to remember something as they drove away: their seatbelt. 
It seems like every year our campuses unite together to celebrate the lives of students who have passed away. In a place where life is respected and fought for, it amazes me that only half of students wear their seatbelts. I don't understand how people who have been motivat­ed to march against abortion or walk for cancer can risk their own life by not wearing their seat­belts. I have lost many people in my life to things that are beyond human control. People that have been taken away too soon for things which no one could have prevented. That's why I feel so passionately about this issue. 
One in three people will be involved in a seri­ous car accident during their lifetime. One in a hundred will be killed. Llfe is precious. Why take the chance? 
I always ask this question when I notice some­one has failed to buckle his or her belt. Their reasons are vast and the excuses are pitiful. Many claim to "just forget." How can you "just forget?" Since the first car ride home from the hospital as a newborn, your parents insured your child's safety by strapping you in. As a child, they enforced the rules and made you buckle up. All your life your parents have instilled values meant to protect and keep your safe. Why do you decide to break the habit and not wear your seatbelt now? Is this an attempt at rebellion? Or is it the thrill? Llke riding your bike without your hands? The thrill of finally being able to not do what your parents want you to do? Why are we, members of the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame community, as leaders setting this example? By many people we are emulated, and considered the best of the best. We are human, we are loved. But we must remember, we are not invincible. 
Whether it is a quick trip down 31 to pick up some food, a midnight Meijer run, or simply moving your car from the loading dock to D6, put your seatbelt on. If rebellion is your motive, dye your hair blue or sleep through a class. 
Stacy and John would have graduated from college this year. Remember friends lost, remember friends of the present, remember your family. Remember to wear your seat belt. Please. The world would not be the same with­out you.

JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY 

Death in study halts research 
The Johns Hopkins University Institutions made national news this summer following the death of Ellen Roche, a lab technician who was taking an experimental drug as part of a Hopkins-sponsored asthma study. The incident prompted the federal government to temporari­ly revoke funding for all studies with human partici­pants. Roche became sick after inhaling hexamethonium as part of a study geared towards understanding how healthy lungs protect against asthma attacks. The princi­pal investigator for the study was Dr. Alkis Togias, M.D. After receiving medical treatment from Hopkins, Roche died. The School of Medicine immediately initiated an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death, releasing a report. The report claimed that Roche's death was not directly attributable to hexam­ethonium, suggesting instead that the cause of death was "likely to remain uncertain." The report concluded that the study's protocol was "not in compliance with School of Medicine policies for requiring review of amendments to a research protocol." 
PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY 

Law schools see enrollment rise 
Many people nationwide have lost their jobs during the past few years because of a down-swinging, post dot-com economy. Fear of being laid off, fired or not being hired at all has prompted more graduating students to attend law school to specialize their degrees, thus increasing their chances of gaining employment, a recent Kaplan survey said. Pennsylvania State University's Dickinson School of Law is bracing for this surge...Registrations for the October LSAT (Law School Admission Test) are well ahead of last year's pace and my somewhat murky crystal ball suggests that we should end up with an increase somewhere between 11 and 17 percent," said Barbara Guillaume, director of admissions at Dickinson School of Law. "Students might be experiencing a reduction in opportunities presented to them after graduation when the market goes into a downturn." According to a survey by the Law School Admission Council, about 24,000 people took the LSAT in June, an 18.6 percent increase nationally from the previous year.

During the ini­tial trial period, according to Moscona, North Dining Hall will open for three hours starting at mid­night one Friday night a month. Opening North on a weekend night is intended to be an alternative to stu­dents living near North Quad from having to walk to Reeker's on South Quad. 
Continuing an event initiated by last year's student body president Brian O'Donoghue, the office of the presi­dent has also been planning the sec­ond annual Founder's Day on Oct. 11. The day's events will include a talent show and a special dinner in the din­ing halls, according to Jorissen. Displays around campus will also teach students about the history of Notre Dame, Norton added, to reflect the purpose of Founder's Day. 
"It's to celebrate what we're all about as a campus and what we stand for -our history, our faith," she said. 
The office of the president will also continue to study interaction between students and faculty. After conducting surveys and doing other research, the office will compile a report within this school year. Based on that report, the office will decide on how it can best encourage increased faculty and stu­dent interaction. 
Furthermore, in honor of the 30th anniversary of women being admitted to the University, Norton said her office would be planning an event for the spring. 
The social concerns division will also be looking into Notre Dame's recycling program. 
"There are opportunities to recycle, but its not easily accessible," Moscona said. 
In regards to LaFortune Student Center, Norton said her office would be seeking student feedback on possi­ble changes in how the building is used, and will also be working with Student Activities director Brian Coughlin and assistant director in charge of LaFortune Mary Edgington. 
"They seem very open to student desires for that to happen," Norton said. 
Ranking 
continued from page 1 
lion-topping Generations campaign ­the most successful fund-raising effort in American Catholic school history -the University was only 48th in financial resources. 
Notre Dame achieved an overall index score of 83 out of 100 possible points to earn the No. 19 ranking. 
Ivy League schools claimed the top three spots on the list, with Harvard and Yale Universities placing second and third, respectively. California Institute of Technology was fourth and Massachusetts Institute of Technology was fifth on the list. 
Emory University placed just ahead of Notre Dame at No. 18, while the University of California-Berkeley round­ed out the top 20. 
Because U.S. News bases the list on questionable criteria and because there are few shake-ups from year to year, the University has long given little credence to the rankings, Moore said. 
"I don't think that U.S. News or anyone else has come up with supportable methodology to say one school's No. 5 or another's No. 6," Moore said. 
Last month the rankings were the tar­get of at least two publications ­Washington Monthly and the New York Times -that suggested the annual list is based on schools' wealth, reputation and achievement of enrolled students. 
U.S. News recommends that its readers use the rankings as only one tool for selecting colleges, according to the mag­azine's official Web site. 
"We recognize that prospective stu­dents must consider their academic and professional goals, financial resources, scholastic record and special needs when choosing a school," the Web site states. 
Organizers of the college guide evalu­ate schools on 16 measures of merit, with academic reputation, student selec­tivity, faculty resources and graduation and retention rates given the most weight. 
Other factors used to rank schools include student SAT and ACT scores and faculty-student ratio.

MANAMA. Bahrain 
A fire aboard a tanker vessel smuggling Iraqi oil was reported to be dying out Sunday after crew members abandoned ship in ~he Persian Gulf and were rescued by the U.S. Navy. 
"The fire appears to be out and the tanker's condition looks stable now and does not appear to be in any danger of sinking," said U.S. Navy spokesman Jeff Alderson. He said there was no sign of leakage.

FORT LAUDERDALE 
A twin-engine plane was significantly overloaded when it crashed in the Bahamas last month, killing singer Aaliyah and eight others on board, according to a preliminary report. 
"The total weight of the luggage, fuel on board at the time of the accident. plus the weight of the pas­sengers showed that the total gross weight of the airplane was substantially exceeded." said the National Transportation Safety Board report, released Saturday. 

NTSB officials said they could not release figures on weight or other specifics on the crash. 
"It's a Bahamian acci­dent and we have to pub­lish what they approve us to publish," said Jorge Prellezo, southeast region­al director. 
Prellezo said he did not know when the final NTSB report would be released. 
Nine people were on board, but the Cessna 402B is certified to carry only six to eight people, including the pilot, Cessna Aircraft Co. spokeswoman Jessica Myers has said. 
Bahamian authorities have said the estimated weight of the plane. lug­gage and fuel was about 
5.495 pounds, not includ­ing the nine occupants. 
The maximum autho-: rized takeoff weight for the Cessna 402B is 6,300 pounds. 
No mechanical problems were found in the engines or airframe. but the plane's center of gravity was located toward the back of the plane, accord­ing to the report. 
The plane lifted off, then nosed down, crashing on the side of the runway, the report said. 
Bahamian officials, who are overseeing the investi­gation, are deciding whether to ask U.S. authorities to subpoena aircraft owner Gilbert Chacon to obtain the main­tenance records, the pilot's training records and to learn the details of how the charter was arranged. 
Chacon is the owner of Blackhawk International Airways, a charter airline. 
Neither Blackhawk nor Skystream, the plane's registered owner, had a permit to operate commer­cial charter flights in the Bahamas, said a Bahamian investigator. 
IRAQ 

Oil tanker fire begins to die out 
Honduran-flagged Khalid 1, had said the fire threatened to capsize or sink the vessel, which was in poor condi­tion. 
Alderson said the fire began in the crew's sleeping quarters on Saturday night but did not reach the ship's cargo -5,800 tons of Iraqi fuel oil. 
He could not explain how the fire died out. but said the Iraqi captain had reported it was caused by an electrical fault. 
A U.S. firefighting tug would con­tinue steaming toward the vessel, Alderson said. Iran had also dis­patched a firefighting vessel. 
The 343-footlong tanker was at the northern end of the Gulf, about 54 miles west of Iran and 76 miles from Kuwait, said Capt. Abdel Munem al-Janahi of the Marine Emergency Mutual Aid Center in Bahrain. 
Alderson said the Khalid was caught illegally smuggling Iraqi oil in violation of U.N. sanctions on Aug. 30th. 
The ship's Iraqi captain contacted the USS Nicholson, a U.S. destroyer. which sent out a small boat to pick up the crew of fifteen which included the captain.

Autocrat wins presidental election 
. Lukashenko sweeps Sunday's election under a cloud of suspicion 
Associated Press 
MINSK 

Alexander Lukashenko, an outspoken autocrat who is at odds with the West, claimed a sweeping win Sunday in presidential elections dogged by allegations of fraud. 
Lukashenko had 78.4 per­cent of the vote with 7 5 per­cent of the ballots counted, the Central Election Commission said early Monday. The commission said it would announce the winner later in the day. 
.. It was an elegant and beautiful victory," Lukashenko told a news con­ference. 
Opposition candidate Vladimir Goncharik had 12.5 percent of the vote and Sergei Gaidukevich had 2.2 percent, election commission chairwoman Lidia Yermoshina told a press con­ference. 
Victory would give Lukashenko another five­year term and a mandate to pursue his goal of a merger with Russia -and likely fur­ther isolate this stagnant for­mer Soviet republic at the heart of Eastern Europe. 
Opinion polls before the election had indicated Lukashenko would win by a large margin. 
Goncharik told The Associated Press he wouldn't recognize the results of the 


vote  and  accused  
Lukashenko  of  "seizing  
power."  

"This is clear falsification caused by replacing ballots during early balloting and at closed polling stations," he said. He vowed to lodge protests in Belarus and abroad. 
Goncharik supporters broke windows in a building across the square from the election commission's tempo­rary headquarters late Sunday, prompting their can­didate to emerge and urge calm among the crowd of about 100.

· The voting was peaceful, although an explosion blew up a bench outside the U.S. Embassy in the capital of Minsk on Sunday evening. 
No injuries were reported and it was unclear whether the explosion was linked to the election. 
Tensions soared in the nation of 10 million before the vote, with police raids on independent media and opposition campaign offices. In recent weeks, former 
security officials have accused Lukashenko's gov­ernment of sponsoring death squads to remove his critics. Lukashenko denies the accu­sations.

European observers had reported no serious irregu­larities in the balloting Sunday afternoon. 
But many have protested campaign practices and pres­sure on opposition groups. 
Election rules allowed for five days of early voting for citizens with a compelling reason to cast ballots ahead of time -a practice U.S. officials had said could lead to tampering. 
The Bush administration also has said Lukashenko stacked the electoral com­mission with people loyal to him and that he "regularly obstructs and impedes" the electoral process. 
The State Department said Sunday that it would not immediately comment on the election. 
Lukashenko's policies have unnerved many of Belarus' neighbors in Central and Eastern Europe, which are trying to shed their commu­nist pasts and strengthen their ties with the West. Critics dub him the last dic­tator in Europe. 
Neighboring Poland and Lithuania are seeking European Union member­ship, which will likely further isolate Belarus. And with Poland already in NATO and Lithuania heading there. Belarus is becoming a buffer state between the Western alliance and a Russia hostile to NATO expansion. 
The vote was Lukashenko's first electoral test since 1996, when he pushed through a referendum that extended his five-year term by two years in balloting most Western governments refused to acknowledge. 
The United States has stopped calling him "presi­dent" because he remained in office beyond the five-year term. 
Lukashenko remains popu­lar at home for his defiance of the West, and for his efforts to hold together the social safety net and stem the economic turmoil that accompanied the 1991 Soviet collapse.

De01ocrats blame Bush for slump 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

Democrats are stepping up efforts to blame President Bush for the faltering econo­my, even suggesting he resub­mit his budget to reflect the disappearing surplus. 
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle said Sunday that administration's actions are directly responsible for the current downturn. 
"Clearly, when you make the U-turn that the president did last spring, you can expect a U-turn in results," Daschle, D­
S. D., said on ABC's "This Week." "So clearly we're in a box, and I think the president now is recognizing that we're in a box, and we have to find a way out." 
White House officials have said the tightening economy just puts more pressure on Congress to spend prudently. Privately the administration is considering calling for across­the-board budget cuts next year if the economy worsens, Bush advisers said last week. 
Democrats blame Bush's 10­year, $1.35 trillion tax cut for the nation's economic woes and suggest Social Security reserves are in jeopardy. 
Projections by both the White House Office of Management and Budget and the nonparti­san Congressional Budget Office show that the non-Social Security part of the nation's budget surplus essentially has evaporated. 
Since Congress returned to work after Labor Day, Democrats and the administra­tion have been fighting over who is responsible for the eco­nomic rut. 
The nation's unemployment rate grew to 4.9 percent in August as job losses in manu­facturing passed 1 million for the yearlong slowdown. The increase in the monthly jobless rate was the biggest in six years. 
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said Bush needs to resubmit a budget that has "numbers in it that are real." He also said that there is little Democrats can do to boost the economy. 
"There is nothing that we Democrats can do by ourselves because we have only a one­vote margin in the Senate and he has a veto pen," Kerry said on CBS' "Face The Nation." He also said it was clear the Bush budget would mean spending money from the Social Security surplus. 
Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott rejected the notion that Bush is responsible and said the surplus will remain untouched. 
"Well. as a matter of fact. the downturn in the economy start­ed 13 or 14 months ago," Lott said on ABC. "The budget we're dealing with right now, where we see an effect by the declining surplus, actually is one we voted on last year." 
Lott said there would be no need to use money from the Social Security surplus to cover all of Congress' priorities. He suggested that cutting the tax on investments -called the capital gains tax -would increase tax revenue and help Congress deal with the shrinking budget sur­plus. 
Republicans believe many tax­payers would take advantage of the temporarily lower rate to sell investments, raising billions of dollars. 
"I am for the capital gains tax rate cut. which, by the way, would spur growth. and bring in additional revenue. certainly, in the short term, everybody agrees with that," Lott said. 
White House spokeswoman Jennifer Millerwise said Bush "will remain open-minded" about a capital gains tax cut. 
"He also believes the (income) tax cut and the fed reserve's rate cuts are the right remedy and will encourage the growth need­ed to bring the economy back," she said. 
Millerwise declined to go beyond those comments when asked about the remarks by Daschle and Kerry. 
FIJI 
President swears in new Prime Minister 
. Ceremony returns nation to democratic rule 
Associated Press 
SUVA 

A banker installed by the army as Fiji's caretaker prime minister following last year's nationalist coup was sworn in Monday as prime minister, returning the ethnically divid­ed nation to democratic rule. 
President Ratu Josefa Iloilo swore in Laisenia Qarase, an indigenous Fijian, in a brief 
ceremony before dignitaries and officials at Government House, a sprawling colonial mansion overlooking Suva lagoon. 
"May God be with you," Iloilo told the new prime min­ister. 
The party then walked out­side for a Methodist church service. 
"I feel privileged and hon­ored to be appointed prime minister." Qarase said. "Fiji should have a fairly stable government during the next five years and beyond." 
Qarase wrote to the presi­dent Sunday saying he had the support of a majority of legis­lators to form a new governing coalition, presidential secre­tary Jeremaia Waqanisau said. 
Qarase's indigenous Fijian­dominate d Cabinet was expected to be sworn in Wednesday, giving Fiji its first democratically elected admin­istration since gunmen stormed Parliament on May 
19. 2000, and toppled the Pacific nation's first ethnic Indian-led government. 
Qarase's appointment effec­tively gives the hardline nationalist coup plotters what they were demanding -a return of political power to

indigenous Fijians. 
The coup ousted Mahendra Chaudhry, the first prime min­ister from Fiji's 44-percent ethnic Indian minority. 
Many indigenous Fijians, who make up 51 percent of the country's 820,000 people, believe Indians, first brought to the country in the 19th cen­tury to work in sugar cane fields, wield too much political and economic clout. 
Qarase said he has the sup­port of a moderate block of four legislators and two inde­pendents, giving him the six seats he needs to combine with his Fijian United Party's 31 seats for a majority in the 71-seat Parliament. 
But a final agreement between the two sides had still to be signed and talks were continuing, moderates spokesman Kenneth Zinck said. 
Chaudhry's ethnic-Indian dominated Fiji Labor Party took 27 seats in recent elec­tions -10 fewer than its 1999 winning tally. But under Fijian law, any party winning more than eight seats must be offered Cabinet posts. 
Labor could complicate the government's formation by taking a number of Cabinet jobs, and Qarase urged the party to stay out of the gov­
ernment. 
"I have made no secret that I will be happy if he [Chaudhry] does not accept an invitation to join the government," he said. "It will be an unworkable government if he does. It will never work." 
The hardline nationalist Conservative Alliance took six seats but Qarase made it clear he preferred a deal with the moderates and independents rather than meeting the terms set by the hardliners. 
Their demands included amnesty and pardon for one of their elected legislators, coup leader George Speight. and his coconspirators. 
Speight was elected from his jail cell where he is awaiting trial with 12 key aides on trea­son charges stemming from the coup that carry the death sentence. 
Qarase's government was expected to face an early con­fide nee vote called by Chaudhry's Labor Party. 
Parliament is expected to sit for the first session of the new government next month, 17 months after masked gunmen led by Speight stormed into the debating chamber to take Chaudhry and his Cabinet hostage, holding them for 56 days.

CHILE 
U.S. involved in 1970 plot 
 CBS reports Kissinger blocked presidential candidate 
Associated Press 
SANTIAGO 

The United States and Henry Kissinger were more deeply involved than was previously thought in a 1970 plot to prevent a left-wing politician from becoming Chile's president, CBS televi­sion news reported Sunday. 
The program "60 Minutes" quotes an independent researcher as saying that the CIA sent a cable to its office in Chile instructing agents there to continue fomenting a military takeover. The cable came following a conversa­tion with Kissinger, who at the time was President Nixon's national security adviser and later became secretary of state. 
According to researcher Peter Kornbluh, the order also came a day after Kissinger has said he cut off any attempt to undermine Chile's democratic govern­ment. 
The plot did not prevent the Marxist Salvador Allende, who had won a September 1970 presidential election, from taking office the next month. But the right-wing plotters killed Chilean Gen. Rene Schneider. described as an opponent of the Chilean military's involvement in pol­itics. 
Three years later, Allende committed suicide while his 
palace was being bombed by the Chilean military. and Gen. Augusto Pinochet took over as the country's military dictator. 
Kissinger declined to appear on the "60 Minutes" program, CBS said. Kissinger's office late Sunday returned a message from The Associated Press but was unable to reach him immedi­ately for comment. 
However, the program aired Kissinger's testimony during a 1975 Senate investi­gation saying he ordered all contacts with the coup plot­ters to be cut off on Oct. 15, 1970. 
Kissinger's testimony indicat­ed the United States had stopped any such attempt before Schneider's slaying. 
Kornbluh also said newly revealed documents show that the U.S. intelligence comm unity believed a coup could not be carried out in Chile in 1970. 
Edward Korry, then the 
U.S. ambassador to Chile, said on "60 Minutes" that he also advised Kissinger that a coup would fail and boomerang against Nixon just as the failed Bay of Pigs inva­sion of Cuba had put the United States in a bad light a 
decade earlier.

which is referred to in the very first line. This cable was absolutely explicit: It is the continuing policy of the U.S. government to foment a coup in Chile." 
Kornbluh is a senior ana­lyst at the National Security Archive, an Jndependent research institute ·which works at getting secret U.S. documents declassified, according to CBS. 
The 1975 Senate investiga­tion had already determined Nixon had wanted to incite a military takeover, but 
said were min­
utes of an Oct. 7 meeting of a covert action committee in which Kissinger allegedly said that Korry's orders "should be rescinded forthwith." 
Also appearing in the pro­gram was retired Col. Paul Wimert. a former military attache in Chile who CBS said was assigned the task of pro­moting a coup in Chile to block Allende. 
Wimert told the program that he delivered weapons to the CIA to use in a plot to kidnap Schneider and send him to neighboring Argentina. "The move was supposed to incite a military takeover of the government and prevent Allende from taking office," he said.

U.S. army develops chemical resistant uniforms 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 

To help soldiers survive. the 
U.S. Army is developing a new generation of combat uniforms using tiny, doctored fibers that let air through while blocking toxins from chemical and bio­logical weapons. 
The "chemical protective overgarment," expected to ship in as little as two years, is one of the early uses of nan­otechnology: the science of manipulating single atoms and molecules to create new prod­ucts. 
While nanotechnology won't be ready to build tiny machines or computer proces­sors for at least 10 years, researchers in materials sci­ence are already using it to change the properties of plas­tics, oils and textiles, giving them breathability, heat-resis­tance, strength and flexibility. 
"They're such small fibers, it's not a trivial matter to get them into a uniform that's going to be twisted and sat on," said Tom Tassinari, a sci­
entist with  the  U.S.  Army  
Natick  Soldier  Center  in  
Natick, Mass.  

Ten years out, the Army hopes to distribute a "smart" combat uniform with nano­engineered fibers, embedded tives sold by Hybrid are tiny. The largest has a diameter of just 3 nanometers, or billionths of a meter. 
The nanoparticles are used in plastic that carries the qualities of an industrial ceramic: resis­tance to heat and cold, super­hard toughness and flame resis­tance. 
Joe Lichtenhan, president of Hybrid Plastics, said versions of Hybrid-enriched plastics are being tested by NASA on the exterior of the International Space Station, and by military and aerospace firms as a replacement for the metal bodies of ballistic missiles and satellite launch rockets. 
The nanoplastic missiles are cheaper and easier to manufac­ture than metal-jacketed ones and can protect the payload ­whether a warhead or satellite -from collisions with space junk while enduring the deep cold of space and the heat of re­entry, Llchtenhan said. 
Hybrid is also developing a nanolubricant for the Air Force that can handle temperatures of 500 degrees Fahrenheit -about 100 degrees higher than current oils -without burning or break­ing down, Llchtenhan said. 
Other chemical firms toiling in the nanorealm include DuPont, whose scientists are trying to create fibers that conduct elec­tricity and change their shape from round to square or triangu­lar. DuPont wants the fibers to be used in clothes that change color and size at a wearer's command, said DuPont spokes­woman Leslie Cormier. 
A small company outside Boston, Triton Systems. Inc., is selling a nanoengineered plastic pouch for use as a helium-filled heel cushion in Converse Helium sneakers sold in Japan and China. 
Trition uses an additive of clay nanoparticles to tighten the molecular structure of the pouch, allowing it to trap the helium underfoot for a minimum of 18 months, said Ross Haghighat. Triton's chairman and chief execu­tive. 
Triton is also developing a scratch-proof plastic coating for U.S. Navy helmet visors and jet windows, Haghighat said. The nanocoating might soon be used to scratch-proof regular eyeglasses, he said. 
Another material sciences firm, Nanophase Technologies Corp. of Romeoville, Ill., sells nano­engineered particles, such as zinc oxide, to manufacturers of products as diverse as industrial coatings and cos­metics. 
sensors and tiny computers that allow it to stop bullets, monitor vital signs and under­go chameleon-like camouflage changes that blend in to sur­roundings, Tassinari said. 
In the military and civilian worlds, a wave of new nanoprod ucts are emerging, though none as sexy as, say, the carbon nanotube mini­robots that may someday swim in our blood streams and repair damaged cells. 
Products include scratch­proof eye­glasses, heli­

I realized something last week when I was walking around campus, watch­ing students hustle to classes and catch up with each other after sum­mer break. 
My life sucks. 

Those of you who know me personal­ly or are long-time fans of my column (all three of you) will know that this is not an unusual statement for me to make. For years I've jokingly referred to myself as "God's toilet" because it seems sometimes like I have the worst luck in the world. Last year at about this time I wrote a column about how I had the "summer from hell" because my grandmother died and my friend had an abortion. This past summer was hardly better; I was involved in a car accident the day after commence­ment and my dog died. 
Then, of course, there's my ongoing struggle to find permanent employ­ment in a job market more volatile than my father's stomach after two bowls of chili. But it's more than that now. My life is just -boring. 
I miss the unmistakable buzz that charges the campus when everyone returns from summer. the first couple days of classes that let out after 30 minutes or so but you still recognize right away that the class will either be really great or excruciatingly bor­ing, chicken nugget day at the dining hall, learning the words to the Alma Mater and even more things I took for granted when I was here, thinking they were all part of humdrum stu­dent life. 

Now, of course, I'm no longer a stu­dent and I miss it terribly. Even the act of walking around campus felt hollow and strange, some other­dimension trek where all the experi­ences I had were right in front of me but unavailable, like going back to somewhere you once knew and find­ing it completely different than the way you remembered it. 
I miss picking up The Observer every day to find out about essential campus events. I would have liked to attend FlipStock, but I had no idea when the hell it was until it was too late. I could have begged Regis Philbin for money when he helped break ground on the performing arts center but I didn't hear about it until after he'd already gotten out of town. Yeah, I know, I could have looked at the online version of The Observer to get in the know, and I have a couple of times, but it's just not the same as seeing the white van with the Cubs and Bulls bumper stickers and grab­bing the first issue out of the stack. 
I figured the frivolity of Rally in the Alley might cure my boredom and malaise but I forgot one crucial fac­tor: I turned 21 in July, so the drink­ing was just not as fun. I didn't even have to make a hasty exit when the cops showed up. 
And I was hoping that being an alumnus would give me that special charm or savoir-faire that might impress people I chatted with, espe­cially the ladies. But it didn't really help, mostly because when I explained that I'd already graduated. it came with that load of melodrama about how much I miss Notre Dame and how I'm unemployed and a small fortune in debt. Three or four times the women I was hitting on walked away from me when I was in the mid­dle of my monologue. OK. so that really didn't happen. but it could have. 
Saturday night I was at a cousin's wedding reception, and the fact that a Notre Dame football game was going on was nagging me all night. It was the first time I hadn't watched a game in its entirety in about four years. Everyone questioned my visible anxi­ety and several times I had to correct myself because I said 'Tm a student" instead of "I'm an alumnus." I don't know how I'm going to feel at kickoff time against Michigan State. with seemingly everyone in the stadium except me. I hope I don't cry. I also hope I don't cry after the game, but that's a different story altogether. 
I'm getting e-mails from my friends that have moved on, enjoying them­selves and their careers in exciting places like Boston, Chicago and San Francisco and I'm almost embar­rassed to reply that yes, I'm still in South Bend and no. I don't have a job yet and yes, pity me. poor poor me. But I am vindicated by the realization that everyone else I know probably has the same bittersweet sensations about Our Lady's University. The only thing that makes me different from the rest of them is because I haven't yet found something to help me move on, like a job. Hopefully someone is reading this who can do something about that. 
That means you. Hegis.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Choosing academics over acclaim 
The first several weeks of class are always fit for self-laudation. This is the time. when students in all colleges feel the need to introduce themselves to their fellow students not by extending hands horizontally and sharing a moment of mutual recognition but by raising their hands vertically in class as if to say, "This is who I am." 
Except that these thousands of hands that rise simultaneously in lecture halls and conference rooms across campus do not represent an attempt to communicate with fellow colleagues. They are meant as bombastic displays of communicating one's own intellectual merit to the rest of the class. It's as if this particular student feels a need to prove to the rest of his or her colleagues that he or she deserves to be at Notre Dame. Or rather. that. "I am truly intellectually gifted (and I am trying to convince you here), despite the fact that I feel so miniscule in this ambience of inflated egotism.·· 
This is surely cause for remorse. For its quite a regrettable affair when students are content to represent themselves as brilliant cerebral machinations instead of kind, mindful human beings. And in the process they overlook the opportunity to develop friendships; instead they choose rivalry. But in the end, no one can doubt that they are a brain that is made of what Notre Dame brains should be made of. And if anything, they've protected their own sense of worth. 
I see this every day. Here are your perfect examples: recall the guy in your phi­losophy class who simply can't stop objecting to what the professor says because (even though he's never explored this particular topic in depth before) he really believes he can prove a scholar -who has dedicated decades of his life to this particular topic -wrong in his first attempt. Or the girl who adamantly insists that Descartes is an idiot because he entertained circular arguments. Let's not mention that. despite the fact that both students and faculty alike have a penchant for making jabs at Descartes. they know well they have not half the mind that he had. Or the brilliant chemistry T.A. who (sadly) takes refuge in Nieuwland Science Hall's dark corridors and waits for undergraduate students (a.k.a. quizzical looks) to ridicule. Or the young man who reduces feminist literature to the bitter diatribe of lonely single women. (No doubt, my comments will be attributed to some such bitterness.) 
Some of us are {gasp) here to learn. And while we do appreciate genuine inquiry as an enriching component of education. we do not extend our thanks to those of you who interrupt the learning process in order to make the classroom an arena for your flagrant egotism. There is a certain lack of authenticity in the act of dis­guising rhetoric as inquiry. And more often than not your fellow classmates pick up on it. And sometimes (with all due respect) it's a little bit irritating when a stu­dent disrespects another student's attempt to learn because they want to be sure everyone in the class knows that they're exceptionally bright. 
The truth is that very few of us (with the possible exception ofsome faculty members and those of you who believe the University is a place for self-laudation) doubt that any student at this school is very bright. And we don't need you to quiz the professors and their poor T.A.s on every single little detail -we trust that they're qualified. After all. they've dedicated a good portion of their lives to sub­ject-; we just barely graze. 
Be critical; don't misunderstand me. Critique is an exemplary way of advancing the learning process. But please. examine your motives before you raise your hand in class. ls your question or comment really meant as genuine inquiry? Or does it simply disguise an egotistical demeanor'? 
Some of us don't care to be your fans. Some of us go to great lengths to scrounge up to the money to attend this University-for the purpose of learning. We don't really believe that the cost of our tuition is worth a circus of academic pedantics. Please don't waste our time.

Questioning the Performing Arts Center's adequacy

ment when I saw that The Observer had finally opted to run an editorial regarding the inadequacy of the new performing arts center. I was thrilled that someone outside the music and theater departments finally noticed what a sad waste of resources this obviously undersized project is going to be -and moreover, cared enough to write an article about it. 
Then, of course, I read it. I immediately realized the error of / my haste. How silly of me to imagine that anyone on this cam­pus, even the editor­ial staff of The Observer, would be concerned about the Performing Arts Center as a performing arts facility. I believe the only comment regarding the center's adequacy

Hmmm ... it's unfortunate no one thought to ask someone in the department about what Notre Dame theatrical works actually require in terms of

space and facilities. 
That person might have learned that in many respects, FTT will have less space than it currently does, especially since there will be more non-~­departmental groups ·-·' making demands on the ~ theaters in the new build-\\_ ing. r--­
The mainstage theater will have significantly fewer seats than \\!ashington Hall, a cir­cumstance that can't help but adversely affect department ticket revenues. The smaller space also halts any attempts at new audience develop­ment. There is not enough office space to accommodate the current FTT facul­ty; a serious problem if the University plans to attract any new professors to the department. And as a costume shop employee, 1 am also painfully aware that we are gaining negligible · new shop space and no real new cos­tume storage space -even though our current facilities are ridiculously small and cramped; they're hardly adequate to support our current work; much less 
And the number of majors is grow­ing, by the way, despite the apparent efforts of the administration to quell 
any interest in it. The new building .-r--~ 
will obviously offer some advan­tages, especially in terms of 
technology, but to invest : such a large amount of , money in a facility that 
--~ will be obsolete as soan ~ as it is completed is very, very wrong on a very fundamental level. The problems 
that I've mentioned here only scratch the surface of the 
' facility's inadequa­cies -and I've hardly even men­
-tioned the prob­lems it causes for the music depart­
ment. 
The adminis­tration is send­ing a clear mes­
sage to FTT and music majors, all the other students on campus who participate in theatrical and musical groups, the current fac­ulty in both departments, as well as prospec­tive students and faculty members that 
the performing arts are not val­ued here. Need another exam­
ple? 
No one in the department was invited to the 
groundbreaking 
ceremony; many faculty didn't even know when it was to 
be held. It's clear to me that the "perform­ing arts" portion of the 

title for the building is there as a token only; the inhabitants of Main Building could obviously care less about fostering / artistic expression and scholarship among Notre Dame students. And The 
Observer editorial. a veritable foun­tain of indifference toward FTT's con­cerns, merely reinforces that senti­ment. 
I didn't start out intending to sound so angry, but I guess the frustration has been building for a while.

blend in oh-so-well with the natives. All you need to bring when you go abroad is a fat sense of humor. 
"Why?" you ask. Because everything that could go wrong eventually will. It's some sick version of Murphy's Law that takes over once you've crossed international waters. and when the airline has rerouted all of your luggage to Zimbabwe, the ATM machine has laughed at you as well as eaten your silly American debit card and your alleged landlord says, "Apartment? I no have apart­ment for you. But, I sell you watch?" you are faced with two 
You can curl up in the fetal position and lie in a gut­ter until some other American comes along and snaps a photo of you {"Look, honey, it's one of them gypsies that Ethel and Norm warned us about. Should we kick it?") or you can laugh long and hard about how you chose to put yourself in that situation. 
Being able to laugh at yourself is especially important when you have to deal with a language barrier. 
Example No. 1: the classic French mistake of thinking "excite" means excited. Nope. You end up telling the kid next to me on the plane that you're very "horny" about going to Paris, and then have to deal with his shifty eyes and repulsive attempts at pick-up lines for the next seven hours. Once you escape into the bath­room and consulted your handy dictionary, you have nothing to do but laugh. Laughing at yourself can ease the stress of new and difficult situations. 
Example No. 2: you don't realize picking your own fruit from produce stands is a huge no-no. and the gro­cer glares at you with pure hatred as you present him with your apple. You giggle nervously and throw the contents of your wallet at his feet in an effort to appease his wrath ... then you run. 
While a good sense of humor can often be to your advantage in trying to fit into another culture, you must also remember the cynical version of the adage your mother always told you: they're not laughing with you -they're really laughing at you. But don't let this deter you, because a smile. no matter how forced, is still the only thing that will keep you sane. 
Purely hypothetical example No. 3: while walking through a crowded street after enjoying a bit of the local wine, you turn to laugh at your friend's joke and walk smack into a street performer juggling fire, send­ing his hard-earned coins flying in all directions. Every local within five city blocks stops to point and guffaw. while you meekly scrounge for francs in the gutter and offer attempts at apology to the angry fire juggler whose life savings you've just scattered to the cobble­stones. 
Yet another example of a perfect time to laugh at your own mistakes ... and then run.

The timeless weight-gain offn 
By JACQUELINE BROWDER 
Scene Writer 

Sneak an extra brownie, order a midnight pizza or have one more beer to top off the night. And students wonder why they put on a few extra pounds when they go to college? This phe­nomenon, commonly known as the Freshman 15, refers to the weight-gain that many first­year students experience when they leave home. 
A recent study on the Freshman 15 at the University of Alabama (UA) at Tuscaloosa found that among 58 healthy freshmen, men stayed close to the same weight while women gained an average of four pounds when they go to college. 
"It is possible that some stu­dents just need to put on the weight as part of a maturing process," said Dr. Heli Hoy, an assistant professor of nutrition at the UA that led the study. "If that is so, then not gaining the 10 pounds would do the person a disservice. Some individuals may be 'late bloomers' in that they put on weight around hips and thighs at a little later than other girls." 
However, this maturation process is assisted by the typical college lifestyle. Odd sleeping patterns, late night snacking, alcohol and, the worst enemy of them all, an unlimited buffet in the dining hall can all con­tribute to weight gain. But if these are patterns that follow students through their college careers, why are freshmen the target of this phenomenon? 
A 1997 Duke University Medical Center study found that college freshmen often learn that studying more, exercising less and eating on the run means gaining a few extra pounds their first year away from home. Weight gain is fairly common for both men and w.omen going off to college, as fresh­men tend to start skip­ping meals when their schedules fill up and make exercising less of a priority. 

"So many students are so active in high school." said Kristina Pendley, assistant direc­tor of the Counseling Center at Saint Mary's. ..When they get to col­lege they begin to lead a more sedentary, less active lifestyle that can cause their body to change and adjust to this new lifestyle." 
Weight-gain can also be attributed to high levels of anxiety brought on by lifestyle changes and even stu­dents being homesick. 
"I think there is a small group of students that may respond in that manner," Hoy said. "People generally respond to stress in one of two ways: either they lose weight because they lose 

interest in food and

cannot eat, or they use food for comfort, they try toe, overeat, they overeat all the foods that they like and many times these are high fat. high sugar foods." 
College students are not alone in packing on the pounds. Studies conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Prevention and Control reveal that 17.9 percent of the popu­lation in 1998 was obese, which is defined as being more than 30 percent above ideal body weight. This marks a fair­ly substantial increase over the statistics from 1991 that indi­cated that only 12 percent of Americans were obese. 
However, the highest rise in obesity levels between 1991 and 1998 was found among the 18 to 29 year-old demographic, which increased from 7.1 per­cent to 12.1 percent. 
A 1998 Study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that this col­lege-age demographic begins that with the Freshman 15 is. perhaps, the beginning of a longer struggle with personal health. Being away from home for the first time and away from parental advice on

Gamecocks seal up crucial victory on the road 
Associated Press 
ATHENS, Ga. 

South Carolina might have set­tled for a field goal. Brian Scott wanted the Gamecocks to throw his way instead. 
So he 
matte  his  
case  to  
coach  Lou  

Holtz. "I can beat him. I can beat him," Scott pleaded. 
Beat him 


he did. Scott Holtz caught a 16­yard touchdown pass from Phil Petty with 1:22 remaining, rip­ping the ball away from Georgia cornerback Bruce Thornton to give No. 21 South Carolina a key 14-9 road victory over the Bulldogs (No. 24 ESPN/USA Today, No. 25 AP) on Saturday night. 
"I just reacted to it," Scott said. "Phil threw the ball and I had to go get it." 
Billy Bennett's third field goal, a 27-yarder with 3:17 remain­ing, pushed Georgia to its first lead of the game at 9-7. 
But the Gamecocks (2-0, 1-0 SEC) drove 66 yards in nine plays to earn the first prominent road victory of Holtz's three-year tenure. ' 
"This is a real big win," Scott said. "Coach stresses to us that all great teams have to win on the road. To have a great sea­son, we had to come in here and beat Georgia." 
The Bulldogs (1-1, 0-1) couldn't stop Petty on three straight third-and-10 plays. He threw to Ryan Brewer for 19 yards and freshman Matthew Thomas for another 32 to reach the Bulldogs 16. 
After two straight plays failed to gain and Georgia expecting the Gamecocks to settle for a field-goal try, Petty threw toward Scott at the goal line. 
The 6-foot-3 senior leaped shoulder-to-shoulder with the 5­11 Thornton, wrestling the ball away to turn a possible intercep­tion into the winning score. 
Oregon 24, Utah 10 
Joey Harrington is edging into the Oregon record books early in the season, but one of the most important numbers for the quar­terback Saturday was a big, fat zero. 
Joey Harrington did not throw a single interception in Oregon's (No. 8 ESPN/USA Today, No. 7 AP) 24-10 victory over Utah, and he ended up completing 17 of 27 passes for 220 yards and two touchdowns. 
The scoring passes, both to Keenan Howry, put Harrington in a tie with Dan Fouts for career touchdown passes at 37. But Harrington still has nine games to play for the Ducks, who are campaigning hard for a Heisman Trophy for him. 
The 6-foot-4 senior had criti­cized himself for throwing two interceptions last week in a 31­28 comeback victory in the sea­son opener against Wisconsin, a team that intercepted him three times to beat the Ducks last year. 
Against Utah, Harrington kept his air game under careful con­trol, hitting his targets precisely -including the 25-and 14-yard touchdown passes to Howry ­both in heavy defensive traffic. 
Florida 29, 

Alabama-Birmingham 7 
Florida State coach Bobby Bowden noted that quarterback Chris Rix had better luck in his second collegiate start than Chris Wfdnke did three years ago. 
Rix passed for a touchdown, somersaulted for another and set up three more scores as the Seminoles (No. 5 ESPN/USA Today, No. 6 AP) beat Alabama­Birmingham Saturday night. 
"It was not bad for a rookie quarterback," Bowden said. 
Weinke, who makes his debut Sunday as a starter with the Carolina Panthers, was inter­cepted six times in his second game. game as Florida State's quarter­"I like the fact that we won, back in 1998 when Florida State but I didn't like the fact that we was upset 24-7 at North Carolina didn't play very well," Snyder State. said after the Wildcats opened

Freshman wins campus title 

Special to The Observer 
Freshman Steve Colnitis got his collegiate golf career off to a strong start as he fired a final round 73 for a 72-hole total of 292 to capture the Notre Dame men's campus golf champi­onship by two strokes over sophomore Gavin Ferlic on Sunday afternoon at the Warren Golf Course. 
Colnitis and Ferlic went into the final round of play tied for first with 219 totals after the first 54 holes. Ferlic closed with 75 for his final round and a 294 total. 
Seniors Kevin Ricci and Chris Whitten had the two best rounds of the day with 71 and 72 respectively to finish tied for third with 72-hole totals of 295, three strokes behind Colnitis. 
"This is a great thrill for me to win this as a freshman and it really means a lot to me to start my college career this way," Colnitis said. ''I was really ner­vous over the last four holes when I realized that I had a chance to win it." 
Ricci had a strong weekend with rounds of 72 and 71 to move into third. A week ago he had rounds of 75 and 77 to open the tournament.

Colnitis struggled off the tee all afternoon, but made some great saves throughout the day to keep pace with Ferlic. 
"I made some good shots on six, seven and 12 where I was able to punch out of trouble and then made some long pars.," Colnitis explained. "After 12, I started to play bet­ter. I knew I had a good chance to win it on 17 when I went dri­ver-seven iron to within two feet. That gave me confidence going into 18."

NFL 
Knight's interceptions lead to Saints' victory 
Associated Press 
ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. 

Safety Sammy Knight matched a franchise record with three interceptions, two of which led to 10 points, jump-starting the Saints to a 24-6 victory over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday. 
Thanks to Knight, the Saints overcame a 6-0 first-half deficit by scoring 17 points in the first 12 minutes of the third quarter. 
Brooks bounced back from an abysmal first-half performance, completing 18 of 29 attempts and three touchdowns as the Saints won a season opener for only the 10th time in 35 years. 
The new-look Bills, on the other hand, still have plenty of work to do, losing in rookie head coach Gregg Williams' debut . 
While Buffalo's newly installed 4-3 defense held firm, quarter­back Rob Johnson looked unset­tled running the new West Coast offensive scheme. 
Johnson finished 16-for-27 for 160 yards and threw three inter­ceptions for the first time in his career. Johnson also failed to capitalize on two trips inside the Saints 15, settling instead for Jake Arians' two field goals. 
Raiders 27, Chiefs 24 
Quarterback Rich Gannon ral­lied Oakland for 10 points in the final 3:10, including Sebastian Janikowski's 31-yard field goal with 15 seconds to go in the Raiders' victory. 
Gannon overcame two fumbles and an interception that was returned for a touchdown to improve his record to 4-1 against the Chiefs since leaving Kansas City to join the Raiders. 
Gannon gave the Raiders a 24­17 lead with 3:10 left on a 15­yard touchdown pass to Jon Ritchie. 
Then, after Trent Green's 30­yard touchdown pass to Marvin Minnnis tied it at 24, Gannon's 31-yard pass to Tim Brown set up Janikowski's fourth field goal 
It was not a game the NFL will use to brag about replacement refs. Several times there was confusion, and a controversial reversal near the end of the first half might have cost the Raiders. 
Buccaneers 10, Cowboys 6 
Brad Johnson led a series of long, slow drives, yet produced only one late touchdown. forcing the Tampa Bay defense to hold on for a victory over Dallas. 
Johnson teased Tampa fans into thinking their offensive woes were gone by completing his first nine passes and driving the Bucs to a field goal on their opening series. 
Although Johnson remained steady, the offense failed to reach the end zone until he dove in from the 1 early in the fourth quarter. 
Tampa's defense, well rested thanks to Johnson's clock-eating possessions, harassed Dallas rookie quarterback Quincy Carter into plenty of first-timer's mistakes and limited Emmitt Smith's running room. 
But the Cowboys led 6-3 going into the fourth quarter and had two potential go-ahead drives in the final minutes. 
Dallas reached the Tampa Bay 30 the first time, only to go back­ward 11 yards. After forcing a Tampa Bay punt, Dallas took over again at the 39, but moved only one yard closer. On fourth down, Carter was intercepted by John Lynch at the 14 with 1:17 left.

Bonds has 18 games left to 
break McGwire's record of 70 
set in 1998. 
After an off-day Monday, Bonds and the San Francisco Giants begin a series at Houston's homer-friendly Enron Field. 
Bonds hit No. 61 in the first inning to match Maris' then­major league record 61 homers for the New York Yankees in 1961. Bonds broke the mark with No. 62 in the fifth. 
Bonds added a three-run homer in the 11th off Colorado· reliever Todd Belitz. 
Bonds also became the fastest to reach 62 homers, doing it in his 144th game. Mark McGwire needed 145 games to reach 62 when he broke Maris' record by hitting 70 homers in 1998. 


In the first, on a 1-1 count,· Bonds launched a 488-foot solo shot off Colorado's Scott Elarton. Bonds' soaring drive struck a beer sign beyond the center-field wall. 
It was the third-longest homer in Coors Field history, exceeded only by a 496-foot shot by Mike Piazza and a 493­footer by Larry Walker. 
In the fifth, Bonds lined a 2-2 pitch from Elarton that just cleared the right-field wall. 


Bonds struck out looking in the third. He had gone homer­less on Friday and Saturday.

the tournament. 
Junior .Molly Lee led the charge with a score of 85 that gave her a third place finish overall in the tournament. Joining Lee were freshmen Julia Adams and Stefanie Simmerman and sophomore Liz Hanlon. 
Adams low score of 87 gave her a seventh place finish, fol­lowed by Simmerman in eighth place with 88 and Hanlon in ninth place with a score of 89. 
Senior Mary Claire Hathoway scored 87, but was playing as an individual and not as a top five member of the team, so her score did not contribute to the team total. 
Adams and Simmerman already showed potential last weekend in the Ferris State Invitational, where Simmerman took 11th place overall in the 17-team field. 
Last year's MIAA MVP and a NCAA second-team All American. Lacey Wickman of Hope, finished in second place, only two points lower than Saint Mary's Lee. Although the Belles have been working all season on all aspects of their game, a· recent focus on the short game seems to have played a part in Saturday's victory. 
"We do work very hard on the short game and that will continue to be a goal of ours," Pekarek said. "[The short game] did help; our putting has improved a great deal." 
But the short game wasn't the end of what worked on Saturday. 
It was a game-long effort that focused each player on every shot that really put the Belles over the top. 
"I think where the team has improved greatly is that we're playing much smarter ball," Pekarek said. "When they get on the golf course they play much more strategically ... They're using very good course management." 
The Belles will have to put that course management to the test next week, as they tee off in another MIAA tourna­ment at Albion College Sept. 18.

Freshmen gain experience at Lake Michigan 
By KATIE McVOY 
Associate Sports Edi~or 
Experience is something that's hard to come by as a freshman, but this weekend experience is just what the freshmen Belles got. 
After being invited to a junior college tournament that could not be counted as part of the regular season, head coach Julie Schroeder-Bick decided that she would get her eight first-year players some much needed experience that would lead to game confidence. 
"I think confidence was gained," she said. "[The players] got on the court, they did well when they played ... I want them to carry that over to the varsity matches." 
Because all three games counted as scrimmages, the Belles' 1-2 record wasn't the focus at the end of the weekend. Finding out what the freshmen could and could not do was. 
"They had excellent communi­cation," Schroeder-Bick said. "They worked together as a group very well and I thought everyone contributed their tal­ents." 
The freshmen seemed to have good teamwork, but Schroeder­Biek will be looking to improve technical skills. 
"I saw little technique things, blocking technique is not crisp, footwork is not crisp -things that are correctable with hard work," she said. "There were some definite errors that occurred because of experience that will be corrected as they gain experience." 
That needed experience may come during Tuesday's match against Calvin. During last Wednesday's game, middle hit­ter Jolie LeBeau was injured and her status is still unknown. Schroeder-Biek used Friday night as a trial period for some possible substitutes should LeBeau be unable to play Tuesday.

MEN'S CROSS COUNTRY 
Mobley leads Irish· to win 
By KATIE HUGHES 
Sports Writer 
Dominating the field and defining the meaning of depth, the fifth-ranked Irish men won the Valparaiso Invitational Friday, sweeping the top three spots. 
Finishing with a team score of 21, Notre Dame had five runners in the top eight without the help of seniors Luke Watson, who took first at Valparaiso last year, and Ryan Shay, who took the week off to rest. 
Sophomore Todd Mobley won the meet with a time of 25: 17. 
"We more or less used this as a learning experience," Mobley said. "We're focusing on nation­als and not worrying too much about early meets." 
Head coach Joe Piane saw a promising field of runners in this meet. Now, the difficulty lies in choosing which seven men to run. 
"This meet indicates that I'm going to have some problems this season," said Piane. "With all these good [runners]. I can only run seven. We'll have five really solid guys and then seven more for two spots. But it's a good problem to have." 
This Irish focus this weekend was more experience than low running times. The upperclass­men were looking to get the first-year runners indoctrinated into college running. 
"We ran as a pack for the first three miles, and let the other teams take the pace," Mobley said. "We weren't that con­cerned with times. We were just trying to drag the freshmen along. A few freshmen struggled, which is typical for their first race. I know a few didn't run as well as they're capable of." 
Sophomore Brian Kerwin fin­ished second in 25:28 followed by senior Marc Striowski who finished third with a time of 
25:29. Sophomore Mario Bird was seventh running 25:41and freshman Ryan Johnson was eighth with a time of 25:43. Junior Nathan Shay took ninth in 25:50 and senior Tom Lennon was 10th, finishing in 26:24. 
Piane was very pleased with his team's performance. 
"Brian Kerwin struggled last year, but this year he's like a dif­ferent kid. This was Mario Bird's first race because he was injured last year," Piane said. "Ryan Johnson ran great." 
Valparaiso finished second at the meet with a team score of 
57. Wisconsin-Milwaukee fin­ished with 7 8. Wisconsin with 102, Evansville with 160, Wisconsin-Green Bay with 168, Indiana-Purdue Fort Wayne with 184, and Chicago State with 253.

Irish disappointed with second place 
By KATIE HUGHES Sports Writer 
Trapped by early and unex­pected speed from the rest of the field and by holding back too much, the Irish women struggled to a second place finish in Friday's Valparaiso Invitational. 
However, freshman Christi Arnerich finished second over­all and first for the Irish with a time of 23:03. 
"[t was pretty nerve wrack­ing," Arnerich said of her first college race. "I tried to go out with Muffy Schmidt, and then at the end I knew I had to go get some Western Michigan girls, so I did." 
Western Michigan won with a team score of 27, while 

G])O 
Audi 
Financial Services 
Notre Dame trailed with a 
score of 41. 
Head coach Tim Connelly was disappointed in his team, but took much of the fault upon himself. 
"To be honest, I don't think we ran well at all. We were out of it after 800 meters, and instead of being controlled, we were lacksidaisical," he said. "Part of that is my fault. I had said not to go out too hard, but I didn't mean to get out of it." 
"I don't think we were in the right mindset for a meet," Arnerich said. "We were thinking of it more as a big time trial." 
Intending to use Valparaiso to test the depth of the team, Notre Dame didn't run fresh­man Lauren King, junior Jen Handley, junior Jen Fibuch and sophomore Megan Johnson, who should be a eore of top performers as the sea­son progresses. 
"The next time we run, it will be a whole different type of team," Connelly said. "We've got some very good kids up front, but we need to continue to develop our depth. 
i 

But Christi [Arnerich] is a kid . 'I that's going to help us. Muffy I 
' 

[Schmidt] had a good race, and Emily Showman was hurt for the last two years, but she's going to help us this sea­son." 
Connelly plans to hold off on 

running freshman Lauren King, whose track season did not end until mid summer, until October. 
"I think the best thing we 

can do for her long term development is to hold her out and be patient," said Connelly. "I think as a team we have a lot of work to do, but to be honest, that's the attitude we need. When you win your first race. you're usually not as good as you think you are. But when you lose, you're usually not as bad as you think you are." 
Junior Muffy Schmidt fin­ished sixth with a time of 
23:05. Sophomore Emily Showman and senior Hilary Burn finished ninth and 10th, with times of 23:23 and 23:28. Sophomore Julie Schmidt was 14th with a time of 23:32, and sophomores Megan Peterson and Beth Androski finished 17th and 18th with times of 23:42 and 23:45. 
Also finishing Friday for the Irish were freshman Katie Wales, who finished 26th with a time of 24:16, junior Keri McCarthy, who finished 27th with a time of 24:22, junior Susan Creary, who finished 29th with a time of 24:33, freshman Kerry Meagher, who finished 38th with a time of 25:07, and sophomore Melissa Webb, who finished 50th with a time of 25:47. 
Valparaiso finished third with a team score of 83, fol­lowed by Wisconsin with 102. Evansville with 160, Wisconsin-Green Bay with 168, Indiana-Purdue Fort Wayne with 184 and Chicago State with 253.

''I've played midfield before so it wasn't that much differ­ent for me," she said. "With all the injuries, I had to play midfield out of necessity, but it did not change my approach to the game at all." 
Midfielder Mia Sarkesian and forward Kelly Tulisiak were credited with assists on Gonzales' first goal of the sea­son.

Freshman Candace Chapman stole the ball from a Wisconsin player and made a run up the right sideline cap­ping it off with a great pass to Warner.

the outstretched arms of Conway giving the Irish a 2 -1 lead. 
For the remaining 30 min­utes of the second half, the Irish continued to put pres­sure on the Wisconsin defense but they were unable to get any clean looks at the goal. 
The Badgers unable to mount any serious offensive attacks either, but they refused to give up against the Irish. The Badgers' persis­tence paid off when they were able to surprise the Irish defense on a counterattack. 
After a blocked Notre Dame corner kick, Wisconsin quick­ly moved the ball up field catching the Irish off guard. Irish midfielder Ashley Dryer was able to catch up to the streaking Wisconsin forwards but when she tried to clear the ball out of bounds, the ball landed at the feet of Wisconsin forward Kristin Betz. 
Betz dribbled the ball to the center of the field and found onrushing forward Kelly Kundert. Betz's pass went just beyond the outstretched leg of Gunnarsdottir allowing Kundert to get an open shot on net. Kundert made the most of her opportunity strik­ing the ball past Liz Wagner to tie the game at two with only five minutes remaining in regulation. 
Regulation ended with the score knotted at 2-2. Both teams were extremely fatigued in the overtime peri­ods. Most of the play took place in the midfield where neither team was able to take control of the ball and set up an offensive attack. 
The Irish's best chance to score came early in the first overtime when Warner made a run towards the Wisconsin goal. 
However, her shot was punched out of bounds by a great save from Conway. 
The game was plagued by numerous fouls called on both teams, interrupting game flow. 
"Certainly, there was physi­cal play out there, but the ref was not the reason why we didn't play well," said Warner. "We just have to come together as a team. We just didn't execute the simple Irish's record now stands at 3-0-1 on the season.

Irish falter in Nebraska 
By NOAH AMSTADTER Sports Editor 
LINCOLN. Neb. 
A team can only truly gauge its level of play by going up against the best. This is espe­cially true for the Notre Dame women's volleyball team -a team that perennially domi­nates its weak Big East confer­ence opponents yet hasn't advanced to the NCAA quarter­finals since 1997. 
This weekend at the US Bank/Arby's Tournament in Lincoln, Neb., head coach Debbie Brown's team (3-3) found that they have some work to do. The Irish dropped three matches in three days, all in three games. Notre Dame fell to No. 7-ranked UCLA on Friday (28-30, 23-30, 26-30), No. 1 Nebraska (29-31, 22-30, 20-30) on Saturday and No. 15 Pepperdine on Sunday {8-30, 27-30, 23-20). 
. Notre Dame tied Wisconsin 2-2 in double overtime 
By JOE LICANDRO Sports Writer 
From the opening minute of the game on Sunday, the Notre Dame women's soccer team knew they were in for a real struggle against the University of Wisconsin. After two fatigu­ing halves and a grueling dou­ble overtime, the Irish were able to salvage a 2-2 tie against the Badgers who refused to back down from third-ranked Irish. 
"We were missing four starters when we entered over­time," said Irish head· coach Randy Waldrum. "But that is no excuse for our lack of com­munication and mental focus. We had numerous opportuni­ties to put them away in the first and second half and we just didn't take advantage of our offensive breakaways." 
Things could not have been any worse for the Irish at the very beginning of the game. Only 30 seconds into the game, Wisconsin scored an easy goal 
on a miscommunication between Irish defender Gudrun Gunnarsdottir and goalie Liz Wagner. 
Gunnarsdottir tried to head the ball back to Wagner, but Wagner was unable to handle the high pass allowing Wisconsin forward Kelly Kundert to slip· past Wagner and shoot the ball into a wide open net giving Wisconsin a quick 1-0 lead. 
Although Wisconsin gained an early advantage, the Irish regained their composure and take possession of the ball for a majority of the first half, but they were could not· capitalize on their early offensive chances. 
Twice the Irish looked to score only to fall short. The first chance came when Irish forward Amy Warner received a pass from midfielder Monica Gonzales right in front of the net. Warner immediately returned the favor back to Gonzales only for Gonzales' shot to be blocked by a tremendous diving save from Wisconsin goalie Kelly Conway. 
A few minutes later, Notre Dame had another prime

THE 
Monday, September 10, 2001 BSERVER Nebraska 27, Notre Dame 10 

By ANDREW SOUKUP Associate Sports Editor 
LINCOLN, Neb. 
The Irish had hoped they were past the humiliating loss suffered last year at the Fiesta Bowl. 
But in front of the largest crowd in Memorial Stadium history and a national television audience, Notre Dame showed it still has light-years to go to climb back into the upper echelons of college football programs. Hampered by an ineffective offense and multiple turnovers, Notre Dame fell to Nebraska 27-10. The Irish dropped to No. 23 in the AP poll, while the Huskers remained at No. 4. 
"Obviously, we weren't a very well pre­pared football team. I take responsibility for that," Irish head coach Bob Davie said. 
Notre Dame had problems executing offensively all night long. Husker defense held the Irish to 162 yards of total offense and only three drives where Notre Dame gained over 25 yards. 
The offensive woes were particularly upsetting for Davie, who said before the season started that he hoped the offense would be more dynamic and more consis­tent. 
'Tm disappointed right now in our offense," Davie said in obvious disgust. "Too many penalties, too many self­inflicted mistakes. Once again, we had 
Early mistakes and ineffective offense lead to Irish embarrassment 
that deer in the headlights look. We got a little bit better in the second half, but still not enough to win at this level of football." 
Davie also has a quarterback controver­sy on his hands. Although sophomore quarterback Matt Lovecchio played 12 of Notre Dame's 15 series, Carlyle Holiday led the Irish on their longest drive, a 64­yard campaign that ended in Nick Setta's 29-yard field goal. But in his collegiate debut, Holiday generally looked tentative in the pocket and threw an interception in the third quarter -a pass that so upset Davie that he pulled Holiday for the rest of the game. 
"I really don't care about [who plays]" said LoVecchio, who finished 11-for-24 passing with just 78 yards. "Whoever can move the team down the field should be in the game." 
But it was turnovers, not the play of the quarterbacks, that put the Irish in an early hole. The Irish -who only commit­ted eight turnovers last year, tying an NCAA record -turned the ball over four times, including interceptions by Lovecchio and Holiday, a Terrance Howard fumble on Notre Dame's first offensive play and a botched snap on a punt. In all, Nebraska scored 10 points off Irish mistakes. 
"The first play of the game, the first play of the 2001 football season, we put the football on the ground. Are you kid­ding me? Are you kidding me?" Davie said. "A team that turned the ball over eight times all last year, the first play of the 2001 season. we're going to put the ball on the ground? That's my fault. We didn't do a good enough job." 
"Whatever happened out there, we need to fix it quick," Lovecchio said. "We need to put points on the board ... throw­ing an interception, fumbling the football, it all led to momentum swings." 
It wasn't all negative for the Irish. Shane Walton blocked a punt at the end of the third quarter, setting up Tony Fisher's 1-yard touchdown run and the Notre Dame defense held Nebraska scoreless in the second half. 
"The defense in the first half made some mental mistakes and bad deci­sions," Irish defensive end Ryan Roberts said. "In the second half, we just made the adjustments, played better, and shut them out. All we did in the second half was play to our ability and eliminate the mistakes." 
But the Irish defense was, according to Davie, "back on our heels" early. On the opening drive, the Huskers took the ball 64 yards in nine plays. culminating in Dahrran Diedrick's two-yard touchdown run. And on the first play after Howard's fumble, Nebraska quarterback Eric Crouch hit Josh Gibson for a 22-yard touchdown pass to put the Huskers up 14-0 less than five minutes into the game. 
"I think that the way we got down there so quickly on the first drive really set the tone for the entire game," said Diedrick, who added a three-yard touchdown run in the secQnd quarter and finished with 133 yards rushing on 32 carries. 
"We dominated in the first half," added Crouch. "We were really excited to get out there and to show the country that we have a great offense." 
"When you take the field, the first snap, you have to play," Irish defensive coordi­nator Greg Mattison said. "You can't give a team a half to get a lead on you and then say, 'OK, we're going to play now'." 
Husker tight end Tracy Wistrom also gave Notre Dame problems. Several times during the game, Notre Dame dropped back into zone coverage, leaving Wistrom wide open in the middle of the field. He led all receivers with four catches for 71 yards.

INSIGHT 


LINCOLN, Neb. 
Irish fans are disgusted. 
From students in South Bend to alumni in New York and everywhere in between, the disgust for the way the Irish played 
Saturday night in Lincoln is echo­ing across the Internet, the din­ing hall and the dorm rooms. The Notre Dame faithful are pretty much fed up with 


the football 

Mike Connolly
team's failure in big games. 

But you know who is even more Outside disgusted? Looking In 
Bob Davie. 

Davie walked into the post-game interview on Saturday night and pulled no punch­es. He took complete responsibility for the every Irish failure and gave credit for every success to the players and the players alone. 
"Obviously we weren't a very well­prepared football team and I take responsibility for that," he said. "I don't care how many games you've played. I don't care how many people are in the stands. I don't care about the crowd noise. There was no excuse. And I take responsibility." 
Davie has taken responsibility for losses in the past but they have always come with a footnote: There isn't a lot of talent on this team. We're a young team. We don't have enough speed. We have too many injuries. We have an inexperience quarterback. 
Saturday night there were no excuses. 
Davie knows where this team should be and how this team should playing and he takes complete responsibility for the 27 -10 loss on Saturday night. 
"We had a deer in the headlights look and I am really disappointed because I thought we were past that as a team," he said. "First play of the game. First play of the 2001 season, we put the ball on the ground." 
Just like thousands of Notre Dame fans across the country, he had the same reaction to Terrance Howard's fumble on Notre Dame's first offen­sive drive. 
"Are you kidding me? Are you kid­ding me?" he asked, exasperated in the press conference. "A team that turned the ball over eight times all of last year and we're going to put the football on the ground on the first play of the game?" 
Davie's comments left the writers who have covered his term as head coach in shock. Never before had Davie been so forthright in assigning blame to himself. Maybe it's because this is the year he has to produce. This is the year where there can be no more excuses. This is Davie's team. Every player on this-team has played his entire college career for Davie. 
If this team isn't fast enough, it's because Davie didn't recruit enough speed. 
If this team isn't tough enough, it's because Davie didn't recruit enough attitude. 
If this team doesn't win, it's because Davie didn't lead them to vic­tory. 
But this team is fast enough. It is tough enough and it should be win-. ning. 
And the players know it and they aren't blaming Davie. They are blam­ing themselves. 
"I think Coach Davie is taking responsibility because it was the first game," senior tailback Tony Fisher said. "But it wasn't Coach Davie's fault. We went out there and didn't execute. They put us in the position to make plays and we didn't make plays." 
There are hundreds of football "geniuses" on the Internet filling chat board after chat board with mindless dribble about how bad the offense is or how weak the defense looked in the first half. 
But their anger is nothing com­pared to how the players feel. 
"Offensively we had a lot of trouble executing. Defensively we put our­selves in some bad positions," defen­sive end Ryan Roberts said with dis­gust dripping from his words. 
Every player interviewed Saturday night put the blame on the players as surely as Davie put the blame on him­self. 
"We had a lot of assignment errors," cornerback Shane Walton said. "Coach Davie had us prepared and they didn't do anything we didn't expect. Coach had us prepared. We should have taken that game." 
The only time Davie didn't accept responsibility for a part of that game was when a player made a good play. Davie gave all the credit for the punt block to \,Valton. 
"I thought he did a great job of knowing their scheme," Davie said. "We didn't make the call. He made the call. He deserves credit for that one. No coach deserves credit for that. He made the call." 
So where do Bob Davie and his troops go from here? 
There were some positives in this game. The defense stiffened and shut out Nebraska in the second half. The offense cut out the turnovers and moved the ball a little bit in the sec­ond half. . 
This team showed signs of life and promise in the second half. 
'The fact that this football team didn't quit and we blocked a punt in the second half shows there is some heart on this football team," Davie said. "We know there is enough heart on this football team. We've got a great bunch of kids that want to win. We've just got to coach them." 
Although Davie has never lost a season opener before, his career at Notre Dame has been marked by slow starts and strong turnarounds. He's righted a sinking ship before. He can do it again this year. 
"We are not going to leave our sea­son out here in Lincoln. Neb." he said. "We are going to get this thing right." 
And unlike those disgusted football experts on the Internet, Davie can actually turn his disgust into action and get something accomplished.

LoVecchio, Holiday start quarterback controversy 

By NOAH AMSTADTER 
Sports Editor 
LINCOLN. Neb. 

\Vith 11 :4:2 left in the second 
quarter Saturday, Carlyle 
Holiday took his first snap 
behind center for the Irish. And 
the latest Irish quarterback 
controversy officially began. 
Holiday, who relieved starter 
Matt Lovecchio after the Irish 
failed to score on five first­
quarter drives, arrived to a 
chorus of boos. In the only act 
of disrespect by an especially 
polite sea of red Nebraska fans. 
Holiday -who chose the Irish 
over the Cornhuskers on sign­
ing day in the spring of 2000 ­
was greeted with jeers. 
"I got booed. It sort of hyped 
me up a little bit," Holiday said 
That first drive ended with a 
Nick Setta field goal, Notre 
Dame's first points of the game. 
But Holiday's day was far 
from perfect. With less than 
two minutes remaining in the 
third quarter, Holiday dropped 
back on first and 10 and threw a pass deep down the middle of the field -right into the wait­ing hands of Nebraska safety Willie Amos. 
"I really didn't see the safety 
drop," Holiday said. "When I 
threw it, it was a big moment 
in the game. I think that drive 
was six minutes long and it 
took a lot of momentum out of 
us." 
That play put the sophomore 
on the bench for the remainder 
of the game and drew a mixed 
performance review from Irish 
head coach Bob Davie. 
"I thought Carlyle Holiday 
came in and did some good 
things but it was inexcusable 
that interception he threw," 
Davie said. "First and 10 with 
the safeties deep and he throws 
the ball down the middle. But 
he is a young guy who hasn't 
played a lot and he will get bet­
ter." 
But Holiday's final stat sheet was no worse than classmate LoVecchio's. Holiday completed five of eight pass attempts for 41 yards and was Notre Dame's second-leading rusher with 21 yards on the ground, including one rush for 17 
yards. Davie blamed the rest of 
Notre Dame's offense for the 
team's failure to score more 
than 10 points. 
"Carlyle came in and made 
some plays but I am not down 
on Matt Lovecchio. I don't 
know how things would have 
changed had we executed bet­
ter," Davie said. 
Lovecchio and the rest of the 
offense seemed stuck in the 
same malaise that affected the 
Irish during last winter's Fiesta 
Bowl. Lovecchio completed 11 
of only 24 pass attempts, 
throwing an interception of his 
own late in the first quarter. 
"From the get go, I think my interception turned the ball over," Lovecchio said. "That's just a momentum thing that really doesn't go in our favor. One thing leads to another and we're down and we're not mov­ing the ball anymore." 
Davie anticipates Lovecchio starting Saturday when the Irish take on Purdue in West Lafayette. But the Irish coach maintains that the offense as a whole must perform better. 
"If I were to make a guess right now I would say Lovecchio would be the starter but we have a lot of things we still need to address," Davie said. 
As for the controversy over which sophomore will take snaps under center for the one of the nation's highest-profile teams. neither Holiday nor Lovecchio seem to care about anything other than the final score. 
"[As far as a quarterback controversy or anything like that] I don't really care," LoVecchio said. "If the quarter­back is in there -whether it's me, Jared [Clark] or Carlyle ­whoever's going to help this team move the ball down the field and score should be in." 
Holiday for one is more than comfortable with his role on the depth chart. 
"Matt's a solid starter," Holiday said. "We've just got to continue to keep pushing him." 
Other members of the offense deflect blame for the ineffective Irish offense away from Holiday and Clark. Arnaz Battle, last year's starting 
... 
-

there will be any negative effects for good friends Holiday or Lovecchio, whatever hap­pens. Lovecchio gave Holiday pointers while the backup was in the game. 
"He just came and gave me pointers on speaking loud and executing the offense," Holiday said.
