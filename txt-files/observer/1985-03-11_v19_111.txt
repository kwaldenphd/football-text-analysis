Controlling student govern­ment finances is "very much like running a little business," said Student Body Treasurer AI Novas. 
Although the goal of a student­run, student-financed "business" is not purely profit, Novas stress­ed his department's responsibility to be financially accountable. 
The $35 activities fee paid by students generates $246,000, which is used to finance various student projects. Clubs and organizations receive 20 percent of that figure, while the remain­ing amount is divided by the Stu­dent Senate Budget Committee. 
This committee consists of the student body president or vice president, student activities board 

manager, two senate members and the director of student ac­tivities, who is a non-voting member. The student body treasurer chairs the committee. 
The Budget Committee divides this 80 percent of the student fees collected among the Student Ac­tivities Board, Student Govern­ment, Hall Presidents' Council, Judicial Council, Off-Campus Council and a contingency fund. 
The SAB receives the largest amount, approximately, $111,000. This money funds 19 organizations and projects, in­cluding student businesses. Each project's budget represents the loss that it is "allowed" to lose, 
because  most  have  sources  of  
revenue  besides ­ incurred  ex­ 
penses.  

For example , last year Campus Entertainment's budget was $19,700. At the end of the year, the commission had incurred $14,580 in expenses and generated $2,879 in revenue. Although it suffered an operating deficit of $12,030, the budget allowed $19,700 to be lost.

In Brief Sexuality survey a positive step 
Sen. William Proxmire accused the Federal Aviation Administration yesterday of letting $48 million get away by ''turn­ing a blind eye" to the value of federal land around Florida air­ports. Proxmire said 9,300 acres at 23 airports in Florida "are sit­ting idle, home to mosquitos and sawgrass. This land would cause real estate brokers to do cartwheels. It has an estimated rental value of about $32 million a year... How much is the taxpayer receiving? a big fat zero." Proxmire said another airport leased 374 acres to a "famous speedway" for $1,100 an acre for 99 years, far below the going rate of $8,000 an acre. -AP 
The first shipment of famine aid raised from sales of the British pop record "Don't They Know It's Christmas" arrived in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia yesterday. The record featured some of Britain's biggest rock names playing as a group and raised about $8 million for Ethiopia's estimated 9 million famine victims. The first shipment, worth an estimated $75,000, included 20 tons of powdered milk, 10 tons of high-protein biscuits and 2.5 tons of medical supplies. The aid is to be donated to charities helping famine victims in Ethiopia, said Midge Ure of the Ultravox pop group, who accompanied the shipment. "There'll be a lot more on the way."-AP 
Two-thirds of those surveyed in a Newsweek poll supported a ban on magazines, movies and videocassettes that feature sexual violence, the magazine said. But a majority still favored the availability of sexually explicit material, according to the magazine's March 18 issue. According to the nationwide telephone poll of 1,202 adults, conducted on March 6 and 7 by the Gallup Organization, roughly three-quarters of those surveyed said sex­ually explicit material denigrates women and leads some people to sexual violence. Newsweek said the poll, which had a 4 percent margin of error, showed that a majority of Americans are offered to some degree by the sexual content of today's top television shows, advertising and movies. But Newsweek said the poll makes clear the acceptance of pornography in American life: clear ma­jorities favored the continued sale of X-rated movies and sexually explicit magazines, although some were willing to limit public display. -A P 
Sen. Jake Garn will take a paper airplane to play with on his long-delayed space shuttle flight, officials said. Garn, 52, will use the toy for a file demonstrating the fundamentals of science to schoolchildren, said Carolyn Sumners, director of astronomy and physics at Houston's Museum of Natural Science and coordinator of the project. The six other astronauts aboard Discovery will play with jacks, a yo-yo, marbles, a mechanical car and a pink plastic mouse named "Rat Stuff." Gam's trip into space has been postponed five times.

The 33-year-old auto mechanic who was kept alive for II hours with an unapproved mechanical heart will be buried in Tuc­son after a service attended by his family and friends, University of Arizona officials said Saturday. The polyurethane heart, designed by Dr. Kevin Cheng, a dental surgeon, kept Thomas Creighton alive for II hours Wednesday after a first human heart transplant failed and a second donor heart could not be found. The mechanical heart was replaced early Thursday when a human heart became available. Shortly after Creighton died, Dr. Jack Copeland, head of the heart transplant team, attributed the death to an accumulation of tluid in Creighton's lungs, which placed in­creased pressure on the transplanted human heart. Copeland said use of the Phoenix Heart did not contribute to Creighton's death. ­

Human sexuality seems to be a taboo topic on the 
Saint Mary's campus. There isn't a lot of talk about 
sexual issues, and people seem to be either embarrass­
ed or unknowledgeable about many of the issues con­
cerned. 
But conversations concerning sexual issues were 
stirred up last week when Saint Mary's Campus 
Ministry distributed a sexuality survey to every stu­
dent living on campus. 
· The survey is extremely thorough, covering almost 
every sexual topic. Because so many subjects are 
covered, those taking the survey may question the 
necessity of some questions. 
The diversity of questions, however, can be easily 
justified. 
Survey results will be used to tailor programs to fit 
the specific needs of Saint Mary's students. a less 
thorough survey might not offer a true picture of stu­
dent attitudes. 
The survey is a one-shot opportunity. Had it refus­
ed to present all possible topics, many important sub­
jects might never have surfaced. 
The survey is divided into eight parts. the first sec­
tion involves questions about the male and female 
bodies and their reproductive organs, while the second 
part deals with self-image and self-worth. 
Decision making capabilities are questioned in the 
third section, and the fourth deals with attitudes and 
relationships. 
The fifth section asks questions concerning pregnancy, such as who is responsible for birth con­trol, and what to do in case of pregnancy. 
The sixth part is mainly concerned with a person's opinion of homosexuality and sexual harrassment. 
The seventh section asks three straightforward questions: what a person's sexual preference is, whether or not a person is sexually active, and whether or not the person is using birth control. 
The eighth and final section asks if a person would be willing to attend educational programs should such programs be instituted. Space is available at the end of the questionaire for comments or suggestions. 
Although the survey addresses many personal issues, it is vitally important that those completing the survey take it seriously. Once the results are compiled, educational programs can be instituted and students should take advantage of these programs. 
The Saint Mary's community is very protected. Because education involves growing and maturing in many ways, it it important that students become more knowledgeable on their own sexuality. Sexual issues are not inherently immoral, and students should not be afraid to confront these issues. 
Campus Ministry has made an atterr.pt to bring sex­ual questions into the open. This is a positive step because it is time for Saint Mary's to recognize that sexuality is part of life. 
For too long, students have been led to believe that information on sexuality should not be mentioned. 

Margie Kersten 
Assistant Saint Mary's Editor 
Someone who openly discussed sexual issues might have been considered immoral or looked upon negatively. Saint Mary's is an educational institution and as such should not limit its education by excluding information on sexual issues. 
At most state universities, sexual information is readily available. There are programs available for a number of sexual topics, including rape, sexual har­rassment, birth control, pregnancy and homosexuali­ty. There is no reason why Saint Mary's should be di f­

ferent from other colleges and universities. The results of the sexuality survey will allow Saint Mary's to identify what information students seek. Campus Ministry has exemplified, through the survey, a sincere concern for the issue of sexuality. 
Campus Ministry and all those who worked to develop the survey are to be commended. It is hoped that new educational programs will be developed, and that through these programs students will become less intimidated and more open, honest and knowledgeable about their own sexuality.

A lone suicide attacker drove his bomb-laden car into an Israeli army truck in south Lebanon yesterday, killing nine Israeli soldiers, military sources said in Tel Aviv.

to the survey_ The results will be taken seriously," she said_ 
Hale was mainly involved with the content and format of the ques­tions. She has done work with surveys before and gave a statistical view of dealing with the con­struction of the survey. Burke, who is an R.A. in Holy Cross Hall, said that she got involv­ed with the survey through meetings with R.A.s and student government. Burke was involved with the content of the questions and the cover letter that accom­panied the survey_ 
"Issues of sexuality are not often addressed here at Saint Mary's, and Saint Mary's being an institution of education for whole being, needed to address the issue because sexuali­ty is a part of each person," she said. 
So many areas were covered because sexuality is a broad topic, according to Burke. 
"If we would have left out some of these areas it would have been negligent on our part," she said. 
She stressed the confidentiality of the survey and noted that no percentages will be published. Burke said, "We will use these numbers to know what educational programs to start." 
Feeley said the Board of Regents and Student Affairs Committee met and examined the are of educa­tion for sexuality. Parents, faculty, students, and staff discussed the need for a program and a sexuality survey seemed to be the best way to determine what the student needs were. 
The ultimate goal of the survey is to determine what the needs of the students are, design a program in coreelation with the students' needs, and share the information with students before the 1985 school year_

that the car bomb was driven by a member of the Lebanese National Resistance in revenge for a car bomb that killed 7S people and injured 2SO on Friday near a West Beirut mosque. The caller said there would be a longer statement later. 
Israel has denied accusations in l.ebanon that it was reponsible for that bombing. 
Manager Aina Belsky of Metulla's Arazim Hotel, about 300 yards from yesterday's blast site, reported in a telephone interview, "The explo­sion was terrifying. There was a giant lire and then black smoke shot up." 
It was the worst attack on Israel's occupation force since Nov. 4, 19H3, when 2H Israeli servicemen and 3S Lebanese and Palestinians were killed by another suicide bomber. In that attack, a bomb-laden truck was driven into a compound where Is­raelis detained and questioned prisoners. 
Prime Minister Shimon Peres was quoted as telling a Jerusalem meetingofwomen from B'nai B'rith: "We had a very bad day today. Nine of our soldiers were killed." His remarks were relayed by a partici­pant who spoke on condition she was not identilled. 
The military sources, who also in­sisted on anonymity, had initially said as many as I 0 died in the attack. At the same site, two Israeli soldiers were killed in land mine explosions on Feb. 10. 
The Lebanese state-run radio quoted police and other sources as saying that a Mt:rcedes car with a lone occupant drove into the Israeli convoy on the Tal el-Enhass road in 
the Marjayoun Valley about I00 
yards from the border gate. 
It said tht· car hit a truck full of Is­
raeli soldiers, and the explosion set 
!Ire to a number of Israeli vehicles. 
Machine-gun lire could he heard as surviving Israelis reacted to the at­tack. Helicopters quickly removed the casualties, area residents told state radio. 
The Israelis then sealed off the area. 
Before yesterday's attack, the Is­raeli death toll in Lebanon since the June 19H2 invasion stood at 620.

After their flight, a "lift" ofIrish Rangers rush out ofan UH-1 Iriquois helicopter.

On March 2, while most students were busily sleeping in, catching up on a week's lost sleep, the Notre Dame Army ROTC Irish Ranger Company, the crack volunteer ROTC outfit, was flying about the Michiana region in U.S. Army helicopters on an exciting field training exercise. 
The UH-1 Iriquois helicopters were part ofan air assault field training exercise which involved the Irish Ranger Company and the 38th Aviation Battalion, Indiana Army National Gvard. The helicopter battalion is a reserve unit based in Shelbyville, Indiana. 
 

The exercise was conducted in two phases; the first, the helicopter ride, familiarized cadets with flying in them; in the second, the Rangers conducted small-unit wargames in Juday Creek. 
The Irish Rangers reported in at 7:30a.m. at the ROTC building, and their cadet officers briefed them on entering and exiting the helicopters. Also, the Army ROTC detachment issued equipment, including field packs, radios, and M 16 rifles with blank ammunition, to the cadets. 
The company then was organized into lifts, or 
groups which were to ride in the same helicopter. 
Each lift had a leader who was responsible for provid­
ing the pilot with a list of names and social security 
numbers of the cadets flying in his lift. 
At I 0 a.m.. the cadets marched to Green Field. 
Before the cadets boarded the helicopters, the pilots 
gave a safety briefing and an orientation to National 
Guard Aviation. After this was done, the first ofthe 
three helicopters took off, and nine lifts, totalling over 
50 Rangers and about 25 other cadets, took off, flew 
around the Mishawaka area, and landed in Green Field. 
After the helicopter ride, the Rangers went toJuday 
Creek, a wooded area northeast ofcampus, to conduct 
field training exercises and wargames. The wargame 
ended at 2:30p.m., and the Rangers marched back to 
the ROTC building. 

This wargame was in preparation for the Army 
ROTC Roger's Rangers competition at Camp Custer, 
Mich., where the Irish Rangers will compete against 
units from Indiana, Illinois and Michigan. The competi­
tion consists of three events; small-unit patrolling, 
testing on such military skills as first aid and communi­
cations, and a five-mile squad run with full field pack. 
The Irish Ranger Company is a volunteer subunit of the Army ROTC cadet battalion which concentrates on field training and readiness. Also, the unit attempts to instill confidence and motivation in its members. The commander ofthe Irish Rangers, cadet captain Eric Fredrickson, says of the purpose ofthe Rangers, "What I'm doing is trying to prepare my people to become future officers in the United States Army." 
The company is run in the spirit of the active Army Rangers, a highly trained, highly-mobile unit ofthe U. 
S. Army. Army Rangers participated in the invasion of Grenada, and are in turn modeled after Roger's Rangers, a unit which fought in the French and Indian War. Many members ofthe Irish Ranger Company have had either Airborne or Air Assault training.

Yuppies-you can't stand 'em, you can't shoot 'em 
Marc Ramirez 
Strange days indeed 

They're everywhere. 
Unless you excommunicate yourselffrom the rest ofthe civilized world, there aren't many places you can go without running into a few here and there. If I didn't know any better I'd say they were a plague sent from the heavens to punish me for my wrongdoings, but since I haven't done any wrong in the last eight years or so, that's out ofthe question. 
The country is crawling with them -look out your window and you'll probably see a couple buzzing about, seemingly innocent but silently deadly. You may have to deal with some at close range today, and ifyou're allergic to them like I think I am, you could be in for trouble. 
You might even be one. 
That's right, we're talking yuppies -young upwardly-mobile professionals, spreading across the country at geometric rates, following all the trends and making me downright nauseous as they do it. 
I can see you're worried about being one already, and that's a good sign, because ifone characteristic typifies a bona fide yuppie, it's that he's damn proud to be one, thank you very much. 
There are those who would like to be yuppies. There are those who think they're yuppies. And then there are those who are yuppies. Let's examine the latter, shall we? YUPPIE HANGOUTS: 
Personally, my first instinct when I see more than maybe three 
yuppies at a time is to run screaming for the nearest door with an 
"Exit" sign over it. I once had a class in Hayes-Healy, and ifyou 
know Hayes-Healy you know that as many as 40 or 50 yuppies have 
been sighted coming out at one time. Walking through the building 
between classes can be quite a harrowing experience, so beware of 
the imminent dizziness which is bound to flood your senses as you 
struggle toward the door under the scrutiny ofa hundred yuppie 
eyes, clawing through a heavy fog of Polo and Chane! No. 5. 
Other yuppie hangouts on campus: Stepan Chemistry Hall,the 
Law School, the Memorial Library basement, The Snite Museum of 
Art, Courtney Tennis Center, Walsh.

7.00 
a.m. sharp -Wakes up bright and early. Mumbles something corny about hating Mondays, thanking God that it's Friday, or something similar. Drags self to shower with matching shampoo and conditioner. Emerges with ambitious look in eyes. Splashes on Pierre Cardin cologne or Giorgio perfume. Dresses in designer clothes or conservative blue suit, making sure all labels are visible. 

8.00 
a.m. -All prepped up and ready to go, gets into 1985 Honda Accord or Chevrolet Celebrity. Stops for quick breakfast anywhere croissants are served. Waits until other yuppies are done with financial section ofcounter copy of morning paper. With heart beating rapidly, checks closing DowJones average. 

8:50a.m. -Arrives at work at downtown office building. Sits in car for few minutes singing along with final verses of"Like A Virgin," then ejects Ma,donna tape from professionally installed Pioneer cassette deck. Goes to work.

a.m. -Walks cheerfully into office, says good morning to receptionist, asks for cup ofdecaffeinated coffee. Performs duties of job, subconsciously calculating the increase in personal worth with each passing action. 


1.00 
p.m. -Takes hour off for lunch. Checks options: meet other yuppies for lunch at fine dining establishment; go it alone to small deli-type place where single yuppies meet; procure brown-bagged lunch from office refrigerator -may include yogurt, exotic fruit, Diet Coke, potato salad and/or Chefs salad. If alone, spends time reading "lacocca," Business Week or anything by Sidney Shel­don/Harold Robbins/Stephen King.

Cynicism stifles the atmosphere at Notre Dame 
A fhcnd once told me that she was at odds with her life at Notre Dame. "It's the cynicism at this place," she declared, "you can't get away from it." She complained that students at Notre Dame gave up on things rather quickly, things like the social life, the admin· istration, and student government. People get com· 
Vernon Marchal 
afterwords 
partmcntalized here, she felt, without much thought or reflection. "SMC chicks" are seen as flighty, Notre Dame women are seen as con· ceited and aloof, and Notre Dame men are seen as juvenile and insensitive. It seemed to her that students too often sorted out and clas· sifted others according to negative stereotypes · as if these stereotypes could ac· count h>r a whole person. She said that she felt alone and estranged from this place, because, to her, it seemed obsessed with the baseness of things. 
I did not know what to say to her. She had been at Notre Dame longer than I. and I knew that she would probably not be impressed with the naive advice ofa freshman. Finally, I said that I sympathized with her, although in· truth my view ofNotre Dame was quite differ­ent from her's. She undoubtedly detected this, because my sympathy had little effect. I re· member wondering what made her so bitter. I felt frustrated because nothing I said seem to make any difference. 
My friend has since graduated, but in my time here I have had similar conversations with others. Their unhappiness has made me wonder. 
At a place like Notre Dame, filled with intel· ligent people, cynicism is a fashionable and seductively undemanding habit of mind; it is infinitely more respectable than hopefulness. John Kenneth Galbraith, no small intellect himself, understood this when he remarked that "the man who forsees peace, prosperity, and a decline in juvenile delinquency is a negligent and vacuous fellow. 'I1te man who foresees catastrophe has a gift ofinsight which insures that he will become a radio commen· tator. an editor of TIME or have gotten to Congress." Smart tolks like to be right about bad things. Many ofthem find that by focusing on the bad, they can appear right with great regularity and with little or no effort. Few things can promise so much for so little. 
But the appearance ofrightness is not right· ness. Not all Saint Mary's women are'airheads. Not all Notre Dame women are arrogant. Not all Notre Dame men are jerks. If these are the only kind of people one is looking for, surely one will find them. But in this search, one will inevitably come across many worthwhile and caring people as well. 
Almost without exception, the cynic at Notre Dame (or anywhere) is a person who has been sold a bill ofgoods. He makes no at· tempt to see the good or correct the bad, for he has been convinced that all such attempts reflect a naivete that is not consistent with his vaunted intelligence. For him, everything is a foregone conclusion. Such a person often becomes complacent and self-righteous. His contact with others is usually characterized 
by a doleful account of the tragedies of the day. 
Of course, the problem with cynicism is that it sets the stage tor its own prophesies. For example, chances are that the social life at Notre Dame will be bad if the student body gives up on itself. Few should be surprised that improvement rarely occurs when any sig· nificant number of people shun the prospect ofimprovement. 
How we deal with cynicism is not a mar­ginal concern. It is a concern that affects the quality of our lives at their deepest levels. Cynicism severely impairs the ability of the imagination to see possibilities and create op· tions. It hangs over inventiveness and initia­tive like a pall. It is a habit of mind that, like all habits, is learned early and dies hard. 
In the end, cynicism prevents one from being happy and at peace with himself and others. Also, it is the ultimate indicator of a weak mind, for a person with a real idea rarely has the time to turn cynical.

As the dust of death settles, life goes on 
In the midst of the fall semester I took time out from my typical editorial parade ofsocial analysis and political salvos to write a philosophical inquiry into the nature of love and lite. It was an enigmatic journey which probed and examined the fact that we take the 
Randy Fahs 
more Friday analysis 
dear and special things of those around us for granted as we trudge through our daily lives. 
The impetus for my sentimental meander· ings was my discovery that my mother had cancer. I knew then that some time in the future I would be writing the follow-up to an earlier article. 
But alas, life is not a fairy tale and we cannot always havt: happy t:ndings. We know not why
r 
some of us will live on into a ript: old age and 
~ 
why some have to leave us far to soon. So 
r 
please bear with me: as I make a few observa­tions and draw a few more conclusions about the nature oflove and life. 
Each person's lifetime is short and seemingly insignificant when viewed in terms of the continuum of human existence. If you are religious or you believe in the hereafter, then death is a beautiful and wonderous thing because it takes one from the pain, ignorance, and mundane trivialities ofdaily life. 
While the theory may provide comfort and consolation, in reality, the practice is crush· ingly painful, especially when it occurs to a dear and special person like a parent. 
Our parents snare a most special relation· ship because it is through them that we come into being. For fortunate souls. our parents are there every step of the way lO offer encour· agement and criticism, to change our diapers and bandage our skinned knees, and to smile proudly when we take our t1rst steps across the tloor and later out the door into the world. 
It is hard to imagine a mother or tather as being vulnerable when they always seem to be there for you. But parents are human beings and the time comes when they are no longer with us. The reality of their death is dealt with in due time, but the loneliness that comes with missing their presence in our lives tends to linger. 
Even when I went to school very far away, I knew that Mom was only a phone call away if! had a problem, or something special hap· pened that day, or even if I just wanted to call and find out if the Sabers won. 
Fifry years and 72 days is so brief a period, but once our candle oflife is ignited, we know not when its flame will t1nally flicker out. While I'd give anything in the world to have my mother back, I take solace in the fact that I gained so much from her while she was in my life. I shared a special relationship with her and I can honestly say that she died knowing how much I loved her and how important she was to me. 
There is no practical reason tor my digres­sions on these pages: the relationsip between a parent and a child is a very special thing. For those ofyou who still have living parents, pull them close to you and let them know that you love them. There is no such thing as a "generation gap;" that's a term used to explain a loss ofcommunication. 
Ifyou harbor a grudge with your parents or you feel that they don't understand you, just imagine how you would feel if they were sud· denly gone !(>rever. How...many things would be left undone or unsaid? 
It is a sobering thought to say the least. I do not know how many people actually read what is written on these pages, but for those who have made it this far, and who understand and have been touched by what I have been trying to say, I must ask a simple tavor of you. Make a special effort to pull your parents close to you. If you are fortunate enough to have your parents live to a ripe old age, then you will have had that many more warm and tender years together. 
Lastly, I wish that all of you may be spared from the emotional pain oflosing a parent, but if it should occur, then you can detlnitely find comfort in the notion that you made the most of the time that you spent with them. For me anyway, this notion has made picking up the pieces and going on with life much easier.

Conservatives are turning history on its head 
It is a thing ofwonder to watch the reversals  
ofground hy the administration and its Demo­ 
cratic adn-rsaries.  President Reagan calling  
the anti-Sandinista contras the "moral equiva­ 
lent of our founding fathers" was a glowing  
example of the change.  
...  In the past it was the American left liberals who detended revolutionaries in Latin  
r  America and the conservative loyalists who  
r  
r r  Max Lerner  
'  
r r  The Max Lerner Column  
r  
r  
~  were outraged. Now it is the conservatives  
!  who side with the revolutionary contras and the left liberals who are outraged at the "immorality" of overthrowing a sovereign es­tablished government.  
r r  'I1te ground ofdiscussion has suffered a shift like that of the geological plates underlying  
continents. At first the Reagan people tried  
the tactic of "covert" CIA aid, in a curious  
blend of careless cloaks and daggers.  The  
liberals were shocked at the covertnessness,  
as if it had not been used by a succession of  
presidents.  
Now Reagan wants a blocked $14 million to  
become open miliitary aid to the contras. He  
says, in effect, "To hell with the fig-leaf' and  
asks "What's wrong with backing the right  
kind ofrevolutions by the right kind ofpeople  
against the right enemies of the U.S.?"  
It's a question hard for revolution-oriented  
liberals to  answer.  'I1te Democratic leaders  
have been holding a series ofinquests into the  
party's disintegrating political position. They  
now  t1nd  the  president  (and  his  

spcechwriters) seizing the high moral ground 
of the American ti.llmding fathers and the 
French Resistance in behalf of the contras, 
while the liberals are reduced to a defense ofa 
status quo they had never beti.Jre revered. 
If you get under the skin of the administra­
tion's words you may t1nd a shrewd foreign 
policy tactic emerging. It is certainly not the 
"McCarthyism" which Rep. Ted Weiss (D· 
N.Y.) read into it in attacking Secretary of 
State George Shultz, nor the "Red baiting" ' 
which seems to have stirred Rep. Peter 
Kostmayer ( D-Pa. ). Both men are reading the 
events oftoday through the color prism ofthe 
post-World War II ethos. 

President Reagan and Secretary Shultz may inadvertently have been pushed by their militant Democratic opponents into a policy ofovertly aiding a revolution which continues to threaten a governmental overthrow, even when it doesn't achieve it. 
What counts is not the overthrow but the sword of retribution which hangs constantly over the heads of President Daniel Ortega and his ruling junta and makes them walk warily. Ortega's gesture of offering to send home some Cuban military and forgo some Soviet plane shipments is a slow ritual dance obvi­ously aimed at swaying congressional votes. Shultz does an equally slow ritual dance aimed at influencing the moderate Contradora na­tions of the region. 
The result is that the Communists through· out the region are on their best behavior lest another Grenada or a strengthening of the Sal· vadoran guerrillas tip the precarious "correlation offorces" against them. Thus the hacking of the contras may be achieving ex­actly the bolsteringoflegitimacy in the whole Latin American area which the past American efforts in detense of the status quo never achieved. 
So you have a conservative administration using the language and tactics of the left ("freedom lighters,'' "revolutionaries,'' "Resistance") tor conservative purposes. The same thing is happening in the Star Wars Ini­tiative where Reagan is using a high-technol­ogy weaponry for the hope of weapons abolition, and his adversaries are reduced to arguing li>r the overkill status quo of Muwal Assured Destruction (MAD). 
It is turning history as well as language on its head. It has its dangers, but dullness and hopelessness arc not among them.

homosexuality and physical intimacy. After listening to these, I find it difficult to fathom how a Catholic university can be in the busi­ness of supporting homosexuality and an openly licentious view ofsexuality. 
Most revealing was Tape 20 on female homosexuality. The tape, far beyond the value neutrality of the others to which I listened, clearly characterized religious disapproval of homosexuality as the result of "biases and fears," clearly stating that it was not morally wrong. Instead, the tape advocated a freedom for sexual self-determination and applies the dictum: If it feels good, do it. Needless to say, something is awry here. 
The very nature of being Catholic is to take our Christian heritage seriously. This means employing truths which have been super­naturally revealed for the benefit of all. Ifwe seek truly to counsel, then we must not hesitate in affirming our convictions. 
I can understand, perhaps, a stand where a psychologist simply tries to clarify a person's values without suggesting her own. Fine. But a Catholic university cannot retain its integrity by denying the very values which make it dis­tinctive. These tapes clearly do this. 
The administration, therefore, has the re­sponsibility not only to discard these poisonous tapes, but to replace them with others which will truly attend to the needs of people seeking happiness and fulfillment. This will be done, not with secular platitudes but with the Christian truths which liberate.. Re­member: it is our personal salvation which hangs on the balance.

Nicaraguan betrayal abetted by the clergy 
Dear Editor: 
As fate would have it, I had just read an arti­cle on doings in Nicaragua in the October 1984 issue of "The New Republic" and had just seen a television news report on the state of Nicaragua's army, when I chanced upon Prof. William Storey's letter to the editor of Feb. 27. He writes of John Paul II as having "systematically and relentlessly undermined the popular and highly Christian revolution" in Nicaragua. 
Granted in comparison to, say, the Bol­shevik Revolution, or the uprising of the Red Army. Nicaragua's revolution made a greater appeal to Christian themes and ideals. It cer­tainly involved many more chaps in clerical collars in intluencial positions. And indeed, the prospect of ousting a despot like Somoza won great support for the Sandinists. But however "popular and highly Christian" the revolution might have promised to be, mat­ters are much different now. 
American conservatives would say the rev­olutionaries have shown their true colors.· Liberals would lament the loss of the bright promise. No matter. One now finds de facto government by thugs -many Somozan bosses have miraculously become born-again Sandi­nista elites -and a populace where a not­uncommon cry is heard for the comparatively bounteous times under Somoza. 
The government denounces farmers for capitalist excess when they sell their produce in the market. The revolutionary elite eats the best imported food and lives well, donning the obligatory fatigues for public viewing, while the masses scramble for sanctions, despite the fact that the economy was in a shambles well before the U.S.-backed contras undertook economic sabotage in 1982. 
So the scoundrels persist in the pretense of 
popular support while they stage trumped-up 
elections and snatch teenage boys from city 
buses to serve in the army. All the while pro­
gressive priests smile beneficently from their 
cabinet posts. One need not be a toady of the 
U.S. State Department, or even a conservative, to smell a rat here. 
It was, by the way, not some puppet of the Curia but Gustavo Gutierriez who applauded the Pope's words to and about the poor during the recent trip to South America. Say what you will about john Paul, he can hardly be charged with moral inconsistence in opposing the regimes in both Po_land and Nicaragua. The two share a basic failing: the betrayal of the aspirations of a largely Christian people. The double-dealing in Nicaragua is all the more scandalous in being abetted by the boys in black.  
Thomas Smith Notre Damegraduate student 
Father Sorin wanted to have ROTC on campus 
DearEditor: 
Whether they are sitting in the classroom, doing situps in the grass, running in formation, or marching across campus with weapons in their hands, the ROTC cadets at the University ofNotre Dame are preparing to take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States-the same Constitution that gave Nolasco the right to express his opinion in his letter to the editor March 6. 
Unfortunately, Nolasco chose to describe the ROTC training as "humiliating" and "insulting." Does he too find the preservation of his first amendment rights "humiliating" and "insulting"? 
Nolasco is bothered by the fact that the Army ROTC "folk" not only vocalize "obnoxious Army chants" and paint their faces, but they crossed campus with weapons in their hands enroute to their training site. He suggest that such a practice at a Catholic uni­versity should make Father Sorin turn over in his grave and make present University officials take prompt action to cease this disgrace. 
Just a a point of information, Father Sorin favored the formation of a military company and in the Spring of I859, he requisitioned and received Army weapons to supply the cadets with arms. In 1880, Father Corby for­warded a petition to the War Department re­questing that an officer be detailed to instruct the cadets -he too requisitioned weapons. Present University officials recognize the im­portance ofwell-trained Christian leaders. 
Nolasco should not be humiliated by the presence of ROTC programs on a Catholic campus, but should be relieved that the mili­tary will have such qualified, responsible Christian leaders. 
Nolasco's solution to get the cadets out of his sight -possibly to the "bottom of St. joe's Lake" -is neither very Christian nor very con­stitutional. Those cadets in ROTC have the right to be there and to pain their faces just as Nolasco has the right not to be in ROTC and the right to choose a university without ROTC.

Prof. Rice offers to 
explain his position 
DearEditor: 
Brian McKeon's column on March 5 criticized my participation in the defense of the four youths accused of bombing abortion chambers in Pensacola, Florida. Because of the pre-trial order, I cannot discuss the case but I can make available without further com­ment materials which are already in the public domain. Had McKeon contacted me and ex· pressed the concerns which he voiced in his article, I could have provided such material to him. He could have avoided the numerous misrepresentations in his article. 
I will be pleased to provide for any inter­ested member of the University community a copy of the brief submitted by the defense team of which Professor Frank E. Booker, Mary Frances Hasson and I are members. In­cidentally, apart from the locally retained counsel, no member of that team is receiving any fee other than a nominal fee ofone dollar. I will also be pleased to provide a copy of an article, "The Bomber As Victim," which I had published in january in The Wanderer, a Cath­olic newspaper. 
If members of the University community 
are interested in informing themselves on this 
issue, I hope they will avail themselves of this 
opportunity. If they are not so interested, I 
hope they will at least have the grace to refrain 
from inflicting their uninformed opinions 
upon others.

'Counseline' promotes non-Catholic attitudes 
DearEditor: 
The forum upon which I am about to 
engage has in the past been abused by ir­
responsible hyperbole. I wish not to contrib­
ute to this tradition with any caustic or 
inflammatory statements. Instead, I wish to 
make a point which concerns the administra­
tion of this University and its commitment to 
its Catholic nature. 
It has come to my attention that the psycho­
logical services of Notre Dame include a proj­
ect called Counseline. This service allows 
students wishing to know more about a cer­
tain subject to call and make a selection from a 
number oftapes.

"We're in the tournament now and looking forward to playing," said senior guard Dan Duff, a first­time participant in the NCAAs, like all his teammates save for Barry Spencer. "Anything can happen once you're in. Who knows how far we can go?" 
Should the Irish advance beyond Oregon State, they will be matched against the North Carolina-Middle Tennessee State winner. After that, the team which emerges from these four will travel to Birmingham, Ala., along with the twice­victorious among Kansas, Ohio U, Purdue and Auburn, for the regional semifinals on March 22. 
Yet, as far as Phelps is concern­ed, there can be no looking past Oregon State.

through the first half to turn a tight 18-14 game into a 32-14 runaway. 
In the second half, things got worse for the Muskateers, as Notre Dame scored the first eight points after intermission to take a 51-28 lead. The Muskateers didn't help their own cause, as they shot a dismal 22 percent in the second half. For the game, Xavier hit on just 32 percent of its shots, while the Irish connected on an im­pressive 55 percent. 
In the scoring department, the Irish were paced by Mary Beth Schueth's 19 points and Sandy Botham's 18. Senior Laura Dougherty, who joined classmates Schueth and Ruth Kaiser in the starting lineup for their final regular season contest, contributed 10 points and five assists. Kaiser played her typically solid defensive game and added four points, two of those on a half-court shot that swished through the net as the final buzzer sounded. 
"There wasn't a lot of continuity to this game," said DiStanislao. "It was really a physical game. I'm proud of my players because they didn't come out flat for this game, State for now," said the Irish coach. "That's all we can do. You worry about North Carolina, you lose to Oregon State. It's as simple as that." 
The Irish and Beavers have had two common opponents this season, UCLA and Washington. Notre Dame nipped UCLA, 53-52, in Pauley Pavilion in February, and beat Washington, 57-50, a week ago yesterday in the ACC. The Beavers, meanwhile, split with both. Oregon State dropped the Bruins, 59-49, at home in Corvalis before losing the return game in L.A., 59-51. The Ralph Miller­coached Beavers beat the Huskies, 52-45, in Washington, but were taken to the cleaners in Corvalis later in the season, losing 60-45. 
Oregon State is paced by 6-9 senior forward A.C. Green, who averages 18.8 points a game and had a high of 39 points. The Beavers average 59.5 points as a

As far as the 64-team field of the tournament games, Phelps had nothing but praise. 
"The tournament selection com­mittee did an excellent job putting things together. They seeded everyone well," said Phelps. "It's an exciting field. I think the first and second rounds will be very in­teresting. 
"I think Michigan is the team to beat in our regional. We just have to do our own thing here at the ACC, though. The students have been a part of getting us here. There won't be a student section as such, but we still need them." 
The next three days will be filled with lots of hard work for the Irish, the same hard work that got them here in the first place. The payoff for that work will be Thursday night at 9:37 when the ball goes up in the air at the ACC.

"Overall, I'm pleased with this team. I think now we're where I wanted to be five years ago, where we are on a competitive level with the tournament-caliber teams in the NCAA." 
Whether or not the NWIT selec­tion committee agrees remains to be seen. The Irish have an im­pressive record and a conference ti­tle in their favor, but lack the strong schedule of many of the tournament-bound teams. 
"We base our decisions on won­loss records, strength of schedule and the area the school is located in," said Porter Crawford, a member of the NWIT selection committee. "Strength of schedule is probably more important than won-loss records, though." 
This afternoon, the Irish will find out just how much more im­portant.

Irish top Dayton, 80-73, gain NCAA tourney bid 
ND faces Oregon St. in first game at ACC 
By JEFF BLUMB 
Assistant Sports Editor 

It's taken four years, but the Notre Dame basketball team is tinally in the NCAA tournament again. Its 20­8 regular season record, coupled with its finish as the nation's top independent, was good enough yesterday to make the Irish the seventh seed in the Southeast Regional. An extra bonus was the placement of Notre Dame at the ACC for its first-and, if necessary, second-round game. 
The Beavers of Oregon State, 22-8 overall and holding third place in the Pac 10 with a 12-6 con­ference record, will be the foe Thursday night at 9:37. that game will be preceded earlier in the day by Kansas-Ohio University at 12:07, Purdue-Auburn at 2:37, and North Carolina-Middle Tennessee State at 7:07.

Approximately 1,500 tickets for all games went on sale to the general public today at 9 a.m. at the Gate I 0 ticket office of the ACC. Tickets must be bought as a package for all six games to be at the ACC on Thursday and Saturday. Approximately 2,700 tickets had been available yesterday but the seven ACC visitors took close to 1,200 leaving Notre Dame the rest to sell.

Royal's 24 points key in double-OT victory 
By JEFF BLUMB 
Assistant Sports Editor 
DAYTON, Ohio -A pressure-packed environment. A hostile crowd. A double-overtime game. A kill-or-· be-killed situation. The question one had to ask was, was this NCAA tournament conditions or Saturday's Notre Dame-Dayton basketball g·ame at UD Arena? 
Actually, both. 
In the end, it was five-point Notre Dame spurt to open the second overtime which was the difference as the Irish dropped the Flyers, 80-73, in a contest that had all the makings of an NCAA tournament game. The win gave Notre Dame a final regular season record of 20-8 overall and 4-2 against the Midwest in­dependents. Dayton, meanwhile, closed its season out at 19-9 and an even 3-3 in independent round-robin play. 
With Marquette's win over DePaul later in the after­noon, dropping the Blue Demons to 19-9 and 3-3, and the Irish emerged as the nation's top independent, in addition to capturing the mythical Catholic league. 
Donald Royal's backdoor layup off a pass from David Rivers with 2:34 left in the second extra session put Notre Dame up by four, 71-67. Royal was fouled by Dayton's Sedric Toney on the play, fouling Toney out of the game and giving the Notre Dame sophomore a chance at the three-point play. Royal proceeded to hit the free throw to cap off the Irish surge. 
"That's what won the game for us," said Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps of the big basket. "This was by far Donald's best game ever at Notre Dame. He played especially well at the end when we needed it. 

knows there is plenty of work before Thursday. 
"Oregon State is really respectable," Phelps said after the announce­ment. "You want to play at home, and being able to is a good break for us. But I'm sure Oregon State will play its best knowing that it has its 
backs against the wall coming in here. The key for us now is just to play the way we have the last two weeks. We're primed. 
"I'm sure we'll be here looking at (video) tapes until about midnight. We have tapes of Oregon State against UCLA and Washington. We'll practice (today), and then build the intensity on Tuesday and Wednesday."

By LARRY BURKE 
Sports Writer 
CINCINNATI The Notre Dame women's basketball team ac­complished the expected on Satur­day, dispensing of an overmatched Xavier team, 78-50, to pick up its eighth straight victory. Today, the Irish will know if they accomplish­ed a much larger goal, namely the first post-season tournament bid since the program made the jump to Division I five years ago. 
NCAA women's tournament bids were announced yesterday, and Notre Dame was not among the 32 teams selected. However, the Irish are still under consideration for the National Women's Invitational Tournament, which will announce its eight-team field this afternoon. 
Despite a 20-8 record and a North Star Conference champion­ship, Notre Dame's chances of get­ting into the NCAAs were slim. The North Star Conference cham­pion does not receive an automatic bid, and there are only 15 at-large bids available in the tournament. Irish hopes became even slimmer when upsets occurred in several of last week's conference tour­naments. Seven conferences, in fact, had at least two teams selec­
ted to the tournament, and 13 
unranked teams received bids. 
Notre Dame's impressive con­ference play led to a 13-1 NSC record, but ·coach Mary DiStanislao's squad ultimately lost out in the eyes of the selection com­mittee because of early season losses to tournament-bound teams such as Tennessee, UCLA and 
usc. 
"It's very disappointing," said DiStanislao, "especially because we know from all the teams we've seen this season that we are of the caliber of the teams in the NCAA Tournament. We didn't receive a bid, so we were obviously penalized for our early season losses. That's an important lesson to the players. You've got to play every game ­they all count." 
Saturday's game was a good ex­ample. Although the Irish had already wrapped up the conference title, a convincing win over the Muskateers was still necessary to strengthen Notre Dame's tourna­ment hopes. 
The Irish vanquished any possibility of a Xavier upset, however, as they ran off 14

Friday's Bengal Bout finals feature action-packed, hard-hitting fights 
ByJOE BRUNEITI 
Sports Writer 
With the amount of punches thrown and the intensity of the ac· tion at Friday night's Bengal Bout finals, it almost seemed as if Sugar Ray Leonard was fighting at Madison Square Garden. No, Suger Ray didn't fight and the Bouts were held at Stepan Center, but the action was nonetheless furious from the begin­ning. 
Jim Priola dominated Marshall "The Law" Rodgers enroute to his first 140-pound championship. Priola took command of the fight from the beginning, utilizing a straight left that connected more than a few times to Rodgers' head. The senior took Rodgers to the ropes in the first and after a series of combinations to the body and head Rodgers was almost knocked out of the ring. 
In the second, Priola pulled the same stunt and once again Rodgers almost landed on one of the judges lap. Rodgers started to show his fatigue later in the round and he began to drop his hands, leaving his face wide open for Priola to score points with his straight left. 
Priola finished the fight relatively unscathed. while his counterpart couldn't boast ofsuch luck. 
The 140-pound final. pitting Tom "the Bull" L.ezynski against Ed "Munster" Kelly, was built up as one of the best fights of the night, and it lived up to its expectations. 
While round one went to L.ezynski, the second round was a different story. Kelly sent a blister­ing right to l.ezynski's head. The ref­eree, acting prematurely, gave Lezynski a standing eight count. At the end of the round Kelly and L.ezynski got into a furious exchange offlurries against the ropes. 
With Lezynski having won round one and Kelly round two, the last round laid it all on the line. Both fighters knew it, and after a furious third it was Kelly who had his second championship. 
"Smokin"' Joe Collins survived a dogfight with Todd Lillie in the semis, and the I 50· pound junior had enough left Friday night to collect his first Bengals crown over Jim "Quick" Silver. Collins took control of the match and had Silver in trou· ble many times throughout the bout, but was unable to finish off his op· ponent. The combinations that did connect. however, scored enough points to give Collins the unanimous decision. 
Ed Reilly outslugged I 55-pound opponentJeff Anhut for his tirst Ben­gals crown. Reilly delivered some deadly combinations in the tirst, and he missed on an uppercut that would have sent Anhut reeling. In the second and third rounds Anhut went on the attack, but Reilly warded him otf with a left jab that met Anhut's face many times. 
After Ed "Wolf' Gavagan survived a brawl with joe Simmons in the semis, and Dan Watzke was never really challenged in his semitinal bout, it seemed that (iavagan would have the advantage going in to Friday night's 160-pound tlnal. That was not how things turned out, however. 
After a quiet first, Watzke started to strut his stuff. The senior didn) lose control and start throwing garbage. Instead he picked apart Gavagan, and when he threw some· thing it almost always hit something of Gavagan's. At the end Gavagan was exhausted, but it was Watzke who had his first championship. 
The 165-pound championship, as expected, wa.~ a brawl. It pitted Tom Hardart against Don "Transpo" Antrobus. Antrobus had TKO'd his first two opponents and Hardart en· 
tered  the  tournament  a.~  the  
number-one-seed.  Ironically,  the  
two fighters are best friends.  

In the first, Hardart didn't throw a whole lot of punches, but the few he did he connected on. Antrobus used his devastating right all night, and he threw one in the first that sent liar­dart flying back. 
In the second the tight became a bloodbath. Antrobus threw sen::ral combinations that left Hardart's face looking like a piece of prime rib. Hardart wa.~ seeing stars and almost hit the canvas several times. 
Hardart answered the bell in tht· third, but he would have heen better off staying in his corner. Antrobu~. once again, dished up some of his power-packed combinations that only worsened llardart's mental state, and llardart's corner wanted the light stopped several times. The referee finally did stop tht· fight at 
I: 12 of the third. 
Antrobus collectt·d his third TKO and pron·d to be one of the most dangerous fighters of the Bengals.
