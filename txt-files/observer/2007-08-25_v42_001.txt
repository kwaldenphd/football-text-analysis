2 ND students shot outside Club 23 
Recovering seniors expected to enroll for fall semester; police continue investigation 
By KAREN LANGLEY News Editor 
Police are still searching for the man who shot and wounded two Notre Dame students early Tuesday out­side the Club 23 bar on Notre Dame Avenue. 
Seniors Matthew Collins and Mitchell Depree were shot around 1 a.m. Tuesday following a "harsh" conver­sation with the shooter, who returned several minutes later in an SUV and fired five shots a·t the students, said Capt. Phil Trent, a spokesperson for the South Bend Police Department. 
The students were taken to St. Joseph Regional Medical Center, .where Depree was treated for a leg wound and then released, Trent said. The gunshot wounds Collins received to his abdomen and leg, however, were initially considered so life threaten­ing that he requested and received last rites. 
Collins said Thursday he is "doing fine" and expected to make a full recovery. A bul­let will remain permanently in his abdomen, however, since any~ procedure to remove it would be too risky, he said. 
Collins said the shooter ­who neither he nor his

Crisis notification 
system launches 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Assistant News Editor 
Notre Dame will launch a mass notification system this fall to enable administrators to notify students of any eampus emer­gency via e-mail, text message and voice mail. 
The University began exploring the idea of putting a notification system in place during the fall of 2006, said Jay Steed, executive assistant to Chief Information Officer Gordon Wishon. 
The Office of Information Technologies had originally planned to do a pilot project with the notification system, Steed said. But Notre Dame sped up its plan this spring following Ap1;il's tragedy at Vrrginia Tech. 
Notre Dame officials signed a contract May 23 with the Connect-ED service, a company that uses web-based technology to help clients send messages to large numbers of people in a short period of time. 
The Office of the Registrar sent students an e-mail Aug. 22 requesting they submit a cell phone number and a non-Notre Dame e-mail address when they enroll for the semester. This con­tact information will be kept pri­vate and will be used only for emergency notifications, Steed said.

This year, being a freshman is something to brag about. 
The Class of 2011 is new on the Notre Dame campus, but its members have made it through the most selective admissions process in University history. 
The 1,993 students in the freshman class are among the 24 percent of applicants accepted this year by the University. 
Only 15 years ago, Notre Dame accepted a full 50 per­cent of applicants for the Class of 1996. 
Notre Dame is one of less than 10 U.S. universities that accepts fewer than 50 per­cent of applicants and then enrolls more than 50 percent of accepted students, said Daniel Saracino, assistant provost for admissions. 
"The student who applies to Notre Dame has Notre Dame as a first choice," he said. 
The average SAT score of the freshman class -1390 on the critical reading and

Voting delayed on ordinance 
Plan to require party permits stalls 
By KAREN LANGLEY 
News Editor" 
The South Bend Common Council voted Aug. 20 to post­pone the public hearing on the proposed ordinance that would require students living off campus to register large parties 10 days in advance. 
The ordinance would require residents of "board­ing houses" -residences with two or more unrelated occupants -to apply for a permit from the city 10 days prior to any gatherings that host more than 25 guests and serve alcohol. 
The public hearing will be held Aug. 27. Council mem­bers said this would allow time for any changes needed to enforce the bill and defend against any legal challenges -two concerns raised at the Community Relations Committee meeting held ear­lier Monday night. 
Immediately before the Council meeting, Mayor Steven Luecke advised the Community Relations Committee to postpone the hearing for 30 days. 
"Through good dialogue, [the billl will have a chance to do what we want it to do," he said.

Largest class arrives at Saint Mary's 
Increase in freshman enrollment part of5-year plan to boost school size 
By KATIE KOHLER Saint Mary's Editor 
The 481 students who will enroll at Saint Mary's this week comprise the largest freshman class to enter the College in 17 years -an increase that officials say is critical to the College's development. 
The increase comes as the first goal in a five-year plan to stabilize enroll­ment at 1,600, said Dan Meyer, Vice President for Enrollment Management. 
"At this size [1,600 to 1, 700], Saint Mary's will be a more robust institu­tion, better able to absorb

Construction projects continue across campus 
Law School construction begins on Notre Dame Avenue; Duncan Hall remains on schedulefor summer 2008 completion

Several construction proj­ects are underway at Notre Dame as the University con­tinues to execute its 10-year development plan. 
On the west side of campus, Duncan Hall, a new male dor­mitory, is being built next to McGlinn Hall. Work on the building, funded by 1952 Notre Dame graduate Haymond T. Duncan, will be completed by the summer of 2008 and should house stu­dents in the fall of that year. The dorm will house 232 stu­dents and is being built to relieve overcrowding in the residence halls on campus.

more dorms is included in the 10-year master plan. 
Workers are currently in the process of completing masonry work on the second floor of Duncan, Vice President for Business Operations Jim Lyphout said. 
In preparation for a new Law School building on DeBartolo quad, work was done last spring on the 

chilled water system between the Morris Inn and the Notre Dame Post Office. The Post Office was then torn down during the summer to accom­modate for the new building. 
Work is now underway on the law building, Lyphout said. An area beside the existing Law School has been 
fenced off, blocking pedestrian traffic down sidewalks from Main Circle to DeBartolo H a I I Excavation for the building is slated to start during the first week of school. 
Further south on 
Notre Dame Avenue, con­struction on the new engi­neering building should start after Thanksgiving. Stinson­Remnick Hall, a $69.4 million engineering building, will be erected on the site currently occupied by the University Club. 
The University Club will be torn down around Thanksgiving to make way for the work. Stinson-Hemnick Hall should be completed in approximately three years. 
The segment of Juniper Hoad which previously ran through campus was elosed to traffic last year and has been transformed into a walker-friendly area, with a pedestrian plaza between Notre Dame Stadium and the Joyce Center. 
During the week before commencement in May, a storm with high winds passed through the campus and knocked a small spire off the upper part of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. As a pre­caution, the three remaining small spires were removed during the summer. The spires will be replaced and other renovation and repair 
work will be done on the out­side of the building. These repairs will not take place until summer 2008. 
"It requires the erecting of scaffolding, and we don't want to do that now that school has started," he said. "We will wait until after grad­uation next year."

Starting this semester, the area between the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center and Edison Hoad will be devel­oped into Notre Dame Commons, a park-like area of approximately 12 acres. 
The space will be land­scaped and sidewalks will be added. Eventually, Lyphout said, the Commons area may have features like a clock tower and a sundial. 
Immediately south of cam­pus, construction should begin this fall on Eddy Street Commons, a 25-acre, $200 million project that will cre­ate a new residential area and will feature retail shops, restaurants and hotels. 
The retail and restaurant sections should be completed by the summer of 2009, and the town homes and condo­miniums will be developed in phases, with completion set between 2009 and 2011.

Hotel to open at Saint Mary's 
Congregation of the Sisters of tlw Holy Cross President Sister Joy O'Grady announced Aug. 16 plans for Saint Mary's to lease eampus land to the Holladay Corporation for an on-campus Hilton Garden Inn. The addition of the hotel. expected to open by the start of the 2007 football season, prompted a contest for the renaming of the Inn at Saint Mary's and concern about the possible influx of travelers on campus. 
Notre Dame begins mission in 
Uganda 
The second annual Notre Dame Forum, focusing on the "global health crisis," took place Sept. 14 in the Joyee Center. The forum's panelists included Dr. Paul Farmer, the founding director of the inter­national non-profit organiza­tion Partners in Health, Dr. Jeffrey Sachs, director of the United Nations Millennium Project and Dr. Miriam Opwonya of the Makerere University Infectious Diseases Institute in Uganda. 
At the forum, University President Father John Jenkins announced the University's decision to participate in the Millennium Villages Project in Uganda, where the Congregation of the Holy Cross has established a strong presence. 
Jenkins followed that dis­cussion with a trip to Uganda in support of the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals and Notre Dame's commitment to the village of Nindye, in hope of improving the quality of life of its residents. From Jan. 5 through Jan. 12, Jenkins led a group of delegates -inelud­ing Executive Assistant to the President Frances Shavers, Associate Vice President for Marketing Communication

More than 200 students gathered at the Grotto the next day for a candlelight memorial in honor of the sen­ior from Pasquerilla East Hall. 
'Loyal Daughters' debuts 

"Loyal Daughters," a stu­dent-created production about sexuality and sexual assault at Notre Dame, pre­miered Nov. 13 at the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center without Jenkins' endorsement. The play, whose inception he praised in his "Closing Statement" on aca­demic freedom in April 2006, ran without his endorsement because of what he called a "neutral" stance on extramar­ital sexual relationships. 
The performances were fol­lowed on three nights by pan­els discussing the prevalence of sexual assaults on college campuses -including Notre Dame -and the hope of pro­moting an environment more conductive to fostering bettor gender relationships.

Crews cause gas leaks 
A gas leak on St. Joseph's Drive caused the evacuation of seven buildings -includ­ing DeBartolo Hall and Decio Hall-on campus Feb. 13. 
Crews working to fix a bro­ken water line struck a 4-inch gas line with a backhoe, prompting gas and soot to rise more than 20 feet in the air for more than an hour. 
A month later, on March 26, a construction crew working on St. Joseph's Drive south of the Center for Social Concerns caused the rupture of another gas line. In that incident, vibrations from the digging likely unsettled the soil and caused rupture in the transition point, "that had been failing already," Director of Utilities Paul Kempf said. 
University officials defended staff efforts after each inci­dent and said they were just examples of the inherent pos­sible problems of construc­tion. 
Brown, Braun make history 
After a hotly contested race for the top two spots in stu­dent government, Liz Brown and Maris Braun were elected student body president and vice president, respectively, in a closed-door Student Senate meeting Feb. 18. 
The final vote came after a run-off with contenders Danny Smith and Ashley Weiss failed to produce a majority winner. During that race, Morrissey senator Greg Dworjan illegally used stu­dent government printers to produce flyers for the "cam­paign to abstain" and posted the flyers without proper approval. The campaign criti­cized both tickets and asked students to select the "abstain" option on their bal­lots.

'Vagina Monologues' opens off campus 
Students performed the first of three renditions of "The Vagina Monologues" in front of an audience of approxi­mately 50 people at South Bend's First Unitarian Church Feb. 28. 
The presentation, which was moved off campus after organizers could not secure the endorsement of an aca­demic department at Notre Dame, came nearly a year after Jenkins' decision not to ban the play from campus but instead restrict it to an aca­demic setting, in which it can­not raise money. By moving off-campus, the performance was able to collect more than $200 on opening night and donate the money to chari­ties, including the YWCA of St. Joseph County, which has the only overnight shelter in the county. 
Campus construction progresses 
Construction on several projects continued throughout the school year, with work on campus roads, new buildings and repairs. 
The most striking change early in the school year was the closing of Juniper Road and the creation of a new entrance to campus several hundred feet west of Twyckenham Road. 
The University also pushed forward its planned develop­ment south of campus, with Kite Realty submitting its pro­posal to South Bend for zon­ing approval in late April. As the University plans the future of the southern side of campus, it continued con­struction of a new road from the "C" parking lot to Edison Road to replace Juniper Road. 

In March, Notre Dame broke ground on Duncan Hall, a planned male dormitory on West Quad. 
Duncan Hall will house 232 students and stand next to McGlinn Hall, which was the last dorm built by the University, completed in 1997. The new dorm will be the first of four new dormito­ries the University hopes to build in the next 10 years. Executive Vice President John Affleck-Graves said the new building, funded by 1952 Notre Dame graduate Raymond T. Duncan, will be completed by the summer of 2008 and will house students that fall. Construction on "Athletic Quad" -between Notre Dame Stadium and the Joyce Center -will continue as the University makes the space more pedestrian friend­ly. 
Memorial Mass held for Va. Tech victims 
Notre Dame held a memori­al Mass in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart April 17 for the victims of the shooting mas­sacre at Virginia Tech days earlier. 
The Basilica was packed to a standing room only capaci­ty, with the entire rear lobby of the church completely full. The Mass drew more people than the 9/11 five-year anniversary Mass, which took place in the Basilica during the fall semester. 
In the days after the inci­dent, Notre Dame officials were initially hesitant to com­ment on the University secu­rity protocols. Three days after the shootings, Jenkins sent an e-mail to students ­which was also posted on his Web site -assuring students and parents the University has a plan in place to respond to emergencies.

NCAA president discusses reform 
Special to The Observer 
NCAA President Myles Brand acknowledged that he was "preaehing to the choir" when he discussed academic and fiscal reform in intercol­legiate athletics at Notre Dame on Aug. 20. 
"You're doing very well hnre," Brand told an invited assembly of Notre Dame fac­ulty, staff', athletic depart­ment officials and coaches. "Athletics is about winning, but it's also about graduat­ing student-athletes. You ean do both, just look at Notre Dame." 
Now in his fifth year as NCAA president, Brand said modern reform in college sports dates to a 1991 report by the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, which was co-chaired by Notre Dame's president emeritus, Hev. Theodore M. llesburgh, C.S.C. 
Brand, formerly president at Indiana University and the University of' Oregon, believes his appointment was a dear signal by his peers that they want athlet­ics programs to show more 
in the past, and that he anticipates resistance if or when sanctions are applied to programs that fail to meet APH standards. 
"Can the presidents, ath­letic directors and NCAA hold the fort'?" he wondered. "It will be very interesting." 
Brand admitted that fiscal reformation in college sports is a more dil'licult issue. 
"The NCAA cannot control individual institutions' deci­sions on spending," he said. 
Brand said that athletic department budgets are a relatively small percentage of any university's overall budget, but that the rate by which they are increasing is a concern. 
Over the past decade, the athletics programs of only six institutions -including Notre Dame -have been in the blaek, while the rest are subsidized to greater or lesser extents by their uni­versities. 
"Now, there is nothing wrong with subsidizing a department. After all, phi­losophy departments, for example, don't bring in more money than they spend," said Brand,

The c;sH provides.~ "r_nore accurate measure of the graduation rate of' student­athlntes than does a similar measure administered by the Department of' Education, according to Brand. 
The APH surveys the per­formance of' every team at nvery NCAA institution. Teams that fail to maintain a minimum standard will race a loss of' scholarships and potential decertification. 
"We'll be most successful if' we don't issue any of the sanctions," Brand said. "The goal is to change behavior." 
However, after accumulat­ing APH data for three years, Brand said there are indications that as many as 40 percent of football pro­grams in the Football Bowl Subdivision, formerly known as Division 1-A, and 45 per­cent of Division I basketball programs could lose schol­arships within the next year or two. 
"Somnone's not listening out there," he said. That isn't the case at Notre Dame, he emphasized. 
"You don't have any teams even close to being at risk of' losing scholarships," he said. "That is very unusual. Even the very finest schools havn one or two teams at risk." 
Brand addnd that acadnm­ie reform movements in higher ndueation have failed rience on a 
college campus is valuable, he said, and certainly has a place in higher education. 
"College is more than just classroom instruction," he said. "We take teen-agers and teach them life skills, goal setting, values and atti­tudes that are productive. 
"That's where athletic par­ticipation comes in. Learning to persist and work hard -athletes learn that every day on the field. Not all of our students learn these lessons as tangibly. There are other ways -in student journalism, band or other extracurricular activi­ties -but athletics is the best. That's why we want broad-based athletics pro­grams." 
That said, he added: "So, how much should we subsi­dize athletics'? We are not acting fiscally responsibly when funds are being taken from academics to support athletics. That's when there is a problem." 
While the NCAA is unable to dictate how universities chose to spend on athletics, the association sponsored a study that was issued last year that provides all insti­tutions with comparative data on athletics spending. 
Brand's talk  was  titled  
"The  State  of'  Collegiate  
Athletics  in  the  21st  

Century: Issues, Challenges and Expectations" and was sponsored by Notre Dame's OITice of' the President, Faculty Board on Athletics and Department of Athletics. 


Fein nan1ed nevv director of CEST 
Civil engineering, geological sciences professor replaces Maurice 
Special to The Observer 
Jeremy B. Fein, professor of civil engineering and geological sciences and director or the Environmental Molecular Science Institute at Notre Dame, has been appointed 
director of the University's Center for Environmental Science and Technology (CEST). He replaces Patricia A. 

Maurice, pro-Fein fessor of civil engineering and geological sci­ences, who had served as director since 2003. 
A cooperative effort between Notre Dame's Colleges of Engineering and Science, CEST fosters interdisciplinary environ­mental research and education by promoting the cutting-edge ana­lytical technologies and providing the advanced instrumentation needed to address complex envi­ronmental issues. 
"The center offers a unique interdisciplinary environment that enhances researeh capabilities for faculty and students throughout the University," Fein said. "Its main function is to provide a wealth of state-of-the-art analyti­cal facilities that a single investi­gator could never manage or maintain on his or her own. In addition, we have extremely well­trained technicians who maintain the instruments and teach stu­dents and faculty how to use them. 
"CEST plays a crucial role in research projects that involve departments across the University, such as biological sci­ences, civil engineering and geo­logical sciences, chemical and biomolecular engineering, chem­istry and biochemistry, the Notre Dame Radiation Laboratory, and anthropology." 
Fein's research encompasses geomicrobiology and aqueous environmental geochemistry. lie uses experimental data to con­struct quantitative thermodynam­ic and kinetic models of' mass transport in baeteria-water-rock systems, whieh are used to quan­tify heavy metal and radionuclide mobilities in systems of geologic and environmental interest, sueh as eontaminated groundwater aquifers and oil-field reserves. 
Fein earned a doctorate in geo­chemistry from Northwestern University in 1989, a master's degree, also in geochemistry from Northwestern, in 1986, and a bachelor's degree in geophysical sciences from the University of Chicago in 1983. 
Prior to joining the Notre Dame faculty in 1996, he served as an assistant professor in the Department of' Earth and Planetary Sciences at McGill University in Montreal. 



ND hosts sesquicentennial 
Fort Wayne/South Bend diocese invited to religious celebration 
Special to The Observer 
Families, single people, reli­gious and clergy of the Diocese of Fort Wayne/South Bend have been invited to the Notre Dame campus on Aug. 18 for a Eucharistic Congress celebrating the diocese's 150th anniversary. 
Local, regional, and interna­tional Eucharistic Congresses have been held throughout the Catholic Church since 1881. Their principal purpose is to deepen understanding and invig­orate devotion to the Eucharist, and they are often convened to mark special occasions in the life of the Church. 
Bishop John M. D'Arcy of Fort Wayne/South Bend expressed his "fervent hope that all the faithful of our diocese will pilgrimage to the University of Notre Dame for a day of spiritual joy and renew­al." Calling the campus "a place dedicated to Mary, the mother of' God," he added that the Congress would include "some­thing for everyone to renew hearts and spirits in Christ whose 'steadfast love endures forever."' 
Joining Bishop D'Arcy at the Congress will be Notre Dame fel­low and trustee Bishop Daniel R. Jenky, C.S.C., of Peoria, Ill., and Archbishop Daniel Buechlein, O.S.B., of Indianapolis. 
The daylong event featured 120 catechetical lectures and discussions, an ecumenieal 
prayer service in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, a continual recitation of the Rosary at the Grotto of our Lady of Lourdes, praying of' the Stations of the Cross, provision of the Saerament of Heconciliation at several sites throughout the campus, and an exhibition of local religious art in the Joyce Center. 
"I have requested there be no Masses, weddings, funerals, rec­onciliation or athletic and school activities in the parishes and high schools of the diocese that Saturday," D'Arcy said. "This will make everyone free to come together for one magnificent liturgy at the conclusion of' the day." 

Team works to make ionic solvents 
University researchers actively pursue clean energy technologies 
Special to The Observer 
Researchers at Notre Dame have a proven track record in energy related research, but with the creation of the Notre Dame Energy Center in 2005, they joined the many other insti­tutions actively pursuing clean energy technologies. What is unique about one of the most current projects is that it evolved from unrelated research creat­ing a domino effect. 
Edward J. Maginn, professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering, and a team of facul­ty and students had been work­ing to make environmentally friendly solvents using ionic liq­uids (ILs). ILs are a relatively new class of chemicals with diverse properties. In addition to being liquid at room tempera­ture, many ILs have low com­bustibility, provide exceptional thermal stability and work well as solvents for diverse com­pounds. 
"We didn't expect the carbon dioxide to be so soluble," Maginn said in an interview for the arti­cle "Making Dirty Coal Plants Cleaner," which appeared in the July 13 issue of' the journal Seience. "It sounds trite, I know, but one of the exciting things about research is how pursuing one activity can shed light on another, opening totally new avenues of possibility." 
The team -Maginn; Joan F. Brennecke, the Keating­Crawford Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and director of the Notre Dame Energy Center; William F. Schneider, associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engi­neering; postdoctoral research associates JaNeille Dixon, Wei Shi and Keith Gutowski; and graduate students Jessica Anderson, Manish Kelkar and Elaine Mindrup -began exploring their findings in a series of' difl'erent experiments. They are now working on a fed­erally funded project to capture and separate C02 for existing and future carbon-based electric generation power plants. 
This is particularly important because emissions from the coal­fired plants (approximately 2,100 in the world) are responsi­ble for close to a third of the greenhouse gases caused by humanity. In the United States alone, the gases some 600 plants produce surpass the amount generated by cars and all other industries combined. Hegardless of its country of origin, C02 con­centrations in the atmosphere have increased since the onset of industrialization. Today levels are at approximately 380 parts per million, a number that's expected to rise to 500 or more parts per million by 2050. Is it any wonder that finding a way to curb these carbon emissions is a popular idea'? 
According to Maginn, there are basically three approaches to capturing C02 in flue gas: pre­combustion capture, post-com­bustion capture, and oxy-firing. Maginn and the team are con­centrating on post-combustion activities, which apply to the vast majority of existing power plants in the world. In l'aet, they have established a cooperative research and development agreement to develop novel tech­nology and commercially focused approaches to C02 capture and separation and are working with DTE Energy, Detroit, Mich.; Babcock and Wileox, Babnrton, Ohio; EMD Chemicals, Inc., Gibbstown, New Jersey; Trimeric, Buda, Texas; Air Products, Allentown, Pa.; and the National Energy Technology Laboratory, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Political 


examines 
scientist diversity 
ND professor published zn APSA journal 
Special to The Observer 
The federal Voting Rights Act has been indispensable to the political progress of minority populations in the United States, but they still are severely underrepresent­ed at every level of govern­ment, new research by a University of Notre Dame political scientist indicates. 
Writing with three co­researchers in a journal of the American Political Science Association (APSA), Dianne M. Pinderhughes, professor of Africana studies and political science, observed that, at the congressional level, "the vast majority of nonwhite House members" were elected from districts covered by the Voting Rights Act, which was passed originally in 1965 to end dis­criminatory electoral prac­tices in the South. 
The law has been renewed several times, and its cover­age expanded to assure access to the vote for people who speak languages other than English. Beginning in 1982, the law also protected the creation of "majority­minority" districts, so that nonwhite voters would have a chance to elect candidates of their respective groups to office 
Pinderhughes and her col­leagues found that of the 71 black, Latino, Asian and American Indian House mem­bers in the 109th Congress, more than 60 percent came from districts covered by one or another of the anti-dis­crimination provisions of the Voting Rights Act. All 25 of the Latino members came from such districts. 
At both the congressional and state legislative levels, the sheer numbers of non­white representatives have grown substantially over the last quarter century, but in percentage terms, they remain far short of true pro­portionality. 
Nonwhites were 31 percent of the U.S. population in 2000, but they were less than 12 percent of the members of the House of Representatives. The 891 nonwhite members of state legislatures in 2006 were only 12 percent of the total 7,382 state lawmakers. 
Pinderhughes' co-researchers are Pei-te Lien of the University of Utah, Carol Hardy-Fanta of the University of Massachusetts at Boston, and Christine M. Sierra of the University of New Mexico. 
The voting rights article appeared in PS: Political Science and Politics, one of three journals published by APSA. The data in the article are related to a larger study on elected officials of color being conducted by the same research team. 
Pinderhughes joined the Notre Dame faculty in autumn 2006 from the University of Illinois-Urbana. She currently is president-elect of APSA and will assume the presidency at the organization's 2007 annu­al meeting in Chicago next month. 
Candidates to woo voters at GOP conference 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Fred Thompson, the all-but­declared GOP presidential candidate, will join two other contenders in wooing hun­dreds of activists from 12 Midwestern states during a three-day Republican get­together that begins Friday. 
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Arkansas Gov. Mike lluckabee also will speak at the Midwest Republican Leadership Conference, billed as a springboard for GOP presidential candidates in an electoral-rich region that includes key nominating states such as Iowa. Illinois and Michigan. 
All have caucuses or pri­maries by Feb. 5, and Ohio ­which decided the 2004 pres­idential race -is a tradition­al swing state in general elections. Combined, the 12 states -which also include Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, the Dakotas, Minnesota and Wisconsin ­have 124 electoral votes out of 270 needed to become president. 
Indiana Hepublican Chairman Murray Clark said the conference, held once every two years, energizes the party faithful and sharp­ens their focus on the next election. It takes on added importance this year, he said, because there are so many Republican presidential "wannabes" heading into the nominating season. 
He said he was surprised that more GOP contenders weren't attending. 
Among the absentees are former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Arizona Sen. John McCain. Giuliani spent part of this week in California and will be in the early primary state of New Hampshire on Saturday, his campaign said. 
McCain, whose campaign has been limping, was on vacation in the Bahamas this week. He was preparing for a speech to the National Guard in Puerto Rico on Monday, a campaign spokeswoman said. 
Robert Schmuhl, a profes­sor of American studies at the University of Notre Dame, expects the three who are coming to speak on a wide range of issues. 
"In some of the states, the socialist views resonate more deeply and in others econom­ic concerns are at the fore­front, so this convention real­ly allows the candidates to present themselves in a broader way," Schmuhl said. 
He said the event could especially benefit Thompson, the "Law & Order" actor and former Tennessee senator. He is expected to officially enter the race next month and has polled well in national sur­veys. But some have suggest­ed that he is starting too late, and he has offered few specifics on what he would do as president. 

"If he is trying to build his following, it is important to get his message to as many people and as many states right now," Schmuhl said. 
Homney comes to the con­vention having easily won Iowa's high-profile Republican Party Straw Poll earlier this month, getting twice as many votes as Huckabee, who came in sec­ond. Homney was expected to win because he had spent months and millions of dol­lars on the effort. 
Huckabee said his showing was impressive because he had little money to spend. Giuliani, Thompson and McCain skipped the event. 
A national Gallup poll taken Aug. 13-16 showed Romney trailing front-runner Giuliani and Thompson, but he has led in recent polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, which traditionally have kicked off the nomination process. He also topped the GOP field in fundraising during the first six months of the year with $35 million.

County officials weary of getting blame for tax woes

DUNLAP, Ind. Commissionnrs from five Indiana countiHS grappling with high property taxns say they'rH tired of Gov. Mitch Daniels blaming the problem on local govern­ment officials.

LaGrange Commissioner Phillip Curtis said he was upset that local govern­ments are not on a blue­ribbon commission appointHd by Daniels to make recommendations about streamlining local governments.

The new statement rec­ommends that funding for schools, welfare and juve­nile detention services be removed from property tax levies and made a state responsibility, but omits a reference to a specific tax increase. 
"These programs and services should instead be funded with a combination of increases in state corpo­rate and personal income taxes, and state sales tax," the statement reads. 
Co111111ission pledges study of local govenunent 
Reform panel to conduct analysis oflocal services 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Leaders of a 
panel on local government reform 
pledged Wednesday to conduct a 
comprehensive study of how local 
services are decided, provided and 
paid for in hopes of fmding ways to 
make them more efficient, effective 
and cheaper. 
Former Democratic Gov. Joe Kernan and Chief Justice Randall Shepard, co-chairmen of the Indiana Commission on Local Government Reform, told reporters after a first private meeting that steep increases in property taxes this year should pave the way for meaningful recom­mendations for reforming local gov­ernment. 
"This is a period in which citizens are more focused on what it is their government is doing and how it is doing it," Shepard said. "You hope out of the level of interest and in some places anger has generated the impe­tus for reforms that wouldn't occur if everybody were sitting around under very ordinary, sort of ho-hum circum­stances." 
The property tax increases and local government's reliance on those taxes was a key reason Gov. Mitch Daniels recently created the seven­member panel. Daniels, a Republican, has said for its size and population, Indiana has far too much local gov­ernment. 
About 2,730 local units have authority to levy property taxes, with only nine states having more, accord­ing to the Daniels administration. To govern all these units, Indiana elects nearly 11,000 officials, ineluding 1,100 with responsibility for property tax assessment. 
The commission, which i'> staffed by the Center for Urban Policy and the Environment at Indiana University­Purdue University at Indianapolis, will try to determine what local govern­ment offices could be eliminated to achieve efficiencies and cost savings. Daniels wants to know specifically whether township and eounty proper­ty tax assessors should be abolished in favor or a uniform process run by the state. 
The governor also wants to know what local government units, includ­ing schools and libraries, could be consolidated to reduce overhead and administrative expenses, and what constitutional, statutory or adminis­trative changes are necessary to achieve significant refiJrms. 
Daniels want'> reeommendations by the end of the year so they can be considered during the 2008 lngL'llatiwl session or beyond. A separate eom­mission of lawmakers and out'lide tax experl<; i'i studying ways of providing property tax relief and reform, and the two panels are expected to share information in the coming weeks. 
The local government commission, primarily through the Urban Policy Center, is expected to spend the next five or six weeks reviewing pmvious data and proposals and having pri­vate interviews with associations that represent local units and officials such as counties, cities and towns, schools and a<;sessors. 
Farmers harvest early to avoid losses 
Corn planters anticipate stornzy weather, gather crops in advance 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS-Some Corn Belt farmers are starting har­vests weeks early, worried that stormy weather now could cause damage lo corn plants already suffering from a dry, hot summer. 
"If we start getting a lot of wnt wnather with the wind, it could cause these stress11d plants to fall ovnr," said Handy Grennwell, a farmer who has started harvesting his 7,500 aerns ol' 1:orn in Union County, Ky. "You have the potential of a lot of loss." 
The long string of hot days has pushnd corn growth about a wnek ahnad of the average time, so harvest will be a little narlier this year for much of t.hn country, said Chris Hurt, an agricultural economist at Purdue University. 
Grnnnwnll. who has about I 0 pnrcnnt of his corn crop har­vestlld so far, said Wednesday hn would typically be starting thn harvnst in a few w1~nks. Farmers in dry parts of Indiana, Illinois and K1mt.ucky arn starting to harvnst corn, although sonw aro waiting. 
An oarly harvest can come with a price. 
Farmors like Grnenwell must dry out the corn manually sincn it isn't spending as much timn drying on cornstalks. c;reenwell says it costs him about $35 an acre in energy costs or more than $250,000 total -to dry corn. But he's willing to pay rather than worry about even bigger possible losses. 
"It outweighs tlw loss poten­ti<tl," he said. 
Corn plants can stop growing because of stress from sum­mnr heat and drought condi­tions, said Roger Elmore, an Iowa State University corn specialist. Some farmers in the 

driest part of Iowa have con­sidered an early harvest, but most of the state's farmers plan to wait. 
"We've got another few weeks to go," he said.

The simple lie 
For 18 years, many people-probably friends are the majority-have fed you a lie. Perpetuated primarily by the young, the falsehood inflicts indiscrimi­nately. Its strength is its simplicity: You can't change the world, you can't shape the future, you can't make a dif­ference. 
But if you failed to detect the untruths in simple arguments, you wouldn't be here today. And if you don't believe you can change the world, Notre Dame isn't the place for you. 

Seven blocks from a four-lane road overlooking the sea of peace and only one from the pathway of posh is a pristine church called St. Monica's in a city by (roughly) the same name. 
Cruising along the Pacific Coast Highway two days before starting a sum­mer internship in Los Angeles, I had mapped out the parish for 5:30 p.m. Mass on a 70-degree Saturday. It was a chance encounter, or so I thought. 
Dressed for success in lacrosse shorts and a T-shirt one size too small, I was the outcast visitor, imposing on a cele­bration with soloists fit for West L.A. and arches that reach for the oh-so-tangible stars. 

Ken Fowler 
Managing Editor 
Then the pastor flipped the switch on the digital projector in lieu of a homily, and sound waves from a familiar voice vibrated in my ear. I peered at the screen, and my eyes did not dare belie my ears. Father Bob Dowd-to me, Professor Dowd-was narrating a 12­minute compilation of still photos with an explanation of the importance of St. Monica's sponsorship of a parish in Kenya. It was a message from a voice, and I'd heard them in conjunction before. It took me a while to be sure, but my hunch that it was Father Bob's voice was right. 
If you're lucky enough to meet Father Bob, you'll never be able to communi­cate fully who he is. To paraphrase what alumni say about Notre Dame, there aren't enough words to explain just how good of a person he is, but once you meet him, there are too many words that come to mind to pass on what you've gained from your relationship. He's the Notre Dame Millennium Development Initiative (NOMOI) director and an assis­tant professor of political science. 
He's been the point man on that proj­ect, which Notre Dame hopes will reju­venate a village and its faith. The millen­nium development goals, pushed forth worldwide by the United Nations, res­onate with him and a lot of faculty on campus. And they want Notre Dame to be a part of making things happen in improving the quality of life worldwide. 
That kind of idealistic thought, that commitment to service, is something 
you'll find prevalent here over the next four years. And even if you stripped 
away the gold flakes adorning the dome, 
the bricks supporting Notre Dame 
Stadium and the mural affixed to the 
Hesburgh library, there's still a lot to 
love about this school. Your task is to 
find those things, and make them even 
more prevalent. 
During the next four years, you'll get to know that Executive Vice President John Aftleck-Graves is the second-most respected person on campus, behind only Father Hesburgh. You'll discover that Charlie Weis' malapropisms -like when he said Rhema McKnight "is kinda like a la David Givens" -can be terribly insightful and awfully hysterical. And you'll realize that there isn't a thing in this world you can't achieve with resolve, passion and faith. 
And there isn't a better place to discov­er that than here.

Make Notre Dame yours 
Besides a general recollection of being nervous, awkward and home­sick, I have a very vivid memory of Freshman Orientation. 
We were having small-group chats in the basement of Farley Hall, where nervous freshmen were supposed to share their most embarrassing moments or, if they could be a fruit, which they would choose. 
I had never had a beer, a boyfriend or a bunk bed, and day one at Notre Dame had been over­whelming, at best. I was supposed to be loving it here, but I was friendless and unsettled. This was supposed to be the time of my life? 
So, instead of adding to our fantastic frosh-o discussion, I pulled my knees to my chest, stared at the ground and silently decided right then I was going home. 
I would pack up my things and drive back with my parents when they left the next day. 
Maybe college just wasn't for me. 
I think I lost my resolve to leave somewhere between DomerFest and a campus scavenger hunt, and when it came time for goodbyes, I knew I'd

have to say them. 
My RA nudged me off to play slip and slide Twister with Knott Hall as my parents snuck away in our emptied mini-van on Sunday. I think I cried in a bathroom stall. 
If only I had known what awaited me. 
But that's what being a freshman is all about. It's about not knowing -and finding your way in spite of it. 
If you're like me when I was a fresh­man, you're probably reading this while peering over a bowl of Cheerios in North Dining Hall, sitting next to and across from new "friends" who were strangers 12 hours ago. 
Granted, most of you stellar-than­ever students are loving it here, but for those of you who are still unsure, have a little faith. I was in your shoes, and I made it through. You will, too. It can be hard at first, and then it's easier, and easier, and pretty soon, you'll never want to leave this place. 
Maybe it's Mary. Maybe it's magic. But Notre Dame does that to you. My uncle, a 1971 Notre Dame alum­nus, might have put it best. 
During dinner at my grandmother's house in South Bend last week, the conversation shifted to the University, as it tends to do in a family that oozes Notre Dame. Uncle Jack sighed, shook his head and said: "Gosh, you know, if I could go back, I would squeeze every last drop out of that campus." Maybe kids these days are too young to appre­ciate college, another uncle added. By the time they realize how many oppor­tunities they had, they're in cap and gown. 
Don't let that be you. Make Notre Dame yours. Whether you're a fourth­generation Domer or the student who came here on a dream and a prayer from Oregon, you belong here. Find where you fit, and then go leave your mark. 
The truth is, I still feel like a fresh­man. Not in that homesick-awkward­scared sense, but because Notre Dame still feels new. 
Three years here and, even though I've walked well-worn paths, ate hun­dreds of dining hall meals, and cheered my heart out at many football games, Notre Dame has never lost its luster. 
And that's how I hope it stays forev­er. Life is better when it feels like it's just beginning, and you really are at the starting line.

Socratic wisdom 
Some things change with every freshman class. 
Statistics improve. Every year it will be smarter, more accomplished, and better at making college applications than its predeces-· sors. 
The obvious tran­sitions are made -­it will be composed of a different amount of different individuals who will go on to interact in new and distinct ways with their peers and profes­sors. 
Policies change -­each year, the incoming freshmen will experience greater drinking restrictions and penalties than the preceding class (in the form of new University regula­tions, more thorough police enforce­ment, or the rising opportunity cost of college drinking generated by the superinflationary increase of tuition prices). 
Some things don't change. 
Whatever the brightness statistics, the average entering class will always think it's pretty damned special to be 

Joey King 
Viewpoint Editor 

here, and with good reason. Admission is becoming more difficult everywhere. They don't go to Directional State U. and they're proud of it. As a freshman, answering "I go to Notre Dame" is impossible to do without pride sliding just a little into arrogance. And, for all the regulating, Keystone Light will continue to have a market outside of America's trailer parks. 
I want to focus here on the arro­gance, since it's most pronounced for freshmen. A major part of your college education will be learning just what exactly you know and don't know, and you're four years behind on it, coming right out of the place where you did know everything. 
I'm not trying to preach modesty here. This arrogance--which is so definitive of the freshman class --is exactly what helps you to try new things and fully explore your new­found independence. If anything, it should be amplified. Just about every­thing that happens to you on the weekends here won't happen with such regularity after college, and never in the same way. But the experi­ence will make up a huge part of the people you become when you leave here. 
But back to learning what you know and don't know. Don't channel any arrogance into assuming you know what comes best from experience. Instead, appreciate the experience you lack and fix it as fast as possible. Put all your pride-inspired confidence into your weekend shenanigans and other enlightening antics. 
Most importantly, do not write let­ters to the editor that highlight your experience deficit. Writing a vitriolic letter is usually a good way to tell peo­ple you don't really know what you're talking about. Anyone well-versed in an editorial subject will recognize the ambiguity of the question that made it worth debating in the first place, 'instead of casting aspersions at the grammar of previous letters. It makes you look like an idiot, and it makes me look like an idiot for publishing it if nothing better comes in. 
However evil you find birth control, abortion, or the Keenan Revue, no one will respect your post-high school opinion if you devolve into ranting. It's too obvious you haven't properly examined the question. 
But is it okay to devolve into verbal ranting over a generous (perhaps too generous) share of Natty Light on a Wednesday? 
Yes. When you're in college. And only when you recognize that this is only one amid a limitless list of experi­ence-building options, and one where you aren't making other people read its haphazard arrangement in the pages of The Observer the next day. 
The main discrepancy I want to highlight here is experience versus assumed wisdom. Bad letters to the editor are only one highly tangible example of this, and the one that I've become most familiar with. Please don't assume that drinking Natural Light is the recommended path to wis­dom through experience, even if alco­hol can accelerate the Socratic real­ization that you know nothing. Just chase experience for its own sake. 
But keep in mind that such a Socratic acceleration can't really be a bad thing.

All in the family 
My mother went to Saint Mary's. My dad went to Notre Dame. I am a true legacy and I am proud of that. However, when I applied to Saint Mary's, I did so with the intention of not going. I wanted to be different. I Katie Kohler 
wanted to stay out east. I wanted to go Saint Mary's to college with my Editor friends. But I did-n't. I am here and it was the best decision I have ever made. 
I did not send in my confirmation to Saint Mary's until April 30. (It was due May 1.) Talk about cutting it close. I was going to Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. I had a friend going there, it was five hours away and it was a great school. 
During the application process, I visited all the schools I applied to, except Saint Mary's. I had seen it a million times, from every angle --or so I thought. It wasn't until I visited over AnTostal weekend that I proved myself wrong. For the first time in my life, I saw South Bend in a new light. I saw what drew my mom, my seven aunts and my three cousins here, And now I saw that it drew me here too, 
It's so hard to explain how you "just know." For everyone, it is different. Sometimes, you don't know if it's the right place for you until after you get there. It could be that first English class, the first football game, or the beloved DomerFest. For me, it was when I met Dr. Mooney, the College president, on my last visit to campus. Her enthusiasm about Saint Mary's and her new position and her drive to make it an even better school made it something I wanted to be a part of. 
As I prepare to enter my junior year, I am more excited than ever to do all the things that make Saint Mary's special. I am excited to add to the memories. To stay up all night talking about nothing and eating EZ­Mac. To paint my body in the second row of a Notre Dame football game. To be part of a very special relation­ship between two schools. And to do exactly what I am doing now, address­ing the student body through the newspaper. 
My advice is this: College goes by way too fast. Have fun, but don't for­get to do your work. Stay involved and participate in what you love. You have four years to make something of yourself. And I have no doubt you will do just that as a Belle.

MLB 
Webb eyes second Cy Young 

Associated Press 
PHOENIX -Now that his scoreless streak is over, Brandon Webb is setting his sights on something else: a sec­ond straight Cy Young Award. 
Webb's string ended at 42 innings Wednesday night when he gave up a run in the first against Milwaukee. He went on to pitch the NL West-leading Arizona Diamondbacks to a 3-2 win. 
"I finished up pretty strong last year, and I feel pretty strong right now," Webb said. ''I'd say it's pretty comparable." 
Webb was nowhere near Cy Young contention when he dropped three straight deci­sions to fall to 8-8 on July 20. But the 28-year-old righty has won six straight starts ­including three complete-game shutouts -and has helped carry the surprising young Diamondbacks. 
"Since then, he's taken oft' and been the horse that we expect him to be," Arizona manager Bob Melvin said. 
Webb's 191 2-3 innings are most in the majors. He has three shutouts, and no other National Leaguer has more than one. 
Webb's 2.63 EHA is fourth in the NL, behind Chris Young's 2.12, Jake Peavy's 2.21 and Brad Penny's 2.59. 
Webb has 166 strikeouts. Only Peavy, with 186. has more in the NL. 
"The numbers will show right now, especially here recently, 
CLASSIFIEDS 
that he's been about as good as he's ever been in his career," Melvin said. 
"We've had some success this year, and we don't have it with­out him. We didn't give him much run support early on in the season," he said. 
Young has been viewed as the Cy Young favorite since midsea­son. But he left the Padres on Wednesday to have his sore back examined, and that may throw the race open. 
As Webb closed in on Orel Hershiser's major league record of 59 scoreless innings, set in 1988, the Arizona ace's name popped up in more Cy Young debates. 
"I don't know if it's the streak. The scoreless innings obviously brought my ERA down a ton (from 3.38 to 2.63). But the wins that come with it have also helped out a lot in that regard, I would think," he said. 
Melvin, then with San Francisco, homered against Hershiser shortly before he embarked on that 59-inning streak in 1988. 
"There's so many easy ways for a run to get on the board. It takes some luck. But it also takes a lot of skill. And his skill through 42 innings was like nothing I've ever seen before," he said. 
Milwaukee manager Ned Yost said Webb had to overcome more than the opposing lineups. 
"[The media is] hammering you about the streak, what about the streak?" he said. "If they would just leave him alone 

and let him go out and pitch 
this game, he'd stand a lot bet­
ter chance of doing it, but 
nobody wants to do that stuff 
anymore." 
Webb generally seems immune to pressure. He is a laid-back Kentuckian who wears flip-flops and relaxes by playing the guitar in front of his locker stall. But he acknowl­edged that he was relieved when the streak ended. 
"The attention that it got, every day coming in and having to deal with it _ for it to be over, I can kind of take a deep breath and be like, 'Good, let's just go win some ballgames, "' he said. 
Webb's demeanor didn't change after he won the Cy Young Award last year. But his repertoire did. 
He came to spring training ready to develop his changeup, which has become a nasty com­plement to his trademark sinker. 
"I think that's what's made him who he is right now," Melvin said. "Now, his sinker's as good as we've seen it all year, but at times this year he has struggled with the com­mand of it, and his secondary pitches have enabled him to continue being a successful guy." 
Webb has come a long way since 2004, when the Diamondbacks lost 111 games and he led the league with 16 defeats, 119 walks and 17 wild pitches. Back then, Webb seem­ingly tried to strike out every hitter because he didn't trust his fielders. 
His approach changed in 2005, when the Diamondbacks shored up their middle infield with Craig Counsell and Royce Clayton. Webb began throwing more strikes with his sinker, allowing batters to pound the ball into the dirt. 
When Webb agreed to a $19.5 million, four-year contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks in January 2006, he knew he had accepted more than money and security. He also accepted the responsibility of being Arizona's top starter. 
"I think he was ready to step up in the fashion that he did, and he ends up winning the Cy Young," Melvin said. 
Now Webb may make it two in a row. 
"Stuff-wise, I'm right where I want to be," Webb said. "I feel pretty good. I would say it's up there with the tops where I've felt in my career, being able to locate as well as I have."

emphasis on special teams.That leg Sepulveda is giving the Steelers is making them look wise with that money, too. 
It was only a preseason game but, given that the kicking game is the one aspect of the preseason that most mimics that of the regu­lar season, the Steelers were delighted with Sepulveda's 
50-yard  average  on  four  
punts  Saturday  against  
Washington.  

The Baylor rookie punter was their standout during a dreary first half of a game the Steelers would win 12-10 on three field goals in the fourth quarter. The Steelers have devoted more time to the kicking game under Tomlin than with any previ­ous coach. 
"I think it's great they're putting so much emphasis on special teams," Sepulveda said, referring to the numer­ous morning practices devot­ed to them during camp. 
The Steelers ended last season convinced that they needed an upgrade at punter, even though the long-reliable Chris Gardocki -their regu­lar for three seasons -has never had any of his 1,1 77 punts blocked. 
However, Pittsburgh was only 28th in the league in punting average (41.3) last season, and 19th in net aver­age (36. 7 yards). 
Sepulveda gives the Steelers some added dimen­
younger 
Sepulveda went on to become the first two­time winner of the Ray Guy award presented to the col­lege football's top punter, averaging 46.5 yards last season. 
After the draft, Sepulveda discovered pretty quickly that Pittsburgh is a football-inten­sive place to be. There, he was reminded constantly of how he hit a 51-yard punt against North Texas several years ago, then went down­field and leveled the punt returner with a big hit. 
Sepulveda thought the play was long since forgotten, only to learn numerous Steelers fans had watched it online. 
"That's pretty cool, that they're talking about a punter even before they've seen him play," he said. 
Sepulveda also has been asked repeatedly about his ability to kick the "Aussie roll" -a type of punt that, when landing inside a 20, doesn't bound toward the end zone but backspins and remains in play. The idea is to get the ball to rotate back­ward like a kickoff, rather than spiraling like most punts do, by kicking it on its end. 
After watching Cowboys punter Mat McBriar employ the roll, Sepulveda was determined to learn it him­self. The kick gets its name from Australian football, where the tactic is heavily used.

A year older, a year better. 
At least that's what coaches Joe Piane and Tim Connelly hope their teams display this season. Both the men and women return a strong group of runners from teams that first at the NCC and fifth at the Great Lakes Regional.

"There's two kids [Paul Springer and Dan Jackson] who I think who could step in and help us and the rest of our kids can help us down the road," Piane. "In terms of cross-country, it's a very good class." 
Senior Sunni Olding will anchor a group of runners that developed last year and improved as the season went along. The women placed might be very good. We have our whole team back from last year plus we've got a handful of freshmen coming in that have the potential to contribute." 
Meanwhile, the incoming freshmen class can develop behind the experienced group of upperclassmen. 
"There's a pretty good group there that has the potential to come in and con­tribute, but at the same time there also a good group returning that kind of used last season as a start and built on that in the track sea­son," Connelly said.

The Notre Dame women will begin the 2007 season with high expectations. 
The 2006-07 team, which fin­ished 28-4, featured only two seniors in twins Catrina and Christian Thompson. While their departure vacates the top two singles and No. 1 doubles positions, the 2007-08 Irish welcome back integral players from last year's team, and have added even more talent to their roster. 
"They were so good for us for four years, it's a big spot to replace, but I think that we have a lot of returning players that played well at lower posi­tions and can step up," coach Jay Louderback said. 
Leading the charge of new, young talent coming to the team is freshman Kristin Rafael, one of the top high school players in the country last year. 
"She is a great competitor," Louderback said. "I think dou­bles-wise she should help us and I think [her playing] singles will play a big part." 
The biggest hurdle for the Irish will be figuring out who has improved over the summer and made the necessary leaps needed to step up and play at a higher level. With all of their returning talent, it could get crowded at the top. 
The top candidate for the No. 1 singles position could be

"I think that those [senior] losses will be very significant, but when you have freshmen and even returning players who did not play you have a ton of enthusi­asm, so I think we'll be a very spirited and hard-working team and I expect us to be very tough in the top part of our line up." 
The Irish are not without vet­eran leadership, however, as they return such standouts as Sheeva Parbhu, Andrew Ross and Brett Helgeson. Parbhu is expected to fill the "big shoes" of Bass this

The Notre Dame golf pro­gram received a vote of confi­dence before the start of the fall season. 
The September issue of Golf Digest ranked the men's team No. 9 and the women's team No. 11 in a poll of top U.S. col­legiate golf programs. 
The poll awarded rankings in three categories: golf, academ­ics and a combination of both, the last known as the "bal­anced rankings." 
The balanced category also took into account the facilities, coaches, climate, player growth, team adjusted scoring average and academics, and it was here that the Irish earned the highest

There were some schools in there that we're much better· than that were ranked right there with us." 
Recruiting takes off 
Whether it's the facilities or the results, recruits have noticed. The two incoming freshmen on the women's team, So-llyun Park from Seoul, South Korea and Katie Conway from Wading Hiver, N.J., make up the highest­ranked recruiting class --for the men or women --Notre Dame golf' has ever seen. 
"We're expecting them to be in the top five from day one. So-llyun is ranked in the top 20 [nationally). Katie's ranked in the top 40," Holt said. "We have two verbal commitments already for 2008, so we're excited about 

from there to where we appeared in this year's edition is certainly a testament I think, more than anything, to the quality of recruits that we've got coming into the program and our facilities." 
The men's team was No. 14 in the academic rankings and No. 35 in the golf-only catego­ry. The women were No. 10 in the academic rankings and No. 21 in the golf-only section. 
The South Bend climate, inhospitable to golfers for much of the year, dropped Notre Dame's rankings slightly, but men's coach Jim Kubinski said even that was becoming less of an obstacle. 
"This year we have two kids from California and one from Florida, so we're getting kids from all sorts of weather cli­mates that maybe we didn't have in the past," he said. 
Both Holt and Kubinski said the highly ranked Warren Golf Course --designed in part by two-time Masters champion Ben Crenshaw --and the statn­of-the-art Holl's indoor practice facility contributed signilkantly to the high rankings. Both also cited the increased funding available since 2000. when golf became a full scholarship sport. 
Nothing gets the attention of recruits like success, however. 
"We've had a number of good wins, the last couple years especially, and I think recruits are starting to take notice," Kubinski said. 
Holt believed the poll to be an accurate representation of the program. Kubinski agreed, but said the team adjusted scoring average was poorly calculated. 
"When you play a very diffi­cult golf course like Purdue or good shape for the fall season. 
"[Sophomore! Annie Brophy had a breakout spring. She really stepped up," Holt said. ''I'd like to sec her pick up where she left off. !Junior Lisa Maunu's] a really experieneed player, but last year she had some setbacks and some injuries, so that was really frustrating for her." 
Maunu rebounded from injuries sull'ered last season to compete on the Canadian national team and travel over­seas to play this summer. 
The men, who also finished second behind Louisville in last year's Big East tournament, have a strong freshmen class as well. Dustin Zhang from Calgary, Alberta, Tyler Hock from Ocala, Fla., Jeffery Chen from Walnut, Calif., and Connor Alan-Lee from Solana Beach, Calif., may all crack the start­ing lineup at some point in the season. 
"In the three, four and l'ivn [lineup! spots, we weren't get­ting a number of good scores. We were very ineonsistPnt," Kubinski said. "This year, hav­ing anoth1~r four players to draw from, I think we're going to be a much more consistent tnam from Ispots I one through nve in the lineup instnad of .i ust being top-heavy." 
Kubinski mentioned senior Greg Hodgers, who shot a 69 in lhe final round of the Big East hampionship last year, as a breakout candidate. Arter a good freshman fall, junior Josh Sandman missed his freshman spring due to injury and had a bit of a slump last year. 
"lie played well, but he didn't play well for Josh," Kubinski said. "I think this will be a real bounce-back year. lie could be

PPtnrs, a (>-ft)()t-2 li>rward from (:h icago 's Fnnwick II igh Sehool, W<L'i thn highest-rankml player tho Irish landed. She was a Mcl>onalds AII-Ameriean and a throe-time Street & Smith's All­American honorabh~ rmmtion. 
"Peters is someone who can rnally rebound," McCraw said. "She can block shots. That was something we lacknd last year, was a shot blocker. She runs the floor extremely well, so she's going to help our press." 
Peters will also help lill the void in the defense and rebounding department creatod by the gradu­ations of Brnona Gray and Crystal Erwin. 
In addition to being named to the all-Illinois second team by the Chicago Tribune, Pnters was awardnd all-eonfimmcn honors in 2005 and 2006. 
Mallory brings a dill"1mmt skill set. 
"Wn worn not a very good thrne­point shooting team, and I think that !Mallory! is a very good thrne­point shooter," McGraw said of the 5-foot-lO guard from MeDonogh School in Baltimore, Md. "I thil1k she'll bP a real asset for us just bemuse of hnr ability to do, really, what we struggled with last year." 
Mallory averaged 20.1 points and 7.8 rnbounds per game in her senior ymtr, when McDonogh went 2:H>. 
Bruszewksi, a 6-foot-1 forward from Wheeler High School in Valparaiso, Ind., spent her senior year recovering from an ACL injury but was still high on McGraw's list. 
"She's somnone who we feel tits in really well with our offense becausn she can handle the ball, she can shoot thn throB, she can rnbound," MeGraw said. "She's someone who we think can post up smaller guards and use her size to her advm1tage." 
Dnspite the talHnt these fresh­men bring, they will have trouble earning playing time. The Irish return seven veterans, including junior Lindsay Schroeder, who missed last season with a knee injury. 

"Initially, it will bn a good situa­tion for them because there won't be a lot of pressure on them," McGraw said. "It will be rnally a chance for them to grow, llmrn the system, and till in." 
McGraw said that thH eight-man rotation of last year's team was one body short, and the team will likely utilize a nine-man rotation this year. 
One of those eight, sophomore guard Melissa Lechlitner, compet­ed with the gold-medal-winning 
U.S. under-19 team in the World Championships in Bratislava, Slovakia. 
"I think it's going to do great things for her leadership and con­fidenee, not that she needPd it ­she's very confident," MeGraw said. 
While Lcchlitner was looked upon as a leader rather than a seorer on the under-19 team, McGraw hopes she can return to putting points on the board for the Irish. 
Perimeter defense, the bane of Notre Dame's defensive play last season, will be the foeal point of preseason practice. 
"We gave up way too many threes. That is a huge problem that we've got to fix," McGraw said. ''I'm hoping the veterans are a little more determined to be bet­ter defensively."

With K-Mac back on court, Irish look to reload 


Suspended guard, lofty expectations return to Brey's team 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Editor 
Despite graduating its two leading scorers -guards Colin Falls and Russell Carter -Notre Dame retains a strong nucleus of talent and experience headed into the 2007-08 season. 
Mike Brey, 2007 Big East coach of the year, will look to juniors Kyle McAlarney and Ryan Ayers to fill the gaps in the lineup left by Falls and Carter. 
McAlarney returns to Notre Dame's starting lineup after sit­ting out most of last season. The University suspended the sopho­more after he was arrested last December for marijuana posses­sion. 
Before his suspension, McAlarney averaged 10.3 points

and 5.4 assists per game. He is poised for a breakout year in the Big East. 
"Here's a young man who has absolutely accepted responsibility and learned from a mistake and is honored to be back, thrilled to be back with his teammates. He did a fabulous job leading as soon as he got back," Brey said. "He's very hungry to get back on the court and be part of this and he's done a great job coming right in and his teammates love having him back. There's a toughness and an edge about Kyle that helps our team toughness." 
Ayers was mostly a spot-up shooter off the bench last season, but this season, Brey hopes he can gain the confidence to use his 6-foot-7 frame to create more shots inside 3-point line. So far, Brey likes what he sees from Ayers in his summer workouts. 
"We're excited and enthused about him stepping in to a Carter or Falls kind of role and being able to be a shot maker for us and do other things too, and he did that last year," Brey said. "His eyes are on the door swinging open with Carter leaving and jumping on that. He's done every­thing this summer to solidifY that in my mind." 
Senior Rob Kurz and sopho­more Luke Harangody will com­prise the Irish frontcourt for the second year in a row. Harangody averaged 11.2 points and 6.2 rebounds per game and earned a starting spot thanks to his hard­nosed style of play around the basket. 
Kurz, the lone senior on the team this season, averaged 12.6 points and eight rebounds, but his role this season will extend beyond the court. 
"Rob did a fabulous job leading and running the pickup games, and you know Rob is that work­horse that's going to be there every day leading the team," Brey said. 
Sophomore Tory Jackson will round out the starting lineup. Jackson entered the lineup after McAlarney's suspension and 
played solid defense from the start. As the season progressed, he grew into a major offensive threat due to his ability to get to the basket off the dribble. 
Off the bench, junior Zach Hillesland will lend versatility with his size, quickness and bas­ketball smarts, junior Luke Zeller, the tallest player on the team, continues to develop, while soph­omore Jonathan Peoples will back up Jackson and McAlarney. 
Fighting for spots with the bat­tle-tested veterans will be four freshmen who bring a variety of options to the table. So far, their biggest impact has been to push the team harder. 
"1 think what was impressive about them as a group, the eight veteran guys that they're joining are pretty intense, hard-working, business-like guys, and they did­n't pull those eight back," Brey said. "They added to them and I congratulated them for that, that they added to that." 
Brey said he did not know whether any freshmen will be red-shirted or which players would see what amount of time come November, but he likes what they add to the team. 
Carleton Scott brings some depth in the post, and Brey said his long wingspan should help in rebounding and grabbing loose balls. 
Tim Abromaitis spent his sen­ior year of high school and sum­mer workouts putting on more than 20 pounds of muscle, Brey said. 
"He's in good shape. He can shoot the ball, so that makes him interesting because we lost two real good shot makers," Brey said. "Anytime you're a shot maker I think there could be an opportunity given what we lost." 
Ty Proffitt will contribute some versatility to the guard position, with his ability to play point or off the ball, while Tyrone Nash could see some minutes, thanks to his 6-foot-8 frame and knowledge of the game. 
"Nash is probably the most physically ready to go because he went to a year of prep school, and he's already got Big East strength which really helps hin1." Brey said. "I don't know what position he is -he's just a good basketball player. When you're a versatile guy like that and you're physically ready. you make your­self valuable early as a fresh­man."

"It was huge what !Greg Dalby! brought to our program, and most impressive of all was just that hn was a great per­son." Clark said. "lie did so rn ueh for us -both on and oil' the field -and I don't think I've nvnr hnard anyone say a bad word about Greg Dalby. That won't be easy to replaen." 
Who will bn assigned the unenviable task or filling Dalby's dnats is still up in the air. but Clark has a plethora of options. Heturning starters Miehanl Thomas, Cory Hellas, and Alnx Yoshinaga are all pos­sibilities, but Clark is consider­ing all thnw at ollwr positions. Tho wildcard is freshman Matt Armstrong, a high school AII­Amnriean, who has impressed in preseason practiee. 
"Armstrong. judging by pre­season. looks like a very strong player," Clark said. "lie has all the tools to play, and I don't know if' there arn many better f'rnshmen central midfieldors than him in tho country." 
Dnl'nnsive center midfieldnr isn't tlw only vacancy lel't behind by graduating seniors. With the graduations of' Dalby and eon tral de f'n ndor Dale Hellas. Notre Dame will bn without tlwir co-captains from tho past two seasons. and Clark will bn forced to replace what lw called vc~ry good lead­ership. 
"That's thn big unknown," Clark said or this year's loader­ship. "Whiln the nnw captains I Hyan Miller, Matt Besler and Yoshinagal have dono evnry­thing asked or thnm so far, you won't really know how it will go until you hit some road bumps." 
While Notre Dame is sur­rounded by questions for this upcoming season, they will have onn dnlinitive answnr up front. Josnph Lapira will once again line up at forward this season. and so will his 32 career goals, 13 career assists and llormann Trophy. 
After spending the summer training with European clubs Derby County (English Premier League), Glasgow Hangers (Scottish Premier League) and a stint with the Irish national team, Lapira could be set to improve on last year's record­breaking season -at least according to Clark. 
"Those experiences have been fantastic, and I expect Joe to be a bettf~r all-around player this year," Clark said. "I don't care if he scores 22 goals again. as long as thn team is seoring goals, but I expect him to be a better player." 
The No. 11 Irish won't have to wait long to find out whether their raised expectations for this season will be met. Their first four opponents, including the two preseason games, are all ranked in the top 20, and Notre Dame's first six games will match the Irish against top-30 squads. 
"I think we'll be in good shape, and we'll lind out pretty early," Clark said. "That's the way we want it to be."

win this year? I think I have an ethical responsibility to all those nine guys that came back. They all graduated; it isn't like they're coming back to graduate. They all graduat­ed. They all came back to win this year. I owe it to those nine guys to try to win now." 
Offensive positions up for grabs 
With so many starters departing, nearly every posi­tion on the field is open for competition. 
The most important starting race is at quarterback, where Quinn's departure leaves the Irish with three quarterbacks who have thrown a combined total of two collegiate passes. 
.I unior Evan Sharpley is the veteran of the group, having thrown both of those passes and having been Quinn's back­up in 2006. Sophomore Demetrius Jones, the most ver­satile of the three, brings on added dimension with his speed. He had a 31-yard run in the spring game and threw the contest's only touchdown pass, but he also threw an intercep­tion. 
Freshman Jimmy Clausen, who enrolled in January and was the No. 1 high school quarterback in the nation, throws the best out of the three but had a procedure on his elbow over the summer. Still, Weis said he would be ready to start the opener against Georgia Tech on Sept. 1 if he earned the job. 
"The best thing about the competition is that everyone has different strengths and weaknesses," Jones said. "The head coach's job is do decide whose strengths we can best take advantage of." 
To catch passes from the three signal callers, the Irish have a mix and experience and inexperience. 
The good news for Notre Dame is that fifth-year senior tight end John Carlson is back after catching 4 7 passes for 634 yards and four touchdowns in 2006 despite missing two games with an injury. Junior wide receiver David Grimes also returns after catching 26 passes for 336 yards and 2 touchdowns as Notre Dame's third wide out last year. 
But after those two, the returning players have just three catches for 21 yards between them. A host of wide receivers, including junior D. J. Hord, sophomores George West, Richard Jackson, Robby Parris and Barry Gallup, and freshmen Golden Tate and Duval Kamara, are all looking to get on the field this season. 
Weis has said West has the edge as the No. 2 receiver, but only by a small margin. 
At running back, five players are competing for playing time. 
Fifth-year senior Travis Thomas, who spent his first three years as a running back and was a starting linebacker last season, probably will start against Georgia Tech. He had 13 rushes for 78 yards and two touchdowns in limited offensive attempts last season. In 2005, backing up Walker, he ran 63 times for 248 yards and five touchdowns. 
The only other back with experience is sophomore James Aldridge, who rushed for 142 yards on 37 carries as a reserve last season. 
Senior Junior Jabbie, a con­verted defensive back, rushed for 8 7 yards on 13 carries in the spring game and earned offensive MVP honors. 
Freshman Robert Hughes is a bruising back, and his class­mate Armando Allen might be the fastest of the five. 
Although he is the presumptive uncertain, with junior Mike Turkovich and sophomores Dan Wenger, Eric Olsen and Matt Carufel competing for starting positions. 

Defense sees a complete overhaul 
After allowing 24.1 points per game over the last two sea­sons under coordinators Rick Minter, Notre Dame's defensive corps will turn to former New York Jets assistant Corwin Brown to try to shed its sieve­like reputation. 
Brown, who was the defen­sive backs coach for the Jets for three seasons and before that was an assistant at Virginia under head coach Al Groh, brings something close to what is known as a "3-4" defense. The formation, which features three down linemen and four linebackers, is rare in college football and is designed to create maximum confusion with blitzers from all angles.

Veterans return for shot at title 
By DAN MURPHY Associate Sports Editor 
Last season, Notre Dame came three points away from capturing the Big East championship. This time around the Irish have a new look and are the preseason favorites to win it all. 
Four talented freshmen join the squad this year despite losing only one sen­ior to graduation in 2007. Stephanie Slatt, Kellic Sciacca, Angela Puente and Mngan Dunne are expected to use their speed to con­tribute right out of the gates. 
"They're all working really hard and making good progress, Irish coach l)(~bbie Brown said. "They have a grnat work nthie and the senior leadership has really set the tonn for that." 
Co-captains Adrianna Stasiuk and Ashley Tarutis are Notre Dame's only sen­iors this season, but bring an abundance of talent and experiencn to the table. Both players have been starters

By CHRIS KHOREY SportS Editor 
Notre Dame came within one game of a national championship last season. 

But, with th<~ opnning reg­ular season game of the 2007 still a week away, the Irish have already erased the memory or that loss. 
Notre Dame and North Carolina, tied for No. 1 in the preseason coaches poll, played an exhibition match Sunday in a rematch of the 2006 Women's College Cup final. The 2-2 draw, played in soggy conditions, fea­tured much of the same intensity and passion as last year's title game. 
And although his team did not eome away with a win, Irish coach Randy Waldrum was pleased with what he saw. 
"We're very happy with the result, especially since it's the preseason," Waldrum said. "I thought today we had the better opportunities. We fought for every loose ball. It's one of the best games we've played against Carolina since I've been here.

Lofty goals follow historic tourney run

Irish eoach Bobby Clark is nothing if not ambitious. 
One year after enjoying the most successful season in pro­gram history-one that includ­ed Notre Dame's first-ever trip to the quarterfinals of the NCAA Tournament, as well as the pro­gram's first ever Hermann Trophy winner -Clark and his team are raising the expecta­tions. 
"The legacy of the previous teams has been tnrrilic, but the 
· question now is if we ean take it a step furthnr," Clark said. "Every year you try to get a lit­tle bit better, and this squad has the potential to do that." 
Whatever potential this Irish team may have, there remains a gaping hole at defensive cen­ter midfield that will be difficult to replace. For the past four seasons, Clark has been able to pencil Greg Dalby's name into
