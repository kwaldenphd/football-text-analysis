After a week-long approval gap between the Charlie Ebersoi-James Leito ticket and the other three student body presidentiaVvice presidential tickets, all four campaigns have stepped up their publicity efforts. 
As the sprint through the debates and the endorsements begins. the tickets of Adam Istvan and Karla Bell, Ryan Craft and Steve Lynch and Mark Healy and Mike Healy said they were focused on earning recognition from stu­dent voters and were ready to gain ground. 
"I feel like we've done a pret­ty good job compared to the time we got approved," Mark Healy said. "We've got days of campaigning ahead of us -it won't matter when we start­ed."

Lao to address Board of Trustees 
Report details student gov't changes 
By SHEILA FLYNN 
News Writer 
Student body president Jeremy Lao and members of his staff will present a report to the Board of Trustees today, appearing before the Board for the second time this academic year after receiving a criti­cal reception from Board members last fall. 
Student government offi­cers, led by then-president Pat Hallahan, last met with the Board in October. When they presented their report and discussed changes to the CLC, Board members responded fairly critically. They instructed student government to reorganize itself as a body and improve its credibility before asking Board members for assis­tance on various endeavors. 
"What they were saying -what I gather from it ­was, from what we were asking in regard to the CLC changes, they thought were very petty," Lao said of the officers 
The Board members told Hallahan, Lao and the other representatives that they should be more responsible to students, dealing more effectively with issues such as alcohol problems on campus.

EPICS program undergoes major restructuring 
By MERYL GUYER 
News Writer 
Courses that bring engi­neering students closer to the South Bend community and closer to real work experi­ence will undergo major changes in the upcoming months, said Curt Freeland, director of the Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) at Notre Dame. 
The program will disappear from course offerings, though students will still have the opportunity to perform simi­lar service work in engineer­ing and continue to receive credit for it, he said. 
The EPICS courses, a spin-off of Purdue's program by the same name that was developed in 1994, comprise an engineering service learn­ing initiative that matches a group of students with a fac­ulty advisor and a not-for­profit agency in St. Joseph County. Since its inception, the program has grown to include 1,300 students on 10 campuses. 
At Notre Dame, students who wish to participate can come from any college but are asked to commit at least three semesters to their proj­ects in order to provide conti­nuity to the groups that undertake complex issues, thus providing the group with returning members and a mix of younger and older mem­bers. The agency comes to EPICS with a problem the students can solve using engi­neering. 
The problems are diverse, ranging from developing databases for a homelessness prevention network to alter­ing the structure of toys to make the small power switch more accessible to disabled

Revisiting SMC dining 
Well, it's been one year since my last visit to the Saint Mary's dining hall. Some of you may remember that my previous experience with food at our friendly sister college was less than stellar. But, bar­ring food poison­ing, I and my gut arc not ones to carry a grudge. 
I also figured that things may have changed for the better now that the old Noble Family l)ining facility has been reduced to a gaping hole in the ground and replaced by a gleaming new building, also called Noble Family. 
Indeed, I'm pleased to report that my experience at the new Saint Mary's dining hall was significantly better than my last. The food as iL stands isn't great (certainly not worth the trek in subzero tempera­tures, if you choose to walk over as I did). but it's not bad, either. This is good news for me and also my friends at SMC, considering the College has placed a daily cap of 50 on the number of meals that can be exchanged and used at Notre Dame's dining halls. 
On my visit, I had a pita stuffed with meat that I could clearly iden­tify as chicken. The pita came unstuffed -unfortunate for me, but typically not a problem for more competent individuals. I'm convinced that my pita was defec­tive because I co.uld not get it open. Instead, I piled the chicken on top of it and found that it tasted pretty good. 
My only disappointment over last year was with the desserts. Previously, the Saint Mary's dining hall featured gourmet cookies and brownies. Those desserts may still be there, but they've now been condensed into pudding form. 
This "pudding" looks like vomit, but tasted surprisingly better. It contained bits of cake and a lot of what I like to call "mystery prizes." One of my friends found a cherry in hers, and I tasted what I think was part of a chocolate bar and some other things I couldn't identify. Barring the shady factor, it was pretty good. 
They also had a banana split bar that every girl at that College was in line for, so I didn't bother sam­pling it (I should've brought a press pass with me so I could cut in line). 
Friends at Saint Mary's tell me the food hasn't gotten any better than last year. Maybe I just came on the right day. but I thought everything was pretty good overall. 
Finally, I was impressed with the attempt to provide some entertain­ment during the meal. When I went, you could kick a field goal and win a prize. After my prize­filled pudding I opted out, but I appreciated the creative thinking.

The majority of EPICS work is done on the local level. but it also has a nationwide partnership with Habitat for Humanity so now each satellite school running an EPICS program will develop separate projects with Habitat. The projects create an experience that should mirror work experi­en~e in the actual industry while providing a service to the community. 
"!We try to choose] proj­ects that have some meat to the engineering, and we've been trying to ramp that up to make the project more chaffpnging. Then we find a l"aculty member that suits the project," Freeland said. 
One of the reasons Freeland cited for changing ~he l"ormat of the program 1ncludcd the weight on fac­ulty who are not paid for overseeing projects but instead take them on as overload. At the moment l"our l"aculty members coor~ dinatc approximately 70 stu­dents. 
"The program has always been of interest to students, but the demands on faculty are so high that it really takes someone dedicated to service," Freeland said. 
Last year, the EPICS pro­gram asked for more faculty volunteers to facilitate the program, but according to Freeland the response was minimal because faculty are already overextended in teaching and research. Also, the engineering department has taken on several other service projects, and it is beneficial for the depart­ment to focus its energies on fewer programs. Freeland is in support of the structural changes that will be made to the program, but he says the way students earn credit for their work will change since now the courses will be offered through the Center for Social Concerns instead of the College of Engineering. 
"The spirit of EPICS will live on, even it the name docs not," Freeland said.

STUDENT SENATE 

Senators debate student feedback 
By MAUREEN REYNOLDS 
Associate News Editor 
Much of the discussion at Wednesday's Student Senate meeting centered around feed­back from students on several issues. 
Senators attended their dorm council meetings this week to gauge reaction to looking into the language requirement for business students. The discus­sion during the Senate's meet­ing was mixed and centered on the already stringent require­ments in the College of Business. 
Some of the strongest reac­tion came from students who were business majors within the senate. 
"If we want to take a lan­guage, we can," said Keenan senator Dan Zenker, "but ... there are already a lot of requirements. There's no need to make it a requirement." 
Other senators rellected that the business world is growing more international, and a lan­guage requirement would be an asset in the future. 

"I think [a language require­ment] would be great ... but I don't know how feasible it would be," said Cavanaugh senator Jordan Bongiovanni. 
Senators also came to the meeting with their dorms' sug­gestions on how to renovate the first floor lounge of LaFortune. This was in response to the resolution passed by the Senate last week calling for renovation of the space. 
. Among the several sugges­tiOns were more seating, more comfortable couches or a room similar to the study lounge in the renovated library base­ment. 
Keough senator Chuck Anthony reported that his dorm was concerned the lounge should remain a "pres­t~gious place" for the prospec­tiVe students and their families who visit the campus. 
Finally, in line with their con­cern for student feedback, sen­ators unanimously approved a resolution for a "Student Union Senate Suggestion Box." The resolution recognized that the Senate has an e-mail account, ndsenate@nd.edu, that is rarely, if ever, used, and it called for "[the e-mail account] to be made available for the student body at large to submit ideas and opinions to the Student Union Senate." 
In other Senate news: 
+ Senators unanimously approved the subject of student body president Jeremy Lao's report to the Board of Trustees, which takes place today. In a letter from Lao to the Senate, Lao said, " ... the subject of our report will be to give the Board an update of the progress Student Government has made this semester in regards to creating a new structure, Church in Africa involvement and student responsibility. In addition, we will be previewing our Spring Heport on a Student Programming Endowment." 
+ 
Elliot Poindexter submitted a letter to the Senate officially informing them of the four can~idates for student body president and vice president. The letter mentioned that debates between the tickets will take place on Sunday at 7:30p.m. in the llesburgh Library Auditorium. and that the elections will be held Monday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Finally, Poindexter asked in the letter that senators "encourage the members of [their] halls to get involved in the election process." 

+ 
Senators unanimously approved Claire Fadel as the Student Union Treasurer for the 2004-05 term. In his letter of nomination, current treasur­er Don Norton said Fadel "is an extremely qualified, dedi­c~ted and hard-working indi­vidual who has the ambition drive and capacity to success~ fully serve the Student Union." Fadel served as the Assistant Student Union Treasurer dur­ing the 2003-04 term.

campus, where a town bearing the university's name and partially owned by the institution will house 1,500 residents starting that same year. The town of Ave Maria will have the feel of an old European city, complete with a grand central church and plaza and adjoining streets lined with shops, restaurants and cafes. 
"This is the first time someone has planned a new town around a college campus," said Nicholas Healy, a Notre Dame alumnus and president of Ave Maria University.· 
ln the coming years, officials envi­sion Ave Maria growing into a nationally renowned university with an undergraduate population of 5,000 and an NCAA Division 1-A football team like that of its norther­ly neighbor. Emphasizing faith 
They also remain committed to establishing a university with a rep­utation for uphokting the Catholic faith and remaining loyal to the Church's teachings -something critics say today's leading Catholic universities have lost sight of in their efforts to achieve higher status within the academic community. 
A study published in the "Catholic World Report," conducted by the Cardinal Newman Society, for example, surveyed students at 38 Catholic colleges between 1997 and 2001 and concluded that students who graduate from such schools are more inclined to develop pro­choice views and support legalizing gay marriages and less likely to attend Mass then before they start­ed school. 
Ave Maria University hopes to combat such statistics. 
"Our intent is to be a great uni­versity that is capable, in time, of responding to the culture we're in," Healy said. "As Catholics, we need to respond to that from an intellec­tual level." 

Central to Ave Maria's identity is its adherence to Ex Corde Ecclesiae, a document issued by Pope John Paul II in 1990 that requires Catholic institutions of higher learn­ing to remain true to their religious identity and committed to the Church's teachings. The university, for example, requires new theology faculty members to take an oath of fidelity to the Church's magisterium in the presence of a bishop and stu­dents are encouraged to take advantage of adoration, rosary recitations and daily Masses avail­Kathleen Cummings. associate director of Notre Dame's Cushwa Center for American Catholicism. 
"[Ave Maria University] is distinc­tive in that it's fulfilling a need. I think there are a lot of young American Catholics who want to go somewhere where [Catholicism] isn't ambiguous," she said. "I think attending Ave Maria University is a counter cultural decision and that has great appeal among young Catholics today." 
Applicants are also attracted to Ave Maria in part because of its low

tuition compared to other private schools ($15,150 annually for tuition, room and board -half the cost of Notre Dame) and its location, Healy said. 
"I don't know what your tern­perature is up there, but it's "70 degrees here, and the sky is clear," he said. "[Southwest Florida] is a very attractive area, and I think there is a great interest comment on other colleges or uni­versities but affirmed Notre Dame's Catholic identity. 
"I think anyone who would visit our campus would have no doubt that this is a committed Catholic university," he said. 
Michael James, associate execu­tive director of the Washington­based Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, said that he and his colleagues are delighted at the presence of a new institution like Ave Maria University but upset with the tendency of some to hail it as a 'one size fits all' solution to American Catholic higher educa­tion. 
"Generally, the inquires we've received from media sources begin with the presumption that this proj­ect is being pushed as counter-cul­tural. It's seen as a challenge to Catholic higher education," James said. "I think that it's not a com­pletely wrong presentation; howev­er, as an association, we don't find that Ave Maria University is incon­sistent with most of our Catholic institutions that are founded on service." 
He likewise dismissed the Cardinal Newman Society study that called into question the effec­tiveness of Catholic institutions of higher learning, emphasizing that there isn't one single ideal toward which American Catholic colleges and universities are striving. 
'There isn't one narrowly defined template to what is a successful Catholic college or university," he said. 
That may be true. Ave Maria University, however, with its emphasis on faith combined with a strong sense of community in a temperate climate, seems success­ful in attracting new students. The university announced a 30 percent increase in enrollment for the spring semester, and students like Matthes and Galuszka couldn't be happier with their experience so far. 
"It's got the right mix," Galuszka said. 
Contact Andrew Thagard at athagard@nd.edu 

Matthes, in particular, said she appreciates the commitment of the faculty to nurturing their own faith, adding that it's not unusual to find professors joining in on daily Mass or adoration. 
"I wanted a college where the professors were pursuing the Catholic faith," she said. "You see them doing that, and you know that's the source of the drive and intensity of their passion for teach­ing." 
Commitment to the Catholic faith is part of the reason why students are attracted to Ave Maria, and embracing new concepts that are perceived to run counter to that of established institutions is often pop­ular among young people, said in an institution that is starting out unabashedly Catholic. A lot of stu­dents like being pioneers." 
Feeling the cold shoulder 
Ave Maria's reputation for being "revolutionary" in its approach toward Catholicism and the media's emphasis on this, however, hasn't exactly endeared it to the nation's established Catholic colleges and universities. 
"I haven't been rejected, but I haven't been welcomed, either," Healy said of his experience with officials at other institutions. "We may be looked upon with [annoy­ance] because we're so openly Catholic."

Farms shrink, vanish across state 
INDIANAPOLIS -The number of Indiana farms has decreased by 10 percent over the past live years and the state has lost 400,000 acres of farmland, according to an agricul­ture census released Wednesday. 
The trends arc driven by several factors. including the growth of large-scale farms in Indiana and a decline in mid-size farms. offi­cials said. 
In 2002, Indiana had 60,271 farms com­pared with 66,707 in 1997, according to the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture, which com­piles the statistics every five years. The decline is consistent with surrounding states, said Greg Preston, USDA state statistician. 
Officials said the state's agriculture indus­try, which employs about 200,000 people, still accounts for about 10 percent of Indiana's economy. But the way farms oper­ate has changed.

The court issued the advisory opinion at the request of legislators who wanted to know whether civil unions would be enough to satisfy the court after its November ruling that said gay couples are entitled to all the rights of marriage.

existing agreement to sell the stock when it fell to $60. 
The Food and Drug Administration issued a negative report about lmClone's experimental cancer drug the day after the sale, sending the stock down 18 percent. Stewart saved about $50,000 by getting out when she did. 
Waksal, a former jet-set­ting New York socialite, is serving a seven-year prison sentence after admitting he instructed his family to sell lmClone shares when he got advance word about the report. 
Faneuil, 28, also described a frantic effort by Bacanovic in the months after the sale to pressure him into support­ing two separate cover sto­ries. He said the broker offered him a week's vaca­tion and a trip to Argentina in early 2002. 
Faneuil said Bacanovic first told him the reason for the sale was to gener­ate tax losses to offset cap­ital-gains taxes, then claimed he and Stewart had struck the deal to sell when the stock hit $60. 
In January 2002, as the investigation into Stewart's stock sale was growing, Faneuil said Bacanovic told him: "Listen, I've spoken to Martha, I met with her, and everyone's telling the same story. This was a $60 stop-loss order. That was the reason for her sale. We're all on the same page, and it's the truth. It's a true story." 
Under cross-examina­tion, Faneuil admitted using cocaine, marijuana and the club drugs Ecstasy and ketamine. But he described his cocaine and ketamine use as extremely limited, and said he had never been under the in!lu-

ence of drugs at work. 

David Apfel, a lawyer for Bacanovic, hinted through his questioning that Faneuil was willing to tell the government whatever it wanted to hear in exchange for not being prosecuted. 
But when Apfel asked Faneuil whether he knew it was a violation of Merrill Lynch policy to pass infor­mation about Waksal's account to another client, he implicated the broker once again. 
"Peter told me it was something I should do," Faneuil answered. "I never dreamed that he'd be telling me to commit a crime." 
A routine clause in Faneuil's 2002 cooperation agreement with the gov­ernment requires him not to break the law.

Associated Press 
SAN FHANCISCO -Business soft­ware maker Oracle Corp. raised its hostile takeover bid for rival PeopleSoft Inc. by 33 percent to $26 per share Wednesday, setting the stage for more high-stakes drama in the high-tech soap opera. 
The all-cash offer, which values PeopleSoft at $9.4 billion, tops Oracle's previous bid of $19.50 per share. The new offer is a 19 percent premium from PeopleSoft's closing price Tuesday. 
PeopleSoft's shares gained 81 cents, or 3.7 percent, to close at $22.70 Wednesday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, where Oracle's shares declined 64 cents, or 4.6 percent, to $13.27. 

The market's lukewarm reaction reflected the uncertainties still facing the sweetened bid, most notably a nearly completed U.S. antitrust review that could scuttle a takeover that Oracle has been pursuing for the past eight months. 
Oracle is betting the new bid will win over PeopleSoft's major stockhold­ers and pressure PeopleSoft's board to drop its staunch resistance to the offer, transforming what has been a hostile battle into friendly negotiation. 
"This is our final price," Oracle chairman Jeff Henley said Wednesday. "We urge PeopleSoft's directors to seriously consider our offer and put the interests of their stockholders first." 
PeopleSoft's board will meet to review Oracle's revised bid and "make its recommendation to PeopleSoft stockholders in due course," company spokesman Steve Swasey said in a statement Wednesday. 
Oracle set a March 12 deadline for PeopleSoft stockholders to tender their shares. The shareholders will have another chance to take sides at PeopleSoft's March 25 annual meet­ing, where Oracle has nominated an alternative slate of directors to sup­plant four PeopleSoft incumbents. 
PeopleSoft's board already has twice rejected Oracle since its suitor made its initial offer of $16 per share in early June. Pleasanton-based PeopleSoft has consistently main­tained it can become more valuable by capitalizing on its recently completed $2 billion acquisition of J.D. Edwards &Co.

ELECTION '04: 

Candidates
page 8 Thursday, February 5, 2004 
Who They Are 

Ryan Craft and Steve Lynch are both juniors from Keenan. Craft is a finance and psychology double major and Lynch is a political science major and ALPP minor. 
+ Fun facts: Ryan ran with the bulls in Pamplona. Lynch sampled his first-ever tamale in the dining hall on Monday. 
In Their Words 
+ 
Top Priority: Installing a printing station in each of the residence halls. Students would be able to access their accounts from these stations and use them within the dorms, rather than having to go to one of the computer clusters across campus.

+ 
First Priority: Ensuring that a 3-hole puncher and staplers are provided at each computer cluster for students to use. 

+ 
Notable Quote: "Our main concern is not the structure of student government. It's more impacting students' every­day lives," Craft said. 


In Our Words 
+ 
Best Idea: The installation of printers in each dormitory. Such a development would be convenient and easy, and it would cut down on lines and waiting times in each computer cluster. 

+ 
Worst Idea: A shuttle service from the C parking lot to DeBartolo. The distance from the lots to the building is hard· ly far, and the amount of time students would need to wait for the shuttle would probably surpass the amount of time needed to walk from their cars to DeBartolo. The idea is unnecessary, impractical and lazy. 

+ 
Most Feasible Idea: Staplers and three-hole punchers. The items are inexpensive and useful, and it is doubtful that the administration would oppose such a practical and cheap development for students. 

+ 
Least Feasible Idea: C lot shuttle to DeE.artolo. The University would never spend such funds and exwmd such energy to transport students such a short distance. 


Bottom Line 

Craft and Lynch throw out some decent ideas, but their suggestions and their platform are exactly that-thrown out, not thought out or researched. The candidates do not seem particularly serious about their campaign, and they have no experience with student government-a major disadvantage, because they are uneducated about how to go about implementing their plans and ideas. As representatives dealing with the administration, they would be ineffective because they appear ill-informed and not serious. While their campaign focuses on basically attainable, simple. every­day goals, their lack of knowledge about student government ultimately hurts them. 
Who They Are 
Ebersol is a junior film, television and theatre major. and lives off-campus. Leito is a sophomore an accounting major from Siegfried.
+ Fun facts: Ebersol filmed a documentary this summer in Africa with Nelson Mandela. Leito enjoys playing ulti­mate Frisbee. 
In Their Words 
+ 
Top Priority: Having the student body president appointed a member of the Board of Trustees. Ebersol said he can guarantee this platform promise and if he delivers, it will be a great boost for student-administrator relations. 

+ 
First Priority: Placing a real emphasis on listening to what students want. 

+ 
Notable Quote: "I feel really strongly about the things that we proposed. It is only worth talking about if you arc willing to accomplish it," Ebersol said. 


In Our Words 
+ 
Best Idea: Having the student body president being a member of the Board of Trustees. This ticket's top priority is also its best idea because of the possibilities it could have for increasing awareness of student needs. 

+ 
Worst Idea: Implementing a mid-semester Teacher Course Evaluation. Many students do not like filling these out at the end of the semester and having to do it twice will only create further frustrations. Also, the office that processes the TCEs will not be able to handle the overload. 

+ 
Most Feasible Idea: Placing dining hall menus outside the dining halls. This is relatively simple to do and easily their most feasible idea. 

+ 
Least Feasible Idea: Hosting a presidential debate. Ebersol said that he intends to bring high profile politicians to campus this spring and that it is highly possible for Notre Dame to host a presidential debate. Though this idea seems great on paper, it seems to be both very lofty and the least reachable plank on this extensive platform. 


Bottom Line 
Ebersol and Leito's template is very extemive and the most researched of the four candidates running for student body president this year. But this expansive platform should not be seen as merely a set of unrealistic goals. Ebersol's goals for last year's elections were researched, though they were also lofty. However, this time Ebersol, including Leito, Leito have the necessary experience in student government to know what is achievable. Additionally, they helped restructure studeat government this school year and are aware of what they need to do to get what they want accomplished.

ELECTION '04 


Candidates
Thursday, February 5, 2004 page 9 
Who They Are . 
Mark Healy is a freshman from Zahm who intends to major in Electrical Engineering. Mike Healy is a freshman from Keenan who intends to major in American Studies. 
+ Fun facts: Mark llealy's picture in the Dogbook was taken in a race car. Mike Healy has spent a night in a trash can. 
In Their Words 

+ 
Top Priority: Making student government more accessible and open to student opinion. To accomplish this, the ticket plans to place an idea box next to the TCE drop box in DeBartolo Hall. 

+ 
First Priority: Establishing a transition team with experience to smoothly enter office. 

+ 
Notable Quote: "I really think it is time for student government to open its windows and let some fresh ideas in," said Mark Healy 


In Our Words 

+ 
Best Idea: Establishing a DVD rental location on campus, possibly in the LaFortune Student Center. There is clearly a market for an on-campus movie rental establishment and both students and a business would benefit from this idea. 

+ 
Worst Idea: Holding student forums to discuss controversial issues, such as the HOTC Pass and Review and CORE classes. Previous administrations have held student forums to talk about issues such as the new alcohol policy, which were sparsely attended and not worthwhile. 

+ 
Most Feasible Idea: Posting buyback book prices from the Notre Dame bookstore online. Buyback prices are known by the bookstore, and students would benefit greatly from posting them online. 

+ 
Least Feasible Idea: llot sandwiches and fountain drinks in Grab 'n Go. Previous tickets have discussed over­hauling Notre Dame Food Services, and this idea will not be feasible without raising the cost of meal plans. 


Bottom Line While some may scoff at the fact that this is a freshman ticket, Mark and Mike Healy (no relation) are serious about improving the amount of input students provide to student government. But they have not done enough research to overcome their lack of knowledge about Notre Dame student government. Being unfamiliar with past governments has led them to propose ideas such as creating student forums on key issues, a tactic that was unsuccessful for pre­vious administrations. And while they also haven't run their platform by key administrators to check its feasibility, don't be surprised if the llealys learn from their mistakes and are viable candidates in future elections, after getting more involved with student government. 
Who They Are Istvan is a junior from Morrissey majoring in aerospace Engineering. Bell is a junior from Walsh majoring in chemical engineering.
+ Fun facts: Adam was 25 pounds lighter than the next lightest player on his high school football team. Karla is the Walsh llall I)Htscot. 
In Their Words 

+ 
Top Priority: As their top priority, Istvan and Bell hope to bring dances back to the dorms. They suggest imple­menting a "pledge" system by which on-campus students sign a document stating that they will not participate in excessive drinking during in-dorm dances. 

+ 
First Priority: The candidates' first priority is to establish an on-campus DVD rental store. As managers at the Huddle, they envision this as a prime location for the store. They have also begun discussion with Huddle general manager Jim Labella and claim he is receptive to the idea. 

+ 
Notable Quote: "There is no real fun aspect to a dorm like there was our freshman year," Istvan said. 


In Our Words 

+ 
Best Idea: The DVD rental store is Istvan and Bell's best idea, simply because of the student demand that it would have on campus. It would be a beneficial option due to its convenience for students who prefer not to, or do not have the transportation to travel off campus. 

+ 
Worst Idea: The candidate's worst idea is having student government provide marshmallows to seniors before each home football game. Security sees the marshmallows as the problem -monitored distribution would fail to add ross the issue. 

+ 
Most Feasible Idea: In addition to being their best idea, the DVD rental store is also Istvan and Bell's most feasible idea. The fact that they have already initiated communication with Jim Labella is a step in the right direction. 

+ 
Least Feasible Idea: The least feasible idea proposed by this ticket is returning SYH dances to the dorms. With tlw backlash the administration has received from students in regard to the existing alcohol/dance policy, it seems little is left to bn done that will make a significant impact. 


Istvan and Bell have the initiative to explore the best options for the student body. They present themselves in a professional manner, yet have no experience in student government on which to build their administration. Their platform outlines clear plans of action, but many of their ideas, like that to return SYR dances to the dorms, seem likely to become promises they can't keep.

Business with a conscience 
Business students here have a tremen­dous ability to do good work through their motives and actions. Interviews with six past and present students and administra­tors in the College of Business have made Andrew this clear. 

DeBerry
Former Dean of the College of Business Frank Reilly notes ND Changing business persons are Times needed to help society and individuals. On a macro level, countries need good business people to establish capital markets for sus­tainable development as shown in Southeast Asia. On a micro level, financial planners help individuals develop resources for their personal goals. 
Some counter the view that business is evil. Kim Brennan, the program manager of the Master of Science in Administration pro­gram that teaches about non-profit man­agement, believes that the for-profit sector can provide many good examples of how to run an organization effectively and make something sustainable to those who wish to serve in the not-for-profit sector. 
In order for business to be a genuine serv­ice, Reilly maintains that one's efforts need to have proper understanding. He empha­sizes that executives clearly miss the point if they don't recognize the larger purpose beyond making money. 
Senior Justin Brandon is a former busi­ness student pursuing a Sociology degree and an International Business Certificate. He notes that hunger for money is not the best motive for business. Business is intend­ed to serve people, not the other way around. Ultimately, it comes back to the people. 
Many serve by working in the non-profit sector. The Gigot Center for Entrepreneurship has several programs that students can work with. Programs range from neighborhood mentoring proj­ects with disadvantaged teenagers to inter­national partnerships with poor communi­ties in South Africa and Jamaica. These programs try to shift paradigms and tell stu­dents that they do have real, professional 

options in the non-proflt sector. 
Students can also join the Student International Business Council (SIBQ. Having a mission of "Peace through com­merce," members find innovative ways to apply their talents. SIBC Chief Financial Officer and junior accounting major, John Boots, says that the Global Development Division in particular can use student sup­port for their bednet project jn Haiti and their business school venture in Kenya. 
Despite the value of non-proflt work, it isn't for everyone. Students can also do tremendous work in the for-profit sector. The key is maintaining a value-oriented foundation. 
2003 alumnus and old roommate John Cannon, who is currently doing non-profit work in Alabama, believes that businesses inherently serve people because they fulfill a need in society. He points out that our capi­1alist economy is driven by competition, and everyone suffers when this system drops. 
However, capitalist competition neglects various social areas, and a socialist aspect of our society tries to address this through public education, medical access and a pro­gressive income tax. Consequently, Cannon emphasizes having balance and perspec­1ive. It's important to be very conscious of how one fits not only into a business but also the local community and the total soci­ety. 
Getting this perspective takes effort dur­ing undergraduate business studies. A cou­ple of students noted that the business cur­Jiculum is more about developing skills and making decisions. It doesn't necessarily challenge one to think about broader social problems or to study the larger role of busi­ness in society, let alone in light of this com­munity's Catholic character. Although our professors do comparatively well at ethical education, the Catholic character of aca­demics is a persistent concern not just for business but for all our colleges. 
The profit-minded mentality was what drove Justin Brandon away from the busi­ness school as an upperclassman. Although the business skills he acquired will still be valuable, his studies in sociology were what provided a broader understanding of corpo­rate responsibility. 
Some students aren't able to relate busi­ness to its social impact. It's not that they don't care; they just don't make the connec­tion. They have incredible power to discov­er. Consequently, Brandon encourages his peers to pursue outside studies to derive a better understanding of the role of business. 
Some corporations maintain a clear social concern while pursuing profit. For example, Boots was encouraged to pursue service work in an internship interview with KPMG. Many corporations like KPMG have organi­zations for workers to demonstrate servant leadership and responsible corporate citi­zenship. 
Doing work outside the job can be a valu­able experience, especially if one feels that their business work is not having an impact. Pro bono work may take a small percentage of one's time. Young business professionals are always welcome on community boards. Experienced executives are needed for phil­anthropic work. Any business person can be a great asset because of their unique skills in organization, strategy and develop­ment. All these efforts support an example of character both on the job and lor one's family. 
In the six interviews, one theme repeated­ly surfaced: passion. It's different for each person according to their skills and inter­ests, but when focused in some way on oth­ers' welfare, the power is awesome. 
Business students are developing special­ized skills the world needs that only they can provide. By acting on their passions with the right perspective, business people will see that they have tremendous power.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Explaining 'Vagina' 
Ah, Notre Dame. The place where children toss footballs with their fathers on Saturday football game days, donning Irish jerseys way too big for some football players. The place where young boys and girls from the South Bend community come, their heads pointed upward in amazement at the beauty that is the Golden Dome and the gorgeous landscape. 
Notre Dame, the place where family and friends visit to see their darling sons and daughters and brothers and sisters. Notre Dame, the place where you sit down at a dining hall table to see the word "VAGINA" in 42-sized font capital letters, reminding us it's "time to COME again." 
Yep, the Vagina Monologues are back in town. And conveniently, so will my 10-ycar-old brother. I can't wait to show him around campus, let him see the JACC and then take him to eat in one of our dining halls. 
Oh wait, I can't. · 
Why not? Perhaps because my 10-year-old brother, a week after witnessing Janet Jackson's star-studded breast on national TV, can't help but notice the red. eye-catching advertisement with "VAGINA" text in front of his very eyes. 
("Oh, it's okay Sean, they spelled China incorrectly.") 
("It's the name of a famous performer, Sean.") 
This is Notre Dame, the place where, for class business projects, students must run by any and every idea for advertising past the Student Activities Office. 
If I wanted to sell shirts around campus with a beer logo, I couldn't-too suggestive of underage drinking. If I wanted to sell shirts with lewd or sexual slogans across them, I couldn't-too indecent. 
And that's why it all makes perfect sense why our Department of Gender Studies can issue an advertisement in our own dining halls luring us to "come" and celebrate the highly uncontroversial issue of a woman's genitals. 
llooray, everyone say "VAGINA!" 
Join in, Scan. It's okay, I know you're 10, but sooner or later everybody will be doing it. Why pursue decency, Sean? One of the most respected Catholic institu­tions in America doesn't. 
Our administration has done a fantastic job of maintaining the old "family environment" feel-let's give them a raise. And oh yeah, Sean, tell your alumni parents to contribute an extra dollar, too.

·The right to bare 
For the most part, I would agree with Professor Emily Phillips' comments on the Super Bowl half-time show, suggesting that the partial showing of a woman's breast is not that big of a deal. 
But two contrary facts prevent agreement: 
1. 
a breast is not "genitalia;" 

2. 
and more importantly, Janet Jackson did not show her breast. Bather, it was exposed by Justin Timberlake, a man who had no business taking that action, even if with her "OK." The message given is that a man can use a woman for his own purposes, with or without her approval. The next step is rape.

EDITORIAL CARTOON 


Consider the environm.ent 
Throughout the presidential campaigning, I have noticed a severe lack of emphasis placed on environmental issues and their solutions. 
In a recent on-line survey of the three top candidates, I found only one, John Kerry, who approaches environmental issues by focusing on environmental justice. 
John Edwards has the poorest environmental policy, sticking to popular issues like ANWR while ignoring the poor and uneducated who suffer the worst effects of industry pollution. 
Howard Dean is much better, focusing on health issues inter­twined with environmental policy, but it is Kerry who specifically states a federal obligation to the poor and minorities in his environ­mental policy. 
I urge voters to consider environmental justice in their presiden­tial choice. This is our generation's civil rights movement.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Twista dazzles but content fizzles 
By KENYATTA STORIN 
Scene Music Critic 
Once you have heard Chicago rapper Twista, it is impossible to forget him. He is a ridiculously fast rapper -so fast that he could probably give the motor-mouthed MicroMachines guy a run for his money. It's been close to five years since his last album, but Twista has finally returned with his third installment, Kamikaze. And like previous Twista joints, the album has plenty of that trademark speed. But as much as Kamikaze will hit you as hard as five Kamikaze shots, the lack of depth will sober you up fast. 

When you first hear Kamikaze, you will likely be amazed by Twista's non­stop, rapid-fire delivery, but when you start to listen carefully to what Twista is actually saying, you come to realize that he really is not saying much of anything at all. As a result, most of the tracks have a tendency to blend togeth­
er after a while. Virtually all of the tracks deal with the over-used rap themes of thugs, women, sex and drugs, and Twista says nothing in his flows that has not already been said before at a slower pace. 
But this is not to say that the album does not have· its moments. Undoubtedly, the best track is the sexy lead sin­gle "Slow Jamz," with the help of acclaimed produc­er Kanye West. who even sings a little on the track. West produces a sweet, mellow beat with some creatively used Luther Vandross samples, which contrast well with Twista's rapid flow and Jamie Foxx's additional vocals. The drug anthem

Scene Music Critic 
A Crow Left of the Murder finds a very different Incubus from their pre­vious effort, 2001's double platinum Morning View. For starters, founding bassist Dirk Lance left the band over the past summer and was replaced by Ben Kenney, formerly of The Roots. Kenney promised to bring a rejuvenat­ed Incubus into the studio when recording began in October. The boys then decided to record outside their comfort zone of Southern California in favor of the pristine shores of Atlanta, Ga. Finally, the fact that guitarist Mike Einziger was experimenting with new sounds during the past Lollapalooza Tour and invariably brought this new sound into the studio would prove to be the final ingredient in the new Incubus formula. 
It is evident from the initial track of A Crow Left of the Murder that Incubus will be getting back to louder and angrier roots. The album begins with distortion and seemingly space­age sounds of Incubus's resident DJ Kilmore. It is from this chaos that Einzinger's simple guitar work slowly begins to build up with Jose Pasillas's drums and Brandon Boyd's now famous trademark croon. 
The music of the initial track and lead radio single, "Megalomaniac," appears to come from the same cre­ative mind that produced Incubus's first album, S.C.I.E.N.C.E. The verse of the song is heavily bass-driven with the guitar coming in and out until it drives the chorus home. It is also clear in the chorus of "Megalomaniac" chorus that Boyd is a much angrier man than the one· who belted out tunes such as "Wish You Were Here" and "Drive." In "Megalomaniac," Boyd screams: "You're no 

"Higher," fea­turing Ludacris, and the slow jam "So Sexy," featuring R. Kelly, are decent listens, as well. Twista also gives a breath of fresh air toward the end of the album by switching up 
his content a bit with the reflective "Hope," a tribute to deceased artists Aaliyah, Left-Eye and Jam Master Jay, and the victims of September 11. The positive, feel-good "Sunshine," featuring Anthony Hamilton, also offers a bright spot on the album. 
Aside from the content, the other problem with Kamikaze is that the pro­duction is rather hit or miss, and except for maybe "Slow Jamz," there is nothing particularly exceptional. Twista's right-hand man, Toxic, pro­duced nearly half of the album, and with the exception of "Get Me," the results are regrettably your average run-of-the-mill stuff. Even Kanye West, best known for his contributions on Jay-Z's hits "Takeover" and "Izzo (H.O.V.A.)," produces pretty tame beats on "Overnight Celebrity" and "One Last Time." 

Twista may very well be the fastest rapper in the business, perhaps even ever, but he still does not have what it takes to carry an album by himself. It is rare to find a rapper so astounding yet so restricted at the same time. He contrasts well with other rappers in guest appearances. but alone he becomes exposed as somewhat of a one-trick pony. 1\vista could have ben­efited from better production, especial­ly from Toxic, but ultimately the flaws of the album are on him. Overall. Kamikaze is like your average action movie: flashy and exciting the first time, but ultimately shallow and for­gettable in the long run.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Incubus returns to its roots 


Jesus I Yeah you're no ... Elvis." 
Upon closer inspection, A Crow Left of the Murder shares quali­ties with their s e c o n d release, Make Yourself. The t r a c k " P i s t o I a" might very well be the next single off the disc, and at times it seems like it couLd have been lifted straight from their sophomore effort. The song begins with another clip from DJ Kilmore before fading away to the riff of Einzinger's guitar and Boyd's vocals. Once the chorus begins, the introduction clip rejoins as the drums and bass crash in and heighten the already building song that only esca­lates as Boyd sings "My pen is a pisto­la." However, the highlight of the track might very well be the bridge near the end of the song that allows each mem­ber ·Of Incubus to showcase what he does best. The timing and musician­

ship are clear as the bridge feeds into the final verse and chorus. A Crow Left of the Murder is every­thing that Morning View is not -and 
.everything that it should have been. The former brings Incubus fans full circle as the boys return to their loud­er distorted roots while expanding their sound to include slower, more mellow songs. The differences in the recording process are clearly for the better and A Crow Left of the Murder is so eclectic that it will appeal to Incubus fans both new and old.

When something is good, why 
change it? 
That seems to be the philosophy of 
the piano pop prince of the decade, 
Ben Folds. Throughout his time with 
his previous band, Ben Folds Five, 
Folds produced a savvy collection of 
quirky pop ballads that earned him 
a devoted fan base and placed his 
name on the charts as a quiet yet 
influential force in popular music. 
Two years ago, Folds called it 
quits with his band mates and head­
ed out on his own with just his 
piano in tow. His album to follow, 
Hockin' the Suburbs, allowed Folds 
to further explore his narrating lyri­-cal style and his punchy piano 
rhythms, but stayed true to his dis­
tinctive sound. 
llis live album, released in 2002, 
featured more of Folds in his own 
unique genre. The album showcased 
an array of songs from Folds reper­
toire, combining old favorites from 
Speed Graphic & Sunnv 16 Eps 

Ben Folds 
Sony Records 

the Five with his independent 
releases as a solo man. Keeping with his tried and true method of piano balladeering, Folds has added two new EPs to his line of album releases. The EPs, Speed Graphic and Sunny 16, contain more of the distinct pumping beats and witty lyrics that have dotted Folds' musical past. The results are quality 
songs that con­tain nothing new or daring, but still are of a high musical standard. 
Speaking on his website about his deci­sion to release his latest music via the Internet and on five­song EPs, Folds says, "Part of me thinks I'm an idiot for 'wasting' this recording on limited release [EP's]. but I'm really into this method of recording and releasing quickly and

number, sampling similar beats and themes from songs like "One Angry Dwarf," "Happier," and "Rockin' the Suburbs." The title of the song says it all: "There is Always Something Cooler Than You." Fuzzy bass fills in the background as Folds chants, "Make me feel tiny if it makes you feel tall, I but there's always some­one cooler than you. I Yeah ... but you won't be it for long. I Oh there's always someone cooler than you." 
On the song "All You Can Eat," Folds tries his hand at politics, a rare theme for him that he manages quite well. The innocent-sounding melody is deceiving once the lyrics are heard. Folds takes jabs at SUV drivers, Wai-Mart, consumer culture and obnoxious people, in general. singing with his childlike frankness that they don't care "just as long as there's enough for them." 
With a new album due out some­time this year. Folds is showing promise for his future musical endeavors with these EPs. Although he shies away from anything too new or groundbreaking, he contin­ues to be a reliable source for great music. Folds' knack for melody and lyrical witticisms make him one of the best songwriters this generation has seen.

making it all about music." 
Folds is certainly good about "making it all about the music." Although the EPs do not prov~ to be his best work in recent years, the songs are still quite good and will be a hit with fans. 
Speed Graphic opens with a cover of the Cure's "In Between Days." Folds treats the song in much the same manner as the original, though with a bit more optimism and piano, proving he really does know how to be "all dressed up like the Cure." 
The second track is a Folds origi­nal, reportedly written only a week before recording. "Give Judy My Notice" has the lovely piano melodies characteristic of songs from the past like "Brick." The song tells a tale of breaking up with Folds, seeming gentle and tender while "giving Judy his notice." He does get his characteristic jibe in, however, when he sings with crass elegance, "Judy I won't ... follow you around and hold the door I I'm not sorry till you're sorrier." 
The EP also includes fast and fren­zied circular piano on "Dog" and a tune co-written with former Ben Folds Five drummer Darren Jesse, "Wandering." 
The opening track on Sunny 16 is perhaps the quintessential Folds

Brevvster, Irish vvin NCAA block titles 
Special to The Observer 
Sophomore middle block­er Lauren Brewster and the Notre Dame volleyball team registered a pair of land­marks recently. when the final NCAA Division I women's volleyball statis­tics were announced. 
Brewster became the first Irish player to lead the nation in a statistical cate­gory, with a 1.78 block av1~ragc. while Notre Dame notched its first statistical crown in a team category. The Irish averaged 3.72 blocks per game, with sec­ond-place Cornell finishing at 3.52. 
Bn~wster. who vaulted into the national lead in blocking midway through the season and stayed among the top two throughout the campaign, 1~dged Valparaiso's Liz Mikos for the title, when the Crusader finished with an average of 1.77 per game. Brewster. who was nanwd honorable mention i\11-Anwrica and lirst-team All-Big East this season, finislwd fourth in the nation as a freshman with a 1.68 block average. 
Brewster had one of the top blocking campaigns in Irish history. Her block average was the third-best season mark in the Notre Dame annals, just .01 off the school record. Brewster's 155 block assists matched the second­highest total in Notre Dame history, just six shy of the record she established in 2002. ller 185 total blocks were the third-best total ever for an Irish player. 
In addition to leading the Big East in blocking (with second-place Ashleigh Young of Hutgers more than 0.5 blocks per game behind, at 1.27). Brewster was tops on the Irish and fourth in the league in both hitting percentage and points. 
In conference play, Brewster posted a .403 attack percentage, by far the best of anyone in the league. Brewster also led Notre Dame in kill average 
(3.58) and was second in service aces (0.26). 
Brewster was honored as the Big East Player of the Week three times in the month of October and was one of just two players to win the award on three occasions this season.

Following the big win against Olivet, the Belles were looking to come out and steal a win from Calvin, a team that was 15-3 going into the game. Instead,. they were handed their worst loss of the sea­son. 
In a crusbing 65-42 loss, the Belles were outplayed on both sides of the ball and looked like they didn't belong on the same court as the overpowering Knights. 
Calvin got off to hot start, outscoring the Belles 18-3 to start the game. Saint Mary's never fully recovered, going into the half down 36-18. The Belles did, how­ever, manage to keep up with Calvin in the second half. being outscored 29-24 en route to the 23-point loss. Only other time this season, in a 68-45 loss to Washington, the Belles were outscored by 23 points. 
"We were expecting them to transition like they did last time," senior guard Katie Miller said. "We knew they were going to be a quick team, and they were." 
Calvin forced the Belles into transition defense much of the first half, pushing the ball up court quickly off rebounds. The Belles responded by attempting to keep up in the quick tempo game, and they were much less successful. 
Calvin shot 42 percent from the floor in the win, while Saint Mary's shot just 27 percent. The statistic fails to tell the whole story, as Saint Mary's was bullied on offense, unable to get good looks on many of their possessions down court. 

Guard Kristen McDonald led the way for Calvin, scoring 15 points on 6-for-9 shooting and adding five assists. Lesa Holleman and Lisa Winkle complemented McDonald on the offensive end, contributing 11 and 10 points, respectively. 
"We just weren't stopping their penetration --they were getting easy lay-ups," said Miller. 
For Saint Mary's, three players scored nine points: Bridget Lipke, Maureen Bush and Bridget Boyce. Lipke added four rebounds for the Belles in 22 minutes. 
Following the game, Belles coach Susan Bellina would not comment on the loss. ller Belles fell to 6-14 on the year and 1-8 in MIAA play. 
For Saint Mary's, turnovers have been an on-and-off problem all year. In the contest with Calvin. this problem showed its ugly head as the Belles committed 23 turnovers to their 11 assists. 
"OffeJ.lsively, it seemed like we had a lot of turnovers," Miller said. "We just weren't getting our game together, we weren't playing together as a team." 
Saint Mary's will travel to !lope this weekend, for a Saturday after­noon match-up with the Flying Dutch, who are currently first in

Belles rung, suffer home loss 
the MIAA. llope is one of two teams this year to beat Calvin, so the Belles should have their hands full. 
"We just need to play together, that's all there is to it," Miller said. "We need to come out, be strong, win and have conlidence in our­selves. We seem like we go on highs, and then we go on lows."

Difficult 5-7 season hurts recruiting process

recruiting are blatant and visi­ble. 
Sure, the Irish got their target at running back in Georgia's Gatorade Player of the Year Darius Walker. 
They got the athleticism of Anthony Vernaglia and the shiftiness of Justin Hoskins. 
But last season's class of quar­terback Brady Quinn and defen­sive end Victor Abiamiri was rated among the top live nation­al recruiting classes. 
This year's class might not make it into the top 25.

Starting a freshman quarter­back and struggling to !ill the holes in the offensive line and other positions vacated by grad­uating seniors, the Irish expect­ed to have rough times through a tough 2003 schedule. The problem was that while Notre Dame was getting thumped at home by rival USC ( 45-14) and southern powerhouse Florida State (37 -0), recruits were in South Bend visiting and attend­ing the games. 
The players obviously did not like what they saw. 
/. 


-f< US.Cellular 
Quarterback Brian Brohm and offensive linemen Jeff Byers and Allen Smith all visited on the weekend of Oct. 17. They wit­nessed a game between Notre Dame and eventual national champion USC. 
Brohm committed to Louisville. Byers went to USC. Smith eventually signed with Stanford. 
The methods of the coaching staff came under heavy scrutiny as the months passed and numerous schools, before bowl week even approached, began 
---"! 
to reach the double-digits in 
commitments while Willingham 
and his staff remained with live 
or six players verbally commit­
ted. 

Coaches weren't doing enough early, and fans complained. So the coaches invited players for visits during game weekends. 
That didn't seem to work 

either. 
Willingham explained Wednesday that he believes the recruiting process must be thor­ough, and therefore sometimes slower, in order to correctly evaluate a prospect. The aca­demic requirements of such an institution also have an efl'ect. 
That could be the case, but then why did Stanford get Smith over Notre Dame? 
Why did Virginia. a rigorous academic institution, sweep cor­nerback Nate Lyles away from the Irish? 
The common opinion said Notre Dame had lost many of its first options to competing recruiting efforts and had been forced to move to other options. 
Coaches likely would not and should not admit that any play­er was not a first option. Such an admission would hurt the health of the program. 
But the reason·so many play­ers on the oflicial recruiting list are listed at multiple positions -and the reason many of the players do not have the stats of players in past recruiting class­es is simple. 
This is a class based solely on potential. 
In a year in which Willingham and the Irish seemingly could not buy a win, they had trouble selling recruits as well. 
No one knows for sure how the players in the class of 2008 will develop. Players like line­backer Abdel Banda and defen­sive end Justin Brown have been described as having "raw talent." 
Raw talent is good, if it devel­ops. It the talent does not develop, it is a waste of a scholarship. 
"The potential is what it's all about," Willingham said. "And it's about really coaching and developing young people. Do you want to put your futures just in potential? No. Because at some point you've got to change that where it's got to be prod uc­tion."

TRACK & FIELD 


Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Marion Jones is ready to start her track career again. 
That could mean bad news for the rest of her competitors. 
Jones will run in the 60 meters Friday at the Millrose Games, her first competition in over a year since taking a leave to have a baby. Though she hardly ever competes during the indoor season, Jones want­ed to get her return under­way to prepare for the Olympics this summer. 
"No matter where I go in the world, the pressure would still be on in terms of the world media, in terms of me wanting to prove myself in the first competi­tion," Jones said. "I decid­ed, 'Why not test myself with some of the best in the world? Why not just go for it? I've never been one to run away from a challenge. I'm not doing it now." 

Jones will face a top­notch field, including teenage sensation Allyson Felix. Last June, Felix broke Jones' 200-meter high school record, finishing in 
22.52 seconds. 
In addition, world outdoor silver medalist Torri Edwards and Inger Miller are entered in the field. 
"I always seem to be the target," Jones said. "It's interesting, I see articles on Allyson. I see all the pres­sure that's coming upon her after running some great times last year. I say she's running some great times, Marion it's time for you to start running great times. Sometimes I use it as moti­vation quietly to myself." 
Jones had a baby boy last June, and went back on the track about a month later. 
Because she stayed in shape throughout her preg­nancy, her first few prac­tices were not too difficult. 
But she was desperate to get back onto the track because she missed the competition. 
So two months ago, she turned to new coach Dan Pfaff and said, "Dan, I need a competition." 
"I wanted to get back out there and get that feeling again," Jones said. ''I'm missing that feeling of pre­race jitters. I'm missing the feeling of walking out there, the crowd going crazy. I'm missing the feeling of the athletes getting behind their blocks. I can't get that in practice." 
Jones loves her new rela­tionship with Pfaff. He allows her training to be more flexible, and also has helped her improve on the long jump.

national player rankings. 
Lambert joins three other defensive backs in the present class in Tregg Duerson, Leo Ferrine and Junior Jabbic. 
Ferrine and Jabbic arc per­fect examples of athletes Willingham recruits in the hopes of molding the players to his system. Jabbie is a prep school graduate, one year removed from high school foot­ball and a year older than most other recruits. 
Willingham acknowledged the year could give Jabbie an edge, but he denied recruiting players just because they are older and more mature. 
"The player must meet the same set of criteria Ias any other player]." Willingham said. "But a year may help them grow, may help them develop, which puts them in a different area. It's not necessarily an advantage for us or the school, but it may be an advantage for the young man." 
Jabbic received interest from Syracuse, Wisconsin, Boston College and North Carolina. though Lemming believes he could be a sleeper that this year's recruiting powers ­USC, Oklahoma and others ­overlooked. 
Additional recruits include linebacker Abdel Banda, offen­sive linemen Chauncey Incarnato and John Kadous, defensive end l~onald Talley and quarterbacks Darrin Bragg and David Wolke. 
Willingham also continued his habit of recruiting athletes who can play at multiple positions. 
Last year, A'mbrosc Wooden (wide receiver/defensive back) and Tom Zbikowski (wide receiver/safety/defensive back) came in as multiple position players. 
This year, the Irish have sev­eral players listed at multiple positions, as well. According to Willingham, 6-foot-4, 225­pound Maryland player Justin Brown has the toughness to play defensive end along with the quickness to play line­backer. 
Brandon Nicolas, from Santa Ana, Calif., may play offensive or defensive line. 
Vernaglia is an all-around athlete. 
Still, Willingham cannot guar­antee how much or how soon this class will contribute. 
"The question always arises as who will play," Willingham said. "I can honestly tell you, I have absolutely no idea. Some will play early. Some may play later in their careers. But that will all be determined by what they do on the field. 
"I am excited about the toughness and also the mixture that I think they bring in terms of being the type of student and person that we want at the University of Notre Dame." 
Notes: 
Indianapolis defensive end Ryan Baker made a verbal commitment to Notre Dame on Jan. 25. The 6-foot-6, 235­pound Baker, however, did not appear on the official signing list of 17 Notre Dame recruits. 
Baker, who is deciding between Notre Dame and Purdue, was unavailable for comment Wednesday night. He could make a decision as early as tomorrow, though the pres­ent time frame is a dead-period for coaches, meaning coaches cannot make person-to-person contact with a player until 48 hours after signing day, accord­ing to Willingham .

Salas set to shine in final season of stellar Irish career 
By ANN LOUGHERY Sports Writer 
Alicia Salas knew she didn't belong on the sidelines. 
But as a freshman, the now nationally ranked senior didn't make the starting lineup of the Irish tennis team. 
"I was always used to playing in high school, so not being able to compete my freshman year was frustrating," Salas recalled. "I was sick of sitting on the sidelines." 
That was all the motivation she need­ed. 
Over the summer following her fresh­man year, Salas played tournaments and honed her skills in preparation for an eventful sophomore season. Head coach Jay Louderback noted a significant change in her abilities. 
"She was very consistent as a fresh­
man, but she didn't have a whole lot of before returning to the No. 2 spot after power," he said. "She didn't come to the teammate Caylan Leslie returned from net a lot.

of that." 
Salas' success this fall bore witness to Dasso's observation. This fall, she earned a 12-6 record, claiming eight victories over ranked opponents. Four of her loss­es came at the hands of top-1 0 ranked competitors. She has started the spring season strong, remaining undefeated after matches against Big Ten schools Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio State. This past weekend, she avenged her loss last season to Wisconsin's Katie McGaffigan, defeating her rival 7-6 (7-3), 6-3. 
Both Dasso and Louderback are confi­dent her winning ways will continue. 
"I think she'll do well this season," Louderback said. "She'll probably go quite a ways in the NCAA tournament. She's competitive. She doesn't like to lose."

W1~dnesday night. Thomas kept shooting despite his lack of scoring. A large num-· ber of his misses kept hitting the front of the rim. 
Meanwhile, Quinn tried to carry the Irish (10-8, 4-4 in thn Big East) to a much­needed victory. Brey saw Quinn had the hot hand and started running the offense through the sophomore. 
With Boston College (13-7, 3-5) ahead 63-54. Quinn nailed 3-pointers on consec­utive trips down the court around a Golden Eagles free throw to cut the lead to 64­60. 
After a Boston College miss, Thomas came down and with the Irish having numbers on the break, decided to pull up and launch a 3-pointer, but missed. 
Another Boston College free-throw pushed the Eagles lead to 65-60 and a 
3-point play by Torrian Jones got the Irish as close as they would get at 65-63 with just over three minutes remaining. 
Jermaine Watson Jed Boston College with 22 paints. Sophomore Craig Smith added 20 points for the Golden Eagles. 
Another major offensive problem for the Irish was not getting any production out of forward Tarin Francis. Francis scored six points in the first 6:03 of the game, but was held scoreless for the rest of the night. Brey even took Francis out for extended periods of the sec­ond half as the Irish couldn't get Francis back into the offensive flow in the mark. 
Jordan Cornette found his touch from beyond the arc, scoring 11 points and shoot­ing 3-of-5 on 3-pointers. Cornette, Quinn and Thomas were the only Notre Dame players to reach double fig­ures. 
Overall, the Irish shot well on 3-pointers, going 10-of­24.

Sparring 
continued from page 28 
Fellow senior captain Stefan Borovina agreed with Dillon, say­ing these early sessions are a great way to work out the initial stiffness and get the full feel of the ring again. 
Newer boxers met the change in training with slight apprehen­sion. 
"It was kind of hard to get rid of the butterflies. And it's nerve­racking to put the head gear on for the first time, but I love it now," freshman Chris Calderone said. 
Senior Don Zimmer, who is par­ticipating in his first Bengal Bouts, likened his first sparring experience to the first time he went scuba diving. 
"It's like when you are first underwater, and its sort of euphoric, but it comes with a bit of a head rush," he said. 'Tm not sure if that's from hyperventilat­ing or getting popped in the chin." 
These early sparring sessions mark a shift in intensity from ear­lier practices, and as newer box­ers gain ring time. the battles in the Boxing Room will become more fierce. 
A number of veteran boxers, including Larry Rooney and Bill Philip, said they were excited to be sparring again, as it is a nice change of pace from day-to-day training. Club co-president and senior captain Tommy Demko agreed and recognized a change in practice tempo. 
"It's a shift of intensity," Demko said. "Guys start practicing a lot harder when they realize what they have to do. They realize this is the next step." 
The onset of sparring has also added a number of items to box­ing secretary Kristin Boyd's already lengthy daily to-do list. Boyd, a junior at Notre Dame, has been involved with the Boxing Club since last year. In addition to 
·············-··· ·-------------­
the usual processing of medical forms, consent forms, attendance sheets, accumulation of dues and soliciting of ads, Boyd gives the final consent for each boxer to spar after checking ofT a number of necessary requirements. 
"It's a lot more work," Boyd said, as she printed ofT a sparring card and grabbed a ringing phone. "I basically have final approval of who gets in the ring." 
When not sparring, the boxers practice their form and footwork under the guidance of the cap­tains. First-year captain Billy Zizic said that, in his new role, he has taken on more instructive duties. 
"We're trying to show the guys more than just fundamentals ­more contemporary boxing styles rather than the typical Bengal Bouts style of two guys back on their heels just swinging," he said. "The preliminaries will tell whether it all pays ofT or not." 
Zizic said this year's group of boxers is a great group and his own skills have vastly improved as a result of instructing others. 
"Sometimes the best teacher you can have is yourself, because you show a guy something, and it makes you think 'Wait, I can do that, too,"' Zizic said. 
When not in training, the box­ers are actively selling program ads to family members, friends and local business. These pro­gram ads are a major source of revenue for the Bengal Bouts, and all boxers are required to sell at least one ad before their frrst sparring session. 
Individuals or businesses inter­ested in purchasing ads or giving to the Bengal Mission Bouts can obtain ad cards and contact information at http://bengal­bouts.nd.edu. Individual boxers are also available to take ad requests from interested parties.

held Big East scoring leader Rebekkah Brunson (18.2 points, 11 rebounds per game) in check. She managed 12 "points on 3-for-13 shooting. Six of her points came from the free throw line, and she only grabbed seven rebounds. 
"I was really pleased with our defense once again to hold them to 52 -they scored 76 on us last time we played," McGraw said. "I really think that they have made a commitment to the defensive end of the floor, and I think it's one that we didn't make earlier in the sea­son." 
Earlier this season, the Irish were knocked off by the Hoyas (10-10, 4-6 Big East), despite hold­ing a six-point lead with 55 sec­onds to go. Wednesday's game was sweet revenge for the Irish, who remained undefeated at home. 
Notre Dame never trailed in the game. Teresa Borton hit a layup to put the Irish up 2-0 in the first 16 seconds, and they never looked back. 
Georgetown cut the lead to 38­31 with 16:59 remaining in the second half. But the Irish called a timeout and proceeded to go on a 9-2 run to go ahead 47-33. After that, the Hoyas got within 10, but that was as close as they would get. 
Borton had a big game for the Irish, as she went 4-for-4 from the field for 10 points. She also grabbed four rebounds, helping the Irish pay back the Hoyas. 
"We really wanted a little bit of revenge from the last game," Borton said. "They just stole it away from us in the last two min­utes, and that really hurt us a lot. It was great to come back and win 
this game." Notre Dame held the Hoyas to 
29.6 percent shooting, and no Hoya made more than three field goals. They also out rebounded Georgetown 42-30. 
"The team knows that we are starting our best five defensive players. And if they want to start, then they need to be better defen­sively," McGraw said. "I think you're seeing a much more intense, focused group on the defensive end." 
On the offensive end, guard Megan Duffy also scored in double figures for the Irish, as she added 11 points and five assists. She was perfect from the line, hitting 6-of-6 attempts. Monique Hernandez added seven points and seven rebounds, in what was arguably her best game of the season.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
Irish finally starting to grow up 
A month ago, Notre Dame led by six points over Georgetown with 55 seconds remaining in its first Big East game of the season. 
Then, inexperi­ence, immaturity and a col­lective mental and physical breakdown allowed George-Joe Hettler town to fm­ish the game with Sports Editor an 11-2 run and upset Notre Dame 76-73. 

It was Georgetown's first win over Notre Dame in 18 years, and it sent the Irish, at the time 7-6 and 0-1, back to South Bend searching for answers to fix a season quick­ly sinking into mediocrity. 
Wednesday night, at the Joyce Center, Georgetown made another comeback by starting the second half on a 10-2 run to cut a 13-point Notre Dame halftime lead to five at 38-33 with 15:52 left. But this Notre Dame team wasn't the same one that imploded against Georgetown in early January. 
Irish coach Muffet McGraw called a timeout, and then watched her team score 22 of the next 30 points to bury the Hoyas en route to a 66-52 vic­tory. 
It's official-Notre Dame has finally grown up. 
"I think it was a great opportunity for us to get a game back and see just how much we have improved since the last time we played them," McGraw said. 
The Irish have searched for and struggled to find consis­tency over the past two sea­sons. Besides a couple of upset wins in the NCAA tournament in 2003, Notre Dame has not dominated its opponents for any extended period. 
Until the past three weeks of this season. 
Aside from a loss to West Virginia, Notre Dame has been nearly unstoppable. The Irish knocked off No. 4 Connecticut by 15, held No. 23 Villanova to 36 points and beat three other ranked foes en route to win­ning seven of their last eight games to improve to 14-7 (7­
2) and regain a national rank­ing (No. 23). 
It's easily been the most impressive stretch of basket­ball Notre Dame has played in the last two seasons. Outstanding defense should be given much of the credit for the turnaround. The Irish are allowing only 50 points a game to the opposition during this winning stretch. Notre Dame has also shut down opponents' star players­holding Connecticut's Diana Taurasi to 11 points on 4-of­15 shooting and Georgetown's Rebekkah Brunson to only 12 points on a dismal 3-of-13 field goals. 
It's been the enhanced defensive effort that has Notre Dame rolling through its Big East schedule. The Irish face just one more ranked foe in the regular season and are just one game behind confer­ence-leading Connecticut for the Big East title. 
One month ago, none of this seemed possible. After the Georgetown loss, it appeared Notre Dame would completely collapse at any moment, espe­cially with such a gruesome schedule on the horizon. 
But on that quiet plane ride home from D.C., the Irish regrouped and refocused for the rest of the season. 
At the first practice follow­ing the loss, McGraw and her staff went into the locker room to decide what to work on in the upcoming session. When they cam~ out, the team was already practicing, waiting to put in more work. 
"I think that was a state­ment they made to the coach­es and to themselves saying, 'We're ready to get down to business' and 'We're ready to right the ship,"' McGraw said. "And they did. From that point on we've been on a great roll." 
The Irish just hope that roll continues into the Big East and NCAA Tournament.

FOOTBALL RECRUITING 
Seventeen sign letters of intent with Irish 
Irish still waiting for official word on Baker 
By PAT LEONARD 
Sports Writer 
Terrail Lambert did not follow his cousin's lead. 
Two years after California running back Lorenzo Booker reneged on Notre Dame and committed to Florida State on signing day, the defensive back Lambert chose the Irish over the Seminoles and became the 16th of 17 official signees for the Irish f o o t b a II See Also class of 
"Rough 5-7 season

announced page 19 16 players as official commitments at a Wednesday press conference in the football auditorium of the Joyce Center at 3:30 p.m. The football office then confirmed the signing of Connecticut wide receiver Christopher Vaughn less than one hour after the conference ended, rounding the class out at 17 players. 

"This day has become, in most regards to some people, probably the most important day in college football," Willingham said. 
The coach did not try to dispel rumors that this year's class is less impressive than those in past seasons, but Willingham did defend the efforts of his coaching staff. 
"You have this year, a season that didn't quite meet our exp·ectations," he said. "That is another reason why I think [defensive line] coach [Greg] Mattison, our recruiting coordi­nator and our staff did an excel­lent job in working through all of the difficulties in putting together a really solid class with some very special players in there." 
The Irish recruited players from 10 different states: four defensive backs, three offensive linemen, three defensive ends, three linebackers, two running backs and two quarterbacks. 
ESPN recruiting analyst Tom Lemming had the Irish class rated 27th nationally prior to signing day. With the signing of Lambert and Vaughn, Notre Dame could climb into the top 25.

BENGAL BOUTS 
Spar for the course 
Boxers take next step on road to Bengal Bouts by starting sparring duels 

By LUKE BUSAM 
Sports Writer 
The newly re-matted ring in the Joyce Center Boxing Room began its speckling process as the first drops of blood from the 2004 Bengal Bouts season struck its surface Monday afternoon. The spots of crimson will continue to accumulate over the· next several weeks as the boxers glove up for their first full contact sessions. 
These initial sparring sessions bring this year's boxers one step closer to the 74th annual Notre Dame Bengal Bouts Tournament which begins Feb. 25. Well over 100 boxers will participate in the charity boxing event this year, pushing their bodies and minds to raise much-needed money for the Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh. 

Experienced members of the box­ing team welcomed the onset of sparring as an opportunity to polish skills that may have faded slightly and remind themselves of the full experience of the ring. 
"Its great to get your head snapped back once or twice to get back to reality," club co-president and senior captain Pat Dillon said. 
Dillon said that even experienced boxers will overestimate their abili­ties prior to their frrst spar of a new season. 
"Everybody thinks they are better than they are until they get hit by a straight riglit hand in sparring," Dillon said.
